Preface
In preparing this ninth edition, we had three primary goals. 
First, we wanted to incorporate the sweeping changes in 
the United States and world economies we have all wit-
nessed in the last several years, and the difficulties that the 
world economics have continued to experience in recover-
ing from the severe economic downturn. Second, we strived 
to update this edition to reflect the latest exciting develop-
ments in economic thinking and make these accessible to 
new students of economics. Finally, we wanted to stay true 
to the philosophy of the textbook—using basic concepts of 
economics to explain a wide variety of timely and interesting 
economic applications.
c What’s New To This Edition
In addition to updating all the figures and data, we made a 
number of other key changes in this edition. They include 
the following:
• At the beginning of each chapter, we carefully refined 
our Learning Objectives to match the contents of the 
chapter closely. These give the students a preview of 
what they will learn in each section of the chapter, 
facilitating their learning.
• We discuss in Chapter 6 whether the recent major 
recession permanently affected labor force participa-
tion.
• We discuss in Chapter 8 the position of the pessimists 
who think that technological progress has slowed down.
• We also introduce in Chapter 8 the idea of controlled 
experiments in economic policy, as these experiments 
have been very influential in recent policy develop-
ments.
• We discuss in Chapter 13 the rationale and application 
of “stress tests” as a new tool for financial regulation.
• We introduce Janet Yellen, the new Chair of the 
Federal Reserve, in Chapter 14, and discuss her prior 
experience before she assumed her current role
• We revised and expanded our discussion of the euro 
in Chapter 19, reflecting the serious challenges now 
­facing the European Monetary Union, particularly 
with the experience of Greece.
• We also incorporated a total of 44 exciting new Appli­
cations into this edition, including five in the common 
chapters (Chapters 1–4), 22 in macroeconomics, and 
17 in microeconomics. In addition, we incorporated a 
total of 14 new chapter-opening stories, including one 
in the common chapters, seven in macroeconomics, 
and six in microeconomics. These fresh applications 
and chapter openers show the widespread relevance of 
economic analysis.
• In the chapters common to macroeconomics and 
microeconomics, the new applications include housing 
prices in Cuba (Chapter 1), property rights in urban 
slums (Chapter 3), and the effects of winds from the 
Sahara Desert on the price of chocolate (Chapter 4).
• In the macroeconomics chapters, the new applica-
tions include understanding the links between unem-
ployment and unemployment insurance (Chapter 6), 
how the government promotes high levels of savings 
in Singapore (Chapter 7), how Greek citizens hoarded 
euros as the talk of crisis grew (Chapter 13), new 
research on “ underwater” homeowners (Chapter 12), 
the debate on secular stagnation (Chapter 15), and how 
accounting for “missing” international financial flows 
changes our thinking of global investment patterns 
(Chapter 19).
• In the microeconomics chapters, the new applications 
include the market effects of a luxury tax (Chapter 21), 
the neuroscience of the “cola wars” between Coke and 
Pepsi (Chapter 22), the time path of blueberry prices 
triggered by publicity about the health benefits of eat-
ing blueberries (Chapter 24), the new advertising pro-
gram for dairy products, “Milk Life” (Chapter 27), 
genetic discrimination in insurance (Chapter 29), clear-
ing space debris (Chapter 30), responding to climate 
change by washing carbon out of the air (Chapter 31), 
and proposals to expand the earned income tax credit 
(Chapter 32).

4.10 Crop Insurance. Consider a state in which farmers are 
divided equally into two types: high risk and low risk. 
The average annual crop loss (and possible insurance 
claim) is $200 for a low-risk farmer and $1,200 for a 
high-risk farmer.
a. If all farmers were to buy insurance, what is the 
break-even price for the insurance company?
b. Suppose a farmer will purchase insurance only if the 
price (the annual premium) is no more than 50 per-
cent higher than his or her average crop loss. What 
is the equilibrium price?
4.11 Safety Rebate from the Insurance Company. In 
2010 a leading insurance company started a policy that 
pays a policyholder a 5 percent rebate on his or her 
insurance premium in any year in which the driver does 
not file an insurance claim. For example, a household 
with an annual premium of $1,200 will get a $60 rebate 
check each year it does not file a claim. Explain the 
rationale for the rebate policy. What problem is the 
policy trying to solve? (Related to Application 4 on 
page 653.)
The Economics of Consumer Search
Use the marginal principle to describe optimal search by 
consumers.
5.1 The reservation price is the price at which the con-
sumer is 
 about additional search, meaning 
that the 
 of search equals the 
.
5.2 If a consumer knows that TVs are available at BestBuy 
at a price as low as $200, it is sensible not to continue 
shopping until the consumer finds the lowest-price 
store. 
 (True/False)
5.3 Suppose the range of prices for a cooking book is $30 
to $70 and your discovered price (lowest price so far) 
is $48. If you visit one more store and discover a lower 
price, the best guess for a lower price is 
 and 
the savings if you discover this lower price is 
.
5.4 As the opportunity cost of search time increases, the 
reservation price 
 (increases, decreases) 
and the amount of search time 
 (increases, 
decreases).
5.5 A doubling of prices 
 (increases, decreases) 
the marginal benefit of search at a given 
 
price, and the percentage gap between the reserva-
tion price and the lowest price 
 (increases, 
decreases).
5.6 A study of consumer search for liquid detergents esti-
mated that a doubling of income decreased the amount 
of search by roughly 
 (1, 14, 50, 70) percent. 
(Related to Application 5 on page 657.)
5.7 Compute the Reservation Price. Suppose the range 
of prices for a consumer good is $20 to $60, and all 
prices in this range are equally likely.
a. Fill in the blanks in the table.
Discovered price (lowest so far)
$40
$30
Probability of discovering lower 
price in next visit
_____
_____
Best guess of lower price
_____
_____
Savings if lower price is 
discovered
_____
_____
Marginal benefit: Expected 
 savings from additional visit
_____
_____
b. If the marginal cost of search is $1.25, the reserva-
tion price is 
.
5.8 Internet and Reservation Prices. Consider a coun-
try that initially has no Internet service or telephones, 
so consumers must travel to stores to get information 
about prices. Use a graph to show the effects of intro-
ducing Internet service on the reservation price for a 
consumer good.

Rolling foR lEMonS
In this experiment, students play the role of consumers pur-
chasing used cars. Over half the used cars on the road (57%) 
are plums, and the remaining cars (43%) are lemons. Each 
consumer offers a price for a used car and then rolls a pair of 
dice to find out whether he or she gets a lemon or a plum. In 
general, rolling a big number is good news: To get a plum, 
you need to roll a big number. The higher the price you offer, 
the smaller the number you must roll to get a plum. Here is 
how the experiment works:
• Each consumer tells the instructor how much he or she is 
offering for a used car and then rolls the dice.
• The instructor tells the consumer whether the number 
rolled is large enough to get a plum. If the number is not 
large enough, the consumer gets a lemon.
E co no Mic E x P E R iM En t
• The consumers’ scores equal the difference between the 
maximum amount they are willing to pay for the type of 
car they got ($1,200 for a plum and $400 for a lemon) and 
the price they actually paid. For example, if Otto offers 
$500 and gets a plum, his score is $700. If Carla offers 
$600 and gets a lemon, her score is -$200.
• The instructor announces the result of each transaction 
to the class.
• There are three to five buying periods. At the end of the 
last trading period, each consumer adds up his or her 
score.
c Applying The Concepts
This is an Applications-driven textbook. We carefully selected over 130 real-world Applications that help students develop 
and master essential economic concepts. Here is an example of our approach from Chapter 4, “Demand, Supply, and Market 
Equilibrium.”
Each chapter includes three to five thought-provoking 
Applying the Concepts questions that convey impor-
tant economic concepts, paired with and illustrated by 
an Application that discusses the concept and conveys its 
real-world use.
For each Application and Applying the Concepts 
question, we provide end-of-chapter exercises 
that test students’ understanding of the concepts.
In addition, some chapters contain an Economic 
Experiment section that gives students the opportu-
nity to do their own economic analysis.

that increases in state cigarette taxes between 1990 and 2005 
resulted in less participation (fewer smokers) and lower fre-
quency (fewer cigarettes per smoker).
A change in cigarette taxes in Canada illustrates the sec-
ond effect, the new-smoker effect. In 1994, several provinces 
in eastern Canada cut their cigarette taxes in response to the 
smuggling of cigarettes from the United States (where taxes are 
lower), and the price of cigarettes in the provinces decreased 
by roughly 50 percent. Researchers tracked the choices of 591 
youths from the Waterloo Smoking Prevention Program and 
concluded that the lower price increased the smoking rate by 
roughly 17 percent. Related to Exercises 1.6 and 1.8.

As price decreases and we move downward along the market 
demand for cigarettes, the quantity of cigarettes demanded 
increases for two reasons. First, people who smoked cigarettes 
at the original price respond to the lower price by smoking more. 
Second, some people start smoking.
In the United States, cigarette taxes vary across states, 
and studies of cigarette consumption patterns show that higher 
taxes mean less cigarette consumption by youths. Using data 
from the Youth Risk Behavior Surveys (YSBS), one study shows

The Demand for Labor
Explain why competition generates wages equal to marginal 
revenue product.
1.1 The marginal revenue product of labor equals 
 times 
 .
1.2 A profit-maximizing firm will hire the number of work-
ers where 
 equals 
 .
1.3 Your favorite professional team is considering hiring a 
new player for $3 million per year. It will be sensible 
(profitable) to hire the player if his 
 is greater 
than the $3 million cost.
1.4 Arrows up or down: The logic of the output effect is 
that a decrease in the wage will 
 produc-
tion costs, so the price of output will 
 and 
the quantity of output demanded will 
 . As a 
result, the quantity of labor demanded will 
 .
1.5 The input-substitution effect is that a decrease in the 
wage 
 (increases/decreases) the quantity of 
labor per unit of 
 , so the quantity of labor 
demanded 
 (increases/decreases).
1.6 The short-run market demand curve for labor is 
 (steeper/flatter) than the long-run demand 
because 
 occur(s) in the short run.
1.7 Fill the blanks with 75, 100, 117, 200, or 360. In major 
league baseball, the marginal revenue product of the 
typical free agent is roughly 
 percent of his 
salary, compared to 
 percent for a journey-
man and 
 percent for an apprentice. (Related 
to Application 1 on page 707.)
1.8 Demand for News Kids. Consider the market for 
newspaper delivery kids in Kidsville. Each news kid 
receives a piece rate of $2 per subscriber per month 
and has a fixed territory that initially has 100 subscrib-
ers. The price elasticity of demand for subscriptions is 
2.0. Suppose the new city council of Kidsville passes 
a law that establishes a minimum piece rate of $3 
per subscriber per month. As a result, the publisher 
increases the monthly price of a subscription by 20 per-
cent. How will the new law affect the monthly income 
of the typical news kid?
1.9 Demand for Airline Pilots. Comment on the follow-
ing: “There is no substitute for an airline pilot: Some-
one has to fly the plane. Therefore, an increase in the 
wage of airline pilots will not change the number of 
pilots used by the airlines.”
The Supply of Labor
Explain why an increase in the wage could increase, decrease, 
or not change hours worked.
2.1 Arrows up or down: An increase in the wage 
 
the opportunity cost of leisure time, which tends to 
 leisure time and 
 labor time.
2.2 Arrows up or down: An increase in the wage 
 
real income, and if leisure is a normal good this tends 
to 
 leisure time and 
 labor time.
2.3 We 
 (can/cannot) predict a worker’s response 
to an increase in the wage because the 
 effect 
and the 
 effect work in 
 (the same/
opposite) direction(s).
2.4 Your objective is to earn exactly $120 per week. If your 
wage decreases from $6 to $4 per hour, you respond by 
working 
 hours instead of 
 hours. 
In other words, your labor-supply curve is 
 
sloped.
2.5 In the short run, labor supply is influenced by the 
wage rate, while in the long run, it is influenced by net 
advantages of the job.

throughout the book. Chapter 3, “Exchange and Markets,” 
is devoted entirely to exchange and trade. We discuss the 
fundamental rationale for exchange and introduce some 
of the institutions modern societies developed to facilitate 
trade.
Students need to have a solid understanding of demand 
and supply to be successful in the course. Many students 
have difficulty understanding movement along a curve ver-
sus shifts of a curve. To address this difficulty, we developed 
an innovative way to organize topics in Chapter 4, “Demand, 
Supply, and Market Equilibrium.” We examine the law of 
demand and changes in quantity demanded, the law of sup-
ply and changes in quantity supplied, and then the notion 
of market equilibrium. After students have a firm grasp of 
equilibrium concepts, we explore the effects of changes in 
demand and supply on equilibrium prices and quantities. 
You can present either macroeconomics or microeconomics 
chapters first, depending on your preference.
Summary of the Macroeconomics Chapters
Part 2, “The Basic Concepts of Macroeconomics” (Chapters 
5 and 6), introduces students to the key concepts—GDP, 
inflation, unemployment—that are used throughout the text 
and in everyday economic discussion. The two chapters in 
this section provide the building blocks for the rest of the 
book. Part 3, “The Economy in the Long Run” (Chapters 7 
and 8), analyzes how the economy operates at full employ-
ment and explores the causes and consequences of economic 
growth.
Next we turn to the short run. We begin the discussion 
of business cycles, economic fluctuations, and the role of gov-
ernment in Part 4, “Economic Fluctuations and Fiscal Policy” 
(Chapters 9 through 12). We devote an entire chapter to the 
structure of government spending and revenues and the role 
of fiscal policy. In Part 5, “Money, Banking, and Monetary 
Policy” (Chapters 13 and 14), we introduce the key elements 
of both monetary theory and policy into our economic mod-
els. Part 6, “Inflation, Unemployment, and Economic Policy” 
(Chapters 15 through 17), brings the important questions of 
the dynamics of inflation and unemployment into our analy-
sis. Finally, the last two chapters in Part 7, “The International 
Economy” (Chapter 18 and 19), provide an in-depth analysis 
of both international trade and finance.
c Why Five Key Principles?
In Chapter 2, “The Key Principles of Economics,” we intro-
duce the following five key principles and then apply them 
throughout the book:
1.	
The Principle of Opportunity Cost. The opportunity 
cost of something is what you sacrifice to get it.
2.	
The Marginal Principle. Increase the level of an activ-
ity as long as its marginal benefit exceeds its marginal 
cost. Choose the level at which the marginal benefit 
equals the marginal cost.
3.	
The Principle of Voluntary Exchange. A voluntary 
exchange between two people makes both people bet-
ter off.
4.	
The Principle of Diminishing Returns. If we increase 
one input while holding the other inputs fixed, output 
will increase, but at a decreasing rate.
5.	
The Real-Nominal Principle. What matters to people 
is the real value of money or income—its purchasing 
power—not the face value of money or income.
This approach of repeating five key principles gives students 
the big picture—the framework of economic reasoning. We 
make the key concepts unforgettable by using them repeat-
edly, illustrating them with intriguing examples, and giv-
ing students many opportunities to practice what they’ve 
learned. Throughout the text, economic concepts are con-
nected to the five key principles when the following callout 
is provided for each principle:
P R I N C I P L E  O F  O P P O R T U N I T Y  C O S T
The opportunity cost of something is what you sacrifice to get it. 
c How Is The Book Organized?
Chapter 1, “Introduction: What Is Economics?” uses 
three current policy issues—traffic congestion, poverty in 
Africa, and Japan’s prolonged recession—to explain the 
economic way of thinking. Chapter 2, “The Key Principles 
of Economics,” introduces the five principles we return to 

23
A Few Features of Our Macroeconomics 
Chapters
The following are a few features of our macroeconomics 
chapters:
• Flexibility. A key dilemma confronting economics pro-
fessors has always been how much time to devote to 
long-run topics, such as growth and production, versus 
short-run topics, such as economic fluctuations and busi-
ness cycles. Our book is designed to let professors choose. 
It works like this: To pursue a long-run approach, profes-
sors should initially concentrate on Chapters 1 through 4, 
followed by Chapters 5 through 8.
• To focus on economic fluctuations, start with 
Chapters 1 through 4, present Chapter 5, “Measuring 
a Nation’s Production and Income,” and Chapter 6, 
“Unemployment and Inflation,” and then turn to 
Chapter 9, “Aggregate Demand and Aggregate Supply.”
• Chapter 11, “The Income-Expenditure Model,” is self-
contained, so instructors can either skip it completely 
or cover it as a foundation for aggregate demand.
• Long Run. Throughout most of the 1990s, the U.S. 
economy performed very well—low inflation, low 
unemployment, and rapid economic growth. This 
robust performance led to economists’ increasing 
interest in trying to understand the processes of eco-
nomic growth. Our discussion of economic growth in 
Chapter 8, “Why Do Economies Grow?” addresses the 
fundamental question of how long-term living stan-
dards are determined and why some countries prosper 
while others do not. This is the essence of economic 
growth. As Nobel Laureate Robert E. Lucas, Jr., once 
wrote, “Once you start thinking about growth, it is 
hard to think of anything else.”
• Short Run. The great economic expansion of the 
1990s came to an end in 2001, as the economy started 
to contract. The recession beginning in 2007 was 
the worst downturn since World War II. Difficult 
economic times remind us that macroeconomics is 
also concerned with understanding the causes and 
­consequences of economic fluctuations. Why do 
­economies experience recessions and depressions, 
and what steps can policymakers take to stabilize the 
economy and ease the devastation people suffer from 
them? This has been a constant theme of macroeco-
nomics throughout its entire history and is covered 
extensively in the text.
• Policy. Macroeconomics is a policy-oriented subject, 
and we treat economic policy in virtually every chapter. 
We discuss both important historical and more recent 
macroeconomic events in conjunction with the theory. 
In addition, we devote Chapter 17, “Macroeconomic 
Policy Debates,” to three important policy topics that 
recur frequently in macroeconomic debates: the role 
of government deficits, whether the Federal Reserve 
should target inflation or other objectives, and whether 
income or consumption should be taxed.
Summary of the Microeconomics Chapters
A course in microeconomics starts with the first four chap-
ters of the book, which provide a foundation for more 
detailed study of individual decision making and markets.
Part 8, “A Closer Look at Demand and Supply,” 
(Chapters 20 through 22), provides a closer look at demand 
and supply, including elasticity, market efficiency, and 
consumer choice. Part 9, “Market Structures and Pricing” 
(Chapters 23 through 28), starts with a discussion of produc-
tion and costs, setting the stage for an examination of alter-
native market structures, including the extremes of perfect 
competition and monopoly, as well as the middle ground of 
monopolistic competition and oligopoly. The last chapter in 
Part 9 discusses antitrust policy and deregulation. Part 10, 
“Externalities and Information” (Chapters 29 through 31), 
discusses the circumstances under which markets break 
down, including imperfect information, public goods, and 
environmental degradation.
Part 11, “The Labor Market and Income Distribution” 
(Chapter 32), explores the economic forces that determine 
wages, and also examines recent changes in the distribution 
of income and the effects of government programs on the 
income distribution.

For the Instructor
Instructors can choose how much or how little time to spend 
setting up and using MyLab Economics. 
Each chapter contains two preloaded exercise sets 
that can be used to build an individualized study plan for 
each student. These study plan exercises contain tutorial 
resources, including instant feedback, links to the appro-
priate learning objective in the eText, pop-up definitions 
from the text, and step-by-step guided solutions, where 
appropriate. After the initial setup of the course by the 
instructor, student use of these materials requires no fur-
ther instructor setup. The online grade book records each 
student’s performance and time spent on the tests and 
study plan and generates reports by student or chapter.
Instructors can fully customize MyLab Economics to 
match their course exactly, including reading assignments, 
homework assignments, video assignments, current news 
assignments, and quizzes and tests. Assignable resources 
include:
• Preloaded exercise assignments sets for each chapter 
that include the student tutorial resources mentioned 
earlier
• Preloaded quizzes for each chapter that are unique to 
the text and not repeated in the study plan or home-
work exercise sets
• Study plan problems that are similar to the end-of-
chapter problems and numbered exactly like the book 
to make assigning homework easier
• Real-Time-Data Analysis Exercises, marked with 
, 
allow students and instructors to use the very latest data 
from FRED. By completing the exercises, students 
become familiar with a key data source, learn how to 
locate data, and develop skills in interpreting data.
• In the eText available in MyLab Economics, select fig-
ures labeled MyLab Economics Real-time data allow 
students to display a pop-up graph updated with real-
time data from FRED.
• Current News Exercises provide a turnkey way to assign 
gradable news-based exercises in MyLab Economics. 
Each week, Pearson scours the news, finds a current 
microeconomics and macroeconomics article, creates 
exercises around these news articles, and then automat-
ically adds them to MyLab Economics. Assigning and 
grading current news-based exercises that deal with 
the latest micro and macro events and policy issues has 
never been more convenient.
• Experiments in MyLab Economics are a fun and engag-
ing way to promote active learning and mastery of 
important economic concepts. Pearson’s Experiments 
program is flexible, easy-to-assign, auto-graded, and 
available in Single and Multiplayer versions. 
• Single-player experiments allow your students to play 
against virtual players from anywhere at any time so 
long as they have an Internet connection.
c MyLab Economics
Digital Features Located in MyLab Economics
MyLab Economics is a unique online course management, 
testing, and tutorial resource. It is included with the eText 
version of the book or as a supplement to the print book. 
Students and instructors will find the following online 
resources to accompany the ninth edition:
• Concept Checks: Each section of each learning objec-
tive concludes with an online Concept Check that con-
tains one or two multiple choice, true/false, or fill-in 
questions. These checks act as “speed bumps” that 
encourage students to stop and check their understand-
ing of fundamental terms and concepts before moving 
on to the next section. The goal of this digital resource 
is to help students assess their progress on a section-by-
section basis, so they can be better prepared for home-
work, quizzes, and exams.
• Animations: Graphs are the backbone of introductory 
economics, but many students struggle to understand and 
work with them. Many of the numbered figures in the 
text a supporting animated version online. The goal of 
this digital resource is to help students understand shifts 
in curves, movements along curves, and changes in equi-
librium values. Having an animated version of a graph 
helps students who have difficulty interpreting the static 
version in the printed text. Graded practice exercises are 
included with the animations. Our experience is that 
many students benefit from this type of online learning.
• Graphs Updated with Real-Time Data from 
FRED: Approximately 16 graphs are continuously 
updated online with the latest available data from 
FRED (Federal Reserve Economic Data), which is a 
comprehensive, up-to-date data set maintained by the 
Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. 
	
Students can display a pop-up 
graph that shows new data 
plotted in the graph. The 
goal of this digital feature is to help students under-
stand how to work with data and understand how 
including new data affects graphs.
• Interactive Problems and Exercises Updated with 
Real-Time Data from FRED: The end-of-chapter 
problems in select chapters include real-time data 
exercises 
 that use the latest data from FRED. The 
book contains several of these specially-selected exer-
cises. The goal of this digital feature is to help students 
become familiar with this key data source, learn how to 
locate data, and develop skills in interpreting data.
c Integrated Supplements 
The authors and Pearson Education have worked together 
to integrate the text and media resources to make teaching 
and learning easier.

guidelines found in the AACSB Assurance of Learning 
Standards.
What Is the AACSB?  AACSB is a not-for-profit corpo-
ration of educational institutions, corporations, and other 
organizations devoted to the promotion and improvement 
of higher education in business administration and account-
ing. A collegiate institution offering degrees in business 
administration or accounting may volunteer for AACSB 
accreditation review. The AACSB makes initial accredita-
tion decisions and conducts periodic reviews to promote 
continuous quality improvement in management educa-
tion. Pearson Education is a proud member of the AACSB 
and is pleased to provide advice to help you apply AACSB 
Assurance of Learning Standards.
What Are AACSB Assurance of Learning Standards?  
One of the criteria for AACSB accreditation is the quality 
of curricula. Although no specific courses are required, the 
AACSB expects a curriculum to include learning experiences 
in the following categories of Assurance of Learning Standards:
• Written and Oral Communication
• Ethical Understanding and Reasoning
• Analytical Thinking Skills
• Information Technology
• Diverse and Multicultural Work
• Reflective Thinking
• Application of Knowledge.
Questions that test skills relevant to these standards are 
tagged with the appropriate standard. For example, a 
­question testing the moral questions associated with exter-
nalities would receive the Ethical Understanding and 
Reasoning tag.
How Can Instructors Use the AACSB Tags?  Tagged 
questions help you measure whether students are grasp-
ing the course content that aligns with the AACSB guide-
lines noted earlier. This in turn may suggest enrichment 
activities or other educational experiences to help students 
achieve these skills.
TestGen
The computerized TestGen package allows instructors to 
customize, save, and generate classroom tests. The test pro-
gram permits instructors to edit, add, or delete questions 
from the Test Item Files; analyze test results; and orga-
nize a database of tests and student results. This software 
allows for extensive flexibility and ease of use. It provides 
many options for organizing and displaying tests, along with 
search and sort features. The software and the Test Item

Introduction: 
What Is Economics?
C h a p t e r 
1
Economics is the science 
of choice, exploring the choices 
made by individuals and 
organizations.
Over the last few centuries, these choices have led to 
substantial gains in the standard of living around the 
globe. In the United States, the typical person today 
has roughly seven times the income and purchasing 
power of a person 100 years ago. Our prosperity is the 
result of choices made by all sorts of people, includ-
ing inventors, workers, entrepreneurs, and the people 
who saved money and loaned it to others to invest in 
machines and other tools of production. One reason we have prospered is greater efficiency: We have discovered 
better ways to use our resources—raw materials, time, and energy—to produce the goods and services we value.
As an illustration of changes in the standard of living and our growing prosperity, let’s compare the way people 
listened to music in 1891 with how we listen today. You can buy an iPod shuffle® for $49 and fill it with 500 songs 
at $0.99 each. If you earn a wage of $15 per hour, it would take you about 36 hours of work to purchase and then 
fill an iPod. Back in 1891, the latest technological marvel was Thomas Edison’s cylinder phonograph, which played 
music recorded on 4-inch cylinders. Imagine that you lived back then and wanted to get just as much music as 
you could fit on an iPod. Given the wages and prices in 1891, it would take you roughly 800 hours of work to earn 
enough money to buy the phonograph and all the cylinders. And if you wanted to keep your music with you, you 
would need 14 backpacks to carry the cylinders.
Although prosperity and efficiency are widespread, they are not universal. In some parts of the world, many 
people live in poverty. For example, in sub-Saharan Africa 388 million people—about half the population—live on 
less than $1.25 per day. And in all nations of the world, inefficiencies still exist, with valuable resources being wasted. 
For example, each year the typical urban commuter in the United States wastes more than 47 hours and $84 worth 
of gasoline stuck in rush-hour traffic.

Chapter 1 • Introduction: What Is Economics?
E
conomics provides a framework to diagnose all sorts of problems faced by society 
and then helps create and evaluate various proposals to solve them. Economics 
can help us develop strategies to replace poverty with prosperity, and to replace 
waste with efficiency. In this chapter, we explain what economics is and how we all can 
use economic analysis to think about practical problems and solutions.
What Is Economics?
Economists use the word scarcity to convey the idea that resources—the things we use 
to produce goods and services—are limited, while human wants are unlimited. There-
fore, we cannot produce everything that everyone wants. As the old saying goes, you 
can’t always get what you want. Economics studies the choices we make when there is 
scarcity; it is all about trade-offs. Here are some examples of scarcity and the trade-offs 
associated with making choices:
• You have a limited amount of time. If you take a part-time job, each hour on the 
job means one fewer hour for study or play.
• A city has a limited amount of land. If the city uses an acre of land for a park, it 
has one fewer acre for housing, retail, or industry.
• You have limited income this year. If you spend $17 on a music CD, that’s $17 
fewer you have to spend on other products or to save.
People produce goods (music CDs, houses, and parks) and services (the advice 
of physicians and lawyers) by using one or more of the following five factors of 
production, also called production inputs or simply resources:
• Natural resources are provided by nature. Some examples are fertile land, min-
eral deposits, oil and gas deposits, and water. Some economists refer to all types 
of natural resources as land.
• Labor is the physical and mental effort people use to produce goods and services.
• Physical capital is the stock of equipment, machines, structures, and infrastruc-
ture that is used to produce goods and services. Some examples are forklifts, 
machine tools, computers, factories, airports, roads, and fiber-optic cables.
• Human capital is the knowledge and skills acquired by a worker through educa-
tion and experience. Every job requires some human capital: To be a surgeon, 
you must learn anatomy and acquire surgical skills. To be an accountant, you 
must learn the rules of accounting and acquire computer skills. To be a musician, 
you must learn to play an instrument.
• Entrepreneurship is the effort used to coordinate the factors of production—
natural resources, labor, physical capital, and human capital—to produce and 
sell products. An entrepreneur comes up with an idea for a product, decides 
how to produce it, and raises the funds to bring it to the market. Some examples 
of entrepreneurs are Bill Gates of Microsoft, Steve Jobs of Apple Computer, 
Howard Schultz of Starbucks, and Ray Kroc of McDonald’s.
Given our limited resources, we make our choices in a variety of ways. Sometimes 
we make our decisions as individuals, and other times we participate in collective deci-
sion making, allowing the government and other organizations to choose for us. Many 
of our choices happen within markets, institutions or arrangements that enable us to 
buy and sell things. For example, most of us participate in the labor market, exchanging 
our time for money, and we all participate in consumer markets, exchanging money 
for food and clothing. But we make other choices outside markets—from our personal 
decisions about everyday life to our political choices about matters that concern society 
as a whole. What unites all these decisions is the notion of scarcity: We can’t have it 
all; there are trade-offs.

Economists are always reminding us that there is scarcity—there are trade-offs in 
everything we do. Suppose that in a conversation with your economics instructor you 
share your enthusiasm about an upcoming launch of the space shuttle. The economist 
may tell you that the resources used for the shuttle could have been used instead for 
an unmanned mission to Mars.
By introducing the notion of scarcity into your conversation, your instructor is 
simply reminding you that there are trade-offs, that one thing (a Mars mission) is 
sacrificed for another (a shuttle mission). Talking about alternatives is the first step 
in a process that can help us make better choices about how to use our resources. For 
example, we could compare the scientific benefits of a shuttle mission to the benefits 
of a Mars mission and choose the mission with the greater benefit.
Positive versus Normative Analysis
Economics doesn’t tell us what to choose—shuttle mission or Mars mission—but ­simply 
helps us to understand the trade-offs. President Harry S. Truman once remarked,
All my economists say, “On the one hand, . . .; On the other hand, . . .?.” Give me a one-
handed economist!
An economist might say, “On the one hand, we could use a shuttle mission to do more 
experiments in the gravity-free environment of Earth’s orbit; on the other hand, we 
could use a Mars mission to explore the possibility of life on other planets.” In using 
both hands, the economist is not being evasive, but simply doing economics, discuss-
ing the alternative uses of our resources. The ultimate decision about how to use our 
resources—shuttle mission or Mars exploration—is the responsibility of citizens or 
their elected officials.
Most modern economics is based on positive analysis, which predicts the 
­consequences of alternative actions by answering the question “What is?” or “What 
will be?” A second type of economic reasoning is normative in nature. Normative 
analysis answers the question “What ought to be?”
In Table 1.1, we compare positive questions to normative questions. Normative 
questions lie at the heart of policy debates. Economists contribute to policy debates by 
conducting positive analyses of the consequences of alternative actions. For example, an 
economist could predict the effects of an increase in the minimum wage on the number 
of people employed nationwide, the income of families with minimum-wage workers, 
and consumer prices. Armed with the conclusions of the economist’s positive analysis, 
citizens and policymakers could then make a normative decision about whether to 
increase the minimum wage. Similarly, an economist could study the projects that could 
be funded with $1 billion in foreign aid, predicting the effects of each project on the 
income per person in an African country. Armed with this positive analysis, policymak-
ers could then decide which projects to support.

• If the government increases the minimum 
wage, how many workers will lose their jobs?
• If two office-supply firms merge, will the price 
of office supplies increase?
• How does a college education affect a 
­person’s productivity and earnings?
• How do consumers respond to a cut in 
income taxes?
• If a nation restricts shoe imports, who benefits 
and who bears the cost?
• Should the government increase the minimum 
wage?
• Should the government block the merger of 
two office-supply firms?
• Should the government subsidize a college 
education?
• Should the government cut taxes to stimulate 
the economy?
• Should the government restrict imports?

Chapter 1 • Introduction: What Is Economics?
Economists don’t always reach the same conclusions in their positive analyses. The 
disagreements often concern the magnitude of a particular effect. For example, most econ-
omists agree that an increase in the minimum wage will cause unemployment, but disagree 
about how many people would lose their jobs. Similarly, economists agree that spending 
money to improve the education system in Africa will increase productivity and income, 
but disagree about the size of the increase in income.	
The Three Key Economic Questions: What, How, and Who?
We make economic decisions at every level in society. Individuals decide what products 
to buy, what occupations to pursue, and how much money to save. Firms decide what 
goods and services to produce and how to produce them. Governments decide what 
projects and programs to complete and how to pay for them. The choices of individuals, 
firms, and governments answer three questions:
1	 What products do we produce? Trade-offs exist: If a hospital uses its resources to 
perform more heart transplants, it has fewer resources to care for premature 
infants.
2	 How do we produce the products? Alternative means of production are available: 
Power companies can produce electricity with coal, natural gas, or wind power. 
Professors can teach in large lecture halls or small classrooms.
3	 Who consumes the products? We must decide how to distribute the products of 
society. If some people earn more money than others, should they consume more 
goods? How much money should the government take from the rich and give to 
the poor?
As we’ll see later in the book, most of these decisions are made in markets, where prices 
play a key role in determining what products we produce, how we produce them, and who 
gets the products. In Chapter 3, we examine the role of markets in modern economies 
and the role of government in market-based economies.	
Economic Models
Economists use economic models to explore the choices people make and the conse-
quences of those choices. An economic model is a simplified representation of an eco-
nomic environment, with all but the essential features of the environment eliminated. 
An economic model is an abstraction from reality that enables us to focus our atten-
tion on what really matters. As we’ll see throughout the book, most economic models 
use graphs to represent the economic environment.
To see the rationale for economic modeling, consider an architectural model. An 
architect builds a scale model of a new building and uses the model to show how the 
building will fit on a plot of land and blend with nearby buildings. The model shows 
the exterior features of the building, but not the interior features. We can ignore the 
interior features because they are unimportant for the task at hand—seeing how the 
building will fit into the local environment.
Economists build models to explore decision making by individuals, firms, and other 
organizations. For example, we can use a model of a profit-maximizing firm to predict 
how a firm will respond to increased competition. If a new car stereo store opens up in 
your town, will the old firms be passive and simply accept smaller market shares, or will 
they aggressively cut their prices to try to drive the new rival out of business? The model 
of the firm includes the monetary benefits and costs of doing business, and assumes that 
firms want to make as much money as possible. Although there may be other motives 
in the business world—to have fun or to help the world—the economic model ignores 
these other motives. The model focuses our attention on the profit motive and how it 
affects a firm’s response to increased competition.

Economic Analysis and Modern Problems
Economic analysis provides important insights into real-world problems. To explain 
how we can use economic analysis in problem solving, we provide three examples. 
You’ll see these examples again in more detail later in the book.
Economic View of Traffic Congestion
Consider first the problem of traffic congestion. According to the Texas Transporta-
tion Institute, the typical U.S. commuter wastes about 47 hours per year because of 
traffic congestion.1 In some cities, the time wasted is much greater: 93 hours in Los 
Angeles, 72 hours in San Francisco, and 63 hours in Houston. In addition to time lost, 
we also waste 2.3 billion gallons of gasoline and diesel fuel each year.
To an economist, the diagnosis of the congestion problem is straightforward. When 
you drive onto a busy highway during rush hour, your car takes up space and decreases 
the distance between the vehicles on the highway. A driver’s normal reaction to a shorter 
distance between moving cars is to slow down. So when you enter the highway, you 
force other commuters to slow down and thus spend more time on the highway. If each 
of your 900 fellow commuters spends just two extra seconds on the highway, you will 
increase the total travel time by 30 minutes. In deciding whether to use the highway, 
you will presumably ignore these costs you impose on others. Similarly, your fellow 
commuters ignore the cost they impose on you and others when they enter the highway. 
Because no single commuter pays the full cost (30 minutes), too many people use the 
highway, and everyone wastes time.
One possible solution to the congestion problem is to force people to pay for 
using the road, just as they pay for gasoline and tires. The government could impose 
a congestion tax of $8 per trip on rush-hour commuters and use a debit card system 
to collect the tax: Every time a car passes a checkpoint, a transponder would charge 
the commuter’s card. Traffic volume during rush hours would then decrease as 
travelers (a) shift their travel to off-peak times, (b) switch to ride-sharing and mass 
transit, and (c) shift their travel to less congested routes. The job for the econo-
mist is to compute the appropriate congestion tax and predict the consequences of 
imposing it.
Economic View of Poverty in Africa
Consider next the issue of poverty in Africa. In the final two decades of the twentieth 
century, the world economy grew rapidly, and the average per capita income (income 
per person) increased by about 35 percent. In contrast, the economies of poverty-
stricken sub-Saharan Africa shrank, and per capita income decreased by about 6 percent. 
Africa is the world’s second-largest continent in both area and population and accounts 
for more than 12 percent of the world’s human population. Figure 1.1 shows a map of 
Africa. The countries of sub-Saharan Africa are highlighted in orange.
Economists have found that as a nation’s economy grows, its poorest households 
share in the general prosperity.2 Therefore, one way to reduce poverty in sub-Saharan 
Africa is to increase economic growth. Economic growth occurs when a country 
expands its production facilities (machinery and factories), improves its public infra-
structure (highways and water systems), widens educational opportunities, and adopts 
new technology.
The recent experience of sub-Saharan Africa is somewhat puzzling because in the 
last few decades the region has expanded educational opportunities and received large 
amounts of foreign aid. Some recent work by economists on the sources of growth 
suggests that institutions such as the legal system and the regulatory environment also 
play key roles in economic growth.3 In sub-Saharan Africa, a simple legal dispute about 
a small debt takes about 30 months to resolve, compared to 5 months in the United 
States. In Mozambique, it takes 174 days to complete the procedures required to set 
up a business, compared to just 2 days in Canada. In many cases, institutions impede

rather than encourage the sort of investment and risk-taking—called entrepreneurship—
that causes economic growth and reduces poverty. As a consequence, economists and 
policymakers are exploring ways to reform the region’s institutions. They are also chal-
lenged with choosing among development projects that will generate the biggest eco-
nomic boost per dollar spent—the biggest bang per buck.
Economic View of the Current World Recession
Over the last several decades, the U.S. economy has performed well and has raised our 
standard of living. The general consensus was that our policymakers had learned to 
manage the economy effectively. Although the economy faltered at times, policymakers 
seemed to know how to restore growth and prosperity.
That is why the financial crisis and the recession that began in late 2007 has so 
shaken the confidence of people in the United States and around the world. The prob-
lems started innocently enough, with a booming market for homes that was fueled by 
easy credit from financial institutions. But we later discovered that many purchasers of 
homes and properties could not really afford them, and when many homeowners had 
trouble making their mortgage payments, the trouble spread to banks and other financial 
institutions. As a result, businesses found it increasingly difficult to borrow money for 
everyday use and investment, and economic activity around the world began to contract.
The major countries of the world have implemented aggressive policies to try to halt 
this downturn. Policymakers want to avoid the catastrophes that hit the global economy 
in the 1930s. Fortunately, they can draw on many years of experience in economic 
policy to guide the economy during this difficult time.
The Economic Way of Thinking 
How do economists think about problems and decision making? The economic way of 
thinking is best summarized by British economist John Maynard Keynes (1883–1946):4
The theory of economics does not furnish a body of settled conclusions immediately appli-
cable to policy. It is a method rather than a doctrine, an apparatus of the mind, a technique 
of thinking which helps its possessor draw correct conclusions.
Let’s look at the four elements of the economic way of thinking.

Use Assumptions to Simplify
Economists use assumptions to make things simpler and focus attention on what really 
matters. If you use a road map to plan a car trip from Seattle to San Francisco, you 
make two unrealistic assumptions to simplify your planning:
• The earth is flat: The flat road map doesn’t show the curvature of the earth.
• The roads are flat: The standard road map doesn’t show hills and valleys.
Instead of a map, you could use a globe that shows all the topographical features 
between Seattle and San Francisco, but you don’t need those details to plan your trip. 
A map, with its unrealistic assumptions, will suffice because the curvature of the earth 
and the topography of the highways are irrelevant to your trip. Although your analysis 
is based on two unrealistic assumptions, that does not mean your analysis is invalid. 
Similarly, if economic analysis is based on unrealistic assumptions, that doesn’t mean 
the analysis is faulty.
What if you decide to travel by bike instead of by automobile? Now the assump-
tion of flat roads really matters, unless of course you are eager to pedal up and down 
mountains. If you use a standard map, and thus assume there are no mountains 
between the two cities, you may inadvertently pick a mountainous route instead of 
a flat one. In this case, the simplifying assumption makes a difference. The lesson 
is that we must think carefully about whether a simplifying assumption is truly 
harmless.
Isolate Variables—Ceteris Paribus
Economic analysis often involves variables and how they affect one another. A ­variable 
is a measure of something that can take on different values, for example, your grade point 
average. Economists are interested in exploring relationships between two ­variables—
like the relationship between the price of apples and the quantity of apples consumers 
purchase. Of course, the quantity of apples purchased depends on many other variables, 
including the consumer’s income. To explore the relationship between the quantity and 
price of apples, we must assume that the consumer’s income—and anything else that 
influences apple purchases—doesn’t change during the time period we’re considering.
Alfred Marshall (1842–1924) was a British economist who refined the economic 
model of supply and demand and provided a label for this process.5 He picked one 
variable that affected apple purchases (price) and threw the other variable (income) 
into what he called the “pound” (in Marshall’s time, the “pound” was an enclosure for 
holding stray cattle; nowadays, a pound is for stray dogs). That variable waited in the 
pound while Marshall examined the influence of the first variable. Marshall labeled the 
pound ceteris paribus, the Latin expression meaning that other variables are held fixed:
. . . the existence of other tendencies is not denied, but their disturbing effect is neglected 
for a time. The more the issue is narrowed, the more exactly can it be handled.
This text contains many statements about the relationship between two variables. 
For example, the quantity of computers produced by Dell depends on the price of com-
puters, the wage of computer workers, and the cost of microchips. When we say, “An 
increase in the price of computers increases the quantity of computers produced,” we 
are assuming that the other two variables—the wage and the cost of microchips—do not 
change. That is, we apply the ceteris paribus assumption.
Think at the Margin
Economists often consider how a small change in one variable affects another variable 
and what impact that has on people’s decision making. In other words, if circumstances 
change only slightly, how will people respond? A small, one-unit change in value is 
called a marginal change. The key feature of marginal change is that the first variable

Chapter 1 • Introduction: What Is Economics?
changes by only one unit. For example, you might ask, “If I study just one more hour, 
by how much will my exam score increase?” Economists call this process “thinking at 
the margin.” Thinking at the margin is like thinking on the edge. You will encounter 
marginal thinking throughout this text. Here are some other marginal questions:
• If I keep my barber shop open one more hour, by how much will my revenue 
increase?
• If I stay in school and earn another degree, by how much will my lifetime earn-
ings increase?
• If a car dealer hires one more sales associate, how many more cars will the dealer 
sell?
As we’ll see in the next chapter, economists use the answer to a marginal question 
as a first step in deciding whether to do more or less of something, for example, whether 
to keep your barber shop open one more hour.
Rational People Respond to Incentives
A key assumption of most economic analysis is that people act rationally, meaning they 
act in their own self-interest. Scottish philosopher Adam Smith (1723–1790), who is 
also considered the founder of economics, wrote that he discovered within humankind6
a desire of bettering our condition, a desire which, though generally calm and dispassionate, 
comes with us from the womb, and never leaves us until we go to the grave.
Smith didn’t say people are motivated exclusively by self-interest, but rather that 
self-interest is more powerful than kindness or altruism. In this text, we will assume 
that people act in their own self-interest. Rational people respond to incentives. When 
the payoff, or benefit, from doing something changes, people change their behavior to 
get the benefit.

Incentives to Buy Hybrid Vehicles
Applying the Concepts #1: How do people respond to incentives?
up to $3,400 per hybrid vehicle. The subsidy was responsible 
for roughly one-fifth of the hybrid vehicles purchased in 2007. 
The increase in the number of hybrid vehicles decreased the 
emission of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide (CO2).
How efficient is the hybrid subsidy in reducing CO2? On 
average, the cost of abating one ton of CO2 through the hybrid 
subsidy is $177. There are less costly ways to reduce CO2 emis-
sions, including building insulation, energy-efficient lighting, 
reforestation, and switching to electric power systems that use 
fuels that generate less CO2. For example, a switch from coal to 
natural gas in power plants reduces CO2 emissions at less than 
one-third the cost associated with the hybrid subsidy.  Related 
to Exercise 3.4.

Consider the incentives to buy a hybrid vehicle, which is more 
fuel efficient but more expensive than a gas-powered vehi-
cle. Between 2000 and 2007, the number of hybrid vehicles 
increased from fewer than 10,000 vehicles to more than 340,000 
vehicles. Over this period, the price of gasoline increased sig-
nificantly, and the higher price of gasoline was responsible for 
roughly one-third of the hybrid vehicles purchased in 2007. An 
additional factor in hybrid purchases was a federal subsidy of

Example: London Addresses Its Congestion Problem
To illustrate the economic way of thinking, let’s consider again how an economist 
would approach the problem of traffic congestion. Recall that each driver on the high-
way slows down other drivers but ignores these time costs when deciding whether to 
use the highway. If the government imposes a congestion tax to reduce traffic during 
rush hour, the economist is faced with a question: How high should the tax be?
To determine the appropriate congestion tax, an economist would assume that 
people respond to incentives and use the three other elements of the economic way 
of thinking:
• Use assumptions to simplify. To simplify the problem, we would assume that 
every car has the same effect on the travel time of other cars. Of course, this is 
unrealistic because people drive cars of different sizes in different ways. But the 
alternative—looking at the effects of each car on travel speeds—would needlessly 
complicate the analysis.
• Isolate variables—use ceteris paribus. To focus attention on the effects of a 
congestion tax on the number of cars using the highway, we would make the 
ceteris paribus assumption that everything else that affects travel behavior—the 
price of gasoline, bus fares, and consumer income—remains fixed.
• Think at the margin. To think at the margin, we would estimate the effects 
of adding one more car to the highway. Now consider the marginal question: If 
we add one more car to the highway, by how much does the total travel time for 
commuters increase? Once we answer this question, we can determine the cost 
imposed by the marginal driver. If the marginal driver forces each of the 900 
commuters to spend two extra seconds on the highway, total travel time increases 
by 30 minutes. If the value of time is, say, $16 per hour, the appropriate conges-
tion tax would be $8 (equal to $16 * 1/2 hour).
As an illustration of the role of prices in an economy, consider 
the experience of Cuba without housing prices. In 1960, the 
government confiscated most housing and outlawed its sale 
and rental. Tenants who paid monthly rent to the government

for 20 years became homeowners of sorts—they officially 
owned the dwelling, but could not sell it or rent it to others. 
The impossibility of resale and rental meant that homeowners 
had less incentive to repair and maintain their property. As a 
result, a large fraction of the housing stock is in mediocre or 
poor condition (30 percent in 2013). In addition, few new dwell-
ings were built in the last 50 years, leading to a large housing 
deficit (roughly 1 million dwellings in 2013).
Housing reforms in 2011 restored prices to the Cuban 
housing market. The reforms authorize the sale and purchase 
of homes for Cuban citizens at prices chosen by sellers and 
buyers. Economists expect these reforms to provide homeown-
ers with greater incentives to repair and maintain their dwellings, 
and to increase housing construction.  Related to Exercise 3.5.

Chapter 1 • Introduction: What Is Economics?
If the idea of charging people for using roads seems odd, consider the city of 
London, which for decades had experienced the worst congestion in Europe. In 
February 2003, the city imposed an $8 tax per day to drive in the city between 
7:00 a.m. and 6:30 p.m. The tax reduced traffic volume and cut travel times for cars 
and buses in half. Because the tax reduced the waste and inefficiency of congestion, 
the city’s economy thrived. Given the success of London’s ongoing congestion tax, 
other cities, including Toronto, Singapore, and San Diego, have implemented con-
gestion pricing.
Preview of Coming Attractions: Macroeconomics
The field of economics is divided into two categories: macroeconomics and micro-
economics. Macroeconomics is the study of the nation’s economy as a whole; it 
focuses on the issues of inflation (a general rise in prices), unemployment, and eco-
nomic growth. These issues are regularly discussed on Web sites, in newspapers, 
and on television. Macroeconomics explains why economies grow and change and 
why economic growth is sometimes interrupted. Let’s look at three ways we can use 
macroeconomics.
Using Macroeconomics to Understand Why Economies Grow
As we discussed earlier in the chapter, the world economy has been growing in recent 
decades, with per capita income increasing by about 1.5 percent per year. Increases in 
income translate into a higher standard of living for consumers—better cars, houses, 
and clothing and more options for food, entertainment, and travel. People in a growing 
economy can consume more of all goods and services because the economy has more 
of the resources needed to produce these products. Macroeconomics explains why 
resources increase over time and the consequences for our standard of living. Let’s look 
at a practical question about economic growth.
Why do some countries grow much faster than others? Between 1960 and 2001, 
the economic growth rate was 2.2 percent per year in the United States, compared to 
2.3 percent in Mexico and 2.7 percent in France. But in some countries, the economy 
actually shrunk, and per capita income dropped. Among the countries with declining 
income were Sierra Leone and Haiti. In the fastest-growing countries, citizens save 
a large fraction of the money they earn. Firms can then borrow the funds saved to 
purchase machinery and equipment that make their workers more productive. The 
fastest-growing countries also have well-educated workforces, allowing firms to quickly 
adopt new technologies that increase worker productivity.
Using Macroeconomics to Understand Economic Fluctuations
All economies, including those that experience a general trend of rising per cap-
ita income, are subject to economic fluctuations, including periods when the 
economy temporarily shrinks. During an economic downturn, some of the econ-
omy’s resources—natural resources, labor, physical capital, human capital, and 
entrepreneurship—are idle. Some workers are unemployed, and some factories and 
stores are closed. By contrast, sometimes the economy grows too rapidly, causing 
prices to rise. Macroeconomics helps us understand why these fluctuations occur—
why the economy sometimes cools and sometimes overheats—and what the govern-
ment can do to moderate the fluctuations. Let’s look at a practical question about 
economic fluctuations.
Should Congress and the president do something to reduce the unemployment 
rate? For example, should the government cut taxes to free up income to spend on con-
sumer goods, thus encouraging firms to hire more workers to produce more output? 
If unemployment is very high, the government may want to reduce it. However, it is

important not to reduce the unemployment rate too much because, as we’ll see later in 
the book, a low unemployment rate will cause inflation.
Using Macroeconomics to Make Informed Business Decisions
A third reason for studying macroeconomics is to make informed business decisions. 
As we’ll see later in the book, the government uses various policies to influence inter-
est rates (the price of borrowing money) and the inflation rate. A manager who intends 
to borrow money for a new factory or store could use knowledge of macroeconomics 
to predict the effects of current public policies on interest rates and then decide 
whether to borrow the money now or later. Similarly, a manager must keep an eye 
on the inflation rate to help decide how much to charge for the firm’s products and 
how much to pay workers. A manager who studies macroeconomics will be better 
equipped to understand the complexities of interest rates and inflation and how they 
affect the firm.
Preview of Coming Attractions: Microeconomics
Microeconomics is the study of the choices made by households (an individual or a 
group of people living together), firms, and government and how these choices affect 
the markets for goods and services. Let’s look at three ways we can use microeconomic 
analysis.
Using Microeconomics to Understand Markets 
and Predict Changes
One reason for studying microeconomics is to better understand how markets work 
and to predict how various events affect the prices and quantities of products in 
markets. In this text, we answer many practical questions about markets and how 
they operate. Let’s look at a practical question that can be answered with some simple 
economic analysis.
How would a tax on beer affect the number of highway deaths among young 
adults? Research has shown that the number of highway fatalities among young adults 
is roughly proportional to the total amount of beer consumed by that group. A tax 
on beer would make the product more expensive, and young adults, like other beer 
drinkers, would therefore consume less of it. Consequently, a tax that decreases beer 
consumption by 10 percent will decrease highway deaths among young adults by about 
10 percent, too.
Using Microeconomics to Make Personal and Managerial 
Decisions
On the personal level, we use economic analysis to decide how to spend our time, what 
career to pursue, and how to spend and save the money we earn. Managers use eco-
nomic analysis to decide how to produce goods and services, how much to produce, and 
how much to charge for them. Let’s use some economic analysis to look at a practical 
question confronting someone considering starting a business.
If the existing coffee shops in your city are profitable and you have enough money 
to start your own shop, should you do it? If you enter this market, the competition 
among the shops for consumers will heat up, causing some coffee shops to drop their 
prices. In addition, your costs may be higher than the costs of the stores that are already 
established. It would be sensible to enter the market only if you expect a small drop in 
price and a small difference in costs. Indeed, entering what appears to be a lucrative 
market may turn out to be a financial disaster.

how these choices affect the markets for

Using Microeconomics to Evaluate Public Policies
Although modern societies use markets to make most of the decisions about produc-
tion and consumption, the government does fulfill several important roles. We can 
use economic analysis to determine how well the government performs its roles in the 
market economy. We can also explore the trade-offs associated with various public 
policies. Let’s look at a practical question about public policy.
Like other innovations, prescription drugs are protected by government patents, 
giving the developer the exclusive right to sell a new drug for a fixed period of time. 
Once the patent expires, other pharmaceutical companies can legally produce and sell 
generic versions of the drug, which causes its price to drop. Should drug patents be 
shorter? Shortening the patent has trade-offs. The good news is that generic versions 
of the drug will be available sooner, so prices will drop sooner and more people will 
use the drug to improve their health. The bad news is that the financial payoff from 
developing new drugs will be smaller, so pharmaceutical companies won’t develop as 
many new drugs. The question is whether the benefit of shorter patents (lower prices) 
exceeds the cost (fewer drugs developed).
Economics is about making 
choices when options are 
limited. Options in an econ-
omy are limited because the 
factors of production are lim-
ited. We can use economic 
analysis to understand 
the consequences of our 
choices as individuals, organizations, and society as a whole. Here 
are the main points of the chapter:
1.	 Most of modern economics is based on positive analysis, which 
answers the question “What is?” or “What will be?” Economists 
contribute to policy debates by conducting positive analyses 
about the consequences of alternative actions.
2.	 Normative analysis answers the question “What ought to be?”
3.	 The choices made by individuals, firms, and governments answer 
three questions: What products do we produce? How do we 
produce the products? Who consumes the products?
4.	 To think like an economist, we (a) use assumptions to simplify, 
(b) use the notion of ceteris paribus to focus on the relation-
ship between two variables, (c) think in marginal terms, and 
(d) assume that rational people respond to incentives.
5.	 We use macroeconomics to understand why economies grow, 
to understand economic fluctuations, and to make informed 
business decisions.
6.	 We use microeconomics to understand how markets work, to 
make personal and managerial decisions, and to evaluate the 
merits of public policies.

Appendix
Using Graphs and Percentages
Economists use several types of graphs to present data, represent relationships between 
variables, and explain concepts. In this appendix, we review the mechanics of graph-
ing variables. We also review the basics of computing percentage changes and using 
percentages to compute changes in variables.
1A.1  Using Graphs
A quick flip through the book will reveal the importance of graphs in economics. Every 
chapter has at least several graphs, and many chapters have more. Although it is possible 
to do economics without graphs, it’s a lot easier with them in your toolbox.
Graphing Single Variables
As we saw earlier in this chapter, a variable is a measure of something that can take 
on different values. Figure 1A.1 shows two types of graphs, each presenting data on 
a single variable. Panel A uses a pie graph to show the breakdown of U.S. music 
sales by type of music. The greater the sales of a type of music, the larger the pie 
slice. For example, the most popular type is rock music, comprising 24 percent of the 
market. The next largest type is country, followed by rap/hip-hop, R&B/urban, and 
so on. Panel B of Figure 1A.1 uses a bar graph to show the revenue from foreign sales 
(exports) of selected U.S. industries. The larger the revenue, the taller the bar. For 
example, the bar for computer software, with export sales of about $60 billion, is over 
three times taller than the bar for motion pictures, TV, and video, with export sales 
of $17 billion.

A third type of single-variable graph shows how the value of a variable changes 
over time. Panel A of Figure 1A.2 shows a time-series graph, with the total dollar value 
of a hypothetical industry for years 1 through 10. Time is measured on the horizontal 
axis, and sales are measured on the vertical axis. The height of the line in a particular 
year shows the value in that year. For example, in Year 1 the value was $12.32 billion. 
After reaching a peak of $14.59 billion in Year 5, the value dropped over the next 
several years.

Panel B of Figure 1A.2 shows a truncated version of the graph in Panel A. The 
double hash marks in the lower part of the vertical axis indicate that the axis doesn’t 
start from zero. This truncation of the vertical axis exaggerates the fluctuations in 
total sales.
Graphing Two Variables
We can also use a graph to show the relationship between two variables. Figure 1A.3 
shows the basic elements of a two-variable graph. One variable is measured along the 
horizontal, or x, axis, while the other variable is measured along the vertical, or y, 
axis. The origin is the intersection of the two axes, where the values of both variables 
are zero. Dashed lines show the values of the two variables at a particular point. For 
example, for point a, the value of the horizontal, or x, variable is 10, and the value of 
the vertical, or y, variable is 13.

One variable is measured along the horizontal, or x, axis, while the other variable is measured along the 
vertical, or y, axis. The origin is defined as the intersection of the two axes, where the values of both 
variables are zero. The dashed lines show the values of the two variables at a particular point.
To see how to draw a two-variable graph, suppose that you have a part-time job 
and you are interested in the relationship between the number of hours you work and 
your weekly income. The relevant variables are the hours of work per week and your 
weekly income. In Figure 1A.4, the table shows the relationship between the hours 
worked and income. Let’s assume that your weekly allowance from your parents is $40 
and your part-time job pays $8 per hour. If you work 10 hours per week, for example, 
your weekly income is $120 ($40 from your parents and $80 from your job). The more 
you work, the higher your weekly income: If you work 20 hours, your weekly income 
is $200; if you work 30 hours, it is $280.

Although a table with numbers is helpful in showing the relationship between work 
hours and income, a graph makes it easier to see the relationship. We can use data in 
a table to draw a graph. To do so, we perform five simple steps:
1	 Draw a horizontal line to represent the first variable. In Figure 1A.4, we 
measure  hours worked along the horizontal axis. As we move to the right 
along the horizontal axis, the number of hours worked increases, from 0 to 30 
hours.
2	 Draw a vertical line intersecting the first line to represent the second variable. In 
Figure 1A.4, we measure income along the vertical axis. As we move up along the 
vertical axis, income increases from $0 to $280.
3	 Start with the first row of numbers in the table, which shows that with 0 hours 
worked, income is $40. The value of the variable on the horizontal axis is 0, and 
the value of the variable on the vertical axis is $40, so we plot point a on the 
graph. This is the vertical intercept—the point where the curve cuts or intersects 
the vertical axis.
4	 Pick a combination with a positive number for hours worked. For example, in the 
second row of numbers, if you work 10 hours, your income is $120.
4.1	Find the point on the horizontal axis with that number of hours worked— 
10 hours—and draw a dashed line vertically straight up from that point.
4.2	Find the point on the vertical axis with the income corresponding to those 
hours worked—$120—and draw a dashed line horizontally straight to the right 
from that point.
4.3	The intersection of the dashed lines shows the combination of hours worked 
and income. Point b shows the combination of 10 hours worked and $120 in 
income.
5	 Repeat step 4 for different combinations of work time and income shown in the 
table. Once we have a series of points on the graph (a, b, c, and d), we can con-
nect them to draw a curve that shows the relationship between hours worked and 
income.
▲  Figure 1A.4  Relationship between Hours Worked and Income
There is a positive relationship between work hours and income, so the income curve is positively sloped. 
The slope of the curve is $8: Each additional hour of work increases income by $8.

There is a positive relationship between two variables if they move in the same 
direction. As you increase your work time, your income increases, so there is a positive 
relationship between the two variables. In Figure 1A.4, as the number of hours worked 
increases, you move upward along the curve to higher income levels. Some people refer 
to a positive relationship as a direct relationship.
There is a negative relationship between two variables if they move in opposite 
directions. For example, there is a negative relationship between the amount of 
time you work and the time you have available for other activities such as recre-
ation, study, and sleep. Some people refer to a negative relationship as an inverse 
relationship.
Computing the Slope
How sensitive is one variable to changes in the other variable? We can use the slope 
of the curve to measure this sensitivity. To compute the slope of a curve, we pick 
two points and divide the vertical difference between the two points (the rise) by the 
horizontal difference (the run):
Slope =
Vertical difference between two points
Horizontal difference between two points = rise
run
To compute the slope of a curve, we take four steps:
1	 Pick two points on the curve, for example, points b and c in Figure 1A.4.
2	 Compute the vertical difference between the two points (the rise). For points b and 
c, the vertical difference between the points is $80 ($200 - $120).
3	 Compute the horizontal distance between the same two points (the run). For 
points b and c, the horizontal distance between the points is 10 hours (20 hours -
10 hours).
4	 Divide the vertical distance by the horizontal distance to get the slope. The slope 
between points b and c is $8 per hour:
Slope =
Vertical difference
Horizontal difference = $200 - 120
20 - 10
= $80
10
= $8
In this case, a 10-hour increase in time worked increases income by $80, so the 
increase in income per hour of work is $8, which makes sense because this is the 
hourly wage. Because the curve is a straight line, the slope is the same at all points 
along the curve. You can check this yourself by computing the slope between points 
c and d.
We can use some shorthand to refer to the slope of a curve. The mathematical 
symbol ∆ (delta) represents the change in a variable. So we can write the slope of the 
curve in Figure 1A.4 as
Slope =
∆ Income
∆ Work hours
In general, if the variable on the vertical axis is y and the variable on the horizontal axis 
is x, we can express the slope as
	
Slope =
∆y
∆x

Moving Along the Curve versus Shifting the Curve
Up to this point, we’ve explored the effect of changes in variables that cause movement 
along a given curve. In Figure 1A.4, we see the relationship between hours of work 
(on the horizontal axis) and income (on the vertical axis). Because the total income 
also depends on the allowance and the wage, we can make two observations about the 
curve in Figure 1A.4:
1	 To draw this curve, we must specify the weekly allowance ($40) and the hourly 
wage ($8).
2	 The curve shows that an increase in time worked increases the student’s income, 
ceteris paribus. In this case, we are assuming that the allowance and the wage are 
both fixed.
A change in the weekly allowance will shift the curve showing the relationship 
between work time and income. In Figure 1A.5, when the allowance increases from 
$40 to $90, the curve shifts upward by $50. For a given number of work hours, income 
increases by $50. For example, the income associated with 10 hours of work is $170 
(point f), compared to $120 with the original allowance (point b). The upward shift 
also means that to reach a given amount of income, fewer work hours are required. In 
other words, the curve shifts upward and to the left.
▲  Figure 1A.5  Movement Along a Curve versus Shifting the Curve
To draw a curve showing the relationship between hours worked and income, we fix the weekly 
allowance ($40) and the wage ($8 per hour). A change in the hours worked causes movement along 
the curve, for example, from point b to point c. A change in any other variable shifts the entire curve. 
For example, a $50 increase in the allowance (to $90) shifts the entire curve upward by $50.

We can distinguish between movement along a curve and a shift of the entire 
curve. In Figure 1A.5, an increase in the hours worked causes movement along a single 
income curve. For example, if the allowance is $40, we are operating on the lower of 
the two curves, and if the hours worked increases from 10 to 20, we move from point b 
to point c. In contrast, if something other than the hours worked changes, we shift the 
entire curve, as we’ve seen with an increase in the allowance.
This book uses dozens of two-dimensional curves, each of which shows the rela-
tionship between only two variables. A common error is to forget that a single curve 
tells only part of the story. In Figure 1A.5, we needed two curves to explore the effects 

51
of changes in three variables. Here are some simple rules to keep in mind when you 
use two-dimensional graphs:
• A change in one of the variables shown on the graph causes movement along 
the curve. In Figure 1A.5, an increase in work time causes movement along the 
curve from point a to point b, to point c, and so on.
• A change in one of the variables that is not shown on the graph—one of the variables 
held fixed in drawing the curve—shifts the entire curve. In Figure 1A.5, an increase 
in the allowance shifts the entire curve upward.
Graphing Negative Relationships
We can use a graph to show a negative relationship between two variables. Consider 
a consumer who has an annual budget of $360 to spend on CDs at a price of $12 per 
CD and downloaded music at a price of $1 per song. The table in Figure 1A.6 shows 
the relationship between the number of CDs and downloaded songs. A consumer who 
doesn’t buy any CDs has $360 to spend on downloaded songs and can get 360 of them 
at a price of $1 each. A consumer who buys 10 CDs at $12 each has $240 left to spend 
on downloaded songs (point b). Moving down through the table, as the number of CDs 
increases, the number of downloaded songs decreases.

There is a negative relationship between the number of CDs and downloaded songs that a consumer 
can afford with a budget of $360. The slope of the curve is - $12: Each additional CD (at a price of 
$12 each) decreases the number of downloadable songs (at $1 each) by 12 songs.

is a negative relationship between the number of CDs and downloaded songs, so the 
curve is negatively sloped. We can use points b and c to compute the slope of the curve:

The slope is 12 downloaded songs per CD: For each additional CD, the consumer 
sacrifices 12 downloaded songs.
Graphing Nonlinear Relationships
We can also use a graph to show a nonlinear relationship between two variables. 
Panel A of Figure 1A.7 shows the relationship between hours spent studying for an 
exam and the grade on the exam. As study time increases, the grade increases, but at 
a decreasing rate. In other words, each additional hour increases the exam grade by a 
smaller and smaller amount. For example, the second hour of study increases the grade 
by 4 points—from 6 to 10 points—but the ninth hour of study increases the grade by 
only 1 point—from 24 points to 25 points. This is a nonlinear relationship: The slope 
of the curve changes as we move along the curve. In Figure 1A.7, the slope decreases 
as we move to the right along the curve: The slope is 4 points per hour between points 
a and b but only 1 point per hour between points c and d.
Another possibility for a nonlinear curve is that the slope increases as we move 
to the right along the curve. Panel B of Figure 1A.7 shows the relationship between

▲  Figure 1A.7  Nonlinear Relationships
(A) Study time There is a positive and nonlinear relationship between study time and the grade on an 
exam. As study time increases, the exam grade increases at a decreasing rate. For example, the second 
hour of study increased the grade by 4 points (from 6 points to 10 points), but the ninth hour of study 
increases the grade by only 1 point (from 24 points to 25 points).
(B) Production cost There is a positive and nonlinear relationship between the quantity of grain produced 
and total production cost. As the quantity increases, the total cost increases at an increasing rate. For 
example, to increase production from 1 ton to 2 tons, production cost increases by $5 (from $10 to $15) 
but to increase the production from 10 to 11 tons, total cost increases by $25 (from $100 to $125).

53
the amount of grain produced on the horizontal axis and the total cost of production 
on the vertical axis. The slope of the curve increases as the amount of grain increases, 
meaning that production cost increases at an increasing rate. On the lower part of the 
curve, increasing output from 1 ton to 2 tons increases production cost by $5, from $10 
to $15. On the upper part of the curve, increasing output from 10 to 11 tons increases 
production cost by $25, from $100 to $125.

Computing Percentage Changes and Using Equations
Economists often express changes in variables in terms of percentage changes. This 
part of the appendix provides a brief review of the mechanics of computing percentage 
changes. It also reviews some simple rules for solving equations to find missing values.
Computing Percentage Changes
In many cases, the equations that economists use involve percentage changes. In this 
text, we use a simple approach to computing percentage changes: We divide the change 
in the variable by the initial value of the variable and then multiply by 100:
Percentage change = New value - initial value
Initial value
* 100
For example, if the price of a book increases from $20 to $22, the percentage change 
is 10 percent:
Percentage change = 22 - 20
20
* 100 = 2
20 * 100 = 10%
Going in the other direction, suppose the price decreases from $20 to $19. In this 
case, the percentage change is -5 percent:
Percentage change = 19 - 20
20
* 100 = - 1
20 * 100 = -5%
The alternative to this simple approach is to base the percentage change on the 
average value, or the midpoint, of the variable:
Percentage change = New value - initial value
Average value
* 100
For example, if the price of a book increases from $20 to $22, the computed percentage 
change under the midpoint approach is 9.52 percent:
 Percentage change =
22 - 20
(20 + 22) , 2 * 100 =
2
42 , 2 * 100 
 = 2
21 * 100 = 9.52%,
If the change in the variable is relatively small, the extra precision associated with 
the midpoint approach is usually not worth the extra effort. The simple approach allows 
us to spend less time doing tedious arithmetic and more time doing economic analysis. 
In this text, we use the simple approach to compute percentage changes: If the price 
increases from $20 to $22, the price has increased by 10 percent.
If we know a percentage change, we can translate it into an absolute change. For 
example, if a price has increased by 10 percent and the initial price is $20, then we add 
10 percent of the initial price ($2 is 10 percent of $20) to the initial price ($20), for 
a new price of $22. If the price decreases by 5 percent, we subtract 5 percent of the 
initial price ($1 is 5 percent of $20) from the initial price ($20), for a new price of $19.

In the 1970s the government of Mexico City repainted the high-
way lane lines on the Viaducto to transform a four-lane high-
way into a six-lane highway. The government announced that 
the highway capacity had increased by 50 percent (equal to 
2 divided by 4). Unfortunately, the number of collisions and 
traffic fatalities increased, and one year later, the government 
A p p l i c a t i o n  3
The Perils of Percentages
Applying the Concepts #3: How do we compute percentage changes?
restored the four-lane highway and announced that the capac-
ity had decreased by 33 percent (equal to 2 divided by 6). The 
government announced that the net effect of the two changes 
was an increase in the highway capacity by 17 percent (equal 
to 50 percent minus 33 percent).
This anecdote reveals a potential problem with using the 
simple approach to compute percentage changes. Because 
the initial value (the denominator) changes, the computation 
of percentage increases and decreases are not symmetric. In 
contrast, if the government had used the midpoint method, the 
percentage increase in capacity would be 40 percent (equal to 
2 divided by 5), the same as the percentage decrease. In that 
case, we get the more sensible result that the net effect of the 
two changes is zero.  Related to Exercise A8.

Using Equations to Compute Missing Values
It will often be useful to compute the value of the numerator or the denominator of an 
equation. To do so, we use simple algebra to rearrange the equation to put the missing 
variable on the left side of the equation. For example, consider the relationship between 
time worked and income. The equation for the slope is
Slope =
∆ Income
∆ Work hours
Suppose you want to compute how much income you’ll earn by working more 
hours. We can rearrange the slope equation by multiplying both sides of the equation 
by the change in work hours:
Work hours * Slope = ∆ Income
By swapping sides of the equation, we get
∆ Income = ∆ Work hours * Slope
For example, if you work seven extra hours and the slope is $8, your income will 
increase by $56:
∆ Income = ∆ Work hours * Slope = $7 * $8 = $56
We can use the same process to compute the difference in work time required to 
achieve a target change in income. In this case, we multiply both sides of the slope equa-
tion by the change in work time and then divide both sides by the slope. The result is
∆ Work hours = ∆ Income
Slope
For example, to increase your income by $56, you need to work seven hours:
	
∆ Work hours = ∆ Income
Slope
= $56
$8 = 7

What do we sacrifice by 
preserving tropical rainforests 
rather than mining or logging 
the land?
Recent experiences in Guyana and other tropical 
countries suggest that in some places, the answer is 
“not much”—only $1 per hectare per year ($0.40 per 
acre per year).1 Conservation groups have a new 
strategy for conserving rainforests—bidding against 
loggers and miners for the use of the land. When the 
payoff from developing tropical forest land is rela-
tively low, conservation groups can outbid develop-
ers at a price as low as $1 per hectare. When we add the cost of hiring locals to manage the ecosystems, the 
total cost of preservation is as low as $2 per hectare per year. A conservation group based in Amherst, New 
Hampshire, started by leasing 81,000 hectares of pristine forest in Guyana, and since then has leased land in 
Peru, Sierra Leone, Papua New Guinea, Fiji, and Mexico.

n this chapter, we introduce five key principles that provide a foundation for eco-
nomic analysis. A principle is a self-evident truth that most people readily understand 
and accept. For example, most people readily accept the principle of gravity. As you 
read through the book, you will see the five key principles of economics again and again 
as you do your own economic analysis.
The Principle of Opportunity Cost
Economics is all about making choices, and to make good choices we must compare 
the benefit of something to its cost. Opportunity cost incorporates the notion of 
scarcity: No matter what we do, there is always a trade-off. We must trade off one thing 
for another because resources are limited and can be used in different ways. By acquir-
ing something, we use up resources that could have been used to acquire something 
else. The notion of opportunity cost allows us to measure this trade-off.
Learning Objective 2.1
Apply the principle of opportunity cost.
opportunity cost
What you sacrifice to get something.
P r i n c i p l e  O f  O p p o r t u n i t y  C o s t
The opportunity cost of something is what you sacrifice to get it.
In most decisions we choose from several alternatives. For example, if you spend an 
hour studying for an economics exam, you have one fewer hour to pursue other activi-
ties. To determine the opportunity cost of an activity, we look at what you consider 
the best of these “other” activities. For example, suppose the alternatives to studying 
economics are studying for a history exam or working in a job that pays $10 per hour. 
If you consider studying for history a better use of your time than working, then the 
opportunity cost of studying economics is the four extra points you could have received 
on a history exam if you studied history instead of economics. Alternatively, if working 
is the best alternative, the opportunity cost of studying economics is the $10 you could 
have earned instead.
We can also apply the principle of opportunity cost to decisions about how to 
spend money from a fixed budget. For example, suppose that you have a fixed budget 
to spend on music. You can buy your music either at a local music store for $15 per 
CD or online for $1 per song. The opportunity cost of 1 CD is 15 one-dollar online 
songs. A hospital with a fixed salary budget can increase the number of doctors only at 
the expense of nurses or physician’s assistants. If a doctor costs five times as much as a 
nurse, the opportunity cost of a doctor is five nurses.
In some cases, a product that appears to be free actually has a cost. That’s why 
economists are fond of saying, “There’s no such thing as a free lunch.” Suppose some-
one offers to buy you lunch if you agree to listen to a sales pitch for a timeshare con-
dominium. Although you don’t pay any money for the lunch, there is an opportunity 
cost because you could spend that time in another way—such as studying for your 
economics or history exam. The lunch isn’t free because you sacrifice an hour of your 
time to get it.
The Cost of College
What is the opportunity cost of a college degree? Consider a student who spends a total 
of $40,000 for tuition and books. Instead of going to college, the student could have 
spent this money on a wide variety of goods, including housing, electronic devices, and 
world travel. Part of the opportunity cost of college is the $40,000 worth of other goods 
the student sacrifices to pay for tuition and books. Also, instead of going to college, the 
student could have worked as a bank clerk for $20,000 per year and earned $80,000 

59
Chapter 2 • The Key Principles of Economics
over four years. That makes the total opportunity cost of this student’s college degree 
$120,000:
Opportunity cost of money spent on tuition and books
$ 40,000
Opportunity cost of college time (four years working for $20,000 per year)
  80,000
Economic cost or total opportunity cost
$120,000
We haven’t included the costs of food or housing in our computations of oppor-
tunity cost. That’s because a student must eat and live somewhere even if he or she 
doesn’t go to college. But if housing and food are more expensive in college, then we 
would include the extra costs of housing and food in our calculations.
There are other things to consider in a person’s decision to attend college. As we’ll 
see later, a college degree can increase a person’s earning power, so there are benefits 
from a college degree. In addition, college offers the thrill of learning and the pleasure 
of meeting new people. To make an informed decision about whether to attend college, 
we must compare the benefits to the opportunity costs.
The Cost of Military Spending
We can use the principle of opportunity cost to explore the cost of military spending.2 
In 1992, Malaysia bought two warships. For the price of the warships, the country could 
have built a system to provide safe drinking water for 5 million citizens who lacked 
it. In other words, the opportunity cost of the warships was safe drinking water for 
5 ­million people. The policy question is whether the benefits of the warships exceed 
their opportunity cost.
In the United States, economists estimated that the cost of the war in Iraq will be 
at least $1 trillion. The economists’ calculations go beyond the simple budgetary costs 
and quantify the opportunity cost of the war. For example, the resources used in the war 
could have been used in various government programs for children—to enroll more 
children in preschool programs, to hire more science and math teachers to reduce class 
sizes, or to immunize more children in poor countries. For example, each $100 billion 
spent on the war could instead support one of the following programs:
• Enroll 13 million preschool children in the Head Start program for one year.
• Hire 1.8 million additional teachers for one year.
• Immunize all the children in less-developed countries for the next 33 years.
The fact that a war has a large opportunity cost does not necessarily mean that it 
is unwise. A policy question is whether the benefits from a war exceed its opportunity 
cost. Taking another perspective, we can measure the opportunity cost of war in terms 
of its implications for domestic security. The resources used in the war in Iraq could 
have been used to improve domestic security by securing ports and cargo facilities, 
hiring more police officers, improving the screening of airline passengers and baggage, 
improving fire departments and other first responders, upgrading the Coast Guard 
fleet, and securing our railroad and highway systems. The cost of implementing the 
domestic-security recommendations of various government commissions would be 
about $31 billion, a small fraction of the cost of the war. The question for policymak-
ers is whether money spent on domestic security would be more beneficial than money 
spent on the war.
Opportunity Cost and the Production Possibilities Curve
Just as individuals face limits, so do entire economies. As we saw in Chapter 1, the 
ability of an economy to produce goods and services is determined by its factors of 
production, including labor, natural resources, physical capital, human capital, and 
entrepreneurship.
 

part 1

Figure 2.1 shows a production possibilities graph for an economy that produces 
wheat and steel. The horizontal axis shows the quantity of wheat produced by the 
economy, and the vertical axis shows the quantity of steel produced. The shaded area 
shows all the possible combinations of the two goods the economy can produce. At 
point a, for example, the economy can produce 700 tons of steel and 10 tons of wheat. 
In contrast, at point e, the economy can produce 300 tons of steel and 20 tons of wheat. 
The set of points on the border between the shaded and unshaded area is called the 
production possibilities curve (or production possibilities frontier) because it separates 
the combinations that are attainable from those that are not. The attainable combina-
tions are shown by the shaded area within the curve and the curve itself. The unat-
tainable combinations are shown by the unshaded area outside the curve. The points 
on the curve show the combinations that are possible if the economy’s resources are 
fully employed.

combinations of products that an 
economy can produce, given that its

▲  Figure 2.1  Scarcity and the Production Possibilities Curve
The production possibilities curve illustrates the principle of opportunity cost for an entire economy. 
An economy has a fixed amount of resources. If these resources are fully employed, an increase in the 
production of wheat comes at the expense of steel.

The production possibilities curve illustrates the notion of opportunity cost. If an 
economy is fully utilizing its resources, it can produce more of one product only if it 
produces less of another product. For example, to produce more wheat, we must take 
resources away from steel. As we move resources out of steel, the quantity of steel pro-
duced will decrease. For example, if we move from point a to point b along the production 
possibilities curve in Figure 2.1, we sacrifice 50 tons of steel (700 tons - 650 tons) to get 
10 more tons of wheat (20 tons - 10 tons). Further down the curve, if we move from 
point c to point d, we sacrifice 180 tons of steel to get the same 10-ton increase in wheat.
Why is the production possibilities curve bowed outward, with the opportunity 
cost of wheat increasing as we move down the curve? The reason is that resources are 
not perfectly adaptable for the production of both goods. Some resources are more suit-
able for steel production, while others are more suitable for wheat production. Starting 
at point a, the economy uses its most fertile land to produce wheat. A 10-ton increase 
in wheat reduces the quantity of steel by only 50 tons because plenty of fertile land is 
available for conversion to wheat farming. As the economy moves downward along the 
production possibilities curve, farmers will be forced to use land that is progressively 
less fertile, so to increase wheat output by 10 tons, more and more resources must be 

61
Chapter 2 • The Key Principles of Economics
diverted from steel production. In the move from point c to point d, the land converted 
to farming is so poor that increasing wheat output by 10 tons decreases steel output 
by 180 tons.The production possibilities curve shows the production options for a 
given set of resources. As shown in Figure 2.2, an increase in the amount of resources 
available to the economy shifts the production possibilities outward. For example, if 
we start at point f, and the economy’s resources increase, we can produce more steel 
(point g), more wheat (point h), or more of both goods (points between g and h). The 
curve will also shift outward as a result of technological innovations that enable us to 
produce more output with a given quantity of resources.
▲  Figure 2.2  Shifting the Production Possibilities Curve
An increase in the quantity of resources or technological innovation in an economy shifts the production 
possibilities curve outward. Starting from point f, a nation could produce more steel (point g), more 
wheat (point h), or more of both goods (points between g and h).

Don’t Forget the Costs of Time and Invested Funds
Applying the Concepts #1: What is the opportunity cost of running a business?
you could work as a janitor for $300 per week. You have a 
­savings account that pays a weekly interest rate of 0.20 per-
cent (or $0.002 per dollar). What is your weekly cost of cutting 
lawns?
We can use the principle of opportunity cost to compute the 
cost of the lawn business. The opportunity cost of the $5,000 
you have invested in the business is the $10 weekly interest you 
could have earned by selling the equipment and investing the 
$5,000 in your savings account. Adding in the opportunity cost 
of cutting lawns instead of earning $300 as a janitor, the weekly 
cost is $310.  Related to Exercise 1.7.
Suppose you run a lawn-cutting business and use solar-­
powered equipment (mower, edger, blower, truck) that you 
could sell tomorrow for $5,000. Instead of cutting lawns,

The Marginal Principle
Economics is about making choices, and we rarely make all-or-nothing choices. For 
example, if you sit down to read a book, you don’t read the entire book in a single 
sitting, but instead decide how many pages or chapters to read. Economists think in 
marginal terms, considering how a one-unit change in one variable affects the value of 
another variable and people’s decisions. When we say marginal, we’re looking at the 
effect of a small, or incremental, change.
The marginal principle is based on a comparison of the marginal benefits and mar-
ginal costs of a particular activity. The marginal benefit of an activity is the additional 
benefit resulting from a small increase in the activity. For example, the marginal benefit 
of keeping a bookstore open for one more hour equals the additional revenue from 
book sales. Similarly, the marginal cost is the additional cost resulting from a small 
increase in the activity. For example, the marginal cost of keeping a bookstore open for 
one more hour equals the additional expenses for workers and utilities for that hour. 
Applying the marginal principle, the bookstore should stay open for one more hour if 
the marginal benefit (the additional revenue) is at least as large as the marginal cost (the 
additional cost). For example, if the marginal benefit is $80 of additional revenue and 
the marginal cost is $30 of additional expense for workers and utilities, staying open 
for the additional hour increases the bookstore’s profit by $50.
Learning Objective 2.2
Apply the marginal principle.
marginal benefit
The additional benefit resulting from a 
small increase in some activity.
marginal cost
The additional cost resulting from a small 
increase in some activity.
M a r g i n a l  P r i n c i p l e
Increase the level of an activity as long as its marginal benefit 
exceeds its marginal cost. Choose the level at which the marginal 
benefit equals the marginal cost.
Thinking at the margin enables us to fine-tune our decisions. We can use the 
marginal principle to determine whether a one-unit increase in a variable would make 
us better off. Just as a bookstore owner could decide whether to stay open for one more 
hour, you could decide whether to study one more hour for a psychology midterm. 
When we reach the level where the marginal benefit equals the marginal cost, we can-
not do any better, and the fine-tuning is done.
How Many Movie Sequels?
To illustrate the marginal principle, let’s consider movie sequels. When a movie is suc-
cessful, its producer naturally thinks about doing another movie, continuing the story 
line with the same set of characters. If the first sequel is successful too, the producer 
thinks about producing a second sequel, then a third, and so on. We can use the mar-
ginal principle to explore the decision of how many movies to produce.
Figure 2.3 shows the marginal benefits and marginal costs for movies. On the 
benefit side, a movie sequel typically generates about 30 percent less revenue than the 
original movie, and revenue continues to drop for additional movies. In the second 
column of the table, the first movie generates $300 million in revenue, the second gen-
erates $210 million, and the third generates $135 million. This is shown in the graph as 
a negatively sloped marginal-benefit curve, with the marginal benefit decreasing from 
$300 for the first movie (point a), to $210 (point b), and then to $135 (point c). On the 
cost side, the typical movie in the United States costs about $50 million to produce 
and about $75 million to promote.3 In the third column of the table, the cost of the 
first movie (the original) is $125 million. In the graph, this is shown as point d on the 
marginal-cost curve. The marginal cost increases with the number of movies because 
film stars typically demand higher salaries to appear in sequels. In the table and the 
graph, the marginal cost increases to $150 million for the second movie (point e) and 
to $175 million for the third (point f).

In this example, the first two movies are profitable, but the third is not. For 
the original movie, the marginal benefit ($300 million at point a) exceeds the mar-
ginal cost ($125 million at point d), generating a profit of $175 million. Although 
the second movie has a higher cost and a lower benefit, it is profitable because the 
marginal benefit still exceeds the marginal cost, so the profit on the second movie 
is $60 million ($210 million - $150 million). In contrast, the marginal cost of the 
third movie of $175 million exceeds its marginal benefit of only $135 million, so the 
third movie loses $40 million. In this example, the movie producer should stop after 
the second movie.
Although this example shows that only two movies are profitable, other outcomes 
are possible. If the revenue for the third movie were larger, making the marginal benefit 
greater than the marginal cost, it would be sensible to produce the third movie. Simi-
larly, if the marginal cost of the third movie were lower—if the actors didn’t demand 
such high salaries—the third movie could be profitable. Many movies have had multiple 
sequels, such as Harry Potter and Star Wars. Conversely, many profitable movies, such 
as Wedding Crashers and Groundhog Day, didn’t result in any sequels. In these cases, 
the expected drop-off in revenues and run-up in costs for the second movie were large 
enough to make a sequel unprofitable.
Renting College Facilities
Suppose that your student film society is looking for an auditorium to use for an all-
day Hitchcock film program and is willing to pay up to $200. Your college has a new 
auditorium that has a daily rent of $450, an amount that includes $300 to help pay for 
the cost of building the auditorium, $50 to help pay for insurance, and $100 to cover the 
extra costs of electricity and janitorial services for a one-day event. If your film society 
▲  Figure 2.3  The Marginal Principle and Movie Sequels
The marginal benefit of movies in a series decreases because revenue falls off with each additional movie, 
while the marginal cost increases because actors demand higher salaries. The marginal benefit exceeds 
the marginal cost for the first two movies, so it is sensible to produce two, but not three, movies.

offers to pay $150 for using the auditorium, should the college accept the offer? The 
college could use the marginal principle to make the decision.
To decide whether to accept your group’s offer, the college should determine the 
marginal cost of renting out the auditorium. The marginal cost equals the extra costs 
the college incurs by allowing the student group to use an otherwise vacant auditorium. 
In our example, the extra cost is $100 for additional electricity and janitorial services. 
It would be sensible for the college to rent the auditorium because the marginal ben-
efit ($150 offered by the student group) exceeds the marginal cost ($100). In fact, the 
college should be willing to rent the facility for any amount greater than $100. If the 
students and the college split the difference between the $200 the students are willing 
to pay and the $100 marginal cost, they would agree on a price of $150, leaving both 
parties better off by $50.
Most colleges do not use this sort of logic. Instead, they use complex formulas to 
compute the perceived cost of renting out a facility. In most cases, the perceived cost 
includes some costs that the university bears even if it doesn’t rent out the facility for 
the day. In our example, the facility manager included $300 worth of construction costs 
and $50 worth of insurance, for a total cost of $450 instead of just $100. Because many 
colleges include costs that aren’t affected by the use of a facility, they overestimate the 
actual cost of renting out their facilities, missing opportunities to serve student groups 
and make some money at the same time.
Automobile Emissions Standards
We can use the marginal principle to analyze emissions standards for automobiles. The 
U.S. government specifies how much carbon monoxide a new car is allowed to emit 
per mile. The marginal question is “Should the standard be stricter, with fewer units of 
carbon monoxide allowed?” On the benefit side, a stricter standard reduces health-care 
costs resulting from pollution: If the air is cleaner, people with respiratory ailments 
will make fewer visits to doctors and hospitals, have lower medication costs, and lose 
fewer work days. On the cost side, a stricter standard requires more expensive control 
equipment on cars and may also reduce fuel efficiency. Using the marginal principle, 
the government should make the emissions standard stricter as long as the marginal 
benefit (savings in health-care costs and work time lost) exceeds the marginal cost (the 
cost of additional equipment and extra fuel used).
Driving Speed and Safety
Consider the decision about how fast to drive on a highway. The marginal benefit 
of going one mile per hour faster is the travel time you’ll save. On the cost side, an 
increase in speed increases your chances of colliding with another car, and also increases 
the severity of injuries suffered in a collision. A rational person will pick the speed at 
which the marginal benefit of speed equals the marginal cost.
In the 1960s and 1970s, the federal government required automakers to include a 
number of safety features, including seat belts and collapsible steering columns. These 
new regulations had two puzzling effects. Although deaths from automobile collisions 
decreased, the reduction was much lower than expected. In addition, more bicyclists 
were hit by cars and injured or killed.
We can use the marginal principle to explain why seat belts and other safety fea-
tures made bicycling more hazardous. The mandated safety features decreased the 
marginal cost of speed: People who wear seat belts suffer less severe injuries in a col-
lision, so every additional unit of speed is less costly. Drivers felt more secure because 
they were better insulated from harm in the event of a collision, and so they drove 
faster. As a result, the number of collisions between cars and bicycles increased, mean-
ing that the safer environment for drivers led to a more hazardous environment for 
bicyclists.

self-interest. Self-interested people won’t exchange one thing for another unless the 
trade makes them better off.

per day at 11 knots, compared to 21.4 tons at 12 knots, 27.2 
tons at 13 knots, and 33.9 tons at 14 knots. In other words, 
speed is costly. On the benefit side, an increase in speed means 
that the ship delivers more cargo per year. To decide the best 
speed, the ship operator must find the speed at which the mar-
ginal cost (the increase in fuel cost) equals the marginal ben-
efit (the increase in revenue from delivered cargo). An increase 
in the price of fuel increases the marginal cost of speed, causing 
the shipper to slow the ship.  Related to Exercise 2.4.

Routledge, 2007).

ship. As the ship’s speed increases, fuel consumption increases.

A voluntary exchange between two people makes both people 
better off.
Here are some examples.
• If you voluntarily exchange money for a college education, you must expect 
you’ll be better off with a college education. The college voluntarily provides 
an education in exchange for your money, so the college must be better off, too.
• If you have a job, you voluntarily exchange your time for money, and your 
employer exchanges money for your labor services. Both you and your employer 
are better off as a result.
Exchange and Markets
Adam Smith stressed the importance of voluntary exchange as a distinctly human trait. 
He noticed4
a propensity in human nature . . . to truck, barter, and exchange one thing for another. . . . It 
is common to all men, and to be found in no other . . . animals. . . . Nobody ever saw a dog 
make a fair and deliberate exchange of one bone for another with another dog.
As we saw in Chapter 1, a market is an institution or arrangement that enables 
people to exchange goods and services. If participation in a market is voluntary and 
people are well informed, both people in a transaction—buyer and seller—will be 

part 1
66
better off. The next time you see a market transaction, listen to what people say 
after money changes hands. If both people say “thank you,” that’s the principle of 
voluntary exchange in action: The double “thank you” reveals that both people are 
better off.
The alternative to exchange is self-sufficiency: Each of us could produce every-
thing for him- or herself. As we’ll see in the next chapter, it is more sensible to spe-
cialize, doing what we do best and then buying products from other people, who in 
turn are doing what they do best. For example, if you are good with numbers but an 
awful carpenter, you could specialize in accounting and buy furniture from Woody, 
who could specialize in making furniture and pay someone to do his bookkeeping. 
In general, exchange allows us to take advantage of differences in people’s talents 
and skills.
Online Games and Market Exchange
As another illustration of the power of exchange, consider the virtual world of online 
games. Role-playing games such as World of Warcraft and EverQuest allow thousands 
of people to interact online, moving their characters through a landscape of survival 
challenges. Each player constructs a character—called an avatar—by choosing some 
initial traits for it. The player then navigates the avatar through the game’s challenges, 
where it acquires skills and accumulates assets, including clothing, weapons, armor, and 
even magic spells.
The curious part about these role-playing games is that players use real-life auction 
sites, including eBay and Yahoo! Auctions, to buy products normally acquired in the 
game.5 Byron, who wants a piece of armor for his avatar (say, a Rubicite girdle), can use 
eBay to buy one for $50 from Selma. The two players then enter the online game, and 
Selma’s avatar transfers the armor to Byron’s avatar. It is even possible to buy another 
player’s avatar, with all its skills and assets. Given the time required to acquire various 
objects such as Rubicite girdles in the game and the prices paid for them on eBay, the 
implicit wage earned by the typical online player auctioning them off is $3.42 per hour: 
That’s how much the player could earn by first taking the time to acquire the assets in 
the game and then selling them on eBay.

could whack down all the weeds in just one hour. Since Rory 
is 20 times more productive than the best gardener, should he 
take care of his own weeds?
We can use the principle of voluntary exchange to explain 
why Rory should hire the less productive gardener. Suppose 
Rory earns $1,000 per hour playing golf—either playing in tour-
naments or giving lessons. For Rory, the opportunity cost of 
weed whacking is $1,000—the income he sacrifices by spend-
ing an hour cutting weeds rather than playing golf. If the gar-
dener charges $10 per hour, Rory could hire him to take care of 
the weeds for only $200. By switching one hour of his time from 
weed-whacking to golf, Rory earns $1,000 and incurs a cost of 
only $200, so he is better off by $800. Rory McIlroy specializes 
in what he does best, and then buys goods and services from 
other people.  Related to Exercise 3.5.
Should Rory McIlroy whack his own weeds? The swinging skills 
that make Rory McIlroy one of the world’s best golfers also 
make him a skillful weed whacker. His large estate has a lot of 
weeds, and it would take the best gardener 20 hours to take 
care of all of them. With his powerful and precise swing, Rory

The Principle of Diminishing Returns
Xena has a small copy shop, with one copying machine and one worker. When the 
backlog of orders piled up, she decided to hire a second worker, expecting that doubling 
her workforce would double the output of her copy shop from 500 pages per hour to 
1,000. Xena was surprised when output increased to only 800 pages per hour. If she had 
known about the principle of diminishing returns, she would not have been surprised.
Learning Objective 2.4
Apply the principle of diminishing 
returns.
P r i n c i p l e  o f  D i m i n i s h i n g  R e t u r n s
Suppose output is produced with two or more inputs, and we 
increase one input while holding the other input or inputs fixed. 
Beyond some point—called the point of diminishing returns—output 
will increase at a decreasing rate.
Xena added a worker (one input) while holding the number of copying machines 
(the other input) fixed. Because the two workers must share a single copying machine, 
each worker spent some time waiting for the machine to be available. As a result, adding 
the second worker increased the number of copies, but did not double the output. With 
a single worker and a single copying machine, Xena has already reached the point of 
diminishing returns: As she increases the number of workers, output increases, but at 
a decreasing rate. The first worker increases output by 500 pages (from 0 to 500), but 
the second worker increases output by only 300 pages (from 500 to 800).
This principle of diminishing returns is relevant when we try to produce more 
output in an existing production facility (a factory, a store, an office, or a farm) by 
increasing the number of workers sharing the facility. When we add a worker to the 
facility, each worker becomes less productive because he or she works with a smaller 
piece of the facility: More workers share the same machinery, equipment, and factory 
space. As we pack more and more workers into the factory, total output increases, but 
at a decreasing rate.
It’s important to emphasize that diminishing returns occurs because one of the 
inputs to the production process is fixed. When a firm can vary all its inputs, including 
the size of the production facility, the principle of diminishing returns is not relevant. 
For example, if a firm doubled all its inputs, building a second factory and hiring a 
second workforce, we would expect the total output of the firm to at least double. The 
principle of diminishing returns does not apply when a firm is flexible in choosing all 
its inputs.

output as the other nutrients in the soil are overwhelmed by the 
fertilizer.
Table 2.1 shows the relationship between the amount of 
fertilizer and the corn output. The first 50-pound bag of fertilizer 
increases the crop yield from 85 to 120 bushels per acre, a gain 
of 35 bushels. The next bag of fertilizer increases the yield by 
only 15 bushels (from 120 to 135), followed by a gain of 9 bush-
els (from 135 to 144) and then a gain of only 3 bushels (from 144 
to 147). The farmer experienced diminishing returns because 
the other inputs to the production process are fixed.  Related to 
Exercises 4.5 and 4.6.
The notion of diminishing returns applies to all inputs to the pro-
duction process. For example, one of the inputs in the produc-
tion of corn is nitrogen fertilizer. Suppose a farmer has a fixed 
amount of land (an acre) and must decide how much fertilizer to 
apply. The first 50-pound bag of fertilizer will increase the crop 
yield by a relatively large amount, but the second bag is likely to 
increase the yield by a smaller amount, and the third bag is likely 
to have an even smaller effect. Because the farmer is changing 
just one of the inputs, the output will increase, but at a decreas-
ing rate. Eventually, additional fertilizer will actually decrease

What matters to people is the real value of money or income—its 
purchasing power—not its “face” value.
To illustrate this principle, suppose you work in your college bookstore to earn 
extra money for movies and snacks. If your take-home pay is $10 per hour, is this a high 
wage or a low wage? The answer depends on the prices of the goods you buy. If a movie 
costs $4 and a snack costs $1, with one hour of work you could afford to see two movies 
and buy two snacks. The wage may seem high enough for you. But if a movie costs $8 
and a snack costs $2, an hour of work would buy only one movie and one snack, and 
the same $10 wage doesn’t seem so high. This is the real-nominal principle in action: 
What matters is not how many dollars you earn, but what those dollars will purchase.
Economists use special terms to express the ideas behind the real-nominal principle:
• The nominal value of an amount of money is simply its face value. For example, 
the nominal wage paid by the bookstore is $10 per hour.
• The real value of an amount of money is measured in terms of the quantity of 
goods the money can buy. For example, the real value of your bookstore wage 
would fall as the prices of movies and snacks increase, even though your nominal 
wage stayed the same.

Chapter 2 • The Key Principles of Economics
The real-nominal principle can explain how people choose the amount of money to 
carry around with them. Suppose you typically withdraw $40 per week from an ATM 
to cover your normal expenses. If the prices of all the goods you purchase during the 
week double, you would have to withdraw $80 per week to make the same purchases. 
The amount of money people carry around depends on the prices of the goods and 
services they buy.
The Design of Public Programs
Government officials use the real-nominal principle when they design public programs. 
For example, Social Security payments are increased each year to ensure that the checks 
received by the elderly and other recipients will purchase the same amount of goods and 
services, even if prices have increased. The government also uses this principle when it 
publishes statistics about the economy. For example, its reports about changes in “real 
wages” in the economy over time take into account the prices of the goods workers 
purchase. Therefore, the real wage is stated in terms of its buying power, rather than 
its face value or nominal value.
The Value of the Minimum Wage
Between 1974 and 2015, the federal minimum wage increased from $2.00 to $7.25. 
Was the typical minimum-wage worker better or worse off in 2015? We can apply the 
real-nominal principle to see what’s happened over time to the real value of the federal 
minimum wage.
As shown in the second row of Table 2.2, a full-time worker earning the minimum 
wage earned $80 in 1974 and $290 in 2015. The third row of Table 2.2 shows the cost 
of a standard basket of consumer goods, which includes a standard mix of housing, 
food, clothing, and transportation. In 1974, consumer prices were relatively low, and 
the cost of buying all the goods in the standard basket was only $47. Between 1974 
and 2011, consumer prices increased, and the cost of this standard basket of goods 
increased to $236.
The last row in Table 2.2 shows the purchasing power of the minimum wage. In 1974, 
the $80 in weekly income could buy 1.70 standard baskets of goods. Between 1974 and 
2015, the weekly income more than tripled, but the cost of the standard basket of goods 
more than quadrupled. As a result, the weekly income of $290 in 2011 could buy only 1.23 
baskets of goods. Because prices increased faster than the nominal wage, the real value of 
the minimum wage actually decreased over this period.

Repaying Student Loans
Applying the Concepts #5: How does inflation affect lenders and borrowers?
the $20,000 you owe. However, if all prices double over the 
10-year period, your nominal salary will double to $80,000, and, 
as shown in the second row of Table 2.3, it will take you only 
a quarter of a year to earn $20,000 to repay the loan. In other 
words, a general increase in prices lowers the real cost of your 
loan. In contrast, if all prices decrease and your annual salary 
drops to $20,000, it will take you a full year to earn the money 
to repay the loan. In general, people who owe money prefer 
inflation (a general rise in prices) to deflation (a general drop in 
prices).  Related to Exercises 5.6 and 5.9.
Suppose you finish college with $20,000 in student loans and 
start a job that pays a salary of $40,000 in the first year. In 10 
years, you must repay your college loans. Which would you 
prefer: stable prices, rising prices, or falling prices?
We can use the real-nominal principle to compute the 
real cost of repaying your loans. The first row of Table 2.3 
shows the cost of the loan when all prices in the economy are 
stable—including the price of labor, your salary. In this case, 
your nominal salary in 10 years is $40,000, and the real cost of 
repaying your loan is the half year of work you must do to earn

This chapter covers five key 
principles of economics, the 
simple, self-evident truths that 
most people readily accept. 
If you understand these prin-
ciples, you are ready to read 
the rest of the book, which 
will show you how to do your 
own economic analysis.
1.	 Principle of opportunity cost. The opportunity cost of something 
is what you sacrifice to get it.
2.	 Marginal principle. Increase the level of an activity as long as its 
marginal benefit exceeds its marginal cost. Choose the level at 
which the marginal benefit equals the marginal cost.
3.	 Principle of voluntary exchange. A voluntary exchange between 
two people makes both people better off.
4.	 Principle of diminishing returns. Suppose that output is produced 
with two or more inputs, and we increase one input while holding 
the other inputs fixed. Beyond some point—called the point of 
diminishing returns—output will increase at a decreasing rate.
5.	 Real-nominal principle. What matters to people is the real value 
of money or income—its purchasing power—not the face value 
of money or income.

The Marginal Principle
Apply the marginal principle.
2.1	 A car rental company currently has seven cars in its 
fleet, and its total daily cost is $2,300. If the company 
added an 8th car, its daily cost would be $2,400, or

2.4	 Arrows up or down: The decision about how fast to sail 
a cargo ship is based on the __________ benefit and the 
__________ cost. (Related to Application 2 on page 65.)
2.5	 How Fast to Drive? Suppose Duke is driving to a 
nearby town to attend a dance party, and must decide 
how fast to drive. The marginal benefit of speed is the 
extra dance time he will get by driving faster, and the 
marginal cost is the additional risk of a collision. The 
marginal-benefit curve is negatively sloped, and the 
marginal-cost curve is positively sloped.

chosen speed will change.
2.6	 Highlanders Go Marginal. Suppose that the own-
ers of traditional horse-drawn carriages in the Tatra 
mountains of Poland observed that up to half the 
seats during evening rides through the Chochołowska 
­Valley are empty.  The average cost of an evening ride 
through the valley is 150 Polish zloty, a figure that 
includes fixed costs such as stable fees. A half-full eve-
ning ride generates only 200 Polish zloty of revenue.
a.	 Use the marginal principle to explain why the own-
ers of horse-drawn carriages continued evening 
rides through the valley.
b.	It will be sensible to run a half-empty evening ride if 
the marginal __________ of the ride is __________ 
than __________ Polish zloty.

officer has a budgetary cost of $40,000 per year. The 
property loss from each burglary is $4,000. The first 
officer hired will reduce crime by 40 burglaries, and 
each additional officer will reduce crime by half as 
much as the previous one. How many officers should 
the city hire? Illustrate with a graph with a marginal-
benefit curve and a marginal-cost curve.
2.9	 How Many Hours at the Candy Stall? The opportu-
nity cost of your time spent selling candy at your stall in 
a shopping mall is $15 per hour. Electricity costs $2 per 
hour, and the weekly rent is $300. You normally stay 
open 11 hours per day (the mall is open 24/7).
a.	 What is the marginal cost of staying open for one 
more hour?
b.	If you expect to sell 4 kilograms of candy in the 12th 
hour, earning $7 per kilogram, is it sensible to stay 
open for the extra hour?

get from each pint of freshly picked blackberries is 
$2.00. It takes you 12 minutes to pick the first pint, and 
each additional pint takes an additional 2 minutes (14 
minutes for the second pint, 16 minutes for the third 
pint, and so on). The opportunity cost of your time is 
$0.10 per minute.
a.	 How many pints of blackberries should you pick? 
Illustrate with a complete graph.
b.	How would your answer to (a) change if your plea-
sure decreased by $0.20 for each additional pint

money for an apple, the larger the number of smacks. 
If the price of apples decreases, the number of smacks 
per apple will __________.
3.4	 Sally sells one apple per day to Andy, and says “cach-
ing” to show her satisfaction with the transaction. The 
greater her satisfaction with the exchange, the louder 
her “caching.” If the price of apples decreases, her 
“caching” will become __________ (louder/softer).
3.5	 Should a Heart Surgeon Do Her Own Plumbing? 
A heart surgeon is skillful at unplugging arteries and 
rerouting the flow of blood, and these skills also make 
her a very skillful plumber. She can clear a clogged drain 
in six minutes, about 10 times faster than the most skillful 
plumber in town. (Related to Application 3 on page 66.)
a.	 Should the surgeon clear her own clogged drains? 
Explain.
b.	Suppose the surgeon earns $20 per minute in heart 
surgery, and the best plumber in town charges $50 
per hour. How much does the surgeon gain by hir-
ing the plumber to clear a clogged drain?

fishing tribe catch two fish per day and half catch eight 
fish per day. A group of 10 members could build a boat 
for another tribe in one day and receive a payment of 
40 fish for the boat.
a.	 Suppose the boat builders are drawn at random from 
the tribe. From the tribe’s perspective, what is the 
expected cost of building the boat?
b.	How could the tribe decrease the cost of building 
the boat, thus making it worthwhile?
3.7	 Solving a Tree-Cutting Problem. Consider a hilly 
neighborhood where large trees provide shade but also 
block views. When a resident announces plans to cut 
down several trees to improve her view, her neighbors 
object and announce plans to block the tree-cutting. 
One week later, the trees are gone, but everyone is 
happy. Use the principle of voluntary exchange to 
explain what happened.
The Principle of Diminishing Returns
Apply the principle of diminishing returns.

Here is a simple economic experiment that takes about 15 
minutes to run. The instructor places a stapler and a stack 
of paper on a table. Students produce “fold-its” by folding a 
page of paper in thirds and stapling both ends of the folded 
page. One student is assigned to inspect each fold-it to be 
sure that it is produced correctly. The experiment starts with

The nation of Latvia is located on 
the shore of the Baltic Sea, and 
since the fourteenth century has 
been a major commercial hub 
between west and east.
Latvia was at the center of the Hanseatic League, the 
world’s first Free Trade Area. But in the early 1990s, 
after several decades of being part of the Soviet 
Union, Latvia suffered from low labor productivity in 
the production of most goods. The following table 
shows output per worker for Latvia and the European 
Community (EC, a group of six nearby European 
countries).

Latvia’s prospects for trade with the EC appear to be dim: Why would a member of the EC purchase goods

Chapter 3 • Exchange and Markets
I
n Chapter 1, we saw that a society makes three types of economic decisions: what 
products to produce, how to produce them, and who gets them. In modern econo-
mies, most of these decisions are made in markets. Most of us participate in the 
labor market and are paid for jobs in which we produce goods and services for others. 
We participate in consumer markets, spending our incomes on food, clothing, housing, 
and other products. In this chapter, we explain why markets exist and then explore the 
virtues and the shortcomings of markets. We also examine the role of government in 
a market-based economy.
Comparative Advantage and Exchange
As we saw earlier in the book, a market is an institution or arrangement that enables 
people to buy and sell things. An alternative to buying and selling in markets is to be 
self-sufficient, with each of us producing everything we need for ourselves. Rather than 
going it alone, most of us specialize: We produce one or two products for others and 
then exchange the money we earn for the products we want to consume.
Specialization and the Gains from Trade
We can explain how people can benefit from specialization and trade with a simple 
example of two people and two products. Suppose that the crew of the television show 
Survivor finishes filming a season of episodes on a remote tropical island and, when the 
crew returns to the mainland, two people miss the boat and are left behind. The two real 
survivors, Fred and Kate, produce and consume two goods, coconuts and fish. The first 
row of Table 3.1 shows their production possibilities. Each day Fred can either gather 
two coconuts or catch six fish, while Kate can either gather one coconut or catch one fish.

rationale for specialization and trade.

Table 3.1  Productivity and Opportunity Costs
We’ll show that the two survivors will be better off if each person specializes in one 
product and then exchanges with the other person. We can use one of the key principles 
of economics to explore the rationale for specialization.
Fred’s opportunity cost of one coconut is three fish—that’s how many fish he could 
catch in the time required to gather one coconut. Similarly, his opportunity cost of a 
fish is one-third coconut, the number of coconuts he could gather in the time required 
to catch one fish. For Kate, the opportunity cost of one coconut is one fish, and the 
opportunity cost of one fish is one coconut.
To demonstrate the benefits of exchange, let’s imagine that both people are ini-
tially self-sufficient, with each producing enough of both goods to satisfy their own 
desires. Suppose they devote 6 days per week to finding food. If Fred initially devotes 
2 days per week to gathering coconuts and 4 days per week to catching fish, he will 
produce and consume four coconuts (two per day times 2 days) and 24 fish (six per day 
times 4 days) per week. This is shown in the first column of Figure 3.1. If Kate initially 
devotes 1 day per week to coconuts and 5 days per week to fish, she will produce and 
consume one coconut and five fish per week.

Specialization will increase the total output of our little survivor economy. It is 
sensible for each person to specialize in the good for which he or she has a lower 
opportunity cost. We say that a person has a comparative advantage in producing a 
particular product if he or she has a lower opportunity cost than another person:
• Fred has a comparative advantage in producing fish because his opportunity 
cost of fish is one-third coconut per fish, compared to one coconut per fish 
for Kate.
• Kate has a comparative advantage in harvesting coconuts because her opportu-
nity cost of coconuts is one fish per coconut, compared to three fish per coconut 
for Fred.
comparative advantage
The ability of one person or nation to 
produce a good at a lower opportunity 
cost than another person or nation.

79
Chapter 3 • Exchange and Markets
The second column of Figure 3.1 shows what happens to production when the 
two people specialize: Fred produces 36 fish and Kate produces six coconuts. The total 
output of both goods increases: The number of coconuts increases from five to six, and 
the number of fish increases from 29 to 36. Specialization increases the output of both 
goods because both people are focusing on what they do best.
If specialization is followed by exchange, both people will be better off. Suppose 
Fred and Kate agree to exchange two fish per coconut. Fred could give up 10 fish to get 
five coconuts. As shown in the third column of Figure 3.1, that leaves him with five coco-
nuts and 26 fish. Compared to the self-sufficient outcome, he has more of both goods—
one more coconut and two more fish. If Kate gives up five coconuts to get 10 fish, that 
leaves her with one coconut and 10 fish, which is better than her self-sufficient outcome 
of one coconut and five fish. Specialization and exchange make both people better off, 
illustrating one of the key principles of economics:
P r i n c i p l e  O f  V o l u n ta r y  E x c h a n g e
A voluntary exchange between two people makes both people better off.
Comparative Advantage versus Absolute Advantage
We’ve seen that it is beneficial for each person to specialize in the product for which 
he or she has a comparative advantage—a lower opportunity cost. You may have 
noticed that Fred is more productive than Kate in producing both goods. Fred requires 
a smaller quantity of resources (in this case less labor time) to produce both goods, so 
he has an absolute advantage in producing both goods. Despite his absolute advan-
tage, Fred gains from specialization and trade because he has a comparative advantage 
in fish. Fred is twice as productive as Kate in producing coconuts, but six times as 
productive in producing fish. By relying on Kate to produce coconuts, Fred frees up 
time to spend producing fish, the good for which he has the larger productivity advan-
tage over Kate. The lesson is that specialization and exchange result from comparative 
advantage, not absolute advantage.
The Division of Labor and Exchange
So far we’ve seen that specialization and trade exploit differences in productivity across 
workers and make everyone better off. We’ve assumed that the differences in produc-
tivity are innate, not acquired. In his 1776 book An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of 
the Wealth of Nations, Adam Smith noted that specialization actually increased produc-
tivity through the division of labor. He used the example of the pin factory to illustrate 
how the division of labor increased output:1
A workman . . . could scarce, perhaps with his utmost industry, make one pin a day, and cer-
tainly could not make twenty. But the way in which this business is now carried on . . . one 
man draws out the wire, another straightens it, a third cuts it, a fourth points it, a fifth 
grinds the top for receiving the head; to make the head requires two or three distinct opera-
tions. . . . The . . . making of a pin is, in this manner, divided into about eighteen distinct 
operations. . . . I have seen a small manufactory of this kind where ten men . . . make among 
them . . . upward of forty eight thousand pins in a day.
Smith listed three reasons for productivity to increase with specialization, with 
each worker performing a single production task:
1	 Repetition. The more times a worker performs a particular task, the more proficient 
the worker becomes at that task.
absolute advantage
The ability of one person or nation to 
produce a product at a lower resource cost 
than another person or nation.

part 1
80
2	 Continuity. A specialized worker doesn’t spend time switching from one task to 
another. This is especially important if switching tasks requires a change in tools 
or location.
3	 Innovation. A specialized worker gains insights into a particular task that lead to 
better production methods. Smith believed that workers were innovators:2
A great part of the machines made use of in those manufacturies in which labour is most 
subdivided, were originally the inventions of common workmen, who, being each of them 
employed in some simple operation, naturally turned their thoughts toward finding out 
easier and readier methods of performing it.
To summarize, specialization and exchange result from differences in productivity 
that lead to comparative advantage. Differences in productivity result from differ-
ences in innate skills and the benefits associated with the division of labor. Adam 
Smith wrote that “every man thus lives by exchanging, or becomes in some measure a 
merchant, and the society itself grows to be what is properly a commercial society.”3

Comparative Advantage and International Trade
The lessons of comparative advantage and specialization apply to trade between 
nations. Each nation could be self-sufficient, producing all the goods it consumes, 
or it could specialize in products for which it has a comparative advantage. Even if 
one nation is more productive than a second nation in producing all goods, trade will 
be beneficial if the first nation has a bigger productivity advantage in one product—
that is, if one nation has a comparative advantage in some product. An import is a 
product produced in a foreign country and purchased by residents of the home 
country. An export is a product produced in the home country and sold in another 
country.
Many people are skeptical about the idea that international trade can make every-
one better off. President Abraham Lincoln expressed his discomfort with importing 
goods:4
I know if I buy a coat in America, I have a coat and America has the money—If I buy a coat 
in England, I have the coat and England has the money.
What President Lincoln didn’t understand is that when he buys a coat in England, he 
sends dollars to England, but the dollars don’t just sit there. Eventually they are sent 
back to the United States to buy goods produced by U.S. workers. In the words of 
economist Todd Buchholz, the author of New Ideas from Dead Economists,5
Money may not make the world go round, but money certainly goes around the world. To 
stop it prevents goods from traveling from where they are produced most inexpensively to 
where they are desired most deeply.
Outsourcing
When a domestic firm shifts part of its production to a different country, we say the 
firm is outsourcing or offshoring. In the modern global economy, transportation and 
communication costs are relatively low, so firms can spread production across many 
countries. By taking advantage of the comparative advantages of different countries, 
a firm can produce its product at a lower cost, charge a lower price, and sell more 
output.
Firms shift functions such as customer service, telemarketing, document manage-
ment, and medical transcription overseas to reduce production costs, allowing them to 
import
A good or service produced in a foreign 
country and purchased by residents of the 
home country (e.g., the United States).
export
A good or service produced in the home 
country (e.g., the United States) and sold 
in another country.

81
Chapter 3 • Exchange and Markets
sell their products at lower prices. Some recent studies of outsourcing have reached a 
number of conclusions:6
1	 The loss of domestic jobs resulting from outsourcing is a normal part of a healthy 
economy because technology and consumer preferences change over time. The 
number of jobs lost to outsourcing is a small fraction of the normal job loss experi-
enced by a healthy economy. For example, in the first 3 months of 2004, a total of 
239,361 workers were laid off, with 9,985 jobs moving to another location within 
the United States, 4,633 outsourced to another country, and the rest simply lost to 
the economy. This means that roughly 2 percent of reported layoffs were caused 
by outsourcing.
2	 The jobs lost to outsourcing are at least partly offset by jobs gained through 
insourcing, jobs that are shifted from overseas to the United States.
3	 The cost savings from outsourcing are substantial, leading to lower prices for 
consumers and more output for firms. The jobs gained from increased output at 
least partly offset the jobs lost to outsourcing.
 
Recall the chapter opener about the nation of Latvia, which in the 
1990s was much less productive than nations in the European 
Community. The question is, Why would a member of the EC, 
whose workers are more productive than Latvian workers in 
the production of all goods, buy any products from Latvia? The 
following table shows worker productivity and the opportunity 
cost of production for two products, saw timber and grain.

Absolute Disadvantage and Comparative Advantage in Latvia
Applying The Concepts #1: What is the rationale for specialization and trade?
Although the EC has an absolute advantage in both prod-
ucts, it has a comparative advantage (a lower opportunity cost) 
in grain: the opportunity cost of one unit of grain is six units of 
saw timber in the EC, compared to 20 units of saw timber in 
Latvia. Latvia has a comparative advantage in saw timber: the 
opportunity cost is 1/20 units of grain in Latvia, compared to 
1/6 units of grain in the EC. Based on the notion of comparative 
advantage, we know that both the EC and Latvia can be made 
better off if the EC produces grain in exchange for saw timber 
produced by Latvia. The EC specializes in grain because that’s 
the product for which it has the largest productivity advantage: 
the productivity ratio is 20:1 for grain, compared to only 6:1 for 
saw timber.  Related to Exercise 1.10.

Markets
Earlier in the chapter, we used a simple example of direct exchange to show the benefits 
of specialization and exchange. In a modern economy, people don’t directly exchange 
goods like fish and coconuts, but instead rely on all sorts of markets to exchange goods 
and services, trading what they have for what they want. In a market economy, most 
people specialize in one productive activity by picking an occupation, and use their 
incomes to buy most of the goods they consume. In addition to the labor and consumer 
markets, many of us participate in the market for financial capital: We earn interest 
from savings accounts and money-market accounts and pay interest on mortgages, car 
loans, and student loans. Friedrich Hayek, a famous twentieth-century economist, sug-
gested that if the market system hadn’t arisen naturally, it would have been proclaimed 
the greatest invention in human history.7
Although it appears that markets arose naturally, a number of social and govern-
ment inventions have made them work better:
• Contracts specify the terms of exchange, facilitating exchange between 
strangers. If you have a cell phone provider, you expect to have reliable phone 
service as long as you pay your bill. If you operate a bookstore, you expect book 
wholesalers to deliver the books you’ve purchased. In both cases, a contract 
specifies the terms of exchange.
• Insurance reduces the risk entrepreneurs face. If you operate a bagel shop, 
fire insurance reduces your losses in the event of a fire.
• Patents increase the profitability of inventions, encouraging firms to 
develop new products and production processes. Pharmaceutical com-
panies such as Bayer Pharmaceutical and Merck spend billions of dollars to 
create, test, and bring new products to the market. A patent prevents other 
companies from copying a new product, making it more likely that the revenue 
from a new product will be large enough to cover research and development 
costs.
• Accounting rules provide potential investors with reliable information 
about the financial performance of a firm. If you are thinking about invest-
ing in Apple Inc., you can use publicly available information to examine the 
company’s financial history.
Virtues of Markets
To assess the virtues of the market system, imagine an alternative—a centrally planned 
economy in which a planning authority decides what products to produce, how to 
produce them, and who gets them. To make these decisions, a planner must first collect 
a huge amount of widely dispersed information about consumption desires (what prod-
ucts each individual wants), production techniques (what resources are required to 
produce each product), and the availability of factors of production (labor, human 
capital, physical capital, and natural resources). Then the planner must decide how to 
allocate the productive resources among the alternative products. Finally, the planner 
must divide the output among the economy’s citizens. Clearly, a central planner has a 
formidable task.
Under a market system, decisions are made by the millions of people who already 
have information about consumers’ desires, production technology, and resources. 
These decisions are guided by prices of inputs and outputs. To illustrate, suppose 
you buy a wool coat. The dozens of people who contributed to the production of the 
coat—including the farmers who manage the sheep, the workers who transform raw

wool into cloth and the cloth into a coat, the truckers who transport the inputs and 
the actual coat, and the merchant who sold the coat—didn’t know you wanted a coat:
• The farmer knew that the price of wool was high enough to justify raising and 
shearing sheep.
• The workers knew that wages were high enough to make their efforts worthwhile.
• The merchant knew that the retail price of the coat was high enough to make it 
worthwhile to acquire the coat in anticipation of selling it.
In a market system, prices provide individuals the information they need to make 
decisions.
Prices provide signals about the relative scarcity of a product and help an economy 
respond to scarcity. For example, suppose wool becomes scarcer, either because a new 
use for wool is discovered or an old source of wool disappears. The greater scarcity 
will increase the price of wool, and producers and consumers will respond in ways that 
diminish scarcity:
• The higher price encourages fabric producers to use the available wool more 
efficiently and encourages farmers to produce more of it.
• The higher price also encourages consumers to switch to coats made from alter-
native fabrics.
These two responses help the economy accommodate an increase in scarcity. Consumers 
and producers don’t need to know why wool is scarcer for these mechanisms to kick 
in—they only need to know that the price is higher.
The decisions made in markets result from the interactions of millions of people, 
each motivated by his or her own interest. Adam Smith used the metaphor of the 
“invisible hand” to explain that people acting in self-interest may actually promote the 
interest of society as a whole:8
It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker that we expect our 
dinner, but from their regard to their own interest. We address ourselves, not to their 
humanity but to their self-love, and never talk to them of our own necessities but of their 
advantages. . . . [Man is] led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of 
this intention. . . . By pursuing his own interest he frequently promotes that of the society 
more effectually than when he really intends to promote it. . . . Nobody but a beggar chooses 
to depend chiefly upon the benevolence of his fellow citizens.
The market system works by getting each person, motivated by self-interest, to produce 
products for other people.
The Role of Entrepreneurs
Entrepreneurs play a key role in a market economy. Prices and profits provide signals 
to entrepreneurs about what to produce. If a product suddenly becomes popular, 
competition among consumers to obtain it will increase its price and increase the 
profits earned by firms producing it. Entrepreneurs will enter the market and increase 
production to meet the higher demand, switching resources from the production 
of other products. As entrepreneurs enter the market, they compete for customers, 
driving the price back down to the level that generates just enough profit for them 
to remain in business. In contrast, if a product becomes less popular, the process is 
reversed. Producers will cut prices in order to be sure of selling the product to the 
smaller number of customers who want it. Entrepreneurs will leave the unprofitable 
market, finding other products to produce, and the price will eventually rise back to 
the level where profits are high enough for the remaining producers to justify staying 
in business.

Example of the Emergence of Markets: POW Camps
To illustrate the pervasiveness of exchange, consider the emergence of markets in 
prisoner of war (POW) camps during World War II.9 During World War II, the 
International Red Cross gave each Allied prisoner a weekly parcel with the same mix 
of products—tinned milk, jam, butter, biscuits, corned beef, chocolate, sugar, and ciga-
rettes. In addition, many prisoners received private parcels from family and friends. 
The prisoners used barter to exchange one good for another, and cigarettes emerged 
as the medium of exchange. Prisoners wandered through the camp calling out their 
offers of goods. For example, “cheese for seven” meant that the prisoner was willing to 
sell a cheese ration for seven cigarettes. In addition to food, the prisoners bought and 
sold clothing (80 cigarettes per shirt), laundry services (two cigarettes per garment), 
and hot cups of coffee (two cigarettes per cup).
The prices of products reflected their scarcity. The tea-drinking British prisoners 
demanded little coffee. Because the British were confined to their compound, packets of 
coffee beans sold for just a few cigarettes. Enterprising British prisoners bribed prison 
guards to permit them to travel to the French compound, where they could sell coffee 
for dozens of cigarettes. Religious groups such as the Sikhs didn’t eat beef, and the excess 
supply of beef in the Sikh compound led to low beef prices. One prisoner who knew the 
Sikh language bought beef at a low price in the Sikh compound and sold it at a higher 
price in other compounds. Eventually, other people entered the Sikh beef trade, and 
beef prices across compounds became roughly equal.

orites picked up in the desert to local dealers, who then sell 
them to the public through websites and eBay. And there are 
professional meteorite hunters, who listen for news of meteorite 
showers and then travel to the landfalls to gather fresh meteor-
ites. Recently some scientists traveled to Morocco to purchase 
a meteorite from Mars for $17,400 ($300 per gram). The scien-
tists will examine the meteorite to get insights into the geology 
of Mars. The market price of meteorites varies from a few dollars 
per gram for the most common types to hundreds of dollars per 
gram for the rarest, including objects that originated from Mars 
and the moon.  Related to Exercise 2.4.

Chapter 3 • Exchange and Markets
Market Failure and the Role of Government
Although markets often operate efficiently on their own, sometimes they do not. 
Market failure happens when a market doesn’t generate the most efficient outcome. 
Later in the book, we explore several sources of market failure and discuss possible 
responses by the government. Here is a preview of the topics:
• Pollution. For markets to work efficiently, the people making the decisions 
about production and consumption must bear the full costs of their decisions. In 
some cases, however, other people bear some of the costs. For example, people 
living downwind from a paper mill breathe dirty air. The people who decide how 
much paper to produce will ignore these other costs, so their decisions about how 
much paper to produce will be inefficient from the social perspective. Similarly, 
people with asthma suffer from the emissions of cars and SUVs. Drivers ignore 
these other costs, so their decisions about how much to drive will be inefficient 
from the social perspective. The role of government is to ensure that polluters 
bear the full cost of their production and consumption decisions.
• Public goods. A public good is available for everyone to utilize, regardless of 
who pays and who doesn’t. Another requirement for market efficiency is that 
decision makers must reap the full benefits from their decisions. In the case of 
a public good such as a levee, the benefits go to everyone in the area protected 
from flooding, not just the person who builds the levee. The role of government 
is to facilitate the collective decision making for public goods such as levees, 
national defense, parks, and space exploration.
• Imperfect information. For markets to operate efficiently, people must have 
enough information to make informed decisions about how much to produce or 
consume. When they don’t, the role of government is to disseminate information 
and promote informed choices.
• Imperfect competition. Some markets are dominated by a few large firms, and 
the lack of competition leads to high prices and small quantities. For example, 
DeBeers dominates the diamond market. The role of government is to foster 
competition, which leads to lower prices and more choices.
What are the other roles of government in a market-based economy? The govern-
ment enforces property rights by protecting the property and possessions of individu-
als and firms from theft. The government uses the legal system—police, courts, and 
prisons—to enforce those rights. The protection of private property guarantees that 
people will keep the fruits of their labor, encouraging production and exchange. The 
government has two additional roles to play in a market economy:
• Establishing rules for market exchange and using its police power to enforce 
the rules.
• Reducing economic uncertainty and providing for people who have lost a job, 
have poor health, or experience other unforeseen difficulties and accidents.
Government Enforces the Rules of Exchange
The market system is based on exchanges between strangers. These exchanges are 
covered by implicit and explicit contracts that establish the terms of trade. For example, 
real-estate transactions and other business dealings are sealed with explicit contracts 
that specify who pays what and when. To facilitate exchange, the government helps to 
enforce contracts by maintaining a legal system that punishes people who violate them. 
This system allows people to trade with the confidence that the terms of the contracts 
they enter will be met.
Learning Objective 3.3

In the case of consumer goods, the implicit contract is that the product is safe to 
use. The government enforces this implicit contract through product liability or tort 
law. If a consumer is harmed by using a particular product, the consumer can file a 
lawsuit against the manufacturer and seek compensation. For example, consumers who 
are injured in defective automobiles may be awarded settlements to cover the cost of 
medical care, lost work time, and pain and suffering.
The government also disseminates information about consumer products. The 
government requires firms to provide information about the features of their prod-
ucts, including warnings about potentially harmful uses of the product. For example, 
cigarettes have warning labels like “Quitting Smoking Now Greatly Reduces Serious 
Risks to Your Health.” Some cold medications warn consumers to avoid driving while 
taking the medication.
We’ve already seen one of the virtues of a market system—competition among 
producers tends to keep prices low. As we’ll see later, the government uses antitrust 
policy to foster competition by (a) breaking up monopolies (a single seller of a prod-
uct), (b) preventing firms from colluding to fix prices, and (c) preventing firms that 
produce competing products from merging into a single firm. In some markets, the 
emergence of a single firm—a monopolist—is inevitable because the entry of a second 
firm would make both firms unprofitable. Some examples are cable television providers 
and electricity producers. Governments regulate these firms, controlling the price of 
the products they produce.
Government Can Reduce Economic Uncertainty
A market economy provides plenty of opportunities to people, but it has risks. Your 
level of success in a market economy—how much income you earn and how much 
wealth you accumulate—will depend on your innate intelligence as well as your efforts. 
But there is also an element of luck: Your fate is affected by where you were born, 
what occupation you choose, and your genetic makeup and health. Chance events, 
such as natural disasters and human accidents, also can affect your prosperity. Finally, 
some people lose their jobs when the national economy is in a slump and firms lay 
off workers. Given the uncertainty of market economies, most governments fund a 
“social safety net” that provides for citizens who fare poorly in markets. The safety net 
includes programs that redistribute income from rich to poor, from the employed to 
the unemployed. The idea behind having a social safety net is to guarantee a minimum 
income to people who suffer from job losses, poor health, or bad luck.
Of course, there are private responses to economic uncertainty. For example, we 
can buy our own insurance to cover losses from fire and theft, to cover our medical 
expenses, and to provide death benefits to our survivors in the event of an accident or 
disaster. Private insurance works because only a fraction of the people who buy insur-
ance eventually file claims and receive reimbursements from insurance companies. In 
other words, the payments, or premiums, of many are used to pay the claims of a few. 
Private insurance works when enough low-risk people purchase insurance to cover the 
costs of reimbursing the high-risk people.
Some types of insurance are unavailable in the private insurance market. As a 
result, the government steps in to fill the void. For example, unemployment insurance 
(UI) is a government program that provides 26 weeks of compensation for people 
who lose their jobs. The insurance is financed by mandatory contributions from 
employers. Because all employers contribute to the system, the cost of the insurance 
stays low.

One role of government in a market economy is to enforce prop-
erty rights. Roughly 10 percent of the world’s population lives 
in urban squatter settlements, with little security in housing. 
A household that occupies public land could be relocated at any 
time, and would lose all of its immobile possessions, including 
a dwelling the household built and maintained. The insecurity 
in tenure discourages investment in housing construction and 
maintenance.

Property Rights and Urban Slums
Applying The Concepts #3: What is the role of government in a market economy?
One policy option is property titling, that is, granting owner-
ship of a dwelling to its occupant. A person who owns a dwelling 
reaps all the benefits of regular repair and maintenance, includ-
ing any increase in market value, so granting property rights 
increases the incentive for property maintenance. A study of a 
program in Peru that granted 1.2 million property titles to urban 
squatters on public land provides evidence that urban property 
titling increases investment in housing repair and maintenance. 
The substantial increase in housing renovation improved the 
housing conditions of the urban households.  Related to 
Exercise 3.5.

exchange and the virtues 
and shortcomings of mar-
kets. We also discussed 
the role of government in 
a market economy. Here 
are the main points of the 
chapter:
1.	 It is sensible for a person to produce the product for which he or 
she has a comparative advantage, that is, a lower opportunity 
cost than another person.
2.	 Specialization increases productivity through the division of labor, 
a result of the benefits of repetition, continuity, and innovation.
3.	 A system of international specialization and trade is sensible 
because nations have different opportunity costs of producing 
goods, giving rise to comparative advantages.
4.	 Under a market system, self-interested people, guided by prices, 
make the decisions about what products to produce, how to 
produce them, and who gets them.
5.	 Government roles in a market economy include establishing 
the rules for exchange, reducing economic uncertainty, and 
responding to market failures.

Demand, Supply, 
and Market Equilibrium
If you want to predict the price of 
coffee, it would be a good idea to 
monitor the weather in Brazil, the 
world’s largest coffee producer.
A prolonged drought in 2014 caused early flowering 
and decreased the number of nodes that hold coffee 
cherries on their branches. These changes in coffee 
trees decrease the yield of the next crop, and as a 
result, the future price of coffee (for the 2015 crop) 
increased.1 But the return of heavy rains in late 2014 
caused greater optimism about the size of the 2015 
harvest, and the future price decreased by roughly 
11 percent. The return of dry weather a few weeks 
later replaced optimism with pessimism, and the future price increased by 12 ­percent.2 The coffee harvest is very 
sensitive to weather, and so are coffee prices.

ur discussion of the virtues of exchange and markets in Chapter 3 has set 
the stage for this chapter, where we explore the mechanics of markets. We 
use the model of demand and supply—the most important tool of economic 
analysis—to see how markets work. We’ll see how the prices of goods and services are 
affected by all sorts of changes in the economy, including bad weather, higher income, 
technological innovation, bad publicity, and changes in consumer preferences. This 
chapter prepares you for the applications of demand and supply you’ll see in the rest 
of the book.
The model of demand and supply explains how a perfectly competitive market 
operates. A perfectly competitive market has many buyers and sellers of a product, 
so no single buyer or seller can affect the market price. The classic example of a per-
fectly competitive firm is a wheat farmer who produces a tiny fraction of the total 
supply of wheat. No matter how much wheat an individual farmer produces, the farmer 
can’t change the market price of wheat.
The Demand Curve
On the demand side of a market, consumers buy products from firms. We have one 
main question about this side of the market: How much of a particular product are 
consumers willing to buy during a particular period? Notice that we define demand for 
a particular period, for example, a day, a month, or a year.
We start our discussion of demand with the individual consumer. A consumer who 
is willing to buy a particular product is willing to sacrifice enough money to purchase 
it. The consumer doesn’t merely have a desire to buy the good, but is also willing and 
able to sacrifice something to get it. How much of a product is an individual willing to 
buy? It depends on a number of variables. Here is a list of the variables that affect an 
individual consumer’s decision, using the pizza market as an example:
• The price of the product (e.g., the price of a pizza)
• The consumer’s income
• The price of substitute goods (e.g., the prices of tacos or sandwiches or other 
goods that can be consumed instead of pizza)
• The price of complementary goods (e.g., the price of lemonade or other goods 
consumed with pizza)
• The consumer’s preferences or tastes and advertising that may influence 
preferences
• The consumer’s expectations about future prices
Together, these variables determine how much of a particular product an indi-
vidual consumer is willing and able to buy, the quantity demanded. We start our 
discussion of demand with the relationship between price and quantity demanded, a 
relationship we represented graphically by the demand curve. Later in the chapter, we 
discuss the other variables that affect the individual consumer’s decision about how 
much of a product to buy.
The Individual Demand Curve and the Law of Demand
The starting point for a discussion of individual demand is a demand schedule, 
which is a table of numbers showing the relationship between the price of a particu-
lar product and the quantity that an individual consumer is willing to buy. The 
demand schedule shows how the quantity demanded by an individual changes with 
the price, ceteris ­paribus (everything else held fixed). The variables that are held fixed 
in the demand schedule are the consumer’s income, the prices of substitutes and 
complements, the consumer’s tastes, and the consumer’s expectations about future 
prices.

The table in Figure 4.1 shows Al’s demand schedule for pizza. At a price of $2, Al 
buys 13 pizzas per month. As the price rises, he buys fewer pizzas: 10 pizzas at a price 
of $4, seven pizzas at a price of $6, and so on, down to only one pizza at a price of $10. 
Remember that in a demand schedule, any change in quantity results from a change 
in price alone.
The individual demand curve is a graphical representation of the demand sched-
ule. By plotting the numbers in Al’s demand schedule—various combinations of price 
and quantity—we can draw his demand curve for pizza. The demand curve shows the 
relationship between the price and the quantity demanded by an individual consumer, 
ceteris paribus. To get the data for a single demand curve, we change only the price of 
pizza and observe how a consumer responds to the price change. In Figure 4.1, Al’s 
demand curve shows the quantity of pizzas he is willing to buy at each price.
Notice that Al’s demand curve is negatively sloped, reflecting the law of demand. 
This law applies to all consumers:
There is a negative relationship between price and quantity demanded, ceteris paribus.
The words ceteris paribus remind us that in order to isolate the relationship between 
price and quantity demanded, we must assume that income, the prices of related goods 
such as substitutes and complements, and tastes are unchanged. As the price of pizza

▲  Figure 4.1  The Individual Demand Curve
According to the law of demand, the higher the price, the smaller the quantity demanded, everything 
else being equal. Therefore, the demand curve is negatively sloped: When the price increases from  
$6 to $8, the quantity demanded decreases from seven pizzas per month (point c) to four pizzas 
per month (point b).

increases and nothing else changes, Al moves upward along his demand curve and buys 
a smaller quantity of pizza. For example, if the price increases from $8 to $10, Al moves 
upward along his demand curve from point b to point a, and buys only one pizza per 
month, down from four pizzas at the lower price. A movement along a single demand 
curve is called a change in quantity demanded, a change in the quantity a consumer 
is willing to buy when the price changes.
From Individual Demand to Market Demand
The market demand curve shows the relationship between the price of the good and 
the quantity demanded by all consumers, ceteris paribus. As in the case of the individual 
demand curve, when we draw the market demand curve we assume that the other 
variables that affect individual demand (income, the prices of substitute and comple-
mentary goods, tastes, and price expectations) are fixed. In addition, we assume the 
number of consumers is fixed.
Figure 4.2 shows how to derive the market demand curve when there are only 
two consumers. Panel A shows Al’s demand curve for pizza, and Panel B shows Bea’s 
demand curve. At a price of $8, Al will buy four pizzas (point a) and Bea will buy two 
pizzas (point b), so the total quantity demanded at this price is six pizzas. In Panel C, 
point c shows the point on the market demand curve associated with a price of $8. 
At this price, the market quantity demanded is six pizzas. If the price drops to $4, Al 
will buy 10 pizzas (point d) and Bea will buy six pizzas (point e), for a total of 16 piz-
zas (shown by point f on the market demand curve). The market demand curve is the 
horizontal sum of the individual demand curves.

▲  Figure 4.2  From Individual to Market Demand
The market demand equals the sum of the demands of all consumers. In this case, there are only two 
consumers, so at each price the market quantity demanded equals the quantity demanded by Al plus 
the quantity demanded by Bea. At a price of $8, Al’s quantity is four pizzas (point a) and Bea’s quantity 
is two pizzas (point b), so the market quantity demanded is six pizzas (point c). Each consumer obeys 
the law of demand, so the market demand curve is negatively sloped.

The market demand is negatively sloped, reflecting the law of demand. This is 
sensible, because if each consumer obeys the law of demand, consumers as a group 
will too. When the price increases from $4 to $8, there is a change in quantity 
demanded as we move along the demand curve from point f to point c. The move-
ment along the demand curve occurs if the price of pizza is the only variable that has 
changed.
The Supply Curve
On the supply side of a market, firms sell their products to consumers. Suppose you 
ask the manager of a firm, “How much of your product are you willing to produce 
and sell?” The answer is likely to be “it depends.” The manager’s decision about how 
much to produce depends on many variables, including the following, using pizza as 
an example:
• The price of the product (e.g., the price per pizza)
• The wage paid to workers
• The price of materials (e.g., the price of dough and cheese)
• The cost of capital (e.g., the cost of a pizza oven)
• The state of production technology (e.g., the knowledge used in making pizza)
• Producers’ expectations about future prices
• Taxes paid to the government or subsidies (payments from the government to 
firms to produce a product)
Together, these variables determine how much of a product firms are willing to pro-
duce and sell, the quantity supplied. We start our discussion of market supply with 
the relationship between the price of a good and the quantity of that good supplied,

The Law of Demand for Young Smokers

that increases in state cigarette taxes between 1990 and 2005 
resulted in less participation (fewer smokers) and lower fre-
quency (fewer cigarettes per smoker).
A change in cigarette taxes in Canada illustrates the sec-
ond effect, the new-smoker effect. In 1994, several provinces 
in eastern Canada cut their cigarette taxes in response to the 
smuggling of cigarettes from the United States (where taxes are 
lower), and the price of cigarettes in the provinces decreased 
by roughly 50 percent. Researchers tracked the choices of 591 
youths from the Waterloo Smoking Prevention Program and 
concluded that the lower price increased the smoking rate by 
roughly 17 percent.  Related to Exercises 1.6 and 1.8.

demand for cigarettes, the quantity of cigarettes demanded 
increases for two reasons. First, people who smoked cigarettes 
at the original price respond to the lower price by smoking more. 
Second, some people start smoking.
In the United States, cigarette taxes vary across states, 
and studies of cigarette consumption patterns show that higher 
taxes mean less cigarette consumption by youths. Using data

a relationship we represent graphically by the supply curve. Later in the chapter we 
discuss the other variables that affect the individual firm’s decision about how much of 
a product to produce and sell. 
The Individual Supply Curve and the Law of Supply
Consider the decision of an individual producer. The starting point for a discussion of 
individual supply is a supply schedule, a table that shows the relationship between the 
price of a particular product and the quantity that an individual producer is willing to 
sell. The supply schedule shows how the quantity supplied by an individual producer 
changes with the price, ceteris paribus. The variables we hold fixed in the supply schedule 
are input costs, technology, price expectations, and government taxes or subsidies.
The table in Figure 4.3 shows the supply schedule for pizza at Lola’s Pizza Shop. 
At a price of $2, Lola doesn’t produce any pizzas, indicating that a $2 price is not high 
enough to cover her cost of producing a pizza. In contrast, at a price of $4 she supplies 
100 pizzas. In this example, each $2 increase in price increases the quantity supplied by 
100 pizzas to 200 at a price of $6, 300 at a price of $8, and so on. Remember that in a 
supply schedule, a change in quantity results from a change in price alone.

The supply curve of an individual supplier is positively sloped, reflecting the law of supply. As shown by 
point a, the quantity supplied is zero at a price of $2, indicating that the minimum supply price is just 
above $2. An increase in price increases the quantity supplied to 100 pizzas at a price of $4, 200 pizzas 
at a price of $6, and so on.

The individual supply curve is a graphical representation of the supply schedule. 
By plotting the numbers in Lola’s supply schedule—different combinations of price 
and quantity—we can draw her supply curve for pizza. The individual supply curve 
shows the relationship between the price of a product and the quantity supplied by

price and quantity supplied by a single 
firm, ceteris paribus.

a single firm, ceteris paribus. To get the data for a supply curve, we change only the price 
of pizza and observe how a producer responds to the price change.
Figure 4.3 shows Lola’s supply curve for pizza, which shows the quantity of pizzas 
she is willing to sell at each price. The individual supply curve is positively sloped, 
reflecting the law of supply, a pattern of behavior that we observe in producers:
There is a positive relationship between price and quantity supplied, ceteris paribus.
The words ceteris paribus remind us that to isolate the relationship between price and 
quantity supplied we assume the other factors that influence producers are unchanged. 
As the price of pizza increases and nothing else changes, Lola moves upward along her 
individual supply curve and produces a larger quantity of pizza. For example, if the 
price increases from $6 to $8, Lola moves upward along her supply curve from point c 
to point d, and the quantity supplied increases from 200 to 300. A movement along a 
single supply curve is called a change in quantity supplied, a change in the quantity 
a producer is willing and able to sell when the price changes.
The minimum supply price is the lowest price at which a product is supplied. 
A firm won’t produce a product unless the price is high enough to cover the marginal 
cost of producing it. As shown in Figure 4.3, a price of $2 is not high enough to cover 
the cost of producing the first pizza, so Lola’s quantity supplied is zero (point a). But 
when the price rises above $2, she produces some pizzas, indicating that her minimum 
supply price is just above $2.
Why Is the Individual Supply Curve Positively Sloped?
The individual supply curve is positively sloped, consistent with the law of supply. To 
explain the positive slope, consider how Lola responds to an increase in price. A higher 
price encourages a firm to increase its output by purchasing more materials and hiring 
more workers. To increase her workforce, Lola might be forced to pay overtime or 
hire workers who are more costly or less productive than the original workers. But the 
higher price of pizza makes it worthwhile to incur these higher costs.
The supply curve shows the marginal cost of production for different quantities 
produced. We can use the marginal principle to explain this.

Increase the level of an activity as long as its marginal benefit 
exceeds its marginal cost. Choose the level at which the marginal 
benefit equals the marginal cost.
For Lola, the marginal benefit of producing a pizza is the price she gets for it. When 
the price is only $2.00, she doesn’t produce any pizza, which tells us that the marginal 
cost of the first pizza must be greater than $2.00; otherwise, she would have produced 
it. But when the price rises to $2.01, she produces the first pizza because now the 
marginal benefit (the $2.01 price) exceeds the marginal cost. This tells us that the 
marginal cost of the first pizza is less than $2.01; otherwise, she wouldn’t produce it at 
a price of $2.01. To summarize, the marginal cost of the first pizza is between $2.00 
and $2.01, or just over $2.00. Similarly, point b on the supply curve in Figure 4.3 shows 
that Lola won’t produce her 100th pizza at a price of $3.99, but will produce it at a 
price of $4.00, indicating that her marginal cost of producing that pizza is between 
$3.99 and $4.00, or just under $4.00. In general, the supply curve shows the marginal 
cost of production.

From Individual Supply to Market Supply
The market supply curve for a particular good shows the relationship between the 
price of the good and the quantity that all producers together are willing to sell, ceteris 
paribus. To draw the market supply curve, we assume the other variables that affect 
individual supply are fixed. The market quantity supplied is simply the sum of the 
quantities supplied by all the firms in the market. To show how to draw the market 
supply curve, we’ll assume there are only two firms in the market. Of course, a perfectly 
competitive market has a large number of firms, but the lessons from the two-firm case 
generalize to a case of many firms.
Figure 4.4 shows how to derive a market supply curve from individual supply 
curves. In Panel A, Lola has relatively low production costs, as reflected in her relatively 
low minimum supply price ($2 at point a). In Panel B, Hiram has higher production 
costs, so he has a higher minimum price ($6 at point f  ). As a result, his supply curve 
lies above Lola’s. To draw the market supply curve, we add the individual supply curves 
horizontally. This gives us two segments for the market supply curve:
market supply curve
A curve showing the relationship between 
the market price and quantity supplied by 
all firms, ceteris paribus.
• Prices between $2 and $6: Segment connecting points i and k. Hiram’s high-
cost firm doesn’t supply any output, so the market supply is the same as the 
­individual supply from Lola. For example, at a price of $4 Lola supplies 100 piz-
zas (point b) and Hiram does not produce any, so the market supply is 100 pizzas 
(point j).
▲  Figure 4.4  From Individual to Market Supply
The market supply is the sum of the supplies of all firms. In Panel A, Lola is a low-cost producer who 
produces the first pizza once the price rises above $2 (shown by point a). In Panel B, Hiram is a high-
cost producer who doesn’t produce pizza until the price rises above $6 (shown by point f  ). To draw the 
market supply curve, we sum the individual supply curves horizontally. At a price of $8, market supply is 
400 pizzas (point m), equal to 300 from Lola (point d) plus 100 from Hiram (point g).

• Prices above $6: Segment above point k. At higher prices, the high-cost firm 
produces some output, and the market supply is the sum of the quantities sup-
plied by the two firms. For example, at a price of $8 Lola produces 300 pizzas 
(point d) and Hiram produces 100 pizzas (point g), so the market quantity sup-
plied is 400 pizzas (point m).
A perfectly competitive market has hundreds of firms rather than just two, but the 
process of going from individual supply curves to the market supply curve is the same. 
We add the individual supply curves horizontally by picking a price and adding up the 
quantities supplied by all the firms in the market. In the more realistic case of many 
firms, the supply curve will be smooth rather than kinked. This smooth line is shown 
in Figure 4.5. In this case, we assume that there are 100 firms identical to Lola’s firm. 
The minimum supply price is $2, and for each $2 increase in price, the quantity sup-
plied increases by 10,000 pizzas.
▲  Figure 4.5  The Market Supply Curve with Many Firms
The market supply is the sum of the supplies of all firms. The minimum supply price is $2 (point a), 
and the quantity supplied increases by 10,000 for each $2 increase in price to 10,000 at a price of $4 
(point b), 20,000 at a price of $6 (point c), and so on.

Why Is the Market Supply Curve Positively Sloped?
The market supply curve is positively sloped, consistent with the law of supply. To 
explain the positive slope, consider the two responses by firms to an increase in price:
• Individual firm. As we saw earlier, a higher price encourages a firm to increase 
its output by purchasing more materials and hiring more workers.
• New firms. In the long run, new firms can enter the market and existing firms 
can expand their production facilities to produce more output. The new firms 
may have higher production costs than the original firms, but the higher output 
price makes it worthwhile to enter the market, even with higher costs.
Like the individual supply curve, the market supply curve shows the marginal 
cost of production for different quantities produced. In Figure 4.5, the marginal cost 
of the first pizza is the minimum supply price for the firm with the lowest cost (just 
over $2.00). Similarly, point d on the supply curve shows that the 30,000th pizza 
won’t be produced at a price of $7.99, but will be produced at a price of $8.00. This 
indicates that the marginal cost of producing the 30,000th pizza is just under $8.00. 
Like the individual supply curve, the market supply curve shows the marginal cost of 
production.

Market Equilibrium: Bringing Demand and Supply Together
In Chapter 3 we saw that a market is an arrangement that brings buyers and sellers 
together. So far in this chapter we’ve seen how the two sides of a market—demand and 
supply—work. Now we bring the two sides of the market together to show how prices 
and quantities are determined.
When the quantity of a product demanded equals the quantity supplied at the pre-
vailing market price, we have reached a market equilibrium. When a market reaches 
an equilibrium, there is no pressure to change the price. If pizza firms produce exactly 
the quantity of pizza that consumers are willing to buy, each consumer will get a pizza 
at the prevailing price, and each producer will sell all its pizza. In Figure 4.6, the equi-
librium price is shown by the intersection of the demand and supply curves. At a price 
of $8, the supply curve shows that firms will produce 30,000 pizzas, which is exactly the 
quantity that consumers are willing to buy at that price.
Excess Demand Causes the Price to Rise
If the price is below the equilibrium price, there will be excess demand for the product. 
Excess demand (sometimes called a shortage) occurs when, at the prevailing market 
price, the quantity demanded exceeds the quantity supplied, meaning that consumers 
are willing to buy more than producers are willing to sell. In Figure 4.6, at a price of 
$6, there is an excess demand equal to 16,000 pizzas: Consumers are willing to buy 
36,000 pizzas (point c), but producers are willing to sell only 20,000 pizzas (point b) 
because the price is less than the marginal cost of producing pizza number 20,001 and 
beyond. This mismatch between demand and supply will cause the price of pizza to 
rise. Firms will increase the price they charge for their limited supply of pizza, and 
anxious consumers will pay the higher price to get one of the few pizzas available.

Law of Supply and Woolympics
Applying the Concepts #2: What is the law of supply?
There have been several attempts to revive the wool indus-
try by boosting the demand for wool and thus increasing its 
price. The United Nations General Assembly declared 2009 as 
the International Year of Natural Fibres, with the objective “to 
raise awareness and stimulate demand for natural fibres.” In 
2012, the Federated Farmers of New Zealand proposed that 
sheep shearing be added to the Commonwealth Games and 
Olympics as a demonstration sport. The favorites for Olympic 
titles are the current world record holders Ivan Scott (744 sheep 
in 24 hours) and Kerry-Jo Te Huia (507 sheep in 24 hours). Of 
course, it’s not obvious that Olympic shearing would increase 
the demand for wool, and then there is the problem of what 
to do with all the sheared wool. Speed knitting?  Related to 
­Exercises 2.6 and 2.10.

In the 1990s, the world price of wool decreased by about 30 per-
cent, and prices have remained relatively low since then. Based 
on the law of supply, we would expect the quantity of wool 
supplied from New Zealand and other exporters to decrease, 
and that’s what happened. Land formerly used to grow grass 
for wool-producing sheep has been converted into other uses, 
including dairy products, forestry, and the domestication of deer.

Chapter 4 • Demand, Supply, and Market Equilibrium
101
An increase in price eliminates excess demand by changing both the quantity 
demanded and the quantity supplied. As the price increases, the excess demand shrinks 
for two reasons:
• The market moves upward along the demand curve (from point c toward point a), 
decreasing the quantity demanded.
• The market moves upward along the supply curve (from point b toward point a), 
increasing the quantity supplied.
Because the quantity demanded decreases while the quantity supplied increases, the 
gap between the quantity demanded and the quantity supplied narrows. The price will 
continue to rise until excess demand is eliminated. In Figure 4.6, at a price of $8 the 
quantity supplied equals the quantity demanded, as shown by point a.
▲  Figure 4.6  Market Equilibrium
At the market equilibrium (point a, with price = $8 and quantity = 30,000), the quantity supplied equals 
the quantity demanded. At a price below the equilibrium price ($6), there is excess demand—the quantity 
demanded at point c exceeds the quantity supplied at point b. At a price above the equilibrium price 
($12), there is excess supply—the quantity supplied at point e exceeds the quantity demanded at point d.

In some cases, the government creates an excess demand for a good by setting a maxi-
mum price (sometimes called a price ceiling). If the government sets a maximum price that is 
less than the equilibrium price, the result is a permanent excess demand for the good. Later 
in the book we explore the market effects of such ­policies.
Excess Supply Causes the Price to Drop
What happens if the price is above the equilibrium price? Excess supply (sometimes 
called a surplus) occurs when the quantity supplied exceeds the quantity demanded, mean-
ing that producers are willing to sell more than consumers are willing to buy. This is 
shown by points d and e in Figure 4.6. At a price of $12, the excess supply is 32,000 pizzas: 
Producers are willing to sell 50,000 pizzas (point e), but consumers are willing to buy 
only 18,000 (point d). This mismatch will cause the price of pizzas to fall as firms cut the 
price to sell them. As the price drops, the excess supply will shrink for two reasons:
• The market moves downward along the demand curve from point d toward 
point a, increasing the quantity demanded.
• The market moves downward along the supply curve from point e toward point a, 
decreasing the quantity supplied.

A situation in which the quantity supplied 
exceeds the quantity demanded at the

Because the quantity demanded increases while the quantity supplied decreases, 
the gap between the quantity supplied and the quantity demanded narrows. The price 
will continue to drop until excess supply is eliminated. In Figure 4.6, at a price of $8, 
the quantity supplied equals the quantity demanded, as shown by point a.
The government sometimes creates an excess supply of a good by setting a mini-
mum price (sometimes called a price floor). If the government sets a minimum price that 
is greater than the equilibrium price, the result is a permanent excess supply. We discuss 
the market effects of minimum prices later in the book.  
Market Effects of Changes in Demand
We’ve seen that market equilibrium occurs when the quantity supplied equals the 
quantity demanded, shown graphically by the intersection of the supply curve and the 
demand curve. In this part of the chapter, we see how changes on the demand side of 
the market affect the equilibrium price and equilibrium quantity.
Change in Quantity Demanded versus Change in Demand
Earlier in the chapter we listed the variables that determine how much of a particular 
product consumers are willing to buy. The first variable is the price of the product. The 
demand curve shows the negative relationship between price and quantity demanded, 
ceteris paribus. In Panel A of Figure 4.7, when the price decreases from $8 to $6, we 
move downward along the demand curve from point a to point b, and the quantity 
demanded increases. As noted earlier in the chapter, this is called a change in quantity 
demanded. Now we’re ready to take a closer look at the other variables that affect 
demand besides price—income, the prices of related goods, tastes, advertising, and the 
number of consumers—and see how changes in these variables affect the demand for 
the product and the market equilibrium.
If any of these other variables change, the relationship between the product’s price 
and quantity—shown numerically in the demand schedule and graphically in the

sectors of member countries. Under a minimum-price policy 
the government sets a price above the market-equilibrium price. 
The EU guarantees farmers minimum prices for products such 
as grain, dairy products, and wine. This policy causes artifi-
cial excess supply: if the minimum price exceeds the market-
equilibrium price, the quantity supplied will exceed the quantity 
demanded. To support the minimum prices, the EU purchases 
any output that a farmer cannot sell at the guaranteed price 
and stores the excess supply in facilities labeled by the Euro-
pean press as “butter mountains” and “wine lakes.” In recent 
years the EU has reformed its agriculture policy by reducing 
and in some cases eliminating minimum prices. As a result, 
the butter mountains and wine lakes are shrinking.  Related to 
­Exercises  3.6 and 3.8.

demand curve—will change. That means we will have an entirely different demand 
schedule and an entirely different demand curve. In Panel B of Figure 4.7, we show this 
result as a shift of the entire demand curve from D1 to D2. This particular shift means 
that at any price consumers are willing to buy a larger quantity of the product. For 
example, at a price of $8 consumers are willing to buy 46,000 pizzas (point c), up from 
30,000 with the initial demand curve. To convey the idea that changes in these other 
variables change the demand schedule and the demand curve, we say that a change in 
any of these variables causes a change in demand.

Increases in Demand Shift the Demand Curve
What types of changes will increase the demand and shift the demand curve to the 
right, as shown in Figure 4.7? An increase in demand like the one represented in 
­Figure  4.7 can occur for several reasons, listed in Table 4.1.
• Increase in income. Consumers use their income to buy products, and the more 
money they have, the more money they spend. For a normal good, there is a 
­positive relationship between consumer income and the quantity consumed. 
When income increases, a consumer buys a larger quantity of a normal good. 
Most goods fall into this category—including new clothes, movies, and pizza.

• Decrease in income. An inferior good is the opposite of a normal good. Con-
sumers buy larger quantities of inferior goods when their income decreases. For 
example, if you lose your job you might make your own coffee instead of buy-
ing it in a coffee shop, rent DVDs instead of going to the theater, and eat more 
macaroni and cheese. In this case, homemade coffee, DVDs, and macaroni and 
cheese are examples of inferior goods.
• Increase in price of a substitute good. When two goods are substitutes, an 
increase in the price of the first good causes some consumers to switch to the 
second good. Tacos and pizza are substitutes, so an increase in the price of tacos 
increases the demand for pizza as some consumers substitute pizza for tacos, 
which are now more expensive relative to pizza.
• Decrease in price of a complementary good. When two goods are comple-
ments, they are consumed together as a package, and a decrease in the price of 
one good decreases the cost of the entire package. As a result, consumers buy 
more of both goods. Pizza and lemonade are complementary goods, so a decrease 
in the price of lemonade decreases the total cost of a lemonade-and-pizza meal, 
increasing the demand for pizza.
• Increase in population. An increase in the number of people means there are 
more potential pizza consumers—more individual demand curves to add up to 
get the market demand curve—so market demand increases.
• Shift in consumer preferences. Consumers’ preferences or tastes can change 
over time. If consumers’ preferences shift in favor of pizza, the demand for pizza 
increases. One purpose of advertising is to change consumers’ preferences, and 
a successful pizza advertising campaign will increase demand.
• Expectations of higher future prices. If consumers think next month’s pizza 
price will be higher than they had initially expected, they may buy a larger quan-
tity today and a smaller quantity next month. That means the demand for pizza 
today will increase.
We can use Figure 4.8 to show how an increase in demand affects the equilibrium 
price and equilibrium quantity. An increase in the demand for pizza resulting from

▲  Figure 4.8  An Increase in Demand Increases the Equilibrium Price
An increase in demand shifts the demand curve to the right: At each price, the quantity demanded 
increases. At the initial price ($8), there is excess demand, with the quantity demanded (point b) 
exceeding the quantity supplied (point a). The excess demand causes the price to rise, and equilibrium 
is restored at point c. To summarize, the increase in demand increases the equilibrium price to $10 and 
increases the equilibrium quantity to 40,000 pizzas.

from D1 to D2. At the initial price of $8, there will be excess demand, as indicated by 
points a and b: Consumers are willing to buy 46,000 pizzas (point b), but producers are 
willing to sell only 30,000 (point a). Consumers want to buy 16,000 more pizzas than 
producers are willing to supply, and the excess demand causes upward pressure on the 
price. As the price rises, the excess demand shrinks because the quantity demanded 
decreases while the quantity supplied increases. The supply curve intersects the new 
demand curve at point c, so the new equilibrium price is $10 (up from $8), and the new 
equilibrium quantity is 40,000 pizzas (up from 30,000).
Decreases in Demand Shift the Demand Curve
What types of changes in the pizza market will decrease the demand for pizza? A 
decrease in demand means that at each price consumers are willing to buy a smaller 
quantity. In Figure 4.9, a decrease in demand shifts the market demand curve from D1 
to D0. At the initial price of $8, the quantity demanded decreases from 30,000 pizzas 
(point a) to 14,000 pizzas (point b). A decrease in demand like the one represented in 
Figure 4.9 can occur for several reasons, listed in Table 4.2.
▲  Figure 4.9  A Decrease in Demand Decreases the Equilibrium Price
A decrease in demand shifts the demand curve to the left: At each price, the quantity demanded 
decreases. At the initial price ($8), there is excess supply, with the quantity supplied (point a) exceeding 
the quantity demanded (point b). The excess supply causes the price to drop, and equilibrium is restored 
at point c. To summarize, the decrease in demand decreases the equilibrium price to $6 and decreases 
the equilibrium quantity to 20,000 pizzas.

• Decrease in income. A decrease in income means that consumers have less to 
spend, so they buy a smaller quantity of each normal good.
• Increase in income. Consumers buy smaller quantities of an inferior good when 
their income increases.
• Decrease in the price of a substitute good. A decrease in the price of a sub-
stitute good such as tacos makes pizza more expensive relative to tacos, causing 
consumers to demand less pizza.
• Increase in the price of a complementary good. An increase in the price of 
a complementary good such as lemonade increases the cost of a lemonade-and-
pizza meal, decreasing the demand for pizza.

• Decrease in population. A decrease in the number of people means that there 
are fewer pizza consumers, so the market demand for pizza decreases.
• Shift in consumer tastes. When consumers’ preferences shift away from pizza 
in favor of other products, the demand for pizza decreases.
• Expectations of lower future prices. If consumers think next month’s pizza price 
will be lower than they had initially expected, they may buy a smaller quantity today, 
meaning the demand for pizza today will decrease.
A Decrease in Demand Decreases the Equilibrium Price
We can use Figure 4.9 to show how a decrease in demand affects the equilibrium price 
and equilibrium quantity. The decrease in the demand for pizza shifts the demand 
curve to the left, from D1 to D0. At the initial price of $8, there will be an excess sup-
ply, as indicated by points a and b: Producers are willing to sell 30,000 pizzas (point a), 
but given the lower demand consumers are willing to buy only 14,000 pizzas (point b). 
Producers want to sell 16,000 more pizzas than consumers are willing to buy, and the 
excess supply causes downward pressure on the price. As the price falls, the excess 
supply shrinks because the quantity demanded increases while the quantity supplied 
decreases. The supply curve intersects the new demand curve at point c, so the new 
equilibrium price is $6 (down from $8), and the new equilibrium quantity is 20,000 
pizzas (down from 30,000).

Chinese Demand and Pecan Prices
Applying the Concepts #4: How does a change in demand affect the equilibrium price?
Between 2006 and 2009, Chinese imports of U.S. pecans 
increased from 9 million pounds per year to 88 million pounds. 
The increase in demand from China is roughly 30 percent of 
the total annual crop. The increase in demand was caused in 
part by widespread reports in the Chinese media that pecans 
promote brain and cardiovascular health. As a result of the 
increase in demand, the equilibrium price of pecans increased 
by about 50 percent, increasing the price of pecan pie, a holiday 
­favorite.  Related to Exercises 4.6 and 4.10.

Market Effects of Changes in Supply
We’ve seen that changes in demand shift the demand curve and change the equilibrium 
price and quantity. In this part of the chapter, we see how changes on the supply side 
of the market affect the equilibrium price and equilibrium quantity. 
Change in Quantity Supplied versus Change in Supply
Earlier in the chapter we listed the variables that determine how much of a product 
firms are willing to sell. Of course, one of these variables is the price of the product. 
The supply curve shows the positive relationship between price and quantity, ceteris 
paribus. In Panel A of Figure 4.10, when the price increases from $6 to $8 we move 
along the supply curve from point a to point b, and the quantity of the product supplied 
increases. As noted earlier in the chapter, this is called a change in quantity supplied. Now 
we’re ready to take a closer look at the other variables that affect supply—including 
wages, material prices, and technology—and see how changes in these variables affect 
the supply curve and the market equilibrium.
If any of these other variables change, the relationship between price and ­quantity—
shown numerically in the supply schedule and graphically in the supply curve—will 
change. That means that we will have an entirely different supply schedule and a differ-
ent supply curve. In Panel B of Figure 4.10, this is shown as a shift of the entire supply 
curve from S1 to S2. In this case, the supply curve shifts downward and to the right:
• The shift to the right means that at any given price (e.g., $6), a larger quantity is 
produced (25,000 pizzas at point c, up from 20,000 at point a).
• The shift downward means that the price required to generate a particular quan-
tity of output is lower. For example, the new minimum supply price is just over 
$1 (point f), down from just over $2 (point e). Similarly, the price required to 
generate 20,000 pizzas is $5 (point d), down from $6 (point a).
To convey the idea that changes in these other variables change the supply curve, we say that 
a change in any of these variables causes a change in supply. 
Increases in Supply Shift the Supply Curve
What types of changes increase the supply of a product, shifting the supply curve 
downward and to the right? Consider first the effect of a decrease in the wage paid to 
pizza workers. A decrease in the wage will decrease the cost of producing pizza and 
shift the supply curve:
• Downward shift. When the cost of production decreases, the price required 
to generate any given quantity of pizza will decrease. In general, a lower wage 
means a lower marginal cost of production, so each firm needs a lower price to 
cover its production cost. In other words, the supply curve shifts downward.
• Rightward shift. The decrease in production costs makes pizza production more 
profitable at a given price, so producers will supply more at each price. In other 
words, the supply curve shifts to the right.
A decrease in the wage is just one example of a decrease in production costs that 
shifts the supply curve downward and to the right. These supply shifters are listed in 
Table 4.3. A reduction in the costs of materials (dough, cheese) or capital (pizza oven) 
decreases production costs, decreasing the price required to generate any particular 
quantity (downward shift) and increasing the quantity supplied at any particular price 
(rightward shift). An improvement in technology that allows the firm to economize on 
labor or material inputs cuts production costs and shifts the supply curve in a similar 
fashion. The technological improvement could be a new machine or a new way of doing 
business—a new layout for a factory or store, or a more efficient system of ordering 
inputs and distributing output. Finally, if a government subsidizes production by paying

the firm some amount for each unit produced, the net cost to the firm is lowered by the 
amount of the subsidy, and the supply curve shifts downward and to the right.
Two other possible sources of increases in supply are listed in Table 4.3. First, if 
firms believe that next month’s price will be lower than they had initially expected, they 
may try to sell more output now at this month’s relatively high price, increasing supply 
this month. Second, because the market supply is the sum of the quantities supplied 
by all producers, an increase in the number of producers will increase market supply.
▲  Figure 4.10  Change in Quantity Supplied versus Change in Supply
(A) A change in price causes a change in quantity supplied, a movement along a single supply curve. 
For example, an increase in price causes a move from point a to point b. (B) A change in supply 
(caused by a change in something other than the price of the product) shifts the entire supply curve. 
For example, an increase in supply shifts the supply curve from S1 to S2. For any given price (e.g., $6), 
a larger quantity is supplied (25,000 pizzas at point c instead of 20,000 at point a). The price required to 
generate any given quantity decreases. For example, the price required to generate 20,000 pizzas drops 
from $6 (point a) to $5 (point d).

As summarized in Table 4.3, the language of shifting supply is a bit tricky. An 
increase in supply is represented graphically by a shift to the right (a larger quantity 
supplied at each price) and down (a lower price required to generate a particular quan-
tity). The best way to remember this is to recognize that the increase in “increase in 
supply” refers to the increase in quantity supplied at a particular price—the horizontal 
shift of the supply curve to the right.
An Increase in Supply Decreases the Equilibrium Price
We can use Figure 4.11 to show the effects of an increase in supply on the equilibrium 
price and equilibrium quantity. An increase in the supply of pizza shifts the supply curve 
to the right, from S1 to S2. At the initial price of $8, the quantity supplied increases 
from 30,000 pizzas (point a) to 46,000 (point b).
▲  Figure 4.11  An Increase in Supply Decreases the Equilibrium Price
MyLab Economics Real-time data
An increase in supply shifts the supply curve to the right: At each price, the quantity supplied increases. 
At the initial price ($8), there is excess supply, with the quantity supplied (point b) exceeding the quantity 
demanded (point a). The excess supply causes the price to drop, and equilibrium is restored at point c. 
To summarize, the increase in supply decreases the equilibrium price to $6 and increases the equilibrium 
quantity to 36,000 pizzas.

The shift of the supply curve causes excess supply that eventually decreases the 
equilibrium price. At the initial price of $8 (the equilibrium price with the initial sup-
ply curve), there will be an excess supply, as indicated by points a and b: Producers are 
willing to sell 46,000 pizzas (point b), but consumers are willing to buy only 30,000 
(point a). Producers want to sell 16,000 more pizzas than consumers are willing to 
buy, and the excess supply causes pressure to decrease the price. As the price decreases, 
the excess supply shrinks because the quantity supplied decreases while the quantity 
demanded increases. The new supply curve intersects the demand curve at point c, so 
the new equilibrium price is $6 (down from $8) and the new equilibrium quantity is 
36,000 pizzas (up from 30,000).
Decreases in Supply Shift the Supply Curve
Consider next the changes that cause a decrease in supply. As shown in Table 4.4, 
anything that increases a firm’s production costs will decrease supply. An increase 
in production cost increases the price required to generate a particular quantity (an 
upward shift of the supply curve) and decreases the quantity supplied at each price (a 
leftward shift). Production costs will increase as a result of an increase in the wage, an 
increase in the price of materials or capital, or a tax on each unit produced. As we saw 
earlier, the language linking changes in supply and the shifts of the supply curve is 
tricky. In the case of a decrease in supply, the decrease refers to the change in quantity 
at a particular price—the horizontal shift of the supply curve to the left.

Table 4.4  Changes in Supply Shift the Supply Curve Upward and to the Left
A decrease in supply could occur for two other reasons. First, if firms believe next 
month’s pizza price will be higher than they had initially expected, they may be willing 
to sell a smaller quantity today and a larger quantity next month. That means that the 
supply of pizza today will decrease. Second, because the market supply is the sum of the 
quantities supplied by all producers, a decrease in the number of producers will decrease 
market supply, shifting the supply curve to the left.
A Decrease in Supply Increases the Equilibrium Price
We can use Figure 4.12 to show the effects of a decrease in supply on the equilibrium 
price and equilibrium quantity. A decrease in the supply of pizza shifts the supply curve 
to the left, from S1 to S0. At the initial price of $8 (the equilibrium price with the initial 
supply curve), there will be an excess demand, as indicated by points a and b: Consumers

are willing to buy 30,000 pizzas (point a), but producers are willing to sell only 14,000 
pizzas (point b). Consumers want to buy 16,000 more pizzas than producers are will-
ing to sell, and the excess demand causes upward pressure on the price. As the price 
increases, the excess demand shrinks because the quantity demanded decreases while 
the quantity supplied increases. The new supply curve intersects the demand curve 
at point c, so the new equilibrium price is $10 (up from $8), and the new equilibrium 
quantity is 24,000 pizzas (down from 30,000).
Simultaneous Changes in Demand and Supply
What happens to the equilibrium price and quantity when both demand and supply 
increase? It depends on which change is larger. In Panel A of Figure 4.13, the increase 
in demand is larger than the increase in supply, meaning the demand curve shifts by 
a larger amount than the supply curve. The market equilibrium moves from point a 
to point b, and the equilibrium price increases from $8 to $9. This is sensible because 
an increase in demand tends to pull the price up, while an increase in supply tends to 
push the price down. If demand increases by a larger amount, the upward pull will be 
stronger than the downward push, and the price will rise.
We can be certain that when demand and supply both increase, the equilibrium 
quantity will increase. That’s because both changes tend to increase the equilibrium 
quantity. In Panel A of Figure 4.13, the equilibrium quantity increases from 30,000 to 
44,000 pizzas.
Panel B of Figure 4.13 shows what happens when the increase in supply is larger 
than the increase in demand. The equilibrium moves from point a to point c, mean-
ing that the price falls from $8 to $7. This is sensible because the downward pull on 
the price resulting from the increase in supply is stronger than the upward pull from 
the increase in demand. As expected, the equilibrium quantity rises from 30,000 to 
45,000 pizzas.
▲  Figure 4.12  A Decrease in Supply Increases the Equilibrium Price
A decrease in supply shifts the supply curve to the left. At each price, the quantity supplied decreases. 
At the initial price ($8), there is excess demand, with the quantity demanded (point a) exceeding the 
quantity supplied (point b). The excess demand causes the price to rise, and equilibrium is restored at 
point c. To summarize, the decrease in supply increases the equilibrium price to $10 and decreases the 
equilibrium quantity to 24,000 pizzas.

What about simultaneous decreases in demand and supply? In this case, the equilib-
rium quantity will certainly fall because both changes tend to decrease the equilibrium 
quantity. The effect on the equilibrium price depends on which change is larger, the 
decrease in demand, which pushes the price downward, or the decrease in supply, which 
pulls the price upward. If the decrease in demand is larger, the price will fall because the 
force pushing the price down will be stronger than the force pulling it up. In contrast, 
if the decrease in supply is larger, the price will rise because the force pulling the price 
up will be stronger than the force pushing it down.

Predicting and Explaining Market Changes
We’ve used the model of demand and supply to show how equilibrium prices are deter-
mined and how changes in demand and supply affect equilibrium prices and quantities. 
Table 4.5 summarizes what we’ve learned about how changes in demand and supply 
affect equilibrium prices and quantities:
• When demand changes and the demand curve shifts, price and quantity change 
in the same direction: When demand increases, both price and quantity increase; 
when demand decreases, both price and quantity decrease.
• When supply changes and the supply curve shifts, price and quantity change in 
opposite directions: When supply increases, the price decreases but the quantity 
increases; when supply decreases, the price increases but the quantity decreases.

Table 4.5  Market Effects of Changes in Demand or Supply
We can use these lessons about demand and supply to predict the effects of various 
events on the equilibrium price and equilibrium quantity of a product.
We can also use the lessons listed in Table 4.5 to explain the reasons for changes in 
prices or quantities. Suppose we observe changes in the equilibrium price and quantity 

114
of a particular good, but we don’t know what caused these changes. Perhaps it was a 
change in demand, or maybe it was a change in supply. We can use the information 
in Table 4.5 to work backward, using what we’ve observed about changes in prices 
and quantities to determine which side of the market—demand or supply—caused the 
changes:
• If the equilibrium price and quantity move in the same direction, the changes 
were caused by a change in demand.
• If the equilibrium price and quantity move in opposite directions, the changes 
were caused by a change in supply.
In this chapter, we’ve seen 
how demand and ­supply 
determine prices. We also 
learned 
how 
to 
predict 
the effects of changes in 
demand or supply on prices 
and quantities. Here are the 
main points of the chapter:
1.	 A market demand curve shows the relationship between the 
quantity demanded and price, ceteris paribus.
2.	 A market supply curve shows the relationship between the quan-
tity supplied and price, ceteris paribus.
3.	 Equilibrium in a market is shown by the intersection of the 
demand curve and the supply curve. When a market reaches 
equilibrium, there is no pressure to change the price.
4.	 A change in demand changes price and quantity in the same 
direction: An increase in demand increases the equilibrium price 
and quantity; a decrease in demand decreases the equilibrium 
price and quantity.
5.	 A change in supply changes price and quantity in opposite 
directions: An increase in supply decreases price and increases 
quantity; a decrease in supply increases price and decreases 
quantity.

Why Lower Drug Prices?
Applying the Concepts # 6: What explains a decrease in price?
But according to the U.S. Department of Justice, the quantity 
of drugs consumed actually decreased during the period of 
dropping prices. Therefore, the correct explanation of lower 
prices is the second case—decrease in demand. In this case, 
lower demand—not a failure of the government’s drug policy—
was responsible for the decrease in drug prices.  Related to 
­Exercises 6.5 and 6.13.
SOURCES: Kenneth R. Clark, “Legalize Drugs. A Case for Koppel,” Chicago 
­Tribune, August 30, 1988, sec. 5, p. 8; U.S. Department of Justice, “Drugs, Crime, 
and the Justice System” (Washington, DC: U.S. Government Printing Office, 1992), 
p. 30.
Ted Koppel, host of the ABC news program Nightline, once 
said, “Do you know what’s happened to the price of drugs in 
the United States? The price of cocaine, way down, the price 
of marijuana, way down. You don’t have to be an expert in eco-
nomics to know that when the price goes down, it means more 
stuff is coming in. That’s supply and demand.” According to 
Koppel, the price of drugs dropped because the government’s 
efforts to control the supply of illegal drugs had failed. In other 
words, the lower price resulted from an increase in supply.
Is Koppel’s economic detective work sound? In Table 4.5, 
Koppel’s explanation of lower prices is the third case—increase 
in supply. This is the correct explanation only if a decrease in 
price is accompanied by an increase in the equilibrium quantity.

Market Equilibrium
This simple experiment takes about 20 minutes. We start by dividing 
the class into two equal groups: consumers and producers.
• The instructor provides each consumer with a number 
indicating the maximum amount he or she is willing to 
pay (WTP) for a bushel of apples: The WTP is a number 
between $1 and $100. Each consumer has the opportu-
nity to buy one bushel of apples per trading period. The 
consumer’s score for a single trading period equals the 
gap between the WTP and the price actually paid for 
apples. For example, if the consumer’s WTP is $80 and 
he or she pays only $30 for apples, the consumer’s score 
is $50. Each consumer has the option of not buying ap-
ples. This will be sensible if the best price the consumer 
can get exceeds the WTP. If the consumer does not buy 
apples, his or her score will be zero.
• The instructor provides each producer with a number 
indicating the cost of producing a bushel of apples (a 
number between $1 and $100). Each producer has the 
opportunity to sell one bushel per trading period. The 
producer’s score for a single trading period equals the 
gap between the selling prices and the cost of producing 
apples. So if a producer sells apples for $20, and the cost 
is only $15, the producer’s score is $5. Producers have 
the option of not selling apples, which is sensible if the 
Economic Experiment
best price the producer can get is less than the cost. If 
the producer does not sell apples, his or her score is zero.
Once everyone understands the rules, consumers and 
producers meet in a trading area to arrange transactions. A 
consumer may announce how much he or she is willing to 
pay for apples and wait for a producer to agree to sell apples 
at that price. Alternatively, a producer may announce how 
much he or she is willing accept for apples and wait for a 
consumer to agree to buy apples at that price. Once a trans-
action has been arranged, the consumer and producer inform 
the instructor of the trade, record the transaction, and leave 
the trading area.
Several trading periods are conducted, each of which 
lasts a few minutes. After the end of each trading period, 
the instructor lists the prices at which apples sold during 
the period. Then another trading period starts, providing 
consumers and producers another opportunity to buy or sell 
apples. After all the trading periods have been completed, 
each participant computes his or her score by adding the 
scores from the trading periods.

Measuring a Nation’s 
Production and Income
5
C h a p t e r
As the economy recovered 
from the last recession, 
business writers, economists, 
and politicians anxiously 
awaited the news from the 
government about the latest 
economic developments.
They pored over the data to determine if the 
economy was beginning to recover from its 
doldrums and when more robust economic 
activity would resume.
At the same time, a distinguished group of 
economists, led by Nobel Laureates Joseph 
Stiglitz and Amartya Sen and French economist Jean-Paul Fitoussi, issued a report calling for major revision in the 
way we measure economic performance. They suggested that our government statisticians focus more on how 
much we consume and how much leisure we enjoy, and not solely on what we produce. They also suggested that 
we should be more concerned about whether our current activities are sustainable over the long run, perhaps rec-
ognizing environmental constraints.
But perhaps their most radical suggestion was that we switch our focus away from economic production to 
measuring people’s economic well-being. This could include examining the diets and living conditions of the poorest 
people. For residents of developed countries, this might involve analyzing surveys of people’s reported happiness 
with their own lives.
These changes, however, may be far in the future. Economists and businesses will still rely for some time on the 
traditional measures of economic activity that we study in this chapter.

Chapter 5 • Measuring a Nation’s Production and Income
121
T
his chapter begins your study of macroeconomics: the branch of economics 
that deals with a nation’s economy as a whole. Macroeconomics focuses on the 
economic issues—unemployment, inflation, growth, trade, and the gross 
domestic product—that are most often discussed in newspapers, on the radio and televi-
sion, and on the Internet.
Macroeconomic issues lie at the heart of political debates. In fact, all presiden-
tial candidates learn a quick lesson in macroeconomics. Namely, their prospects for 
reelection will depend on how well the economy performs during their term in office. 
If voters believe the economy has performed well, the president will be reelected. 
Democrat Jimmy Carter as well as Republican George H. W. Bush failed in their bids 
for reelection in 1980 and 1992, respectively, partly because of voters’ macroeconomic 
concerns. Both Republican Ronald Reagan in 1984 and Democrat Bill Clinton in 1996 
won reelection easily because voters believed the economy was performing well in their 
first terms. Although he took office during a deep recession, the economic recovery 
was well underway when Barack Obama was reelected in 2012. Public opinion polling 
shows that presidential popularity rises and falls with the performance of the economy.
Macroeconomic events profoundly affect our everyday lives. For example, if the 
economy fails to create enough jobs, workers will become unemployed throughout the 
country, and millions of lives will be disrupted. Similarly, slow economic growth means 
that living standards will not increase rapidly. If prices for goods begin rising rapidly, 
some people will find it difficult to maintain their lifestyles.
This chapter and the next introduce you to the concepts you need to understand 
what macroeconomics is all about. In this chapter, we focus on a nation’s production 
and income. We learn how economists measure the income and production for an 
entire country and how they use these measures. In the next chapter, we look carefully 
at unemployment and inflation. Both chapters explain the terms the media often uses 
when reporting economic information.
Macroeconomics focuses on two basic issues: long-run economic growth and 
economic fluctuations. We need to understand what happens during the long run to 
understand the factors behind the rise in living standards in modern economies. Today, 
living standards are much higher in the United States than they were for our grandpar-
ents. Living standards are also much higher than those of millions of people through-
out the globe. Although living standards have improved over time, the economy has 
not always grown smoothly. Economic performance has fluctuated over time. During 
periods of slow economic growth, not enough jobs are created, and large numbers of 
workers become unemployed. Both the public and policymakers become concerned 
about the lack of jobs and the increase in unemployment.
At other times, unemployment may not be a problem, but we become concerned 
that the prices of everything that we buy seem to increase rapidly. Sustained increases 
in prices are called inflation. We explore inflation in the next chapter.
The “Flip” Sides of Macroeconomic Activity: 
Production and Income
Before we can study growth and fluctuations, we need to have a basic vocabulary and 
understanding of some key concepts. We begin with the terms production and income 
because these are the “flip” sides of the macroeconomic “coin,” so to speak. Every day, 
men and women go off to work, where they produce or sell merchandise or provide 
services. At the end of the week or month, they return home with their paychecks or 
“income.” They spend some of that money on other products and services, which are 
produced by other people. In other words, production leads to income, and income 
leads to production.
But this chapter really isn’t about production and income of individuals in mar-
kets. That’s what a microeconomist studies. On the contrary, this chapter is about the 
production and income of the economy as a whole. From a “big picture” perspective, 
macroeconomics
The study of the nation’s economy as a 
whole; focuses on the issues of inflation, 
unemployment, and economic growth.

we look at certain measures that will tell us how much the economy is producing and 
how well it is growing. We will also be able to measure the total income generated 
in the economy and how this income flows back to workers and investors. These two 
measures—a country’s production and income—are critical to a nation’s economic 
health. Macroeconomists collect and analyze production and income data to under-
stand how many people will find jobs and whether their living standards are rising or 
falling. Government officials use the data and analysis to develop economic policies.
The Circular Flow of Production and Income
Let’s begin with a simple diagram known as the circular flow, shown in Figure 5.1. We 
start with a very simple economy that does not have a government or a foreign sector. 
Households and firms make transactions in two markets known as factor markets and 
product markets. In factor, or input, markets, households supply labor to firms. House-
holds are also the ultimate owners of firms, as well as of all the resources firms use in 
their production, which we call capital. Consequently, we can think of households as 
providing capital to firms—land, buildings, and equipment—to produce output. Prod-
uct, or output, markets are markets in which firms sell goods and services to consumers.
▲  Figure 5.1  The Circular Flow of Production and Income
The circular flow shows how the production of goods and services generates income for households 
and how households purchase goods and services produced by firms.
Households
Firms
Product market
Revenue
Goods sold
Goods bought
Purchases
Income paid to factors
Income paid to factors
Demand for factors
Supply for factors
Factor market
The point of the circular flow diagram is simple and fundamental: Production 
generates income. In factor markets, when households supply labor and capital to firms, 
they are compensated by the firms. They earn wages for their work, and they earn 
interest, dividends, and rents on the capital they supply to the firms. The households 
then use their income to purchase goods and services in the product markets. The 
firm uses the revenues it receives from the sale of its products to pay for the factors of 
production (land, labor, and capital).
When goods and services are produced, income flows throughout the economy. For 
example, consider a manufacturer of computers. At the same time the computer manu-
facturer produces and sells new computers, it also generates income through its produc-
tion. The computer manufacturer pays wages to workers, perhaps pays rent on offices 
and factory buildings, and pays interest on money it borrowed from a bank. Whatever is 
left over after paying for the cost of production is the firm’s profit, which is income to the 
owners of the firm. Wages, rents, interest, and profits are all different forms of income.
In an example with a government, your taxes pay for a school district to hire 
principals, teachers, and other staff to provide educational services to the students 
in your community. These educational services are an important part of production 
in our modern economy that produces both goods and services. At the same time, 
the principals, teachers, and staff all earn income through their employment with the 
school district. The school district may also rent buildings where classes are held and 
pay interest on borrowed funds.

Chapter 5 • Measuring a Nation’s Production and Income
123
Our goal is to understand both sides of this macroeconomic “coin”—the produc-
tion in the economy and the generation of income in the economy. In the United 
States, the national income and product accounts, published by the Department of 
Commerce, are the source for the key data on production and income in the economy. 
As we will see, we can measure the value of output produced in the economy by looking 
at either the production or income side of the economy. Let’s begin by learning how 
to measure the production for the entire economy.
The Production Approach: Measuring a Nation’s 
Macroeconomic Activity Using Gross Domestic Product
To measure the production of the entire economy, we need to combine an enormous 
array of goods and services—everything from new computers to NBA and WNBA 
basketball games. We can actually add computers to basketball games, as we could add 
apples and oranges if we were trying to determine the total monetary value of a fruit 
harvest. Our goal is to summarize the total production of an entire economy into a 
single number, which we call the gross domestic product (GDP). Gross domestic 
product is the total market value of all the final goods and services produced within an 
economy in a given year. GDP is also the most common measure of an economy’s total 
output. All the words in the GDP definition are important, so let’s analyze them.
“Total market value” means we take the quantity of goods produced, multiply 
them by their respective prices, and then add up the totals. If an economy produced 
two cars at $25,000 per car and three computers at $2,000 per computer, the total value 
of these goods will be
 2 cars * $25,000 per car = $50,000

The reason we multiply the goods by their prices is that we cannot simply add 
together the number of cars and the number of computers. Using prices allows us to 
express the value of everything in a common unit of measurement—in this case, dollars.

substantially less than its total sales. Based on Walmart’s annual 
reports, its cost of sales was $358 billion, leaving approximately 
$115 billion in value added. This is a very large number, as might 
be expected from the world’s largest retailer, but it is much 
smaller than its total sales. If we used Walmart’s sales to com-
pare it to a country, it would have a GDP similar to that of Tai-
wan, which is ranked 29th in the world. However, using the more 
appropriate measure of value added, Walmart’s size is closer 
to Angola, ranked 60th in the world.  Related to Exercise 3.9.

During 2014, Walmart’s sales were approximately $473 billion, 
nearly 2.7 percent of U.S. GDP. Some social commentators 
might want to measure the impact of Walmart just through its 
sales. But to produce those sales, Walmart had to buy goods 
from many other companies. Walmart’s value added was

(In countries other than the United States, we express the value in terms of the local 
currency.) We add apples and oranges together by finding out the value of both the 
apples and the oranges, as measured by what you would pay for them, and adding them 
up in terms of their prices.
“Final goods and services” in the definition of GDP means those goods and ser-
vices that are sold to ultimate, or final, purchasers. For example, the two cars that were 
produced would be final goods if they were sold to households or to a business. How-
ever, to produce the cars the automobile manufacturer bought steel that went into the 
body of the cars, and we do not count this steel as a final good or service in GDP. Steel 
is an example of an intermediate good, one that is used in the production process. An 
intermediate good is not considered a final good or service.
The reason we do not count intermediate goods as final goods is to avoid double-
counting. The price of the car already reflects the price of the steel contained in it. We 
do not want to count the steel twice. Similarly, the large volumes of paper a commercial 
printing firm uses also are intermediate goods because the paper becomes part of the 
final product delivered by the printing firm to its clients.
The final words in our definition of GDP are “in a given year.” GDP is expressed 
as a rate of production, that is, as “X” amount of dollars per year. In 2014, for example, 
GDP in the United States was $17,420 billion. Goods produced in prior years, such as 
cars or houses, are not included in GDP for a given year, even if one consumer sells a 
house or car to another in that year. Only newly produced products are included in GDP.
Because we measure GDP using the current prices for goods and services, GDP 
will increase if prices increase, even if the physical amount of goods that are produced 
remains the same. Suppose that next year the economy again produces two cars and 
three computers, but all the prices in the economy double: The price of cars is $50,000, 
and the price of computers is $4,000. GDP will also be twice as high, or $112,000, even 
though the quantity produced is the same as during the prior year:
 2 cars * $50,000 per car = $100,000
 +
 3 computers * $4,000 per computer = $12,000
 = $112,000
But to say that GDP has doubled would be misleading because exactly the same 
goods were produced. To avoid this problem, let’s apply the real-nominal principle, 
one of our five basic principles of economics.
intermediate goods
Goods used in the production process that 
are not final goods and services.

What matters to people is the real value of money or income—its 
purchasing power—not the face value of money or income.
What we need is another measure of total output that doesn’t increase just because 
prices increase. For this reason, economists have developed the concept of real GDP, 
a measure that controls for changes in prices. Later in this chapter, we explain how real 
GDP is calculated. The basic idea is simple. When we use current prices to measure 
GDP, we are using nominal GDP. Nominal GDP can increase for one of two reasons: 
Either the production of goods and services has increased, or the prices of those goods 
and services have increased.
To explain the concept of real GDP, we first need to look at a simple example. 
Suppose an economy produces a single good: computers. In year 1, 10 computers 
were produced, and each sold for $2,000. In year 2, 12 computers were produced, and 
each sold for $2,100. Nominal GDP is $20,000 in year 1 and $25,200 in year 2; it has 
increased by a factor of 1.26 or 26 percent. However, we can also measure real GDP by

Chapter 5 • Measuring a Nation’s Production and Income

using year 1 prices as a measure of what was produced in year 1 and what was produced 
in year 2. In year 1, real GDP is
10 computers * $2,000 per computer = $20,000
In year 2, real GDP (in year 1 terms) is
12 computers * $2,000 per computer = $24,000
Real GDP in year 2 is still greater than real GDP in year 1, now by a factor of 1.2, 
or 20 percent. The key idea is that we construct a measure using the same prices for 
both years and thereby take price changes into account.
Figure 5.2 plots real GDP for the U.S. economy for the years 1947 through 2013. 
The graph shows that real GDP has grown substantially over this period. This is what 
economists call economic growth—sustained increases in the real GDP of an econ-
omy over a long period of time. In Chapter 8, we study economic growth in detail. 
Later in this chapter, we look carefully at the behavior of real GDP over shorter peri-
ods, during which time it can rise and fall. Decreases in real GDP disrupt the economy 
greatly and lead to unemployment.

The Components of GDP
Economists divide GDP into four broad categories, each corresponding to different 
types of purchases represented in GDP:
1	 Consumption expenditures: purchases by consumers
2	 Private investment expenditures: purchases by firms
3	 Government purchases: purchases by federal, state, and local governments
4	 Net exports: net purchases by the foreign sector (domestic exports minus domestic 
imports)

part 2
126
Before discussing these categories, let’s look at some data for the U.S. economy to 
get a sense of the size of each of these four components. Table 5.1 shows the figures 
for GDP for the third quarter of 2014. (A quarter is a 3-month period; the first quar-
ter runs from January through March, while the third quarter runs from July through 
­September. Quarterly GDP expressed at annual rates is GDP for a year if the entire year 
were the same as the measured quarter.) In the third quarter of 2014, GDP was $17,560 
billion, or approximately $17.6 trillion. To get a sense of the magnitude, consider that 
the U.S. population is approximately 320 million people, making GDP per person 
approximately $54,875. (This does not mean every man, woman, and child actually 
spends $54,785, but it is a useful indicator of the productive strength of the economy.)

Table 5.1  Composition of U.S. GDP, Third Quarter 2014 (Billions of Dollars Expressed at 
Annual Rates)
Consumption Expenditures  Consumption expenditures are purchases by 
consumers of currently produced goods and services, either domestic or foreign. These 
purchases include flat-screen TVs, smartphones, automobiles, clothing, hairstyling 
services, jewelry, movie or basketball tickets, food, and all other consumer items. We 
can break down consumption into durable goods, nondurable goods, and services. 
Durable goods, such as automobiles or refrigerators, last for a long time. Nondurable 
goods, such as food, last for a short time. Services are work in which people play a promi-
nent role in delivery (such as a dentist filling a cavity). They range from manicures to 
health care and are the fastest-growing component of consumption in the United 
States. Overall, consumption spending is the most important component of GDP, 
constituting about 68 percent of total purchases.
Private Investment Expenditures  Private investment expenditures in 
GDP consist of three components:
1	 First, there is spending on new plants and equipment during the year. If a firm 
builds a new factory or purchases a new machine, the new factory or new machine 
is included in the year’s GDP. Purchasing an existing building or buying a used 
machine does not count in GDP, because the goods were not produced during 
the current year.
2	 Second, newly produced housing is included in investment spending. The sale of 
an existing home to a new owner is not counted because the house was not built 
in the current year.
3	 Finally, if firms add to their stock of inventories, the increase in inventories dur-
ing the current year is included in GDP. If a hardware store had $1,000 worth of 
nuts and bolts on its shelves at the beginning of the year and $1,100 at the year’s 
end, its inventory investment is $100 ($1,100 - $1,000). This $100 increase in 
inventory investment is included in GDP.
We call the total of new investment expenditures gross investment. During the 
year, some of the existing plant, equipment, and housing will deteriorate or wear out. 
This wear and tear is called depreciation, or sometimes a capital consumption allowance. 
If we subtract depreciation from gross investment, we obtain net investment.
Make sure you understand this distinction between gross investment and net 
investment. Consider the $2,905 billion in total investment spending for the third 
quarter of 2014, a period in which there was $2,108 billion in depreciation in the private 
consumption expenditures
Purchases of newly produced goods and 
services by households.

sector. That means there was only $797 billion ($2,905 - $2,108) in net investment 
by firms in that year; 73 percent of gross investment went to make up for depreciation 
of existing capital.
When we discuss measuring production in the GDP accounts, we use investment 
in a different way than that with which you may be accustomed. For an economist, 
investment in the GDP accounts means purchases of new final goods and services by 
firms. In everyday conversation, we may talk about investing in the stock market or 
investing in gold. Buying stock for $1,800 on the stock market is a purchase of an exist-
ing financial asset; it is not the purchase of new goods and services by firms. Therefore, 
that $1,800 does not appear anywhere in GDP. The same is true of purchasing a gold 
bar. In GDP accounting, investment denotes the purchase of new capital. Be careful 
not to confuse the common usage of investment with the definition of investment as we 
use it in the GDP accounts.
Government Purchases  Government purchases are the purchases of newly 
produced goods and services by federal, state, and local governments. They include any 
goods that the government purchases plus the wages and benefits of all government 
workers (paid when the government purchases their services as employees). Investment 
spending by government is also included. The majority of spending in this category 
comes from state and local governments: $1,986 billion of the total $3,209 billion in 
2014. Government purchases affect our lives very directly. For example, all salaries of 
U.S. postal employees and federal airport security personnel are counted as govern-
ment purchases.
This category does not include all spending by governments. It excludes transfer 
payments, payments to individuals that are not associated with the production of goods 
and services. For example, payments for Social Security, welfare, and interest on gov-
ernment debt are all considered transfer payments and thus are not included in govern-
ment purchases in GDP. Nothing is being produced by the recipients in return for 
money being paid, or “transferred,” to them. But wage payments to the police, postal 
workers, and the staff of the Internal Revenue Service are all included because they do 
correspond to services these workers are currently producing.
Because transfer payments are excluded from GDP, a vast portion of the budget 
of the federal government is not part of GDP. In 2014, the federal government spent 
approximately $3,506 billion, of which only $1,241 billion (about 35 percent) was 
counted as federal government purchases. Transfer payments are important, however, 
because they affect both the income of individuals and their consumption and savings 
behavior. Transfer payments also affect the size of the federal budget deficit, which 
we study in a later chapter. At this point, keep in mind the distinction between gov-
ernment purchases—which are included in GDP—and total government spending or 
expenditure—which may not be included.
Net Exports  To understand the role of the foreign sector, we first need to define 
three terms. Imports are goods and services we buy from other countries. Exports are 
goods and services made here and sold to other countries. Net exports are total exports 
minus total imports. In Table 5.1, we see that net exports in the third quarter of 2014 
were –$516 billion. Net exports were negative because our imports exceeded our 
exports.
Consumption, investment, and government purchases include all purchases by 
consumers, firms, and the government, whether or not the goods were produced in 
the United States. However, GDP is supposed to measure the goods produced in the 
United States. Consequently, we subtract purchases of foreign goods by consumers, 
firms, or the government when we calculate GDP because these goods were not pro-
duced in the United States. At the same time, we add to GDP any goods produced here 
and sold abroad, for example, airplanes made in the United States and sold in Europe. 
By including net exports as a component of GDP, we correctly measure U.S. produc-
tion by adding exports and subtracting imports.
Suppose someone in the United States buys a $25,000 car made in Japan. If we look 
at final purchases, we will see that consumption spending rose by $25,000 because a

consumer made a purchase of a consumption good. Net exports fell by $25,000, how-
ever, because we subtracted the value of the import (the car) from total exports. Notice 
that total GDP did not change with the purchase of the car. This is exactly what we 
want in this case because the car wasn’t produced in the United States.
Now suppose the United States sells a car for $22,000 to a resident of Spain. In 
this case, net exports increase by $22,000 because the car was a U.S. export. GDP will 
also be a corresponding $22,000 higher because this sale represents U.S. production.
Recall that for the United States in the third quarter of 2014 net exports were 
-$516 billion. In other words, in that quarter the United States bought $516 billion 
more goods from abroad than it sold abroad. When we buy more goods from abroad 
than we sell, we have a trade deficit. A trade surplus occurs when our exports exceed 
our imports. Figure 5.3 shows the U.S. trade surplus as a share of GDP from 1960 to 
2014. Although at times the United States has had a small trade surplus, it has generally 
run a trade deficit. In recent years, the trade deficit has increased and has fluctuated 
between 2 and 6 percent of GDP. In later chapters, we study how trade deficits can 
affect a country’s GDP.

indicates a surplus). However, in other years the United States has run a trade deficit. In 2004 through 
2006, the trade deficit exceeded 5 percent of GDP, although it most recently is near 3 percent of GDP.

Putting It All Together: The GDP Equation
We can summarize our discussion of who purchases GDP with a simple equation that 
combines the four components of GDP:
Y = C + I + G + NX
where
 Y = GDP
 C = Consumption
 I = Investment
 G = Government purchases
 NX = Net exports

Chapter 5 • Measuring a Nation’s Production and Income
129
In other words,
GDP = consumption + investment + government purchases + net exports
This equation is an identity, which means it is always true no matter what the 
values of the variables are. In any economy, GDP consists of the sum of its four 
­components.
The Income Approach: Measuring a Nation’s 
Macroeconomic Activity Using National Income
Recall from the circular flow that one person’s production ends up being another per-
son’s income. Income is the flip side of our macroeconomic “coin.” As a result, in 
addition to measuring a nation’s activity by measuring production, we can also gauge 
it by measuring a nation’s income. The total income earned by U.S. residents working 
in the United States and abroad is called national income.
Measuring National Income
To measure national income, economists first make two primary adjustments to GDP.
First, we add to GDP the net income earned by U.S. firms and residents abroad. 
To make this calculation, we add to GDP any income earned abroad by U.S. firms or 
residents and subtract any income earned in the United States by foreign firms or resi-
dents. For example, we add the profits earned by U.S. multinational corporations that 
are sent back to the United States but subtract the profits from multinational corpora-
tions operating in the United States that are sent back to their home countries. The 
profits Walmart sends back to the United States from its stores in Mexico are added 
to GDP. The profits Toyota earns in the United States that it sends back to Japan

Comparing Recoveries From Recessions
APPLYING THE CONCEPTS #2: How has the recovery from the most recent recession compared  
to recoveries from earlier recessions?
1990s, it was 16.7 percent; and after the recession in the early 
2000s, it was 15.8 percent.
What could explain the relatively slow growth following the 
recent recession? While the 2007 recession was severe, so was 
the recession in the early 1980s. Economists Carmen Reihart 
and Kenneth Rogoff have suggested that recessions caused by 
financial crises typically have slower recoveries; our last reces-
sion was caused by a financial crisis. They tend to disrupt every-
day life and households and firms take time to adjust. Whatever 
the explanation, real GDP has not grown rapidly in recent 
years as compared to other periods in U.S. history.  Related to 
­Exercises 5.6 and 5.7.

The most recent recession was both deep and very severe. In 
addition, the growth of the economy after the recession ended 
has been slower than in other recessions in recent U.S history.
From the end of the recession in 2009 through 2014—a 
5-year period—real GDP grew only 10.8 percent. In other reces-
sions, the total 5-year growth after the recession ended was 
typically much greater. After the recession in the early 1980s, 
real GDP grew 27.7 percent; after the recession in the early

are subtracted from GDP. The result of these adjustments is the total income earned 
worldwide by U.S. firms and residents. This is the gross national product (GNP).
The distinction between what they produce within their borders, GDP, and what 
their citizens earn, GNP, is not that important to most countries. For the United States, 
the difference between GDP and GNP is typically just 1 percent. In some countries, 
however, the differences are much larger. The country of Kuwait, for example, earned 
vast amounts of income from its oil riches, which it invested abroad in stocks, bonds, 
and other types of investments. These earnings comprised approximately 9 ­percent of 
Kuwait’s 2006 GNP. Foreigners have traditionally made large investments in Australia. 
As they sent their profits back to their home countries, Australia’s net income from 
abroad was negative in 2006, and Australian GDP in that year exceeded Australian 
GNP by 4.1 percent.
The second adjustment we make when calculating national income is to subtract 
depreciation from GNP. Recall that depreciation is the wear and tear on plant and 
equipment that occurred during the year. In a sense, our income is reduced because 
our buildings and machines are wearing out. After making these adjustments and taking 
into account statistical discrepancies, we reach national income. (Statistical discrepancies 
arise when government statisticians make their calculations using different sources of 
the same data.) Table 5.2 shows the effects of these adjustments for the third quarter 
of 2014.

Table 5.2  From GDP to National Income, Third Quarter 2014 (Billions of Dollars)
In turn, national income is divided among six basic categories: compensation of 
employees (wages and benefits), corporate profits, rental income, proprietors’ income 
(income of unincorporated business), net interest (interest payments received by house-
holds from business and from abroad), and other items. Approximately 61 percent of 
all national income goes to workers in the form of wages and benefits. For most of 
the countries in the world, wages and benefits are the largest part of national income.
In addition to national income, which measures the income earned in a given year 
by the entire private sector, we are sometimes interested in determining the total pay-
ments that flow directly into households, a concept known as personal income. To 
calculate personal income, we begin with national income and subtract any corporate 
profits that are retained by the corporation and not paid out as dividends to households. 
We also subtract all taxes on production and imports and social insurance taxes, which 
are payments for Social Security and Medicare. We then add any personal interest 
income received from the government and consumers and all transfer payments. The 
result is the total income available to households, or personal income. The amount of 
personal income that households retain after paying income taxes is called personal 
disposable income.
Measuring National Income through Value Added
Another way to measure national income is to look at the value added of each firm in 
the economy. For a firm, we can measure its value added by the dollar value of the 
firm’s sales minus the dollar value of the goods and services purchased from other firms. 
What remains is the sum of all the income—wages, profits, rents, and interest—that 
the firm generates. By adding up the value added for all the firms in the economy (plus 
nonprofit and governmental organizations), we can calculate national income. Let’s 
consider a simple example illustrated in Table 5.3.
Suppose an economy consists of two firms: an automobile firm that sells its cars 
to consumers and a steel firm that sells only to the automobile firm. If the automobile

of the goods and services purchased from 
other firms.

company sells a car for $16,000 to consumers and purchases $6,000 worth of steel from 
the steel firm, the auto firm has $10,000 remaining—its value added—which it can 
then distribute as wages, rents, interest, and profits. If the steel firm sells $6,000 worth 
of steel but does not purchase any inputs from other firms, its value added is $6,000, 
which it pays out in the form of wages, rents, interest, and profits. Total value added 
in the economy from both firms is $16,000 ($10,000 + $6,000), which is the sum of 
wages, rents, interest, and profits for the entire economy (consisting of these two firms).
As this example illustrates, we measure the value added for a typical firm by starting 
with the value of its total sales and subtracting the value of any inputs it purchases from 
other firms. The amount of income that remains is the firm’s value added, which is 
then distributed as wages, rents, interest, and profits. In calculating national income, we 
need to include all the firms in the economy, even the firms that produce intermediate 
goods.
An Expanded Circular Flow
Now that we have examined both production and income, including both the govern-
ment and the foreign sector, let’s take another look at a slightly more realistic circular 
flow. Figure 5.4 depicts a circular flow that includes both the government and the

foreign sector. Both households and firms pay taxes to the government. The govern-
ment, in turn, supplies goods and services in the product market and also purchases 
inputs—labor and capital—in the factor markets, just like private-sector firms do. 
Net exports, which can be positive or negative, are shown entering or leaving the 
product market.
In summary, we can look at GDP from two sides: We can ask who buys the output 
that is produced, or we can ask how the income that is created through the production 
process is divided between workers and investors. From the spending side, we saw that 
nearly 68 percent of GDP consists of consumer expenditures. From the income side, 
we saw that nearly 61 percent of national income is paid in wages and benefits. Mac-
roeconomists may use data based either on the production that occurs in the economy 
or on its flip side, the income that is generated, depending on whether they are more 
focused on current production or on current income.
A Closer Examination of Nominal and Real GDP
We have discussed different ways to measure the production of an economy, looking at 
both who purchases goods and services and the income it generates. Of all the measures 
we have discussed, GDP is the one most commonly used both by the public and by 
economists. Let’s take a closer look at it.

The Links Between Self-Reported Happiness and GDP
APPLYING THE CONCEPTS #3: Do increases in gross domestic product necessarily  
translate into improvements in the welfare of citizens?
At any point in time, however, money does appear to buy 
happiness. Holding other factors constant, individuals with 
higher incomes do report higher levels of personal satisfaction. 
But these “other factors” are quite important. Unemployment 
and divorce lead to sharply lower levels of satisfaction. Blanch-
flower and Oswald calculate that a stable marriage is worth 
$100,000 per year in terms of equivalent reported satisfaction.
Perhaps most interesting are their findings about trends in 
the relative happiness of different groups in our society. While 
whites report higher levels of happiness than African Americans, 
the gap has decreased over the last 30 years, as the happiness of 
African Americans has risen faster than that of whites. Men’s hap-
piness has risen relative to that of women over the last 30 years.
Finally, in recent work Blanchflower and Oswald looked at 
how happiness varies over the life cycle. Controlling for income, 
education, and other personal factors, they found that in the 
United States, happiness among men and women reaches a 
minimum at the ages of 49 and 45, respectively. Since these 
are also the years in which earnings are usually the highest, it 
does suggest that work takes its toll on happiness.  Related to 
Exercises 6.2 and 6.9.

Britain and the USA” (Working Paper No. 7847, National Bureau of Economic 
Research, January 2000) and “Is Well-being U-Shaped over the Life Cycle” (Work-
ing Paper No. 12935, February 2007).
Two economists, David Blanchflower of Dartmouth College and 
Andrew Oswald of Warwick University in the United Kingdom, 
have systematically analyzed surveys over a nearly 30-year 
period that ask individuals to describe themselves as “happy, 
pretty happy, or not too happy.” The results of their work are 
provocative. Over the last 30 years, reported levels of happi-
ness have declined slightly in the United States and remained 
relatively flat in the United Kingdom despite very large increases 
in per capita income in both countries. Could it be the increased 
stress of everyday life has taken its toll on our happiness despite 
the increase in income?

Measuring Real versus Nominal GDP
Output in the economy can increase from one year to the next. And prices can rise from 
one year to the next. Recall that we defined nominal GDP as GDP measured in current 
prices, and we defined real GDP as GDP adjusted for price changes.
Now we take a closer look at how real GDP is measured in modern economies. 
Let’s start with a simple economy in which there are only two goods—cars and 
­computers—produced in the years 2011 and 2012. The data for this economy—the 
prices and quantities produced for each year—are shown in Table 5.4. The production 
of cars and the production of computers increased, but the production of computers 
increased more rapidly. The price of cars rose, while the price of computers remained 
the same.
Let’s first calculate nominal GDP for this economy in each year. Nominal GDP 
is the total market value of goods and services produced in each year. Using the data 
in the table, we can see that nominal GDP for the year 2011 is
(4 cars * $10,000) + (1 computer * $5,000) = $45,000
Similarly, nominal GDP for the year 2012 is
(5 cars * $12,000) + (3 computers * $5,000) = $75,000
Now we find real GDP. To compute real GDP, we calculate GDP using constant 
prices. What prices should we use? For the moment, let’s use the prices for the year 
2011. Because we are using 2011 prices, real GDP and nominal GDP for 2011 are both 
equal to $45,000. But for 2012, they are different. In 2012, real GDP is
(5 cars * $10,000) + (3 computers * $5,000) = $65,000
Note that real GDP for 2012, which is $65,000, is less than nominal GDP for 2012, 
which is $75,000. The reason real GDP is less than nominal GDP here is that prices 
of cars rose by $2,000 between 2011 and 2012, and we are measuring GDP using 2011 
prices. We can measure real GDP for any other year simply by calculating GDP using 
constant prices.
We now calculate the growth in real GDP for this economy between 2011 and 
2012. Because real GDP was $45,000 in 2011 and $65,000 in 2012, real GDP grew 
by $20,000. In percentage terms, this is a $20,000 increase from the initial level of 
$45,000 or
Percentage growth in real GDP = $20,000
$45,000 = .444
which equals 44.4 percent. This percentage is an average of the growth rates for both 
goods—cars and computers.
Figure 5.5 depicts real and nominal GDP for the United States from 1950 to 
2014. Real GDP is measured in 2009 dollars, so the curves cross in 2009. Before 2009, 
nominal GDP is less than real GDP because prices in earlier years were lower than 
they were in 2009. After 2009, nominal GDP exceeds real GDP because prices in later 
years were higher than they were in 2009.

How to Use the GDP Deflator
We can also use the data in Table 5.4 to measure the changes in prices for this economy 
of cars and computers. The basic idea is that the differences between nominal GDP 
and real GDP for any year arise only because of changes in prices. So by comparing 
real GDP and nominal GDP, we can measure the changes in prices for the economy. 
In practice, we do this by creating an index, called the GDP deflator, that measures 
how prices of goods and services change over time. Because we are calculating real 
GDP using year 2011 prices, we will set the value of this index equal to 100 in the year 
2011, which we call the base year. To find the value of the GDP deflator for the year 
2012 (or other years), we use the following formula:
GDP Deflator = Nominal GDP
Real GDP
* 100

An index that measures how the prices 
of goods and services included in GDP 
change over time.

Using this formula, we find that the value of the GDP deflator for 2012 is
$75,000
$65,000 * 100 = 1.15 * 100 = 115
Because the value of the GDP deflator is 115 in 2012 and was 100 in the base year of 
2011, this means prices rose by 15 percent between the two years:
115 - 100
100
= 15
100 = 0.15
Note that this 15 percent is a weighted average of the price changes for the two goods—
cars and computers.
Until 1996, the Commerce Department, which produces the GDP figures, used 
these formulas to calculate real GDP and measure changes in prices. Economists at 
the department chose a base year and measured real GDP by using the prices in that 

Chapter 5 • Measuring a Nation’s Production and Income
135
base year. They also calculated the GDP deflator, just as we did, by taking the ratio 
of nominal GDP to real GDP. Today, the Commerce Department calculates real 
GDP and the price index for real GDP using a more complicated method. In our 
example, we measured real GDP using 2011 prices. But we could have also measured 
real GDP using prices from 2012. If we did, we would have come up with slightly 
different numbers both for the increase in prices between the two years and for the 
increase in real GDP. To avoid this problem, the Commerce Department now uses a 
chain-weighted index, which is a method for calculating price changes that takes an 
average of price changes using base years from consecutive years (that is, 2011 and 
2012 in our example). If you look online or at the data produced by the Commerce 
Department, you will see real GDP measured in chained dollars and a chain-type price 
index for GDP.
Fluctuations in GDP
As we have discussed, real GDP does not always grow smoothly—sometimes it col-
lapses suddenly, and the result is an economic downturn. We call such fluctuations 
business cycles. Let’s look at an example of a business cycle from the late 1980s and early 
1990s. Figure 5.6 plots real GDP for the United States from 2007 to 2009. Notice that 
in mid-1990, real GDP begins to fall. A recession is a period when real GDP falls for 
6 or more consecutive months. Economists talk more in terms of quarters of the year—
consecutive 3-month periods—than in terms of months. So they would say that a 
recession occurs when real GDP falls for two consecutive quarters. The date at which 
the recession starts—that is, when output starts to decline—is called the peak. The 
date at which it ends—that is, when output starts to increase again—is called the 
trough. In Figure 5.6, we see the peak and trough of the recession. After a trough, the 
economy enters a recovery period, or period of expansion.

From World War II through 2010, the United States experienced 11 recessions. 
Table 5.5 contains the dates of the peaks and troughs of each recession, the percent 
decline in real GDP from each peak to each trough, and the length of the recessions 
in months. The recession from 1973 to 1975, which started as a result of a sharp rise 
in world oil prices, was very severe. The recession from 2007 to 2009 was the worst 
downturn since World War II.
In the last three decades, there have been four recessions, three of them starting 
near the beginning of each of the decades: 1981, 1990, and 2001. In the 2001 recession, 
employment began to fall in March 2001, before the terrorist attack on the United 
States on September 11, 2001. The attack further disrupted economic activity and 
damaged producer and consumer confidence, and the economy tumbled through a 
recession. The recession that began in December 2007 followed a sharp decline in the 
housing sector and the financial difficulties associated with this decline. It deepened 
during the financial crisis that hit in September and October 2008. As credit became 
less available to both businesses and consumers, the effects of the financial crisis began 
to show up in reduced consumer spending for durable goods such as automobiles and 
reduced business investment.
Throughout the broader sweep of U.S. history, other downturns have occurred—20 
of them from 1860 up to World War II. Not all were particularly severe, and in some 
unemployment hardly changed. However, some economic downturns, such as those 
in 1893 and 1929, were severe.
Although we used the common definition of a recession as a period when real 
GDP falls for 6 months, in practice, a committee at the National Bureau of Economics 
Research (NBER)—a private research group in Cambridge, Massachusetts, of primarily 
academic economists—officially proclaims the beginning and end of recessions in the 
United States using a broader set of criteria than just GDP. The NBER’s formal defi-
nition is “a significant decline in economic activity, spread across the economy, lasting 
more than a few months, normally visible in production, employment, real income, 
and other indicators.” As you can see, it uses a wide variety of indicators to determine 
whether a recession has occurred and its length.
Depression is the common term for a severe recession. In the United States, the 
Great Depression refers to the years 1929 through 1933, the period when real GDP 
fell by over 33 percent. This drop in GDP created the most severe disruptions to ordi-
nary economic life in the United States during the twentieth century. Throughout the 
country and in much of the world, banks closed, businesses failed, and many people

lost their jobs and their life savings. Unemployment rose sharply. In 1933, over 25 
percent of people who were looking for work failed to find jobs.
Although the United States has not experienced a depression since that time, other 
countries have. In the last 20 years, several Asian countries (e.g., Thailand) and Latin 
American countries (e.g., Argentina) suffered severe economic disruptions that were 
true depressions.
GDP as a Measure of Welfare
GDP is our best measure of the value of output produced by an economy. As we have 
seen, we can use GDP and related indicators to measure economic growth within a 
country. We can also use GDP to compare the value of output across countries as well. 
Economists use GDP and related measures to determine if an economy has fallen into 
a recession or has entered into a depression. But while GDP is a very valuable measure 
of the health of an economy, it is not a perfect measure.
Shortcomings of GDP as a Measure of Welfare
There are several recognized flaws in the construction of GDP. We should thus be 
cautious in interpreting GDP as a measure of our economic well-being because it does 
not take into account housework and childcare, leisure, the underground economy, or 
pollution.
Housework and Childcare  First, GDP ignores transactions that do not take 
place in organized markets. The most important example is services—such as clean-
ing, cooking, and providing free childcare—that people do for themselves in their own 
homes. Because these services are not transferred through markets, GDP statisticians 
cannot measure them. If we included household production in GDP, measured GDP 
would be considerably higher than currently reported.
Leisure  Second, leisure time is not included in GDP because GDP is designed to 
be a measure of the production that occurs in the economy. To the extent that house-
holds value leisure, increases in leisure time will lead to higher social welfare, but not 
to higher GDP.
Underground Economy  Third, GDP ignores the underground economy, 
where transactions are not reported to official authorities. These transactions can be 
legal, but people don’t report the income they have generated because they want to 
avoid paying taxes on it. For example, wait staff may not report all their tips and own-
ers of flea markets may make under-the-table cash transactions with their customers. 
Illegal transactions, such as profits from the illegal drug trade, also result in unreported 
income. In the United States in 2005, the Internal Revenue Service estimated (based 
on tax returns from 2001) that about $310 billion in federal income taxes from the 
underground economy was not collected each year. If the federal income tax rate that 
applies to income evaded from taxes was about 20 percent, approximately $1.5 trillion 
($310/0.20) in income from the underground economy escaped the GDP accountants 
that year, or about 15 percent of GDP at the time.
Economists have used a variety of methods to estimate the extent of the under-
ground economy throughout the world. They typically find that the size of the under-
ground economy is much larger in developing countries than in developed countries. 
For example, in the highly developed countries, estimates of the underground economy 
are between 15 and 20 percent of reported or official GDP. However, in developing 
countries, estimates are closer to 40 percent of reported GDP. Table 5.6 contains 
estimates of the underground economy as a percent of reported GDP for different 
regions of the world.
Pollution  Fourth, GDP does not value changes in the environment that occur in 
the production of output. Suppose a factory produces $1,000 of output but pollutes a 
river and lowers its value by $2,000. Instead of recording a loss to society of $1,000, 
Learning Objective 5.6

138
GDP will show a $1,000 increase. This is an important limitation of GDP accounting 
as a measure of our economic well-being because changes in the environment affect our 
daily lives. Previous attempts by the Commerce Department to measure the effects of 
changes in environment by adding positive or subtracting negative changes to the envi-
ronment from national income did not yield major results. But they were limited and 
looked only at a very select part of the environment. Has our environment improved or 
deteriorated as we experienced economic growth? Finding the answer to this question 
will pose a real challenge for the next generation of economic statisticians.
Most of us would prefer to live in a country with a high standard of living, and few 
of us would want to experience poverty up close. But does a higher level of GDP really 
lead to more satisfaction?

In this chapter, we learned 
how economists and govern-
ment statisticians measure 
the income and production 
for an entire country and 
what these measures are 
used for. Developing mean-
ingful statistics for an entire 
economy is difficult. As we have seen, statistics can convey useful 
information—if they are used with care. Here are some of the main 
points to remember in this chapter:
1.	 The circular flow diagram shows how the production of goods 
and services generates income for households and how house-
holds purchase goods and services by firms. The expanded cir-
cular flow diagram includes government and the foreign sector.
2.	 Gross domestic product (GDP) is the market value of all final 
goods and services produced in a given year.
3.	 GDP consists of four components: consumption, investment, 
government purchases, and net exports. The following equation 
combines these components:
Y = C + I + G + NX
The GDP deflator is an index that measures how the prices of 
goods and services included in GDP change over time. The fol-
lowing equation helps us find the GDP deflator:
GDP Deflator = Nominal GDP
real GDP
* 100
4.	 National income is obtained from GDP by adding the net income 
U.S. individuals and firms earn from abroad, then subtracting 
depreciation.
5.	 Real GDP is calculated by using constant prices. The Commerce 
Department now uses methods that take an average using base 
years from neighboring years.
6.	 A recession is commonly defined as a 6-month consecutive 
period of negative growth. However, in the United States, the 
National Bureau of Economic Research uses a broader definition.
7.	 GDP does not include nonmarket transactions, leisure time, the 
underground economy, or changes to the environment.

government does not hire any long-term unem-
ployed workers, but gives them cash grants. Com-
paring the GDP statistics between the two otherwise 
identical economies, what can you determine about 
measured GDP and the actual level of output in each 
economy?
2.6	 Health-Care Subsidies. When the federal govern-
ment provides subsidies for individuals to buy health 
care, is this included in the federal budget? Is it 
included in GDP?
2.7	 Buying a Foreign Car. Explain why buying a foreign 
car made abroad for $50,000 increases consumption by 
$50,000 but does not increase GDP.
2.8	 Depreciation and Your New Car. You just bought 
a new car for $23,000. After a year, you decide that 
you need a slightly bigger car. But when you think 
about selling it, you can only get $19,000 for it. This 
is depreciation. Describe several reasons why your car 
has depreciation in value.
2.9	 Investment Spending versus Intermediate Goods. 
A publisher buys paper, ink, and computers to pro-
duce textbooks. Which of these purchases is included 
in investment spending? Which are intermediate 
goods?
The Income Approach: Measuring a Nation’s 
Macroeconomic Activity Using National Income
Describe the steps from GDP to income.
3.1	 What do we add to GDP to reach GNP?
a.	 Net income earned abroad by U.S. households
b.	Personal income
c.	 Depreciation
d.	Net exports
3.2	 If no foreign companies produce in a country, but many 
of the country’s companies produce abroad, then it is 
probably true that
a.	 the country’s GNP exceeds its GDP.
b.	the country’s GDP exceeds its GNP.
c.	 the country’s GNP and GDP are equal.
d.	the country’s GDP equals its domestic income.
3.3	 Personal income and personal disposable income 
refer to payments ultimately flowing to __________ 
(households/firms).
3.4	 The fact that the Nigerian oil industry is managed by 
large foreign corporations tends to make ­Nigeria’s 
__________ (GDP/GNP) exceed its __________ 
(GDP/GNP).
3.5	 Measuring Value Added for a Charity. A typical 
charity does not sell products but does generate value 
added. Explain one way you could measure its value 
added.
3.6	 Australian GNP and GDP. Australia contains many 
natural resources and foreign firms often come into 
Australia to extract them. The profits that those for-
eign firms make are sent back to their home countries. 
Explain how this affects the relationship between GNP 
and GDP for Australia. Which one is larger and why?
3.7	 Personal Income During Recessions. During the 
most recent recession, personal income fell by 2.8 per-
cent. This was the only time since 1950 that personal 
income has fallen during a recession. During a reces-
sion, transfer payments increase. Explain why this makes 
decreases in personal income rare. What does the data 
suggest about the severity of the most recent recession?
3.8	 Philippine Immigrants Abroad. Every year, the Phil-
ippines sends many workers abroad including nurses,

6.5	 Does Spending Measure Welfare? Suppose a com-
munity spends $1 million on salaries and equipment 
for its police department. Because it believes that citi-
zens are now more law-abiding, the community decides 
to cut back on the number of police it employs. As a 
result, the community now spends $800,000 less on 
police officers. The crime rate remains the same.

include this factor in its calculations?

a technique known as “fracking” where fluids are 
injected into wells in order to produce more natural 
gas. The reason given for banning fracking was that 

142
it caused environmental damage. How would you go 
about trying to measure whether this ban increased or 
decreased economic welfare?
6.8	 Europe versus the United States. In Europe, the 
average resident takes several weeks more of vacation 
time than in the United States. Per capita income, 
however, is higher in the United States than the Euro-
pean average. What can you say about relative eco-
nomic welfare in Europe versus the United States?
6.9	 Does Money Buy Happiness? Although people with 
high incomes appear to be happier than those with low 
incomes, people in the United States in general have 
become less happy over the last 30 years even though 
real GDP has risen. What are some of the reasons why 
the increase in real GDP does not always imply greater 
happiness? (Related to Application 3 on page 132.)
6.10	 Measuring Happiness across States. Suppose stat-
isticians find from survey data that the residents of 
California and Louisiana report that they are equally 
happy. However, incomes in California are higher, on 
average, than those in Louisiana. Could you make a 
case that living in Louisiana actually makes you happier 
than living in California?

Unemployment 
and Inflation

C h a p t e r
Should you move from Dallas, 
Texas, to Oakland, California, for 
a new job if the salary you are 
offered in California is higher?
Aside from any personal factors, you would like to know 
the relative cost of living in Oakland compared to Dal-
las. Fortunately, in 2014 the Bureau of Economic Anal-
ysis of the Department of Commerce began ­publishing 
in their official statistics data that compares the cost 
of living in states and metropolitan areas across the 
United States. These new indices are called “regional 
price parities” and can be used to compare the cost 
of living throughout the United States.
According to this data, in 2012, the index for the Dallas area was 101 whereas the index for the Oakland area was 
121.3. That means that the cost of living in the Oakland area was roughly 20 percent higher in Dallas. Unless your 
salary offer was at least 20 percent higher, your real earning power would fall if you moved from Dallas to Oakland.
You still might be able to afford to move to California if you lived somewhere else. In Merced, California, the index 
was only 95.8, more than 5 percent less than Dallas. So even if you had to accept a slightly lower salary to move to 
Merced, your real earning power could be higher. Up to now, only private firms that specialized in relocating execu-
tives supplied this information. Now, it is available to anyone who can access the data on the Web.

n this chapter, we look at unemployment and inflation, two key phenomena in 
macroeconomics. Losing a job is one of the most stressful experiences a person 
can suffer. For older adults, the fear that the purchasing power of their wealth will 
evaporate with inflation is also a source of deep concern.
We examine how economists define unemployment and inflation and the problems 
in measuring them. We also explore the various costs that unemployment and inflation 
impose on society. Once we have a basic understanding of what unemployment and 
inflation are, we will be able to investigate their causes further.
Examining Unemployment
When an economy performs poorly, it imposes costs on individuals and society. Recall 
from the last chapter that one of the key issues for macroeconomics is understanding 
fluctuations—the ups and downs of the economy. During periods of poor economic 
performance and slow economic growth, unemployment rises sharply and becomes 
a cause of public concern. During times of good economic performance and rapid 
economic growth, unemployment falls, but does not disappear. Our first task is to 
understand how economists and government statisticians measure unemployment and 
then learn to interpret what they measure.
How Is Unemployment Defined and Measured?
Let’s begin with some definitions. The unemployed are those individuals who do not 
currently have a job but who are actively looking for work. The phrase actively looking 
is critical. Individuals who looked for work in the past but who are not looking currently 
are not counted as unemployed. The employed are individuals who currently have jobs. 
Together, the unemployed and employed comprise the labor force:
labor force = employed + unemployed
The unemployment rate is the number of unemployed divided by the total labor 
force. This rate represents the percentage of the labor force unemployed and looking 
for work:
unemployment rate =
unemployed
labor force
* 100
Finally, we need to understand what is meant by the labor force participation 
rate, which is the labor force divided by the population 16 years of age and older. This 
rate represents the percentage of the population 16 years of age and older that is in the 
labor force:
labor force participation rate =
labor force
population 16 years and older * 100
To illustrate these concepts, suppose an economy consists of 200,000 individuals 
16 years of age and older. Of all these people, 122,000 are employed and 8,000 are 
unemployed. This means that 130,000 (122,000 + 8,000) people are in the labor force. 
The labor force participation rate is 0.65, or 65 percent (130,000/200,000), and the 
unemployment rate is 0.0615, or 6.15 percent (8,000/130,000).
Figure 6.1 helps to put these measurements into perspective for the U.S. economy. 
The total civilian population 16 years of age and older in January 2015 was 249,723,000 
individuals. We divide this population into two groups: those in the labor force (the 
employed plus the unemployed, totaling 157,180,000) and those outside the labor 
force (92,544,000). For this year, the labor force participation rate was 63 ­percent 
(157,180,000/249,723,000). As you can see, approximately two-thirds of the U.S. 
population participates in the labor force. Within the labor force, 148,201,000 were 
employed and 8,979,000 were unemployed. The unemployment rate was 5.7 percent

(8,979,000/157,180,000). Military personnel and prisoners are excluded from these 
measures.
One of the most important trends in the last 50 years has been the increase in the 
participation of women in the labor force. In 1948, the labor force participation rate 
for women 20 years and older was 32 percent. By 1970, it had grown to 43 percent, 
and by 1997 it had reached 60 percent. This trend reflected remarkable changes in our 
economy and society as women dramatically increased their presence in the workforce. 
In 2015, the participation rate for women had fallen to approximately 57 percent.

oped countries. Despite the fact these countries all have modern, industrial econo-
mies, notice the sharp differences in unemployment. For example, Spain had a

much government support is provided to unemployed workers. In countries in 
which support is the most generous, there is less incentive to work and unemploy-
ment will tend to be higher.
Alternative Measures of Unemployment  
and Why They Are Important
We defined the unemployed as those people who are looking for work but who do 
not currently have jobs. With that in mind, let’s take a closer look at our measures of 
unemployment.
It is relatively straightforward in principle to determine who is employed: Just 
count the people who are working. What is more difficult is to distinguish between 
those who are unemployed and those who are not in the labor force. How are these 
two groups distinguished? The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), which is part of the 
Department of Labor, interviews a large sample of households each month. The BLS 
asks about the employment situation of all household members 16 years of age and 
older. If someone in a household is not working, the interviewer asks whether the 
person is actively looking for work. If the answer is “yes,” he or she is classified as 
unemployed. If the answer is “no”—he or she is not actively looking for work—that 
person is classified as not being in the labor force.
The BLS measure of unemployment, however, does not capture all the employ-
ment experiences individuals face. Consider the cases of three individuals who want 
full-time jobs but do not have them: a steelworker who stopped looking for work 
because he felt there were no jobs, a young woman who did not seek work because 
she had no transportation to the workplace, and a computer programmer who worked 
only part time but sought full-time employment. None of them would be counted as 
unemployed in the official statistics—the first two are not included in the labor force 
and the third is counted as employed. Because of these limitations, in 1994 the BLS 
began to publish alternative statistics that reflect these circumstances.
Individuals who want to work and have searched for work in the prior year, but are 
not currently looking for work because they believe they won’t be able to find a job are 
called discouraged workers. Note that these individuals are not included in the official 
statistics because they are not currently looking for work.
In addition to discouraged workers, there are individuals who would like to work 
and have searched for work in the recent past, but have stopped looking for work for a 
variety of reasons. These individuals are known as marginally attached workers. Margin-
ally attached workers consist of two groups: discouraged workers (who left the labor 
force because they could not find jobs) and workers who are not looking for jobs for 
other reasons, including lack of transportation or childcare.
Finally, there are those workers who would like to be employed full time but hold 
part-time jobs. These individuals are counted as employed in the BLS statistics because 
they have a job. However, they would like to be working more hours. They are known 
as individuals working part time for economic reasons. We do not include in this category 
individuals who prefer part-time employment.
How important are these alternative measures? Figure 6.3 puts them into perspec-
tive. In January 2015, 8.98 million individuals were officially classified as unemployed. 
The number of discouraged workers was 0.67 million. Including the discouraged work-
ers, there were 2.20 million marginally attached workers. If we add the marginally 
attached individuals to those who were involuntarily working part time, the total is 9.01 
million. Thus, depending on the statistic you want to emphasize, there were anywhere 
between 8.98 million unemployed (the official number) and 17.99 million unemployed 
(the official number plus all those seeking full-time employment who did not have it). 
If we count those 17.99 million as unemployed and include the marginally attached in 
the labor force, the unemployment rate in 2015 would be 11.3 percent—substantially 
higher than the official rate of 5.7 percent. As we have seen, the official statistics for 
discouraged workers
Workers who left the labor force because 
they could not find jobs.

Chapter 6 • Unemployment and Inflation
147
unemployment do not include the full range of individuals who would like to partici-
pate fully in the labor market.
Who Are the Unemployed?
Another fact about unemployment is that different groups of people suffer more unem-
ployment than others. Figure 6.4 contains some unemployment statistics for selected 
groups for January 2015. Adults have substantially lower unemployment rates than 
teenagers. Minorities have higher unemployment rates. African American teenagers 
have extremely high unemployment rates. On average, men and women have similar 
unemployment rates, but the unemployment rates for married men and married women 
are lower than unemployment rates of women who maintain families alone.
These differentials do vary somewhat as GDP rises and falls. Teenage and minority 
unemployment rates often rise very sharply during poor economic times, as was the 
case in the most recent recession. In better times, a reduction of unemployment for all 
groups typically occurs. Nonetheless, teenage and minority unemployment remains 
relatively high at all times.
Many economic time series, including employment and unemployment, are sub-
stantially influenced by seasonal factors. These are recurring calendar-related effects 
caused by, for example, the weather, holidays, the opening and closing of schools, and 
related factors. Unemployment due to recurring calendar effects is called seasonal 
unemployment. Examples of seasonal unemployment include higher rates of unem-
ployment for farm workers and construction workers in the winter and higher unem-
ployment rates for teenagers in the early summer as they look for summer jobs.

Declining Labor Force Participation
Applying The Concepts #1: What factors account for the decline in the labor  
force participation rate in the last decade?
A recent study by the Federal Bank of Chicago suggested 
both factors were operative. Based on some statistical models, 
they estimated that about one-half of the decline in labor force 
participation was due to a longer run trend of increased retire-
ments from the baby boomers. The rest they attributed to the 
sluggish economy. The staff of the President’s Council of Eco-
nomic Advisers reached similar conclusions. They also estimated 
that one-half of the decline was due to the aging of the popula-
tion. But they were only able to explain some of the remainder 
through traditional business-cycle effects. They suggested that 
increased schooling, higher rates of individuals claiming disabil-
ity insurance, and the corrosive effects of long spells of unem-
ployment on the skills and work ethic of individuals may also be 
causing some of the measured decline.  Related to Exercise 1.8.
SOURCES: (1) “Explaining the Decline in the U.S. Labor Force Participation Rate,” 
Chicago Fed Letter no. 296 (March 2012). (2) Steven Braun, John Coglianese, 
Jason Furman, Betsey Stevenson, and Jim Stock, “Understanding the Decline in 
the Labor Force Participation Rate in the United States,” August 18, 2014, www.
voxeu.org/article/decline-labour-force-participation-us, accessed March 2015.
Since reaching a peak of 67.3 percent in 1999, the labor force 
participation rate has fallen to 62.9 percent by 2015. What can 
account for this decline?
Two factors have been prominently discussed by econo-
mists. The past decade experienced two recessions and low 
economic growth by historical standards. Perhaps a large num-
ber of individuals just decided that job prospects were too poor 
and left the labor force during this decade. An alternative expla-
nation focuses on the baby boomers—the generation born after 
1946. As this large generation ages, a significant number of the 
baby boomers will naturally retire and leave the labor force.

The BLS uses statistical procedures to remove these seasonal factors—that is, it 
seasonally adjusts the statistics—so that users of the data can more accurately inter-
pret underlying trends in the economy. The seasonally adjusted unemployment rates 
control for these predictable patterns, so those patterns aren’t reflected in the overall 
unemployment numbers.
Categories of Unemployment
To better understand the labor market, economists have found it very useful to break 
unemployment into a variety of categories. As we shall see, it is valuable to distinguish 
among the several different types of unemployment.
Types of Unemployment: Cyclical, Frictional, and Structural
After seasonally adjusting the unemployment statistics, we can divide unemploy-
ment into three other basic types: cyclical, frictional, and structural. By studying 
each type separately, we can gain insight into some of the causes of each type of 
unemployment.
The unemployment rate is closely tied to the overall fortunes of the economy. 
Unemployment rises sharply during periods when real GDP falls and decreases when 
real GDP grows rapidly. During periods of falling GDP, firms will not want to employ 
as many workers as they do in good times because they are not producing as many 
goods and services. Firms will lay off or fire some current workers and will be more 
reluctant to add new workers to their payrolls. The result will be fewer workers with 
jobs and rising unemployment. Economists call the unemployment that occurs during 
fluctuations in real GDP cyclical unemployment. Cyclical unemployment rises during 
periods when real GDP falls or grows at a slower-than-normal rate and decreases when 
the economy improves.
However, unemployment still exists even when the economy is growing. For exam-
ple, the unemployment rate in the United States has not fallen below 3.9 percent of the 
labor force since 1970. Unemployment that is not associated with economic fluctua-
tions is either frictional unemployment or structural unemployment.
Frictional unemployment is the unemployment that occurs naturally during the 
normal workings of an economy. It occurs because it simply takes time for people to 
find the right jobs and for employers to find the right people to hire. This happens 
when people change jobs, move across the country, get laid off from their current jobs 
and search for new opportunities, or take their time after they enter the labor force to 
find an appropriate job. Suppose that when you graduate from college, you take 
6 months to find a job you like. During the 6 months in which you are looking for a 
good job, you are among those unemployed who make up frictional unemployment. 
Searching for a job, however, makes good sense. It would not be wise to take the first 
job you were offered if it had low wages, poor benefits, and no future. Likewise, 
employers are wise to interview multiple applicants for jobs to find the best employees, 
even if it takes some time.
Could we eliminate unemployment by posting all job vacancies on the Internet 
along with the résumés of job seekers and automatically match them up with one 
another? It’s possible that such an automated system could shorten the duration of fric-
tional unemployment, but it wouldn’t eliminate it entirely. Some workers, for example, 
would prefer to continue searching for jobs in their own area rather than moving across 
the country to take the jobs they had been automatically matched with. Firms would 
also still want to scrutinize employees very carefully because hiring and training a 
worker is costly.
Structural unemployment occurs when the economy evolves. It occurs when 
different sectors give way to other sectors or certain jobs are eliminated while new types 
of jobs are created. For example, when the vinyl record industry gave way to the CD

music industry in the 1980s, some workers found themselves structurally unemployed, 
which meant they had to take the time to train themselves for jobs in different indus-
tries. Structural unemployment is more of a “permanent condition” than frictional 
unemployment.
The line between frictional unemployment and structural unemployment is some-
times hard to draw. Suppose a highly skilled software engineer is laid off because his 
company shuts down its headquarters in his area and moves his job overseas. The 
worker would like to find a comparable job, but only lower-wage work is available in 
his immediate geographic location. Jobs are available, but not his kind of job, and this 
high-tech company will never return to the area. Is this person’s unemployment fric-
tional or structural? There really is no correct answer. You might think of the software 
engineer as experiencing either frictional or structural unemployment. For all practical 
purposes, however, it does not matter which it is. The former software engineer is still 
unemployed.
The Natural Rate of Unemployment
Total unemployment in an economy is composed of all three types of unemployment: 
cyclical, frictional, and structural. The level of unemployment at which there is no 
cyclical unemployment is called the natural rate of unemployment, consisting of only 
frictional unemployment and structural unemployment. The natural rate of unemploy-
ment is the economist’s notion of what the rate of unemployment should be when there 
is full employment. It may seem strange to think that workers can be unemployed 
when the economy is at full employment. However, the economy actually needs some 
frictional unemployment to operate efficiently: It exists so that workers and firms find 
the right employment matches. An economy that lacks frictional unemployment will 
become stagnant.
In the United States today, economists estimate that the natural rate of unem-
ployment is between 5.0 and 6.5 percent. The natural rate of unemployment var-
ies over time and differs across countries. In Europe, for example, estimates of the 
natural rate of unemployment place it between 7 and 10 percent. In a later chapter, 
we explore why the natural rate of unemployment is higher in Europe than in the 
United States and why the natural rate of unemployment can vary over time in the 
same country.
The actual unemployment rate can be higher or lower than the natural rate of 
unemployment. During a period in which the real GDP fails to grow at its normal 
rate, there will be positive cyclical unemployment, and actual unemployment can far 
exceed the natural rate of unemployment. For example, in the United States in 2010 
unemployment was 9.6 percent of the labor force. As we pointed out in the previous 
chapter, a more extreme example occurred in 1933 during the Great Depression, when 
the unemployment rate reached 25 percent. When the economy grows very rapidly for 
a long period, actual unemployment can fall below the natural rate of unemployment. 
With sustained rapid economic growth, employers will be aggressive in hiring workers. 
During the late 1960s, unemployment rates fell below 4 percent, and the natural rate 
of unemployment was estimated to be over 5 percent. In this case, cyclical unemploy-
ment was negative.
Unemployment also fell to 4 percent in 2000. In this case, many economists 
believed that the natural rate of unemployment had fallen to close to 5 percent, so that 
cyclical unemployment in that year was negative.
Just as a car will overheat if the engine is overworked, so will the economy overheat 
if economic growth is too rapid. At low unemployment rates, firms will find it difficult 
to recruit workers, and competition among firms will lead to increases in wages. As 
wages increase, increases in prices soon follow. The sign of this overheating will be a 
general rise in prices for the entire economy, which we commonly call inflation. As we 
discuss in later chapters, when the actual unemployment rate falls below the natural 
rate of unemployment, inflation will increase.

The Costs of Unemployment
When there is excess unemployment—actual unemployment above the natural rate of 
unemployment—both society and individuals suffer economic loss. From a social point 
of view, excess unemployment means that the economy is no longer producing at its 
potential. The resulting loss of output can be very large. For example, in 1983, when 
the unemployment rate averaged 9.6 percent, typical estimates of the shortfall of GDP 
from potential were near 6 percent. Simply put, this meant that society was wasting 
6 percent of the total resources at its disposal.
To families with fixed obligations such as mortgage payments, the loss in income 
can bring immediate hardships. Unemployment insurance, payments received from 
the government upon becoming unemployed, can cushion the blow to some degree, 
but unemployment insurance is typically only temporary and does not replace a work-
er’s full earnings.
The effects of unemployment can also linger into the future. Workers who suffer 
from a prolonged period of unemployment are likely to lose some of their skills. For 
example, an unemployed stockbroker might be unaware of the latest developments 
and trends in financial markets. This lack of knowledge will make it more difficult for 
that person to find a job in the future. Economists who have studied the high rates 
of unemployment among young people in Europe point to the loss of both skills and 
good work habits (such as coming to work on time) as key factors leading to long-term 
unemployment.
The costs of unemployment are not simply financial. In our society, a person’s 
status and position are largely associated with the type of job the person holds. Losing 
a job can impose severe psychological costs. Some studies have found, for example, that 
increased crime, divorce, and suicide rates are associated with increased unemployment.

Less Unemployment Insurance, More Employment?
Applying The Concepts #2: Did reductions in unemployment insurance lead  
to more rapid growth in employment in 2014?
they could extend their unemployment benefits. States varied 
substantially in the number of weeks they offered. But after 
­December 2013, almost all states reduced their benefits to 
26 weeks. The three economists compared employment growth 
in high and low benefit states before and after this change 
using a variety of methods. They found that the states that 
had reduced benefits the most grew faster. They also refined 
their measures by looking at neighboring counties in different 
states—again, they found that states that cut their benefits the 
most had the highest growth in employment. According to the 
authors, virtually all the employment gains that occurred nation-
ally could be accounted for by the reductions in unemployment 
benefits. These results suggest that while unemployment insur-
ance increases can certainly help individual workers who lose 
their jobs, in the aggregate they also can decrease the total 
amount of employment in a society.  Related to Exercise 1.9.

Do higher unemployment insurance benefits lead to higher 
levels of unemployment? Higher unemployment benefits do 
reduce the incentive to search for new jobs and increase unem-
ployment. However, states that have higher unemployment to 
begin with may deliberately increase their benefits levels. Since 
unemployment insurance benefits and actual unemployment 
can move together for both of these reasons, it is difficult to 
untangle these two effects.
Economists Marcus Hagedorn, Kurt Mitman, and ­Iourii 
Manovskii used a sudden change in policy to address this 
question. Prior to December 2013, the federal government had 
provided subsidies to states to extend the number of weeks

Not all unemployment lasts a long period of time for individuals. Some unemploy-
ment is very short term. Table 6.1 shows the percent of unemployed by the duration or 
length of unemployment. In March 2015, approximately 29.3 percent of unemployed 
workers had been out of work less than 5 weeks. At the other end, 30.0 percent were 
unemployed 27 weeks or longer. During better economic times with lower overall 
unemployment, the percentage of short-term spells of unemployment increases and 
the percentage of long-term spells decreases. In the United States, unemployment is a 
mixture of both short- and long-term unemployment.

Although unemployment insurance can temporarily offset some of the financial 
costs of job loss, the presence of unemployment insurance also tends to increase the 
length of time that unemployed workers remain unemployed. The extra financial cush-
ion that unemployment insurance provides allows workers to remain unemployed a bit 
longer before obtaining another job. In other words, unemployment insurance actually 
leads to additional time spent unemployed.

Social Norms, Unemployment, And Perceived Happiness
Applying The Concepts #3: Are you less upset about being unemployed  
if unemployment is common in your peer group?
employed people become less happy if others around them 
became unemployed. But his interesting and somewhat sur-
prising finding was that, for men, becoming unemployed caused 
less of a decrease in perceived well-being if those in their peer 
group—family, household, or region—were also unemployed. 
In other words, misery loved company. It was better (or less 
worse) to be unemployed if others in their peer group were also 
unemployed.
Why did this matter? Clark also found that the more 
unhappy an individual was, the more aggressive he or she 
would be to try to find a new job. So, if your peer group is also 
unemployed, you may not be as aggressive in searching for 
work. Unemployment, therefore, may last longer for individuals 
in these circumstances.  Related to Exercise 3.5.

We know that individuals do not like to become unemployed. 
But how do feelings about becoming unemployed depend on the 
experiences of those around an individual? Economist Andrew 
E. Clark carefully examined the perceptions and the behavior of 
the unemployed in Great Britain over a 7-year period. He looked 
at the responses to survey questions by those individuals who 
became unemployed and constructed an index of their general 
happiness or well-being.
Clark found, as expected, that people’s perceived well-
being declined as they became unemployed, and also that

The Consumer Price Index and the Cost of Living
Suppose you were reading a book written in 1964 in which the main character received 
a starting salary of $5,000. Was that a high or low salary back then? To answer that, we 
need to know what $5,000 could purchase. Or, to put it another way, we need to know 
the value of the dollar—what a dollar would actually buy—in 1964. Only then could 
we begin to know whether this was a high or low salary.
Or take another example. In 1976, a new starting professor in economics received 
a salary of $15,000. In 2010, at the same university, a new starting professor received 
$90,000. Prices, of course, had risen in these 30 years, along with salaries. Which start-
ing professor had the better deal?
These examples are illustrations of one of our five principles of economics, the 
real-nominal principle.

Discuss how the Consumer Price Index 
is calculated.
R e a l- N o m i n a l  P r i n c i p l e
What matters to people is the real value of money or income—its 
purchasing power—not the face value of money or income.
Economists have developed a number of different measures to track the cost of liv-
ing over time. The best known of these measures is the Consumer Price Index (CPI).
The CPI is widely used to measure changes in the prices consumers face. It mea-
sures changes in prices of a fixed basket of goods—a collection of items chosen to rep-
resent the purchasing pattern of a typical consumer. We first find out how much this 
basket of goods costs in a given year. This is called the base year (it serves a similar 
purpose as the base year we designated for the GDP deflator). We then ask how much 
it costs in other years and measure changes in the cost of living relative to this base 
year. The CPI index for a given year, say year K, is defined as
CPI in year K =
cost of basket in year K
cost of basket in base year * 100
Suppose a basket of goods costs $200 in 1992, which we’ll define as the base year. 
In 2004, the same basket of goods is $250. First, the value for the CPI in 1992 (the 
base year) is
CPI in 1992 = 200
200 * 100 = 100
That is, the CPI for 1992 is 100. Note that the base year for the CPI will always equal 
100. Now let’s calculate the value of the CPI for 2004:
CPI in 2004 = 250
200 * 100 = 125
The CPI in 2004 is 125. The CPI rose from 100 in 1992 to 125 in 2004 in this 
example, a 25 percent increase in average prices over this 12-year period.
Here is how you would use this information. Suppose you had $300 in 1992. How 
much money would you need to be able to have the same standard of living in 2004? 
Find the answer by multiplying the $300 by the ratio of the CPI in 2004 to the CPI 
in 1992:
$300 * 125
100 = 375

fixed basket of goods chosen to represent 
the consumption pattern of a typical 
consumer.

part 2
154
You need $375 in 2004 just to maintain what was your standard of living in 1992. 
This is the type of calculation that economists do to evaluate changes in living standards 
over time.
How do we actually calculate the CPI in practice? Each month, the BLS sends its 
employees out to sample prices for over 90,000 specific items around the entire coun-
try. This is how they construct their representative basket of goods. Figure 6.5 shows 
the broad categories the BLS uses in the CPI and the importance of each category 
in household budgets. Rent and food and beverages account for 44 percent of total 
spending by households.
▲  Figure 6.5  Components of the Consumer Price Index (CPI)

The CPI versus the Chain Index for GDP
In the last chapter, we discussed measuring nominal GDP and real GDP. We also 
mentioned that since 1996 the Commerce Department has used a chain-weighted 
index (replacing the GDP deflator) to measure changes in prices for goods and services 
included in GDP. The chain-weighted index for GDP and the CPI are both measures 
of average prices for the economy, yet they differ in several ways.
First, the CPI measures the costs of a typical basket of goods for consumers. It 
includes goods produced in prior years (such as older cars) as well as imported goods. 
The chain-weighted price index for GDP does not measure price changes from either 
used goods or imports. The reason is that it is based on the calculation of GDP, which, 
as we’ve seen, measures only goods and services produced in the United States in the 
current year.
Second, unlike the chain-weighted price index for GDP, the CPI asks how much a 
fixed basket of goods costs in the current year compared to the cost of those same goods 
in a base year. Because consumers tend to buy less of goods whose prices rise, the CPI will 
tend to overstate true changes in the cost of living. For example, if the price of steak rises, 
consumers may switch to chicken and spend less on steak. But if the current basket of 
goods and services in the CPI includes steak, the CPI thinks the amount of higher-priced 
steak in the basket is the same as the amount of steak before its price increase. It does 
not allow the amount of steak in the index to decrease. Another measurement problem 
occurs when new products are introduced into the marketplace, again because the CPI 
measures a fixed basket of goods. The BLS will eventually adjust its “basket” to account 
for successful new products, but it takes some time.

Problems in Measuring Changes in Prices
Most economists believe that in reality all the indexes, including the chain-weighted 
index for GDP and the CPI, overstate actual changes in prices. In other words, the 
increase in prices is probably less than the reported indexes tell us. The principal reason 
for this overstatement is that we have a difficult time measuring quality improvements. 
Suppose the new computers sold to consumers become more powerful and more efficient 
each year. Suppose further that the dollar price of a new computer remains the same each 
year. Even though the price remains the same, the computers in later years are of much 
higher quality. If we looked simply at the price and did not take into account the change 
in quality, we would say there was no price change for computers. But in later years we 
are getting more computer power for the same price. If we failed to take the quality 
change into account, we would not see that the price of computer power has fallen.
Government statisticians do try to adjust for quality when they can. But quality 
changes are so common in our economy and products evolve so rapidly that it is impos-
sible to keep up with all that is occurring. As a result, most economists believe we 
overestimate the inflation rate by between 0.5 and 1.5 percent each year. This over-
statement has important consequences. Some government programs, such as Social 
Security, automatically increase payments when the CPI goes up. Some union contracts 
also have cost-of-living adjustments (COLAs), automatic wage changes based on the 
CPI. If the CPI overstates increases in the cost of living, the government and employers 
might be overpaying Social Security recipients and workers for changes in the cost 
of living.
Inflation
We have now looked at two different price indexes: the chain-weighted price index 
used for calculating real GDP and the Consumer Price Index. Using either price index, 
we can calculate the percentage rate of change of the index. The percentage rate of 
change of a price index is the inflation rate:
inflation rate = percentage rate of change of a price index
cost-of-living adjustments (COLAs)
Automatic increases in wages or other 
payments that are tied to the CPI.

The Introduction Of Cell Phones And The Bias In The Cpi
Applying The Concepts #4: How large is the bias in the CPI due to not immediately  
incorporating new goods?
Economist Jerry Hausman of MIT estimated the bias in the 
CPI caused by the failure to include cell phones in a timely man-
ner. He calculated that because of this delay, the telecommu-
nication component of the price index was biased upward by 
between 0.8 and 1.9 percent per year. In other words, instead of 
rising by 1.1 percent per year, telecommunication prices should 
have been falling by 0.8 percent per year. This is a significant bias.
But cell phones are not the only examples of the slow intro-
duction of goods into the CPI. The BLS also took 15 years to 
recognize room air conditioners in the CPI. Since new products 
are constantly invented and introduced, the bias in the CPI can 
be large.  Related to Exercise 4.9.
SOURCE: Based on Jerry Hausman, “Cellular Telephone, New Products, and the 
CPI,” Journal of Business and Economic Statistics 17, no. 2 (1999), pp. 186–194.
Today, it is hard to imagine a world without cell phones. Every 
college student and most high school students carry them 
everywhere. But cell phones were not introduced to the public 
until 1983, and it took 15 years, until 1998, before the Bureau of 
Labor Statistics included them in calculating the CPI!

part 2
156
Here is an example. Suppose a price index in a country was 200 in 1998 and 210 in 
1999. Then the inflation rate between 1998 and 1999 was
inflation rate = 210 - 200
200
= 0.05 = 5%
In other words, the country experienced a 5 percent inflation rate.
It is important to distinguish between the price level and the inflation rate. In 
everyday language, people sometimes confuse the level of prices with inflation. You 
might hear someone say inflation is high in San Francisco because rents for apartments 
are high, but this is not a correct use of the term inflation. Inflation refers not to the 
level of prices, whether they are high or low, but to their percentage change. If rents were 
high in San Francisco but remained constant over 2 years, there would be no inflation 
in rents there during that time.
Historical U.S. Inflation Rates
To gain some historical perspective, Figure 6.6 plots a price index for GDP from 1875 
to 2014 for the United States. As you can see from the figure, from 1875 to the period 
just before World War I, there was virtually no change in the price level. The price 
level rose during World War I, fell after the war ended, and also fell sharply during the 
early 1930s. However, the most pronounced feature of the figure is the sustained rise 
in prices beginning around the 1940s. Unlike the earlier periods, in which the price 
level did not have a trend, after 1940 the price level increased sharply. By 2014, the 
price level had increased by a factor of 14 over its value in 1940. Table 6.2 contains 
the prices of a few select goods from the 1940s and in 2014. Wouldn’t you like to buy 
a postage stamp today for $0.03?

The Perils of Deflation
Prices rarely fall today, but they have actually fallen at times in world history. You 
might think it would be great if prices fell and we had what economists term a ­deflation. 
It may surprise you, however, that we think you should hope deflation never occurs.
During the Great Depression, the United States underwent a severe deflation. 
Prices fell 33 percent on average, and wages fell along with prices. The biggest problem 
caused by a deflation is that people cannot repay their debts. Imagine you owe $40,000 
for your education and expect to be able to pay it off over several years if you earn 
$27,000 a year. If a massive deflation caused your wages to fall to $18,000, you might

forced to default on your loan, as millions of people did during the Great Depression.
In the 1990s, Japan experienced a deflation, although much milder than the Great 
Depression in the United States—only about 1 percent per year. Nonetheless, banks in 
Japan faced rocky economic times as borrowers, including large corporations, defaulted 
on their loans. With its banks in difficult shape, Japan’s economy has suffered. Its expe-
rience in the 1990s mirrored the experience of other countries throughout the world 
in the 1930s during the period of deflation.
The Costs of Inflation
Economists typically separate the costs of inflation into two categories. One includes 
costs associated with fully expected or anticipated inflation. The other includes costs 
associated with unexpected or unanticipated inflation. Although inflation causes both 
types of costs, it is convenient to discuss each case separately.
Anticipated Inflation
Let’s consider the costs of anticipated inflation first. Suppose the economy had been expe-
riencing 5 percent annual inflation for many years and everyone was fully adjusted to it.
Even in this case, inflation still has some costs. First, there are the actual physical costs 
of changing prices, which economists call menu costs. Restaurant owners, catalog produc-
ers, and any other business that must post prices will have to incur costs to physically 
change their prices because of inflation. For example, they will need to pay to reprint their 
menus or billboards. Economists believe these costs are relatively small for the economy.
Second, inflation will erode the value of the cash people hold. They will respond 
by holding less cash at any one time. If they hold less cash, they must visit the bank or 
their ATM more frequently because they will run out of cash sooner. Economists use 
the term shoe-leather costs to refer to the additional costs people incur to hold less 
cash. Economists who have estimated these costs find that they can be large, as much 
as 1 percent of GDP.
In practice, our tax and financial systems do not fully adjust even to anticipated 
inflation. It is difficult for the government and businesses to change their normal 
rules of operation every time inflation changes. As an example, consider the tax sys-
tem. Our tax system is typically based on nominal income, not real income. ­Suppose 
you own a stock in a corporation and its value increases by 5 percent during the 
year. If the inflation rate is also 5 percent a year, your stock did not increase in real 
terms—it just kept up with inflation. Nonetheless, if you sold your stock at the end 
of the year, you would be taxed on the full 5 percent gain, despite the fact that the 
real value of your stock did not increase. Inflation distorts the operation of our tax 
and financial system.
Unanticipated Inflation
What if inflation is unexpected? The cost of unexpected inflation is arbitrary redis-
tributions of income. Suppose you expected the inflation rate would be 5 percent and 
you negotiated a salary based on that expectation. On the one hand, if you miscalculate 
and the inflation rate turns out to be higher, the purchasing power of your wages will 
be less than you anticipated. Your employer will have gained at your expense. On the 
other hand, if the inflation rate turned out to be less than 5 percent, the purchasing 
power of your wage would be higher than you had anticipated. In this case, you would 
gain at the expense of the company. As long as the inflation rate differs from what is 
expected, there will be winners and losers.
These redistributions eventually impose real costs on the economy. Consider an 
analogy. Suppose you live in a very safe neighborhood where no one locks the doors. 
If a rash of burglaries (transfers between you and crooks) starts to occur, people will 
invest in locks, alarms, and more police. You and your community will incur real costs 
to prevent these arbitrary redistributions.

The same is true for unanticipated inflation. If a society experiences unanticipated 
inflation, individuals and institutions will change their behavior. For example, potential 
homeowners will not be able to borrow from banks at fixed rates of interest, but will be 
required to accept loans whose rates can be adjusted as inflation rates change. Banks do 
not want to lend money at a fixed interest rate if there is a strong likelihood that inflation 
will erode the real value of the income stream they expected. However, if banks become 
reluctant to make loans with fixed interest rates, this imposes more risk on homeowners.
What about the loans made prior to the unanticipated inflation? In this case, debtors 
will gain at the expense of creditors. Creditors, on the one hand, will lose because infla-
tion will erode the amount of money they planned to earn on the loans. But since the 
loans have already been made, there’s nothing they can do about it. Debtors, on the other 
hand, will get a deal. It will be easier for them to repay their loans with inflated dollars.
If unanticipated inflation becomes extreme, individuals will spend more of their 
time trying to profit from inflation rather than working at productive jobs. As inflation 
became more volatile in the late 1970s in the United States, many people devoted their 
time to speculation in real estate and commodity markets to try to beat inflation, and 
the economy became less efficient. Latin American countries that have experienced 
high and variable inflation rates know all too well these costs from inflation. Indeed, 
when inflation rates exceed 50 percent per month, we have what is called ­hyperinflation. 
Think about what an inflation rate of 50 percent a month means: If a can of soda costs 
$1.25 at the beginning of the year, it would cost $162.00 at the end of the year! In a 
later chapter, we study the causes of hyperinflation, but you can readily see that infla-
tion of this magnitude would seriously disrupt normal commerce.
Even in less extreme cases, the costs of inflation are compounded as inflation 
rises. At high inflation rates, these costs grow rapidly, and at some point policymakers 
are forced to take actions to reduce inflation. As we mentioned earlier, when unem-
ployment falls below the natural rate, inflation increases. Similarly, in later chapters 
we’ll see that stopping inflation may require unemployment to exceed its natural rate 
and even plunge an economy into a recession. Although unemployment and reces-
sions are quite costly to society, they sometimes become necessary in the face of high 
inflation.

An inflation rate exceeding 50 percent per 
month.
In this chapter, we continued 
our introduction to the basic 
concepts of macroeconom-
ics and explored the nature 
of both unemployment and 
inflation. We also looked at 
the complex issues involved 
in measuring unemployment 
and inflation as well as the costs of both to society. Here are the key 
points to remember:
1.	 The unemployed are individuals who do not have jobs but who 
are actively seeking employment. The labor force comprises both 
the employed and the unemployed. The unemployment rate is 
the percentage of the labor force that is unemployed:
unemployment rate = unemployed
labor force
* 100
2.	 Economists distinguish among different types of unemploy-
ment. Seasonal patterns of economic activity lead to seasonal 
unemployment. There are three other types of unemployment. 
Frictional unemployment occurs through the normal dynam-
ics of the economy as workers change jobs and industries 
expand and contract. Structural unemployment arises because 
of a mismatch of workers’ skills with job opportunities. Cycli-
cal unemployment occurs with the fluctuations in economic 
activity.
3.	 Unemployment rates vary across demographic groups. Alterna-
tive measures of unemployment take into account individuals 
who would like to work full time, but who are no longer in the 
labor force or are holding part-time jobs.
4.	 Economists measure changes in the cost of living through the 
Consumer Price Index (CPI), which is based on the cost of pur-
chasing a standard basket of goods and services. The CPI is 
Su mmary
Chapter Summary and Problems

used to measure changes in average prices over different periods 
of time. The CPI index for a given year, say year K, is defined as
CpI in year K =
cost of basket in year K
cost of basket in base year * 100
5.	 We measure inflation as the percentage change in the price level.
6.	 Economists believe that most price indexes, including the CPI 
and the chain-weighted index for GDP, overstate true inflation 
because they fail to capture quality improvements in goods and 
services.
7.	 Unemployment imposes both financial and psychological costs 
on workers.
8.	 Both anticipated and unanticipated inflation impose costs on 
society.

Examining Unemployment
Define these concepts: the labor force, the labor force 
participation rate, and the unemployment rate.
1.1	 Which of the following is not included in the labor 
force?
a.	 People who have full-time, but poorly paid jobs.
b.	Individuals who have sizable inheritances and do not 
want any jobs.
c.	 People who work 15 hours a week.
d.	17-year-olds who do not have jobs, but are actively 
searching for employment.
1.2	 Individuals who are working part time for economic 
reasons and would like to work full time are counted as 
unemployed in the traditional unemployment statistics. 
_________ (True/False)
1.3	 The labor force participation rate shows the percentage 
of the
a.	 labor force that has a job.
b.	labor force that is unemployed.
c.	 relevant population that is employed.
d.	relevant population that is in the labor force.
1.4	 What would happen to the measured unemployment 
rate if unemployed individuals left the labor force 
because they no longer believed they could get jobs?
1.5	 New Government Employment and True Unem-
ployment. Suppose that a government decides to 
acknowledge the importance of the labor performed 
by  homemakers and hires them under the category 
‘Government Home Workers’. It pays them mod-
est salaries and does not expect them to do any new 
work apart from their current chores. What will hap-
pen to the measured unemployment rate of the coun-
try? Under these circumstances, do changes in the 
measured unemployment rate accurately reflect any 
changes in the underlying economic situation and 
production?
1.6	 Part-Time Work. Paul and Karen are married. Karen 
works as a stockbroker while Paul works part time 
to take care of their kids at home. He is happy with 
this arrangement. Is Paul unemployed? Would he be 
counted as working part time for economic reasons?
1.7	 Calculating Data for the U.S. Economy. Here are 
some data for the U.S. economy for January 2014:
• 246.9 million individuals 16 years of age and older
• 145.2 million employed
• 10.3 million unemployed
	
Calculate the labor force, the labor force participation 
rate, and the unemployment rate for the U.S. economy. 
1.8	 Baby Boomers and Labor Force Participation. 
­Robert is age 62 and lost his job in an engineering firm. 
Pamela is 53 and also lost her job. What options do you 
think Robert has that Pamela does not? How might 
this affect labor force participation rates? (Related to 
Application 1 on page 148.)
All problems are assignable in MyLab Economics; exercises that update with real-time data are marked

1.9	 State Policy and Unemployment Insurance. Suppose 
that a state increases the length of time that the unem-
ployed can receive benefits because it is experiencing a 
recession. A journalist notices that employment in the 
state is falling at the same time as unemployment insur-
ance is increasing and writes that this proves that increases 
in unemployment insurance reduce employment. Is his 
reasoning correct? (Related to Application 2 on page 151.)
1.10	 Unemployment Rates in June. Raw, unadjusted data 
show virtually every year that the number of unem-
ployed rise in June. Why? Would this show up in sea-
sonally adjusted data?
1.11	 Alternative Unemployment Measures. An economy 
has 200,000,000 people employed, 5,000,000 unem-
ployed, and 3,000,000 marginally attached workers. 
What is the conventional measure of the unemploy-
ment rate? What would be the best alternative measure 
that takes into account the marginally attached workers?
1.12	 Discouraged Workers in Japan and the United 
States. Japan was concerned about a group of work-
ers called “NEETs,” which meant “not in education, 
employment, or training.” In the United States, we also 
have young, discouraged workers. Discuss the types of 
young, discouraged workers you would most likely find 
in the United States.
Categories of Unemployment
Distinguish between cyclical, structural, and frictional 
unemployment.
2.1	 The three key types of unemployment are cyclical, 
structural, and _________.
2.2	 The natural rate of unemployment consists solely of 
_________ and _________ unemployment.
2.3	 When the economy is at full employment, there is no 
cyclical unemployment. _________ (True/False)
2.4	 When online movies began to replace stores renting 
DVDs, what type or types of unemployment was created?
a.	 Structural and frictional
b.	Structural and cyclical
c.	 Frictional and cyclical
d.	Discouraged and cyclical
2.5	 Understanding Unemployment Differences 
across Countries. A student looking at Figure 6.2 on 
page 145 argues that Spain must have very high cyclical 
unemployment compared to Japan because the Spanish 
unemployment rate is so high. Explain why the student 
could be right or could be wrong.
2.6	 Technological Change and Unemployment. After 
the invention of the sound film, a significant number 
of actors lost their jobs in Hollywood because their 
voices or accents did not fit the format of the talkies. 
Similarly, the musicians who had been hired to play 
live music in theaters that played silent movies became 
unemployed. What type of unemployment did the two 
groups suffer from?
2.7	 Unemployment Rates in Large African Cities. In 
many African countries, the government and interna-
tional corporations pay high wages for jobs in the major 
cities, and many people migrate to the cities from farms 
where earnings are low. Unemployment rates in the 
city, therefore, are large. Can this be explained in terms 
of frictional unemployment? Why or why not?
2.8	 Falling Oil Prices and Frictional Unemployment. 
Explain how falling oil prices, which benefit some 
industries more than others, can affect frictional 
unemployment.
The Costs of Unemployment
Describe the costs of unemployment.
3.1	 In 2015, less than 20 percent of the unemployed in the 
United States were unemployed for a period shorter 
than 5 weeks. _________ (True/False)
3.2	 As most states in the United States replace the entire 
wages of individuals on unemployment insurance, 
the unemployed don’t have the incentive to find jobs. 
_________ (True/False)
3.3	 The effects of unemployment today may carry over 
into the future because
a.	 discouraged workers are not measured in the unem-
ployment rate.
b.	those that experience prolonged unemployment lose 
job skills that are difficult to recover.
c.	 a person must be actively seeking work to be counted 
as unemployed.
d.	None of the above
3.4	 In January 2015, more than 29 percent of the unem-
ployed had been unemployed less than _________ 
weeks.
3.5	 Understanding Peer Effects of Unemployment. 
You might think it would be worse if other people 
are unemployed at the same time as you were because 
it would be harder to find a job. But the psychologi-
cal evidence shows the opposite. Give a few reasons 
why unemployment may seem less painful to indi-
viduals if their peers are also unemployed. (Related to 
­Application 3 on page 152.)
3.6	 Long-Term Effects of Unemployment. Why might 
you expect individuals who were unemployed in their 
20s to have lower wages at the age of 40 than indi-
viduals with identical educational backgrounds but who 
were not unemployed?
3.7	 Duration of Unemployment. What do you think are 
the job prospects for workers who have been unem-
ployed for more than 2 years? Does the probability of 
them finding a job increase or decrease as time passes?

162
The Consumer Price Index and the Cost of Living
Discuss how the Consumer Price Index is calculated.
4.1	 The value of a price index in the base year is equal to 
_________.
4.2	 Economists believe that the CPI tends to overestimate 
the increase in the cost of living over time. _________. 
(True/False)
4.3	 Unlike the CPI, the chain-weighted price index for 
GDP does not include used goods or _________ goods.
4.4	 The single largest component of the basket of goods 
that comprises the CPI is the category for _________.
4.5	 Which Professor Is Better Off? The starting salary 
for a new assistant economics professor was $15,000 in 
1976 and $102,000 in 2014. The value of the CPI for 
2014 was 236.7, compared to 56.9 in 1976. In which 
year did a newly hired professor earn more in real 
terms?
4.6	 What Are Comparable Real Salaries? Suppose 
that in an economy, a job paid $42,000 in 2002. The 
­economy’s CPI in 1960 was 29.6, compared to 179.9 
in 2002. In 1960, what salary would be comparable to 
$42,000 in 2002 in real terms?
4.7	 High Prices and Inflation. Critically evaluate the fol-
lowing statement: “Tokyo is an expensive place to live. 
There must be a high inflation rate in Japan.” 
4.8	 What Does It Cost? The Bureau of Labor Statistics 
now makes price data available on its Web site at http://
data.bls.gov/PDQ/outside.jsp?survey=ap. Use this search 
engine to see how the price of whole wheat bread has 
changed from January 1986 to January 2015 for the 
U.S city average.
4.9	 New Goods and the CPI Bias. Most “cell phones” 
today are more than cell phones—they are mini-com-
puters on which you check your e-mail and surf the 
Web. Suppose the BLS treated them as old-fashioned 
cell phones. How would this cause a bias in the CPI? 
(Related to Application 4 on page 155.)
Inflation
Explain the difference between inflation and the price level.
5.1	 If a price index is 40 in 1997 and 50 in 1998, the rate of 
inflation between the two years is _________.
5.2	 Inflation in the United States was higher from 1990 to 
2009 than it was from 1970 to 1980. _________ (True/
False)
5.3	 Which of the following countries experienced a defla-
tion in the 1990s?
a.	 United States
b.	Japan
c.	 Canada
5.4	 If the price of a chorizo sausage in 1950 was $0.50 
and $1.98 in 2013, the percentage rate of change for 
the price of a chorizo sausage over this period was 
_________ percent. 
5.5	 Calculating an Inflation Rate. A country reports a 
price index of 50 in 2007 and 65 in 2008. What is the 
inflation rate between 2007 and 2008?
5.6	 Expenditures by Older Adults. Why might older 
adults consume a different basket of goods than the 
average for the U.S, population? Which expenditure 
categories do you think might be higher for older 
adults? Check your thinking with the table from 
the Bureau of Labor Statistics at www.bls.gov/opub/
ted/2012/ted_20120302_data.htm.
The Costs of Inflation
Summarize the costs of anticipated and unanticipated 
inflation.
6.1	 Inflation that is not expected is known as _________ 
inflation.
6.2	 Shoe-leather costs typically increase with the rate of 
inflation. _________ (True/False)
6.3	 Creditors lose from unanticipated inflation. _________ 
(True/False)
6.4	 Hyperinflation occurs when the inflation rate exceeds 
_________ percent per month.
6.5	 Online Shopping and Menu Costs. How do you 
think the Internet and online shopping would affect 
the menu costs of inflation?
6.6	 Taxes on Stock Gains and Inflation. Suppose you 
bought a stock for $100 and its value stayed constant in 
real terms. Over 25 years, the price of the stock in dol-
lar terms has tripled. If you sold the stock after 25 years 
and your tax rate was 10%, how much tax would you 
owe? How much do you think you should owe?
6.7	 Inflation and ATM Withdrawals. As the inflation rate 
increases, would you take more or less money out per 
each ATM visit? If you walked to the ATM, would that 
increase or decrease the wear and tear on your shoes?

The Economy at Full 
Employment
7
C h a p t e r
Gross domestic product 
per capita is higher in the 
United States than in France. 
What accounts for this 
difference?
The primary reason for this is that the French (and 
other Europeans) work one-third fewer hours than 
do U.S. workers. You might be tempted to attri-
bute this difference to Europeans’ taste for leisure 
or vacations. However, in the early 1970s Europe-
ans actually worked slightly more hours than did 
U.S. workers. What explains this dramatic turn-
around in the space of just 20 years?
Some economists have said the differences can be explained by taxes. In France, taxes are substantially higher 
than in the United States as France provides more public services and a larger fraction of health care is supplied by 
the government. Since 1970, there has been a substantial increase in taxes in France relative to the United States.
But can taxes really explain these differences? If so, how do taxes affect employment? And what lessons might 
this have for the United States?

I
n this chapter we explain how the amount of capital and labor helps determine GDP 
when the economy is operating at full employment. Although the economy experi-
ences booms and busts, in the long run it returns to full employment. This makes 
full employment an important benchmark, or barometer, of real GDP.
We see how full employment is determined at any point in time when wages and 
prices adjust freely and quickly to changes in demand and supply. It is this flexibility in 
wages and prices that allows the economy to operate at full employment. In the next 
chapter we study economic growth when the amount of capital and technology evolves 
over time.
We develop the model of full employment and use it to examine important macro-
economic issues and debates, such as the extent to which taxes may depress economic 
activity and lower the level of GDP. We also learn about real business cycle theory, a 
school of thought that can help us understand why booms and busts occur.
Wage and Price Flexibility and Full Employment
The economic model of the economy at full employment that we develop in this chap-
ter assumes wages and prices adjust freely and quickly to changes in demand and supply. 
Models that make this assumption are called classical models. The term classical refers 
to a school of economics that believed that over a relatively short period of time wages 
and prices would adjust quickly and naturally to bring the economy back to full employ-
ment. The classical school of thought dominated economics until about the 
mid-1930s.
Following the Great Depression in the 1930s, though, economists began to change 
their minds about the classical school. During the Great Depression, unemployment 
was rampant—nearly 25 percent of the labor force was unemployed—and economists 
began to develop models that explained persistent unemployment. In these models, 
wages and prices don’t always adjust quickly to changes in demand and supply—which 
is why booms and busts occur.
Economists today, however, believe that even though wages and prices may be 
slow to adjust in the short run, they will respond eventually and restore the economy 
to full employment. That’s why it is important to study the full-employment model. 
We can use this model to analyze the long-term issues we address in this chapter, such 
as the role taxes play in determining the level of GDP and how immigration affects 
wages and GDP.
An economy at full employment doesn’t mean that there are no unemployed work-
ers. Recall the distinctions among frictional, structural, and cyclical unemployment. 
Frictional unemployment occurs naturally in the labor market as workers search for 
jobs. Structural unemployment arises from a mismatch of skills and jobs. Cyclical 
unemployment is the part of unemployment that rises and falls with economic fluc-
tuations. Cyclical unemployment can be positive, when unemployment exceeds the 
natural rate during a recession, or negative, when unemployment is less than the natural 
rate during a boom. Full employment means an economy has frictional and structural 
unemployment but no cyclical unemployment. In other words, at full employment the 
economy is experiencing neither a boom nor a bust.
The Production Function
Recall that a critical part of the circular flow of economic activity is the production of 
total goods and services from the factors of production. The factors of production 
include the labor, natural resources, physical capital, human capital, and entrepreneur-
ship that are the inputs to a technologically based production process. We discuss more 
of these aspects in the next chapter. In this chapter, however, we develop the idea of a 
production function to study how this production actually occurs. The production 
function explains how the total level of output or GDP in the economy is generated 
from the factors of production.

The relationship between the level

Chapter 7 • The Economy at Full Employment
165
To simplify our discussion of the economy’s production function, let’s first assume 
there are only two factors of production: capital and labor. The stock of capital is all 
the machines, equipment, and buildings in the entire economy. Labor consists of the 
efforts, both physical and mental, of all the workers in the economy used to produce 
goods and services. The production function is written as follows:
Y = F(K, L)
where Y is total output, or GDP; K is the stock of capital; and L is the labor force. 
(F represents the relationship between the factors of production and output.) What the 
math says in words is that we produce total output from both capital and labor. The 
production function, F (K, L), is a model that tells us how much output we produce 
from the inputs to production, K and L: More inputs of either capital or labor in an 
economy lead to increased output.
The stock of capital a society has at any point in time is determined by investments 
it has made in new buildings, machines, and equipment in the past. Investments made 
today will have little or no immediate effect on the total stock of buildings, machines, 
and equipment used in production today because today’s level of investment is typically 
just a small fraction of all past investments. Therefore, it takes time for investment 
to change the stock of capital. In this chapter, we assume for most of our discussion 
that the stock of capital is fixed at a constant level, which we call K. But we will stray 
from that assumption a few times to consider what happens when the stock of capital 
changes. (We promise to let you know where we are straying from the assumption of 
fixed capital.)
With the stock of capital fixed at the constant level K, only variations in the amount 
of labor can change the level of output in the economy. Figure 7.1 plots the relationship 
between the amount of labor used in an economy and the total level of output with a 
fixed stock of capital. Although the stock of capital is fixed, we do vary the amount of 
labor employed in production.

buildings in an entire economy.

Figure 7.1 shows that as we increase labor from L1 to L2, output increases sharply 
from Y1 to Y2. However, as more labor is put into production to get us to L3 and Y3, 
output does not rise as sharply. With capital fixed, the relationship between output and 
labor shown here reflects the principle of diminishing returns.

part 3
166
To explain what diminishing marginal returns means, look at the data in Table  7.1 
from a typical production function. The table shows the amount of output we can 
produce from different amounts of labor inputs while we hold the stock of capital 
constant at some amount. (We don’t care what amount, as long as it is constant.) First, 
notice that as the amount of labor increases, so does the amount of output we produce. 
Second, as output increases, it increases at a diminishing rate. For example, as labor 
input increases from 300 to 400 labor units, output increases by 500 output units—from 
1,000 to 1,500 output units. But as labor input increases from 400 to 500 labor units, 
output increases by only 400 output units—from 1,500 to 1,900 output units. The rate 
of output dropped from 500 output units per additional unit of labor to 400 output 
units per additional unit of labor input. That’s diminishing returns at work.
P r i n c i p l e  o f  D i m i n i s h i n g  R e t u r n s 
Suppose we produce output with two or more inputs and we 
increase one input while holding the other inputs fixed. Beyond 
some point—called the point of diminishing returns—output will 
increase at a decreasing rate.
What happens if the stock of capital increases, say, from K1 to K2? Figure 7.2 
shows that when the stock of capital increases, the entire short-run production function 
▲  Figure 7.2  An Increase in the Stock of Capital
When the capital increases from K1 to K2, the production function shifts up. At any level of labor input, 
the level of output increases.

shifts upward. At any level of labor input, we can produce more output than before we 
increased the stock of capital. As we add more capital, workers become more productive 
and can produce more output. That’s why the production function curve is higher for 
more capital. For example, suppose an office has five staff members who must share 
one copier. They will inevitably waste some time waiting to use it. Adding a copier will 
enable the staff to be more productive.
Capital is one of the key factors of production. As we have seen, the benefits of 
additional capital are a higher level of output from any level of labor input. Through-
out the world, countries have increased their level of output by adding to their stock 
of capital.
Wages and the Demand and Supply for Labor
We’ve just learned from the production function that with the amount of capital fixed, 
the level of output in the economy will be determined exclusively by the amount of 
labor employed. Now we’ll see how the amount of employment in an economy is 
determined by the demand and supply for labor.
On the basis of what you already know about demand and supply from Chapter 4, 
you should be able to see what Figure 7.3 represents when it comes to wages and the 
demand and supply for labor for the entire economy. The amount of labor firms in the 
economy will hire depends on the real wage: the wage rate paid to employees adjusted 
for changes in the price level. The real wage tells us what goods and services workers 
are able to purchase from their labor and also what it costs, in real terms, for employers 
to pay their workers for their services.

As the real-wage rate falls, firms will hire more labor. That is, consistent with the 
law of demand, the labor-demand curve in Figure 7.3 is downward-sloping. In Panel 
A we see that as the real wage falls from $20 to $10 per hour, the firm will increase the 
amount of its labor from 5,000 to 10,000 workers.
While the labor-demand curve is based on the decisions by firms, the labor-supply 
curve is based on the decisions of workers. They must decide how many hours they 
want to work and how much leisure they want to enjoy. Although many complex factors 
enter into the decision to supply labor, in this chapter we typically assume an increase 
in the real wage will lead to an increase in the quantity of labor supplied in the market. 
In Panel B of Figure 7.3 we see that 5,000 people would like to work at $10 per hour, 
but $20 per hour motivates 10,000 people to want to work.

Labor Market Equilibrium
Panel C of Figure 7.3 puts the demand and supply curves together. At a wage of 
$15 per hour, the amount of labor firms want to hire—7,500 workers—will be equal 
to the number of people who want to work—7,500 workers. This is the labor market 
equilibrium: The quantity demanded for labor equals the quantity supplied. Together, 
the demand and supply curves determine the level of employment in the economy and 
the level of real wages. Now that we have a model of labor market equilibrium, we can 
analyze changes in demand and supply for labor.
Changes in Demand and Supply
In deciding how many workers to hire, a firm will compare the marginal benefit from 
hiring a worker to the marginal cost. This is an example of the marginal principle.
M a r g i n a l  P r i n c i p l e 
Increase the level of an activity as long as its marginal benefit 
exceeds its marginal cost. Choose the level at which the marginal 
benefit equals the marginal cost.
Now let’s apply this principle to understanding how a change in the capital stock 
affects the demand for labor. When firms increase their capital stock, they find that 
each worker becomes more productive with the additional capital. For example, sup-
pose the marginal benefit to the firm of an additional hour of work is initially $15, and 
the wage rate is also $15. An increase in the supply of capital raises the marginal benefit 
to the firm to $20. Firms will want to hire additional workers at the existing wage of 
$15 until the marginal benefit again equals the marginal cost.
Because the demand for labor increases at any real wage, the labor-demand curve 
shifts to the right. Panel A of Figure 7.4 shows the effects of an increase in labor 
demand. The new market equilibrium moves from a to b. Real wages increase, and the 
amount of labor employed in the economy increases as well. Having more capital in 
the economy is beneficial for workers.

We also can analyze the effect of an increase in the supply of labor that might 
come, for example, from immigration. If the population increases, we would expect 
more people would want to work at any given wage. This means the labor-supply 
curve would shift to the right. Panel B of Figure 7.4 shows that with an increase in 
the supply of labor, the labor market equilibrium moves from a to b. Real wages have 
fallen, and the amount of labor employed has increased. Workers who were employed 
before the increase in labor supply suffer because real wages have fallen—all wages, 
including theirs.
Our demand and supply of labor model helps us see why currently employed 
workers might be reluctant to favor increased immigration—their wages fall. However, 
there’s a flip side to this. Wages are an input price that firms use in determining the 
price of the goods and services they produce. Lower input prices—such as wages—
eventually lead to lower prices for the products workers buy. In other words, there are 
trade-offs from immigration for society. Our model also explains why workers would 
like to see increases in the supply of machines and equipment as long as full employ-
ment can be maintained. The increased supply of capital (which increases labor pro-
ductivity) increases labor demand and leads to higher real wages.
Demand and supply for labor can often change at the same time, but by looking at 
wages and employment we can determine which effect dominates. Here is an example: 
Suppose you were told that in a small European country both wages and employment 
increased substantially over a 5-year period. As you try to determine what happened, 
would you look primarily at factors that increased labor demand or that increased 
labor supply?
To answer this question, we would want to examine some factors, such as the 
increase in the stock of capital or a change in technology, that would increase labor 
demand and both wages and employment. These factors could account for why wages 
and employment increased in the small European country. Increases in the supply of 
labor (more people in the workforce) would account for the increase in employment, 
but not for the increase in wages.

The Black Death And Living Standards In Old England

were in 1200. Why were real wages temporarily so high during 
this period?
The simple answer was the bubonic plague—also known 
as the Black Death—that arrived from Asia in 1348 and caused 
a long decline in total population through the 1450s. With fewer 
workers, there was less labor supplied to the market. The result 
was higher real wages, although less total output.
In the era before consistent and rapid technological 
advance, changes in population were the primary factor con-
trolling living standards. As economist Thomas Malthus (1766–
1834) observed, social maladies such as the Black Death 
would temporarily raise living standards until higher living stan-
dards led to increased population.  Related to ­Exercises 3.8

Labor Market Equilibrium and Full Employment
We can now join the production function and the demand and supply for labor. 
Together, they will give us a model that helps us determine how much output the 
economy can produce when it is operating at full employment and also help us under-
stand how taxes on employers affect the level of output.
Figure 7.5 brings the model of the labor market together with the short-run produc-
tion function. Panel B depicts equilibrium in the labor market, which we saw in ­Figure 7.3. 
The demand and supply for labor determine the real-wage rate W and identify the level 
of employment L. Panel A plots the short-run production function. With the level of 
employment determined at L in Panel B, we move upward to Panel A and use that level 
of employment to determine that the level of production is Y. Full-employment output 
is the level of output produced when the labor market is in equilibrium and the economy 
is producing at full employment. It is also known as potential output.

Note that full-employment output is based on the idea that the labor market is in 
equilibrium, with the quantity of labor supplied equal to the quantity of labor demanded 
at the equilibrium wage. Potential output is not the absolute maximum level of output 
an economy can produce—an economy could produce more with higher levels of labor 
input—but potential output reflects the level of labor input that workers wish to supply.

Chapter 7 • The Economy at Full Employment
171
How do economists typically measure the level of full-employment output, or 
potential output? They start with an estimate of what the unemployment rate would 
be if cyclical unemployment were zero—that is, if the only unemployment were due to 
frictional or structural factors. In the United States, estimates of the natural rate in recent 
years have varied between 5.0 and 6.5 percent. Economists then estimate how many 
workers will be employed and use the production function to determine potential output.
Let’s look at some real numbers. In 1996, the unemployment rate was 5.6 ­percent, 
very close to the natural rate of unemployment. The labor force in that year was 
approximately 133.9 million, and 126.7 million individuals were employed. Real GDP 
in that year was $7.8 trillion, measured in 1996 dollars. This level of GDP was pro-
duced with the labor of the 126.7 million employed workers and the existing stock 
of capital and technology. Because the unemployment rate in 1996 was close to the 
natural rate, the level of real GDP was also very close to the level of potential output 
in that year.
The level of potential output in an economy increases as the supply of labor 
increases or the stock of capital increases. An increase in the supply of labor, perhaps 
from more liberal immigration, would shift the labor-supply curve to the right and 
lead to a higher level of employment in the economy. With a higher level of employ-
ment, the level of full-employment output will increase. An increase in the stock of 
capital will increase the demand for labor. As labor demand increases, the result will 
be higher wages and increased employment. Higher employment will again raise the 
level of full-employment output.
Potential output depends on both capital and labor. Consequently, differences in 
the quantity of labor supplied to the market will affect the level of potential output in a 
country. Countries do differ in the amount of labor their workers supply to the market. 
Apart from national holidays, workers in the United States take an average of 12 days 
of vacation, compared to 28 days in the United Kingdom, 35 days in Germany, and 
an amazing 42 days (over 8 work weeks) in Italy. These differences in labor supply are 
important. Per capita output is higher in the United States than in Germany but, other 
things being equal, this difference would disappear if German workers toiled as much 
as their U.S. counterparts.
Using the Full-Employment Model
We use the full-employment model extensively in macroeconomics to analyze a wide 
range of issues. For example, many politicians and economists have argued that high 
tax rates have hurt the U.S. economy and reduced the level of output and production. 
We can use the full-employment model to explore the logic of these claims. We also 
see how to use the model to explain booms and recessions—fluctuations in output. 
This allows us to understand the fundamental idea of an influential school of economic 
thought known as real business cycle theory.
Taxes and Potential Output
We use the full-employment model in Figure 7.6 to study the effects of taxes employ-
ers pay for hiring labor, such as the taxes they pay for their portion of workers’ Social 
Security. (Economists use similar arguments to study a variety of taxes, including per-
sonal and corporate income taxes.) A tax on labor will make labor more expensive and 
raise the marginal cost of hiring workers. For example, let’s say there is no tax on labor 
and suddenly a tax of 10 percent is imposed. An employer who had been paying $10 an 
hour for workers will now find that labor costs $11 an hour. Because the marginal cost 
of hiring workers has gone up but the marginal benefit to the firm has not changed, 
employers will respond by hiring fewer workers at any given wage. In Panel A of 
­Figure 7.6, the labor-demand curve shifts to the left, reflecting the change in demand 
due to the tax. As the demand curve shifts to the left, the market equilibrium moves 
from a to  b. The result is lower real wages and lower employment.
Learning Objective 7.5
Describe how changes in taxes can 
affect full employment.

part 3
172
As we have just seen, higher taxes lead to less employment. With reduced employ-
ment, potential output in the economy will be reduced as the economy moves to a lower 
level of output on the short-run production function. Higher taxes therefore lead to 
lower output. The size of the reduction in output depends critically on the slope of the 
labor-supply curve. The slope of the labor-supply curve indicates how sensitive labor 
supply is to changes in real wages.
Panel B in Figure 7.6 shows the effect of the same tax with a vertical labor-supply 
curve. A vertical labor-supply curve means workers will supply the same amount of 
labor regardless of the wage. For example, a single parent might work a full 40 hours a 
week regardless of the wage, so the supply curve will be vertical. If, say, other workers 
in the economy also put in the same hours regardless of the wage, the supply curve for 
labor in the entire economy will be vertical. In Panel B, we see that with a vertical sup-
ply curve, the change in demand will move the market equilibrium from a to b. The tax 
will reduce wages but have no effect on employment and therefore no effect on output.
This example illustrates that taxes can affect wages and output. In both cases, either 
output or wages were lowered when the tax was imposed. However, the extent of the 
decline in output depends on the slope of the labor-supply curve. To understand the 
effects of taxes on output, we need information about the slope of the labor-supply curve.
Labor supply has been the focus of many studies. The evidence is strong that part-
time workers or second earners in a family are very sensitive to changes in wages and do 
vary their labor supply when wages change. There is less of a consensus about the behav-
ior of primary earners in the family. For many years, economists believed their labor 
supply was not very sensitive to changes in compensation. However, recent research has 
shown that taxes do matter, even for primary earners, especially high earners.
The entire area of taxation and economics is an active branch of economics 
research. Economists such as Martin Feldstein of Harvard University have stud-
ied how many different types of taxes affect employment, saving, and production. 
Economists use models to try to measure these effects, just as we did for the employ-
ment tax.
Real Business Cycle Theory
Fluctuations in economic activity can result from a variety of causes. Here are some 
examples: A developing country that is highly dependent on agriculture can lose its 
cash crop because of a prolonged drought. According to economic historian Stanley 
▲  Figure 7.6  How Employment Taxes Affect Labor Demand and Supply

Lebergott, the nineteenth-century U.S. agricultural-based economy was devastated 
by grasshopper invasions in North Dakota from 1874 to 1876 and by the boll-weevil 
migration from Mexico to Texas in 1892.1 Sharp increases in the price of oil can hurt 
economies that use oil in production, as was the case throughout the world in both 
1973 and 1979. Wars can devastate entire regions of the world, and natural disasters, 
such as earthquakes or floods, can cause sharp reductions in GDP.
Major shifts in technology, which we discuss more in the next chapter, can also 
cause economic fluctuations. Consider some economic developments, starting with 
the early nineteenth century. There were large investments in textile mills and steam 
power. The birth of the steel industry and railroads dominated the last half of the 
century. At the end of the nineteenth century, new industries arose that were based on 
chemical manufacturing, electricity, and the automobile. It is inconceivable that the 
vast changes in technology that led to the creation of these new industries would not 
have profound effects on the economy. For example, the invention of the automobile 
sounded the death knell for makers of horse-drawn buggies, buggy whips, and a host 
of other industries.
Economic fluctuations can also occur because a number of small shocks all hit 
the economy at the same time. For example, a case of mad cow disease could cause 
consumer preferences to change from beef to pork. Or a series of small improve-
ments in breeding technology could cause output to rise among worldwide producers 
of cattle.
One school of economic thought, known as real business cycle theory, empha-
sizes that shocks to technology can be a major cause of economic fluctuations. Led by 
Nobel Laureate economist Edward Prescott, real business cycle economists have devel-
oped newer models that integrate shocks to technology into the full-employment 
model we have been discussing.
The idea behind real business cycle theory is simple: Changes in technology will 
usually change the level of full employment or potential output. A significant tech-
nological improvement will enable the economy to increase the level of both actual 
and potential output. For example, the advances in technology that allowed computer 
users to transfer data-intensive images easily across the Internet created many new 
opportunities for businesses to grow and flourish. Adverse technological developments 
(or adverse shocks to the economy) will cause output and potential output to fall. 
For example, the Internet crashing would bring business communication systems and 
ordering systems to a halt.
Figure 7.7 gives a simple example of how the real business cycle theory works. 
Suppose an adverse technological shock occurred, decreasing the demand for labor. 
The demand curve for labor would shift to the left, and the labor market equilibrium 
would move from a to b. The result would be a lower level of employment and lower 
real wages. Total GDP would fall because employment is low and because the economy 
is less productive than before.
Conversely, a positive technological shock would increase labor demand and result 
in both higher wages and higher employment. Total GDP would rise because employ-
ment is high and because the economy is more productive than before.
An economy buffeted by positive and negative technological shocks would experi-
ence economic fluctuations even though it would always be at full-employment output. 
The key lesson from real business cycle theory is that potential output itself will vary 
over time.
The real business cycle school of thought has been influential with some academic 
economists, but in its most extreme form it has been viewed as controversial. Critics 
find it difficult to understand how many of the post–World War II recessions can be 
explained by adverse changes in technology. In addition, the real business cycle model 
does not provide an explanation of unemployment. In the model the labor market is in 
equilibrium, and the quantity demanded for labor equals the quantity supplied. At the 
equilibrium wage, the quantity of labor demanded equals the quantity of labor supplied, 
and everyone who seeks employment finds employment.

Do European Soccer Stars Change Clubs To Reduce Their Taxes?
Applying The Concepts #2: What evidence is there that taxes on high-paid soccer stars  
in Europe affect their location decisions among countries?
In an interesting study, economists Henrik Jacobsen 
Kleven, Camille Landais, and Emmanuel Saez used changes in 
the market for international soccer stars to test for the effects 
of tax rates. Prior to 1995, the top European soccer clubs had 
limits on the number of foreign players on any one team. The 
European Court of Justice, however, ruled that these limits vio-
lated the treaty of the European community. After 1995, the 
rules limiting foreign players were relaxed. The economists 
found that, prior to 1995, taxes on high earners did not have 
much effect on the mobility of soccer stars, but after 1995, top 
tax rates did matter. They also found that specific tax breaks 
offered by countries also influenced the players’ decisions on 
where to locate.
But not all top earners are as mobile as professional ath-
letes. Despite the increase in “globalization” in the last 30 years, 
tax rates do differ sharply across countries.  Related to ­Exercises 
5.4 and 5.5.

In 2009, Portuguese soccer star Cristiano Ronaldo moved from 
Manchester United in the United Kingdom to Real Madrid in 
Spain. At the time, many speculated that the reason he moved 
was to avoid a top United Kingdom tax rate of 50 percent in 
favor of a flat 24 percent rate (with no deductions) created to 
entice foreigners to locate in Spain. While this is an interesting 
anecdote, is there any other evidence that the very top earners 
will move to countries with lower tax rates?

Proponents of the real business cycle model counter that other types of economic 
models can explain unemployment and that the real business cycle can still explain 
fluctuations in employment. Real business cycle theory is an active area of research, 
and both its methods and approach, grounded in firm economic reasoning, have had 
a major influence on professional research today. Scholars working in this tradition 
have begun to offer modifications of the basic model that can potentially explain major 
economic events.
Dividing Output among Competing Demands  
for GDP at Full Employment
Our model of full employment is based entirely on the supply of factors of production 
and the state of technology. The demand for and supply of labor determine the real 
wage and total employment in the economy. Together, labor and the supply of capital 
determine the level of output through the production function. And that means that 
in a full-employment economy, total GDP is determined by the supply of factors of 
production.
Because society faces scarce resources, it must divide full-employment GDP 
among competing demands. From Chapters 5 and 6, you know that GDP is com-
posed of consumption, investment, government purchases, and net exports, which 
we denote as C + I + G + NX. In this section, we see how societies divide total 
spending among these four components. Because governments, for many different 
reasons, increase their level of spending, we would like to know how increased gov-
ernment spending affects private spending. We see how increases in government

Government Policies And Savings Rates
Applying the Concepts #3: What explains Singapore’s high savings rates?
Workers under 50 years of age must save 20 percent of their 
salary and employers contribute another 15.5 percent, for a total 
of 35.5 percent of their earnings. Of course, individuals will want 
to save additional amounts for their ordinary needs. The combi-
nation of this required and optional saving makes Singapore’s 
overall savings rate so high.
The savings that individuals make are kept in their own 
names in accounts held by the government. Some of the funds 
in these accounts can only be used for retirement, but other 
portions can be used for housing, health insurance, and health 
care. Singapore does not have a U.S.-style Social Security 
system where retirement income is paid out of general funds. 
Singaporeans rely on this system to finance their spending dur-
ing their retirement years. While Singaporeans must turn over 
a large fraction of their earnings to the government, they know 
that their savings will be eventually returned to them when they 
need them. Related to Exercise 6.5.

In the United States, private consumption plus government 
consumption totals 84 percent in GDP. In Singapore, total con-
sumption from the private sector and the government is only 47 
percent of GDP. As a result, the World Bank estimates Singa-
pore’s gross savings rate—gross national income minus total 
consumption—at 48 percent, one of the highest in the world. By 
comparison, Hong Kong, with whom Singapore is often com-
pared, has a gross savings rate of only 27 percent. Why does 
Singapore have such a high savings rate?
The answer lies in government policy. Singapore requires 
that all workers save a very high percentage of their income 
in government accounts called the Central Provident Fund.

spending must reduce other types of expenditures when the economy is operating at 
full employment.
International Comparisons
Countries divide GDP among its four components in very different ways. Table 7.2 
presents data on the percent of GDP in alternative uses for five countries in 2012. 
Recall that consumption (C), investment (I ), and government purchases (G) refer to 
total spending by residents of that country. Net exports (NX) is the difference between 
exports (sales of goods to foreign residents) and imports (purchases of goods abroad). If 
a country has positive net exports—for example, Hong Kong, China, and Germany—it 
is selling more goods in other countries than it is buying from other countries. If a 
country has negative net exports—such as the United States and France—it is buying 
more goods than it is selling to other countries.
Let’s make one more point: These data are from the World Development ­Indicators, 
which is published by the World Bank. In these statistics, government purchases 
include only government consumption, such as military spending or wages for gov-
ernment employees. Government investment, such as spending on bridges or roads, is 
included in the investment category (I ).
Table 7.2 reveals considerable diversity among countries. The United States con-
sumes 68 percent of its GDP, a higher fraction than all the other countries. As far as 
investment goes, Germany and the United States invest a smaller share of GDP than 
the other countries in the table. China invests the most by far—49 percent. Countries 
also differ greatly when it comes to government consumption. France has the highest 
rate of government consumption, while Hong Kong has the lowest. Finally, the coun-
tries also differ in the size of net exports relative to GDP.
This wide diversity challenges economists to explain these differences. Some 
economists have suggested that China’s high savings rate (low share of consump-
tion) can be explained by its one-child-per-family policy. They argue that this leads 
workers to save more for retirement because they cannot depend on their children to 
support them. Other economists attribute the high savings rate to the fact that China 
provides very little government-sponsored retirement benefits. In general, differ-
ences across countries are hard to explain. For example, there are no obvious, purely 
economic reasons why the United States, France, and Germany should exhibit such 
different behavior.
Crowding Out in a Closed Economy
We know government spending is part of GDP. Let’s say GDP is fixed and the govern-
ment increases its spending. What happens in a country that increases its government 
purchases within a fixed GDP? Because the level of full-employment output is given 
by the supply of factors in the economy, an increase in government spending must 
come at the expense of other uses of GDP. Or, stated another way, increased

Table 7.2  Shares of Spending in GDP, Assorted Countries, 2012

Chapter 7 • The Economy at Full Employment
177
At full employment, the opportunity cost of increased government spending is 
some other component of GDP.
To understand crowding out, let’s first consider what will happen when government 
spending increases in an economy without international trade, called a closed ­economy. 
In a closed economy, full-employment output is divided among just three different 
demands: consumption, investment, and government purchases. We can write this as
output = consumption + investment + government purchases
Y = C + I + G
Because we are considering an economy at full employment, the supply of output 
(Y) is fixed. Increases in government spending must reduce—that is, crowd out—either 
consumption or investment. In general, both are affected. On the investment side, the 
government will be in increased competition with businesses trying to borrow funds 
from the public to finance its investment plans. This increased competition from the 
government will make it more difficult and costly for businesses to make those invest-
ments. As a result, business investment spending will decrease. In other words, govern-
ment crowds out investment.
Crowding out occurred in the United States during World War II as the share of 
government spending as a part of GDP rose sharply. Figures 7.8 and 7.9 show that at 
the same time the share of government spending increased, the shares of consumption 
and investment spending in GDP decreased.

The opportunity cost of something is what you sacrifice to get it.
government spending crowds out other demands for GDP. This is called crowding 
out. Crowding out illustrates the principle of opportunity cost:

Crowding Out in an Open Economy
An economy with international trade is called an open economy. In an open economy, 
full-employment output is divided among four uses: consumption, investment, govern-
ment purchases, and net exports (exports – imports):
Y = C + I + G + NX
Increased government spending need not crowd out either consumption or invest-
ment. It could lead to reduced exports and increased imports. Therefore, what could 
get crowded out instead is net exports.
Here is how this crowding out might happen: Suppose the U.S. government 
began buying domestic goods—for example, computer paper—to use for its offices. 
Let’s say consumers would have purchased this paper but now cannot. If consumers 
want to maintain their same consumption of computer paper despite the fact that 
the government now has it, they could purchase domestic computer paper previ-
ously sold abroad (exports) or purchase paper sold by foreign countries (imports). 
The result would be a decrease in the amount of paper exported and an increase in 
imported paper, that is, a decrease in total net exports. In practice, increases in gov-
ernment spending in an open economy would crowd out consumption, investment, 
and net exports.
Crowding In
Governments do not always increase spending. Sometimes they decrease it. When the 
government cuts spending and the level of output is fixed, some other type of spending 
will increase. We call this crowding in. In a closed economy, consumption or invest-
ment, or both, could increase. In an open economy, net exports could increase as well. 
As an example, after a war we might see increases in consumption, investment spending, 
or net exports as they replace military spending.

The nature of changes in government spending will have some effect on the type 
of spending that is crowded in (or crowded out). If the government spent less on mail 
service—leading to longer delays in the mail—businesses and households would most 
likely want to spend more on private mail or delivery services. If the government built 
more public swimming pools, households would most likely cut back their own spend-
ing on backyard pools.
In this chapter, we studied the 
economy at full employment. 
In the model we developed, 
the level of GDP is determined 
by the supply of the factors of 
production—labor, natural 
resources, physical capital, 
human capital, and entrepre-
neurship. We focused on how the economy operates when it is at full 
employment. In later chapters, we consider economic fluctuations. 
Here are the main points from this chapter:
1.	 Models that assume wages and prices adjust freely to changes in 
demand and supply are called classical models. They are useful 
to understand how the economy operates at full employment.
2.	 Full-employment output, or potential output, is the level of GDP 
produced from a given supply of capital when the labor market 
is in equilibrium. Potential output is fully determined by the supply 
of factors of production in the economy.
3.	 Increases in the stock of capital raise the level of full-employment 
output and real wages.
4.	 Increases in the supply of labor will raise the level of full-­
employment output but lower the level of real wages.
5.	 The full-employment model has many applications. Many econo-
mists use it to study the effects of taxes on potential output. 
Others have found the model useful in understanding economic 
fluctuations in models of real business cycles.
6.	 At full employment, increases in government spending must come 
at the expense of other components of GDP. In a closed economy, 
either consumption or investment must be crowded out. In an open 
economy, net exports can be crowded out as well. Decreases in 
government spending will crowd in other types of spending.

The Production Function
Explain the concept of diminishing returns to labor.
2.1	 The relationship between the quantity of output pro-
duced and the quantity of inputs used to produce it is 
called the __________.
2.2	 Which of the following would be counted as part of the 
stock of capital?
a.	 copy machines in a photocopying shop
b.	lettuce on a salad bar
c.	 a newly discovered mineral deposit
d.	all of the above
2.3	 A decrease in the stock of capital shifts the production 
function __________ (upward/downward). Show this 
with a graph.
2.4	 A decrease in human capital is likely to shift the 
­production function __________ (upward/-downward).
2.5	 Singapore’s Growth in the Capital Stock. From 
1960 until 2006, Singapore’s capital stock grew rapidly, 
averaging almost 10 percent per year. Draw a graph to 
illustrate how this increase in the capital stock shifted 
the production function.
2.6	 The Production Function and Emigration. During 
the potato famine, many workers left Ireland. Show 
how this affected output using a production function.
2.7	 Diminishing Returns? An economy increased 
employment first from 10,000 to 20,000 and then from 
20,000 to 30,000. The corresponding increases in out-
put were 15,000 and 20,000, respectively. Nothing else 
changed during this period. Did this economy exhibit 
diminishing returns?
Wages and the Demand and Supply for Labor
Analyze how shifts in demand and supply affect wages  
and employment.
3.1	 Labor market equilibrium occurs at a real wage at 
which the quantity demanded for labor equals the 
quantity __________ of labor.
3.2	 The labor __________ (demand/supply) curve is based 
on the decisions of __________ (firms/workers); these 
decisions include choices such as how many hours to 
work and how many hours to invest in leisure activities.
3.3	 The labor demand curve is __________ (upward/down-
ward) sloping because a lower real wage entices firms 
to hire __________ (fewer/more) workers.
3.4	 If wages and employment both fall, this is likely caused 
by a decrease in the supply for labor. __________ 
(True/False)
3.5	 Historical Immigration Patterns and Real Wages. 
Between 1870 and 1910, 60 million Europeans left 
Europe to go to the United States, Canada, Australia, 
and Argentina. This immigration sharply increased 
the labor force in these countries, but decreased it in 
Europe.
a.	 Draw demand and supply graphs to show what hap-
pened to wages in Europe.
b.	Draw demand and supply graphs to show what hap-
pened to wages in other countries.
3.6	 Immigration and Wages Near the Border. Some 
economists have argued that while immigration does 
not have a major effect on the overall level of wages 
for the entire economy, it does decrease wages near the 
Mexican border. Can you explain this effect of immi-
gration on wages?
3.7	 Philippines and Return Migration. Roughly 
10 ­percent of the population of the Philippines works 
overseas. Suppose overseas Philippine workers returned 
to their home country. Using Figure 7.4 on page 168, 
illustrate the effects of this reverse flow of people on 
wages and employment.
3.8	 Malthus and Subsistence Wages. Thomas Malthus 
wrote that if wages exceeded subsistence levels the pop-
ulation would increase, which in turn would drive real 
wages back down to subsistence. Suppose there were 
an increase in the demand for labor, which raised real 
wages. Under Malthus’s theory, show how the supply 
curve for labor would shift. (Related to Application 1 
on page 169.)
3.9	 Malthus, Population Size, and Technology. Mal-
thus believed the population would always adjust to 
bring real wages back to a fixed subsistence level. Using 
a demand and supply for labor diagram, show that an 
improvement in technology will lead to a higher level 
of population. (Related to Application 1 on page 169.)
Labor Market Equilibrium and Full Employment
Explain how full employment is determined in a classical model.
4.1	 Suppose the supply of labor increases. Draw a graph to 
show how potential output and wages change.
4.2	 Draw a graph to show how potential output and wages 
change when the stock of capital decreases.
4.3	 Full-employment output is the level of output that 
is produced when the labor market is in equilibrium. 
__________ (True/False)
4.4	 The level of full-employment output in an economy 
increases as the supply of labor __________ (increases/
decreases), the stock of capital __________ (increases/
decreases), and the natural rate of unemployment 
__________ (increases/decreases).
4.5	 Estimates of the Natural Rate and Full Employ-
ment. Two economists differ on their estimates of the 
natural rate. One economist believes it is 6 percent, 
while the other believes it is 5 percent. All else being 
equal, which economist will estimate a higher value for 
potential output?

181
4.6	 Germany and the United States. Per capita output is 
higher in the United States than in Germany. Accord-
ing to recent studies, what is the main cause of this 
difference?
4.7	 Technology and Potential Output. Suppose that 
technology improves: for any level of the capital stock, 
the short-run production function shifts up. What hap-
pens to potential output?
Using the Full-Employment Model
Describe how changes in taxes can affect full employment.
5.1	 On a graph of the labor market, show the effects of an 
increase in the payroll tax.
5.2	 On a graph of the labor market, show the effects 
of a negative shock to technology on wages and 
employment.
5.3	 Two examples of major technological innovations that 
could have caused major economic fluctuations are 
__________ and __________.
5.4	 Explain why the very top athletes or entertainers would 
be more likely to change countries to reduce their taxes 
as compared to ordinary middle-class workers. (Related 
to Application 2 on page 174.)
5.5	 Payroll Tax for a Health Program. To finance a uni-
versal health-care program, the government decides 
to place a 10 percent payroll tax on all labor hired. 
(Related to Application 2 on page 174.)
a.	 Draw a graph to show how this shifts the demand 
for labor.
b.	If the labor-supply curve is vertical, what are the 
effects on real wages, output, and employment? 
Explain why economists say labor bears the full bur-
den of the tax in this case.
c.	 If the labor-supply curve were horizontal, what 
would be the effects on wages, output, and 
employment?
5.6	 Analyzing the Effects of Tax Rate Changes for 
Families with Different Incomes. The Tax Reform 
Act of 1986 cut the tax rates sharply for high-income 
earners. Consider the families in the top 1 percent of all 
families ranked in terms of income. Before the law was 
passed, a woman in this group faced a marginal tax rate 
(the tax rate applied to the last dollar she earned) of 52 
percent on average. After the law was passed, the rate 
fell to 38 percent. The decreases in tax rates were much 
less, however, for families with lower levels of income. 
According to a study by Professor Nada Eissa,2 after the 
decrease in taxes took effect, the labor supply of women 
in the highest income group increased more than that 
of women in other income groups. Use a labor demand 
and supply model to illustrate the differences between 
the high-income group and the other groups.
5.7	 Tax Revenue and Labor Supply. Tax revenue col-
lected from a payroll tax equals the tax rate times the 
earnings of individuals subject to the payroll tax. Let’s 
say the labor-supply curve is close to vertical. Explain 
why, in this case, raising payroll tax rates will increase 
the total revenue the government receives from the 
payroll tax.
5.8	 Wages, Real Business Cycle Theory, and the Great 
Depression. During the Great Depression, real wages 
increased. Is this consistent with a simple real business 
cycle that explains all economic fluctuations with just 
technology shocks?
5.9	 Could Raising Capital Gains Taxes Reduce 
­Revenues? The U.S. government currently taxes 
increases in the value of stocks when they are sold. This 
is called the capital gains tax. Explain why, if the gov-
ernment increased the tax rate on capital gains, it could 
actually receive less total revenue. In your answer, care-
fully distinguish between the tax rate and tax revenues.
5.10	 Summarizing Research on Labor Supply and 
­Taxation. The Congressional Budget Office published 
a review of the literature on labor supply and taxation, 
which is available at https://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/
files/labormkts.pdf. According to this review, what 
groups are most sensitive to changes in tax rates? When 
tax rates are reduced, what fraction of the increase in 
labor supply comes from new entrants to the labor 
force?
Dividing Output among Competing Demands for  
GDP at Full Employment
Explain how countries must divide output across  
different uses.
6.1	 When the economy operates at full employment, an 
increase in government spending must crowd out con-
sumption. __________ (True/False)
6.2	 A(n) __________ economy is open to trade, whereas a 
closed economy is not.
6.3	 In an open economy, increases in government spend-
ing can crowd out consumption, investment, or 
__________.
6.4	 Compared to other countries, China has a relatively 
__________ share of consumption spending in GDP.

6.5	 Explaining Differences in Savings Across Countries. 
Hong Kong and Singapore have similar levels of GDP, 
neither has a U.S.-style Social Security system, and the 
majority of their residents have Chinese ancestry. Yet, 
consumption as a fraction of GDP is much higher in 
Hong Kong than in Singapore. What can explain this 
difference? (Related to Application 3 on p. 175.)
6.6	 Consumption or Investment Crowding Out? Sup-
pose local governments in suburban communities 
around the country started building large community 
swimming pools. Explain what type of spending this 
might crowd out. Compare this to the effect of govern-
ment spending on exploration of Mars.
6.7	 Marital Gifts and Savings. In Japan, it is a custom 
for the bride’s family to give a gift having very large 
monetary value to the family of the groom. How might 
this affect the savings rate in Japan?

Why Do Economies 
Grow?

C h a p t e r
We usually think of medical 
scientists performing controlled 
experiments, not economists.
A pioneering group of economists, led by Ester Duflo 
and Abhijit Banerjee of the Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology, have for more than a decade brought 
the rigor of medical trials to development economics. 
For many years, economists looked at development 
issues at the 10,000-foot level, asking big ques-
tions such as whether foreign aid was good or bad 
or whether poor climate led inevitably to poverty. The 
new generation of economists decided to focus on the 
micro level and developed experimental methods to 
test whether seemingly good ideas worked in practice.
Working from the Addul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab at MIT, researchers posed narrower questions and 
conducted controlled experiments to test their ideas. For example, a new method for encouraging villagers to use 
mosquito nets to stem the spread of malaria was tried in some villages but not others. By looking at the difference 
in the results, researchers could determine whether these methods work. Randomized controlled experiments are 
now commonly used in developing countries.1

ur living standards are dramatically different today because of the remarkable 
growth in GDP per person. Growth in GDP is perhaps the most critical aspect 
of a country’s economic performance. Over long periods, it is the only way to 
raise the standard of living in an economy.
This chapter begins by looking at some data from both rich and poor countries 
over the last several decades. We see how GDP per capita (meaning per person—every 
man, woman, and child) compares over this period. We then look at how growth 
occurs. Economists believe two basic mechanisms increase GDP per capita over the 
long term. One is capital deepening, or increases in an economy’s stock of capital 
(such as buildings and equipment) relative to its workforce. Technological progress 
is the other; to economists this means an economy operates more efficiently, producing 
more output, but without using any more inputs such as capital or labor. We examine 
different theories of the origins of technological progress and discuss how to measure 
its overall importance for the economy. We also discuss in detail the role of education, 
experience, and investments in human beings, which is called human capital.
The appendix to this chapter contains a simple model of capital deepening known 
as the Solow model. It shows how increases in capital per worker lead to economic 
growth. The model also allows us to better understand the role of technological prog-
ress in sustaining economic growth.
Economic Growth Rates
Throughout the world there are vast differences in standards of living and in rates of 
economic growth. To understand these differences, we first need to look at the con-
cepts and the tools economists use to study economic growth.
But before we learn how to measure growth, let’s take a broad overview of what 
we mean by economic growth. We can understand economic growth by using one of the 
tools we developed in Chapter 2: the production possibilities curve. The production 
possibilities curve shows the set of feasible production options for an economy at a 
given point of time. In Figure 8.1 we show an economy’s trade-off when it comes to 
producing consumer goods versus military goods. As the economy grows, the entire 
production possibilities curve shifts outward. This means the economy can produce 
more of both goods—that is what we mean by economic growth. Growth also expands 
the amount of goods available for people to consume. Just think about your own family. 
technological progress
More efficient ways of organizing 
economic affairs that allow an economy to 
increase output without increasing inputs.
capital deepening
Increases in the stock of capital per 
worker.

and used to produce goods and services.

A typical family 40 years ago had only one car, whereas today many families have two 
or three. However, the economic growth we take for granted is recent and does not 
apply evenly across all societies.
Measuring Economic Growth
From earlier chapters we know that real gross domestic product (GDP) measures in 
constant prices the total value of final goods and services in a country. Because coun-
tries differ in the size of their populations, we want to know a country’s real GDP per 
person, or its real GDP per capita.
Real GDP per capita typically grows over time. A convenient way to describe the 
changes in real GDP per capita is with growth rates. The growth rate of a variable is 
the percentage change in that variable from one period to another. For example, to 
calculate the growth rate of real GDP from year 1 to year 2, suppose real GDP was 
100 in year 1 and 104 in year 2. In this case, the growth rate of real GDP is:
 growth rate =
(GDP in year 2 - GDP in year 1)
(GDP in year 1)
 = (104 - 100)
100
 =
4
100
 = 4% per year
In other words, real GDP grew by 4 percent from year 1 to year 2. This also means 
that GDP in year 2 was (1 + 0.04) times GDP in year 1.
Economies can grow at different rates from one year to the next. But it often is useful 
to consider what happens when an economy grows at a constant rate, say g, for a number 
of years. Let’s start simply. Suppose real GDP for an economy was 100 and the economy 
grew at a rate g for 2 years. How large would the real GDP be 2 years later? After 1 year, 
GDP would be (1 + g) 100. In the second year, it would grow by (1 + g) again, or
GDP [2 years later] = (1 + g)2 (100)
We can generalize this to consider the case where the economy grows a constant rate 
g for n years. How large would GDP be after n years? A simple formula gives the answer:
GDP [n years later] = (1 + g)n (100)
Example: If the economy starts at 100 and grows at a rate of 4 percent a year for 
10 years, output (after 10 years) will be:
GDP [10 years later] = (1 + 0.04)10 (100) = (1.48) (100) = 148
which is nearly 50 percent higher than in the first year.
Here’s a rule of thumb to help you understand the power of growth rates. Suppose 
you know the growth rate of real GDP, and it is constant, but you want to know how 
many years it will take until the level of real GDP doubles. The answer is given by the 
rule of 70:
years to double =
70
(percentage growth rate)
Example: For an economy that grew at 5 percent a year, it would take
70
5 = 14 years
for real GDP to double. (In case you are curious, the rule of 70 is derived by using the 
mathematics of logarithms.)

Comparing the Growth Rates of Various Countries
Making comparisons of real GDP or GNP across countries is difficult. Not only do 
countries have their own currencies, but patterns of consumption and prices can differ 
sharply among countries. Two examples can illustrate this point. First, because land 
is scarce in Japan, people live in smaller spaces than do residents of the United States, 
so the price of housing is higher (relative to other goods) than in the United States. 
Second, developing countries (such as India or Pakistan) have very different price struc-
tures than developed countries. In particular, in developing countries goods that are 
not traded—such as household services or land—are relatively cheaper than goods that 
are traded in world markets. In other words, while all residents of the world may pay 
the same price for gold jewelry, hiring a cook or household helper is considerably less 
expensive in India or Pakistan than in the United States.
It is important to take these differences into account. Fortunately, a team of econo-
mists led by Robert Summers and Alan Heston of the University of Pennsylvania has 
devoted decades to developing methods for measuring real GNP across countries. The 
team’s procedures are based on gathering extensive data on prices of comparable goods 
in each country and making adjustments for differences in relative prices and consump-
tion patterns. These methods are now used by the World Bank and the International 
Monetary Fund, two prominent international organizations.
According to these methods, the country with the highest level of gross national 
income per capita in 2013 was Qatar; its income per capita was $128,530. Singapore 
was second at $76,860, while Norway, with its oil wealth, was third at $66,520. For 
comparison on this measure, the United States registered an income of $53,750.
Table 8.1 lists real expenditures per capita for 2011, expressed in 2005 dollars, 
and the average annual growth rate of GNI per capita between 1960 and 2011 for 
11 countries. In terms of real expenditures per capita, the United States led this group, 
followed by the United Kingdom, France, Japan, and Italy. More representative of typi-
cal countries in the world are Mexico and Costa Rica. Expenditures per capita in Costa 
Rica are less than one-fourth of the United States. Very poor countries have extremely 
low expenditures per capita. Pakistan, for example, has only $2,472 in expenditure per 
person—less than 6 percent of the value for the United States.

Table 8.1  Real Expenditures Per Capita and Economic Growth
In the third column of Table 8.1, notice the differences in growth rates. Consider 
Japan. In 1960, Japan had expenditures per capita that was 42 percent that of France. 
But notice from the third column that Japan grew on average 4.03 percent per year 
during the period, compared to 2.39 percent for France. By 2011, its expenditures

per capita were virtually the same as that of France. To place Japan’s growth rate for 
this period into perspective, recall the rule of 70. If an economy grows at an average 
annual rate of x percent a year, it takes 70/x years for output to double. In Japan’s case, 
per capita output was doubling every 70/4.03 years, or approximately every 17 years. 
At this rate, from the time someone was born to the time he or she reached the age 
of 34, living standards would have increased by a factor of four—an extraordinary rate 
of growth. The rule of 70 reinforces the importance of small differences in economic 
growth rates. A per capita GDP growth rate of 5 percent per year means that the liv-
ing standard doubles in 14 years. With only 1 percent growth, doubling would take 
70 years.

tries are very large and are also reflected in many different aspects of society. Take, for 
example, child labor. In the developed world, we disapprove of child labor and wonder 
how we can work toward its elimination. Economic research has shown that as coun-
tries grow they are less likely to use child labor.
Are Poor Countries Catching Up?
One question economists ask is whether poorer countries can close the gap between 
their level of GDP per capita and the GDP per capita of richer countries. Closing 
this gap is called convergence. To converge, poorer countries have to grow at more 
rapid rates than richer countries. Since 1960, Japan, Italy, and France all have grown 
more rapidly than the United States and have narrowed the gap in per capita 
incomes.
Let’s look at some evidence provided by two distinguished international econo-
mists, Maurice Obstfeld of the University of California, Berkeley, and Kenneth Rogoff 
of Harvard University, based on original work by Angus Maddison. Figure 8.2 plots the 
convergence
The process by which poorer countries 
close the gap with richer countries in 
terms of real GDP per capita.

Each point on the graph represents a different currently developed country. Notice that the countries

Global Warming, Rich Countries, and Poor Countries
Applying the Concepts #1: How may global warming affect economic growth?
afflict mainly the poor countries, most of whom are dependent 
on agriculture. Rich countries do not suffer from increases in 
temperature. In a study of municipalities within Latin and South 
America, the economists found that a one-degree Celsius rise 
in temperature was associated with between a 1.2 and 1.9 per-
centage decline in municipal per capita income. Over time, as 
economies adapt to higher temperatures, approximately half 
of this effect disappears. Second, some of the adverse effects 
from higher temperatures seem to work through international 
trade. A one-degree Celsius increase in temperatures reduces 
poor countries’ exports between 2.0 and 5.7 percentage points. 
The effect appears to be concentrated within the agricultural 
and light manufacturing goods sectors.
The fact that poor countries are affected but not rich coun-
tries suggests that the timing of global warming may matter. If 
global warming can be deferred sufficiently far into the future, 
poorer countries will have opportunities to develop and perhaps 
be less subject to global warming trends. However, if global 
warming occurs relatively soon, then poor countries are likely 
to be adversely affected.  Related to Exercise 1.9.

Many people believe that global warming will hurt economic 
development, but research shows that the effects are more 
complex. Recent research by economists Melissa Dell, ­Benjamin 
Jones, and Benjamin Olken provides some useful insights. 
First, the adverse effects of increases in temperature seem to 
average growth rate for 16 currently developed countries from 1870 to 1979 against 
the level of per capita income in 1870. Each point represents a different country. 
Notice that the countries with the lowest initial per capita incomes are plotted higher 
on the graph. That is, they had higher growth rates than the countries with more 
income per capita. The downward-sloping line plotted through the points indicates 
that the countries with higher levels of per capita income in 1870 grew more slowly 
than countries with lower levels. In other words, the tendency was for countries with 
lower levels of initial income to grow faster and catch up. The graph shows that among 
the currently developed countries—for example, the United States, France, and the 
United ­Kingdom—there was a tendency for convergence over the last century.
Now let’s compare the countries that are currently less developed to the advanced 
industrial countries using the data in Table 8.1. Here, the picture is not so clear in 
recent times. While Mexico grew at a faster rate than the United States, Pakistan 
grew only 1.53 percent per year and fell farther behind advanced economies. In Africa, 
Nigeria grew at less than 1 percent per year, while real expenditures per capita actually 
fell in Zambia with its negative growth rate. In general, economists who have studied 
the process of economic growth in detail find weak evidence that poorer countries are 
currently closing the gap in per capita income with richer countries.
Indeed, in the last 20 years there has been little convergence. Economist Stanley 
Fischer, current Vice-Chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank and former governor of 
the Bank of Israel and professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, found 
that, on average, countries with higher GDP per capita in 1980 grew slightly faster 

Chapter 8 • Why Do Economies Grow?

from 1980 to 2000 than countries with lower GDP per capita.2 African countries, which 
were among the poorest, grew most slowly. However, there were some important 
exceptions: The two most populous countries, China and India, grew very rapidly. 
Because these countries contain approximately 35 percent of the world’s population, 
the good news is that living conditions for many people around the globe have there-
fore improved substantially in the last 20 years.
Other commentators are less sanguine. Professor Brad DeLong at UC Berkeley 
wrote, “Those nations and economies that were relatively rich at the start of the twenti-
eth century have by and large seen their material wealth and prosperity explode. Those 
nations and economies that were relatively poor have grown richer, but for the most 
part slowly. And the relative gulf between rich and poor economies has grown steadily. 
Today this relative gulf is larger than at any time in humanity’s previous experience, or 
at least larger than at any time since there were some tribes that had discovered how 
to use fire and other tribes that had not.”3
What about the distribution of income within countries as they develop? The 
research on this issue has not been conclusive. Inequality can either increase or decrease 
as a country grows.
 
Capital Deepening
One of the most important mechanisms of economic growth economists have identified 
is increases in the amount of capital per worker due to capital deepening.
In Chapter 7, we studied the effects of an increase in capital in a full-employment 
economy. Figure 8.3 shows the effects on output and real wages. For simplicity, we 
assume the supply of labor is not affected by real wages and therefore draw a vertical 
line (see Panel B). In Panel A, an increase in capital shifts the production function 
upward because more output can be produced from the same amount of labor. In 
addition, firms increase their demand for labor because the marginal benefit from

Behavioral Incentives in Development
Applying the Concepts #2: How can we persuade very poor people in developing  
countries to immunize their children?
Ester Duflo and Abhijit Banerjee of the Massachusetts Insti-
tute of Technology describe how they persuaded a group trying 
to increase immunizations to experiment with some economic 
incentive. They reasoned that the poor have increased difficul-
ties in doing things that are good in the long run, buy may be 
costly in the short run. In the experiment, parents would receive 
some dal (a common Indian food) after each shot for their chil-
dren. When they completed the entire sequence of shots, they 
would receive a set of cooking pans. The incentives worked 
extremely well in increasing the success rate for immunizations. 
Since the benefits of immunization for the health of the popula-
tion are very high, the costs of this plan could be justified on 
economic grounds.  Related to Exercise 1.10.

Affairs, 2011), Chapter 3.
As we described in the chapter-opening story, economists are 
now using controlled experiments to find out which policies 
really work in improving lives in developing countries. Public 
health officials in India noticed that parents typically would begin 
the process to give vaccines to their children, but often failed 
to finish the entire sequence of vaccines. Were there incentives 
that might work?

employing labor will increase. Panel B shows how the increase in capital raises the 
demand for labor and increases real wages. That is, as firms increase their demand and 
compete for a fixed supply of labor, they will bid up real wages in the economy.
An economy is better off with an increase in the stock of capital. With additions to 
the stock of capital, workers will enjoy higher wages, and total GDP in the economy 
will increase. Workers are more productive because each worker has more capital at 
his or her disposal. But how does an economy increase its stock of capital per worker? 
The answer is with saving and investment, which we discuss next.
Saving and Investment
Let’s begin with the simplest case: an economy with a constant population, producing 
at full employment. This particular economy has no government or foreign sector. Its 
output can be purchased only by consumers or by firms. In other words, output consists 
solely of consumption (C) and investment (I). At the same time, output generates an 
amount of income equivalent to the amount of output. That is, output (Y ) equals 
income. Any income that is not consumed we call saving.

Income that is not consumed.
▲  Figure 8.3  Increase in the Supply of Capital
An increase in the supply of capital will shift the production function upward, as shown in Panel A, and 
increase the demand for labor, as shown in Panel B. Real wages will increase from W1 to W2, and poten-
tial output will increase from Y1 to Y2.

In this economy, saving must equal investment. Here’s why: By definition, con-
sumption plus saving equals income:
C + S = Y
but at the same time income—which is equivalent to output—also equals consumption 
plus investment:
C + I = Y
Thus, saving must equal investment:
S = I
This means that whatever consumers decide to save goes directly into investment. Here 
is a simple way to remember this idea: A farmer produces corn (Y ) and can either con-
sume it directly (C) or set it aside as “seed corn” (I) for next year. The part the farmer 
sets aside and does not consume is also the farmer’s saving (S).
Next, we need to link the level of investment in the economy to the stock of capital 
in the economy. The stock of capital depends on two factors: investment and deprecia-
tion. The stock of capital increases with any gross investment spending but decreases 
with depreciation. Why does depreciation decrease the stock of capital? The answer is 
simple: As capital stock items such as buildings and equipment get older (depreciate), 
they wear out and become less productive. New investment is needed to replace the 
buildings and equipment that become obsolete.
Suppose, for example, the stock of capital at the beginning of the year is $10,000. 
During the year, if there were $1,000 in gross investment and $400 in depreciation, 
the capital stock at the end of the year would be $10,600 (=$10,000 + $1000 - $400).
It may be helpful to picture a bathtub. The level of water in the bathtub (the stock 
of capital) depends on the flow of water into the bathtub through the input faucet (gross 
investment) minus the flow of water out of the bathtub down the drain (depreciation). 
As long as the flow in exceeds the flow out, the water level in the bathtub (the stock of 
capital) will increase.
Higher saving, which leads to higher gross investment, will therefore tend to 
increase the stock of capital available for production. As the stock of capital grows, 
however, there typically will be more depreciation because there is more capital (build-
ing and equipment) to depreciate. It is the difference between gross investment and 
depreciation—net investment—that ultimately determines the change in the stock of 
capital for the economy, the level of real wages, and output. In our example, net invest-
ment is $1,000 - $400 = $600.
How Do Population Growth, Government, and Trade  
Affect Capital Deepening?
So far, we’ve considered the simplest economy. Let’s consider a more realistic economy 
that includes population growth, a government, and trade.
First, consider the effects of population growth: A larger labor force will allow the 
economy to produce more total output. However, with a fixed amount of capital and an 
increasing labor force, the amount of capital per worker will be less. With less capital 
per worker, output per worker will also be less because each worker has fewer machines 
to use. This is an illustration of the principle of diminishing returns.
P r i n c i p l e  o f  D i m i n i s h i n g  R e t u r n s 
Suppose that output is produced with two or more inputs and that 
we increase one input while holding the other inputs fixed. Beyond 
some point—called the point of diminishing returns—output will 
increase at a decreasing rate.

part 3
192
Consider India, the world’s second most populous country, with over a billion 
people. Although India has a large labor force, its amount of capital per worker is low. 
With sharp diminishing returns to labor, per capita output in India is low, only $5,350 
per person in 2013. 
The government can affect the process of capital deepening in several ways 
through its policies of spending and taxation. Suppose the government taxed its citi-
zens so that it could fight a war, pay its legislators higher salaries, or give foreign aid 
to needy ­countries—in other words, to engage in government consumption spending. 
The higher taxes will reduce total income. If consumers save a fixed fraction of their 
income, total private savings (savings from the nongovernmental sector) will fall. This 
taxation drains the private sector of savings that would have been used for capital 
deepening.
Now suppose the government took all the extra tax revenues and invested them 
in valuable infrastructure, such as roads, buildings, and airports. These infrastructure 
investments add to the capital stock. We illustrate this idea in Figure 8.4. If con-
sumers were saving 20 percent of their incomes and the government collected $100 
in taxes from each taxpayer, private saving and investment would fall by $20 per 
­taxpayer, but government investment in the infrastructure would increase by a full 
$100 per taxpayer. In other words, the government “forces” consumers (by taxing 
them) to invest an additional $80 in infrastructure that they otherwise wouldn’t 
invest. The net result is an increase in total social investment (private plus govern-
ment) of $80 per taxpayer.
▲  Figure 8.4  Taxes and Government Investment
If the government raises taxes by $100 and the people tend to save 20 percent of changes in income, 
then private savings and investment will fall by $20. However, if the government invests the funds, total 
investment—private and public—will increase by $80.

Finally, the foreign sector can affect capital deepening. The United States, Canada, 
and Australia built their vast railroad systems in the nineteenth century by running 
trade deficits—selling fewer goods and services to the rest of the world than they were 
buying—and financing this gap by borrowing. This enabled them to purchase the large 
amount of capital needed to build their rail networks and grow at more rapid rates by 
deepening capital. Eventually, these economies had to pay back the funds they had 
borrowed from abroad by running trade surpluses—selling more goods and services to 
the rest of the world than they were buying from abroad. But because economic growth 
had increased their GDP and wealth, the three countries were able to afford to pay 
back the borrowed funds. Therefore, this approach to financing deepening capital was 
a reasonable strategy for them to pursue.

Chapter 8 • Why Do Economies Grow?
193
Not all trade deficits promote capital deepening, however. Suppose a country runs 
a trade deficit because it wants to buy more consumer goods. The country would be 
borrowing from abroad, but there would be no additional capital deepening—just addi-
tional consumption spending. When the country is forced to pay back the funds, there 
will be no additional GDP to help foot the bill. In order to fund current consumption, 
the country will be poorer in the future.
The Key Role of Technological Progress
The other mechanism affecting economic growth is technological progress. Econo-
mists use the term technological progress in a very specific way: It means an economy 
operates more efficiently by producing more output without using any more inputs.
In practice, technological progress can take many forms. The invention of the 
light bulb made it possible to read and work indoors at night, the invention of the ther-
mometer assisted doctors and nurses in their diagnoses, and the invention of disposable 
diapers made life easier at home. All these examples—and you could provide many 
more—enable society to produce more output without more labor or more capital. 
With higher output per person, we enjoy a higher standard of living.
We can think of technological progress as the birth of new ideas. These new ideas 
enable us to rearrange our economic affairs and become more productive. Not all tech-
nological innovations are necessarily major scientific breakthroughs; some are much 
more basic. An employee of a soft-drink company who discovers a new and popular 
flavor for a soft drink is engaged in technological progress, just like scientists and engi-
neers. Even simple, commonsense ideas from workers or managers can help a business 
use its capital and labor more efficiently to deliver a better product to consumers at a 
lower price. For example, a store manager may decide that rearranging the layout of 
merchandise and the location of cash registers helps customers find products and pay 
for them more quickly and easily. This change is also technological progress. As long 
as there are new ideas, inventions, and new ways of doing things, the economy can 
become more productive and per capita output can increase.
How Do We Measure Technological Progress?
If someone asked you how much of the increase in your standard of living was due to 
technological progress, how would you answer? Robert Solow, a Nobel Laureate in 
economics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, developed a method for 
measuring technological progress in an economy. Like most good ideas, his theory was 
simple. It was based on the idea of a production function.
You know from Chapter 7 that the production function links inputs to outputs:
Y = F (K, L)
where output (Y ) is produced from capital (K) and labor (L), which are linked through 
the production function (F). What Solow did was include in the production function 
some measure of technological progress, A:
Y = F (K, L, A)
Increases in A represent technological progress. Higher values of A mean that more 
output is produced from the same level of inputs K and L. If we could find some way to 
measure A, we could estimate how much technological progress affects output.
Solow noted that over any period we can observe increases in capital, labor, and 
output. Using these we can measure technological progress indirectly. We first ask how 
much of the change in output can be explained by contributions from increases in the 
amount of capital and labor used. Whatever growth we cannot explain in this way must 
therefore be caused by technological progress. The method Solow developed to

measure the contributions to economic growth from capital, labor, and technological 
progress is called growth accounting.
Figure 8.5 illustrates the relative contributions of these growth sources for the 
U.S. economy from 1929 to 1982 using growth accounting, based on a classic study by 
economist Edward Denison. During this period, total output grew at a rate of nearly 
3 percent. Because capital and labor growth are measured at 0.56 and 1.34 percent 
per year, respectively, the remaining portion of output growth, 1.02 percent per year, 
must be due to technological progress. That means approximately 35 percent of output 
growth came directly from technological progress.

Other recent estimates give a similar picture of the contribution of technological 
progress to economic growth. For example, the Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates 
that between 1987 and 2007 technological progress accounted for 1.0 percentage points 
of economic growth in the private nonfarm business sector, very similar to Denison’s 
estimates.
Using Growth Accounting
Growth accounting is a useful tool for understanding different aspects of economic 
growth. As an example, economic growth slowed throughout the entire world during 
the 1970s. Using growth accounting methods, economists typically found the slow-
down could not be attributed to changes in the quality or quantity of labor inputs or 
to capital deepening. Either a slowdown in technological progress or other factors not 
directly included in the analysis, such as higher worldwide energy prices, must have 
been responsible. This led economists to suspect that higher energy prices were the 
primary explanation for the reduction in economic growth.
Review the next two applications that show how economists use growth account-
ing. The first compares growth in China and India, the second explores how growth 
accounting can help in making projections for long-run growth.
Before we complete our discussion of growth accounting, we introduce one more 
term. In analyses of the sources of economic growth, a common statistic reported about 
the U.S. economy is labor productivity. Defined as output per hour of work, labor 
productivity is a simple measure of how much a typical worker can produce given the 
amount of capital in the economy and the state of technological progress.

equipment) and increases in human capital (the knowledge 
of workers, as measured by their educational attainment). 
Their analysis revealed that China’s more rapid growth was 
primarily caused by more rapid accumulation of physical capi-
tal and more rapid technological progress. The contributions 
from human capital for each country were similar. Why did 
China grow faster than India over this 26-year period? Simply 
put, China invested much more than India in physical capital 
and was able to increase its technological progress at a more 
rapid rate.
Looking ahead, Bosworth and Collins find no evidence 
that growth in China and India is slowing. Capital formation and 
technological progress is still rapid in both countries and India 
has even improved its rate of technological advance in recent 
years. Despite this rapid growth and pockets of wealth in major 
cities, both countries are still poor: Chinese GNP per capita is 
only 15 percent and India’s GDP is only 8 percent of U.S. GNP 
per capita. But at these growth rates, the gap will diminish in the 
coming decades.  Related to Exercises 3.3 and 3.6.

China and India are the two most populous countries in the 
world and have also grown very rapidly in recent years. From 
1978 to 2004, GDP in China grew at the astounding rate of 
9.3 percent per year while India’s GDP grew at a lower but still 
robust rate of 5.4 percent per year. What were the sources of 
this growth? Economists Barry Bosworth from the Brookings 
Institution and Susan Collins from the University of Michigan 
used growth accounting to answer this question.
Employment in China and India both grew at 2 percent 
per year over the period, so the remaining differences must 
be attributed to capital deepening and technological progress. 
Bosworth and Collins in turn broke capital deepening into two 
parts: increases in physical capital (buildings, machines, and

explain these trends in productivity growth in the United States. Economic research 
suggests that the oil shocks in the 1970s reduced technological progress but the 
information revolution in the 1980s and 1990s led to a resurgence of technological 
progress.
What Causes Technological Progress?
Because technological progress is an important source of growth, we want to know 
how it occurs and what government policies can do to promote it. Economists have 
identified a variety of factors that may influence the pace of technological progress in 
an economy.
Research and Development Funding
One way for a country to induce more technological progress in its economy is to 
pay for it. If the government or large firms employ workers and scientists to advance 
the frontiers of knowledge in basic sciences, their work can lead to technological 
progress in the long run. Figure 8.7 presents data on the spending on research and 
development as a percent of GDP for seven major countries for 1999. The United 
States has the highest number of scientists and engineers in the world. However, 
although it spends the most money overall, as a percent of GDP the United States 
spends less than Japan. Moreover, a big part of U.S. spending on research and 
development is in defense-related areas, unlike in Japan. Some economists believe 
defense-related research and development is less likely to lead to long-run techno-
logical change than nondefense spending; however, many important technologi-
cal developments, including the Internet, partly resulted from military-sponsored 
research and development.

were concentrated in three waves. The first wave, from 1750 to 
1830, centered on steam generation and railroads; the second 
wave, from 1870 to 1900, was driven by the use of electric-
ity and communications; and the third wave, from 1960 to the 
present, was generated by telecommunications and computers. 
After each wave of innovation, growth continued for a while but 
would eventually decline.
Based on his own work using growth accounting, Gordon 
thinks we may have exhausted the benefits of the third wave of 
innovation. Thus, he is very pessimistic about the future. Others 
are more optimistic and believe that computer technology and 
the global interconnectedness of the Internet will allow room for 
more innovation and growth.  Related to Exercise 3.8.

Monopolies That Spur Innovation
The radical notion that monopolies spur innovation was put forth by economist Joseph 
Schumpeter. In Schumpeter’s view, a firm will try to innovate—that is, come up with 
new products and more efficient ways to produce existing products—only if it reaps a 
reward. The reward a firm seeks from its innovations is high profit, and it can obtain 
a high profit if it is the sole seller, or monopolist, for the product. Other firms will try 
to break the firm’s monopoly through more innovation, a process Schumpeter called 
creative destruction. Schumpeter believed that by allowing firms to compete to 
become monopolies, society benefits from increased innovation.
Governments do allow temporary monopolies for new ideas by issuing patents. 
A patent allows the inventor of a product to have a monopoly until the term of the 
patent expires, which in the United States is now 20 years. With a patent, we tolerate 
some monopoly power (the power to raise prices that comes with limited competition) 
in the hope of spurring innovation.
An idea related to patents that is becoming increasingly important is the need to 
protect intellectual property rights. Information technology has made possible the free 
flow of products and ideas around the world. Publishers of both books and computer 
software face problems of unauthorized copying, particularly in some developing coun-
tries. While residents of those countries clearly benefit from inexpensively ­copied books 
or software, producers in the developed countries then face reduced incentives to enter 
the market. Even in the United States, pirated music and movies pose a threat to the 
viability of the entertainment industry. Large and profitable firms may ­continue to pro-
duce despite unauthorized copying, but other firms may be discouraged. The United 
States has put piracy and unauthorized reproduction among its top agenda items in 
recent trade talks with several countries.
The Scale of the Market
Adam Smith stressed that the size of a market was important for economic devel-
opment. In larger markets, firms have more incentives to come up with new prod-
ucts and new methods of production. Just as Schumpeter suggested, the lure of 
creative destruction
The view that a firm will try to come up 
with new products and more efficient ways 
to produce products to earn monopoly 
profits.

profits guides the activities of firms, and larger markets provide firms the opportu-
nity to make larger profits. This supplies another rationale for free trade. With free 
trade, markets are larger, and there is more incentive to engage in technological 
progress.
Induced Innovations
Some economists have emphasized that innovations come about through inven-
tive  activity designed specifically to reduce costs. This is known as induced 
­innovation. For example, during the nineteenth century in the United States, the 
largest single cost in agriculture was wages. Ingenious farmers and inventors came 
up with many different machines and methods to cut back on the amount of labor 
required.
Education, Human Capital, and the Accumulation of Knowledge
Education can contribute to economic growth in two ways. First, the increased knowl-
edge and skills of people complement our current investments in physical capital. Sec-
ond, education can enable the workforce in an economy to use its skills to develop new 
ideas or to copy ideas or import them from abroad. Consider a developing country 
today. In principle, it has at its disposal the vast accumulated knowledge of the devel-
oped economies. But using this knowledge probably requires a skilled workforce—one 
reason why many developing countries send their best students to educational institu-
tions in developed countries.
Increasing knowledge and skills are part of human capital—an investment in 
human beings. Human capital is as important, maybe even more important, than physi-
cal capital. Many economists, including Nobel Laureate Gary Becker of the University 
of Chicago, have studied human capital in detail.
A classic example of human capital is the investment a student makes to attend 
college. The costs of attending college consist of the direct out-of-pocket costs (tuition 
and fees) plus the opportunity costs of forgone earnings while at school. The benefits 
of attending college are the higher wages and more interesting jobs offered to college 
graduates compared to high school graduates. Individuals decide to attend college 
when these benefits exceed the costs, and it is a rational economic decision. A similar 
calculation faces a newly graduated doctor who must decide whether to pursue a spe-
cialty. Will the forgone earnings of a general physician (which are quite substantial) 
be worth the time spent learning a specialty that will eventually result in extra income? 
We can analyze investments in health and nutrition within the same framework. The 
benefits of regular exercise and watching your weight are a healthier lifestyle and 
higher energy level.
Human capital theory has two implications for understanding economic growth. 
First, not all labor is equal. When economists measure the labor input in a country, 
they must adjust for differing levels of education. These levels of education reflect past 
investments in education and skills; individuals with higher educational levels will, on 
average, be more productive. Second, health and fitness also affect productivity. In 
developing countries, economists have found a strong correlation between the height 
of individuals (reflecting their health) and the wages they can earn in the farming sector.
Human capital theory can also serve as a basis for important public policy deci-
sions. Should a developing country invest in capital (either public or private) or in 
education? The poorest developing countries lack good sanitation systems, effective 
transportation, and capital investment for agriculture and industry. However, the best 
use of investment funds may not be for bridges, sewer systems, and roads, but for 
human capital and education. Studies demonstrate that the returns from investing in 
education are extremely high in developing countries. The gains from elementary and 
secondary education, in particular, often exceed the gains from more conventional 
investments. In developing countries, an extra year in school can often raise individuals’ 
wages by 15–20 percent a year.

New Growth Theory
For many years, economists who studied technological progress typically did so inde-
pendently of economists who studied models of economic growth. But starting in the 
mid-1980s, several economists, including Nobel Laureate Robert E. Lucas of the Uni-
versity of Chicago and Paul Romer of Stanford University, began to develop models 
of growth that contained technological progress as essential features. Their work 
helped to initiate what is known as new growth theory, which accounts for technologi-
cal progress within a model of economic growth.
In this field, economists study, for example, how incentives for research and devel-
opment, new product development, or international trade interact with the accumu-
lation of physical capital. New growth theory enables economists to address policy 
issues, such as whether subsidies for research and development are socially justified and 
whether policies that place fewer taxes on income earned from investment will spur 
economic growth or increase economic welfare. Current research in economic growth 
now takes place within a broad framework that includes explanations of technological 
progress. As an example, new growth theory suggests that investment in comprehen-
sive education in a developing country will lead to permanent increases in the rate of 
technological progress as the workforce will be better able to incorporate new ideas 
and technologies into the workplace.
Some researchers also suggest the type of education might also matter for techno-
logical innovation. Philippe Aghion of Harvard University and Peter Howitt of Brown 
University make the case that when a country is far behind the world’s technological 
frontier, it is best for that country to invest in relatively basic education so that the 
workforce can essentially copy the changes that are occurring in the more advanced 
economies. But once an economy reaches the world’s technological frontier, invest-
ment in the most advanced higher education might be most advantageous.4
New growth theory suggests that any social factor influencing the willingness 
of individuals to pursue technological advancement will be a key to understanding 
new growth theory

to explain the origins of technological 
progress.

The Role of Political Factors in Economic Growth
Applying the Concepts #5: How do varying political institutions affect economic growth?
in time, China, Spain, Turkey, and ancient Greece and Rome all 
exhibited technological innovation and economic growth.
But transformative economic growth, such as the world 
witnessed with the Industrial Revolution that began in western 
Europe in the late 1700s, typically requires more participatory 
institutions. The key reason is that sustained technological prog-
ress is disruptive and authoritarian regimes have difficulty cop-
ing with all the subsequent changes. Acemoglu highlights the 
fall in the old, authoritarian regimes in Europe and the rise of 
constitutional or limited monarchies that set the preconditions 
for the birth of the Industrial Revolution.
Acemoglu’s theory does raise important questions for 
today. Can China, with its authoritarian political culture, con-
tinue to grow without eventual political transformation? If that 
does eventually come, can it be absorbed peacefully within the 
society?  Related to Exercise 4.6.
SOURCE: Based on Daron Acemoglu, epilogue to Introduction to Modern Eco-
nomic Growth (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2009).
Economist Daron Acemoglu of the Massachusetts Institute 
of Technology has written extensively about the role of politi-
cal institutions and economic growth. Acemoglu distinguishes 
broadly between two types of political institutions: authoritarian 
institutions, such as monarchies, dictatorships, or tightly con-
trolled oligarchies, and participatory institutions, such as con-
stitutionally limited monarchies and democracies. History has 
witnessed growth under both types of regimes. At various points

economic growth. Can cultural factors also play a role? Historical sociologist Max 
Weber argued that changes in religious beliefs could help us understand growth, as he 
emphasized how the rise of Protestantism, with its emphasis on the individual, set the 
stage for the Industrial Revolution in Europe. This thesis has always been controver-
sial because the links between changes in religious beliefs and changes in economic or 
other behaviors are not well understood. More recently, Professor Gregory Clark has 
emphasized how the growth of middle-class values in England could possibly explain 
why the Industrial Revolution began there.
A Key Governmental Role: Providing the Correct 
Incentives and Property Rights
As we discussed in Chapter 3, governments play a critical role in a market economy. 
They must enforce the rules of the market economy, using police powers to ensure that 
contracts are upheld, individual property rights are enforced, and firms can enter safely 
into economic transactions. Although we may take these features of our economy for 
granted, not all countries enjoy the benefits of clear enforcement of property rights.
What is the connection between property rights and economic growth? With-
out clear property rights, there are no proper incentives to invest in the future—the 
essence of economic growth. Suppose, for example, that you lived on land that needed

Culture, Evolution, and Economic Growth
Applying the Concept #6: Did culture or evolution spark the Industrial Revolution?
According to Professor Clark, this change had profound 
effects on English society. The cultural habits of the rich fil-
tered through the entire society. Social virtues such as thrift, 
prudence, and hard work became more commonplace, while 
impulsive and violent behaviors were reduced. Eventually, these 
changes in culture became sufficiently pronounced that a quali-
tative change took place in society. Individuals now were able to 
take advantage of new developments in science and technology 
and embrace new technologies and social change.
Economists Oded Galor and Omer Moav suggest that devel-
opment can be viewed in more traditional evolutionary terms. 
They argue that at some point during the human evolutionary 
process, families that had fewer children but invested more in 
them gained a competitive advantage in the evolutionary cycle. 
The offspring of these families had more human capital and more 
easily adapted to technological progress and the other changes 
that were taking place in societies. Human genetic evolution, in 
their view, set the stage for the Industrial Revolution. Both views 
share some similarities. According to Clark, the evolution was 
primarily cultural, whereas for Galor and Moav it was genetic. In 
both cases, however, humans transformed themselves as the 
Industrial Revolution began.  Related to Exercise 4.10.
SOURCES: Based on Gregory Clark, A Farewell to Alms (Princeton, NJ: Princeton 
University Press, 2007) and Oded Galor and Omer Moav, “Natural Selection and 
the Origin of Economic Growth,” Quarterly Journal of Economics (November 2002), 
pp. 1133–1191.
In studying the economic history of England before the Industrial 
Revolution, Professor Gregory Clark discovered an interesting 
fact. Examining archival data on wills and estates, he found that 
children of the more affluent members of English society were 
more likely to survive than those of the less affluent. Coupled 
with the slow growth of population over several centuries, this 
differential survival of the wealthy had the effect of creating 
downward mobility for the rich, as their sons and daughters 
increasingly populated the society.

costly improvements in order to be made valuable. You might be willing to make the 
investment in these improvements if you were sure you would gain the economic 
benefits from making them. But suppose there was a risk someone else would reap the 
­benefits—in that case, you would not have incentive to invest.
Clear property rights are, unfortunately, lacking in many developing countries 
throughout the world. As many economists have argued, their absence has severely 
impeded the growth of these economies.
Governments also have a broader role in designing the institutions in which indi-
viduals and firms work, save, and invest. Economists have increasingly recognized the 
importance of these institutions in determining economic growth. For example, the 
residents of Hong Kong link their rapid economic growth to free and open institu-
tions that provide the right incentives for technological innovations. They wanted to 
preserve these institutions after they officially became part of China in 1997 and have 
indeed been successful in maintaining an open society.
But for many countries, growth has been more elusive. For many years, interna-
tional organizations such as the World Bank—a consortium of countries created to 
promote development—have tried a variety of diverse methods to assist developing 
countries. These have included increases in foreign aid, infusions of new machinery, 
promotion of universal education, and efforts to stem population growth. Despite these 
efforts, some areas of the world, such as sub-Saharan Africa, have failed to grow at all.
William Easterly, a former World Bank economist, believes the World Bank and 
other international organizations have failed to take into account one of the basic laws 
of economics: Individuals and firms respond to incentives. According to Easterly, gov-
ernments in developing countries have failed to provide the proper economic environ-
ment that would motivate individuals and firms to take actions that promote economic

Lack of Property Rights Hinders Growth In Peru

in developing countries?
investments to improve their lives. But there are other important 
consequences as well.
Economists recognize that strong credit systems—the 
ability to borrow and lend easily—are critical to the health of 
developing economies. But without clear title, people cannot 
use property as collateral (or security) for loans. As a conse-
quence, the poor may in fact be living on very valuable land, 
but are unable to borrow against that land to start a new busi-
ness. Also, the types of investments made will depend on the 
availability of credit. DeSoto observed that producing palm oil 
in Peru is very profitable, but it takes time and depends on the 
ability to borrow funds. Production of coca paste—an ingredient 
of cocaine—does not take as much time and does not depend 
on finance. It is also a plague on the developed world. Switching 
farmers away from production of coca paste to palm oil requires 
improvements in finance, which are very difficult without clear 
property rights.  Related to Exercise 5.7.
SOURCE: Based on Hernando DeSoto, The Mystery of Capital: Why Capitalism 
Triumphs in the West and Fails Everywhere Else (New York: Basic Books, 2000).
On the hills surrounding Lima, Peru, and many other South 
American cities, large numbers of residents live in urban slums, 
many having taken over these lands through “urban invasions.” 
Many families have resided in these dwellings for a long time, 
and most have basic water, sewage, and electricity. But what 
they don’t have is clear titles to their properties.
Hernando DeSoto, a Peruvian economist and author of The 
Mystery of Capital, has studied the consequences of “informal 
ownership” in detail. He argues that throughout the developing 
world, property is often held without clear title. Without this evi-
dence of ownership, people are not willing to make long-term 

202
development.5 As an example, providing free schooling is not enough—individuals 
need to know their investments in education will pay off in the future in terms of higher 
incomes or better jobs. Without the prospect that it will lead to an improvement in 
their lives, individuals will not make the effort to obtain an education.
What else can go wrong? Governments in developing countries often adopt poli-
cies that effectively tax exports, pursue policies that lead to rampant inflation, and 
enforce laws that inhibit the growth of the banking and financial sectors. The results are 
predictable: fewer exports, an uncertain financial environment, and reduced saving and 
investment. All these outcomes can cripple an economy’s growth prospects. Sometimes 
they are based on bad economic advice. Other times, racial or ethnic groups in polar-
ized societies use the economic system to take advantage of their rivals.
What can be done? In Easterly’s view, the World Bank and other international 
organizations need to stop searching for the magic bullet for development. Instead, 
they should hold governments responsible for creating the proper economic environ-
ment. With the right incentives, Easterly believes individuals and firms in developing 
countries will take actions that promote economic growth.
In this chapter, we explored 
the mechanisms of eco-
nomic growth. Although 
economists do not have a 
complete understanding of 
what leads to growth, they 
regard increases in capital 
per worker, technological 
progress, human capital, and governmental institutions as key fac-
tors. Here are the main points to remember:
1.	 Per capita GDP varies greatly throughout the world. There is 
debate about whether poorer countries in the world are converg-
ing in per capita incomes to richer countries.
2.	 Economies grow through two basic mechanisms: capital deep-
ening and technological progress. Capital deepening is an 
increase in capital per worker. Technological progress is an 
increase in output with no additional increases in inputs.
3.	 Ongoing technological progress will lead to sustained economic 
growth.
4.	 Various theories try to explain the origins of technological 
progress and determine how we can promote it. They include 
spending on research and development, creative destruction, 
the scale of the market, induced inventions, and education and 
the accumulation of knowledge, including investments in human 
capital.
5.	 Governments can play a key role in designing institutions that 
promote economic growth, including providing secure property 
rights.

Economic Growth Rates
Calculate economic growth rates.
1.1	 To gauge living standards across countries with popu-
lations of different sizes, economists use ____________.
1.2	 In poor countries, the relative prices for nontraded 
goods (such as household services) to traded goods (such 
as jewelry) are ____________ than in rich countries.
1.3	 If an economy experiences an increase in the amount 
of capital stock per worker, we say that the economy is 
experiencing capital deepening. ____________ (True/
False)
1.4	 ____________ is the knowledge and skills acquired by 
a worker through education and experience and used 
to produce goods and services.
1.5	 Learning to Look Up Data. Go to the Web site for 
the World Economic Outlook Database of the Inter-
national Monetary Fund at www.imf.org/external/pubs/
ft/weo/2012/01/weodata/index.aspx and create a table 
for 10 countries of your choosing showing GDP per 
capita adjusted for purchasing power parity in current 
international dollars for 2010 and 2011 and forecasts 
for 2012–2014. Start by clicking on the “By Countries” 
link and then make your choices and prepare your 
report.
1.6	 Will the Poorer Country Catch Up? Suppose one 
country has a GDP that is one-eighth the GDP of its 
richer neighbor. But the poorer country grows at 10 
percent a year, while the richer country grows at 2 
percent a year. In 35 years, which country will have a 
higher GDP? (Hint: Use the rule of 70.)
1.7	 Understanding Convergence in a Figure. Suppose 
the line in Figure 8.2 was upward-sloping. What would 
that tell us about economic convergence?
1.8	 Growth in Per Capita GDP. The growth rate of real 
GDP per capita equals the growth rate of real GDP 
minus the growth rate of the population. If the growth 
rate of the population is 1 percent per year, how fast 
must real GDP grow for real GDP per capita to double 
in 14 years?
1.9	 Economic Growth and Global Warning. Basing 
your answer on the research reported in the text, is it 
likely that India is more vulnerable now to increases 
in temperatures than it will be in 20 years? (Related to 
Application 1 on page 188.)
1.10	 Controlled Experiment? Suppose a health worker 
visited one village and personally gave residents candy 
in order to take vaccinations. In this village, vaccina-
tion rates increased. Is this strong evidence that using 
candy as an incentive would increase vaccination rates? 
(Related to Application 2 on page 189.)
1.11	 Comparing Economic Performance Using Interna-
tional GDP Data. The Web site for the latest data for 
the Penn World Tables (www.rug.nl/research/ggdc/data/
pwt) contains historical economic data. Using this link, 
compare the relative growth performance for real GDP 
per capita of Italy and the United States from 1950 to 
2000. Do the data support the theory of convergence 
for these two countries?
Capital Deepening
Explain the role of capital in economic growth.
2.1	 In an economy with no government sector or foreign 
sector, saving must equal investment because
a.	 total demand is equal to consumption and 
investment.
b.	total income is equal to consumption and saving.
c.	 total income is equal to total demand.
d.	All of the above
e.	None of the above
2.2	 If the capital stock remains fixed while labor decreases, 
the new labor is likely to be ____________ (more/less) 
productive than the old labor because of diminishing 
returns.
2.3	 If the private sector saves 10 percent of its income and 
the government raises taxes by $200 to finance pub-
lic investments, total investment—private and public 
investment—will increase by ____________.
2.4	 An increase in the capital stock can decrease out-
put without a corresponding labor force decrease. 
____________ (True/False)
2.5	 Policies That Promote Capital Deepening. Which 
of the following will promote economic growth 
through capital deepening?
a.	 Higher taxes used to finance universal health care
b.	Increased imports to purchase new flat-screen TVs 
for consumers
c.	 Increased imports to purchase supercomputers for 
industry
2.6	 Diminishing Returns to Capital and Real Wages. 
Explain why this statement is wrong: “Since capital is 
subject to diminishing returns, an increase in the sup-
ply of capital will reduce real wages.”
2.7	 Government Spending, Taxes, and Investment. 
Suppose a government places a 10 percent tax on 
incomes and spends half the money from taxes on

investment and half on public consumption goods, such 
as military parades. Individuals save 20 percent of their 
income and consume the rest. Does total investment 
(public and private) increase or decrease in this case?
2.8	 Trade Deficits: Capital Deepening or Consump-
tion? Suppose a country that had balanced trade began 
to run a trade deficit. At the same time, consumption 
as a share of GDP increased but the investment share 
did not. Do you think there was an increase in capital 
deepening?
The Key Role of Technological Progress
Explain the importance of technological progress to 
economic growth.
3.1	 Robert Solow added ____________ to the conven-
tional production function to account for technological 
change.
3.2	 ____________ is a method used to determine the con-
tribution to economic growth from increased capital, 
labor, and technological progress.
3.3	 China has a higher rate of technological progress 
than India. ____________ (True/False) (Related to 
­Application 3 on page 195.)
3.4	 In growth accounting, the three sources of growth 
for a country are capital, labor, and natural resources. 
____________ (True/False)
3.5	 Technological Progress in Banking. Computers 
have revolutionized banking for consumers through 
the growth of ATMs and electronic bill-paying capa-
bilities. Why might not all of these improvements for 
consumers be counted as technological progress?
3.6	 Foreign Investment and Technological Progress. 
Many economists believe countries that open them-
selves to foreign investment of plant and equipment 
will benefit in terms of increased technological change 
because local companies will learn from the foreign 
companies. For the last several decades, China has 
been more open to foreign investment than India. 
India, however, has now begun to open up its markets 
to foreign investment. Explain how this is consistent 
with the two countries’ patterns of economic growth. 
What do you think may happen in the future? (Related 
to Application 3 on page 195.)
3.7	 Coke and Pepsi. Soft-drink companies spend a con-
siderable amount of money on marketing. Explain 
why these expenditures could be considered a form of 
­capital.
3.8	 Growth Optimists. Some growth optimists believe 
we have yet to harness the full powers of computer 
software and Internet technology for consumer goods. 
Give several examples of consumer products that were 
developed in the last few years that build on this tech-
nology. (Related to Application 4 on page 196.)
3.9	 Health Insurance, Wages, and Compensation. 
In recent years, total compensation of employees—­
including benefits—has grown, but wages, not includ-
ing benefits, have not. Explain why this may have 
occurred, taking into account that many employ-
ers provide health insurance to their employees and 
health-care costs have grown more rapidly than GDP. 
Is health insurance “free” to employees?
What Causes Technological Progress?
Discuss the sources of technological progress.
4.1	 Who developed the theory of scale of the market?
a.	 Joseph Schumpeter
b.	Milton Friedman
c.	 Adam Smith
d.	John Maynard Keynes
4.2	 The notion that innovation is promoted by the com-
petitive desire to break production monopolies is 
known as creative destruction. ____________ (True/
False)
4.3	 Which of the following may influence technological 
progress?
a.	 The scale of the market
b.	Monopolies
c.	 Research and development spending
d.	All of the above
4.4	 A policy of not enforcing patents or copyrights would 
____________ the incentive to be innovative.
4.5	 Cutting the Length of Patents. Suppose a group of 
consumer activists claims drug companies earn exces-
sive profits because of the patents they have on drugs. 
The activists advocate cutting the length of time that a 
drug company can hold a patent to 5 years. They argue 
that this will lead to lower prices for drugs because 
competitors will enter the market after the 5-year 
period. Do you see any drawbacks to this proposal?
4.6	 Dictatorships and Economic Growth. Discuss this 
quote: “With a strong economy, dictators could raise 
more money for armies and police to help keep them-
selves in power. Therefore, dictators should welcome 
rapid economic growth.” (Related to Application 5 on 
page 199.)
4.7	 Taxes and Induced Innovations Suppose a country 
imposed heavy taxes to increase the price of gasoline. 
How would this affect the incentive to develop battery-
powered automobiles?
4.8	 Height and Weight during Rapid Industrializa-
tion. Economic historians have found that the aver-
age height of individuals in both the United States and 
the United Kingdom fell during the mid-nineteenth 
century before rising again. This was a period of rapid 
industrialization as well as migration into urban areas. 

205
What factors do you think might account for this fall 
in height and how would it affect your evaluation of 
economic welfare during the period?
4.9	 Going to Law School at the Age of 50. Although 
we might admire someone who decides to attend law 
school at the age of 50, explain using human capital 
theory why this is so rare.
4.10	 Timing and Cultural Explanations of Economic 
Growth. Some critics of cultural theories of economic 
growth note that some societies can suddenly start 
to grow very rapidly with no obvious accompanying 
cultural changes. How well does Professor Gregory 
Clark’s theory fit the rapid growth in some East Asian 
economies in recent years? (Related to Application 6 
on page 200.)
A Key Governmental Role: Providing the Correct Incen-
tives and Property Rights
Assess the role of government in assisting economic growth.
5.1	 Clear property rights reduce growth in an economy 
because producers are not able to freely use innova-
tions. ____________ (True/False)
5.2	 Which of the following events hinder economic 
growth?
a.	 Uncertain financial environment
b.	Reduced savings and investment
c.	 Decreased exports
d.	All of the above
5.3	 Economist William Easterly is a strong proponent of 
foreign aid. ____________ (True/False)
5.4	 Old growth theory suggests that consumption spending 
will lead to permanent increases in the rate of techno-
logical progress. ____________ (True/False)
5.5	 Diversity and Economic Growth. Some economists 
and political scientists have suggested that when com-
munities are more racially or ethnically diverse, they 
invest less in education and spend more on private 
goods. Assuming this theory is true, what are the con-
sequences for economic growth?
5.6	 The “Brain Drain” and Incentives for Education. 
Some economists are concerned about the “brain 
drain,” the phenomenon in which highly educated 
workers leave developing countries to work in devel-
oped countries. Other economists have argued that 
“brain drain” could create incentives for others in the 
country to secure increased education, and many of 
the newly educated might not emigrate. Explain why 
the “brain drain” could lead to increased education 
among the remaining residents. How would you test 
this theory?
5.7	 Secure Property Rights and Work outside the 
Home. With secure land titles, parents can work out-
side the home (rather than guarding their property) and 
earn higher incomes. Explain why this might reduce 
child labor. (Related to Application 7 on page 201.)

A Model Of Capital Deepening
Here’s a simple model showing the links among saving, depreciation, and capital deep-
ening. Developed by Nobel Laureate Robert Solow of the Massachusetts Institute 
of Technology, the Solow model will help us understand more fully the critical role 
technological progress must play in economic growth. We rely on one of our basic 
principles of economics to help explain the model as well as make a few simplifying 
assumptions. We assume constant population and no government or foreign sector. 
In the chapter, we discussed the qualitative effects of population growth, government, 
and the foreign sector on capital deepening. Here we focus solely on the relationships 
among saving, depreciation, and capital deepening. Figure 8A.1 plots the relationship 
in the economy between output and the stock of capital, holding the labor force con-
stant. Notice that output increases as the stock of capital increases, but at a decreasing 
rate. This is an illustration of the principle of diminishing returns.
▲  Figure 8A.1  Diminishing Returns to Capital

Increasing the stock of capital while holding the labor force constant will increase 
output, but at a decreasing rate.
As Figure 8A.1 indicates, output increases with the stock of capital. But what causes 
the stock of capital to increase? The capital stock will increase as long as gross invest-
ment exceeds depreciation. Therefore, we need to determine the level of gross invest-
ment and the level of depreciation to see how the capital stock changes over time.
Recall that without government or a foreign sector, saving equals gross investment. 
Thus, to determine the level of investment, we need to specify how much of output is 
P r i n c i p l e  O f  D i m i n i s h i n g  R e t u r n s 
Suppose output is produced with two or more inputs and we 
increase one input while holding the other inputs fixed. Beyond 
some point—called the point of diminishing returns—output will 
increase at a decreasing rate.

207
saved and how much is consumed. We will assume that a fraction s of total output (Y ) is 
saved. For example, if s = 0.20, then 20 percent of GDP would be saved and 80 percent 
would be consumed. Total saving will be sY, the product of the saving rate and total output.
In Panel A of Figure 8A.2, the top curve is total output as a function of the stock 
of capital. The curve below it represents saving as a function of the stock of capital. 
Because saving is a fixed fraction of total output, the saving curve is a constant fraction 
of the output curve. If the saving rate is 0.2, saving will always be 20 percent of output 
for any level of the capital stock. Total saving increases in the economy with the stock 
of capital, but at a decreasing rate.
To complete our model, we need to determine depreciation. Let’s say the capital 
stock depreciates at a constant rate of d per year. If d = 0.03, the capital stock would 
depreciate at 3 percent per year. If the capital stock were 100 at the beginning of the 
year, depreciation would equal 3. Total depreciation can be written as dK, where K is 
the stock of capital.
Panel B of Figure 8A.2 plots total depreciation as a function of the stock of capital. 
The larger the stock of capital, the more total depreciation there will be. Because the 
depreciation rate is assumed to be constant, total depreciation as a function of the stock 
of capital will be a straight line through the origin. Then if there is no capital, there 
will be no depreciation, no matter what the depreciation rate.

If the depreciation rate is 3 percent and the stock of capital is 100, depreciation will 
be 3; if the stock of capital is 200, the depreciation rate will be 6. Plotting these points 
will give a straight line through the origin.
We are now ready to see how the stock of capital changes:
change in the stock of capital = saving - depreciation = sY - dK
The stock of capital will increase—the change will be positive—as long as total saving 
in the economy exceeds depreciation.
Figure 8A.3 shows how the Solow model works by plotting output, saving, and 
depreciation all on one graph. Suppose the economy starts with a capital stock K0. Then 
total saving will be given by point a on the saving schedule. Depreciation at the capital 
stock K0 is given by point b. Because a lies above b, total saving exceeds depreciation, 
and the capital stock will increase. As the capital stock increases, there will be economic 
growth through capital deepening. With more capital per worker in the economy, 
output is higher and real wages increase. The economy benefits from the additional 
stock of capital.
Using the graph, we can trace the future for this economy. As the stock of capi-
tal increases, we move to the right. When the economy reaches K1, total saving is at 
point c and total depreciation is at point d. Because c is still higher than d, saving exceeds 
depreciation and the capital stock continues to increase. Economic growth continues. 

208
Eventually, after many years, the economy reaches capital stock K*. The level of output 
in the economy now is Y *, and the saving and depreciation schedules intersect at point 
e. Because total saving equals depreciation, the stock of capital no longer increases. The 
process of economic growth through capital deepening has stopped.
In this simple model, the process of capital deepening must eventually come to an 
end. As the stock of capital increases, output increases, but at a decreasing rate because 
of diminishing returns. Because saving is a fixed fraction of output, it will also increase 
but at a diminishing rate. On the other hand, total depreciation is proportional to the 
stock of capital. As the stock of capital increases, depreciation will always catch up with 
total saving in the economy. It may take decades for the process of capital deepening 
to come to an end. But as long as total saving exceeds depreciation, the process of 
economic growth through capital deepening will continue.
What would happen if a society saved a higher fraction of its output? Figure 8A.4 
shows the consequences of a higher saving rate. Suppose the economy were origi-
nally saving at a rate s1. Eventually, the economy would reach e1, where saving and

depreciation meet. If the economy had started to save at the higher rate s2, saving 
would exceed depreciation at K1, and the capital stock would increase until the economy 
reached K2. At K2, the saving line again crosses the line representing depreciation. 
Output is higher than it was initially, but the process of capital deepening stops at this 
higher level of output.
If there is ongoing technological progress, economic growth can continue. If tech-
nological progress raises GDP, saving will increase as well because saving increases 
with GDP. This will lead to a higher stock of capital. In Figure 8A.5, technological 
progress is depicted as an upward shift of the saving function. The saving function shifts 
up because saving is a fixed fraction of output, and we have assumed that technological 
progress has raised the level of output.

With a higher level of saving, the stock of capital will increase. If the stock of capi-
tal were originally at K0, the upward shift in the saving schedule will lead to increases 
in the stock of capital to K1. If there is further technological progress, capital deepening 
will continue.
Technological progress conveys a double benefit to a society. Not only does the 
increased efficiency directly raise per capita output, it also leads to additional capital 
deepening. Therefore, output increases for two reasons.
Let’s summarize the basic points of the Solow model:
1	 Capital deepening, an increase in the stock of capital per worker, will occur as 
long as total saving exceeds depreciation. As capital deepening occurs, there will 
be economic growth and increased real wages.
2	 Eventually, the process of capital deepening will come to a halt as depreciation 
catches up with total saving.
3	 A higher saving rate will promote capital deepening. If a country saves more, it 
will have a higher output. But eventually, the process of economic growth through 
capital deepening alone comes to an end, even though this may take decades to 
occur.
4	 Technological progress not only directly raises output, but also it allows capital 
deepening to continue.

C h a p t e r
Why do recessions occur? 
And are all recessions alike?
Recessions are massive failures in economic coor-
dination. For example, during the Great Depression 
in the 1930s, nearly one-fourth of the U.S. labor 
force was unemployed. Unemployed workers could 
not afford to buy goods and services. Factories that 
manufactured those goods and services had to be 
shut down because there was little or no demand. As 
these factories closed, even more workers became 
unemployed, fueling additional factory shutdowns. 
This vicious cycle caused the U.S. economy to spiral 
downward. This failure of coordination is not just a 
historical phenomenon. In December 2007 the ­economy also entered a very steep downturn—although not nearly 
as severe as the Great Depression.
But are all recessions caused by the same factors? Not all recessions have the same characteristics and causes. 
Both during the Great Depression and the most recent recession, there were massive failures of financial institutions. 
However, in other recessions, such as in the 1970s and 1980s, changes in oil prices and government actions to fight 
inflation played key roles. Understanding why recessions occur is important for diagnosing policies to cure them.

conomies do not always operate at full employment, nor do they always grow 
smoothly. At times, real GDP grows below its potential or falls steeply, as it did 
in the Great Depression. Recessions and excess unemployment occur when real 
GDP falls. At other times, GDP grows too rapidly, and unemployment falls below its 
natural rate.
“Too slow” or “too fast” real GDP growth are examples of economic fluctuations—
movements of GDP away from potential output. We now turn our attention to under-
standing these economic fluctuations, which are also called business cycles.
During the Great Depression, there was a failure in coordination. Factories would 
have produced more output and hired more workers if there had been more demand for 
their products. In his 1936 book, The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money, 
British economist John Maynard Keynes explained that insufficient demand for goods 
and services was a key problem of the Great Depression. Following the publication of 
Keynes’s work, economists began to distinguish between real GDP in the long run, 
when prices have time to fully adjust to changes in demand, and real GDP in the short 
run, when prices don’t yet have time to fully adjust to changes in demand. During the 
short run, economic coordination problems are most pronounced. In the long run, 
however, economists believe the economy will return to full employment, although 
economic policy may assist it in getting there more quickly.
In the previous two chapters, we analyzed the economy at full employment and 
studied economic growth. Those chapters provided the framework for analyzing the 
behavior of the economy in the long run, but not in the short run, when there can be 
sharp fluctuations in output. We therefore need to develop an additional set of tools 
to analyze both short- and long-run changes and the relationship between the two.
Sticky Prices and Their Macroeconomic Consequences
Why do recessions occur? We previously discussed how real adverse shocks to the 
economy could cause economic downturns. We also outlined the theory of real busi-
ness cycles, which focuses on how shocks to technology cause economic fluctuations. 
Now we examine another approach to understanding economic fluctuations.
Led by Keynes, many economists have focused attention on economic coordina-
tion problems. Normally, the price system efficiently coordinates what goes on in an 
economy—even in a complex economy. The price system provides signals to firms as 
to who buys what, how much to produce, what resources to use, and from whom to 
buy. For example, if consumers decide to buy fresh fruit rather than chocolate, the 
price of fresh fruit will rise and the price of chocolate will fall. More fresh fruit and less 
chocolate will be produced on the basis of these price signals. On a day-to-day basis, 
the price system works silently in the background, matching the desires of consumers 
with the output from producers.
Flexible and Sticky Prices
But the price system does not always work instantaneously. If prices are slow to adjust, 
then they do not give the proper signals to producers and consumers quickly enough 
to bring them together. Demands and supplies will not be brought immediately into 
equilibrium, and coordination can break down. In modern economies, some prices 
are very flexible, whereas others are not. In the 1970s, U.S. economist Arthur Okun 
distinguished between auction prices, prices that adjust on a nearly daily basis, and custom 
prices, prices that adjust slowly. Prices for fresh fish, vegetables, and other food products 
are examples of auction prices—they typically are very flexible and adjust rapidly. Prices 
for industrial commodities, such as steel rods or machine tools, are custom prices and 
tend to adjust slowly to changes in demand. As shorthand, economists often refer to 
slowly adjusting prices as “sticky prices” (just like a door that won’t open immediately 
but sometimes gets stuck).
Learning Objective 9.1
Explain the role sticky wages and prices 
play in economic fluctuations.

Chapter 9 • Aggregate Demand and Aggregate Supply
213
Steel rods and machine tools are input prices. Like other input prices, the price 
of labor also adjusts very slowly. Workers often have long-term contracts that do not 
allow employers to change wages at all during a given year. Union workers, university 
professors, high-school teachers, and employees of state and local governments are all 
groups whose wages adjust very slowly. As a general rule, there are very few workers 
in the economy whose wages change quickly. Perhaps movie stars, athletes, and rock 
stars are the exceptions because their wages rise and fall with their popularity. But they 
are far from the typical worker in the economy. Even unskilled, low-wage workers are 
often protected from a decrease in their wages by minimum-wage laws.
For most firms, the biggest cost of doing business is wages. If wages are sticky, 
firms’ overall costs will be sticky as well. This means that firms’ product prices will 
remain sticky, too. Sticky wages cause sticky prices and hamper the economy’s ability 
to bring demand and supply into balance in the short run.
How Demand Determines Output in the Short Run
Typically, firms that supply intermediate goods such as steel rods or other inputs let 
demand—not price—determine the level of output in the short run. To understand 
this idea, consider an automobile firm that buys material from a steelmaker on a regu-
lar basis. Because the auto firm and the steel producer have been in business with one 
another for a long time and have an ongoing relationship, they have negotiated a con-
tract that keeps steel prices fixed in the short run.
But suppose the automobile company’s cars suddenly become very popular. The 
firm needs to expand production, so it needs more steel. Under the agreement made 
earlier by the two firms, the steel company would meet this higher demand and sell 
more steel—without raising its price—to the automobile company. As a result, the pro-
duction of steel is totally determined in the short run by the demand from automobile 
producers, not by price.
But what if the firm discovered that it had produced an unpopular car and needed 
to cut back on its planned production? The firm would require less steel. Under the 
agreement, the steelmaker would supply less steel but not reduce its price. Again, 
demand—not price—determines steel production in the short run.
Similar agreements between firms, both formal and informal, exist throughout the 
economy. Typically, in the short run, firms will meet changes in the demand for their 
products by adjusting production with only small changes in the prices they charge 
their customers.
What we have just illustrated for an input such as steel applies to workers, too, 
who are also “inputs” to production. Suppose the automobile firm hires union workers 
under a contract that fixes their wages for a specific period. If the economy suddenly 
thrives at some point during that period, the automobile company will employ all the 
workers and perhaps require some to work overtime. If the economy stagnates at some 
point during that period, the firm will lay off some workers, using only part of the union 
labor force. In either case, wages are sticky—they will not change during the period 
of the contract.
Retail prices to consumers, like input prices to producers, are also subject to some 
“stickiness.” Economists have used information from mail-order catalogues to docu-
ment this stickiness. Retail price stickiness is further evidence that many prices in the 
economy are simply slow to adjust.
Over longer periods of time, prices do change. Suppose the automobile company’s 
car remains popular for a long time. The steel company and the automobile company 
will adjust the price of steel on their contract to reflect this increased demand. These 
price adjustments occur only over long periods. In the short run, demand, not prices, 
determines output, and prices are slow to adjust.
To summarize, the short run in macroeconomics is the period in which prices 
do not change or do not change very much. In the macroeconomic short run, both 
formal and informal contracts between firms mean that changes in demand will be 
reflected primarily in changes in output, not prices.

Understanding Aggregate Demand
In this section, we develop a graphical tool known as the aggregate demand curve. Later 
in the chapter, we develop the aggregate supply curve. Together the aggregate demand 
and aggregate supply curves form an economic model that will enable us to study how 
output and prices are determined in both the short run and the long run. This economic 
model will also provide a framework in which we can study the role the government can 
play in stabilizing the economy through its spending, tax, and money-creation policies.
What Is the Aggregate Demand Curve?
Aggregate demand is the total demand for goods and services in an entire economy. In 
other words, it is the demand for currently produced GDP by consumers, firms, the 
government, and the foreign sector. Aggregate demand is a macroeconomic concept 
because it refers to the economy as a whole, not to individual goods or markets.
The aggregate demand curve (AD) shows the relationship between the level of 
prices and the quantity of real GDP demanded. An aggregate demand curve is shown 
in Figure 9.1. It plots the total demand for GDP as a function of the price level. (Recall 
that the price level is the average level of prices in the economy, as measured by a price 
index.) At each price level, shown on the y axis, we ask what the total quantity demanded 
will be for all goods and services in the economy, shown on the x axis. In Figure 9.1, 
the aggregate demand curve is downward-sloping. As the price level falls, the total 
quantity demanded for goods and services increases. To understand what the aggre-
gate demand curve represents, we must first learn the components of aggregate 
demand, why the aggregate demand curve slopes downward, and the factors that can 
shift the curve.

Measuring Price Stickiness in Consumer Markets
Applying The Concepts #1: What does the behavior of prices in consumer markets demonstrate about how 
quickly prices adjust in the U.S. economy?
When prices did eventually change, Kashyap observed a mixture 
of both large and small changes. During periods of high inflation, 
prices tended to change more frequently, as we might expect.
Mark Bils of the University of Rochester and Peter Klenow of 
Stanford University examined the frequency of price changes for 
350 categories of goods and services covering about 70 ­percent 
of consumer spending, based on unpublished data from the 
Bureau of Labor Statistics for 1995 to 1997. Compared with 
previous studies, they found more frequent price changes, with 
half of goods’ prices lasting less than 4.3 months. Some cat-
egories of prices changed much more frequently. Price changes 
for tomatoes occurred about every 3 weeks. And some, like 
coin-operated laundries, changed prices on average only every 
61∙2 years or so.  Related to Exercises 1.5, 1.7, and 1.8.
SOURCES: Based on Anil Kashyap, “Sticky Prices: New Evidence from Retail Cat-
alogs,” Quarterly Journal of Economics 110(1) (1995), pp. 245–274, and Mark Bils 
and Peter Klenow, “Some Evidence on the Importance of Sticky Prices,” ­Journal 
of Political Economy 112(5) (2004), pp. 987–985.
Economists have taken a number of different approaches to 
analyze the behavior of retail prices. Anil Kashyap of the Uni-
versity of Chicago examined prices in consumer catalogs. In 
particular, he looked at the prices of 12 selected goods from L.L. 
Bean, Recreational Equipment, Inc. (REI), and The Orvis Com-
pany, Inc. Kashyap tracked several goods over time, including 
several varieties of shoes, blankets, chamois shirts, binoculars, 
and a fishing rod and fly. He found considerable price stickiness. 
Prices of the goods he tracked were typically fixed for a year 
or more (even though the catalogs came out every 6 months). 

Chapter 9 • Aggregate Demand and Aggregate Supply

The Components of Aggregate Demand
In our study of GDP accounting, we divided GDP into four components: consump-
tion spending (C), investment spending (I ), government purchases (G), and net exports 
(NX ). These four components are also the four parts of aggregate demand because the 
aggregate demand curve really just describes the demand for total GDP at different 
price levels. As we will see, changes in demand coming from any of these four sources—
C, I, G, or NX—will shift the aggregate demand curve.
Why the Aggregate Demand Curve Slopes Downward
To understand the slope of the aggregate demand curve, we need to consider the effects 
of a change in the overall price level in the economy. First, let’s consider the supply 
of money in the economy. We discuss the supply of money in detail in later chapters, 
but for now, just think of the supply of money as being the total amount of currency 
(cash plus coins) held by the public and the value of all deposits in savings and checking 
accounts. As the price level or average level of prices in the economy changes, so does 
the purchasing power of your money. This is an example of the real-nominal principle.
▲  Figure 9.1  Aggregate Demand
The aggregate demand curve plots the total demand for real GDP as a function of the price level. 
The aggregate demand curve slopes downward, indicating that the quantity of aggregate demand 
increases as the price level in the economy falls.

What matters to people is the real value or purchasing power 
of money or income, not the face value of money or income.
As the purchasing power of money changes, the aggregate demand curve is affected 
in three different ways:
• The wealth effect
• The interest rate effect
• The international trade effect
Let’s take a closer look at each.

part 4
216
The Wealth Effect  The increase in spending that occurs because the real value 
of money increases when the price level falls is known as the wealth effect. Lower 
prices lead to higher levels of wealth, and higher levels of wealth increase spending on 
total goods and services. Conversely, when the price level rises, the real value of money 
decreases, which reduces people’s wealth and their total demand for goods and services 
in the economy. When the price level rises, consumers can’t simply substitute one good 
for another that’s cheaper because at a higher price level everything is more expensive.
The Interest Rate Effect  With a given supply of money in the economy, a 
lower price level will lead to lower interest rates. With lower interest rates, both con-
sumers and firms will find it cheaper to borrow money to make purchases. As a con-
sequence, the demand for goods in the economy (consumer durables purchased by 
households and investment goods purchased by firms) will increase. (We explain the 
effects of interest rates in more detail in later chapters.)
The International Trade Effect  In an open economy, a lower price level 
will mean that domestic goods (goods produced in the home country) become cheaper 
relative to foreign goods, so the demand for domestic goods will increase. For example, 
if the price level in the United States falls, it will make U.S. goods cheaper relative to 
foreign goods. If U.S. goods become cheaper than foreign goods, exports from the 
United States will increase and imports will decrease. Thus, net exports—a component 
of aggregate demand—will increase.
Shifts in the Aggregate Demand Curve
A fall in price causes the aggregate demand curve to slope downward because of three 
factors: the wealth effect, the interest rate effect, and the international trade effect. 
What happens to the aggregate demand curve if a variable other than the price level 
changes? An increase in aggregate demand means that total demand for all the goods 
and services contained in real GDP has increased—even though the price level hasn’t 
changed. In other words, increases in aggregate demand shift the curve to the right. 
Conversely, factors that decrease aggregate demand shift the curve to the left—even 
though the price level hasn’t changed.
Let’s look at the key factors that cause these shifts. We discuss each factor in detail 
in later chapters.
• Changes in the supply of money
• Changes in taxes
• Changes in government spending
• All other changes in demand
Changes in the Supply of Money  An increase in the supply of money in the 
economy will increase aggregate demand and shift the aggregate demand curve to the 
right. We know that an increase in the supply of money will lead to higher demand by 
both consumers and firms. At any given price level, a higher supply of money will mean 
more consumer wealth and an increased demand for goods and services. A decrease in 
the supply of money will decrease aggregate demand and shift the aggregate demand 
curve to the left.
Changes in Taxes  A decrease in taxes will increase aggregate demand and shift 
the aggregate demand curve to the right. Lower taxes will increase the income available 
to households and increase their spending on goods and services—even though the 
price level in the economy hasn’t changed. An increase in taxes will decrease aggregate 
demand and shift the aggregate demand curve to the left. Higher taxes will decrease 
the income available to households and decrease their spending.
Changes in Government Spending  At any given price level, an increase in 
government spending will increase aggregate demand and shift the aggregate demand 
curve to the right. For example, the government could spend more on national defense 
wealth effect

because the real value of money increases 
when the price level falls.

or on interstate highways. Because the government is a source of demand for goods and 
services, higher government spending naturally leads to an increase in total demand for 
goods and services. Similarly, decreases in government spending will decrease aggre-
gate demand and shift the curve to the left.
All Other Changes in Demand  Any change in demand from households, firms, 
or the foreign sector will also change aggregate demand. For example, if the Chinese 
economy expands very rapidly and Chinese citizens buy more U.S. goods, U.S. aggre-
gate demand will increase. Or, if U.S. households decide they want to spend more, 
consumption will increase and aggregate demand will increase. Expectations about 
the future also matter. For example, if firms become optimistic about the future and 
increase their investment spending, aggregate demand will also increase. However, 
if firms become pessimistic, they will cut their investment spending and aggregate 
demand will fall.
When we discuss factors that shift aggregate demand, we must not include any 
changes in the demand for goods and services that arise from movements in the price 
level. Changes in aggregate demand that accompany changes in the price level are 
already included in the curve and do not shift the curve. The increase in consumer 
spending that occurs when the price level falls from the wealth effect, the interest rate 
effect, and the international trade effect is already in the curve and does not shift it.
Figure 9.2 and Table 9.1 summarize our discussion. Decreases in taxes, increases 
in government spending, and increases in the supply of money all shift the aggregate 
demand curve to the right. Increases in taxes, decreases in government spending, and 
decreases in the supply of money shift it to the left. In general, any increase in demand 
(not brought about by a change in the price level) will shift the curve to the right. 
Decreases in demand shift the curve to the left.

How the Multiplier Makes the Shift Bigger
Let’s take a closer look at the shift in the aggregate demand curve and see how far 
changes really make the curve shift. Suppose the government increases its spending on 
goods and services by $10 billion. You might think the aggregate demand curve would 
shift to the right by $10 billion, reflecting the increase in demand for these goods and

services. Initially, the shift will be precisely $10 billion. In Figure 9.3, this is depicted 
by the shift (at a given price level) from a to b. But after a brief period of time, total 
aggregate demand will increase by more than $10 billion. In Figure 9.3, the total shift 
in the aggregate demand curve is shown by the larger movement from a to c. The ratio 
of the total shift in aggregate demand to the initial shift in aggregate demand is known 
as the multiplier.

Why does the aggregate demand curve shift more than the initial increase in 
desired spending? The logic goes back to the ideas of economist John Maynard Keynes. 
Here’s how it works: Keynes believed that as government spending increases and the 
aggregate demand curve shifts to the right, output will subsequently increase, too. 
As we saw with the circular flow in Chapter 5, increased output also means increased 
income for households, as firms pay households for their labor and for supplying other 
factors of production. Typically, households will wish to spend, or consume, part of 
that income, which will further increase aggregate demand. It is this additional spend-
ing by consumers, over and above what the government has already spent, that causes 
the further shift in the aggregate demand curve.
The basic idea of how the multiplier works in an economy is simple. Let’s say the 
government invests $10 million to renovate a federal court building. Initially, total 
spending in the economy increases by this $10 million paid to a private construction 
firm. The construction workers and owners are paid $10 million for their work. Sup-
pose the owners and workers spend $6 million of their income on new cars (although, 
as we will see, it does not really matter what they spend it on). To meet the increased 
demand for new cars, automobile producers will expand their production and earn 
an additional $6 million in wages and profits. They, in turn, will spend part of this 
additional income—let’s say, $3.6 million—on televisions. The workers and owners 
who produce televisions will then spend part of the $3.6 million they earn, and so on.

Chapter 9 • Aggregate Demand and Aggregate Supply
219
To take a closer look at this process, we first need to look more carefully at the 
behavior of consumers and how their behavior helps to determine the level of aggregate 
demand. Economists have found that consumer spending depends on the level of 
income in the economy. When consumers have more income, they want to purchase 
more goods and services. The relationship between the level of income and consumer 
spending is known as the consumption function:
C = Ca + by
where consumption spending, C, has two parts. The first part, Ca, is a constant and is 
independent of income. Economists call this autonomous consumption spending.
Autonomous spending is spending that does not depend on the level of income. 
For example, all consumers, regardless of their current income, will have to purchase 
some food. The second part, by, represents the part of consumption that is dependent 
on income. It is the product of a fraction, b, called the marginal propensity to 
­consume (MPC), and the level of income, or y, in the economy. The MPC (or b in 
our formula) tells us how much consumption spending will increase for every dollar 
that income increases. For example, if b is 0.6, then for every $1.00 that income 
increases, consumption increases by $0.60.
Here is another way to think of the MPC: If a household receives some additional 
income, it will increase its consumption by some additional amount. The MPC is 
defined as the ratio of additional consumption to additional income, or
MPC =
additional consumption
additional income
For example, if the household receives an additional $100 and consumes an additional 
$70, the MPC will be
$70
$100 = 0.7
You may wonder what happens to the other $30. Whatever the household does not 
spend out of income, it saves. Therefore, the marginal propensity to save (MPS) is 
defined as the ratio of additional savings to additional income
MPS =
additional savings
additional income
The sum of the MPC and the MPS always equals one. By definition, additional income 
is either spent or saved.
Now we are in a better position to understand the multiplier. Suppose the govern-
ment increases its purchases of goods and services by $10 million. This will initially 
raise aggregate demand and income by $10 million. But because income has risen by 
$10 million, consumers will now wish to increase their spending by an amount equal 
to the marginal propensity to consume multiplied by the $10 million. (Remember that 
the MPC tells us how much consumption spending will increase for every dollar that 
income increases.) If the MPC were 0.6, then consumer spending would increase by 
$6 million when the government spends $10 million. Thus, the aggregate demand 
curve would continue to shift to the right by another $6 million in addition to the 
original $10 million, for a total of $16 million.
But the process does not end there. As aggregate demand increases by $6 ­million, 
income will also increase by $6 million. Consumers will then wish to increase 
their spending by the MPC * $6 million or, in our example, by $3.6 million 
(0.6 * $6 million). The aggregate demand curve will continue to shift to the right, now 
by another $3.6 million. Adding $3.6 million to $16 million gives us a new aggregate 
demand total of $19.6 million. As you can see, this process will continue, as consumers 
now have an additional $3.6 million in income, part of which they will spend again. 
Where will it end?

spending and the level of income.

220
Instead of calculating spending round by round, we can use a simple formula to 
figure out what the multiplier is:
multiplier =
1
(1 - MPC)
Thus, in the preceding example, when the MPC is 0.6, the multiplier would be:
1
(1 - 0.6) = 2.5
Now you should clearly understand why the total shift in the aggregate demand 
curve from a to c in Figure 9.3 is greater than the initial shift in the curve from a to b. This 
is the multiplier in action. The multiplier is important because it means that relatively 
small changes in spending could lead to relatively large changes in output. For example, 
if firms cut back on their investment spending, the effects on output would be “multi-
plied,” and this decrease in spending could have a large, adverse impact on the economy.
In practice, once we take into account other realistic factors such as taxes and 
indirect effects through financial markets, the multipliers are smaller than our previ-
ous examples, typically near 1.5 for the U.S economy. This means that a $10 million 
increase in one component of spending will shift the U.S. aggregate demand curve by 
approximately $15 million. Some economists believe the multiplier is even closer to 
one. Knowing the value of the multiplier is important for two reasons. First, it tells 
us how much shocks to aggregate demand are “amplified.” Second, to design effective 
economic policies to shift the aggregate demand curve, we need to know the value of 
the multiplier to measure the proper “dose” for policy. In the next chapter, we present 
a more detailed model of aggregate demand and see how policymakers use the real-
world multipliers.
Table 9.2 shows how the multiplier works in detail. In the first round, there is an 
initial increase in government spending of $10 million. This additional demand leads to 
an initial increase in GDP and income of $10 million. Assuming that the MPC is 0.6, 
the $10 million of additional income will increase consumer spending by $6 ­million. 
The second round begins with this $6 million increase in consumer spending. Because 
of this increase in demand, GDP and income increase by $6 million. At the end of 
the second round, consumers will have an additional $6 million; with an MPC of 
0.6, consumer spending will therefore increase by 0.6 * $6 million, or $3.6 million. 
The process continues in the third round with an increase in consumer spending of 
$2.16 million. It continues, in diminishing amounts, through subsequent rounds. If we 
add up the spending in all the (infinite) rounds, we will find that the initial $10 million 
of spending leads to a $25 million increase in GDP and income. That’s 2.5 times what 
the government initially spent. So in this case, the multiplier is 2.5.

Understanding Aggregate Supply
Now we turn to the supply side of our model. The aggregate supply curve (AS) shows 
the relationship between the level of prices and the total quantity of final goods and 
output that firms are willing and able to supply. The aggregate supply curve will com-
plete our macroeconomic picture, uniting the economy’s demand for real output with 
firms’ willingness to supply output. To determine both the price level and real GDP, 
we need to combine both aggregate demand and aggregate supply. One slight complica-
tion is that because prices are “sticky” in the short run, we need to develop two different 
aggregate supply curves, one corresponding to the long run and one to the short run.
The Long-Run Aggregate Supply Curve
First we consider the aggregate supply curve for the long run, that is, when the econ-
omy is at full employment. This curve is also called the long-run aggregate supply 
curve. In previous chapters, we saw that the level of full-employment output, yp (the 
“p” stands for potential), depends solely on the supply of factors—capital, labor—and 
the state of technology. These are the fundamental factors that determine output in 
the long run, that is, when the economy operates at full employment.

Two Approaches to Determining the Causes of Recessions
Applying the Concepts #2: How can we determine what factors cause recessions?
One approach is to use economic models to address this 
question. Economists James Fackler and Douglas McMillin built 
a small model of the economy to address this issue. To distin-
guish between demand and supply shocks, they used an idea 
that we discuss in this chapter. Shocks to aggregate demand 
only affect prices in the long run but do not affect output. On the 
other hand, shocks to aggregate supply can affect potential out-
put in the long run. Using this approach, they find that a mixture 
of demand and supply shocks were responsible for fluctuations 
in output in the United States.
Using more traditional historical methods, economic historian 
Peter Temin looked back at all recessionary episodes from 1893 to 
1990 in the United States to try to determine their ultimate causes. 
According to his analysis, recessions were caused by many dif-
ferent factors. Sometimes, as in 1929, they were caused by shifts 
in aggregate demand from the private sector, as consumers cut 
back their spending. Other times, as in 1981, the government cut 
back on aggregate demand to reduce inflation. Supply shocks 
were the cause of the recessions in 1973 and 1979.
Based on both economic models and traditional economic 
history, it does appear that both supply and demand shocks 
have been important in understanding recessions.  Related to 
Exercises 3.6 and 3.9.

in a Small Macro Model,” Southern Economic Journal 64(3) (1998), pp. 648–684.
Economists have used the basic framework of aggregate 
demand and supply analysis to explain recessions. Recessions 
can occur either when there is a sharp decrease in aggregate 
demand—a leftward shift in the aggregate demand curve—or a 
decrease in aggregate supply—an upward shift in the short-run 
aggregate supply curve. But this just puts the question back 
one level: During particular historical episodes, what actually 
shifted the curves?
Figuring out what caused a recession in any particular epi-
sode is very challenging. Here is one complication. Policymakers 
typically respond to shocks that hit the economy. So, for exam-
ple, when worldwide oil prices rose in 1973 causing U.S. prices 
to increase, policymakers also reduced aggregate demand to 
prevent further price increases. Was the recession that resulted 
due to (1) the increase in oil prices that shifted the short-run 
aggregate supply curve or (2) the decrease in aggregate demand 
engineered by policymakers? It is very difficult to know.

In the long run, the economy operates at full employment and changes in the price 
level do not affect employment. To illustrate why this is so, imagine that the price level 
in the economy increases by 50 percent. That means firms’ prices, on average, will also 
increase by 50 percent. However, so will their input costs. Their profits will be the same 
and, consequently, so will their output. Because the level of full-employment output 
does not depend on the price level, we can plot the long-run aggregate supply curve as 
a vertical line (unaffected by the price level), as shown in Figure 9.4.
▲  Figure 9.4  Long-Run Aggregate Supply
In the long run, the level of output, yp, is independent of the price level.

Determining Output and the Price Level  We combine the aggregate 
demand curve and the long-run aggregate supply curve in Figure 9.5. Together, the 
curves show us the price level and output in the long run when the economy returns to 
full employment. Combining the two curves will enable us to understand how changes 
in aggregate demand affect prices in the long run.
The intersection of an aggregate demand curve and an aggregate supply curve 
determines the price level and equilibrium level of output. At that intersection point, 
the total amount of output demanded will just equal the total amount supplied by 
producers—the economy will be in macroeconomic equilibrium. The exact position of 
the aggregate demand curve will depend on the level of taxes, government spending, 
and the supply of money, although it will always slope downward. The level of full-
employment output determines the long-run aggregate supply curve.
An increase in aggregate demand (perhaps brought about by a tax cut or an increase 
in the supply of money) will shift the aggregate demand curve to the right, as shown in 
Figure 9.5. In the long run, the increase in aggregate demand will raise prices but leave 
the level of output unchanged. In general, shifts in the aggregate demand curve in the 
long run do not change the level of output in the economy, but only change the level 
of prices. Here is an important example to illustrate this idea: If the money supply is 
increased by 5 percent a year, the aggregate demand curve will also shift by 5 percent a 
year. In the long run, this means that prices will increase by 5 percent a year—that is, 
there will be 5 percent inflation. An important lesson: In the long run, increases in the 
supply of money do not increase real GDP—they only lead to inflation.
This is the key point about the long run: In the long run, output is determined 
solely by the supply of human and physical capital and the supply of labor, not the 
price level. As our model of the aggregate demand curve with the long-run aggre-
gate supply curve indicates, changes in demand will affect only prices, not the level 
of output.

Chapter 9 • Aggregate Demand and Aggregate Supply
223
The Short-Run Aggregate Supply Curve
In the short run, prices are sticky (slow to adjust) and output is determined primarily 
by demand. This is what Keynes thought happened during the Great Depression. We 
can use the aggregate demand curve combined with a short-run aggregate supply 
curve to illustrate this idea. Figure 9.6 shows a relatively flat short-run aggregate sup-
ply curve (AS). The short-run aggregate supply curve shows the short-run relationship 
between the price level and the willingness of firms to supply output to the economy. 
Let’s look first at its slope and then the factors that shift the curve.

that represents the idea that prices do 
not change very much in the short run 
and that firms adjust production to meet

The short-run aggregate supply curve has a relatively flat slope because we assume 
that in the short run firms supply all the output demanded, with small changes in prices. 
We’ve said that with formal and informal contracts firms will supply all the output 
demanded with only relatively small changes in prices. The short-run aggregate supply 
curve has a small upward slope. As firms supply more output, they may have to increase 
prices somewhat if, for example, they have to pay higher wages to obtain more overtime 
from workers or pay a premium to obtain some raw materials. Our description of the 
short-run aggregate supply curve is consistent with evidence about the behavior of 
prices in the economy. Most studies find that changes in demand have relatively little 
effect on prices within a few quarters. Thus, we can think of the aggregate supply curve 
as relatively flat over a limited time.
The position of the short-run supply curve will be determined by the costs of pro-
duction that firms face. Higher costs will shift up the short-run aggregate supply curve, 
while lower costs will shift it down. Higher costs will shift up the curve because, faced 
with higher costs, firms will need to raise their prices to continue to make a profit. What 
factors determine the costs firms must incur to produce output? The key factors are:
• Input prices (wages and materials)
• The state of technology
• Taxes, subsidies, or economic regulations
Increases in input prices (e.g., from higher wages or oil prices) will increase firms’ 
costs. This will shift up the short-run aggregate supply curve. Improvement in tech-
nology will shift the curve down. Higher taxes or more onerous regulations raise costs 
and shift the curve up, while subsidies to production shift the curve down. As we shall 
see later in this chapter, when the economy is not at full employment, wages and other 
costs will change. These changes in costs will shift the entire short-run supply curve 
upward or downward as costs rise or fall.
The intersection of the AD and AS curves at point a0 determines the price level and 
the level of output. Because the aggregate supply curve is flat, aggregate demand pri-
marily determines the level of output. In Figure 9.6, as aggregate demand increases, the 
new equilibrium will be at a slightly higher price, and output will increase from y0 to y1.
If the aggregate demand curve moved to the left, output would decrease. If the 
leftward shift in aggregate demand were sufficiently large, it could push the economy 
into a recession. Sudden decreases in aggregate demand have been important causes of 
recessions in the United States. However, the precise factors that shift the aggregate 
demand curve in each recession will typically differ.
Note that the level of output where the aggregate demand curve intersects the 
short-run aggregate supply curve need not correspond to full-employment output. 
Firms will produce whatever is demanded. If demand is very high and the economy 
is “overheated,” output may exceed full-employment output. If demand is very low 
and the economy is in a slump, output will fall short of full-employment output. 
Because prices do not adjust fully over short periods of time, the economy need not 
always remain at full employment or potential output. With sticky prices, changes in 
demand in the short run will lead to economic fluctuations and over- and underem-
ployment. Only in the long run, when prices fully adjust, will the economy operate at 
full employment.
Supply Shocks
Up to this point, we have been exploring how changes in aggregate demand affect 
output and prices in the short run and in the long run. However, even in the short run, 
it is possible for external disturbances to hit the economy and cause the short-run 
aggregate supply curve to move. Supply shocks are external events that shift the aggre-
gate supply curve.
The most notable supply shocks for the world economy occurred in 1973 and 
again in 1979 when oil prices increased sharply. Oil is a vital input for many companies

because it is used to both manufacture and transport their products to warehouses and 
stores around the country. The higher oil prices raised firms’ costs and reduced their 
profits. To maintain their profit levels, firms raised their product prices. As we have 
seen, increases in firms’ costs will shift up the short-run aggregate supply curve—
increases in oil prices are a good example.
Figure 9.7 illustrates a supply shock that raises prices. The short-run aggregate 
supply curve shifts up with the supply shock because, as their costs rise, firms will sup-
ply their output only at a higher price. The AS curve shifts up, raising the price level

Oil Price Declines and the U.S. Economy
Applying The Concepts #3: Do declines in oil prices always help the U.S. economy?
But the decrease in oil prices in 2014 and 2015 appears to 
have had only modest effects on economic growth. First, there 
are reports that consumers may have saved the money they no 
longer needed to spend on gasoline in order to pay down their 
credit cards and reduce their overall debt. When consumers save, 
aggregate demand does not increase. Second, as the technolo-
gies of horizontal drilling and fracking have spread, the U.S. is now 
a major producer of oil and natural gas. Lower oil prices decrease 
the incentives of firms to produce energy and to invest in new cap-
ital and equipment. As a result, oil production and demand could 
slow. The combination of these factors has limited the response 
of the economy to lower world oil prices. Related to Exercise 3.7.
SOURCES: Robin Sidell and Nick Timiraos, “Savings at the Pump Are Staying in 
Wallets,” Wall Street Journal, January 30, 2015, and Reuters, “U.S. Oil and Gas 
Companies Cut Capex and Rig Plans as Crude Dips,” December 10, 2014.
Economists have generally believed that falling oil prices will 
benefit the U.S. economy and lead to higher economic growth. 
Falling oil prices will reduce the prices of gasoline and heating oil 
and put more money in the pockets of consumers. This should 
lead to increases in aggregate demand. Since fuel is an input into 
production, lower oil prices may also increase aggregate supply.

An adverse supply shock, such as an increase in the price of oil, will cause the AS curve to shift upward.

and lowering the level of output from y0 to y1. Adverse supply shocks can therefore 
cause a recession (a fall in real output) with increasing prices. This phenomenon is 
known as stagflation, and it is precisely what happened in 1973 and 1979. The U.S. 
economy suffered on two grounds: rising prices and falling output. Favorable supply 
shocks, such as falling prices, are also possible, and changes in oil prices can affect 
aggregate demand.
From the Short Run to the Long Run
Up to this point, we have examined how aggregate demand and aggregate supply deter-
mine output and prices both in the short run and in the long run. You may be wonder-
ing how long it takes before the short run becomes the long run. Here is a preview of 
how the short run and the long run are connected.
In Figure 9.8, we show the aggregate demand curve intersecting the short-run 
aggregate supply curve at a0 at an output level y0. We also depict the long-run aggre-
gate supply curve in this figure. The level of output in the economy, y0, exceeds the 
level of potential output, yp. In other words, this is a boom economy: Output exceeds 
potential.

What happens during a boom? Because the economy is producing at a level beyond 
its long-run potential, the level of unemployment will be very low. This will make it 
difficult for firms to recruit and retain workers. Firms will also find it more difficult 
to purchase needed raw materials and other inputs for production. As firms compete 
for labor and raw materials, the tendency will be for both wages and prices to increase 
over time.
Increasing wages and prices will shift the short-run aggregate supply curve upward 
as the costs of inputs rise in the economy. Figure 9.9 shows how the short-run aggre-
gate supply curve shifts upward over time. As long as the economy is producing at a 
level of output that exceeds potential output, there will be continuing competition 
for labor and raw materials that will lead to continuing increases in wages and prices. 

Chapter 9 • Aggregate Demand and Aggregate Supply
227
When the economy is producing below full employment or potential output, the 
process works in reverse. Unemployment will exceed the natural rate, and there will be 
excess unemployment. Firms will find it easy to hire and retain workers, and they will 
offer workers less wages. As firms cut wages, the average wage level in the economy 
falls. Because wages are the largest component of costs and costs are decreasing, the 
short-run aggregate supply curve shifts down, causing prices to fall as well.
The lesson here is that adjustments in wages and prices take the economy from 
the short-run equilibrium to the long-run equilibrium. In later chapters, we explain in 
detail how this adjustment occurs, and we show how changes in wages and prices can 
steer the economy back to full employment in the long run.
The aggregate demand and aggregate supply model in this chapter provides an 
overview of how demand affects output and prices in both the short run and the long 
run. We expand our discussion of aggregate demand to see in detail how such realistic 
and important factors as spending by consumers and firms, government policies on 
taxation and spending, and foreign trade affect the demand for goods and services. We 
also study the critical role that the financial system and monetary policy play in deter-
mining demand. Finally, we study in more depth how the aggregate supply curve shifts 
over time, enabling the economy to recover both from recessions and the inflationary 
pressures generated by economic booms.

We developed a model of 
aggregate demand and 
supply to help us analyze what is happening or has happened in 
the economy. Here are the main points in this chapter:
1.	 Because prices are sticky in the short run, economists think of 
GDP as being determined primarily by demand factors in the 
short run.
2.	 The aggregate demand curve depicts the relationship between 
the price level and total demand for real output in the econ-
omy. The aggregate demand curve is downward-sloping 
because of the wealth effect, the interest rate effect, and the 
international trade effect.
3.	 Decreases in taxes, increases in government spending, and 
increases in the supply of money all increase aggregate demand 
and shift the aggregate demand curve to the right. Increases in 
taxes, decreases in government spending, and decreases in the 
supply of money all decrease aggregate demand and shift the 
aggregate demand curve to the left. In general, anything (other 
than price movements) that increases the demand for total 
goods and services will increase aggregate demand.
4.	 The total shift in the aggregate demand curve is greater than the 
initial shift. The ratio of the total shift in aggregate demand to the 
initial shift in aggregate demand is known as the multiplier.
5.	 The aggregate supply curve depicts the relationship between 
the price level and the level of output that firms supply in the 
economy. Output and prices are determined at the intersection 
of the aggregate demand and aggregate supply curves.
6.	 The long-run aggregate supply curve is vertical because, in the 
long run, output is determined by the supply of factors of produc-
tion. The short-run aggregate supply curve is fairly flat because, 
in the short run, prices are largely fixed, and output is determined 
by demand. The costs of production determine the position of 
the short-run aggregate supply curve.
7.	 Supply shocks can shift the short-run aggregate supply curve.
8.	 As costs change, the short-run aggregate supply curve shifts 
in the long run, restoring the economy to the full-employment 
equilibrium.

which changed rapidly, and __________ prices, which 
are slow to change.
1.2	 Auction prices are prices that adjust __________, while 
custom prices are prices that adjust __________.
1.3	 The price system always coordinates economic activ-
ity, even when prices are slow to adjust to changes in

1.4	 Determine whether the wages of each of the follow-
ing adjust slowly or quickly to changes in demand and 
supply.
a.	 Government workers
b.	Internationally known movie stars or rock stars
c.	 University professors
d.	Housekeepers
1.5	 The Internet and Price Flexibility. The Internet 
enables consumers to search for the lowest prices of 
various goods, such as e-books, smartphones, and air-
line tickets. Prices for these goods are likely to become 
more flexible as consumers shop around quickly and 
easily on the Internet. What types of goods and services 
do you think may not become more flexible because of 
the Internet? Give an example of a good or service for 
which you have searched the Internet for price infor-
mation and one for which you have not. (Related to 
Application 1 on page 214.)
1.6	 Free Agency and Professional Football Players. In 
professional football, salaries are determined by the 
league for the first several years, but then the athletes 
have a chance to become free agents and seek employ-
ment with other teams. How does this relate to price 
flexibility and price stickiness?
1.7	 Supermarket Prices. In a supermarket, prices for 
tomatoes change quickly, but prices for mops tend to 
not change as rapidly. Can you offer an explanation 
why? (Related to Application 1 on page 214.)
1.8	 Retail Price Stickiness in Catalogs. During peri-
ods of high inflation, retail prices in catalogs changed 
more frequently. Explain why this occurred. (Related 
to Application 1 on page 214.)
Understanding Aggregate Demand
List the determinants of aggregate demand.
2.1	 Which of the following is not a component of aggregate 
demand?
a.	 Consumption
b.	Investment
c.	 Government expenditures
d.	The supply of money
e.	Net exports
2.2	 When we draw the aggregate demand curve, __________ 
should be on the x-axis and __________ should be on 
the y-axis.
2.3	 The aggregate demand curve slopes downward 
because, at a higher price level, the purchasing power 
of consumers’ wealth __________ (increases/decreases) 
and consumption __________ (increases/decreases).
2.4	 If the MPC is 0.2, the value of the multiplier will be 
__________.
2.5	 Based on our understanding of the aggregate demand 
curve, we know that a(n) __________ (increase/
decrease) in the price level causes the quantity of real 
GDP demanded to __________ (increase/decrease).
2.6	 Closing Export Markets. Suppose a foreign country, 
which had allowed the United States to export to it, 
suddenly closes its market. What happens to the aggre-
gate demand curve?
2.7	 Calculating the MPS and MPC. In 1 year, a consum-
er’s income increases by $200 and her savings increases 
by $40. What is her marginal propensity to save. What 
is her marginal propensity to consume?
2.8	 Saving Behavior and Multipliers in Two Countries. 
Consumers in Country A have an MPS of 0.5 while 
consumers in Country B have an MPS of 0.4. Which 
country has the higher value for the multiplier?
2.9	 State and Local Governments during Recessions. 
During recessions, state governments often will have to 
raise taxes and cut spending in order to keep their own 
budgets balanced. If a large number of states do this, 
what will happen to the aggregate demand curve at the 
national level?
Understanding Aggregate Supply
Distinguish between the short-run and long-run aggregate 
supply curves.
3.1	 The __________ depicts the relationship between the 
level of prices and the total quantity of goods and ser-
vices that firms supply.
3.2	 A decrease in material costs will shift the short-run 
aggregate supply __________.
3.3	 The aggregate supply curve in the short run is differ-
ent from the aggregate supply curve in the long run 
because of the existence of __________ in the short run.
3.4	 A negative supply shock, such as higher oil prices, 
will __________ output and __________ prices in the 
short run.
3.5	 Higher Gas Prices, Frugal Consumers, and Eco-
nomic Fluctuations. Suppose gasoline prices increased 
sharply and consumers became fearful of owning too 
many expensive cars. As a consequence, they cut back 
on their purchases of new cars and decided to increase 
their savings. How would this behavior shift the aggre-
gate demand curve? Using the short-run aggregate 
supply curve, what will happen to prices and output in 
the short run?

230
3.6	 What Caused This Recession? Suppose the econ-
omy goes into a recession. The political party in power 
blames it on an increase in the price of world oil and 
food. Opposing politicians blame a tax increase that 
the party in power had enacted. On the basis of aggre-
gate demand and aggregate supply analysis, what evi-
dence should you look at to try to determine what, or 
who, caused the recession? (Hint: Look at the behavior 
of both prices and output in each case.) (Related to 
­Application 2 on page 221.)
3.7	 Reducing Investment Spending. In early 2015 after the 
decline in oil prices, major U.S. oil companies announced 
that they planned to cut back their investment spending 
for at least several years. Explain their reasoning. Draw 
a picture to illustrate the effects on aggregate demand. 
(Related to Application 3 on page 225.)
3.8	 Slower Growth in China. In 2014 China decided to 
cut back on its economic growth in order to prevent 
imbalances from occurring in their economy. How did 
China’s actions affect aggregate demand in the rest of 
the world?
3.9	 Long-Run Effects of a Shock to Demand. Suppose 
consumption spending rose quickly and then fell back 
to its normal level. What do you think would be the 
long-run effect on real GDP of this temporary shock? 
(Related to Application 2 on page 221.)
From the Short Run to the Long Run
Explain how the short-run aggregate  
supply curve shifts over time.
4.1	 Suppose the supply of money increases, causing output 
to exceed full employment. Prices will __________ and 
real GDP will __________ in the short run, and prices 
will __________ and real GDP will __________ in the 
long run.
4.2	 Consider a decrease in the supply of money that 
causes output to fall short of full employment. Prices 
will __________ and real GDP will __________ in the 
short run, and prices will __________ and real GDP 
will __________ in the long run.
4.3	 In a recession, real GDP is __________ potential GDP. 
This implies that unemployment is __________ the 
natural rate, driving wages __________. This results in 
a(n) shift of the short-run aggregate supply curve.
4.4	 When output falls below full employment output, we 
expect that the wages and prices __________ (increase/
decrease) as short run aggregate supply curve shifts 
__________ (upward/downward) over time.
4.5	 The Internet Crashes. Suppose that computer 
hackers managed to crash the Internet in the United 
States for a week and no one had computer access. 
Explain why this might be considered a negative sup-
ply shock.
4.6	 Shifts in Aggregate Demand and Cost-Push 
­Inflation. When wages rise and the short-run aggre-
gate supply curve shifts up, the result is “cost-push” 
inflation. If the economy was initially at full employ-
ment and the aggregate demand curve was shifted to 
the right, explain how “cost-push” inflation would 
result as the economy adjusts back to full employment.
4.7	 Removing the Restriction on Oil Exports. Under 
U.S. law, it is not legal for firms to export crude oil 
from domestic wells. Assuming the U.S. has now devel-
oped a large oil-producing industry, how would remov-
ing the export restriction affect aggregate demand? 
Who do you think might benefit from the export ban?

Fiscal Policy
10
C h a p t e r
Economists generally believe that 
permanent tax cuts will stimulate 
the economy and lead to higher 
output, but disagree about why 
this happens.
Some advocates for tax cuts stress how they lead 
to increases in spending and aggregate demand. 
Others suggest that the main effect comes from 
changes in incentives and aggregate supply.
Can we tell which view is correct by looking 
back at U.S. fiscal history? The tax cuts proposed 
by ­President John F. Kennedy and enacted after his 
death are typically viewed as triumphs of the aggregate demand view. Kennedy’s economic advisers believed that 
tax cuts worked through changing aggregate demand. On the other hand, President Ronald Reagan is famously 
known for his “supply-side” economics. His economic advisers placed great emphasis on how cutting tax rates 
would create a better economic climate through improved economic incentives.
But the economic policy world is not that simple. Kennedy’s tax cuts included incentives to increase aggregate 
supply, including cutting the top income tax rate and providing specific tax incentives for business investments. 
While Reagan’s tax cuts lowered tax rates for everyone, they also directly increased household incomes, which 
led to more spending. A careful look at actual policies suggests that tax cuts are always a mixture of demand and 
supply elements.
Today, proponents of permanent tax cuts typically cite both the Kennedy and Reagan administrations as evi-
dence that tax cuts work, regardless of their own view. By associating themselves with past successes, proponents 
of tax cuts hope to benefit from the favorable glow of history.

hen the U.S. economy began to slow in late 2007 and early 2008, it was 
not long before policymakers and politicians from both major parties were 
calling for government action to combat the downturn. Common prescrip-
tions included increasing government spending or reducing taxes, although specific 
recommendations differed sharply among those making them. Even after the recession 
ended and the slow recovery began, there were still some calls for additional action to 
stimulate the economy.
In this chapter, we study how governments can use fiscal policy—changes in taxes 
and spending that affect the level of GDP—to stabilize the economy. We explore the 
logic of fiscal policy and explain why changes in government spending and taxation can, 
in principle, stabilize the economy. However, stabilizing the economy is much easier 
in theory than in actual practice, as we will see.
The chapter also provides an overview of spending and taxation by the federal 
government. These are essentially the tools the government uses to implement its 
fiscal policies. We examine the federal deficit and begin to explore the controversies 
surrounding deficit spending.
One of the best ways to really understand fiscal policy is to see it in action. In 
the last part of the chapter, we trace the history of U.S. fiscal policy from the Great 
Depression in the 1930s to the present. As you will see, the public’s attitude toward 
government fiscal policy has not been constant but has instead changed over time.
The Role of Fiscal Policy
In the last chapter, we discussed how output and prices are determined where the 
aggregate demand curve intersects the short-run aggregate supply curve. In this sec-
tion, we explore how the government can shift the aggregate demand curve.
Fiscal Policy and Aggregate Demand
As we discussed in the last chapter, government spending and taxes can affect the 
level of aggregate demand. Increases in government spending or decreases in taxes 
will increase aggregate demand and shift the aggregate demand curve to the right. 
Decreases in government spending or increases in taxes will decrease aggregate demand 
and shift the aggregate demand curve to the left.
Why do changes in government spending or taxes shift the aggregate demand 
curve? Recall from our discussion in the last chapter that aggregate demand consists of 
four components: consumption spending, investment spending, government purchases, 
and net exports. These four components are the four parts of aggregate demand. Thus, 
increases in government purchases directly increase aggregate demand because they 
are a component of aggregate demand. Decreases in government purchases directly 
decrease aggregate demand.
Changes in taxes affect aggregate demand indirectly. For example, if the govern-
ment lowers taxes consumers pay, consumers will have more income at their disposal 
and will increase their consumption spending. Because consumption spending is a com-
ponent of aggregate demand, aggregate demand will increase as well. Increases in taxes 
will have the opposite effect. Consumers will have less income at their disposal and 
will decrease their consumption spending. As a result, aggregate demand will decrease. 
Changes in taxes can also affect businesses and lead to changes in investment spend-
ing. Suppose, for example, that the government cuts taxes in such a way as to provide 
incentives for new investment spending by businesses. Because investment spending is 
a component of aggregate demand, the increase in investment spending will increase 
aggregate demand.
In Panel A of Figure 10.1 we show a simple example of fiscal policy in action. The 
economy is initially operating at a level of GDP, y0, where the aggregate demand curve 
AD0 intersects the short-run aggregate supply curve AS. This level of output is below 
the level of full employment or potential output, yp. To increase the level of output,

spending that affect the level of GDP.
Learning Objective 10.1
Explain how fiscal policy works using 
aggregate demand and aggregate 
supply.

Chapter 10 • Fiscal Policy
233
the government can increase government spending—say, on military goods—which 
will shift the aggregate demand curve to the right, to AD1. Now the new aggregate 
demand curve intersects the aggregate supply curve at the full-employment level of 
output. Alternatively, instead of increasing its spending, the government could reduce 
taxes on consumers and businesses. This would also shift the aggregate demand curve 
to the right. Government policies that increase aggregate demand are called 
­expansionary policies. Increasing government spending and cutting taxes are exam-
ples of expansionary policies.
The government can also use fiscal policy to decrease GDP if the economy is 
operating at too high a level of output, which would lead to an overheating economy 
and rising prices. In Panel B of Figure 10.1, the economy is initially operating at a level 
of output, y0, that exceeds full-employment output, yp. An increase in taxes can shift 
the aggregate demand curve from AD0 to AD1. This shift will bring the economy back 
to full employment.
Alternatively, the government could cut its spending to move the aggregate 
demand curve to the left. Government policies that decrease aggregate demand are 
called contractionary policies. Decreasing government spending and increasing taxes 
are examples of contractionary policies.
Both examples illustrate how policymakers use fiscal policy to stabilize the 
economy. In these two simple examples, fiscal policy seems very straightfor-
ward. But as we will soon see, in practice it is more difficult to implement effec-
tive policy.
The Fiscal Multiplier
Let’s recall the multiplier we developed in the last chapter. The idea is that the final 
shift in the aggregate demand curve will be larger than the initial increase. For example, 
if government purchases increased by $10 billion, that would initially shift the aggre-
gate demand curve to the right by $10 billion. However, the total shift in the aggregate 
demand curve will be larger, say, $15 billion. Conversely, a decrease in purchases by 
$10 billion may cause a total shift of the aggregate demand curve to the left by $15 billion.

restoring the economy to full employment. This is an example of contractionary policy.

This multiplier effect occurs because an initial change in output will affect the 
income of households and thus change consumer spending. For example, an increase in 
government spending of $10 billion will initially raise household incomes by $10 billion 
and lead to increases in consumer spending. As we discussed in the last chapter, the 
precise amount of the increase will depend on the marginal propensity to consume and 
other factors. In turn, the increase in consumer spending will raise output and income 
further, leading to further increases in consumer spending. The multiplier takes all 
these effects into account.
As the government develops policies to stabilize the economy, it needs to take the 
multiplier into account. The total shift in aggregate demand will be larger than the initial 
shift. As we will see later in this chapter, U.S. policymakers have taken the multiplier into 
account as they have developed policies for the economy.
The Limits to Stabilization Policy
We’ve seen that the government can use fiscal policy—changes in the level of taxes 
or government spending—to alter the level of GDP. If the current level of GDP is 
below full employment or potential output, the government can use expansionary poli-
cies, such as tax cuts and increased spending, to raise the level of GDP and reduce 
unemployment.
Both expansionary and contractionary policies are examples of stabilization 
­policies, actions to move the economy closer to full employment or potential output.
It is very difficult to implement stabilization policies for two big reasons. First, 
there are lags, or delays, in stabilization policy. Lags arise because decision makers 
are often slow to recognize and respond to changes in the economy, and fiscal poli-
cies and other stabilization policies take time to operate. Second, economists simply 
do not know enough about all aspects of the economy to be completely accurate in all 
their forecasts. Although economists have made great progress in understanding the 
economy, the difficulties of forecasting the precise behavior of human beings, who can 
change their minds or sometimes act irrationally, place limits on our forecasting ability.
Lags  Poorly timed policies can magnify economic fluctuations. Suppose that 
(1) GDP is currently below full employment but will return to full employment on 
its own within 1 year, and that (2) stabilization policies take a full year to become 
effective. If policymakers tried to expand the economy today, their actions would not 
take effect until a year from now. One year from now, the economy would normally 
be back at full employment by itself. But if stabilization policies were enacted, 1 year 
from now the economy would be stimulated unnecessarily, and output would exceed 
full employment.
Figure 10.2 illustrates the problem caused by lags. Panel A shows an example of 
successful stabilization policy. The solid line represents the behavior of GDP in the 
absence of policies. Successful stabilization policies can dampen, that is, reduce in mag-
nitude, economic fluctuations, lowering output when it exceeds full employment and 
raising output when it falls below full employment. This would be easy to accomplish 
if there were no lags in policy. The dashed curve shows how successful policies can 
reduce economic fluctuations.
Panel B shows the consequences of ill-timed policies. Again, assume that policies 
take a year before they are effective. At the start of year 0, the economy is below poten-
tial. If policymakers engaged in expansionary policies at the start of year 1, the change 
would not take effect until the end of year 1. This would raise output even higher above 
full employment. Ill-timed stabilization policies can magnify economic fluctuations.
Where do the lags in policy come from? Economists recognize two broad classes 
of lags: inside lags and outside lags. Inside lags refer to the time it takes to formulate a 
policy. Outside lags refer to the time it takes for the policy to actually work. To help 
you understand inside and outside lags, imagine that you are steering a large ocean liner 
and you are looking out for possible collisions with hidden icebergs. The time it takes 
you to spot an iceberg, communicate this information to the crew, and initiate the 
stabilization policies

process of changing course is the inside lag. Because ocean liners are large and have 
lots of momentum, it will take a long time before your ocean liner begins to turn; this 
time is the outside lag.
Inside lags occur for two basic reasons. One is that it takes time to identify and 
recognize a problem. For example, the data available to policymakers may be poor and 
conflicting. Some economic indicators may look fine, but others may cause concern. 
It often takes several months to a year before it is clear that there is a serious problem 
with the economy.
A good example of an inside lag occurred at the beginning of the Great Depres-
sion. Although the stock market crashed in October 1929, we know from newspaper 
and magazine accounts that business leaders were not particularly worried about the 
economy for some time. Not until late in 1930 did the public begin to recognize the 
severity of the depression.
The other reason for inside lags is that once a problem has been diagnosed, it still 
takes time before the government can take action. This delay is most severe for fiscal 
policy because any changes in taxes or spending must be approved by both houses of 
Congress and by the president. In recent years, political opponents have been preoc-
cupied with disagreements about the size of the government and the role it should play 
in the economy, making it difficult to reach a consensus on action in a timely manner.
For example, soon after he was inaugurated in 1993, President Bill Clinton pro-
posed an expansionary stimulus package as part of his overall budget plan. The package 
contained a variety of spending programs designed to increase the level of GDP and 
avert a recession. However, the plan was attacked as wasteful and unnecessary, and it 
did not survive. As it turned out, the stimulus package was not necessary—the economy

grew rapidly in the next several years. Nonetheless, this episode illustrates how difficult 
it is to develop expansionary fiscal policies in time to have the effect we want them to.
Policies are also subject to outside lags—the time it takes for them to become effec-
tive. For example, if taxes are cut, it takes time for individuals and businesses to change 
their spending plans to take advantage of the tax cuts. Therefore, it will be a while 
before increases in spending raise GDP. Outside lags in fiscal policy are relatively short. 
Moreover, the multiplier effects tend to work through the economy rather quickly.
Economists use econometric models to replicate the behavior of the economy math-
ematically and statistically, and to assist them in developing economic forecasts. They 
can also use models to estimate the length of outside lags. One such model predicts 
that an increase in government spending will increase GDP by its maximum effect 
after just 6 months.
Forecasting Uncertainties  What makes the problem of lags even worse is 
that economists are not very accurate in forecasting what will happen in the economy. 
For example, a classic problem policymakers face when the economy appears to be 
slowing down is knowing whether the slowdown is temporary or will persist. Unfortu-
nately, stabilization policy cannot be effective without accurate forecasting. If economic 
forecasters predict an overheated economy and the government adopts a contractionary 
policy, the result could be disastrous if the economy weakened before the policy took 
effect. Today, most economic policymakers understand these limitations and are cau-
tious in using activist policies.

Increasing Life Expectancy And Aging Populations Spur Costs  
Of Entitlement Programs
Applying The Concepts #1: Why are the United States and many other countries facing dramatically 
increasing costs for their government programs?
of federal government spending, from our traditional average 
of 21 percent of GDP to 32 percent of GDP. Second, it would 
mean a very large increase in the tax burden on future workers 
and businesses.
Some economists suggest the government should save 
and invest now to increase GDP in the future, reducing the bur-
den on future generations. However, the saving and investment 
would increase GDP, and entitlement payments would grow 
right along with it. As a result, the relative burden of taking care 
of older adults would not change dramatically.
Another strategy is to try to reform the entitlement systems, 
placing more responsibility on individuals and families for their 
retirement and well-being. For example, we could increase the 
age at which retirement benefits begin to be paid, and thereby 
encourage individuals to spend more years in the labor force. 
Or we could try to reform the health-care system to encourage 
more competition to reduce health-care expenditures.
All these changes would be very difficult to make, however. 
Other countries, including Japan and many nations in Europe, 
which have even older populations and low birthrates, will face 
more severe challenges and face them earlier than the United 
States will. Perhaps we can learn from them. Nonetheless, pres-
sures on the federal budget will begin to escalate in the next 
decade, and policymakers will need to take steps soon to cope 
with the challenge.  Related to Exercise 2.8.
As life expectancies increase, the population ages, and new 
medical technologies become available to help people live 
longer, economists and budget analysts predict that spending 
on federal retirement and health programs will grow extremely 
rapidly. Today, Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid consti-
tute approximately 10 percent of GDP. Experts estimate that in 
2075—when children born today are in their retirement years—
spending on these programs will be approximately 22 percent 
of GDP. This is a larger share of GDP than all federal govern-
ment spending today! How will our society cope with increased 
demands for these services?
One possibility is to leave the existing programs in place 
and just raise taxes to pay for them. This strategy would have 
two implications. First, if we maintained the federal share of 
GDP of all other programs, it would mean a large expansion

The Federal Budget
The federal budget—the document that describes what the federal government spends 
and how it pays for that spending—provides the framework for fiscal policy. In this 
section, we take a closer look at federal spending and taxation and what happens when 
one exceeds the other. The federal budget is extremely large, and the programs that the 
federal government supports are very complex. To give you a sense of the magnitude 
of the budget, in 2011 total federal spending was approximately 24.1 percent of GDP, 
or $3.59 trillion. Federal taxes were 15.4 percent of GDP. With a U.S. population 
of about 300 million, total federal spending amounted to approximately $12,000 per 
person.
Probably the best way to begin to grasp the scope and complexities of the U.S. 
federal budget is to look at recent data to see where we spend money and how we raise 
it. As we explore the budgetary data, keep in mind that the government runs its budget 
on a fiscal-year basis, not a calendar-year basis. Fiscal year 2011, for example, began on 
October 1, 2010, and ended on September 30, 2011.
States and local governments also provide government services and collect taxes. 
Some important services (e.g., education) are primarily funded by state and local gov-
ernments, and others, such as welfare and health care for the poor, are funded jointly 
by the federal government and state governments. However, because our focus in this 
chapter is on federal fiscal policy, we concentrate our discussion on federal spending 
and taxation.
Federal Spending
Federal spending, spending by the U.S. government, consists of two broad compo-
nents: federal government purchases of goods and services and transfer payments. As 
you should recall from our discussion of GDP accounting, only federal government 
purchases of goods and services are included in GDP. Transfer payments, although 
an important part of the federal budget, are not a component of GDP because they do 
not represent any currently produced goods or services.
To study the components of federal spending, we look at the final data from fis-
cal year 2014 provided by the Congressional Budget Office, a nonpartisan agency of 
Congress that provides both budgetary forecasts and historical data on the budget. 
Table 10.1 provides key data on federal expenditures for fiscal year 2014, both in 
absolute dollar terms and as a percent of GDP.
Learning Objective 10.2
Identify the main elements of spending 
and revenue for the U.S. federal 
government.
Let’s begin with the broad categories of the budget. Total spending, or outlays, 
in fiscal year 2014 were $3,504 billion, or approximately 20.3 percent of GDP. Three 
components of the budget comprise this total: discretionary spending, entitlements and 
mandatory spending, and net interest.

Discretionary spending constitutes all the programs that Congress authorizes on 
an annual basis that are not automatically funded by prior laws. It includes defense 
spending and all nondefense domestic spending. When people commonly discuss fed-
eral spending, they often focus on this category, which includes the Defense Depart-
ment, the Environmental Protection Agency, the State Department, the Interior 
Department, and other agencies. However, discretionary spending is less than 40 per-
cent of total federal spending. Total nondefense spending is about 4.3 percent of GDP.
Congress and the president can use discretionary funds directly for activist fiscal 
policy. To stimulate the economy, they can authorize additional spending by govern-
ment agencies, or they can urge agencies to accelerate their current spending plans. 
However, it does take time for bureaucracies to act, and just because Congress autho-
rizes new spending does not mean the agencies will spend the funds immediately.
Entitlement and mandatory spending constitutes all spending that Congress has 
authorized by prior law. These expenditures must be made by the federal government 
unless Congress changes the laws. The terms entitlement and mandatory spending are not 
totally accurate, however. Individuals are “entitled” to benefits only to the extent they 
meet the requirements passed by Congress. Congress can always change the rules. 
Similarly, this category of spending is “mandatory” only to the extent Congress main-
tains the current programs in place.
Entitlements and mandatory spending are the single largest component of the 
federal budget. One of the most familiar programs is Social Security, which provides 
retirement payments to retirees as well as a host of other benefits to widows and fami-
lies of disabled workers. Medicare provides health care to all individuals once they 
reach the age of 65. Medicaid provides health care to the poor, in conjunction with 
the states. Spending on these two health programs by the federal government now 
exceeds spending on Social Security. The government provides a range of other pro-
grams as well, including additional retirement and disability programs (aside from 
Social Security) and farm price supports to provide income to farmers. Some of these 
programs are means tested. That is, the amount of benefit is partly based on the income 
of the recipient. Medicaid, for example, is a means-tested program.
Net interest is the interest the government pays on the government debt held by 
the public, for example, U.S. Treasury bonds, bills, and U.S. savings bonds. We dis-
cuss how the government borrows money later in the chapter. In fiscal year 2014, total 
net interest payments to the public were $229 billion, or approximately 1.3 percent of 
GDP. Total expenditures on net interest are directly related to the total government 
debt held by the public and the level of interest rates. Increased government debt and 
higher interest rates will lead to higher net interest payments by the government.

Chapter 10 • Fiscal Policy
239
Let’s review the categories that comprise total federal revenue. The single largest 
component of federal revenue is the familiar individual income tax. Tax returns calculat-
ing the tax individuals or couples owed during the prior year must be filed by April 15 
of every year. During the year, the federal government collects in advance some of 
the taxes due by withholding a portion of workers’ paychecks. Taxpayers not subject to 
withholding or who earn income through investments must make estimated tax pay-
ments each quarter, so the tax due the federal government is paid evenly over the year 
in which it is earned.
The second-largest component of federal revenue is social insurance taxes, which are 
taxes levied on earnings to pay for Social Security and Medicare. Today, social insur-
ance taxes are almost as large as individual income taxes, and together they comprise 
80 percent of total federal revenue. Unlike individual income taxes, social insurance 
taxes are paid only on wages and not on income from investments.
Other taxes paid directly by individuals and families include estate and gift taxes, 
excise taxes, and custom duties. Estate and gift taxes, sometimes known as the “death tax,” 
are levied on the estates and previous gifts of individuals when they pass away. In 2014 
estates were taxed only if they exceeded a threshold of $5.34 million per person—so 
small estates did not pay this tax. The estate and gift tax typically raises little revenue 
but generates a great deal of controversy. Opponents of the tax argue that it destroys 
family-held businesses, such as family farms passed down from one generation to the 
next. Proponents claim the tax is necessary to prevent what they see as unfair accumula-
tion of wealth across generations.
The corporate tax is a tax levied on the earnings of corporations. This tax raised 
about 11 percent of total federal revenues during fiscal year 2014. The tax was a more 
important source of revenue in past decades but has declined to today’s relatively low 
level. This decline has been attributed to many factors, including falling corporate 
profits as a share of GDP, the growth of opportunities for tax shelters, incentives pro-
vided by Congress to stimulate business investment and research and development, and 
complex rules for taxing multinational corporations that operate on a global basis. In 
addition, more businesses are now being conducted in organizational structures, such 
as partnerships, that are not subject to the corporate tax. Income from those businesses 
is reported on individual tax returns.
The other sources of government revenue are relatively minor. Federal excise taxes 
are taxes levied on the sale of certain products, for example, gasoline, tires, firearms, 
alcohol, and tobacco. Custom duties are taxes levied on goods imported to the United 
States, such as foreign cars or wines.
Supply-Side Economics And The Laffer Curve  Is it possible for a govern-
ment to cut tax rates yet still raise more revenue? That’s a politician’s dream. People 
would face lower tax rates, yet there would be more money for politicians to spend. 
Economist Arthur Laffer argued in the late 1970s that there was a strong possibility we 
could do this in the U.S. economy. Laffer’s views influenced many politicians at the 
time and became the basis for supply-side economics. Supply-side economics is a 
school of thought that emphasizes the role taxes play in the supply of output in the 
economy. Supply-side economists look at the effects of taxes not just on aggregate 
demand, as we did earlier in this chapter, but also on aggregate supply. A decrease in 
tax rates will typically tend to increase labor supply and output. Thus, changes in taxes 
can also shift the aggregate supply curve. 
Laffer also developed a model known today as the Laffer curve. Suppose a govern-
ment imposed extremely high tariffs (taxes) on imported goods—tariffs so high that no 
one could afford to import any goods whatsoever. If this were the case, the government 
would not collect any revenue from the tariffs. But if the government cut the rates and 
individuals began to buy imported goods, the government would start to collect at least 
some tariff revenue. This was Laffer’s point: Lower taxes (tariffs) could actually lead to 
higher government revenues.
Virtually all economists today believe Laffer’s tax revenue idea won’t work when 
it comes to broad-based income taxes or payroll taxes. For these types of taxes,

cutting rates from their current levels would simply reduce the revenues the govern-
ment collects because most economists believe the supply of labor is not as sensitive 
to changes in tax rates as Laffer believed it was. But there are some taxes, such as 
tariffs or taxes on the gains investors earn by holding stocks and bonds, for which 
Laffer’s claim is plausible.
The Federal Deficit and Fiscal Policy
The federal government runs a budget deficit when it spends more than it receives in 
tax revenues in a given year. Here is how it works. Suppose a government wishes to 
spend $100 billion but receives only $95 billion in tax revenue. To actually spend the 
$100 billion, the government must obtain funds from some source. Facing a $5 billion 
shortfall, it will borrow that money from the public by selling the public government 
bonds. A government bond is an IOU in which the government promises to later pay 
back the money lent to it, with interest. Thus, when the public purchases $5 billion of 
these bonds, it transfers $5 billion to the government. Later the public will receive its 
$5 billion back with interest.
If the government collects more in taxes than it wishes to spend in a given year, it 
is running a budget surplus. In this case, the government has excess funds and can buy 
back bonds it previously sold to the public, eliminating some of its debt.
Many political and economic considerations enter into the decisions to change 
government spending or taxes or raise or lower deficits. In the last part of this 
chapter we see how fiscal policy has been used historically in the United States. In 
later chapters, we look in more depth at other political considerations that influence 
fiscal policy.
Automatic Stabilizers
Both government spending and tax revenues are very sensitive to the state of the econ-
omy. Because tax collections are based largely on individual and corporate income, tax 
revenues will fall sharply during a recession as national income falls. At the same time, 
government transfer payments for programs such as unemployment insurance and food 
stamps will also tend to increase during a recession. The result is higher government 
spending and lower tax collections and the increased likelihood that the government 
will run a budget deficit. Similarly, when the economy grows rapidly, tax collections 
increase and government expenditures on transfer payments decrease, and the likeli-
hood of the federal government running a surplus is greater.
Now suppose an economy had a balanced federal budget—neither deficit nor sur-
plus. An external shock (such as a dramatic increase in oil prices or drought) then 
plunged the economy into a recession. Tax revenues fall and expenditures on transfer 
payments increase, resulting in a budget deficit. Believe it or not, the deficit actually 
serves a valuable role in stabilizing the economy. It works through three channels:
1	 Increased transfer payments such as unemployment insurance, food stamps, and 
other welfare payments increase the income of some households, partly offsetting 
the fall in household income.
2	 Other households whose incomes are falling pay less in taxes, which partly offsets 
the decline in their household income. Because incomes do not fall as much as 
they would have in the absence of the deficit, consumption spending does not 
decline as much.
3	 Because the corporation tax depends on corporate profits and profits fall in a reces-
sion, taxes on businesses also fall. Lower corporate taxes help to prevent businesses 
from cutting spending as much as they would otherwise during a recession.
The government deficit itself, in effect, offsets part of the adverse effect of the recession 
and thus helps stabilize the economy.

Similarly, during an economic boom, transfer payments fall and tax revenues 
increase. This dampens the increase in household income and also the increase in 
consumption and investment spending that would accompany higher household 
income and higher corporate profits. Taxes and transfer payments that stabilize 
GDP  without requiring explicit actions by policymakers are called automatic 
stabilizers.
The great virtue of automatic stabilizers is that they do not require explicit action 
from the president and Congress to change the law. Given the long inside lags caused 
by ideological battles in Washington, D.C., over spending, taxes, and the deficit, it is 
fortunate that we have mechanisms in place to dampen economic fluctuations without 
requiring explicit and deliberative action.
Are Deficits Bad?
Let’s take a closer look at fiscal policy designed to stabilize the economy. If the budget 
were initially balanced and the economy plunged into a recession, a budget deficit 
would emerge as tax revenues fell and expenditures increased. To combat the reces-
sion, policymakers could then either increase government spending or cut taxes. Both 
actions, however, would increase the deficit—an important point to remember.
Despite concerns about increasing the deficit, this is precisely the right policy. If 
policymakers tried to avoid running a deficit by raising taxes or cutting spending, that 
would actually make the recession worse. The key lesson here is that during a reces-
sion, we should focus on what our fiscal policy actions do to the economy, not what 
they do to the deficit.
Does that mean concerns about the federal budget deficit are misplaced? No, 
because in the long run, large budget deficits can have an adverse effect on the economy. 
We explore these issues in more detail in a later chapter, but we can easily understand 
the basic problem. We have seen that when an economy is operating at full employ-
ment, output must be divided between consumption, investment, government spend-
ing, and net exports. Suppose, then, the government cuts taxes for households and runs 
a deficit. The reduced taxes will tend to increase consumer spending. Consumers may 
save some of the tax cut but will consume the rest. However, because output is fixed at 
full employment, some other component of output must be reduced, or crowded out. 
Crowding out is an example of the principle of opportunity cost.
automatic stabilizers

GDP without requiring policymakers to 
take explicit action.
P r i n c i p l e  O f  O p p o r t u n i t y  C o s t
The opportunity cost of something is what you sacrifice to get it.
In this case, we normally expect that the increased consumption spending will 
come at the sacrifice of reduced investment spending. As we have seen, with reduced 
investment spending the economy will grow more slowly in the future. Thus, the bud-
get deficit will increase current consumption but slow the growth of the economy in 
the future. This is the real concern with prolonged budget deficits.
Another way to understand the concern about long-run deficits is to think of what 
happens in the financial markets when the government runs large deficits. As the gov-
ernment runs large deficits, it will have to borrow increasing amounts of money from 
the public by selling U.S. government bonds. In the financial markets, the government 
will be in increased competition with businesses that are trying to raise funds from the 
public to finance their investment plans, too. This increased competition from the 
government will make it more difficult and costly for businesses to raise funds and, as 
a result, investment spending will decrease.

Fiscal Policy in U.S. History
The fiscal policies that Congress and the president use have evolved over many years. 
In this section, we review the historical events that helped create today’s U.S. fiscal 
policies.
The Depression Era
The basic principles of fiscal policy—using government spending and taxation to sta-
bilize the economy—have been known for many years and, indeed, were discussed in 
the 1920s. However, it took a long time before economic policy decisions were based 
on these principles. Many people associate active fiscal policy in the United States with 
actions taken by President Franklin Roosevelt during the Great Depression of the 
1930s. But this view is misleading, according to E. Cary Brown, a former economics 
professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.1
During the 1930s, politicians did not believe in modern fiscal policy, largely because 
they feared the consequences of government budget deficits. According to Brown, fiscal 
policy was expansionary only during 2 years of the Great Depression, 1931 and 1936. 
In those years, Congress voted for substantial payments to veterans, over objections of 
presidents Herbert Hoover and Franklin Roosevelt. Although government spending 
increased during the 1930s, taxes increased sufficiently during that same period, with 
the result that there was no net fiscal expansion.
The Kennedy Administration
Although modern fiscal policy was not deliberately used during the 1930s, the growth 
in military spending at the onset of World War II in 1941 increased total demand in 
the economy and helped pull the economy out of its long decade of poor performance. 
But to see fiscal policy in action, we need to turn to the 1960s. It was not until the

The Confucius Curve?
Applying The Concepts #2: How are tax rates and tax revenues related?
Juo said, “Why can’t you use a 10 percent tax?”
The Duke answered, “I can’t even get by on a 20 percent 
tax; how am I going to do it on 10 percent?”
Juo said, “If the people have enough what prince can be in 
want? If the people are in want how can the Prince be satisfied?”
Clearly, Yu Juo was skeptical that raising rates would raise 
revenues and advocated for lower tax rates.
Today, revenue estimators in Washington, D.C., do not share 
entirely in Yu Juo’s wisdom. But they do recognize that cutting 
tax rates will stimulate economic activity, which will offset some 
of the loss in potential revenues to the ­government.  Related to 
Exercise 2.9.

While the idea that cutting tax rates might actually increase tax 
revenue is often attributed to economist Arthur Laffer, in fact, 
it is actually a much older idea than that. Yu Juo, one of the 12 
wise men who succeeded Confucius in ancient China, had a 
very similar idea.
He was asked by Duke Ai, “It has been a year of famine and 
there are not enough revenues to run the state. What should I do?”

presidency of John F. Kennedy during the early 1960s that modern fiscal policy came 
to be accepted.
Walter Heller, the chairman of the president’s Council of Economic Advisers 
under John F. Kennedy, was a forceful advocate of active fiscal policy. From his 
perspective, the economy was operating far below its potential, and a tax cut was 
the perfect medicine to bring it back to full employment. When Kennedy entered 
office, the unemployment rate was 6.7 percent. Heller believed the unemployment 
rate at full employment—the “natural rate” of unemployment, that is—was really 
only about 4 percent. He convinced Kennedy of the need for a tax cut to stimulate 
the economy, and Kennedy put forth an economic program based largely on modern 
fiscal policy principles.
Two other factors led the Kennedy administration to support the tax cut. First, 
tax rates were extremely high at the time. The top individual tax rate was 91 percent, 
compared to about 40 percent today. The corporate tax rate was 52 percent, compared 
to 35 percent today. Second, Heller convinced Kennedy that even if a tax cut led to a 
federal budget deficit, it was not a problem. In 1961, the federal deficit was less than 
1 percent of GDP, and future projections indicated it would disappear as the economy 
grew because of higher tax revenues.
The tax cuts were enacted in February 1964, after Lyndon Johnson became presi-
dent following Kennedy’s assassination. They included permanent cuts in rates for 
both individuals and corporations. Estimating the actual effects these tax cuts had on 
the economy is difficult. To make a valid comparison, we need to estimate how the 
economy would have behaved without them. What we do know is that the economy 
grew at a rapid rate following the tax cuts. From 1963 to 1966, both real GDP and con-
sumption grew at rates exceeding 4 percent per year. We cannot rule out the possibility 
that the economy could have grown just as rapidly without the tax cuts. Nonetheless, 
the rapid growth during this period suggests the tax cuts had the effect, predicted by 
Heller’s theory, of stimulating economic growth.
The Vietnam War Era
The next major use of modern fiscal policy occurred in 1968. As the Vietnam War 
began and military spending increased, unemployment fell to very low levels. From 
1966 to 1969, the overall unemployment rate fell below 4 percent. Policymakers 
became concerned that the economy was overheating and this would lead to a higher 
inflation rate. In 1968, a temporary tax surcharge of 10 percent was enacted to reduce 
total demand for goods and services. The 10 percent surcharge was a “tax on a tax,” 
so it raised the taxes paid by households by 10 percent. Essentially, the surcharge was 
specifically designed to be temporary and expired within a year.
The surcharge did not decrease consumer spending as much as economists had 
initially estimated, however. Part of the reason was that it was temporary. Economists 
who have studied consumption behavior have noticed that consumers often base their 
spending on an estimate of their long-run average income, or permanent income, not 
on their current income.
For example, consider a salesperson who usually earns $50,000 a year, although her 
income in any single year might be slightly higher or lower. Knowing her permanent 
income is $50,000, she consumes $45,000. If her income in 1 year is higher than aver-
age, say $55,000, she is still likely to consume $45,000 (as if she earned just her normal 
$50,000) and save the rest.
The 1-year tax surcharge during the Vietnam War had a similar effect. Because 
consumers knew the surcharge was not permanent, they didn’t alter their spending 
habits very much. The surtax reduced households’ savings, not their consumption. 
The result was a smaller decrease in demand for goods and services than economists 
anticipated.

average level of income.

During the 1970s, there were many changes in taxes and spending but no major 
changes in overall fiscal policy. A recession in 1973 led to a tax rebate and other incentives in 
1975, but, by and large, changes to fiscal policy were mild.
The Reagan Administration
The tax cuts enacted during 1981 at the beginning of the first term of President Ron-
ald Reagan were significant. However, they were not proposed to increase aggregate 
demand. Instead, the tax cuts were justified on the basis of improving economic incen-
tives and increasing the supply of output. In other words, they were supply-side moti-
vated. Taxes can have important effects on the supply of labor, saving, and economic 
growth. Proponents of the 1981 tax cuts emphasized the effects of supply and not 
increases in aggregate demand. Nonetheless, the tax cuts did appear to increase con-
sumer demand and helped the economy recover from the back-to-back recessions in 
the early 1980s.
By the mid-1980s, large government budget deficits began to emerge, and poli-
cymakers became concerned. As the deficits grew and became the focus of attention, 
interest in using fiscal policy to manage the economy waned because policymakers 
placed primary concern on deficit reduction, not stabilization policy. Although there 
were government spending and tax changes in the 1980s and 1990s, few were justified 
solely as policies to change aggregate demand.
The Clinton and George W. Bush Administrations
At the beginning of his administration, President Bill Clinton proposed a “stimulus 
package” that would increase aggregate demand, but it was defeated in Congress. Clin-
ton later successfully passed a major tax increase that brought the budget into balance. 
A Republican-controlled Congress that had different priorities than the Clinton admin-
istration limited government spending. By 1998, the federal budget actually began to 
show surpluses rather than deficits, setting the stage for tax cuts.
During his first year in office in 2001, President George W. Bush passed a 10-year 
tax cut plan that decreased tax rates, in part to eliminate the government surpluses and 
return revenues to households, but also to stimulate the economy that was slowing 
down as the high-tech investment boom was ending.
The first year of the tax cut featured tax rebates or refunds of up to $600 per mar-
ried couple. The refunds were intended to increase aggregate demand.
After the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, President Bush and Congress 
became less concerned with balancing the federal budget and authorized new spending 
programs to provide relief to victims and to stimulate the economy, which had entered 
into a recession prior to September 11.
In May 2003, President Bush signed another tax bill to stimulate the sluggish 
economy and, in particular, to increase investment spending. This bill had many dis-
tinct features, including moving up some of the previously scheduled cuts in tax rates 
that were part of the 2001 tax bill, increasing the child tax credit, and lowering taxes 
on dividends and capital gains.
In 2008, a slowing economy led President Bush and Congress to adopt tax 
rebates and some investment incentives in early 2008. The tax cuts were rela-
tively large, approximately 1 percent of GDP, and the rebates, some as large as 
$1,800, were designed to reach 128 million households. In February 2009, Presi-
dent Obama and Congress enacted the largest stimulus package in United States 
history. The stimulus package proved to be controversial both in its size and com-
position. While many economists believe it helped the economy recover, others 
have been more skeptical.

Chapter 10 • Fiscal Policy
245
The combination of the 2001 and 2007 recessions, the financial crisis of 2008 and 
its aftermath, the various tax cuts, the large stimulus package of 2009, and the increased 
expenses associated with the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq sharply changed the fiscal 
landscape from the beginning of the decade. Although the deficit temporarily became 
smaller in 2006 and 2007, the situation changed radically. By fiscal year 2011 the deficit 
was 8.7 percent of GDP, far above usual historical levels. Future projections indicated 
that the deficit would likely fall, but still remain high for future years.
Figure 10.3 plots the course of spending, taxes, and the deficit since 1996 and 
shows the recent reemergence of deficits from the surpluses of the late 1990s and the 
subsequent deficits. The prospect of continuing deficits can limit the ability of the 
U.S. government to conduct expansionary fiscal policy in the near future and will 
set the background for the political debates in Washington, D.C., for many years 
to come.

How Effective Was The 2009 Stimulus?
Applying The Concepts #3: Was the fiscal stimulus in 2009 successful?
Taylor first examined whether the temporary tax cuts 
stimulated consumption spending. Consistent with much prior 
research on this topic, he found little evidence that the tem-
porary tax cuts stimulated consumption; they were essentially 
saved. With respect to government purchases, this turned out 
to be a relatively small part of the stimulus package. Regardless 
of one’s view about the government spending multiplier, there 
was simply not enough to matter.
Analyzing the effects of grants to state and local govern-
ments was more complex. Taylor found that state and local 
governments increased their spending on transfer programs 
(welfare and Medicaid) but cut back on their spending on goods 
and services. Taylor argues that, on balance, state and local 
governments simply saved the money they received from the 
federal government and used it to reduce their borrowing.
Other economists disagree and have suggested that with-
out the aid to state and local governments, there would have 
been substantially more cuts in spending and the provision of 
state and local services. Predicting what state and local gov-
ernments would have done if there had not been a stimulus 
package is challenging. But to assess the effectiveness of the 
policy, we do need to make some assumptions.  Related to 
Exercise 3.7.

In 2009, President Obama signed into law the American Recov-
ery and Reinvestment Act, the largest fiscal stimulus in United 
States history. Although the recovery of the economy from the 
2007 recession was still sluggish, many economists—­including 
those at the Congressional Budget Office—believe that the stim-
ulus did have a significant impact on the economy.
Many economists have studied this issue and have reached 
different conclusions. James Feyrer and Bruce Sacerdote looked 
at differences in spending across states and found that addi-
tional spending on infrastructure and support for low-income 
households was successful in generating economic activity, but 
spending on education was not. Excluding educational spend-
ing, they estimated a fiscal multiplier of 2.0, but including edu-
cational spending the multiplier was less than one.
Not all economists share this belief. John B. Taylor, at Stan-
ford University, looked carefully at the three key elements of 
the stimulus package: temporary tax cuts, increases in federal 
government purchases of goods and services, and aid to state 
and local governments. Based on his analysis, Taylor believed 
the stimulus was ineffective.

This chapter explored the 
role of government fiscal 
policy. Using the AD–AS 
model, we showed how 
fiscal policy can stabilize 
the economy. We also 
discussed the multiplier 
and the limits to stabi-
lization policy. In addi-
tion, the chapter gave us an overview of the federal budget, including 
spending, revenues, deficits, and surpluses. Finally, we explored how 
fiscal policy in the United States has changed over time. Here are the 
key points:
1.	 Increases in government spending or decreases in taxes will 
increase aggregate demand.
2.	 Decreases in government spending or increases in taxes will 
decrease aggregate demand.
3.	 Because of the multiplier, the total shift in the aggregate demand 
curve will be larger than the initial shift. Policymakers need to take 
the multiplier into account as they formulate policy.
4.	 Both inside lags (the time it takes to formulate policy) and outside 
lags (the time it takes the policy to work) limit the effectiveness 
of active fiscal policy.
5.	 The largest component of federal spending is entitlements and 
mandatory programs.
6.	 The largest components of federal revenues are income taxes 
and social insurance taxes collected from individuals.
7.	 Government deficits act as an automatic stabilizer that helps to 
stabilize the economy in the short run.
8.	 In the short run, fiscal policy actions taken to combat a reces-
sion will increase the deficit; in the long run, deficits are a con-
cern because they may lead to the crowding out of investment 
spending.
9.	 Active fiscal policy has been periodically used in the United 
States to stimulate the economy; at other times, concerns about 
deficits have limited the use of fiscal policy.

The Role of Fiscal Policy
Explain how fiscal policy works using aggregate demand 
and aggregate supply.
1.1	 To decrease aggregate demand, a government can 
either decrease spending or _________ taxes.
1.2	 Fiscal policy refers to the _________ and _________ 
policies used by the government to influence the 
economy.
1.3	 If the multiplier for taxation is –1.50, then a $150 bil-
lion increase in taxes will ultimately shift the demand 
curve by _________.
1.4	 _________ lags refer to the time it takes for policy 
actions to have their effect on the economy.
1.5	 A Chinese Experiment. In 2000 the Chinese govern-
ment mandated three 1-week holidays throughout the 
year to stimulate consumer spending. The idea was that 
these extended vacations would induce the Chinese to 
spend more of their earnings while on vacation.
a.	 Using the AD–AS framework, show the mechanism 
through which the Chinese government believed that 
the mandated holidays would stimulate the economy.
b.	Although consumption spending rose during the 
vacation period, the data show that consumption fell 
before and after the vacation. Did the policy work?
1.6	 Time-Dated Debit Cards as a Fiscal Stimulus. Here 
is one unusual fiscal policy: The government would 
issue time-dated debit cards to each person that had to 
be spent on goods and services produced only by U.S. 
firms within a fixed period (say, 3 months) or become 
worthless. Suppose the government was considering 
whether to issue $400 in time-dated debit cards to each 
household or give each household $400 in cash instead.
a.	 Which plan would lead to the greatest economic 
stimulus?
b.	Which plan do you think the government would 
find easier to administer?
c.	 Suppose a household had large credit card debt, 
which it wished to reduce. Which of the two plans 
would that household prefer?
1.7	 Political Systems and the Inside Lag for Fiscal 
­Policy. Under a parliamentary system like in Britain, 
there are fewer checks and balances on the government 
than in the United States. In a parliamentary system, the 
party that controls the legislature also runs the executive 
branch. How do you think the inside lag for fiscal policy 
in England compares to that in the United States?
1.8	 Fiscal Multiplier and Thrifty Consumers. Suppose 
that the government gave each U.S. legal resident $10 
but everyone decided to save the money and not spend 
it. What would the fiscal multiplier be in this case?
1.9	 Shorter Business Cycles and Lags. Suppose the 
typical business cycle as shown in Figure 10.2 becomes 
shorter. Does this make the conduct of active fiscal 
policy easier or harder? Explain.
The Federal Budget
Identify the main elements of spending and revenue for the 
U.S. federal government.
2.1	 Fiscal year 2015 began on October 1, _________.
2.2	 Corporate taxes are the largest component of federal 
revenue. _________ (True/False)
2.3	 Federal spending consists of _________ and _________.
2.4	 The largest category of federal spending is _________.
2.5	 The States and Balanced Budgets. Unlike the U.S. 
federal government, virtually all states have require-
ments that they must either plan for or maintain a bal-
anced budget.
a.	 Suppose the national economy experiences a reces-
sion. How will this affect the budgets of the states?
All problems are assignable in MyLab Economics.

248
b.	What actions must the states then take to balance 
the budget?
c.	 Graphically show how these actions, taken together, 
may destabilize the national economy.
2.6	 _________ consists of interest payments on govern-
ment debt held by the public.
2.7	 Partnerships and Corporate Tax Revenues. In 
recent years, many large organizations—such as global 
accounting firms—have been structured as partner-
ships for tax purposes rather than corporations. This 
means that they do not have to pay the corporate tax. 
How would the growth of partnerships as a form of 
business organization explain some of the historical 
trends with the corporate tax?
2.8	 Just Raise Taxes? As the population ages and entitle-
ment spending on Social Security and Medicare increase, 
some have argued that we should just raise taxes to pay 
for them. What is the main argument against this solu-
tion? (Related to Application 1 on page 236.)
2.9	 High Tax Rates and Summer Employment. Sup-
pose you were considering taking a summer job to 
earn additional spending money for school. The job 
pays $12 an hour but you have to pay both income and 
social insurance taxes on your earnings. If you faced a 
50 percent rate of taxation on your earnings (so you 
could keep only $6), would you keep working? How 
about a 70 percent rate? (Related to Application 2 on 
page 242.)
Fiscal Policy in U.S. History
Discuss the key episodes of active fiscal policy in the 
United States since World War II.
3.1	 _________ was the first president to consciously use 
fiscal policy to stabilize the economy.
3.2	 Since both taxes and government spending increased 
in the United States during the 1930s, there was 
__________ (large/little/no) net fiscal expansion.
3.3	 The U.S. economy witnessed federal budget surpluses 
in _________.
3.4	 Long-run average income is known as _________ 
income.
3.5	 Tax Refunds and Consumer Spending. In 1999, 
the Internal Revenue Service began to mail out refund 
checks because of changes in the tax law in 1998. Eco-
nomic forecasters predicted that consumption and GDP 
would increase because of higher refunds on income 
taxes. Using each of the following assumptions, do you 
think the forecasters were correct? Answer yes or no.
a.	 Taxpayers were not aware they would receive 
refunds until they had completed their income tax 
statements.
b.	Taxpayers did know they would receive refunds but, 
as consumers, based their spending decisions solely 
on their current levels of income.
c.	 Taxpayers did know they would receive refunds and, 
as consumers, based their consumption decisions on 
their permanent incomes.
3.6	 The Rise and Fall of Fiscal Surpluses. What fac-
tors led the United States from federal surpluses at the 
end of the 1990s to deficits in the first decade of the 
twenty-first century? What factors led to the demise of 
surpluses?
3.7	 Personal Debt and Tax Cuts. Suppose you had a large 
unpaid balance on your credit card and were paying a 
high rate of interest. You then received a one-time tax 
rebate from the government and decided to pay down the 
balance on your credit card. If there were many others 
like you in the economy, would the tax cut be an effective 
stimulus? (Related to Application 3 on page 245.)
3.8	 College Students and Tax Rebates. If a college stu-
dent with a low credit card limit received a tax rebate, 
do you think he or she would be more likely to save it 
or spend it? How about a middle-aged married man 
who does not have a low credit card limit? Explain your 
reasoning.
3.9	 Forecasts for Debt. Go to the Web site for the Con-
gressional Budget Office (www.cbo.gov) and find their 
10-year projections for debt as a fraction of GDP. How 
does this change over time?
3.10	 Long-Run Deficit Projections. The Congres-
sional Budget Office makes long-run deficit budget 
­projections, extending far into the twenty-first cen-
tury. Go to their Web site and find the latest long-run 
projections. What are the main causes of the long-run 
deficits projected by the CBO?

The Income-Expenditure 
Model
11
C h a p t e r
In response to the worldwide recession 
in 2009, countries around the world 
engaged in Keynesian stimulus policy.
The size of the stimulus packages varied across countries. The 
International Monetary Fund estimated the size of the stimulus 
package from 2008 to 2010 as share of GDP for the world’s 
largest economies. The United States and China were the two 
largest at 4.8 and 4.4 percent of GDP, respectively. Germany 
was in the middle at 3.4 percent of GDP, while the United King-
dom and France were at the low end of the spectrum at 1.5 and 
1.3 percent of GDP, respectively.
While the stimulus numbers may be uncontroversial, the interpretation of these numbers is not. By most mea-
sures, the United States and China recovered most rapidly from the recession, whereas France and the United 
Kingdom experienced very slow recoveries. Germany’s recovery fell in between these extremes. The countries that 
had the largest stimulus recovered the fastest; those countries with smallest stimulus packages experienced the 
slowest recoveries. Economists who believed that Keynesian fiscal policy still works today pointed to these results 
as supporting their views. Economists who were more skeptical of Keynesian fiscal policy contended that more 
expansionary policy in countries like France and Germany would not have been successful because of either long-run 
budgetary or deficit concerns. And they note that since that time, China has had to slow down its growth because 
policymakers feared that their large stimulus policy had created large imbalances. One thing is certain: The Great 
Recession of 2009 provided economists a rich laboratory to test their theories.1

ewspaper and television stories about the economy tend to focus on what 
causes changes in short-term real GDP. For example, we often read about how 
changes in economic conditions in Europe or Asia or changes in government 
spending or taxation will affect near-term economic growth. To understand these sto-
ries, we need to understand the behavior of the economy in the short run.
As we have seen, in the short run changes in aggregate demand play the key role in 
determining the level of output. In the short run, prices are slow to change, and there-
fore fluctuations in aggregate demand translate directly into fluctuations in GDP and 
income. In this chapter, we take a more detailed look at short-run fluctuations in GDP.
The model we develop in this chapter is called the income-expenditure model, some-
times referred to as the Keynesian cross. The model was developed by economist John 
Maynard Keynes in the 1930s and later extended and refined by many economists. 
When Keynes developed his approach to macroeconomics, the world economy was in 
the midst of a severe depression. Unlike many other economists at the time, Keynes 
did not believe the economy would return to full employment by itself. An economy 
could get “trapped” in a depression and not recover.
Keynes provided both a diagnosis of an economic depression and a cure. He argued 
that the fundamental problem causing the world depression was insufficient demand 
for goods and services. Here was the problem: Firms would not increase their produc-
tion and put the unemployed back to work unless there was sufficient demand for the 
goods and services they produced. But consumers and firms would not demand enough 
goods and services unless the economy improved and their incomes were higher. 
Keynes argued that active fiscal policy—increasing government spending or cutting 
taxes—could increase total demand for goods and services and bring the economy back 
to full employment. This income-expenditure model is based on the idea that higher 
expenditures were necessary to generate higher levels of income in the economy.
The income-expenditure model focuses on changes in the level of output or real 
GDP. However, it does not take into account changes in prices. The model is thus 
very useful for understanding economic fluctuations in the short run when prices do 
not change very much. It is less useful in the intermediate or longer run, when prices 
do adjust to economic conditions. For intermediate or longer-run analysis, we need to 
use the aggregate demand and aggregate supply curves to understand movements in 
both output and prices.
In this chapter, we focus on the short run. In the last part of this chapter, we show 
how Keynes’s income-expenditure model also provides an important building block 
for our model of aggregate demand. In later chapters, we incorporate financial markets 
into our discussion of aggregate demand.
This chapter primarily uses graphical tools to explain the income-expenditure 
model. An appendix to the chapter provides an algebraic treatment of the model and 
shows how some of the key formulas are derived.
A Simple Income-Expenditure Model
First, we develop a very simple income-expenditure model to illustrate the ideas of 
Keynes. Later in the chapter, we expand the income-expenditure model to make it 
more realistic.
Equilibrium Output
Let’s begin with the simplest income-expenditure model. It uses a graph like 
­Figure 11.1, with total expenditures for goods and services represented on the vertical 
axis, output (y) represented on the horizontal axis, and a 45° line. The 45° line marks 
all the points on the graph at which the value of the variable measured on the hori-
zontal axis (-output) equals the value of the variable measured on the vertical axis (total 
expenditures). In our most basic model, we temporarily omit the government and the 
foreign sector. Only consumers and firms can demand output: Consumers demand

consumption goods, and firms demand investment goods. We make things even sim-
pler by assuming that consumers and firms each demand a fixed amount of goods. Let 
consumption demand be an amount C, and let investment demand be an amount I. 
Total demand will be C + I. Total demand for goods and services is also called 
planned expenditures. Thus, planned expenditures in this simple economy are equal 
to C + I.
In the income-expenditure model, we assume firms supply all the output that is 
demanded. This means the short-run aggregate supply curve is flat, so firms will pro-
duce whatever is demanded without changing their prices. This assumption is reason-
able in the short run.
Because firms are willing to supply whatever is demanded, demand is the key factor 
in determining the level of output, or GDP. In the income-expenditure model, the level 
of output will adjust to equal the level of planned expenditures. We call the level of 
output the equilibrium output.
Let’s denote the level of equilibrium output as y*. Then the level of equilibrium 
output will be
equilibrium output = y* = C + I = planned expenditures
At equilibrium output, planned expenditures for goods and services equal the level of 
output or GDP.
Figure 11.2 can help us understand how the level of equilibrium output, or GDP, 
in the economy is determined. On the expenditure-output graph, we superimpose the 
line representing planned expenditures, C + I, which is a horizontal line because both 
C and I are fixed amounts. Because planned expenditures are fixed at C + I, they do not 
depend on the level of output. Equilibrium output is at y*, the level of output at which 
the planned expenditure line crosses the 45° line. The two lines cross at point a, where 
output measured on the horizontal axis equals planned expenditures by consumers and 
firms measured on the vertical axis. Recall that on a 45° line the value on the horizontal 
axis equals the value on the vertical axis.
Adjusting to Equilibrium Output
What would happen if the economy were producing at a higher level of output, such as 
y1 in Figure 11.3? At that level of output, more goods and services are being produced 
than consumers and firms are demanding. Goods that are produced but not purchased

and services.

expenditure equals the amount that is

will pile up on the shelves of stores. Firms will react to these piles of goods by cutting 
back on production. The level of output will fall until the economy reaches y*, as indi-
cated by the leftward arrow in Figure 11.3.
If the economy were producing at a lower level of output, y2, planned expenditures 
would exceed total output. Firms would find that the demand for consumption and 
investment goods is greater than their current production. Inventories now disap-
pear from the shelves of stores, and firms face increasing backlogs of orders for their 
products. They respond by stepping up production, so GDP increases back to y*, as 
indicated by the rightward arrow in Figure 11.3.

Be sure you remember that the equilibrium level of output occurs where planned 
expenditures equal production. If the economy were not producing at that level, we 
would find either that the demand for goods was too great relative to production, or that 
there was insufficient demand relative to production. In either case, the economy would 
rapidly adjust to reach the equilibrium level of output.
The Consumption Function
To make the income-expenditure model more realistic, we need to introduce other com-
ponents of demand, including the government and the foreign sector. But first we need 
to recognize that consumers’ planned expenditures will depend on their level of income.
Consumer Spending and Income
Let’s begin by reviewing the consumption function we first introduced in Chapter 9. 
The consumption function describes the relationship between desired spending by 
consumers and the level of income. When consumers have more income, they will want 
to purchase more goods and services.
As we have seen, a simple consumption function can be described by the equation
C = Ca + by
in which total consumption spending, C, has two parts. The first part, Ca, is called 
autonomous consumption, and it does not directly depend on the level of income. 
The second part, by, represents the part of consumption that does depend on income. 
It is the product of the fraction b, called the marginal propensity to consume (MPC), 
and level of income in the economy, y. The MPC, which has a value of b in our formula, 
tells us how much consumption spending will increase for every dollar that income 
increases. If b equals 0.7, then for every $1 that income increases, consumption would 
increase by 0.7 * $1, or $0.70.
In our simple income-expenditure model, output is also equal to the income that 
flows to households. As firms produce output, they pay households income in the form 
of wages, interest, profits, and rents. We can therefore use y to represent both output 
and income.
We plot a consumption function in Figure 11.4. The consumption function is 
a line that intersects the vertical axis at Ca, the level of autonomous consumption 
spending, which is typically greater than zero (therefore, it has a positive intercept). 
The slope of the consumption function equals b, the marginal propensity to consume.

Table 11.1 also helps to illustrate the process that determines equilibrium output. 
The table shows, with a numerical example, what happens to production when planned 
expenditures do not equal output. Planned expenditures, consumption (C) plus invest-
ment (I), equal $100 billion. In the first row, we see that if current production is only 
$80 billion, stocks of inventories will be depleted by $20 billion, so firms will increase 
output to restore their inventory levels. In the third row, production is at $120 billion, 
creating an excess of inventories of $20 billion, and firms will cut back production. In 
the second row, planned expenditures equal output, so neither inventories nor produc-
tion changes.

Although output is plotted on the horizontal axis, remember that it is also equal to 
income, so income rises dollar for dollar with output. That is why we can plot the 
consumption function, which depends on income, on the same graph that deter-
mines output.
Changes in the Consumption Function
The consumption function is determined by the level of autonomous consumption and 
by the MPC. The level of autonomous consumption can change, and so can the MPC. 
Changes in either shift the consumption function to another position on the graph. 
A higher level of autonomous consumption but no change in MPC will shift the entire 
consumption function upward and parallel to its original position. More consumption 
occurs at every level of income. We show an increase in autonomous consumption in 
Panel A of Figure 11.5.

A number of factors can cause autonomous consumption to change. Here are two:
• Increases in consumer wealth will cause an increase in autonomous con-
sumption. Wealth consists of the value of stocks, bonds, and consumer durables 
(consumer goods that last a long time, such as automobiles and refrigerators). 
Note that a person’s wealth is not the same as income. Income is the amount of 
money someone earns during a period, such as in a given year, whereas wealth 
represents the person’s total net worth. Nobel Laureate Franco Modigliani found 
that increases in stock prices, which raise consumer wealth, will lead to increases 
in autonomous consumption. Conversely, a sharp fall in stock prices will lead to 
a decrease in autonomous consumption.
• Increases in consumer confidence will increase autonomous consumption. 
Forecasters pay attention to consumer confidence, a measure based on household 
surveys of how positive consumers are feeling about the future, because it helps 
them to predict consumption spending. The Conference Board, a nonprofit 
organization devoted to disseminating economic analysis, publishes an index of 
consumer confidence each month that many forecasters rely on.
A change in the marginal propensity to consume will cause a change in the slope of 
the consumption function. We show an increase in the MPC in Panel B of ­Figure 11.5, 
where we assume autonomous consumption is fixed. As the MPC increases, the con-
sumption function rotates upward, counterclockwise. This rotation means the con-
sumption function line gets steeper.

Falling Home Prices, the Wealth Effect, and Decreased Consumer Spending
APPLYING THE CONCEPTS #1: How do changes in the value of homes affect consumer spending?
their mortgages and pulling out money to buy new cars, boats, 
or other consumer durables. Instead, many recent home pur-
chasers actually owed more than their homes were worth—and, 
as a result, some defaulted on their loans and turned their prop-
erty over to lenders. How do these changes affect consumer 
spending?
In its review of the literature, the Congressional Budget 
Office found most studies estimated a decrease of consumer 
wealth of $1 would lower consumption spending by some-
where between $0.02 and $0.07. Based on forecasts for hous-
ing prices, the Congressional Budget Office estimated the 
declines in housing prices would reduce consumer wealth and 
ultimately consumer spending between $21 and $72 ­billion or 
subtract 0.1 to 0.5 percentage points from economic growth 
during 2007. This partly explains the reduced rate of economic 
growth that occurred during that year.  Related to Exercises 2.5 
and 2.7.

The value of homes in excess of what people borrow with a 
mortgage is known as their home equity. Home equity is the 
single largest component of net wealth for most families in the 
United States. Compared to wealth holdings in the stock mar-
ket, which tend to be concentrated in the highest income brack-
ets, home-equity wealth is more widely dispersed across the 
income spectrum. Changes in the value of home equity—like 
other forms of wealth—affect consumer spending.
The period from 1997 to mid-2006 was paradise for con-
sumers. Housing prices rose nationally by approximately 
90 ­percent and consumer wealth grew by $6.5 trillion over 
that period. The party ended in the summer of 2006 as hous-
ing prices began to fall. In some regions of the country, where 
housing prices had risen most sharply, they fell from their peak 
by about 30 ­percent. No longer were households refinancing

Equilibrium Output and the Consumption Function
Using the consumption function, we can now begin to look at more complex versions 
of the income-expenditure model. We continue to assume investment spending, I, 
does not depend on the level of income. The only difference between what we did 
in the preceding section and what we are about to do here is that we now recognize 
consumption increases with the level of income. Figure 11.6 shows how GDP is deter-
mined. We first plot the consumption function, C, as before: A sloping line graphi-
cally representing that consumption spending is a function of income. Because we are 
assuming investment is constant at all levels of income, to get the C + I line, we can 
simply vertically add the constant level of investment I to the consumption function. 
Adding vertically gives us the C + I line, which represents total planned expenditures 
in the economy. This line is upward-sloping because consumption spending increases 
with income. At any level of income, we now know the level of total planned expen-
ditures, C + I.

model.

The level of equilibrium output, y*, occurs where the planned expenditure line 
C + I crosses the 45° line. At this level of output, planned expenditures equal output. 
At any other level of production, planned expenditures will not equal output, and the 
economy will adjust back to y* for the same reasons and in the same way as in the cor-
responding example in the preceding section.
In the appendix to this chapter, we show that the equilibrium output in this simple 
economy is
equilibrium output =
(autonomous consumption + investment)
(1 - MPC)

Chapter 11 • The Income-Expenditure Model
257
or, in the mathematical terms representing those words,
y* = (Ca + I)
(1 - b)
From this relationship and the numerical values for Ca, b, and I, we can calculate equi-
librium output. Suppose
 Ca = 100
 b = 0.6
 I = 40
This means the consumption function is C = 100 + 0.6y. Then, using our formula 
for equilibrium output, we have
y* = 100 + 40
1 - 0.6
= 140
0.40 = 350
Saving and Investment
We can determine equilibrium output another way, which highlights the relation-
ship between saving and investment. To understand this relationship, recall that in an 
economy without taxation or government, the value of output, or production (y), equals 
the value of income. Households receive this income and either consume it (C), save 
it (S), or a combination of both. We can therefore say that saving equals output minus 
consumption or, in mathematical terms,
S = y - C
In our simple economy, output is determined by planned expenditures, C + I, or
y = C + I
If we subtract consumption from both sides of this equation, we have
y - C = I
But we just saw that the left side, y - C, equals saving, S, so we have
S = I
Thus, equilibrium output is determined at the level of income where savings equal 
investment.
However, the level of savings in the economy is not fixed. A savings function 
describes the relationship between savings and the level of income. Total savings will 
increase with the level of GDP. Recall from Chapter 9 the concept of the marginal 
propensity to save (MPS): It is the ratio of additional savings to additional income. 
Since households will increase their total savings as their income increases, total savings 
will increase with GDP.
Figure 11.7 illustrates how equilibrium income is determined where savings equals 
investment. The horizontal line is a fixed level of investment in the economy. The 
upward-sloping line is the savings function. The two lines intersect at the equilibrium 
level of output, y*.
To illustrate these ideas with a numerical example, let’s return to the previous 
case in which the consumption function is C = 100 + 0.6y. Because S = y - C, sav-
ing is
 S = y - (100 + 0.6y)
 S = -100 + 0.4y
This equation is the savings function for this example. The marginal propensity 
to save (MPS) is 0.4. That means that for every dollar y increases, saving increases by 
$0.40. Notice the slope of the savings function is the MPS.

of saving and the level of income.

In our previous example, investment was 40 and equilibrium output was 350. Let’s 
check that saving does equal that level of investment. Plugging in the value of equilib-
rium output, or income, into the savings function, we get
 S = -100 + 0.4(350)
 S = -100 + 140
 S = 40
So saving equals investment at the level of equilibrium output.

Understanding the Multiplier
In all economies, investment spending fluctuates. We can use the model we developed 
that determines output in the short run, the income-expenditure model, to see what 
happens if there are changes in investment spending. Suppose investment spending 
originally was I0 and increased to I1—an increase we call ∆I (the symbol ∆, the Greek 
capital letter delta, is universally used to represent change). What happens to equilib-
rium output?
Figure 11.8 shows how equilibrium output is determined at the original level of 
investment and at the new level of investment. The increase in investment spending 
shifts the C + I curve upward by ∆I. The intersection of the C + I curve with the 45° 
line shifts from a0 to a1. GDP increases from y0 to y1 by the amount ∆y. The figure 
shows that the increase in GDP—that is, the amount ∆y—is greater than the increase 
in investment—the amount ∆I—or ∆y 7 ∆I. This is a general result: The increase in 
output always exceeds the increase in investment because of the multiplier effect we 
discussed in the last chapter.
Let’s review the logic of the multiplier. Suppose there is an initial increase of 
investment spending by $20 million. This additional demand will initially increase 
output, income, and aggregate demand by $20 million. Assuming the MPC is 0.8, 
the $20 million in additional income will lead to $16 million in increased consumer 
spending (the MPC of 0.8 * $20 million). With an increase in consumer demand of 
$16 million, output, income, and aggregate demand will therefore increase by another 
$16 million. In turn, this will increase consumer spending by another $12.8 million 
(the MPC of 0.8 * $16 million). This increased demand will therefore increase out-
put, income, and aggregate demand by $12.8 million, generating further increases 
in consumer spending of $10.24 million. As this process continues over time, total

spending will continue to increase, but in diminishing amounts. If we add up all the 
spending in the (infinite) rounds, we find the initial increase in investment spend-
ing will generate a total increase in equilibrium income of $100 million, far more 
than the initial $20 million with which we began. In this case, the multiplier is 5 
(5 * $20 million = $100 million).
We show how to derive the formula for a simple multiplier in the appendix to this 
chapter:
multiplier =
1
(1 - MPC)
Suppose the MPC equals 0.8. Then the multiplier would be
multiplier =
1
(1 - 0.8) = 5
Notice that the multiplier increases as the MPC increases. If MPC equals 0.4, 
the multiplier is 1.67; if the MPC equals 0.6, the multiplier is 2.5. To see why the 
multiplier increases as the marginal propensity to consume increases, think back to 
our examples of the multiplier. The multiplier occurs because the initial increase in 
investment spending increases income, which leads to higher consumer spending. 
With a higher MPC, the increase in consumer spending will be greater because con-
sumers will spend a higher fraction of the additional income they receive as the mul-
tiplier increases. For example, if the MPC is 0.8, they will spend an additional $0.80, 
whereas if the multiplier was 0.6, they would spend only an additional $0.60. With a 
higher MPC, the eventual increase in output will be greater, and therefore so will the 
multiplier.
One implication of the multiplier is that the effect of any change in investment 
“multiplies” throughout the economy. This explains why economies can often recover 
quickly after natural disasters.

Government Spending and Taxation
We now make our income-expenditure model more realistic by bringing in govern-
ment spending and taxation, which makes the model useful for understanding economic 
policy debates. In those debates, we often hear recommendations for either increasing 
government spending or cutting taxes to increase GDP. As we will explain, both the 
level of government spending and the level of taxation, through their influence on the 
demand for goods and services, affect the level of GDP in the short run.
Using taxes and spending to influence the level of GDP in the short run is known 
as Keynesian fiscal policy. As we discussed in Chapter 7, changes in taxes can also affect the 
supply of output in the long run through the way taxes can change incentives to work 
or invest. However, in this chapter we concentrate on the role of taxes and spending 
in determining demand for goods and services, and therefore output, in the short run.
Fiscal Multipliers
Let’s look first at the role government spending plays in determining GDP. Govern-
ment purchases of goods and services are a component of total spending:
planned expenditures including government = C + I + G
Increases in government purchases, G, shift the C + I + G line upward, just as increases 
in investment, I, or autonomous consumption do. If government spending increases by 
$1, the C + I + G line will shift upward by $1.
Panel A of Figure 11.9 shows how increases in government spending affect GDP. 
The increase in government spending from G0 to G1 shifts the C + I + G line upward 
and increases the level of GDP from y0 to y1.

taxes affect equilibrium income.

Multipliers in Good Times and Bad
APPLYING THE CONCEPTS #2: Are multipliers for government spending higher during recessions?
slack times. Valerie Ramey and Sarah Zubiary find no evidence 
of this for the United States—the multiplier does not appear to 
increase in slack times. However, using data from a broad range 
of developed countries in the OECD, Daniel Riera-Crichton, 
­Carlos Veigh, and Guillermo Vuletin found different results. They 
made the point that sometimes governments increase spending 
in good times and decrease spending in bad times. What we 
would like to know is what happens when governments increase 
spending in bad times because that is an important time when 
governments want to use active fiscal policy. By carefully look-
ing at periods when both government spending increased and 
the economy had slower or negative growth, they found the 
multiplier to be 2.3. This is a larger number than conventionally 
calculated multipliers.  Related to Exercise 3.9 and 3.10.
SOURCES: Valerie Ramey and Sarah Zubairy, “Government Spending Multipliers 
in Good Times and in Bad: Evidence From U.S. Historical Data” (NBER Working 
Paper No. 20719, November 2014), and Daniel Riera-Cohen, Carlos Veigh, and 
Guillermo Vuletin, “Procyclical and Countercyclical Fiscal Multiplier: Evidence from 
OECD Countries” (NBER Working Paper No. 20533, September 2014).
A common belief is that fiscal multipliers are larger during 
recessions when there is more slack in the economy. But it is 
actually quite difficult to estimate government multipliers accu-
rately. Government spending often reacts to the state of the 
economy, so you may see politicians increasing government 
spending precisely when the economy is slowing down. Without 
recognizing how politicians respond to recessions, you might 
actually think that higher government spending was causing a 
recession!
Fortunately, economists have ways to handle this problem, 
but they do disagree on whether the fiscal multiplier is larger in 

Chapter 11 • The Income-Expenditure Model
261
As you can see, changes in government purchases have exactly the same effects 
as changes in investment or changes in autonomous consumption. The multiplier for 
government spending is also the same as for changes in investment or autonomous 
consumption:
multiplier for government spending =
1
(1 - MPC)
For example, if the MPC is 0.6, the multiplier is 2.5:
1
(1 - 0.6) = 2.5
Therefore, a $10 billion increase in government spending will increase GDP by 
$25 billion. The multiplier for government spending works just like the multiplier for 
investment or consumption. An initial increase in government spending raises GDP 
and income. The increase in income, however, generates further increases in demand 
as consumers increase their spending.
Now let’s consider taxes. We need to take into account that government pro-
grams affect households’ disposable personal income—income that ultimately flows 
back to households (and thus consumption) after subtraction from their income of any 
taxes paid and after addition to their income of any transfer payments they receive, 
such as Social Security, unemployment insurance, or welfare. If the government takes 
$10 net of every $100 you make, your income after taxes and transfer payments is 
only $90.
Here’s how we include taxes and transfers into the model: We make consumption 
spending depend on income after taxes and transfers, or y - T, where T is net taxes 
(taxes paid to government minus transfers received by households). For simplicity, 
we just refer to T as taxes, but remember that it is taxes less transfer payments. The 
consumption function with taxes is
C = Ca + b(y - T)
If taxes increase by $1, after-tax income will decrease by $1. Because the mar-
ginal propensity to consume is b, this means consumption will fall by b * $1, and the 
C + I + G line will shift downward by b * $1. For example, if b is 0.6, a $1 increase 
in taxes will mean that consumers will have a dollar less of income and will therefore 
decrease consumption spending by $0.60.

Panel B of Figure 11.9 shows how an increase in taxes will decrease the level of 
GDP. As the level of taxes increases, the demand line will shift downward by b (the 
increase in taxes). Equilibrium income will fall from y0 to y1. The multiplier for taxes 
is slightly different than the multiplier for government spending. If we cut government 
spending by $1, the C + I + G line will shift downward by $1. However, if we increase 
taxes by $1, consumers will cut back their consumption by only b * $1. Thus, the 
C + I + G line will shift downward by slightly less than $1, or b * $1. For example, 
if b is 0.6, the demand line would shift down vertically by $0.60.
Because the demand line does not shift by the same amount with taxes as it does 
with government spending, the formula for the tax multiplier is slightly different. 
Here’s the formula for the tax multiplier; we show how to derive it in the appendix:
tax multiplier =
-MPC
(1 - MPC)
The tax multiplier is negative because increases in taxes decrease disposable per-
sonal income and lead to a reduction in consumption spending. If the MPC is 0.6, the 
tax multiplier will be
-0.6
(1 - 0.6) = -1.5
Notice that the tax multiplier is smaller (in absolute value) than the government 
spending multiplier, which for the same MPC is 2.5. The reason the tax multiplier is 
smaller is that an increase in taxes first reduces income of households by the amount 
of the tax. However, because the MPC is less than one (0.6), the decrease in consumer 
spending is less than the increase in taxes.
Finally, you may wonder what would happen if we increased both government 
spending and taxes by an equal amount at the same time. Because the multiplier for 
government spending is larger than the multiplier for taxes, equal increases in both 
government spending and taxes will increase GDP. Economists call the multiplier for 
equal increases in government spending and taxes the balanced-budget multiplier because 
equal changes in government spending and taxes will not unbalance the budget. In the 
appendix we show that the balanced-budget multiplier in our simple model is always 
equal to one. For example, if spending and taxes are both increased by $10 billion, then 
GDP will also increase by $10 billion.
Using Fiscal Multipliers
Let’s look at several examples of how we can use fiscal policy, altering taxes, and gov-
ernment spending to affect GDP. In all these examples, suppose GDP is $6,000 billion 
and the marginal propensity to consume is 0.6. The government-spending multiplier is
1
(1 - 0.6) = 2.5
The tax multiplier is
-0.6
(1 - 0.6) = -1.5
1	 Suppose policymakers want to increase GDP by 1 percent, or $60 billion. By how 
much do policymakers have to increase government spending to meet this tar-
get? Because the multiplier for government spending is 2.5, we need to increase 
government spending by only $24 billion. With a multiplier of 2.5, the $24 bil-
lion increase in government spending leads to an increase in GDP of $60 billion 
($24 billion * 2.5 = $60 billion).
2	 Suppose policymakers wanted to use tax cuts rather than government-spending increases 
to increase GDP by $60 billion. How large a tax cut would be necessary? Because 

Chapter 11 • The Income-Expenditure Model
263
the tax multiplier is -1.5, we need to cut taxes by $40 billion. The $40 billion tax 
cut times the multiplier will lead to the objective, a $60 billion increase in GDP 
(-$40 billion * (-1.5) = $60 billion).
3	 If policymakers wanted to change taxes and government spending by equal amounts, so 
as to not affect the federal budget, how large a change would be needed to increase GDP 
by $60 billion? Because the balanced-budget multiplier is one, both government 
spending and taxes must be increased by $60 billion.
The models we are using are very simple and leave out important factors. Nonethe-
less, the same basic principles apply in real situations. Here are five examples of activist 
Keynesian fiscal policy from recent times:
1	 In 1993, the three members of the President’s Council of Economic Advisers wrote 
a letter to President Clinton stating they thought the cuts in government spending 
being proposed at the time were $20 billion too large. The economic model the 
council members used had a multiplier for government spending of approximately 
1.5. With this multiplier, the decrease in GDP from the $20 billion spending cut 
would be $30 billion ($20 billion * 1.5). This was approximately 0.5 percent of 
GDP. If GDP was expected to grow at 3 percent a year without the cuts, the presi-
dent’s advisers estimated that with the cuts, GDP would grow at only 2.5 percent 
a year. However, their advice came too late to influence the policy decisions.
2	 During 1994, the U.S. government urged the Japanese to increase public spending 
and cut taxes to stimulate their economy. The Japanese came up with a plan and 
presented it to U.S. policymakers, who evaluated it using multiplier analysis. They 
thought the plan did not provide enough fiscal stimulus and urged the Japanese 
to take more aggressive actions. Several years later, the Japanese did adopt a more 
aggressive plan. Unfortunately, the Japanese government raised taxes in 1997, 
actually sending the country further into a recession.
3	 During the late 1990s, the Chinese economy came under pressure from the eco-
nomic downturn in Asia and its own attempts to reform and restructure its econ-
omy. To prevent a severe economic slowdown, the Chinese successively engaged 
in active fiscal policy, increasing spending on domestic infrastructure, including 
roads, rails, and urban facilities.
4	 After the September 11, 2001, terrorist attack on the United States, the govern-
ment increased spending for disaster relief in New York and provided subsidies 
and loan guarantees to the airlines. In addition, President Bush and Congress 
immediately began to work on additional spending programs and tax-relief pro-
grams to stimulate the economy.
5	 President Obama’s economic advisors used multiplier analysis to gauge the size 
of their stimulus package. The multipliers they used ranged between 1 and 2 for 
different components of spending. Although some observers suggested the stimu-
lus package should be even larger than $800 billion, or 5.5 percent of GDP, the 
economic advisors argued that this size stimulus would be sufficient to offset the 
worst of the recession.
Though it is very simple, our income-expenditure model illustrates some impor-
tant lessons:
• An increase in government spending will increase total planned expenditures for 
goods and services.
• Cutting taxes will increase the after-tax income of consumers and will also lead 
to an increase in planned expenditures for goods and services.
• Policymakers need to take into account the multipliers for government spending 
and taxes as they develop policies.
The idea that governments should use active fiscal policy to combat recessions was 
argued forcibly by John Maynard Keynes in the 1930s. His book The General Theory 

part 4
264
of Employment, Interest, and Money provided the intellectual foundation for the income-
expenditure model in this chapter and explained why economies could become mired 
in recessions and fail to recover on their own. As a consequence, Keynes strongly advo-
cated aggressive fiscal policymaking as the best option policymakers have for bringing 
economies out of recessions. Keynes was a very public figure and took a major role in 
policy debates throughout his life.
One of Keynes’s controversial ideas was that governments could stimulate the 
economy even if they spent money on wasteful projects. In the General Theory, he even 
remarked (tongue-in-cheek) how lucky the Egyptians were because the death of the 
pharaohs would lead to new pyramids being built. Pyramids do not add to the stock 
of capital to produce regular goods and services. But Keynes’s point was that building 
pyramids (or antisatellite missiles today) does add to planned expenditures and stimu-
lates GDP in the short run.
In the long run, of course, we are better off if government spends the money 
wisely, such as on needed infrastructure like roads and bridges. This is an example of 
the principle of opportunity cost.
P r i n c i p l e  o f  O p p o r t u n i t y  C o s t 
The opportunity cost of something is what you sacrifice to get it.
But even here, we can carry things too far. Japan is notorious for its excessive public 
spending on infrastructure, driven in part by the central government’s doing favors for local 
politicians by creating jobs in their districts. Economists have even compared spending on 
bridges and roads in Japan to Keynes’s famous pyramids. 
Understanding Automatic Stabilizers
With a slight addition to our basic model, we can explain one of the important facts in 
U.S. economic history. Figure 11.10 plots the rate of growth of U.S. real GDP from 
1871 to 2009. It is apparent from the graph that the U.S. economy has been much 
more stable after World War II than before. A major reason is that government taxes

and transfer payments, such as unemployment insurance and welfare payments, grew 
sharply after the war. These taxes and transfer payments can automatically reduce fluc-
tuations in real GDP and thereby stabilize the economy. As we saw in the last chapter, 
taxes and transfers act as automatic stabilizers for the economy.
Again, here is how the automatic stabilizers work. On the one hand, when income 
is high the government collects more taxes and pays out less in transfer payments. 
Because the government is taking funds out of the hands of consumers, there will be 
reduced consumer spending. On the other hand, when output is low (such as during 
recessions), the government collects less in taxes and pays out more in transfer pay-
ments, increasing consumer spending because the government is putting funds into 
the hands of consumers. The automatic stabilizers prevent consumption from falling as 
much in bad times and from rising as much in good times. This stabilizes the economy 
without any need for decisions from Congress or the White House.
To see how automatic stabilizers work in our model, we must take into account 
that the government levies income taxes by applying a tax rate to the level of income. 
To simplify, suppose there is a single tax rate of 0.2 (or 20 percent) and income is $100. 
The government would then collect $20 in taxes (0.2 * $100).
If consumption depends on after-tax income, we have the following consumption 
function:
C = Ca + b(1 - t)y
This is the consumption function with income taxes. The only difference between 
the consumption function with income taxes and the consumption function without 
income taxes is that the marginal propensity to consume is adjusted for taxes, and so
adjusted MPC = b(1 - t)

The Broken Window Fallacy and Keynesian Economics
Applying the Concepts #3: How does Keynesian economics change our normal ideas of economic scarcity?
Hazlitt applies a similar argument to public spending 
financed by taxes. A government spending program may 
appear to increase business, but the taxes needed to finance 
the spending—either paid now or in the future—will mean less 
business for other firms. Government spending and the taxes 
necessary to finance it will just crowd out other production of 
goods and services in the economy.
Hazlitt’s argument works in the classical world when the 
economy is operating at full employment. But in the Keynes-
ian world, where resources are underemployed, the story is 
quite different. Here the increase in spending—even financed 
by taxes—will bring resources that are not being utilized into 
the economy. As long as there is excess capacity in the econ-
omy, the extra spending will increase output and not crowd 
out other goods and services. In the Keynesian world, the 
logic of opportunity costs is temporarily suspended. Once 
the economy is restored to full employment, however, we 
return to the world where opportunity costs matter.  Related 
to ­Exercises 3.8 and 4.6.
SOURCE: Henry Hazlitt, Economics in One Lesson (New Rochelle, NY: Arlington 
House, 1979), Chapters 2–4.
Austrian economist Henry Hazlitt popularized the “Broken Win-
dows” fallacy in economics. Imagine that a hoodlum threw a 
brick through a store window. While at first this seems to be 
a tragedy, the store owner has to hire a firm to fix the window. 
That generates business for the window repair firm and, through 
a multiplier, additional business throughout the community. Was 
the broken window good for society?
The fallacy here is that the money that the store owner paid 
to have the window repaired would have been spent elsewhere 
in the economy, say on clothing. While the window repair busi-
ness profited, the clothing store lost business. In other words, 
there was an opportunity cost from the funds spent to repair 
the broken window.

The reason for this adjustment is that consumers keep only a fraction (1 - t) 
of their income; the rest, t, goes to the government. When income increases by $1, 
consumers’ after-tax incomes increase by only $1 * (1 - t), and of that $(1 - t) they 
spend a fraction, b.
Raising the tax rate therefore lowers the MPC adjusted for taxes. Figure 11.11 
shows the consequences of raising tax rates. With a higher tax rate, the government 
takes a higher fraction of income, and less is leftover for consumers. Recall that the 
slope of the C + I + G line is the marginal propensity to consume. Raising the tax 
rate lowers the adjusted MPC and reduces the slope of this line. The C + I + G line 
with taxes intersects the 45° line at a lower level of income. Output falls from y0 to y1.

Note that as we raise tax rates, the C + I + G schedule rotates and does not just 
move down vertically as in our previous examples. The reason for this difference is that 
as we change the tax rate, we change the adjusted MPC, and thus the slope of the line.
Remember that a smaller marginal propensity to consume also leads to a lower 
value for the multiplier. As tax rates increase and the adjusted MPC falls, the multiplier 
will decrease. A smaller multiplier means that any shocks, such as shocks to investment, 
will have less of an impact on the economy.
Now that we have introduced income taxes into our model, we can see how auto-
matic stabilizers work. Since World War II, taxes and transfer payments in the United 
States have increased sharply. As we have seen, higher tax rates will lower the multiplier 
and make the economy less susceptible to shocks. With higher taxes and transfer pay-
ments, the link between fluctuations in disposable personal income and fluctuations 
in GDP is much looser. Because disposable personal income is more stable, consump-
tion spending is also more stable. Thus, the multiplier is smaller, and the economy is 
more stable.
As we have said, automatic stabilizers work silently in the background, doing 
their job without requiring explicit action by policymakers. Total tax collections rise 
and fall with GDP without requiring that policymakers change tax rates. The fact 

Chapter 11 • The Income-Expenditure Model
267
that the automatic stabilizers work without any laws being enacted is particularly 
important at times when it is difficult to obtain a political consensus for taking any 
action, and policymakers are reluctant to use Keynesian fiscal policy as a deliberate 
policy tool.
Other factors contribute to the stability of the economy, as depicted in ­Figure 11.10. 
As we explained in the last chapter, many consumers base their spending decisions in 
part on their long-run average income or permanent income, not just their current level 
of income. If households base their consumption on their long-run income, they will 
not be very sensitive to changes in their current income. For example, if their income 
temporarily rises, they are likely to save, not spend, the additional income. Similarly, 
if their income temporarily falls, they are likely to maintain their consumption and 
reduce their current savings. In effect, when consumers base their consumption on their 
long-run average income, their MPC out of current income (which could be higher or 
lower than their long-run income) will be small. And because the MPC out of current 
income is small, the multiplier will be small as well.
Another important factor in promoting the stability of the economy is firms’ 
knowledge that the federal government will be taking actions to stabilize the economy. 
Firms are less likely to decrease their investment spending in the face of a possible 
recession if they believe the government is likely to intervene to offset the severity 
of recessions. Because investment spending tends to be a very volatile component of 
spending, any factor that helps stabilize investment spending will also stabilize the 
economy. The same logic also applies to consumers. If they believe the government 
will offset the severity of economic fluctuations, they are less likely to change their 
consumption spending in the face of shocks to their income.
Finally, in recent decades changes in firms’ inventory management practices have 
also contributed to the stability of the economy. In the past, manufacturing firms often 
kept large inventories at their factories. If an unexpected shock slowed the economy, 
the demand for firms’ products would decrease and inventories would pile up. Firms 
would be forced to cut production even further to reduce their stock of inventories, 
adding additional downward pressure on the economy. This additional decrease in 
demand was known as the inventory cycle and was a significant component of earlier 
recessions. In recent times, U.S. firms have paid more attention to forecasting changes 
in the demand for their products and have adopted sophisticated computer manage-
ment techniques to reduce the size of inventories they normally hold. With less inven-
tory on hand, firms do not have to change their production as much to adjust their 
inventories. The result is that the inventory cycle has become a less important factor 
for economic instability.
Exports and Imports
With international trade becoming increasingly important economically and politi-
cally, it is critical to understand how exports and imports affect the level of GDP. Two 
simple modifications of our income-expenditure model will enable us to understand 
how exports and imports affect GDP in the short run.
Exports affect GDP through their influence on how other countries demand goods 
and services produced in the United States. An increase in exports means there’s an 
increase in the demand for goods produced in the United States. An increase in imports 
means there’s an increase in foreign goods purchased by U.S. residents. Importing 
goods rather than purchasing them from our domestic producers reduces the demand 
for U.S. goods. For example, if we in the United States spend a total of $10 billion on 
all automobiles but we import $3 billion of them, then we’ve spent only $7 billion on 
U.S. automobiles.
To get a clearer picture of the effects on GDP from exports and imports, let’s for 
the moment ignore government spending and taxes. In the appendix, we present a 
complete model with both a domestic government and foreign countries to whom we 
sell our exports and from whom we buy our imports. To modify our model to include 
Learning Objective 11.5

in determining equilibrium income.

the effects of world spending on exports and U.S. spending on imports, we need to 
take two steps:
1	 Add exports, X, as another source of demand for U.S. goods and services.
2	 Subtract imports, M, from total spending by U.S. residents. We assume that 
imports, like consumption, increase with the level of income.
Consumers will import more goods as their income rises. We can write this as
M = my
where m is a fraction known as the marginal propensity to import. We subtract this 
fraction from b, the overall marginal propensity to consume, to obtain the MPC for 
spending on domestic goods, b - m. For example, if b is 0.8 and m is 0.2, then for every 
$1 that GDP increases, total consumption increases by $0.80, but spending on domestic 
goods increases by only $0.60 because $0.20 is spent on imports. The MPC in this 
example, adjusted for imports, is 0.8 - 0.2, or 0.6.
Figure 11.12 shows how equilibrium output is determined in an open economy, 
that is, an economy that engages in trade with the rest of the world. We plot planned 
expenditures for U.S. goods and services on our graph and find the level of equilibrium 
income where it intersects the 45° line. The planned expenditure line has an intercept 
on the vertical axis of Ca + I + X, which is the sum of autonomous consumption, 
investment, and exports. The slope of the line is b - m, which is the MPC adjusted 
for imports. Equilibrium output is the value of output where planned expenditures for 
U.S. goods cross the 45° line.

Let’s examine an application of the model we just developed. Suppose Japan decides 
to buy another $5 billion worth of goods from the United States. What will happen 
to U.S. domestic output? Panel A of Figure 11.13 shows the effect of an increase in 
exports. The demand line will shift vertically upward by the increase in exports (∆X). 
This will increase equilibrium income from y0 to y1.

Chapter 11 • The Income-Expenditure Model
269
The increase in income will be larger than the increase in exports because of the 
multiplier effect. This multiplier is based on the MPC adjusted for trade. For example, 
if b is 0.8 and m is 0.2, the adjusted MPC (b - m) is 0.6, and the multiplier will be
1
(1 - 0.6) = 2.5
Therefore, a $5 billion increase in exports will lead to a $12.5 billion increase in GDP.

The Locomotive Effect: How Foreign Demand Affects a Country’s Output
APPLYING THE CONCEPTS #4: How do countries benefit from growth in their trading partners?
part of the world economy, its demands for foreign goods—U.S. 
imports—fueled exports in foreign countries and promoted their 
growth. Studies have shown that the increase in demand for 
foreign goods was actually more pronounced for developing 
countries than for developed countries. The United States was 
truly a locomotive, pulling the developing countries along.
When the U.S. economy began to slow in 2007 because of 
our housing and financial difficulties, growth in other parts of the 
world, including China and India, was still robust. Their demand 
for U.S. goods spurred our exports and helped prevent U.S. 
GDP from falling any further. In this case, foreign countries were 
the true locomotives. As our chapter-opening story describes, 
China remained a locomotive during the downturn.  Related to 
Exercise 5.7.
SOURCE: Based on William R. Cline, The United States as a Debtor Nation 
­(Washington, D.C.: Institute for International Economics, 2005), Chapter 6.
From the early 1990s until quite recently, the United States 
was what economists term the “locomotive” for global growth, 
growing faster than the rest of the world and increasing its 
demand for foreign products. As a share of the world economy, 
the United States grew from approximately 26 percent in 1992 
to over 32 percent in 2001. Imports increase as an economy 
grows, and U.S. imports also increased along with output dur-
ing this period. Because the U.S. economy is such an important 

part 4
270
Now, suppose U.S. residents become more attracted to foreign goods, and as a 
result our marginal propensity to import increases. What happens to GDP? Panel B of 
Figure 11.13 depicts the effect of an increase in imported foreign goods. The adjusted 
MPC (b - m) will fall as the marginal propensity to import increases. This reduces the 
slope of the planned expenditure line, and output will fall from y0 to y1. The reason the 
line rotates rather than shifting down vertically is that an increase in the propensity to 
import changes the slope of the planned expenditure line.
We can now understand why our domestic political leaders are eager to sell our 
goods abroad. Whether it is electronics or weapons, increased U.S. exports will increase 
U.S. GDP and reduce unemployment in the short run. We can also understand how 
a recession abroad that led to a decrease in imports of U.S. goods could cause a reces-
sion here. At the same time, we can further understand why politicians will find “buy 
American” policies attractive in the short run. To the extent that U.S. residents buy 
U.S. goods rather than imports, output will be higher. This reasoning is also why other 
countries like to see the United States grow rapidly.
The Income-Expenditure Model and the  
Aggregate Demand Curve
We used the income-expenditure model in this chapter to understand more fully short-
term economic fluctuations. The income-expenditure model is based on the assump-
tion that prices do not change. In Figure 11.14, we see how the model provides the 
foundation for the aggregate demand curve, which will enable us to analyze changes 
both in output and prices.
Learning Objective 11.6
Explain how the aggregate demand 
curve is related to the income-
expenditure model.
▲  Figure 11.14  Deriving the Aggregate Demand Curve
As the price level falls from P0 to P1, planned expenditures increase, which increases the level of output 
from y0 to y1. The aggregate demand curve shows the combination of prices and equilibrium output.

Suppose the price level in the economy is P0 and, at that level of prices, planned 
expenditures are C0 + I0. At the top of the figure, we show how equilibrium output is 
determined at level of output, y0. In the bottom part of the figure, we plot the price 
level, P0, and corresponding level of output, y0. In the graph, this is point a.
Now let’s lower the price level to P1. Recall from our discussion in Chapter 9 that a 
lower price level will increase the demand for goods and services through wealth effects, 
the interest rate effect, and the international trade effect. (You may want to go back 
and review this discussion.) As a consequence of the increased demand for goods and 
services arising from a lower price level, we show a higher level of planned expenditure, 
C1 + I1, and a higher level of equilibrium output, y1, in the top part of the figure. In the 
bottom part, we again plot the price level, P1, and the corresponding level of output, 
y1. In the graph, this is point b.
Both point a and point b are on the aggregate demand curve. By the same logic, we 
can create all the other points on the aggregate demand curve by either raising or low-
ering the aggregate price level. For any price level, the income-expenditure model can 
be used to determine the level of output and the corresponding point on the aggregate 
demand curve. Thus, the income-expenditure model provides the basic foundation for 
the aggregate demand curve.
At any price level, the income-expenditure model determines the level of equi-
librium output and the corresponding point on the aggregate demand curve. What 
would happen if we kept the price level at P0 but increased planned expenditures, let’s 
say through an increase in government expenditures from G0 to G1? We depict this 
case in Figure 11.15. The increase in government expenditure will raise the equilibrium 
output, from y0 to y1. Because the price level has not changed, we have a higher level of 
output at the same level of price. This means the aggregate demand curve would shift 
▲  Figure 11.15  Shifts in Aggregate Demand
As government spending increases from G0 to G1, planned expenditures increase, which raises output 
from y0 to y1. At the price level P0, this shifts the aggregate demand curve to the right, from aD0 to aD1.

This chapter developed 
the income-expenditure 
model, which is useful for 
understanding short-run 
fluctuations. We developed 
the graphical and algebraic 
tools to study the effects 
of consumer behavior, 
government spending and 
taxation, and exports and imports in determining GDP in the short 
run. Here are the chapter’s main points:
1.	 In the income-expenditure model, the level of output in the econ-
omy will adjust to equal the level of planned expenditures. This 
level of output is called equilibrium output.
2.	 Consumption spending consists of two parts. One part is inde-
pendent of income, but it can be influenced by changes in wealth 
or consumer sentiment. The other part depends on the level of 
income.
3.	 Increases in planned expenditures by households, the gov-
ernment, or the foreign sector lead to increases in equilibrium 
output.
4.	 Because of the multiplier, the final increase in equilibrium out-
put is larger than the initial increase. The formula for the simple 
multiplier is
multiplier =
1
(1 - MpC)
5.	 Policymakers can use multipliers to calculate the appropriate size 
of economic policies.
6.	 Higher tax rates, by reducing the multiplier, can reduce fluctua-
tions in GDP.
7.	 Increases in exports lead to increases in equilibrium output; 
increases in imports lead to decreases in equilibrium output.
8.	 The income-expenditure model can be used to derive the aggre-
gate demand curve.

Chapter Summary and Problems
to the right, from AD0 to AD1. In general, increases in planned expenditures that are 
not directly caused by changes in prices will shift the aggregate demand curve to the 
right; decreases in planned expenditures will shift the curve to the left.
In the remaining chapters, we use the aggregate demand and supply curves to ana-
lyze economic fluctuations. This enables us to understand movements in both prices 
and output in the intermediate and longer runs. But, as we have seen, the income-
expenditure model developed in this chapter provides the underlying foundation for 
the aggregate demand curve.

1.5	 Understanding Inventory Behavior. Use the simple 
income-expenditure model to analyze the following 
scenarios.
a.	 Suppose clothing stores anticipate a good fashion 
season and add substantially to inventories in their 
stores. What will happen to GDP?
b.	Suppose economists see inventories suddenly 
increasing. Does this necessarily mean that there 
are increases in demand for final goods and services?
1.6	 Understanding the 45° Line. Use the simple income-
expenditure diagram depicted in Figure 11.3 on 
page 252 to answer the following questions.
a.	 If output equals y1, what is the level of expenditures?
b.	At output equal to y1, does the level of expenditures 
fall above, below, or on the 45° line?
c.	 What does this say about the relationship between 
output and expenditures?
The Consumption Function
Identify the two key components of the  
consumption function.
2.1	 The consumption function describes the relationship 
between consumption expenditures and the level of 
_________.
2.2	 A decrease in consumer confidence will shift the con-
sumption function _________ (upward/downward).
2.3	 If housing prices fall, you would expect the consump-
tion function to shift _________ (upward/downward).
2.4	 Because the MPC is positive, the consumption function 
is _________ (upward/downward) sloping.
2.5	 Housing Price Increases and Falling Savings. 
Explain why some economists believed the increase 
in housing prices after 2002 was related to the fall in 
household savings that was also observed during that 
period. (Related to Application 1 on page 255.)
2.6	 Retirement Savings and the Fall and Rise in the 
Stock Market. When the stock market rose from 2009 
until 2015, many people near retirement found that the 
balances in their account had increased; however, in 
the preceding 2 years, their balances had fallen. How 
do you think consumers would respond to the recent 
increase in stock prices?
2.7	 Is the Wealth Effect on Consumption from Hous-
ing Symmetrical? When housing prices rose, some 
households took out a larger loan on their homes and 
used the additional funds they borrowed to finance 
purchases of consumer durables. This option is not 
available when housing prices fall. Explain how this dif-
ference might lead to a larger wealth effect for increases 
in housing prices than decreases in prices. (Related to 
Application 1 on page 255.)
Equilibrium Output and the Consumption Function
Calculate equilibrium income in a simple model.
3.1	 In our simple model, if C = 100 + 0.8y, and I = 50, 
equilibrium output will be _________.
3.2	 If in Exercise 3.1 I increases to 100,
a.	 the equilibrium income will be _________.
b.	the multiplier is _________.
3.3	 The slope of the consumption function equals 
_________ while the slope of the 45°degree line equals 
_________.
3.4	 If the MPC decreases, the multiplier will _________.
3.5	 Estimating Changes in Aggregate Demand.
a.	 Suppose C = Ca + 0.6y and that a shock decreases 
Ca by $10 billion. By how much will equilibrium 
income decrease?
b.	An economy has an MPC of 0.6. By how much 
will a $10 billion increase in government purchases 
increase equilibrium income? By how much will a 
$10 billion increase in taxes decrease equilibrium 
income?
3.6	 The Paradox of Thrift. The United States has insti-
tuted many policies to attempt to increase savings rates 
in the United States. One such policy was the creation 
of individual retirement accounts and other incentives 
for savings. An implication of the income-expenditure 
model is that an increase in the desire of consumers to 
save will not necessarily lead to higher savings. In fact, 
total savings will either remain the same or perhaps fall. 
This is known as the paradox of thrift. Let’s see why this 
is true with an example.
a.	 Suppose I equals 40 and the savings function is 
S = -100 + 0.4y. Equilibrium income, y, in the 
economy is 350. Now suppose consumers wish to 
increase their savings; the new savings function 
becomes S = -80 + 0.4y Calculate the new level 
of equilibrium output and savings after the change 
in the savings function.
b.	Explain why equilibrium savings are unchanged.
c.	 Now suppose that with a decline in equilibrium 
income, investment also falls. What would be the 
effect on equilibrium output and total savings if 
households now wished to increase their desired 
savings?
d.	What does this suggest about the ability of policy-
makers to increase aggregate savings by affecting 
citizens’ savings rates?
3.7	 Solving a Simple Model. Consider an economy in 
which C = 200 + 0.5y and I = 200.
a.	 Determine the equilibrium income algebraically.
b.	What is the multiplier for investment spending for 
this economy?

c.	 What is the savings function?
d.	Draw the savings function on a graph with the 
investment level and indicate how equilibrium 
income is determined.
e.	What is the level of saving at the level of equilibrium 
income? Show it is equal to investment.
3.8	 Wealth versus Income. When Hurricane Sandy hit 
the East Coast in 2012, houses were destroyed and later 
many were rebuilt. Immediately after the hurricane, 
what happened to total wealth? As rebuilding occurred, 
what happened to the level of income? (Related to 
Application 3 on page 265.)
3.9	 A Difficulty in Estimating Government Spending 
Multipliers. Tax revenues typically rise along with 
GDP. Governments may typically spend some of this 
additional revenue on discretionary items in the bud-
get. Assuming this is true, how does this complicate 
the work of analysts trying to determine the multiplier 
effects of discretionary spending on GDP? (Related to 
Application 2 on page 260.)
3.10	 The Long-Run Multiplier. Using the aggregate 
demand and the long-run aggregate supply curve from 
the previous chapter, what is the government multi-
plier in the very long run? Use your answer to explain 
the intuition that multiplier during recessions are 
higher than multipliers near full employment. (Related 
to Application 2 on p. 260.)
Government Spending and Taxation
Explain how government spending and taxes affect 
equilibrium income.
4.1	 The multiplier for taxes is greater than the multiplier 
for government spending. _________ (True/False)
4.2	 An increase in the tax rate will _________ the govern-
ment spending multiplier.
4.3	 Economic fluctuations have _________ since World 
War II.
4.4	 An increase in both government spending and taxes by 
the same amount _________ GDP.
4.5	 Using Fiscal Multipliers. Suppose that during a reces-
sion a country wishes to increase its GDP by 100. The 
MPC is 0.8.
a.	 Using the government spending multiplier, by how 
much should government spending be increased?
b.	Using the tax multiplier, by how much should taxes 
be decreased?
4.6	 Seen and Not Seen. Another way to describe the bro-
ken windows fallacy is to say that we often concentrate 
on what we see and not on what we do not see. How 
does this way of expressing the fallacy relate to gov-
ernment public works in a classical world? (Related to 
Application 3 on page 265.)
4.7	 President Ford’s Theory. During the 1970s, President 
Gerald Ford proposed that taxes be decreased but that, to 
avoid increasing the government budget deficit, govern-
ment spending should be decreased by the same amount.
a.	 What happens to GDP if taxes and government 
spending are both decreased by the same amount?
b.	Should President Ford have been worried about his 
tax-reduction plan? Why or why not?
4.8	 Substitute Fiscal Policies. In the story that opened 
this chapter, we saw that China and the U.S. had 
more aggressive stimulus policies than France and the 
United Kingdom. But China and the U.S. also have a 
lower level of government spending as a share of GDP 
compared to those other countries. If we assume that 
the level of government spending as a share of GDP is 
a good proxy for the size of automatic stabilizers, can 
you give an explanation of why France and the United 
Kingdom had smaller stimulus plans?
4.9	 Keynes’s Other Contributions. Although John 
­Maynard Keynes is best known today for his book The 
General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money, he 
made other important contributions as well. Search the 
Web to find out (1) Keynes’s main criticism of the Treaty 
of Versailles, which ended World War I and (2) his con-
tribution to the post–World War II monetary system.
Exports and Imports
Discuss the role of exports and imports in determining 
equilibrium income.
5.1	 A decrease in the marginal propensity to import will 
_________ the multiplier for investment spending.
5.2	 The _________ is positive because consumers import 
more goods and services as income rises.
5.3	 Use the income-expenditure graph to illustrate how an 
increase in exports will affect GDP.
5.4	 If the marginal propensity to import is 0.2, then a $1,000 
increase in income will increase imports by _________.
5.5	 Trade Wars. During the 1930s, many countries in 
the world—including the United States—tried to help 
their own economies by restricting imported goods. 
But because one country’s imports are another coun-
try’s exports, such actions cause international repercus-
sions. Let’s look at the worldwide consequences of such 
policies using the income-expenditure model.
a.	 Suppose the United States adopted policies to reduce 
imports from Europe. This means European exports 
to the United States would be reduced. What would 
happen to European equilibrium income?
b.	Suppose, in response to U.S. policies, Europe 
decides to restrict imports from the United States. 
What then happens to U.S equilibrium income?
c.	 What do you think happened to the volume of world 
trade during the 1930s?

Estimating the Marginal Propensity 
to Consume
For this experiment, each class member is asked to fill out the 
following table. Given a certain monthly income, how would 
you spend it and how much would you save? The top row of 
each column gives you the monthly disposable income. How 
would you allocate it each month among the various catego-
ries of spending in the table and savings? Complete each 
column in the table. The sum of your entries should equal 
your disposable income at the top of each column. After you 
have filled out the chart, compute the changes in your savings 
and total consumption as your income goes up. What is your 
marginal propensity to save (MPS)? What is your marginal 
propensity to consume (MPC) over your total expenditures? 
Graph your consumption function.

5.6	 Using Open-Economy Multipliers. In an open econ-
omy, the marginal propensity to consume is 0.9, and 
the marginal propensity to import is 0.3. How much of 
an increase in investment would be necessary to raise 
GDP by 200? What would be your answer if this was a 
closed economy?
5.7	 Export-Led Growth Strategies. Many countries 
believe that they need to increase exports in order to 
grow. Some of this belief is based on long-run consid-
erations, as competing in export markets may induce 
their firms to innovate. But some countries also focus 
on the short-run benefits. What are these benefits?

The Income-Expenditure Model and the Aggregate 
Demand Curve
Explain how the aggregate demand curve is related to the 
income-expenditure model.
6.1	 An increase in the price level will _________ GDP and 
thereby move the economy _________ the aggregate 
demand curve.
6.2	 At any price level, the income-expenditure model 
determines the level of equilibrium output and the cor-
responding point on the _________ curve.
6.3	 An increase in the price level will not shift the aggre-
gate demand curve. _________ (True/False)
6.4	 A leftward shift in the aggregate demand curve cor-
responds to a(n) _________ in equilibrium income.
6.5	 Using Multipliers to Determine the Shift of the 
Aggregate Demand Curve.
a.	 Suppose the MPC is equal to 0.8. Government

Formulas for Equilibrium Income and the Multiplier
In the chapter, we developed the logic of the income-expenditure model and gener-
ally relied on graphical analysis. However, we also referred to a few formulas. In this 
appendix, we explain where these formulas, both for equilibrium income and the mul-
tiplier, come from.
Specifically, in this appendix, we do three things:
• Derive a simple formula for calculating equilibrium output for the simplest 
economy in which there is no government spending or taxes.
• Derive the multipliers for the economy with the government.
• Derive equilibrium output with both government and the foreign sector.
To derive the formula for equilibrium output, we use simple algebra in the fol-
lowing steps:
1	 We know that equilibrium output occurs where output equals planned expendi-
tures, and we know that planned expenditures equal C + I; therefore,
 output = planned expenditures = C + I
 output = C + I
2	 Next, we substitute the symbol y for output; more importantly, we substitute for 
the consumption function, C = (Ca + by):
y = (Ca + by) + I
3	 Collect all terms in y on the left side of the equation:
y - by = Ca + I
4	 Factor the left side:
y(1 - b) = Ca + I
5	 Divide both sides by (1 - b):
y* = (Ca + I)
(1 - b)
where y* means the equilibrium level of output. This is the formula for equilibrium 
output in the text.
Now let’s find the multiplier for investment in this simple economy. To do that, 
we use the formula we just derived and calculate the equilibrium income at one level of 
investment, which we call the original level, and then calculate the equilibrium income 
at some other level of investment, which we call the new level. (We will “calculate” in 
general terms, not in specific numerical quantities.) What we will get is a formula for 
the change in output that results from the changes in investment.
For the original level of investment at I0, we have
y0 = (Ca + I0)
(1 - b)
For a new level of investment at I1, we have
y1 = (Ca + I1)
(1 - b)
Ap pend ix

277
The change in output ∆y, is the difference between the two levels of output that occur 
at each level of investment:
∆y = y1 - y0
Substituting for the levels of output, we have
∆y = (Ca + I1)
(1 - b)
- (Ca + I0)
(1 - b)
Because the denominator in both expressions is the same (1 - b), we can put the 
numerators over that common denominator:
 ∆y = (Ca + I1) - (Ca + I0)
(1 - b)
 ∆y = (I1 - I0)
(1 - b)
Finally, because (I1 - I0) is the change in investment, ∆I, we can write
∆y =
∆I
(1 - b)
or
∆y
∆I =
1
(1 - b)
Therefore, because the multiplier is the ratio of the change in income to the change in 
investment spending, we have
the multiplier =
∆y
∆I =
1
(1 - b)
Here is another way to derive the formula for the multiplier. This way helps to 
illustrate its underlying logic. Suppose investment spending increases by $1. Because 
spending determines output, output will rise by $1. However, because consumption 
depends on income, consumption will increase by the marginal propensity to consume 
times the change in income. This means that as output rises by $1, consumption will 
increase by (b * $1). Because spending determines output, this additional increase in 
consumer demand will cause output to rise further (b * $1). But again, as output and 
income increase, consumption will increase by MPC times the change in income, which 
in this case will be b * (b * $1) or b2 * $1. As we allow this process to continue, the 
total change in output will be
∆y = $1 + ($1 * b) + ($1 * b2) + ($1 * b3) c
or
∆y = $1 * (1 + b + b2 + b3 + c)
The term in parentheses is an infinite series whose value is equal to
1
(1 - b)
Substituting this value for the infinite series, we have the expression for the multiplier:
∆y = $1 *
1
(1 - b)
Now we introduce government spending and taxes. Government spending is 
another determinant of planned expenditures, and consumption spending depends on 
after-tax income, so consumption equals Ca + b (y - T). Following the same steps 

we used for equilibrium output without government, we do the same, but now with 
government:
 output = planned expenditures = (C + I + G)
 y = Ca + b(y - T) + I + G
We first collect all terms in y on the left and leave the other terms on the right:
y - by = Ca - bT + I + G
We then factor the left side:
y(1 - b) = Ca - bT + I + G
We then divide both sides by (1 - b):
y* = (Ca - bT + I + G)
(1 - b)
Using this formula and the method just outlined, we can find the multiplier for 
changes in government spending and the multiplier for changes in taxes:
 government spending multiplier =
1
(1 - b)
 tax multiplier =
-b
(1 - b)
The multiplier for an increase in government spending is larger than the tax multiplier 
for a reduction in taxes in the same amount as an increase in government spending. 
Government spending increases total demand directly. Reductions in taxes first affect 
consumers’ incomes. Because consumers will save a part of their income increase from 
the tax cut, not all of the tax cut is spent. Therefore, the tax multiplier is smaller (in 
absolute value) than the government spending multiplier.
As we explained in the text, because government spending has a larger multiplier 
than taxes, equal increases in government spending and taxes, called balanced-budget 
increases, will increase total output. For equal dollar increases in both taxes and gov-
ernment spending, the positive effects from the spending increase will outweigh the 
negative effects from the tax increase. To find the balanced-budget multiplier, just add 
the government spending and tax multipliers:
 balanced@budget multiplier = government spending multiplier + tax multiplier
 =
1
(1 - b) +
-b
(1 - b)
 = (1 - b)
(1 - b)
 = 1
The balanced-budget multiplier equals 1; a $10 billion increase in both taxes and gov-
ernment spending will increase GDP by $10 billion.
Finally, we derive equilibrium output with government spending, taxes, and 
the foreign sector. First, recall that equilibrium output occurs where output equals 
demand. We now must include planned expenditures from both the government sec-
tor and the foreign sector. Planned expenditures from the foreign sector are exports 
minus imports:
output = planned expenditures = (C + I + G + X - M)
Consumption depends on disposable income:
C = Ca + b(y - T)
278

279
and imports depend on the level of output:
M = my
Substitute the equations for consumption and imports into the equation where output 
equals demand:
y = Ca + b(y - T) + I + G + X - my
Collect all terms in y on the left and leave the other terms on the right:
y - (b - m) y = Ca - bT + I + G + X
Factor the left side:
y[1 - (b - m)] = Ca - bT + I + G + X
Divide both sides by [1 - (b - m)]:
y* = (Ca - bT + I + G + X)
[1 - (b - m)]
This is the expression for equilibrium income with government in an open econ-
omy. It can be used, following the method we outlined, to calculate multipliers in the 
open economy.

Investment and Financial 
Markets
12
C h a p t e r
The housing market is a perfect 
example of the close links between 
investment and finance.
With the stock market falling sharply in 2000, housing 
looked like an alternative and attractive investment. Inter-
est rates were low and homeowners and potential inves-
tors found that it was easy to borrow money to purchase 
new or larger homes. Wall Street and government agen-
cies developed ever more complex ways to pour money 
into the housing market, and banks and finance compa-
nies did not seem to be asking too many questions about 
their borrowers. As housing prices continued to rise, the 
building industry responded to the general euphoria. Investment in residential housing increased 40 percent in real 
terms from 2000 to 2006.
It was too good to last. With all the new construction, the increased supply of housing stopped the rise in 
prices. Some buyers made foolish decisions and took on loans that were too large for their incomes. As financial 
markets became nervous, lenders became more cautious and sharply cut back on funds available to the market. 
With increased supply and reduced demand, housing prices began to fall. The building industry recognized it had 
too many new houses in the pipeline and began to cut back. From its peak in the first quarter of 2006 to the fourth 
quarter of 2009, new housing construction fell by 53 percent. The fall in residential housing alone brought down 
real GDP by 3 percent and devastated many state economies. The lingering effects of the housing crisis prevented 
a fast recovery from the recession.

nvestment spending plays a number of critical roles in the economy. As we have seen, 
economic growth depends on whether the stock of capital—plant and ­equipment—
increases in the economy. Moreover, investment is also a key component of aggre-
gate demand, so fluctuations in investment spending can cause recessions and booms. 
In this chapter, we study the factors that determine investment spending by firms. We 
also examine the role that institutions such as banks, savings and loans, and other new 
and evolving financial institutions play in facilitating that investment.
An investment, broadly defined, is an action that creates a cost today but provides 
benefits in the future. A firm builds a new plant today to earn more revenue in the 
future. College students pay money to attend school now so they can earn higher 
salaries later. A government spends money today to construct a dam that will provide 
hydroelectric power for years to come. These are examples of investments. Notice 
that we’re using the term investment in a broader sense than we did in Chapter 5 when 
we discussed GDP. In that chapter when we talked about investment, we were talking 
about expenditures by firms on currently produced goods and services. In this chapter, 
we broaden the definition to include actions taken by anyone—individuals, firms, and 
governments—to improve well-being later.
An Investment: A Plunge into the Unknown
When individuals, firms, or governments make an investment, they incur costs today 
in the hope of future gains. The phrase “hope of ” is an important aspect of investment 
decisions. That simply means that payoffs occurring in the future cannot be known 
with certainty. Investments are a plunge into the unknown.
Firms and individuals frequently revise their outlook on the future precisely 
because it is uncertain. These revisions can occur suddenly and lead to sharp swings in 
investment spending. Sometimes investors are optimistic and decide to increase their 
investment spending; at other times, they may quickly become pessimistic and cut back 
on their investment spending. To estimate future events, firms pay careful attention 
to the current pace of the economy. If economic growth is sluggish, they are likely to 
forecast that it will be sluggish in the future and cut back on investment spending. If 
economic growth is strong, they are likely to forecast that it will remain so and increase 
their investment spending. In other words, investment spending tends to be closely 
related to the current pace of economic growth.
This phenomenon is known as the accelerator theory of investment spending. It 
postulates that when real GDP growth is expected to be high, firms anticipate that 
investing in plants and equipment will pay off later, so they increase their total invest-
ment spending. However, John Maynard Keynes had another theory. Keynes said the 
sharp swings in optimism and pessimism related to investment spending were often 
irrational, reflecting, perhaps, our most basic, primal instincts. He often referred to 
them as the “animal spirits” of investors. It was, in part, animal spirits that led to the 
rise and fall in residential investment that we discussed in the chapter-opening story.
It is likely that both projections for the future and Keynes’s animal spirits are closely 
associated with current investment. If this is the case, we would expect investment spending 
to be a very volatile component of GDP. As Figure 12.1 indicates, this is indeed the case.
Figure 12.1 plots total investment spending as a share of U.S. GDP from 1970 to 
2013. Notice two things about Figure 12.1:
• From 1970 to 2013, the share of investment as a component of GDP ranged 
from a low of about 10 percent in 1975 to a high of over 19 percent in 2005—a 
dramatic 9-percentage-point difference.
• Swings in investment spending often occurred over short periods of time. For 
example, during recessions (noted by the shaded areas in the figure), investment 
spending fell sharply. During booms, investment spending rose sharply. In other 
words, investment spending is highly procyclical; it increases during booms and 
falls during recessions.

Many different factors can contribute to uncertainty in the economy. Volatile 
energy prices are one. In general, when the future is uncertain, firms become cautious 
in their behavior and may postpone making investment decisions.
Although investment spending is a much smaller component of GDP than con-
sumption (approximately 68 versus 16 percent), it is much more volatile than consump-
tion. Recall that changes in the components of GDP—C, I, G, or NX—are amplified 
by the multiplier. For example, if the multiplier is 1.5, and investment spending initially

Energy Price Uncertainty Reduces Investment Spending
Applying the Concepts #1: How Do Fluctuations in Energy Prices Affect Investment Decisions by Firms?
One important way volatility of oil prices can hurt the econ-
omy is by creating uncertainty for firms making investment deci-
sions. For example, consider whether a firm should invest in 
an energy-saving technology for a new plant. If energy prices 
remain high, it may be profitable to invest in energy-saving tech-
nology, but if energy prices fall, these investments would be 
unwise. If firms are faced with an increasingly uncertain future, 
they will delay their investment decisions until the uncertainty is 
resolved. In 2008, oil prices reached $145 a barrel, but later in 
the year fell below $50. On what number should firms base their 
investment decisions?  Related to Exercise 1.8.

As we have seen in previous chapters, increases in oil prices 
can lead to a drop in GDP. However, uncertainty about oil prices 
is also an important factor. Economists Hui Guo and Kevin 
Kliesen found evidence that volatility in oil prices adversely 
affects GDP growth.

falls by 1 percent of GDP, then GDP will fall by 1.5 percent. However, if the fall in 
GDP makes firms more pessimistic, they may cut investment even further. This further 
cut in investment will decrease GDP even more. That is, a small initial fall in invest-
ment can trigger a much larger fall in GDP. Nobel Laureate Paul Samuelson described 
this phenomenon of investment volatility by developing the multiplier-accelerator 
model. The multiplier-accelerator model showed that a downturn in real GDP leads 
to an even sharper fall in investment, which further reduces GDP via the multiplier.
Psychology and expectations about future real GDP growth are not the only factors 
that affect investment. Because investments are really trade-offs—something in the pres-
ent traded for something in the future—the “terms” affecting the trade-off are also impor-
tant. These terms are interest rates, which we discuss next.
Evaluating the Future
A dollar paid today does not have the same value as a dollar paid next year. Because 
investments yield future payoffs, we need to be able to compare costs and benefits at 
different points in time. As we will see, we can use interest rates to do this.
Understanding Present Value
Suppose a good friend comes to you and says, “I need some cash, badly. If you give me 
$100 today, I can give you back $105 next year. Do we have a deal?” How would you 
decide whether to accept this deal? Somehow, you need a tool to be able to compare 
dollars today with dollars received in the future. That tool is present value. The ­present 
value of a payment to be received in the future is the maximum amount a person is will-
ing to pay today to receive the future payment. Recall the principle of opportunity cost.

A model in which a downturn in real 
GDP leads to a sharp fall in investment, 
which triggers further reductions in GDP

Learning Objective 12.2
Discuss the concept of present value.
present value
The maximum amount a person is willing 
to pay today to receive a payment in the 
future.
P r i n c i p l e  o f  O p p o r t u n i t y  C o s t 
The opportunity cost of something is what you sacrifice to get it.
Let’s think about how much you are willing to pay for the right to receive $105 in 
1 year. Suppose you can earn 5 percent per year in a savings account or money market 
account. A moment of thought will show you that you would be willing to lend your friend 
$100. Here is why: If you kept your $100 in the bank at 5 percent interest, you would have 
$105 at the end of the year—just the amount your friend would repay you. While you 
would have sacrificed $5 in interest, you would have earned $5 on the loan ($105 - $100).
However, you would not want to lend your friend more than $100. If you lent 
more—say, $102—then your loss in interest of $5.10 (5 percent of $102) would be 
greater than your $3 gain on the loan ($105 - $102). In this case, the amount you 
sacrifice will be greater than what you get in return.
Of course, you would like to lend your friend less than $100 and make even more 
profit. But the maximum amount you would be willing to pay today to receive $105 next 
year, when the interest rate is 5 percent, is $100. Thus, the present value of $105 in 
this example is $100.
Present Value and Interest Rates  Here is another useful way to think of 
present value. Suppose you want to buy a new car in 5 years for $20,000. You want to 
know how much you need to have in your bank account today, so that after 5 years you 
have the $20,000 to make the payment for the car. A simple formula can answer this 
and similar questions. If K is an amount of money at some point in the future; t is the 
amount of time, or years, in the future until you need the money; and i is the interest 
rate you earn on your account, then the amount you need today is just the present value 
of the K dollars, which is
present value =
K
(1 + i)t

part 4
284
In the example of your friend, her payment (K ) is $105, the interval of time (t) in 
which she’s going to pay it is 1 year, and the interest rate (i) is 0.05. Using the present 
value formula, the present value of $105 in 1 year is $100:
present value =
$105
(1 + 0.05)1 = $100
This is the maximum amount you are willing to lend her today to receive $105 from 
her in 1 year.
Let’s consider another example. Suppose the interest rate were 10 percent and 
you were offered $1,000 to be paid to you in 20 years. How much is that $1,000 worth 
today? That is, how much of your money today would you be willing to “tie up” (loan 
out) to get $1,000 in 20 years? At an interest rate of 10 percent, this is how much:
present value =
$1,000
(1 + 0.10)20 = $148.64
You would be willing to pay only $148.64 today to receive $1,000 in 20 years. The 
reason you would be willing to pay so much less than $1,000 is that money earning 
interest grows over time. At a 10 percent interest rate, after 20 years you would have 
received exactly $1,000 by initially investing just $148.64.
Returning to our original example with your friend, what happens if the interest 
rate is 10 percent instead of 5 percent? If your friend still promises you $105 after 1 year 
but the interest rate is double, how much would you be willing to loan her today? Using 
the formula, you would loan only $95.45 today:
present value =
$105
(1 + 0.10)1 = $95.45
What this means is that if the interest rate is higher, you will be willing to pay less 
for the same payment in the future. This is an important result. The present value of a 
given payment in the future decreases as the interest rate increases. Here is why: With a higher 
interest rate, the opportunity cost of lending out your money is higher. Because you can 
earn more on your money with a higher rate, you will not be willing to pay as much now 
to get the same $105 in the future. Similarly, when interest rates fall, the present value of 
a given payment in the future increases. For example, if interest rates fell to 2 ­percent, the 
present value (the value today) of $105 in 1 year would be higher—$102.94:
present value =
$105
(1 + 0.02)1 = $102.94
With a lower interest rate, the opportunity cost of keeping your money in the bank 
or loaning it to a friend is less. That means you will be willing to pay more money now 
for the same $105 payment in the future.
Let’s summarize our discussion of present value:
1	 The present value—the value today—of a given payment in the future is the maxi-
mum amount a person is willing to pay today for that payment.
2	 As the interest rate increases, the opportunity cost of your funds also increases, so 
the present value of a given payment in the future falls. In other words, you need 
less money today to get to your future “money goal.”
3	 As the interest rate decreases, the opportunity cost of your funds also decreases, so 
the present value of a given payment in the future rises. In other words, you need 
more money today to get to your money goal.
Individuals, firms, and the government all use interest rates to make decisions that 
involve the future. For example, individuals take interest rates into account when they 
decide how much to save for the future or even when to retire. And, as we will see, 
firms and the government use interest rates to decide whether to undertake important 
investments.

When there is inflation, economists make a distinction between the interest rate 
quoted in the market, which is called the nominal interest rate, and the real interest 
rate, which is what you actually earn after taking account of inflation. The real interest 
rate is defined as the nominal interest rate minus the inflation rate:
real rate = nominal rate - inflation rate
If the nominal rate of interest is 6 percent per year and the inflation rate is 4 ­percent 
during the year, the real rate of interest is 2 percent (6 - 4).
To understand what the real rate of interest means, suppose you have $100 and 
annual inflation is 4 percent. It’s not hard to figure out that next year you will need $104 
to have the same purchasing power you do today. Let’s say you deposit today $100 at a 
6 percent annual interest rate. At the end of the year, you will have $106 ($100 * 1.06).
Now let’s calculate your real gain. After 1 year, you will have increased your hold-
ings by $6, but taking into account the $4 you needed to keep up with inflation, your 
gain is only $2. The real rate of interest you earned, the nominal rate adjusted for 
inflation, is 2 percent, or $2.
Let’s see what happens when you borrow money. Suppose you borrow $100 at a 
10 percent annual interest rate, but inflation is 6 percent during the year. At the end of 
the year, you must pay back $110 ($100 * 1.10). But with an inflation rate of 6 percent, 
the lender would need $6 of the $10 you paid in interest just to keep up with inflation. 
That means the lender would effectively get just a $4 gain ($10 - $6), instead of the 
full $10 gain. Thus, when corrected for the effects of inflation, the real rate of interest 
you will have to pay is just 4 percent, or $4, on the original $100 loan.
As an example, in 2002 if seniors invested their money in 3-month U.S. govern-
ment Treasury bills, they would have earned an average interest rate of 1.6 percent. 
However, inflation, as measured by the Consumer Price Index, was 2.4 percent. In real 
terms, these seniors would have actually lost money during the year, earning a negative 
real rate of interest of -0.8 percent.
We defined the real interest rate as the nominal interest rate minus the actual 
inflation rate. When firms or individuals borrow or lend money, they do not know what 
the rate of inflation will actually be in the future. Instead, they must form an 
­expectation—an estimate—of what they believe the inflation rate will be. For a given 
nominal interest rate, we can define the expected real interest rate as the nominal 
interest rate minus the expected inflation rate. The expected real interest rate is the 
rate at which borrowers or lenders expect to make transactions.
It is difficult to precisely determine expected real rates of interest because we 
never know exactly what inflation rates people really anticipate. One approach is to 
rely on the judgments of professional forecasters. Here is an example. In March 2015, 
the nominal interest rate on 1-year U.S. government securities was 0.22 percent. The 
nominal rate was very low, but positive. However, inflation forecasts for the remain-
der of that year were about 2 percent. This meant that the expected real rate was 
-1.78 percent. To determine real returns, we need to know both the nominal rate of 
interest and forecasts for inflation.

Real and Nominal Interest Rates
Even if you deposit $100 in a bank account and get $105 at the end of the year, if the 
economy’s annual rate of inflation amounts to 5 percent or more, your purchasing 
power would not have increased at all. In other words, the 5 percent inflation will eat 
up all your 5 percent earnings. This is an example of the real-nominal principle.

What matters to people is the real value of money or income—the 
purchasing power—not the face value of money.

Up to this point, we have discussed “the” interest rate. However, at any point in 
time, there are really many different interest rates. One reason is that loans vary by 
their riskiness and by their maturity (the length of the loan). Riskier loans and loans 
for longer maturities typically have higher interest rates.

The Value of an Annuity
Applying the Concepts #2: How can understanding the concept of present  
value help us evaluate an annuity?
The first step in making this decision would be to calcu-
late the present value of the annuity payments and compare 
it to the $500,000. Of course, you do not know for sure how 
long you would live, so you would need some estimates of 
the probability of surviving at each age into the future. You 
would multiply that probability by the yearly annuity payment 
to obtain an expected annuity payment for every future year. 
Finally, you would need to choose an interest rate and calcu-
late the expected present value of the annuity payments and 
compare it to the $500,000.
Hopefully, your firm offered you a well-priced annuity. But 
the decision is still yours. The annuity would be a better deal 
for you if you were healthier than average and expected to live 
longer than the average person. It could also bring you peace 
of mind if you were concerned about your skills in managing 
money or worried about outliving your money. On the other 
hand, if you had poor health, it would not be a good idea. Many 
financial advisers suggest that annuities should play at least 
some role in retirement planning.  Related to Exercise 2.6.
Suppose you and your employer both had set aside funds for the 
day you retire at age 65. Just before you retire, your employer 
offers you the following options: (1) You can have the $500,000 
that was set aside for you, or (2) the firm would take the $500,000 
and purchase you an annuity contract—a financial instrument that 
would pay you a fixed annual payment as long as you live. Your 
employer tells you the annuity contract the firm could purchase 
would pay $35,000 per year. Which option should you choose?

that are good credit risks), 10-year U.S. Treasury bonds (loans to the government for 
10 years), and 6-month treasuries (loans to the U.S. government for 6 months).
Notice that rates for corporate bonds are higher than rates for 10-year Trea-
sury bonds. The reason is that corporations are less likely to pay back their loans 
than the U.S. government. Notice, too, that for most of this time period, the U.S. 
government typically paid a lower rate when it borrowed for shorter periods of time 
(6 months) than for longer periods of time (10 years). That is the normal pattern. 
However, in 2006 and 2007, it became cheaper for the government to borrow for 
the longer period.
Understanding Investment Decisions
Now that we understand the concept of present value and interest rates, we can use 
these tools to understand investment decisions. Consider a project we have to pay for 
today in order to benefit in the future. Here is the simple investment rule for such a 
project: Invest in a project if the cost you incur today is less than or equal to the present value 
of the future payments from the project.
In our first present-value example, the “project” (the loan to your friend) pays $105 
in 1 year, and the present value (with an interest rate of 5 percent) is $100. Because the 
cost of the project is also $100, the project is worthwhile.
Consider a more complicated project that pays $110 in year 1 and in year 2. The 
interest rate is 10 percent. The present value of the benefits from this project is
present value =
$110
(1 + 0.10) +
$110
(1.10)2 = $191
As long as the cost of the project today is less than $191, it pays to invest in it.
We can use our theory to develop the relationship between investment spending 
and the real rate of interest in the economy. In the economy as a whole, millions of 
different investment projects can be undertaken, nearly all providing different returns. 
Consider the array of investments A through E in Table 12.1. Each project costs $100 
in the current period and provides a return one period later. The returns are expressed 
in real terms; that is, they have been adjusted for inflation.

Table 12.1  Return on Investment by Project
Let’s look at the present value of these investments at various interest rates. At an 
interest rate of 2 percent per year, only investment A is unprofitable. For the other 
investments, the present value of the return exceeds the cost. If the interest rate in the 
market increases to 4 percent, both A and B will be unprofitable. At an interest rate of 
6 percent, A, B, and C will be unprofitable; D will be unprofitable as well if the market 
interest rate increases to 8 percent. If the interest rate exceeds 9 percent, all the invest-
ments will be unprofitable.
As interest rates rise, there will be fewer profitable investments in which firms are 
willing to invest, and the total level of investment spending in the economy will decline. 
Figure 12.3 depicts the negative relationship, graphically represented as the downward-
sloping line, between real interest rates and investment. As the graph indicates, high 
real interest rates will deter investment spending. As an example, during the early 1980s 
when real interest rates rose, business investment dropped sharply.

part 4
288
In practice, firms need to take into account other factors besides interest rates in 
making their investment decisions. In the neoclassical theory of investment, 
­pioneered by Dale Jorgenson of Harvard University, taxes along with real interest 
rates play a key role in determining investment spending. Jorgenson used his theory 
to analyze how investors respond to a variety of tax incentives, including investment 
tax credits.
Should we use a real or nominal interest rate to determine whether to invest? 
The answer is that it doesn’t really matter, as long as we are consistent. If the future 
benefits of the project are not adjusted for inflation, then we should use the nominal 
interest rate because it takes into account overall inflation—inflation is built into 
the nominal rate, so to speak. But if we first express the future benefits of the invest-
ment in current dollars—that is, if we reduce their nominal value by the amount that 
prices in the economy are expected to increase—then we should use the real rate of 
interest in our calculations.
Keep this distinction between real and nominal interest rates in mind. If ­nominal 
interest rates are 10 percent but inflation is 9 percent, the real rate of interest is only 
1 percent. A firm makes its investment decisions by comparing its expected real net 
return from investment projects to the real rate of interest. Just because nominal 
­interest rates are high does not mean the real interest rate is also high.
During the 1970s, homeowners in California understood this. They purchased 
homes in record numbers, even though it meant borrowing money at interest rates 
exceeding 10 percent. Buyers were willing to borrow at such high rates because hous-
ing prices in California had been rising by more than 10 percent annually, and they 
believed the trend would continue. They realized, for example, that if housing prices 
rose by 12 percent per year, they were essentially earning a 2 percent annual return 
because their mortgage loans were just 10 percent. (They would earn the returns only 
when they sold their homes.) That would make the real interest rate of the money bor-
rowed -2 percent. This caused a housing boom in California that lasted until housing 
prices stopped rising at such high rates.
Investment and the Stock Market
Economists have long noticed a correlation between the stock market and investment 
spending. All other things being equal, when the level of the stock market is high, 
investment spending also tends to be high. It makes sense that the two are related. 
Consider a firm’s options when it wants to finance a new project. The firm really has

three choices: First, it can rely on its retained earnings—the earnings the firm hasn’t 
paid out in dividends to its owners. Second, it can borrow funds from a bank or sell 
corporate bonds to the public. Third, it can issue and sell new shares, or stock. When 
a firm’s stock price is high, it can issue shares at a premium and use the proceeds from 
their sale to finance new investments. The higher the share price, the fewer shares the 
firm needs to sell to raise capital. This means, essentially, that the cost of the project 
the firm wants to undertake falls as the company’s stock price climbs. In other words, 
high stock prices lead to high investment. This is known as the Q-theory of ­investment, 
and it was originally developed by the late Nobel Laureate James Tobin of Yale 
­University. In the boom of the late 1990s when the level of the stock market was high 
along with share prices, many firms financed large investments by selling their shares.
During roughly this same time period, the stock market and investment spending 
appeared to be even more tightly linked than in the past. Figure 12.4 plots the Standard 
and Poor’s index of stock prices on the same graph as the share of investment spending 
as a component of GDP from 1990 to 2013. Looking at a historical example, both the 
stock market and investment spending rose sharply from 1997, peaking in mid-2000. 
They then both fell sharply—the stock market plunged, investment spending fell, and 
the economy entered a recession. This is a typical pattern.

The reason the two were so tightly linked in 1997–2000 was that investors were 
overly optimistic about the future. They believed that, driven by new technology, the 
newfound economic prosperity would last forever (or at least certainly longer than it 
did). With optimistic expectations about the future, stock prices should have been high 
because stock prices are based on the present value of the dividends people expect firms 
to pay in the future:
price of a stock = present value of expected future dividend payments
Because investors’ expectations about future dividends were high, stock prices were 
high. Firms, like individual investors, rushed to make massive, long-term investments, 
particularly in the fiber-optics and telecommunications industries. Some observers 
questioned whether the expectations were rational. Still, there were enough optimistic 
investors to sufficiently drive up prices. In many cases, stock prices for companies that 
had never turned a profit nonetheless soared to astronomical heights.

Unfortunately, both investors and firms may have been subject to what former 
Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan famously dubbed “irrational exuberance”—
something similar to Keynes’s “animal spirits.” Although the economy had performed 
very well in the late 1990s, it could not grow at those rates forever. Many investors 
and firms believed it could, though. When they began to realize it couldn’t, the stock 
market plunged and investment plans were curtailed. What linked the stock market 
and investment in both their rise and their fall were first optimistic and then pessimistic 
expectations about the economy. Rather than causing the rise and fall of investment 
spending, the stock market mirrored expectations about the economy held by firms 
and individual investors.
How Financial Intermediaries Facilitate Investment
Households save and invest their funds for different reasons than firms. A typical couple 
might be saving money for their retirement or for their children’s education, and they 
generally won’t like the idea of their savings being subject to risk. They do, however, 
want their savings to be readily accessible and convertible to money—what economists 
call liquid—in case they have a financial emergency. Funds deposited in a bank account, 
for example, provide a source of liquidity for households because they can be withdrawn 
at any time.
Unlike households, firms and business managers are typically risk-takers. They 
are gambling that their vision of the future will come true and make them vast profits. 
These investors need funds they can tie up for long periods of time. For example, an 
entrepreneur who wants to build a skyscraper or casino may need financing for several

Underwater Homeowners and Debt Forgiveness
Applying the Concepts #3: Should we have done more to assist homeowners

that in the aftermath of the Great Recession, the speed of 
­economic recovery depended critically on providing assistance 
to underwater homeowners. Using detailed data, they found that 
in the face of housing price declines, those households with the 
largest debt burdens cut their spending more than households 
with lower debt burdens by a factor of almost three to one. By 
not providing sufficient assistance to those homeowners, total 
consumption spending was substantially reduced in the econ-
omy and the recession was prolonged. Rather than focusing so 
much attention on saving the banks, policymakers should have 
focused much more attention on homeowners.
Policymakers did try a variety of programs to assist home-
owners, but they proved to be controversial and difficult to 
administer. Many people objected to helping those who had 
borrowed too much and worried about what would happen in 
the future if debts were routinely forgiven. Nonetheless, Mian 
and Sufi argue that this reluctance came at a severe cost to the 
U.S. economy.  Related to Exercise 4.5.

­Financial Rescue,” New York Times, May 16, 2014, and Atif Mian and Amir Sufi,

During the housing boom, many homeowners borrowed money 
to purchase their property but then saw the value of their homes 
fall sharply. As a consequence, in 2012 approximately 12 ­million 
U.S. homeowners owed more on their home mortgages than 
their home was actually worth. These homeowners are com-
monly known as being “underwater.” While the majority of 
underwater homeowners were making their mortgage payments 
on time, a significant minority were delinquent on their payments 
and on a path to defaulting on their mortgages. Should we have 
tried to help them more?

Chicago economist Amir Sufi have provided strong evidence

years before beginning construction and for years afterward until the business begins 
to produce profits.
Suppose individual entrepreneurs had to obtain funds directly from individual 
savers. First, they would have to negotiate with thousands of people to obtain suffi-
cient funds. This would take a lot of time and be costly. Second, the savers would face 
extraordinarily high risks if they loaned all their money to a single entrepreneur who 
had a risky project to undertake. Not only would all their funds be tied up in a single 
project, it would not be easy to monitor the investor’s decisions. How could they be 
certain the entrepreneur wouldn’t run off with their money? Additionally, their invest-
ments would not be liquid. To compensate these savers for the risk they would be 
taking and the lack of liquidity they would face, entrepreneurs would have to pay them 
extremely high interest rates, but higher interest rates would make it harder, perhaps 
impossible, for the entrepreneur to make a profit. No prospect of profits would mean 
no one would invest in the project in the first place. In other words, society would not 
be able to turn its savings into profitable investment projects. Figure 12.5 depicts this 
dilemma. How can the problem be solved?

The answer is through financial intermediaries. Financial intermediaries include 
banks, savings and loans, insurance companies, brokerage firms, companies that run 
mutual funds, and other types of financial institutions. These institutions accept funds 
from savers and make loans to businesses and individuals. For example, a local bank 
accepts deposits from savers and uses the funds to make loans to local businesses. 
­Savings and loan institutions will accept deposits in savings accounts and use these 
funds to make loans, often for housing. Insurance companies accept premium payments 
from individuals in exchange for the protection provided by the insurance payments. 
Then insurance companies lend the premiums received to earn returns from ­investments 
so they can pay off the insurance claims of individuals. Figure 12.6 shows how financial 
intermediaries create a valuable link between savers and investors. Pooling the funds 
of savers to make loans to individual borrowers reduces the costs of negotiation. 
­Financial institutions also have more expertise to evaluate and monitor investments 
than most individual investors.
To some degree, these financial intermediaries also provide liquidity. In normal 
circumstances, not all households withdraw their money at the same time, so financial 
intermediaries can lend out most of the money and still have enough on hand to meet 
withdrawals by depositors.
But how do financial intermediaries reduce risk? They do this by diversifying inves-
tors’ assets—by not putting “all the eggs in one basket,” so to speak. ­Intermediaries 
invest (that is, make loans) in a large number of projects whose returns, although 
­uncertain, are independent of one another. By independent, we mean the return from 
one investment is unrelated to the return on another investment. Consider a bank 
investing in a large number of projects that all together produce an average return

of 8 percent annually. Each project alone is risky and could pay a return either higher 
or lower than 8 percent. However, as long as the returns on all these projects are inde-
pendent of one another, those with higher returns will likely offset those with lower 
returns. By investing in a large number of projects, the bank increases the odds that as 
a group the projects will earn 8 percent.
Other financial intermediaries reduce risks in related ways. A fire insurance com-
pany accepts premiums from many individuals in communities throughout the country 
and uses the funds to make investments. Because not all houses will burn down in the 
same year, the insurance company knows it will have a stable source of funds for its 
investments. Insurance diversification works well only when companies insure events 
that are independent of one another, however. Some situations are not independent 
and therefore can’t easily be insured by the same company. For example, an insurance 
­company would be unwise to provide earthquake insurance for just the Los ­Angeles 
area. If an earthquake did occur, the firm would be faced with making payments to 
many clients who suffered loss without anyone else’s payments to offset them. In some-
what the same way, even bank loans are not fully independent. During a recession, 
many more firms will experience financial difficulties and have trouble meeting their 
loan obligations to their banks.
In recent years, we have seen an innovation in financial intermediation. In the past, 
if a savings and loan company made a loan to a home purchaser, it would hold onto the 
loan until it was paid off. That meant the savings and loan could make new loans or 
mortgages only if it was able to attract new deposits to provide the funds.
Two large government-sponsored financial intermediaries, Fannie Mae and 
­Freddie Mac, changed the way mortgage markets operated. They purchased ­mortgages 
from savings and loans and banks throughout the country, packaged them, and sold 
them to investors in the financial market. This enabled savings and loans to offer addi-
tional mortgages with the funds they received from Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, and 
it allowed investors to own a part of a diversified collection of mortgages from around 
the country. The private sector quickly adopted these practices as well.
The practice of purchasing loans, repackaging them, and selling them to the finan-
cial markets is known as securitization. Although it started with home mortgages, 
securitization now applies to other types of financial obligations, such as credit card and 
consumer debt. Financial intermediaries will often borrow money from financial ­markets 
to purchase loans in order to repackage and sell them. Using borrowed funds to purchase 
assets is known as leverage. Increases in leverage increase the risk that financial 
­intermediaries undertake because they are obligated to pay off the funds they have 
­borrowed, regardless of the actual performance of the assets they have purchased.

When Financial Intermediaries Malfunction
Financial intermediation can sometimes go wrong. When it does, the economy suffers. 
Important examples of the failure of financial intermediation include commercial bank 
failures during the Great Depression, the U.S. savings and loan crisis of the 1980s, a 
similar crisis in Japan in the 1990s, and the U.S. housing credit and securitization crisis 
of 2007 and 2008.
In the early days of the Great Depression, many banks in the United States, par-
ticularly in rural areas, provided farmers and local businesses with loans that turned out 
to be unprofitable. This worried depositors, and rumors circulated that banks would 
fail. Depositors panicked, and many tried to withdraw their money simultaneously in 
what is called a bank run. During the Great Depression, bank runs occurred through-
out the world. In 1931, a panic broke out after the collapse of Creditanstalt, Austria’s 
largest bank. Banking panics occurred throughout other countries in Europe, including 
Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, and Poland.
Few banks, profitable or unprofitable, can survive a run because not all deposits 
are kept on hand. The result of the bank runs was that thousands of healthy U.S. 
banks shut down, leaving large parts of the United States without a banking system. 
Many farms and businesses could no longer find a source of loans, and the severity of 
the Great Depression worsened. Studies have shown that the countries with the most 
severe banking panics were hardest hit by the Depression.
To prevent banking panics from happening again, in 1933 the U.S. government 
began providing deposit insurance on money placed in banks and savings and loans. 
Today deposit insurance guarantees the government will reimburse depositors for 
amounts up to $250,000 in each account at each bank should their banks fail. Because 
everyone knows their deposits are secure, bank runs no longer regularly occur. Today, 
most countries have some form of deposit insurance intended to prevent panics.
Ironically, deposit insurance indirectly led to the U.S. savings and loan crisis, which 
occurred during the 1980s. In the early 1970s, savings and loan institutions (S&Ls) 
made mortgage loans to households at low interest rates. However, later in the decade 
nominal interest rates rose sharply as inflation increased. The savings and loans were 
in trouble: They had to pay high interest rates to attract deposits, but they were earn-
ing interest at low rates from the money they had loaned out previously. Many of the 
S&Ls failed.
The government tried to assist the savings and loan industry by broadening the 
range of investments the industry could make. Some S&Ls soon began aggressively 
investing in speculative real estate and other risky projects to earn higher returns. 
Depositors weren’t worried, though, because they knew their savings were insured by 
the government. Unfortunately, many of these risky projects failed, and the govern-
ment was forced to bail out the S&Ls at a cost of nearly $100 billion to ­taxpayers. 
Because depositors’ savings were insured, most people didn’t suffer directly from the 
collapse of their savings and loan institutions. As taxpayers they suffered, though, 
because they had to foot the bill.
Japan suffered similar problems in the 1990s. By 1995, seven of the eight largest 
Japanese mortgage lenders had gone bankrupt following a crash in real estate prices. 
Like the U.S. government, the Japanese government also used taxpayers’ funds to bail 
these lenders out.
The decline in housing prices that we described in the chapter-opening story trig-
gered a severe crisis in the newly developed securitization markets. Although the actual 
details are complex, the basic story is simple. Lenders had made loans to borrowers who 
had limited ability to repay, and when borrowers began to miss payments or default on 
their loans, it caused major disruptions in the market for securitized loans, which, in 
turn, disrupted credit to other sectors in the economy, causing a massive disruption to 
financial markets. Even Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac fell victim to the housing decline 
and were placed under direct government control in September 2008.
As the housing-generated financial crisis spread to the rest of the financial markets, 
the credit markets essentially “froze” and banks worldwide would no longer lend to

each other. Customers scrambled to withdraw their funds in financial institutions that 
they perceived were weak, leading to a “run” on these institutions. As a result, financial 
institutions such as Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers were forced to close and insti-
tutions such as Merrill Lynch and Wachovia Bank were taken over by other financial 
institutions. When the financial institution Lehman Brothers failed, it set off a panic 
in the markets that spread to other international banks and financial institutions. The 
stock market plunged dramatically worldwide, reflecting the severity of the crisis and 
fear that it would lead to a total worldwide financial collapse. As credit became unavail-
able, businesses began to suffer as well, as they were not able to borrow funds to run 
their enterprises on a day-to-day basis. State and local government also found it nearly 
impossible to borrow at the height of the crisis.
Governments around the world took a number of steps to alleviate this crisis. 
Central banks, whose activities during the crisis are described in more detail in the next 
chapter, provided loans and credit through a wide variety of channels. After consider-
able turmoil, the U.S. Congress passed a bailout package, called the Troubled Asset 
Relief Program, or TARP, that enabled the Treasury to use up to $700 billion to shore 
up the financial system. Following the lead of Great Britain, the U.S. Treasury used 
some of these proceeds to provide funds to large banks in order to restore confidence in 
the financial system and took limited ownership in these banks. As previously noted, the 
government took control of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and also provided funding 
to some large financial firms, such as the American International Group (AIG), which 
provided financial insurance to other firms and was deemed essential to keep afloat dur-
ing the crisis. The United States and other countries around the world also increased 
the limits on the amounts eligible for deposit insurance to bolster consumer confidence 
in banking institutions. The U.S. Congress also enacted the Dodd-Frank legislation, 
which added a new set of regulatory tools. Similar actions were taken by other large 
governments around the world. The goals of all these actions were to restore confi-
dence in a system of financial intermediation that was under considerable stress.

Securitization: The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly
Applying the Concepts #4: How have recent financial innovations created new risks for the economy?
loans. Some households were willing to take on considerable 
debt because they were confident they could make money in a 
rising housing market. Lenders securitized the subprime loans 
and financial firms offered exotic investment securities to inves-
tors based on these loans. Many financial institutions purchased 
these securities without really knowing what was inside them. 
Because the securities were so new, the agencies that tradition-
ally evaluated the riskiness of these investments did not post 
sufficient warning.
When the housing boom stopped and borrowers stopped 
making payments on subprime loans, it created panic in the 
financial market. Not only did investors and financial firms now 
realize their investments were extremely risky, they began to 
worry about the creditworthiness of banks and other financial 
intermediaries that held these securities as assets. Many were 
highly leveraged and exposed to great risk. Effectively, through 
securitization the damage from the subprime loans spread to 
the entire financial market, causing a major crisis.  Related to 
Exercise 4.7.
As securitization developed, it allowed financial intermediaries 
to provide new funds for borrowers to enter the housing market. 
This led to a rise in the rate of homeownership and was hailed 
as a positive development. But there was a dark side to this 
process as well.
As the housing boom began in 2002, lenders and home 
purchasers began to take increasing risks. Lenders made “sub-
prime” loans to borrowers with limited ability to actually repay 
their mortgages and did not exercise full diligence in making

From these examples you can see why financial intermediation does not always 
work. There is a continual debate on the role government should play in investment 
decisions for the economy and its role in regulating financial intermediaries. Today, 
some economists and policymakers are carefully reassessing the risks in our complex 
financial markets.
In this chapter we dis-
cussed investment spend-
ing, present value, interest 
rates, and financial inter-
mediaries. We saw that 
investment spending is 
volatile, rising and falling 
sharply with real GDP, and 
depends on expectations 
about the future. By developing the concept of present value, we 
saw how firms can make investment decisions when the costs and 
benefits of an investment occur at different times. We also explained 
why investment spending also depends inversely on real interest 
rates and explained the distinction between real and nominal inter-
est rates. Finally, we examined how financial intermediaries channel 
funds from savers to investors, reduce interest rates, and promote 
investment—and sometimes malfunction. Here are the main points 
to keep in mind:
1.	 Investments incur costs today but provide benefits in the future.
2.	 Investment spending is a volatile component of GDP because 
expectations about the future are uncertain and ever changing.
3.	 We use the concept of present value to compare the costs and 
benefits of investments that occur at different points in time. The 
present value of a payment K, t years in the future, at an interest 
rate of i is
present value =
K
(1 + i)t
4.	 The real interest rate equals the nominal interest rate minus 
inflation.
5.	 Investment spending depends inversely on real interest rates.
6.	 Financial intermediaries reduce the risk and costs of making 
investments by pooling the funds of savers and monitoring 
the projects of borrowers. Financial intermediaries can pack-
age loans for sale to the broader financial markets through 
securitization.
7.	 While financial intermediaries do make the economy more effi-
cient, they can break down at times, causing severe economic 
disruptions.

An Investment: A Plunge into the Unknown
Explain why investment spending is a volatile component 
of GDP.
1.1	 Investment is a larger component of GDP than 
­consumption, but it is much more volatile. _________ 
(True/False)
1.2	 Investment spending is very _________, since it moves 
in conjunction with GDP.
1.3	 Keynes states that optimism and pessimism related to 
_________ were often irrational.
1.4	 Since investment spending rises and falls with GDP, it 
is _________.
1.5	 Explaining the Name of the Theory. See if you can 
explain both terms in the name of the “multiplier-
accelerator” theory. What is meant by the accelerator? 
What is the multiplier?
1.6	 Index of Consumer Confidence and Investment in 
Durable Goods. Using the ideas of “animal spirits,” 
explain why changes in measures of consumer confi-
dence would be correlated to consumer spending on 
durable goods.
1.7	 Residential Housing Investment, Before and After 
the Last Two Recessions. Use the Web site for the 
Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis (www.research 
.stlouisfed.org/fred2) to find out how investment in 
residential housing behaved during the periods brack-
eting the two most recent recessions. Compare the 
periods 1997–2001 and 2006–2011.
1.8	 Clean Energy and Investment Spending. Suppose 
an American company wants to invest in energy-­saving 
technologies to reduce spending in the long term. 
Comment on this investment decision considering that 
energy prices fell as oil prices fell below $50 in 2008. 
(Related to Application 1 on page 282.)
Evaluating the Future
Discuss the concept of present value.
2.1	 If the interest rate is 25 percent, the present value of 
$500 paid 2 years from now equals _________.
2.2	 If the interest rate is 10 percent, the present value of 
$300 paid 1 year from now equals _________. If the 
$300 is received in 5 years, the present value will equal 
_________.
2.3	 The present value of a fixed payment decreases when 
interest rates _________ (increase/decrease).
2.4	 The present value of bonds paid over a 10-year period 
will _________ (rise/fall) with a fall in interest rates.
2.5	 Investments in Solar Energy. Proponents of solar 
energy point to the vast savings that come in the long 
run from using a free source of energy (the sun) rather 
than paying high prices for electricity. Unfortunately, 
solar energy systems typically have large up-front 
expenses to install the system. Use the concept of pres-
ent value to show that solar energy systems are more 
likely to be profitable when interest rates are low.
2.6	 Annuity Payments and Interest Rates. Suppose you 
have $500,000 to purchase an annuity. Currently the 
annuity payments are $35,000 per year as long as you 
live. What do you think would happen to the annuity 
payments if interest rates increased? Explain carefully. 
(Related to Application 2 on page 286.)
2.7	 Present Value of Inheritance. You have just inherited 
a large sum and will be paid $200,000 per year for 10 
years (starting in year 1). What is the present value of 
this sum at an interest rate of 4 percent? You can do this 
by hand (not recommended) or in an Excel spreadsheet. 
Here is how: enter “2” in cells A1 through A10. In cell 
C3, enter @NPV(.04, A1:A10) and press enter and you 
will have the result. What happens to the present value 
of your inheritance if the interest rate rises to 6 percent? 
What will happen if the interest rate falls to 3 percent?
2.8	 Payments for Medical Bills. You were in a car acci-
dent and have to pay the injured party $20,000 for 
treatment. You offer to pay them $5,000 a year for 4 
years. They agree to spreading your payments over 
time, but only if you pay $5,200 a year for 4 years. 
Why did they make this counteroffer?
Understanding Investment Decisions
Describe the role of interest rates in making investment 
decisions.
3.1	 If a project costs $100 and pays $105 in year 1 and $110 
in year 2, the maximum interest rate at which the pres-
ent value of investment exceeds its cost is _________.
3.2	 As real interest rates rise, investment spending in the 
economy _________.
3.3	 Corporate bonds, retained earnings, and issuing stock 
are the three sources of funds that firms have for invest-
ments. _________ (True/False)
3.4	 The Q-theory of investment was developed by 
_________.
All problems are assignable in MyLab Economics. 

297
3.5	 The price of a stock can be thought of as the present 
value of future _________.
3.6	 Low Interest Rates but No Takers. In 2010, interest 
rates on home mortgages were in the neighborhood of 
5 percent—very low by historical standards—but many 
individuals did not wish to buy homes. Using the con-
cept of the real interest rate, can you explain why low 
interest rates did not entice new buyers?
3.7	 Stock Prices, Investment, and Causation. Figure 
12.4 shows that from 1990 through 2013, investment 
spending followed the same trends as stock prices. 
Does this mean that movements in stock prices cause 
movements in investment spending? Give an alterna-
tive explanation for the fact that they move together. 
(Hint: Think of movements in real GDP.)
3.8	 Hydroelectric Dams. Hydroelectric dams are very 
costly to build and construct, but there are considerable 
savings in operating costs compared to other energy 
alternatives. Explain why hydroelectric dams are more 
likely to be profitable when interest rates are low.
3.9	 Stock Prices, Interest Rates, and Corporate Earn-
ings. Holding other factors constant, explain why stock 
prices tend to rise when
a.	 interest rates fall.
b.	expected corporate earnings rise.
How Financial Intermediaries Facilitate Investment
List the ways that financial intermediaries can facilitate 
investment.
4.1	 An illiquid financial asset is one that can easily be used 
to buy goods and services. _________ (True/False)
4.2	 Creation of _________ following the Great Depres-
sion has greatly reduced the likelihood of runs on banks 
today.
4.3	 Securitization refers to investors withdrawing funds 
from a bank they believe would fail. _________ (True/
False)
4.4	 If a financial intermediary buys loans from a mortgage 
company and then packages them to sell in the financial 
markets, this is known as _________.
4.5	 Debt Forgiveness and Two Underwater House-
holds. Two households both have loans on their homes 
that are “underwater.” Household A has other assets 
such as checking accounts, but Household B does 
not. What does the research show about the effects of 
reducing the amount each household owes on its loans 
on the spending by the two households? (Related to 
Application 3 on p. 290.)
4.6	 A Leverage Example. Suppose you purchased an asset 
for $5,000. The asset is risky and can either increase in 
value to $5,400 or decrease in value to $4,800. Let us 
look at the effects of leverage on your returns to this 
investment.
a.	 Suppose you did not borrow any money, but put in 
your own $5,000 to purchase the asset. What per-
cent gain would you experience if the asset increased 
in value to $5,400? What percent loss would you 
experience if the asset value decreased to $4,800?
b.	Now, suppose you borrowed $4,500 to purchase the 
asset. What is your percentage gain or loss on the 
investment now?
4.7	 “Ninja” Loans. During the housing boom, overeager 
lenders were said to have made “ninja” loans—that is, 
loans to individuals with “no income, job, or assets.” 
How did ninja loans contribute to the securitization 
crisis in financial markets in 2007 and 2008? (Related 
to Application 4 on page 294.)
4.8	 Savings and Loans and Risk. Traditionally, savings 
and loan institutions made loans only for home mort-
gages and held on to those mortgages. At one point, this 
was viewed as a safe way of doing business. ­However, it 
became a risky way of doing business for U.S. savings 
and loans in the 1970s. Explain why making loans only 
for housing and holding on to the mortgages may be 
very risky. Why does this risk provide a rationale for 
securitization?
4.9	 Invest Your Pension in Your Own Company? 
Explain why it is bad financial planning to invest your 
pension in the stock of your own company.
Diversification
This classroom exercise illustrates the power of diversifi-
cation. Your instructor will describe the game and how to 
participate. To take part in this exercise, you need to recall 
a simple lesson from basic statistics: If you flip a coin many 
times, the fraction of heads that results approaches one-half 
as you increase the number of flips. You are offered a chance 
Ec onom ic Experiment
to play this game in which you receive a payoff according to 
the following formula:
Payoff = $10 + $100 [(number of heads/
number of tosses) - 0.5]

298
In this game, you first get $10, but you win or lose addi-
tional funds, depending on whether the fraction of heads that 
comes up exceeds one-half. To help you understand what’s 
going on in this game, suppose you toss the coin only once. 
Here, the outcome depends only on whether the coin comes 
up either heads or tails:
 Heads:$10 + $100(1/1 - 0.5) = $60
 Tails:$10 + $100(0/1 - 0.5) = -$40
The game does have a positive expected payoff. The expected 
or average payoff for this game is the probability of getting 
a head (one-half) times $60 plus the probability of getting a 
tail (one-half) times -$40. This is
Expected payoff = (0.5)$60 + (0.5)(-$40) = $10
On average, if you toss the coin many times, this game would 
pay $10. But this game is risky if you are allowed to toss the 
coin only once. Now that you understand the game, answer 
the following question: Would you play this game if limited 
to only one toss? Now suppose you were free to toss the coin 
1,000 times and received 450 heads. If that happened, your 
payoff would be
$10 + $100(450/1000 - 0.5) = $5
Would you play if you could toss the coin 1,000 times?
Questions for Discussion
1.	 Did a higher percentage of the class agree to play the game 
with 1,000 tosses? How does this illustrate the principle of 
­diversification?
2.	 If you toss the coin 1,000 times, what is the expected payoff?
3.	 If you toss the coin 1,000 times and receive heads fewer than 
400 times, you will lose money. What do you think is the prob-
ability of this occurring?

Normally we expect 
­governments to prevent the 
wholesale failures of banks.
But during the recent financial crisis, the country of 
Iceland took the opposite approach and let the major 
banks in the country simply collapse.
Beginning in 2003, the three major banks in 
Iceland changed their business model to become 
aggressive international banking institutions, attract-
ing deposits from foreign countries and vastly 
expanding their portfolio of loans. The result was 
5 years of incredible prosperity for the country and 
its bank. Unfortunately, when the world financial 
­crisis hit in 2008, this financing model no longer 
was ­sustainable. Funds quickly disappeared from 
the banks and the government and the people of 
Iceland faced a stark choice: bail out the banks by 
using public funds or let the banks go bankrupt and 
let those who invested in the banks take losses.
Eventually, Iceland decided on the bankruptcy 
route, much to the dismay of investors abroad. Unlike 
Ireland, which faced a similar situation, the govern-
ment and the people of Iceland were willing to let the 
banks fail. Although this caused a severe recession 
for Iceland, the longer-run prospects for the economy 
are sound and Iceland has actually recovered faster 
than many of the countries that bailed out its banks.

T
he term money has a special meaning for economists, so in this chapter we 
look carefully at how money is defined and the role it plays in the economy. 
The overall level of money affects the performance of an economy. In a prior 
­chapter, we learned that increases in the money supply increase aggregate demand. In 
the short run, when prices are largely fixed, this increase will raise total demand and 
output. But in the long run, continuing money growth leads to inflation.
Our nation’s central bank, the Federal Reserve (commonly called the “Fed”), is 
responsible for controlling the money supply. In this chapter, we see how the Federal 
Reserve is structured, how it operates, and why it’s so powerful.
What Is Money?
Economists define money as any items that are regularly used in economic transactions 
or exchanges and accepted by buyers and sellers. Let’s consider some examples of 
money used in that way.
We use money regularly every day. In a coffee shop, we hand the person behind 
the counter some dollar bills and coins, and we receive a cup of coffee. This is an 
example of an economic exchange: One party hands over currency—the dollar bills 
and the coins—and the other party hands over goods and services—the coffee. Why 
do the owners of coffee shops accept dollar bills and coins in payment for coffee? The 
reason is that they will be making other economic exchanges with the dollar bills and 
coins they accept. Suppose a cup of coffee costs $1.50 and 100 cups are sold in a day. 
The seller then has $150 in currency. If the coffee costs the seller $100, the seller pays 
$100 of the currency received and keeps $50 for other expenses and profits. Money 
makes that possible.
In the real world, transactions are somewhat more complicated. The coffee shop 
owners take the currency they receive each day, deposit it in bank accounts, and then 
pay suppliers with checks drawn on those accounts. Clearly, currency is money because 
it is used to purchase coffee. Checks also function as money because they are used to 
pay suppliers. In some ancient cultures, precious stones were used in exchanges. In 
more recent times, gold bars have served as money. During World War II, prisoners 
of war did not have currency, but they did have rations of cigarettes, so they used them 
like money, trading them for what they wanted.
Three Properties of Money
Regardless of what money is used in a particular society, it serves several functions, 
all related to making economic exchanges easier. Here we discuss three key properties 
of money.
Money Serves As A Medium Of Exchange  As our examples illustrate, 
money is given by buyers to sellers in economic exchanges; therefore, it serves as a 
medium of exchange. Suppose you had a car you wanted to sell in order to buy a 
boat and money did not exist. You could look for a person who had a boat and wanted 
to buy a car and then trade your car directly for a boat. This is an example of barter: 
the exchange of one good or service for another.
But there are obvious problems with barter. Suppose local boat owners were 
­interested in selling boats but not interested in buying your car. Unless there were a 
double coincidence of wants—that is, unless you wanted to trade a car for a boat, 
and the boat owner wanted to trade a boat for your car—this economic exchange 
wouldn’t occur. The probability of a double coincidence of wants occurring is very, 
very tiny. Even if a boat owner wanted a car, he or she might want a different type of 
car than yours.
By serving as a medium of exchange, money solves this bartering problem. The 
car owner can sell the car to anyone who wants it and receive money in return. With 
that money, the car owner can then find someone who owns a boat and purchase the

Chapter 13 • Money and the Banking System
301
Money allows individuals to actually make these exchanges. Without money, we 
would be left with a barter system, and most transactions that make both people better 
off would not be possible.
Money Serves As A Unit Of Account  Money also provides a convenient 
measuring rod when prices for all goods are quoted in money terms. A boat may be 
listed for sale at $5,000 in money terms, a car at $10,000, and a movie ticket at $5. We 
could, in principle, quote everything in terms of movie tickets. The boat would be 
worth 1,000 tickets, and the car would be worth 2,000 tickets. But because we are using 
money and not movie tickets as a medium of exchange, it is much easier to express all 
prices in terms of money. A unit of account is a standard unit in which we can state 
prices and compare the value of goods and services. In our economy, money is the unit 
of account because we quote all prices in terms of money. It is convenient to use the 
medium of exchange as the unit of account, so we can quote prices for all goods and 
services in terms of the same units we use in transactions—in our case, money.
Money Serves As A Store Of Value  If you sell your car to purchase a boat, 
you may not be able to purchase the boat immediately. In the meantime, you will be 
holding the money you received from the sale. Ideally, during that period, the value of 
the money will not fall. What we are referring to here is the function of money as a 
store of value.
Money is actually a somewhat imperfect store of value because of inflation. Sup-
pose inflation is 10 percent a year, which means average prices rise 10 percent each 
year. Let’s say you sold a tennis racket for $100 in order to buy 10 CDs worth $100, 
but you waited a year to buy them. Unfortunately, because of inflation, at the end of 
the year the 10 CDs cost $110 ($100 * 1.10), or $11 each. With your $100, you can 
now buy only 9 CDs and get $1 in change. Your money has lost some of its stored value.
As long as inflation is low and you do not hold the money for a long time, the loss 
in its purchasing power won’t be a big problem. But as inflation rates increase, money 
becomes less useful as a store of value.
Different Types Of Monetary Systems  Through history, the world has 
witnessed different types of monetary systems. In one system a commodity serves as 
money, such as gold or silver in bars or coins. This is an example of commodity 
money. At some point, governments began issuing paper money. However, the paper 
money was backed by an underlying commodity, for example, so many ounces of gold 
per unit of paper currency. Under a traditional gold standard, an individual could 
present paper money to the government and receive its stated value in gold. In other 
words, paper money could be exchanged for gold. Until 1933 in the United States, 
individuals could exchange their dollars for gold. However, President Franklin 
­Roosevelt banned private possession of gold in 1933, although foreign governments 
could still exchange dollars for gold until 1971. The next step in the evolution of mon-
etary systems was to break the tie between paper money and gold and create a system 
of fiat money. Fiat money has no intrinsic value like gold or silver—it is simply created 
by a government decree and becomes the official legal tender of the society. In the

stated and the value of goods and services 
can be compared.

boat for money. The boat owner can use the money in any way he or she pleases. With 
money, there is no need for a double coincidence of wants. This is why money exists 
in all societies: It makes economic transactions much easier.
Here is another way to think about this. One of our key principles of economics is 
that individuals are better off through voluntary exchange.
P r i n c i p l e  o f  V o l u n ta r y  E x c h a n g e
A voluntary exchange between two people makes both people 
better off.

part 5
302
United States today, if you take a $100 bill to the government you will not receive any 
gold or silver—just another $100 bill in return.
You may wonder what gives money value under a fiat system if it has no intrin-
sic value. The answer is that the government controls the value of fiat money by 
controlling its supply in the economy. That is why it is important to prevent coun-
terfeiting. In the next chapter, we see precisely how the government controls the 
supply of money.
Measuring Money in the U.S. Economy
In the United States and other modern economies, people can carry out economic 
transactions in several different ways. In practice, this leads to different measures of 
money. The most basic measure of money in the United States is called M1. It is the 
sum of currency in the hands of the public, demand deposits, other checkable deposits, 
and traveler’s checks. M1 totaled $2,220 billion in March 2012. Table 13.1 contains 
the components of M1 and their size; Figure 13.1 shows their relative percentages.
M1
The sum of currency in the hands of the 
public, demand deposits, other checkable 
deposits, and traveler’s checks.

checkable deposits are the next largest components.

Other checkable
deposits 17%
Demand deposits
40%
Traveler’s checks < 1%
Currency 43%
The first part of M1 is currency held by the public, that is, all currency held outside 
bank vaults. The second component is deposits in checking accounts, called demand 
deposits. Until the 1980s, checking accounts did not pay interest. The third component, 
other checkable deposits, was introduced in the early 1980s and did pay interest. Today, 
the distinction between the two types of deposit accounts is not as meaningful as it 
used to be because many checking accounts earn interest if the balances are sufficiently 
high. Finally, traveler’s checks are included in M1 because they are regularly used in 
economic exchanges.
Let’s take a closer look at the amount of currency in the economy. Because there 
are approximately 330 million people in the United States, the $1,272 billion of cur-
rency amounts to over $3,855 in currency for every man, woman, and child in the 
United States. Do you and your friends each have $3,855 of currency?

in the United States. Who is using and holding this currency? Some is used in illegal

Economists use different definitions of money because it is not always clear 
which assets are used primarily as money—that is, which assets are used for economic 
exchanges and which are used primarily for saving and investing. Money market mutual 
funds came into existence only in the late 1970s. Some people temporarily “park” their 
assets in these funds, anticipating they will move them into riskier, higher-earning 
stock market investments later. Others may use them to earn interest while avoiding 
the risks of the stock market or bond market. Sometimes, people use money market

Cash As A Sign Of Trust
Applying the Concepts #1: Why did Greek citizens start holding large amounts of cash in 2015?
is that the country would be forced to abandon its currency, 
the euro, and return to its old currency, the drachma, but at 
a much reduced value. They figured that if the country were 
forced to abandon the euro, the banks would convert their 
accounts to the drachma and they would suffer a large financial 
loss. In anticipation, Greeks began withdrawing euros from their 
bank accounts and just holding them everywhere—in drawers, 
in safes, and even under mattresses. The euros they withdrew 
could later be used throughout the rest of Europe and perhaps 
even eventually traded back for more local currency. It was not 
just households that were withdrawing funds—so were many 
small businesses. Holding cash in this case was a sign of lack 
of trust in the overall financial system.  Related to Exercise 1.9.

Cash, Just in Case,” Wall Street Journal, February 20, 2015, and Lorcan Roche

There are many reasons to hold some part of your wealth in 
cash. Sometimes this is just for convenience, when you are 
making small purchases and cannot use a debit or credit card. 
But in the case of Greece, increased holdings of cash occurred 
because of widespread fear of a major financial catastrophe.
In early 2015, Greek residents began withdrawing funds 
from their banks in order to hold cash. What the Greeks feared 
transactions such as the drug trade. Few drug dealers open bank accounts to deposit 
currency. In addition, a substantial fraction of U.S. currency is held abroad.
M1 does not include all the assets we use to make economic exchanges. M2 is a 
somewhat broader definition of money that includes M1 plus deposits in saving accounts, 
deposits in retail money market mutual funds, and time deposits of less than $100,000. 
These investment-type assets often can’t readily be used for exchanges without first 
being converted to M1. In February 2015 M2 totaled $11,819 billion. That’s about four 
times the total of M1. Figure 13.2 shows the relative sizes of the components of M2.

mutual funds like regular checking accounts or savings accounts. If money market 
mutual funds are used like checking accounts, they should be considered part of M1. 
If they are used like savings accounts, however, they should be part of M2. Economists 
keep an eye on both M1 and M2 because they don’t know precisely how people are 
using all these money market accounts.
Although consumers commonly use credit cards to make transactions in our econ-
omy, they are not part of the money supply. Here’s why: Suppose you have a credit card 
from the First Union Bank and purchase a new television from an electronics store. As 
you use your credit card, you are effectively borrowing the amount you charge from 
the First Union Bank, which, in turn, will pay the electronics store on your behalf. 
When you receive your credit card bill from the bank, you must begin to pay off the 
loan. Credit cards enable you to purchase goods now but pay for them at a later date. 
Unlike money, a credit card is not a medium of exchange, a unit of account, or a store 
of value. Credit cards do make it easier to conduct business, but they are not an official 
part of the money supply.
What about debit cards? If you own a debit card, you can use it to access the 
funds you have in your checking account when you make the transaction. When you 
use your debit card to make a purchase—say, at a supermarket—it is exactly the same 
thing as writing a check. Thus, a debit card is not an independent source of money. 
The money supply consists of the balances in checking accounts plus currency held 
by the public.
How Banks Create Money
In this section, we learn the role that banks play in the creation of money in a modern 
economy. To understand this role, we first have to look more carefully at the behavior 
of banks.
A Bank’s Balance Sheet: Where the Money Comes  
from and Where It Goes
A typical commercial bank accepts funds from savers in the form of deposits, for exam-
ple, in checking accounts. The bank does not leave all these funds idle because if it did 
it would never make a profit. Instead, the bank turns the money around and loans it 
out to borrowers. It will be easier to understand how banks create money if we first 
look at a simplified balance sheet for a commercial bank. The balance sheet will show 
us how the bank raises money and what it does with it.
Balance sheets have two sides: one for assets and one for liabilities. Liabilities are 
the source of funds for the bank. If you open a checking account and deposit your funds 
in it, the bank is liable for returning the funds to you when you want them. The bank 
must also pay you interest on the account if you keep enough money in it. Your deposits 
are therefore the bank’s liabilities. Assets, in contrast, generate income for the bank. 
Loans made by the bank are examples of its assets because borrowers must pay interest 
on the loans the bank collects.
When a bank is initially opened, its owners must place their own funds into it so 
it has some startup funds. We call these funds owners’ equity. If the bank subsequently 
makes a profit, owners’ equity increases; if it loses money, owners’ equity decreases.
In Figure 13.3, we show the assets and liabilities of a hypothetical bank. On the 
liability side, the bank has $2,000 of deposits, and owners’ equity is $200. Owners’ 
equity is entered on the liability side of the balance sheet because it is a source of the 
bank’s funds. The total source of funds is therefore $2,200—the deposits in the bank 
plus owners’ equity.
On the asset side, the bank holds $200 in reserves. These are assets that are not 
lent out. Reserves can be either cash kept in a bank’s vaults or deposits in the nation’s 
central bank, the Federal Reserve. Banks are required by law to hold a specific fraction 
of their deposits as reserves, called required reserves. If a bank chooses to hold

additional reserves beyond what is required, these are called excess reserves. A bank’s 
reserves are the sum of its required and excess reserves.
In our example, the bank is holding 10 percent of its deposits, or $200, as reserves. 
The remainder of the bank’s assets, $2,000, consists of the loans it has made. By con-
struction, total assets will always equal liabilities, including owners’ equity. Balance 
sheets must therefore always balance.
How Banks Create Money
To understand the role banks play in determining the supply of money, let’s suppose 
someone walks into the First Bank of Hollywood and deposits $1,000 in cash to open a 
checking account. Because currency held by the public and checking deposits are both 
included in the supply of money, the total money supply has not changed with this 
transaction. The cash deposited into the checking account reduced the currency held 
by the public by precisely the amount the checking account increased it.
Now let’s assume banks keep 10 percent of their deposits as reserves. That means the 
reserve ratio—the ratio of reserves to deposits—will be 0.1. The First Bank of Hollywood 
will keep $100 in reserves and make loans totaling $900. The top panel in Figure 13.4 
shows the change in the First Bank of Hollywood’s balance sheet after it has made its loan.
Suppose the First Bank of Hollywood loans the funds to an aspiring movie pro-
ducer. The producer opens a checking account at the First Bank of Hollywood with the 
$900 he borrowed. He then buys film equipment from a supplier, who accepts his $900 
check and deposits it in the Second Bank of Burbank. The next panel in Figure 13.4 
shows what happens to the balance sheet of the Second Bank of Burbank. Liabilities 
increase by the deposit of $900. The bank holds $90 in reserves (10 percent of the $900 
deposit) and can lend out $810.
Suppose the Second Bank of Burbank lends the $810 to the owner of a coffeehouse 
and she opens a checking account there with the $810 as her balance. She then pur-
chases $810 worth of coffee with a check made out to a coffee supplier, who deposits 
it into the Third Bank of Venice.
The Third Bank of Venice receives a deposit of $810. It keeps $81 in reserves and 
can lend out $729. This process continues throughout the Los Angeles area with new 
loans and deposits. The Fourth Bank of Pasadena will receive a deposit of $729, hold 
$72.90 in reserves, and lend out $656.10. The Fifth Bank of Compton will receive a 
deposit of $656.10, and the process goes on.
How the Money Multiplier Works
The original $1,000 cash deposit has created checking account balances throughout 
Los Angeles. What’s the total amount? Adding up the new accounts in all the banks 
(even the ones we have not named), we have
$1,000 + $900 + $810 + $729 + 656.10 + p = $10,000

The figure shows a hypothetical balance sheet for a bank holding 10 percent in required reserves, 
$200. Banks don’t earn interest on their reserves, so they will usually want to loan out any excess of the 
amounts they are required to hold. This bank has loaned out all of its excess reserves, $2,000.

How did we come up with this sum? It’s from the following simple formula, which we 
derive in the appendix to this chapter:
total increase in checking account balance throughout all banks
= (initial cash deposit) *
1
(reserve ratio)
In our example, the reserve ratio is 0.1, so the increase in checking account balances 
is 1/0.1, or 10 times the initial cash deposit. The initial $1,000 deposit led to a total 
increase in checking account balances of $10,000 throughout all of the banks.
Recall that the money supply, M1, is the sum of deposits at commercial banks 
plus currency held by the public. Therefore, the change in the money supply, M1, 
will be the change in deposits in checking accounts plus the change in currency held 
by the public. Notice that we referred to “change,” meaning an increase or decrease. 
Here’s why: In our example, the public, represented by the person who initially made 
the $1,000 deposit at the First Bank of Hollywood, holds $1,000 less in currency. 
However, deposits increased by $10,000. Therefore, the money supply, M1, increased 
by $9,000 ($10,000 - $1,000). No single bank lent out more than it had in deposits. 
▲  Figure 13.4  Process of Deposit Creation: Changes in Balance Sheets
The figure shows how an initial deposit of $1,000 can expand the money supply. The first three banks 
in the figure loaned out all their excess reserves and the borrowers deposited the full sum of their loans. 
In the real world, though, people hold part of their loans as cash and banks don’t necessarily loan 
out all their excess reserves. Consequently, a smaller amount of money will be created than what’s 
shown here.

Chapter 13 • Money and the Banking System
307
Yet for the banking system as a whole, the money supply expanded by a multiple of 
the initial cash deposit.
The term 1/reserve ratio in the formula is called the money multiplier. It tells us 
what the total increase in checking account deposits would be for any initial cash 
deposit. Recall the multiplier for government spending in our demand-side models: An 
increase in government spending led to larger increases in output through the multi-
plier. The government-pending multiplier arose because additional rounds of con-
sumption spending were triggered by an initial increase in government spending. In 
the banking system, an initial cash deposit triggers additional rounds of deposits and 
lending by banks. This leads to a multiple expansion of deposits.
As of 2015 in the United States, banks were required to hold 3 percent in reserves 
against checkable deposits between $14.5 million and $103.6 million and 10 percent 
on all checkable deposits exceeding $103.6 million. Because large banks would face a 
10 percent reserve requirement on any new deposits, you might think, on the basis of 
our formula, that the money multiplier would be approximately 10.
However, the money multiplier for the United States has typically been between 
two and three—much smaller than the value of 10 implied by our simple formula. 
There are two reasons for this. First, our formula assumed all loans made their way 
directly into checking accounts. In reality, people hold part of their loans as cash. That 
cash is not available for the banking system to lend out. The more money people hold 
in cash, the less they have on deposit that can be loaned out again. This decreases the 
money multiplier. Second, the money multiplier will also be less if banks held excess 
reserves. Until recently, this was not an important factor, but a recent change to pay 
interest on excess reserves has sharply increased their levels. We can represent these 
factors in a money multiplier ratio, but it will not be as simple as the one we intro-
duced here.
How the Money Multiplier Works in Reverse
The money-creation process also works in reverse. Suppose you go to your bank and 
ask for $1,000 in cash from your checking account. The bank must pay you the $1,000. 
The bank’s liabilities fall by $1,000, but its assets must also fall by $1,000. Withdrawing 
your $1,000 means two things at the bank. First, if the reserve ratio is 0.1, the bank will 
reduce its reserves by $100. Second, your $1,000 withdrawal minus the $100 reduction 
in reserves means the bank has $900 less to lend out. The bank will therefore reduce 
its loans by $900. With fewer loans, there will be fewer deposits in other banks. The 
money multiplier working in reverse decreases the money supply.
You may wonder how a bank goes about reducing its outstanding loans. If you had 
borrowed from a bank to invest in a project for your business, you would not want the 
bank phoning you to ask for its funds, which are not lying idle but are invested in your 
business. Banks do not typically call in outstanding loans from borrowers. Instead, if 
banks cannot tap into their excess reserves when their customers want to withdraw cash, 
they have to make fewer new loans. In these circumstances, a new potential borrower 
would find it harder to obtain a loan from the bank.
Up to this point, our examples have always started with an initial cash deposit. 
However, suppose Paul receives a check from Freda and deposits it into his bank. Paul’s 
bank will eventually receive payment from Freda’s bank. When it does, it will initially 
have an increase in both deposits and reserves—just as if a cash deposit were made. 
Because Paul’s bank has to hold only a fraction of the deposits as reserves, it will be 
able to make loans with the remainder.
However, there is one crucial difference between this example, in which one indi-
vidual writes a check to another, and our earlier example, in which an individual makes 
a cash deposit: When Paul receives the check from Freda, the money supply will not 
be changed in the long run. Here’s why: When Freda’s check is deposited in Paul’s 
bank, the money supply will begin to expand, but when Freda’s bank loses its deposit, 
money multiplier

account deposits to an initial cash deposit.

the money supply will start to contract. The expansions and contractions offset each 
other when private citizens and firms write checks to one another.
In the next chapter, we see how the Federal Reserve can change the money supply 
to stabilize the economy. In the remainder of this chapter, we look at the structure of 
the Federal Reserve and the critical role that it plays as a central bank stabilizing the 
financial system.
A p p l i c a t i o n  2
The Growth In Excess Reserves
Applying the Concepts #2: Why have banks recently started to hold vast amounts of excess reserves?
As Figure 13.5 indicates, banks have responded to the new 
incentives. Prior to the change in law, banks held few excess 
reserves. After the change in the law, excess reserves increased 
sharply and total reserves now far exceed required reserves. In 
the long run, the Federal Reserve will need to make sure that 
banks do not lend out too many reserves or the result will be 
higher inflation.  Related to Exercises 2.2 and 2.10.
During the height of the financial crisis in September 2008, 
the Fed injected large amounts of reserves into banks, and in 
the next month, it started paying interest to banks on these 
reserves. Prior to this time, banks earned no interest on either 
required or excess reserves. This created an incentive for banks 
to keep minimal excess reserves and lend any extra funds they 
had. However, once banks began to earn interest on excess 
reserves, they did not have to lend their funds out to earn inter-
est. If lending opportunities were not very attractive, the bank 
could safely keep their funds on hand.
▲  Figure 13.5  Required and Total Reserves of Banks
Until September 2008, banks held few excess reserves so total reserves (in red) were very close to required reserves (in purple). In response to the 
financial crisis of 2008, the Fed injected large amounts of reserves into the system and began paying interest on reserves in October. As a result, excess 
reserves rose and total reserves now substantially exceed required reserves.

A Banker’s Bank: The Federal Reserve
The Federal Reserve System was created in 1913 after a series of financial panics 
in the United States. Financial panics can occur when there is bad news about the 
economy or the stability of financial institutions. During these panics, numerous bank 
runs occurred, depleting the funds on hand that banks could loan out. Severe economic 
downturns followed.
Congress created the Federal Reserve System to be a central bank, or “a banker’s 
bank.” One of the Fed’s primary jobs is thus to serve as a lender of last resort. When 
banks need to borrow money during a financial crisis, they can turn to the central bank 
as “a last resort” for these funds. If a bank experienced a run, the Federal Reserve could 
lend it the funds it needed.
Functions of the Federal Reserve
The Federal Reserve has several key functions. Let’s briefly describe them.
The Fed Supplies Currency To The Economy  Working through the bank-
ing system, the Federal Reserve is responsible for supplying currency to the economy. 
Although currency is only one component of the money supply, if individuals prefer 
to hold currency rather than demand deposits, the Federal Reserve and the banking 
system will facilitate the public’s preferences.
The Fed Provides A System Of Check Collection And Clearing  The 
Federal Reserve is responsible for making our system of complex financial transactions 
“work.” This means that when Paul writes Freda a check, the Federal Reserve oversees 
the banks to ensure Freda’s bank receives the funds from Paul’s bank. This is known 
as check clearing. As our economy moves to more electronic transactions, the Federal 
Reserve provides oversight over these transactions as well.
The Fed Holds Reserves From Banks And Other Depository 
­Institutions And Regulates Banks  As we have seen, banks are required to 
hold reserves with the Federal Reserve System. The Federal Reserve also serves as a 
regulator to banks to ensure they are complying with rules and regulations. Ultimately, 
the Federal Reserve wants to ensure the financial system is safe.
The Fed Conducts Monetary Policy  One of the important responsibilities 
of the Federal Reserve is to conduct monetary policy, the range of actions that influ-
ence the level of real GDP or inflation.
Virtually all countries have central banks. The Indian central bank is known as the 
Reserve Bank of India. In the United Kingdom, the central bank is the Bank of England. 
Central banks serve as lenders of last resort to the banks in their countries and also help 
to control the level of economic activity. If the economy is operating at a level that’s “too 
hot” or “too cold,” they can manipulate the money supply to fend off economic prob-
lems. We see how central banks use monetary policy to influence real GDP or inflation 
and fend off economic problems in the next chapter.
The Structure of the Federal Reserve
When members of Congress created the Federal Reserve System, they were aware 
the institution would be very powerful. Consequently, they deliberately created a 
structure that attempted to disperse the power, moving it away from major U.S. 
financial centers (such as New York) to other parts of the country. They divided the 
United States into 12 Federal Reserve districts, each of which has a Federal Reserve 
Bank. These district banks provide advice on monetary policy, take part in decision 
making on monetary policy, and act as a liaison between the Fed and the banks in 
their districts.
Figure 13.6 shows where each of the 12 Federal Reserve Banks is located. At 
the time the Fed was created, economic and financial power in the United States

was concentrated in the East and the Midwest. Although this is no longer the case, 
the locations of the Federal Reserve Banks still reflect the Fed’s historical roots. 
Which major western city does not have a Federal Reserve Bank? It is, of course, 
Los Angeles.
There are two other subgroups of the Fed in addition to the Federal Reserve 
Banks. The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve is the true seat of power in 
the Federal Reserve System. Headquartered in Washington, D.C., the seven members 
of the board are appointed for 14-year terms by the president and confirmed by the 
Senate. The chairperson serves a 4-year term as the principal spokesperson for mon-
etary policy in the United States. Financial markets throughout the world anticipate 
and carefully observe what the chairperson says.
The third subgroup of the Fed is the Federal Open Market Committee 
(FOMC), which makes decisions about monetary policy. The FOMC is a 12-person 
board consisting of the seven members of the Board of Governors, the president of the 
New York Federal Reserve Bank, and the presidents of four other regional Federal 
Reserve Banks. (The presidents of the regional banks other than New York serve on a 
rotating basis; the seven nonvoting bank presidents attend the meetings and offer their 
opinions.) The chairperson of the Board of Governors also serves as the chairperson 
of the FOMC. The FOMC makes the actual decisions on changes in the money supply. 
Its members are assisted by vast teams of professionals at the Board of Governors and 
at the regional Federal Reserve Banks. The structure of the Federal Reserve System is 
depicted in Figure 13.7.
On paper, monetary policymaking power appears to be spread throughout the gov-
ernment and the country. In practice, however, the Board of Governors, and especially 
the chairperson, has the real control. The Board of Governors operates with consider-
able independence. Presidents and members of Congress can bring political pressures 
on the Board of Governors, but their 14-year terms tend to insulate the members from 
external pressures. The current chairman of the Federal Reserve is Janet Yellen, who 
began her term on October 4, 2014.

The Independence of the Federal Reserve
Countries differ in the degree to which their central banks are independent of political 
authorities. In the United States, the chairperson of the Board of Governors is required 
to report to Congress on a regular basis, but in practice the Fed makes its own deci-
sions and later informs Congress what it did. The Fed chairperson also often meets 
with members of the executive branch to discuss economic affairs. Following the Fed’s 
interventions during the financial crisis, there is increasing interest in Congress to make 
the Fed disclose additional information.
The central banks in both the United States and the United Kingdom currently 
operate with considerable independence of elected officials. In other countries, the 
central bank is part of the treasury department of the government and is potentially 
subject to more direct political control. There has been a lively debate among econo-
mists and political scientists as to whether countries with more independent central 
banks (banks with less external political pressure) experience less inflation. Central 
banks that are not independent will always be under pressure to help finance their 
country’s government deficits by creating money. When central banks succumb to 
this pressure, the result is inflation. Independence, on the other hand, typically means 
less inflation.

Stress Tests For The Financial System
Applying the Concepts #3: How do policymakers use stress tests to safeguard the financial system?
institutions are supposed to have enough capital or owners’ 
equity to survive in the face of these conditions. The banks 
report simulations of their analysis to the Federal Reserve and 
the Fed evaluates both the results and sophistication of their 
analyses.
The Fed also obtains detailed information about each 
bank’s assets and liabilities. It then runs its own tests using 
their own internal financial models. The Fed then assesses the 
banks and financial institutions using all these results and then 
determines whether or not the financial institutions “pass the 
test.” If a financial institution does not pass the test, the Fed can 
prevent the institution from paying out dividends to its share-
holders or may make it raise additional capital from the finan-
cial markets. Some banks and financial institutions have failed 
these stress tests. Secretary Geithner believed this was one of 
the most important regulatory innovations stemming from the 
financial crisis.  Related to Exercises 4.3 and 4.7.
SOURCES: Timothy F. Geithner, Stress Tests: Reflections on Financial Crises 
(New York: Crown Publishers, 2014), and Ryan Tracy, Emily Glazer, and Victoria 
McGrane, “Fed ‘Stress Tests’ Still Pose Puzzle to Banks,” Wall Street Journal, 
March 12, 2015.
After the severe financial crisis of 2008, policymakers began 
searching for tools to make sure that banks and financial institu-
tions could survive future shocks and not subject the economy 
to another major crisis. In the United States, Secretary of the 
Treasury Timothy Geithner and his staff came up with the idea of 
subjecting major banks and financial institutions to “stress tests.”
Here is how stress tests work. A major bank will be required 
to develop analytical models to determine what would happen 
if there were a sudden, adverse change in economic condi-
tions, for example, a sharp rise in interest rates, a major drop 
in real GDP, a failure of several major financial institutions, or a 
substantial increase in unemployment. The banks and financial

Coping With The Financial Chaos Caused By The Mortgage Crisis
Applying the Concepts #4: How did the Fed successfully respond to the collapse of major financial 
institutions in 2008?
The Fed feared that a complete collapse of Bear Stearns 
would devastate the financial system and cause a global panic 
as investors would want to pull out their funds from all financial 
institutions, effectively causing a “run” in the financial markets. 
During the week, the Fed began to search for ways to deal with 
this crisis. One solution was to try to convince another financial 
institution to take over Bear Stearns and keep the financial mar-
kets open. The problem, however, was that no one had a clear 
idea precisely what quality of assets Bear Stearns had on its bal-
ance sheet, and thus no firm wanted to be exposed to the risk of 
purchasing them. Finally, the Fed convinced the investment firm 
JPMorgan Chase & Co. to buy Bear Stearns—but only after the 
Fed agreed to loan Chase $30 billion. The Fed had successfully 
averted a major financial crisis but had put U.S. taxpayers at risk 
by lending such a large amount to a private investment house.
Unfortunately, Bear Stearns was only an early symptom of 
a problem that increased in severity over the coming months. As 
we discussed in Chapter 12, by September and October 2008 
Sunday, March 16, 2008, was not a peaceful day for the Board 
of Governors. Over the prior week, one of Wall Street’s most 
famous investment houses, Bear Stearns, had gone into full col-
lapse. Although Bear Stearns had roughly $17 billion in readily 
available assets, it appeared this was not enough to satisfy the 
market. Other investment firms believed Bear Stearns had made 
so many poor investments that it was not financially viable. They 
rapidly began pulling out their funds from the firm.

the mortgage crisis had effectively spilled over into the world’s 
financial markets. Banks and other financial institutions were 
afraid to lend to one another because they were not sure 
whether or not their loans would be repaid. The world’s financial 
markets were freezing up, stock markets were in sharp decline, 
and there was growing panic.
The panic was brought to a head when the Fed and Trea-
sury decided not to arrange a bailout for Lehman Brothers, 
another major financial institution, as they had done for Bear 
Stearns. The markets worldwide reacted adversely to this deci-
sion. The Fed and Treasury quickly changed tactics, however, 
and authorized an $85 billion loan to the American International 
Group (AIG) and took an 80 percent ownership stake in the com-
pany. The Fed had thought that the failure of AIG would trigger 
massive failures of other institutions whose assets were insured 
by AIG. As the crisis continued, the Fed continued to develop 
new programs, such as purchasing the short-term debt of 
corporations—commercial paper—so that it effectively spread 
its lender of last resort function beyond financial institutions. It 
also began a program to extend loans to money market funds, 
some of which had come under financial pressure, and it started 
to make purchases of securities backed by mortgages in order 
to keep funds flowing to the housing sector. Finally, it began to 
pay interest on deposits held at the Fed, a move designed to 
induce banks to hold more reserves and increase the Fed’s own 
ability to make critical loans.
Taken together, these were sweeping changes to the Fed’s 
role in the financial system. The Fed has now abandoned its 
efforts to support the commercial paper market and money 
market funds, but has maintained the other programs. Only 
time will tell whether the remaining changes, adopted during a 
2-month period, will become permanent tools of the Fed or will 
fade away when the economy eventually recovers.?  Related to 
Exercises 4.1, 4.6, and 4.8.
We began this chapter by examining 
the role money plays in the econ-
omy and how economists define 
money. We then looked at the flow 
of money in and out of banks and 
saw how banks can create money 
with deposits and loans. Finally, 
we examined the structure of the 
Federal Reserve and the key roles 
that central banks can play during 
financial crises. Here are the main 
points you should remember from 
this chapter:
1.	 Money consists of anything we regularly use to make exchanges. 
In modern economies, money consists primarily of currency and 
deposits in checking accounts.
2.	 Banks are financial intermediaries that earn profits by accept-
ing deposits and making loans. Deposits, which are liabilities of 
banks, are included in the money supply.
3.	 Banks are required by law to hold a fraction of their depos-
its as reserves, either in cash or in deposits with the Federal 
Reserve. Total reserves consist of required reserves plus excess 
reserves.
4.	 If there is an increase in reserves in the banking system, the sup-
ply of money will expand by a multiple of the initial deposit. This 
multiple is known as the money multiplier.
5.	 Decisions about the supply of money are made at the Federal 
Open Market Committee (FOMC), which includes the seven 
members on the Board of Governors and the president of the 
New York Federal Reserve Bank, as well as four of the 11 other 
regional bank presidents, who serve on a rotating basis.
6.	 In a financial crisis like those that occurred in 2001 and 
2008, the Fed can help stabilize the economy. Current and 
recent Fed chairmen have been powerful figures in the national 
economy.

What Is Money?
Identify the components of money in the U.S. economy.
1.1	 Money provides a convenient measuring rod when 
the _________ of all goods are expressed in _________ 
terms.
1.2	 Gold is a good example of commodity money. 
_________ (True/False)
1.3	 In the United States, currency held by the public consti-
tutes a greater proportion of M1 than demand deposits 
and other checkable deposits. _________ (True/False)
1.4	 The largest component of M2 is deposits in _________.
1.5	 Money market mutual funds are hard to classify in a 
definition of money because they are only held to facili-
tate transactions. _________ (True/False)
1.6	 Some people temporarily invest in mutual funds before 
moving them into riskier, higher-earning stock market 
investments later. _________ (True/False)
1.7	 Debit Cards Debit cards have become very popular. 
Debit cards allow the holder of the card to pay a mer-
chant for goods and services directly from a checking 
account. How do you think the introduction of debit 
cards affected the amount of currency in the economy? 
How about the amount of checking account deposits?
1.8	 Gift Cards. Gift cards have grown in popularity as a 
mechanism to give gifts. Cards are available for popular 
bookstores and for coffee shops. Should these gift cards 
be considered part of the money supply? How do they 
differ from traveler’s checks?
1.9	 Greek Cash Euro Holdings. Discuss whether this 
quote is accurate: “Greeks have increased their hold-
ings of euros in cash because they have great faith in the 
monetary system of Europe.” (Related to ­Application 1 
on page 303.)
1.10	 Credit Cards. Why aren’t traditional credit cards part 
of the money supply?
1.11	 Inflation and Currency Held Abroad. Suppose infla-
tion in the United States fell to 5 percent a year. How 
do you think this would affect the demand for U.S. 
currency held in other countries?
1.12	 Bitcoins as a Store of Value. Bitcoins are a new form 
of electronic, privately issued money that can poten-
tially preserve the anonymity of transactions. The 
prices of a single Bitcoin has varied between $400 and 
$1,200 in recent years. Discuss Bitcoins from the point 
of view as a store of value.
How Banks Create Money
Explain the process of multiple expansion and contraction 
of deposits.
2.1	 Banks are required by law to keep a fraction of their 
deposits as _________.
2.2	 When reserves do not pay interest, banks prefer to keep 
reserves rather than make loans. _________ (True/
False) (Related to Application 2 on page 308.)
2.3	 If the reserve ratio is 0.3 and a deposit of $500 is made 
into a bank, the bank can lend out  _________.
2.4	 If the simplified money multiplier is 4, the reserve ratio 
is _________.
2.5	 Payments for Lawsuits at Banks. In 2015, U.S. Bank 
National Association paid $18 million to customers of 
Peregrine Financial Group to settle a lawsuit. If the 
reserve ratio was 0.1, how did this payment immediately 
change assets, liabilities, and owner’s equity?
All problems are assignable in MyLab Economics. 

315
2.6	 Banks versus Insurance Companies. Both insurance 
companies and banks are financial intermediaries. Why 
do macroeconomists study banks more intensively than 
insurance companies?
2.7	 Understanding M1 and M2. If you write a check from 
your checking account to your money market account, 
what happens to M1 and M2?
2.8	 Cash Withdrawals and Changes in the Money Sup-
ply. If a customer withdrew $1,000 in cash from a bank 
and the reserve ratio was 0.1, by how much could the 
supply of money be eventually reduced?
2.9	 Money Market Mutual Funds, Banks, and 
Reserves. Money market mutual funds typically invest 
in government securities and other financial instru-
ments that can be easily bought and sold. They are 
not subject to reserve requirements and, in fact, hold 
minimal reserves. Banks, on the other hand, make loans 
to businesses for investment purposes. If there were 
no reserve requirements for banks, how do you think 
their reserve holdings would compare to money market 
mutual funds?
2.10	 Setting the Interest Rate on Reserves. What would 
be the danger if the Fed set an interest rate on reserves 
close to the market interest rate on loans? (Related to 
Application 2 on page 308.)
A Banker’s Bank: The Federal Reserve
Describe the structure of the Federal Reserve.
3.1	 The Federal Reserve is the “_________ of last resort.”
3.2	 The United States is divided into 12 districts, each of 
which has a Federal Reserve Bank. These banks do 
not participate in monetary policy decisions, but liaise 
between the Fed and other banks. _________ (True/False)
3.3	 The _________ votes on monetary policy.
3.4	 _________-year terms help ensure the political inde-
pendence of the Board of Governors.
3.5	 The Fed provides a system of check collection and 
_________.
3.6	 The Treasury Secretary and the Fed. Occasionally, 
some economists or politicians suggest that the Sec-
retary of the Treasury become a member of the Fed-
eral Open Market Committee. How do you think this 
would affect the operation of the Federal Reserve?
3.7	 Where Should Regional Banks Be Located Today? 
Given the changes in the location of economic activity 
that have occurred since the founding of the Federal 
Reserve, how would the location of the regional banks 
change if they were allocated by economic activity?
3.8	 The President of the New York Federal Reserve 
Bank. The president of the New York Federal Reserve 
Bank is always a voting member of the Federal Open 
Market Committee. Given your understanding of the 
conduct of monetary policy, why is this true?
3.9	 Auditing the Fed? In recent years, a number of mem-
bers of Congress have sponsored bills that would sub-
ject the Fed to audits of its monetary policy. This is a 
form of intensive Congressional oversight. What are 
the pros and cons of more Congressional oversight of 
the Fed?
What the Federal Reserve Does during  
a Financial Crisis
Discuss examples of how the Federal Reserve  
acts during financial crises.
4.1	 The Federal Reserve arranged for JPMorgan Chase 
& Co. to _________ Bear Stearns during the finan-
cial crisis in 2008. (Related to Application 4 on pages 
312–313.)
4.2	 The Federal Reserve helps finance the deficit of the 
U.S. government by _________ (creating/reducing) 
money.
4.3	 A stress test for banks is a method to determine if 
bank buildings are strong enough to withstand a major 
earthquake. _________ (True/False) (Related to Appli-
cation 3 on page 312.)
4.4	 Required Reserves during the Great Depres-
sion. During the Great Depression, banks held excess 
reserves because they were concerned depositors 
might be more inclined to withdraw funds from their 
accounts. At one point, the Fed became concerned that 
excess reserves were too high and raised the reserve 
requirements for banks.
a.	 Assuming banks were holding excess reserves for 
precautionary purposes, do you think they would 
continue to want to hold them even after reserve 
requirements were raised? Explain.
b.	What do you think happened to the money supply 
after the Fed raised reserve requirements?
4.5	 Crisis in the Short-Term Credit Market. In 1973, 
several major companies went bankrupt and were not 
going to be able to pay interest on their short-term 
loans. This caused a crisis in the market. There was 
concern that the short-term credit market would col-
lapse, and that even healthy corporations would not be 
able to borrow. How do you think the Fed should have 
handled that situation?
4.6	 The Federal Reserve Loan to JPMorgan Chase 
& Co. When the Federal Reserve makes a loan to a 
bank or financial institution, it requires the institution 
to specify certain assets the Federal Reserve can take 
possession of if the loan is not repaid. These assets are 
known as collateral. When the Federal Reserve made 
its $30 billion loan to JPMorgan, it allowed JPMorgan 

316
to use some of the assets of Bear ­Stearns as ­collateral. 
Why was this risky for the Federal Reserve and a 
good deal for JPMorgan? (Related to ­Application 4 
on pages 312–313.)
4.7	 Dividends and Stress Tests. What happens to bank 
dividend payments to shareholders if the bank fails a 
stress test? (Related to Application 3 on page 312.)
4.8	 Bailouts? Some critics of the Fed’s actions with AIG 
and Bear Stearns said that the government was just 
bailing out failing financial firms that should have 
been allowed to fail. It is true that owners of both 
firms did benefit from these actions. Nonetheless, 
can you defend the Fed? (Related to Application 4 on 
pages 312–313.)
Money Creation
This experiment demonstrates the money-creation process. 
Students act like bankers and investors. Bankers loan money 
to investors, who then buy machines that produce output. 
The experiment is divided into several separate days. On 
each day, all loans are executed in the morning, all deposits 
happen over the lunch hour, and all machines are purchased 
in the afternoon. Each bank can receive only one deposit 
and issue only one loan. The interest rate paid to depositors 
and the interest rate paid by borrowers are negotiable. The 
experiment starts when the instructor deposits $625 from the 
sale of a government bond into a bank.
Bank Actions
The sequence of possible bank actions on a given day is as 
follows:
1.	Early morning: Count money. Check for excess reserves, 
including deposits from the previous noon.
2.	Middle morning: Loan out any excess reserves in a single 
loan to a borrower and negotiate an interest rate for the 
loan. The loan is executed by writing a bank check to the 
borrower.
3.	Noon: Receive a deposit (bank check deposited into a 
checking account).
4.	Afternoon: Relax, golf.
Econom ic Experiment
Rules For Banks
The rules for banks are as follows:
1.	For each $1 deposited, you must hold $0.20 in reserve.
2.	If you don’t issue a loan, you can earn 3 percent by invest-
ing overseas.
Investor Actions
The sequence of possible investor actions on a given day is 
as follows:
1.	Early morning: Sleep in while bankers count their money.
2.	Middle morning: Borrow money from a bank and negoti-
ate an interest rate for the loan.
3.	Noon: Deposit the loan at the bank of your choice and 
negotiate an interest rate for the deposit.
4.	Afternoon: Buy machines from Machine, Inc., paying 
with a personal check.
Investor Payoffs
Each machine costs $1, generates $1.10 worth of output, 
and then expires. As the students play, the instructor keeps 
track of the model economy on a tally sheet, which shows 
the money-creation process in action, round by round. What 
role do the return on overseas investment (3 percent) and the 
return from owning a machine ($1.10 on a $1.00 investment) 
play in this experiment?

Formula For Deposit Creation
To show how to derive the formula for deposit creation, let’s use the example in the 
text. We showed that with 10 percent held as reserves, a $1,000 deposit led to total 
deposits of
$1,000 + $900 + $810 + $729 + $656.10 + p
Let’s find the total sum of all these deposits. Because each bank successively had to 
hold 10 percent in its reserves, each successive bank received only 0.9 of the deposits 
of the prior bank. Therefore, we can write the total for the deposits in all the banks as
$1,000 * (1 + 0.9 + 0.92 + 0.93 + 0.94 + p )
We need to find the sum of the terms in parentheses. Using a formula for an 
infinite sum,
1 + b + b2 + b3 + b4 + p =
1
(1 - b)
the expression becomes
1 + 0.9 + 0.92 + 0.93 + 0.94 + p =
1
(1 - 0.9) = 10
Therefore, the total increase in deposits will be
$1,000 * 10 = $10,000
To derive the general formula, note that if the reserve ratio is r, the bank will lend 
out (1 - r) per dollar of deposits. Following the steps we just outlined, we find the 
infinite sum will be 1/[1 - (1 - r)] = 1/r, or 1/reserve ratio. Therefore, in general, 
we have the formula
Increase in checking account balances = (initial deposit) *
1
reserve ratio

C h a p t e r
When Janet Yellen assumed the 
position of Chair of the Board of 
Governors of the Federal Reserve 
System on February 3, 2014, she 
became the first female to serve as 
either Fed chair or as Secretary of 
the Treasury for the United States. 
It was clearly a historic first.
Yellen came to this position with superb qualifications. Like 
her predecessor, Ben Bernanke, she had impeccable aca-
demic credentials. She holds a PhD from Yale and taught 
at Harvard, the London School of Economics, and the University of California, Berkeley. Yellen is well known for 
her academic work on unemployment and developing new perspectives on Keynesian economics. On the basis of 
these academic credentials and her overall reputation, she was appointed to serve as the Chair of the Council of 
Economic Advisers by President Bill Clinton, gaining invaluable experience in Washington.
Janet Yellen also has had extensive experience with the Federal Reserve. In the 1970s, she served as a staff 
member of the Board of Governors. She was appointed vice-chairman of the Board of Governors in 2010 by 
­President Barack Obama. Prior to that appointment she served as president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San 
Francisco. She thus has the perspective of both a bank president and a member of the Board of Governors. Her 
major task as Chair will be to steer the economy to full employment and to manage the expanded role that the 
Federal Reserve was given after the 2009 financial crisis.

n this chapter, we learn why everyone is so interested in what the Federal Reserve 
is about to do. In the short run, when prices don’t have enough time to change and 
we consider them temporarily fixed, the Federal Reserve can influence interest rate 
levels in the economy. When the Federal Reserve lowers interest rates, investment 
spending and GDP increase because the cost of funds is cheaper. Conversely, when the 
Fed increases interest rates, investment spending and GDP decrease because the cost of 
funds is higher. It is this power of the Fed to affect interest rates in the short run that 
will influence firms’ decisions to invest. Individuals who want to invest in or purchase 
homes also want to know what the Fed will do about interest rates in the near future.
The Money Market
The money market is the market for money where the amount supplied and the 
amount demanded meet to determine the nominal interest rate. Recall that the nominal 
interest rate is the stated or quoted interest rate before adjusting for inflation. We begin 
by learning the factors that determine the public’s demand for money. Once we under-
stand what affects the demand for money, we can see how the actions of the Federal 
Reserve determine the supply of money. Then we see how the demand and supply of 
money together determine interest rates.
The Demand for Money
Let’s think of money as simply one part of wealth. Suppose your total wealth is valued 
at $1,000. In what form will you hold your wealth? Should you put all your wealth into 
the stock market? Or perhaps into the bond market? Or should you hold some of your 
wealth in money, that is, currency and deposits in checking accounts?
Interest Rates Affect Money Demands  If you invest in assets such as stocks 
or bonds, you will generally earn income on them. Stocks are shares in the ownership 
of a corporation. There are two sources of income from stocks: dividends paid to their 
owners out of the profits of the corporation, and the typical increase in their value over 
time. Bonds are loans that are repaid with interest. Thus, both stocks and bonds provide 
returns to investors. If you hold your wealth in currency or in a checking account, 
however, you will receive either no interest or very low interest. And if inflation rises 
sharply, you might even lose money. Holding your wealth as money in currency or a 
checking account means you sacrifice some potential income.
Money does, however, provide a valuable service. It facilitates transactions. If 
you go to a grocery store to purchase cereal, the store will accept currency or a check, 
but you won’t be able to pay for cereal with your stocks and bonds. People hold 
money primarily for this basic reason: Money makes it easier to conduct everyday 
transactions. Economists call this reason for holding money the transaction demand 
for money.
To understand the demand for money, we rely on the principle of opportunity cost.
Learning Objective 14.1
Explain the role of demand and supply 
in the money market.

The opportunity cost of something is what you sacrifice to get it.
The opportunity cost of holding money is the return you could have earned by 
holding your wealth in other assets. We measure the opportunity cost of holding money 
by the interest rate. Suppose the interest rate available to you on a long-term bond is 
6 percent per year. If you hold $100 of your wealth in the form of this bond, you’ll earn 
$6 a year. If you hold currency instead, you’ll earn no interest. So the opportunity cost 
of holding $100 in currency is $6 per year, or 6 percent per year.

Chapter 14 • The Federal Reserve and Monetary Policy
321
The Price Level And Gdp Affect Money Demand  The demand for money 
also depends on two other factors. One is the overall price level in the economy. The 
demand for money will increase as the level of prices increases. If prices for your gro-
ceries are twice as high, you will need twice as much money to purchase them. The 
amount of money people typically hold during any time period will be closely related to 
the dollar value of the transactions they make. This is an example of the real-nominal 
principle in action.
▲  Figure 14.1  Demand For Money
As interest rates increase from r0 to r1, the quantity of money demanded falls from M0 to M1.

What matters to people is the real value of money or income—its 
purchasing power—not the face value of money or income.
As interest rates increase in the economy, the opportunity cost of holding money 
also increases. Economists have found that as the opportunity cost of holding money 
increases, the public demands less money. The quantity demanded of money will 
decrease with an increase in interest rates.
In Figure 14.1, we draw a demand for money curve, Md, as a function of the 
interest rate. At higher interest rates, individuals will want to hold less money than 
they will at lower interest rates because the opportunity cost of holding money is 
higher. As interest rates rise from r0 to r1, the quantity of money demanded falls from 
M0 to M1.
The other factor that influences the demand for money is the level of real GDP 
or real income. It seems obvious that as income increases, individuals and businesses 
will make more purchases. Similarly, as real GDP increases, individuals and businesses

Quantitative Easing and the Fed’s Balance Sheet
Applying the Concepts #1: How did the policy of quantitative easing affect  
the Fed’s holding of assets?
look to buy other securities and drive up their prices and lower 
their interest rates as well.
The Fed’s operations were massive. Before the advent of 
these operations—collectively known as quantitative easing—
the Fed’s balance sheet was less than $1 trillion and virtually 
all of its assets were held as government securities. By the end 
of the last phase of quantitative easing in October 2014, the 
Fed now held $4.5 trillion in assets, more than four times as 
much. And, now nearly 40 percent of the Fed’s assets are held 
in mortgage securities.
What should the Fed do with its enlarged balance sheet? 
For the time being, probably not much. Fed Chairman Janet Yel-
len does not believe that the expanded Fed balance sheet poses 
any problems for the monetary policy of the economy. And the 
consequences of selling off a large amount of assets would 
unsettle the markets. The Fed does earn interest on its asset 
holdings, but after paying for its expenses, the Fed turns the 
extra funds over to the U.S. Treasury.  Related to Exercise 2.7.
Beginning with the financial crisis in late 2008, the Fed began 
to engage in an unprecedented series of purchases of securi-
ties in the markets. Using its power to write checks on itself, 
the Fed began to purchase long-term government bonds and 
securities backed by mortgages. The Fed’s goal was to drive up 
the prices of government bonds and mortgage securities and 
thereby lower the interest rates on both bonds and mortgages. 
As interest rates fell on bonds and mortgages, investors would 
will make more transactions. To facilitate these transactions, they will want to hold 
more money.
Figure 14.2 shows how changes in prices and GDP affect the demand for money. 
Panel A shows how the demand for money shifts to the right as the price level increases. 
At any interest rate, people will want to hold more money as prices increase. Panel B 
shows how the demand for money shifts to the right as real GDP increases. At any 
interest rate, people will want to hold more money as real GDP increases. These 
graphs both show the same result. An increase in prices or an increase in real GDP 
will increase money demand.

Chapter 14 • The Federal Reserve and Monetary Policy
323
Other Components Of Money Demand  Traditionally, economists have 
identified other motives besides transactions for individuals or firms to hold money. If 
you hold your wealth in the form of property, such as a house or a boat, it is costly to 
sell it on short notice if you need to obtain funds. These forms of wealth are illiquid, 
meaning that they are not easily transferable into money. If you hold your wealth in 
currency or checking accounts, you do not have this problem. Economists recognize 
that people have a liquidity demand for money; they want to hold money so they can 
make transactions on quick notice.
During periods of economic volatility, investors might not want to hold stocks and 
bonds because their prices might fall. Instead, they might convert them into holdings 
that fall into the M2 category, such as savings accounts and money market funds. These 
investments earn lower interest rates on average, but are less risky than stocks and 
bonds, whose prices can fluctuate. This demand for safer assets is called the speculative 
demand for money. For example, after the stock market began to fall in 2000, indi-
viduals became very uncertain about the future and shifted their funds from the stock 
market to money market mutual funds. This shift of assets from stocks to money tem-
porarily increased M2. When the market started to recover, some investors shifted 
funds back into the stock market.
In summary, individuals hold money for three motives: to facilitate transactions, to 
provide liquidity, and to reduce risk. The amount of money they want to hold will depend 
on interest rates, the level of real GDP, and the price level.
How the Federal Reserve Can Change  
the Money Supply
As we discussed in the last chapter, the banking system as a whole can expand the 
money supply only if new reserves come into the system. As we saw, when private 
citizens and firms write checks to one another, there will be no net change in the 
supply of money. Because the total amount of reserves in the system is unchanged, 
the money supply cannot expand. There is one organization, however, that has the 
power to change the total amount of reserves in the banking system: the Federal 
Reserve.
Open Market Operations
The Fed can increase or decrease the total amount of reserves in the banking system 
through open market operations, which are the purchase or sale of U.S. government 
securities by the Fed. There are two types of open market operations:
• In open market purchases, the Fed buys government bonds from the private 
sector.
• In open market sales, the Fed sells government bonds to the private sector.
To understand how the Fed can increase the supply of money, let’s trace what 
happens after an open market purchase. Suppose the Federal Reserve purchases 
$1 million worth of government bonds currently owned by the private sector. The 
Fed writes a check for $1 million and presents it to the party who sold the bonds. The 
­Federal Reserve now owns those bonds. The party who sold the bonds then deposits 
the $1 ­million in its bank.
Here is the key to how the supply of money increases when the Fed purchases 
government bonds: As we explained in the last chapter, each bank must keep an account 
with the Fed containing both its required and excess reserves. The check written against 
the Federal Reserve increases the bank’s total reserves, essentially giving it more money 
to loan out. In this case, the bank’s account balance increases by $1 million. If the

is less risky than holding stocks or bonds.

reserve requirement is 10 percent, the bank must keep $100,000 in reserves, but it can 
now loan out $900,000 from its excess reserves. Basically, when the Fed buys bonds, 
the proceeds go out into the economy. Open market purchases of bonds therefore 
increase the money supply.
The Federal Reserve has powers that ordinary citizens and even banks do not have. 
The Fed can write checks against itself to purchase government bonds without having 
any explicit “funds” in its account for the purchase. Banks accept these checks because 
they count as part of their total reserves.
As you might expect, open market sales will, conversely, decrease the supply of 
money. Suppose the Federal Reserve sells $1 million worth of government bonds to a 
Wall Street firm. The firm will pay for the bonds with a check for $1 million drawn on 
its bank and give this check to the Federal Reserve. The bank must either hand over 
$1 million in cash or, more likely, reduce its total reserves with the Federal Reserve by 
$1 million. When the Fed sells bonds, it is basically taking the money exchanged for 
them out of the hands of the public. Open market sales therefore decrease the money 
freely available in the economy.
In summary, if the Federal Reserve wishes to increase the money supply to stim-
ulate the economy (perhaps it is operating too sluggishly), it buys government bonds 
from the private sector in open market purchases. If the Fed wishes to decrease the 
money supply to slow the economy down (perhaps it is growing too quickly and 
inflation is occurring), it sells government bonds to the private sector in open mar-
ket sales.
Other Tools of the Fed
Open market operations are by far the most important way in which the Federal 
Reserve changes the supply of money. There are four other ways in which the Fed can 
change the supply of money, which we discuss next.
Changing Reserve Requirements  Another way the Fed can change the 
money supply is by changing the reserve requirements for banks. If the Fed wishes to 
increase the supply of money, it can reduce banks’ reserve requirements so they have 
more money to loan out. This would expand the money supply. To decrease the supply 
of money, the Federal Reserve can raise reserve requirements.
Changing reserve requirements is a powerful tool, but the Federal Reserve doesn’t 
use it very often because it disrupts the banking system. Suppose a bank is required to 
hold exactly 10 percent of its deposits as reserves and has loaned the other 90 percent 
out. If the Federal Reserve suddenly increases its reserve requirement to 20 percent, 
the bank would be forced to call in or cancel many of its loans. Its customers would 
not like this! Today, the Fed doesn’t make sharp changes in reserve requirements. It 
did in the past, including during the Great Depression, because it mistakenly believed 
that the banks were holding too much in excess reserves. Banks, however, were holding 
additional reserves because they wanted to protect themselves from bank runs. As a 
result, after the increase in required reserves, banks increased their reserves even more, 
further reducing the supply of money to the economy.
Paying Interest On Reserves  The Fed recently has paid interest on required 
and excess reserves that banks hold. By paying interest on reserves, the Fed can affect 
the willingness of banks to hold reserves. Higher interest payments on reserves will lead 
banks to hold more reserves, thereby reducing the money supply. Conversely, lower 
interest payments will lead to fewer reserves and an increased money supply.
Changing The Discount Rate  A third way the Fed can change the money sup-
ply is by changing the discount rate. The discount rate is the interest rate at which 
banks can borrow directly from the Fed. Suppose a major customer asks for a large loan

borrow from the Fed.

Chapter 14 • The Federal Reserve and Monetary Policy

from a bank that has no excess reserves. Unless the bank can find an additional source 
of funds, it will not be able to make the loan. Banks are reluctant to turn away major 
customers. They first try to borrow reserves from other banks through the federal 
funds market, a market in which banks borrow and lend reserves to and from one 
another. If the rate—called the federal funds rate—seems too high to the bank, it 
could borrow directly from the Federal Reserve at the discount rate. By changing the 
discount rate, the Federal Reserve can influence the amount of borrowing by banks. If 
the Fed raises the discount rate, banks will be discouraged from borrowing reserves 
because it has become more costly. Lowering the discount rate will induce banks to 
borrow additional reserves.
Quantitative Easing  A fourth way the Fed can change the money supply is 
by buying or selling long-term Treasury bonds, for example, bonds with maturities 
of 10 years. Purchasing long-term securities is commonly called quantitative easing. 
Traditionally, the Fed conducted its open market operations by buying or selling 
short term Treasury bills, with maturities less than 3 months. By buying or selling 
short term Treasury bills, the Fed could effectively control short-term interest rates 
and avoid disruptions to the bond market.
However, sometimes the Fed will want to affect long-term interest rates 
directly. By engaging in a policy of quantitative easing, the Fed can potentially 
lower long-term interest rates directly at the same time it injects more money in 
the economy. The Fed began engaging in these policies in 2010 to stimulate the 
economy and promote a faster recovery. It finally ended its quantitative easing poli-
cies in 2014.

Did Fed Policy Cause The Commodity Boom?
Applying the Concepts #2: What is the link between a dollar depreciation  
and increases in commodity prices?
Janet Yellen, who at the time was vice-chairman of the Board of 
Governors, gave her own perspective in a speech in April 2011 
to the Economic Club of New York. She noted that the sharp 
rise in commodity prices was many times larger than the dollar 
depreciation. Moreover, she pointed to increases in worldwide 
demand and shortages of supply that were the primary cause 
of these price increases. The Fed’s action played a very minor 
role, if any, in causing the price increases.
Yellen did note that when the U.S. lowered interest rates, 
other countries also followed for fear that too much capital 
would flow into their countries if their interest rates were 
higher than those in the United States. Although the Fed might 
not be directly responsible, the combination of low interest 
rates worldwide could potentially have led to the commodity 
price increases. But even that claim is probably overstated. 
When commodity prices, particularly oil prices, fell dramati-
cally in 2014, no one really believed it was the Fed or central 
banks that were the cause of the price decline.  Related to 
Exercise 4.7.

Starting in the summer of 2010, there was a rise in prices of 
commodities such as oil and food worldwide. These increases 
in prices helped some economies—producers of these 
­commodities—but hurt others. Some economists suggested 
that monetary policy in the United States was the cause of the 
worldwide commodity boom. They noticed that commodity 
prices rose when the U.S. dollar depreciated. And they noticed 
that the U.S. dollar fell largely because monetary policy in the 
United States had driven interest rates down very low because 
the Fed was using quantitative easing to further stimulate the 
economy.
Federal Reserve officials did not believe that their actions 
were causing the worldwide increase in commodity prices.,

How Interest Rates Are Determined: Combining the 
Demand and Supply of Money
Combining the demand for money, determined by the public, with the supply of 
money, determined by the Fed, we can see how interest rates are determined in the 
short run in a demand-and-supply model of the money market.
Figure 14.3 depicts a model of the money market. The supply of money is deter-
mined by the Federal Reserve, and we assume for simplicity that it is independent of 
interest rates. We represent this independence by a vertical supply curve for money, 
Ms. In the same graph, we draw the demand for money Md. Market equilibrium occurs 
where the demand for money equals the supply of money, at an interest rate of r*.
Learning Objective 14.3

curves how the Fed can determine

demanded equals the quantity of money supplied.

Interest rates
At this equilibrium interest rate r*, the quantity of money demanded by the private 
sector equals the quantity of money supplied by the Federal Reserve. What happens 
if the interest rate is higher than r*? At a higher interest rate, the quantity of money 
demanded will be less than the fixed quantity supplied, so there will be an excess sup-
ply of money. In other markets, excess supplies cause the price to fall. The same result 
happens here. The “price of money” in the market for money is the interest rate. If 
the interest rate were below r*, the demand for money would exceed the fixed supply: 
There would be an excess demand for money. As in other markets when there are excess 
demands, the price rises. Here, the price of money or the interest rate would rise until 
it reached r*. As you can see, money-market equilibrium follows the same logic as any 
other economic equilibrium.
We can use this simple model of the money market to understand the power of 
the Federal Reserve. Suppose the Federal Reserve increases the money supply through 
an open market purchase of bonds. In Panel A of Figure 14.4, an increase in the sup-
ply of money shifts the money supply curve to the right, leading to lower interest 
rates. A decrease in the money supply through the Fed’s open market sale of bonds, as 
depicted in Panel B of Figure 14.4, decreases the supply of money, shifting the money 
supply curve to the left and increasing interest rates.
We can also think of the process from the perspective of banks. Recall our dis-
cussion of money creation through the banking system. After the Fed’s open market 
purchase of bonds, some of the money the Fed paid for the bonds gets deposited 

Chapter 14 • The Federal Reserve and Monetary Policy
327
into banks. Banks will want to make loans to consumers and businesses with that money 
because holding it in their reserves with the Fed earns them no interest. To entice 
people to borrow, banks will lower the interest rates they charge on their loans. After 
an open market purchase of bonds by the Fed, interest rates will fall throughout the 
entire economy.
Now we understand why businesspeople and politicians all want to know what the 
Federal Reserve is likely to do in the near future. The Fed exerts direct control over 
interest rates in the short run. If the Fed decides interest rates should be lower, it buys 
bonds in the open market to increase the supply of money. If the Fed wants higher 
interest rates, it sells bonds in the open market to decrease the money supply.
Interest Rates and Bond Prices
Sometimes you see in the financial section of the newspaper a statement like, “Today, 
interest rates rose as bond prices fell.” You may wonder whether these two actions are 
connected. Indeed they are. When the Fed raises interest rates, bond prices fall.
To see why, recall that bonds represent a promise to pay money in the future. 
If you own a bond, you are entitled to receive payments on it at a later time. But why 
do the prices of bonds move in the opposite direction of interest rates?
Because a bond payment occurs in the future, we need to use the concept of present 
value from Chapter 12 to determine the value of this payment today. The price of a 
bond is simply the present value of its future payments. Consider a bond that makes 
a payment one period in the future. The price of the bond—the present value of the 
payment—is equal to
price of bond =
promised payment
(1 + interest rate)
That is, the price of a bond is the payment promised, divided by one plus the interest 
rate.
Suppose the promised payment next year is $106 and the interest rate is 6 percent 
per year. The price of the bond will be
price of bond = $106
1.06 = $100
In this case, the bond would cost $100 if it were issued today. But what happens 
if interest rates in the economy change later? What if rates rise higher than 6 percent

or fall lower than 6 percent? What will the bond you are holding be worth then, if you 
decided, for example, you needed the money and had to sell it to someone else? This is 
an important question because most of the bonds for sale on the market are not newly 
issued bonds—they are bonds that have already been issued with specific promised 
payments that people are buying and selling from one another.
Let’s consider two examples:
• Suppose the promised payment is still $106, but the interest rate falls from 
6 to 4 percent per year. Using the formula, the price of the bond will rise to 
$106/1.04, or $101.92—$1.92 more than it was with an interest rate of 6 per-
cent. The price of the bond rose because, at the lower interest rate of 4 percent, 
a buyer will need more money—$101.92 versus $100—to get the same $106 the 
bond will pay next year. In other words, at a lower interest rate the value today 
of a future payment (its present value) is higher.
• Now suppose interest rates rise from 6 to 8 percent per year. In this case, the 
price you could sell your bond for will fall to $106/1.08, or $98.15. The reason 
the price falls is that a buyer would need only $98.15 to get the $106 next year. As 
interest rates rose, the price of the bond fell. In other words, at a higher interest 
rate, the value today of a future payment (its present value) is lower.
In financial markets, many types of complex bonds pay different sums of money at 
different times in the future. However, all bonds, no matter how complex or simple, 
promise to pay some money in the future. The same logic that applies to simple one-
period bonds, like the one just described, applies to more complex bonds. As interest 
rates rise, investors need less money to meet the promised payments in the future, so 
the price of all these bonds falls. As interest rates fall, investors need more money to 
meet the promised payments. Therefore, as the Fed changes interest rates, bond prices 
will move in the opposite direction of interest rates.
How Open Market Operations Directly Affect Bond Prices  There 
is another way to understand why when bond prices change in one direction, interest 
rates will change in the opposite direction. We know that when the Federal Reserve 
buys bonds in the open market, interest rates fall. But think about what the Federal 
Reserve is doing when it conducts the open market purchase. The Federal Reserve 
is buying bonds from the public. As the Fed buys bonds, it increases the demand for 
bonds and raises their price. This is another reason bond prices rise as interest rates fall.
Similarly, interest rates rise following an open market sale of bonds by the Fed. 
When the Fed conducts an open market sale, it is selling bonds, increasing the supply 
of bonds in the market. With an increase in the supply of bonds, the price of bonds 
will fall.
Because the Federal Reserve can change interest rates with open market purchases 
and sales and thereby affect the price of bonds, you can now see why Wall Street firms 
typically hire Fed watchers (often former officials of the Federal Reserve) to try to pre-
dict what the Fed will do. If a Wall Street firm correctly predicts the Fed will surprise 
the market and lower interest rates, the firm could buy millions of dollars of bonds for 
itself or its clients prior to the Fed’s announcement and make vast profits as the prices 
of the bonds inevitably rise.
Good News For The Economy Is Bad News For Bond Prices  You 
may have heard on television or read in the newspaper that prices in the bond market 
often fall in the face of good economic news, such as an increase in real output. Are the 
markets perverse? Why is good news for the economy bad news for the bond market?
We can understand the behavior of the bond market by thinking about the demand 
for money. When real GDP increases, the demand for money will increase. As the 
demand for money increases, the money demand curve will shift to the right. From our 
model of the money market, we know that increased money demand will increase inter-
est rates. Bond prices move in the opposite direction from interest rates. Therefore, good 
news for the economy is bad news for the bond market.

Chapter 14 • The Federal Reserve and Monetary Policy

Interest Rates and How They Change Investment 
and Output (GDP)
Higher or lower interest rates are just a means to an end, though, for the Fed. The 
Fed’s ultimate goal is to change output—either to slow or speed the economy by influ-
encing aggregate demand.
To show how the Fed affects the interest rate, which in turn affects investment 
(a component of GDP), and finally GDP itself, we combine our demand and supply for 
money with the curve that shows how investment spending is related to interest rates. 
This appears in Figure 14.5. Panel A in Figure 14.5 shows how interest rates are deter-
mined by the demand and supply for money. It is identical to Figure 14.3 on page 326, 
which we studied earlier. The graph shows us the equilibrium interest rate for money. 
Now let’s move to Panel B in Figure 14.5. We can see that at the equilibrium interest 
rate r* the level of investment in the economy will be given by I*.
We should note that consumption as well as investment can depend on interest 
rates. That is, spending on consumer durables, such as automobiles and refrigerators, 
will also depend negatively on the rate of interest. Consumer durables are really invest-
ment goods for the household: If you buy an automobile, you incur the cost today and 
receive benefits, such as the ability to use the car, in the future. As interest rates rise, 
the opportunity costs of investing in an automobile will rise. Consumers will respond 
to the increase in opportunity cost by purchasing fewer cars. In this chapter, we discuss 
how changes in interest rates affect investment, but keep in mind that the purchases of 
consumer durables are affected too.

The Effectiveness of Committees
Applying the Concepts #3: Is it better for decisions about monetary policy to be  
made by a single individual or by a committee?
if the rise were temporary, but waiting too long to change policy 
would be costly if the change were permanent. Who is better at 
making these sorts of determinations?
The results of the experiment showed that committees 
make decisions as quickly as, and more accurately than, indi-
viduals making decisions by themselves. Moreover, it was not 
the performance of the individual committee members that con-
tributed to the superiority of committee decisions—the actual 
process of having meetings and discussions appears to have 
improved the group’s overall performance.
In later research, Blinder also found that it did not really 
matter whether the committee had a strong leader. His find-
ings suggest it is the wisdom of the group, not its leader, that 
really matters. Also, to the extent the leader has too much 
power—and the committee functions more like an individual 
than a group—monetary policy will actually be worse!  Related 
to Exercise 5.9.
SOURCES: Based on Alan Krueger, “Economic Scene: A Study Shows Commit-
tees Can Be More Than the Sum of Their Members,” New York Times, December 7, 
2000, and Alan Blinder and John Morgan, “Leadership in Groups: A Monetary 
Experiment” (Working Paper No. 13391, National Bureau of Economic Research, 
September 2007).
When Professor Alan Blinder returned to teaching after serving 
as vice-chairman of the Federal Reserve from 1994 to 1996, 
he was convinced that committees were not effective for mak-
ing decisions about monetary policy. With another researcher, 
Blinder developed an experiment to determine whether individu-
als or groups make better decisions.
The experiment Blinder and his colleague developed was 
designed to explore how quickly individuals and groups could 
distinguish between changes in underlying trends and random 
events. For example, if unemployment were to rise in one month, 
it could be a temporary aberration or it could be the beginning 
of a recession. Changing monetary policy would be a mistake

In Figure 14.6, we show the effects of an increase in the money supply using our 
money market and investment graphs. As the supply of money increases, interest rates 
fall from r0 to r1. With lower interest rates, investment spending will increase from I0 
to I1. This increase in investment spending will then increase aggregate demand—the 
total demand for goods and services in the economy—and shift the aggregate demand 
curve to the right.

We show the shift of the aggregate demand curve in Figure 14.7. With the increase 
in aggregate demand, both output (y) and the price level (P) in the economy as a whole 
will increase in the short run. Thus, by reducing interest rates, the Fed affects output 
and prices in the economy.

In summary, when the Fed increases the money supply, it leads to lower interest 
rates and increased investment spending. In turn, a higher level of investment spending 
will ultimately lead to a higher level of GDP.

Monetary Policy and International Trade
We have been discussing monetary policy without taking into account international 
trade or international movements of financial funds across countries. Once we bring 
in these considerations, we will see that monetary policy operates through an addi-
tional route.
Suppose the Federal Reserve lowers U.S. interest rates through an open market 
purchase of bonds. As a result, investors in the United States will be earning lower 
interest rates and will seek to invest some of their funds abroad. To invest abroad, they 
will need to sell their U.S. dollars and buy the foreign currency of the country where 
they intend to invest. This will affect the exchange rate—the rate at which one cur-
rency trades for another currency in the market. As more investors sell their dollars to 
buy foreign currency, the exchange rate will fall. A fall in the exchange rate or a decrease 
in the value of a currency is called depreciation of a currency. Lower U.S. interest 
rates brought on by the Fed will cause the dollar to depreciate. This will ultimately 
change the demand and supply of goods and services around the globe because it will 
make U.S. goods cheaper than foreign goods. Let’s see why.

In this case, the lower value of the dollar will mean that U.S. goods become rela-
tively cheaper on world markets. Suppose the exchange rate is two Swiss francs to 
the dollar, meaning you will receive two Swiss francs for every dollar you exchange. 
If a U.S. machine sells for $100,000, it will cost 200,000 Swiss francs. Now suppose 
the value of the dollar depreciates so that one dollar now buys only one Swiss franc. 
The same U.S. machine will now cost Swiss residents half of what they used to pay 
for it—just 100,000 francs instead of 200,000. In other words, the lower value of the 
dollar makes U.S. goods cheaper for foreigners. As a result, foreign residents will want 
to buy more U.S. goods, and U.S. companies will want to export more goods to meet 
the higher foreign demand.
That’s the good news about the lower value of the U.S. dollar. The bad news is 
that the lower value of the dollar will make it more expensive for U.S. residents to 
buy foreign goods. If the exchange rate were still two Swiss francs to the dollar as it 
originally was at the outset of our example, Swiss chemicals with a price tag of 60,000 
francs would cost a U.S. resident $30,000. If the exchange rate of the dollar depreciates 
to one franc per dollar, however, the same chemicals will cost twice as much—$60,000. 
As the dollar depreciates, imports become more expensive, and U.S. residents tend to 
import fewer of them.
Let’s recap this: As the exchange rate for the U.S. dollar falls, U.S. goods become 
cheaper and foreign goods become more expensive. The United States then exports 
more goods and imports fewer goods. Net exports increase, in other words. This 
increase in net exports increases the demand for U.S. goods and increases GDP. 
Remember that this all began with an open market purchase of bonds by the Fed that 
increased the money supply. Here is the sequence of events:

The three new links in the sequence are from interest rates to exchange rates, from 
exchange rates to net exports, and from net exports to GDP.
This sequence also works in reverse. If the Fed conducts an open market sale of 
bonds, U.S. interest rates rise. As a result, foreign investors earning lower interest rates 
elsewhere will want to move their money to the United States where they can earn a 
higher return. As they buy more U.S. dollars, the exchange rate for the dollar will 
increase, and the dollar will increase in value. An increase in the value of a currency is 
called appreciation of a currency. The appreciation of the dollar will make U.S. goods 
more expensive for foreigners and imports cheaper for U.S. residents. Suppose the U.S. 
dollar appreciates, and each dollar can now be exchanged for three Swiss francs instead 
of two. The same machine the Swiss had to pay 200,000 francs for when the exchange 
rate was one dollar to two francs now costs 300,000 francs. The Swiss chemicals U.S. 
residents bought for $30,000 will now cost them less—just $20,000.
When U.S. interest rates rise as a result of an open market sale by the Fed, we 
expect exports to decrease and imports to increase, decreasing net exports. The decrease 
in net exports will reduce the demand for U.S. goods and lead to a fall in output. Here 
is the sequence of events:

To summarize, an increase in interest rates will reduce both investment spend-
ing (including consumer durables) and net exports. A decrease in interest rates will 
increase investment spending and net exports. As you can see, monetary policy in an 
open economy is even more powerful than monetary policy used in a closed economy.

Chapter 14 • The Federal Reserve and Monetary Policy

The Fed and other central banks are well aware of the power they have to influ-
ence exchange rates and international trade. Countries that depend extensively on inter-
national trade—such as Canada and Switzerland—find that the effects of monetary policy 
on exchange rates are critical to their economic well-being.
Monetary Policy Challenges for the Fed
Now that we have seen how changes in the money supply affect aggregate demand, 
we can see that the government has two different types of tools to change the level of 
GDP in the short run: The government can use either fiscal policy—changes in the 
level of taxes or government spending—or monetary policy—changes in the supply of 
money and interest rates—to alter the level of GDP.
If the current level of GDP is below full employment or potential output, the gov-
ernment can use expansionary policies such as tax cuts, increased spending, or increases 
in the money supply to raise the level of GDP and reduce unemployment. If the current 
level of GDP exceeds full employment or potential output, the economy will overheat, 
and the rate of inflation will increase. To avoid this overheating, the government can 
use contractionary policies to reduce the level of GDP back to full employment or 
potential output.
Earlier, we explored some of the limitations of stabilization policy. We saw that 
fiscal policy is subject to lags and fraught with complications because political parties 
have different ideas about what the government should or should not do, and it takes 
them time to reach agreement. Monetary policy also has its complications.
Lags in Monetary Policy
Recall that there are two types of lags in policy. Inside lags are the time it takes for 
policymakers to recognize and implement policy changes. Outside lags are the time it 
takes for policy to actually work.
The inside lags for monetary policy are relatively short compared to those for fiscal 
policy. The FOMC meets eight times a year and can decide on major policy changes at 
any time and very quickly. It can even give the chairperson of the Board of Governors 
some discretion to make changes between meetings.
Of course, it does take time for the people working at the Fed to recognize that 
problems are beginning to occur in the economy. A good example is the 1990 reces-
sion. In 1990, Iraq invaded Kuwait. After the invasion, there was some concern that 
higher oil prices and the uncertainty of the political situation in Kuwait would trig-
ger a recession in the United States, which, of course, is heavily dependent on oil. 
However, Alan Greenspan, then chairman of the Federal Reserve, testified before 
Congress as late as October 1990 that the economy had not yet slipped into a reces-
sion. Not until December did Greenspan declare that the economy had entered into a 
recession. Yet, looking back, we now know the recession had actually started 5 months 
earlier, in July.
The outside lags related to monetary policy, however, are quite long. Most 
econometric models predict it will take at least 2 years for most of the effects of an 
interest rate cut to be felt. This delay means that for the Fed to conduct successful 
monetary policy, it must be able to accurately forecast 2 years in the future! However, 
the Fed has difficulty predicting when recessions are about to occur. As an example, 
in May 2000 the Fed—fearing a rise in inflation—raised the federal funds rate from 
6.00 to 6.50 percent. Yet, on January 3, 2001, the Fed reversed itself and restored the 
rate to 6.00 percent because it feared a recession. It was too little—and too late—to 
prevent the 2001 recession. And the Fed also failed to predict our latest severe reces-
sion and did not believe the problems in the housing market would spill over to the 
financial sector.
Because of the lags for monetary policy and the difficulties of forecasting the econ-
omy, many economists believe the Fed should not take a very active role in trying to

stabilize the economy. Instead, they recommend the Fed concentrate on keeping the 
inflation rate low and stable.
Decisions about monetary policy are made by a committee. How does this affect 
the effectiveness of monetary policy?
Influencing Market Expectations: From the Federal Funds Rate 
to Interest Rates on Long-Term Bonds
It is important to recognize that through its traditional open market policies, the Fed 
directly controls only very short-term interest rates in the economy, not long-term 
interest rates. In fact, when the Fed makes its decisions on monetary policy, it really 
decides what the rate should be in the federal funds market—the market in which banks 
trade reserves overnight. Once the Fed decides what rate it wants in the market, it con-
ducts open market operations—buying and selling short-term government bonds—to 
achieve this rate. Thus, when the Federal Reserve decides the course of monetary 
policy, it is really just setting a very short-term interest rate for the economy.
However, when a firm is deciding on a long-term investment or a household is 
deciding whether to purchase a new home, it will base its decisions on the interest rate 
at which it can borrow money, and this will typically be a long-term interest rate—not 
a short-term rate. For example, a household might take out a 30-year mortgage to 
purchase a home. If the rate is too high, it might not take out the loan. So for the Fed 
to control investment spending it must also somehow influence long-term rates. It can 
do this indirectly by influencing short-term rates. Here’s how.
Long-term interest rates can be thought of as averages of current and expected 
future short-term interest rates. To see why future short-term interest rates are impor-
tant, consider putting $100 of your money in the bank for 2 years. If the interest rate 
is 5 percent for the first year, you would have $105 at the end of that year. If the 
interest rate for the following year were 10 percent, you would then have $115.50 
($105 * 1.10) at the end of the second year. Both the current short-term interest rate 
(5 percent) and next year’s short-term interest rate (10 percent) would determine the 
value of your bank account. Similarly, both the current short-term interest rate and 
future short-term rates determine the present value of payments in the future on a bond 
or loan. Long-term interest rates are an average of the current short-term interest rate 
and expected future short-term rates.
The Fed can directly control the federal funds rate and other short-term interest 
rates. Its actions also provide information to the market about the likely course for 
future short-term rates. If the Fed wishes to stimulate long-term investment by cutting 
the short-term interest rate, it must also convince the public that it will keep future 
short-term rates low as well in order to reduce long-term interest rates. Influencing 
expectations of the financial markets is an important part of the Fed’s job.
The Fed does try to communicate its general intentions for future policy actions to 
the public to help make those policies more effective. However, the public ultimately 
must form its own expectations of what the Fed is going to do. Coping with financial 
market expectations complicates the Fed’s task in developing monetary policy. The Fed 
itself has debated how best to communicate with the financial markets.
To further complicate matters, the Fed can also monitor the public’s expectations 
of its future policies in the financial markets. There are now “futures” markets for the 
federal funds rates in which market participants essentially place bets on future federal 
funds rates. Thus, before the Fed takes any actions on interest rates or even makes any 
statements about its future intentions, it can see what the market is thinking. The Fed 
has to decide whether to take actions consistent with market expectations of Fed actions 
or to surprise the market in some way.
In recent years, the Fed has taken several steps to better control expectations 
about long-term interest rates. The first step was to purchase and sell long-term 
bonds directly, the policy known as quantitative easing. By intervening directly in 
the long-term bond market, the Fed hoped to gain more control over long-term 
interest rates.

335
The other step the Fed has taken was to ask the members of the FOMC for their 
predictions of short-term interest rates in the future and to make those public. While 
the members can always vote different interest rates in the future, making their predic-
tions public at least lets the markets know what the current members of the FOMC 
believe will be the future course of monetary policy.
This chapter showed 
how monetary policy 
affects aggregate 
demand and the econ-
omy in the short run. 
Together, the demand 
for money by the pub-
lic and the supply of 
money determined by 
the Federal Reserve 
determine interest 
rates. Changes in interest rates will in turn affect investment and out-
put. In the international economy, interest rates also affect exchange 
rates and net exports. Still, there are limits to what effective monetary 
policies can do. Here are the main points of the chapter:
1.	 The demand for money depends negatively on the interest rate 
and positively on the level of prices and real GDP.
2.	 The Fed can determine the supply of money through open mar-
ket purchases and sales, changing reserve requirements, chang-
ing the discount rate, or increasing lending to banks and other 
institutions. Open market operations are the primary tool the Fed 
uses to implement monetary policy.
3.	 The level of interest rates is determined in the money market by 
the demand for money and the supply of money.
4.	 To increase the level of GDP, the Federal Reserve buys bonds 
on the open market. To decrease the level of GDP, the Federal 
Reserve sells bonds on the open market.
5.	 An increase in the money supply will decrease interest rates, 
increase investment spending, and increase output. A decrease 
in the money supply will increase interest rates, decrease invest-
ment spending, and decrease output.
6.	 In an open economy, a decrease in interest rates will depreci-
ate the local currency and lead to an increase in net exports. 
Conversely, an increase in interest rates will appreciate the local 
currency and lead to a decrease in net exports.
7.	 Both lags in economic policies and the need to influence mar-
ket expectations make successful monetary policy difficult in 
practice.

The Money Market
Explain the role of demand and supply in the money market.
1.1	 We measure the opportunity cost of holding money 
with _________.
1.2	 If interest rate decreases, investment spending 
_________ (increases/decreases) and money demand 
_________ (increases/decreases).
1.3	 The principle of _________ suggests that the demand 
for money should increase as prices increase.
1.4	 The _________ demand for money aims to facilitate 
transactions based on individual desire.
1.5	 Checking Account Interest Rates. During the 1980s, 
banks started to pay interest (at low rates) on checking 
accounts for the first time. Given what you know about 
opportunity costs, how would interest paid on checking 
affect the demand for money?
1.6	 Using a simple demand-and-supply graph, ­demonstrate 
how an increase in money supply would change the 
money demand if a central bank pursues a ­policy of 
fixed interest rate at 5 percent per year. Explain what 
happens to transactions and the GDP in this case.
1.7	 An ATM Next to Your Apartment Building. Sup-
pose an ATM connected to your own bank is installed 
right next to your apartment building.
a.	 How will this affect the average amount of currency 
you carry around with you?
b.	If you withdraw funds at your ATM only from your 
checking account, will your action have any effect 
on total money demand?
1.8	 Flea Markets and the Demand for Money. People 
often like to visit flea markets to look for unexpected 
opportunities. Flea markets also typically use cash. 
Explain why this is an example of the liquidity demand 
for money.
How the Federal Reserve Can Change the Money 
Supply
List the tools that the Fed can use to change short-term 
interest rates.
2.1	 To increase the supply of money, the Fed should 
_________ bonds.
2.2	 An increase in price levels leads to _________ money 
demand.
2.3	 Banks trade reserves with one another in the _________ 
market.
2.4	 Banks borrow from the Fed at the _________ rate.
2.5	 Raising Interest Rates on Reserves. What would 
happen to the demand for money if a central bank low-
ered the interest rates it paid on services?
2.6	 China’s Increase in Reserve Requirements. The 
Chinese government purchased U.S. dollars in the for-
eign exchange market with Chinese currency. During 
the same period, the Chinese sharply raised the reserve 
requirement on banks because they wanted to prevent 
the money supply from expanding too rapidly. Explain 
carefully how these two actions, taken together, could 
keep the supply of money in China from increasing.
2.7	 The Fed’s Balance Sheet. In pursuing its policies of 
quantitative easing, the Fed increased the size of its bal-
ance sheet through purchases of assets. Since balance 
sheets have to “balance,” where was the Fed’s increase 
in liabilities? (Related to Application 1 on page 322.)
How Interest Rates Are Determined: Combining the 
Demand and Supply of Money
Demonstrate using supply and demand curves how the Fed 
can determine short-term interest rates.
3.1	 Interest rates typically rise in booms because the 
demand for money depends _________ on changes in 
real income.
3.2	 If interest rates are 12 percent per year, the price of a 
bond that promises to pay $100 next year will be equal 
to _________.
3.3	 Through its effect on money demand, an increase in 
prices will _________ interest rates.
3.4	 Open market purchases lead to rising bond prices and 
_________ interest rates.
3.5	 Pricing a Bond. If a bond promises to pay $150 next 
year and the interest rate is 7 percent per year:
a.	 What will the price of the bond be?
b.	What will the new price of the bond be if the inter-
est rate rises to 9 percent?
3.6	 Buy or Sell Bonds? If you strongly believed the Fed-
eral Reserve was going to surprise the markets and 
raise interest rates, would you want to buy bonds or 
sell bonds?
3.7	 Recessions and Interest Rates. The economy starts 
to head into a recession. Using a graph of the money 
market, show what happens to interest rates. What 
happens to bond prices?
All problems are assignable in MyLab Economics. 

337
3.8	 A Decrease in the Riskiness of the Stock Market. 
If investors began to think that the stock market is 
becoming riskier, how will this belief affect the specula-
tive demand for money? Would this more likely affect 
M1 or M2?
3.9	 Should the Fed Buy Stocks? Could the Fed purchase 
a wide variety of stocks in the market in order to raise 
the price of stocks? Do you see any potential problems 
with this policy?
Interest Rates and How They Change Investment and 
Output (GDP)
Describe both the domestic and international channels 
through which monetary policy can affect real GDP.
4.1	 When the Federal Reserve buys bonds on the open 
market, it leads to _________ (increase/decreases) in 
the price of bonds.
4.2	 To decrease the level of output, the Fed should conduct 
an open market _________ (sale/purchase) of bonds.
4.3	 An open market sale _________ the supply of money, 
which _________ interest rates, which _________ 
investment, and finally results in a(n) _________ in 
output.
4.4	 A decrease in the supply for money will _________ 
(appreciate/depreciate) a country’s currency. 
4.5	 Interest Rates, Durable Goods, and Nondurable 
Goods. Refrigerators and clothing are to some extent 
durable. Explain why the decision to purchase a refrig-
erator is likely to be more sensitive to interest rates 
than the decision to buy clothing.
4.6	 Where is Monetary Policy Stronger? In an open 
economy, changes in monetary policy affect both inter-
est rates and exchange rates. Comparing the United 
States and the United Kingdom, in which country 
would monetary policy have a more significant effect 
on GDP through changes in exchange rates?
4.7	 Commodity Prices, the Dollar, and Monetary 
Policy. Suppose the U.S. is a major source of demand 
for world commodities and supplies of commodities 
are limited. Describe how an expansionary monetary 
policy could affect commodity prices, both through a 
domestic and international channel. What would be 
the relationship one would observe between the value 
of the dollar and commodity prices following a mone-
tary expansion? (Related to Application 2 on page 325.)
Monetary Policy Challenges for the Fed
Assess the challenges the Fed faces in implementing 
monetary policy.
5.1	 _________ (Inside/Outside) lags would be longer for 
the European Central Bank.
5.2	 Compared to fiscal policy, the outside lag for monetary 
policy is longer for monetary policy. _________ (True/
False)
5.3	 Current and future short-term interest rates can be 
_________ (increased/decreased) in order to reduce 
long-term interest rates.
5.4	 The Fed directly controls long-term interest rates. 
_________ (True/False)
5.5	 Open Economies and Outside Lags in Monetary 
Policy. Research suggests that the effects of monetary 
policy through interest rates, exchange rates, and net 
exports are more rapid than the effects of monetary 
policy on investment. As an economy becomes more 
open, how will this change affect the outside lag in 
monetary policy?
5.6	 Asset Prices as a Guide to Monetary Policy? Some 
central bankers have looked at asset prices, such as 
prices of stocks, to guide monetary policy. The idea is 
that if stock prices begin to rise, it might signal future 
inflation or an overheated economy. Are there any dan-
gers to using the stock market as a guide to monetary 
policy?
5.7	 Rates on Two-Year Bonds and One-Year Bonds. 
Suppose the interest rate on a 2-year bond was higher 
than the interest rate on a 1-year bond. What does the 
market believe will happen next year to 1-year interest 
rates?
5.8	 International Influences on Fed Policy. As inter-
national trade becomes more important, monetary 
policy becomes more heavily influenced by develop-
ments in the foreign exchange markets. Go to the 
Web page of the Federal Reserve where they have 
the speeches (http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/
speech/2015speech.htm) and read some recent speeches 
given by Fed officials. Do international considerations 
seem to affect policymakers in the United States 
today?
5.9	 Are Federal Reserve Chairmen Too Powerful? 
Economic research has shown that the chairman of 
the Federal Reserve is more powerful, relative to other 
committee members, than the head of the central bank 
in other countries. Fed chairpersons have much more 
influence over actual decisions than other members. 
Recall Professor Blinder’s findings that committees 
make better decisions than individuals and that leaders 
of groups, per se, do not matter for the quality of deci-
sion making. Make an argument that the tradition of a 
strong chairman in the United States reduces the effec-
tiveness of monetary policy. (Related to ­Application 3 
on page 329.)
5.10	 Making Future Predictions Explicit Recently the 
members of the FOMC have been asked to make pre-
dictions for future interest rates and then these have 
been made public. What is the rationale for this policy?

Modern Macroeconomics: 
From the Short Run to the 
Long Run
15
C h a p t e r
By most appearances the 
economy had recovered 
from the deep 2007 
recession by 2015, But 
doubts linger.
From a peak unemployment rate of 10.0 per-
cent in October 2009—4 months after the 
recession ended—the unemployment rate had 
fallen to 5.5 percent, which is a typical estimate 
for the natural rate of unemployment. From 
March 2010 to March 2015, there was posi-
tive job growth for 61 months—breaking all past 
records for consecutive job growth. The stock 
market was near an all-time high and interest rates were very low, allowing potential homeowners to afford mort-
gages. Many economists believe we have reached full employment.
But to others it did not seem like the economy had fully recovered. The labor force participation rate was at a 
decade-long low and average real wages had grown very little in recent years. The congressional budget office had 
lowered its estimate of potential GDP from prior years, indicating that they believed the economy would no longer 
reach the levels that they had previously projected. And some prominent economists have suggested that the U.S. 
economy no longer has the capacity to return to full employment by itself, even after a long adjustment process.

Chapter 15 • Modern Macroeconomics: From the Short Run to the Long Run
339
O
ne of the great debates surrounding macroeconomic policymaking centers on 
the short run versus the long run. Up to this point in the book, we have dis-
cussed the short and long run separately. Now, however, we explain how the 
economy evolves from the short run to the long run. The relationship between the two 
is one of the most important dimensions of modern macroeconomics, which carefully 
distinguishes between them.
Linking the Short Run and the Long Run
To begin to understand how the short run and the long run are related, let’s return to 
what we mean by each in macroeconomics.
The Difference between the Short and Long Run
In Chapter 9, we explained how in the short run, wages and prices are sticky and do 
not change immediately in response to changes in demand. The short run in macro-
economics is the period of time over which prices do not change or do not change 
very much. Over time, though, wages and prices adjust, and the economy reaches its 
long-run equilibrium. Short-run analysis applies to the period when wages and prices 
do not change—at least not substantially. Long-run, full-employment economics 
applies after wages and prices have largely adjusted to changes in demand. The long 
run in macroeconomics is the period of time in which prices have fully adjusted to 
any economic changes.
In the short run, GDP is determined by the current demand for goods and services 
in the economy, so fiscal policy—such as tax cuts or increased government ­spending—
and monetary policy—such as adjusting the money supply—can affect demand and 
GDP. However, in the long run, GDP is determined by the supply of labor, the stock of 
capital, and technological progress—in other words, the willingness of people to work 
and the overall resources the economy has to work with. Full employment is another 
characteristic of the long run. Because the economy is operating at full employment 
in the long run, output can’t be increased in response to changes in demand. So, for 
example, an increase in government spending won’t increase GDP in the long run 
because spending on one good or service has to come at the expense of another good 
or service. Similarly, increasing the supply of money won’t increase GDP in the long 
run either. It will only cause the price level in the economy to rise.
Should economic policy be guided by what we expect to happen in the short run 
or what we expect to happen in the long run? To answer this question, we need to 
know two things:
1	 How does what happens in the short run determine what happens in the long run?
2	 How long is the short run?
Wages and Prices and Their Adjustment over Time
Wages and prices change every day. If the demand for scooters rises at the same time 
that demand for tennis rackets falls, we would expect to see a rise in the price of scoot-
ers and a fall in the price of tennis rackets. Wages in the scooter industry would tend 
to increase, and wages in the tennis racket industry would tend to fall.
Sometimes, we see wages and prices in all industries rising or falling together. 
For example, prices for steel, automobiles, food, and fuel may all rise together. Why? 
Wages and prices will all tend to increase together during booms when GDP exceeds 
its full-employment level or potential output. Wages and prices will fall together dur-
ing periods of recessions when GDP falls below full employment or potential output.
If the economy is producing at a level above full employment, firms will find it 
increasingly difficult to hire and retain workers, and unemployment will be below its 
natural rate. Workers will find it easy to get and change jobs. To attract workers and

prevent them from leaving, firms will raise their wages. As one firm raises its wage, 
other firms will have to raise their wages even higher to attract the workers that remain.
Wages are the largest cost of production for most firms. Consequently, as labor 
costs increase, firms have no choice but to increase the prices of their products. How-
ever, as prices rise, workers need higher nominal wages to maintain their real wages. 
This is an illustration of the real-nominal principle.
wage–price spiral
The process by which changes in wages 
and prices cause further changes in wages 
and prices.
This process by which rising wages cause higher prices and higher prices feed 
higher wages is known as a wage–price spiral. It occurs when the economy is produc-
ing at a level of output that exceeds its potential.
When the economy is producing below full employment or potential output, the 
process works in reverse. Unemployment will exceed the natural rate. Firms will find it 
easy to hire and retain workers, and they can offer workers less. As all firms cut wages, 
the average level of wages in the economy falls. As we have said, wages are the largest 
component of firms’ costs. So, when wages fall, prices start to fall, too. In this case, the 
wage–price spiral works in reverse.

Secular Stagnation?
Applying the Concepts #1: Why have some economists revived the idea of “secular stagnation”?
That is, until Lawrence Summers, former U.S. Secretary 
of the Treasury and President of Harvard University, recently 
resurrected the theory. Summers believes that a series of 
structural factors have decreased the demand for investment 
goods and interest rates cannot fall far enough to create suf-
ficient aggregate demand. Summers has argued that the only 
reason that the U.S. economy has been able to have suffi-
cient demand during the last few decades is that easy credit 
fueled a stock market boom in the late 1990s and later the 
housing boom in the 2000s. Of course, both these episodes 
ended in recessions. Without easy credit, the economy sim-
ply does not generate enough demand. Summers suggests 
that increased spending on infrastructure makes sense at 
this time.
Critics of this viewpoint out that the economy has grown 
consistently since the last recession and the unemployment rate 
in 2015 was at or close to the natural rate. They also argue that 
infrastructure spending may be a good idea, but it is not neces-
sary for the economy to operate at full employment.  Related to 
Exercise 2.7.

In the 1930s Alvin Hansen, an American follower of John 
­Maynard Keynes, argued that the U.S. economy suffered from 
the disease of secular stagnation. According to this theory, there 
was not enough aggregate demand to bring the economy to full 
employment and the natural adjustment process would not work 
as interest rates could not fall far enough. The only remedy for 
secular stagnation was increased government spending. How-
ever, as World War II brought sufficient aggregate demand, the 
theory of secular stagnation largely disappeared.

What matters to people is the real value of money or income—its 
purchasing power—not the face value of money or income.

In summary, when output exceeds potential output, wages and prices throughout the 
economy will rise above previous inflation rates. If output is less than potential output, 
wages and prices will fall relative to previous inflation rates.
How Wage and Price Changes Move the Economy 
Naturally Back to Full Employment
The transition between the short run and the long run is easy to understand. If GDP 
is higher than potential output, the economy starts to overheat and wages and prices 
increase. This increase in wages and prices will then push the economy back to full 
employment.
Using aggregate demand and aggregate supply, we can illustrate graphically how 
changing prices and wages help move the economy from the short to the long run. 
First, let’s review the graphical representations of aggregate demand and aggregate 
supply:
1	 Aggregate demand. Recall that the aggregate demand curve shows the relation-
ship between the level of prices and the quantity of real GDP demanded.
2	 Aggregate supply. Also recall that there are two aggregate supply curves: one for 
the short run and one for the long run. The short-run aggregate supply curve 
is represented as a relatively flat curve. The shape of the curve reflects the idea 
that prices do not change very much in the short run and that firms adjust produc-
tion to meet demand. The long-run aggregate supply curve, however, is rep-
resented by a perfectly vertical line. The vertical line means that at any given price 
level, firms in the long run are producing all that they can, given the amount of 
labor, capital, and technology available to them in the economy. The line repre-
sents what firms can supply in the long run at a state of full employment or 
potential output.
Returning to Full Employment from a Recession
In an earlier chapter, we looked at the adjustment process for an economy producing 
at a level of output exceeding full employment or potential output. Now let’s look 
at what happens if the economy is in a slump, producing below full employment or 
potential output. Panel A of Figure 15.1 shows an aggregate demand curve and the 
two aggregate supply curves. In the short run, output and prices are determined where 
the aggregate demand curve intersects the short-run aggregate supply curve—point a. 
This point corresponds to the level of output y0 and a price level P0. Notice that y0 is 
a level less than full employment or potential output, yp. In the long run, the level of

Table 15.1  Unemployment, Output, and Wage and Price Changes
Table 15.1 summarizes our discussion of unemployment, output, and changes in 
wages. Let’s emphasize one point: In addition to the changes in wages and prices that 
occur when the economy is producing at more or less than full employment, there is 
also typically ongoing inflation in the economy. For example, suppose an economy that 
has been operating at full employment has been experiencing 4 percent annual infla-
tion. If output later exceeds full employment, prices will begin to rise at a rate faster 
than 4 percent. Conversely, if output falls to a level less than full employment, prices 
will then rise at a slower rate than 4 percent.

prices and output is given by the intersection of the aggregate demand curve and the 
long-run aggregate supply curve—point c. Output is at full employment, yp, and prices 
are at PF. How does the economy move from point a in the short run to point c in the 
long run? Panel B shows us how.
At point a, the current level of output, y0, falls short of the full-employment level 
of output, yp. With output less than full employment, the unemployment rate is above 
the natural rate. Firms find it relatively easy to hire and retain workers, and wages and 
then prices begin to fall. As the level of prices decreases, the short-run aggregate sup-
ply curve shifts downward over time, as shown in Panel B. This downward shift occurs 
because decreases in wages lower costs for firms. Competition between firms will lead 
to lower prices for their products.
As shown in Panel B, this shift in the short-run aggregate supply curve will bring 
the economy to long-run equilibrium. The economy initially starts at point a, where 
output falls short of full employment. As prices fall from P0 to P1, the aggregate supply 
curve shifts downward from AS0 to AS1. The aggregate demand curve and the new 
aggregate supply curve intersect at point b. This point corresponds to a lower level of 
prices and a higher level of real output. However, the higher level of output still is less 
than full employment. Wages and prices will continue to fall, shifting the short-run 
aggregate supply curve downward.
Eventually, the aggregate supply curve will shift to AS2, and the economy will reach 
point c, the intersection of the aggregate demand curve and the long-run aggregate sup-
ply curve. At this point, the adjustment stops because the economy is at full employment 
and the unemployment rate is at the natural rate. With unemployment at the natural 
rate, the downward wage–price spiral ends. The economy has made the transition to 
the long run. Prices are lower and output returns to full employment. This is how an 
economy recovers from a recession or a downturn.
Returning to Full Employment from a Boom
But what if the economy is “too hot” instead of sluggish? What will then happen is 
the process we just described, only in reverse, as we show in Figure 15.2. When out-
put exceeds potential, unemployment will be below the natural rate. As firms bid for 
labor, the wage–price spiral will begin, but this time in an upward direction instead of 
downward as in Panel B. The short-run aggregate supply curve will shift upward until 
the economy returns to full employment. That is, wages and prices will rise to return 
the economy to its long-run equilibrium at full employment.
▲  Figure 15.1  How the Economy Recovers from a Downturn
If the economy is operating below full employment, as shown in Panel A, prices will fall, shifting down the

Economic Policy and the Speed of Adjustment
How long does it take to move from the short run to the long run? Economists dis-
agree on the answer. Some economists estimate it takes the U.S. economy 2 years or 
less, some say 6 years, and others say somewhere in between. Because the adjustment 
process is slow, there is room, in principle, for policymakers to step in and guide the 
economy back to full employment.
Suppose the economy is operating below full employment at point a in Figure 15.3. 
One alternative for policymakers is to do nothing, allowing the economy to adjust itself 
with falling wages and prices until it returns by itself to full employment, point b. This 
may take several years. During that time, the economy will experience excess unem-
ployment and a level of real output below potential.
Another alternative is to use expansionary policies, such as open market purchases by 
the Fed or increases in government spending and tax cuts, to shift the aggregate demand 
curve to the right. In Figure 15.3, we show how expansionary policies could shift the 
aggregate demand curve from AD0 to AD1 and move the economy to full employment, 
point c. Notice here that the price level is higher at point c than it would be at point b.
Demand policies can also prevent a wage–price spiral from emerging if the econ-
omy is producing at a level of output above full employment. Rather than letting an 
increase in wages and prices bring the economy back to full employment, we can reduce 
aggregate demand. Either contractionary monetary policy—open-market sales—or 
contractionary fiscal policy—cuts in government spending or tax increases—can be 
used to reduce aggregate demand and the level of GDP until it reaches potential output.
Expansionary policies and demand policies are stabilization policies, which look 
simple on paper or on graphs. In practice, the lags and uncertainties we discussed for 
both fiscal and monetary policy make economic stabilization difficult to achieve. For 
example, suppose we are in a recession and the Fed decides to increase aggregate demand 
using expansionary monetary policy. There will be a lag in the time it takes for the aggre-
gate demand curve to shift to the right. In the meantime, the adjustment that occurs 
In summary:
• If output is less than full employment, prices will fall as the economy returns to 
full employment, as shown in Figure 15.1.
• If output exceeds full employment, prices will rise and output will fall back to full 
employment, as shown in Figure 15.2.

during a recession—falling wages and prices—has begun to shift the short-run aggregate 
supply curve downward. It is conceivable that if the adjustment were fast enough, the 
economy would be restored to full employment before the effects of the expansionary 
monetary policy were actually felt. When the expansionary monetary policy kicks in and 
the aggregate demand curve finally shifts to the right, the additional aggregate demand 
would increase the level of output so it exceeded the full-employment level, leading to 
a wage–price spiral. In this case, monetary policy would have destabilized the economy.
Active economic policies are more likely to destabilize the economy if the adjust-
ment is quick enough. Economists like Milton Friedman (1912–2006) of the University 
of Chicago believed the economy adjusts rapidly to full employment and generally 
opposed using monetary or fiscal policy to try to stabilize the economy. Economists 
like John Maynard Keynes believed that the economy adjusted slowly and were more 
sympathetic to using monetary or fiscal policy to stabilize the economy.
It is possible that the speed of adjustment can vary over time, making decisions 
about policy even more difficult. As an example, economic advisers for President 
George H. W. Bush had to decide whether the economy needed any additional 
stimulus after the recession of 1990. Based on the view that the economy would 
recover quickly on its own, they took only some minor steps. The economy did 
largely recover by the very end of the Bush administration, but too late for his 
reelection prospects.
Liquidity Traps or Zero Lower Bound
Up to this point, we have assumed the economy could always recover from a recession 
without active policy, although it may take a long time. Economist John Maynard 
Keynes expressed doubts about whether a country could recover from a major recession 
without active policy. He had two distinct reasons for these doubts. First, as we discuss 
later in the chapter, the adjustment process requires interest rates to fall and thereby 
increase investment spending. But suppose nominal interest rates become so low that 
they could not fall any further. Keynes called this situation a liquidity trap. Today, this 
is known as the zero lower bound for interest rates—that is, they cannot fall below zero.
When the economy is experiencing a liquidity trap or the zero lower bound, 
the adjustment process no longer works. Second, Keynes feared falling prices could 
liquidity trap
A situation in which nominal interest rates 
are so low, they can no longer fall; also 
known as the zero lower bound.
▲  Figure 15.3  Using Economic Policy to Fight a Recession

could be implemented to increase aggregate demand from AD0 to AD1 to bring the economy to full

hurt businesses. Japan seems to have suffered from both these problems in the 
1990s and the United States faced similar issues during the first decade of this 
century.
Political Business Cycles
Up to now, we have assumed policymakers are motivated to use policy to try to improve 
the economy. But suppose they are more interested in promoting their personal well-
being and the fortunes of their political parties? Using monetary or fiscal policy in the 
short run to improve a politician’s reelection prospects may generate what is known as 
a political business cycle.
Here is how a political business cycle might work. About a year or so before an 
election, a politician might use expansionary monetary policy or fiscal policy to stimu-
late the economy and lower unemployment. If voters respond favorably to lower unem-
ployment, the incumbent politician may be reelected. After reelection, the politician 
faces the prospect of higher prices or crowding out. To avoid this, the politician may 
engage in contractionary policies. The result is a classic political business cycle: Because 
of actions taken by politicians for reelection, the economy booms before an election but 
contracts afterward. Good news comes before the election, and bad news comes later.
It is clear the classic political business cycle does not always occur; however, a 
number of episodes fit the scenario. President Richard Nixon used expansionary poli-
cies during a reelection campaign in 1972, which resulted in inflation. However, coun-
terexamples also exist, such as President Jimmy Carter’s deliberate attempt to reduce 
inflation with contractionary policies just before his reelection bid in the late 1970s. 
Although the evidence on the classic political business cycle is mixed, there may be 
links between elections and economic outcomes. More recent research has investi-
gated the systematic differences that may exist between political parties and economic 
outcomes. All this research takes into account both the short- and long-run effects of 
economic policies.

more weight on reducing unemployment. Economists and politi-
cal scientists began to incorporate these partisan effects into 
their analyses.
The second major innovation was to recognize that the 
public would anticipate that politicians will try to manipulate 
the economy. Suppose that, if elected, Republicans will contract 
the economy to fight inflation, whereas Democrats will stimu-
late the economy to lower unemployment. If the public is not 
sure who will win the election, the outcome will be a surprise 
to them—a contractionary surprise if Republicans win and an 
expansionary surprise if Democrats win. As Professor Alberto 
Alesina of Harvard University first pointed out, this suggests that 
economic growth should be less if Republicans win and greater 
if Democrats win. The postwar U.S. evidence is generally sup-
portive of this theory.  Related to Exercise 2.9.

The Economics Behind the Adjustment Process
Earlier in the chapter we explained that changes in wages and prices restore the econ-
omy to full employment in the long run, and that the government and the Fed can get 
it there more quickly with fiscal and monetary policy. But what is happening behind 
the scenes? What do changes in wages and the price level mean for the economy in 
terms of money demand, interest rates, and investment spending? Let’s go back and 
take a closer look at the adjustment process in terms of these factors so we can better 
understand how the adjustment process actually works.
First, recall that when an economy is producing below full employment, the ten-
dency will be for wages and prices to fall. Similarly, when an economy is producing at 
a level exceeding full employment or potential output, the tendency will be for wages 
and prices to rise.
The adjustment process first begins to work as changes in prices affect the demand 
for money. Recall the real-nominal principle.

What matters to people is the real value of money or income—its 
purchasing power—not the face value of money or income.
According to this principle, the amount of money people want to hold depends on 
the price level in the economy. If prices are cut in half, you need to hold only half as 
much money to purchase the same goods and services. Decreases in the price level will 
cause the money demand curve to shift to the left; increases in the price level will shift 
it to the right. Now let’s put this idea to use.
Suppose the economy is initially in a recession. With output below full employ-
ment, actual unemployment will exceed the natural rate of unemployment, so there will 
be excess unemployment. Wages and prices will start to fall. Figure 15.4 shows how the 
fall in the price level can restore the economy to full employment via money demand, 
interest rates, and investment without active fiscal or monetary policy. First, we show 
with the AD–AS diagram in Panel A of Figure 15.4 how prices fall when the economy is 
▲  Figure 15.4  How the Changing Price Level Restores the Economy to Full Employment
With the economy initially below full employment, the price level falls, as shown in Panel A, stimulating output. 
In Panel B, the lower price level decreases the demand for money and leads to lower interest rates at point d. 
In Panel C, lower interest rates lead to higher investment spending at point f. As the economy moves down 
the aggregate demand curve from point a toward full employment at point b in Panel A, investment spending 
increases along the aggregate demand curve.

operating below full employment. Second, in Panel B, the fall in the price level decreases 
the demand for holding money. As the price level decreases from P0 to P1, the demand 
for money shifts to the left from M0
d to M1
d. Interest rates fall from r0 to r1, and the falling 
interest rates increase investment spending from I0 to I1. As the level of investment spend-
ing in the economy increases, total demand for goods and services also increases, and the 
economy moves down along the aggregate demand curve as it returns to full employment.
Now you can also understand why the aggregate demand curve is downward-
sloping through the interest rate effect. As we move down the aggregate demand curve, 
lower prices lead to lower interest rates, higher investment spending, and a higher level 
of aggregate demand. Thus, aggregate demand increases as the price level falls, which 
explains why the curve slopes downward.
What we have just described continues until the economy reaches full employ-
ment. As long as actual output is below the economy’s full-employment level, prices 
will continue to fall. A fall in the price level reduces money demand and interest rates.
Lower interest rates stimulate investment spending and push the economy back 
toward full employment. All this works in reverse if output exceeds the economy’s 
potential output. In this case, the economy is overheating and wages and prices rise. 
A higher price level will increase the demand for money and raise interest rates. 
Higher interest rates will decrease investment spending and reduce the level of output. 
The process continues until the economy “cools off” and returns to full employment.
Now you should understand why changes in wages and prices restore the economy 
to full employment. The key is that (1) changes in wages and prices change the demand 
for money, and (2) this changes interest rates, which then affect aggregate demand for 
goods and services and ultimately GDP.
We can also use the model we just developed to understand the liquidity trap and 
the economics of the zero lower bound. If an economy is in a recession, interest rates 
will fall, restoring the economy to full employment. But at some point, interest rates 
may become so low they equal zero. Nominal interest rates cannot go far below zero 
because investors would rather hold money (which pays a zero rate) than hold a bond 
that promises a negative return. Suppose, however, that as interest rates approach 
zero, the economy is still in a slump. The adjustment process then has nowhere to go. 
This appears to be what happened in Japan in the 1990s. Interest rates on government 
bonds were zero, but prices continued to fall. At this point, the fall in prices by itself 
could not restore the economy to full employment. Policymakers in the United States 
also became concerned by this possibility. When interest rates on 3-month U.S. gov-
ernment bills fell below 1 percent from June 2003 to May 2004, Fed officials openly 
discussed their limited options if further monetary stimulus became necessary.
What can policymakers do if an economy is in a recession but nominal rates 
become so close to zero that the natural adjustment process ceases to work? Economists 
have suggested several solutions to this problem. First, expansionary fiscal policy—­
cutting taxes or raising government spending—still remains a viable option to increase 
­aggregate demand. Second, the Fed could become extremely aggressive and try to 
expand the money supply so rapidly that the public begins to anticipate future inflation. 
If the public expects inflation, the expected real rate of interest (the nominal rate minus 
the expected inflation rate) can become negative, even if the nominal rate cannot fall 
below zero. A negative expected real interest rate will tempt firms to invest, and this 
will increase aggregate demand. Finally, by paying interest on bank reserves, the Fed 
can give itself more leverage for controlling the supply of loans. Even though a liquid-
ity trap may make it more difficult for an economy to recover on its own, there is still 
room for proper economic policy to have an impact.
The Long-Run Neutrality of Money
An increase in the money supply has a different effect on the economy in the short 
run than it does in the long run. In Figure 15.5, we show the effects of expansionary 
monetary policy in both the short run and the long run. In the short run, as the supply 

part 6
348
of money increases, the economy moves from the original equilibrium to point a, with 
output above potential. But in the long run, the economy returns to point b at full 
employment, but at a higher price level than at the original equilibrium. How can the 
Federal Reserve change the level of output in the short run but affect prices only in the 
long run? Why is the short run different from the long run? We can use our model of 
the demand for money and investment to understand this issue.
Assume the economy starts at full employment. In Figure 15.6, interest rates are at rF, 
and investment spending is at IF. Now, suppose the Federal Reserve increases the money 
supply from M0
s to M1
s We show this as a rightward movement in the money-supply curve. 
In the short run, the increase in the supply of money will reduce interest rates to r0, and 
the level of investment spending will increase to I0. Increased investment will stimulate 
the economy and increase output above full employment. All this occurs in the short run. 
The red arrows show the movements in interest rates and investment in the short run.
However, once output exceeds full employment, wages and prices will start to 
increase. As the price level increases, the demand for money will increase. This will 
shift the money-demand curve upward and will start to increase interest rates. Invest-
ment will start to fall as interest rates increase, leading to a fall in output. The blue 
arrows in Figure 15.6 show the transition as prices increase. As long as output exceeds

We show these changes with the red arrows. The blue arrows show that as the price level increases, 
the demand for money increases, restoring interest rates and investment to their prior levels—rF and IF, 
respectively. Both money supplied and money demanded will remain at a higher level, though, at point e.

full employment, prices will continue to rise, money demand will continue to increase, 
and interest rates will continue to rise. Where does this process end? It ends only when 
interest rates return to their original level of rF. At an interest rate of rF, investment 
spending will have returned to IF. This is the level of investment that meets the total 
level of demand for goods and services and keeps the economy at full employment.
When the economy returns to full employment, the levels of real interest rates, 
investment, and output are precisely the same as they were before the Fed increased 
the supply of money. The increase in the supply of money had no effect on real interest 
rates, investment, or output in the long run. Economists call this the long-run 
­neutrality of money. In other words, in the long run, changes in the supply of money 
are neutral with respect to real variables in the economy. For example, if the price of 
everything in the economy doubles, including your paycheck, you are no better or 
worse off than you were before. In the long run, increases in the supply of money have 
no effect on real variables, only on prices.
This example points out how, in the long run, it really does not matter how much 
money is in circulation because prices will adjust to the amount of nominal money 
available. In the short run, however, money is not neutral. In the short run, changes in 
the supply of money do affect interest rates, investment spending, and output. The Fed 
does have strong powers over real GDP, but those powers are ultimately temporary. In 
the long run, all the Fed can do is determine the level of prices in the economy.
Now we can understand why the job of the Federal Reserve has been described 
by William McChesney Martin, Jr., a former Federal Reserve chairman, as “taking 
the punch bowl away at the party.” The punch bowl is money: If the Fed sets out the 
punch bowl, this will temporarily increase output or give the economy a brief high. But 
if the Federal Reserve is worried about increases in prices in the long run, it must take 
the punch bowl away and everyone must sober up. If not, the result will be continuing 
increases in prices, or inflation.
Crowding Out in the Long Run
Some economists are strong proponents of increasing government spending on defense 
or other programs to stimulate the economy. Critics, however, say increases in spend-
ing provide only temporary relief and ultimately harm the economy because govern-
ment spending crowds out investment spending. In an earlier chapter, we discussed the 
idea of crowding out. We can now understand the idea in more detail.
Suppose the economy starts out at full employment and then the government 
increases its spending. This will shift the aggregate demand curve to the right, causing 
output to increase beyond full employment. As we have seen, the result of this boom 
will be that wages and prices increase.
Now let’s turn to our model of money demand and investment. Figure 15.7 shows 
that as prices increase, the demand for money shifts upward in Panel A, raising interest 
rates from r0 to r1 and reducing investment from I0 to I1, as shown in Panel B. Higher 
interest rates are the mechanism through which crowding out of public investment 
occurs. As investment spending by the public then falls (gets crowded out), we know 
that aggregate demand decreases. This process will continue until the economy returns 
to full employment. Once the economy returns to full employment, the decrease in 
investment spending by the public will exactly match the increase in government 
spending. However, when the economy does return to full employment, it will be at a 
higher interest rate level and lower level of investment spending by the public.
Thus, the increase in government spending has no long-run effect on the level of 
output—just on the interest rate. Instead, the increase in government spending dis-
placed, or crowded out, private investment spending. If the government spending went 
toward government investment projects—such as bridges or roads—then it will have 
just replaced an equivalent amount of private investment. If the increased government 
spending did not go toward providing investment but, for example, went for military 
spending, then the reduction in private investment will have reduced total investment

A change in the supply of money has no 
effect on real interest rates, investment, or 
output in the long run.

Increasing Health-Care Expenditures and Crowding Out
Applying the Concepts #3: Will increases in health-care expenditures crowd out consumption 
or investment spending?
midcentury. Their argument is that as societies grow ­wealthier, 
individuals face the tradeoff of buying more goods (automo-
biles or cars) to enjoy their current lifespan or spending more on 
health care to extend their lives. At some point, the extra years 
of life become more valuable than consumer durables, with the 
result that spending on health care rises rapidly.
Assuming this argument is correct and health-care expendi-
tures increase, what other component of GDP will fall? If invest-
ment is crowded out this will mean that living standards would 
fall in the long run, reducing the ability to consume both health 
and nonhealth goods. Perhaps it is more likely that other types 
of consumption spending will fall. Spending on health would 
then come at the expense of spending on consumer durables 
or larger houses. That would be the preferred outcome.  Related 
to Exercise 3.7.
SOURCE: Based on Robert E. Hall and Charles I. Jones, “The Value of Life and 
the Rise in Health Spending,” Quarterly Journal of Economics (February 2007), 
pp. 39–72.
In 1950 health-care expenditures in the United States were 5.2 
percent of GDP; by 2000 this share had risen to 15.4 percent. 
Driving these increases were several factors: increasing relative 
prices of health care compared to other goods, a larger popu-
lation of older adults, and increased longevity. Since 1950 the 
average lifespan has increased by 1.7 years per decade.
Many observers think these trends will continue. Health-
care costs have continued to rise rapidly in recent years. Two 
economists, Charles I. Jones and Robert E. Hall, go further and 
suggest normal increases in economic growth will propel health-
care expenditures to approximately 30 percent of GDP by

in the economy, private and public. This decrease in total investment would have 
further negative effects on the economy over time. As we saw in earlier chapters, a 
reduction in investment spending reduces capital deepening and leads to lower levels 
of real income and wages in the future.
Economists make similar arguments when it comes to tax cuts. Tax cuts initially 
will increase consumer spending and lead to a higher level of GDP. In the long run, 
however, adjustments in wages and prices restore the economy to full employment. 
However, interest rates will rise during the adjustment process and this increase in 
interest rates will crowd out private investment. In the long run, the increase in con-
sumption spending will come at the expense of lower investment spending, decreased 
capital deepening, and lower levels of real income and wages in the future.
Crowding out can occur from sources other than the government. Expected 
increases in U.S. health-care expenditures will pose similar challenges to crowding out 
in the coming decades as well.
What about decreases in government spending or increases in taxes? Decreases in 
government spending, such as cuts in military spending, will lead to increases in invest-
ment in the long run, which we call crowding in. Initially, a decrease in government 
spending will cause a decrease in real GDP. But as prices fall, the demand for money 
will decrease, and interest rates will fall. Lower interest rates will crowd in investment 
as the economy returns to full employment. In the longer run, the higher investment 
spending will raise living standards through capital deepening. Increased taxes, to the 
extent they reduce consumption spending, will crowd in investment through precisely 
the same mechanism.
Classical Economics in Historical Perspective
The term classical economics refers to the work of the originators of modern eco-
nomic thought. Adam Smith was the first so-called classical economist. Other clas-
sical ­economists—Jean-Baptiste Say, David Ricardo, John Stuart Mill, and Thomas 
Malthus—developed their work during the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. 
Keynes first used the term classical model in the 1930s to contrast it with his Keynesian 
model, which emphasized the difficulties the economy could face in the short run. The 
ideas developed in this chapter can shed some light on a historical debate in economics 
about the role of full employment in modern Keynesian and classical thought.
Say’s Law
Classical economics is often associated with Say’s law, the doctrine that “supply cre-
ates its own demand.” To understand Say’s law, recall from our discussion of GDP 
accounting in Chapter 5 that production in an economy creates an equivalent amount 
of income. For example, if GDP is $10 trillion, then production is $10 trillion, and 
$10 trillion in income is generated. The classical economists argued that the $10 ­trillion 
of production also created $10 trillion in demand for current goods and services. This 
meant there could never be a shortage of demand for total goods and services in the 
economy, nor any excess.
But suppose consumers, who earned the income, decided to save rather than spend 
it. Wouldn’t this increase in saving lead to a shortfall in the total demand for goods 
and services? Wouldn’t, say, inventories of goods pile up in warehouses? Classical 
economists argued no, that the increase in savings would eventually find its way to an 
equivalent increase in investment spending by firms because the savings by households 
would eventually get channeled to firms via financial markets. As a result, spending on 
consumption and investment together would be sufficient so that all the goods and 
services produced in the economy would be purchased.
Keynes, on the other hand, argued that there could be situations in which total 
demand fell short of total production in the economy for extended periods of time. In 
particular, if consumers increased their savings, there was no guarantee that investment

spending would rise to offset the decrease in consumption. And if total spending did 
fall short of total demand, goods and services would go unsold. When producers could 
not sell their goods, they would cut back on production, and output in the economy 
would consequently fall, leading to a recession or depression.
Keynesian and Classical Debates
The debates between Keynesian and classical economists continued for several decades 
after Keynes developed his theories. In the 1940s, Professor Don Patinkin and Nobel 
Laureate Franco Modigliani clarified the conditions for which the classical model 
would hold true. In particular, they studied the conditions under which there would 
be sufficient demand for goods and services when the economy was at full employ-
ment. Both economists emphasized that one of the necessary conditions for the classi-
cal model to work was that wages and prices must be fully flexible—that is, they must 
adjust rapidly to changes in demand and supply.
If wages and prices are not fully flexible, then Keynes’s view that demand could fall 
short of production is more likely to hold true. We’ve seen that over short periods of 
time, wages and prices, indeed, are not fully flexible, so Keynes’s insights are important. 
However, over longer periods of time, wages and prices do adjust and the insights of 
the classical model are restored.
To help clarify the conditions under which the economy will return to full employ-
ment in the long run on its own, Patinkin and Modigliani developed the adjustment-
process model we used in this chapter. They highlighted many of the key points we 
emphasized, including the speed of the adjustment process and possible pitfalls, such 
as liquidity traps.
In Application 1, we discussed the views of those who believe in the theory of secu-
lar stagnation. They clearly would not be supporters of Say’s Law because they believe 
there is insufficient aggregate demand to restore the economy to full employment. 
They would support activist demand policies, particularly fiscal policies. However, 
economists who do believe in the natural adjustment process will be more skeptical 
about the effectiveness of fiscal policy and the ability of the government to stabilize the 
economy. These are perennial macroeconomic debates.
This chapter explained 
how the economy 
makes the transition 
from the short run to 
the long run. It also 
highlighted why mone-
tary and fiscal policies 
have different effects 
in the short run and in 
the long run. Under-
standing the distinction between the short run and the long run is 
critical to evaluating economic policy. Here are the main points to 
remember from this chapter:
1.	 The short run in macroeconomics refers to the period of time in 
which prices do not change very much. The long run in macro-
economics is the period over which prices have time to change 
in response to economic changes.
2.	 When output exceeds full employment, wages and prices rise 
faster than their past trends. If output is less than full employ-
ment, wages and prices fall relative to past trends.
3.	 The price changes that occur when the economy is away from 
full employment push the economy back to full employment. 
Economists disagree on the length of time this adjustment pro-
cess takes; estimates range from less than 2 years to 6 years.
4.	 Economic policies are most effective when the adjustment 
process is slow. However, to improve their chances of being 
reelected, politicians can take advantage of the difference 
between the short-run and long-run effects of economic 
policies.
5.	 If the economy is operating below full employment, falling wages 
and prices will reduce money demand and lower interest rates. 
The fall in interest rates will stimulate investment and lead the 
economy back to full employment.

Linking the Short Run and the Long Run
Describe the key difference between the short run and long 
run in macroeconomics.
1.1	 Wages and prices will fall when unemployment falls 
below its natural rate. _________ (True/False)
1.2	 The short run in macroeconomics is the time period 
over which _________ do not adjust to economic 
conditions.
1.3	 According to the logic of the wage–price spiral, an 
increase in wages leads to a(n) _________ in _________, 
which in turn leads to a(n) _________ in _________.
1.4	 An increase in aggregate demand increases the full 
employment output. _________ (True/False)
1.5	 Cost of Living Adjustments and the Wage–Price 
Spiral. Suppose organized labor has successfully bar-
gained for cost of living increases for its workers. That 
is, when prices rise—as measured by the CPI—wages 
are automatically adjusted by the same percentage. 
Would this make the economy more or less likely to 
experience a wage–price spiral?
1.6	 Unemployment and Wage Prices Changes. If the 
natural rate of unemployment is 6 percent and the 
actual rate of unemployment is 4 percent, how will 
wages and prices change? What is the actual rate of 
unemployment at which prices and wages will stop 
changing? 
How Wage and Price Changes Move the Economy 
­Naturally Back to Full Employment
Demonstrate graphically how the economy can return to full 
employment.
2.1	 If output is less than potential output, prices _________ 
and the short-run aggregate supply curve shifts _________.
2.2	 Output will automatically return to full employment 
in the long run if it deviates from full employment. 
_________ (True/False)
2.3	 An increase in money supply can further lower inter-
est rates if they are initially equal to zero. _________ 
(True/False)
2.4	 Supply Shocks and GDP. Recall that supply shocks 
are external events that shift the supply curve. These 
shocks shift the short-run aggregate supply curve. For 
example, the prolonged fall in oil prices that started 
in June 2015 will shift the short-run aggregate supply 
curve downward because firms’ costs have fallen and 
firms charge lower prices.
a.	 Based on the above analysis, some economists expect 
higher GDP in 2016. Assuming that an economy is 
initially at the full employment level, use the AS-AD 
model to explain how the fall in oil prices would 
affect the GDP in the short run and the long run. 
How will this affect the price level in the short run 
and long run? Graphically illustrate your answer. 
All problems are assignable in MyLab Economics.
6.	 The reverse occurs when output exceeds full employment. 
Increases in wages and prices will increase money demand and 
interest rates. As investment spending falls, the economy returns 
to full employment.
7.	 In the long run, increases in the supply of money are neutral. 
That is, increases in the money supply do not affect real interest 
rates, investment, or output. This characteristic is known as the 
long-run neutrality of money.
8.	 Increases in government spending will raise real interest rates 
and crowd out investment in the long run. Decreases in gov-
ernment spending will lower real interest rates and crowd in 
­investment in the long run.
9.	 The adjustment model in this chapter helps us to understand the 
debate between Keynes and the classical economists.

354
b.	On the other hand, some economists found that the 
fall in oil prices led to a significant cutback of capital 
spending by the energy industry in addition to boost-
ing consumer spending. Suppose consumer spend-
ing contributes more to the GDP than investment 
spending, thereby leading to a higher GDP and lower 
price level in the short run. Graphically illustrate this 
result. What will be the long-run price and output?
2.5	 Effects of Cross-Border Conflicts. Suppose that 
due to cross-border conflicts in an economy, domestic 
firms export less in order to meet the higher domestic 
consumption of goods. At the same time, the import of 
foreign goods increases. Assuming that the economy 
is initially at full employment and the exchange rate 
remains constant, what happens to the GDP in the 
short run and the long run?
2.6	 Stabilization Policy and the Speed of Adjustment. 
Economists who believe the transition from the short 
run to the long run occurs rapidly do not generally 
favor using active stabilization policy. Use the aggre-
gate demand and aggregate supply graphs to illustrate 
how active policy, with a rapid adjustment process, 
could destabilize the economy.
2.7	 Possible Reasons for Secular Stagnation. Lawrence 
Summers offered a number of reasons why there might 
not be sufficient aggregate demand to generate full 
employment with the result being secular stagnation. 
Discuss each of the factors below and explain why they 
may lead to insufficient aggregate demand:
a.	 The distribution of income has shifted to higher-
earning individuals who save more than lower-­
earning ones.
b.	The most successful corporations today like Apple 
or Google do not purchase as many capital goods 
for their business compared to companies in the past 
such as railroads or steel plants.
c.	 Interest rates are close to zero now.
d.	Technological progress has reduced the prices of 
capital equipment.
e.	Financial regulation has made it more difficult for 
banks to extend loans.
(Related to Application 1 on p. 340.)
2.8	 Changing Views of Liquidity Traps. After he 
became Federal Reserve Chairman, Ben Bernanke no 
longer advocated a policy of increasing expectations of 
inflation in order to escape from a liquidity trap. What 
factors do you think might influence the Chairman of 
the Federal Reserve to disavow an inflationist policy?
2.9	 Investigating Political Business Cycles. Use the 
Web site for the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis 
(www.research.stlouisfed.org/fred2) to find quarterly 
unemployment rates for 1971–1972 and 1979–1980. 
Richard Nixon ran the reelection campaign in 1972 
and Jimmy Carter planned for his reelection bid in the 
late 1970s. Use the unemployment rates to explore the 
goals these presidential candidates may have wanted to 
achieve. Which monetary and fiscal policies were likely 
to have been used to achieve these goals?
Understanding the Economics of the Adjustment Process
Analyze monetary neutrality and crowding out using graphs.
3.1	 As the price level increases, the demand for money 
_________ and interest rates _________.
3.2	 If output is above full employment, we expect wages 
and prices to rise, money demand to increase, and 
interest rates to fall. _________ (True/False)
3.3	 An increase in the money supply will lower the nominal 
rate of interest in the long run. _________ (True/False)
3.4	 An increase in taxes will _________ interest rates in the 
long run.
3.5	 Understanding Japanese Fiscal Policy. Japan’s 
Finance Ministry agreed to income tax cuts to com-
bat a decade-long recession in the 1990s—but only if 
national sales taxes were increased several years later.
a.	 What would you expect to be the short-run effect of 
the income tax cuts? Draw a graph to show this effect.
b.	What would you expect to be the long-run effect of 
the income tax cuts? Draw a graph to show this effect.
c.	 Why did the Finance Ministry require an increase 
in sales taxes several years later?
d.	What was the Finance Ministry trying to prevent?
3.6	 Can Monetary Policy Prevent Crowding Out? 
Explain what is wrong with this quote: “In the long 
run, we do not have to worry about increased govern-
ment spending causing crowding out because the Fed 
can always increase the money supply to lower interest 
rates to prevent this.”
3.7	 Increasing Health Spending and Economic Growth. 
Analyze how the following factors associated  with 
increased spending on health care might affect eco-
nomic growth. (Related to Application 3 on page 350.)
a.	 With increased longevity, workers will need to 
­postpone their retirement in order to save more for 
old age.
b.	Households may cut down on purchases of con-
sumer durables to spend more on health care.
c.	 Households may reduce their savings in order to 
spend more on health care.
d.	New and expensive technologies allow people to live 
longer.
3.8	 Government Spending and Long-Run Growth. 
Suppose the government permanently increases spend-
ing on the salaries of its workers. Thinking about long 
run crowding out, how will this affect the growth rate 
of the economy? What is government spent the money 
on infrastructure?

The Dynamics of Inflation 
and Unemployment
16
C h a p t e r
When would the Fed begin to 
raise interest rates from above 
near zero levels? This is what the 
financial markets wanted to know.
When Janet Yellen testified before Congress in ­February 
2015, she gave lawmakers and the markets a hint. As 
long as employment continued to grow and inflation 
reached its target of 2 percent, the Fed would at some 
point begin to consider raising its target interest rate.
While this was not exactly a promise, it did signal to 
the market that the Fed was ready to increase interest rates for the first time since the last recession. Yellen’s com-
ments also made clear that she was concerned about two things. First, it was important that the economy continue 
to grow and that interest rate increases not choke off the expansion. Second, she was also indicating that the Fed 
wanted to make sure that their measure of inflation was eventually going to reach 2 percent. While the Fed has a 
mandate to provide “price stability,” today the Fed interprets this as 2 percent inflation.
At her testimony, Yellen received advice from all sides. Some lawmakers were worried that the Fed would raise 
interest rates too quickly and slow economic growth. Others feared that the Fed was behind the curve and delay-
ing interest rates to increase would cause inflation to emerge. Yellen urged lawmakers to be patient and let the Fed 
watch how the economy developed to determine the precise time that they would begin to raise interest rates.

Chapter 16 • The Dynamics of Inflation and Unemployment
357
I
n this chapter, we integrate two themes we’ve been stressing separately:
• In the short run, changes in money growth affect real output and real GDP.
• In the long run, the rate of money growth determines the rate of inflation, not 
real GDP.
Economic policy debates often concern inflation and unemployment because they 
affect us all so directly. We look at the relationships between inflation and unemploy-
ment, examining macroeconomic developments in the United States in the last several 
decades. We also explore why heads of central banks typically appear to be strong 
enemies of inflation.
Although the United States had serious difficulties fighting inflation in the 1970s 
and 1980s, other countries have, at times, had much more severe problems with infla-
tion. In this chapter, we study the origins of extremely high inflationary periods and 
their links to government budget deficits.
Money Growth, Inflation, and Interest Rates
An economy can, in principle, produce at full employment with any inflation rate. 
No “magic” inflation rate is necessary to sustain full employment. To understand this 
point, consider the long run when the economy operates at full employment. As we 
have seen, in the long run, money is neutral. If the Federal Reserve increases the money 
supply at 5 percent a year, annual inflation will be 5 percent. That is, prices in the 
economy will rise by 5 percent a year.
Inflation in a Steady State
Let’s think about how this economy looks in this “steady state” of constant inflation. 
The nominal wages—wages in dollars—of workers are all rising at 5 percent a year. 
However, because prices are also rising at 5 percent a year, real wages—wages adjusted 
for changes in purchasing power—remain constant.
Some workers may feel cheated by the inflation. They might believe that without 
inflation, they would experience real-wage increases because their nominal wages are 
rising 5 percent a year. Unfortunately, these workers are wrong. They suffer from what 
economists call money illusion, a confusion of real and nominal magnitudes. Here’s 
the source of the illusion: Because real wages are constant, the only reason nominal 
wages are rising by 5 percent a year is the general 5 percent inflation. If there were no 
inflation, nominal wages would not increase at all.
After a time, everyone in the economy would begin to expect the 5 percent annual 
inflation that had occurred in the past to continue in the future. Economists call this 
belief expectations of inflation. People’s expectations of inflation affect all aspects of 
economic life. For example, in the steady-state economy we just described, automobile 
producers will expect to increase the price of their products by 5 percent every year. 
They will also expect their costs—of labor and steel, for example—to increase by 
5 ­percent a year. Workers will begin to believe the 5 percent increase in their wages 
will be matched by a 5 percent increase in the prices of the goods they buy. Continued 
inflation becomes the normal state of affairs, and people build it into their daily decision 
making. For example, they expect the price of a car to be 5 percent higher next year 
and will take that into consideration when they go shopping for a new car.
Inflation Expectations and Interest Rates  When the public expects 
inflation, real and nominal rates of interest will differ because we need to account for 
inflation in calculating the real return from lending and borrowing. Recall that the 
nominal interest rate—the rate quoted in the market—is equal to the real rate of inter-
est plus the expected inflation rate. If the real rate of interest is 2 percent and inflation 
is 5 percent a year, the nominal interest rate will be 7 percent. Although lenders receive 
7 percent a year on their loans, their real return after inflation is just 2 percent.

part 6
358
In an earlier chapter you saw that in the long run, the real rate of interest does 
not depend on monetary policy because money is neutral. That is, even though 
the money supply may be higher or lower, the price level will be higher or lower. 
­However, ­nominal rates of interest do depend on monetary policy because whether 
the Fed expands or contracts the money supply affects the rate of inflation, which in 
the long run is determined by the growth of the money supply. As Nobel Laureate 
­Milton ­Friedman pointed out, countries with higher money growth typically have 
higher nominal interest rates than countries with lower money growth rates because 
they have higher inflation. If Country A and Country B have the same real rate of 
interest, but Country A has a higher inflation rate, Country A will also have a higher 
nominal interest rate.
Inflation Expectations and Money Demand  Money demand—the amount 
of money people want to hold—will also be affected by expectations about inflation. If 
people expect 5 percent inflation a year, then their demand for money will also increase 
by 5 percent a year. The reason, of course, is that people know everything will cost 
5 percent more, so they’ll need more money in their pockets to pay for the same goods 
and services. This is an example of the real-nominal principle.
R e a l- N o m i n a l  P r i n c i p l e 
What matters to people is the real value of money or income—its 
purchasing power—not the face value of money or income.
As long as the Fed allows the supply of money to increase by 5 percent—the same 
amount as inflation—the demand for money and its supply will both grow at the same 
rate. Because money demand and supply are both growing at the same rate, real interest 
rates and nominal interest rates will not change.
How Changes in the Growth Rate of Money Affect  
the Steady State
If the growth rate of money changes, however, there will be short-run effects on real 
interest rates. To continue with our example, suppose the public expects 5 percent 
annual inflation and both the money supply and money demand grow at 5 percent a 
year. Now suppose the Fed suddenly decreases the annual growth rate of money to 
4 percent, while the public continues to expect 5 percent annual inflation. Because 
money demand grows at 5 percent but the money supply grows at only 4 percent, 
growth in the demand for money will exceed growth in the supply of money. The result 
will be an increase in both real interest rates and nominal interest rates.
We have seen that higher real rates of interest will reduce investment spending by 
firms and reduce consumer durable goods spending by households. With reduced firm 
and consumer demand for goods and services, real GDP will fall and unemployment 
will rise. The reduction in the growth rate of the money supply is contractionary. In 
the long run, however, output will return to full employment through the adjustment 
process described in prior chapters. The economy will eventually adjust to the lower 
rate of money growth, and inflation will eventually fall from 5 percent to 4 percent 
per year to match it. In the long run, the real rate of interest will eventually fall 
and return to its previous value. Nominal interest rates, which reflect expectations of 
ongoing inflation, will be 1 percent lower because inflation has fallen from 5 percent 
to 4 percent per year. Table 16.1 depicts the long-run relationships between money 
growth, inflation, increases in money demand, and real and nominal interest rates in 
this example.

Chapter 16 • The Dynamics of Inflation and Unemployment
359
This basic pattern fits U.S. history in the late 1970s and early 1980s. At that 
time, the Federal Reserve sharply decreased the growth rate of the money supply, so 
­interest rates rose temporarily. By 1981, interest rates on 3-month Treasury bills rose 
to over 14 percent from 7 percent in 1978. The economy went into a severe recession, 
with unemployment exceeding 10 percent. By the mid-1980s, however, the economy 
returned to full employment with lower interest rates and lower inflation rates. By 
1986, Treasury bill rates were below 6 percent.
This is another example in which the long-run effects of policy actions differ 
from their short-run effects. In the short run, a policy of tight money leads to slower 
money growth, higher interest rates, and lower output. In the long run, reduced 
money growth results in lower interest rates, lower inflation, and no effect on the level 
of output.

Shifts in the Natural Rate of Unemployment

used to measure shifts in the natural rate?
and unemployment. Normally, the higher the unemployment 
rate, the fewer job vacancies there will be. This relationship is 
known as the Beveridge curve. But if the labor market matches 
individuals with jobs more efficiently, resulting in a decline 
in the natural rate of unemployment—for example, through 
the use of Internet searches or new technology—there will 
be fewer job vacancies corresponding to any level of unem-
ployment. Using a variety of vacancy measures, economist 
William Dickens found that shifts in the relationship between 
vacancies and unemployment allowed him to make new esti-
mates of the natural rate. He found that the natural rate was 
approximately 5 percent in the mid-1960s, but then rose in the 
late 1960s and peaked near 7 percent in the late 1970s and 
early 1980s. The natural rate began to drift down in the late 
1980s and through the 1990s, again reaching the 5 percent 
level in 2000. It has since remained at this level.  Related to 
Exercise 2.7.

Economists believe that the natural rate of unemployment 
changes over time, although they often have difficulty pinning 
down an exact estimate. Policymakers need to have an accu-
rate assessment of the natural rate to avoid any unnecessary 
unemployment or prevent inflation from emerging. But how can 
we estimate changes in the natural rate?
One way to estimate the shifts in the natural rate of unem-
ployment is to look at the relationships between job vacancies

Understanding the Expectations Phillips Curve: The 
Relationship between Unemployment and Inflation
In the late 1950s, A. W. Phillips was studying British economic data and noticed that 
lower unemployment was associated with higher inflation. That is, the inflation rate 
rises when economic activity booms and unemployment is low. Phillips also noticed 
that the inflation rate falls when the economy is in a recession and unemployment is 
high. This inverse relationship between unemployment and inflation became known 
as the Phillips curve.
In the early 1960s, Nobel Laureates Paul Samuelson and Robert Solow found a 
similar relationship between unemployment and the inflation rate in the United States. 
However, these early studies examined periods when there was no significant underly-
ing inflation, and they did not take into account people’s expectations of ­inflation. The 
relationship between unemployment and inflation when we take into account expecta-
tions of inflation is known as the expectations Phillips curve. The expectations 
­Phillips curve was introduced into the economics profession in the late 1960s by 
Edmund Phelps of Columbia University and Milton Friedman, then at the University 
of Chicago. The expectations Phillips curve included the notion that unemployment 
varies with unanticipated inflation. Friedman argued, for example, that when the inflation 
rate suddenly increases, it is likely that workers did not fully anticipate some of this 
sudden increase. Actual inflation will then exceed expected inflation. Workers will see 
their nominal wages increase, but because they do not fully expect this sudden inflation, 
they will think their real wages have risen. With higher perceived real wages being 
offered, potential workers will be inclined to accept the jobs firms offer them. As a 
result, unemployment will fall below the natural rate. That’s why we often see an asso-
ciation between increases in the inflation rate and a decrease in the unemployment rate.
After workers recognize that the inflation rate is higher, though, they will incorpo-
rate this higher inflation rate into their expectations of inflation. They will no longer 
confuse the higher nominal wages firms offer with higher real wages. Unemployment 
will then return to its natural rate. So there is no permanent relationship between the 
level of unemployment and the level of inflation.
Similarly, if the inflation rate falls, workers may not expect some of this fall. Because 
inflation is less than expected, workers will believe their real wages aren’t rising as fast as 
they actually are. With lower perceived real wages being offered, potential workers will 
be less inclined to accept the jobs firms offer them. The unemployment rate will increase 
as a result. However, once they recognize that inflation is lower than they realized, and 
that the wages firms offered them really aren’t that low, workers will be more inclined 
to accept work. Unemployment will then again return to the natural rate. So a decrease 
in the inflation rate is likely to be associated with temporary increases in unemployment.
Later in this chapter we see an example of this relationship between inflation and 
unemployment in the late 1980s and early 1990s. A “disconnect” between what people 
expect and what ultimately occurs can adversely affect the economy, as we see next. 
Table 16.2 summarizes the key points about the expectations Phillips curve.

Table 16.2  Expectations and Business Fluctuations
Are the Public’s Expectations about Inflation Rational?
As we just saw, expectations about inflation affect actual inflation because workers 
and firms build their inflation forecasts into their wage- and price-setting decisions. 
Mistakes in predicting inflation therefore have consequences. But how do workers and 

Chapter 16 • The Dynamics of Inflation and Unemployment
361
firms form inflation expectations in the first place? And, second, when do they form 
their inflation expectations?
Two broad classes of theories attempt to explain how the public forms its expec-
tations of inflation. Some economists and psychologists, including Nobel Laureate 
­Herbert Simon, believe the public uses simple rules of thumb to predict future inflation. 
One such rule of thumb might be to assume next year’s inflation rate will be the same 
as this year’s. According to this view, it is unreasonable to expect too much sophistica-
tion from the public because of the complexity of the economy and the difficulty of 
forecasting it.
In the 1970s, a group of economists led by Nobel Laureate Robert E. Lucas, Jr., 
from the University of Chicago developed an alternative view, called the theory of 
rational expectations. The rational expectations theory portrayed workers and firms 
as much more sophisticated, basing their expectations on all the information available 
to them. According to the theory, the public, on average, anticipates the future 
­correctly. Although the public may make mistakes in specific instances, on average, 
people’s expectations are rational or correct.
The two approaches—rules of thumb versus rational expectations—tend to deliver 
similar predictions when the economy is very stable and there are no major policy 
changes. However, when there are major policy changes—for example, when the gov-
ernment introduces new policies to fight inflation or reduce federal deficits—the two 
approaches predict different outcomes. The rational expectations theory predicts the 
public will anticipate the consequences of these policies and change its expectations 
about inflation accordingly; the rule-of-thumb theory says it won’t. Which view is cor-
rect? The truth lies somewhere in the middle. On the one hand, sophisticated firms, 
such as Microsoft and Walmart, do appear to take advantage of available information. 
On the other hand, a considerable amount of inertia and nonrationality appears to 
enter into the general public’s decision-making process. And sometimes the public 
may be rational about small signals but miss the big picture. For example, during the 
stock-market boom in the late 1990s, investors may have had an accurate assessment 
of which tech stocks were relatively more promising but failed to recognize that all tech 
stocks were overvalued.
The other major issue is the question of when inflation expectations are formed. 
As we discussed in Chapter 9, both workers and firms often make explicit long-term 
­contracts or enter into implicit long-term agreements. With long-term contracts, 
workers and firms must make forecasts far into the future. For example, if a union is 
negotiating wages for 3 years, it will need to forecast inflation 3 years into the future 
and negotiate current and future wages today based on that forecast. Making deci-
sions this far in advance is clearly very difficult, so it is understandable that mistakes 
can occur. Indeed, workers and firms can be quite rational but still make mistakes when 
predicting inflation simply because of the long time frames involved. Wage contracts 
set in the early 1980s, for example, would have “rationally” anticipated continued 
high ­inflation, although changes in monetary policy brought inflation below what 
was ­predicted.
U.S. Inflation and Unemployment in the 1980s
We can use the expectations Phillips curve to help understand the patterns of infla-
tion and unemployment that occurred in the 1980s. For the sake of this discussion, 
we assume workers and firms follow relatively simple rules of thumb and that sudden 
increases in inflation are partly unanticipated and thus accompanied by lower unem-
ployment. Conversely, sudden decreases in inflation are accompanied by temporarily 
higher unemployment.
When President Jimmy Carter took office at the beginning of 1977, the inflation 
rate was approximately 6.5 percent per year and unemployment exceeded 7 percent of 
rational expectations

the public forms expectations in such a

the labor force. By 1980, inflation had risen to 9.4 percent. There were two ­reasons for 
this increase. First, utilizing expansionary policy, the Carter administration had steadily 
reduced unemployment to under 6 percent by 1979. Because the natural rate of unem-
ployment was close to 6 percent of the labor force at that time, reducing ­unemployment 
below this rate led to an increase in the annual inflation rate. Second, there was an oil 
shock in 1979, which also contributed to higher inflation.
Fears of even higher inflation led President Carter to appoint a well-known 
­inflation fighter, Paul Volcker, as chairman of the Federal Reserve. Volcker ­immediately 
began to institute a tight money policy, and interest rates rose sharply by 1980. When 
President Ronald Reagan took office, he supported Volcker’s ­policy. Eventually, 
high real-interest rates took their toll, and unemployment rose to over 10 ­percent 
by 1983. As actual unemployment exceeded the natural rate of ­unemployment, 
the inflation rate fell, just as the expectations Phillips curve ­predicted. By 1986, 
the ­inflation rate fell to approximately 2.7 percent per year with unemployment at  
7 percent of the labor force. The severe recession had done its job in reducing the 
inflation rate.
However, as we can see in Figure 16.1, after 1986 the unemployment rate began to 
fall again, from about 7 percent to a little over 6 percent in 1987. Notice that as actual 
unemployment fell below the natural rate (which, at that time, was about 6.5 percent), 
inflation began to rise, increasing from about 2.75 to 3 percent. By 1989, as unem-
ployment continued to fall, annual inflation had risen to 4.5 percent, and the Fed 
then raised interest rates to combat it. The Fed’s action reduced output and increased 
­unemployment to over 7 percent. Notice that by 1992, inflation had fallen dramatically 
because unemployment exceeded the natural rate.
By the time President George H. W. Bush took office in 1989, actual unemploy-
ment was below the natural rate of unemployment, inflation had been rising, and the Fed 
started slowing down the economy. The rate of inflation was eventually reduced, but the 
recovery back to full employment in 1992–1993 came too late in Bush’s term for the vot-
ers to fully appreciate, and he lost his bid for reelection.

Shifts in the Natural Rate of Unemployment in the 1990s
Up to this point, our analysis assumes that the natural rate of unemployment is a 
constant—say, for example, 5 percent of the labor force. If actual unemployment falls 
below this constant rate (the economy is hot, in other words), inflation will tend to 
increase. Similarly, if the actual unemployment exceeds 5 percent (the economy is 
sluggish), inflation will fall.
But the natural rate of unemployment can shift over time. At the beginning of the 
1980s in the United States, most economists believed that the natural rate of unemploy-
ment was between 6 or 7 percent. By the late 1990s, many economists had begun to 
believe the natural rate of unemployment had fallen to about 5 percent. What can shift 
the natural rate of unemployment? Economists have identified a number of factors:
• Demographics. The composition of the workforce can change, decreasing the 
natural rate. For example, we know teenagers have higher unemployment rates 
than adults. If changes in population lead to a lower percentage of teenagers in 
the labor force, we would expect the natural rate of unemployment to decrease. 
In the 1990s, the share of teenagers in the labor force fell. This change in demo-
graphics appears to have been what caused the natural rate of unemployment to 
decline in the United States.
• Institutional changes. Changes in laws, regulations, and economic institutions 
can influence the natural rate of unemployment. Suppose the government short-
ens the length of time unemployed workers can collect benefits. We would then 
expect the unemployed to return to work more rapidly and the natural rate of 
unemployment to fall. Some economists have argued that the rise of temporary 
employment agencies in the United States during the 1990s made the labor 
market more efficient. Workers were matched more quickly with jobs, and this 
contributed to the decline of the natural rate. In Europe, a very different set of 
institutional factors had the opposite result: Generous benefits for the unem-
ployed increased the time they spent unemployed. Restrictions on employers 
making it difficult to fire workers led them to hire fewer people in the first place. 
Both these factors raised the natural rate of employment.
• The recent history of the economy. Some economists believe the economic 
performance of the economy itself may influence the natural rate of unemploy-
ment. Suppose the economy goes into a long recession. During that time, many 
young people may not be able to find jobs and will fail to develop a strong work 
ethic. Other workers may lose some of their skills during a prolonged period of 
unemployment. Both factors could lead to longer-term unemployment and an 
increase in the natural rate of unemployment.
• Changes in growth of labor productivity. If the growth rate in labor 
­productivity falls, wages must also rise more slowly because they are tied to 
­productivity increases in the long run. However, if workers don’t realize this, 
they might continue to push for higher nominal wage increases and be less 
inclined to accept lower nominal wages. This will increase the natural rate of 
unemployment. Similarly, if productivity growth is higher than anticipated, 
wages will rise more quickly because firms will be willing to pay more to retain 
their workers and recruit new ones. As a result of this unexpected productivity 
growth, workers may not be as aggressive in asking for additional nominal wage 
increases because they are pleased with what they are already getting. They will 
be more inclined to accept these wages, and this will effectively lower the natural 
rate of unemployment. Some economists believe this in fact happened in the late 
1990s when productivity growth soared and the natural rate of unemployment 
temporarily fell. Actual unemployment fell to near 4 percent without any visible 
signs of increasing inflation. Of course, once workers in the economy understand 
that a shift in productivity growth has occurred, the natural rate will return to its 
original value, closer to, say, 5 percent.

How the Credibility of a Nation’s Central Bank 
Affects Inflation
Why are the heads of central banks, such as the chair of the Federal Reserve Board of 
Governors, typically very conservative and constantly warning about the dangers of 
inflation? The basic reason is that these monetary policymakers can influence expecta-
tions of inflation, and expectations of inflation will influence actual behavior of workers 
and firms. For example, when workers anticipate inflation, they will push for higher 
nominal wages. When firms anticipate inflation, they will set their prices accordingly. 
If policymakers are not careful in the way they respond to expectations of inflation, 
they can actually make it difficult for a society to fight inflation.
Consider an example. A large union is negotiating wages for workers in the auto 
and steel industries. If the union negotiates a very high nominal wage, other unions 
will likely follow, negotiating for and winning higher wages. Prices of autos and steel 
will inevitably rise as a result, and the Fed will begin to see higher inflation emerge. 
Suppose the Fed has been keeping the money supply constant. What are its options?
We depict the Fed’s dilemma in Figure 16.2. By setting a higher nominal wage, the 
union shifts the aggregate supply curve from AS0 to AS1. The Fed then has a choice:
• Keep the money supply and aggregate demand at AD0. The economy will ini-
tially fall into a recession.
• Increase the money supply and raise aggregate demand from AD0 to AD1. This 
will keep the economy at full employment but lead to higher prices.
The actions of the union will depend on what its leaders expect the Fed to do. On 
the one hand, if they believe the Fed will not increase aggregate demand, their actions 
will trigger a recession. Union leaders know this and might be reluctant to negotiate

Estimating the Natural Real Interest Rate

export its goods, and savings decisions of households. The Fed 
needs a reliable method to estimate the natural rate of interest 
and to see how it changed over time.
Fortunately, a number of economists associated with the 
regional Federal Reserve banks have developed methods to esti-
mate the natural rate of interest. John Williams, now ­president 
of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, was a pioneer 
in this effort. His most recent estimates show that in recent 
years, the natural rate of interest has fallen from between 2 and 
3 ­percent to virtually zero. This means that with a 2 percent infla-
tion rate, the Fed should make sure that nominal interest rates 
on longer-term securities do not rise above 2 percent.  Related 
to Exercise 2.8.

In addition to being concerned about shifts in the natural rate of 
unemployment, the Fed also worries about shifts in the natural 
rate of interest. The natural rate of interest is defined as the real 
interest rate consistent with full employment after temporary 
demand and supply shocks have subsided. If the Fed was able 
to keep the real interest rate at the natural rate, the economy 
would be able to maintain itself at full employment.
The difficulty is that the natural rate of interest can shift due 
to changes in fiscal policy, productivity, the ability of the U.S. to

a high wage because of it. If they don’t negotiate an increase in nominal wages, the 
economy will remain at full employment and there will be no increase in prices. On 
the other hand, if union leaders believe the Fed will increase aggregate demand, they 
have nothing to lose and will push for higher nominal wages. The result will be higher 
prices in the economy.
▲  Figure 16.2  Choices of the Fed: Recession or Inflation

keeps aggregate demand constant at AD0, a recession will occur at point a, and the economy will even-
tually return to full employment at point c. If the Fed increases aggregate demand, the economy remains 
at full employment at b, but with a higher price level.

As this example illustrates, expectations about the Fed’s determination to fight 
inflation will affect behavior in the private sector. If the Fed is credible in its desire to 
fight inflation, it can deter the private sector from taking aggressive actions that drive 
up prices. This is the reason the heads of central banks are conservative, preferring to 
risk increasing unemployment rather than inflation. For example, having a conservative 
chair of the Fed, someone who strongly detests inflation, sends a signal to everyone in 
the economy that the Fed will be unlikely to increase the money supply, regardless of 
what actions are taken in the private sector.
After experiencing relatively high average inflation from 1955 to 1988, New 
­Zealand took a different approach to ensure the credibility of its central bank. Since 
1989, the central bank has been operating under a law that specifies its only goal is to 
attempt to maintain stable prices, which, in practice, requires it to keep inflation between 
0 and 2 percent a year. This policy sharply limits the central bank’s ability to stabilize 
real GDP, but it does signal to the private sector that the central bank will not be 
increasing the money supply, regardless of the actions taken by wage setters or unions.
Our example suggests that with a credible central bank, a country can have lower 
inflation without experiencing extra unemployment. Some political scientists and econ-
omists have suggested that central banks that have true independence from the rest 
of the government, and are therefore less subject to political influence, will be more 
credible in their commitment to fighting inflation.
There is evidence to support this conjecture. Figure 16.3 plots an index of central 
bank independence against average inflation rates from 1980 to 1989 for 10 countries. 
The points appear to lie along a downward-sloping line, meaning more independence 
is associated with lower inflation. Germany had the highest index of central bank inde-
pendence and the lowest inflation rate in this group. Another piece of evidence that 
credible banks can lower inflation safely is provided by the changes that occurred in 
the United Kingdom in the late 1990s.

The Ends of Hyperinflations
Applying the Concepts #3: Why do hyperinflations end suddenly?
Poland, some of the most dramatic in world history. In each 
case, the hyperinflation ended with the creation of a central 
bank and change in the way that governments were financed. 
No longer would the country rely on its central bank to finance 
its debt. Instead, debt was sold to private parties who would 
value the debt based on the ability of the government to meet 
interest and principal payments from taxes. Once the govern-
ments made these reforms, there was an abrupt end to the 
hyperinflations and an actual increase in the demand for money 
in real terms by the private sector.
Sargent used these historical episodes to emphasize how 
hyperinflations were ultimately caused by fiscal policy that was 
financed by money creation and not taxes. He also suggested 
that inflation could be tamed rather easily once fiscal reforms 
were made. While most economists agree with Sargent’s views 
on the ends of hyperinflation, there is less agreement that 
­moderate inflations can be ended simply by changing fiscal 
regimes and not enduring a recession.  Related to Exercises 
5.5 and 5.6.

As our discussion illustrates, how a central bank influences expectations is ­important 
for understanding the behavior of prices and output in an economy. Understanding 
how the private sector forms its inflation expectations in the first place is also ­important. 
Economists have used the theory of rational expectations we discussed earlier to explain 
the credibility of central banks. In our example, the theory of rational expectations 
implies the union will, on average, anticipate whether the Fed will expand the money 
supply in the face of wage increases. A credible Fed will tend to deter wage increases 
by not expanding the money supply. Many economists believed Fed Chairman Alan 
Greenspan was very credible in his determination to fight inflation. This in itself helped 
reduce inflation during the 1990s. People expected that Greenspan would refuse to set 
out the “punch bowl” of money (see Chapter 15), and they were right.
But suppose someone does not believe the central bank will control inflation. Does 
that person have any recourse? In the United States and some other countries, he or she 
does. As we mentioned in the chapter-opening story, the U.S. government now sells 
bonds—TIPS—that protect an investor from inflation. Investors can protect them-
selves from unexpected inflation by buying TIPS.
Inflation and the Velocity of Money
Countries sometimes experience stunning inflation rates. For example, in 15 months 
from August 1922 to November 1923, the price level in Germany rose by a factor of 
10 billion! To explain these extremely high inflation rates and their relationship to 
money growth, we now introduce a concept that is closely related to money demand: 
the velocity of money. The velocity of money is defined as the ratio of nominal GDP to 
the money supply:
velocity of money = nominal GDP
money supply
One useful way to think of velocity is that it is the number of times money must change 
hands, or turn over, in economic transactions during a given year for an economy to 
reach its GDP level. To understand this, consider a simple example. Suppose nominal 
GDP is $5 trillion per year and the money supply is $1 trillion. The velocity of money 
in this economy will then be as follows:
velocity =
$5 trillion per year
$1 trillion
= 5 per year
In this economy, the $1 trillion money supply has to change hands, or turn over, five 
times a year to purchase the $5 trillion of nominal GDP. If the money supply turns 
over five times in one year, this means people are holding each dollar of money for 
365 days/5, or 73 days. If velocity is very high, people turn money over very quickly on 
average and do not hold it for a long time. If velocity is low, people turn over money 
slowly and hold onto it longer.
To further understand the role of money and velocity, let’s rewrite the definition 
of velocity as
money supply * velocity = nominal GDP
or
M * V = P * y
where M is the money supply, V is the velocity of money, P is a price index for GDP, 
and y is real GDP. This equation is known as the equation of exchange, or the quantity 
equation. On the right side, P * y is nominal GDP. It is the product of the price index 
and real GDP. It also represents total nominal spending. On the left side, the money 
supply, M, is multiplied by V, the velocity, or turnover rate, of money.
As you can see, the quantity equation links the money supply and velocity to nomi-
nal GDP. If velocity is predictable, we can use the quantity equation and the supply

of money to predict nominal GDP. But it’s not quite that easy; the velocity of money 
does vary over time. Figure 16.4 plots the velocity of M2 (the measure of the money 
supply that includes currency, demand deposits, savings accounts, time deposits, and 
deposits in money market mutual funds) in the United States between 1959 and 2014. 
During this period, velocity reached a low of around 1.6 in the 1960s and a high of 2.1 
in the late 1990s. In other words, the total amount of M2 held by the public turned 
over between 1.6 and 2.1 times a year for the U.S. economy to reach nominal GDP.
We can use the basic quantity equation to derive a closely related formula for 
understanding inflation in the long run:
growth rate of money + growth rate of velocity 
        = growth rate of prices + growth rate of real output
We call this the growth version of the quantity equation. Here is how to use 
this formula: Suppose money growth is 10 percent a year, the growth of real output is 
3 percent a year, and velocity has zero growth (it is constant). Then the rate of growth 
of prices—the inflation rate, in other words—is
 10 percent + 0 percent = growth rate of prices + 3 percent

Year
Inflation will be 7 percent a year. The formula allows for real economic growth 
and for growth in velocity. For example, if velocity grew during this period at the 
rate of 1 percent a year instead of zero, the annual inflation rate would be 8 percent 
(10 + 1 - 3). Economists use this formula to provide quick estimates of the infla-
tion rate.
As we’ve learned, there is a definite link between increases in the growth of money 
and the rate of inflation. Inflation was lowest in the 1950s, when money growth was 
lowest. It was also highest in the 1970s, when money growth was highest. The link 
is not perfect because real GDP and velocity grew at different rates during these two 
decades. However, years of economic research have revealed that sustained increases 
in money growth will, indeed, lead to inflation.

The links between money growth and inflation are particularly dramatic when 
money growth is extremely high. But what leads countries to vast increases in their 
money supply? We explore that next.
Hyperinflation
The inflation rates observed in the United States in the last 40 years are insignificant 
compared to some of the inflation rates around the world throughout history. 
­Economists call very high inflation rates—over 50 percent per month, which is approxi-
mately 13,000 percent per year—hyperinflation. One of the first hyperinflation studies 
was conducted by Phillip Cagan of Columbia University in the 1950s. Table 16.3 
presents selected data from his study.

Table 16.3  Hyperinflations and Velocity
Greece, Hungary, and Russia are three countries that have experienced hyperinfla-
tion. According to the data in Table 16.3, for a period of 1 year, Greece had a monthly 
inflation rate of 365 percent. A monthly inflation rate of 365 percent means the price 
level rises by a factor of 4.65 each month. If the price level rises by 4.65, its percent 
increase is
4.65 - 1
1
= 3.65 = 365 percent
To get a sense of what a 365 percent inflation rate means, suppose we had inflation 
of this magnitude in the United States. At the beginning of the month, $1 could buy 
a large order of french fries. Because prices are rising by a factor of 4.65 each month, 
by the end of the month it would take $4.65 to buy the same order of french fries, and 
$1 by the end of the month would be worth only 21.5 cents (1/4.65 = 0.215, or 21.5 
cents). After 2 months, a dollar would be worth only 4.6 cents (0.215 * 0.215 = 0.046). 
Suppose this inflation continues month after month. After 1 year, a dollar bill would 
be worth only 1 millionth of 1 cent! In hyperinflations, money doesn’t hold its value 
very long.
In Hungary after World War II prices rose by 19,800 percent each month. The 
hyperinflation in Russia in the early 1920s seems moderate by comparison: Prices there 
rose by only 57 percent per month. However, hyperinflations have also occurred in 
recent times. Table 16.4 presents data on three hyperinflations during the 1980s—in 
Bolivia, Argentina, and Nicaragua, all averaging about 100 percent per month.
On the basis of the quantity theory, we suspect these hyperinflations must have all 
been caused by money growth. You can see this in the data. For example, in Greece, the 
monthly inflation of 365 percent was accompanied by money growth of 220 percent. 

part 6
370
In Hungary, the monthly inflation of 19,800 percent was accompanied by money 
growth of 12,200 percent.
The value of money deteriorates sharply during hyperinflations and no longer 
serves as a good store of value. In these extreme circumstances, we would expect 
people wouldn’t want to hold money very long but would immediately try to spend 
it. In other words, the velocity of money should increase sharply during hyperinfla-
tions. This is precisely what happens. The last column of Table 16.3 shows how 
velocity increases during hyperinflations. In the hyperinflation in Greece, velocity 
increased by a factor of 14. In the hyperinflation in Hungary, velocity increased by 
a factor of 333.
During hyperinflations, money doesn’t facilitate exchange well. Because prices 
are changing so fast and unpredictably, there is typically massive confusion about the 
true value of commodities. Different stores may be raising prices at different rates, so 
the same commodities may sell for radically different prices. People spend all their 
time hunting for bargains and the lowest prices, a process that becomes very costly 
in human terms. Hyperinflation also means people have less time to produce goods 
and services. No country can easily live very long with a hyperinflation. The govern-
ment must take swift measures to end a hyperinflation before it completely destroys 
the economy.
How Budget Deficits Lead to Hyperinflation
If the cause of hyperinflations is excessive money growth, why do governments allow 
the money supply to grow so fast, risking economic catastrophe? The answer lies in the 
way some governments finance their deficits—the gap between government spending 
and revenues.
A government must cover its deficit in some way. If a government wants to spend 
$1,000 but is collecting only $800 in taxes, where can it get the needed $200? One 
option is to borrow the $200 by selling government bonds—IOUs—to the public. In 
the future, the government will have to repay the $200 in bonds plus the interest the 
public earns on them. Another alternative is to create $200 of new money. All govern-
ments have the ability to run the printing presses and come up with $200 in new 
­currency. The revenue raised from money creation is called seignorage. In principle, 
governments can do a combination of both—selling bonds and printing money—as 
long as the deficit is covered:
government deficit = new borrowing from the public + new money created
Now we are in a position to understand how hyperinflations originate. Consider 
Hungary after World War II. The country’s economy was destroyed by the war, 
and its citizens were demanding government services. The government had limited 
ability to collect taxes because of the poor state of the economy, but it gave in to 
the demands from its citizens for spending at levels that far exceeded what it could 
collect. The result was a large deficit. Then the government faced a problem: How 
would it finance this large deficit? No individuals or governments wanted to buy 
seignorage
Revenue raised from money creation.

bonds or IOUs from Hungary (lend it money) because the country’s economy was 
in such bad shape that prospects for repayment in the near future were grim. Unable 
to borrow, Hungary resorted to printing money at a massive rate. The result was 
hyperinflation. A more recent example of a devastating hyperinflation occurred in 
Zimbabwe, beginning in 2007.
To end hyperinflation, governments must eliminate their budget deficits by either 
increasing taxes, cutting spending, or both. This, of course, will cause some economic 
pain, but there is no other remedy. Once the deficit has been cut and the government 
stops printing money, the hyperinflation will end. Without money growth to feed it, 
hyperinflation will quickly die of starvation.
Economists who emphasize the role the supply of money plays in determining 
nominal income and inflation are called monetarists. The most famous monetarist 
was Milton Friedman, who studied complex versions of the quantity equation and 
explored the role of money in all aspects of economic life. Friedman had many influ-
ential ­students, such as Phillip Cagan, who is best known for his work on hyperinfla-
tions (see Table 16.3). Friedman and Cagan, along with other monetarist economists, 
pioneered research on the link between money, nominal income, and inflation. During 
the 1960s, little attention was being paid to the role of money in determining aggregate 
demand. The work of Friedman and other monetarists was extremely influential in 
changing the opinions of economic thinkers at that time. Moreover, the monetarists 
were also ­insistent that, in the long run, inflation was a monetary problem. Today, most 
economists agree with them that, in the long run, inflation is caused by growth in the 
money supply.
 
monetarists
Economists who emphasize the role that 
the supply of money plays in determining 
nominal income and inflation.
In this chapter, we explored the 
role expectations of ­inflation 
play in the economy and how 
societies deal with ­inflation. 
Interest rates, as well as 
changes in wages and prices, 
both reflect expectations of 
inflation. These expectations depend on the past history of infla-
tion and on expectations about central bank behavior. To reduce 
inflation, policymakers must increase actual unemployment above 
the natural rate of unemployment. We also looked at the ultimate 
causes of hyperinflations. Here are the key points to remember from 
this chapter:
1.	 In the long run, higher money growth leads to higher inflation and 
higher nominal interest rates.
2.	 A decrease in the growth rate of money will initially lead to higher 
real-interest rates and higher nominal-interest rates. In the long 
run, real rates return to their original level; nominal rates are per-
manently lower because of reduced inflation.
3.	 The rate of inflation increases when actual unemployment falls 
below the natural rate of unemployment; the rate of inflation 
decreases when actual unemployment exceeds the natural rate 
of unemployment. Economists explain this relationship using the 
expectations Phillips curve.
4.	 How the public forms expectations of inflation and the time frame 
in which it must form them are important factors in understand-
ing the behavior of inflation and unemployment. Sometimes the 
public uses rules of thumb to form expectations; other times it 
may use rational expectations.
5.	 Monetary policymakers need to be cautious about the state-
ments and pronouncements they make because what they say 
can influence inflation expectations. Conservative central ­bankers 
can dampen expectations of inflation.
6.	 The quantity equation and the growth version of the quantity 
equation show how money, velocity, and nominal income are 
related. The simple quantity equation is
M * V = P * y
7.	 Governments sometimes create new money to finance large 
portions of their budget deficits. Raising funds through print-
ing money is known as seignorage. When governments do this 
excessively, the result is hyperinflation. Stopping hyperinflation 
requires closing the government deficit and reducing money 
creation.

Money Growth, Inflation, and Interest Rates
Describe how an economy at full employment with inflation 
differs from one without inflation.
1.1	 The expected real rate of interest is the nominal ­interest 
rate plus the expected inflation rate. _________ (True/
False)
1.2	 Countries with lower rates of money growth have 
_________ interest rates.
1.3	 If the growth rate of money increases from 5 to 7 percent, 
nominal interest rates will _________ in the long run.
1.4	 A firm that expects higher profits from higher prices 
but does not recognize its costs are increasing is suf-
fering from _________.
1.5	 Nominal and Real Interest Rates. In Japan in the 
1990s interest rates were near zero on government 
bonds. Some economists said that it was still possible to 
stimulate investment by creating negative real interest 
rates. If nominal rates could not fall below zero, explain 
how real interest rates could be made negative. (Hint: 
Think about inflation.)
1.6	 Money Neutrality, Long-Run Inflation, and the 
Natural Rate. Explain carefully the relationship 
between the concept of monetary neutrality and the 
idea that the natural rate is independent of the longrun 
inflation rate.
1.7	 Expected and Actual Costs. Suppose that a busi-
ness borrows $1 million at 12 percent per year. The 
expected inflation rate is 6 percent, but the actual infla-
tion rate turns out to be 8 percent. What is the unan-
ticipated inflation rate? Does the business gain or lose 
due to unanticipated inflation? If the actual inflation 
rate is 4 percent, does the business gain or lose? Explain 
your answer.
1.8	 Examples of Money Illusion. What do the following 
two quotes have in common?
a.	 “My wages are going up 5 percent a year. If only 
inflation weren’t 5 percent a year, I would be rich.”
b.	“My bank is paying 10 percent a year, but the 
8 ­percent inflation rate is just eating up all my real 
investment gains.”
Understanding the Expectations Phillips Curve: The 
Relationship between Unemployment and Inflation
Explain the relationship between inflation and unemployment 
in the short run and long run.
2.1	 If actual inflation is higher than expected inflation, the 
actual unemployment rate will be _________ than the 
natural rate.
2.2	 James Tobin explained business cycles with rational 
expectations. _________ (True/False)
2.3	 The increase in the fraction of young people in the 
labor force that occurred when the baby-boom genera-
tion came of working age tended to _________ (raise/
lower) the natural rate of unemployment.
2.4	 The original Phillips curve did not account for 
_________ inflation.
2.5	 Targeting the Natural Rate of Unemployment? 
Because the natural rate of unemployment is the 
economists’ notion of what constitutes “full employ-
ment,” it might seem logical for the Fed to use mon-
etary policy to move unemployment toward its natural 
rate. However, many economists believe such a policy 
would be unwise because the natural rate may shift 
over time and policymakers may misjudge the cor-
rect rate. What would happen if the Fed targeted a 
5 ­percent unemployment rate but the true natural rate 
were 6 percent?
2.6	 Hysteresis and the Labor Force Participation Rate. 
In economics the term “hysteresis” means that the his-
tory of the economy has a lingering effect on current 
economic performance. During the U.S. recession 
starting in 2007, the labor force participation rate con-
tinued to remain below the levels that prevailed before 
the recession. Could this be an example of hysteresis? 
Can you suggest any other explanations?
2.7	 Oil Price Changes, Vacancies, and the Natural 
Rate. During the mid-1970s, changes in oil prices 
required products to be produced by different types of 
firms in different locations. This raised the number of 
vacancies relative to the unemployment rate. Accord-
ing to the theory of William Dickens, how did this

affect the natural rate of unemployment? (Related to 
Application 1 on page 359.)
2.8	 Nominal Rates and Natural Rates. If the Federal 
Reserve calculates the natural rate of interest to be 
2.5 percent and they expect 2.3 percent inflation, what 
nominal rate should they aim for? Related to Applica-
tion 2 on page 364.
How the Credibility of a Nation’s Central Bank Affects 
Inflation
Discuss why increasing the credibility of a central bank can 
reduce inflation.
3.1	 An aggressive union will shift the aggregate supply 
curve _________, causing prices to and real GDP to 
_________.
3.2	 In the face of an upward shift in the aggregate supply 
curve, the Fed can increase the supply of money. This 
will prevent a recession, but will cause an increase in 
_________.
3.3	 The evidence shows that lower inflation rates are asso-
ciated with central bank _________.
3.4	 During the 1980s, Germany had low inflation and an 
independent central bank. _________ (True/False)
3.5	 Public Pronouncements and Fed Officials. In addi-
tion to political and institutional factors, public pro-
nouncements also affect the credibility of the Fed. 
When Alan Blinder, a Princeton University professor 
of economics, was appointed vice-chair of the Federal 
Reserve in 1994, he gave a speech to a group of cen-
tral bankers and monetary policy specialists. In that 
speech, he repeated one of the lessons in this chapter: 
In the long run, the rate of inflation is independent of 
unemployment and depends only on money growth; 
in the short run, lower unemployment can raise the 
inflation rate. Blinder’s speech caused an uproar in the 
financial press. Some commentators attacked him as 
not being sufficiently vigilant against inflation. Use the 
idea of credibility to explain why an apparently inno-
cent speech would create such a reaction.
3.6	 Pay Incentives for Fed Officials? In the private sec-
tor, the pay of executives is typically tied to the per-
formance of their company. Could this work in the 
public sector as well? Suppose pay for the chairman 
of the Federal Reserve is tied to the price of long-
term bonds. That is, if bond prices rise, the chairman 
receives a bonus, but if they fall, the chairman’s salary 
will decrease. Would this provide a credible incentive 
for the chairman to keep inflation low? (Hint: Think 
of the links between inflation, interest rates, and bond 
prices.) Do you see any disadvantages to this proposal?
3.7	 Buying Gold to Protect against Inflation. Consider 
the following statement: “Since gold is a commodity and 
prices of commodities by definition increase with infla-
tion, buying gold will protect me from any inflationary 
increases.” Can you point out a possible problem with 
buying gold to protect yourself against inflation?
Inflation and the Velocity of Money
Define the velocity of money.
4.1	 The velocity of money is defined as _________ income 
divided by the supply of money.
4.2	 According to the quantity equation, the product of 
money supply and velocity is equal to the product of 
_________ and _________.
4.3	 The growth version of the quantity equation links the 
growth rates of _________, _________, _________, and 
_________.
4.4	 If the growth rate of money supply is 5 percent a year 
with constant velocity and an annual inflation rate of 
2 percent, the growth rate of real output is _________.
4.5	 Interest Rates and the Velocity of Money. When 
interest rates are high, people hold less money. How 
would this affect the velocity of money?
4.6	 Using the Quantity Equation. If the growth rate of 
money is 8 percent per year, annual inflation is 10 per-
cent, and the growth rate of velocity is 2 percent per 
year, what is the growth rate of real and nominal output?
4.7	 Velocity of Money in the United States. Using the 
Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis Web site (http://
research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/), calculate the velocity of 
M1 and M2 in 1960 and the most recent year avail-
able. How have they changed?
Hyperinflation
Identify the origins and causes of hyperinflation.
5.1	 To eliminate a budget deficit, a government can 
_________ (increase/decrease) taxes and/or _________  
(increase/decrease) spending.
5.2	 During hyperinflations the velocity of money tends to 
_________ sharply.
5.3	 Economists call inflation “hyperinflation” when the 
inflation rate exceeds _________ percent per month.
5.4	 Hyperinflations cannot occur unless the growth rate of 
_________ is very high.
5.5	 Ending Hyperinflations and the Independence of 
Central Banks. Why is it important to create an inde-
pendent central bank, one that is not subservient to the 
rest of the government, in order to stop a hyperinfla-
tion? (Related to Application 3 on page 366.)
5.6	 Hyperinflation and Barter. Some economists and 
journalists noticed that during the recent hyperinfla-
tion in Zimbabwe that the economy was turning to a 
barter economy. Why do you think this would occur? 
(Related to Application 3 on page 366.)

can be viewed as a tax? Is it a good tax?

Money Illusion
Economists say that people suffer from money illusion if 
their behavior is influenced by nominal changes that are also 
not real changes. Consider the following scenarios and be 
prepared to discuss them in class.
a.	 Erin bought an antique clock for $100. Two years later, 
Betsy bought an identical clock for $121. Meanwhile, 
there had been inflation each year of 10 percent. Both 
Erin and Betsy sold their clocks to other collectors. 
Economic Experim ent
Erin sold hers for $130, and Betsy sold hers for $133.

b.	Bob and Pete are traders in classic comic books. A year 
ago, Bob and Pete each bought the same comic book 
for $10. Bob sold his a couple of days later for $20. 
Pete waited a year and sold his for $21. If inflation last 
year was 6 percent, who made the better deal?

C h a p t e r
We all know that our nations 
are faced with great economic 
challenges.
As birthrates decline, the population ages, and the 
young are called on to provide more resources for 
older adults. Regardless of the exact nature of the 
health-care system, health-care costs are soaring 
throughout the world. In part, this is due to increased 
longevity as well as important technological advances 
in medical science. And, finally, global competition 
has reached new heights, providing a wider range 
of goods and services but creating uncertainties for 
individual businesses and citizens.
Sound economic policy is needed to address 
these issues but political systems throughout the world at times seem incapable of responding to them. Virtually all 
countries are racked by debates over the size and role of government, the appropriate level and structure of taxation, 
and the role that the state should play in our lives. Sometimes these debates become rancorous and counterproduc-
tive. How can we calmly and sensibly debate these important economic issues?

s a student and a citizen, you are inevitably drawn into economic debates. In 
most cases, the debates are complex because they involve a mixture of facts, 
theories, and opinions. Value judgments play a large role in economic debates. 
Your views on the proper role of tax policy, for example, will depend on whether you 
believe low-income earners should receive a higher share of national income. Your 
views on the size of government will depend on whether you believe individuals or the 
government should play a larger role in economic affairs.
In previous chapters, you learned the basic vocabulary of economics and studied 
different theories of the economy. Now you are ready to examine some of the key 
policy issues in macroeconomics. In this chapter, we focus on three macroeconomics 
issues that are the subject of much debate:
• Should we balance the federal budget?
• Should the Fed target both inflation and employment?
• Should we tax consumption rather than income?
Should We Balance the Federal Budget?
Before we begin to consider answers to the question “Should we balance the fed-
eral budget?” let’s go over some terms from earlier chapters: Government expenditures 
include goods and services purchased by the government and transfer payments, such as 
Social Security and welfare, made to citizens. A surplus occurs when the government’s 
revenues exceed its expenditures in a given year. The government runs a deficit when 
it spends more than it receives in revenues from either taxes or fees in a given year.
The government debt is the total of all its yearly deficits. For example, if a govern-
ment initially had a debt of figure $100 billion and then ran deficits of $20 billion the 
next year, $30 billion the year after that, and $50 billion during the third year, its total 
debt at the end of the third year would be $200 billion: the initial $100 billion debt 
plus the successive yearly deficits of $20 billion, $30 billion, and $50 billion. If a gov-
ernment ran a surplus, it would decrease its total debt. For example, suppose the debt 
were $100 billion and the government ran a surplus of $10 billion. With the surplus, 
the government would buy back $10 billion of debt from the private sector, thereby 
reducing the remaining debt to $90 billion.
In this chapter, we focus on the government debt held by the public, not the total 
federal debt, which includes debt held by other governmental agencies. Sometimes 
popular accounts in the press or on the Web highlight the total federal debt. However, 
the debt held by the public is the best measure to assess the burden the federal debt 
can have on the economy.
The Budget in Recent Decades
The fiscal picture for the United States has changed substantially over the last 30 years. 
Beginning in the 1980s and through most of the 1990s, the federal budget ran large 
deficits—“deficits as far as the eye can see,” as David Stockman, the director of the 
Office of Management and Budget in President Ronald Reagan’s administration, put 
it. What Stockman could not see at that point, however, was what would occur in 
the late 1990s. In fiscal year 1998, during President Bill Clinton’s administration, the 
federal government ran a budget surplus of $69 billion—its first surplus in 30 years. It 
continued to run surpluses for the next 3 fiscal years as well.
The surplus emerged for two key reasons. First, economic growth was very rapid 
and tax revenues—including tax revenues from the sales of stocks and bonds—grew 
more quickly than anticipated. Second, federal budget rules were in place that limited 
total spending.
When President George W. Bush took office in January 2001, the large surplus led 
him to propose substantial tax cuts. Bush and Congress then passed a 10-year tax cut 
amounting to $1.35 trillion over the course of the decade. Although the tax cuts were

large, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimated at that time that the federal 
government would nonetheless continue to run surpluses through 2010.
The CBO noted that, as a result of these federal government surpluses, the out-
standing stock of federal debt held by the public would be reduced. Because GDP 
would be growing over this period, the stock of debt relative to GDP, which is the stan-
dard way to measure the effect of debt in an economy, would also decline. The CBO 
estimated that in 2011, the ratio of debt to GDP would fall despite Bush’s tax cuts, in 
part because the tax cuts were set to expire in 2010. Figure 17.1 depicts the debt/GDP 
ratio from 1791 to 2014. As you can see, except for a period in the 1980s, typically the 
ratio rises sharply during wars and the Great Depression and falls during peacetime. 
With neither a war nor a recession looming on the horizon in early 2001, the CBO 
predicted that the debt/GDP ratio would be relatively low by the end of the decade.
▲  Figure 17.1  Debt as a Percent of GDP, 1791–2014
MyLab Economics Real-time data
The nation’s debt/GDP ratio tends to rise sharply during wars because more spending is needed to 
finance them. However, the ratio also can rise during peacetime, as it did during the Reagan presidency 
in the 1980s and since 2008.

Unfortunately, a series of events intervened to bring deficits back into the pic-
ture and prevent the debt/GDP ratio from falling. The fight against terrorism led 
to higher spending on homeland security and the military as wars were launched in 
Afghanistan and Iraq. The Bush tax cuts, the collapse of the stock market twice dur-
ing the decade, the recessions that began in 2001 and 2007, and the slow recovery 
all sharply reduced tax revenues. President Obama’s stimulus package in 2009 added 
new tax cuts and additional spending, which fueled the deficit. In the midst of the 
stimulus and the recession, the federal government ran a budget deficit of approxi-
mately $1.3 trillion in fiscal year 2011, a far cry from the surpluses in the late 1990s. 
As the economy recovered and the stimulus plan ended, the deficit fell to $483 billion 
by 2014. You can see from the last few years in Figure 17.1 that the debt/GDP ratio 
rose with the recession and has continued to rise. The debt/GDP ratio in 2014 was 
74.1 percent. The CBO forecasts that for the next several years, the debt/GDP ratio 
will remain at this level.

Five Debates about Deficits
As we have seen, federal budgets are affected by a wide range of factors, including wars, 
demographic pressures, recessions, and the choices our politicians make on spending 
and taxes. But what principles should guide policymakers? Should they cut spending 
and raise taxes to reduce the national debt over time? Or does the level of the national 
debt really matter? Let’s take a look at the debates over the national debt.
Debate 1: Do Deficits Lead To Inflation?  If a government is spending 
$2,000 but collecting only $1,600 in taxes, where does it get the $400 needed to fill the 
gap? One option is to borrow $400 from the public in return for government bonds, 
which are, in effect, IOUs. In the future the government would have to pay back the 
$400 plus any interest on the bonds. Another way to cover the gap is simply to create 
$400 worth of new money. In principle, governments could use a mix of borrowing 
money and creating money, as long as the total covers its deficits:
government deficit = new borrowing from the public + new money created
In the United States, the Treasury Department issues government bonds to finance 
the deficit. The Federal Reserve has the option of buying existing government bonds, 
including those newly issued by the Treasury Department. If the Federal Reserve does 
purchase the government’s bonds, the purchase creates money by taking debt out of 
the hands of the public in exchange for money. Economists call the purchase by a 
central bank of newly issued government debt monetizing the deficit. If governments 
finance deficits by creating new money, the result will be inflation. In the United States, 
we normally finance only a very small portion of our deficits by creating money. For 
example, between 2005 and 2006 the Federal Reserve purchased only $34 billion in 
government bonds of approximately $330 billion issued by the Treasury during that 
period. The Fed sold the remainder to the public. However, during the financial crisis, 
the Fed engaged in massive purchases in securities, adding over a trillion dollars to its 
balance sheet. However, by paying interest on reserves, it induced banks to hold match-
ing excess reserves and thus prevented the money supply held by the public from 
increasing. This prevented inflation from emerging.
If a country has no options other than creating money to finance its deficits—in 
other words, if the public is unwilling to buy its bonds, as was the case in Hungary fol-
lowing World War II—those deficits will inevitably cause inflation. As we discussed 
in Chapter 16, hyperinflations occur when economies run large deficits and monetize 
them. Germany and Russia after World War I, Bolivia and Argentina in the 1980s, 
Russia in the 1990s, and most recently Zimbabwe in 2008–09 are just some of the 
countries that, in addition to Hungary, have endured massive inflations because they 
monetized their deficits. However, large, stable countries like the United Kingdom, the 
United States, and Japan don’t monetize much of their debt because they are able to 
borrow from the public. In these countries, deficits do not lead inevitably to inflation.
Debate 2: Is Government Debt A Burden On Future Generations?  
The national debt, another commonly used term for total government debt, can impose 
two different burdens on society, both of which fall on the shoulders of future genera-
tions. First, a large debt can reduce the amount of capital in the economy and thereby 
reduce future income and real wages for its citizens. Here’s how.
The savings of individuals and institutions flow into capital formation and increase 
an economy’s capital stock. For example, when savers purchase new stocks and bonds, 
the companies issuing them use the proceeds to invest in plants and equipment.
When the government runs a deficit and increases its national debt, it also finances 
its spending by selling bonds to these same savers, who might hold both types of assets 
in, say, their retirement portfolios. Furthermore, let’s say that the total amount that the 
public can save is fixed at $1,000. If the government needs to finance a $200 deficit and 
does so by selling new bonds, then only $800 in savings is available to invest in private 
companies. The selling of $200 in government bonds to finance the deficit therefore 
crowds out $200 that could have been raised by private companies.

issued government bonds.

The result of government deficits is that less savings are available to firms for 
investment. This illustrates one of our basic principles in economics.
P r i n c i p l e  o f  O p p o r t u n i t y  C o s t
The opportunity cost of something is what you sacrifice to get it.
As we discussed in earlier chapters, reduced saving and investment will ultimately 
reduce the stock of private capital, the building of new factories, and the purchasing of 
equipment to expand production and raise GDP. As a result, there will be less capital 
deepening. With lower capital per worker, real incomes and real wages will be lower 
than they otherwise might have been. The government deficit (caused by increased 
spending or decreased taxes) comes at a cost in the future.
Governments can spend the proceeds of borrowing on investments, such as pro-
ductive infrastructure—in this case, future real wages and incomes will not be adversely 
affected. With productive investment, government deficits will not be a burden on society.
Second, a large national debt will mean that higher taxes will be imposed on future 
generations to pay the interest that accumulates on the debt. Just like your college 
loans, the bill eventually comes due—even for the national debt.
Sometimes you hear that these interest payments are not a real burden because “we 
owe the national debt to ourselves.” This is a misleading argument for several reasons. 
First, we don’t owe the interest payments only to ourselves. In 2014, approximately 
47 percent of U.S. public debt was held by foreigners. Second, a high proportion of 
the debt is held by older, wealthy individuals or by institutions, but the taxes levied to 
service it will be paid by everyone in the United States.
Some economists do not believe that government deficits, resulting in govern-
ment debt, impose a burden on a society. These economists believe in Ricardian 
equivalence, the proposition that it does not matter whether government expendi-
ture is financed by taxes or financed by issuing debt. This idea is named after David 
Ricardo, a nineteenth-entury classical economist. To understand the case for 
­Ricardian equivalence, consider the following example. A government initially has a 
balanced budget. It then cuts taxes and issues new debt to finance the deficit left by 
the reduction in taxes. Everyone understands the government will have to raise taxes 
in the future to service the debt, so everyone increases savings to pay for the taxes that 
will be increased in the future. If saving rises sufficiently, the public—everyone—will 
be able to purchase the new debt without reducing the funds they invest in the private 
sector. Because net investment doesn’t decline, there will be no debt burden.
As you can see, Ricardian equivalence requires that savings by the private sector 
increase when the deficit increases. Do savers behave this way? It is actually difficult to 
provide a definite answer because we must take many other factors into account in any 
empirical studies of savings. It appears, however, that during the early 1980s, savings 
decreased somewhat when government deficits increased. This is precisely the opposite 
of what Ricardian equivalence predicts. As long as Ricardian equivalence does not fully 
hold true, it’s reasonable to assume the government debt imposes a burden on society. 
Nonetheless, many economists believe using the deficit as the sole measure of a society’s 
future burdens doesn’t tell the whole story. These economists believe we should look at 
broader measures that take into account long-run promises of the federal government.
From an international perspective, the United States does not have the largest 
government debt measured relative to GDP. Figure 17.2 depicts the percentage of debt 
to GDP for several developed countries. By this measure, Japan has the most serious 
public debt problem.

Laureate James Buchanan has argued that people are less aware of government deficits

than of the taxes they’re forced to pay. Therefore, financing government expenditures 
through deficits, rather than through higher taxes, will inevitably lead to higher govern-
ment spending and bigger government. Although this argument may seem plausible, 
it presents two problems. First, in recent U.S. history, spending by state and local 
governments has grown much faster than federal spending. However, state and local 
governments face many more restrictions when it comes to borrowing money than the 
federal government faces. For example, many states require legislators to run a balanced 
budget. Deficit spending isn’t allowed. Second, if politicians trying to get reelected 
really prefer higher government spending and deficits to higher taxes and surpluses, 
why did the federal government run surpluses in the late 1990s?
Some research suggests politicians can use deficits strategically to actually reduce the 
growth of government. During the 1980s, for example, the government ran large deficits 
caused by a combination of a deep recession and major tax cuts. The deficits subsequently 
made it difficult for other politicians to propose new spending programs. Proponents 
of smaller government, therefore, may wish to cut taxes to reduce surpluses or increase 
deficits in order to make it more difficult for other politicians to increase government 
spending. These deficit proponents want to create deficits to prevent Congress from hav-
ing too much money to be able to spend. Some congressmen supported President Bush’s 
tax cut in 2001, which reduced the surplus over a 10-year period, precisely for this reason.
Debate 4: Can Deficits Be Good For An Economy?  Recall from our fiscal 
policy discussion that, during a downturn, running a deficit helps stimulate private-
sector spending. Consequently, the government may deliberately run a deficit to pull 
the economy out of a recession. The deficit the government creates puts additional 
income into the hands of the public. With more money, people don’t have to drastically 
cut their consumption spending. Because total spending in the economy does not fall 
as much, the severity of the recession is lessened.
Deficits automatically emerge during recessions, which also stabilize the economy. 
Recall how automatic stabilizers work. As incomes fall during a recession, so do tax 
payments. Moreover, transfer payments such as welfare and food stamps rise. Because

government spending increases while tax revenues fall, the deficit must, of course, 
rise. However, a rising deficit may be what it takes to steer the economy back to full 
employment. Automatic stabilizers were clearly in evidence in the recession that began 
in late 2007, as tax revenues fell sharply for the next several years.
The existence of automatic stabilizers and the use of expansionary fiscal policy dur-
ing recessions suggest that we should not worry about short-run government deficits. 
Over short time periods, deficits can help the economy to cope with shocks, such as 
oil price increases or a collapse in the stock market. They give the government some 
room to maneuver out of a recession. Most economists believe automatic stabilizers 
reduced economic fluctuations during the twentieth century.
Deficits can also play a role in tax smoothing. Suppose there is a large, temporary 
increase in government spending, as might occur during a war. The government could 
either finance the war by running a deficit and issuing debt or by increasing tax rates to 
keep the budget in balance. Professor Robert Barro of Harvard University has argued 
that it is more efficient to keep tax rates relatively constant than to raise them sharply 
and then lower them later. Temporarily raising tax rates to very high levels could cause 
distortions in economic behavior that we would like to avoid. Thus, by running defi-
cits and only gradually raising taxes later to service the debt, we avoid creating excess 
distortions in the economy.
Debate 5: Would A Balanced-Budget Amendment Really Work?  For 
many years, there were strong efforts to enact a Constitutional amendment to balance 
the federal budget. As recently as 1995, Congress came very close to passing a balanced-
budget amendment, sending it back to the states for ratification. The amendment 
passed in the House of Representatives but failed by a single vote in the Senate. How 
would a balanced-budget amendment actually work?
Many different budgetary constitutional amendments have been proposed. They 
all require that, after a phase-in period, Congress propose in each fiscal year a budget in 
which total revenues (excluding borrowing) cover total expenditures. The amendments 
also have various escape clauses—for example, to allow borrowing during wartime. Some 
amendments also allow Congress to suspend the requirement to balance the budget for 
other reasons, such as during a recession when deficits naturally emerge. Finally, some 
versions would limit the rate of spending increases to the rate at which GDP is growing.
Proponents of the balanced-budget amendment say it will finally exert discipline on 
the federal government, preventing large deficits in peacetime, such as those that occurred 
in the 1980s. With a balanced budget we could be sure to avoid the negative effects of defi-
cits: reduced capital formation and tax burdens that are shifted onto future generations.
Critics of a balanced-budget amendment point to many different problems, such 
as the following: 
• A balanced budget may not allow enough flexibility, or room, for the govern-
ment to effectively deal with recessions. Under some versions of the amendment, 
unless three-fifths of Congress votes to suspend requirements, the government 
would have to cut expenditures or raise taxes during a recession. This would 
make the recession worse and limit the ability of the government to use fiscal 
policy to stabilize the economy.
• The Constitution is not the right mechanism to try to enforce complicated bud-
get rules. As various interested parties challenge the actions of Congress, the 
courts would become heavily engaged in federal budget matters.
• Congress could devise special budgets to get around the requirement, for exam-
ple, by taking some types of spending “off budget,” which means simply not 
counting them as part of the official budget.
• Congress could also find nonbudgetary ways to carry out the policies that it 
desires. For example, it could issue more regulations or impose mandates or 
requirements on businesses or other governments to carry out its will. These 
regulations or mandates could be even more costly to the economy than 
added deficits.

Should the Fed Target Both Inflation and Employment?
In previous chapters we looked at the various roles that the Federal Reserve can play. 
Monetary policy can be used to stabilize the real economy, preventing unemployment 
from exceeding the natural rate or falling too far below the natural rate. As we also have 
seen, the Fed also plays a critical role as a lender of last resort and a unique resource 
to combat financial crises.
The Congress generally has expected the Fed along with other agencies in govern-
ment to play multiple roles. In the Employment Act of 1946, the federal government was 
broadly charged to pursue “maximum employment, production, and purchasing power.” 
In 1978, Congress passed the Humphrey–Hawkins legislation, which calls for the nation 
to seek full employment and price stability as well as balances in the trade and budget.
But what should the Fed actually do? We have learned that, in the long run, money 
is neutral and monetary policy cannot affect the real level of output or unemployment. 
We also saw that the natural rate can shift over time, making it difficult to target 
the appropriate unemployment rate. In these circumstances, what should the Fed do? 
Should it just focus on inflation or try to follow some other rule or procedure to balance 
concerns of inflation and unemployment?
In the early years of the first decade of the twenty-first century, the rate of inflation 
had fallen to between 1 and 2 percent. Some economists thought the time was right 
for the Fed to concentrate on simply keeping the inflation rate low and stable. In other 
words, they thought the Fed should use monetary policy to “target” an appropriate 
inflation rate and make its primary objective keeping inflation in check. Following the 
expansion of the Fed’s activities during the financial crisis of 2008 and its aftermath, 
there is continuing concern about long-run inflation.

goods, but also assumed the debts of the state governments 
and the Continental Congress that had been incurred during 
the Revolutionary War. Alexander Hamilton, who conceived and 
promoted this new arrangement, saw it as a way to strengthen 
the federal government so that it could borrow externally as 
needed for wars or other needs. The states were willing to give 
the tariff power to the federal government in exchange for being 
absolved of their debts.
Nobel Laureate Thomas J. Sargent noted, however, that 
when the states again got into fiscal difficulties in the 1840s 
through overly ambitious infrastructure investment, the federal 
government did not bail out the states. This time, the federal 
government did not want to enhance its power and control 
over the states, which were forced to impose new rules and 
fiscal discipline on themselves to avoid future fiscal disrup-
tions. Together, these two episodes helped define the fiscal 
structure of the United States: a strong central government 
and independent but fiscally responsible states.  Related to 
Exercise 1.7.

In recent years, various inflation-targeting methods have been adopted in a number 
of developed countries, including Canada, the United Kingdom, New Zealand, Sweden, 
Australia, and Spain. In addition, many developing countries have found that inflation 
targeting increased the autonomy of their central banks, helping them fight inflation.
Two Debates about Targeting
Inflation targeting has had many strong proponents. Let’s take a close look at two key 
debates about this topic.
Debate 1: Should The Fed Focus On Only Inflation?  We have learned 
that in the long run monetary policy can influence only the level of prices, not the 
level of employment. Proponents of inflation targeting argue that the Fed should have 
only one primary goal: controlling inflation. Having it worry about other factors—­
unemployment or the exchange rate—will, they say, distract it from its mission and lead 
to long-run inflationary pressures building in the economy. Moreover, if the Fed were 
committed to the single goal of controlling inflation, its credibility would be enhanced. 
As we have seen, if the Fed is credible, the private sector will become more responsive 
to changes in monetary policy. For example, long-term interest rates will become more 
responsive to changes in short-term rates if the public understands what the Fed’s 
motives are and what it is doing. And credible policies may actually decrease the need 
for active monetary policies. Having a single goal would also help to keep the Fed free 
of political pressures. Such political pressures might include attempts by one political 
party or the other to stimulate the economy or give financial markets a temporary boost 
before an election.
Other proponents of inflation targeting hold a somewhat less rigid view. Although 
they believe fighting inflation should be the primary objective of the Fed, or of a central 
bank, they believe an inflation-targeting regimen could be designed to give the cen-
tral bank some flexibility. For example, the central bank could be required to target a 
broader range of inflation—say, between 1 and 3 percent—and meet the target several 
years in the future. Under either of these alternatives, central banks would have some 
room to meet employment or other policy objectives besides just inflation. In practice, 
many countries do allow some “wiggle room” in their inflation targeting regimens by 
using broad inflation bands or distant targets.
Before he took over as chairman of the Federal Reserve in 2006, Ben Bernanke was 
an advocate for inflation targeting. While he was a member of the Board of Governors 
in 2003, Bernanke gave a speech outlining his own views on the merits of inflation 
targeting. For Bernanke, inflation targeting increased the effectiveness of monetary 
policy because it provided a long-term anchor for inflation expectations. As long as the 
private sector—individuals and firms—understood the Fed was holding firm to long-
run inflation targets, it would have added flexibility to use aggressive monetary policy 
in the short run to offset adverse shocks to the economy—without upsetting long-run 
inflation expectations. Bernanke called inflation targeting a policy of constrained discre-
tion. Under inflation targeting, the Fed could take actions to offset shocks to real output 
or to the financial system, but it had to keep its long-run inflation targets in clear view. 
After the financial crisis of 2008, Bernanke stopped speaking about inflation targeting 
and devoted his speeches to explaining the Fed’s actions during the crisis and designing 
an “exit strategy” for the Fed’s massive interventions. The current chair, Janet Yellen, 
rarely speaks about inflation targeting and is careful to emphasize both inflation and 
employment.
Even prior to the recent recession, many economists disagreed with the idea of 
inflation targeting because they strongly objected to the Fed concentrating solely on 
controlling inflation. In the United States, Congress and the president are frequently 
incapable of quickly agreeing on a fiscal policy to stave off or end a recession. Of 
course, automatic fiscal stabilizers exist, but they are often not sufficient to cushion 
the economy when a shock hits. Practically speaking, only monetary policy is available 
to stabilize output and prevent deep recessions from emerging. If monetary policy is 

part 6
384
geared solely toward controlling inflation, as inflation-targeting proponents would like, 
and if fiscal policies are difficult for Congress and the president to pass, that leaves the 
government no other tools to fight a recession.
Economists also debate the level for an inflation target. Suppose there were general 
agreement that the ultimate goal should be total price stability—that is, zero inflation. 
There would still be legitimate questions about what constitutes “stable” prices. It 
is very difficult to measure changes in prices accurately when there is a great deal of 
technological change occurring in the economy because technological improvements 
change the quality of goods so rapidly that government statisticians can’t easily catch 
up with them. If, as many economists believe, our price indexes overstate the true infla-
tion rate, annual inflation of 2 percent may in reality be true price stability. In addi-
tion, recent concerns about the zero lower bound for monetary policy—the fact that 
nominal interest rates cannot fall below zero—have also led to the view that the target 
inflation rate should be 2 percent. Having a higher average inflation rate—and higher 
average interest rates—would allow the Fed more room to lower rates and not run up 
against the lower bound. Critics of stabilization policy, of course, believe that not using 
monetary policy to try to stabilize the economy would actually improve our economic 
performance. In their view, attempts to stabilize the economy have done more harm 
than good over the years by making fluctuations worse. In previous chapters, we dis-
cussed the difficulties in conducting stabilization policy. These include lags, uncertain-
ties about the strength and timing of policies, and difficulties in estimating the natural 
rate of unemployment. If you believe these difficulties are insurmountable, you will 
likely think the Fed should target just inflation. If you think they can be overcome, you 
will likely believe the Fed should be allowed to stabilize output and employment, too.
Some economists like the idea of the Fed having to meet targets, but they have 
suggested alternatives to inflation targeting. One approach that has wide appeal was 
developed by economist John Taylor of Stanford University. Taylor suggested that 
the Fed follow a rule that keeps a long-run inflation target but allows the Fed to raise 
or lower interest rates depending on whether output is above or below potential. His 
own analysis suggests that the performance of the Fed would be superior if it followed 
a rule of this type, rather than making ad hoc decisions. The advantage of a rule of this 
nature is that it allows the Fed to offset shocks to the economy, but requires the Fed 
to meet long-run inflation targets.
Another approach that has recently been discussed is price-level targeting. The idea 
would be that the Fed would target the price level, which would grow, for example, at 
the targeted inflation rate of 2 percent per year. How does price-level targeting differ 
from inflation targeting? Suppose that inflation was lower than its target for a period of 
time—for example, inflation was 1 percent for several years rather than the 2 percent 
targeted rate. This would necessarily mean that the price level grew less than 2 percent 
and was also below its trend. Under price-level targeting, the Fed would be required to 
temporarily raise inflation above 2 percent to reach its price-level target. For example, 
it could be required to cause inflation to reach 3-4 percent until the economy reached 
its earlier price-level target. On the other hand, under inflation targeting, the Fed 
would simply be required to raise its inflation rate back to its 2 percent target and not 
go any higher.
Proponents of price-level targeting believe it will more properly balance the goals 
of employment and price stability. On the other hand, critics believe that it is danger-
ous for the Fed to allow inflation to exceed its target, as it may prove difficult to reduce 
inflation at a later time.
Debate 2: If There Were An Inflation Target, Who Would Set It?  
Even if the United States decided to adopt inflation targeting as a policy, several 
important questions would remain. Perhaps the most important is, “Who would set 
the target?”
In the United Kingdom, which adopted targeting in 1992, the elected govern-
ment decides on the inflation target for the central bank. These elected officials typi-
cally specify a range for the inflation rate that the bank must meet. The central bank 

Chapter 17 • Macroeconomic Policy Debates
385
participates in the discussions and has an opportunity to present its views to the public 
through its publications and published minutes of its meetings. But ultimately it is the 
elected government that makes the final decision.
In other countries, the central bank has even more influence in setting the inflation 
target. In New Zealand, for example, the central bank has the responsibility of “achiev-
ing and maintaining stability in the general level of prices” without any competing 
goals, such as stabilizing employment or output. The law also requires the head of the 
central bank and the finance minister to negotiate inflation goals and make them public.
What would be an appropriate arrangement for the United States? Under current 
law, the Fed chair reports regularly to Congress, but the Fed has considerable power to 
use monetary policy to stabilize output as well as to fight inflation as it pleases. Would our 
Congress and president be willing to cede power to the Fed and allow it to focus only on 
fighting inflation? And, if they did, would Congress or the president want to determine 
the target range for inflation and instruct the Fed how quickly to meet these targets?
As you can see, changing our current system would require major decisions about 
who has authority and control over our economic system. Currently, the Fed has con-
siderable power and autonomy. Although inflation targeting might make the Fed more 
independent, another phenomenon could occur, too: Congress and the president might 
end up with more power over monetary policy. And that might lead to more inflation, 
not less. 
Should We Tax Consumption Rather than Income?
As we discussed in earlier chapters, the United States is a country with a low saving rate. 
This hurts our long-run growth prospects because our investment spending is deter-
mined by our own savings and savings from abroad. Many factors—not purely economic 
ones—contribute to our low saving rate. For example, colleges generally give less finan-
cial aid to students whose families have saved for their education. Many of our welfare

Would A Policy Rule Have Prevented The Housing Boom?

however, Taylor found that, compared to past experience, the 
Fed was much too aggressive in lowering interest rates. Inter-
est rates fell from 2 percent in mid-2001 to 1 percent by 2004. 
Past experience, however, would have suggested that the Fed 
would have raised interest rates to 4 percent by 2004—a very 
significant deviation.
Taylor then showed that housing starts—which are very sen-
sitive to interest rates—would have been much lower if the Fed 
had not followed its easy money policy. The boom and bust would 
have been avoided. Finally, as an additional piece of evidence, 
Taylor looked at the experiences of European countries. There 
the same phenomenon occurred. Countries that deviated most 
from the Taylor rule—for example, Spain—experienced the worst 
boom and bust cycles for housing.  Related to Exercise 2.7.

John Taylor from Stanford University has argued that the Fed’s 
“easy money” policy from mid-2001 through 2004 was largely 
responsible for the housing boom in the decade that ultimately 
caused so much financial damage. Taylor used his own model 
of monetary policy—the “Taylor rule”—to analyze the Fed’s 
behavior. In his prior work, he demonstrated that the Fed’s 
behavior could be closely described by a model that allowed 
for some monetary policy tightening and easing in response to 
output movements. Applying this model to the decade of 2000,

programs cut the benefits of families who have saved in the past and still have some 
funds left in their accounts. The U.S. tax system also discourages savings. Here’s how.
In the United States, you must pay taxes on both the wages you earn and the earn-
ings you make on your savings. Suppose you earn $100 at your job and you have a tax rate 
of 20 percent. That means you keep $80 after taxes. Now suppose you save $50 of that 
money and invest it at 10 percent. At the end of 1 year, you will have earned an additional 
$5 on the $50 you saved (10% * $50), but you will get to keep only $4 of it because the 
government will take $1 in taxes (20% * $5). So, you will have to pay the government 
$21 in total: $20 on the $100 you earned in wages, plus $1 on the $5 you earned on your 
savings. If you did not save at all, you would pay only $20 in taxes, not $21.
Not all tax systems work this way. Tax systems based on consumption do not 
penalize individuals who save. Sales taxes in the United States and value-added taxes 
abroad are familiar examples of consumption taxes. It is also possible to create a con-
sumption tax from an income tax by not taxing the earnings on savings—just as we do 
with tax-exempt bonds issued by state and municipal governments. Or, as an alterna-
tive, the government could allow savings to be deducted from gross income before the 
calculation for total taxes owed is made. The key feature of consumption taxation is 
that you do not face any additional taxes if you decide to save more of your income.
There are, however, ways in the United States to save money and still limit your 
taxes. In addition to buying tax-exempt bonds, you can invest in an IRA (individual retire-
ment account) or 401(k), 403(b), and Keogh plans, which are also types of retirement 
accounts. The money in pension funds is treated similarly. It isn’t taxed until the person 
who contributed it retires and withdraws it. During retirement, most people earn less 
money than when they were working, so the tax rate they pay on the money they with-
draw from these accounts is lower than when they saved it. Also, the money accumulates 
more quickly because it grows tax-free while it’s in these accounts. In practice, the U.S. 
tax system is a hybrid system, partway between an income tax and a consumption tax.
Two Debates about Consumption Taxation
Proponents claim that taxes based on consumption will increase total savings and may 
even be more equitable. Let’s explore these claims.
Debate 1: Will Consumption Taxes Lead To More Savings?  There is 
no question that taxing consumption instead of savings creates an incentive to save. 
However, there’s no guarantee the incentive will actually result in more money saved 
in the economy. Suppose the tax burden is shifted to consumption by reducing the tax 
rate on savings. People will want to take advantage of this incentive and reduce their 
consumption and increase their saving. On the other hand, people will also want to 
spend more because, with the tax cut, they are wealthier.
Although there has been much research done on how a consumption tax would 
affect savings, the results are far from conclusive. It is true that individuals will allo-
cate their savings to tax-favored investments over investments that are not favored. 
For example, they will put money into their IRAs. What is not clear is whether the 
funds they will put there are literally new savings—meaning reduced consumption—or 
merely transfers from other accounts, such as conventional savings accounts, which do 
not have the same tax advantages. Untangling these effects is a difficult issue, and it 
remains an active area of ongoing research.
The tax system imposed on corporations in the United States also creates disincen-
tives to save and invest. Suppose you purchase a share of stock in a corporation. When the 
corporation earns a profit, it pays taxes on the profit at the corporate tax rate. When the 
corporation pays you a dividend on the stock out of the profits it earns, you must pay taxes 
on the dividend income that you receive. Corporate income is taxed twice, in other words—
first when it is earned by the corporation and again when it is paid out to shareholders.
Some economists have argued that the corporate taxes lead to less-efficient invest-
ment because they result in capital flowing into other sectors of the economy (into 
real estate, for example) that do not suffer from double taxation. For this reason, in 
consumption taxes
Taxes based on the consumption, not the 
income, of individuals.

Chapter 17 • Macroeconomic Policy Debates
387
2003 Congress passed a bill introduced by President Bush that lowered—but did not 
eliminate—taxes on corporate dividends.
Debate 2: Are Consumption Taxes Fair?  The basic idea behind a consumption 
tax seems fair. Individuals should be taxed on what they take away from the economy’s 
total production—that is, what they consume—not on what they actually produce. If an 
individual produces a lot but does not consume the proceeds from what was produced and 
instead plows it back into the economy for investment, that individual is contributing to the 
growth of total output and should be rewarded, not punished. Individual A earns $50 and 
consumes it all; individual B earns $100 but consumes only $40. Who should pay more?
In practice, moving to a consumption-tax system could have a major impact on the 
distribution of income in the economy. Suppose we simply exempted the returns from 
savings from the income tax. This exception would clearly favor wealthy and high-
income individuals who save the most and earn a lot of income in interest, dividends, 
rents, and capital gains. Table 17.1 hows estimates based on the capital gains received 
by different income classes for the year 2014 and dividends paid by corporations. 
­Capital gains are the profits investors earn when they sell stocks, bonds, real estate, or 
other assets. As you can see, taxpayers with annual incomes exceeding $1,000,000 
earned over half of the economy’s capital gains and dividends over this period. Obvi-
ously, capital assets are highly concentrated among the wealthy.
capital gains
Profits investors earn when they sell 
stocks, bonds, real estate, or other assets.
If capital gains and other types of capital income were not taxed, total tax revenue 
would fall, and the government would have to raise tax rates on everyone to maintain 
the same level of spending. Excluding capital income from taxation does have its costs.
Some economists believe it is important that high-income individuals continue 
to pay a significant share of total taxes. In the last several decades, the distribution of 
income has become more unequal, as superstar athletes, famous actors and musicians, 
CEOs, and successful entrepreneurs and investors have all earned large fortunes. The 
tax system is one way we have to at least partially reduce inequalities in income. Crit-
ics of consumption taxes worry that moving our tax system in that direction will take 
away this important tool for social equality. However, other economists believe that 
high-income individuals already shoulder a very high share of the total tax burden and 
that we need to focus on designing an efficient system to promote economic growth.
Proponents of consumption taxes have tried to meet the challenge of fairness in 
different ways. The “flat tax” designed by Robert E. Hall of Stanford University and 
Alvin Rabushka of the Hoover Institute brings the personal income tax and corporate 
income tax into a single, unified tax system. Under the flat tax, one low, single tax 
rate applies to both businesses and individuals. Businesses deduct their wage payments 
before they pay taxes. In addition, they can deduct any investment spending they make 
from their income before the tax is calculated. Recall that in a simple economy, without 
government or the foreign sector, saving equals investment, S = I. Allowing a deduc-
tion for investment has generally the same effect as allowing a deduction for savings. 
So this flat tax is a type of consumption tax.

This version of the flat tax has an important feature that ensures that wealthy indi-
viduals (and other owners of corporations) still pay taxes. Suppose the corporation or 
business makes an extraordinary return on its investment. Consider, for example, the 
tremendous profit generated by Apple’s iPad. As of October 2014, over 225 million 
iPads have been sold. If the profit for each iPad were $100, Apple’s total profit from 
iPads would be $22.5 billion. Under this version of the flat tax, these extraordinary 
gains would be taxed in full. Owners of a corporation or business may earn extraordi-
nary gains, but if they do, they will pay taxes on them.
The projected federal deficit has led many policymakers to consider whether a 
­European-style value-added tax (VAT) would make sense for the United States. Graft-
ing a VAT on to the U.S. fiscal system would pose many challenges. 
A p p l i c a t i o n  3
Is A Vat In Our Future?
Applying The Concepts #3: Can the United States adopt a European-style value-added tax?
but imports are required to pay the VAT. Rates on the VAT can 
be high—for example, the basic rate in the United Kingdom is 
17.5 percent.
The VAT has some important advantages. It is relatively 
easy to collect and, as a consumption tax, does not penalize 
savings. There are some potential difficulties. Since U.S. states 
already levy retail sales taxes, incorporating a VAT at the state 
level could be difficult and be seen to impinge on state taxing 
authority. In addition, some conservatives worry that it is too 
efficient and consumers will not notice all the taxes they pay. 
Liberals worry that the VAT, like all consumption taxes, could be 
regressive. An old joke goes that the time will come for the VAT 
when liberals recognize it is a money machine and conservatives 
recognize it is regressive.  Related to Exercise 3.7.
Virtually all developed countries and many developing coun-
tries have a value-added tax, commonly known as a VAT. The 
United States is a prominent exception. The VAT is essentially 
a sales tax that is levied on each stage of production. Firms pay 
the VAT on their sales and then receive a credit for VAT paid 
on their purchases. Unlike a sales tax, the VAT is embedded 
in the price of goods. It is rebated when goods are exported 
In this chapter we 
explored three topics that 
are the center of macro-
economic policy debates 
today. Here are the key 
points to remember:
1.  A deficit is the dif-
ference between the 
government’s current 
expenditures and revenue. The government debt is the sum of all 
past yearly deficits.
2.	 Deficits can be financed through either borrowing or money cre-
ation. Financing deficits through money creation is called mon-
etizing the deficit. It leads to inflation.
3.	 Deficits can be good for the country. Automatic stabilizers and 
expansionary fiscal policy both work through the creation of deficits.
4.	 The national debt incurs two burdens on citizens: It can reduce 
the amount of capital in an economy, leading to lower levels of 
income; it can also result in higher taxes that future generations 
will have to pay.
5.	 A number of developed countries have recently changed their 
monetary policy to emphasize targeting the inflation rate or a 
range for the inflation rate.
6.	 Although targeting inflation can increase the credibility of a cen-
tral bank, it does limit the tools left for active stabilization policy.
7.	 A consumption tax would increase the incentives for private sav-
ing. However, it is not clear that total savings would necessarily 
increase, and there would be concerns about the fairness of this 
form of taxation.

1.5	 Debt and Deficits in Belgium. Here are some data 
for Belgium in 1989:
GDP: 6,160 billion Belgian francs
Debt: 6,500 billion Belgian francs
Deficit: 380 billion Belgian francs
Interest Rate on Bonds: 8.5 percent
Use the data to answer the following questions:
a.	 What are the deficit/GDP ratio and debt/GDP 
ratio? How do these ratios compare to the same 
ratios in the United States today? To what period 
in U.S. history does the debt/GDP ratio in Belgium 
correspond?
b.	Approximately how much of the budget in Belgium 
is devoted to interest payments on its debt? If Bel-
gium could wipe out its debt overnight, what would 
happen to its current budget deficit?
1.6	 The Primary Deficit, and Government Debt. The 
gap between spending and taxes, excluding interest on 
the debt, is known as the primary deficit. Suppose there 
is $100 million of outstanding public debt. Suppose 
the interest rate is 2 percent. Explain why any primary 
deficit will lead to the total stock of debt to continue 
to grow over time. If you wanted to stop the debt from 
growing, what primary surplus (the opposite of the pri-
mary deficit) would you need in this case?
1.7	 Fiscally Troubled States Today. A number of major 
states—for example, California—have been experienc-
ing fiscal problems. Although no states have defaulted 
on their debts in recent years, a number of cities have. 
Should the federal government “bail out” the states 
and help them meet their debts? Give one argument 
in favor and one argument against this policy based on 
U.S history. (Related to Application 1 on page 382.)
1.8	 Tax Smoothing or Strategic Tax Policy? Assume 
the pressures of an aging population and increases in 
health-care costs will increase total federal spending in 
the future significantly.
a.	 Under the theory of tax smoothing, what should 
happen to the current level of taxes if future spend-
ing is scheduled to rise?
b.	Now suppose future spending increases are not 
inevitable and that, as a practical matter, you believe 
Congress will spend whatever revenue it collects. 
Would you still recommend tax smoothing?
1.9	 Policy Options for the Federal Budget. The Web 
site for the Congressional Budget Office (www.cbo.gov) 
contains its projections for future budget deficits as 
well as options for decreasing the deficits. Using this 
site, find some options you think are desirable and that 
would have a significant effect on increasing the budget 
surplus.
Should the Fed Target Inflation or Pursue Other 
Objectives?
Summarize the arguments in favor of inflation targeting.
2.1	 In recent years, many developed countries have 
found that inflation targeting 
 (increased/
decreased) the autonomy of their central banks, help-
ing them fight inflation.
2.2	 In 
, inflation targeting was adopted in 1992, 
and elected officials determine the precise inflation tar-
gets that the central bank must meet.
2.3	 Milton Friedman developed a rule for monetary policy 
that maintains a low rate of inflation but allows the 
Fed to adjust interest rates when output deviates from 
potential. 
 (True/False)
2.4	 Price-level targeting is the same as inflation targeting. 
 (True/False)
2.5	 Supply Shocks and Monetary Policy. The lesson 
from the oil price shocks of the 1970s is that supply

shocks are harder for policymakers to cope with than 
demand shocks.
a.	 Use the aggregate demand-and-supply model to 
show the adverse effects of inflation targeting to 
fight a supply shock.
b.	Explain the main advantage of price targeting 
instead of inflation targeting.
2.6	 Inflation Targeting and the Zero Lower Bound. 
Explain carefully why economists who worry about the 
zero lower bound for monetary policy—the fact that 
nominal interest rates cannot fall below zero—would 
want to target a higher inflation rate than those econo-
mists who do not worry about the zero lower bound.
2.7	 The Fed on Autopilot. Some economists believe that 
the Federal Reserve should follow strict rules for the 
conduct of monetary policy. These rules would require 
the Fed to make adjustments to interest rates based on 
information that is fully available to the public, infor-
mation such as the current unemployment rate and the 
current inflation rate. Essentially, they would put the 
Fed on autopilot and remove its discretion. What are the 
pros and cons of such an approach? Would it work in a 
financial crisis? (Related to Application 2 on page 385.)
2.8	 Optimal Inflation Level. All central banks following 
an inflation-targeting regimen aim to keep the inflation 
at a positive rate. For example, the European Central 
Bank (ECB) has a target of below, but close to, 2 per-
cent inflation and the Bank of England has a target of 
close to 2 percent inflation. Explain why central banks 
don’t target zero percent inflation.
Should We Tax Consumption Rather than Income?
Describe the key differences between and consumption taxes.
3.1	 Suppose there is a consumption tax of 20 percent. 
You earn $1,150, have an income tax rate of 30 per-
cent, and save $100 after tax. Your tax will be equal to

3.2	 A sales tax that is levied at all stages of production is 
known as a(n) 
 tax.

because there are more of them.

 are the profit that investors earn by selling 
bonds, stocks, real estate, or other assets.
3.5	 Traditional and Roth IRAs. With a traditional IRA, 
you get to deduct the amount you contribute from your 
current taxable income, invest the funds free from tax, 
but then pay taxes on the full amount you withdraw 
when you retire. Suppose your tax rate is 50 percent 
and you initially deposit $2,000 in an IRA. The pro-
ceeds double in seven years to $4,000. You then retire 
and pay taxes on the $4,000 at your 50 percent rate.
a.	 Taking into account your tax deduction for the IRA, 
how much did your investment in the IRA really 
cost you? What is your return after 7 years?
b.	With a Roth IRA, you do not get a deduction for 
your savings but the interest you earn is tax-free. 
Is the outcome for a Roth IRA the same as for the 
traditional IRA if you invest $1,000 for 7 years and 
double your initial investment?
c.	 Suppose you believed that in seven years tax rates 
would be higher. Are the traditional and Roth IRAs 
still equivalent? If not, which would you prefer?
3.6	 New Savings? Suppose the government developed a 
new program to allow parents to save for their chil-
dren’s college education in tax-free accounts. A wealthy 
parent decides to take advantage of this new program 
and sells some currently taxable bonds and places the 
proceeds into this account. Has this action led to any 
new savings?
3.7	 Why Has the United States Not Instituted a VAT? 
The United States differs from virtually all developed 
countries in that it does not have a VAT. What impor-
tant aspect of the U.S. political system might account 
for this difference with other countries? (Related to 
Application 3 on page 388.)

C h a p t e r
Countries always want to have 
foreign markets open for their 
exporters.
But if a country limits access to its own markets, 
foreign countries may take action to limit access to 
their own markets. The United States, despite an 
overall strong record in trade, is no exception. Here 
are a few examples.
As part of the North American Free Trade Agree-
ment, the United States was required to open its 
borders to trucks from Mexico, although it resisted 
allowing this. As a result, in 2009 Mexico imposed 
tariffs on over $2 billion of U.S. goods, reducing 
employment in U.S. export industries.
In 2010 the United States accused China of selling aluminum products below their fair market value and imposed 
sanctions on the Chinese. In turn, China decided that the United States was doing precisely the same thing with 
nylon products and imposed its own tariffs on these products.
Two years later, the United States again charged China with selling solar cells below cost and unfairly providing 
subsidies to its producers. It imposed steep tariffs on Chinese imports. The Chinese did not look upon this favorably 
and successfully challenged the U.S. actions in world trade tribunals.
Trade agreements can help lower barriers to international commerce, but countries still have to believe that other 
countries are “playing fair.” Otherwise, two can tango.

A
s the world economy grows, U.S. policies toward international trade become 
ever more important. Many people view trade as a “zero-sum game.” They 
believe that if one country gains from international trade, another must lose. 
Based on this belief, they advocate restricting trade with other countries. The United 
States does restrict trade to protect U.S. jobs in many sectors, such as those in the 
apparel and steel industries. One lesson from this chapter is that free trade could make 
all countries better off. The challenge for government officials is to create policies that 
accomplish, or come close to accomplishing, this goal.
In this chapter, we discuss the benefits of international trade and the effects of 
policies that restrict trade.
Benefits from Specialization and Trade
What if you lived in a nation that could produce everything it consumed and didn’t 
depend on any other country for its economic livelihood? If you were put in charge 
of your nation, would you pursue a policy of national self-sufficiency? Although self-
sufficiency might sound appealing, it would actually be better for your country to 
specialize in the production of some products and then trade some of those products 
to other countries. You saw in Chapter 3 that specialization and exchange can make 
both parties better off. In this chapter, we use a simple example to explain the benefits 
of specialization and international trade between two nations.
Let’s say there are two nations, Shirtland and Chipland. Each nation produces 
computer chips and shirts, and each consumes computer chips and shirts. Table 18.1 
shows the daily output of the two goods for the two nations. In a single day, Shirtland 
can produce a maximum of either 108 shirts or 36 computer chips, whereas Chipland 
can produce a maximum of either 120 shirts or 120 computer chips. The last two 
rows of the table show the opportunity costs of the two goods. Recall the principle of 
opportunity cost.

The opportunity cost of something is what you sacrifice to get it.
In Chipland, the trade-off between shirts and chips is one to one: The ­opportunity 
cost of one shirt is one chip, and the opportunity cost of one chip is one shirt. In 
­Shirtland, people can produce three times as many shirts as chips in a given amount 
of time: The opportunity cost of one chip is three shirts. Conversely, the opportunity 
cost of one shirt is one-third of a chip.
Production Possibilities Curve
Let’s start by seeing what happens if Shirtland and Chipland are each self-sufficient. 
Each nation can use its resources (labor, land, buildings, machinery, and equipment) to 
produce its own shirts and chips. The production possibilities curve shows all the possible 

Chapter 18 • International Trade and Public Policy
393
combinations of products that an economy can produce, given that its productive 
resources are fully employed and efficiently used. This curve, which we discussed in 
Chapter 2, provides a menu of production options. To keep things simple, we assume 
the curve is a straight line, indicating a constant trade-off between the two goods. 
As shown by Shirtland’s production possibilities curve in Figure 18.1, the following 
­combinations of chips and shirts are possible:
1	 All shirts and no chips: point a. If Shirtland uses all its resources to produce shirts, 
it will produce 108 shirts per day.
2	 All chips and no shirts: point d. If Shirtland uses all its resources to produce chips, 
it will produce 36 chips per day.
3	 Equal division of resources: point b. Shirtland could divide its resources between 
shirts and chips to produce 54 shirts and 18 chips each day.
▲  Figure 18.1  Production Possibilities Curve
The production possibilities curve shows the combination of two goods that can be produced with a 
nation’s resources. For Chipland, the trade-off between the two goods is one to one. For Shirtland, the 
trade-off is three shirts for every computer chip. In the absence of trade, Shirtland can pick point c—28 
chips and 24 shirts—and Chipland can pick point f—60 chips and 60 shirts.

All the other points on the line connecting points a and d are also feasible. One 
option is point c, with 28 chips and 24 shirts. The steepness of the curve’s slope—
negative 3.0—shows the opportunity cost of computer chips: one chip per three shirts. 
Figure 18.1 also shows the production possibilities curve for Chipland. Chipland can 
daily produce 120 shirts and no chips (point e), 120 chips and no shirts (point g), or any 
combination of chips and shirts between these two points. In Chipland, the trade-off is 
one shirt per computer chip: The opportunity cost of one chip is one shirt, so the slope 
of the production possibilities curve is negative 1.0.

Each nation could decide to be self-sufficient, picking a point on its ­production 
­possibilities curve and producing everything it wants to consume. For example, 
­Shirtland could pick point c, daily producing 28 chips and 24 shirts, and Chipland could 
pick point f, daily producing 60 chips and 60 shirts. In the language of international 
trade, this is a case of autarky, or self-sufficiency (in Greek, aut means “self” and arke 
means “to suffice”).
Comparative Advantage and the Terms of Trade
Would the two nations be better off if each specialized in the production of one good 
and traded with the other nation? To decide which nation should produce a particu-
lar good, we need to look at each good and figure out which nation has the lower 
­opportunity cost of producing it. As you saw in Chapter 3, the nation with the lower 
opportunity cost has a comparative advantage in producing that good. As we emphasized 
in Chapter 3, it is comparative advantage that matters for trade—not absolute advantage, 
the ability of a nation to produce a particular good at a lower absolute cost than that of 
another nation. Let’s see how it works.
1	 Chips produced in Chipland. The opportunity cost of one chip is one shirt in ­Chipland, 
and the opportunity cost of one chip is three shirts in Shirtland. ­Chipland has a 
comparative advantage in the production of chips. Because Chipland sacrifices 
fewer shirts to produce one chip, Chipland should produce chips.
2	 Shirts produced in Shirtland. The opportunity cost of one shirt is one chip in ­Chipland, 
and the opportunity cost of one shirt is one-third of a chip in Shirtland. When it 
comes to producing shirts, Shirtland has a comparative advantage because it sacri-
fices fewer chips to produce one shirt. Shirtland should therefore produce shirts.
Trade will make it possible for people in each specialized nation to consume both 
goods. At what rate will the two nations exchange shirts and chips? To determine the 
terms of trade, the rate at which units of one product can be exchanged for units of 
another product, let’s look at how much Shirtland is willing to pay to get one chip and 
how much Chipland is willing to accept to give up one chip.
1	 To get one chip, Shirtland is willing to pay up to three shirts. That’s how many 
shirts it would sacrifice if it produced its own chip. For example, if the nations 
agree to exchange two shirts per chip, Shirtland could rearrange its production, 
producing one fewer chip but three more shirts. After exchanging two of the newly 
produced shirts for one chip, Shirtland will have the same number of chips but 
one additional shirt.
2	 To give up one chip, Chipland is willing to accept any amount greater than one 
shirt. For example, if the nations agree to exchange two shirts per chip, Chipland 
could rearrange its production, producing one more chip and one fewer shirt. 
After it exchanges the newly produced chip for two shirts, Chipland will have the 
same number of chips but one additional shirt.
The potential for mutually beneficial trade between the two countries is possible 
because the willingness to pay—three shirts by Shirtland—exceeds the willingness to 
accept—one shirt by Chipland. It’s possible for Shirtland and Chipland to split the dif-
ference between the willingness to pay and the willingness to accept, exchanging two 
shirts per chip. This will actually make both countries better off in terms of the total 
amount of goods they can consume. We see why next.
The Consumption Possibilities Curve
A nation that decides to specialize and trade is no longer limited to the options shown 
by its own production possibilities curve. The consumption possibilities curve shows 
the combinations of two goods (computer chips and shirts in our example) that a nation 
can consume when it specializes in one good and trades with another nation.

Figure 18.2 shows the consumption possibilities curve for our two nations, assum-
ing that they exchange two shirts per chip:
• In Panel A, Chipland specializes in chip production, the good for which it has a 
comparative advantage. It produces 120 chips and no shirts (point g). Given the 
terms of trade, Chipland can exchange 40 of its 120 chips for 80 shirts, leading 
to point h. At point h, Chipland can consume 80 chips and 80 shirts.
• In Panel B, Shirtland specializes in shirt production. It produces 108 shirts and 
no chips (point a). Given the terms of trade, it can exchange 80 of its 108 shirts 
for 40 chips, leading to point k on its consumption possibilities curve. Shirtland 
can consume 28 shirts and 40 chips.
▲  Figure 18.2  Consumption Possibilities Curve
The consumption possibilities curve shows the combinations of computer chips and shirts that can be 
consumed if each country specializes and trades. In Panel A, Chipland produces 120 chips and trades 
40 of these chips to Shirtland for 80 shirts. In Panel B, Shirtland produces 108 shirts and trades 80 of 
these shirts to Chipland for 40 chips. The trade allows each nation to consume more.

How do the outcomes with specialization and trade compare to the autarky 
­outcomes? Chipland moves from point f (autarky) to point h, so trade increases the 
consumption of each good by 20 units. Shirtland moves from point c to point k, so this 
nation consumes 12 additional chips and four additional shirts.
In Figure 18.2, each consumption possibilities curve lies above the nation’s 
­production possibilities curves, meaning each nation has more options about how 
much to consume under specialization and trade. In most cases, a nation picks a point 
on the consumption possibilities curve that provides more of each good. Of course, 
this is a very simple example. In the actual world market, many countries produce and 
trade many goods. The marketplace determines what the terms of those trades will be, 
depending on supply, demand, and pricing.
How Free Trade Affects Employment
You’ve now seen that trade allows each nation to consume more of each good. But 
we haven’t yet discussed the effects of trade on employment. Under free trade, each 
nation will begin to specialize in a single good, causing considerable changes in the 
country’s employment in different industries. In Chipland, the chip industry doubles 

part 7
396
in size—output increases from 60 to 120 chips per day—while the shirt industry 
­disappears. Workers and other resources will leave the shirt industry and move to the 
chip industry. In Shirtland, the flow is in the opposite direction: Workers and other 
resources move from the chip industry to the shirt industry.
Is free trade good for everyone? Switching from self-sufficiency to specialization 
and trade increases consumption in both nations, so on average, people in each nation 
benefit from free trade. But some people in both nations will be harmed by free trade. 
In Chipland, for example, people in the shirt industry will lose their jobs when the 
shirt industry disappears. Some workers can easily move into the expanding computer 
chip industry. For these workers, free trade is likely to be beneficial. However, other 
shirt workers will be unable to make the move to the chip industry and will be forced 
to accept lower-paying jobs or face unemployment. Free trade is likely to make these 
displaced workers worse off. There is a saying, “Where you stand on an issue depends 
on where you sit.” In our example, a worker sitting at a sewing machine in Chipland is 
likely to oppose free trade because that worker is likely to lose a job. A worker sitting 
at a workstation in a computer chip fabrication facility is likely to support free trade 
because the resulting increase in computer chip exports will generate more ­employment 
opportunities in that industry.
Protectionist Policies
Now that you know the basic rationale for specialization and trade, we can explore the 
effects of public policies that restrict it. All the restrictions we explore limit the gains 
from specialization and trade. We consider four common import-restriction policies: 
an outright ban on imports, an import quota, voluntary export restraints, and a tariff.
Import Bans
To show how an import ban affects the market, let’s start with an unrestricted ­market—
no import ban. Figure 18.3 shows the market for shirts in Chipland, a nation with a 
comparative advantage in producing computer chips, not shirts. The domestic supply

List the common protectionist policies.
▲  Figure 18.3  Effects of an Import Ban
In the free-trade equilibrium, demand intersects the total supply curve at point c, with a price of $12 and 
a quantity of 80 shirts. If shirt imports are banned, the equilibrium is shown by the intersection of the 
demand curve and the domestic supply curve (point a). The price increases to $23.

curve shows the quantity of shirts supplied by firms in Chipland. Looking at point b, 
we see that Chipland firms will not supply any shirts unless the price is at least $17 per 
shirt. The total supply curve for shirts, which shows the quantity supplied by both 
domestic firms and foreign firms (in Shirtland), lies to the right of the domestic ­supply 
curve. At each price, the total supply of shirts exceeds the domestic supply because 
foreign firms supply shirts, too. Point c shows the free-trade equilibrium. The demand 
curve from domestic residents intersects the total supply curve at a price of $12 per 
shirt and a quantity of 80 shirts. Because this price is below the minimum price for 
domestic firms, domestic firms produce no shirts, and all the shirts in Chipland are 
imported from Shirtland.
What will happen if Chipland bans imported shirts? Foreign suppliers will disap-
pear from the shirt market, so the total supply of shirts will be the domestic supply. 
In Figure 18.3, point a shows the equilibrium when Chipland bans imported shirts: 
The domestic demand curve intersects the domestic supply curve at a price of $23 per 
shirt and a quantity of 60 shirts. In other words, the decrease in supply resulting from 
the import ban increases the price consumers have to pay for shirts and decreases the 
quantity available for them to buy.
Quotas and Voluntary Export Restraints
An alternative to an import ban is an import quota—a government-imposed limit on 
the quantity of a good that can be imported. An import quota is a restrictive policy that 
falls between free trade and an outright ban: Imports are cut, but not eliminated. For 
example, if a quota were put on shirts, the price consumers would have to pay would fall 
somewhere between the price they would pay with free trade ($12 per shirt, as in our 
example) and the price they would pay if imported shirts were banned ($23 per shirt). 
Where exactly the price would fall would depend on how high or low the quotas are.
Import quotas are illegal under international trading rules. To get around these 
rules, an exporting country will sometimes agree to a voluntary export restraint 
(VER). VERs are similar to import bans. When an exporting nation adopts a VER, it 
decreases its exports to avoid having to face even more restrictive trade policies 
importing countries might be tempted to impose on them. Although VERs are legal 
under global-trade rules, they violate the spirit of international free-trade agreements. 
In any case, quotas and VERs have the same effect. Like a quota, a VER increases the 
price of the restricted good, making it more feasible for domestic firms to participate 
in the market.
Figure 18.4 shows the effect of an import quota or VER. Starting from the 
­free-trade equilibrium at point c, an import quota will shift the total supply curve to 
the left: At each price there will be a smaller quantity of shirts supplied because ­foreign 
suppliers aren’t allowed to supply as many. The total supply curve when there is an 
import quota or VER will lie between the domestic supply curve and the total sup-
ply curve under free trade. The equilibrium under an import quota or VER occurs 
at point d, where the demand curve intersects the total supply curve under an import 
­limitation. The $20 price per shirt with the import quota exceeds the $17 minimum 
price of domestic firms, so domestic firms supply 22 shirts (point e). Under a free-trade 
policy, they would have supplied no shirts.
A quota or a VER produces winners and losers. The winners include foreign and 
domestic shirt producers. In our example, foreign firms can sell shirts at a price of $20 
instead of $12 each, and the price is high enough for domestic firms to participate in 
the market. This generates benefits for the firms and their workers. The losers are 
consumers, who pay a higher price for shirts. In some cases, the government issues 
import licenses to some citizens, who can then buy shirts from foreign firms at a low 
price, such as $12, and sell the shirts at the higher domestic price, $20. Because import 
licenses provide profits to the holder, they are often awarded to politically powerful 
firms or individuals. Moreover, because they are so valuable, some people may bribe 
government officials to obtain them.

We know consumers pay higher prices for goods that are subject to protectionist 
policies, but how much more? Here is one example. In the United States, voluntary 
export restraints on Japanese automobiles in 1984 increased the price of a Japanese car 
by about $1,300 and the price of a domestic car by about $660.1
An alternative to a quota or a VER is an import tariff, which is a tax on an imported 
good. Tariffs have the same effect as quotas and VERs. We know from our earlier 
discussions that a tax shifts the supply curve to the left and increases the equilibrium 
price. In Figure 18.4, suppose the tariff shifts the total supply curve with free trade so 
that it intersects the domestic demand curve at point d. In other words, we reach the 
same point we reached with the quota: Consumers pay the same $20 price per shirt, 
and domestic firms produce the same quantity (22 shirts).
There is one fundamental difference between a quota and a tariff. An import quota 
allows importers to buy shirts from foreign suppliers at a low price—say, $12 per 
shirt—and sell them for $20 each, the artificially high price. In other words, importers 
make money from the quota. Under a tariff, the government gets the money, collecting 
$8 per shirt from foreign suppliers. Citizens in Chipland will prefer the tariff to the 
quota because the government can use the revenue from the tariff to cut other taxes or 
expand public programs.
In the real world, tariffs can have major effects. One trade expert estimated that 
cutting industrial tariffs by 50 percent would increase the output of the world’s econ-
omy by $270 billion per year. Similar easing of tariffs on agricultural products would 
cut the world’s food bill by $100 billion.2 Research shows that tariffs appear to dispro-
portionately affect the poor.
Responses to Protectionist Policies
A restriction on imports is likely to lead to further restrictions on trade. For example, if 
Chipland bans shirt imports, Shirtland might retaliate by banning computer chips from 
Chipland. A trade war of this sort could escalate to the point where the two nations 
return to self-sufficiency. If this happens, the two countries would be forced to scale 
back their consumption. We can see that by looking back at Figure 18.2: Chipland will 
move from point h to point f, and Shirtland will move from point k to point c. This sort

▲  Figure 18.4  Market Effects of a Quota, a VER, or a Tariff
An import quota shifts the supply curve to the left. The market moves upward along the demand curve 
to point d, which is between point c (free trade) and a (an import ban). We can reach the same point with 
a tariff that shifts the total supply curve to the same position.

of retaliatory response is common. Because it is, we know that protecting one industry 
in a nation is likely to harm that nation’s other exports. Chipland’s shirt industry, if 
protected from imports, may grow, but it will be at the expense of its computer-chip 
industry.
Many import restrictions have led to retaliatory policies and substantially lessened 
trade. The most famous was the Smoot−Hawley Tariff Act of 1930. When the United 
States increased its average tariff on imports to 59 percent, its trading partners retali-
ated with higher tariffs on U.S. products. The resulting trade war reduced international 
trade and deepened the worldwide depression of the 1930s.
The threat of retaliatory policies may persuade a nation to loosen its protectionist 
policies. For example, in 1995 the United States announced it would impose 100 ­percent 
tariffs on Japanese luxury cars if Japan didn’t ease its restrictions on imported auto 
parts. Just hours before the tariffs were to take effect, the two nations reached an agree-
ment that was expected to increase the sales of U.S. auto parts to Japanese firms. In 
2002, President George W. Bush imposed tariffs on steel. However, when faced with 
the threat of retaliatory policies in Europe, he ended the sanctions in 2003.
Import restrictions also create an incentive to smuggle goods. The restric-
tions create a gap between the cost of purchasing the restricted goods abroad 
and the price goods can be sold for in the protected economy, so there is a profit 
to be made.
What Are the Rationales for Protectionist Policies?
Why would a government impose protectionist policies such as an import ban, quota, 
VER, or tariff? We look at three possible reasons:
1	 To shield workers from foreign competition
2	 To nurture infant industries until they mature
3	 To help domestic firms establish monopolies in world markets
Learning Objective 18.3
Describe the rationales that have been 
offered for protectionist policies.
A p p l i c a t i o n  1
The Impact of Tariffs on the Poor
Applying the Concepts #1: Do tariffs (taxes) on imported goods hurt the poor disproportionately?
example, footwear accounts for 1.3 percent of the expenditure 
of lower-income households, as compared to 0.5 percent for 
higher-income households.
Moreover, even within these categories of goods for 
which tariffs are high, the highest tariffs fall on the cheapest 
­products—precisely those that will be purchased by lower-
income ­consumers. For example, low-price sneakers face a 
32 percent tariff whereas expensive track shoes face only a 
20 percent tariff. In general, to protect U.S. industries, tariffs are 
highest on labor-intensive goods, goods that use relatively more 
labor than capital. But these goods tend to be lower priced. That 
is why tariffs do fall disproportionately on the poor.  Related to 
Exercise 2.7.

Government Printing Office, February 2006), chap. 7.
Economists have found that tariffs in the United States fall 
most heavily on lower-income consumers. In the United States, 
tariffs are very high on textiles, apparel items, and footwear. 
These goods represent a higher fraction of the consumption of 
lower-income households than higher-income households. For 

part 7

To Shield Workers from Foreign Competition
One of the most basic arguments for protectionism is that it shields workers in ­industries 
that would be hurt by trade. Suppose, relative to the United States, nations in the Far 
East have a comparative advantage in producing textiles. If the United States were to 
reduce existing tariffs on textiles, domestic manufacturers could not compete. They 
would have to close their factories and lay off workers. In an ideal world, the laid-off 
workers would take new jobs in other sectors of the economy. In practice, this is ­difficult. 
Many workers don’t immediately have the skills to go to work in other sectors, and 
obtaining those skills takes time. Moreover, the textile ­industry is heavily concentrated 
in the southeastern part of the United States. Politicians from that region will try to 
keep tariffs in place to prevent temporary unemployment and changes in ­employment 
patterns in their areas—they have an incentive to protect their own constituents, even 
though it may cause major economic losses for the economy. The result of this pro-
tection will be less-efficient production, higher prices, and lower consumption for the 
United States. How much does it cost to protect a job?
To Nurture Infant Industries until They Mature
During World War II the United States built hundreds of boats, called Liberty ships, 
for the navy. As more and more of these ships were built, each required fewer hours to 
complete because workers acquired knowledge during the production process and got 
better at it. Engineers and economists call this phenomenon learning by doing. To 
learn a new game, such as ping-pong, you learn by doing. At first, you may find it 
­difficult to play, but your skills improve as you go along.
Tariffs and other protectionist policies are often defended on the grounds that they 
protect new or infant industries that are in the early stages of development and can 
benefit from learning by doing. A tariff shields a young industry from the competition 
of its more mature rivals. After the infant industry “grows up,” the tariff can eventually 
be eliminated because the industry is able to compete. In practice, infant industries 
rarely become competitive with their foreign rivals. During the 1950s and 1960s, many 
Latin American countries used tariffs and other policies to protect their young manu-
facturing industries from foreign competition, a policy known as import substitution. 
Unfortunately, the domestic industries never became as efficient as foreign suppliers, 
and the Latin American countries that tried this policy suffered. Another problem with 
protecting an infant industry is that once a government gives an industry tariff protec-
tion, it is difficult to take that protection away. More generally, even some established 
companies also complain about “unfair competition,” but this concept does not always 
make sense.
To Help Domestic Firms Establish Monopolies in World Markets
If the production of a particular good requires extremely large economies of scale, the 
world market will support only a few, or perhaps just one, firm. In this case, a nation 
might be tempted to adopt policies to ensure a company within its borders will end up 
being the world monopolist. Suppose the commercial aircraft industry can support only 
one large firm. If two firms enter the industry, both will lose money. A nation could 
agree to provide financial support to a domestic firm to guarantee the firm will make 
a profit. With such a guarantee, the domestic firm will enter the industry. Knowing 
this, a foreign firm will be reluctant to enter, so the domestic firm will capture the 
monopoly profit. The country where the successful firm is located will benefit from 
higher production and more jobs for its citizens.
One famous example is Airbus, an airplane-manufacturing consortium in Europe 
that competes with the U.S. firm Boeing. Several European countries provided large 
subsidies for the firms producing the Airbus line of planes. These subsidies allowed the 
consortium firms to underprice their rivals in the United States, and at least one U.S. 
manufacturer of commercial airplanes was forced out of business.

What could go wrong with these monopoly creation policies? First, if both 
nations subsidize their domestic firms, both firms will enter the market and lose 
money. The taxpayers in both countries will then have to pay for the subsidies. 
Second, a nation may pick the wrong industry to subsidize. Together, the British 
and French subsidized an airplane known as the Concorde, which flew at supersonic 
speeds, rapidly shuttling passengers between Europe and the United States. Although 
the Concorde captured the market, the market was not worth capturing. The venture 
lost money because the Concorde was very costly to develop and fly, and few people 
were willing to pay a large premium for supersonic travel. The Concorde stopped 
flying in 2003. Finally, the subsidized firm may not perform well. As an example, 
in 2006, Airbus was facing severe problems with its planes and losing business to its 
competitor, Boeing.
A Brief History of International Tariff and Trade Agreements
Today, the average U.S. tariff is 4.6 percent of the value of imported goods, a rate close 
to the average tariffs in Japan and most European nations but very low by historical 
standards. When the Smoot−Hawley tariffs were implemented in the 1930s, the aver-
age U.S. tariff was a whopping 59 percent of a product’s price. Tariffs are lower today 
because several international agreements subsequently reduced them.
The first major international trade agreement following World War II was the 
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). This agreement was initiated 
in 1947 by the United States and 23 other nations and now has over 149 members. 
Nine rounds of GATT negotiations over tariffs and trade regulations have taken 
place, resulting in progressively lower tariffs for the member nations. The last com-
pleted set of negotiations, the Uruguay round (1994), decreased tariffs by about 
one-third of the previous level. In 1995, the World Trade Organization (WTO) 
was formed to enforce GATT and other international trade agreements. Under 
GATT’s “most favored nation” provision, a country that reduces tariffs for one

Chinese Imports and Local Economies
Applying The Concepts #2: What have been the local effects of Chinese imports?
Those communities that were more exposed to imports had 
larger increases in workers receiving unemployment insurance, 
food stamps, and disability payments.
These findings do not mean that trade with China was not 
ultimately beneficial. Displaced workers can find new jobs and 
import competition lowers prices for all consumers. But it does 
mean that the burden of adjustment to imports varies by region. 
Some regions will have a more difficult time adjusting than ­others 
to a sudden influx of imports. The study also does not mea-
sure the indirect benefits from trade with China. As the Chinese 
economy expanded during this period, it created more export 
opportunities for producers in the United States. Those benefits 
were not measured in this study.  Related to Exercise 3.7.

Do imports from China really make a difference in U.S. labor

Hanson examined detailed data on Chinese imports into 
local communities. Some local communities are more heavily 
impacted by Chinese imports than others depending on the mix 
of products produced locally. The authors found that the pace 
of Chinese import growth was so rapid from 1990 to 2007 that 
it often had a strong and negative effect on local economies.

nation must do so for all members of GATT. This provision helps reduce tariffs 
throughout the world.
The most recent round of trade negotiations began in Doha, Qatar, in 2001 but 
major negotiations collapsed in 2008, although the negotiations still continue on a 
smaller scale. This round was billed as an attempt to benefit developing countries that 
exported agricultural goods. The idea was that reductions in subsidies and tariffs on 
agriculture goods in developed countries would promote exports of agriculture goods 
for developing countries. In turn, developed countries wanted lower tariffs for indus-
trial goods in developing countries. Why did the negotiations fail? One reason was 
that China and India, rapidly growing countries each with populations over a billion, 
were more interested in promoting their industrial bases than their agricultural exports. 
Perhaps a second reason was that previous trade negotiations had been successful, 
­leaving less room for “grand bargains” that would motivate all countries to embrace 
new agreements.
If global negotiations do not work, what alternatives are there? In addition to 
the large group of nations in the WTO, other groups of nations have formed trade 
­associations to lower trade barriers and promote international trade. Here are some of 
the best-known agreements:
• The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) took effect in 1994 and 
was implemented over a 15-year period. It eliminates all tariffs and other trade 
barriers between Canada, Mexico, and the United States.
• The European Union (EU) was designed to remove all trade barriers within 
Europe and create a single market. Initially, the EU consisted of just six 
­countries: Belgium, Germany, France, Italy, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands. 
­Denmark, Ireland, and the United Kingdom joined in 1973; Greece in 1981; 
Spain and ­Portugal in 1986; and Austria, Finland, and Sweden in 1995. In 2004, 
the ­biggest-ever enlargement took place, with 10 new countries joining the EU.
• The leaders of 18 Asian nations have formed an organization called Asian Pacific 
Economic Cooperation (APEC). In 1994, APEC signed a nonbinding agreement 
to reduce trade barriers among these nations.
• The Dominican Republic–Central America Free Trade Agreement (DR-
CAFTA) promotes trade liberalization between the United States, the ­Dominican 
­Republic, and five Central American countries: Costa Rica, El Salvador, 
­Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua. DR-CAFTA is modeled after NAFTA.
Some economists are concerned that these regional trade agreements may stand 
in the way of broader international trade agreements under GATT. Although regional 
agreements may lead to reduced tariffs for neighboring or member countries, they do 
little to promote efficiency across the globe. For example, a Belgian firm may find it 
easier to sell goods in France than does a firm from South America that has a lower 
cost of production.
Recent Policy Debates and Trade Agreements
We’re now ready to discuss three recent policy debates concerning international trade:
1	 Are foreign producers dumping their products?
2	 Do trade laws inhibit environmental protection?
3	 Do outsourcing and trade cause income inequality?
Are Foreign Producers Dumping Their Products?
Although tariff rates have been reduced in recent years, a number of controversies 
­surrounding free trade remain. One of these relates to dumping. A firm is dumping 
when the price it charges in a foreign market is either lower than the price it charges

403
in its home market or lower than its production cost. Dumping is illegal under 
­international trade agreements. Hundreds of cases of alleged dumping are presented 
to WTO authorities each year. Here are some cases in which the WTO concluded that 
dumping had indeed occurred: Hong Kong VCRs sold in Europe; Chinese bicycles 
sold in the United States; Asian TV sets sold in Europe; steel from Brazil, India, Japan, 
and Spain sold in the United States; U.S. beef sold in Mexico; and Chinese computer 
disks sold in Japan and the United States. Under the current provisions of the WTO, 
a nation can impose antidumping duties, a tax, on products that are being dumped 
within its borders.
Why would a firm dump—charge a low price in the foreign market? The first 
reason is price discrimination. Price discrimination occurs when a firm charges a 
­different price to different customers buying the same product. If a firm has a monopoly 
in its home market but faces strong competition in a foreign market, it will naturally 
charge a higher price in the home market. What the firm is doing is using its monopoly 
power to charge higher prices to consumers at home and charge lower prices to 
­consumers abroad where it faces competition. This strategy maximizes the firm’s

of Korean VCRs.3
In the 1980s there were only three firms, all Korean, selling VCRs in Korea, but 
there were dozens of firms selling VCRs in Europe. The lack of competition in Korea 
generated very high prices for Korean consumers, who paid much more than Euro-
pean consumers paid for identical Korean VCRs and VCRs produced by firms in other 
countries. Essentially, Korean firms used their market power to discriminate against 
consumers in their own country. When international trade authorities concluded these

Does Losing In The Wto Really Matter?
Applying the Concepts #3: How do decisions by the WTO affect trade disputes between countries?
China and announced these tariffs in December 2014. Most U.S. 
installers of solar equipment were opposed to this action—they 
did not want to see prices of solar panels rise. But the largest 
manufacturer of solar panels in the United States, Solar World, 
an American subsidiary of a German company, had pushed the 
U.S. Department of Commerce hard for these tariffs. Producers 
in China and Taiwan threatened to return to the WTO and pursue 
their legal claims, claiming that the U.S. action violated trade 
laws. But since this would take at least several years to wind 
its way through the WTO, they also began planning to move 
their production of solar panels to other countries that would 
not be subject to the tariffs. Ultimately the WTO can affect the 
actions of its member countries, but rapid resolution of disputes 
requires ongoing negotiations between countries.  Related to 
Exercise 5.7.

In July 2014, the World Trade Organization ruled that the 
United States had violated international trade laws by ­imposing 
­excessive tariffs on Chinese imports on a range of goods, 
­including solar panels. The WTO asked the U.S. to conform 
its countervailing duties against dumping to international 
­standards. The U.S. agreed to abide by these rulings. However, 
this was not the end of the controversy.
Meanwhile, at the same time, the U.S. was planning to 
impose new tariffs on solar panels imported from Taiwan and

companies were, indeed, dumping VCRs in Europe, the Korean firms responded by 
cutting prices in their home market. However, they didn’t increase their prices in 
Europe—much to the delight of European consumers and the dismay of European 
producers, who had sought relief from the dumping in the first place.
The Korean VCR example brings up a second reason for dumping: predatory 
pricing—cutting prices in an attempt to drive rival firms out of business. The predatory 
firm sets its price below its production cost, low enough that both the predator and its 
prey (a firm in the foreign market) lose money. After the prey goes out of business, the 
predator increases its price to earn a monopoly profit.
Although the rationale for antidumping laws is to prevent predatory pricing, it is 
difficult to determine whether low prices are the result of this or price discrimination. 
Many economists are skeptical about how frequently predatory pricing actually occurs, as 
opposed to price discrimination. They suspect many nations use their antidumping laws 
as protectionist policies in disguise. Because WTO rules limit tariffs and quotas, some 
nations may be tempted to substitute antidumping duties for these protectionist policies.
Until the 1990s, antidumping cases were brought almost exclusively by Australia, 
New Zealand, Europe, Canada, and the United States. However, starting in the 1990s, 
the number of antidumping cases alleged by developing countries began to rise. Today, 
approximately half the cases are brought by developing countries. Professor Thomas 
Prusa of Rutgers University has studied antidumping and has found it is a potent 
weapon for protecting domestic industries. If an antidumping case is settled and a tariff 
is imposed as a result, imports typically fall by 50–70 percent during the first 3 years 
of the protection period. Even if a country loses a claim, imports still fall by 15–20 
percent.4
Do Trade Laws Inhibit Environmental Protection?
In recent trade negotiations, a new player—environmental groups—appeared on the 
scene. Starting in the early 1990s, environmentalists began to question whether policies 
that liberalized trade could harm the environment. They were concerned that increased 
trade would lead to worldwide environmental degradation. An important issue that 
attracted their attention was the killing of dolphins by tuna fishers.
Anyone who catches tuna with a large net will also catch the dolphins that swim 
with the tuna, and most of the dolphins will die. In 1972, the United States outlawed the 
use of tuna nets by U.S. ships. However, ships from other nations, including ­Mexico, 
were still catching tuna with nets and selling that tuna in the United States. The United 
States responded with a ban of Mexican tuna caught with nets. The ­Mexican govern-
ment complained to an international trade authority that the tuna boycott was an unfair 
trade barrier. The trade authority agreed with Mexico and forced the United States to 
remove the boycott.
Under current WTO rules, a country can adopt any environmental standard it 
chooses, as long as it does not discriminate against foreign producers. For example, 
the United States can limit the exhaust emissions of all cars that operate in the United 
States. As long as emissions rules apply equally to all cars, domestic and imports, 
the rules are legal according to the WTO. An international panel upheld U.S. fuel-­
efficiency rules for automobiles on this principle.
The tuna boycott was a violation of WTO rules because killing dolphins does not 
harm the U.S. environment directly. For the same reason, the United States ­cannot 
ban imported goods produced by factories that generate air or water pollution in other 
countries. It is easy to understand why WTO rules do not allow countries to restrict 
trade on the basis of the methods that are used to produce goods and services. ­Countries 
differ in the value they place on the environment. For example, a poor nation may be 
willing to tolerate more pollution if it means attaining a higher standard of living for 
its citizens.
If trade restrictions cannot be used to protect the dolphins and deal with other 
global environmental problems, what else can we do? Shouldn’t we have the right to 
predatory pricing
A firm sells a product at a price below 
its production cost to drive a rival out of 
business and then increases the price.

protect dolphins? International agreements have been used for a variety of different 
environmental goals, from limiting the harvest of whales to reducing the chemicals 
that deplete the ozone layer. These agreements are difficult to reach, however, so some 
nations will be tempted to use trade restrictions to pursue environmental goals. If they 
do, they will encounter resistance because WTO rules mean that a nation can pursue 
its environmental goals only within its own borders. In recent years, environmentalists 
have lobbied Congress not to approve bilateral trade deals unless sufficient environ-
mental standards are in place. This trend is likely to continue.
Trade disputes about environmental issues are part of a larger phenomenon 
that occurs when trade issues and national regulations collide. At one time, most 
trade ­disputes were simply matters of protecting domestic industries from foreign 
­competition. Agriculture, textile, and steel industries around the world frequently 
benefited from various forms of protection. But in recent years, a new breed of trade 
disputes has erupted revolving around social problems and the role that government 
regulation should play in solving them.
The EU, for example, has banned imports of hormone-treated beef. The United 
States and Canada successfully challenged this ban with the WTO. They argued 
there was no scientific evidence that hormone-treated beef adversely affected human 
health. The EU refused to rescind the ban and, as a consequence, the United States 
and ­Canada were permitted to impose retaliatory tariffs on a wide range of European 
­products that affected many EU industries.
The EU’s ban on hormone-treated beef was intended to protect European farmers 
from imports, but it also reflected Europeans’ nervousness about technology. After all,

How American Are American Cars?
Applying the Concepts #4: How has the worldwide trade in automobile parts 
affected the U.S. auto industry?
United Highway Safety Administration regularly reports this data 
for all light vehicles. As a result of these changes, cars are now 
more competitively priced for consumers and the U.S. is better 
able to export its cars and compete on world markets.
Yet, these changes have adversely affected domestic 
manufacturers of auto parts that now must compete with other 
countries to supply parts to the automakers. With lower wages 
abroad and sophisticated transport systems to deliver parts, 
U.S. parts manufacturers face global pressures, similar to work-
ers in other industries. This is now a familiar consequence of 
globalization that affects virtually all industries. The automo-
bile industry is not immune from these global pressures. Large 
manufacturers of auto parts have responded by globalizing 
themselves and producing parts around the globe.  Related to 
Exercise 5.9.
SOURCES: James Hagerty and Jeff Bennett, “U.S. Car Making Boom?: Not for 
Auto-Industry Workers,” Wall Street Journal, March 23, 2015, and National High-
way and Safety Administration, “Part 583 American Automobile Labelling Act 
(AALA), 2015.” Available at: http://www.nhtsa.gov/Laws+&+Regulations/Part+

During the recent financial crisis, the U.S. government took 
strong steps to keep the automobile industry alive. These 
efforts appeared to be a great success story, with record U.S. 
exports of automobiles in 2014. But U.S. manufactured cars 
are not what they were even 5 years ago. There has been an 
explosive growth in imports of automobile parts from outside 
the U.S. and Canada. Our “U.S. cars” have increasing amounts 
of foreign content.
Consider the Ford Fiesta. In 2010, 90 percent of the parts 
in the Fiesta came from parts suppliers in the United States 
and Canada. By 2015, that percentage had fallen to 55 percent. 
Other makes and models of cars experienced similar trends. The

Europe banned all hormone-treated beef, not just imported beef. Shouldn’t a country 
have a right to pursue this policy, even if it is not based on the best science of the day? 
Although the costs of the policy are straightforward in terms of higher beef prices, the 
benefits, in terms of potential safety and peace of mind, are much more difficult to assess. 
Similar issues have arisen as genetically modified crops have become more ­commonplace. 
As a world trading community, we will have to decide at what point we allow national 
policy concerns to override principles of free trade.
Do Outsourcing and Trade Cause Income Inequality?
Inequality in wages has been growing in the United States since 1973. The wages of 
skilled workers have risen faster than the wages of unskilled workers. World trade has 
also boomed since 1973. Could there be a connection between the two?
Trade theory suggests a link between increased trade and increased wage 
­inequality. Here is how they might be linked. Suppose the United States produces 
two types of goods: one using skilled labor (say, airplanes) and one using unskilled 
labor (say, textiles). The United States is likely to have a comparative advantage in 
products that use skilled labor, and developing countries are likely to have a compara-
tive advantage in products that use unskilled labor. An increase in world trade will 
increase both exports and imports. An increase in U.S. exports means we’ll need to 
produce more goods requiring skilled labor, so the domestic demand for skilled labor 
will increase, and so will the wages of these workers. At the same time, an increase 
in U.S. imports means we’ll be buying more goods produced by unskilled laborers 
abroad, so the demand for unskilled workers here will decrease, and these people’s 
wages will fall. As a result, the gap between the wages of the two types of workers in 
the United States will grow.
In addition, U.S. firms will produce some components of their goods and services 
overseas, which is known as outsourcing. If a firm outsources products that use 
unskilled labor, the demand for unskilled labor in the United States will decline, and 
this will also increase the gap between wages for the skilled and the unskilled.
Economists have tried to determine how much trade has contributed to growing 
wage inequality in the United States. As usual, other factors make such a determination 
difficult. It is difficult, for example, to distinguish between the effects of trade and the 
effects of technical progress. Technical change, such as the rapid introduction and use 
of computers, will also tend to increase the demand for skilled workers and decrease 
the demand for unskilled workers. Economists have noted, however, that the exports 
of goods using skilled labor and the imports of goods using unskilled labor have both 
increased, just as the theory predicts. Nonetheless, at least some of the increased wage 
inequality is caused by international trade. Trade, however, may also reduce the prices 
of goods and services purchased by consumers in different income classes. We must 
take this factor into account in assessing trade and inequality.
One response to this undesirable side effect of trade is to use trade restrictions 
to protect industries that use unskilled workers. Another approach is to make the 
transition to an economy with more skilled than unskilled jobs less traumatic. In the 
long run, of course, workers will move to industries that require skilled labor, and 
they will eventually earn higher wages. However, in the short run the government 
could facilitate the transition by providing assistance for the education and training 
of unskilled workers.
More recently, there has been another concern. In recent years, jobs in call centers 
for airlines and credit card companies, customer service and technical support for com-
puters, and the work of writing computer code have been relocated overseas. Some of 
these jobs require considerable skill, and therefore not all jobs that are outsourced will 
be low-skilled jobs. Nor can all services be outsourced, particularly those that are less 
routine. In the coming years, we will gain better insights into how international trade 
and outsourcing affect the wages of skilled workers.

Why Do People Protest Free Trade?
We have seen some of the important policy issues surrounding trade. Under ­current 
international trade rules, a country cannot dictate the terms under which another 
­country actually produces the goods and services it sells—even if production harms 
the environment. It is also possible that free trade can contribute to inequality within 
the United States, although lower prices for goods consumed partially offset this effect. 
But do these reasons explain the passion we sometimes see in protests against free trade, 
such as the riots in 1999 in Seattle at a WTO meeting or the protestors dressed in 
death masks gathering at world trade meetings? Possibly, but protestors are more likely 
driven by something very basic. As we have seen in this chapter, trade and specializa-
tion provide important opportunities to raise living standards throughout the globe. 
But they also mean individuals and nations surrender some of their independence and 
sovereignty. By not producing precisely what we consume, we become dependent on 
others to trade with us. By cooperating with other nations, we need to develop agreed-
upon rules that, at times, limit our own actions.
The protestors may simply not understand the principles of trade, but they also 
may fear loss of cultural identity and independence. In today’s world, “no man is an 
island.” Nations have become increasingly dependent on one another. Multinational 
corporations are the ultimate symbol of this interdependence, producing and distribut-
ing goods on a global scale. Thus companies such as McDonald’s, Starbucks, or Nike 
can come under attack by protestors. The benefits of trade, however, are so vast that 
countries will need to find ways to address issues of sovereignty and control while 
retaining an open and prosperous trading system.
In this chapter, we dis-
cussed the benefits of 
specialization and trade, 
and we explored the 
trade-offs associated 
with protectionist policies. 
There is a basic conflict 
between consumers who 
prefer free trade because 
free trade decreases prices and workers in the protected industries 
who want to keep their jobs. Here are the main points of the chapter:
1.	 If one country has a comparative advantage vis-à-vis another 
country in producing a particular good (a lower opportunity cost), 
specialization and trade will benefit both countries.
2.	 An import ban or an import quota increases prices, protecting 
domestic industries, but domestic consumers pay the price.
3.	 Because the victims of protectionist policies often retaliate, the 
protection of a domestic industry can harm an exporting industry.
4.	 A tariff, a tax on imports, generates revenue for the government, 
whereas an import quota—a limit on imports—generates rev-
enue for foreigners or importers.
5.	 In principle, the laws against dumping are designed to prevent 
predatory pricing. In practice, predatory pricing laws are often 
used to shield domestic industries from competition. Allegations 
of it are hard to prove.
6.	 Under World Trade Organization (WTO) rules, each country may 
pursue its environmental goals only within its own borders.
7.	 International trade has contributed to the widening gap between 
the wages of low-skilled and high-skilled labor. However, it also 
has reduced the relative prices facing the poor, offsetting some 
of the effects on inequality.

Benefits from Specialization and Trade
Explain carefully the terms comparative advantage and terms 
of trade.
1.1	 A country has a comparative advantage if it has a lower 
_________ cost of producing a good.
1.2	 The terms of trade is the rate at which two goods can 
be _________ for one another.
1.3	 Suppose a country has a comparative advantage in 
shirts but not computer chips. Workers in the chip 
industry will be _________ with trade.
1.4	 Countries will always export the goods in which they 
have comparative advantage. _________ (True/False)
1.5	 Finding Comparative Advantage. In 8 hours, Coun-
try Alpha can produce either 5,000 roses and no tulips 
or 2,500 tulips and no roses. Similarly, in 8 hours, 
Country Beta can produce either 6,000 roses or 4,000 
tulips.
a.	 Compute the opportunity costs of roses and tulips 
for each country. Which country has a comparative 
advantage in producing roses? Which country has a 
comparative advantage in producing tulips?
b.	Draw the production possibilities curves for the two 
countries.
1.6	 Benefits from Trade. In Country A, the opportunity 
cost of a box is 10 sticks. In Country B, the opportunity 
cost of a box is 200 sticks.
a.	 Suppose the two countries split the difference 
between the willingness to pay for boxes and accept 
boxes. Compute the terms of trade, that is, the rate 
at which the two countries will exchange boxes and 
sticks.
b.	Suppose the two countries exchange one box for the 
number of sticks dictated by the terms of trade you 
computed in part (a). Compute the net benefit from 
trade for each country.
1.7	 Measuring the Gains from Trade. Consider two 
countries, Tableland and Chairland, each capable of 
producing tables and chairs. Chairland can produce the 
following combinations of chairs and tables:
	
All chairs and no tables: 36 chairs per day
	
All tables and no chairs: 18 tables per day
Tableland can produce the following combinations of 
chairs and tables:
	
All chairs and no tables: 40 chairs per day
	
All tables and no chairs: 40 tables per day
In each country, there is a fixed trade-off of tables for 
chairs.
a.	 Draw the two production possibilities curves, 
with chairs on the vertical axis and tables on the 
­horizontal axis.
b.	Suppose each country is initially self-sufficient 
and divides its resources equally between the two 
goods. How much does each country produce and 
consume?
c.	 Which country has a comparative advantage in 
­producing tables? Which country has a ­comparative 
advantage in producing chairs?
d.	If the two countries split the difference between the 
buyer’s willingness to pay for chairs and the seller’s 
willingness to accept, in terms of chairs per table, 
what are the terms of trade?
e.	Draw the consumption possibilities curves.
f.	 Suppose each country specializes in the good for 
which it has a comparative advantage, and it exchanges 
14 tables for some quantity of chairs. Compute the 
consumption bundles—bundles mean the consump-
tion of tables and chairs—for each country.

tage. Would you be helped or hurt in the short run?

Protectionist Policies
List the common protectionist policies.
2.1	 If a country bans the importation of a particular good, 
the market equilibrium is shown by the intersection of 
the _________ curve and the _________ curve.
2.2	 The equilibrium price under an import quota is 
_________ (above/below) the price that occurs with an 
import ban and _________ (above/below) the price that 
occurs with free trade.
2.3	 From the perspective of the government, import 
licenses are better than import quotas because you raise 
money. _________ (True/False)
2.4	 Threatening to impose a tariff on a country’s exports 
if it doesn’t open up its markets to trade is an example 
of a _________ policy.
2.5	 Incentives for Smuggling. If a country bans imports, 
smugglers may try to penetrate its markets. Suppose 
Chipland bans shirt imports, causing some importers to 
bribe customs officials who “look the other way” as smug-
glers bring shirts into the country. Your job is to combat 
shirt smuggling. Use the information in Figure 18.3 on 
page 396 to answer the following questions:
a.	 Suppose importers can sell their shirts on the world 
market at a price of $12 per shirt. How much is an 
importer willing to pay to get customs officials to 
look the other way?
b.	What sort of change in trade policy would make 
your job easier?
2.6	 Tariffs on Computer Chips. Suppose a ­country 
imposed tariffs on computer chips to protect its 
­chip-making industries. What other types of firms in 
that economy might object to this policy?
2.7	 Tariffs and the Poor. Historically, apparel and ­textiles 
were subject to high tariffs. Explain why this might 
hurt low-income consumers more than high-income 
consumers. (Related to Application 1 on page 399.)
2.8	 Auctioning Import Licenses. In the text we explained 
that tariffs can be set to have the same effects as import 
quotas. However, if the government gives import 
licenses to producers, it will not collect any revenues. 
Suppose the government auctions the import licenses 
to the highest bidders. How will the revenue from the 
auction compare to the revenue raised by tariffs?
What Are the Rationales for Protectionist Policies?
Describe the rationales that have been offered for protectionist 
policies.
3.1	 The _________ industry argument is often given to 
provide a rationale for tariffs for new firms.
3.2	 Knowledge gained during production is known as 
_________ by doing.
3.3	 If only one firm can exist in a market, a government 
may try to subsidize the firm so that the country can 
share in the _________ profits.
3.4	 In the 1950s and 1960s, countries in Latin America 
used tariffs and other policies in their goal of reducing 
_________ and promoting domestic industry.
3.5	 Learning by Doing? An industry has been operating 
for 2 years under protection. The government wants 
to remove the trade protection, but the industry claims 
that it needs the protection because of learning by 
doing. Evaluate its claim. Can you think of a circum-
stance where it could be false?
3.6	 Two Countries Fighting over Car Production. Sup-
pose there are monopoly profits in the production of 
cars, but two countries are each determined to capture 
the industry. One country uses a policy measure to sup-
port its domestic firm, but the other country cannot 
match the tactic as it violates its competition policy. As 
a result, only one of the firms stays in business. Who 
gains and who loses? Consider the effects on the firms, 
consumers, and taxpayers.
3.7	 Why the Pace of Imports May Matter. If it rains very 
hard during a major storm, the drains in the streets may 
not be able to handle all the water and flooding will 
temporarily occur. Use this analogy to explain why the 
pace of imports into a community may be important 
in the short run for economic adjustment. (Related to 
Application 2 on page 401.)
3.8	 Protection for Candle Makers. In a famous tale, 
French economist Frédéric Bastiat (1801–1850) wrote a 
fake petition for relief from trade for the candle ­makers. 
They were complaining that the sun was ­hurting their 
business. What lesson do you draw from this tale?
A Brief History of International Tariff and Trade Agreements
Summarize the history of international trade agreements.
4.1	 The latest trade round is called the _________ round.
4.2	 The _________ was formed in 1995 to oversee GATT.
4.3	 NAFTA took effect in _________ and was implemented 
over a _________ year period between _________, 
Mexico, and _________.
4.4	 When Smooth-Hawley tariffs were implemented in the 
year _________, the average tariff rate in the United 
States was _________ percent.
4.5	 A Major Change in U.S. Trade Policy? In Chapter 7  
of the 2015 Economic Report of the President (http://www.
gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/ERP-2015/pdf/ERP-2015-­chapter7​
.pdf), the authors of the report present ­evidence that 
free-trade agreements have led to more overall trade. 
Discuss the evidence that they present.
4.6	 Expansion in the European Union. When the 
EU originated, member countries generally had 
similar standards of living. However, with the most 
recent expansion of the EU, countries that were less 

410
­developed joined the developed countries. What impli-
cations might the entry of the new countries have for 
wage inequality within the more established European 
countries?
4.7	 Trade in Intellectual Property. Trade in interna-
tional property (for example, patents, licenses, roy-
alty agreements) has been particularly controversial. 
The 2015 Economic Report of the President discusses this 
issue in Chapter 7 (http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/ERP-
2015/pdf/ERP-2015-chapter7.pdf). What are their main 
points?
Recent Policy Debates and Trade Agreements
Analyze one recent controversy in trade policy.
5.1	 Price discrimination occurs when a good is sold at 
_________ (higher/lower/similar/different) prices to 
different consumers.
5.2	 Under global trade rules, the United States was 
allowed to ban Chinese bicycles because China vio-
lated U.S. dumping rules to enter the American mar-
ket. _________ (True/False)
5.3	 Suppose the United States has a comparative advantage 
in textiles that use skilled labor. If the United States 
trades with China, which has a comparative advantage 
in textiles using unskilled labor, the wage differences 
between skilled and unskilled labor will _________ in 
China. 
5.4	 Under a scheme of _________ pricing, a firm cuts its 
price to drive out rivals and then raises its price later.
5.5	 Trade in Genetically Modified Crops. Suppose the 
residents of a country become fearful of using geneti-
cally modified crops in their food supply. Consider the 
following two possible scenarios:
a.	 Aware of consumer sentiment, the largest supermar-
ket chains in the country vow they will not purchase 
food products that use genetically modified crops.
b.	The government, aware of voter sentiment during 
an election year, bans the import of the food prod-
ucts that use genetically modified crops.
In both cases, no genetically modified crops enter the 
country. Does either of these cases run afoul of WTO 
policies?
5.6	 Blinder versus Bhagwati on Outsourcing of 
­Services. In an essay in the journal Foreign Affairs, 
Princeton economist Alan Blinder warned that the 
United States potentially faces great dangers from 
outsourcing of services. Columbia economist ­Jagdish 
Bhagwati was highly skeptical of this argument. 
Read both articles and come to your own assess-
ment. The Blinder article, “Offshoring: The Next 
Industrial ­Revolution,” Foreign Affairs (March/April 
2006), is available at http://www.foreignaffairs.com/

York: Council of Foreign Relations, October 15, 2007), 
is available at http://www.cfr.org/trade/dont-cry-free-
trade/p14526, accessed March 2015.
5.7	 Business Adversaries. Explain why domestic pro-
ducers of solar panels had a different view on tariffs 
on foreign manufacturers than did firms that retailed 
and installed solar panels. (Related to Application 3 on 
page 403.)
5.8	 To Whom Should China Be Compared? Under 
U.S. dumping rules, China is classified as a ­nonmarket 
economy so other market economies are used to 
­calculate prices for dumping. Until recently, China 
was compared to India, but now it is compared to 
­Thailand. Using Thailand rather than India as a com-
parison country was one of the key reasons that China

When Mario Draghi took over as 
president of the European Central 
Bank in 2011, he inherited one of 
the most difficult financial positions 
the world had to offer.
He was thrust into the center of the crisis in the euro 
that threatened the financial viability of the largest insti-
tutions in Europe. He had to work with countries that 
wanted more liberal and expansive monetary policies 
and other countries that feared inflation, debt, and 
monetary excess.
Draghi came well prepared for this job. He received his Ph.D. in Economics at the Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology, overlapping with fellow student former Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke. There he studied with Nobel 
Laureates Franco Modigliani and Robert Solow, as well as Stanley Fischer, formerly Governor of the Bank of Israel 
and now Vice-Chair of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve. His career included time at the World Bank, 
Goldman Sachs, director of the Italian treasury, and Governor of the Bank of Italy.
As one of his early acts, he took the aggressive step of making low interest, long-term loans to European 
banks, effectively providing them with a financial cushion to meet the oncoming economic difficulties. But the 
question remained whether, despite Draghi’s skills, the entire European financial system could continue without 
fundamental changes.

ll currencies are traded 24 hours a day. The value of every currency depends 
on news and late-breaking developments throughout the world. Rising 
gas prices, a new terrorist attack, or a change in the leadership of a foreign 
­government can easily affect the price at which currencies trade with one another. 
If the U.S. ­Secretary of the Treasury utters a casual remark about the dollar or the 
value of the Chinese currency, it reverberates instantly throughout the world. Modern 
­communications—e-mail, instant messaging, smartphones, videoconferencing, and 
satellite transmissions—accelerate the process.
How do changes in the value of currencies affect the U.S. economy? In prior 
chapters, we explored the role of monetary policy in an open economy and its effects 
on exchange rates. In this chapter, we take a more comprehensive and in-depth 
look at exchange rates as well as other aspects of the international financial system. 
­Understanding our international financial system will help you to interpret the often 
complex financial news from abroad. For example, if the value of the dollar starts to fall 
against the Japanese yen, what does it mean? Is this good news or bad news?
How Exchange Rates Are Determined
In this section, we examine how the value of a currency is determined in world markets. 
We then look at the factors that can change the value of a currency.
What Are Exchange Rates?
To conduct international transactions between countries with different currencies, it 
is necessary to exchange one currency for another. The exchange rate is defined as 
the price at which we can exchange one currency for another.
Suppose a U.S. songwriter sells the rights of a hit song to a Japanese producer. The 
U.S. songwriter agrees to accept $50,000. If the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar 
and Japanese yen is 100 yen per dollar, it will cost the Japanese producer 5,000,000 yen 
to purchase the rights to the song. Because international trade occurs between nations 
with different currencies, the exchange rate—the price at which one currency trades 
for another currency—is a crucial determinant of trade. Fluctuations in the exchange 
rate can have a huge impact on what goods countries import or export and the overall 
trade balance.
Throughout this chapter, we measure the exchange rate in units of foreign ­currency 
per U.S. dollar, that is, as 100 Japanese yen per dollar or 0.8 euro per dollar. The euro 
is the common currency in Europe. With these exchange rates, you would receive 
100 yen for each dollar, but only 0.8 euro for each dollar.
We can think of the exchange rate as the price of dollars in terms of foreign 
­currency. Recall from Chapter 14 that an increase in the value of a currency relative 
to the currency of another nation is called an appreciation of a currency. If the exchange 
rate between the dollar and the yen increases from 100 yen per dollar to 110 yen per 
dollar, one dollar will purchase more yen. Say, for instance, you’ve taken a trip to Japan 
for spring break. Because the dollar has appreciated, your dollar will exchange for more 
yen. You will now have more yen to spend on Japanese goods—say, flat-screen televi-
sions, DVD players, or entertainment—than you had before the dollar appreciated. 
The dollar has become more expensive in terms of yen. Its price has risen, in other 
words. Because the dollar has increased in value, we say the dollar has appreciated 
against the yen.
A depreciation of a currency is a decrease in the value of a currency relative to the 
­currency of another nation. If the exchange rate falls from 100 to 90 yen per ­dollar, 
you’ll get fewer yen for each dollar you exchange. Japanese goods—whose prices remain 
the same in Japanese yen—will become more expensive to U.S. residents. You’ll have 
to use more dollars to obtain the yen to purchase the same MP3 and DVD players. 
The price of dollars in terms of yen has fallen, in other words, so we say the dollar has 
depreciated against the yen.

Chapter 19 • The World of International Finance

Be sure you understand that if one currency appreciates, the other must ­depreciate. 
If the dollar appreciates against the yen, for example, the yen must depreciate against 
the dollar. You’ll get more yen in exchange for the dollar, but now when you trade 
your yen back, you’ll get fewer dollars. For example, if the dollar appreciates from 
100 to 110 yen per dollar, when you trade 100 yen back into U.S. currency, no longer 
will you get $1.00—you’ll get just $0.91. Conversely, if the dollar depreciates against 
the yen, the yen must appreciate against the dollar. If the dollar depreciates from 
100 yen to 90 yen per dollar, when you trade back 100 yen, you’ll get $1.11, rather 
than just $1.00.
The exchange rate enables us to convert prices in one country to values in another 
country. A simple example illustrates how an exchange rate works. If you want to buy 
a watch from France, you need to know what it would cost. You e-mail the store in 
France and are told the watch sells for 240 euros. The store owners live in France and 
want to be paid in euros. To figure out what it will cost you in dollars, you need to 
know the exchange rate between euros and dollars. If the exchange rate is 0.8 euro per 
dollar, the watch will cost you $300:
240 euros
0.8 euro per dollar = $300
If the exchange rate is one euro per dollar, the watch will cost only $240. As you 
can see, changes in the exchange rate will affect the prices of goods purchased on 
world markets and partly determine the pattern of imports and exports throughout 
the world.
How Demand and Supply Determine Exchange Rates
How are exchange rates determined? The exchange rate between U.S. dollars and euros 
is determined in the foreign-exchange market, the market in which dollars trade for 
euros. To understand this market, we can use demand and supply. In Figure 19.1, we 
plot the demand and supply curves for dollars in exchange for euros.
The supply curve is the quantity supplied of dollars in exchange for euros. 
­Individuals or firms that want to buy European goods or assets will need to exchange 
dollars for euros. The supply curve is drawn under the assumption that as euros become 
cheaper, total spending on European goods and assets will increase. Therefore, the 
▲  Figure 19.1  The Demand for and Supply of U.S. Dollars

414
supply curve slopes upward: As the value of the dollar increases, more dollars will be 
supplied to the currency market in exchange for euros.
The demand curve represents the quantity demanded of dollars in exchange for 
euros. Individuals or firms in Europe that want to buy U.S. goods or assets must trade 
euros for dollars. For example, to visit Disney World in Florida, a German or French 
family must exchange euros for dollars. As the exchange rate for the U.S. dollar falls, 
dollars become cheaper in terms of euros. This makes U.S. goods and assets less expen-
sive for European residents because each euro buys more U.S. dollars. As U.S. goods 
and assets become cheaper, we assume more European residents will want to trade 
euros for dollars. Therefore, the demand curve for dollars in exchange for euros slopes 
downward: Total demand for dollars will increase as the price of the dollar falls, or 
depreciates, against the euro.
Equilibrium in the market for foreign exchange occurs where the demand curve 
intersects the supply curve. In Figure 19.1, equilibrium occurs at an exchange rate of 
0.8 euro per dollar. At this price, the willingness to trade dollars for euros just matches 
the willingness to trade euros for dollars. The foreign exchange market is in balance, 
and the price of euros in terms of a dollar is $1.25.
Price of euros per dollar in equilibrium:
0.8 euro per dollar = 1 dollar
0.8 euro = 1.25 dollars per euro, or $1.25 per euro
Now, however, suppose the demand and supply forces between dollars and euros 
change. If the exchange rate, e, increases, the dollar buys more euros—the price of 
­dollars in terms of euros increases, in other words. For example, if e increases from 
0.8 euro per dollar to 1 euro per dollar, the dollar has become more valuable—meaning 
it has appreciated against the euro. Be sure you see both sides of the same exchange 
coin: If the dollar appreciates against the euro, then the euro must depreciate against 
the dollar. So, if the exchange rate increases from 0.8 to 1 euro per dollar, what will 
the price of a single euro be now?
When the dollar appreciates, each euro is worth less. In this case, the price of the 
euro will fall from $1.25 per euro to $1.00 per euro.
Dollar appreciates:
1.0 euro per dollar = 1 dollar
1 euro = 1.0 dollar per euro, or $1.00 per euro
If the exchange rate falls from 0.8 euro to 0.6 euro per dollar, the dollar has depre-
ciated in value against the euro—the price of dollars in terms of euros has decreased, 
in other words. When the dollar depreciates, each euro is worth more. In this case, the 
price of the euro will rise from $1.25 to $1.67.
Dollar depreciates:
0.6 euro per dollar = 1 dollar
0.6 euro = 1.67 dollars per euro, or $1.67 per euro
Changes in Demand or Supply
Changes in demand or changes in supply will change equilibrium exchange rates. In 
Figure 19.2, we show how an increase in demand, a shift of the demand curve to the 
right, will increase, or appreciate, the exchange rate. U.S. dollars will become more 
expensive relative to euros as the price of U.S. dollars in terms of euros increases.
Two factors are the main causes of shifts of the demand curve for dollars. First, 
higher U.S. interest rates will lead to an increased demand for dollars. With higher 
returns in U.S. markets, investors throughout the world will want to buy dollars to invest 
in U.S. assets. The other factor, lower U.S. prices, will also lead to an increased demand 
for dollars. For example, if prices at Disney World fell, there would be an overall increase 
in the demand for dollars because more tourists would want to visit Disney World.

Chapter 19 • The World of International Finance
415
Figure 19.3 shows the effects of an increase in the supply of dollars, a shift in the 
supply curve to the right. An increase in the supply of dollars will lead to a fall, or 
depreciation, of the value of the dollar against the euro. What are the main causes of 
an increase in the supply of dollars? Again, the same two factors: interest rates and 
prices. Higher European interest rates will lead U.S. investors to purchase European 
bonds or other interest-paying assets. Purchasing European bonds will require U.S. 
investors to supply dollars for euros, which will drive down the exchange rate for 
dollars. Lower European prices will also lead to an increase in the supply of dollars 
for euros.
▲  Figure 19.2  Shifts in the Demand for U.S. Dollars
An increase in the demand for dollars will increase (appreciate) the dollar’s exchange rate. Higher U.S.

Let’s summarize the key facts about the foreign exchange market, using euros as 
our example:
1	 The demand curve for dollars represents the demand for dollars in exchange for 
euros. The curve slopes downward. As the dollar depreciates, there will be an 
increase in the quantity of dollars demanded in exchange for euros.
2	 The supply curve for dollars is the supply of dollars in exchange for euros. The 
curve slopes upward. As the dollar appreciates, there will be an increase in the 
quantity of dollars supplied in exchange for euros.
3	 Increases in U.S. interest rates and decreases in U.S. prices will increase the 
demand for dollars, leading to an appreciation of the dollar.
4	 Increases in European interest rates and decreases in European prices will 
increase the supply of dollars in exchange for euros, leading to a depreciation of 
the dollar.
Real Exchange Rates and Purchasing Power Parity
As our examples of Disney World and watches from France indicate, changes in mar-
ket exchange rates can affect the demand for a country’s goods and services. However, 
we have been assuming that the prices of watches and trips to Disney World do not 
change. In general, prices do change over time, so we need to adjust the exchange rate 
determined in the foreign exchange market to take into account changes in prices. This 
adjustment is an application of the real-nominal principle.
Learning Objective 19.2
Distinguish between the nominal 
exchange rate and the real exchange 
rate.
R e a l- N o m i n a l  P r i n c i p l e
What matters to people is the real value of money or income—its 
purchasing power—not the face value of money or income.
Economists have developed a concept called the real exchange rate that adjusts the 
market exchange rates for changes in prices. The real exchange rate is defined as the 
price of U.S. goods and services relative to foreign goods and services, expressed in a 
common currency. We measure it by expressing U.S. prices for goods and services in 
foreign currency and comparing them to foreign prices. Here is the formula for the 
real exchange rate:
real exchange rate =
exchange rate * U.S. price index
foreign price index
We can use this formula to help us understand the factors that change the real 
exchange rate. First, an increase in U.S. prices will raise the real exchange rate. When 
foreign prices and the exchange rate are held constant, an increase in U.S. prices will 
raise the relative price of U.S. goods. Second, an appreciation of the dollar when prices 
are held constant will also increase the price of U.S. goods relative to foreign goods. 
And if foreign prices fall, U.S. goods will become relatively more expensive as well.
Notice that the real exchange rate takes into account changes in a country’s prices 
over time because of inflation. Suppose Country A had an inflation rate of 20 ­percent, 
and Country B had no inflation. Suppose, too, the exchange rate of ­Country A’s ­currency 
depreciated 20 percent against the currency of Country B. In this case, there would 
be no change in the real exchange rate between the two countries. Although prices 
in Country A would have increased by 20 percent, its currency would be 20 ­percent 
cheaper. From the point of view of residents of Country B, nothing has changed at 
all—they pay the same price in their currency to buy goods in Country A.
real exchange rate
The price of U.S. goods and services 
relative to foreign goods and services, 
expressed in a common currency.

Chapter 19 • The World of International Finance
417
Economists have found that a country’s net exports (exports minus its imports) 
will fall when its real exchange rate increases. For example, if the U.S. real exchange 
rate increases, the prices of U.S. goods will increase relative to foreign goods. This 
will reduce U.S. exports because our goods will have become more expensive; it will 
also increase imports to the United States because foreign goods will have become 
cheaper. As a result of the decrease in U.S. exports and the increase in U.S. imports, 
net exports will decline.
Figure 19.4 plots an index of the real exchange rate for the United States against 
net exports as a share of GDP from 1980 to 2014, a period in which there were large 
changes in the real exchange rate and net exports. The index, called a multilateral real 
exchange rate, is based on an average of real exchange rates with all U.S. ­trading ­partners. 
Notice that when the multilateral real exchange rate increased, U.S. net exports fell. 
As you can see in the figure, starting in both 1983 and 1996 the real exchange rate 
increased sharply. Subsequently, net exports as a share of GDP fell. A decrease in 
the real exchange rate increases net exports. For example, in 1986 and 2005, the 
real exchange rate began to decrease and net exports subsequently increased. The 
­relationship between the real exchange rate and net exports is not perfect, ­however—
other factors, such as the growth of GDP, also affect net exports.

Real exchange rates vary over time, as shown in Figure 19.4. But for goods traded 
easily across countries (such as gold bars), we would expect the price to be the same 
when expressed in a common currency. For example, the price of gold bars sold in 
France should be nearly identical to the price of gold bars sold in New York. If the 
price were higher in France, demand would shift to New York, raising the price in New 
York and lowering the price in France until the prices were equal. The tendency for 
easily tradable goods to sell at the same price when expressed in a common currency is 
known as the law of one price. Metals, agricultural commodities, computer chips, and 
other tradable goods follow the law of one price.
If all goods were easily tradable and the law of one price held exactly, exchange 
rates would reflect no more than the differences in the way the price levels are 
expressed in the two countries. For example, if a basket of goods in Europe costs

across countries should sell at the same

3,000 euros and the identical basket costs $3,750 in the United States, an exchange 
rate of 0.8 euros to one dollar would make the costs the same in either currency 
same in either currency ($3,750 * 0.8 euros/dollar = 3,000 euros).
According to one theory of how market exchange rates are determined, they simply 
reflect differences in the overall price levels between countries. According to the theory 
of purchasing power parity, a unit of any given currency should be able to buy the 
same quantity of goods in all countries. In our European—U.S. example, the theory of 
purchasing power parity predicts a market exchange rate of 0.8 euro per dollar. At that 
exchange rate, European and U.S. goods would sell for the same price if their products 
were expressed in a common currency. Research has shown that purchasing power 
parity does not hold precisely.
Many systematic studies have confirmed that purchasing power parity does not 
give fully accurate predictions for exchange rates. The reason is that many goods, such 
as housing and services such as haircuts, are not traded across countries. The law of one

Big Macs in Switzerland
Applying the Concepts #1: How can the price of a Big Mac in Switzerland shed 
light on the Swiss—U.S. exchange rate?
At this “Big Mac” exchange rate—1.36 Swiss francs to 
every U.S. dollar—the Big Mac in Switzerland would cost the 
same as in the United States. However, the actual exchange 
rate for the Swiss franc in January 2015 when these prices 
were computed was 0.86 Swiss francs per U.S. dollar, so the 
Big Mac was more expensive in Switzerland. Relative to the 
exchange rate implied by the law of one price, the Swiss franc 
was ­substantially more expensive than predicted. The major 
reason for this is that ­Switzerland is viewed as a very safe 
­country and the Swiss franc is not part of the euro, which is 
under ­considerable stress.  Related to Exercises 2.6 and 2.7.
SOURCES: Based on data from The Economist, available at: http://www 
.economist.com/content/big-mac-index, accessed March 2015.
Looking at the price of hamburgers across the world can 
­actually provide insights into the behavior of currency markets. 
For a number of years, the magazine The Economist measured 
the price of a Big Mac throughout the world and used these 
prices to explore whether currency values were too high or too 
low compared to the law of one price. Table 19.1 contains the 
results for selected countries, including Switzerland.
Big Macs sell for widely different prices around the globe, 
as measured in dollars compared to the $4.79 price in the United 
States in January 2015. They are a bargain in China at $2.77, but 
very expensive in Switzerland at $7.54. Table 19.1 also contains 
the market-exchange rate predicted by the theory of purchasing 
power parity. To obtain this exchange rate, divide the price of 
Big Macs in the foreign country by the dollar price. For example, 
for Switzerland the purchasing power exchange rate is
6.5 Swiss francs (the price of a Big Mac in Switzerland)
$4.79 (the price of a Big Mac in the United States)

price does not hold for nontraded goods, which make up approximately 50 percent of 
the value of production in an economy. These goods tend to be cheaper in less devel-
oped countries. There is some truth to purchasing power parity because exchange rates 
do reflect differences in the price level between countries. But, as the example with the 
Big Mac shows, purchasing power parity can provide a clue to exchange rates in some 
circumstances.
The Current Account, the Financial Account,  
and the Capital Account
In this section, we examine international transactions in more detail. A useful frame-
work for understanding international transactions is the balance of payments, a system 
of accounts that measures transactions of goods, services, income, and financial assets 
between domestic households, businesses, and governments and residents of the rest 
of the world during a specific time period.
Economists find it useful to divide international transactions in the balance of 
payments into three types: the current account, the financial account, and the ­capital 
account. These measures provide the most comprehensive picture of a country’s 
­balance of trade with the rest of the world and the consequences of that trade for 
a country’s ownership of assets, such as stocks, bonds, and real estate. A country’s 
­current account is the sum of its
• net exports (exports minus imports),
• net income received from investments abroad, and
• net transfer payments from abroad (such as foreign aid).
If a country has a positive current account, we say that its current account is in 
surplus. If a country has a negative current account, we say that its current account is in 
deficit. If the income from investments abroad and net transfer payments is negligible, 
the current account becomes equivalent to a country’s net exports.
A country’s financial account transactions include all the purchases and sales of 
existing financial and produced assets (stocks, bonds, real estate) by the private sector 
and the government. The financial account is defined as the value of the country’s net 
sales (sales minus purchases) of assets. If the United States sold $100 billion net in 
assets, its financial account would be $100 billion. If the value on the financial account 
is positive, we say the country has a surplus on the financial account. Similarly, if the 
value on the financial account is negative, we say it has a deficit on the financial account.
A country’s capital account transactions consist of two components. First, they 
include the purchase or sale of nonproduced, nonfinancial assets, such as patents, 
­copyrights, trademarks, and leases. Second, they also include transfers of capital, such 
as debt forgiveness or migrants’ transfers (goods or financial assets accompanying 
migrants as they leave or enter the country). Capital account transactions are much 
smaller in magnitude than transactions on the current or financial account.
Rules for Calculating the Current, Financial, and Capital Accounts
Here is a simple rule for understanding transactions on the current, financial, and 
capital accounts: Any action that gives rise to a demand for foreign currency is a deficit 
item. Any action that gives rise to a supply of foreign currency is a surplus item.
Let’s apply this rule to the current account and the financial account, taking the 
point of view of the United States (a similar logic applies to the capital account):
1	 Current account. Items imported into the United States show up as a deficit 
(­negative) on the current account because we have to trade U.S. currency for 
foreign currency to buy them. Items exported from the United States show up as 
a surplus (positive) in the current account because foreigners have to trade their

currency for U.S. dollars to buy those products. Income from investments abroad 
and net transfers received are treated like exports because they result in a supply 
of foreign currency for dollars. Summarizing, we have
U.S. current account surplus = U.S. exports - U.S. imports 
+ net income from foreign investments + net transfers from abroad
2	 Financial account. The purchase of a foreign asset by a U.S. resident leads to a 
deficit (negative) item on the financial account because it requires a demand for 
foreign currency. (You can think of the purchase of a foreign asset as just another 
import.) A purchase of a U.S. asset by a foreign resident leads to a supply of foreign 
currency and a surplus (positive) item on the financial account. (Think of this as 
an export.) Summarizing, we have
U.S. financial account surplus = foreign purchases of U.S. assets 
- U.S. purchases of foreign assets
The current, financial, and capital accounts of a country are linked by a very 
­important relationship:
current account + financial account + capital account = 0
The current account plus the financial account, plus the capital account must sum to 
zero. Why?
To keep things simple, let’s ignore the relatively minor capital account ­transactions. 
In that case, the current plus financial accounts must sum to zero because any excess 
demand for foreign currency that arises from transactions in goods and services—
that means we’re looking at the current account—must be met by an excess supply of 
foreign currency arising from asset transactions—the financial account. Suppose the 
United States has a current account deficit of $50 billion, which means it is importing 
more than it is exporting. This excess demand of foreign currency by people in the 
United States can be met only by an excess supply of foreign currency that arises from 
the financial account—where foreign residents are purchasing $50 billion more in U.S. 
assets than U.S. residents are purchasing of foreign assets. In other words, the current 
account deficit is offset by the financial account surplus.
Let’s look at this from a slightly different angle. Consider again the case in which 
the United States is running a current account deficit because imports from abroad 
exceed exports. (For simplicity, transfers and income earned from investments abroad 
are both zero.) The current account deficit means that, on net, foreign residents and 
their governments are the recipients of dollars because they have sold more goods to 
the United States than they have purchased.
What do foreign residents do with these dollars? They can either hold the 
­dollars or use them to purchase U.S. assets. In either case, foreign residents and their 
­governments have acquired U.S. assets, either dollars or other U.S. assets, such as U.S. 
Treasury bills. The value of these assets is the U.S. current account deficit. Because a 
sale of a U.S. asset to a foreign resident is a surplus item on the U.S. financial account, 
the value of the financial account will be equal to the negative of the value of the current 
account. So, from this perspective also, the current account and the financial account 
must sum to zero.
If a country runs a current account surplus—it is exporting more than importing, 
in other words—the country acquires foreign exchange. The country can either keep 
the foreign exchange or use it to buy foreign assets. In either case, its purchases of net 
foreign assets will equal its current account surplus. Because the financial account is 
the negative of the purchases of net foreign assets, the current account and financial 
account will again sum to zero.
Table 19.2 shows the balance of payments for the United States for 2014: the 
current account, the financial account, and the capital account. The current account 
is made up of the balance in goods, services, net investment income, and net transfers. 

Chapter 19 • The World of International Finance
421
In 2014, the United States had a negative balance on the goods account and net trans-
fer, but a positive balance on the services and net income category. However, the large 
negative balance on the goods account made the overall current account balance nega-
tive. The financial account includes net increases in U.S. holdings abroad (negative 
entries in the financial account) and foreign holdings of U.S. assets (positive entries 
in the financial account). Because the government collects the current account, finan-
cial account, and capital account data from separate sources, a statistical discrepancy 
occurs. Once we include this statistical discrepancy and other minor adjustments, the 
current account, the financial account, and the capital account sum to zero.
Since 1982, the United States has run a current account deficit every year. This 
means the United States has run a financial plus capital account surplus of equal value 
for these years as well. Because a financial account surplus means foreign nations 
acquire a country’s assets, the United States has reduced its net holding of foreign 
assets. In 1986, the U.S. Department of Commerce estimated the United States had a 
net international investment position of $136 billion, meaning U.S. holdings of 
foreign assets exceeded foreign holdings of U.S. assets by $136 billion.
Because of its current account deficits, the U.S. net international investment posi-
tion fell every year. By 2014 the U.S. net international investment position was nega-
tive $6.9 trillion, meaning foreign residents owned $6.9 trillion more U.S. assets than 
U.S. residents owned foreign assets. You may have heard the United States referred 
to as a net debtor. This is just another way of saying the U.S. net international invest-
ment position is negative. As a consequence of the United States being a net debtor, 
earnings from international assets flow out of the United States to foreign countries. 
In the future, part of the incomes earned in the United States will be paid to foreign-
ers abroad. This is a natural consequence of the United States being a net debtor.
Here is another way to think of the relations between the current account and 
the financial accounts. When the United States runs a trade deficit, U.S. residents are 
spending more on goods and services than they are currently producing. Although 
the United States does sell many goods and services abroad (such as supercomputers, 
movies, DVDs, and accounting services), it buys even more goods and services from 
abroad (such as clothes, electronics, and machine tools).
A trade deficit forces the United States to sell some of its assets to individuals or gov-
ernments in foreign countries. Here is how it works: When U.S. residents buy more goods 
abroad than they sell, they give up more dollars for imports than they receive in dollars 
from the sale of exports. These dollars given up to purchase imports end up in the hands 
of foreigners, who can then use them to purchase U.S. assets such as stocks, government 
bonds, or even real estate. In recent years, Asian investors, including foreign governments, 
have bought a variety of assets in the United States, including U.S. Treasury bonds and 
even stakes in investment banking firms. Foreign governments have accumulated consider-
able assets and invested them in private markets abroad through sovereign investment 
funds. Current estimates place the value of assets in these funds at $5.8 trillion.
The purchase of U.S. assets by foreign investors should not be surprising because 
we have been running large trade deficits with many Asian economies, especially China.

These countries were willing to sell us more goods than we were selling to them, and 
therefore they accumulated U.S. dollars with which they could purchase U.S. assets. 
There is considerable debate about whether the very large U.S. current account deficits 
can continue. 
Fixed and Flexible Exchange Rates
To set the stage for understanding exchange rate systems, let’s recall what happens 
when a country’s exchange rate appreciates—increases in value. There are two distinct 
effects:
1	 The increased value of the exchange rate makes imports less expensive for the 
residents of the country where the exchange rate appreciated. For example, if 
the U.S. dollar appreciates against the euro, European watches will become less 
expensive for U.S. consumers. U.S. consumers would like an appreciated dollar 
because it would lower their cost of living.
2	 The increased value of the exchange rate makes U.S. goods more expensive on 
world markets. A U.S. exchange appreciation will increase imports, such as Euro-
pean watches, but decrease exports, such as California wine.
Because exports fall and imports rise, net exports (exports minus imports) will 
decrease. Similarly, when a country’s exchange rate depreciates, there are two distinct 
effects:
1	 For example, if the U.S. dollar depreciates against the Japanese yen, Japanese 
imports will become more expensive in the United States, thereby raising the cost 
of living in the United States.
2	 At the same time, U.S. goods will become cheaper in world markets. U.S. exports 
will rise and imports will fall, so net U.S. exports will increase.

Tax Havens and Global Imbalances
Applying the Concepts #2 How does accounting for investments made in tax havens help explain 
some puzzles in international finance?
In pioneering work, Gabriel Zucman, an economist at the 
London School of Economics, has begun to resolve these 
anomalies. Using new data sets, he found that over 8 percent 
of all global wealth is held through tax havens—such as the 
Cayman Islands—and these assets go unrecorded. Moreover, 
the owners of these assets reside primarily in the developed 
countries. They use complicated corporate structures and 
bank secrecy laws to hold their funds in tax havens. Once 
one accounts for these assets, a new picture of international 
finance emerges. Instead of being a net debtor, Europe is a 
net creditor and the U.S. international position is not nega-
tive as the data suggest. Zucman’s findings should lead to a 
major rethinking of key trends in international finance.  Related 
to Exercise 3.7.

U.S. Net Debtors and Net Creditors?” Quarterly Journal of Economics (2013), pp.

Two major puzzles arise in the international financial statistics. 
First, there appears to be more investment income paid than 
received each year. Since every dollar paid must go to someone, 
this shows a gap in the statistics. The other puzzle is that accord-
ing to international statistics, it is the developing countries that 
are creditors and who lend to developed countries. For example, 
Europe and the United States are major debtors. One would think 
that developed countries such as Europe and the United States 
would be the ones lending to developing countries, not vice versa.

Fixing the Exchange Rate
Sometimes countries do not want their exchange rate to change. They may want to 
avoid sharp rises in the cost of living for their citizens when their currency depreciates, 
or they may want to keep net exports from falling when their currency appreciates. To 
prevent the value of the currency from changing, governments can enter the foreign 
exchange market to try to influence the price of foreign exchange. Economists call these 
efforts to influence the exchange rate foreign exchange market intervention.
In the United States, the Treasury Department has the official responsibility for 
foreign exchange intervention, though it operates in conjunction with the Federal 
Reserve. In other countries, governments also intervene in the foreign exchange mar-
ket. To influence the price at which one currency trades for another, governments have 
to affect the demand or supply for their currency. To increase the value of its currency, 
a government must increase the currency’s demand. To decrease the value of its cur-
rency, the government must increase its supply.
In Figure 19.5, we show how governments can fix, or peg, the price of a currency. 
Suppose the U.S. and European governments want the exchange rate to be 0.8 euro 
per dollar. The price at which demand and supply are currently equal, however, is only 
0.6 euro per dollar. To increase the price of the U.S. dollar, the governments will need 
to increase the dollar’s demand. To do this, either government—the United States or 
European central banks—or both, can sell euros for dollars in the foreign exchange 
market. This will shift the demand curve for dollars to the right until the price of dol-
lars rises to 0.8 euro per dollar.

Conversely, if the governments want to lower the price of the dollar relative to 
euros, they will buy euros in exchange for dollars. By selling dollars for euros, they 
increase the supply of dollars. The price of the dollar therefore falls while the price 
of the euro increases. Note that to affect the price of the euro against the dollar, the 
U.S. government must exchange euros for dollars. The government will acquire and 
accumulate euros any time it tries to raise their price. To raise the price of the dollar, 
which lowers the value of the euro, the U.S. government must sell some of the euros 
it has accumulated. But what would happen if the United States had no euros to sell? 
The United States could borrow euros from European governments or persuade them 
to sell euros for dollars.

Fixed versus Flexible Exchange Rates
Next, we discuss two different types of exchange rate systems. Then we take a brief 
look at historical U.S exchange rate policy and developments in exchange rates in the 
world today.
Flexible Exchange Rate System  If exchange rates are determined in free 
markets, we have a flexible exchange rate system. Under a pure flexible exchange 
rate system, the price of a currency will rise if the demand increases more than supply 
and will fall if supply increases more than demand. As we have seen, a variety of factors 
can determine exchange rates, including foreign and domestic interest rates as well as 
foreign and domestic prices. Other factors, including market psychology, can also affect 
the value of a nation’s currency. Whatever its source, an increase in the demand for 
currency will raise its price. We have also seen that governments may intervene to 
prevent currency from changing its value. In the most extreme case, there would be no 
change in the value of a currency.
Fixed Exchange Rates  Whether you are in California, New York, or Indiana, all 
prices are quoted in dollars. No one asks whether your dollar came from San Francisco 
or Miami. Within the United States, a dollar is a dollar. Suppose, though, that every 
state had its own currency. There might be a California dollar (with a picture of the 
Golden Gate Bridge), an Oregon dollar (showing pictures of tall trees), and a Florida 
dollar (showing Disney World, of course). In principle, these dollars might trade at 
different rates, depending on the demand and supply of one state’s dollar relative to 
the supply and demand for another state’s dollar. For example, the Texas dollar might 
be worth more than the Michigan dollar, trading for 1.2 Michigan dollars.
Think how much more complicated it would be to do business. To buy goods from 
a mail-order company in Maine, you would have to find out the exchange rate between 
your state’s dollar and the Maine dollar. Any large business operating in all 50 states 
would be overwhelmed trying to keep track of all the exchange rate movements across 
the states. The economy would become less efficient because individuals and businesses 
would have to focus a lot of their attention on exchange rates.
These same ideas apply across nations. Wouldn’t it be nice if all countries either 
used the same currency or fixed their exchange rates against one another so that no one 
would have to worry about exchange rate movements? Currency systems in which 
governments try to keep constant the values of their currencies against one another are 
called fixed exchange rate systems. After World War II, the countries of the world 
operated under a fixed exchange system known as Bretton Woods. The Bretton Woods 
system was named after the town in New Hampshire where representatives of each 
nation met in 1944 and agreed to adopt this system. The system centered on the United 
States: All countries fixed or pegged their currencies against the U.S. dollar.
In a typical fixed exchange rate system, every country that pegs its rate to a central 
country’s exchange rate must intervene in the foreign exchange market when neces-
sary to keep its exchange rate constant. For example, a government would have to 
intervene if, at the fixed exchange rate, the private demand and supply for its currency 
were unequal.
Balance of Payments Deficits and Surpluses  Suppose the supply of a 
country’s currency exceeds the demand at the fixed exchange rate. An excess supply of 
a country’s currency at the fixed exchange rate is known as a balance of payments defi-
cit. A balance of payments deficit will occur whenever there is a deficit on the current 
account that is not matched by net sales of assets to foreigners by the private sector. 
For example, a current account deficit of $100 billion with net sales of assets to foreign-
ers of only $80 billion would mean that there is an excess supply of $20 billion. With 
an excess supply of a country’s currency in the currency market, that currency would 
fall in value without any intervention. To prevent the currency from depreciating in 
value and to maintain the fixed exchange rate, the government would have to sell for-
eign currency and buy its own currency. As you saw from our foreign exchange

­intervention discussion, if a country sells foreign exchange, its holdings of foreign 
exchange will fall. So you can see that when a country runs a balance of payments defi-
cit, it has decreased its holdings of foreign exchange.
It’s also very possible that the demand for a country’s currency will exceed its sup-
ply at the fixed exchange rate. An excess demand for a country’s currency at the fixed 
exchange rate is known as a balance of payments surplus. A balance of payments 
surplus arises when there is a current account surplus that is not matched by net pur-
chases of foreign assets by the private sector. With an excess demand for a country’s 
currency, it will rise in value without any intervention. To prevent its currency from 
appreciating—to maintain the fixed exchange rate, in other words—the government 
will have to buy foreign currency and sell its own. Because it is buying foreign exchange, 
its holdings of foreign exchange will increase. From this discussion, you should be able 
to see that when a country runs a balance of payments surplus, it has increased its hold-
ing of foreign exchange.
Under a fixed exchange rate system, countries that run persistent balance of pay-
ments deficits or balance of payments surpluses must take corrective actions. If domes-
tic policy actions, such as changing taxes, government spending, or the money supply, 
do not cure the problem, a country will eventually have to change the level at which 
the exchange rate is fixed. A country that faces a balance of payments deficit can lower 
the value at which the currency is pegged to increase its net exports, a process called 
devaluation. Conversely, a country that faces a balance of payments surplus can 
increase the value at which its currency is pegged and reduce its net exports, a process 
called revaluation. 
The U.S. Experience with Fixed and Flexible Exchange Rates
As we discussed earlier, after World War II the countries of the world adopted the 
Bretton Woods fixed exchange rate system. In the 1970s, the Bretton Woods system 
was replaced by the current system—a flexible exchange rate system—in which supply 
and demand primarily determine exchange rates.
If a fixed exchange rate system makes it easier to trade, why did it break down in the 
early 1970s? Fixed exchange rate systems provide benefits, but they require countries to 
maintain similar economic policies—especially to maintain similar inflation rates and 
interest rates. To understand this, suppose the exchange rate between the United States 
and Germany were fixed, but the United States has an annual inflation rate of 6 ­percent 
compared to 0 percent in Germany. Because prices in the United States would be 
rising by 6 percent per year, the U.S. real exchange rate against Germany would also 
be increasing at 6 percent per year. This difference in their real exchange rates over 
time would cause a trade deficit to emerge in the United States as U.S. goods became 
more expensive on world markets—including in Germany. As long as the differences 
in inflation continued and the exchange rate remained fixed, the U.S. real exchange 
rate would continue to appreciate, and the U.S. trade deficit would grow even worse. 
Clearly, this course of events would have to be halted under an agreed-upon fixed 
exchange rate system.
In the late 1960s, inflation in the United States began to exceed inflation in other 
countries, and a U.S. balance of payments deficit emerged—just as in our example. 
In 1971, President Richard Nixon surprised the world and devalued the U.S. dollar 
against the currencies of all the other countries. This was a sharp departure from the 
rules underlying Bretton Woods. Nixon hoped that a one-time devaluation of the dol-
lar would alleviate the U.S. balance of payments deficit and maintain the underlying 
system of fixed exchange rates.
However, the U.S. devaluation did not stop the U.S. balance of payments deficit. 
Germany tried to maintain the mark’s fixed exchange rate with the U.S. dollar by 
purchasing U.S. dollars in the foreign exchange market. What Germany was doing 
was importing inflation from the United States. With the U.S. balance of payments 
deficit continuing, Germany was required to buy U.S. dollars to keep the mark from

appreciating. Germany bought U.S. dollars with German marks. Those German marks 
were then put into circulation. The German supply of marks in Germany therefore 
increased, and this increase in marks raised the inflation rate in Germany.
Private-sector investors knew that Germany did not wish to run persistent trade 
surpluses and import U.S. inflation. They bet that Germany would revalue the mark 
against the dollar—that is, raise the value of the mark against the dollar. They bought 
massive amounts of German assets, trading their dollars for marks to purchase them 
because they thought the mark’s value would eventually sharply increase. Their 
actions forced the German government to buy even more dollars to force the price 
of the mark upward and keep it pegged to the dollar. The resulting flow of finan-
cial capital into Germany was so massive that the German government eventually 
gave up all attempts to keep its exchange rate fixed to the dollar. Instead, it let the 
exchange rate be determined in the free market. This was the end of the Bretton 
Woods system. 
Exchange Rate Systems Today
The flexible exchange rate system has worked well enough since the breakdown of 
Bretton Woods. World trade has grown at a rapid rate. Moreover, the flexible exchange 
rate system has seamlessly managed many diverse situations, including two major oil 
shocks in the 1970s, large U.S. budget deficits in the 1980s, and large Japanese and 
Chinese current account surpluses in the last three decades.
During the Bretton Woods period, many countries placed restrictions on the 
flows of financial capital by, for example, not allowing their residents to purchase 
foreign assets or by limiting foreigners’ purchases of domestic assets. By the 1970s, 
these restrictions began to be eliminated, and private-sector transactions in assets grew 
rapidly. With massive amounts of funds being traded in financial markets, it becomes 
very difficult to fix, or peg, an exchange rate.
Nonetheless, countries whose economies are closely tied together might want the 
advantages of fixed exchange rates. One way to avoid some of the difficulties of fixing 
exchange rates between countries is to abolish individual currencies and establish a single 
currency. This is precisely what a group of European countries decided to do. They 
adopted a single currency, the euro, throughout Europe and a single central bank to 
control the supply of the currency. With a single currency, European countries hoped to 
capture the benefits of serving a large market like the United States does with its single 
currency. Unfortunately, this has turned out to be much more complicated to administer 
than the founders of the euro envisioned. The United Kingdom, Denmark, and Sweden 
decided to remain outside the European single currency system. Their currencies, like 
the U.S. dollar and the Japanese yen, now float against each of the other currencies and 
the euro. Many other countries have tied their exchange rate to either the dollar or the 
yen. Some economists believe that the world will eventually settle into three large cur-
rency blocs: the euro, the dollar, and the yen. 
Managing Financial Crises
Hardly a year goes by without some international financial crisis. In 1994 Mexico 
experienced a severe financial crisis. In 1997 the Asian economic crisis began. The 
Argentinean economy collapsed in 2002. How do these crises originate? What policies 
can be followed to prevent or alleviate them?
Let’s first consider the Mexican case. During the late 1980s and early 1990s, 
­Mexico decided to fix, or peg, its exchange to the U.S. dollar. Mexico’s goal was to 
signal to investors throughout the world that it was serious about controlling inflation 
and would take the steps needed to keep its inflation rates in line with that of the United 
States. Mexico also opened up its markets to let in foreign investors. The country 
seemed to be on a solid path to development.

However, in some sense, the policies proved to be too successful in encourag-
ing foreign investment. As funds poured into the country, the demand for goods 
increased, and prices started to rise. This rise in prices caused an increase in Mexico’s 
real exchange rate, and the rise in the real exchange rate caused a large trade deficit 
to emerge.
Initially, the trade deficit did not cause any difficulties for the Mexican govern-
ment. Because foreign investors were willingly trading foreign currencies for Mexican 
pesos to buy Mexican securities, the government in Mexico did not have any problem 
maintaining its pegged exchange rate with the United States. Although the Mexicans 
were importing more than they were exporting, at this point they could still obtain 
the dollars they needed to finance the trade imbalance from foreign investors who 
were purchasing Mexican securities. The government did not have to intervene in the 
foreign exchange market to keep the price of the peso constant against the dollar. In 
other words, Mexico did not have a balance of payments deficit.
But then internal political difficulties ensued. Following an assassination of a 
political candidate and a rural uprising, foreign investors started to pull their funds 
out of Mexico. At this point, the Mexican government made a crucial mistake. Instead 
of trying to reduce its trade deficit by taking steps to reduce prices, it allowed the 
trade deficit to continue. Moreover, both the government and the private sector 
began to find that they had to borrow in dollars because foreign investors thought 
Mexico might be forced to devalue the peso. If a devaluation were to occur, any lender 
of pesos would suffer a loss because the debt would be repaid at a lower exchange 
rate. Consequently, Mexican borrowers were forced to borrow in loans denominated 
in dollars.

A Troubled Euro
Applying the Concepts #3: What are the fundamental causes for the problems with the euro?
worldwide recession of 2007 increased budgetary pressures, it 
became clear that the banks and governments of these coun-
tries could not easily pay their debts. Moreover, with a single 
currency for the euro area, countries could not make adjust-
ments through depreciation of their currency. On top of this, 
labor was much less mobile between countries in Europe as 
compared to states within the United States, so adjustments 
had to be made through wage and price movements. The 
options facing Europe were bleak: either large-scale financial 
transfers from Germany and other successful countries, or 
sharp cutbacks in budgets and prolonged unemployment to 
reduce wage levels. Most countries muddled through with bud-
get cuts or borrowing. However, Greece faced particular chal-
lenges and elected a left-of-center government in response to 
the economic pain it suffered. This added more political drama 
and raised the possibility that Greece could exit the Eurozone.
What became apparent was that the United States did 
not just have a single currency; it also had a unified fiscal 
system that provided transfers to states and regions in eco-
nomic distress. Monetary union without a corresponding fiscal 
system cannot be easily sustained.  Related to Exercises 4.4 
and 4.8.
When the euro was launched in 1999, the vision of its founders 
was to use the monetary union to further unify Europe economi-
cally and politically. They envisioned a large economic market, 
comparable to the United States with integrated goods and 
financial markets. They believed that by moving to a single cur-
rency with agreements on a number of fiscal rules that they 
could achieve economic stability and growth.
Unfortunately, this vision proved to be naive. Under the 
umbrella of the euro, financial investors throughout the world 
poured funds into Spain and Ireland, fueling an unsustain-
able housing boom, and also lent excessive amounts to the 
governments of Greece, Italy, and Portugal that faced severe 
budget challenges. When the housing boom collapsed and the

Eventually, more political turmoil caused investors to pull out their funds, selling 
pesos for dollars. The Mexican central bank spent nearly $50 billion buying these pesos 
in an effort to keep the exchange rate constant. The $50 billion was not enough. Mexico 
ran out of dollars. Because it could no longer buy pesos to maintain the exchange rate, 
Mexico had to devalue, putting the peso more in line with its market value. The devalu-
ation created even more turmoil because the government and the private sector had 
borrowed billions in dollars. When the peso was devalued against the dollar, the burden 
of these debts measured in pesos increased sharply, so more pesos were needed to pay 
the dollar-denominated debts. Mexico faced the prospect of massive bankruptcies and 
the potential collapse of its economy.
To prevent a financial collapse that could easily have spread to many other devel-
oping countries, the U.S. government (along with other international financial institu-
tions) arranged for Mexico to borrow dollars with an extended period for repayment. 
This allowed Mexican banks and corporations to avoid bankruptcies and prevented 
a major disaster. In 1996, the Mexican government was able to pay off nearly three-
fourths of the loan from the United States.
The Asian crisis had a similar flavor. Economic growth had been remarkable in 
Asia for over 20 years, improving to a great extent the standard of living of millions 
of people. In the early 1990s, several Asian countries began to open up their capital 
markets to foreign investors and borrow extensively from abroad. Billions of dollars 
poured into Asia. In many cases, there was little financial supervision, and many of 
the investments proved to be unwise. Companies in both Thailand and South Korea 
began to lose money. Domestic investors and world investors suddenly became pes-
simistic and pulled their funds out of South Korea and Thailand, among other Asian 
countries. The withdrawal of funds forced currencies throughout Asia to be deval-
ued. Because many businesses had borrowed in dollars, the devaluations raised the 
burden of the debt and further deepened the crisis, taking its toll on other countries, 
including Indonesia, Malaysia, and Hong Kong. The International Monetary Fund 
attempted to help restore the health of these economies’ financial systems, but in 
many cases, its policies were ineffective. Some economists, such as Nobel Laureate 
Joseph Stiglitz, believe the entire Asian crisis was an example of market overreaction 
and could have been avoided by bolder action from world organizations and devel-
oped countries.
Even when a country takes strong, institutional steps to peg its currency, a collapse 
is still possible. This was the case with Argentina.
These examples highlight some of the many factors that can bring about financial 
crises. In vast global capital markets, funds can move quickly from country to country, 
and economic policies sometimes do not keep pace with changing political and eco-
nomic developments. It can be extremely difficult to maintain a fixed exchange rate in 
this environment. The flow of funds, moreover, is often so large that financial failures 
can rock trade and commerce.
The countries of the world are searching for a reliable set of rules and institutional 
mechanisms that can avoid and limit the spread of financial crises. Historically, the 
International Monetary Fund has played a key role in assisting countries that run into 
financial difficulties. However, in Mexico, the sums were so large that the United 
States was forced to take the lead in resolving the situation. In Asia, the International 
Monetary Fund did not have backing from the United States, so the efforts to allevi-
ate the crisis were less successful. In Argentina, rigid adherence to a fixed exchange 
rate and a government that could not control spending both contributed to a collapse. 
As world capital markets continue to grow, governments throughout the world will 
almost surely be tested by new and often unpredictable financial crises, such as they 
experienced in 2008. They will need to anticipate and react to rapid changes in the 
economic and political environment to maintain a stable financial environment for 
world trade.

The Argentine Financial Crisis
Applying the Concepts #4: What are the causes of financial collapses that occur throughout the globe?
its currency was pegged to the dollar. Essentially, the United 
States’ rising currency became Argentina’s problem. Wage 
increases also pushed up the real exchange rate, exacerbat-
ing the trade deficit. The Argentinean government—including 
its provincial governments—found it difficult to control spending 
and had to borrow extensively from abroad in dollar-denomi-
nated loans. Then in 1999, Brazil devalued its currency, putting 
additional pressure on neighboring Argentina. As investors saw 
the persistent trade and government deficits that were occur-
ring in Argentina, they became doubtful that the country could 
repay its debts and feared its currency would be devaluated. 
Local citizens also became fearful of a devaluation and tried to 
convert their pesos into dollars, further deepening the problem.
Eventually, Argentina was forced to default on its inter-
national debt in 2002 and freeze bank accounts. Middle-class 
Argentineans who still had funds in their banks suffered a sharp 
decrease in their wealth. A severe economic downturn ensued. 
The hopes of the reforms in the early 1990s had become a bitter 
memory. However, the Argentinean economy proved resilient 
and began a recovery over the next several years.   Related to 
Exercise 5.5.
During the late 1980s, Argentina suffered from hyperinflation. As 
part of its financial reforms, it pegged its currency to the U.S. 
dollar, making pesos “convertible” into dollars. To issue pesos, 
the central bank had to have an equal amount of dollars, or its 
equivalent in other hard currencies, on hand. Some economists 
believed this reform would bring stability to the financial system. 
Unfortunately, they were proved wrong.
The financial and other institutional reforms worked well 
in the early 1990s, but then several problems developed. As 
the dollar appreciated sharply on world markets after 1995, 
Argentina began to suffer from a large trade deficit because 
In this chapter, we 
examined the world of 
international finance. 
You saw how exchange 
rates are determined 
in markets and how 
governments can influ-
ence these markets. 
You also learned how 
the real exchange rate affects the trade deficit. Behind the com-
plex world of international financial transactions are these few 
simple ideas:
1.	 Exchange rates are generally determined in foreign exchange 
markets by supply and demand.
2.	 The real exchange rate is the price of U.S. goods and services 
relative to foreign goods and services, expressed in a common 
currency. The equation for the real exchange rate is
real exchange rate = exchange rate * u.S. price index
foreign price index
3.	 The balance of payments consists of three types of international 
transactions:
•	
The current account is equal to net exports plus net 
income from existing investments abroad and net trans-
fers from abroad.
•	
The financial account is the value of a country’s sales 
less purchases of assets.
•	
The capital account is the net value of a country’s capi-
tal transfers and the purchase and sale of nonproduced, 
nonfinancial assets.
The sum of the current account, plus the financial account, plus the 
capital account is zero.
4.	 Governments can attempt to change the value of currencies 
by buying or selling currencies in the foreign exchange market. 
Purchasing a currency will raise its value; selling a currency will 
decrease its value.
5.	 A system of fixed exchange rates can provide a better environ-
ment for business but requires that countries keep their inflation 
rates and interest rates within narrow limits.

How Exchange Rates Are Determined
Discuss how the price of foreign exchange is determined by 
demand and supply.
1.1	 The dollar 
 against the euro when the Euro-
pean central bank lowers interest rates.
1.2	 If the dollar appreciates against the euro, then the euro 
also 
 against the dollar.
1.3	 The price of one country’s currency in terms of another 
country’s currency is called the 
1.4	 All else constant, an excess supply of pounds will cause 
the dollar to 
 (appreciate/depreciate) against 
the pound.
1.5	 Using Demand and Supply Analysis. Draw a demand 
and supply graph for British pounds to determine the 
effects of the following on the exchange rate between 
the British pound and the Japanese yen. (The vertical 
axis will be yen per pound.)
a.	 An increase in Japanese interest rates
b.	An increase in the price of British goods
c.	 An increase in British interest rates
1.6	 The Effects of Policy Changes in Japan. Until the 
early 1980s, Japan required its large insurance com-
panies to invest all of their vast holdings in Japanese 
securities. At the prompting of the United States, Japan 
relaxed the restrictions and allowed the companies to 
invest anywhere in the world. What effect do you think 
this had on the yen/dollar exchange rate and the trade 
balance between the two countries?
1.7	 Exchange Rates and Rumors of Default on Govern-
ment Debt. Suppose there are rumors that a country 
undergoing financial difficulties is planning to default 
on its debt. Explain what you think will happen to that 
country’s exchange rate.
Real Exchange Rates and Purchasing Power Parity
Distinguish between the nominal exchange rate and the real 
exchange rate.
2.1	 The best measure of the purchasing power of one cur-
rency relative to another is the 
.
2.2	 When the U.S. and foreign price levels remain the 
same but the dollar appreciates, the real exchange rate 
will 
.
2.3	 The law of one price provides accurate predictions of 
current exchange rates. 
 (True/False)
2.4	 Suppose that a laptop computer costs 840 British 
pounds in the United Kingdom and $1,400 in the 
United States. If the nominal exchange rate is 0.6 
pounds per U.S. dollar, then the real exchange rate is 
 British laptop(s) per U.S. laptop computer.
2.5	 The Real Exchange Rate between Germany and 
the United States. Consider the following data for 
the United States and Germany during the period that 
Germany had its own currency, the mark:
Year
German GDP 
Price Deflator
U.S. GDP

mark over this period?
b.	Using the formula for the real exchange rate,
real exchange rate =

foreign price index
	
	
compute the real exchange rate for 1980 and for 
1990.
All problems are assignable in MyLab Economics.

431
c.	 By how much did the real exchange rate change over 
this period?
d.	Compare your answer for part (c) to your answer 
to part (a).
2.6	 Tall Lattés and the Real Exchange Rate between 
the Euro and the Dollar. According to The Economist, 
in early 2004 the average price of a tall latté in Star-
bucks in the United States was $2.80. In the countries 
that use the euro, the average price was 2.93 euros. 
Because the exchange rate at this time was 0.79 euro 
per dollar, the dollar price of lattés in the euro area was 
$3.70. (Related to Application 1 on page 418.)
a.	 At what exchange rate between the dollar and the 
euro would a latté cost the same in the euro area as 
it did in the United States?
b.	Does this calculation suggest that the euro is “too 
high” or “too low” relative to the dollar?
2.7	 Mexican Peso and the U.S Dollar. Based on the data 
in the table in Application 1, is the Mexican peso under- 
or overvalued with respect to the dollar? Explain your 
answer. (Related to Application 1 on page 418.)
2.8	 Nontraded Goods and Purchasing Power Parity. 
Economists have long noted that nontraded goods 
are cheaper in countries with lower GDP. For exam-
ple, in the United States, only the very, very rich 
have live-in help, but that is quite common in India 
for upper ­middle-class families. Under these circum-
stances, would you expect purchasing power parity to 
be an accurate theory of exchange rates in the long 
run? Assuming that Big Macs use nontraded goods 
in their production, should Big Macs be more expen-
sive or less expensive in countries with the highest 
GDPs?
The Current Account, the Financial Account, and the 
Capital Account
Explain how the current account, financial account, and 
capital account are all related to one another.
3.1	 Net transfers from abroad are a(n) 
 entry on 
the current account.
3.2	 The current, financial, and capital accounts must sum 
to 
.
3.3	 The balance of payments is divided into three major 
accounts, the 
 account, the 
 
 account, and the 
 account.
3.4	 The United States has a large 
 on the current 
account but a large 
 on the financial account.
3.5	 Calculating the Capital and Current Account. 
During the year, a country (including its government), 
acquires an additional $100 billion of foreign assets. At 
the same time, foreign residents acquire $200 billion of 
this country’s assets. Ignoring minor items, what is the 
balance on the capital account for this country? What 
about its current account?
3.6	 The Largest Sovereign Investment Funds. Which 
countries do you think have the largest sovereign 
investment funds? Check your intuition by looking 
at data at http://www.swfinstitute.org/fund-rankings/ 
(accessed March 2015). What do the three countries 
with the largest funds all have in common?
3.7	 Creditor or Debtor? According to economist 
Gabriel Zucman, why is Europe actually a net credi-
tor when the commonly used international financial 
data seem to show it is a net debtor? What does the 
commonly used data leave out? (Related to Applica-
tion 2 on page 422.)
Fixed and Flexible Exchange Rates
List the benefits and costs of a system of fixed exchange rates 
compared to a system of flexible exchange rates.
4.1	 The government 
 foreign currency for dol-
lars if it wants to peg the exchange rate at a higher rate 
than would normally prevail in the market.
4.2	 If there is an excess supply of a country’s currency at 
the fixed exchange rate, there is a balance of payments 
.
4.3	 The Bretton Woods agreement broke down in the 
early 1970s because Germany had too high an inflation 
rate relative to the United States. 
 (True/
False)
4.4	 When European countries joined together to create 
the euro, they created a strong, central fiscal authority 
to unify the finances of its members. 
 (True/
False) (Related to Application 3 on page 427.)
4.5	 Expectations of Depreciation and Investing. Indi-
viduals wishing to invest in Turkey in 2006 had two 
choices. They could invest in bonds that would pay 
returns in 2007 in Turkish lira and earn 14.7 percent, 
or they could invest in Turkish bonds that would pay 
returns in U.S. dollars but earn only 5.2 percent. From 
this data, what do you think the market believes is the 
expected rate of depreciation of the Turkish lira against 
the U.S. dollar? Explain.
4.6	 Dollarization. Some countries have simply decided to 
let the U.S. dollar or another foreign currency serve as 
their local currency. This is called “dollarization.” Why 
would a country decide to abandon its own currency 
and use a foreign currency?
4.7	 Uncovering U.S. Exchange Rate Policy. Suppose 
the United States reported that the U.S. Treasury had 
increased its holdings of foreign currencies from last 
year. What does this tell you about the foreign exchange 
policies of the United States during the last year?

432
4.8	 Labor Mobility and the Euro. Unlike the United 
States, which has high levels of interstate mobility, 
labor is less mobile from one part of Europe to the 
other because workers would have to move from one 
country to another. What challenges does the lower 
level of labor mobility in Europe pose for the viabil-
ity of the euro system? (Related to Application 3 on 
page 427.)
Managing Financial Crises
Discuss how international financial crisis can emerge.
5.1	 When prices rose in Mexico faster than in the United 
States and the nominal exchange rate remained con-
stant, the real exchange rate 
.
5.2	 If a country borrows in dollars, a depreciation of its 
own currency against the dollar will 
 the 
burden of its debt.
5.3	 Joseph Stiglitz is the economist who believed that the 
Asian financial crisis was an example of market over-
reaction that could have been avoided by bolder actions 
from world organizations. 
 (True/False)
5.4	 In the 1990s, Argentina pegged its currency to the dol-
lar. As the dollar appreciated in world markets, this 
caused an increase in Argentina’s trade 
.
5.5	 Reinhardt and Rogoff on Financial Crises. Econo-
mists Kenneth Rogoff and Carmen Reinhardt have 
written a number of papers about the lessons we can 
learn from financial crisis. Read the paper they wrote 
for the International Monetary Fund, “Financial and 
Sovereign Debt Crises: Some Lessons Learned and 
Those Forgotten,” available at: https://www.imf.org/
external/pubs/ft/wp/2013/wp13266.pdf (accessed March 
2015). Do they believe that lessons from developing 
countries also apply to developed countries? (Related 
to Application 4 on page 429.)
5.6	 The Dollar and the Financial Crisis. It is generally 
recognized that the worldwide financial crisis in 2008 
originated in the United States, as its financial institu-
tions were most active in fueling the housing boom. 
However, investors throughout the world had bought 
U.S. mortgage-related securities and this spread the 
global crisis. When the crisis hit, the value of the U.S. 
dollar rose sharply against many other currencies. 
What might have caused this appreciation?

Determining Exchange Rates
In this experiment, you will see how exchange rates are deter-
mined. The class is divided into two groups. One group will 
be buying a fixed number of Swiss francs. The other group will 
be selling a fixed number of Swiss francs. Each buyer will have 
a maximum price that he or she is willing to pay. Each seller 
will have a minimum price that he or she is willing to accept. 
Trade will take place in several rounds. In each round, buyers 
and sellers will meet individually and either negotiate a trade 
Eco nom ic Experiment
or not. If a trade results, the results will be reported to the 
instructor and then announced to the class. After each round, 
the instructor announces the prices at which Swiss francs were 
traded. After several rounds, what happens to the prices?

Elasticity: A Measure 
of Responsiveness
20
C h a p t e r
The city of Phoenix, Arizona, gets 
its gasoline from two pipelines, 
one running from Texas and the 
other from the West Coast.
In the summer of 2003, the Texas pipeline broke, 
cutting off 30 percent of the city’s gasoline supply.
A reliable study of gasoline suggests that a 
5 percent increase in price decreases the quan-
tity demanded by 1 percent. Based on this 
study, it appears that to counteract the 30 per-
cent decrease, the price would have to rise by 
150  ­percent (5  times 30). But in fact the price 
increased by only 40 ­percent. What explains the 
relatively small increase in price?

I
n Chapter 4 we discussed the law of demand, which states that an increase in price 
decreases the quantity demanded, ceteris paribus. The law of demand is useful, but 
sometimes we need to know the numbers behind the law of demand. That is, we 
need to know exactly how much less will be demanded at a higher price. In this chapter, 
we quantify the law of demand, exploring the responsiveness of consumers to changes in 
price. Suppose your student film society has decided to increase the price for its tickets 
from $10 to $11. You know from the law of demand that you’ll sell fewer tickets, but the 
question is, “How many fewer tickets?” As we’ll see, you can use the concept of elastic-
ity to predict how many tickets you’ll sell and how much money you’ll collect in total.
Switching to the supply side of the market, the law of supply tells us that an increase 
in price increases the quantity supplied, ceteris paribus. Sometimes the question is, “By how 
much?” We’ll quantify the law of supply, showing how to predict just how much more of 
a product will be supplied at a higher price. For example, if the world price of oil increases 
from $70 to $80 per barrel, we know from the law of supply that domestic producers 
will supply more oil, but the question is, “How much more?” We can use the concept 
of elasticity to predict how much more domestic oil will be supplied at the higher price.
The Price Elasticity of Demand
The price elasticity of demand (Ed) measures the responsiveness of the quantity 
demanded to changes in price. To compute the price elasticity of demand, we divide 
the percentage change in the quantity demanded by the percentage change in price, 
and then take the absolute value of the ratio:
Ed = 2 percentage change in quantity demanded
percentage change in price
2
The vertical bars indicate that we take the absolute value of the ratio, so the price 
elasticity is always a positive number. For example, suppose the price of milk increases 
by 10 percent and the quantity demanded decreases by 15 percent. The price elasticity 
of demand is 1.5:
Ed = 2 percentage change in quantity demanded
percentage change in price
= -15%
10%
= 1.50 2
The law of demand tells us that price and quantity demanded move in opposite 
­directions. Therefore, the percentage change in quantity will always have the opposite 
sign of the percentage change in price. In our example, a positive 10 percent change in 
price results in a negative 15 percent change in quantity. The ratio of the ­percentage 
changes is -1.50, and taking the absolute value of this ratio, the elasticity is 1.50. 
Although it is conventional to use the absolute value to compute the price elasticity, 
the practice is not universal. So you may encounter a negative price elasticity, which 
means that the elasticity is reported as its numerical value rather than its absolute value.
When the price elasticity is listed as a positive number, the interpretation of the 
elasticity is straightforward. If the elasticity number is large, it means that the demand 
for the product is very elastic, or very responsive to changes in price. In contrast, a small 
number indicates that the demand for a product is very inelastic.
Computing Percentage Changes and Elasticities
As we saw in the appendix to Chapter 1, we can compute a percentage change in two 
ways. Using the initial-value method, we divide the change in the value of a variable 
by its initial value. For example, if a price increases from $20 to $22, the percentage 
change is $2 divided by $20, or 10 percent:
percent change with initial value = 22 - 20
20
* 100 = 2
20 * 100 = 10%
Learning Objective 20.1
List the determinants of the price 
elasticity of demand.
price elasticity of demand (Ed)
A measure of the responsiveness of 
the quantity demanded to changes in 
price; equal to the absolute value of the 
­percentage change in quantity demanded 
divided by the percentage change in price.

Chapter 20 • Elasticity: A Measure of Responsiveness
435
Alternatively, we could use the midpoint method. We divide the change in the variable 
by its average value, that is, the midpoint of the two values. For example, if the price 
increases from $20 to $22, the average or midpoint value is $21 and the percentage 
change is $2 divided by $21, or 9.52 percent:
percent change with midpoint value =
2
20 + 22
2
* 100 = 2
21 * 100 = 9.52%
The advantage of the midpoint approach is that it generates the same absolute 
­percentage change whether the variable has increased or decreased. The reason is 
that the denominator is the same in both cases. In contrast, the initial-value computa-
tion is based on the initial value, so our answer there depends on the direction of the 
change—which of the two values is the initial value.
Table 20.1 shows the calculation of the price elasticity of demand with the two 
approaches. When the price increases from $20 to $22, the quantity demanded 
decreases from 100 to 80 units. Using the initial-value method, we get an elasticity 
of 2.0, equal to the 20 percent change in quantity divided by the 10 percent change 
in price. As shown in the lower part of the table, the midpoint method generates an 
elasticity of 2.33.
Why do the two approaches generate different elasticity numbers? The midpoint 
approach measures the percentage changes more precisely, so we get a more precise 
measure of price elasticity. In this case, the percentage changes are relatively small, so 
the two elasticity numbers are close to one another. If the percentage changes were 
larger, however, the elasticity numbers generated by the two approaches would be quite 
different, and it would be wise to use the midpoint approach. In this text, we use the 
initial-value approach because it generates nice round numbers and allows us to focus 
on economics rather than arithmetic. But any time you want to be more precise, you 
can use the midpoint formula.
Price Elasticity and the Demand Curve
Figure 20.1 shows five different demand curves, each with a different elasticity. We 
can divide products into five types, depending on their price elasticities of demand:
• Elastic demand (Panel A). In this case, a 20 percent increase in price (from $5 to 
$6) decreases the quantity demanded by 40 percent (from 20 to 12), so the price 
elasticity of demand is 2.0. When the price elasticity is greater than 1.0, we say 
elastic demand
The price elasticity of demand is greater 
than one, so the percentage change in 
quantity exceeds the percentage change 
in price.

that demand is elastic, or highly responsive to changes in price. Some examples of 
goods with elastic demand are restaurant meals, air travel, and movies.
• Inelastic demand (Panel B). The same 20 percent increase in price decreases 
the quantity demanded by only 10 percent (from 20 to 18), so the price elasticity 
of demand is 0.50. When the elasticity is less than 1.0, we say that demand is 
inelastic demand
The price elasticity of demand is less than 
one, so the percentage change in quantity 
is less than the percentage change in price.

inelastic, or not very responsive to changes in price. Some examples of goods with 
inelastic demand are salt, eggs, coffee, and cigarettes.
• Unit elastic demand (Panel C). A 20 percent increase in price decreases the 
quantity demanded by exactly 20 percent, so the price elasticity of demand is 1.0. 
Some examples of goods with unit elasticity are housing and fruit juice.
• Perfectly inelastic demand (Panel D). When demand is perfectly inelastic, the 
quantity doesn’t change as the price changes, so the demand curve is vertical at 
the fixed quantity. The price elasticity of demand is zero. This extreme case is 
rare because for most products, consumers can either switch to a substitute good 
or do without. For example, although there are no direct substitutes for house-
hold water, as the price of water rises, people install low-flow showerheads and 
water their lawns and clean their cars less frequently. The rare cases of perfectly 
inelastic demand are medicines—such as insulin for diabetics—that have no 
substitutes.
• Perfectly elastic demand (Panel E). In the case of perfect elasticity, the price 
elasticity is infinite and the demand curve is horizontal, meaning that only one 
price is possible. At that price, the quantity demanded could be any quantity, 
from one unit to millions of units. If the price were to increase even a penny, the 
quantity demanded would drop to zero. As we’ll see later in the book, firms in a 
perfectly competitive market face this sort of demand curve. For example, each 
wheat farmer can sell as much as he or she wants at the market price but would 
sell nothing at any price above the market price.
Elasticity and the Availability of Substitutes
The key factor in determining the price elasticity for a particular product is the avail-
ability of substitute products. Consider the substitution possibilities for insulin and 
cornflakes. There are no good substitutes for insulin, so diabetics are not very respon-
sive to changes in price. When the price of insulin increases, they cannot switch to 
another medicine, so the demand for insulin is inelastic. In contrast, there are many 
substitutes for cornflakes, including different types of corn cereals, as well as cereals 
made from wheat, rice, and oats. Faced with an increase in the price of cornflakes, 
consumers can easily switch to substitute products, so the demand for cornflakes is 
relatively elastic.
Table 20.2 shows the price elasticities of demand for various products. The differ-
ent elasticities illustrate the importance of substitutes in determining the price elasticity 
of demand. Because there are no good substitutes for water and salt, it is not surprising 
that the elasticities are small. For example, the price elasticity of demand for water is 
0.20, meaning that a 10 percent increase in price decreases the quantity demanded by 
2 percent. The demand for coffee is inelastic (0.30) because although there are alterna-
tive beverages and caffeine-delivery systems (tea, infused soft drinks, sports drinks, and 
pills), coffee provides a unique combination of taste and caffeine. Although there is an 
artificial substitute for eggs (for people concerned about dietary cholesterol), there are 
no natural substitutes, so the demand for eggs is relatively inelastic (0.30).
Alternative brands of a product are good substitutes for one another, so the demand 
for a specific brand of a product is typically elastic. For example, the elasticity of demand 
for a specific brand of coffee is 5.6, compared to an overall elasticity for coffee of 0.30. 
This means that a 10 percent increase in the price of coffee in general (all brands) will 
decrease the quantity of coffee sold by 3 percent, but a 10 percent increase in the price 
of a specific brand will decrease the quantity of that brand sold by 56 percent. Each 
brand of coffee is a substitute for all the other brands, so consumers are very responsive 
to a change in the price of a specific brand. Similarly, the demand for specific brands 
of tires is more elastic than the demand for tires in general.
The availability of substitutes increases over time, so the longer the time ­consumers 
have to respond to a price change, the more elastic the demand. Because it often

takes time for consumers to respond to price changes, the short-run price elasticity of 
demand is typically smaller than the long-run elasticity. For example, when the price of 
gasoline increases, consumers can immediately drive fewer miles in their existing cars or 
switch to public transportation. As shown in Table 20.2, the short-run price elasticity 
of demand for gasoline is 0.25. In the long run, consumers can buy more fuel-efficient 
cars and move closer to workplaces. As time passes, consumers have more options to 
cut gasoline consumption—more substitution possibilities—so demand becomes more 
elastic. In Table 20.2, the long-run price elasticity of demand for gasoline is 0.60, over 
twice as large as the short-run elasticity.
Other Determinants of the Price Elasticity of Demand
Two other factors help determine the price elasticity of demand for a product. First, 
the elasticity is generally larger for goods that take a relatively large part of a con-
sumer’s budget. If a good represents a small part of the budget of the typical consumer, 
demand is relatively inelastic. For example, suppose the price of pencils is 20 cents and 
then increases by 10 percent, or 2 cents. Because the price change is tiny compared 
to the income of the typical consumer, we would expect a relatively small decrease in 
the quantity of pencils demanded. In contrast, if the price of a car is $20,000 and then 
increases 10 percent ($2,000), we would expect a bigger response because the change 
in price is large relative to the income of the typical consumer.
International comparisons of the price elasticity of demand for food suggest that 
demand is more price elastic when the good represents a large part of the consumer’s 
budget. As shown in Table 20.2, in wealthy countries the price elasticity of demand for 
food is around 0.15. In poor countries, people spend a larger fraction of their budget 
on food, so they are more responsive to changes in food prices. In these poor countries, 
the price elasticity of demand is around 0.34.

Table 20.2  Price Elasticities of Demand for Selected Products1

Chapter 20 • Elasticity: A Measure of Responsiveness
439
Another factor in determining the elasticity of demand is whether the product is a 
necessity or a luxury good. As shown in Table 20.2, the demand for food, a necessity, is 
relatively low in both wealthy and poor countries. Similarly, the demand for ­physician 
visits is inelastic (elasticity = 0.25). In contrast, the elasticity of demand for luxury 
goods such as restaurant meals, foreign travel, and motorboats is relatively elastic. Of 
course, not all goods that are considered luxuries have elastic demand. For example, the 
price elasticity of demand for weekend canoe trips is 0.19, and the demand elasticity 
for sport fishing is 0.28. These elasticities suggest that one person’s luxury is another 
person’s necessity.
Table 20.3 summarizes our discussion of the determinants of the price ­elasticity 
of demand. Demand is relatively elastic if there are many good substitutes, if we 
allow consumers a long time to respond, if spending on the product is a large part 
of the consumer’s budget, and if the product is a luxury as opposed to a necessity.

A Closer Look at the Elasticity of Demand for Gasoline
Applying the Concepts #1: How does the price elasticity of demand vary over time?
to higher gasoline prices. First, when the price increases, people 
drive fewer miles, so there are fewer cars on the road. As shown 
in Table 20.4, the elasticity of traffic volume is 0.10 in the short 
run (within 1 year) and 0.30 in the long run (after 5 years). In other 
words, a 10 percent increase in the price of gasoline decreases 
the number of cars on the road by 1 percent in the short run and 
3 percent in the long run. A second response to higher prices is 
to switch to more fuel-efficient cars. As shown in the table, the 
elasticity of fuel efficiency is 0.15 in the short run and 0.40 in the 
long run.  Related to Exercises 1.6 and 1.7.
We’ve seen that the demand for gasoline is more elastic in the 
long run, when consumers have more opportunity to respond to 
changes in price. A recent study explores two sorts of responses

Using Price Elasticity
The price elasticity of demand is a very useful tool for economic analysis. If we know 
the price elasticity of demand for a particular good, we can quantify the law of demand, 
predicting the change in quantity resulting from a change in price. In addition, we can 
use an estimate of the price elasticity of demand to predict how a change in price affects 
a firm’s total revenue.
Predicting Changes in Quantity
If we have values for two of the three variables in the elasticity formula, we can compute 
the value of the third. The three variables are (1) the price elasticity of demand itself, (2) the 
percentage change in quantity, and (3) the percentage change in price. So if we know the 
values for the price elasticity and the percentage change in price, we can compute the value 
for the percentage change in quantity. Specifically, we can rearrange the elasticity formula:
percentage change in quantity demanded = percentage change in price * Ed
For example, suppose you run a campus film series and you’ve decided to increase 
your admission price by 15 percent. If you know the elasticity of demand for your mov-
ies, you could use it to predict how many fewer tickets you’ll sell at the higher price. 
If the elasticity of demand is 2.0 and you increase the price by 15 percent, we would 
predict a 30 percent decrease in the quantity of tickets demanded:
 percentage change in quantity demanded = percentage change in price * Ed 
 = 15% * 2.0 = 30%
We can use the concept of price elasticity to predict the effects of a change in the 
price of beer on drinking and highway deaths among young adults. The price ­elasticity 
of demand for beer among young adults is about 1.30.2 If a state imposes a beer tax that 
increases the price of beer by 10 percent, we would predict that beer consumption will 
decrease by 13 percent:
 percentage change in quantity demanded = percentage change in price * Ed 
 = 10% * 1.30 = 13%
The number of highway deaths among young adults is roughly proportional to 
their beer consumption, so the number of deaths will also decrease by 13 percent. 
According to a recent study, a doubling of the beer tax from $0.16 to $0.32 per six-pack 
would decrease highway deaths among 18- to 20-year-olds by about 12 percent. ­Raising 
the beer tax back to where it was in 1951 would cut highway deaths by 32 percent.
Another ongoing policy objective is to reduce smoking by teenagers. Under the 
1997 federal tobacco settlement, cigarette prices increased by about 62 cents per pack, 
a percentage increase of about 25 percent. The demand for cigarettes by teenagers is 
elastic, with an elasticity of 1.3.3 Therefore, a 25 percent price hike will reduce teen 
smoking by 32.5 percent:
percentage change in quantity demanded = 25% * 1.30 = 32.5%
About half the decrease in consumption occurs because fewer teenagers will 
become smokers, and the other half occurs because each teenage smoker will smoke 
fewer cigarettes.
Price Elasticity and Total Revenue
Firms use the concept of price elasticity to predict the effects of changing their prices. 
A firm produces products to sell, and a firm’s total revenue equals the money it 
­generates from selling products. If a firm sells its product for the same price to every 
consumer, total revenue equals the price per unit times the quantity sold:
total revenue = price per unit * quantity sold
Learning Objective 20.2
Use price elasticity of demand to 
predict changes in quantity and total 
revenue.
total revenue
The money a firm generates from selling 
its product.

Chapter 20 • Elasticity: A Measure of Responsiveness
441
Suppose a firm increases the price of its product. Will its total sales revenue 
increase or decrease? The answer depends on the price elasticity of demand for the 
product. If you know the price elasticity, you can determine whether a price hike will 
increase or decrease the firm’s total revenue.
Let’s return to the example of the campus film series. Suppose you are thinking 
about increasing the price of tickets by 10 percent, from $10 to $11. An increase in the 
ticket price brings good news and bad news:
• Good news: You get more money for each ticket sold.
• Bad news: You sell fewer tickets.
Your total revenue will decrease if the bad news (fewer tickets sold) dominates 
the good news (more money per ticket). The elasticity of demand tells us how bad the 
bad news is. The more elastic the demand, the larger the reduction in the quantity 
sold—the worse the bad news.
The upper part of Table 20.5 shows an example of the effects of a price hike when 
the demand for a product is elastic. In this case, the price elasticity of demand is 2.0, 
so a 10 percent increase in price decreases the quantity demanded by 20 percent, from 
100 to 80 tickets. Because the percentage decrease in quantity (the bad news) exceeds 
the percentage increase in price (the good news), total revenue decreases, from $1,000 
to $880. In general, an elastic demand means that the percentage change in quantity 
(the bad news from a price hike) will exceed the percentage change in price (the good 
news), so an increase in price will decrease total revenue.
We get the opposite result if the demand for the good is inelastic: An increase in 
price increases total revenue. The lower part of Table 20.5 shows an example of the 
effects of a price hike when demand is inelastic (equal to 0.50). Suppose that your cam-
pus bookstore starts with a textbook price of $100 and sells 10 books per minute. If the 
bookstore increases its price by 20 percent (from $100 to $120 per book), the quantity 
of textbooks sold will decrease by only 10 percent (from 10 to 9 per minute). Therefore, 
the store’s total revenue will increase from $1,000 per minute ($100 * 10 books) to 
$1,080 per minute ($120 * 9 books). In general, an inelastic demand means that the 
percentage change in quantity will be smaller than the percentage change in price, so 
an increase in price will increase total revenue.
Table 20.6 shows, for different types of goods, the effects of changes in price on 
total revenue.
• Elastic demand. The relationship between price and total revenue is negative: An 
increase in price decreases total revenue; a decrease in price increases total revenue.
• Inelastic demand. The relationship between price and total revenue is positive: An 
increase in price increases total revenue; a decrease in price decreases total revenue.
• Unit elastic demand. Total revenue does not vary with price.

We can use the relationships summarized in Table 20.6 to work backward. If we 
observe the relationship between the price of a product and total sales revenue of the 
product, we can determine whether the demand for the product is elastic or inelas-
tic. Suppose that when a music store increases the price of its CDs, its total revenue 
from CDs drops. The negative relationship between price and total revenue means that 
demand for the store’s CDs is elastic: Total revenue decreases because consumers are 
very responsive to an increase in price, buying a much smaller quantity. In contrast, sup-
pose that when a city increases the price it charges for water, the total revenue from water 
sales increases. The positive relationship between price and total revenue ­suggests that 
the demand for the city’s water is inelastic: Total revenue increases because ­consumers 
are not very responsive to an increase in price.
Using Elasticity to Predict the Revenue Effects of Price Changes
If we know whether the demand for a product is elastic or inelastic, we can predict the 
effect of a change in price on total revenue. Here are four illustrations of the revenue 
consequences of changes in price:
1	 Market versus Brand Elasticity: The demand for a specific brand of a product 
is more elastic than the demand for the product. Although the demand for coffee 
is inelastic (price elasticity of demand = 0.30), the demand for a specific brand of 
coffee is elastic (price elasticity = 0.30). Therefore, a price cut on a specific brand 
of coffee will increase a firm’s total revenue.
2	 Bus Fares and Deficits: In every large city in the United States, the public bus 
system runs a deficit: Operating costs exceed revenues from passenger fares. 
The price elasticity of demand for bus ridership in the typical city is inelastic, 
about 0.33.4 Therefore, the good news associated with a fare hike (more revenue 
per rider) will dominate the bad news (fewer riders), and total fare revenue will 
increase, reducing the bus deficit.
3	 A Bumper Crop Is Bad News for Farmers: A bumper crop of soybeans (an 
unusually large harvest) brings good news and bad news for farmers. The good 
news is that they will sell more bushels of soybeans. The bad news is that the 
increase in supply will decrease the equilibrium price of soybeans, so farmers 
will get less money per bushel. Unfortunately for farmers, the demand for 
soybeans and many other agricultural products is inelastic, meaning that to 
sell the extra output, the price must fall by a relatively large amount. The bad 
news dominates the good news, so a bumper crop means less total revenue for 
farmers.
4	 Antidrug Policies and Property Crime: What is the connection between anti-
drug policies and property crimes such as robbery, burglary, and auto theft? The 
government uses various policies to restrict the supply of illegal drugs, and the

decrease in supply increases the equilibrium price. Because the demand for illegal 
drugs is inelastic, the increase in price will increase total spending on illegal drugs.5 
A drug addict who supports his or her habit by stealing personal property will 
commit more property crimes to pay for the pricier drugs. In other words, there 
is a trade-off: A policy that increases drug prices will reduce drug consumption, 
but will also increase the amount of property crime committed by addicts who 
continue to abuse drugs.
Elasticity and Total Revenue for a Linear Demand Curve
It is often useful to represent the demand for a product with a linear demand curve. A 
linear demand curve—a straight line—has a constant slope, but that does not mean that 
it has a constant elasticity of demand. In fact, the price elasticity of demand decreases as 
we move downward along a linear demand curve. On the upper half of a linear demand 
curve, demand is elastic; on the lower half of the curve, demand is inelastic. At the 
midpoint of a linear demand curve, demand is unit elastic. 
Price Elasticity along a Linear Demand Curve
We can use Panel A of Figure 20.2 to show how price elasticity varies along a linear 
demand curve. The slope of the demand curve is -$2 per unit quantity. We see this 
by picking any two points and computing the slope as the vertical difference between 
the two points (the “rise”) divided by the horizontal difference between the two points 
(the “run”). For example, between points e and u, the vertical difference is -$30 and the 
horizontal difference is 15, so the slope is -$30/15 = -$2. That means a $2 decrease 
in price increases the quantity demanded by one unit.
Table 20.7 shows how to compute the price elasticity of demand with three 
starting points: e (for elastic demand), u (for unit elastic), and i (for inelastic). As 
shown in columns B and D, a $2 reduction in price increases the quantity demanded 
by one unit.

Vanity Plates and the Elasticity of Demand
Applying the Concepts #2: How does an increase in price affect total expenditures?
Although Virginians may be unusually vain, a more plausible 
explanation is that the price of vanity plates is only $10, or about 
one-third of the average price in the United States.
Is the low price in Virginia rational from the state’s perspec-
tive? Suppose the state’s objective is to maximize the revenue 
from vanity plates. According to a recent study, the demand 
for vanity plates in Virginia is inelastic, with a price elasticity of 
demand equal to 0.26. Therefore, if the state increased the price, 
the total revenue from vanity plates would increase.  Related to 
Exercises 2.4 and 2.14.

Demand is elastic along the upper half of a linear demand curve, so an increase in quantity from a 
decrease in price increases total revenue (between points a and b on the total-revenue curve). Demand 
is inelastic along the lower half of a linear demand curve, so an increase in quantity from a decrease in 
price decreases total revenue (between points b and c). Total revenue is maximized at the midpoint of a

• Column C: Percentage change in price. Starting from point e, we cut $2 off an 
$80 price, resulting in a 2.5 percent price cut. The same $2 price cut is larger in 
percentage terms farther down the demand curve, where the price is lower. For 
point u, the percentage change in price is -4 percent (equal to -$2/$50), and 
for point i the percentage change in price is -10 percent (equal to -$2/$20).
• Column E: Percentage change in quantity. At point e, we start with 10 units, so a 
one-unit increase in quantity is a 10 percent increase. Moving down the column, 
the same one-unit increase in quantity is smaller in percentage terms as we move 
down the demand curve, where the quantity is larger. For point u, the percentage 
change in price is 4 percent (equal to 1/25), and for point i the percentage change 
in quantity is 2.5 percent (equal to 1/40).
• Column F: Price elasticity of demand. Starting from point e, the price elasticity is 
large (4.0) because the percentage change in quantity (10 percent) is four times 
the percentage change in price (2.5 percent). Starting at point u, demand is unit 
elastic because the percentage change in quantity equals the percentage change 
in price. Starting from point i, demand is inelastic (0.25) because the percentage 
change in quantity is one-fourth the percentage change in price.
Why does the price elasticity vary along a linear demand curve? It’s tempting to 
think the elasticity will be constant because a straight line has a constant slope. But that’s 
incorrect because we measure elasticity by percentage changes, not absolute changes. 
As we move downward along the demand curve, we’re moving in the direction of larger 
quantities, so the same absolute change in quantity (one unit) becomes a smaller percent-
age change in quantity. At the same time, as we move downward along the curve, we 
are moving to lower prices, so a $2 price reduction leads to a larger ­percentage change 
in price. As a result, the elasticity (the ratio of the percentage changes) decreases as we 
move downward along the demand curve.
A p p l i c a t i o n  3
Drones and the Lower Half of a Linear Demand Curve
Applying the Concepts #3: Will a firm choose a point on the lower half of a linear demand curve?
at the midpoint of the demand curve (half of $800). At a price 
of $300, the firm is below the midpoint of the demand curve, 
so the demand for its product is price inelastic. As a result, an 
increase in price from $300 to $400 would increases total rev-
enue: the percentage decrease in quantity is less than the per-
centage increase in price. The increase in price would decrease 
the quantity of drones demanded (the law of demand), so the 
firm would produce fewer drones at a lower total cost. Because 
an increase in price increases total revenue and decreases total 
cost, the firm’s profit would increase. The same logic applies to 
any price below the midpoint price of $400.
How much higher (how much above $400) should the price 
go? As we’ll see later in the book, it depends on the cost of 
producing the product. Although we don’t have the relevant cost 
information to pick the best price, we know for certain that it will 
be no less than $400 because a firm will never operate below 
the midpoint of a linear demand curve.  Related to Exercises 
3.5 and 3.9.
Suppose a firm that produces hobby drones (for civilian use) has 
a linear demand curve for its product, with a vertical intercept of 
$800. The firm currently charges a price of $300. Do you have 
any advice for the firm?
Your advice should be to increase the price. The price of 
$300 is certainly too low because it is less than the $400 price

Elasticity and Total Revenue for a Linear Demand Curve
Panel B of Figure 20.2 shows the relationship between total revenue and the quantity 
sold for the linear demand curve. Demand is elastic along the upper half of a linear 
demand curve, which means that a decrease in price will increase the quantity sold by 
a larger percentage amount. As a result, total revenue will increase, as shown by the 
positively sloped total-revenue curve between points a and b. In contrast, demand is 
inelastic along the lower half of a linear demand curve, which means that a decrease in 
price will increase the quantity sold by a smaller percentage amount. As a result, total 
revenue will decrease, as shown by the negatively sloped total-revenue curve between 
points b and c. The total-revenue curve reaches its maximum at the midpoint of the 
linear demand curve, where demand is unit elastic. In Figure 20.2, demand is unit 
elastic at point u on the demand curve, so total revenue reaches its maximum at $1,250 
at point b on the total-revenue curve. 
Other Elasticities of Demand
We’ve seen that the price elasticity of demand measures the responsiveness of consum-
ers to changes in the price of a particular good. Of course, the demand for a particu-
lar product also depends on other variables such as consumer income and the prices 
of related goods—substitutes and complements. We can use two other elasticities to 
measure the responsiveness of consumers to changes in these other variables that affect 
demand: income elasticity of demand and cross-price elasticity of demand. 
Income Elasticity of Demand
We saw in Chapter 4 that the demand for a particular product depends in part on the 
consumer’s income. The income elasticity of demand measures the responsiveness 
of demand to changes in income, indicating how much more or less of a particular 
product is purchased as income changes. The income elasticity of demand is defined 
as the percentage change in quantity demanded divided by the percentage change in 
income:
Et =
percentage change in quantity demanded
percentage change in income
For example, if a 10 percent increase in income increases the quantity of books 
demanded by 15 percent, the income elasticity of demand for books is 1.50 (equal to 
15% divided by 10%).
We can use the income elasticities of demand for various products to classify 
the products. Recall from Chapter 4 that when a consumer’s income increases, he or 
she buys more of a “normal” good. If the income elasticity is positive—indicating a 
­positive relationship between income and demand—we say that the good is normal. 
New cars and new clothes are products that have positive income elasticities and 
are thus considered normal goods. In contrast, if the income elasticity is negative—
indicating a negative relationship between income and demand—we say the good is 
“inferior.” Some examples of inferior goods are intercity bus travel, used clothing, and 
used cars.
 
Cross-Price Elasticity of Demand
We saw in Chapter 4 that the demand for a particular product also depends in part on 
the prices of related goods—substitutes and complements. The cross-price elasticity 
of demand measures the responsiveness of demand to changes in the prices of other 
goods, indicating how much more or less of a particular product is purchased as other 
prices change. The cross-price elasticity is defined as the percentage change in quantity

As we saw in Chapter 4, two goods are considered substitutes if there is a positive 
­relationship between the quantity demanded of one good and the price of the other 
good. For example, an increase in the price of bananas increases the demand for apples 
as consumers substitute apples for the now relatively expensive bananas. For substitute 
goods, the cross-price elasticity is positive. In contrast, two goods are considered com-
plements if there is a negative relationship between the quantity demanded of one good 
and the price of the other. For example, an increase in the price of ice cream increases 
the cost of apple pie with ice cream, causing consumers to demand fewer apples. For 
complementary goods, the cross-price elasticity is negative. Table 20.8 summarizes the 
signs (positive or negative) for different types of goods.

The Price Elasticity of Supply
We’ve used the concept of elasticity to measure the responsiveness of consumers to 
changes in prices. We now look at elasticity on the supply side of the market. The price 
elasticity of supply measures the responsiveness of the quantity supplied to changes 
in price. We compute this elasticity by dividing the percentage change in quantity sup-
plied by the percentage change in price:
Es =
percentage change in quantity supplied
percentage change in price
We can use some of the numbers in Figure 20.3 to compute the price elasticity of 
supply of milk. Consider Panel A, with a relatively steep supply curve. When the price 
of milk increases from $1.00 to $1.20, the quantity supplied increases from 100 million 
gallons (point a) to 102 million gallons (point b). The percentage change in quantity is 
the change (2) divided by the initial value (100), or 2 percent:
percentage change in quantity supplied =
2
100 = 2%
The percentage change in price is the change ($0.20) divided by the initial value ($1.00), 
or 20 percent:
percentage change in price = $0.20
$1.00 = 20%
Dividing the percentage change in quantity supplied by the percentage change in price, 
the price elasticity of supply is 0.10: 
Es =
percentage change in quantity supplied
percentage change in price
= 2%
20% = 0.10

What Determines the Price Elasticity of Supply?
What’s the connection between the slope of the supply curve and the price elasticity of 
supply? With a steep curve, a given increase in price (in the denominator of the elastic-
ity formula) generates a small increase in quantity supplied (in the numerator of the 
elasticity formula). In Panel A of Figure 20.3, an increase in price from $1.00 to $1.20 
increases the quantity supplied from 100 to 102, so the price elasticity of supply is 0.10 
(equal to 2% divided by 10%). In contrast, with a relatively flat supply curve the same 
increase in price generates a larger increase in quantity supplied, so the supply elasticity 
is relatively large. In Panel B of Figure 20.3, an increase in price from $1.00 to $1.20 
increases the quantity supplied from 100 to 150, so the price elasticity of supply is 2.50 
(equal to 50% divided by 20%).
Why is the market supply curve positively sloped? As we saw in Chapter 4, the 
market supply curve shows the marginal cost of production. A positively sloped supply 
curve tells us that the marginal cost of production increases as the total output of the 
industry increases. In other words, if we want to get more output out of an industry, the 
price must rise to cover the higher production costs associated with a larger ­industry. 
For example, as the total output of the gasoline industry increases, the worldwide 
demand for crude oil increases, pushing up its price. So to get more gasoline, the 
price of gasoline must increase to cover the higher cost of crude oil. The more rapidly 
crude-oil prices rise, the larger the increase in the gasoline price required to get more 
gasoline—and the steeper the gasoline supply curve.
The price elasticity of supply is determined by how rapidly production costs 
increase as the total output of the industry increases. If the marginal cost increases 
rapidly, the supply curve is relatively steep and the price elasticity is relatively low. For 
example, if crude-oil prices increase rapidly as the total amount of gasoline increases, 
the supply curve for gasoline will be relatively steep and the price elasticity of supply of 
gasoline will be relatively low. In contrast, the output of the pencil industry increases 
the prices of wood and other inputs used to produce pencils are unlikely to increase by 
much, so the supply curve will be relatively flat and the price elasticity of supply will 
be relatively large.
The Role of Time: Short-Run versus Long-Run Supply Elasticity
Time is an important factor in determining the price elasticity of supply for a product. 
As we saw in Chapter 4, the market supply curve is positively sloped because of two 
responses to an increase in price:
• Short run. A higher price encourages existing firms to increase their output by 
purchasing more materials and hiring more workers.
• Long run. New firms enter the market and existing firms expand their production 
facilities to produce more output.
The short-run response is limited because of the principle of diminishing returns.
P r i n c i p l e  o f  D i m i n i s h i n g  R e t u r n s
Suppose output is produced with two or more inputs, and we 
increase one input while holding the other input or inputs fixed. 
Beyond some point—called the point of diminishing returns—output 
will increase at a decreasing rate.
In the short run, the fixed input is the firm’s production facility. Although a higher 
price will induce firms to produce more, the response is limited by the fixed capacity 
of the firms’ production facilities. As a result, the short-run supply curve is relatively 

part 8
450
steep and the short-run supply elasticity is relatively small. This case is illustrated by 
Panel A of Figure 20.4.
The long-run supply response to an increase in price is not limited by diminish-
ing returns because production facilities are not fixed. Over time, new firms enter the 
market with new production facilities and old firms build new facilities. As a result, a 
given increase in price generates a larger increase in quantity supplied. The long-run 
supply curve will be relatively flat and the elasticity of supply will be relatively large. 
This case is illustrated by Panel B of Figure 20.4.
Extreme Cases: Perfectly Inelastic Supply and Perfectly 
Elastic Supply
Figure 20.4 shows the extreme cases of supply elasticity. The supply curve in Panel A 
is a vertical line, indicating that regardless of price, the quantity supplied is 50 units. 
This is the case of perfectly inelastic supply, with a price elasticity of supply equal to 
zero. The numerator in the elasticity expression (the percentage change in quantity 
supplied) is zero, regardless of the percentage change in the price of the good. Land is 
an example of a product that has a perfectly inelastic supply. In the words of American 
humorist and author Will Rogers, “The trouble with land is that they’re not making it 
anymore.”
The supply curve in Panel B of Figure 20.4 is a horizontal line, indicating that the 
quantity supplied is infinitely responsive to any change in price. This is the case of 
perfectly elastic supply, with a price elasticity of supply equal to infinity. The 
­numerator in the elasticity expression (the percentage change in quantity supplied) is 
infinite, regardless of the percentage change in the price. One implication of this sup-
ply curve is that if the price were to drop below $4, the quantity supplied would fall 
to zero.

What is the economic logic behind a horizontal supply curve? Recall that the 
supply curve shows the marginal cost of production. A horizontal supply curve indi-
cates that the marginal cost of production doesn’t change as the total output of 
the industry increases. For example, if the production cost per pencil is $0.20 no 
matter how many pencils the industry produces, the supply curve will be horizontal 
at $0.20.

Chapter 20 • Elasticity: A Measure of Responsiveness

Predicting Changes in Quantity Supplied
We can use the price elasticity of supply to predict the effect of price changes on the 
quantity supplied. For example, suppose that the elasticity of supply is 0.80 and the 
price increases by 5 percent. Rearranging the elasticity formula, we would predict a 4 
percent increase in the quantity supplied:
 percentage change in quantity supplied = Es * percentage change in price 
 = 0.80 * 5% = 4%
As we saw in Chapter 4, many governments establish minimum prices for agricul-
tural products. The higher the minimum price, the larger the quantity supplied, con-
sistent with the law of supply. If we know the price elasticity of supply, we can predict 
just how much more will be supplied at a higher minimum price. For example, if the 
minimum price of cheese increases by 10 percent and the price elasticity is 0.60, the 
quantity of cheese supplied will rise by 6 percent:
 percentage change in quantity supplied = Es * percentage change in price 
 = 0.60 * 10% = 6%
Using Elasticities to Predict Changes in Prices
When demand or supply changes—that is, when the demand curve or the supply curve 
shifts—we can draw a demand and supply graph to predict whether the equilibrium 
price will increase or decrease. In many cases, the simple graph will show all we need to 
know about the effects of a change in supply or demand. But what if we want to predict 
how much a price will increase or decrease? We can use a simple formula to predict the 
change in the equilibrium price resulting from a change in demand or a change in supply.
The Price Effects of a Change in Demand
In Figure 20.5, an increase in demand shifts the demand curve to the right and increases 
the equilibrium price. We explained in Chapter 4 that a demand curve shifts as a result 
of a change in something other than the price of the product—for example, a change

The Short-Run and Long-Run Elasticity of Supply of Coffee
Applying the Concepts #5: Why is supply more price-elastic in the long run?
The coffee industry provides a good example of the difference 
between the short-run and long-run price elasticity of supply. 
The price elasticity of supply over a 1-year period is relatively 
low. If the price of coffee beans increases by 20 percent and 
stays there for a year, the quantity of coffee supplied will increase 
by a relatively small amount. A newly planted coffee bush takes 
3–5 years to yield marketable beans, so in the short run (up to 
3 years), an increase in coffee production requires an increase 
in the quantity harvested per bush, which is possible if coffee 
producers apply more fertilizer and water to ­coffee bushes. In 
the long run, coffee farmers can also plant more ­coffee bushes, 
so a sustained increase in price generates a larger increase in 
quantity supplied. In the long run, the coffee supply curve is 
flatter and the supply elasticity is larger.  Related to Exercises 
5.5 and 5.6.

in income, tastes, or the price of a related good. When demand increases, the imme-
diate effect is excess demand: At the original price ($1.00), the quantity demanded 
exceeds the quantity supplied by 35 million gallons (135 million - 100 million). As the 
price increases, both consumers and producers help to eliminate the excess demand: 
­Consumers buy less (the law of demand), and firms produce more (the law of supply).
Under what conditions will an increase in demand cause a relatively small increase 
in price?
• Small increase in demand. If the shift of the demand curve is relatively small, the 
gap between the new demand and the old supply will be relatively small, and the 
small excess demand can be eliminated with a relatively small increase in price.
• Highly elastic demand. If consumers are very responsive to changes in price, the 
increase in price caused by excess demand will cause a large reduction in the 
quantity demanded. As a result, the excess demand will be eliminated with a 
relatively small increase in price.
• Highly elastic supply. If producers are very responsive to changes in price, the 
increase in price caused by excess demand will cause a large increase in the quan-
tity supplied. As a result, the excess demand will be eliminated with a relatively 
small increase in price.
▲  Figure 20.5  An Increase in Demand Increases the Equilibrium Price
An increase in demand shifts the demand curve to the right, increasing the equilibrium price. In this case, 
a 35 percent increase in demand increases the equilibrium price by 10 percent. Using the price-change 
formula, 10% = 35%/(2.5 + 1.0).

We can use the following price-change formula to predict the change in the equi-
librium price resulting from a change in demand. We divide the percentage change in 
demand by the sum of the price elasticities of supply and demand:
percentage change in equilibrium price =
percentage change in demand
Es + Ed
The numerator is the rightward shift of the demand curve in percentage terms. In 
Figure 20.5, the initial quantity demanded at a price of $1.00 is 100 million ­gallons 
(shown by the initial demand curve), and the new quantity demanded at the same price 
is 135 million gallons (shown by the new demand curve). The change in demand is 
35 percent (35/100). The change in demand is in the numerator of the price-change 
formula, indicating that the larger the increase in demand (the larger the rightward 
shift of the demand curve), the larger the increase in the equilibrium price. The two 
price elasticities appear in the denominator. This is sensible because if consumers and 

Chapter 20 • Elasticity: A Measure of Responsiveness
453
producers are very responsive to changes in price (the elasticities are large numbers), 
excess demand will be eliminated with a relatively small increase in price.
We can illustrate the price-change formula with a simple example. Suppose that 
demand increases by 35 percent (the demand curve shifts to the right by 35 percent). 
If the supply elasticity is 2.5 and the demand elasticity is 1.0, the predicted change in 
the equilibrium price is 10 percent:
percentage change in equilibrium price =
35%
2.5 + 1.0 = 35%
3.5
= 10%
In Figure 20.5, the equilibrium price increases by 10 percent, from $1.00 to $1.10. 
If either demand or supply were less elastic (if either of the elasticity numbers were 
smaller), the predicted change in price would be larger. For example, if the supply 
elasticity were 0.75 instead of 2.5, we would predict a 20 percent increase in price (35% 
divided by 1.75).
What about the direction of the price change? We know from Chapter 4 that an 
increase in demand increases the equilibrium price, and a decrease in demand decreases 
the equilibrium price. Therefore, the percentage change in price is positive when the 
change in demand is positive (when demand increases and the demand curve shifts 
to the right), and negative when the change in demand is negative (when demand 
decreases and the demand curve shifts to the left). For example, suppose the demand for 
a product decreases by 12 percent (the demand curve shifts to the left by 12 percent). If 
the supply elasticity is 1.6 and the demand elasticity is 0.40, the price-change formula 
shows that the equilibrium price will decrease by 6 percent:
percentage change in equilibrium price =
-12%
1.6 + 0.4 = -12%
2.0
= -6%
To illustrate the practical use of the price-change formula, consider the effect of 
population growth on housing prices. The Portland metropolitan area is expected to 
grow by 12 percent in the next decade. Suppose planners want to predict the effects of 
population growth on the equilibrium price of housing. At the metropolitan level, the price 
elasticity of supply is about 5.0 and the price elasticity of demand is 1.0. If the demand for 
housing is proportional to population, a 12 percent increase in population will increase 
the equilibrium price of housing by 2 percent:
percentage change in equilibrium price =
12%
5.0 + 1.0 = 12%
6.0
= 2%
The Price Effects of a Change in Supply
Consider next the effects of a change in supply on the equilibrium price. In Figure 20.6, 
a decrease in supply shifts the supply curve to the left and increases the equilibrium 
price. We explained in Chapter 4 that a change in supply results from changes in 
something other than the price of the product—for example, a change in the cost of 
labor or raw materials, a change in production technology, or a change in the number 
of firms. The immediate effect of a decrease in supply is excess demand: At the original 
price, the quantity demanded exceeds the quantity supplied. In response to the excess 
demand, the price increases. ­Consumers respond to the higher price by purchasing less, 
and producers respond by producing more, so the gap between the quantity demanded 
and the quantity supplied narrows.
Under what conditions will a decrease in supply cause a relatively small increase 
in price?
• Small decrease in supply. If the shift of the supply curve is relatively small, the gap 
between the new supply and the old demand will be relatively small, and the 
small excess demand can be eliminated with a relatively small increase in price.
• Highly elastic demand. If consumers are very responsive to changes in price, the 
increase in price caused by excess demand will cause a large reduction in the

­reduction in supply increases the equilibrium price by 10 percent. Using the price-change 
formula, 10% = -(-30%/(2.3 + 0.70)).

• Highly elastic supply. If producers are very responsive to changes in price, the 
increase in price caused by excess demand will cause a large increase in the quan-
tity supplied. As a result, the excess demand will be eliminated with a relatively 
small increase in price.
We can use a variation on the price-change formula to predict the price effects 
of a change in supply. We modify the numerator of the formula by substituting the 
percentage change in supply for the percentage change in demand and then add a 
minus sign. The minus sign indicates a negative relationship between supply and the 
equilibrium price: When supply decreases (when the supply curve shifts to the left), 
the price increases; when supply increases, the price decreases:
percentage change in equilibrium price = -
percentage change in supply
Es + Ed
To illustrate the practical use of the price-change formula, consider the effects of 
import restrictions on equilibrium prices. Suppose that import restrictions decrease 
the supply of shoes by 30 percent. As shown in Figure 20.6, the policy shifts the ­supply 
curve to the left by 30 percent: At the original price of $40, the quantity supplied 
decreases from 100 million pairs (point a) to 70 million pairs (point b). The decrease in 
supply increases the equilibrium price, and the price-change formula tells us just how 
much the price will increase.
To use the price-change formula, we need the price elasticities of supply and 
demand. Suppose the supply elasticity is 2.3 and, as shown in Table 20.2, the demand 
elasticity is 0.70. Plugging these numbers into the price-change formula, we predict a 
10 percent increase in price:
percentage change in equilibrium price = -
-30%
2.3 + 0.70 = 30%

= 10%
In Figure 20.6, the price rises by 10 percent, from $40 to $44 per pair.

A Broken Pipeline and the Price of Gasoline
Applying the Concepts #6: How does a decrease in supply affect the equilibrium price?
demanded by 30 percent. Why did the price increase by only 
40 percent?
To predict a change in the equilibrium price, we must look 
at both sides of the market, demand and supply. When the 
Texas pipeline broke, gasoline sellers in Phoenix switched to 
the West Coast pipeline. The increase in the Phoenix retail price 
allowed Phoenix sellers to outbid sellers in other cities for gaso-
line produced by West Coast refineries. This is the law of supply 
in action: the increase in the Phoenix price diverted gasoline 
from other cities, reducing the impact of the pipeline break. As 
a result, the equilibrium price increased by only 40 percent, not 
the 150 percent that would have occurred in the absence of the 
supply boost from West Coast refineries.
We can use the price-change formula to illustrate this case. 
Suppose the price elasticity of supply is 0.55 and the price elas-
ticity of demand is 0.20. In this case, a 30 percent decrease in 
supply generates a 40 percent increase in the equilibrium price:
percentage change in equilibrium price = -
-30%
0.55 + 0.20
= 30%
0.75 = 40%

Dynamic of Supply, Demand, and Competition (Washington, D.C.: 2005).
In the chapter opener, a pipeline break decreased the supply 
of gasoline to the city of Phoenix by 30 percent and increased 
the equilibrium price by only 40 percent. Given a short-run 
price elasticity of demand for gasoline of 0.20, a price increase 
of 150 percent would be required to decrease the quantity 
This chapter explored 
the numbers behind 
the laws of demand 
and supply. The law 
of demand tells us 
that an increase in 
price decreases the 
quantity demanded, 
ceteris paribus. If we 
know the price elas-
ticity of demand for 
a particular product, 
we can determine just how much less of it will be purchased at the 
higher price. Similarly, if we know the price elasticity of supply for a 
product, we can determine just how much more of it will be supplied 
at a higher price. Here are the main points of the chapter:
1.	 The price elasticity of demand—defined as the ­percentage 
change in quantity demanded divided by the percentage 
change in price—measures the responsiveness of consumers 
to changes in price.
2.	 Demand is relatively elastic if there are good substitutes.
3.	 If demand is elastic, the relationship between price and total 
­revenue is negative. If demand is inelastic, the relationship 
between price and total revenue is positive.
4.	 The price elasticity of supply—defined as the percentage change 
in quantity supplied divided by the percentage change in price—
measures the responsiveness of producers to changes in price.

gasoline will decrease traffic volume by _________ per-
cent and increase fuel efficiency by _________ percent. 
(Related to Application 1 on page 439.)
1.8	 Demand is relatively elastic if the product has _________ 
(many/few) substitutes, a _________ (long/short) time 
passes, and the consumer spends a _________ (large/
small) fraction of his or her budget on the product.
Using Price Elasticity
Use price elasticity of demand to predict changes in quantity 
and total revenue.
2.1	 Recall the example “Beer Prices and Highway Deaths” 
from the chapter. A doubling of the tax on beer will 
reduce the number of highway deaths among young 
adults by _________ percent.
2.2	 Recall the example “Cigarette Prices and Teenagers” 
from the chapter. A 20 percent increase in the price 
of cigarettes will reduce the quantity of cigarettes 
demanded by teenagers by _________ percent.
2.3	 Suppose the price elasticity of demand for color print-
ers is 1.60. If you want to see the quantity demanded 
for color printers to increase by 32 percent, the per-
centage change in price should be _________ percent.
2.4	 In the state of Virginia, the demand for vanity license 
plates is _________ (elastic/inelastic), so an increase in 
price would _________ (increase/decrease) total rev-
enue from vanity plates. (Related to Application 2 on 
page 443.)
2.5	 A policy that limits the supply of illegal drugs increases 
the number of burglaries and robberies because 
_________ is _________.
2.6	 If demand is elastic, an increase in price (increases/
decreases) total revenue; if demand is inelastic, an 
increase in price _________ (increases/decreases) total 
revenue.
2.7	 Suppose that if poor households have a price elasticity 
of demand for medical care of 0.50 and rich households 
have a price elasticity of demand for medical care of 
0.25, then a price increase of 10 percent would lead to 
the poor households reducing their quantity demanded 
for medical care by _________ percent.
2.8	 MADD Beer Tax. Recall the example “Beer Prices 
and Highway Deaths” from the chapter. The organi-
zation Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD) has a 
goal of reducing the number of highway deaths among 
young adults by 39 percent. Assume that the number 
of highway deaths for young adults is proportional to 
their beer consumption. By what percentage must the 
price of beer increase to meet the MADD target?
2.9	 Meeting the Teenage Smoking Target. Recall the 
example “Cigarette Prices and Teenagers” from the 
chapter. One of the stated objectives of the federal 
Tobacco Agreement of 1997 was to reduce teenage 
smoking by 60 percent. The price must increase by 
_________ percent to achieve this target.
All problems are assignable in MyLab Economics.

2.10	 Use the Correct Elasticity. Your company currently 
sells 50 units of salt per year and has decided to increase 
its price from $1.00 to $1.20. In a meeting, one person 
says, “As shown in Table 20.2 on page 438, the price elas-
ticity of demand for salt is 0.10, so if we increase the price 
of salt by 20 percent, the quantity demanded will decrease 
by 2 percent.” What’s wrong with this statement?
2.11	 Projecting Transit Ridership. As a transit planner, 
your job is to predict ridership and total fare revenue. 
Suppose the short-run elasticity of demand for com-
muter rail (over a 1-month period) is 0.60, and the 
long-run elasticity (over a 2-year period) is 1.60. The 
current ridership is 100,000 people per day. Suppose 
the transit authority decides to increase its fares from 
$2.00 to $2.20.
a.	 Predict the changes in train ridership over a 
1-month period (the short run) and a 2-year period 
(the long run).
b.	Over the 1-month period, will total fare revenue 
increase or decrease? What about the 2-year period?
2.12	 Income and the Price Elasticity of Demand for 
Medical Care. Like many other developing nations, 
Peru subsidizes medical care, charging consumers a 
small fraction of the cost of providing services such as 
visits to medical clinics. The price elasticity of demand 
for medical care is 0.67 for poor households but only 
0.03 for wealthy households. Suppose the government 
reduced its subsidies for medical care, and the price to 
consumers increased by 10 percent. Predict the changes 
in the quantity of medical care demanded (for example, 
the number of visits to clinics) for poor households and 
wealthy households.
2.13	 Revenue Effects of a Bumper Crop. Your job is to 
predict the total revenue generated by the nation’s corn 
crop. Last year’s crop was 100 million bushels, and the 
price was $5 per bushel. This year’s weather was favor-
able throughout the country, and this year’s crop will 
be 110 million bushels, or 10 percent larger than last 
year’s. The price elasticity of demand for corn is 0.50.
a.	 Predict the effect of the bumper crop on the price of 
corn. Assume that the entire crop is sold this year, 
meaning that the price elasticity of supply is zero. 
Illustrate with a complete graph.
b.	Predict the total revenue from this year’s corn crop.
c.	 Did the favorable weather increase or decrease the 
total revenue from corn? Why?
2.14	 Elasticity and Vanity Plates. Suppose the price elas-
ticity of demand for vanity plates in your state is 0.60. 
The initial price is $20 and the initial quantity is 1,000 
plates per week. Suppose the state increases the price 
by 10 percent. (Related to Application 2 on page 443.)
a.	 Predict the new quantity per week and total revenue 
per week.
b.	The increase in price _________ (increases, 
decreases) total revenue because _________ is 
_________.
2.15	The Price of Heroin and Property Crime. The 
price elasticity of demand for heroin is 0.27. Suppose 
that half of heroin users support their habits with 
property crime, so the loss from property crimes 
­committed by heroin users equals half the total spend-
ing (total revenue) on the drug. Suppose the govern-
ment reduces the supply of heroin, increasing the 
equilibrium price by 20 percent. Fill in the blanks in 
the following table.

with satellite dishes. This year, the cable company 
increased its price by 20 percent, but its total revenue 
decreased. Provide an explanation for the different 
revenue ­consequences of the cable company’s price 
hikes.

state issues wilderness passes to people who hike, bike, 
and ski in wilderness areas. Its objective is to maximize

your firm, an increase in price is a win–win situation. 
Your total revenue will increase and your total cost will 
decrease. Therefore, you’ll earn more profit (equal to 
Total Revenue – Total Cost).”

Market Efficiency and 
Government Intervention
21
C h a p t e r
The housing market in New York 
City is highly regulated.
The city issues a relatively small number of permits 
for new condominium buildings, and rapid growth 
in the demand for condominiums has resulted 
in ­soaring condominium prices. To measure the 
effects of the city’s supply restrictions on housing 
prices, we can compare the construction cost of a 
­standard condominium to its market price. This is a 
sensible approach because in a competitive industry 
like housing, the equilibrium price in an unregulated 
market would equal the cost of construction. The 
construction cost for a Manhattan condominium is 
about $300 per square foot, while the market price 
is roughly $600 per square foot.1 In other words, the city’s supply restrictions double the price of the typical 
­Manhattan condominium.
Other cities restrict the supply of housing and increase prices to varying degrees. The price effects are relatively 
large in highly restrictive cities such as San Francisco (53% gap between the market price and construction cost), 
Los Angeles (34%), Washington, D.C. (22%), and Boston (19%), and relatively small in less restrictive cities such 
as Chicago (6%) and Baltimore (2%). Many cities do not restrict the supply of housing, and housing prices in these 
cities (Houston, Minneapolis, Rochester, Tampa, Cincinnati, and Pittsburgh) match the construction cost of housing.

hen making choices, people strive for efficiency, trying to do the best they 
can, given their limited resources. The notion of efficiency applies to all sorts 
of decisions. A household decides how much to spend on consumer goods, 
how much to save, and how much to spend on a college education. The household tries 
to do the best it can, given its limited income. A Frisbee producer decides how many 
workers to hire and tries to make as much profit as possible, given the limitations of its 
factory. A government chooses between shuttle trips and Mars missions and tries to 
generate as much scientific information as possible, given its space exploration budget. 
As we’ll see, economics provides a framework to guide us from inefficient choices to 
efficient ones.
In Chapter 3 we discussed the exchange principle, which conveys the simple idea 
that transactions make both the buyer and the seller better off.
efficiency
A situation in which people do the best 
they can, given their limited resources.
P r i n c i p l e  o f  V o l u n ta r y  E x c h a n g e 
A voluntary exchange between two people makes both people better off.
In this chapter, we take a closer look at the benefits of exchange, examining the expe-
riences of both buyers and sellers. We see how to compute the surplus or net benefit 
from a market and see why the market equilibrium—where the quantity demanded 
equals the quantity supplied—may generate the largest possible surplus. We explore 
the logic behind Adam Smith’s metaphor of the invisible hand—the idea that individual 
buyers and sellers, each acting in his or her own self-interest, may promote the social 
interest.
You’ll notice that we use the word “may” in noting the virtues of markets and the 
invisible hand. A market equilibrium will generate the largest possible surplus when 
four conditions are met:
• No external benefits: The benefits of a product (a good or service) are confined to 
the person who pays for it.
• No external costs: The cost of producing a product is confined to the person who 
sells it.
• Perfect information: Buyers and sellers know enough about the product to make 
informed decisions about whether to buy or sell it.
• Perfect competition: Each firm produces such a small quantity that the firm cannot 
affect the price.
In this chapter, we discuss markets that meet these four conditions. As we’ll see 
later in the book, when these conditions are not satisfied, free markets don’t gener-
ate the largest possible surplus. A market that generates the largest possible surplus 
is efficient. A situation is efficient if we are doing the best we can, given our limited 
resources. In the case of a market, doing the best we can means getting the largest 
possible surplus. When that happens, we say that the market is efficient. ­Governments 
around the world intervene in markets, sometimes promoting efficiency, and other 
times preventing it. We’ll see that when the four efficiency conditions are met, gov-
ernment intervention is inefficient in the sense that it decreases the total surplus of 
the market.
Consumer Surplus and Producer Surplus
We begin our discussion of market efficiency by showing how to measure the benefits 
experienced by consumers and producers. We start with consumers and then look at 
producers.

The Demand Curve and Consumer Surplus
If you said “thank you” the last time you purchased a book, did you mean it? If you 
were willing to pay more for the book than the price you actually paid, you probably 
really did mean it when you said “thank you” because you got what you considered to 
be a good deal. Your willingness to pay for a product (a good or a service) is the maxi-
mum amount you are willing to pay for the product. Your consumer surplus is equal 
to your willingness to pay minus the price you actually pay. For example, if you are 
willing to pay $21 for a book that you buy for $10, your consumer surplus is $11.
The market demand curve shows consumers’ willingness to pay for a product. 
Consider the demand for lawn cutting in a small town; the market demand curve is 
shown in Figure 21.1. The demand curve shows that at a price of $25, no one will pay 
to have the lawn cut (point t), but if the price drops to $22, the first consumer (Juan) 
will pay for a lawn cut. This suggests that Juan is willing to pay up to $22 to have his 
lawn cut, but no more. Moving down the demand curve, the second consumer (Tupak) 
will pay for a lawn cutting when the price drops to $19, meaning that his willingness 
to pay is $19. As we continue to move downward along the demand curve, the price 
drops below the willingness to pay for more and more consumers, so more people have 
their lawns cut.
willingness to pay
The maximum amount a consumer is 
­willing to pay for a product.
consumer surplus
The amount a consumer is willing to 
pay for a product minus the price the 
­consumer actually pays.
▲  Figure 21.1  The Demand Curve and Consumer Surplus
Consumer surplus equals the maximum amount a consumer is willing to pay (shown by the demand 
curve) minus the price paid. Juan is willing to pay $22, so if the price is $10, his consumer surplus is 
$12. The market consumer surplus equals the sum of the surpluses earned by all consumers in the 
­market. In this case, the market consumer surplus is $30 = $12 + $9 + $6 + $3 + $0.

We can use the demand curve to measure just how much of a net benefit 
or surplus consumers get. Suppose that the price of a lawn cut is $10, and every-
one in town pays this price. Juan’s consumer surplus is $12, equal to his willing-
ness to pay ($22) minus the price. Similarly, Tupak’s consumer surplus is $9, 
equal to the difference between his willingness to pay ($19) and the market price. 
To compute the total consumer surplus in the lawn-cutting market, we simply add 
up the surpluses for each of the five consumers who buy lawn cutting at a price 
of $10. In this example, the market consumer surplus is $30, which is the sum of 

part 8

$12 (Juan) + $9 (Tupak) + $6 (Thurl) + $3 (Forest) + $0 (Fivola). The fifth con-
sumer (Fivola) gets no consumer surplus because the price equals her willingness to pay. 
The sixth person (Siggy) doesn’t have his lawn cut because the amount he is willing to 
pay is less than the price.
The Supply Curve and Producer Surplus
Like consumers, the people who produce goods and services say “thank you” when they 
sell their products. This suggests that they receive a net benefit or surplus from ­voluntary 
transactions. A seller’s willingness to accept is the minimum amount he or she is will-
ing to accept as payment for a product, and is equal to the marginal cost of production. 
For example, if your marginal cost of cutting a lawn is $4, you will be ­willing to accept 
any amount greater than or equal to $4. Of course, you’d prefer $10 to $4, but you’ll 
accept as little as $4 because the lower amount covers all your costs, including the 
opportunity cost of your time. Producer surplus equals the price a producer receives 
for a product minus the marginal cost of production. For example, if your marginal cost 
for cutting a lawn is $4 and you do it for $10, your producer surplus is $6.
Figure 21.2 shows the market supply curve for lawn cutting in our small town. 
Let’s imagine that up to six people are willing to cut lawns if the price is right, and 
each person can cut one lawn per hour. Each person incurs the same cost for renting a 
lawn mower but has a different opportunity cost for his or her time. The first producer 
(Abe) incurs a cost of $2, so he is willing to accept as little as $2 to cut a lawn. On the 
supply curve, if the price is $2, one person—Abe—will cut lawns. Bea has a higher 
opportunity cost of time, so her cost is $4, meaning that she won’t cut a lawn unless 
she is paid at least $4. So if the price is $4, two people—Abe and Bea—will cut lawns. 
Moving upward along the supply curve, the other potential lawn cutters have even 
higher costs, so they don’t start cutting until the price reaches their higher willingness 
to accept: $6 for Cecil, $8 for Dee, and so on. The higher the price, the larger the 
number of people willing to cut lawns.
willingness to accept
The minimum amount a producer is 
­willing to accept as payment for a product; 
equal to the marginal cost of production.
producer surplus
The price a producer receives for a 
­product minus the marginal cost of 
production.
▲  Figure 21.2  The Supply Curve and Producer Surplus
Producer surplus equals the market price minus the producer’s willingness to accept, or marginal cost 
(shown by the supply curve). Abe’s marginal cost is $2, so if the price is $10, his producer surplus is $8. 
The market producer surplus equals the sum of the surpluses earned by all producers in the market. In 
this case, the market producer surplus is $20 = $8 + $6 + $4 + $2 + $0.

equal to the difference between the price and her cost ($4). To compute the total producer 
surplus in the lawn-cutting market, we simply add up the surpluses for each of the five

producers who cut lawns at a price of $10. In this example, the market producer surplus 
is $20, which is the sum of $8 (Abe) + $6 (Bea) + $4 (Cecil) + $2 (Dee) + $0 (Eve). 
The fifth producer (Eve) gets no producer surplus because the price equals her cost, 
and the sixth potential producer (Efrin) doesn’t cut any lawns because the price is less 
than his cost. 
Market Equilibrium and Efficiency
Figure 21.3 puts the demand and supply curves together to show the equilibrium in the 
market for lawn cutting. The demand curve intersects the supply curve at a price of 
$10 per lawn. At this price, five lawns are cut, meaning that there are five buyers and 
five sellers. The total surplus of a market is the sum of consumer surplus and producer 
surplus. In Figure 21.3, the consumer surplus is $30 and the producer surplus is $20, 
so the total surplus of the market—shown by the shaded areas—is $50. As we’ll see in 
this part of the chapter, the market equilibrium generates the highest possible total 
surplus. That’s why we say that the market equilibrium is efficient: We can’t do any 
better in terms of the total surplus.
Total Surplus Is Lower with a Price below the Equilibrium Price
To see why the market equilibrium maximizes the total surplus of the market, let’s look 
at the total surplus of the market when the price is less than the equilibrium price. The 
government could set a maximum price, also known as a price ceiling.
Suppose the government imposes a maximum price of $4 on lawn cutting. As 
shown in Panel A of Figure 21.4, at this price only two people cut lawns—Abe and Bea. 
Abe’s producer surplus is shown by the darkly shaded area between the price line and 
the supply curve. For Bea, the price equals her willingness to accept, so she participates

Consumer Surplus of Internet Service
Applying the Concepts #1: How do we compute consumer surplus?
What is the consumer surplus from Internet service? Two recent 
studies compute consumers’ willingness to pay for Internet ser-
vice. For Japanese consumers, the average willingness to pay 
for Internet service (e-mail and Web browsing delivered over 
personal computers) is ¥5,623 per month, compared to an 
average price of broadband Internet service of ¥4,000. In other 
words, the average consumer surplus is ¥1,623, or about 40 
percent of the price. For U.S. consumers, the average willing-
ness to pay for Internet service is $85 per month, and with an 
average monthly price of $40, the consumer surplus is $45 per 
month.  Related to Exercises 1.8 and 1.9.

in the market but gets no producer surplus, receiving a price just high enough to keep 
her in the market. Consumers can buy only as much as producers are willing to sell, so 
the market consumer surplus equals the surpluses of just the first two consumers—Juan 
and Tupak. This is shown as the lightly shaded areas between the price line and the 
demand curve. By comparing Panel A in Figure 21.4 to Figure 21.3, we see that the 
maximum price reduces the total surplus of the market. For the first two lawns, con-
sumers simply gain at the expense of producers. The maximum price also eliminates 
the surpluses from the third and fourth lawns because these transactions don’t happen. 
Therefore, the total surplus decreases.
The maximum price reduces the total surplus of the market because it prevents 
some mutually beneficial transactions. For example, the third consumer, Thurl, is will-
ing to pay $16 to have his lawn cut, and the third producer, Cecil, is willing to cut a 
lawn if he is paid at least $6. Thurl is willing to pay more than Cecil requires, so cutting 
Thurl’s lawn would generate a net benefit of $10. If they split the difference, agreeing 
on a price of $11, each would get a surplus of $5. The maximum price prevents Thurl 
and Cecil from executing their transaction. The same logic applies to the fourth lawn: 
The maximum price prevents Forest and Dee from executing a transaction that would 
generate a net benefit of $5, equal to Forest’s willingness to pay ($13) minus Dee’s 
marginal cost ($8). 
Total Surplus Is Lower with a Price above the Equilibrium Price
To reinforce the notion that the market equilibrium maximizes the total surplus of 
the market, let’s look at the total surplus of the market when the price exceeds the 
equilibrium price. The government could set a minimum price, also known as a 
price floor. Suppose the government sets a minimum price for lawn cutting at $19. 
As shown in Panel B of Figure 21.4, the demand curve indicates that at a price of 
$19, only two consumers, Juan and Tupak, will have their lawns cut. The total 
surplus of the market is the sum of consumer and producer surplus for these first 
two lawns, the same as it was under the maximum price. Again, this is lower than 
the total surplus that the consumer and producer could have gained, as shown by 
Figure 21.3.
What’s the difference between the two pricing policies? Under a maximum price, 
the first two consumers gain at the expense of the first two producers, whereas under 
the minimum price, the first two producers gain at the expense of the first two con-
sumers. Like the maximum price, the minimum price prevents mutually beneficial 
transactions for the third, fourth, and fifth lawns. 
Efficiency and the Invisible Hand
The market equilibrium maximizes the total surplus of the market because it guarantees 
that all mutually beneficial transactions will happen. Once we reach the market equi-
librium at the intersection of the supply curve and demand curve, there are no more 
transactions that would benefit a buyer and a seller. The market demand curve tells us 
that the potential buyer of the sixth lawn cut (Siggy) is willing to pay only $7 for a lawn 
cut, and the supply curve tells us that the potential seller of the sixth lawn cut (Efrin) 
has a marginal cost of $12. This transaction doesn’t happen because the potential buyer 
is not willing to pay the cost of producing the good.
Our example of the market for lawn cutting illustrates a general lesson about mar-
kets. The typical market has thousands of buyers and thousands of sellers, each acting 
in his or her own self-interest. The market reaches the quantity that maximizes the 
total surplus of the market and is therefore efficient. Instead of using a bureaucrat to 
coordinate the actions of everyone in the market, we can rely on the actions of indi-
vidual consumers and individual producers, each guided only by self-interest. This is 
Adam Smith’s invisible hand in action.

Government Intervention in Efficient Markets
In most modern economies, governments take an active role. As we’ll see later in the 
book, government action can be justified on efficiency grounds when one of the four 
efficiency conditions listed at the beginning of the chapter is not being met. But for 
a market that meets the four efficiency conditions, the market equilibrium generates 
the largest possible total surplus, so government intervention can only decrease the 
surplus and cause inefficiency. A government motivated exclusively by efficiency would 
not intervene in such a market, but instead would permit the invisible hand to guide 
consumers and producers to the market equilibrium.
So why would a government intervene in an efficient market? Sometimes the gov-
ernment’s objective is not to promote efficiency—to maximize the size of the pie—but 
instead to slice the pie in favor of one group or another. For example, a government 
that restricts shoe imports prevents some domestic workers from losing their shoemak-
ing jobs. Of course, limiting imports will decrease the supply of shoes, and consumers 
will pay higher prices. As we’ll see, when the government intervenes in an efficient mar-
ket to slice the pie in favor of one group, the pie shrinks, so there is a trade-off between 
efficiency (maximizing the size of the pie) and distributional concerns (slicing the pie).
What is the role of economic analysis in exploring government intervention in 
efficient markets? We focus our attention on the inefficiencies of government interven-
tion, looking at how much the pie shrinks. We briefly discuss some of the distributional 
consequences of intervention—how the slices change. The decision about whether 
intervention in an efficient market is worthwhile—whether the changes in the slices are 
worth losing part of the pie—is made in the political sphere. Economic analysis shows 
the trade-offs associated with public policies.
Under some circumstances, groups of people who fare poorly in the market econ-
omy deserve special consideration. If a society decides that a particular group merits 
special treatment—for example, workers who lose their jobs because of imports—a 
more direct form of assistance is generally superior than intervention in efficient mar-
kets by the government. One alternative would be for the government to provide 
money for workers to get training for new jobs.

Rent Control and Mismatches
Applying the Concepts #2: Why does the market equilibrium maximize the value of a market?
different apartment. For example, when a single person renting 
a tiny apartment gets married, he or she is likely to move to a 
larger place. But a consumer in a rent-controlled apartment may 
stay in the tiny but inexpensive apartment, generating a housing 
mismatch. A recent study suggests that in New York City, about 
20 percent of rent-controlled apartments are mismatched.
The most famous case of a mismatched tenant is former 
Mayor Koch of New York. When he was elected mayor and 
moved into the mayor’s official residence, he held onto his rent-
controlled apartment, presumably anticipating his post-mayor 
life in an apartment at a controlled rent that was roughly one-
third the market rent.  Related to Exercise 2.7.

ing under Rent Control,” American Economic Review 93 (2003), pp. 1027–1046.
Under rent control, the government sets a maximum price for 
housing, decreasing the quantity supplied and the total value 
of the market. Rent control and other maximum prices cause 
inefficiency of another sort. Consider a consumer living in a 
rent-controlled apartment who experiences a change in circum-
stances that would normally cause the consumer to move to a 

Chapter 21 • Market Efficiency and Government Intervention

Controlling Prices—Maximum and Minimum Prices
We start our discussion of government intervention with policies that control prod-
uct prices. The government could set a maximum price or a minimum price. In both 
cases, if the market meets the four efficiency conditions listed at the beginning of the 
chapter, government intervention reduces the total surplus of the market and causes 
inefficiency.
Setting Maximum Prices
We’ve already seen two different effects of a maximum price or price ceiling. In Chap-
ter 4 we saw that when the government sets a maximum price that is less than the 
equilibrium price, the result is permanent excess demand for the product. The maxi-
mum price encourages firms to supply less and encourages consumers to buy more. So 
at the maximum price there is excess demand because consumers want to buy more 
than producers want to sell. In this chapter, we saw from Panel A in Figure 21.4 that 
a maximum price decreases the total surplus of the market: Some consumers gain at 
the expense of producers, and the total surplus decreases. Here are some examples of 
goods that have been subject to maximum prices or may be subject to maximum prices 
in the near future:
• Rental housing. During World War II, the federal government instituted a 
national system of rent controls. Although only New York City continued rent 
control after the war, during the 1970s rent control spread to dozens of cities.
• Gasoline. In response to sharp increases in the price of gasoline in the 1970s, the 
national government set a maximum price on gasoline.
• Medical goods and services. Some proposals to control medical costs include price 
controls for prescription drugs.
In all three cases, a maximum price will cause excess demand and reduce the total 
surplus of the market. 
Rent Control
Figure 21.5 shows the effects of rent control on consumer and producer surplus. Panel 
A shows the market equilibrium, with a price (monthly rent) of $400 per apartment 
and a quantity of 1,000 apartments. The total surplus is the sum of the consumer 
surplus and producer surplus, shown as the area between the demand curve and the 
supply curve. Panel B shows the effect of a maximum price of $300 per apartment. The 
decrease in price causes movement downward along the supply curve to point b, and 
the quantity of apartments supplied decreases to 700. Because the policy decreases the 
number of apartments from 1,000 to 700, the total surplus of the market decreases. For 
the first 700 apartments, consumers gain at the expense of producers, paying $300 per 
apartment rather than $400. Apartments 701 through 1,000 disappear from the market, 
so the surpluses associated with these apartments are lost entirely. The decrease in total 
surplus means that the market is inefficient.
Because rent control decreases the total surplus of the market, the policy generates 
a deadweight loss. In Figure 21.5, the deadweight loss is shown by the yellow triangle 
abc, the decrease in the total surplus of the market. This is a deadweight loss in the sense 
that it is not offset by a gain to anyone else. The consumers and producers who are 
excluded from the market by rent control lose the surpluses they could have received 
in the market. The loss of consumer surplus is shown by triangle cad, and the loss of 
producer surplus is shown by triangle dab. Adding these together, we get the dead-
weight loss shown by triangle abc.
Another way to see the inefficiency of rent control is to apply the principle of 
voluntary exchange.

As shown by the points between c and a on the demand curve, 300 consumers 
are willing to pay between $400 and $550 for an apartment. As shown by the points 
between points b and a on the supply curve, there are 300 producers who are willing to 
rent out an apartment for amounts between $300 and $400. Although the 300 excluded 
consumers are willing to pay more than these suppliers require to provide an apartment, 
the transactions are illegal under rent control. Because rent control outlaws transac-
tions that would make both parties better off, it causes inefficiency.
Three more subtle effects associated with rent control add to its inefficiency:
• Search costs. At the artificially low maximum price, the number of people seeking 
apartments exceeds the number of apartments available. Consumers will spend 
more time searching for apartments, so an additional cost of rent control is the 
opportunity cost of the extra time spent searching for apartments.
• Cheating. Because rent control outlaws mutually beneficial transactions, many 
people violate the spirit and the letter of the law by cheating. In some rent-
control cities, consumers pay extra money to property owners to outbid other 
consumers. These extra payments are often disguised as “nonrefundable secu-
rity deposits” or as “key money”—thousands of dollars to get the keys to an 
apartment.
• Decrease in quality of housing. Given the lower payoff from providing apartments 
for rent, property owners will have less incentive to spend money on repair and 
maintenance, so the quality of apartments will decrease. In other words, lower 
rent is offset in part by lower housing quality.

Is rent control good for the poor? Rent control specifies a maximum rent for an 
apartment, regardless of who lives there. Rent-controlled apartments are occupied 
by the rich and the poor, so many wealthy people benefit from rent control. In other 
words, rent control is ineffective in helping the poor. As we explain later in the book, 
the government could use other policies to more effectively improve the economic 
circumstances of the poor. 
Setting Minimum Prices
We’ve already seen two different effects of a minimum price, or price floor. In Chap-
ter 4 we saw that when the government sets a minimum price that exceeds the equi-
librium price, the result is permanent excess supply. The increase in price encourages 
producers to produce more and encourages consumers to buy less. So at the minimum 
price, there is excess supply because producers want to sell more than consumers 
want to buy. In this chapter, we saw from Panel A in Figure 21.4 that a minimum 
price decreases the total surplus of the market: Some producers gain at the expense 
of consumers, and the total surplus decreases.
Governments around the world establish minimum prices for agricultural goods. 
Under a price-support program, a government sets a minimum price for an agricultural 
product and then buys any resulting surpluses at that price. 
Controlling Quantities—Licensing and Import Restrictions
What happens when the government controls the quantity of a particular product 
instead of its price? We consider two policies that control quantities. In the domestic 
economy, many state and local governments limit the number of firms in particular 
markets by limiting the number of business licenses to operate in those markets. Many 
national governments restrict imports, using import bans or quotas on the quantity of 
a product—for example, shoes or cheese—that can be imported.
The licensing of business by state and local government is extensive. For example, 
many cities and states limit the number of taxicabs, dry cleaners, tobacco farms, liquor 
stores, bars, and even dog groomers. Some people defend licensing programs on the

Price Controls and the Shrinking Candy Bar
Applying the Concepts #3: How do price controls affect the market?
During World War II, the U.S. government used a system of price 
controls to set maximum prices on all sorts of products, including 
candy bars. Consumer Reports compared the weights of candy 
bars in 1943 to their weights in 1939, before the maximum prices 
were imposed. In 19 of 20 cases, the candy bars had shrunk, 
causing the price per ounce to increase by an average of 23 per-
cent. In other words, producers reacted to maximum prices by 
shrinking candy bars to match the relatively low maximum price. 
In the words of Consumer Reports, the shrinkage of candy bars is 
an example of “hidden price increases.”  Related to Exercise 3.6.

grounds that they protect consumers from low-quality products and poor service. 
But studies have shown that most licensing programs increase prices without improv-
ing the quality of products and service.2
Another motive for cities to issue licenses is to limit the number of establishments 
that could be considered nuisances to some citizens, for example, bars, convenience 
stores, and gas stations.
Taxi Medallions
We can use the licensing of taxis to explain how the practice affects the market for taxi 
service and other markets in which licenses are common. Panel A of Figure 21.6 shows 
the market equilibrium in the taxi market. The demand curve intersects the supply 
curve at point a. The industry provides 10,000 miles of taxi service per day at a price of 
$3 per mile. Each taxi is capable of producing a maximum of 100 miles of service per 
day, and there are 100 taxicabs in the market. The total surplus of the market equals 
the sum of consumer surplus and producer surplus, shown by the area between the 
demand curve and the supply curve.
Now suppose that the city passes a law requiring each taxicab to have a license—
also known as a taxi “medallion”—and limits the number of medallions to 80. The city 
then gives taxi medallions to the first 80 people who show up at city hall. In Panel B of 
Figure 21.6, the vertical line at 8,000 miles of service shows that this policy fixes the 
quantity of taxi service at 8,000 miles per day (80 taxis times 100 miles per taxi per day). 
The medallion policy creates an excess demand for taxi service: At the original price 
($3.00), the quantity demanded is 10,000 miles, but the city’s 80 taxicabs provide only 
8,000 miles of service. As a result, the market moves upward along the demand curve 
to point c, where the price is $3.60 per mile of service. The medallion policy increases 
the price and decreases the quantity of taxi services. 
▲  Figure 21.6  The Market Effects of Taxi Medallions
(A) The market equilibrium is shown by point a, with a price of $3.00 and a quantity of 10,000 miles of 
service per day (100 taxis and 100 miles per taxi). The total surplus is the area between the demand and 
supply curves. (B) A medallion policy reduces the quantity of taxi service to 8,000 miles per day (80 taxis 
and 100 miles per taxi) and increases the price to $3.60 (point c). The producers of the first 8,000 miles 
gain at the expense of consumers, but the surpluses for between 8,000 and 10,000 miles are lost 
entirely. Therefore, the total surplus decreases.

Licensing and Market Efficiency
The medallion policy decreases the total surplus of the taxi market. In Figure 21.6, 
we see that the total surplus in Panel B is less than the total surplus in Panel A. The 
medallion policy decreases consumer surplus, a result of the higher price and the 
smaller quantity supplied. Producer surplus could increase or decrease, depending on 
the shapes of the market supply and market demand curves. In this example, the pro-
ducer surplus of taxi drivers with medallions actually increases by a small amount. As 
in the cases of a maximum price or a minimum price, the medallion policy decreases 
the quantity of goods sold, decreasing the total surplus of the market. The producers 
of the first 8,000 miles of service gain at the expense of consumers, but the surpluses 
that could have been gained between 8,000 and 10,000 miles are lost entirely, so the 
total surplus of the market decreases. The deadweight loss is shown by the area of 
yellow triangle abc.
Another way to see the inefficiency of taxi medallions is to look at just the consum-
ers and producers who are excluded from the market and what they lose. Some of the 
excluded consumers would gladly pay the cost of providing taxi service. As shown by 
the points between points c and a on the demand curve, many consumers are willing 
to pay between $3.00 and $3.60 per mile for taxi service. Although there are plenty of 
drivers who would be willing to provide taxi service at these prices, they can’t do so 
without a medallion. Because the medallion policy prevents these riders and drivers 
from executing mutually beneficial transactions, the policy causes inefficiency.
Our analysis of taxi medallions applies to any market subject to quantity controls. 
State and city governments use licensing to limit many types of small businesses. When 
an establishment such as a convenience store or dry cleaner would cause a nuisance to its 
neighbors, the inefficiency of the sort shown in Figure 21.6 may be offset at least partly 
by the benefit of controlling nuisances. Of course, the alternative policy is to control 
the nuisance directly by restricting the location of the establishment rather than simply 
limiting the number of establishments. In general, a policy that limits entry into a market 
increases price, decreases quantity, and causes inefficiency in the market. In evaluating 
such a policy, we must compare the possible benefits from controlling nuisances to the 
losses of consumer and producer surplus. 
Winners and Losers from Licensing
Who benefits and who loses from licensing programs such as a taxi medallion policy? 
The losers are consumers, who pay more for taxi rides. The winners are the people who 
receive a free medallion and the right to charge an artificially high price for taxi service.
In some cities, people buy and sell taxi medallions. The market value of a medallion 
reflects the profits it can earn its owner. For example, the market price of a medallion 
is over $150,000 in New York City, $140,000 in Boston, and $100,000 in Toronto.3 
In cities such as Chicago, where medallions are more plentiful, the market price is 
much lower.
Why don’t governments simply eliminate the taxi medallion system and allow free 
entry into the taxi market? Because doing so would decrease the price of taxi service and 
reduce the market value of medallions to zero. Some city governments are reluctant to 
eliminate medallions because owners use their political power to keep the system (and 
the value of their medallions) in place. 
Import Restrictions
We’ve seen that the government can control the quantity of a good produced by issuing 
a limited number of business licenses to producers. Another way to control quantity is 
to limit the imports of a particular good. Like a licensing policy, an import restriction 
increases the market price and decreases the total surplus of the market.
To show the market effects of import restrictions, let’s start with an unrestricted 
market. Panel A of Figure 21.7 shows the market equilibrium in the sugar market 

part 8
474
when there is free trade. The domestic supply curve shows the quantity supplied by 
domestic (U.S.) firms at different prices. Looking at point m, we see that U.S. firms 
will not supply any sugar unless the price is at least $0.26 per pound. The total supply 
curve, which shows the quantity supplied by both domestic and foreign firms, lies to the 
right of the domestic curve. At each price, the total supply exceeds the domestic supply 
because foreign firms also supply sugar. Point a shows the free-trade equilibrium: The 
domestic demand curve (which shows the demand by U.S. consumers) intersects the 
total supply curve at a price of $0.12 per pound and a quantity of 360 million pounds 
per day. Because this price is below the minimum price for domestic firms, domestic 
firms do not supply any sugar to the U.S. market.
What would happen if the United States banned sugar imports? Foreign suppliers 
would disappear from the market, so the total supply of sugar would consist of only 
the domestic supply. In Panel B of Figure 21.7, the new equilibrium would be shown 
by point b: The demand curve would intersect the domestic supply curve at a price of 
$0.30 per pound and a quantity of 160 million pounds. The decrease in supply resulting 
from the import ban would increase the price and decrease the quantity. As a result, 
domestic firms would produce all the sugar for the domestic market.
The import ban would ultimately decrease the total surplus in the sugar market. 
The shaded areas in the two graphs show the consumer and producer surpluses that 
would result with and without free trade. The import ban decreases the U.S. con-
sumer surplus, as shown by the two blue triangles in the two graphs. The ban would 
also eliminate the producer surplus of foreign suppliers (shown by the red triangle in 
Panel A of Figure 21.7) and generate a producer surplus for domestic suppliers (shown 
by the red triangle in Panel B of Figure 21.7). Therefore, the import ban would cause 
domestic producers to gain at the expense of domestic consumers. Because consumers 
would lose more than domestic producers would gain, the import ban would cause a 
net loss for people in the United States.
▲  Figure 21.7  The Effects of an Import Ban on U.S. Prices and Consumer and Producer Surplus
(A) With free trade, the demand intersects the total supply curve at point a with a price of $0.12 and a quantity of 360 million pounds. This price is below 
the minimum price of domestic suppliers ($0.26, as shown by point m), so domestic firms do not participate in the market. The total surplus is shown 
by the shaded areas (U.S. consumer surplus and foreign producer surplus). (B) If sugar imports are banned, the equilibrium is shown by the intersection 
of the demand curve and the domestic (U.S.) supply curve (point b). The price increases to $0.30. Although the ban generates a producer surplus for 
domestic producers, their gain is less than the loss of domestic consumers.

Import restrictions are often defended on the grounds that they increase employ-
ment in the “protected” industries, such as apparel and steel. But the protection of 
these jobs increases consumer prices, so there is a trade-off: more jobs in the protected 
industry, but higher prices for consumers.4 According to one study, import restric-
tions in 1993 protected 56,464 jobs in the U.S. textile and apparel industries at a cost 
to consumers of about $178,000 per job and protected 3,419 jobs in the motor vehicle 
industry at a cost of about $271,000 per job. A study commissioned by the Swedish 
Ministry for Foreign Affairs concluded that import quotas imposed by the European 
Union (EU) increased the cost of clothing for the typical family in the EU by about 
270 euros per year. The quotas protected jobs in the domestic clothing industry, but 
the cost per job saved was about 41,000 euros per year. 
Who Really Pays Taxes?
In this part of the chapter, we look at the market effects of taxes and answer two 
important questions. First, who really bears the burden of a tax? As we’ll see, it is not 
necessarily the person who actually pays the tax to the government. Second, is the total 
burden of a tax equal to the revenue collected by the government? As we’ll see, a tax 
changes people’s behavior, so the total burden actually exceeds the revenue collected.
Tax Shifting: Forward and Backward
We can use supply and demand curves to look at the market effects of taxes. Suppose 
that your city imposes a tax of $100 per apartment and collects the tax from housing 
firms—the firms that own apartment buildings and rent out the apartments. You may 
think the burden of the tax falls exclusively on the housing firm because that’s who 
mails the check to the government. But some simple supply and demand analysis will 
show why this is incorrect. The housing firm will charge more for apartments and pay 
less for its inputs, such as labor and land, so the tax will actually be paid by consumers 
and input suppliers.
Figure 21.8 shows the market effects of a $100 tax on apartments. As we saw ear-
lier in the chapter, the market supply curve tells us how high the price must be to get

produced with soft lumber. These policies protect roughly 600 
jobs in the industry and impose a cost on consumers of roughly 
$632 million, so the cost per job protected is roughly $1 million 
per year.
A recent study estimates the consumer benefits of relax-
ing significant import restraints on a variety of products. The 
annual benefits would be $1.5 billion for ethanol, $49 million for 
sugar, $514 million for textiles and apparel, and $215 million for 
footwear and leather goods. The simultaneous liberalization of 
trade in all products would generate an annual benefit of $2.6  
billion.  Related to Exercise 4.5.

the softwood lumber industry? Softwood lumber is subject to

producers to supply a particular quantity of output. The price must be high enough 
to cover all the costs of production. A unit tax increases the cost of production, so we 
need a higher price to get firms to produce any given quantity. In other words, the 
supply curve shifts upward by the amount of the tax. A unit tax of $100 per apartment 
increases a property owner’s cost per apartment by $100, so the supply curve shifts 
upward by $100.
The shift of the supply curve increases the equilibrium price of apartments. At the 
$300 price, there will be an excess demand for apartments, and the price will increase to 
eliminate the excess demand. In Figure 21.8, the market moves from point a to point b: 
The demand curve intersects the new supply curve at a price of $360, compared to 
$300 before the tax. In other words, housing firms shift part of the tax forward onto 
consumers, who pay $60 of the $100 tax. Although housing firms pay the entire $100 
tax in a legal sense, they get some of the money to pay the tax by charging consumers 
$60 more for apartments.
The apartment tax also affects the people who supply inputs such as land and 
labor to the housing industry. The tax decreases the output of the industry, so the 
industry needs smaller quantities of the inputs used to produce apartments. The 
resulting excess supply of inputs like labor and land will decrease land and labor 
prices, decreasing the cost of producing apartments. As a result, part of the $100 tax 
gets shifted backward onto input suppliers. Although housing firms pay the apart-
ment tax in a legal sense, they get some of the money to pay the tax by paying less to 
workers and landowners. 
Tax Shifting and the Price Elasticity of Demand
The amount of the tax shifted forward to consumers depends on the price elasticity 
of demand for the taxed good. If the demand for a taxed good is inelastic—meaning 
that consumers are not very responsive to price changes—we need a large price hike to 
eliminate the excess demand caused by the tax. Therefore, consumers will be hit by a 
▲  Figure 21.8  The Market Effects of an Apartment Tax
A tax of $100 per apartment shifts the supply curve upward by the $100 tax, moving the market equi-
librium from point a to point b. The equilibrium price increases from $300 to $360, and the equilibrium 
quantity decreases from 900 to 750 apartments.

large increase in price, and so they will pay the bulk of the tax. This is shown in Panel 
A of Figure 21.9. Demand is inelastic—that is, the demand curve is steep—so a $5 tax 
increases the equilibrium price by $4 (from $10 to $14). In other words, consumers pay 
four-fifths of the tax. In Panel B of Figure 21.9, demand is elastic—that is, the demand 
curve is relatively flat—so consumers pay just a small part of the tax. A $5 tax increases 
the equilibrium price by only $1 (from $10 to $11). In this case, consumers pay only 
one-fifth of the tax.
▲  Figure 21.9  Elasticities of Demand and Tax Effects
If demand is inelastic (Panel A), a tax will increase the market price by a large amount, so consumers will 
bear a large share of the tax. If demand is elastic (Panel B), the price will increase by a small amount and 
consumers will bear a small share of the tax.

Why should we care about tax shifting? We’ve seen that a tax increases consumer 
prices and decreases input prices, so to determine who actually pays a tax, we must 
look beyond the actual taxpayer. As shown in the following application, the subtleties 
of tax shifting are often revealed by the objections of people who don’t actually pay a 
tax in a legal sense. 
Cigarette Taxes and Tobacco Land
In 1994, President Bill Clinton proposed an immediate $0.75 per pack increase in the 
cigarette tax. The tax had two purposes: to generate revenue for Clinton’s health-care 
reform plan and to decrease medical costs by discouraging smoking. Based on our 
discussion of the market effects of a tax, we would predict that the tax would be shared 
by consumers, who would pay higher prices, and the owners of land where tobacco is 
grown. It appears tobacco farmers and landowners understand the economics of ciga-
rette taxes. Led by a group of representatives and senators from tobacco-growing areas 
in North Carolina, Kentucky, and Virginia, Congress scaled back Clinton’s proposed 
tax hike from $0.75 to $0.05. Although the government would have collected the tax 
from cigarette manufacturers, savvy tobacco farmers realized the tax would decrease 
the price of their tobacco-growing land. 
The Luxury Boat Tax and Boat Workers
A lesson on backward shifting occurred when Congress passed a steep luxury tax on 
boats and other luxury goods in 1990. Under the new tax, a person buying a $300,000 
boat paid an additional $20,000 in taxes. The burden of the tax was actually shared 

part 8
478
by consumers and input suppliers, including people who worked in boat factories 
and boatyards. The tax increased the price of boats, and consumers bought fewer 
boats. The boat industry produced fewer boats, and the resulting decrease in the 
demand for boat workers led to layoffs and lower wages for those who managed to 
keep their jobs. Although the idea behind the luxury tax was to “soak the rich,” the 
tax actually harmed low-income workers in the boat industry. The tax was repealed 
a few years later. 
Tax Burden and Deadweight Loss
We’ve seen that people respond to a tax by changing their behavior. As a result, the 
total burden of a tax will exceed the total amount of money the government actu-
ally collects from the tax. To see why, suppose the government imposes a tax on no. 
3 pencils, and the tax is large enough that everyone who initially used no. 3 pencils 
switches to other types of pencils or other writing implements. If no one purchases no. 
3 pencils, the tax won’t raise any revenue for the government, but the tax still generates 
a burden because some people who would prefer to use no. 3 pencils have switched to 
other writing implements.
We’ll use the fish market to explore the total burden of a tax. To simplify matters, 
let’s assume that the supply curve for fish is horizontal, as shown in Figure 21.10. As 
we’ll see later in the book, a supply curve will be horizontal if the prices of the inputs 
used in the industry don’t change as the total output of the industry changes. For the 
fish market, this means that wages and the prices of bait and fuel don’t change as the 
total fish harvest changes. The demand curve intersects the initial supply curve at point 
a, so the price is $2 per pound and the quantity is 60,000 pounds of fish per day.
Suppose the government imposes a tax of $1 per pound of fish, and the tax is paid in 
legal terms by producers. As we saw earlier, a unit tax shifts the market supply upward 
▲  Figure 21.10  The Deadweight Loss or Excess Burden of a Tax
When the supply curve is horizontal, a tax increases the equilibrium price by the tax ($1 per pound in this 
example). Consumer surplus decreases by the areas B and C. Total tax revenue collected is shown by 
rectangle B, so the total burden exceeds tax revenue by triangle C. Triangle C is sometimes known as 
the deadweight loss or excess burden of the tax.

by the amount of the tax. As shown in Figure 21.10, a $1 tax on fish producers shifts 
the supply curve up by $1: Each firm now needs $3, not $2, to cover all of its costs, 
including the tax.
In Figure 21.10 the fish tax increases the equilibrium price of fish from $2 to $3. 
Why does the price increase by an amount equal to the tax? The supply curve is hori-
zontal because input prices are fixed, regardless of how much output is produced. There 
is no opportunity to shift the tax backward onto input suppliers, so consumers bear the 
full cost of the tax.
We can use the concept of consumer surplus to determine just how much consum-
ers lose as a result of the tax. Before the fish tax, the consumer surplus is shown by the 
area between the initial price line (and horizontal supply curve) and the demand curve, 
or areas A, B, and C. When the price increases to $3, the consumer surplus shrinks to 
the area of triangle A, so the loss of consumer surplus (the total burden of the tax) is 
shown by rectangle B and yellow triangle C. Let’s take a closer look at these two areas.
• Rectangle B shows the extra money consumers must pay for the 40,000 pounds 
of fish they purchase. The tax increases the price by $1 per pound, so consumers 
pay an extra $40,000.
• Triangle C shows the loss of consumer surplus on the fish that are not consumed 
because of the tax. Consumers obey the law of demand, so when the price rises, 
they cut their purchases, buying 20,000 fewer pounds of fish. As a result, they give 
up the consumer surplus they would have received on these 20,000 pounds of fish.
How does the total burden of the tax compare to the tax revenue raised by the 
government? The total tax revenue is the tax per pound ($1) times the quantity con-
sumed (40,000 pounds), or $40,000. This is shown by rectangle B: Part of the loss 
experienced by consumers is the revenue gain for government. But in addition to losing 
rectangle B, consumers also lose triangle C, so the consumer’s total burden of the tax 
exceeds the tax revenue. Triangle C is sometimes known as the deadweight loss from 
taxation or the excess burden of a tax.
In the example shown in Figure 21.10, we used a horizontal supply curve to sim-
plify matters and make the analysis of deadweight loss transparent. In a market with a 
positively sloped supply curve, a tax generates a deadweight loss, but the analysis is a 
bit more complex. For students interested in a challenge, one of the problems at the 
end of the chapter deals with deadweight loss for the apartment market, a market with 
a positively sloped supply curve.

Response to a Luxury Tax
Applying The concepts #5: How does a tax cut affect prices?
tax on a $300,000 boat increased by $20,000. The idea behind 
the tax was to collect more tax revenue from rich people who 
purchase luxury goods such as yachts. But in fact, the tax also 
affected low-income people who worked in boat factories and 
boat yards. The tax increased the price of boats, and con-
sumers bought fewer boats. The boat industry produced fewer 
boats, and the resulting decrease in the demand for boat work-
ers led to layoffs and lower wages for those who managed to 
keep their jobs. This illustrates the notion of tax shifting: In most 
cases, a tax is shifted forward to consumers and backward 
to input suppliers such as workers.   Related to Exercises 5.1 
and 5.5.

In this chapter, we discussed 
the efficiency of markets and 
the consequences of gov-
ernment intervention in per-
fectly competitive markets. 
In a market without external 
benefits or costs, govern-
ment intervention prevents 
consumers and producers from executing beneficial transactions 
and thus decreases the total surplus of the market. We also saw that 
taxes affect the prices of consumer goods and inputs. To determine 
who actually bears the cost of a tax, we must look beyond the tax-
payer. Here are the main points of the chapter:
1.	 The total surplus of a market equals the sum of consumer sur-
plus and producer surplus.
2.	 In a market that meets the four efficiency conditions (no external 
cost, no external benefit, perfect information, perfect competi-
tion), the market equilibrium maximizes the total surplus and is 
therefore efficient.
3.	 Price controls reduce the total surplus of a market because they 
prevent mutually beneficial transactions.
4.	 Quantity controls (such as licensing and import restrictions) 
decrease consumer surplus and the total surplus of the market.
5.	 A tax on a good may be shifted forward onto consumers and 
backward onto input suppliers.
6.	 Because a tax causes people to change their behavior, the 
total burden of the tax exceeds the revenue generated by 
the tax.

Controlling Prices—Maximum and Minimum Prices
Describe the market effects of price controls.
3.1	 Arrow up or down: In Figure 21.5 on page 470, 
rent control 
 the quantity of apartments, 
 producer surplus, 
 consumer 
surplus, and 
 the total market surplus.
3.2	 In Figure 21.5 on page 470, rent control prevents a 
total of 
 mutually beneficial transactions 
for consumers on the demand curve between points 
and producers on the supply curve between points 
 and 
.
3.3	 In Figure 21.5 on page 470, suppose rent control is 
partly relaxed, with the maximum price rising from 
$300 to $350. The quantity of apartments on the mar-
ket will increase from 
 to 
.
3.4	 In Figure 21.5 on page 470, a consumer who is on the 
demand curve halfway between points c and a would be 
willing to pay $
 above the controlled price 
to get an apartment. A producer who is on the supply 
curve halfway between points b and a would be willing 
to supply an apartment at a price of $
, or 
 above the maximum price.
3.5	 In Figure 21.10 on page 478, the triangle abc shows the 
deadweight loss, which is the 
 in the total 
 of the market.
3.6	 During World War II, candy producers reacted to 
 prices by 
 the weight of candy 
bars. (Related to Application 3 on page 471.)
3.7	 Excess Supply from a Minimum Bread Price. In the 
bread market, the quantity is 200 million units and the 
price is $3.00 per unit in equilibrium. The price elastic-
ity of demand is 0.50 and the price elasticity of supply 
is 1.50. Suppose the government imposes a minimum 
price of $3.50.
a.	 Draw a graph to show the market effects of the 
minimum price.
b.	At the minimum price, the quantity of bread sup-
plied is 
 million units, the quantity 
demanded is 
 million units, and the excess 
supply is 
 million units.
3.8	 No Deadweight Loss from Rent Control? Like other 
fruit flies, Frudo has an expected lifespan of 37 days. 
According to Frudo, “If my assumptions are correct, a 
rent-control law implemented today will simply redistrib-
ute income from property owners to consumers. There 
will be no deadweight loss, at least not in my lifetime.”
a.	 What is Frudo’s key assumption?
b.	Draw a complete graph to show his assumption and 
logic.
c.	 The typical elephant has an expected lifespan of 
60 years. How would its analysis of rent control dif-
fer from Frudo’s? Illustrate with a complete graph.
3.9	
Price Controls for Medical Care. Consider a town where 
the equilibrium price of a doctor’s visit is $60 and the equi-
librium quantity supplied is 90 patient visits per hour. For 
suppliers (doctors), each $1 increase in price increases the 
quantity supplied by two visits. For consumers, each $1 
increase in price decreases the quantity demanded by one 
visit. Suppose that in an attempt to control the rising costs 
of medical care the government imposes price controls, 
setting a maximum price of $50 per visit.
a.	 Use a completely labeled graph to show the effects 
of the maximum price on (a) the quantity of visits to 
doctors and (b) the total surplus of the market.

482
b.	What sort of inefficiencies does the price control 
cause?
c.	 Would you expect patients and doctors to find ways 
around the maximum price?
3.10	Sugar Price Controls. The equilibrium price of 
sugar is $8, and the equilibrium quantity is 300 mil-
lion tons per month. Suppose the government sets a 
maximum price of $7.50. For producers, each $0.01 
increase in price increases the quantity supplied by 8 
million tons.
a.	 Draw a graph to show the effects of the maximum 
price on the sugar market. Label the initial equilib-
rium point as a and the point that shows the quantity 
supplied under the maximum price as b.
b.	How does the maximum price affect the quantity of 
sugar sold?
3.11	Maximum Rent on Land. Consider a state where 
all land is occupied by mobile-home parks, and 
each household rents one padacre (a standard pad 
for a mobile home). In the market equilibrium, the 
rent is $200 per padacre. Suppose the government 
sets a maximum rent of $150 per padacre, regard-
less of how the land is used. Recall the old saying 
“The trouble with land is that they’re not making it 
anymore.”
a.	 Use a supply and demand graph to depict the market 
with the maximum rent.
b.	Does the rent maximum affect the equilibrium 
quantity of land?
c.	 Does the rent maximum generate a deadweight loss? 
If not, why not?
3.12	 Supply Elasticity and Deadweight Loss. Consider 
the following statement: As the price elasticity of sup-
ply increases, the deadweight loss from a maximum 
price changes.
a.	 Draw two sets of supply and demand curves, one 
with a more elastic supply curve.
b.	In the case of more elastic supply, is the deadweight 
loss larger or smaller?
Controlling Quantities—Licensing and Import 
Restrictions
Describe the market effects of quantity controls.
4.1	 In Figure 21.6 on page 472, the taxi medallion policy 
prevents mutually beneficial transactions for consum-
ers on the demand curve between points 
 
and 
 and producers on the supply curve 
between points 
 and 
.
4.2	 In Figure 21.6 on page 472, a consumer who is on the 
demand curve halfway between points c and a would 
be willing to pay $
 for a mile of taxi service, 
while a supplier who is halfway between points b and a 
on the supply curve would be willing to supply a mile 
of taxi service at a price of $
.
4.3	 In Figure 21.7 on page 474, domestic firms will produce 
 tons of sugar at a price of $0.15, 
 
tons at a price of $0.30, and 
 tons at a price 
of $0.28.
4.4	 Arrow up or down: An import ban 
 the 
price of sugar, 
 the total (market) quantity 
of sugar, and 
 the quantity of sugar produced 
by domestic firms.
4.5	 A recent study estimates that simultaneous liberaliza-
tion of trade in all products would generate an annual 
benefit of 
. (Related to Application 4 on 
page 475.)
4.6	 Compute the Changes. Consider the example of taxi 
medallions shown in Figure 21.6 on page 472.
a.	 The policy changes consumer surplus from 
$
 to $
.
b.	The policy changes producer surplus from 
$
 to $
.
c.	 The policy changes the total surplus of the market 
from $
 to $
.
d.	The deadweight loss is shown by the area of triangle 
, which equals $
.
4.7	 Effects of Tightening the Medallion Policy. 
Consider the example of taxi medallions shown in 
­Figure 21.6 on page 472. Suppose the government 
tightens the policy, decreasing the number of medal-
lions from 80 to 70.
a.	 The price of taxi service will change from 
$
 to $
.
b.	The miles of taxi service will change from 
 
miles to 
 miles.
c.	 At the margin an excluded customer would be 
willing to pay up to $
 for a mile of taxi 
­service, while an excluded supplier would be willing 
to supply a mile of taxi service at a price as low as

, and the 
equilibrium quantity is

483
b.	On your graph, show the total surplus of the liver 
market—the sum of consumer and producer surplus.
c.	 Suppose the government bans the buying and selling 
of livers. On your graph, show the new equilibrium 
quantity of livers and the resulting loss in the total 
value of the market.
4.9	 Barber Licensing. Consider the market for haircuts 
in a city. In the market equilibrium, the price per hair-
cut is $6 and the quantity is 240 haircuts per day. For 
consumers, each $1 increase in price decreases the 
quantity demanded by 20 haircuts. For producers, each 
$1 increase in price increases the quantity supplied 
by 60 haircuts. In the market equilibrium, there are 
24 barbers, each of whom produces 10 haircuts per day. 
Suppose the city passes a law requiring all barbers to 
have a license and then issues only 18 barber licenses. 
Each licensed barber continues to provide 10 haircuts 
per day. Use a completely labeled graph to show the 
effects of licensing on (a) the price of haircuts and (b) 
the total surplus in the haircut market.
4.10	 Bidding for a Boston Taxi Medallion. In 1997, there 
were 1,500 taxi medallions in the city of Boston, and 
each medallion generated a profit of about $14,000 per 
year. In 1998, the city announced that it would issue 
300 new taxi medallions, auctioning the new medal-
lions to the highest bidders.5 Even with the new medal-
lions, the number of taxis in the city would still be less 
than the number that would occur in an unregulated 
market. Your job is to predict the annual profit from 
a medallion after the new medallions were issued. To 
predict the new annual profit, assume the following:
• The cost of providing taxi service is constant at 
$2.00 per mile of service.
• The initial price of taxi service (with 1,500 medal-
lions issued) is $2.14 per mile.
• Each taxi (or medallion) provides 100,000 miles of 
service per year, so issuing the 300 new medallions 
increases the total quantity of taxi service from 
150 million miles to 180 million miles.
• The slope of the demand curve is -$0.001 per mil-
lion miles: For each $0.001 decrease in the price 
of taxi service, the quantity demanded increases by 
one million miles.
a.	 Compute the new price of taxi service.
b.	Compute the new profit per medallion.
4.11	 Eliminate the Mango Market? Draw a supply and 
demand graph depicting a situation in which banning 
mango imports drives the quantity of mangos sold to 
zero.
4.12	 Import Ban for Kiwi Fruit. Initially, there are no 
restrictions on importing kiwi fruit. The minimum 
supply price of domestic producers is $0.26, while the 
minimum supply price of foreign suppliers is $0.08. 
Each supply curve is linear, with a slope of $0.01 per 
million pounds. In the initial equilibrium, the price 
is $0.18 and the quantity is 10 million pounds. The 
demand curve has a vertical intercept of $0.38 and a 
slope of -$0.02 per million pounds.
a.	 Draw a graph showing the initial equilibrium.
b.	Suppose imports are banned, raising the price to 
$0.30. Draw a graph to show the new equilibrium 
and identify the new equilibrium quantity.
c.	 Compute the consumer surplus before the import 
ban and after the ban.
d.	Suppose the import ban protects 10 jobs in the kiwi 
fruit industry. What is the cost to consumers for 
each job protected?
Who Really Pays Taxes?
Explain how a tax is shifted to consumers and input suppliers.
5.1	 The 1990 tax on yachts and other luxury goods 
was shifted forward to 
 and backward to 
. (Related to Application 5 on page 479.)
5.2	 A tax paid in legal terms by producers will be partly 
shifted forward onto 
 and partly shifted 
backward onto 
.
5.3	 Arrow up or down: As the price elasticity of demand 
increases, the size of the price increase resulting from 
a tax 
 and the share of the tax borne by con-
sumers 
.
5.4	 The demand for coffee is relatively inelastic. There-
fore, we would expect 
 to pay a relatively 
large share of a tax on coffee.
5.5	 The Employment and Wage Effects of a Luxury 
Boat Tax. Suppose the luxury boat industry initially 
employs 100 workers and produces 50 boats per month. 
Suppose a tax on luxury boats increases the equilibrium 
price from $300,000 to $320,000. The price elasticity 
of demand for luxury boats is 2.0. (Related to Applica-
tion 5 on page 479.)
a.	 The luxury tax increases the equilibrium price of 
boats by 
 percent, so it decreases the quan-
tity of boats demanded from 50 to 
. If 
builders continue to employ 10 workers for each boat, 
the number of boat workers decreases from 100 to 
.
b.	Suppose the workers in the industry respond to the 
luxury boat tax by agreeing to take a wage cut that 
decreases the cost of producing boats by 10 percent. 
In addition, suppose firms pass on the savings in 
labor costs to boat consumers. The wage reduction 
decreases the price of boats by _________ percent 
and increases the quantity of boats demanded from 
_________ to _________. If builders continue to 
employ 10 workers for each boat, the number of 
boat workers is  _________.

484
5.6	 Cutting the Hotel Tax. Suppose your city initially 
has a $20-per-night tax on hotel rooms, paid in a legal 
sense by the hotel. Under the tax, the equilibrium price 
of hotel rooms is $80 per night.
a.	 Draw a supply and demand graph to show the effects 
of eliminating the tax.
b.	How does the elimination of the tax affect the equi-
librium price of hotel rooms?
c.	 How does the elimination of the tax affect the wages 
of hotel workers?
d.	Is the change in the price greater than, less than, or 
equal to $20? Why?
5.7	 Shifting a Housecleaning Tax. Consider a city where 
poor people clean the houses of rich people. Initially, 
housecleaning firms charge their customers $10 per 
hour, keep $1 per hour for administrative costs, and 
pay their workers $9 per hour. Like many luxury goods, 
the demand for housecleaning service is very elastic. 
Housecleaning workers are not very responsive to 
changes in the wage.
a.	 Use supply and demand curves to show the initial 
equilibrium in the market for cleaning services 
(price = $10 per hour; quantity = 1,000 hours of 
cleaning per week), and label the equilibrium as 
point a.
b.	Suppose the city imposes a tax of $3 per hour on 
cleaning services, and one-third of the tax is shifted 
forward to consumers. Use your graph to show the 
effects of the tax on the housecleaning market. Label 
the new equilibrium as point b. What is the new 
price?
c.	 Is it reasonable that only one-third of the tax is 
shifted forward? Explain.
d.	Suppose that firms continue to keep $1 per hour for 
administrative costs. Predict the new wage.
e.	Who bears the bulk of the housecleaning tax, 
wealthy households or poor ones?
5.8	 Effects of a Higher Fish Tax. In Figure 21.10 on 
page 478, suppose the fish tax is $2 per pound of fish 
instead of $1. Draw a graph to show the effect of the 
$2 tax. In the new equilibrium, the price is $ _________, 
the quantity is _________, and the deadweight loss 
from the tax is $ _________.
5.9	 Tax Eliminates a Market? Use a supply and demand 
graph to show a situation in which a tax on no. 3 pencils 
reduces the equilibrium quantity of no. 3 pencils to 
zero.
Government Intervention
Recall the market equilibrium experiment from Chapter 4. 
We can modify that experiment to show the various forms of 
government intervention in the market. After several trad-
ing periods without any government intervention, you can 
change the rules as follows:
• The instructor sets a maximum price for apples.
• The instructor sets a minimum price for apples.
Econo m ic Expe rim ent
• The instructor issues licenses to a few lucky producers.
• The instructor divides producers into domestic produc-
ers and foreign producers, and some of the foreign pro-
ducers are excluded from the market.

Consumer choice often involves 
a battle between instant and 
delayed gratification. For 
­example, a consumer might 
choose between a donut, with 
its ­immediate taste and sugar 
­sensations, and an apple, with its 
contribution to future health.
In fact, the very act of consumption involves a choice of spending money now rather than saving for the future. The 
outcome of the battle between instant and delayed gratification is determined by a person’s self-control.
Scientists have been exploring the mental processes involved in self-control. One line of inquiry led to the fol-
lowing question: Why do societies have curse words that everyone knows but no one is supposed to use? One 
possibility is that suppressing the urge to use a curse word strengthens our self-control systems in the same way 
that calisthenics like jumping jacks strengthen our muscles. Calisthenics are not useful by themselves, but they build 
up our muscles for tasks that really matter. Perhaps resisting the urge to curse builds up our willpower to help resist 
the urge to eat unhealthy food, smoke tobacco, and go into debt.
A number of experiments have shown that seemingly trivial exercises improve self-control. In one experiment, sub-
jects were told to improve their posture, sitting up straight rather than slouching. After 2 weeks of resisting the urge to 
slouch, the subjects performed much better on tasks that required self-control. By overriding their habit of slouching, 
the subjects boosted their willpower and stamina in tasks that had nothing to do with posture. Similar improvements 
in self-control occurred for right-handed subjects who switched to the left hand to perform everyday tasks.1

I
n Chapter 4, we introduced the law of demand, which is shown graphically by a 
negatively sloped demand curve. In this chapter, we use the theory of consumer 
choice to provide the economic logic behind the law of demand. The theory is based 
on the notion that consumers maximize their level of satisfaction, or utility, given the 
constraints dictated by their income and the prices of consumer goods. As we’ll see, 
every point on a demand curve represents the best affordable choice for a consumer 
at a particular price.
The first two parts of this chapter use traditional utility theory to explore consumer 
decision making. Under the utilitarian framework developed by Jeremy Bentham and 
John Stuart Mill in the eighteenth century, every action generates a benefit (“pleasure” 
to the utilitarians) and a cost (“pain” to the utilitarians), and taking an action is sensible 
if the benefit exceeds the cost. Applying the marginal principle to the consumer choice 
problem, a consumer will buy a product if the marginal benefit exceeds the marginal 
cost. We use this utilitarian logic to explain the law of demand and the negatively 
sloped demand curve.
The first two parts of the chapter provide a self-contained treatment of traditional 
consumer choice and demand theory. So it is possible to stop at the end of the second 
part and still get a thorough understanding of consumer decision making and the law 
of demand. In other words, the third and fourth parts of the chapter can be skipped 
without loss of continuity.
The third part of the chapter introduces recent advances in neuroscience that are 
relevant to consumer decision making. In the last few decades, neuroscientists have 
explored the brain activity associated with making decisions, and can now map and 
measure the neural activity involved in consumer choice. Specifically, neuroscientists 
observe neural activity representing both the benefit and the cost of consuming a prod-
uct. Based on the observed neural activity, neuroscientists can predict consumer choice: 
if the benefit activity is stronger than the cost activity, a consumer is likely to buy the 
product. In other words, the utilitarians got it right: consumers base their decisions 
on the benefits and costs of a particular product. And the utilitarians were correct in 
imagining that some day it would be possible to actually measure the utility associated 
with consuming a product.
The fourth part of the chapter integrates some insights from neuroscience into our 
model of consumer choice. We can use the integrated model to address the following 
questions.
• Why do consumers eat unhealthy food? Why so many donuts and so few apples?
• Why do people save so little money for the future?
• Why do most people who want to quit smoking fail in their efforts to quit?
• Why do people play lotteries when the typical player pays $10 to get an average 
payoff of about $5?
The lessons from neuroscience help explain puzzling consumer behavior. In addition, 
we can use the insights from neuroscience to identify strategies to change consumer 
behavior—to eat fewer donuts, to save more money, and to quit smoking.
Traditional Consumer Choice: Utility Theory
Consider a consumer who has a fixed budget to spend on movies (m) and books (b). 
The consumer’s objective is to maximize its level of utility (satisfaction), subject to 
its budget constraint. In other words, the consumer wants to find the best affordable 
bundle of movies and books.
Consumer Constraints: The Budget Line
A consumer’s ability to purchase movies and other goods is limited by her income and 
the prices of movies and other products. Suppose the consumer has a fixed income of 
Learning Objective 22.1

apply it to consumer choice.

Chapter 22 • Consumer Choice: Utility Theory and Insights from Neuroscience

$27 per month, which she spends entirely on movies and books. The price of movies 
is $3 and the price of books is $1.
A consumer’s budget line shows all the combinations of two goods that exhaust 
the budget. In Figure 22.1, if the consumer spends her entire $27 budget on books, she 
gets 27 books and no movies (point r). At the other extreme, she can spend her entire 
budget on movies, getting nine movies at a price of $3 per movie (point v). The points 
between these two extremes are possible too. For example, she could reach point s (one 
movie and 24 books) by spending $3 on movies and $24 on books, or point u (six movies 
and nine books) by spending $18 on movies and $9 on books.
▲  Figure 22.1  Budget Set and Budget Line
The budget set (the shaded triangle) shows all the affordable combinations of books and movies, and

The slope of the budget line is the opportunity cost of a movie in terms of books. 
Mathematically, the slope is the ratio of the price of the good shown on the horizontal 
axis (movies, with a price of $3), to the price of the good shown on the vertical axis 
(books, with a price of $1). In this example, the slope is three books per movie: a movie 
is three times as expensive as a book, so the opportunity cost of a movie is the three 
books that could be purchased instead.
A consumer’s budget set is the set of affordable combinations of two goods. The 
budget set includes the budget line—combinations that exhaust the budget—as well 
as combinations that cost less than the consumer has to spend, leaving the consumer 
with leftover money. In Figure 22.1, the consumer’s budget set is shown as a shaded 
triangle. She can afford any combination on or below the budget line, but cannot afford 
combinations above it.
It’s important to distinguish the budget line from a demand curve. Although the 
budget line may look similar to a consumer’s demand curve, they are very different 
graphical tools. The budget line shows the different combinations of two goods that a 
consumer can buy. In contrast, the demand curve shows the quantity of a single good 
that a consumer is willing to buy at different prices.

The shapes of the utility curves reflect the law of diminishing marginal utility. The 
basic idea is that the first unit of a product generates more additional satisfaction or 
utility than the second unit, which generates more additional utility than the third, and 
so on. In graphical terms, this means that as the number of movies increases, the total 
utility curve becomes progressively flatter: the slope of the total utility curve decreases. 
The marginal utility curve shows the slope of the total utility curve, so by the law of 
diminishing marginal utility, it is negatively sloped.
Total and Marginal Utility
The consumer’s objective is to maximize its utility. The upper panel of Figure 22.2 
shows the relationship between the number of movies watched and the total utility 
from movies. As the number of movies increases, total utility increases. The utility 
from five movies (point a) is 225 utils and the utility from six movies (point b) is 261 
utils, so the marginal utility of the sixth movie is 36 utils (261–225). This is shown in 
the lower panel of Figure 22.1 by point e, where the marginal utility of the sixth movie 
is 36 utils. As the number of movies increases, utility increases, but at a decreasing rate. 
The utility from nine movies (point d, 351 utils) is 27 utils greater than the utility from 
eight movies (point c, 324 utils). This is shown in the lower panel by point f, where 
the marginal utility of the ninth movie is 27 utils. As the number of movies increases, 
utility will continue to increase, but at a decreasing rate.

The Marginal Principle and the Equimarginal Rule
Consider a consumer who has a fixed budget to spend on movies (m) and books (b). We 
can use the marginal principle to model the consumer’s decision about how to allocate 
the budget between the two products.
It will be useful to derive one more utility curve. In Figure 22.3, the upper curve is 
the familiar marginal-utility curve, with a marginal utility of 36 utils for the sixth movie, 
compared to 27 utils for the ninth movie. The lower curve shows the marginal utility 
per dollar on movies, assuming that the price of movies is $3. For the 6th movie, the 
marginal utility per dollar spent on movies is 12 utils (36 utils/$3). At the margin, each 
dollar spent on movies (each dollar spent on the 6th movie) increases the consumer’s 
utility by 12 utils. In popular language, this is the marginal bang per buck spent on mov-
ies: the increase in consumer utility (bang) per dollar (buck). As shown by point d, the 
marginal utility per dollar spent on the ninth movie is 9 utils (27 utils/$3). The marginal 
bang per buck decreases from 12 utils for the sixth movie to 9 utils for the ninth movie, 
reflecting the law of diminishing marginal utility.

The marginal utility of movies decreases as the number of movies increases, reflecting the assumption of

Increase the level of an activity as long as its marginal benefit 
exceeds its marginal cost. Choose the level at which the marginal 
benefit equals the marginal cost.
To maximize utility, a consumer picks the quantity of a product at which the mar-
ginal benefit of the product equals its marginal cost. For a movie, the benefit is the 
utility generated by the movie, so the marginal benefit is simply the marginal utility 
of a movie.

For a consumer who buys movies and books, the opportunity cost of a movie is the util-
ity sacrificed by getting one movie rather than some number of books. The number of 
books sacrificed per movie is determined by the prices of the two goods. The number 
of books sacrificed per movie equals the price of movies divided by the price of books:
Books per Movie -
pm
pb
For example, if pm = 3 and pb = 1, movies are three times as expensive as books, so 
the consumer sacrifices three books per movie. In utility terms, the marginal cost of 
a movie (the utility lost from getting one movie rather than some number of books) 
equals the number of books sacrificed times the marginal utility of books (the utility 
lost per book):
MC (movie) -
pm
pb
MUb
For example, if the price ratio is 3 and the marginal utility of a book is 12 utils, the 
marginal cost of a movie is three books sacrificed per movie times the 12 utils lost per 
book not purchased, or 36 utils.
To satisfy the marginal principle, the marginal benefit of movies equals the mar-
ginal cost. Using the expressions for the marginal benefit and the marginal cost of 
movies, the marginal benefit equals the marginal cost if

We can rewrite this in a more convenient way. If we divide both sides of the equation 
by pm we get

To satisfy the marginal principle, a consumer chooses the quantities of movies and 
books such that the marginal utility per dollar spent on movies equals the marginal 
utility per dollar spent on books. This is the equimarginal rule:
The law of diminishing returns tells us that the marginal benefit decreases as the num-
ber of movies increases.
Consider next the cost associated with consuming a product. To compute the 
marginal cost of a movie, we use the principle of opportunity cost.

Pick the combination of two activities where the marginal benefit per 
dollar for the first activity equals the marginal benefit per dollar for 
the second activity.
In other words, the consumer chooses the quantities of movies and books such that 
the two products have the marginal bang per buck (the same marginal utility per 
dollar).

1	 Equimarginal rule. For each good, the marginal utility per dollar is 12 utils.
2	 Affordability. The consumer spends $18 on movies ($3 * 6 movies) and $9 
on books ($1 * 9 books), for a total of $27. This corresponds to point u in 
Figure 22.1.
The bundle is affordable and satisfies the equimarginal rule, so it generates the highest 
affordable utility level.
We can illustrate the logic of the equimarginal rule by showing what happens 
when it is violated. Consider another bundle, the one shown by points c (fewer than six 
movies), and d (more than nine books). This bundle does not satisfy the equimarginal 
rule: the marginal utility per dollar for movies (greater than 12 utils per dollar) exceeds 
the marginal utility per dollar for books (less than 12 utils per dollar). For one dollar 
switched from books to movies, the gain in movie utility (the marginal utility per dollar 
Conditions for Utility Maximization
The consumer’s objective is to maximize the utility generated by a fixed budget. Utility 
is maximized when the chosen bundle of goods satisfies two conditions.
1	 Equimarginal rule. The equimarginal rule is satisfied: the marginal utility per dollar 
on movies equals the marginal utility per dollar on books.
2	 Affordability. The money spent on the two goods adds up to the fixed budget for 
the two goods: the chosen bundle is just affordable, meaning that it is on the 
budget line.
To summarize, the consumer chooses the affordable bundle that satisfies the equimar-
ginal rule.
Figure 22.4 illustrates utility maximization for a consumer with a budget of $27 
for movies and books. The left panel shows the marginal utility per dollar on movies, 
assuming a movie price of $3. The right panel shows the marginal utility per dollar on 
books, assuming a book price of $1. Points a and b show the utility-maximizing bundle 
of six movies and nine books.
▲  Figure 22.4  The Equimarginal Rule: Equalize the Marginal Benefit per Dollar
The consumer picks the affordable bundle at which the marginal utility per dollar on movies equals the 
marginal utility per dollar on books. This is shown by point a (six movies) and point b (nine books). Start-
ing from any other affordable combination, the consumer can do better by reallocating the budget in 
favor of the good with the larger marginal utility per dollar. For example, starting from points c and d, 
movies have a larger marginal utility per dollar, so the consumer can increase utility by choosing more 
movies and fewer books.

The last three columns of Table 22.1 show that utility is maximized when the 
equimarginal rule is satisfied. In column 7, the utility from movies increases from 
51 utils for one movie to 99 utils for two movies (51 from the first movie + 48 from 
the second movie), to 144 for three movies (51 + 48 + 45), and so on. To com-
pute the numbers in Column 8, we work from the bottom up. From the bottom of 
Column 2, for the first three books, the marginal utility per book is 16 utils, so the 
utility from the first three books is 48 utils. Working upward, the additional util-
ity from the next trio of books is 42 (equal to 14 utils per book times three books), 
so the utility from six books is 90 utils (48 + 42). Continuing to move upward in 
Column 8, the utility from books increases to 126 utils for nine books, 156 for 
12 books, and so on. Column 9 shows total utility, the sum of utility from mov-
ies and books. Moving down through the column, total utility increases from 267 
(equal to 51 + 216), to 309, and so on until we reach a total of 387 utils with the 
bundle of six movies and nine books. Beyond that point, total utility decreases. As 
shown by the bold numbers in the row associated with six movies and nine books, 
utility is maximized when the equimarginal rule is satisfied: the marginal utility per 
dollar of movies (12 utils = 36 utils/$3) equals the marginal utility per dollar of 
books (12 utils = 12 utils/$1). 
of movies) exceeds the loss in book utility (the marginal utility per dollar of books), so 
the consumer’s utility increases. Starting from points c and d, a consumer can do bet-
ter by spending more on movies, the product with the larger marginal bang per buck. 
In general, whenever the equimarginal rule is violated—whenever the marginal utility 
per dollar of one good exceeds the marginal utility per dollar on a second good—the 
consumer can increase utility by shifting the budget in favor of the good with the larger 
marginal bang per buck.
Table 22.1 provides a detailed view of the utility-maximization process. The first 
two columns show the affordable bundles of movies and books, that is, the bundles on 
the consumer’s budget line shown in Figure 22.1. Columns 3 and 4 show the marginal 
utility numbers for movies and books. Moving down through the table, the number 
of movies increases and, consistent with the law of diminishing marginal utility, the 
marginal utility of movies decreases, from 51 utils for the first movie to 48 utils for the 
second movie, and so on. As we move down through the table, the number of affordable 
books decreases, so the marginal utility of books increases, from 2 utils for the 24th 
book, to 4 utils for the 21st book, and so on. Columns 5 and 6 show the numbers for 
the marginal utility per dollar for movies and books, assuming a movie price of $3 and 
a book price of $1. As we move down through the table, the marginal bang per buck 
of movies decreases, from 17 utils to 16 utils, and so on, while the marginal bang per 
buck of books increases, from 2 utils to 4 utils, and so on.

The Law of Demand and the Individual Demand Curve
We can use our model of consumer choice to demonstrate the law of demand and 
derive an individual demand curve. In addition, we can decompose the effect of a 
change in price into two effects: the substitution effect and the income effect.
Effect of a Decrease in Price
Suppose the price of movies decreases from $3 to $2. In the left panel of Figure 22.5, the 
curve shifts upward: a decrease in price increases the marginal utility per dollar of mov-
ies. In other words, the lower the price of movies, the larger the marginal bang per buck 
for movies. For the original choice of six movies, the marginal bang per buck increases 
from 12 utils (36 utils/$3, shown by point a) to 18 utils (36 utils/$2, shown by point c).
The decrease in the price of movies means that the original bundle violates the 
equimarginal rule. As shown by points c and b, the marginal utility per dollar on mov-
ies (18 utils) now exceeds the marginal utility per dollar on books (12 utils). Given the 
larger marginal bang per buck for movies, the rational consumer will reallocate the 
budget in favor of movies. In other words, a decrease in the price of movies increases 
the quantity of movies demanded: the consumer obeys the law of demand.
How far will the consumer go in response to a decrease in the price of movies? 
In Figure 22.6, the consumer chooses points d and e, with 10 movies and seven books. 
This bundle satisfies the two conditions for utility maximization.
1	 Equimarginal rule. For each good, the marginal utility per dollar is 14 utils.
2	 Affordability. The consumer spends $20 on movies ($2 * 10 movies) and $7 on 
books, for a total of $27.
In this case, a decrease in the movie price from $3 to $2 increases the quantity of movies 
demanded from 6 to 10, consistent with the law of demand.
The same logic applies, in reverse, to an increase in the price of movies. An increase 
in price decreases the marginal utility per dollar on movies, shifting the marginal-
bang-per-buck curve downward. At the original bundle of six movies and nine books, 
the marginal bang per buck of movies will be less than the marginal bang per buck 
of books (12 utils). The consumer will respond by reallocating the budget away from 
movies, consistent with the law of demand: An increase in price decreases the quantity 
of movies demanded.

rewards, and observed the neural activity in a subject’s stria-
tum, the region of the brain responsible for the valuation of 
rewards. As the monetary reward increased, the subjective ben-
efit (the utility value, as measured in neuron activity) increased, 
but at a decreasing rate. In other words, the larger the reward, 
the lower the marginal utility of the reward money. For example, 
starting with a $15 reward, the marginal utility was 1 util per 
dollar, but starting with a $150 reward, the marginal utility was 
only 0.25 utils per dollar. Although this experiment does not 
provide a direct demonstration of the law of diminishing mar-
ginal utility for a particular product, it does show that general 
rewards are subject to diminishing marginal utility.  Related to

Income and Substitution Effects of a Decrease in Price
We’ve seen that a decrease in price increases the quantity of movies demanded. We 
can break down the increase in the quantity demanded into two separate effects. The 
first is the substitution effect.
▲  Figure 22.5  A Decrease in the Price of Movies Increases the Utility-Maximizing 
Number of Movies
A decrease in the price of movies shifts the movie benefit curve (MU per dollar of movies) upward. At the 
original bundle (six movies and nine books), the MU per dollar of movies (18 utils at point c) exceeds the 
MU per dollar of books (12 utils at point b), so the consumer increases the number of movies.

• Substitution effect. A decrease in the price of movies decreases the price of 
movies relative to the price of books, causing the consumer to substitute movies 
for books.
We can show the substitution effect with a simple thought experiment. Suppose that 
when the price of movies decreases from $3 to $2, we decrease the consumer’s nominal 
income from $27 to $21. In other words, the consumer’s nominal income drops by $6, 
leaving just enough money to afford the original bundle of six movies (a cost of $12) 
and nine books (a cost of $9). The price reduction is exactly offset by the $6 decrease 
in nominal income, meaning that the consumer’s real income hasn’t changed.
If the original bundle of movies and books is just affordable at the lower price, will 
the consumer choose it? As shown by points c and b in Figure 22.6, the still-affordable 
original bundle of six movies and nine books violates the equimarginal rule: the mar-
ginal bang per buck of movies is 18 utils, compared to 12 utils for books. The consumer 
will reallocate the $21 budget in favor of movies. The new movie price is twice the book 
price, so for each additional movie, the consumer sacrifices two books. In Figure 22.6, 
the consumer moves downward along the movie curve, starting from point c, and moves 
upward along the book curve, starting from point b.
The consumer will continue to shift money toward movies at a 2:1 rate until the 
equimarginal rule is satisfied. In Figure 22.6, this happens at point s for movies and 
point t for books, with a marginal utility per dollar of 16 utils for both movies and 
books. In the movie panel, the move from point c to point s is the substitution effect 
of the decrease in price. Holding the consumer’s real income constant (by cutting 
the nominal income to make the original bundle just affordable), movie consumption 
increases from six to eight movies.
The substitution effect is not the end of the consumer response to a decrease in 
price. The second response is the income effect.
• Income effect. A decrease in the price of movies increases the consumer’s real 
income (purchasing power), and the consumer will buy more of all “normal” 
goods, including movies.
Recall that our thought experiment for the substitution effect cut nominal income by 
$6 to keep real income constant. To show the income effect of a decrease in price, we 
simply undo the $6 cut in nominal income. In other words, we give back the $6 and 
see how the consumer responds to the additional income.
The consumer will use the equimarginal rule to allocate the additional income. For 
each additional dollar, the consumer will spend the dollar on the good with the larger 
marginal utility per dollar. When the additional income is all spent, the marginal utility 
per dollar on movies will equal the marginal utility per dollar on books. In Figure 22.6, 
the consumer moves downward along the movie curve starting from point s, and moves 
downward along the book curve starting from point t. The movement downward along 
the curves continues until all the additional $6 is spent. In Figure 22.6, this happens at 
points d for movies and e for books.
• Movies: The quantity increases from 8 to 10, meaning that the consumer spends 
$4 of the additional $6 on movies. The income effect is the increase in movies 
from 8 to 10.
• Books. The quantity increases from seven to nine, meaning that the consumer 
spends $2 of the additional $6 on books.
At points d and e, the equimarginal rule is satisfied: for both goods, the marginal utility 
per dollar is 14 utils.
We can summarize the two effects of a decrease in the price of movies. The substi-
tution effect causes the move from point c to point s, an increase in movie consumption 
from six to eight movies. The income effect causes the move from point s to point d, an 
increase in movie consumption from 8 to 10 movies. In this simple example, the sub-
stitution effect is equal to the income effect. In general, the substitution effect will not 
be the same as the income effect. But for normal goods, the two effects operate in the 

part 8
496
We could use the same process to derive other points on the individual demand 
curve. For example, an increase in price would generate substitution and income effects 
that decrease the quantity of movies demanded.
• Substitution effect. An increase in the price of movies increases the price of 
movies relative to the price of books, causing the consumer to substitute books 
for movies.
• Income effect. An increase in the price of movies decreases the consumer’s 
real income (purchasing power), and the consumer will buy less of all “normal” 
goods, including movies.
The key lesson is that each point on a demand curve shows the utility-maximizing 
choice for a particular price.

sion making. Neuroscientists have developed techniques to map and measure the brain

same direction. A decrease in price increases the relative attractiveness of the good, caus-
ing substitution in favor of the good (the substitution effect). In addition, a decrease in 
price increases the consumer’s purchasing power (real income), increasing the quantity 
demanded of all normal goods (the income effect).
The Individual Demand Curve
Figure 22.7 shows the individual demand curve for our hypothetical consumer. At the 
initial price of $3, the consumer maximizes utility with six movies (point i). A decrease 
in price to $2 increases the quantity demanded to 10 movies (point j). The move from 
point i to point j reflects both the substitution effect and the income effect of a decrease 
in price. The consumer observes the law of demand, consuming a larger quantity of 
movies because (a) movies are less costly relative to books and other goods (the sub-
stitution effect) and (b) the decrease in price increases the consumer’s real income, 
increasing the quantity of all “normal” goods, including movies (the income effect).

consumer’s product choice. By integrating the insights from neuroscience into our eco-
nomic model of consumer choice, we can gain a deeper understanding of how consumers 
make decisions and why consumers sometimes make choices that appear to be irrational.
The Neuroscience of Benefit Valuation
Recent work in neuroscience shows that different regions of the brain are involved in 
the valuation of the benefits and costs of possible actions. Starting on the benefit side, 
the key region for the valuation of benefits is the nucleus accumbens (NAcc), the main 
part of the ventral striatum. When a person considers taking an action, the NAcc is 
activated, and the greater the anticipated benefit from the action, the stronger the NAcc 
activity. For example, if you think about buying an apple, your NAcc will be activated, 
and the more you expect to enjoy an apple, the stronger the brain activity. The strength 
of the NAcc activity associated with a particular product is determined by past experi-
ence. If you’ve had good apple experiences in the past, the NAcc activity generated by 
thinking about eating an apple will be relatively strong.
The calibration of the regions of the brain involved in benefit valuation comes 
from the brain’s dopamine system. Dopamine is the reward chemical of the brain—
when it flows over receptors in your brain, you feel good. When you consider buying a 
product such as an apple, your brain uses its past experience to form a conjecture about 
the likely pleasure and satisfaction from eating the apple. The greater the conjectured 
satisfaction, the greater the flow of dopamine to the receptors in your brain. It’s impor-
tant to note that the dopamine flow starts before you eat the apple. When you actually 
eat the apple, your brain will check its reward systems to see if its conjecture about the 
pleasure from the apple is realized. If the conjectures are realized—if the brain correctly 
predicted the pleasure—the (correct) dopamine flow continues.

for president against John Anderson, who proposed a revenue-
neutral increase in the gasoline tax. Reagan said that the idea 
was silly because it simply took money from one of the tax-
payer’s pockets and put it back into the other pocket.
This logic is faulty because it ignores the substitution effect 
of a price change. For example, consider the typical taxpayer 
Mr. Evgeny Slutsky, who buys 300 gallons of gasoline per year. 
He will pay $900 in gasoline taxes per year, while his income 
taxes will be cut by $900 per year. So Evgeny can still afford to 
do what he did before the change in taxes: his original bundle 
of gasoline and other goods is still affordable. Although Evgeny 
can still afford his original choice, that’s not the best choice. As 
we’ve seen in our discussion of the substitution effect, the gas 
tax decreases the marginal utility per dollar spent on gasoline, 
which is now less than the marginal utility per dollar spent on 
other goods. Gasoline now generates a lower marginal bang 
per buck, and the rational response for Evgeny is to buy less 
gasoline and more of the other goods, which now have a larger 
marginal bang per buck. This is the substitution effect in action, 
and we know for sure that a revenue-neutral increase in the 
gasoline tax will decrease gasoline consumption.  Related to 
Exercise 2.8.
Suppose the national government imposes a new tax of $3 
per gallon of gasoline, which will bring gasoline taxation in the 
United States closer to the levels experienced in European 
countries. And suppose the gasoline tax is combined with a cut 
in income taxes to ensure that total tax revenue doesn’t change. 
In other words, the gasoline tax is revenue neutral. How will such 
a tax policy affect total gasoline consumption?
It may be tempting to conclude that the change in tax 
policy will not change gasoline consumption. After all, the pol-
icy doesn’t change the tax liability of the typical taxpayer: the 
increase in gasoline taxes is offset by a decrease in income 
taxes. This was the logic of Ronald Reagan in his campaign

Learning happens when a consumer’s conjectures about the pleasure of consuming 
a product are wrong. For example, suppose you anticipate a sweet apple and thus have 
a large dopamine flow, but the first bite generates a sour taste. The invalidation of the 
brain’s conjecture causes an abrupt decrease in the dopamine flow, causing an abrupt 
reduction of the good feelings produced by dopamine. The brain is especially sensitive 
to a decrease in the flow of dopamine, so the sour apple provides a memorable lesson: 
Some apples are sour. The next time you consider eating an apple, your conjectured 
pleasure—and dopamine flow—will be lower. In the other direction, if you are pleas-
antly surprised by the wonderful taste of an apple, you will update and upgrade your 
conjectures for the next time you consider eating an apple. Over years or decades of 
consumption, errors in benefit conjectures allow the brain to fine-tune its valuation 
of the benefits of different products. In effect, the dopamine system allows us to learn 
from our mistakes, honing our valuation of the benefit of all sorts of products.
How does your brain assess the benefit of a product you’ve never consumed? For 
a new product, the brain uses the notion of association, basing its benefit valuation on 
past experiences with similar products. For example, the first time you consider eat-
ing a pear, your brain may associate the pear with a look-alike fruit such as an apple, 
triggering NAcc activity of a similar strength. Over decades of choices, the NAcc uses 
the dopamine system to learn the benefits of a wide variety of products, providing an 
inventory of benefit valuations that can be used directly for repeat purchases and used 
indirectly for new products.
It’s important to note that these benefit valuations are gut feelings that occur 
without any thinking or reflection. When you see an apple, the NAcc benefit valua-
tion is instantaneous, without any conscious thought of the taste and the rewards from 
reducing your hunger. These gut feelings are calibrated by the dopamine trial-and-
error system. Given the discomfort of the penalty for an error (the interruption of the 
dopamine flow), the brain quickly hones its benefit conjectures to more closely match 
the actual benefits from consuming the product.
The Neuroscience of Cost Valuation
On the cost side, the key regions for cost valuation are the insular cortex (insula for 
short) and the amygdala. These interconnected regions express aversion to various 
actions. For example, activity in the insula increases when you see someone in pain or 
imagine a foul odor. Insula activity also increases when you consider losing something 
of value such as money. The aversion to spending money is consistent with the prin-
ciple of opportunity cost.
P r i n c i p l e  O f  O p p o r t u n i t y  C o s t 
The opportunity cost of something is what you sacrifice to get it.
The money spent on one product cannot be used on another product, so it is natural 
that the brain reacts in a negative way (in the region that expresses aversion) to the 
thought of spending money. The higher the price of a product, the greater the oppor-
tunity cost of the product, and thus the stronger the activity of the insula.
It is not yet clear to neuroscientists how the insula is calibrated to represent, in 
neuron activity, the cost of buying a product. The leading theory is that the value of 
money is learned from conditioned association. For example, suppose you lose $10 (by 
misplacing it, giving it away, or spending it on a product), and that means you can’t buy 
a $10 book you really want. You will experience a gut-feeling sense of loss from not get-
ting the book. This gut feeling comes from a certain level of neuron activity, which you 
then associate with the $10 loss. If you lose $20 and then cannot go to a $20 concert, 
the loss of the concert opportunity will generate neuron activity that you will associate 
with the $20 loss. Over time, you will learn from experience what it means, in terms 

Chapter 22 • Consumer Choice: Utility Theory and Insights from Neuroscience
499
of neuron activity, to lose different amounts of money. This learning process incorpo-
rates the cost of spending money into your gut feelings. When you imagine spending 
a particular dollar amount, you will have an instantaneous gut-feeling reaction, a result 
of neuron activity that is based on learning from past experience. This learning process 
essentially builds opportunity cost into your gut feelings and neuron activity.
To summarize, neuron activity in the insula represents the dollar cost of buying 
a product. Although the mechanism that calibrates the insula has so far been elusive, 
we do know that the higher the price of a product, the stronger the insula activity. It’s 
important to note that these cost valuations are gut feelings that occur without any 
thinking or reflection. When you look at the price tag on an apple, the cost valuation 
in your insula is instantaneous.
The Wisdom of Gut Feelings
Scientists use a classic experiment, the Iowa Gambling Task, to demonstrate the power 
and wisdom of gut feelings. The subjects in the experiment draw cards from four different 
decks, and each card triggers either a monetary reward or a penalty. Two of the decks have 
favorable cards (on average, a positive payoff), and two have unfavorable cards (on average, 
a negative payoff and relatively large penalties). The subjects don’t have any prior knowl-
edge of the features of the decks, but they learn as they draw cards. The key question is, 
How long will it take for the subjects to start drawing exclusively from the favorable decks?
Scientists use skin-conductivity sensors attached to the subjects’ hands to track 
their gut feelings. When the brain senses that a person is about to take a harmful 
action, it sends an alarm in the form of increased sweat production that increases the 
electrical conductivity of a subject’s skin. In this case, the harmful action is reaching 
for an unfavorable deck and the possibility of a relatively large penalty. By observing 
the conductivity of the subjects’ hands, scientists observe the timing of the gut-feeling 
alarm. On average, the alarm for the unfavorable decks starts after a subject has drawn 
only 10 cards. Based on only 10 trials, the dopamine learning system has seen enough: 
when the subject reaches for an unfavorable deck, the brain activates the sweat glands 
as a warning of an imminent harmful action.
Most subjects don’t immediately heed the gut-feeling warning. On average, it 
takes a subject about 50 cards to respond to the warning and stop drawing from the 
unfavorable decks. At this point, the typical subject cannot explain why he or she started 
avoiding the unfavorable decks. Although the subjects’ choices are affected by their gut 
feelings, they cannot articulate the reasons. After about 60 cards, the typical subject can 
finally explain their avoidance of the unfavorable decks.
The Iowa Gambling Task reminds us that the brain quickly processes lots of infor-
mation without our knowledge. The dopamine learning system is unconscious, and gen-
erates gut feelings that are useful in assessing the benefits and costs of actions. Although 
the expression of the gut feelings is instantaneous, the feelings are based on experiences 
that go back hours or years. The brain is continuously monitoring our actions, using its 
dopamine learning system to hone its valuation of benefits and costs. Although we may 
not be able to articulate our gut feelings, these feelings reflect the wisdom of experience.
Scientists have used the Iowa Gambling Task to study the brain’s learning system. 
They observed the choices of subjects whose amygdala (part of the cost-valuation sys-
tem) was disabled. These subjects never learned to draw exclusively from the favorable 
deck. The data from skin conductivity tests explained their choices: the alarm system 
that warned normal subjects to avoid the unfavorable decks did not work in the disabled 
subjects. The disabling of the amygdala prevented the brain from learning which decks 
were unfavorable, so there were no gut-feeling alarms.
Cognition and Choice
To decide whether to take an action, a person compares the anticipated benefit of the 
action to its anticipated cost. The principal decision-making region of the brain is the pre-
frontal cortex (PFC). The PFC observes the benefit-valuation activity in various regions 

part 8
500
of the brain, and uses these activity levels as inputs into the decision-making process. In 
other words, the PFC uses gut feelings as inputs into the decision-making process.
Scientists have used variations on the Iowa Gambling Task to demonstrate the role 
of the PFC in decision making. Scientists gave the task to people whose PFCs were 
disabled in the regions responsible for comparing gut-feeling benefits to gut-feeling 
costs. The subjects with disabled PFCs never learned to avoid the unfavorable decks, 
despite the fact that the regions of their brains responsible for valuing gut-feeling 
benefits and costs (NAcc and insula) functioned normally. This experiment shows the 
role of the PFC in processing benefit and cost information that originates in other 
regions of the brain.
The PFC is not a simple calculator of gut-feeling benefits and costs, but incorpo-
rates other factors into the decision-making process. The PFC uses cognition (con-
scious thought) to consider a broad set of possible consequences of an action. For 
example, suppose you have decided to buy either a donut or an apple, each of which 
costs $1. At the gut-feeling level, the consideration of each product will trigger activity 
in your NAcc in anticipation of the benefit of consumption, and this gut-feeling benefit 
will be transmitted to the PFC. Suppose the donut generates a stronger gut-feeling 
benefit, reflecting its delightful sugar and fat content. If you rely exclusively on your gut 
feeling, you will choose the donut. But you could use your PFC to incorporate other 
considerations into the decision. For example, you could stop to think about the health 
consequences of the high-fat donut. If the unfavorable health consequences of the donut 
seem large enough, you will ignore your gut feelings and choose the apple instead.
The dorsal-lateral portion of the PFC (DLPFC) is responsible for introducing 
other factors into the decision-making process. In particular, the DLPFC incorporates 
the possible future consequence of an action. Neuroscientists use transcranial magnetic 
stimulation (TMS) to down-regulate (partially disable) the DLPFC of subjects, and 
then observe their choices. The subjects with disabled DLPFCs make impulsive choices 
based on gut feelings rather than thoughtful choices based on cognition. For example, 
the subjects grab a small immediate reward rather than waiting a relatively short time 
for a larger reward. The general effect of disabling the DLPFC is to make the subjects 
more selfish and impulsive. In our example of the apple versus the donut, a person with 
a disabled DLPFC is more likely to choose the donut because he or she will ignore the 
long-term health consequences.
Why do people make different choices? People differ in two ways that are relevant 
to consumer decisions:
• Strength of their gut feelings. On the benefit side, consumers differ in the 
gut-feeling benefit of consuming a product, as represented by the strength of 
activity in the NAcc. On the cost side, consumers differ in the gut-feeling cost 
of spending money, as represented by the strength of activity in the insula. 
Consumers with relatively active insulas are tightwads (reluctant to spend 
money), whereas consumers with relatively quiet insulas are looser with their 
money.
• Cognitive weighting. Consumers who are relatively inactive in a cognitive 
sense tend to make impulsive purchases (the donut). In contrast, cognitively 
active consumers tend to exercise more self-control and make more thoughtful 
purchases (the apple). In one experiment, scientists were able to divide subjects 
into two groups: the self-controllers had relatively active DLPFCs, indicating 
lively cognition that generated nonimpulsive behavior; the non-self-controllers 
had less active DLPFCs, indicating cognitive passivity that generated impulsive 
behavior.
Predicting Consumer Choice
We’ve seen that neuroscientists map and measure the brain activity associated with 
consumer decisions. After observing a consumer’s brain activity while he or she con-
siders different options, scientists can actually predict the consumer’s choice. In the 

Chapter 22 • Consumer Choice: Utility Theory and Insights from Neuroscience
501
SHOP experiment (save holdings or purchase), scientists showed a consumer different 
products and prices, and observed the levels of activity in the NAcc (for benefit valu-
ation), insula (for cost valuation), and PFC (benefit–cost analysis). The scientists used 
the observed activity levels to predict which product the consumer actually purchased. 
Although the scientists’ predictions were not perfect, they were much better than would 
occur by chance.
Fuel for Cognition
As we’ve seen, the decision-making process that occurs in the PFC is complex. As 
a result, the cognitive process consumes a large amount of energy in supporting 
neurons as they perform their various tasks. The brain gets most of its energy from 
glucose (aka blood sugar), and operates effectively only when it has a plentiful supply 
of glucose.
To demonstrate the importance of glucose as brain fuel, scientists perform the 
following experiment. A subject is forced to make a series of decisions, each of which 
engages the cognitive process (considering benefits and costs and then making a 
choice). This engagement of the cognitive process burns glucose. After a long series of 
challenging decisions, the subject is asked to perform a task that requires cognition, for 
example solving a difficult puzzle. Compared to a control group (people who had not 
depleted their glucose by making decisions), the subjects were less persistent in trying 
to solve the puzzle. The simple lesson is that the depletion of cognitive fuel makes 
people less inclined to engage their cognitive systems.
The fuel requirements of cognition have important implications for consumer 
decision making. As we’ve seen, cognition can replace impulsive decisions (simply 
go with your gut) with thoughtful decisions that consider both gut feelings and 
other factors. A person with a low level of glucose is more likely to skip the energy-
consuming cognitive process and make an impulsive decision. It doesn’t take much 
energy to go with your gut feelings, and if you’re low on fuel, that is the natural 
response.
Cognitive processing is particularly important in making consumer decisions that 
involve many options. To illustrate, consider the process of buying a new car, which 
typically involves a series of choices about style (color), performance (acceleration, fuel 
economy), and features (seats, sound system). As a customer goes through a long series 
of decisions about style, performance, and features, each decision engages the cogni-
tive process and consumes brain fuel. Eventually, the depletion of cognitive fuel causes 
decision fatigue, and the consumer is more likely to rely exclusively on gut feelings, 
making impulsive rather than thoughtful decisions.
The same logic applies when a consumer faces a large number of options for a 
single product. For example, consider a consumer who faces a display with 50 differ-
ent types of toothbrushes. The consumer will naturally engage the cognitive process, 
assessing the benefits and costs of each toothbrush and weighing the trade-offs. Given 
the large number of options, the deliberative process will burn a lot of brain fuel and 
reduce the consumer’s ability to effectively engage the cognitive process. A consumer 
may respond to the depletion of brain fuel in one of three ways: (a) simplify matters by 
focusing on a single dimension of the product (price, color, shine), (b) abandon cogni-
tion and make an impulse buy, or (c) abandon the decision-making process altogether 
and refrain from buying a toothbrush.
The problems caused by having too many options are illustrated by the famous 
jam experiment. Researchers ran the experiment in a fancy food store in Menlo Park, 
California. They set up a table with samples of jam, sometimes offering six different 
flavors, and other times offering 24 flavors. Although shoppers were more likely to stop 
by the table with more flavors, they were less likely to actually buy jam. After the taste 
test, only 3 percent of the shoppers at the 24-flavor table bought jam, compared to 30 
percent at the six-flavor table. The simple lesson is that sometimes having too many 
options makes it difficult to choose.

Consumer Decisions: Insights from Neuroscience
In this part of the chapter, we incorporate the key insights from neuroscience into 
our model of consumer choice. Specifically, we apply the equimarginal rule to several 
consumer decisions in which the engagement of the cognitive process—the forward-
looking DLPFC—may change behavior as consumers switch from impulsive choices 
to more thoughtful choices. Some scientists speculate that the evolutionary develop-
ment of the DLPFC in humans increased our fitness (likelihood of survival) because 
it gave us the ability to incorporate long-term considerations into the decision-­
making process.
Dietary Choice: Donut versus Apple
Consider the decision between healthy and unhealthy food. Suppose a consumer has 
a fixed budget of $10 to spend on apples and donuts, each of which has a price of $1. 
The gut-feeling benefit of the high-fat donut is relatively high: neuroscientists have 
shown that the subjective pleasantness of the oral texture of fat generates a high level 
of neural activity in the NAcc. In the left panel of Figure 22.8, the upper curve shows 
the gut-feeling marginal utility per dollar of donuts.
Consider first the outcome for a consumer who relies exclusively on gut feelings. In 
this case, utility is maximized with point a (nine donuts) and point b (one apple). This 
bundle satisfies the two conditions for utility maximization.
1	 Equimarginal rule. For each good, the marginal utility per dollar is 12 utils.
2	 Affordability. The consumer spends $9 on donuts and $1 on apples, for a total 
of $10.
In this case, a consumer who simply goes with his or her gut feelings eats a lot 
of donuts.

Coke Versus Pepsi In The Prefrontal Cortex
Applying The Concepts #3: How does cognition affect consumer choice?
Things changed when Montague told the subjects which 
brand they were drinking. In the nonblind tests, about three-
fourths preferred Coke. When a subject knew which brand he or 
she was tasting, there was heightened activity in the prefrontal 
cortex, where the brain uses higher-order cognition to make a 
choice. A consumer’s choice is based on gut-feeling benefits 
and costs (from the ventral striatum and other regions), as well 
as other factors. When the typical subject knowingly tasted Coke 
and then Pepsi, the activity in the prefrontal cortex was stronger 
for Coke than for Pepsi, presumably reflecting more favorable 
images and feelings associated with Coke commercials. For 
many subjects, the brand associations developed from Coke 
advertisements dominated the gut feelings in favor of Pepsi, so 
more subjects favored Coke. In other words, branding affects 
brain activity and consumer preference.  Related to Exercise 3.7.

In the “Pepsi Challenge” advertisements of the 1970s and 
1980s, randomly chosen consumers tasted Pepsi and Coke, 
and a majority preferred Pepsi. Despite the apparent prefer-
ence in favor of Pepsi, a majority of buyers chose Coke. Thirty 
years later, neuroscientist Read Montague decided to run a 
Pepsi challenge while observing the brain activity of the sub-
jects. When the taste test was blind—when the subjects didn’t 
know which brand they were drinking—more than half preferred 
Pepsi. When a person drank his or her preferred drink, there was 
heightened activity in the ventral striatum, an area where the 
brain values rewards and benefits.

How does cognition affect the consumer’s choice? Recent experiments by neu-
roscientists have shown that the more a person thinks about the health consequences 
of an unhealthy food like a donut, the lower the perceived benefit of the unhealthy 
food. In terms of neural activity, the DLPFC modulates (in this case reduces) the 
neural activity that signals the benefit of the donut. In the left panel of Figure 22.8, 
the lower curve shows the cognitive marginal utility per dollar: the incorporation 
of health concerns shifts the benefit curve downward. For the ninth donut, the 
marginal utility per dollar decreases from 12 utils (point a) to 2 utils (point c). The 
marginal utility per dollar of donuts (2 utils) is now less than the marginal utility per 
dollar of apples (12 utils, as shown by point b). The consumer’s rational response 
is to buy more apples and fewer donuts. In other words, cognition that incorpo-
rates long-term health concerns decreases donut consumption and increases apple 
consumption.
How far will the consumer go in substituting apples for donuts? Since the price 
of each good is $1, the consumer trades off one donut for each additional apple, mov-
ing upward along the donut benefit curve (starting at point c) and downward along 
the apple curve (starting from point b). The consumer will continue substituting 
apples for donuts until the two products generate the same marginal utility per dollar 
(the same marginal bang per buck). This occurs at point e (four donuts) and point d 
(six apples), with a common marginal utility per dollar of 7 utils. The switch from 
impulsive choice (based on gut feelings) to thoughtful choice (based on cognition 
that incorporates health consequences) increases apple consumption at the expense 
of donuts.
What are the implications of brain fueling for dietary choices? Our gut feelings 
for food and nutrition are biased toward high-fat and high-calorie foods, meaning 
that impulsive choices generally lead to unhealthy choices. Although the cognitive 
process can counteract this bias by introducing health concerns, this requires cogni-
tive fuel. So the best way to make healthy food choices is to shop when your brain is 
fully fueled and ready for impulse control, not when you are hungry and thus suscep-
tible to impulsive decisions. An added problem with shopping while hungry is that a 
glucose-depleted brain seeks immediate refueling, and the quickest refueling comes 
from sugary food.
▲  Figure 22.8  Gut Feelings versus Cognition: Donuts versus Apples
For a decision based exclusively on gut feelings, a consumer using the equimarginal rule chooses points 
a and b (nine donuts and one apple). The engagement of the cognitive process decreases the perceived 
MU per dollar of donuts, so at the original bundle (nine donuts, one apple), the MU per dollar is 2 utils for 
donuts (point c), compared to 12 utils for apples (point b). The new utility-maximizing choice is shown 
by points e and d: cognitive engagement decreases donut consumption from nine to four and increases 
apple consumption from one to six.

Present Bias: Spending versus Saving
Consider the broad consumer decision about how much income to spend now, and 
how much to save for the future. Since any money saved will eventually be spent, this 
is essentially a decision about the timing of consumption, now versus later. We can use 
the utilitarian framework to explore decisions about spending and saving.
Gut feelings are visceral, in-the-moment sensations, and humans are myopic with 
respect to gut feelings. In other words, humans do a poor job imagining the strength 
of future gut feelings, including the gut-feeling benefits of future consumption. Experi-
ments by psychologists and neuroscientists have consistently shown that people sys-
tematically underestimate the strength of future gut feelings, both positive (benefits 
of consumption) and negative (monetary cost). Our underestimation of future con-
sequences means that humans are subject to present bias: We accurately incorporate 
the present consequences of an action, but either ignore or underestimate the future 
consequences. This present bias can lead to misguided decisions, but the bias can be 
counteracted by cognitive processing.
Figure 22.9 illustrates utility maximization with respect to spending versus sav-
ing. In the left panel, the benefit curve shows the marginal utility per dollar spent in 
the present. For current consumption, gut feelings accurately represent the benefit 
of consumption. In the right panel, the lower curve shows the benefit of saving (the 
benefit of future consumption) for a consumer subject to present bias: the consumer 
systematically underestimates the future benefit of consumption. In the case of a con-
sumer subject to present bias, utility is maximized with point a (spend $19 now) and 
point b (save $1 for the future). This bundle satisfies the two conditions for utility 
maximization.
1	 Equimarginal rule. For both spending and saving, the marginal utility per dollar 
is 14 utils.
2	 Affordability. The consumer spends $19 now and saves $1, for a total of $20.
In this case, a consumer who goes with his or her gut feelings doesn’t save much.
▲  Figure 22.9  Present Bias and Spending versus Saving
A consumer subject to present bias chooses points a and b (spend $19 and save $1). Cognition that 
reduces present bias increases the perceived MU per dollar of saving, so at the original bundle (spend 
$19, save $1), the MU per dollar is higher for saving (point c versus point a). The new utility-maximizing 
choice shown by points e and d: cognitive engagement increases saving from $1 to $7 and decreases 
spending (consumption now) from $19 to $13.

Consider next a consumer who uses cognition to offset present bias. In the right 
panel of Figure 22.9, the upper curve shows the benefit curve for a consumer who 
engages the DLPFC and thus increases the perceived benefit of future consumption: 
cognition offsets present bias and shifts the benefit curve upward. For example, for the 
first dollar saved, the marginal utility per dollar increases from 14 utils (point b) to 38 utils 
(point c). The marginal utility per dollar of saving (38 utils) now exceeds the marginal 
utility per dollar of spending (14 utils). The consumer’s rational response is to save more 
and thus have more to spend on future consumption. As in the case of the apple versus 
the donut, the engagement of the DLPFC incorporates the future consequences of a 
present action, and thus reduces impulsive behavior (spend most of the money now).
How much more will the consumer save? As current spending decreases and saving 
increases, the consumer moves upward along the spending benefit curve (starting at 
point a) and downward along the saving curve (starting from point c). The consumer 
will continue to increase saving until the marginal utility per dollar of saving equals 
the marginal utility per dollar of spending. This occurs at point e ($13 spent now) and 
point d ($7 saved), with a common marginal utility per dollar of 26 utils. The switch 
from impulsive choice (based on gut feelings) to thoughtful choice (based on cogni-
tion) increases saving and future consumption at the expense of current consumption.
Consumers use a number of strategies to counteract present bias and increase sav-
ing. Some workers pre-commit to regular saving programs, directing their employers 
to take out a fixed amount of money from each paycheck. This approach eliminates 
the monthly decision of how much to save, reducing the cognitive effort required to 
overcome present bias. Another commitment strategy is to join savings clubs such as a 
Christmas saving club that saves a fixed amount each month leading up to Christmas. 
In micro-finance programs in the less developed world, participants band together 
in small groups to monitor each others’ savings programs and enforce commitments 
to save. The basic strategy behind these programs is for the consumer/saver to pre-­
commit to a saving program, and then get someone else to enforce the rules. This 
approach economizes on cognitive effort and reduces impulsive spending.
Present bias occurs because there is a mismatch in the timing of benefits and 
costs. In the case of saving for retirement, the cost occurs in the present (lower cur-
rent consumption), while the benefit occurs in the future. One approach to coun-
teracting present bias is to shift the cost of contributing to retirement accounts 
from the present to the future. For example, some employers allow new employees 
to delay their investment in a retirement account for a year or two. This approach 
avoids the powerful gut-feeling cost of contributing now, and puts the costs and the 
benefits of saving for retirement on an equal temporal footing: they are both in the 
future. By simply shifting the cost into the near future (even if the cost occurs sooner 
than the benefit), the employer counteracts present bias, increasing investment in 
retirement accounts.
Present Bias and Credit Cards
Consider next the implications of present bias for a consumer who purchases a product 
with a credit card. Credit cards cause a different sort of temporal mismatch between 
benefits and costs. In this case, the benefit of a product will be experienced now, but 
the cost will be delayed until some future date. Neuroscientists have measured the brain 
activity associated with cash purchases (pay now) and credit-card purchases (pay later). 
Consistent with the notion of present bias, credit-card purchases generate much weaker 
activity than cash purchases: The insula, which indicates cost (the degree of aversion 
or disgust), is relatively quiet for credit-card purchases. In other words, using a credit 
card weakens our gut-feeling aversion to spending money.
We can use cognition to counteract the failure of our gut feelings to represent future 
costs. Once the PFC recognizes the underrepresentation of the future cost, we can 
upgrade the perceived cost of a credit-card purchase, perhaps by imagining how it would 
feel to pay with cash. Alternatively, we can remind ourselves that a credit-card charge 

part 8
506
will eventually require a cash payment. In one experiment, people making credit-card 
purchases were simply shown their credit-card statements. A quick look at the credit-
card balance triggered activity in the insula that was similar to the activity associated 
with cash purchases, thus eliminating present bias. Some organizations have developed 
mobile apps that send reminders to consumers about their credit-card balances, thereby 
activating the insula and mitigating present bias.
Present Bias and Smoking
The decision to smoke cigarettes is subject to present bias because there is a temporal 
mismatch between the present benefit (the good feeling from nicotine) and a future 
cost (health problems). Some people continue to smoke even when smoking is not in 
their long-term interest. One response to this case of present bias is to use self-imposed 
penalties to move the cost of smoking to the present. This allows a direct comparison 
of present benefit and present cost. For example, a smoker could commit to contribute 
$50 to a charitable organization for each cigarette smoked, and get someone else to 
enforce the commitment. Under this approach, when someone considers lighting up 
a cigarette, he or she instantaneously experiences both a gut-feeling benefit and a gut-
feeling cost of losing $50. The increase in the present cost of smoking increases the 
likelihood that a smoker will quit.
Experiments with self-imposed penalties demonstrate their effectiveness. In one 
experiment, each subject voluntarily deposited the money that he or she would nor-
mally spend on cigarettes into a bank account that paid no interest. After 6 months, any 
subject who tested positive for nicotine forfeited the money in the account. Compared 
to a control group that was offered an alternative stop-smoking program, the smokers 
in the bank-account program were about 40 percent more likely to be nonsmokers after 
a year (6 months after the program ended).
Another approach to pre-commitment comes from stickK.com. You start by pick-
ing your goal (stop smoking, lose weight, exercise regularly), and then pick your penalty 
and choose a referee to monitor your progress and impose any penalties. The penalty 
could be as light as e-mails from stickK.com to your friends informing them you are 
falling short of your goal, or it could be a financial penalty such as $50 deducted from 
your bank account and paid to your favorite charity. For extra incentive, you can send 
your penalty money to an anticharity, an organization whose goals you vehemently 
oppose. In late 2011, nearly $9 million in potential penalties was in play, with over 
120,000 commitments and over 2 million cigarettes not smoked. For people who pre-
commit to a monetary penalty, the reported success rate is 80%, compared to only 35% 
for people without a monetary penalty.
Gambling as a Consumer Good
Why do people gamble when the expected reward is negative? For example, the typi-
cal state-run lottery pays out roughly half of what it takes in, so on average a person 
who plays the lottery for $10 can expect a payoff of roughly $5. Neuroscientists have 
discovered a possible reason for this seemingly irrational behavior.
Consider a simple gambling game. You put on a blindfold and draw a single ball 
from an urn that has three balls, marked #1, #2, and #3. As shown in the first row of 
the table in Figure 22.10, you win $12 if you draw #3, but get nothing if you draw #1 
or #2. In this case, the expected monetary payoff equals the probability of winning (1/3) 
times the $12 prize, or $4. Suppose the cost of the gamble is $6: Each time you draw 
a ball from the urn you pay $6. If you draw a ball repeatedly, on average the payoff 
will be $4 per draw, or two-thirds the $6 cost per draw. This doesn’t sound like a very 
attractive gamble. Why pay $6 for an average payoff of $4?
A near miss is defined as an outcome that seems to be close to a winning outcome 
(a better label might be “near win”). In the case of drawing a ball from the urn, a person 
might consider drawing ball #2 a near miss in the sense 2 is close to 3, the winning 

Chapter 22 • Consumer Choice: Utility Theory and Insights from Neuroscience
507
number. Neuroscientists have discovered that the brain’s dopamine reward system 
treats a near miss almost the same as a real win: The flow of dopamine generated by a 
near miss is almost the same as the flow generated by an actual win. In the second row 
of numbers in Figure 22.10, the dopamine benefit for a near miss (drawing #2) is 9 utils, 
which is almost as large as the 12-util reward for an actual win.
The consideration of the dopamine benefits of near misses makes the gamble more 
attractive. There is a two-thirds chance of drawing #2 or #3, meaning that there is a 
two-thirds chance of getting a dopamine reward of at least 9 utils. More precisely, the 
expected dopamine reward is 7 utils, computed as the sum of two components:
• 4 utils = 1/3 * 12: a one-in-three chance of getting 12 utils by drawing #3
• 3 utils = 1/3 * 9: a one-in-three chance of getting 9 utils by drawing #2
On average, the dopamine reward is 7 utils, compared to a cost of $6 per draw from 
the urn. The consumer will take the gamble if the average reward of 7 utils exceeds the 
cost—the utility loss associated with paying $6 to draw a ball.
Because the brain rewards near misses with pleasure-generating dopamine, gam-
bling can be considered a consumer good. The expected monetary payoff of the gamble 
is negative: The consumer pays $6 for an average payoff of $4, so the “price” of the 
gamble is the $2 lost, on average, on each ball draw. The consumer can buy dopamine 
brain rewards, exchanging a monetary loss of $2 per ball draw for a dopamine reward 
that averages 7 utils per draw.
Although the dopamine reward for near misses seems puzzling, scientists suggest 
that there is evolutionary rationale for this feature of the learning system. The reward 
for a near miss encourages skill acquisition. Suppose you are a basketball novice, and you 
want to learn how to shoot the basketball successfully. As a beginner, you are unlikely to 
make many shots, but you might occasionally hit the rim. If there are rewards only for 
successful shots, you may get discouraged and give up after a few dozen shots. As a result, 
you may never acquire the skill. In contrast, if you are rewarded for your occasional near 
miss (a rim shot), the rewards will encourage you to keep trying. In addition, the reward 
for a near basket will provide important feedback on what it takes to get close, and you 
can use this feedback to adjust your actions and get even closer. The reward for near 
baskets encourages you to keep trying, making it more likely that you will develop your 
shooting skills. In other words, rewards for near misses promote the acquisition of skills.
The dopamine rewards for near misses are problematic in truly random environ-
ments like gambling. In the case of drawing balls from an urn, rolling dice, or playing 
a slot machine, there are no skills to master: no matter how much you practice, you 
cannot increase your probability of drawing ball #3, rolling snake eyes, or getting a 
triple on the slot machine. But if the brain reward for a near miss is almost the same as 
a reward for an actual win, you have an incentive to keep playing (and losing money) 
despite the lack of skill acquisition. In a sense, you are buying the brain reward (pleasur-
able dopamine flow) with the money you leave behind.
▲  Figure 22.10  Near-Miss Benefits and Gambling as a Consumer Good
If you draw ball #3, you win $12. The expected monetary value of drawing a ball from the urn is 
$4 = 1/3 * $12. Suppose the dopamine benefit of winning is 12 utils, while the dopamine ben-
efit for a near win (drawing ball #2) is 9 utils. The expected dopamine value of drawing a ball is 
7 utils = 1/3 * 9 + 1/3 * 12.

Taxing Cigarettes To Offset Present Bias
Applying The Concepts #4: What is the appropriate cigarette tax?
associated with premature death). But present bias is sufficiently 
strong that a tax of roughly $11 per pack is required to ensure 
that the typical smoker considers the full cost associated with 
premature death. This tax puts the benefits and costs of smoking 
on an equal temporal footing: a tax of $11 moves the neglected 
future cost to the present, allowing a person to make choices 
that consider the full benefits and costs of smoking.
How would the cigarette tax affect low-income households? 
Because smoking is more prevalent among the poor, a cigarette 
tax imposes a relatively large tax burden on low-income house-
holds: lower-income households spend a much larger fraction 
of their income on cigarettes and cigarette taxes. The authors of 
the study suggest that the cigarette tax would actually be bene-
ficial for low-income households. The reason is that low-income 
households are relatively responsive to changes in the price of 
cigarettes, so they would experience a relatively large reduction 
in smoking, and a relatively large increase in lifespan. Of course, 
the whole idea of the tax is to reduce smoking, and anyone who 
quits gets the benefit of a longer lifespan and avoids paying the 
$11 tax too.  Related to Exercise 4.7.
SOURCE: Based on Jonathan Gruber and Botond Koszegi, “A Modern Economic 
View of Tobacco Taxation” (Paris: International Union against Tuberculosis and 
Lung Disease, 2008).
The present bias that leads some people to smoke cigarettes 
raises an important policy question: Can we use taxes on ciga-
rettes to offset present bias and actually make people better off 
in the process? A recent study concludes that to fully offset the 
present bias that underlies the decision to smoke, the appropri-
ate tax is roughly $11 per pack of cigarettes.
The authors of the study focused on the effects of smoking 
on premature death. Smoking cuts the lifespan of the typical 
smoker by roughly 6 years, and given the economic value of 
1 year of life, we can translate the cost associated with pre-
mature death into a cost of roughly $36 per pack of cigarettes. 
If smokers did not suffer from present bias, their present choices 
would fully reflect this future cost, meaning that they would com-
pare the benefit of smoking (the nicotine experience) to the full 
cost of a pack of cigarettes (the purchase price plus the $36 cost

This chapter uses tradi-
tional utility theory, which 
originated with the utili-
tarians of the eighteenth 
century, to explain the 
economic logic behind the 
law of demand. We also 
use the insights of modern neuroscience to explore the distinc-
tion between impulsive and thoughtful consumer decisions. Here 
are the main points of the chapter.
1.	 The law of diminishing marginal utility: As the consumption of a 
product increases, utility increases at a decreasing rate.
2.	 The equimarginal rule: To maximize utility, choose the affordable 
bundle of goods such that the marginal utility per dollar spent 
on one good equals the marginal utility per dollar spent on a 
second good.
3.	 The individual demand curve is negatively sloped because a 
decrease in price (a) decreases the relative price of the good, 
causing consumers to substitute the good for other goods 
(the substitution effect) and (b) increases the consumer’s real 
income, increasing the consumption of all normal goods (the 
income effect).
4.	 For some goods, thoughtful decisions (based on cognition) differ 
from impulsive decisions (based on gut feelings). Some examples 
are food choices (donut vs. apple) and saving decisions (con-
sume now vs. later).
5.	 One explanation for consumers taking gambles that have a neg-
ative expected monetary payoff is that there are brain rewards 
(dopamine) for near misses as well as actual wins.

Traditional Consumer Choice: Utility Theory
Explain the equimarginal principle and apply it to consumer 
choice.
1.1	 Based on Figure 22.1 on page 487, fill in the blanks in 
the following table to identify different points on the 
consumer’s budget line.

1.2	 In Figure 22.1 on page 487, suppose the price of movies 
increases to $9. Draw a new budget line. The horizon-
tal intercept of the budget line is 
 and the 
slope of the budget line is 
.
1.3	 In Figure 22.2 on page 488, if the total utility from 
seven movies is 294 utils, the marginal utility of the 
seventh movie is 
 utils, which is 
 
than the marginal utility of the sixth movie.
1.4	 As the consumption of a product increases, util-
ity 
 (increases/decreases) at a 
 
(increasing/decreasing/constant) rate, so the marginal 
utility curve is 
 sloped. This illustrates the 
law of 
.
1.5	 In Figure 22.3 on page 489, suppose the price of movies 
decreases to $2. The marginal utility per dollar of the 
sixth movie is 
 utils.
1.6	 Suppose Carolyn is on a fixed monthly income of $200 
to spend on food while she is in medical school. Fur-
ther, suppose the price of a single-serving macaroni and 
cheese is $4 and the price of a baguette is $2. Is a con-
sumption combination of 20 macaroni and cheeses and 
60 baguettes possible given these prices and income? 
Justify your answer.
1.7	 Suppose that Joyce has a monthly fixed income of 
$2,000 and has allocated $100 of this income to buy 
shoes and pants. A decrease in the price for shoes but 
not in the price for pants will change the 
 
(slope/intercept) of the budget line.

b.	
1.9	 Suppose a consumer has a fixed amount to spend each 
week on iTunes songs ($1 each) and movies ($6 each). 
For the combination she chose this week, the mar-
ginal utility of movies is 30 and the marginal utility 
of songs is 3. For next week she should 
 
(increase/decrease) the number of songs and 
 
(increase/decrease) the number of movies.
1.10	 Brain imaging provides evidence for the law of 
 utility. (Based on Application 1 on page 493.)
1.11	 Change in Marginal Utility. In Table 22.1 on 
page 492, suppose the marginal utility numbers for 
books change: for each quantity of books, the marginal 
utility is 6 utils higher. For example, for 24 books, the 
marginal utility is 8 utils instead of 2 utils, and for 21 
books, the marginal utility is 10 utils instead of 4 utils. 
Determine the new utility-maximizing bundle.
1.12	 Utility-Maximizing Rides and Games. Suppose the 
price of amusement rides is $2 and the price of a video 
arcade game is $1. The following table shows points 
on the budget line (given an income of $30) and the 
associated marginal utilities. Fill in the blanks in the 
table and find the utility-maximizing combination of 
rides and games. Illustrate with a figure like Figure 22.3 
on page 489.

1.13	 Consumer Consultant. You have been hired to deter-
mine whether a consumer is maximizing his utility. He 
has a fixed budget of $2,500 per month to spend on 
food and housing. The price of food is $1 per pound, 
and the price of housing is $3 per square foot of living 
space. He currently lives in a 600-square foot apart-
ment and spends $700 on food.
a.	 You can ask your client two questions—only two. 
What are your questions?
b.	Your client’s answers indicate that he is indeed max-
imizing utility. What are his answers?
The Law of Demand and the Individual Demand Curve
Describe the income and substitution effects of a price 
change.
2.1	 In Figure 22.5 on page 494, suppose the price of mov-
ies increases from $3 to $6. The increase in price shifts 
the benefit curve (marginal utility per dollar) for mov-
ies 
 (upward/downward). For the initial 
quantity of six movies, the marginal utility per dollar 
becomes 
 utils, which is 
 (greater/
less) than the marginal utility per dollar of books.
All problems are assignable in MyLab Economics.

2.6	 Suppose Maxine initially watches six movies at a price 
of $3 each and buys nine books at a price of $1 each, 
and then the price of movies increases to $5. To make 
Maxine’s original bundle just affordable, her income 
must

Her utility-maximizing consumption of movies will

2.7	 Claudia spends her income on two goods, DVD rent-
als and chewing gum. She considers both goods to be 
normal goods. If Claudia’s income increases and the 
prices of the two goods remain constant, she will rent 
 (more/less) DVDs and purchase 
 
(more/less) chewing gum.
2.8	 Response to the Gas Tax. Petrov initially pays $2,200 
in income taxes and consumes 600 gallons of gasoline 
per year at a price of $3 per gallon. The price of the 
other good is $1. For Petrov’s initial product bundle, 
the marginal utility of gas is 30 utils and the marginal 
utility of the other good is 10 utils. (Related to Applica-
tion 2 on page 497.)
a.	 For his initial bundle, the marginal utility per dollar 
on gasoline is 
 utils.
b.	Suppose the government imposes a new gasoline 
tax that increases the price of gas to $5. To make 
his initial consumer bundle just affordable, Petrov’s 
income must 
 (increase/decrease) by 
.
c.	 Suppose the government cuts Petrov’s income tax 
by the amount computed in (b). Given the new gas 
tax and the income tax cut, at his initial bundle, the 
marginal utility per dollar of gasoline is 
 
utils, compared to 
 for the other good. To 
satisfy the marginal principle, Petrov will 
 
(increase/decrease) his gasoline consumption.
2.9	 Shipping the Good Apples Out? Suppose apples come 
in two quality levels, low and high. At a store in the 
apple-growing region, the price of low-quality apples 
is $1 per pound, and the price of high-quality apples is 
$4 per pound. Johnny lives in the apple-growing region 
and buys 8 pounds of each type. His marginal utility of 
apples is 3 utils for low-quality apples and 12 utils for 
high-quality apples.
a.	 Is Johnny maximizing his utility?
b.	Suppose Johnny moves to an area outside the apple-
growing region. Shipping the apples to his new area 
adds $2 to the price of a pound of apples, for both 
low-quality and high-quality apples. To simplify 
matters, assume Johnny’s income increases by an 
amount large enough to fully offset the higher prices 
of apples. In other words, he can still afford the orig-
inal bundle of 8 pounds of each type of apples. If he 

511
continues to buy 8 pounds of apples of each type, 
is he maximizing his utility? If not, how should he 
change his mix of high- and low-quality apples?
c.	 What are the implications for the mix of high-­
quality and low-quality apples in apple-growing 
areas and other regions?
Neuroscience of Consumer Choice

benefits and costs of a consumer good.
3.1	 The key region of the brain for the valuation of benefits 
is the

3.2	 In the dopamine learning system, learning happens 
when the

are

3.3	 The key region of the brain for the valuation of costs 
is the

3.4	 In the Iowa Gambling Task, the brain sends an alarm 
to avoid drawing from the unfavorable decks after 
about 
 (3, 10, 25, 50, 75) cards, but the typi-
cal subject doesn’t switch to the favorable decks until 
about 
 (3, 10, 25, 50, 75) cards.
3.5	 The strength of brain activity involving benefit valua-
tion associated with a particular product is determined 
by  
.
3.6	 The greater the conjectured satisfaction a person expe-
riences when buying a product, the greater the flow of

3.7	 In the Pepsi Challenge, a majority of consumers favored 
Pepsi in 
 taste tests, but Coke 
 
taste tests. (Related to Application 3 on page 502.)
Consumer Decisions: Insights from Neuroscience
Apply the insights from neuroscience to consumer decisions 
about nutrition and saving.

Mental Shortcuts And Consumer Puzzles
Although the brain has billions of cells and trillions of synapses to process information 
and make decisions, the decision-making process is far from perfect. Mental process-
ing takes time and energy, and the brain uses a number of time-saving shortcuts that 
sometimes lead to puzzling and misguided decisions. Economists and psychologists 
have identified several types of puzzling consumer behavior:
• Spending choices sometimes depends on the source of income.
• The willingness to pay for a product sometimes is affected by irrelevant 
information.
• Product choices are sometimes influenced by irrelevant alternatives.
• Decisions are sometimes based on percentage differences rather than absolute 
differences.
These are ongoing puzzles in the sense that we do not fully understand the mental 
processes behind what appears to be misguided consumer behavior.
One possible explanation for a consumer puzzle is that people sometimes base 
their decisions on heuristics. A heuristic is a simple rule for dealing with a complex 
situation, and provides a “fast and frugal” decision. A simple rule may work well in 
most circumstances, but in some cases may generate misguided choices. In the case of 
misguided choices generated by heuristics, a key question concerns the motivation for 
the heuristic: What are the advantages of using a heuristic rather than a more thought-
ful and deliberative decision-making process?
22A.1	
Mental Accounting and Bundling
One way to economize on decision making is to separate decisions into different 
types or accounts. For example, a consumer could establish separate accounts for 
food ($300 per month) and entertainment ($100 per month). If the price of a par-
ticular food increases, the consumer would reallocate its fixed food budget, but would 
not consider changing its entertainment budget. This shortcut—known as mental 
accounting—simplifies the decision-making process because it limits the calculation 
of trade-offs.
An important application of mental accounting concerns the classification of money 
from different sources. Consider the treatment of income that comes unexpectedly, for 
example, a $50 birthday gift or $50 found on the street. For many people, unexpected 
income is “play money” that is frequently spent on fun or frivolous purchases. In con-
trast, people are more careful with regular income, allocating it to buying regular 
goods, paying bills, and saving. Who would blame you for spending birthday cash on 
a restaurant meal rather than paying down your credit card or putting the money into 
your savings account? Similarly, money picked up off the street is considered “fun 
money” and not spent in the same way as regular income.
Another mental shortcut is to monitor consumption by bundles rather than 
individual units. People tend to track consumption by the bundles in which a product

cent advances in neuroscience to consumer choice.

ence and Choice (Academic Press, 2012).

is delivered rather than the actual consumption of the product. In a famous experi-
ment, people had the opportunity to use a scoop to get free M&Ms from a bowl. 
When the experimenters switched to a larger scoop, people continued to get roughly 
the same number of scoops, but of course a lot more M&Ms. In other words, people 
monitor their consumption by scoops (bundles) of the product, not the actual quan-
tity of the product. In another experiment, diners were provided a bottomless bowl 
of soup: using a secret tube, the experimenters refilled the bowl every time the 
diner consumed some soup. The result was consistent with the notion of consumer 
bundling: the subjects drank much more soup than people drawing from a normal 
bowl of soup.
22A.2	
Anchoring
Another mental shortcut is called anchoring. Suppose the brain is asked to compute the 
numerical value of something, for example, the amount you are willing to pay for a car 
or a house. In computing a numerical value, the brain tends to latch onto numbers in a 
seemingly random way. In the classic experiment, each participant writes down the last 
two digits of his or her Social Security number and then bids (expresses a willingness 
to pay) for a t-shirt. The bizarre result is the larger the participant’s Social Security 
number, the higher the bid on the t-shirt. In other words, the Social Security number 
provides an anchor for an unrelated mental task.
There are some important implications of the anchoring effect. A person’s 
expressed valuation of a product is affected by the numbers in his or her head. In a 
negotiation over the price of a product, the seller has an incentive to plant a relatively 
large number in the buyer’s head, while the buyer has incentive to plant a low number 
in the seller’s head. One way to plant an anchoring number is to be the first to state a 
price. In other words, there is a first-mover advantage in negotiations over price. This 
provides one reason for relatively high (and negotiable) sticker prices on new and used 
cars. Using a high price as an anchor, a buyer can negotiate a lower price and feel good 
about getting a bargain, while the seller can get less than the anchor price but more 
than his or her true willingness to accept.
The notion of anchoring helps explain the large effects of “sales” for retail goods. 
The regular price of a product provides an anchor for your underlying value of the 
product. When a product goes on sale at a 20 percent discount, it looks like a great deal, 
given your anchor, the regular price. So a store that has a 20 percent off sale is likely to 
experience a relatively large increase in the quantity sold.
22A.3	
The Decoy Effect
One of the most puzzling quirks of consumer decision making is the decoy effect. Con-
sider the options for an MP3 player represented in Figure 22A.1. In the left panel, there 
are two options: a low-price player with a capacity of 8 GB (option A), and a high-price 
player with a capacity of 16 GB (option B). Suppose that in a direct comparison of A 
versus B, a consumer chooses A: when the consumer considers the trade-offs between 
price and capacity, the extra 8 GB of capacity is not worth the additional $100. In a 
direct comparison, A is superior to B.
The right panel introduces a third option, a decoy. Option C has the same capac-
ity as option B, but its price is $20 higher. The comparison of B versus C is quick 
and easy: The consumer doesn’t have to think about any trade-offs, but simply rec-
ognizes that the extra $20 spent on C doesn’t buy anything. The typical consumer 
will then choose option B over options A and C. The consumer focuses on the easy 
comparison of B versus C, and neglects the more difficult task of comparing B to A. 
The introduction of a clearly inferior option (the decoy C) changes the consumer’s 
choice from A to B.

515
The decoy effect occurs for all sorts of preferences and decisions. In a standard 
decoy-effect experiment, each person in a control group is shown three faces (A, B, C) 
and asked to choose the most attractive face. Suppose the control group chooses A as 
the most attractive and C as the least attractive. For the treatment group, a fourth face 
(C-) is introduced, one that is similar to face C (the least attractive face) but just a bit 
less attractive. When the treatment group looks at four faces (A, B, C, C-) the par-
ticipants tend to focus on the comparable faces C and C-, and ignore faces A and B. 
As a result, the treatment group picks C, not A, as the most attractive face. The decoy 
focuses attention on comparable faces and diverts attention from the most attractive 
face and thus changes the outcome.
The decoy effect has important implications for consumer decision making. 
­Marketers have an incentive to introduce products that are not designed to sell, but are 
designed to manipulate consumers into choosing a similar but superior product. A savvy 
consumer can use cognition to avoid being fooled by the decoy effect. If you can identify 
a decoy and recognize the slightly better product, you could then continue evaluating 
the other options, rather than stopping your valuation prematurely. Assessing trade-offs 
is cognitively challenging, but may be worthwhile.
22A.4	
The Appeal of Percentage Changes
People use another mental shortcut to assess numerical changes, for example an increase 
in price. The natural inclination is to translate a numerical change into a percentage 
change. For example, a change in price from $1.00 to $0.90 is a 10 percent change, and 
so is a change from $200 to $180. The translation into percentages means that all 10 
percent changes appear to be alike, despite the fact that 10 percent of $200 is much larger 
than 10 percent of $1.00.
The percentage shortcut can lead to misguided decisions. In the classic demonstra-
tion of percentage bias, we ask a consumer two questions:
1	 Would you drive a dozen miles to save 10 percent on a quart of milk?
2	 Would you drive a dozen miles to save 3 percent on a new chair?
The typical consumer responds “yes” to the first question and “no” to the second ques-
tion. In other words, the 10 percent savings on milk is worthwhile, but the 3 percent 
savings on a new chair is not. This is puzzling and illogical because a chair is much more 
expensive than milk. The numerical savings associated with 10 percent off a $1.00 quart 
of milk is only $0.10, but the numerical savings associated with 3 percent off a $200 chair 
is $6.00. If it is sensible to drive a dozen miles to save $0.10, why isn’t it sensible to drive 
the same distance to save $6.00? In assessing numerical changes, the brain appears to be

In this appendix to the chapter on consumer choice we’ve discussed 
some puzzling aspects of consumers’ behavior. Here are the main 
points of the appendix:
1	 Spending choices sometimes depend on the source of income.
2	 The willingness to pay for a product sometimes is affected by 
irrelevant information.
3	 Choices are sometimes influenced by irrelevant alternatives.
4	 Decisions are sometimes based on percentage differences rather 
than absolute differences.

naturally inclined to work in percentage or relative terms rather than absolute terms, 
leading to misguided decisions.
As an application of the percentage shortcut, consider the provision of Internet 
service in hotels. A hotel can either include Internet service as part of its room charges, 
or have a separate charge. In general, low-price hotels include Internet service as part 
of the room charge, while high-price hotels have a separate charge. In a low-price hotel 
($50 per night), a separate charge of $10 per day is a 20 percent surcharge, a relatively 
large surcharge in percentage terms. Consumers subject to percentage bias are likely 
to react strongly to the seemingly large surcharge. In a hotel with a price of $200 per 
night, a separate charge of $10 is only 5 percent of the price, a small enough percentage 
that the consumer response is likely to be relatively small.

Consider the challenge of provid-
ing safe water to rural families in 
less developed countries.
In India, the conventional approach is for each family to 
use an individual carbon-activated filter, at a monthly 
cost of $2 per month. The alternative approach devel-
oped by the Byrraju Foundation exploits economies 
of scale in water filtration. A community filtration plant 
with a capital cost of $15,000 can provide clean water 
to 1,500 families at a monthly cost of only $1 per fam-
ily. An added advantage of the filtration plant is that 
villagers can pay for water on a daily basis rather than 
being required to come up with large amounts of cash 
to buy the individual filter and replacement cartridges.1

To compute a firm’s economic cost, we must determine what the firm sacrifices to use 
inputs in the production process. Economic cost is opportunity cost.
As shown in the first column of numbers in Table 23.1, a firm’s economic cost can 
be divided into two types. A firm’s explicit cost is its actual monetary payments for 
inputs. For example, if a firm spends a total of $10,000 per month on labor, capital, and 
materials, its explicit cost is $10,000. This is an opportunity cost because money spent 
on these inputs cannot be used to buy something else. A firm’s implicit cost is the 
opportunity cost of the inputs that do not require a monetary payment. Here are two 
examples of inputs whose costs are implicit rather than explicit:
explicit cost
A monetary payment.
implicit cost
An opportunity cost that does not involve 
a monetary payment.
T
his chapter explores the relationship between the quantity of output produced 
and the cost of production. As we’ll see, a firm’s production cost is determined 
by its production technology—the way the firm combines capital, labor, and 
materials to produce output. After we explain the link between technology and costs, 
we look at the actual cost curves of several products, including aluminum, hospital 
services, wind power, truck freight, and airplanes.
Economists distinguish between the short run and the long run. The long run is a 
period long enough that a firm is perfectly flexible in its choice of all inputs, including 
its production facility. In contrast, when a firm cannot modify its facility, it is operating 
in the short run. In this chapter, we explore both short-run and long-run costs. In later 
chapters, we show how firms use short-run and long-run cost curves to make decisions 
about whether to enter a market and how much output to produce.
Economic Cost and Economic Profit
This is the first of several chapters on the decisions firms make. A firm’s objective is to 
maximize its economic profit, which equals its total revenue minus its economic cost:
economic profit = total revenue - economic cost
As we saw earlier in the book, a firm’s total revenue is the money it gets from selling 
its product. If a firm charges the same price to every consumer, its total revenue equals 
the price per unit of output times the quantity sold.
This chapter explores the firm’s cost of production. A firm’s economic cost equals 
the cost of all the inputs used in the production process; we measure it as the opportu-
nity cost of the inputs. Recall the first key principle of economics.

• Opportunity cost of the entrepreneur’s time. If an entrepreneur could earn 
$5,000 per month in another job, the opportunity cost of the time spent run-
ning the firm is $5,000 per month.
• Opportunity cost of the entrepreneur’s funds. Many entrepreneurs use their own 
funds to set up and run their businesses. If an entrepreneur starts a business with 
$200,000 withdrawn from a savings account, the opportunity cost is the interest 
income the funds could have earned in the bank, for example, $2,000 per month.

Chapter 23 • Production Technology and Cost

Economic cost equals explicit cost plus implicit cost:
economic cost = explicit cost + implicit cost
In the first column of Table 23.1, the firm’s economic cost is $17,000, equal to $10,000 
in explicit cost plus $7,000 in implicit cost.
Accountants have a different approach to computing costs. Their narrower defini-
tion of cost includes only the explicit cost of inputs:
accounting cost = explicit cost
In other words, accounting cost includes the monetary payments for inputs, but 
ignores the opportunity cost of inputs that do not require an explicit monetary pay-
ment. In the second column of Table 23.1, the accounting cost is the $10,000 in mon-
etary payments for labor, capital, and materials. Accounting profit equals total revenue 
minus accounting cost:
accounting profit = total revenue - accounting cost
A firm’s accounting cost is always lower than its economic cost, so its accounting profit 
is always higher than its economic profit. For the rest of this book, when we refer to cost 
and profit, we mean economic cost and economic profit. 
A Firm with a Fixed Production Facility: Short-Run Costs
Consider first the case of a firm with a fixed production facility. Suppose you have 
decided to start a small firm to produce plastic paddles for rafts. The production of 
paddles requires a workshop where workers use molds to form plastic material into 
paddles. Before we can discuss the cost of production, we need information about the 
nature of the production process.
Production and Marginal Product
The table in Figure 23.1 shows how the quantity of paddles produced varies with the 
number of workers. A single worker in the workshop produces one paddle per day. 
Adding a second worker increases the quantity produced to five paddles per day. The 
marginal product of labor is the change in output from one additional unit of labor. 
In the table, the marginal product of the first worker is one paddle, compared to a 
marginal product of four paddles for the second worker.

Opportunity Cost and Entrepreneurship
Applying the Concepts #1: What is the Opportunity Cost of an Entrepreneur?
For many workers, participation in the sharing economy as a 
driver for Uber or Lyft is an attractive way to earn an income. 
The cost of driving for Uber includes the opportunity cost of 
time diverted from working at a regular job. If a regular job pays 
a salary of $3,000 per month, that’s only part of the opportunity 
cost. In addition, many regular jobs have fringe benefits such 
as paid sick leave, vacation days, and subsidized health insur-
ance. Driving for Uber doesn’t generate these fringe benefits, so 
a worker who switches from a regular job to Uber will sacrifice 
more than the $3,000 salary.  Related to Exercise 1.8.

▲  Figure 23.1  Total-Product Curve
The total-product curve shows the relationship between the quantity of labor and the quantity of output, 
given a fixed production facility. For the first two workers, output increases at an increasing rate because 
of labor specialization. Diminishing returns occurs for three or more workers, so output increases at a 
decreasing rate.

Suppose output is produced with two or more inputs and we 
increase one input while holding the other inputs fixed. Beyond 
some point—called the point of diminishing returns—output will 
increase at a decreasing rate.
The third worker adds three paddles to total output, down from four paddles for the 
second worker. As the firm continues to hire more workers, the marginal product 
drops to two paddles for the fourth worker and one paddle for the fifth worker. As we 
saw earlier in the book, diminishing returns occurs because each worker gets a smaller

Why does the marginal product increase as output increases? As we saw earlier 
in the book, when a firm increases its workforce, workers can specialize in production 
tasks. Productivity increases because of the benefits of continuity—each worker spends 
less time switching between production tasks. In addition, there are benefits from 
repetition—each worker becomes more proficient at an assigned task. A two-worker 
operation produces more than twice as many paddles as a one-person operation because 
the two workers can specialize, one being responsible for preparing the plastic for the 
mold and the other for working the mold.
Starting with the third worker, the production process is subject to diminishing 
returns, one of the key principles of economics.
diminishing returns
As one input increases while the other 
inputs are held fixed, output increases at a 
decreasing rate.

Chapter 23 • Production Technology and Cost
521
To compute the firm’s total cost, we simply add the fixed and variable costs. The 
firm’s short-run total cost (TC) equals the sum of fixed and variable costs:
TC = FC + VC
The fifth column in Table 23.2 shows the total cost for different quantities of output. 
For example, one worker produces one paddle at a total cost of $150, equal to the fixed 
cost of $100 plus a variable cost of $50. Hiring a second worker increases output to five 
paddles and increases total cost to $200, equal to $100 in fixed cost and $100 in variable 
cost. Moving down the fifth column, the total cost rises to $250 for 8 units of output, 
$300 for 10 units, and so on.
short-run total cost (TC)
The total cost of production when at least 
one input is fixed; equal to fixed cost plus 
variable cost.
share of the production facility. In the paddle example, the workers share a mold; as the 
number of workers increases, they will spend more time waiting to use it.
Figure 23.1 shows the firm’s total-product curve, which represents the relation-
ship between the quantity of labor (on the horizontal axis) and output (on the vertical 
axis), ceteris paribus. The total-product curve shows the effects of labor specialization as 
well as diminishing returns. For the first two workers, output increases at an increasing 
rate because labor specialization increases the marginal product of labor. Starting with 
the third worker, however, total output increases at a decreasing rate because of dimin-
ishing returns. 
Short-Run Total Cost
We’ve seen the production relationship between labor input and output, so we’re ready 
to show the relationship between output and production cost. Suppose the opportunity 
cost of your time is $50 per day, and you can hire workers for your workshop at the 
market wage of $50 per day. You can purchase your workshop, including the building 
and the paddle mold, for $365,000. If the interest rate you could have earned on that 
money is 10 percent per year, the opportunity cost of tying up your $365,000 in the 
workshop is $36,500 per year, or $100 per day.
In the short-run analysis of costs, we divide production costs into two types, fixed 
cost and variable cost.
• Fixed cost (FC) is the cost that does not vary with the quantity produced. In our 
example, the fixed cost is the cost of the workshop, including the cost of the 
building and the mold. As shown in the third column of Table 23.2, the fixed 
cost is $100 per day, regardless of how much output is produced.
• Variable cost (VC) is the cost that varies with the quantity produced. For exam-
ple, to produce more paddles, you must hire more workers. If the cost per worker 
is $50 per day, your daily variable cost is $50 times the number of workers, 
including you. As shown in the fourth column of Table 23.2, variable cost is $50 
for one worker, $100 for two workers, and so on.

Short-Run Average Costs
There are three types of average cost. Average fixed cost (AFC) equals the fixed cost 
divided by the quantity produced:
AFC = FC
Q
To compute AFC for our paddle company, we simply divide the fixed cost ($100) by 
the quantity of paddles produced. In Table 23.2, we divide the number in column 3 
by the number in column 2. This calculation gives us the values for AFC, which are 
shown in column 6. For example, the output in the second row is one paddle, so the 
average fixed cost is $100 = $100/1. In the third row, output is five paddles, so the 
average fixed cost is $20 = $100/5. As output increases, the $100 fixed cost is spread 
over more units, so AFC decreases.
A firm’s average variable cost (AVC) incorporates the costs that vary with the 
quantity produced. Average variable cost equals the variable cost divided by the quan-
tity produced:
AVC = VC
Q
To compute AVC for our paddle company, we simply divide the number in column 4 
of Table 23.2 by the number in column 2. That calculation gives us the values for 
AVC, shown in column 7. For example, the output in the third row is five paddles 
and the variable cost is $100, so the average variable cost is $100/5 paddles, or $20. 
Notice that for small quantities of output, the AVC decreases as the quantity produced 
increases—from $50 for one paddle, $20 for two paddles, and so on. The AVC declines 
because of the benefits of labor specialization. Adding workers to a small workforce

Figure 23.2 shows the short-run cost curves corresponding to columns 3, 4, 
and 5 of Table 23.2. The horizontal line on the graph shows the fixed cost of $100. 
The lower of the two positively sloped curves shows the variable cost (VC), and the 
higher of the two positively sloped curves is total cost (TC). Total cost is the sum of 
fixed cost and variable cost, so the vertical distance between the TC curve and the 
VC curve equals the firm’s fixed cost. Notice that this distance is the same at any 
level of output.

The short-run total-cost curve shows the relationship between the quantity of output and production 
costs, given a fixed production facility. Short-run total cost equals fixed cost (the cost that does not vary 
with the quantity produced) plus variable cost (the cost that varies with the quantity produced).

The ATC curve in Figure 23.3 is negatively sloped at quantities less than 10 pad-
dles. The negative slope results from two forces that work together to push average 
cost down as output increases:
• Spreading the fixed cost. For small quantities of output, a one-unit increase in 
output reduces AFC by a large amount because the fixed cost is pretty “thick,” 
being spread over just a few units of output. For example, going from one paddle 
to five paddles decreases AFC from $100 to $20 per paddle.
• Labor specialization. For small quantities of output, AVC decreases as output 
increases because labor specialization increases worker productivity.
These two forces both push ATC downward as output increases, so the curve is nega-
tively sloped for small quantities of output.
What happens once the firm reaches the point at which the benefits of labor spe-
cialization are exhausted? As the firm continues to increase output beyond that point, 
the average variable cost increases because of diminishing returns. There is a tug-of-war 
makes workers more productive on average, so the amount of labor required per unit of 
output drops, pushing down the average variable cost. In contrast, for large quantities 
of output, average variable cost increases as output increases because of diminishing 
returns. Adding workers to a large workforce makes workers less productive on average, 
pulling up the average variable cost. In Figure 23.3, the AVC curve is negatively sloped 
for small quantities, but positively sloped for large quantities.
A firm’s total cost is the sum of its fixed cost and variable cost, so the short-run 
average total cost (ATC), or what we simply call “average cost,” is the sum of the 
average fixed cost and the average variable cost:
ATC = TC
Q = FC
Q + VC
Q
= AFC + AVC
In Figure 23.3, we go from the AVC to ATC by adding the average fixed cost to AVC. 
For example, for five paddles AFC is $20 and AVC is $20, so ATC is equal to $40, the 
sum of $20 + $20. For 10 paddles, the average fixed cost is lower—only $10—while 
the average variable cost is $20, so ATC is $30, the sum of $10 + $20. In Figure 23.3, 
the gap between the AVC and ATC curves is the average fixed cost.
short-run average total cost (ATC)
Short-run total cost divided by the quan-
tity produced; equal to AFC plus AVC.
▲  Figure 23.3  Short-Run Average Costs
The short-run average-total-cost curve (ATC) is U-shaped. As the quantity produced increases, fixed 
costs are spread over more and more units, pushing down the average total cost. In contrast, as the 
quantity increases, diminishing returns eventually pulls up the average total cost. The gap between ATC 
and AVC is the average fixed cost (AFC).

between two forces: The spreading of fixed cost continues to push ATC down, while 
diminishing returns and rising average variable cost pull ATC up. The outcome of the 
tug-of-war varies with the quantity produced, giving the ATC curve its U-shape:
• Intermediate quantities of output, such as output between 3 and 10 paddles. 
The tug-of-war is won by the spreading of fixed cost because the fixed cost is 
still relatively “thick” and diminishing returns are not yet very strong. As a result, 
ATC decreases as output increases. For example, at 5 paddles ATC is $40, but at 
10 paddles ATC drops to only $30.
• Large quantities of output, such as 11 or more paddles. The tug-of-war is won 
by diminishing returns and rising average variable cost. In this case, the reduc-
tions in AFC are relatively small because the fixed cost is already spread pretty 
thinly and diminishing returns are severe. As a result, ATC increases as output 
increases. For example, at 10 paddles ATC is $30, but at 11.5 paddles ATC jumps 
to $34.78. 
Short-Run Marginal Cost
The short-run marginal cost (MC) is the change in short-run total cost per unit 
change in output. In other words, it is the increase in total cost resulting from a one-
unit increase in output. Mathematically, marginal cost is calculated by dividing the 
change in total cost (TC) by the change in output (Q):
MC = ∆TC
∆Q =
change in TC
change in output
The marginal cost of the first paddle is the increase in cost when the firm produces 
the first paddle. To produce the first unit of output, the firm hires a single worker at 
$50. As shown in column 9 of Table 23.2, the marginal cost of the first paddle is $50. 
Moving down the ninth column, hiring the second worker for $50 increases output 
to five paddles. A $50 increase in total cost increases output by four paddles, so the 
marginal cost is $12.50:
MC = ∆TC
∆Q =
change in TC
change in output = $50
4
= $12.50
In this case, marginal cost decreases as output increases because of labor special-
ization and rising worker productivity. The first worker produces just one paddle, but 
adding a second worker increases output by four paddles. The $50 expense of adding 
the second worker translates into a $12.50 expense for each of the four extra paddles 
produced. We saw earlier that specialization leads to increasing marginal productivity. 
Now we know that specialization also leads to decreasing marginal cost. In Figure 23.4, 
the short-run marginal-cost curve is negatively sloped for the first five paddles.
The positively sloped portion of the marginal-cost curve is a result of dimin-
ishing returns. Hiring the third worker increases output from five to eight, so the 
$50 expense translates into a $16.67 expense for each of the three extra paddles 
produced. Diminishing returns has set in, so marginal cost increases as output 
increases. The marginal cost increases to $25 for between 8 and 10 paddles ($50/2 
paddles), then increases to $50 for between 10 and 11 paddles ($50/1 paddle), and 
so on. In general, diminishing returns decreases labor productivity and causes ris-
ing marginal cost. 
The Relationship between Marginal Cost and Average Cost
Figure 23.4 shows the relationship between short-run marginal cost and short-run 
average total cost. Whenever the marginal cost is less than the average cost (for fewer 
than 10 paddles), the average cost is falling. In contrast, whenever the marginal cost 
exceeds the average cost (for more than 10 paddles), the average cost is rising. Finally,

when the marginal cost equals the average cost, the average cost is neither rising nor 
falling. Therefore, the marginal-cost curve intersects the short-run average total cost 
curve at its minimum point.
We can use some simple logic to explain the relationship between average and 
marginal cost. Suppose that you start the semester with nine completed courses and a 
cumulative grade-point average of 3.0. In the first row of Table 23.3, you have 27 grade 
points (4 points for each A, 3 points for each B, and so on), so your GPA is 3.0, which 
is 27 points divided by 9 courses. You enroll in a single course this semester—a history 
course. Your new GPA will depend on your grade in the history course, the marginal 
grade. There are three possibilities:
• Marginal grade less than the average grade. In the second row of Table 23.3,  
if you get a D in history, your grade point total increases from 27 points 
to 28 points. Dividing the new total by 10 courses, your new GPA is 2.80. 
It’s lower because your marginal grade of 1.0 is less than the old average 
grade of 3.0.
• Marginal grade equal to the average grade. In the third row of Table 23.3, 
if you get a B in history, your grade point total increases from 27 points to 
30 points. Dividing the new total by 10 courses, your new GPA is 3.0. It 
hasn’t changed because your marginal grade of 3.0 equals the old average 
grade of 3.0.
• Marginal grade greater than the average grade. In the fourth row of Table 23.3,  
if you get an A in history, your grade point total increases from 27 points to 31 
points, so your new GPA is 3.10. It’s higher because your marginal grade of 4.0 
is greater than the old average grade of 3.0.
To summarize, whenever the marginal grade is less than the average grade, the aver-
age will fall; whenever the marginal grade exceeds the average grade, the average will 
rise; and whenever the marginal grade equals the average grade, the average will not 
change.

The marginal-cost curve (MC) is negatively sloped for small quantities of output because of the benefits 
of labor specialization, and positively sloped for large quantities because of diminishing returns. The MC

Production and Cost in the Long Run
Up to this point, we’ve been exploring short-run cost curves, which show the cost of 
producing different quantities of output in a given production facility. We turn next 
to long-run cost curves, which show production costs in facilities of different sizes. 
The long run is defined as the period of time over which a firm is perfectly flexible in 
its choice of all inputs. In the long run, a firm can build a new production facility such 
as a factory, store, office, or restaurant. Another option in the long run is to modify an 
existing facility.
The key difference between the short run and the long run is that there are no 
diminishing returns in the long run. Recall that diminishing returns occur because 
workers share a fixed production facility, so the larger the number of workers in the 
facility, the smaller the share of the facility available for each worker. In the long run, 
a firm can expand its production facility as its workforce grows, so there are no dimin-
ishing returns.
Expansion and Replication
Continuing the example of paddle production, suppose you have decided to replace 
your existing workshop with a new one. You have been producing 10 paddles per day 
at a total cost of $300 per day, or an average cost of $30 per paddle. Suppose a company

The Rising Marginal Cost of Crude Oil

for 65 million barrels per day. The marginal cost then starts to 
increase rapidly, to roughly $80 per barrel for 75 million barrels 
per day (the quantity produced in early 2015).
The marginal cost curve reflects variation in the cost of 
extracting oil from different sources. Starting at the low end of 
the cost curve, the marginal cost is relatively low for nations in 
the Middle East (including Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emir-
ates) and Russia. In the intermediate range, marginal cost is 
higher for oil from the North Sea, oil sands projects in Canada, 
and conventional onshore sources in the U.S. At the upper end 
of the cost curve, the marginal cost is relatively high for oil from 
the Arctic, biodiesel, and ethanol.   Related to Exercise 2.8.

How does the marginal cost of producing crude oil for the world 
market change as the volume of oil increases? For the first 
40 million barrels per day, the marginal cost is less than $10 per 
barrel. The marginal cost increases at a moderate rate for the 
next 25 million barrels per day, up to roughly $20 per barrel

that sponsors rafting adventures orders new paddles, and you decide to produce twice 
as much output in your new facility. What should you do?
One possibility is simply to double the original operation. You could build two 
workshops identical to the original shop and hire two workforces, each identical to 
the original workforce. In the table in Figure 23.5, your firm moves from the third 
row of numbers (four workers and $100 worth of capital produces 10 paddles per day) 
to the fourth row, with twice as much labor, capital, and output. A firm’s long-run 
total cost (LTC) is the total cost of production when the firm is perfectly flexible in 
choosing its inputs, including its production facility. As shown in column 5 of the table 
in Figure 23.5, if your firm doubles its output from 10 paddles to 20 paddles, the 
long-run total cost doubles too, from $300 to $600.

visible inputs and the effects of labor specialization. If the firm replicates the operation that produces 10 
paddles per day, the long-run average-cost curve will be horizontal beyond 10 paddles per day.

The firm’s long-run average cost (LAC) equals the long-run cost divided by the 
quantity produced. As shown in column 6 of the table in Figure 23.5, doubling output 
from 10 to 20 paddles doesn’t change the long-run average cost because doubling 
output by doubling both labor and capital increases costs proportionately. In the graph 
in Figure 23.5, point b shows the average cost with 10 paddles and point c shows the 
average cost with 20 paddles. As the quantity produced increases, the average cost 
doesn’t change, so the average-cost curve is horizontal over this range of output. This 
is the case of constant returns to scale: As a firm scales up its operation, costs increase 
proportionately with output, so average cost is constant.

The same logic applies to larger output levels. Your firm could build a third work-
shop identical to the first two workshops, and its production costs will increase propor-
tionately, from $600 to $900. In the table in Figure 23.5, the average cost for 30 paddles 
is $30, the same as for 10 and 20 paddles. In general, the replication process means 
the long-run total cost increases proportionately with the quantity produced, so the 
average cost is constant. In Figure 23.5, the long-run average-cost curve is horizontal 
for 10 or more paddles per day. In other words, there are constant returns to scale for 
output levels of 10 or more paddles.
We’ve seen that if a firm wants to double its output in the long run, replica-
tion is one option. By simply replicating an existing operation, a firm can double 
its output and its total costs, leaving average cost unchanged. Another possibility 
is to build a single larger workshop, one that can produce twice as much output 
at a lower cost than would be possible by simply replicating the original. If so, 
the long-run average cost of producing 20 or 30 paddles would be less than $30 
per paddle.
A firm’s long-run marginal cost (LMC) is the change in long-run cost resulting 
from producing one more unit of output. In the long run, the firm is perfectly flexible 
in choosing its inputs. Therefore, LMC is the increase in cost when the firm can change 
its production facility as well as its workforce. 
Reducing Output with Indivisible Inputs
What would happen if you decide to produce only 5 paddles per day instead of 10? 
Although it’s tempting to think that your total costs would be cut in half, that’s not 
necessarily the case. Remember that you use a single mold to produce 10 paddles 
per day. If you cut your output in half, you would still need the mold, so your capital 
costs won’t be cut in half. In addition, if each mold requires a fixed amount of floor 
space, you would still need the same floor space. Therefore, cutting output in half 
wouldn’t decrease the cost of your production facility at all. You would still have a 
cost of $100 per day for the mold and the workspace. Because cutting output in half 
doesn’t cut capital costs in half, the average cost for producing 5 paddles will exceed 
the average cost for 10 paddles.
The mold is an example of an indivisible input, one that we cannot scale down to 
produce a smaller quantity of output. When a production process requires the use of 
indivisible inputs, the average cost of production increases as output decreases because 
the cost of the indivisible inputs is spread over a smaller quantity of output. Most pro-
duction operations use some indivisible inputs, but the costs of these inputs vary. Here 
are some examples of firms and their indivisible inputs:
• A railroad company uses tracks to provide freight service between two cities. The 
company cannot scale down by laying a half set of tracks—a single rail.
• A shipping firm uses a large ship to carry TV sets from Japan to the United 
States. The company can’t scale back by transporting TVs in rowboats.
• A steel producer uses a large blast furnace. The company can’t scale back by 
producing steel in a toaster oven.
• A hospital uses imaging machines for X-rays, CAT scans, and MRIs. The hos-
pital can’t scale back by getting mini-MRI machines.
The second row of the table in Figure 23.5 shows labor and capital costs in the 
smaller operation. Suppose that to produce five paddles, you’ll need two workers, 
including yourself. In this case, your labor cost will be $100. Adding the $100 cost 
of the indivisible input (the mold and shop space), the total cost of producing five 
paddles per day will be $200, or $40 per paddle. This cost exceeds the average cost of 
10 paddles because in the smaller operation you still need the same amount of capital. 
In Figure 23.5, point a shows that the average cost of five paddles per day exceeds the 
average cost for larger quantities.

Chapter 23 • Production Technology and Cost
529
Scaling Down and Labor Specialization
A second possible reason for higher average long-run costs in a smaller operation is that 
labor will be less specialized in the small operation. As we saw earlier in the chapter, 
labor specialization—each worker specializing in an individual production task—makes 
workers more productive because of continuity and repetition. Reversing this process, 
when we reduce the workforce each worker will become less specialized, performing 
a wider variety of production tasks. The loss of specialization will decrease labor pro-
ductivity, leading to higher average cost.
To see the role of labor specialization, consider the first row of numbers in the 
table in Figure 23.5. To produce one paddle per day, the firm needs a full day of work 
by one worker. The single worker performs all production tasks and is less productive 
than the specialized workers in larger operations. This is one reason for the relatively 
high average cost in a one-paddle operation ($150). The second reason is that the cost 
of the indivisible input is spread over fewer paddles. 
Economies of Scale
A firm experiences economies of scale if the long-run average cost of production 
decreases as output increases, meaning that the long-run average-cost curve is nega-
tively sloped. In Figure 23.5 on page 527, the paddle producer experiences economies 
of scale between points a and b. At point a, the long-run average cost is $40, com-
pared to $30 at point b and beyond. An increase in output from 5 to 10 paddles 
decreases the long-run average cost of production because the firm spreads the cost 
of an indivisible input over a larger quantity, decreasing average cost. In other words, 
there are some economies—cost savings—associated with scaling up the firm’s 
operation.
One way to quantify the extent of scale economies in the production of a particular 
good is to determine the minimum efficient scale for producing the good. The 
­minimum efficient scale is defined as the output at which scale economies are 
exhausted. In Figure 23.5, the long-run average-cost curve becomes horizontal at 
point b, so the minimum efficient scale is 10 paddles. If a firm starts out with a quantity 
of output below the minimum efficient scale, an increase in output will decrease the 
average cost. Once the minimum efficient scale has been reached, the average cost no 
longer decreases as output increases. 
Diseconomies of Scale
A positively sloped long-run average-cost curve indicates the presence of disecono-
mies of scale. In this case, average cost increases as output increases. Diseconomies of 
scale can occur for two reasons:
• Coordination problems. One of the problems of a large organization is that it 
requires several layers of management to coordinate the activities of the different 
parts of the organization. A large organization requires more meetings, reports, 
and administrative work, leading to higher unit cost. If an increase in the firm’s 
output requires additional layers of management, the long-run average-cost 
curve may be positively sloped.
• Increasing input costs. When a firm increases its output, it will demand more of 
each of its inputs and may be forced to pay higher prices for some of these inputs.
For example, an expanding construction firm may be forced to pay higher wages to 
attract more workers. Alternatively, an expanding firm may be forced to hire workers 
who are less skilled than the original workers. An increase in wages or a decrease in 
productivity will increase the average cost of production, generating a positively sloped 
long-run average-cost curve.

Firms recognize the possibility of diseconomies of scale and adopt various 
strategies to avoid them. An example of a firm that adjusts its operations to avoid 
diseconomies of scale is 3M, a global technology company that produces products 
ranging from Post-it notes to pharmaceuticals and telecommunications systems. 
The company makes a conscious effort to keep its production units as small as pos-
sible to keep them flexible. When a production unit gets too large, the company 
breaks it apart.

In each case, the long-run average cost curve is negatively sloped for small quanti-
ties of output and relatively flat—almost horizontal—over a large range of output. In 
other words, these curves are L-shaped. Other studies suggest that the long-run cost 
curves of a wide variety of goods and services have the same shape.
Why is the typical long-run average-cost curve L-shaped? The long-run aver-
age-cost curve is negatively sloped for small quantities of output because there are 
economies of scale resulting from indivisible inputs and labor specialization. As output 
increases, the average-cost curve eventually becomes horizontal and remains horizontal 
for a wide range of output. Over the horizontal portion of the cost curve, increases in 
inputs lead to proportionate increases in output, so the average cost doesn’t change. 
In other words, the long-run average total cost (LAC) is constant and production is 
subject to constant returns to scale. 
Short-Run versus Long-Run Average Cost
Why is the firm’s short-run average-cost curve U-shaped, while the long-run average-
cost curve is L-shaped? For large quantities of output, the short-run curve is positively 
sloped because of diminishing returns and the resulting decrease in labor productivity 
and increase in marginal cost. If a firm increases its output while at least one input is held 
fixed, diminishing returns eventually occur, pulling up the average cost of production.
The difference between the short run and long run is a firm’s flexibility in choosing 
inputs. In the long run, a firm can increase all of its inputs, scaling up its operation by 
building a larger production facility. As a result, the firm will not suffer from diminish-
ing returns. In most cases, the long-run average-cost curve will be negatively sloped 
or horizontal. In some cases, firms experience diseconomies of scale, so the long-run 
average-cost curve will be positively sloped for high output levels. Nonetheless, the 
long-run average cost will not be as steep as the short-run curve, which is relatively 
steep because of diminishing returns.

Indivisible Inputs and the Cost of Fake Killer Whales
Applying the Concepts #3: How do indivisible inputs affect production costs?
each additional whale would cost an additional $5,000. In other 
words, the cost of producing the first fake killer whale is more 
than three times the cost of producing the second. In terms of 
total cost, producing two whales would cost a total of $21,000, 
while three whales would cost a total of $26,000, and so on.
This little story illustrates the effects of indivisible inputs on 
the firm’s cost curves. The mold is an indivisible input because 
it cannot be scaled down and still produce whales. If Funk wants 
to cut his production from two whales per month down to one, 
he still needs the mold; he cannot simply produce half as many 
whales with half a mold or a mold that is half the size. The cost 
of producing the first whale, $16,000, includes the cost of the 
mold, the indivisible input. Once the firm has the mold, the mar-
ginal cost for each whale is only $5,000, so the average cost per 
whale decreases as the number of whales increases.  Related 
to Exercises 3.4 and 3.9.

Examples of Production Cost
So far we’ve explored the links between production technology and the cost of produc-
tion. We’ve seen the firm’s short-run cost curves, which show how production costs 
vary with the quantity produced when at least one input is fixed. We’ve also seen the 
long-run average-cost curve, which shows how the average cost of production varies 
when the firm is perfectly flexible in choosing its inputs. In this part of the chapter, we 
look at actual production costs for several products.
Scale Economies in Wind Power
There are scale economies in the production of electricity from wind because elec-
tricity can be generated from turbines of different sizes. Although large wind turbines 
are more costly than small ones, the higher cost is more than offset by greater gener-
ating capacity. The scale economies occur because the cost of purchasing, installing, 
and maintaining a wind turbine increases less than proportionately with the turbine’s 
generating capacity. Table 23.4 shows the costs of a small turbine (150-kilowatt 
capacity) and a large turbine (600-kilowatt capacity), each with an assumed lifetime 
of 20 years.

The large turbine has four times the generation capacity of the small turbine— 
20 million kilowatt hours versus 5 million kilowatt hours—but its purchase price is less 
than three times as much. The two turbines have the same installation cost, and the 
operating and maintenance cost of the larger turbine is less than twice as large. Adding 
the various costs, the larger turbine, with four times the generating capacity, has less than 
twice the cost. As a result, the average cost per kilowatt-hour is only $0.032 for the large 
turbine, compared to $0.065 for the smaller turbine. 
The Average Cost of a Music Video
A music video is an information good—a product that is essentially a bundle of infor-
mation. Most of the cost of producing an information good results from collecting the 
information and making a first copy. Once the information is organized and digitized, 
the marginal cost of reproduction is tiny. In other words, an information good has large 
first-copy cost, and a tiny marginal cost.
For a music video, the first-copy cost is the cost of putting images and sounds into 
a digital format. The typical music video has a first-copy cost of $223,000—an amount 
that includes $28,000 for the people responsible for the script or “treatment,” $81,000 
for 2 days of filming, $81,000 for editing, and $33,000 for other costs. Once the images 
and sounds are digitized, the marginal cost of making additional copies is small, or in 
the case of a music video distributed online, actually zero.

Solar versus Nuclear: The Crossover
In 1998, the cost of electricity produced with solar technology was $0.32 per 
kilowatt-hour (Kwh), compared to $0.07 per Kwh for electricity produced with 
nuclear technology.3 Recent innovations in photovoltaic technology have reduced 
the unit cost of solar power, to $0.21 per Kwh in 2005 and to $0.16 per Kwh in 
2010. Over the same period, the unit cost of nuclear power increased, in large 
part because the capital cost of a nuclear reactor has increased, from $3 billion in 
2002 to $10 billion in 2010. For a new nuclear facility, the projected unit cost of 
electricity is about $0.16 per Kwh. In other words, the cost gap between solar and 
nuclear power has been eliminated: the cost of solar power is roughly the same as 
the unit cost of nuclear power.

The average cost of a music video depends on how many copies are distributed. 
Suppose the music video can be distributed online, at zero marginal cost. The average 
cost is $223 if 1,000 copies are distributed, and drops to $0.23 if one million copies are 
distributed. In Figure 23.7, the average-cost curve is negatively sloped and gets closer 
and closer to the horizontal axis as the quantity distributed increases. The gap decreases 
as the fixed production cost is spread over a larger number of copies. If consumers can 
download the music video at a price of $1, the break-even quantity is 223,000 copies 
distributed.

Key  T er m s
In this chapter, we explored 
the cost side of a firm, 
explaining the shapes of the 
firm’s short-run and long-
run cost curves. Table 23.5 
summarizes the definitions 
of various types of costs. 
Here are the main points of 
the chapter:
1.	 The negatively sloped portion of the short-run marginal-cost 
curve (MC) results from input specialization that causes increas-
ing marginal returns.
2.	 The positively sloped portion of the MC results from diminishing 
returns.
3.	 The short-run average-total-cost curve (ATC) is U-shaped 
because of the conflicting effects of (a) fixed costs being spread 
over a larger quantity of output and (b) diminishing returns.
4.	 The long-run average-cost curve (LAC) is horizontal over some 
range of output because replication is an option, so doubling 
output will no more than double long-run total cost.
5.	 The LAC is negatively sloped for small quantities of output 
because (a) there are indivisible inputs that cannot be scaled 
down and (b) a smaller operation has limited opportunities for 
labor specialization.
6.	 Diseconomies of scale arise if there are problems in coordinating 
a large operation or higher input costs in a larger organization.

Economic Cost and Economic Profit
Define economic cost and economic profit.
1.1	 The computation of economic cost is based on the 
principle of 
.
1.2	 A firm’s implicit cost is defined as the 
 cost 
of nonpurchased inputs, such as the entrepreneur’s 
 and 
.
1.3	 Economic profit equals 
 minus 
.
1.4	 Fill with “economic” or “accounting”: Because 
 cost typically exceeds 
 cost, 
 profit typically exceeds 
 profit.
1.5	 Suppose a person quits a job paying $45,000 per year 
and starts a business with $11,250 withdrawn from her 
savings account earning 4 percent per year. Calculate 
the implicit cost of starting her own business.
1.6	 The _________ (long/short) run is defined as a period 
over which a firm cannot change its production 
facility.
1.7	 When a firm is perfectly flexible in its choice of all 
inputs, the firm is operating in the 
 (long/
short) run.
1.8	 The opportunity cost of driving for Uber or Lyft 
includes the 
 and 
 from a regular 
job. (Related to Application 1 on page 519.)
1.9	 Compute the Cost. Edward the entrepreneur takes 
2 hours to cut a lawn, and he cuts 1,000 lawns per year. 
He uses solar-powered equipment (truck and mower) 
that will last forever—and can be sold at any time for 
$20,000. Edward could earn $12 per hour as a pedicur-
ist. The interest rate is 10 percent.
a.	 Given his current output level, compute his mar-
ginal cost and average cost of cutting lawns.
b.	Suppose he decides to reduce the number of lawns 
cut by half, to 500 per year. Compute the new mar-
ginal cost and average cost.

2.4	 At the current level of output, the marginal cost of MP3 
players exceeds the average cost. If you increase output, 
the average cost will

2.5	 If marginal cost equals average cost, we are at the mini-
mum point of the 
 cost curve.
2.6	 Arrows up or down. When marginal cost is less than

2.12	 Same Average Cost with Different Quantities? Sup-
pose there are two pencil producers with identical pro-
duction facilities—identical factories and equipment. 
The firms pay the same wages and pay the same prices 
for materials. Sam has a small workforce and produces 
1,000 pencils per minute; Marian has a medium-size 
workforce and produces 2,000 pencils per minute. The 
two firms have the same average total cost of 10 cents 
per pencil. Suppose you build a production facility 
identical to the ones used by the other firms and hire 
enough workers and buy enough materials to produce 
2,500 pencils per minute. Would you expect your aver-
age cost to be 10 cents per pencil (like the other two 
firms), less than 10 cents, or more than 10 cents?
Production and Cost in the Long Run
Draw the long-run marginal-cost and average-cost curves.
3.1	 The presence of 
 explains the negatively 
sloped portion of a long-run average-cost curve, and 
the notion of 
 explains the horizontal por-
tion of the curve.
3.2	 Consider the information provided in Figure 23.6 on 
page 530. Suppose the output of a large aluminum firm 
drops from 2 million pounds to 1 million pounds per 
year. The long-run average cost of producing alumi-
num will go from $
 to $
.
3.3	 The typical short-run average-cost curve is shaped like 
the letter U, while the typical long-run average-cost 
curve is shaped like the letter L because 
 are 
not applicable in the 
 run.
3.4	 The cost of producing the first fake killer whale is about 
three times the cost of producing the second because the 
firm uses 
 inputs. (Related to Application 3 
on page 531.)
3.5	 Deregulation and the Cost of Trucking. Suppose the 
government initially limits the number of trucking firms 
that can haul freight. The market for truck freight is 
served by a single firm that produces 5 million ton-miles 
of service per year, where one ton-mile is the hauling of 
one ton of freight one mile. The newly elected governor 
has proposed that other firms be allowed to enter the 
market. At a public hearing on the issue of eliminat-
ing the entry restrictions, the manager of the existing 
firm issued a grim warning: “If you allow entry into the 
market, four or five firms will enter, and the unit cost of 
truck freight will at least triple. There are big economies 
of scale in trucking services, so a single large firm is 
much more cost-efficient than several small firms would 
be.” What’s your reaction to this statement?
3.6	 Draw the Long-Run Cost Curve. Consider the long-
run production of books. The cost of indivisible inputs 
used in the production of books is $1,150 per day. To 
produce one book per day, the firm must also spend a 
total of $11 on other inputs–labor, materials, etc. The 
firm incurs a long-run marginal cost of $11.
a.	 Compute the average cost for 10 books, 50 books, 
200 books, and 500 books.
b.	Draw the long-run average cost curve for 10 to 500 
books per day.
3.7	 Diminishing Returns versus Diseconomies of Scale. 
Explain the difference between diseconomies of scale 
and diminishing returns. Based on the cost curves you’ve 
seen in this chapter, which is more likely in firms?
3.8	 Constant Marginal Cost. Consider a firm operating 
in the long run with an indivisible input costing $575. 
The marginal cost of production is constant at $11 per 
unit. Draw the firm’s long-run average-cost curve for 1 
to 10 units of output. The long-run average cost drops 
from $
 for the first unit to $
 for 
the tenth unit.
3.9	 A Better Whale Mold? Suppose a new mold is devel-
oped for producing fake killer whales. The new mold 
has twice the cost of the original mold, but cuts the 
marginal cost of whales to $1,000. (Related to Applica-
tion 3 on page 531.)
a.	 How does the cost of the first whale produced with 
the new mold compare to the cost with the original 
mold?
b.	At what quantity of whales will production with the 
new mold be less costly than production with the 
original mold?
Examples of Production Cost
Provide examples of production costs.
4.1	 The average cost of electricity 
 (increases/
decreases) as the size of the wind turbine increases.
4.2	 For information goods such as a music video distrib-
uted online, the cost of producing the first copy is very 
, but the marginal cost is 
.

537
4.3	 The Average Cost of a Super-Sized Turbine. Sup-
pose a new super-sized wind turbine is developed. Its 
price is $690,000, the cost to install it is $115,000, 
and the cost to operate and maintain it is $115,000. 
It generates 50 million kilowatt-hours of electricity. 
Calculate the turbine’s total cost and average cost per 
kilowatt-hour.
4.4	 The Average Cost of a Music Video. In Figure 23.7 
suppose a strike by wardrobe and makeup artists 
increases the cost of wardrobe and makeup by $17,000. 
Draw the average-cost curve for producing the video 
and distributing it online, with quantities up to 50,000.
4.5	 The Average Cost of Drama DVDs. You have been 
hired to produce a DVD of a play put on by a high 
school drama club. It will take you about 50 hours to 
make the master, which will be stored on a hard drive 
on your computer. The opportunity cost of your time 
is $20 per hour. The marginal cost of burning DVDs 
is constant at $2. Draw the average-cost curve for pro-
ducing the DVD, with quantities up to 100 DVDs.

Between 2005 and 2010, the demand 
for blueberries increased by roughly 
72 percent, in part because of publicity 
about the health benefits of antioxidants 
in blueberries. 
Production in the United States increased from 228 million 
pounds in 2005 to 411 million pounds in 2010. Over this period, 
the price increased from $1.44 per pound in 2005 to a peak of 
$1.85 per pound in 2007, and then returned to $1.44 in 2010. In 
other words, the market accommodated a substantial increase

Chapter 24 • Perfect Competition
539
T
his is the first of four chapters exploring the decisions firms make in different 
types of markets. Markets differ in the number of firms that compete against 
one another for customers. In this chapter, we look at a perfectly competitive 
market. In a perfectly competitive market, hundreds, or even thousands, of firms sell 
a homogeneous product. Each firm is such a small part of the market that it takes the 
market price as given: Each firm is a price taker. For example, each soybean farmer 
takes the market price as given. There is no reason to cut the price to sell more soy-
beans, because the farmer can sell as much as he wants at the market price. There is no 
reason to increase the price because the farmer would lose all his customers to other 
farmers selling at the market price.
A perfectly competitive market has two other features. First, on the demand side 
of the market there are hundreds, or even thousands, of buyers, each of whom takes 
the market price as given. Second, there are no barriers to market entry, so firms can 
easily enter or exit the market. To summarize, here are the five features of a perfectly 
competitive market:
1	 There are many sellers.
2	 There are many buyers.
3	 The product is homogeneous.
4	 There are no barriers to market entry.
5	 Both buyers and sellers are price takers.
If you’re thinking that the model of perfect competition is unrealistic, you’re 
right. Most firms actually have some flexibility over their prices. For example, 
when Target increases its price of DVDs, it will certainly sell fewer DVDs, but the 
quantity sold will probably not drop to zero. Although perfect competition is rare, 
it’s a good starting point for analyzing a firm’s decisions because a price-taking 
firm’s decisions are easy to understand. The firm doesn’t have to pick a price; it 
just decides how much to produce, given the market price. Once you understand 
this simple case, you will be ready to tackle the more complex decisions made 
by firms that are price makers—able to affect prices. We discuss that scenario in 
later chapters.
In this chapter, we see how price-taking firms use information on revenues and 
costs to decide how much output to produce. The output decisions of price-taking 
firms underlie the market supply curve and the law of supply. In other words, this chap-
ter reveals the economic logic behind the market supply curve and the law of supply.
Preview of the Four Market Structures
Let’s start by distinguishing between a market demand curve and the demand curve 
for an individual firm. As we saw earlier in the book, the market demand curve shows 
the relationship between the price and the quantity that suppliers can sell in the 
market, assuming all firms charge the same price. In contrast, the firm-specific 
demand curve shows the relationship between the price charged by a specific firm 
and the quantity that firm can sell. In a monopoly, a single firm serves the entire mar-
ket, so the firm-specific demand curve is the same as the market demand curve. As 
shown in Panel A of Figure 24.1, the monopolist can choose any point on the market 
demand curve, recognizing that the higher the price, the smaller the quantity the 
firm will sell.
As shown in Panel B of Figure 24.1, things are different for a perfectly competi-
tive firm. The firm-specific demand curve is horizontal—perfectly elastic. A perfectly 
competitive firm can sell as much as it wants at the market price of $12, but if it raises 
its price even a penny, it will sell nothing.

Most markets lie between the extremes of monopoly and perfect competition. 
Table 24.1 compares perfectly competitive markets with three alternative market struc-
tures , which we discuss in the next three chapters:
• Monopoly. A single firm serves the entire market. A monopoly occurs when the 
barriers to market entry are very large. This can result from very large economies 
of scale or a government policy that limits the number of firms. Some examples 
of monopolies that result from large economies of scale are local phone service, 
cable TV, and electric power transmission. Some examples of monopolies estab-
lished by government policy are drugs covered by patents, the selling of firewood 
in national parks, and the U.S. Postal Service.
• Monopolistic competition. There are no barriers to entering the market, so there 
are many firms, and each firm sells a slightly different product. For example, 
coffee shops in your city provide slightly different goods and compete for cus-
tomers. Your local grocery store sells many brands of toothbrushes, with slight 
differences in size, shape, color, and style.
▲  Figure 24.1  Monopoly versus Perfect Competition
In Panel A, the demand curve facing a monopolist is the market demand curve. In Panel B, a perfectly 
competitive firm takes the market price as given, so the firm-specific demand curve is horizontal. The 
firm can sell all it wants at the market price, but would sell nothing if it charged a higher price.

• Oligopoly. The market consists of just a few firms because economies of scale 
or government policies limit the number of firms. Some product examples are 
automobiles, computer processor chips, airline travel, and breakfast cereals. 
The large economies of scale in automobile production result from the large 
startup costs, with billions of dollars required to build a factory or assembly 
plant. Similarly, a fabrication plant for computer processor chips costs several 
billion dollars.
The Firm’s Short-Run Output Decision
We start our discussion of perfect competition with an individual firm’s decision 
about how much output to produce. The firm’s objective is to maximize economic 
profit, which, as we saw in the previous chapter, equals total revenue minus economic 
cost. Recall that economic cost includes all the opportunity costs of production, 
both explicit costs (cash payments) and implicit costs (the entrepreneur’s opportu-
nity costs). In the preceding chapter, we saw that the cost of production varies with 
the quantity produced. In this chapter, we see how economic profit varies with the 
quantity produced and then show how a firm can pick the quantity that maximizes 
its economic profit.
Remember that economic profit differs from the conventional notion of profit. 
Accountants focus on the flow of money into and out of a firm, so they ignore costs that 
do not involve explicit transactions. Accounting profit equals total revenue minus explicit 
costs. Because accountants ignore implicit costs, accounting profit usually exceeds eco-
nomic profit.

Wireless Women In Pakistan
Applying The Concepts #2: How do entry costs affect the number of firms in a market?
pay phones until the recent development of mobile phones 
generated a new competitive industry. In Pakistan, phone 
service is now provided by thousands of “wireless women,” 
entrepreneurs who invest $310 in wireless phone equipment 
(transceiver, battery, charger), a signboard, a calculator, and 
a stopwatch. Then they sell phone service to their neighbors, 
charging by the minute and second. On average, their net 
income is about $2 per day, about three times the average per 
capita income in Pakistan. The market for phone service has 
the features of a perfectly competitive market, with easy entry, 
a standardized good, and a large enough number of suppliers 
that each takes the market price as given. In contrast, to enter 
the phone business in the United States, your initial invest-
ment would be millions, or perhaps billions, of dollars, so the 
market for phone service is not perfectly competitive.  Related 
to Exercise 1.4.

We use the market for plain T-shirts to illustrate decision making in a perfectly 
competitive market. Some plain T-shirts are sold directly to consumers, and others are 
sold to firms that imprint words and images on the T-shirts and then sell the finished 
shirts to consumers. Plain T-shirts are produced in countries around the world by a 
large number of producers.
The Total Approach: Computing Total Revenue and Total Cost
One way for a firm to decide how much to produce is to compute the economic profit 
at different quantities and then pick the quantity that generates the highest profit. As 
we’ve seen, economic profit equals total revenue minus economic cost. We looked at 
the cost side of the profit equation in Chapter 23. The revenue side for a perfectly com-
petitive market is straightforward. A firm’s total revenue is the money it gets by selling 
its product. Total revenue is equal to the price of the product times the quantity sold. 
For example, if a firm sells eight T-shirts at $12 per shirt, total revenue is $96 (equal 
to 8 * $12). If our T-shirt producer has an economic cost of $63, the firm’s profit is 
$33 (equal to $96 - $63).
Table 24.2 shows the total revenue and total costs of a hypothetical producer of 
plain cotton T-shirts. Follow the row for an output of eight shirts. As shown in the 
second and third columns, the fixed cost is $17, and the variable cost increases with 
the amount produced. The fourth column shows total cost, the sum of the fixed and 
variable costs. As shown in the fifth column, at a price of $12 per shirt, the firm’s total 
revenue is $12 times the number of shirts produced. The sixth column shows economic 
profit, equal to total revenue minus total cost.
Figure 24.2 shows one way to choose the quantity of output that maximizes profit. 
We’re looking for the largest profit, shown by the biggest gap between total revenue 
and total cost. For example, for five shirts the gap is $25: Total revenue (TR) equals 
$60, and total cost (TC) equals $35. Moving down the table and across the figure, we 
see that profit increases to $30 for six shirts:
TR - TC = $72 - $42 = $30
Profit is maximized at $33 when the firm produces either seven or eight shirts:
 TR - TC = 84 - 51 = $33  
 TR - TC = 96 - 63 = $33

Table 24.2   Deciding How Much to Produce When the Price Is $12

Chapter 24 • Perfect Competition

When profit reaches its highest level with two different quantities (seven and eight 
shirts in this example), we assume the firm produces the larger quantity. When the 
firm produces eight shirts, its total revenue is $96 and its total cost is $63, leaving a 
profit of $33.
The Marginal Approach
The other way for a firm to decide how much output to produce relies on the mar-
ginal principle, the general decision-making rule that is one of the key principles of 
economics.
▲  Figure 24.2  Using the Total Approach to Choose an Output Level
Economic profit is shown by the vertical distance between the total-revenue curve and the total-cost 
curve. To maximize profit, the firm chooses the quantity of output that generates the largest vertical dif-
ference between the two curves.

Increase the level of an activity as long as its marginal benefit 
exceeds its marginal cost. Choose the level at which the marginal 
benefit equals the marginal cost.
Because our firm is in business to make money, the benefit it gets from producing 
shirts is revenue. The marginal benefit—or marginal revenue—of producing shirts is 
the change in total revenue that results from selling one more shirt. A perfectly com-
petitive firm takes the market price as given, so the marginal revenue—the change in 
total revenue from one more shirt—is simply the price:
marginal revenue = price
The marginal principle tells us that the firm will maximize its profit by choosing the 
quantity at which price equals marginal cost:
To maximize profit, produce the quantity where price = marginal cost

one more unit of output.

In Figure 24.3, the horizontal line shows the market price for T-shirts, which 
our shirt producer takes as given. The price line intersects the marginal-cost curve at 
eight shirts per minute, so that’s the quantity that satisfies the marginal principle and 
maximizes profit.
To see that an output of eight shirts per minute maximizes the firm’s profit, imag-
ine that the firm initially produced only five shirts per minute. Could the firm make 
more profit by producing more—that is, six shirts instead of five?
• From the seventh row of numbers in Table 24.2 and point c in Figure 24.3, we 
know the marginal cost of the sixth shirt is $7.
• The price of shirts is $12, so the marginal revenue is $12.
Because the extra revenue from the sixth shirt (price = $12) exceeds the extra cost 
(marginal cost = $7), the production and sale of the sixth shirt increases the firm’s 
total profit by $5 (equal to $12 - $7). Therefore, it is sensible to produce the sixth 
shirt. The same logic applies, with different numbers for marginal cost, for the seventh 
shirt. For the eighth shirt, marginal revenue equals marginal cost, so the firm’s profit 
doesn’t change. To be consistent with the marginal principle, we’ll assume the firm 
produces to the point where marginal revenue equals marginal cost. In this case, the 
firm chooses point a and produces eight shirts.
If the firm produced more than eight shirts, it would earn less than the maximum 
profit. Imagine that the firm initially produced nine shirts. From Table 24.2 and the 
marginal-cost curve in Figure 24.3, we see that the marginal cost of the ninth shirt 
is $16 (point d), which exceeds the marginal revenue (the market price) of $12. The 
ninth shirt adds more to cost ($16) than it adds to revenue ($12), so producing the shirt 
decreases the firm’s profit by $4. The marginal principle suggests that the firm should 
choose point a, with an output of eight shirts. The output decision is the same whether 
the firm uses the marginal approach or the total approach.
The advantage of the marginal approach is that it is easier to apply. To use the 
total approach, a firm needs information about the total revenue and total cost for all 
possible output levels. In contrast, a firm can apply the marginal principle by simply 
▲  Figure 24.3  The Marginal Approach to Picking an Output Level
A perfectly competitive firm takes the market price as given, so the marginal benefit, or marginal revenue, 
equals the price. Using the marginal principle, the typical firm will maximize profit at point a, where the 
$12 market price equals the marginal cost. Economic profit equals the difference between the price and 
the average cost ($4.125 = $12 - $7.875) times the quantity produced (eight shirts per minute), or 
$33 per minute.

increasing its output by one unit and computing the marginal revenue (the price) and 
the marginal cost. Using the marginal principle, the firm should produce more out-
put if the price exceeds the marginal cost, or produce less if the opposite is true. The 
firm can use the marginal principle to fine-tune its decision until the price equals the 
marginal cost.
Economic Profit and the Break-Even Price
We’ve seen that the perfectly competitive firm maximizes its profit by producing the 
quantity at which its marginal revenue (price) equals its marginal cost. How much 
profit does the firm earn? The firm’s economic profit equals its total revenue minus its 
total cost. One way to compute a firm’s total economic profit is to multiply the aver-
age profit per unit produced—the gap between the price and the average cost—by the 
quantity produced:
economic profit = (price - average cost) * quantity produced
In Figure 24.3, the average cost of producing eight shirts is $7.875 (point b), so the 
economic profit is $33:
economic profit = ($12 - $7.875) * 8 = $4.125 * 8 = $33
In Figure 24.3, the firm’s profit is shown by the area of the shaded rectangle. The area 
of a rectangle is the height of the rectangle times its width. In Figure 24.3, the height 
of the profit rectangle is the average profit of $4.125 per shirt (equal to $12 - $7.875) 
and the width is the eight shirts produced, so the profit is $33.
How would a decrease in price affect the firm’s output decision? A decrease in price 
shifts the marginal-revenue (price) line downward, so it will intersect the marginal-cost

The Break-Even Price For Switchgrass, A Feedstock For Biofuel
Applying The Concepts #2: What is the break-even price?
the opportunity cost of using land for switchgrass rather than 
another crop, for example, alfalfa, wheat, or soybeans.
We can illustrate the calculations with a simple example. 
Suppose the most profitable alternative to switchgrass is alfalfa, 
and the implicit rent on land used to grow alfalfa is $120 per 
acre—that’s how much a farmer can earn in alfalfa production. 
If the switchgrass yield is 3 tons per acre, the opportunity cost 
of land per ton of switchgrass is $40 per ton (equal to $120/3). 
If the explicit cost of a ton of switchgrass (for capital, labor, 
and raw materials) is $36, the break-even switchgrass price is 
$76 = $36 + $40.
What are the implications for switchgrass biofuel? To get 
some North Dakota farmers to switch their crops to switchgrass, 
the price must be at least $56 per ton. And the higher the price, 
the larger the acreage devoted to switchgrass. To get the most 
fertile land in North Dakota switched to switchgrass, the price 
must be $95.  Related to Exercises 2.9 and 2.10.
SOURCE: Based on Dean A. Bangsund, Eric A. DeVuyst, and F. Larry Leistritz, 
“Evaluation of Breakeven Farm-gate Switchgrass Prices in South Central North 
Dakota,” Agribusiness and Applied Economics Report 632, North Dakota State 
University (2008).
In the search for alternatives to fossil fuels, a prominent con-
tender is switchgrass, a perennial grass that is native to the U.S. 
plains states. The principal advantage of switchgrass and other 
cellulosic feedstocks for biofuels is their small carbon footprint. 
At what price will farmers convert their fields to switchgrass?
A recent study estimates the break-even price for grow-
ing switchgrass in North Dakota. The price per ton varies with 
the fertility of the land, from $56 on the least fertile land to $95 
on the most fertile, or $76 on average. To compute the break-
even price, the researchers started by adding up the explicit 
costs of production, including the costs of capital (machinery 
and equipment), labor, and raw materials. Then they added

curve at a smaller quantity. In Figure 24.3, suppose the price drops to $7. The marginal-
revenue line will shift downward, causing it to intersect the marginal-cost curve at point 
c, so the firm will produce only six shirts per minute. In other words, when the price 
decreases from $12 to $7 the quantity produced decreases from eight to six shirts. This 
is the law of supply in action: The lower the price, the smaller the quantity supplied.
What about the firm’s economic profit at a price of $7? At point c, average total 
cost is $7, the same as the price. Therefore, economic profit is zero. We have discov-
ered the break-even price, the price at which economic profit is zero. The break-even 
price is shown by the minimum point of the ATC curve, where marginal cost equals 
average total cost. Remember that zero economic profit means that the firm is making 
just enough money to cover all its costs, including the opportunity costs of the 
entrepreneur.
The Firm’s Shut-Down Decision
Consider next the decisions faced by a firm that is losing money. Suppose the price of 
shirts drops to $4, which is so low that the firm’s total revenue is less than its total cost. 
In Table 24.3, the marginal principle tells the firm to produce four shirts at this price, 
but the firm’s total cost of $30 exceeds its total revenue of $16, so the firm will lose $14 
per minute. Should the firm continue to operate at a loss or shut down?

Learning Objective 24.3
Explain the shut-down rule.
Total Revenue, Variable Cost, and the Shut-Down Decision
The decision to operate or shut down is a short-run decision, a day-to-day decision to 
temporarily halt production in response to market conditions. Suppose our shirt fac-
tory hires workers by the day, so it makes the decision at the beginning of each day. 
The decision-making rule is
operate if total revenue 7 variable cost  
shut down if total revenue 6 variable cost
As we saw in Chapter 23, a firm’s variable cost includes all the costs that vary with 
the quantity produced. In the case of the shirt firm, it includes the costs of workers, raw 
materials such as cotton, and the cost of heating and powering the factory for the day. 
The variable cost does not include the $17 fixed cost of the production facility—for 
example, the cost of the machines or the factory itself—because these costs are not 
affected by the decision to operate or shut down.
Although the decision is made at the beginning of each day, we can use the revenue 
and costs per minute to compare total revenue to variable cost. From Table 24.3, when 
the price is $4, the best quantity is four shirts and the variable cost is $13. The total 
revenue from selling four shirts at $4 per shirt is $16, which exceeds the $13 variable

cost. By operating the factory, the firm pays $13 in variable cost to generate $16 in 
revenue, so the firm is better off operating the facility. The benefit of operating the 
facility exceeds the variable cost, so it is sensible to produce four shirts per minute.
Figure 24.4 shows the firm’s choice when the price of shirts is $4. The marginal 
principle is satisfied at point a, where the price equals the marginal cost. As shown by 
point b, the average cost of producing four shirts is $7.50, so the firm loses $3.50 per 
shirt. The shaded rectangle shows the firm’s loss of $14. The height of the rectangle 
is the $3.50 loss per shirt, and the width of the rectangle is the four shirts produced.
▲  Figure 24.4  The Shut-Down Decision and the Shut-Down Price
When the price is $4, marginal revenue equals marginal cost at four shirts (point a). At this quantity, aver-
age cost is $7.50, so the firm loses $3.50 on each shirt, for a total loss of $14. Total revenue is $16 and 
the variable cost is only $13, so the firm is better off operating at a loss rather than shutting down and los-
ing its fixed cost of $17. The shut-down price, shown by the minimum point of the AVC curve, is $3.00.

Of course, if the price drops to a low enough level, the firm will shut down the 
factory. For example, if the price drops to $1, the marginal principle is satisfied with 
two shirts per day. At this quantity, the variable cost is $6, which exceeds $2 revenue 
($1 per shirt times two shirts). With this low price, the firm’s total revenue is not high 
enough to cover the firm’s variable cost from operating the facility, so it is better to 
shut down for the day.
The Shut-Down Price
There is a shortcut for determining whether it is sensible to continue to operate: 
compare the price to the average variable cost. Total revenue equals the price times 
the quantity produced, and the variable cost equals the average variable cost times 
the quantity produced. Therefore, total revenue will exceed variable cost if the price 
exceeds the average variable cost. If that happens, the firm should continue to operate. 
Otherwise, the firm should shut down.
operate if price 7 average variable cost  
shut down if price 6 average variable cost
In Figure 24.4, with a price of $4, the marginal principle is satisfied at point a, and the 
average variable cost of producing four shirts is $3.25 (point c). The price exceeds the 
average variable cost, so it is sensible to continue operating, even at a loss.

part 9
548
The firm’s shut-down price is the price at which the firm is indifferent between 
operating and shutting down. To find the shut-down price, we find the minimum point 
on the AVC curve. In Figure 24.4, AVC reaches its minimum of $3 at a quantity of three 
shirts per minute, so the shut-down price is $3 (shown by point d). The average variable 
cost never drops below $3, so if the price drops below $3 it would be impossible to 
generate enough revenue to cover the firm’s variable cost. When the price equals the 
shut-down price, the firm is generating just enough revenue to cover its variable costs, 
so it is just as well off operating as shutting down.
How long will a firm continue to operate at a loss? Let’s think about what happens 
when the firm must decide whether or not to build a new production facility. The firm 
will build a new facility—and stay in the market—only if the price of shirts exceeds the 
average total cost of production. In other words, the firm will stay in the market only 
if the market price is high enough for its total revenue to cover all the costs of produc-
tion, including the cost of the new facility. In other words, the price must be greater 
than or equal to the firm’s break-even price. Although a firm might make a short-run 
decision to operate an existing facility at a loss, it won’t replace the facility unless a new 
facility will be profitable.
Fixed Costs and Sunk Costs
Note that the decision whether to operate or shut down does not incorporate the fixed 
costs of the production facility. If we assume the facility cannot be rented out to some 
other firm while the shirt firm isn’t using it, the fixed cost is a sunk cost, a cost the 
firm has already paid or committed to pay, so it cannot be recovered even by shutting 
down the factory. Therefore, the firm should ignore the cost of the facility when decid-
ing whether to operate or shut down.
Rent is just one example of an irrelevant sunk cost. The marginal principle tells us 
that decisions are based on the costs that depend on what we do, not on costs that we 
can do nothing about. Suppose a dairy farmer spills two-thirds of a 300-gallon load of 
milk on the way to an ice-cream plant. Should the farmer return to the farm or deliver 
the remaining 100 gallons? As long as the marginal cost of delivering the milk—the

Straddling The Zinc Cost Curve
Applying The Concepts: What is the shutdown price?
Zinc is a vital input to the production of steel. Because the cost 
of mining zinc varies from one mine to another, the shutdown 
price varies too. The world price of zinc decreased from roughly 
$2,300 per ton in 2010–2011 to $1,900 in early 2012. The lower 
price was below the shutdown prices of Alcoa’s mines in Italy 
and Spain: at a price of $1,900, the total revenue from the mines 
was less than the variable cost of operating the mines. The shut-
down of Alcoa’s mines decreased mining output by 531,000 
tons. Although mines with lower production costs continued 
mining at a price of $1,900, many mines have shutdown prices 
in the range $1,500 to $1,900, and will shut down if the price 
continues to drop.   Related to Exercise 3.5.

opportunity cost of the farmer’s time and the cost of fuel—is less than the amount the 
farmer will be paid for the remaining 100 gallons, it is sensible to deliver the milk. The 
spilt milk is a sunk cost that is irrelevant to the farmer’s delivery decision. The farmer 
should not cry over spilt milk, but deliver the rest.
Short-Run Supply Curves
Now that we’ve explored the output decision of a price-taking firm, we’re ready to 
show how a firm responds to changes in the market price of its product. We show the 
relationship between price and quantity supplied with two short-run supply curves, one 
for the individual firm and one for the entire market.
The Firm’s Short-Run Supply Curve
The firm’s short-run supply curve shows the relationship between the market price 
and the quantity supplied by the firm in the short run, over a period of time during 
which one input—the production facility—cannot be changed. In the case of shirt 
producers, the firm’s supply curve answers the following question: At a given market 
price for shirts, how many shirts will the firm produce? In Figure 24.3 and 24.4, we 
used the marginal principle to answer this question for several different prices: At a 
price of $3, the quantity is three shirts; at a price of $7, the quantity is six shirts; at a 
price of $12, the quantity is eight shirts.
The firm’s short-run supply curve is the part of the firm’s short-run marginal-
cost curve above the shut-down price. The shut-down price for the shirt firm is $3, 
so, as shown by point a in Figure 24.5, the short-run supply curve is the marginal-
cost curve starting at $3. For any price above the shut-down price, the firm will 
choose the quantity at which price equals marginal cost, so we can read the firm’s 
quantity supplied directly from its marginal-cost curve. If the price is $7, the firm 
will supply six shirts per minute (point b). As the price increases, the firm responds 
by supplying more shirts: 8 shirts at a price of $12 (point c) and 10 shirts at a price 
of $21 (point d).
What about prices below the shut-down price? If the price drops below the shut-
down price, the firm’s total revenue will not be high enough to cover its variable cost, 
so the firm will shut down and produce no output. In Panel A of Figure 24.5, the firm’s 
supply curve starts at point a, indicating that the quantity supplied is zero for any price 
less than $3.
The Short-Run Market Supply Curve
The short-run market supply curve shows the relationship between the market 
price and the quantity supplied by firms as a whole in the short run. Panel B of 
Figure 24.5 shows the short-run market supply curve when there are 100 identical 
shirt firms. For each price, we get the quantity supplied for the entire market by 
multiplying the quantity supplied by the typical firm (from the individual supply 
curve) by 100. At a price of $7, each firm produces six shirts (point b in Panel A), so 
the market supply is 600 shirts (point f in Panel B). If the price increases to $12, each 
firm increases production to eight shirts (point c in Panel A), so the market supply 
is 800 shirts (point g in Panel B).
What happens if firms are not identical but instead have different individual supply 
curves? To compute the market supply in this case, we add the quantities supplied by 
the hundreds of firms in the market. The assumption that firms are identical is harm-
less: It makes it easier to derive the market supply curve from the supply curve of the 
typical firm, but it does not change the analysis.

Market Equilibrium
Figure 24.6 shows a perfectly competitive market in equilibrium. For a short-run equi-
librium, two conditions are satisfied:
1	 At the market level, the quantity of the product supplied equals the quantity 
demanded. The demand curve intersects the short-run market supply curve at a 
price of $7 and a quantity of 600 shirts per minute (Panel A).
2	 The typical firm in the market maximizes its profit, given the market price. At a 
market price of $7, each of the 100 firms maximizes profit by producing six shirts 
per minute (Panel B).
▲  Figure 24.5  Short-Run Supply Curves
In Panel A, the firm’s short-run supply curve is the part of the marginal-cost curve above the shut-down 
price. In Panel B, there are 100 firms in the market, so the market supply at a given price is 100 times 
the quantity supplied by the typical firm. At a price of $7, each firm supplies six shirts per minute (point 
b), so the market supply is 600 shirts per minute (point f).

In Figure 24.6, the market has reached a short-run equilibrium because the price of $7 
generates a total of 600 shirts per minute, exactly the quantity demanded by consum-
ers at this price.
In the long run, firms can enter or leave an industry, and existing firms can modify 
their facilities or build new facilities. The market reaches a long-run equilibrium when 
the two conditions for short-run equilibrium are met, and a third long-run condition 
holds as well:
3	 Each firm in the market earns zero economic profit, so there is no incentive for 
existing firms to leave the market and no incentive for other firms to enter the 
market.
In Figure 24.6, at the quantity chosen by the typical firm (six shirts), the price 
($7) equals the average total cost, so each firm makes zero economic profit, with total 
revenue equal to total cost. In other words, the market price equals the break-even 
price. When economic profit is zero, the firm’s revenue is high enough to cover all its 
costs—including the opportunity costs of the entrepreneur—but not high enough to 
cause additional firms to enter the market. Each firm already in the market makes just 
enough money to stay in business, so there is no incentive for new firms to enter the 
market, and no incentive for existing firms to leave.
The Long-Run Supply Curve for an Increasing-Cost 
Industry
Let’s look at the long-run market supply curve, which shows the relationship between 
the market price and the quantity supplied by all firms in the long run, a period long 
enough that firms can enter or leave the market. Suppose the typical shirt firm produces 
six shirts per minute, using a standard set of inputs, including a factory, some workers, 
and raw materials of cotton and thread. In a perfectly competitive industry, there are

Short-Run Supply Curve For Cargo
Applying The Concepts #4: Why is the short-run supply curve positively sloped?
Consider the supply of shipping services. The law of supply 
suggests that as the price of shipping increases, the quantity 
of shipping services will increase. At a relatively low freight rate 
of $2 per ton, only the most efficient ships operate, and they 
economize on fuel by traveling at a relatively low speed. As a 
result, the annual quantity of shipping services is only 70 units 
per year. At an intermediate freight price of $3 per ton, less 
efficient ships join the fleet. In addition, all the ships travel at 
a greater speed, using more fuel in the process. The combi-
nation of more ships and faster travel increases the quantity 
of shipping services provided to 85 units per year. At a high 
freight rate of $7 per ton, the least efficient ships join the fleet 
and all the ships run at full speed. As a result, the quantity of 
shipping services increases to 96 units per year.  Related to 
Exercise 4.6.

no restrictions on entry, so anyone can use the standard set of inputs to produce six 
shirts per minute.
We start with the case of an increasing-cost industry, in which the average cost 
of production increases as the total output increases, for two reasons:
• Increasing input price. As an industry grows, it competes with other industries 
for limited amounts of various inputs, and this competition drives up the prices 
of these inputs. For example, suppose the shirt industry competes against other 
industries for a limited amount of cotton. To get more cotton to produce more 
shirts, firms in the shirt industry must outbid other industries for the limited 
amount available, and this drives up the price of cotton.
• Less productive inputs. A small industry will use only the most productive inputs, 
but as the industry grows, firms may be forced to use less productive inputs. For 
example, a small shirt industry will use only the most skillful workers, but as the 
industry grows, it will hire workers with lower skills. As the average skill level 
of the industry’s workforce decreases, the average cost of production increases: 
A firm will require more labor time—and pay more in labor costs—to produce 
each shirt.
Another example of progressively less productive inputs is the production of agri-
cultural products such as sugar. Because of variation in climate and soil conditions, it is 
cheaper to grow sugar in some areas than in others. As the quantity of sugar produced 
increases, growers are forced to produce sugar in areas with less favorable climates and 
soil conditions, and this results in higher costs.
Production Cost and Industry Size
Table 24.4 shows hypothetical data on the cost of producing shirts. Let’s start with 
the first row, which shows the firm’s production costs in an industry with 100 firms 
and a total of 600 shirts produced per day (six shirts per firm). To compute the total 
cost for the typical firm, we add the cost of the firm’s production facility (the cost of 
the shirt factory), the cost of labor, and the cost of materials. In the first row, the total 
cost of the typical firm producing six shirts per minute is $42, and the average cost 
is $7 per shirt ($42 divided by six shirts). In the second row, if the number of firms 
doubles to 200 and each firm continues to produce six shirts per minute, the total 
output of the industry will double to 1,200 shirts per minute. For the two reasons 
listed earlier (higher input prices and less productive inputs), the total cost per firm 
increases to $60, so the average cost per shirt increases to $10. In the last row, when 
the total output of the industry increases to 1,800 shirts per minute, the average cost 
per shirt increases to $13.
increasing-cost industry
An industry in which the average cost of 
production increases as the total output of 
the industry increases; the long-run sup-
ply curve is positively sloped.
The shirt industry is an example of an increasing-cost industry. In the last column 
of Table 24.4, the average cost increases from $7 for an industry that produces 600 
shirts, to $10 for an industry that produces 1,200 shirts, and so on. The average cost 
increases because firms in a larger industry pay higher input prices and use less pro-
ductive inputs.

Drawing the Long-Run Market Supply Curve
The long-run supply curve tells us how much output will be produced at each price in 
the long run, when the number of firms in the market can change. Recall that in the 
long-run equilibrium, each firm makes zero economic profit, meaning that the price 
equals the average cost of production.
The data in Table 24.4 shows three points on the long-run supply curve. At a price 
of $7, a total of 100 firms will be in the market, with each producing six shirts per hour. 
This combination (price = $7 and quantity = 600 shirts) is on the long-run supply 
curve because the price equals the average cost. Each firm makes zero economic profit, 
so there is no incentive for firms to either enter or exit the market. This is shown by point 
a in Figure 24.7. Suppose the price of shirts increases. At the higher price, shirt-making 
will be more profitable, and firms will enter the market, increasing total output. Firms 
will continue to enter the market until the economic profit becomes zero again, which 
happens when the average cost again equals the price. From Table 24.4, we see that entry 
will continue until the market reaches 200 firms producing 1,200 shirts at an average cost 
and price of $10. This is shown by point b in Figure 24.7. Point c shows another point on 
the long-run supply curve, with a price of $13 and a quantity of 1,800 shirts.
▲  Figure 24.7  Long-Run Market Supply Curve
The long-run market supply curve shows the relationship between the price and quantity supplied in the 
long run, when firms can enter or leave the industry. At each point on the supply curve, the market price 
equals the long-run average cost of production. Because this is an increasing-cost industry, the long-run 
market supply curve is positively sloped.

The long-run supply curve in Figure 24.7 is positively sloped, as it will be for any 
increasing-cost industry. This is another example of the law of supply. An increase in 
the price of shirts initially makes shirt production profitable, so firms enter the market 
and produce more shirts. As industry-wide output increases, the greater demand for 
cotton and labor increases input prices, which in turn increases the average cost of 
producing shirts. Firms will continue to enter the market until the average cost rises to 
the point where it equals the price of shirts. The positively sloped supply curve tells us 
the market won’t produce a larger quantity of shirts unless the price rises to cover the 
higher average cost associated with the larger industry.
Examples of Increasing-Cost Industries: Sugar and Apartments
The sugar industry is an example of an increasing-cost industry. If the price of sugar 
is only 11 cents per pound, sugar production is profitable in areas with relatively low 
production costs, including the Caribbean, Latin America, Australia, and South Africa. 

part 9
554
At a price of 11 cents, the world supply of sugar equals the amount produced in these 
areas. As the price increases, sugar production becomes profitable in areas where pro-
duction costs are higher, and as these areas enter the world market, the quantity of 
sugar supplied increases. For example, at a price of 14 cents per pound, sugar produc-
tion is profitable in some countries in the European Union, too. At a price of 24 cents, 
production is profitable even in the United States.
The market for apartments is another example of an increasing-cost industry with a 
positively sloped supply curve. Most communities use zoning laws to restrict the amount 
of land available for apartments. As the industry expands by building more apartments, 
firms compete fiercely for the small amount of land zoned for apartments. Housing 
firms bid up the price of land, increasing the cost of producing apartments. Producers 
can cover these higher production costs only by charging higher rents to tenants. In 
other words, the supply curve for apartments is positively sloped because land prices 
increase with the total output of the industry, pulling up average cost and necessitating 
a higher price for firms to make zero economic profit.
Short-Run and Long-Run Effects of Changes in Demand
We can use what we’ve learned about the short-run and long-run supply curves to get a 
deeper understanding of perfectly competitive markets. Let’s use the two supply curves 
to explore the short-run and the long-run effects of a change in demand in a perfectly 
competitive market.
The Short-Run Response to an Increase in Demand
Figure 24.8 shows the short-run effects of an increase in the demand for shirts. Panel 
A shows what’s happening at the market level. Let’s start with the initial equilibrium 
shown by point a: The original demand curve intersects the short-run market supply 
curve at a price of $7 per shirt and a quantity of 600 shirts. When demand increases, 
the new demand curve intersects the supply curve at a price of $12 and a quantity of 
800 shirts (point b). In Panel B, an increase in price from $7 to $12 increases the out-
put per firm from six shirts to eight shirts. At this quantity, the $12 price now exceeds 
the average total cost, so the typical firm makes an economic profit, as shown by the 
shaded rectangle.

Chinese Coffee Growers Obey the Law of Supply
Applying The Concepts #5: How do producers respond to an increase in price?
2012, the world price of coffee beans nearly doubled. Farmers 
in Pu’er responded to the higher price by doubling the acreage 
of coffee, and cleared forested hillsides to grow more beans. At 
the relatively high world price, a hectare of coffee earns a family 
about $10,000 per year, which is three times the earnings from 
growing tea and five times the earnings from growing rice. The 
farmers’ response illustrates the law of supply: an increase in 
price increases the quantity supplied.  Related to Exercise 5.7.

Point b is not a long-run equilibrium because each firm is making a positive 
economic profit. Firms will enter the profitable market, and as they compete for cus-
tomers the price of shirts will decrease. New firms will continue to enter the market 
until the price drops to the point at which economic profit is zero. How far will the 
price drop?
The Long-Run Response to an Increase in Demand
We can use the long-run supply curve to determine the long-run price after an increase 
in demand. In Figure 24.9, the short-run effect of the increase in demand is shown by 
the move from point a to point b: The price increases from $7 to $12, and the quantity 
increases from 600 to 800. Economic profit is positive, so firms will enter the market. 
As shown by the long-run supply curve, entry will continue until the price drops to $10 
and the quantity is 1,200 shirts per minute. The new long-run equilibrium is shown 
by point c, where the new demand curve intersects the long-run supply curve. At this 
price and quantity, each of the 200 firms produces six shirts per minute and earns zero 
economic profit.
Figure 24.9 shows how the price of shirts changes over time. An increase in 
demand causes a large upward jump in the price from $7 to $12 in the short run, fol-
lowed by a slide downward to the new long-run equilibrium price of $10. In the short 
run, firms respond to an increase in price by squeezing more output from their exist-
ing production facilities. Because of diminishing returns, it is very costly to increase 
output in the short run, so the price must increase by a large amount to cover these 
much higher production costs. The higher price causes new firms to enter the market 
and, as they enter, the price gradually drops to the point at which each firm makes 
zero economic profit. The long-run supply curve is relatively flat because firms enter 
the industry and build new factories, so there are no diminishing returns to increase 
production costs.
▲  Figure 24.8  Short-Run Effects of an Increase in Demand
An increase in demand for shirts increases the market price to $12, causing the typical firm to produce 
eight shirts instead of six. Price exceeds the average total cost at the eight-shirt quantity, so economic 
profit is positive. Firms will enter the profitable market.

The short-run supply curve is steeper than the long-run supply curve because of diminishing returns in the 
short run. In the short run, an increase in demand increases the price from $7 (point a) to $12 (point b). 
But in the long run, firms can enter the industry and build more production facilities, so the price eventu-
ally drops to $10 (point c). The large upward jump in price after the increase in demand is followed by a 
downward slide to the new long-run equilibrium price.

The Upward Jump And Downward Slide Of Blueberry Prices
Applying The Concepts #6: Why is the time path of market prices after an increase in demand?
eager consumers competed for the limited supply, so prices 
increased. The price increased from $1.44 per pound in 2005 
to a peak of $1.85 per pound in 2007. In the blueberry busi-
ness, the long run is the few years it takes for newly planted 
bushes to begin producing marketable berries. As a result of 
higher prices in the short run, entry into the industry took the 
form of increased acreage of blueberries, which increased from 
about 49,000 acres in 2005 to almost 70,000 acres in 2010. 
Taking the long-run (5-year) perspective, the blueberry market 
has a relatively flat long-run supply curve, so an increase in 
demand doesn’t increase the price in the long run. Although 
many other factors affect blueberry prices (weather, imports, 
fluctuations in demand), the fact that the 2010 price equals the 
2005 price is not a fluke, but illustrates the notion that the blue-
berry industry is roughly a constant-cost industry.  Related to 
Exercise 6.2.
As we saw in the chapter opener, publicity about the health 
benefits of antioxidants in blueberries increased the demand 
for blueberries. In the short run, the supply of blueberries 
is inflexible because the number of bushes is fixed, and

Long-Run Supply for a Constant-Cost Industry
So far we have examined products produced by increasing-cost industries, whose aver-
age cost increases as the industry expands. We turn next to a constant-cost industry, 
an industry whose average cost is constant—it doesn’t change as the industry expands. 
That is, the prices of inputs such as labor and materials do not change as the total 
output of the industry increases. This happens when the industry uses a relatively small 
amount of the available labor and materials, meaning that events in the industry—
increases or decreases in output—do not affect the price of the input. As a result, the 
average cost of production for the typical firm doesn’t change as the industry grows. 
In Table 24.4, the shirt industry would be a constant-cost industry if the average cost 
of shirts was constant at $7 regardless of how many shirts were produced.
Long-Run Supply Curve for a Constant-Cost Industry
As an example of a constant-cost industry, consider the production of birthday cake 
candles. As the industry grows, it will use more workers, wicks, and wax, but because 
the industry is such a small part of the markets for labor and materials, the prices of 
these inputs won’t change. As a result, the average cost of production won’t change as 
the industry grows.
The long-run supply curve for a constant-cost industry is horizontal at the con-
stant average cost of production. If the average cost of birthday cake candles is $0.05 
per candle, the long-run supply curve for candles will be horizontal at $0.05, as shown 
by Figure 24.10. At any lower price, the quantity of candles supplied would be zero 
because in the long run no rational firm would provide candles at a price lower than the 
average cost of production. At any higher price, firms would enter the candle industry 
in droves, and entry would continue until the price dropped to the constant average 
cost of $0.05 per candle.

Hurricane Andrew and the Price of Ice
For an example of the effects of an increase in demand in a constant-cost industry, let’s 
look at the short-run and long-run effects of a hurricane. In 1992, Hurricane Andrew 
struck the southeastern United States, leaving millions of people without electricity for 
several days. Figure 24.11 shows the short-run and long-run effects of the hurricane on 
the price of ice, which was used to cool and preserve food in areas without electricity.

▲  Figure 24.11  Hurricane Andrew and the Price of Ice
A hurricane increases the demand for ice, shifting the demand curve to the right. In the short run, the 
supply curve is relatively steep, so the price rises by a large amount—from $1 to $5. In the long run, 
firms enter the industry, pulling the price back down. Because ice production is a constant-cost industry, 
the supply is horizontal, and the large upward jump in price is followed by a downward slide back to the 
original price.

Economic Detective And The Case Of Margarine Prices
Applying The Concepts #7: How does a permanent decrease in demand affect the equilibrium price  
in a constant-cost industry?
The margarine industry is an example of a constant-cost 
industry. As the total output of the industry changes, the prices 
of the key inputs to the production of margarine don’t change, 
so the unit cost of production is unaffected by changes in total 
output. Of course a decrease in demand decreases the equi-
librium price in the short run, but the exit of firms from the 
unprofitable industry causes the price to rise, and in the new 
long-run equilibrium, the original price—equal to the constant 
long-run marginal cost—will be restored.  Related to Exercises 
7.3 and 7.5.

Between 2000 and 2009, concerns about the health effects of 
trans-fatty acids decreased the demand for margarine. Although 
total consumption in the United States decreased by roughly 
half, the price of margarine in 2009 was roughly the same, in real 
terms, as the price in 2000. Why didn’t the decrease in demand 
decrease the equilibrium price?

Before the hurricane, the market was at point a, with a price of $1 per bag of ice. The long-
run supply curve is horizontal, indicating that the ice industry is a constant-cost industry.
In the short run (a day or two), the number of ice suppliers is fixed. The increase 
in demand caused by the hurricane moved the market from point a to point b, and the 
price rose to $5 per bag of ice. In the long run, firms responded to the higher price by 

559
entering the market. Many people trucked ice from distant locations and sold it from 
trucks parked on streets and highways. As these firms entered the ice market in the days 
after the hurricane, the price of ice gradually dropped, and the market eventually reached 
the intersection of the new demand curve and the long-run supply curve (point c), with 
a price equal to the pre-hurricane price. In the case of the retail ice industry, the long 
run is just a few days.
This pattern of price changes following the hurricane was observed in other mar-
kets. Immediately after the hurricane, $200 chain saws were sold for $900, but the 
price dropped steadily as new roadside firms entered the market. The same sort of 
price changes occurred for bottled water, tarpaper, and plywood. The basic pattern 
was a large upward jump in price followed by a downward slide to the long-run equi-
librium price.
In this chapter, we explored the decisions 
made by perfectly competitive firms and the 
implications of these decisions for the supply 
side of the market. In the short run, a firm 
uses the marginal principle to decide how 
much output to produce. In the long run, a firm will enter a market if 
the price exceeds the average cost of production. Here are the main 
points of this chapter:
1.	 A price-taking firm should produce the quantity of output at 
which the marginal revenue (the price) equals the marginal cost 
of production.
2.	 An unprofitable firm should continue to operate if its total revenue 
exceeds its total variable cost.
3.	 The long-run supply curve will be positively sloped if the average 
cost of production increases as the industry grows.
4.	 The long-run supply curve is flatter than the short-run supply 
curve because there are diminishing returns in the short run, but 
not in the long run.
5.	 An increase in demand causes a large upward jump in price, fol-
lowed by a downward slide to the new long-run equilibrium price.

Preview of the Four Market Structures
Distinguish between four market structures.
1.1	 The firm-specific demand curve shows the relation-
ship between the 
 charged by the firm and 
the 
 by the firm.
1.2	 Consumers do not have a strong preference for 
the output of one seller over that of another in a  
 market because the firms sell a standard-
ized product.
1.3	 For a monopolist, the firm-specific demand curve is 
the same as the 
 demand curve.
1.4	 A 
 market is made up of a large number of 
firms.
1.5	 In Pakistan, the market for phone service is perfectly 
 because a person can enter the market 
with a relatively small initial investment—only $310.

The Firm’s Short-Run Output Decision
Explain the short-run output rule and the break-even price.
2.1	 Economic profit equals

.
2.2	 Economic cost equals 
 cost plus 
 
cost.
2.3	 For a perfectly competitive firm, marginal revenue 
equals 
, and to maximize profit, the firm 
produces the quantity at which 
 equals 
.
2.4	 Farmer Brown sells her wheat in a perfectly com-
petitive market. Suppose the current market price of 
wheat is $2.50 per bushel. Farmer Brown can sell as 
much wheat as she likes at $
 per bushel.
2.5	 At the current output level, a farmer’s marginal cost of 
producing sugar is $0.30. If the price of sugar is $0.22 
per pound, the farmer should 
 (increase/
decrease) production. If the price of sugar is $0.32 
per pound, the farmer should 
 (increase/
decrease) production.
2.6	 A firm produces 20 units of output at a market price 
of $5, a marginal cost of $5, and an average cost of $3. 
The firm’s economic profit is $
, and the firm 
 (is/is not) maximizing its economic profit.
2.7	 If the market price equals a firm’s break-even price, 
the firm earns 
 economic profit because 
 equals 
.
2.8	 A decrease in price 
 (increases/decreases) a 
firm’s marginal revenue, so it 
 (increases/
decreases) the quantity supplied. This is the law of 
 in action.
2.9	 The break-even price for switchgrass varies with 
, and on average is 
 per ton. 
(Related to Application 2 on page 545.)
2.10	 Changes in the Break-Even Price. Consider 
a switchgrass farmer whose initial break-even 
price is $76 = $36 explicit cost + $40 opportunity 
cost for land. For each of the following changes, 
explain the effects on the farmer’s production cost 
and break-even price. (Related to Application 2 on 
page 545.)
a.	 The cost of fertilizer increases.
b.	The market price of alfalfa increases.
2.11	 More or Fewer Deliveries? Consider a delivery 
firm that delivers packages by bicycle, charging $13 
per package and paying each of its workers $12 per 
hour. One day, one of the workers was 2 hours late to 
work, and the number of packages delivered that day 
decreased by one package.
a.	 Did the tardiness of the worker increase or decrease 
the firm’s profit?
b.	Based on the new information provided by this 
experience, should the firm produce more deliver-
ies by increasing its workforce, or produce fewer 
deliveries by reducing its workforce? Explain, using 
the marginal principle.
2.12	 Advice for a Firm. You’ve been hired as an economic 
consultant by a price-taking firm that produces scarves. 
The firm already has a factory, so it is operating in the

The Firm’s Shut-Down Decision
Explain the shut-down rule.
3.1	 A firm will not shut down in the long run as long as its 
revenue is 
 (larger/smaller) than the firm’s 
variable cost.
3.2	 Your firm has a total revenue of $500, a total cost 
of $700, and a variable cost of $600. You should 
 (operate/shut down) because 
 
exceeds 
.
3.3	 In the short run, a firm should shut down when price 
is less than the minimum of the 
.
3.4	 Suppose Tim’s cowboy boot factory produces in a per-
fectly competitive market. The average total cost of pro-
ducing cowboy boots is $65, the average variable cost is 
$60, and the price of a pair of cowboy boots is $62. If 
the firm is producing the level of output where marginal 
cost is 
 (equal to/greater than/less than) price, 
then in the short run, the firm should continue to pro-
duce since total revenue exceeds total variable cost.

3.6	 Advice for an Unprofitable Firm. You’ve been hired 
as an economic consultant by a price-taking firm that 
produces baseball caps. The firm already has a factory, 
so it is operating in the short run. The price of caps is 
$5, the hourly wage is $12, and each cap requires $1 
worth of material. The firm has experimented with 
different workforces and the results are shown in the 
first two columns of the following table.
a.	 Fill in the blanks in the table.
b.	Is it sensible to continue to operate at a loss with 
14 workers?

c.	 Would it be better to operate with 15 workers?

3.7	 A Bluffing Farmer? Consider the following state-
ment from a wheat farmer to his workers: “The 
price of wheat is very low this year, and the most 
I can get for the crop is $35,000. If I paid you the 
same amount as I paid you last year ($30,000), I’d 
lose money because I also have to worry about the 
$20,000 I paid 3 months ago for seed and fertilizer. 
I’d be crazy to pay a total of $50,000 to harvest a 
crop I can sell for only $35,000. If you are willing 
to work for half as much as last year ($15,000), my 
total cost will be $35,000, so I’ll break even. If you 
don’t take a pay cut, I won’t harvest the wheat.” Is 
the farmer bluffing, or will the farm workers really 
lose their jobs if they reject the proposed pay cut?
3.8	 Operate or Shut Down? In Figure 24.4 on page 547, 
suppose the market price of shirts drops to $2. At 
this price, the marginal principle will be satisfied at 
a point below point 
 on the marginal-cost 
curve. Price is 
 (less/greater) than AVC, 
so the firm will be better off 
 (operating/
shutting down).
Short-Run Supply Curves
Explain why the short-run supply curve is positively sloped.
4.1	 A firm’s short-run supply curve shows the relation-
ship between 
 on the horizontal axis and 
 on the vertical axis.
4.2	 The part of a firm’s marginal cost curve that is above 
the minimum of the average variable cost curve is also 
the firm’s 
 curve.
4.3	 A perfectly competitive industry has 100 identical 
firms. At a price of $8, the typical firm supplies seven 
units of output, so the market quantity supplied is 
 units of output.
4.4	 Figure 24.6 on page 550 shows a long-run equilibrium 
because (1) the quantity 
 equals the quantity 
; (2) the typical firm maximizes 
 
by picking the quantity at which 
 equals 
; (3) each firm makes 
 economic 
profit because 
 equals 
.
4.5	 A firm making zero economic profit stays in the mar-
ket because total revenue is high enough to cover all 
the firm’s costs, including the opportunity costs of the 
entrepreneur’s 
 and 
.
4.6	 As the price of shipping services increases, the quan-
tity supplied 
 as firms deploy 
 
ships and as each ship travels 
. (Related to 
Application 4 on page 551.)
4.7	 Soybeans versus Processor Chips. Why is the mar-
ket for soybeans perfectly competitive, with thousands 
of soybean farmers, while the market for computer 
processor chips is dominated by a few large firms? 
(Related to Application 1 on page 541.)
4.8	 Draw the Supply Curves. The following table shows 
short-run marginal costs for a perfectly competitive 
firm:

a.	 Use this information to draw the firm’s marginal-
cost curve.
b.	Suppose the shut-down price is $10. Draw the 
firm’s short-run supply curve.
c.	 Suppose there are 100 identical firms with the same 
marginal-cost curve. Draw the short-run industry 
supply curve.
4.9	 Equilibrium and Break-Even Price. Explain why 
the equilibrium price in a perfectly competitive indus-
try is sometimes below the break-even price, some-
times above it, and sometimes equal to it.
4.10	 Maximizing the Profit Margin? According to the 
marginal principle, the firm should choose the quan-
tity of output at which price equals marginal cost. A 
tempting alternative is to maximize the firm’s profit 
margin, defined as the difference between price and 
short-run average total cost. Use the firm’s short-run 
cost curves to evaluate this approach. Draw the firm’s 
short-run supply curve and compare it to the supply 
curve of a firm that maximizes its profit.
4.11	 Expand If Profit Margin Is Positive? Consider a 
firm that uses the following rule to decide how much 
output to produce: If the profit margin (price minus 
short-run average total cost) is positive, the firm will 
produce more output. Use the firm’s short-run cost 
curves to evaluate this approach. Draw the firm’s 
short-run supply curve and compare it to the short-
run supply curve of a profit-maximizing firm.
The Long-Run Supply Curve for an Increasing-Cost 
Industry
Explain why the long-run industry supply curve may be 
positively sloped.
5.1	 An increasing-cost industry is one in which the aver-
age cost of production 
 as the total output 
of the industry 
.

562
5.2	 Arrows up or down: Costs 
 with output 
in an increasing-cost industry because input prices 
increase as the industry competes for scarce resources 
and firms may be forced to use less productive inputs.
5.3	 Heterogeneous inputs in a perfectly competitive mar-
ket will cause the industry to face 
 costs 
because as the firm produces more, it is forced to use 
 productive inputs.
5.4	 In Table 24.4 on page 552, suppose the relationship 
between industry output and the total cost for the typ-
ical firm is linear, and each firm produces six shirts. If 
there are 400 firms in the industry, the total cost for 
the typical firm is $
, and the average cost 
per shirt is $
. Another point on the sup-
ply curve is a price of $
 and a quantity of 
 shirts.
5.5	 An increase in the price of shirts will cause firms to 
 the industry, and as output increases, the 
 cost of production increases. Entry will 
continue until 
 equals 
.
5.6	 Land-use zoning that limits the amount of land for 
apartments generates a relatively 
 (flat/
steep) supply curve for housing, so an increase in the 
demand for apartments leads to a relatively 
 
(large/small) increase in price.
5.7	 An increase in the price of coffee increased the quan-
tity supplied as land was converted from growing 
 to growing coffee. (Related to Application 5  
on page 554.)
5.8	 Copper Price Elasticity of Supply. Suppose the 
price of copper increases from $1,500 to $2,500 per 
ton and the quantity supplied increases from 9 million 
tons to 11 million tons. Use the midpoint formula to 
compute the price elasticity of supply for copper.
5.9	 Sugar Import Ban. Suppose that initially there are no 
controls on sugar imported into the United States, so 
the price paid in the United States equals the prevail-
ing world price.
a.	 If the world price is 13 cents per pound, what areas 
of the world supply sugar to the world market and 
the United States?
b.	Suppose the United States bans sugar imports. The 
new price of sugar will be at least $
.
5.10	 Long-Run Supply Curve of Lamps. Suppose each 
lamp manufacturer produces 10 lamps per hour. 
Complete the following table. Then use the data in 
the table to draw the long-run supply curve for lamps.

5.11	 How Steep a Supply Curve? Consider two cities, 
one on a small island, and a second on a large plain.
a.	 Draw a long-run supply curve for housing for each 
city, and explain any differences between the two 
supply curves.
b.	If demand for housing increases by the same 
amount in each city, which city will experience a 
larger increase in price?
Short-Run and Long-Run Effects of Changes in Demand
Describe the short-run and long-run effects of changes in 
demand for an increasing-cost industry.
6.1	 The short-run supply curve is steeper than the long-run 
supply curve because of the principle of 
.
6.2	 Arrows up or down: Suppose the demand for shirts 
increases. In the short run, the price

relatively large amount. As firms enter the market,

page 556.)
6.3	 Suppose a perfectly competitive industry is in long-
run equilibrium. If demand for its product increases, 
we can expect the price of the good to 
 
(rise/fall) at first and then 
 (rise/fall).
6.4	 Increase in Housing Demand in Britain versus the 
United States. Suppose that in both Britain and the 
United States, the initial equilibrium price of housing 
is $200,000. Britain has more severe restrictions on 
residential development in the short run. Suppose the 
demand for housing increases by the same amount in 
the two countries.
a.	 Draw a set of supply and demand curves showing 
the effects on housing prices in the short run.
b.	The price increase is larger in 
 because 
that country has a relatively 
 supply 
curve.
c.	 Suppose the long-run supply curves in the two 
countries have the same slope. Show the long-run 
effects of the increase in demand.
d.	In the long run, Britain’s price of housing is 
 (higher/lower/the same).
Long-Run Supply for a Constant-Cost Industry
Describe the short-run and long-run effects of changes in 
demand for a constant-cost industry.
7.1	 A constant-cost industry is one in which 
 
do not change as output changes in the long run.
7.2	 A constant-cost industry is more likely to arise in a 
market where the industry uses a 
 (small/
large) portion of the resources available.

7.3	 Arrow up, down, or horizontal: In a constant-cost 
industry, when demand increases the long-run equi-
librium price

page 558.)
7.4	 The Price of Haircuts. The haircutting industry in 
your city uses a tiny fraction of the electricity, scis-
sors, and commercial space available on the market. 
In addition, the industry employs only about 100 of 
the 50,000 people who could cut hair.
a.	 Draw a long-run supply curve for haircutting in 
your city.
b.	Suppose the initial equilibrium price of haircuts 
is $12. Draw demand and supply graphs to show 
the short-run and long-run effects of an increase 
in population. Does population growth affect the 
long-run equilibrium price of haircuts?
7.5	 Margarine Prices. Several years ago, people became 
concerned about the undesirable health effects of eat-
ing margarine. The demand for margarine dropped, 
decreasing its price. Some time later, the price started 
rising steadily, although demand hadn’t been chang-
ing. After several months of price hikes, the price of 
margarine reached the price observed before demand 
decreased. A blogger suggested that the rising price 
was evidence of a conspiracy on the part of margarine 
producers. Provide an alternative explanation for the 
rising price of margarine and its eventual return to the 
original price. (Related to Application 7 on page 558.)
7.6	 The Price of Tattoos. According to a market expert, 
tattooing in your city is a constant-cost industry. The 
initial equilibrium price is $24.
a.	 Arrows up or down: In the long run the wage of tat-
too artists 
 as industry output increases.
b.	If the demand for tattoos doubles and stays at the 
higher level for 3 years, the price of tattoos 3 years 
from now will be $

MyLab Economics helps you master each 
­objective and study more efficiently.
When does a firm have an 
­opportunity to charge different 
prices to different consumers?
On a hot day, are you willing to pay more than you nor-
mally would for an ice-cold can of Coke? If so, you’re 
the type of consumer Coca-Cola Company had in mind 
when it developed a high-tech vending machine, com-
plete with heat sensors and microchips, that charges a 
higher price when the weather is hot. The idea behind 
the new machine is that consumers’ willingness to pay 
for a cold drink increases when it is hot, so the vending-
machine price rises too.
The announcement of the new vending machine generated howls of protest from consumers. In response, the 
Coca-Cola Company said that it would not actually use the new machine, but was simply exploring innovative tech-
nology that could provide an interactive experience for a consumer purchasing a soft drink from a vending machine. 
Based on the reaction to the news of the heat-sensing vending machine, you can imagine the interactive experience 
when a hot and thirsty consumer discovers the higher price for a cold drink on a hot day.

Chapter 25 • Monopoly and Price Discrimination
565
I
n the previous chapter we explored the decisions made by firms in a perfectly com-
petitive market, a market in which there are many firms. This chapter deals with 
the opposite extreme: a monopoly, a market in which a single firm sells a product 
that does not have any close substitutes. In contrast with a perfectly competitive, or 
price-taking, firm, a monopolist controls the price of its product, so we can refer to a 
monopolist as a price maker. A monopolist has market power, the ability to affect the 
price of its product. Of course, consumers obey the law of demand, and the higher the 
monopolist’s price, the smaller the quantity it will sell.
A monopoly occurs when a barrier to entry prevents a second firm from entering 
a profitable market. Among the possible barriers to entry are patents, network exter-
nalities, government licensing, the ownership or control of a key resource, and large 
economies of scale in production:
• A patent grants an inventor the exclusive right to sell a new product for some 
period of time, currently 20 years under international rules.
• When the value of a product to a consumer increases with the number of con-
sumers who use it, network externalities are at work. For example, the larger 
the number of people on an online social network, the greater the opportunities 
for interaction. Similarly, the larger the number of people using a software appli-
cation such as a word processor, the greater the opportunities to share files. 
Network externalities provide an advantage to existing firms and may inhibit the 
entry of new ones.
• Under a licensing policy, the government chooses a single firm to sell a particular 
product. Some examples are licensing for radio and television stations, off-street 
parking in cities, and vendors in national parks.
• If a firm owns or controls a key resource, the firm can prevent entry by refusing 
to sell the input to other firms. The classic example is DeBeers, the South African 
company that controls about 80 percent of the world’s production of diamonds. 
Before the 1940s, the Aluminum Company of America—ALCOA—had long-
term contracts to buy most of the world’s available bauxite, a key input to the 
production of aluminum.
• A natural monopoly occurs when the scale economies in production are so large 
that only a single large firm can earn a profit. The market can support only one 
profitable firm because if a second firm entered the market, both firms would 
lose money. Some examples are cable TV service, electricity transmission, and 
water systems.
In this chapter, we discuss “unnatural” monopolies, which result from artificial barriers 
to entry. Later in the book, we explore the reasons for natural monopolies and various 
public policies to control them.
This chapter examines the production and pricing decisions of a monopoly and 
explores the implications for society as a whole. As we’ll see, monopoly is inefficient 
from society’s perspective because it produces too little output. We also discuss the 
trade-offs with patents, which lead to monopoly and higher prices but also encourage 
innovation. We also explore the issue of price discrimination, which occurs when firms 
such as airlines and movie theaters charge different prices to different types of consum-
ers. Although we discuss price discrimination in a monopoly, it also happens in markets 
with more firms, including oligopoly (a few firms) and monopolistic competition (many 
firms selling differentiated products).
The Monopolist’s Output Decision
Like other firms, a monopolist must decide how much output to produce, given its objec-
tive of maximizing its profit. We learned about production costs in an earlier chapter, so 
we start our discussion of the monopolist’s output decision with the revenue side of the 
profit picture. Then we show how a monopolist picks the profit-maximizing quantity.

Total Revenue and Marginal Revenue
A firm’s total revenue—the money it gets by selling its product—equals the price times 
the quantity sold. In this part of the chapter, we assume that the monopolist charges 
the same price to each customer. The table in Figure 25.1 shows how to use a demand 
schedule (in columns 1 and 2) to compute a firm’s total revenue (in column 3). At a 
price of $16, the firm doesn’t sell anything, so its total revenue is zero. To sell the first 
unit, the firm must cut its price to $14, so its total revenue is $14. To get consumers 
to buy two units instead of just one, the firm must cut its price to $12, so the total rev-
enue for selling two units is $24. As the price continues to drop and the quantity sold 
increases, total revenue increases for a while but then starts falling. To sell five units 
instead of four, the firm cuts its price from $8 to $6, and total revenue decreases from 
$32 to $30. The total revenue for selling six units is even lower, only $24.
▲  Figure 25.1  The Demand Curve and the Marginal-Revenue Curve
Marginal revenue equals the price for the first unit sold, but is less than the price for additional units sold. 
To sell an additional unit, the firm cuts the price and receives less revenue on the units that could have 
been sold at the higher price. The marginal revenue is positive for the first four units, and negative for 
larger quantities.

The firm’s marginal revenue is defined as the change in total revenue that results 
from selling one more unit of output. You can see this in column 4 of the table in Fig-
ure 25.1. For example, the marginal revenue for the third unit is $6, equal to the total 
revenue from selling three units ($30) minus the total revenue from selling only two 

Chapter 25 • Monopoly and Price Discrimination
567
units ($24). As shown in the table, marginal revenue is positive for the first four units 
sold. Beyond that point, selling an additional unit actually decreases total revenue, so 
marginal revenue is negative. For example, the marginal revenue for the fifth unit is 
-$2, and the marginal revenue for the sixth unit is -$6.
The table in Figure 25.1 illustrates the trade-offs faced by a monopolist in cutting 
the price to sell a larger quantity. When the firm cuts its price from $12 to $10, there 
is good news and bad news:
• Good news: The firm collects $10 from the new customer (the third), so revenue 
increases by $10.
• Bad news: The firm cuts the price for all its customers, so it gets less revenue 
from the customers who would have been willing to pay the higher price of $12. 
Specifically, the firm collects $2 less from each of the two original customers, so 
revenue from the original customers decreases by $4.
The combination of good news and bad news leads to a net increase in total revenue 
of only $6, equal to $10 gained from the new customer minus $4 lost on the first two 
customers.
Our discussion of good news and bad news has revealed a key feature of a monop-
oly: Marginal revenue is less than price. To sell one more unit, the monopolist must cut 
its price, and the difference between marginal revenue and price is the bad news—the 
loss in revenue from consumers who would have bought the good at the higher price. 
In fact, this is true for any firm that must cut its price to sell more.
You may recall from the previous chapter that marginal revenue is different for 
a perfectly competitive firm, which can sell as much as it wants at the market price. 
If a perfectly competitive firm sells one unit at $12, it can sell a second unit at the 
same price, so its marginal revenue is $12 for the second unit sold, just as it was $12 
for the first unit sold. For a perfectly competitive firm, marginal revenue is always 
equal to the price, no matter how many units the firm sells. A perfectly competitive 
firm does not cut the price to sell more, so there is no bad news associated with 
selling more. 
A Formula for Marginal Revenue
We can use a simple formula to compute marginal revenue. The formula quantifies the 
good news and bad news from selling one more unit:
marginal revenue = new price + (slope of demand curve * old quantity)
The first part of the formula is the good news, the money received for the extra unit 
sold. The second part is the bad news from selling one more unit, the revenue lost 
by cutting the price for the original customers. The revenue change equals the price 
change required to sell one more unit—the slope of the demand curve, which is a nega-
tive number—times the number of original customers who get a price cut.
We can illustrate this formula with an example. Suppose the monopolist wants to 
increase the quantity sold from two to three, so it cuts the price from $12 to $10. The 
new price is $10, the old quantity is two units, and the slope of the demand curve is 
-$2, so marginal revenue is $6:
marginal revenue = $10 - ($2 per unit * 2 units) = $6
Similarly, to sell the fifth unit, the firm would cut the price from $8 to $6, and marginal 
revenue is actually negative:
marginal revenue = $6 - ($2 per unit * 4 units) = -$2
Marginal revenue is negative because the $8 revenue lost from the original customers 
exceeds the $6 gain from the new customer. This happens because there are so many 
original customers who get a price cut. If a monopolist continues to cut its price, mar-
ginal revenue will eventually become negative because there will be so many consumers 
who get price cuts.

part 9
568
The graph in Figure 25.1 shows the demand curve and marginal-revenue curve for 
the data shown in the table. For the first unit sold, the marginal revenue equals the price. 
Because the firm must cut its price to sell more output, the marginal-revenue curve 
lies below the demand curve. For example, the demand curve shows that the firm will 
sell three units at a price of $10 (point c), but the marginal revenue for this quantity is 
only $6 (point h). The firm will sell five units at a price of $6 (point e), but the marginal 
revenue for this quantity is -$2 (point i ). The marginal revenue is positive for the first 
four units and negative for larger quantities. 
Using the Marginal Principle
A monopolist can use the marginal principle to decide how much output to produce. 
Suppose a firm called Curall holds a patent on a new drug that cures the common cold 
and must decide how much of the drug to produce.
▲  Figure 25.2  The Monopolist Picks a Quantity and a Price
To maximize profit, the monopolist picks point a, where marginal revenue equals marginal cost. The 
monopolist produces 900 doses per hour at a price of $15 (point b). The average cost is $8 (point c), so 
the profit per dose is $7 (equal to the $15 price minus the $8 average cost) and the total profit is $6,300 
(equal to $7 per dose times 900 doses). The profit is shown by the shaded rectangle.

Increase the level of an activity as long as its marginal benefit 
exceeds its marginal cost. Choose the level at which the marginal 
benefit equals the marginal cost.
The firm’s activity is producing the cold drug, and it will pick the quantity at which the 
marginal revenue from selling one more dose equals the marginal cost of production.
In Figure 25.2, the first two columns of the table (see p. 569) show the relationship 
between the price of the cold drug and the quantity demanded. We can use these num-
bers to draw the market demand curve, as shown in the graph in Figure 25.2. Because the 
firm is a monopolist—the only seller of the drug—the market demand curve shows how 
much the firm will sell at each price. The demand curve is negatively sloped, consistent 
with the law of demand. For example, at a price of $18 per dose, the quantity demanded 
is 600 doses per hour (point f), compared to 900 doses at a price of $15 (point b).

Like other monopolists, the firm must cut its price to sell a larger quantity, so mar-
ginal revenue is less than price. This is shown in the third column of the table as well 
as the graph. We can use the marginal-revenue formula explained earlier to compute 
marginal revenue for different quantities of output:
marginal revenue = new price + (slope of demand curve * old quantity)
The slope of the demand curve is -$0.01 per dose. To simplify the arithmetic, rather 
than using the “new” price and “old” quantity, we can use a matched pair of price and 
quantities from the demand curve to get an approximation of marginal revenue. When 
the change in price is relatively small (for example, $0.01) the difference between the 
new and old price is small enough to be ignored. For example, at a price of $18, the 
quantity sold is 600 doses, so marginal revenue is $12:
marginal revenue = $18 - ($0.01 * 600 doses) = $12
Similarly, at a price of $15, the quantity is 900 doses and marginal revenue is $6:
marginal revenue = $15 - ($0.01 * 900 doses) = $6
We’re ready to show how a monopolist can use the marginal principle to pick a 
quantity to produce. To maximize its profit, the firm will produce the quantity at which 
the marginal revenue equals marginal cost. As shown in the fourth row in the table in 
Figure 25.2, this happens with a quantity of 900 doses. In the graph, the marginal-rev-
enue curve intersects the marginal-cost curve at point a, with a quantity of 900 doses, 
so that’s the quantity that maximizes profit. To get consumers to buy this quantity, 
the price must be $15 (point b on the demand curve). The average cost of production 
is $8 per dose (shown by point c).
We can compute the firm’s profit in two ways. First, profit equals total revenue 
minus total cost:
 profit = total revenue - total cost 
 profit = $15 per dose * 900 doses - $8 per dose * 900 doses = $6,300
Second, we can compute the profit per dose and multiply it by the number of doses:
profit = profit per dose * quantity of doses
The profit per dose is the price minus the average cost: $7 = $15 - $8:
profit = $7 per dose * 900 doses = $6,300
To show that a quantity of 900 doses maximizes the firm’s profit, let’s see what would 
happen if the firm picked some other quantity. Suppose the firm decided to produce 
599 doses per hour at a price just above $18 (just above point f on the demand curve). 
Could the firm make more profit by cutting the price by enough to sell one more dose? 
The firm should answer two questions:
• What is the extra cost associated with producing dose number 600? As shown 
by point d on the marginal-cost curve, the marginal cost of the 600th dose is $4.

part 9
570
• What is the extra revenue associated with dose number 600? As shown by point 
e on the marginal-revenue curve, the marginal revenue is $12.
If the firm wants to maximize its profit, it should produce the 600th dose because the 
$12 extra revenue exceeds the $4 extra cost, meaning the firm’s profit will increase 
by $8. The same argument applies, with different numbers for marginal revenue and 
marginal cost, for doses 601, 602, and so on, up to 900 doses. The firm should continue 
to increase the quantity produced as long as the marginal revenue exceeds the marginal 
cost. The marginal principle is satisfied at point a, with a total of 900 doses.
Why should the firm stop at 900 doses? Beyond 900 doses, the marginal revenue 
from an additional dose will be less than the marginal cost associated with producing 
it. Although the firm could cut its price and sell a larger quantity, an additional dose 
would add less to revenue than it adds to cost, so the firm’s total profit would decrease. 
As shown in the fifth row in the table in Figure 25.2, the firm could sell 1,000 doses at 
a price of $14, but the marginal revenue at this quantity is only $4, while the marginal 
cost at this quantity is $6.70. Producing the 1,000th dose would decrease the firm’s 
profit by $2.70. For any quantity exceeding 900 doses, the marginal revenue is less than 
the marginal cost. Therefore, the firm should produce exactly 900 doses.
Let’s review what we’ve learned about how a monopolist picks a quantity and how 
to compute the monopoly profit. The three-step process is as follows:
1	 Find the quantity that satisfies the marginal principle, that is, the quantity at which 
marginal revenue equals marginal cost. In the example shown in Figure 25.2, mar-
ginal revenue equals marginal cost at point a, so the monopolist produces 900 doses.
2	 Using the demand curve, find the price associated with the monopolist’s chosen 
quantity. In Figure 25.2, the price required to sell 900 doses is $15 (point b).

Marginal Revenue From a Baseball Fan
Applying the Concepts #1: How does a monopolist maximize profit?
MR = $24 - 0.002 * 20,000 = -16
In this case, cutting the price to sell one more ticket generates 
good news ($24 collected from the new fan) that is less than 
the bad news (the $40 lost on the 20,000 fans who would have 
paid the higher price). The marginal revenue is negative, so the 
team could increase its total revenue from tickets by increasing 
the price and decreasing the quantity of tickets sold. Why don’t 
MLB teams increase their ticket prices?
The solution to this puzzle is concessions. Suppose the 
average MLB fan spends $20 per game on merchandise that 
costs the owner about $4 to provide. In this case, each ticket 
sold generates an additional $16 in net concession revenue to the 
owner, just enough to offset the $16 revenue loss on ticket sales. 
Once we expand the definition of marginal revenue to include the 
net revenue from concessions, the owner’s choice is consistent 
with profit maximization. What appears to be too low a price 
could be just about right.  Related to Exercises 1.8 and 1.9.

Concession?: Understanding Price Elasticity in Professional Sports,” Journal of 
Sports Economics 8 (2007), pp. 183–191.
We expect the owner of a major league baseball (MLB) team to 
choose the quantity (the number of fans at the game) at which 
marginal revenue equals marginal cost (MR = MC). The mar-
ginal cost of an additional fan is close to zero, so the profit-
maximization rule simplifies to MR = 0. And yet for the typical 
team, it appears that MR is actually negative: adding fans by 
selling more tickets actually decreases total revenue from tick-
ets. What explains this puzzling behavior?
We can illustrate the puzzle with a simple example. Sup-
pose that with a ticket price of $24, the team sells 20,000 
tickets. If the slope of the demand curve is -0.002, marginal 
revenue is - $16:

3	 Compute the monopolist’s profit. The profit per unit sold equals the price 
minus the average cost, and the total profit equals the profit per unit times 
the number of units sold. In Figure 25.2, the profit is shown by the shaded 
rectangle, with height equal to the profit per unit sold and width equal to the 
number of units sold. 
The Social Cost of Monopoly
Why should we as a society be concerned about monopoly? Most people are not sur-
prised to hear that a monopolist uses its market power to charge a relatively high 
price. If this were the end of the story, a monopolist would simply gain at the expense 
of consumers. In other words, a monopoly would change how we slice the economic 
“pie,” with a bigger slice for producers and a smaller slice for consumers. As we’ll see 
in this part of the chapter, the social consequences of monopoly go beyond a different 
slicing of the pie: A monopoly causes inefficiency and actually reduces the size of the 
pie, so there is less to divide among consumers and producers.
Deadweight Loss from Monopoly
How does a monopoly differ from a perfectly competitive market? To show the dif-
ference, let’s consider an example of an arthritis drug that could be produced by a 
monopoly or a perfectly competitive industry. Let’s take the long-run perspective—a 
period of time long enough that a firm is perfectly flexible in its choice of inputs and 
can enter or leave the market.
Consider the monopoly outcome first. Let’s assume the long-run average cost 
of producing the arthritis drug is constant at $8 per dose. As we saw in the chapter 
on production and cost, if average cost is constant, the marginal cost equals the aver-
age cost. In Panel A of Figure 25.3, the long-run marginal-cost curve is the same as 
the long-run average-cost curve. Given the demand and marginal-revenue curves in 
Panel A of Figure 25.3, the monopolist will maximize profit where marginal revenue 
equals marginal cost (point a), producing 200 doses per hour at a price of $18 per 
dose (point b). The monopolist’s profit is $2,000 per hour—a $10 profit per dose 
($18 - $8) times 200 doses.

▲  Figure 25.3  Monopoly versus Perfect Competition: Its Effect on Price and Quantity
(A) The monopolist picks the quantity at which the long-run marginal cost equals marginal revenue—200 
doses per hour, as shown by point a. As shown by point b on the demand curve, the price required to sell 
this quantity is $18 per dose. (B) The long-run supply curve of a perfectly competitive, constant-cost industry 
intersects the demand curve at point c. The equilibrium price is $8, and the equilibrium quantity is 400 doses.

Consider next the market for the arthritis drug under perfect competition. We’re 
assuming the arthritis drug industry is a constant-cost industry: Input prices do not 
change as the industry grows, so the long-run market supply curve is horizontal at 
the long-run average cost of producing the drug, which is $8 per dose. In Panel B of 
Figure 25.3, the horizontal long-run supply curve intersects the demand curve at point 
c, with an equilibrium price of $8 and an equilibrium quantity of 400 doses per hour. 
Compared to a monopoly outcome, the perfectly competitive outcome has a lower 
price ($8 instead of $18 per dose) and a larger quantity (400 doses instead of 200).
To examine the social cost of monopoly power, let’s imagine we start with a per-
fectly competitive market, and then switch to a monopoly. Consumers will be worse 
off under monopoly, and we can use the concept of consumer surplus to determine 
just how much worse off they will be. As we saw in the chapter on market efficiency, 
consumer surplus is shown by the area between the demand curve and the horizontal 
price line. In Figure 25.4, the monopoly price is $18, so the consumer surplus with a 
monopoly is shown by triangle A. In contrast, the perfectly competitive price is $8, so 
the consumer surplus with perfect competition is shown by the larger triangle consist-
ing of triangle A, rectangle B, and triangle D. In other words, a switch from perfect 
competition to monopoly decreases consumer surplus by the areas B and D.
▲  Figure 25.4  The Deadweight Loss from a Monopoly
A switch from perfect competition to monopoly increases the price from $8 to $18 and decreases the 
quantity sold from 400 to 200 doses. Consumer surplus decreases by an amount shown by the areas B 
and D, while profit increases by the amount shown by rectangle B. The net loss to society is shown by 
triangle D, the deadweight loss from monopoly.

We can use some simple geometry to compute the reduction in consumer surplus. 
The formula for the area of a rectangle is
area of rectangle = base * height
In Figure 25.4, the base of rectangle B is 200 and the height is $10, so the area is $2,000:
area of rectangle B = 200 doses * $10 per dose = $2,000
The switch to monopoly increases the price by $10 per dose, so consumers pay $10 
extra on the 200 doses they buy from the monopolist, resulting in a loss of $2,000. The 
other part of the consumer loss is triangle D. The formula for the area of a triangle is
area of triangle = 1/2 * base * height
In Figure 25.4, the base of triangle D is 200 and the height is $10, so the area is $1,000:
area of triangle D = 1/2 * 200 doses * $10 per dose = $1,000

Chapter 25 • Monopoly and Price Discrimination
573
The switch to monopoly increases the price and decreases the quantity demanded because 
consumers obey the law of demand. Consumers lose consumer surplus on the doses they 
would have consumed at the lower price, and this $1,000 loss is shown by triangle D. The 
total loss of consumers is the sum of the areas of rectangle B and triangle D, or $3,000.
It’s clear that consumers lose from monopoly, but what about the monopolist? 
Under perfect competition, each firm makes zero economic profit. In contrast, the 
monopolist earns positive economic profit, shown by rectangle B in Figure 25.4. 
The monopolist’s profit per dose is $10, the $18 price minus the $8 average cost. 
The monopolist’s profit is $2,000:
profit = $10 per dose * 200 doses = $2,000
This $2,000 gain by the monopolist comes at the expense of consumers.
Because the monopolist recovers only part of the loss experienced by consumers, 
there is a net loss from switching to monopoly. Consumers lose rectangle B and triangle 
D, but the monopolist gains only rectangle B. That leaves triangle D as the net decrease 
in the market surplus, or the deadweight loss from monopoly. The word deadweight 
indicates this loss is not offset by a gain to anyone. Triangle D measures the consumer 
surplus lost because the monopoly produces less output than a perfectly competitive 
market. The monopolist prevents consumers from getting consumer surplus for the 
201st through the 400th units of output, meaning it reduces the size of the economic 
pie and causes inefficiency. The lesson is that monopoly is inefficient because it gener-
ates less output than a perfectly competitive market. 
Rent Seeking: Using Resources to Get Monopoly Power
Another source of inefficiency from a monopoly is the use of resources to acquire 
monopoly power. Because a monopoly is likely to earn a profit, firms are willing to 
spend money to persuade the government to erect barriers to entry that grant monop-
oly power through licenses, franchises, and tariffs. In Figure 25.4, a firm would be 
willing to spend up to $2,000 per hour to get a monopoly on the arthritis drug. One 
way to get monopoly power is to hire lobbyists to persuade legislators and other poli-
cymakers to grant monopoly power. Rent seeking is the process of using public policy 
to gain economic profit.
Rent seeking is inefficient because it uses resources that could be used in other 
ways. For example, the people employed as lobbyists could instead produce goods and 
services. In Figure 25.4, if the monopolist spent all its potential profit of $2,000 per 
hour on rent-seeking activity, the net loss to society would be areas B and D, not just 
area D. A classic study of rent seeking by economist Richard Posner found that firms in 
some industries spent up to 30 percent of their total revenue to get monopoly power.1
The chapter opener provides an example of rent seeking. Beverage companies 
pay millions of dollars to universities to get a monopoly on campus beverages. 
Like any monopolist, a beverage company will use its monopoly power to charge 
higher prices, so students pay, indirectly, for the programs supported by the 
beverage companies, for example recreational sports and intercollegiate athletic 
programs. 
Monopoly and Public Policy
Given the social costs of monopoly, the government uses a number of policies to 
intervene in markets dominated by a single firm or likely to become a monopoly. We 
examine these policies later in the book. In the case of natural monopoly—a market 
that can support only a single firm—the government can intervene by regulating the 
price the natural monopolist charges. In other markets, the government uses antitrust 
policies to break monopolies into smaller companies and prevent corporate mergers 
that would lead to others. These policies are designed to promote competition, leading 
to lower prices and more production.

Patents and Monopoly Power
One source of monopoly power is a government patent that gives a firm the exclu-
sive right to produce a product for 20 years. As we’ll see, a patent encourages 
innovation because the innovators know they will earn monopoly profits on a new 
product over the period covered by the patent. If the monopoly profits are large 
enough to offset the substantial research and development costs of a new product, a 
firm will develop the product and become a monopolist. Granting monopoly power 
through a patent may be efficient from a social perspective because it may encourage 
the development of products that would otherwise not be developed.
Incentives for Innovation
Let’s use the arthritis drug to show why a patent encourages innovation. Suppose a 
firm called Flexjoint hasn’t yet developed the drug but believes the potential benefits 
and costs of doing so are as follows:
• The economic cost of research and development will be $14 million, including 
all the opportunity costs of the project.
• The estimated annual economic profit from a monopoly will be $2 million (in 
today’s dollars).
• Flexjoint’s competitors will need 3 years to develop and produce their own ver-
sions of the drug, so if Flexjoint isn’t protected by a patent, its monopoly will 
last only 3 years.
Based on these numbers, Flexjoint won’t develop the drug unless the firm receives 
a patent that lasts at least 7 years. That’s the length of time the firm needs to recover 
the research and development costs of $14 million ($2 million per year times 7 years). 
If there is no patent and the firm loses its monopoly in 3 years, it will earn a profit of 
$6 million, which is less than the cost of research and development. In comparison, 
with a 20-year patent the firm will earn $40 million, which is more than enough to 
recover its $14 million cost.

Rent Seeking for Tribal Casinos
Applying the Concepts #2: What is the value of a monopoly?
In 1993, seven Native American Tribes in Michigan cut a deal 
with the state. In exchange for being granted a monopoly in 
Vegas-style casino gambling, the tribes agreed to pay the 
state and local governments a share of its profits. By 1998, the 
profit sharing totaled more than $183 million. In 1998, the state 
opened gambling to other tribes, and the profit-sharing arrange-
ment stopped. This is an example of rent seeking: The tribes 
agreed to pay millions of dollars to secure a monopoly, and 
when the monopoly ended, so did the payments.  Related to 
Exercises 2.5, 2.6, and 2.7.

Trade-Offs from Patents
Is the patent for Flexjoint’s drug beneficial from a social perspective? The patent grants 
monopoly power to the firm, and the firm responds by charging a higher price and 
producing less than the quantity that would be produced in a perfectly competitive mar-
ket. Looking back at Figure 25.4, a monopolist produces 200 doses per hour instead of 
400. From society’s perspective, 400 doses are better than 200 doses, but we don’t have 
that choice. Flexjoint won’t develop the drug unless a patent protects the firm from 
competition for at least 7 years. Therefore, society’s choice is between the monopoly 
outcome of 200 doses or 0 doses. Because a quantity of 200 doses is clearly better than 
none, the patent is beneficial from society’s perspective.
What about a product a firm develops without the protection of a patent? Sup-
pose we change the Flexjoint example by altering one number: The cost of research 
and development is only $5 million, not $14 million. Suppose it still takes Flexjoint’s 
competitors 3 years to develop a substitute, and Flexjoint’s profit per year is still $2 mil-
lion. Without a patent, Flexjoint would earn an economic profit of $6 million during its 
3-year monopoly ($2 million per year times 3 years), which is more than the $5 million 
cost of research and development. Therefore, the firm would develop the new drug 
even without a patent. In this case, a patent would merely prolong a monopoly, and so 
it would be inefficient from society’s perspective.
What are the general conclusions about the merits of the patent system? It is sensible 
for a government to grant a patent for a product that would otherwise not be developed, 
but it is not sensible for other products. Unfortunately, no one knows in advance whether 
a particular product would be developed without a patent, so the government can’t be 
selective in granting patents. In some cases, patents lead to new products, although in 
other cases, they merely prolong monopoly power.

Bribing the Makers of Generic Drugs
Applying the Concepts #3: What happens when a patent expires and a monopoly ends?
In recent years, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has 
investigated allegations that the makers of branded drugs made 
deals with generic suppliers to keep generics off the market. 
The alleged practices included cash payments and exclusive 
licenses for new versions of the branded drug. In 2003, the FTC 
ruled that two drug makers had entered into an illegal agree-
ment when Schering-Plough paid Upsher-Smith Laboratories 
$60 million to delay the introduction of a low-price alternative 
to its prescription drug K-Dur 20, which is used to treat people 
with low potassium.
Another tactic is to claim that generics are not as good 
as the branded drug. DuPont has claimed that generic ver-
sions of its Coumadin (a blood thinner) are not equivalent to 
Coumadin and may pose risks to patients. Because generic 
versions are virtually identical to the branded drugs, such 
claims are not based on science.  Related to Exercises 3.4 
and 3.5.
SOURCE: Based on Federal Trade Commission, “Commission Rules Schering-
Plough, Upsher, and AHP Illegally Delayed Entry of Lower-Cost Generic Drug,” 
www.ftc.gov/opa/2003/12/schering.htm, accessed July 9, 2006.
When a patent expires, new firms enter the market, and the 
resulting competition for consumers decreases prices and 
increases quantities. In the pharmaceutical drug market, when 
the patent for a brand-name drug expires, other firms introduce 
generic versions of the drug. The generics are virtually identical 
to the original branded drug, but they sell at a much lower price. 
The producers of branded drugs have an incentive to delay the 
introduction of generic drugs and sometimes use illegal means 
to do so.

Price Discrimination
Up to this point in the book, we’ve assumed a firm charges the same price to all its 
customers. As we’ll see in this part of the chapter, however, a firm may be able to divide 
consumers into two or more groups and sell the good at a different price to each, a 
practice known as price discrimination. For example, airlines offer discount tickets to 
travelers who are flexible in their departure times, and movie theaters have lower prices 
for senior citizens. The only legal restriction on price discrimination is that a firm can-
not use it to drive rival firms out of business.
Although price discrimination is widespread, it is not always possible. A firm has 
an opportunity for price discrimination if three conditions are met:
1	 Market power. The firm must have some control over its price, facing a nega-
tively sloped demand curve for its product. Although we discuss price discrimina-
tion by a monopolist, any firm that faces a negatively sloped demand curve can 
charge different prices to different consumers. In fact, the only type of firm that 
cannot engage in price discrimination is a perfectly competitive price-taking firm. 
Such a firm faces a horizontal demand curve, taking the market price as given. 
For all other types of markets—monopoly, oligopoly, and monopolistic competi-
tion—price discrimination is possible.
2	 Different consumer groups. Consumers must differ in their willingness to pay 
for the product or in their responsiveness to changes in price, as measured by the 
price elasticity of demand. In addition, the firm must be able to identify different 
groups of consumers. For example, an airline must be able to distinguish between 
business travelers and tourists, and a movie theater must be able to distinguish 
between seniors and nonseniors.
3	 Resale is not possible. It must be impractical for one consumer to resell the 
product to another consumer. Airlines prohibit consumers from buying and resell-
ing tickets. If airlines allowed consumers to sell discount tickets to each other, you 
could go into business as a ticket broker, buying discount airline tickets one month 
ahead and then selling them to business travelers one week before the travel date. 
In general, the possibility of resale causes price discrimination to break down.
One approach to price discrimination is to identify consumers who are not willing 
to pay the regular price and offer them a discount. Here are some examples:
• Discounts on airline tickets. Airlines offer discount tickets to travelers who 
spend Saturday night away from home because they are likely to be tourists, not 
business travelers. The typical tourist is not willing to pay as much for air travel 
as the typical business traveler. Airlines also offer discount tickets to people who 
plan weeks ahead because tourists plan further ahead than business travelers.
• Discount coupons for groceries and restaurant food. The typical coupon-
clipper is not willing to pay as much as the typical consumer.
• Manufacturers’ rebates for appliances. A person who takes the trouble to mail 
a rebate form to the manufacturer is not willing to pay as much as the typical 
consumer.
• Senior-citizen discounts on airline tickets, restaurant food, drugs, and 
entertainment. Some seniors have more time to shop for bargains, and are 
thus more sensitive to prices. Other seniors have relatively low income, and are 
willing to pay less than the typical consumer.
• Student discounts on movies and concerts. The typical student has less 
income than the typical consumer, and is thus willing to pay less for movies.
The challenge for a firm is to figure out which groups of consumers should 
get discounts. Firms can experiment with different prices and identify groups of 
consumers that are most sensitive to price. In September 2000, Amazon.com started 
charging different prices for different types of consumers. For example, consum-
ers who used Netscape’s browser paid $65 for the Planet of the Apes DVD, while

Internet Explorer users paid $75 for the same DVD.2 Prices also varied with the 
consumer’s Internet service provider and the number of previous purchases from 
Amazon. An Amazon spokeswoman said the company varied prices in a random 
fashion, as part of ongoing tests to see how consumers respond to price changes. In 
other words, it appears that Amazon was assessing the willingness to pay of different 
types of consumers. In principle, Amazon could use the data collected to develop 
systems of price discrimination, giving discounts to the most price-sensitive con-
sumers. After widespread protests of the Amazon pricing experiments, the company 
stopped the practice and issued refunds to about 7,000 consumers who had paid 
relatively high prices.
Senior Discounts in Restaurants
Consider a restaurant whose patrons fall into two groups: senior citizens and others. 
In Figure 25.5, the demand curve for senior citizens is lower than the demand curve 
for other groups, reflecting the assumption that the typical senior is willing to pay less 
than the typical nonsenior. Their lower willingness to pay could result from having 
lower income or more time to shop for low prices.
▲  Figure 25.5  The Marginal Principle and Price Discrimination
To engage in price discrimination, the firm divides potential customers into two groups and applies the 
marginal principle twice—once for each group. Using the marginal principle, the profit-maximizing prices 
are $3 for seniors (point b) and $6 for nonseniors (point d).

Under a price-discrimination plan, the restaurant will simply apply the marginal 
principle twice, once for seniors and a second time for nonseniors. This approach is 
sensible because the two groups have different demands for restaurant meals, so the 
restaurant should treat them differently. Panel A of Figure 25.5 shows how to pick a 
price for senior citizens. The marginal principle—marginal revenue equals marginal 
cost—is satisfied at point a, with 280 senior meals per day. Therefore, the appropriate 
price for seniors is $3, as shown by point b on the senior demand curve. In Panel B of 
Figure 25.5, the marginal principle is satisfied at point c for nonseniors, with 260 meals 
per day and a price of $6 per meal.
We know the application of the marginal principle maximizes profit in each segment 
of the market. Therefore, price discrimination—with a price of $3 for seniors and $6 for 
everyone else—maximizes the restaurant’s total profit. If the restaurant were instead to 
charge a single price of $5 for both groups, the profit from each group would be lower, 
so the restaurant’s total profit would be lower, too.

Price Discrimination and the Elasticity of Demand
We can use the concept of price elasticity of demand to explain why price discrimina-
tion increases the restaurant’s profit. From the chapter on elasticity, we know that when 
demand is elastic (Ed 1), there is a negative relationship between price and total revenue: 
When the price decreases, total revenue (price times quantity sold) increases because the 
percentage increase in the quantity demanded exceeds the percentage decrease in price.
Suppose the restaurant initially has a single price of $5 for both seniors and non-
seniors. Compared to other consumers, senior citizens have more elastic demand for 
restaurant meals, in part because they have lower income and more time to shop for low 
prices. A price cut for senior citizens brings good news and bad news for the restaurant:
• Good news: Demand is highly elastic, so total revenue increases by a large 
amount.
• Bad news: More meals are served, so total cost increases.
If the senior demand for meals is highly elastic—that is, Ed is well above 1.0—the good 
news will dominate the bad news: The increase in revenue will more than offset the 
increase in cost. Consequently, a price cut will increase the firm’s profit.
For nonseniors, the firm will have an incentive to increase the price above the ini-
tial common price of $5. Suppose nonseniors have a mildly elastic demand for meals, 
with Ed just above 1.0. A price hike for nonseniors brings bad news on the revenue side 
and good news on the cost side:
• Bad news: Demand is mildly elastic, so total revenue decreases by a small 
amount.
• Good news: Fewer meals are served, so total cost decreases.
If the demand by nonseniors is mildly elastic, the good news will dominate the bad 
news: The savings in production costs will exceed the revenue loss. Consequently, the 
price hike for nonseniors will increase the firm’s profit. 
Examples: Movie Admission versus Popcorn, and Hardback 
versus Paperback Books
Why do senior citizens pay less than everyone else for admission to a movie, but the same 
as everyone else for popcorn? As we’ve seen, a senior discount is not an act of generosity 
by a firm, but an act of profit maximization. Senior citizens are typically willing to pay 
less than other citizens for movies, so a theater divides its consumers into two groups—
seniors and others—and offers a discount to seniors. This price discrimination in favor of 
senior citizens increases the theater’s profit. Why don’t theaters offer a senior discount 
for popcorn? Unlike admission to the theater, popcorn can be easily transferred from one 
customer to another. If senior citizens could buy popcorn at half the regular price, many 
nonseniors would get seniors to buy popcorn for them, so the theater wouldn’t sell as much 
popcorn at the regular price and its profit would decrease. In contrast, as long as ticket 
takers check consumers’ admissions tickets, admission to the movie is not transferable.
Why are hardback books so much more expensive than paperback books? Most 
books are published in two forms—hardback and paperback. Although the cost of 
producing a hardback book is only about 20 percent higher than producing a paper-
back, the hardback price is typically three times the paperback price. The hardback 
edition comes first, and the paperback edition is published months, or even years, 
later. Booksellers use hardbacks and paperbacks to distinguish between two types of 
consumers: those who are willing to pay a lot and those who are willing to pay a little. 
Some people are eager to read a book when it first comes out, and publishers provide 
them with high-price hardbacks. The more casual readers are willing to wait for the 
lower-priced paperback. The pricing of hardback and paperback books is another 
example of price discrimination, under which consumers with less elastic demand 
pay a higher price. 

579
In this chapter, we’ve seen 
some of the subtleties of 
monopolies and their pric-
ing policies. Compared to a 
perfectly competitive market, 
a monopoly charges a higher 
price, produces a smaller 
quantity, and wastes resources 
in the pursuit of monopoly power. On the positive side, some of the 
products we use today might never have been invented without the 
patent system and the monopoly power it grants. Firms with market 
power often use price discrimination to increase their profits. Here 
are the main points of the chapter:
1.	 Compared to a perfectly competitive market, a market 
served by a monopolist will charge a higher price, produce a 
smaller quantity of output, and generate a deadweight loss 
to society.
2.	 Some firms use resources to acquire monopoly power, a pro-
cess known as rent seeking.
3.	 Patents protect innovators from competition, leading to higher 
prices for new products but greater incentives to develop new 
products.
4.	 To engage in price discrimination, a firm divides its customers 
into two or more groups and charges lower prices to groups with 
more elastic demand.
5.	 Price discrimination is not an act of generosity; it’s an act of profit 
maximization.

Why does Movie Popcorn Cost so Much?
Applying the Concepts #4: When do firms have an opportunity to charge different prices to different 
consumers?
pay more is to jack up the price of popcorn. As a result, the 
low demanders simply pay the admission price, while the high 
demanders pay the admission price plus the jacked-up price of 
a bucket of popcorn.
We can illustrate with a simple example. Suppose a 
low demander is willing to pay $11 for a movie, while a high 
demander is willing to pay $15 for a movie and popcorn. If the 
theater charges $10 for admission and $4 for popcorn, each 
consumer will get a consumer surplus of $1 (equal to $11 - $10 
for the low demander and $15 - $14 for the high demander), 
so both consumers will see the movie. If instead the theater 
charged $12 for admission and $0.10 for popcorn, the high 
demander will see the movie, but the low demander won’t. The 
theater’s pricing strategy gets the low demander into the theater 
at a price of $10, and because the marginal cost of an additional 
consumer is close to zero, the theater’s profit increases.  Related 
to Exercise 4.3.
SOURCE: Based on Ricard Gil and Wesley Hartman, “Why Does Popcorn Cost 
So Much at the Movies?: An Empirical Analysis of Metering Price Discrimination” 
(Research Paper 1983, Stanford Graduate School of Business, 2008).
That $4 bucket of popcorn you get in the movie theater costs 
less than $0.10 to produce. What explains the 4,000 percent 
markup? Economists have struggled with this question for 
years, and now we have an answer. Moviegoers vary in their 
willingness to pay for seeing a movie, and a movie theater has 
an incentive to identify the high demanders and charge them 
more, while keeping the price low for the low demanders. It 
turns out that a reliable predictor of the willingness to pay for a 
movie is the consumption of movie popcorn: The people who 
buy a lot of popcorn are the consumers who are willing to pay 
the most for a movie experience. So a convenient way for the 
theater to charge more to the consumers who are willing to

Key  Terms
Ex ercises
The Monopolist’s Output Decision
Describe and explain a monopolist’s output decision.
1.1	 For a monopolist, marginal revenue is 
 
(greater/less) than price.
1.2	 A monopoly that cuts its price gains revenue from 
its 
 customers but loses revenue from its 
 customers.
1.3	 At a price of $18 per CD, a firm sells 60 CDs. If the 
slope of the demand curve is -$0.10, marginal revenue 
for the 61st CD is $
. The firm should cut the 
price to sell one more CD if the marginal cost is less 
than $
.
1.4	 Arrow up or down: As the quantity produced by a 
monopolist increases, the gap between the marginal-
revenue curve and demand curve 
.
1.5	 When a firm is awarded a patent, it is given monopoly 
rights to the production of that product for 
 
years.
1.6	 Arrows up or down: At a price of $18 per CD, the mar-
ginal revenue of a CD seller is $12. If the marginal cost 
of CDs is $9, the firm should 
 its price to 
 the quantity.
1.7	 Facebook is a social networking Web site that is used 
by a growing number of individuals. Because of its 
popularity, it is now more difficult for new network-
ing Web sites to enter the market and compete with 
Facebook. Facebook enjoys a 
 as a barrier 
for others to enter the market.
1.8	 The marginal cost of an additional baseball fan is 
zero, so the profit-maximizing condition simplifies to 
. (Related to Application 1 on page 570.)
1.9	 Tickets and Merchandise. Consider a baseball team 
that has a ticket price of $45 and sells 30,000 tickets at 
this price. The slope of the demand curve is -$0.002. 
The typical fan purchases $25 worth of merchandise 
that costs the owner $5 to provide.
a.	 The marginal revenue from ticket sales is 
.
b.	Including both ticket sales and merchandise, the 
marginal fan contributes an additional 
 to 
the team’s total revenue. (Related to Application 1 
on page 570.)
1.10	 Book Pricing: Publishers versus Authors. Consider 
the problem of setting a price for a book. The marginal 
cost of production is constant at $20 per book. The 
publisher knows from experience that the slope of the 
demand curve is -$0.20 per book: Starting with a price 
of $44, a price cut of $0.20 will increase the quantity 
demanded by one book. For example, here are some 
combinations of price and quantity:
Price per book
$44
$40
$36
$32
$30
Quantity of textbooks
80
100
120
140
150
a.	 What price will the publisher choose?
b.	Suppose that the author receives a royalty payment 
equal to 10 percent of the total sales revenue from 
the book. If the author could choose a price, what 
would it be?
c.	 Why would the publisher and the author disagree 
about the price for the book?
d.	Design an alternative author-compensation scheme 
under which the author and the publisher would 
choose the same price.
1.11	 Restaurant Pricing. Consider a restaurant that 
charges $10 for all you can eat and has 30 customers 
at this price. The slope of the demand curve is -$0.10 
per meal, and the marginal cost of providing a meal is 
$3. Compute the profit-maximizing price and quantity, 
and illustrate with a complete graph.
1.12	 Empty Seats. Consider the Slappers, a hockey team that 
plays in an arena with 8,000 seats. The only cost associ-
ated with staging a hockey game is a fixed cost of $6,000: 
The team incurs this cost regardless of how many peo-
ple attend a game. The demand curve for hockey tickets 
has a slope of -$0.001 per ticket ($1 divided by 1,000 
tickets): Each $1 increase in price decreases the number 
of tickets sold by 1,000. For example, here are some 
combinations of price and quantity:
Price per ticket
$4
$5
$6
$7
Quantity of tickets
8,000
7,000
6,000
5,000
All problems are assignable in MyLab Economics.

The owner’s objective is to maximize the profit per 
hockey game (total revenue minus the $6,000 fixed 
cost).
a.	 What single price will maximize profit?
b.	If the owner picks the price that maximizes profit, 
how many seats in the arena will be empty? Why is 
it rational to leave some seats empty?
c.	 Suppose the owner could engage in price discrimi-
nation. Would you expect the number of filled seats 
to increase or decrease? Explain.
1.13	 Negative Marginal Revenue. The manager of your firm 
is puzzled because the larger the quantity of output sold, 
the lower its total revenue. The manager gets weekly 
data in a table with two columns of numbers: Quantity 
Sold and Total Revenue. After you do some computa-
tions and add a third and a fourth column of numbers, 
the manager looks at the new table and says, “Aha, now 
I see why selling more decreases total revenue.”
a.	 The third column of numbers has data on 
, 
and the fourth column has data on 
.
b.	How do the additional columns of numbers explain 
the negative relationship between quantity sold and 
total revenue?
The Social Cost of Monopoly
Explain why a monopoly is socially inefficient.
2.1	 A monopoly is inefficient solely because the monopolist 
gets a profit at the expense of consumers. 
 
(True/False)
2.2	 To show the deadweight loss from monopoly, we com-
pare the monopoly outcome to what would happen 
under 
.
2.3	 Relative to a competitive market equilibrium, the profit 
maximizing quantity chosen by a monopolist will result 
in a deadweight loss because the monopolist will pro-
duce at a quantity 
 than the competitive 
equilibrium.
2.4	 The average cost for providing off-street parking is $30 
per space per day, and as a monopolist you could charge 
$35 per space per day for 200 spaces. The maximum 
amount that you are willing to pay for a monopoly is 
$
.
2.5	 The profit-sharing agreement between Michigan and 
the Native American tribes for casinos is an example of 
. (Related to Application 2 on page 574.)
2.6	 Ending a Casino Monopoly. Consider a state that 
initially has a single casino for gambling. Suppose the 
state allows a second casino to enter the market. How 
would you expect the entry of the second casino to 
affect (a) the variety of games offered in the casinos 
and (b) the payout (winnings) per dollar spent? (Related 
to Application 2 on page 574.)
2.7	 Payoff for Casino Approval. Recall the Application 
on Native American casinos in Michigan. Why aren’t 
similar deals proposed for new clothing stores, music 
stores, or auto repair shops? (Related to Application 2 
on page 574.)
2.8	 Consumer Compensation. Consider the chapter opener 
about campus beverage monopolies. Your job is to fully 
compensate each student for the cost associated with a 
soft-drink monopoly. Suppose Coca-Cola increased the 
price of soft drinks by $0.20 per can and each student con-
sumed 10 soft drinks before the monopoly was granted.
a.	 Kate continues to buy 10 soft drinks at the higher 
price. What is the appropriate compensation for her?
b.	Elise buys only four soft drinks at the higher price. 
Her demand curve is linear. What is her appropriate 
compensation? Draw a graph that shows her change 
in consumer surplus.
2.9	 Pricing with Zero Marginal Cost. Consider a natu-
ral spring that produces water with a unique taste. 
The monopolist who owns the spring has a fixed cost 
of installing plumbing to tap the water but no mar-
ginal cost. The demand curve for the spring water is 
linear. Draw a graph to show the monopolist’s choice 
of a price and quantity. At the profit-maximizing 
quantity, what is the price elasticity of demand? If 
the spring were owned by a government that applied 
the marginal principle, what price would it charge?
2.10	 Rules of Monopoly. In the board game Monopoly, 
a player who gets the third deed for a group of prop-
erties (for example, the third of three orange proper-
ties) doubles the rent charged to all other players who 
land on any property in the group. Similarly, a player 
who has a single railroad charges a rent of $25, while a 
player who has all four railroads charges a rent of $200 
for each railroad.
a.	 Are these pricing rules consistent with the analysis 
of monopoly in this chapter?
b.	In the game, is there a deadweight loss from monop-
oly? Why or why not?
2.11	 The National Park Service Monopoly. The National 
Park service grants a single firm the right to sell food 
and other goods in Yosemite National Park.
a.	 What are the trade-offs associated with this policy? 
Who gains and who loses?
b.	Does your answer to part (a) depend on whether the 
monopoly is granted as a political favor or auctioned 
to the highest bidder?
2.12	 Deadweight Loss and Demand Elasticity. Using 
Figure 25.4 as a starting point, consider a similar prod-
uct that has the same monopoly price and quantity 
($18 and 200 doses), but a more elastic demand. The 
long-run marginal cost is the same ($8).
a.	 A more elastic demand generates a 
 (flatter/ 
steeper) market demand curve.

582
b.	Draw a graph like the one shown in Figure 25.4 and 
show the deadweight loss from the monopoly on 
the product.
c.	 The deadweight loss is 
 (larger/smaller) 
than the loss shown in Figure 25.4 because the 
change in monopoly is 
 (larger/smaller).
Patents and Monopoly Power
Identify the trade-offs associated with a patent.
3.1	 A patent increases the incentive to develop new prod-
ucts because it 
 the price of the product 
and thus generates profit to cover a firm’s costs of 
.
3.2	 In some cases, a patent is socially inefficient because it 
merely 
; in other cases, a patent is socially 
beneficial because it 
.
3.3	 Consider the arthritis drug example on page 575. If 
the research and development costs are $20 million, 
Flexjoint will develop the drug if it gets a patent that 
lasts at least 
 years.
3.4	 To prolong their monopoly power, the producers of 
branded drugs pay millions of dollars to 
. 
(Related to Application 3 on page 575.)
3.5	 Paying to Keep a Generic Out. Suppose your firm 
produces a branded drug at an average cost of $2 per 
dose and a price of $5 per dose. You sell 1,000 doses per 
day. If a generic version of the drug were introduced, 
your daily sales would decrease to 400 doses. How much 
are you willing to pay each day to prevent the entry of the 
generic version? (Related to Application 3 on page 575.)
3.6	 Patent for NoSmak. A potential new drug, NoSmak, 
could cure lip-smacking with one dose, but research and 
development would cost $80 million. The monopoly 
profit (earned while a single firm produces the product) 
will be $10 million per year. After a patent expires, the 
original developer of the drug will have sufficient brand 
loyalty to earn $3 million per year for another 10 years.
a.	 What is the shortest patent length required to 
induce a firm to develop the drug?
b.	How would your answer to part (a) change if you 
ignore the profit earned after the patent expires?
Price Discrimination
Describe the practice of price discrimination.
4.1	 A price-discriminating firm will charge a higher price 
to consumers with a relatively 
 (elastic/ 
inelastic) demand and a lower price to consumers with 
a relatively 
 (elastic/inelastic) demand.
4.2	 The aspirin sold in airports is more expensive than 
aspirin sold in grocery stores because the demand for 
aspirin in airports is relatively 
.
4.3	 A reliable predictor of a consumer’s willingness to pay 
for a movie is the consumption of 
. (Related 
to Application 4 on page 579.)
4.4	 Senior citizens pay less than everyone else for admission 
to a movie, but the same as everyone else for beverages 
because beverages are 
, while admission is not.
4.5	 The price of a hardback edition of a best-selling book is 
typically three times the price of the paperback edition 
because the demand from the eager consumers who buy 
hardbacks is relatively 
 (elastic, inelastic).
4.6	 Senior Discounts for Movies. Your movie theater 
charges a single price of $6. The marginal cost of each 
patron is $1. A recent marketing survey revealed the fol-
lowing information about senior citizens and nonseniors.

Patrons

a.	 The marginal revenue for senior citizens is 
$
, while the marginal revenue for non­
seniors is $
.
b.	If your objective is to maximize profit, the marginal 
principle tells you to 
 the price for seniors 
and 
 the price for nonseniors.
4.7	 Book Pricing and Elasticity of Demand. A publisher 
initially prices both hardback books and paperback books 
at $20 per book. The hardback version comes out first, 
followed 2 months later by the paperback version. The 
publisher initially sells the same number of hardbacks and 
paperbacks (100 each). Each book costs $2 to produce.

b.	The price elasticity of demand for hardback (eager) 
buyers is 0.50, and the price elasticity of demand 
for paperback (patient) buyers is 2.00. Suppose 
the publisher increases the price for hardbacks by

4.8	 Haircuts in Mulletville. The town of Mulletville has 
a single hairstylist. The marginal cost of a haircut is the 
same for men and women ($10). The quantity of haircuts 
is 100 for men and 100 for women. The profit-maximiz-
ing price for women is $35, compared to $15 for men.
a.	 What explains the price difference?
b.	Illustrate with a complete graph.
4.9	 Tax Cuts for Discounters? Consider the following 
statement from a member of a city council: “Several 
of the merchants in our city offer discounts to our 
senior citizens. These discounts obviously decrease 
the merchants’ profits, so we should decrease the mer-
chants’ taxes to offset their losses on senior-citizen dis-
counts.” Do you agree or disagree? Explain.
4.10	 Airline Pricing. Consider an airline that initially has 
a single price of $300 for all consumers. At this price, 
it has 120 business travelers and 80 tourists. The air-
line’s marginal cost is $100. The slope of the business 
demand curve is -$2 per traveler, and the slope of the 
tourist demand curve is -$1 per traveler. Does the 
single-price policy maximize the airline’s profit? If not, 
how should it change its prices?

Price Discrimination
An experiment shows how a monopolist—a museum—picks 
different prices for different consumer groups. Here is how 
the experiment works:
• The instructor picks a group of three to five students to 
represent the museum.
• Of the remaining students—potential museum patrons—
half represent senior citizens with senior-citizen cards. 
Each consumer receives a number indicating how much 
he or she is willing to pay for a trip to a museum.
• In each round of the experiment, the museum posts two 
prices: one for senior citizens and one for nonseniors. 
Each consumer then decides whether to buy a ticket at 
the relevant posted price.
Ec ono m ic Experiment
• A consumer’s score in a particular round equals the dif-
ference between his or her given willingness to pay and 
the amount he or she actually paid for admission.
• The museum’s score in each round equals its profit, or its 
total revenue minus its total cost. The total cost equals $2 
per patron (for ticket takers, guides, cleanup, and other 
tasks) times the number of tickets sold.
• The experiment runs for five rounds. After the fifth 
round, each consumer computes his or her score by add-
ing up the consumer surpluses. The museum’s score 
equals the sum of its profits from the five rounds.

How is the price of 
­broadband service 
affected by the number 
of providers in a city? 
A survey by the Pew Research Center1 
showed that the price decreases as the 
number of providers decreases. The aver-
age monthly bill was $45 in the case of a 
single provider, compared to $43 with two 
providers, $38 with three providers, and 
$32 with four or more providers. The survey 
results illustrate the notion that an increase 
in competition decreases prices.

Chapter 26 • Market Entry and Monopolistic Competition
585
I
n this chapter, we explore a firm’s decision to enter a market and examine the conse-
quences of entry on prices and the profits of other firms. Firms will enter a market as 
long as they can make an economic profit. As we’ll see, the entry of firms squeezes 
profit in three ways: the price decreases, the average cost of production increases, and 
the quantity sold per firm decreases. Eventually the entry process stops, and we can 
count the number of firms serving the market. If entry stops at a single firm, we have a 
natural monopoly, a topic we cover later in the book. If many firms enter the market, 
we have monopolistic competition, the topic of this chapter.
Monopolistic competition is a hybrid market structure, with features of both 
monopoly and perfect competition. The term may seem like an oxymoron—a pair of 
contradictory words—similar to “virtual reality” and “books on tape.” However, the 
term actually conveys the two key features of the market:
• Each firm in the market produces a good that is slightly different from the goods 
of other firms, so each firm has a narrowly defined monopoly.
• The products sold by different firms in the market are close substitutes for one 
another, so there is intense competition between firms for consumers. For exam-
ple, your local grocery store may stock several brands of toothbrushes with dif-
ferent design features. If the price of one brand increases, some loyal customers 
will continue to buy the brand, but others will switch to different brands that 
are close substitutes.
Some other examples of monopolistic competition are the markets for bread, clothing, 
restaurant meals, and gasoline. In each case, firms in the market sell products that are 
close, but not perfect, substitutes.
The analysis in this chapter is based on two assumptions. First, we assume there are 
no barriers to entry: There are no patents or government licensing programs to restrict 
the number of firms. Second, we assume that firms do not act strategically: Each firm 
acts on its own, taking the actions of other firms as given. This means that firms already 
in the market do not conspire to fix prices and do not try to prevent other firms from 
entering the market. In the next chapter, we explore several types of strategic behavior 
in an oligopoly, a market with just a few firms.
The Effects of Market Entry
Consider a market served by a single profitable firm, a monopolist. As we saw earlier 
in the book, a firm in any market can use the marginal principle to decide how much 
output to produce.
monopolistic competition
A market served by many firms that sell 
slightly different products.
Learning Objective 26.1
Describe and explain the effects of 
market entry.
M a r g i n a l  P r i n c i p l e
Increase the level of an activity as long as its marginal benefit 
exceeds its marginal cost. Choose the level at which the marginal 
benefit equals the marginal cost.
Consider a firm whose activity is producing toothbrushes. On the cost side, the 
firm has the conventional cost curves: For small quantities produced, the average-cost 
curve is negatively sloped and marginal cost is less than average cost. On the benefit 
side, the marginal benefit of producing toothbrushes is the marginal revenue from sell-
ing one more brush. In Panel A of Figure 26.1, if a single firm produces toothbrushes, 
the firm-specific demand curve (the demand curve applicable to a specific firm) is the 
same as the market demand curve. As we saw in the chapter on monopoly, the firm’s 
marginal-revenue curve lies below the demand curve because a monopolist must cut 
its price to sell more output.

As we saw in the previous chapter, a monopolist maximizes profit by picking the 
quantity at which marginal revenue equals marginal cost. In Figure 26.1, this happens 
at point a, with a quantity of 300 toothbrushes. From point b on the demand curve, 
the price associated with this quantity is $2.00. From point c on the average-cost curve, 
we see that the average cost of this quantity is $0.90. The firm’s profit, shown by the 
shaded rectangle, is $330:
profit = (price - average cost) * quantity = ($2.00 - $0.90) * 300 = $330
Given the large profits in the toothbrush market, will a second firm enter the market?
Entry Squeezes Profits from Three Sides
Suppose a second firm, producing a slightly different toothbrush, enters the market. 
When the second firm enters, the firm-specific demand curve for the original firm will 
shift to the left. At any particular price, some consumers will patronize the new firm, 
so there will be fewer consumers for the original firm: The original firm will sell fewer 
brushes at each price. In Panel B of Figure 26.1, the firm-specific demand curve for the 
original monopolist shifts to the left, and profit decreases for three reasons:
1	 The market price drops. The marginal principle is satisfied at point d, so the original 
firm now produces 200 toothbrushes at a price of $1.80 (point e). The competition 
between the two firms causes the price to drop, from $2.00 to $1.80.
2	 The quantity produced by the first firm decreases. The original firm produces only 200 
toothbrushes, down from the 300 it produced as a monopolist.
3	 The first firm’s firm’s average cost of production increases. The decrease in the quantity 
produced causes the firm to move upward along its negatively sloped average-cost 
curve to a higher average cost per toothbrush, from $0.90 to $1.00 (point f  ).

(A) A monopolist maximizes profit at point a, where marginal revenue equals marginal cost. The firm sells 
300 toothbrushes at a price of $2.00 (point b) and an average cost of $0.90 (point c). The profit of $330 
is shown by the shaded rectangle. (B) The entry of a second firm shifts the firm-specific demand curve 
for the original firm to the left. The firm produces only 200 toothbrushes (point d) at a lower price ($1.80, 
shown by point e) and a higher average cost ($1.00, shown by point f). The firm’s profit, shown by the

The effects of entry are shown by comparing the profit rectangles in Panels A 
and B of Figure 26.1. Entry shrinks the firm’s profit rectangle because it is squeezed 
from three directions. The top of the rectangle drops because the price decreases. The 
bottom of the rectangle rises because the average cost increases. The right side of the 
rectangle moves to the left because the quantity decreases. In this example, profit drops 
from $330 to $160:
profit = (price - average cost) * quantity = ($1.80 - 1.00) * 200 = $160
What about the second firm? If we assume the second firm has access to the same 
production technology as the first firm and pays the same prices for its inputs, the cost 
curves for the second firm will be the same as the cost curves for the first firm. If the 
product of the second firm is nearly identical to the product of the first firm, the firm-
specific demand curve for the second firm will be nearly identical to the firm-specific 
demand curve of the first firm. As an approximation, we can use Panel B of Figure 26.1 
to represent both firms. Each firm produces 200 toothbrushes at an average cost of 
$1.00 per toothbrush and sells them at a price of $1.80. 
Examples of Entry: Car Stereos, Trucking, and Tires
To illustrate the effects of entry on price, cost, and profit, imagine that you just inherited 
enough money to start your own car-stereo business. Suppose that the existing monopo-
list sells 10 stereos per day at a price of $230 and an average cost of $200 per stereo, for 
a profit of $30 per stereo. If you enter the market, the increased competition will drop 
the price below $230, and if you sell fewer than 10 stereos (the monopoly quantity), your 
average will be greater than $200 because you will spread your fixed costs over fewer 
units. In other words, your entry squeezes profit per unit from both sides. For example, 
if the market price drops to $215 and the average cost increases to $205, your profit per 
stereo will be $10, significantly less than the monopolist’s initial profit of $30 per stereo.
What happens when the government eliminates artificial barriers to entry? The 
Motor Carrier Act of 1980 eliminated the government’s entry restrictions on the truck-
ing industry, most of which had been in place since the 1930s. New firms entered the 
trucking market, and freight prices dropped by about 22 percent. The market value 
of a firm’s trucking license indicates how much profit the firm can earn in the market. 
Deregulation increased competition and decreased prices and profits, and the average 
value of a trucking license dropped from $579,000 in 1977 to less than $15,000 in 1982.1

improve the quality of service and decrease its price, so con-
sumer surplus increases. In some cases, the cable company 
improves the quality of service and increases price. Because 
the service improvement is typically large relative to the price 
hike, consumer surplus increases in this case too. On aver-
age, the entry of a satellite firm increases the monthly con-
sumer ­surplus per consumer from $3.96 to $5.22, an increase 
of 32 percent.  Related to Exercises 1.6 and 1.8.

Empirical studies of other markets provide ample evidence that entry decreases 
market prices and firms’ profits. In other words, consumers pay less for goods and ser-
vices, and firms earn lower profits. In one study of the retail pricing of tires, a market 
with only two tire stores had a price of $55 per tire, compared to a price of $53 in a 
market with three stores, $51 with four stores, and $50 with five stores. The larger the 
number of stores, the lower the price of tires.2 
Monopolistic Competition
We’ve seen that the entry of a firm in a profitable market decreases the price and 
the profit per firm. Under a market structure called monopolistic competition, firms will 
continue to enter the market until economic profit is zero. Here are the features of 
monopolistic competition:
• Many firms. Because there are relatively small economies of scale, a small firm can 
produce its product at about the same average cost as a large firm. For example, 
a small donut shop can produce donuts and coffee at about the same average 
cost as a large shop. Because even a small firm can cover its costs, the market can 
support many firms.
• A differentiated product. Firms engage in product differentiation, the process 
used by firms to distinguish their products from the products of competing firms. 
A firm can distinguish its products from the products of other firms by offering 
a different performance level or appearance. For example, automobiles differ in 
horsepower and fuel efficiency, and toothpastes differ in flavor and their ability 
to clean teeth. Some products are differentiated by the services that come with 
them. For example, some stores provide informative and helpful salespeople, 
whereas others require consumers to make decisions on their own. Some pizza 
places offer home delivery, and some software producers offer free technical 
assistance. As we see later in the chapter, some products are differentiated by 
where they are sold.
• No artificial barriers to entry. There are no patents or regulations that could pre-
vent firms from entering the market.
These characteristics explain the logic behind the label “monopolistic competi-
tion.” Product differentiation means each firm is the sole seller of a narrowly defined 
good. For example, each firm in the toothbrush market has a unique design for its 
toothbrushes, so each is a monopolist in the narrowly defined market for that design. 
Because the products from different firms are close substitutes, there is keen com-
petition for consumers. When one toothbrush maker increases its price, many of its 
consumers will switch to the similar toothbrushes produced by other firms. In other 
words, the demand for the product of a monopolistically competitive firm is very price 
elastic: An increase in price decreases the quantity demanded by a relatively large 
amount because consumers can easily switch to another firm selling a similar product.
When Entry Stops: Long-Run Equilibrium
We’ll use the toothbrush example to illustrate the features of monopolistic competi-
tion. The producers of toothbrushes differentiate their products with respect to color, 
bristle design, handle size and shape, and durability. As we saw earlier, after a second 
firm enters the toothbrush market, both firms still make a profit. Will a third firm enter 
this lucrative market? The entry of a third firm will shift the firm-specific demand 
curve for each firm further to the left. As we saw earlier, a leftward shift of a firm’s 
demand curve decreases the market price, decreases the quantity produced per firm, 
and increases the average cost per toothbrush. If after the third firm enters the market 
all three firms still earn positive profit, a fourth firm will enter.

Because there are no barriers to entering the toothbrush market, firms will con-
tinue to enter until each firm makes zero economic profit. Figure 26.2 shows the 
long-run equilibrium from the perspective of the typical firm. Suppose a total of six 
firms are in the toothbrush market. Given the firm-specific demand curve in a market 
with six firms, the typical firm satisfies the marginal principle at point a by selling 80 
brushes per minute at a price of $1.40 (point b) and an average cost of $1.40. Because 
the price equals the average cost, the typical firm makes zero economic profit. Each 
firm’s revenue is high enough to cover all its costs—including the opportunity cost of 
all its inputs—but not enough to cause additional firms to enter the market. In other 
words, each firm makes just enough money to stay in business.
▲  Figure 26.2  Long-Run Equilibrium with Monopolistic Competition
Under monopolistic competition, firms continue to enter the market until economic profit is zero. Entry 
shifts the firm-specific demand curve to the left. The typical firm maximizes profit at point a, where mar-
ginal revenue equals marginal cost. At a quantity of 80 toothbrushes, price equals average cost (shown 
by point b), so economic profit is zero.

What are the implications of market entry for the market as a whole? In Figure 26.2, 
each of the six firms in the market produces 80 toothbrushes at a price of $1.40, so  
the total quantity produced is 480. In contrast, we started with a monopoly that had 
a price of $2.00 and a quantity of 300 toothbrushes. In other words, market entry 
decreased the price from $2.00 to $1.40 and increased the total quantity demanded 
from 300 to 480, consistent with the law of demand. 
Differentiation by Location
In some monopolistically competitive markets, differentiation is simply a matter of loca-
tion. Some examples are gas stations, music stores, bookstores, grocery stores, movie 
theaters, and ice cream parlors. In each case, many firms sell the same product at differ-
ent locations. Your city probably has several bookstores, each of which sells a particular 
book at about the same price. Everything else being equal, you are likely to purchase 
books from the most convenient store, but if a store across town offers lower prices, you 
might purchase your books there instead. In other words, each store has a monopoly in 
its own neighborhood, but competes with bookstores in the rest of the city.
Figure 26.3 shows the long-run equilibrium in the market for books. Because 
there are no barriers to entering the market, new bookstores will enter the market until 
each store makes zero economic profit. The typical bookstore satisfies the marginal 

part 9

principle at point a, selling 70 books per hour at a price of $14 per book (point b) and 
an average cost of $14 per book. The price equals the store’s average cost, so the typical 
store makes zero economic profit. Each store’s revenue is high enough to cover all its 
costs—including the opportunity cost of all its inputs—but not enough to cause addi-
tional stores to enter the market. In other words, the store makes just enough money 
to stay in business.

addition, you will pay Accor a royalty of 5 percent of your sales 
revenue. There are training programs available to build your 
hotelier skills.
How much money are you likely to earn in your motel? You 
will compete with nearby motels and hotels for customers, and 
because the barriers to entering the industry are relatively low, the 
competition for customers is likely to be keen. In the monopolisti-
cally competitive motel market, you are likely to make zero eco-
nomic profit, with total revenue equal to total cost. Your total cost 
includes the franchise fees and royalties, as well as the opportu-
nity cost of your time and the opportunity cost of any funds you 
invest in the business.  Related to Exercises 2.4 and 2.5.

Trade-Offs with Entry and Monopolistic Competition
We’ve seen that market entry leads to lower prices and a larger total quantity in the 
market. At the same time, entry decreases the output per firm and increases the average 
cost of production. As shown in Figures 26.2 and 26.3, monopolistically competitive 
firms operate on the negatively sloped portion of their average-cost curves, so aver-
age cost is higher than the minimum. In other words, the average cost of production 
would be lower if a single toothbrush firm served the entire market by providing a 
single type of toothbrush. What are the other consequences of entry and monopolistic 
competition?
Average Cost and Variety
There are some trade-offs associated with monopolistic competition. Although the 
average cost of production is higher than the minimum, there is also more prod-
uct ­variety. In a market with many toothbrush firms, consumers can choose from a 
wide variety of designs, so the higher average cost is at least partly offset by greater 
product variety. Here are two other examples of the benefits of product variety:
• Restaurant meals. The typical large city has dozens of Italian restaurants, each 
of which has a different menu and prepares its food in different ways. Consum-
ers can pick from restaurants offering a wide variety of menus and preparation 
techniques. Although a city with a single Italian restaurant would have a lower 
average cost of preparing Italian meals, consumers would get less variety.
• Shoes and clothing. Shoes are differentiated according to their style and perfor-
mance. If we all wore the same type of shoes, the average cost of producing shoes 
would be lower, but consumers would be unable to match their shoe preferences 
with suitable shoes. Similarly, if we all wore uniforms, the average cost of cloth-
ing would be lower, but that would eliminate clothing choice.
What are the trade-offs when products are differentiated by location? When firms 
sell the same product at different locations, the larger the number of firms, the higher 
the average cost of production. But when firms are numerous, consumers travel shorter 
distances to get the product. Therefore, higher production costs are at least partly offset 
by lower travel costs. If a large metropolitan area had only one bookstore, the average 
cost of books would be lower, but consumers would spend more time traveling to get 
the books. 
Monopolistic Competition versus Perfect Competition
Product differentiation is what makes monopolistic competition different from 
perfect competition. Perfectly competitive firms produce homogeneous products, 
while monopolistically competitive firms produce differentiated products. Panel A 
of Figure 26.4 shows the equilibrium for a perfectly competitive firm. Each price-
taking firm has a horizontal demand curve. Point a shows the long-run equilibrium 
because the typical firm (1) satisfies the marginal principle, choosing the quantity 
where marginal revenue equals marginal cost, and (2) earns zero economic profit 
because price equals average cost:
price = marginal cost = average cost
The only place where price equals both marginal cost and average cost is the minimum 
point of the average-cost curve, shown by point a.
Panel B shows the equilibrium for a monopolistically competitive firm. The firm 
has a differentiated product, so its demand curve is negatively sloped and marginal 
revenue is less than the price. With a negatively sloped demand curve, the zero-profit 
condition—price equals average cost—will be satisfied along the negatively sloped 
portion of the average-cost curve. In other words, the only place where a tangency can

hour or two. According to the model of perfect competition, an 
increase in demand will lead to higher, not lower prices. What 
explains the happy-hour combination of higher demand and 
lower prices?
Bars are subject to monopolistic competition. Each bar has 
a local monopoly within its neighborhood, but faces competi-
tion from other bars outside its neighborhood. For an individual 
consumer, the higher the demand for food and drink, the greater 
the incentive to consider alternatives to the nearest bar. If you 
expect to purchase large quantities of bar food and drink, the 
savings achieved by finding a lower price at an alternative bar 
will be relatively large. In other words, when individual demand 
increases, each bar faces a more elastic demand for its prod-
ucts. In a market subject to monopolistic competition, the bar’s 
rational response to more elastic demand (more sensitive con-
sumers) is to decrease its price. In graphical terms, the demand 
curve facing each bar becomes flatter, and the demand curve 
will be tangent to the average-cost curve at a larger quantity 
and a lower price and average cost.  Related to Exercise 3.6.

Demand Can Produce a Decrease in Price,” Economic Review, Federal Reserve 
Bank of Atlanta (Second Quarter 2005), pp. 25–34.
Consider the phenomenon of “happy hour.” Many bars and res-
taurants near workplaces face an increase in demand for food 
and drink around 5:00 p.m., and many cut their prices for an

occur is along the negatively sloped portion of the average-cost curve. Compared to a 
perfectly competitive firm, a monopolistically competitive firm produces less output at 
a higher average cost. In Figure 26.4, the average cost for the monopolistically competi-
tive firm is P2, compared to P1 for a perfectly competitive firm.
To illustrate the difference between the two market structures, imagine that 
product differentiation diminishes. Suppose, for example, that consumers decide that 
the distinguishing features of toothbrushes—color, shape, and bristle design—don’t 
matter. As a result, the products of competing firms will become better substitutes, 
so the demand for a particular firm’s product will become more elastic. In Panel B of 
­Figure 26.4 the firm-specific demand curve will become flatter and will be tangent to 
the average-cost curve at a larger quantity, closer to the perfectly competitive quan-
tity Q1. As differentiation continues to diminish, the firm’s demand curve will become 
flatter and flatter, and we will get closer and closer to the perfectly competitive out-
come, where the average cost reaches its minimum. 
Advertising for Product Differentiation
We’ve seen that product differentiation is a key feature of monopolistic competition. A 
firm can use advertising to inform consumers about the features of its product and thus 
distinguish its product from the products of other firms. In addition, advertisements 
can inform consumers about prices. A famous study of the eyeglass market found that 
advertising promoted price competition between firms and reduced eyeglass prices by 
about 20 percent.3

loan offers. The interest rates in the offer letters ranged from 
3.75% to 11.75% per month. As expected, the uptake rate 
(the number of consumers who accepted a particular loan 
offer) was higher for offer letters with low interest rates. The 
elasticity of the uptake rate with respect to the interest rate 
was -0.34: a 10% decrease in the interest rate (from, say, 
an interest rate of 7.0% to 6.3%) increased the uptake rate 
by 3.4%.
More surprising was the finding that the uptake rate 
among men was much higher when the offer letter included a 
picture of a woman rather than a picture of a man. Replacing a 
male model with a female model was equivalent to cutting the 
interest rate by 25 percent, for example, from 7.0 percent to 
5.25 percent. In contrast, the uptake rate for women consum-
ers was unaffected by the gender of the model.  Related to 
Exercises 4.4 and 4.5.

Some advertisements don’t provide any real information about a product or 
its price. You’ve seen the advertisements featuring beer drinkers frolicking on the 
beach with attractive people, cigarette smokers riding horseback, drivers of sports 
cars impressing classmates at high school reunions, and sports-drink consumers 
performing amazing athletic feats. These sorts of advertisements are designed to 
promote an image for a product, not to provide information about the product’s 
features.
An advertisement that doesn’t provide any product information may actually help 
consumers make decisions. Firms spend millions of dollars to get celebrities like Mat-
thew McConaughey and Sofia Vergara to endorse their products. When a famous 
athlete or actor appears in an advertisement for a product, everyone realizes the celeb-
rity is doing the advertisement for money, not to share his or her enthusiasm for the 
advertised product. Nonetheless, these advertisements are effective in increasing sales. 
Why do they work?
By paying millions of dollars to run an advertisement featuring a celebrity, a 
firm sends a signal to consumers that the advertised product is appealing and likely 
to be popular. To illustrate this signaling effect, consider a firm that develops a new 
energy bar and picks a celebrity to endorse it. The purpose of a celebrity advertise-
ment is to get people to try the product for the first time. After that, a consumer 
will base any repeat purchases on the taste and nutritional value of the energy bar. 
Suppose an advertisement with a cost of $10 million would cause 10 million consum-
ers to try the energy bar. As shown in the first row of Table 26.1, energy bar A is an 
appealing product, and half the consumers who try it will become repeat consumers. 
If the firm makes a profit of $4 on each repeat customer, the firm’s profit of $20 
million exceeds the $10 million cost of the advertisement, so the firm will run the 
advertisement.
What about a product that is less appealing? The second row of Table 26.1 
shows the effects of an advertisement for energy bar B. Only 1 in 10 people who try 
energy bar B will become a repeat customer, so the firm’s profit from an advertise-
ment is only $4 million. That is not enough to cover the $10 million cost, so the 
firm won’t advertise the less-appealing product. Notice that celebrity endorsements 
for the two products are equally effective in getting people to try the products, but 
what matters is repeat customers. The less-appealing product gets fewer repeat 
customers because it’s an inferior product, and that’s why it’s not worthwhile to 
pay for an advertisement.
Celebrity endorsements and other expensive advertising send a signal to consumers 
that the producer expects many repeat customers. Firms undertake extensive marketing 
research to project the sales of their products and, when their research suggests the 
product will be popular, they have an incentive to spend money on advertising to send 
the signal to consumers. The signal tells consumers which new products are expected 
to have the greatest general appeal.

This chapter is about market 
entry and monopolistic com-
petition. In a monopolistically 
competitive market, entry 
continues until each firm in the 
market makes zero economic 
profit. Firms can differentiate 
their products by design, level 
of service, location, or product image. Here are the main points of 
the chapter:
1.	 The entry of a firm into a market decreases the market price, 
decreases output per firm, and increases the average cost of 
production.
2.	 In a monopolistically competitive market, firms compete for cus-
tomers by producing differentiated products.
3.	 In the long-run equilibrium with monopolistic competition, mar-
ginal revenue equals marginal cost, price equals average cost, 
and economic profit is zero.
4.	 Under monopolistic competition, the average cost of produc-
tion is higher than the minimum, but there is also more product 
variety.
5.	 A firm can use celebrity endorsements and other costly adver-
tisements to signal its belief that a product will be appealing.

bookstore licenses to the highest bidders. Suppose 
the relevant variables (price, average cost, and output 
per firm) take on only integer values—no fractions or 
decimals.
a.	 Suppose Paige is optimistic and imagines the best 
possible outcome with a two-firm market. What is 
the maximum amount she is willing to pay for one 
of the two licenses?
b.	Suppose Paige is pessimistic and imagines the worst 
possible outcome with a two-firm market. What is 
the maximum amount she is willing to pay for one 
of the two licenses?

1.9	 Beware the Too-Easy Answer. Your city initially 
restricts the number of pizzerias to one. The exist-
ing monopolist sells 3,000 pizzas per day. A pizzeria 
reaches the horizontal portion of its long-run average 
cost curve at an output of about 1,000 pizzas per day. 
Suppose the city eliminates the entry restrictions. Pre-
dict the equilibrium number of pizzerias. Beware of the 
TEC (too easy to be correct) answer.
1.10	 Equilibrium? In your city, there are currently three 
firms providing oil changes. For each firm, there is a 
fixed cost of $80 per day and a marginal cost of $12 per 
oil change. Each firm currently maximizes its profit by 
providing 10 oil changes per day.
a.	 For each firm, marginal revenue = $
.
b.	This is a monopolistically competitive equilibrium 
if 
 equals $
.
Monopolistic Competition
List the conditions for equilibrium in monopolistic competition.
2.1	 Monopolistic competition refers to a market in which old 
boys act naturally as they transport tight slacks in the back 
of Dodge Ram pickup trucks. 
 (True/False)
2.2	 Perfectly competitive firms sell a 
 prod-
uct, while monopolistically competitive firms sell a 
 product.
2.3	 There are two conditions for a long-run equilibrium in 
a monopolistically competitive market:
1.	
 equals 
 and
2.	
 equals

2.4	 To enter the motel market by opening a Motel 6, you’ll 
pay a one-time franchise fee of $
 and then 
pay 
 percent of your sales. (Related to Appli-
cation 2 on page 590.)
2.5	 How Many Bookstores? The city of Bookburg ini-
tially allows only one bookstore, which sells books at 
a price of $20 and an average cost of $11. Suppose the 
city eliminates its restrictions on bookstores, allowing 
additional stores to enter the market. According to an 
expert in the book market, “Each additional bookstore 
will decrease the price of books by $2 per book and 
increase the average cost of selling books by $1 per 
book.” Predict the equilibrium number of bookstores.
2.6	 Ice-Cream Bar Equilibrium. Assume that you are run-
ning a small ice cream bar, selling luxury home-made 
ice cream. The market for ice-cream is characterized by 
monopolistic competition, and your short-run demand 
function is given by P = 200 - 2Q. Your total cost func-
tion is given by TC = 300 + 20Q + Q2, and your mar-
ginal cost function is given by MC = 20 + 2Q.
a.	 What will be your ice-cream bar’s profit-­maximizing 
levels of price (P) and quantity (Q)?
b.	Calculate your total profit.
c.	 If your fixed cost doubles, will you still make a 
profit?
2.7	 Zero Price for a Permit. Consider a city that initially 
issues five licenses to pet groomers and does not allow 
the licenses to be bought and sold. Shortly after an 
economist joins the city licensing authority, the city 
decides to allow the licenses to be bought and sold on 
the open market. Much to the surprise of the licensers, 
the price of the licenses was zero: No one was willing 
to pay a positive amount for a pet-grooming license.
a.	 Explain why the price of grooming licenses was zero.
b.	Illustrate your answer with a complete graph.
2.8	 Auctioning Business Licenses. The following table 
shows the relationships between the number of firms 
in the market, the market price, the quantity per firm, 
and the average cost of production.

A business license allows a firm to operate the business 
for one day. The city will auction up to seven business 
licenses to the highest bidders, and the auctioning of 
licenses will continue as long as someone bids a posi-
tive amount for one of the licenses. Assume that each 
firm can buy only one license. What is the maximum 
amount you would be willing to pay for a license?
Trade-Offs with Entry and Monopolistic Competition
Contrast monopolistic competition and perfect competition.
3.1	 The trade-off with entry is that an increase in the 
number of firms leads to higher 
 but greater 
.
3.2	 When products are differentiated by location, the entry 
of firms generates benefits for consumers in the form 
of

3.3	 A perfectly competitive firm has a 
 demand 
curve, whereas a monopolistic competitive firm has a 
 demand curve.
3.4	 In the long-run equilibrium in a perfectly competi-
tive market, price is equal to both

3.6	 The phenomenon of “happy hour” pricing (
 
prices when demand is relatively high) results from rel-
atively 
 (elastic/inelastic) demand. (Related 
to Application 3 on page 592.)
3.7	 Uniform Trade-Offs. A prominent feature of Mao’s 
Communist China in the 1940s through the 1970s was 
the blue uniform worn by all citizens.
a.	 Explain the trade-offs associated with the use of 
uniforms. What were the benefits? What were the 
costs?
b.	Suppose people had a choice among five uniform 
colors rather than being required to wear blue. 
Would you expect the benefits of requiring uni-
forms to decrease by a little or a lot?
Advertising for Product Differentiation
Explain the role of advertising in monopolistic competition.
4.1	 Advertising for eyeglasses 
 (increases/
decreases) the price of eyeglasses because advertising 
promotes 
.
4.2	 An advertisement that succeeds in getting consumers 
to try the product will be sensible only if the number 
of 
 customers is large.
4.3	 In Table 26.1 on page 594, the profit from repeat cus-
tomers will equal the cost of the advertisement if there 
are 
 repeat customers.
4.4	 Arrows up or down. In the application on consumer 
loans in South Africa, the loan uptake rate 
 
as the interest rate decreased and 
 when 
the model on the offer was switched from a man to a 
woman. (Related to Application 4 on page 593.)
4.5	 Advertising for Loans. Consider the numbers pro-
vided in Application 4 on South African consumer 
loans. Suppose a lender initially charges an interest 
rate of 10 percent and uses male models in its adver-
tisements. The firm wants to increase its uptake rate 
among male consumers. Suppose the firm switches to 
female models in its advertisements. The male uptake 
rate will increase by 
 (1, 3, 8, 25) percent. 
(Related to Application 4 on page 593.)
4.6	 The Cost of Celebrities. Consider a firm that hires an 
expensive celebrity to advertise its products. Does the 
firm have an incentive to prevent its customers from 
discovering how much it pays the celebrity?
4.7	 Word-of-Mouth Book Sales. Consider a publisher 
who earns a profit of $2 per book sold. An advertise-
ment that costs $320,000 would sell 100,000 books 
directly. To make the advertisement worthwhile, how 
many of the original buyers must each persuade just 
one other person to buy the book?

Fixed Costs and Entry
Here is an experiment that shows the implications of entry 
for prices and profits. Students play the role of entrepre-
neurs who must decide whether to enter the market for lawn 
cutting. If they decide to enter the market, they must then 
decide how much to charge for cutting lawns.
• There are eight potential lawn-cutting firms, each repre-
sented by one to three students. The firms have two sorts 
of costs: a fixed cost per day and a marginal cost of cutting 
each lawn. Each firm can cut up to two lawns per day.
• There are 16 potential consumers. Each potential con-
sumer is willing to pay a different amount to have his or 
her lawn cut.
• The experiment has two stages. In the first stage, each 
potential firm decides whether to enter the market. The 
entry decision is sequential: The instructor will go down 
the list of potential firms, one at a time, and give each 
firm the option of entering the market. The entry deci-
sions are public knowledge. When a firm enters the mar-
ket, it incurs a fixed cost of $14.
Economic Experiment
• Each firm in the market posts a price for lawn cutting, 
and consumers shop around and decide whether to pur-
chase lawn care at the posted prices.
• Each trading period lasts several minutes, and each firm 
can change its posted price up to three times each period.
• A consumer’s score in a trading period equals the differ-
ence between the amount that the consumer is willing to 
pay for lawn care and the price actually paid.
• A firm’s score equals its profit, which is its total rev-
enue minus its total cost (the fixed cost of $14 plus the 
variable cost, equal to $3 per lawn times the number of 
lawns cut).

MyLab Economics

In an oligopoly, defined as a 
­market with just a few firms, 
each firm has an incentive to act 
­strategically, anticipating the 
possible actions and reactions 
of its fellow oligopolists.
In Brazil, a few firms dominate the market for cement, 
and the domestic cement producers are strategic oli-
gopolists, with a twist.1
Although imported cement is just a tiny part of the 
market, it appears that importers are always poised 
to enter the market, and this constant threat of entry 
keeps prices lower than we would expect in an oligopoly. In a sense, the Brazilian cement firms are insecure oli-
gopolists, keeping prices high enough to get a profit, but low enough to prevent importers from entering the market.
The prices of Brazilian firms depend on the degree of competition from importers. When imports become less 
costly and thus more competitive, the domestic firms cut their prices to protect their oligopoly power. On the other 
hand, when imports become more costly and thus less competitive, the domestic firms increase their prices and 
thus exploit their oligopoly power. For example, when an increase in the price of diesel fuel increases shipping costs 
and makes imports less competitive, domestic firms increase their prices. Domestic firms also charge relatively high 
prices in the interior area of Brazil, where the costs of importers are relatively high.

his is the fourth chapter on decision making by firms. In this chapter, we look 
at an oligopoly, a market with just a few firms. Given the small number of firms 
in an oligopoly, the actions of one firm have a large effect on the other firms. 
Therefore, firms in an oligopoly act strategically. Before a firm takes a particular action, 
it considers the possible reactions of its rivals. For example, before Southwest Airlines 
cuts its fares in an attempt to sell more tickets, it will consider the possible reactions by 
other airlines. If the rivals maintain their old fares, Southwest’s fare cut will increase its 
sales and profit. But if the rivals match the lower fare, Southwest is likely to gain only 
a few customers, and its profit may actually decrease.
Game theory is the study of decision making in strategic situations. We can apply 
the theory to the game of chess as well as the decisions of oligopolists. A chess player 
develops a strategy to win the game, anticipating his or her opponent’s reaction to each 
of his or her moves. Similarly, an oligopolist develops a strategy to maximize profit, 
anticipating the reactions of rival firms. We use game theory to discuss three business 
strategies: conspiring to fix prices, preventing another firm from entering the market, 
and advertising.
In an oligopoly, a few firms have market power—the power to control prices. 
Economists use concentration ratios to measure the degree of concentration in a 
market, computed as the percentage of the market output produced by the largest firms. 
For example, a four-firm concentration ratio is the percentage of total output in a 
market produced by the four largest firms. In Table 27.1, the four-firm concentration 
ratio for house slippers is 97 percent, indicating that the largest four firms produce 
97 percent of house slippers in the United States.

Table 27.1   Concentration Ratios in Selected Manufacturing Industries
An alternative measure of market concentration is the Herfindahl—Hirschman Index 
(HHI). It is calculated by squaring the market share of each firm in the market and 
then summing the resulting numbers. For example, consider a market with two firms, 
one with a 60 percent market share and a second with a 40 percent share. The HHI 
for the market is 5,200:
HHI = 602 + 402 = 3,600 + 1,600 = 5,200

Chapter 27 • Oligopoly and Strategic Behavior
601
In contrast, for a market with 10 firms, each with a 10 percent market share, the HHI 
is 1,000:
HHI = 102 * 10 = 100 * 10 = 1,000
According to the guidelines established by the U.S. Department of Justice in 1992, a 
market is “unconcentrated” if the HHI is below 1,000 and “highly concentrated” if it 
is above 1,800. For example, a market with five firms, each with a 20 percent market 
share, has an HHI of 2,000 and would be considered highly concentrated:
HHI = 202 * 5 = 400 * 5 = 2,000
An oligopoly—a market with just a few firms—occurs for three reasons:
1	 Government barriers to entry. As we saw in Chapter 21 and 25, the government may 
limit the number of firms in a market by issuing patents or controlling the number 
of business licenses.
2	 Economies of scale in production. As we saw in Chapter 25, a natural monopoly occurs 
when there are relatively large economies of scale in production, so a single firm 
produces for the entire market. In some cases, scale economies are not large 
enough to generate a natural monopoly, but are large enough to generate a natu-
ral oligopoly, with a few firms serving the entire market.
3	 Advertising campaigns. In some markets, a firm cannot enter a market without a 
substantial investment in an advertising campaign. For example, the breakfast-
cereal oligopoly results from the huge advertising campaigns required to get 
a foothold in the market. As in the case of economies of scale in production, just 
a few firms will enter the market.
Cartel Pricing and the Duopolists’ Dilemma
One of the virtues of a market economy is that firms compete with one another for 
customers, and this leads to lower prices and larger quantities. But in some markets, 
firms cooperate instead of competing with one another. Eighteenth-century econo-
mist Adam Smith recognized the possibility that firms would conspire to raise prices: 
“People of the same trade seldom meet together, even for merriment and diversion, 
but the conversation ends in a conspiracy against the public, or in some contrivance 
to raise prices”2. We’ll see that raising prices is not simply a matter of firms getting 
together and agreeing on higher prices. An agreement to raise prices is likely to break 
down unless the firms find some way to punish a firm that violates the agreement.
We’ll use a market with two firms—a duopoly—to explain the key features of an 
oligopoly. The basic insights from a duopoly apply to oligopolies with more than two 
firms. Consider a duopoly in the market for air travel between two hypothetical cities. 
The two airlines can use prices to compete for customers, or they can cooperate and 
conspire to raise prices. To simplify matters—and to keep the numbers manageable—
let’s assume that the average cost of providing air travel is constant at $100 per pas-
senger. As shown in Figure 27.1, the average cost is constant, which means that 
marginal cost equals average cost.
A cartel is a group of firms that act in unison, coordinating their price and quantity 
decisions. In our airline example, the two airlines could form a cartel and choose the 
monopoly price. In Figure 27.1, the firm-specific demand curve for a monopolist is 
the market-demand curve, and the marginal-revenue curve intersects the marginal-cost 
curve at a quantity of 60 passengers per day (point a). If the two airlines act as one, they 
will pick the monopoly price of $400 and split the monopoly output, so each will have 
30 passengers per day. The average cost per passenger is $100, so each airline earns a 
daily profit of $9,000:
profit = (price - average cost) * quantity per film =($400 - $100) * 30 = $9,000

This is an example of price fixing, an arrangement in which firms conspire to fix 
prices. As we’ll see later in the chapter, cartels and price fixing are illegal under U.S. 
antitrust laws.
What would happen if the two firms competed rather than conspired to fix the 
price? If they competed, each firm would have its own demand curve. As we saw in the 
previous chapter, the firm-specific demand curve for the typical firm lies to the left of 
the market demand curve because consumers can choose from two firms. At a particular 
price, consumers will be divided between the two firms, so each firm will serve only part 
of the market. In Figure 27.2, the demand curve for the typical duopolist is below the 
market demand curve. For example, at a price of $300, point d shows that the market 
quantity is 80 passengers, while point b shows that each firm has 40 passengers.
Panel A in Figure 27.2 shows the quantity and price choice of an individual firm. 
Given the firm-specific demand curve and marginal-revenue curve, the marginal principle 
is satisfied at point a, where marginal revenue equals marginal cost. The firm has 40 pas-
sengers at a price of $300 (point b). The two firms are identical, so each has 40 passengers 
at a price of $300. Given an average cost of $100, each firm earns a profit of $8,000:
profit = (price - average cost)* quantity per firm =($300 - $100) *40 = $8,000
Price Fixing and the Game Tree
Clearly, each firm will earn more profit under a price-fixing cartel, but will a cartel suc-
ceed, or will firms cheat on a cartel agreement? We can answer this question with the 
help of a game tree, a graphical representation of the consequences of different actions 
in a strategic setting. Each firm must choose a price for airline tickets, either the high 
price (the $400 cartel price) or the low price (the duopoly price of $300). Each firm can 
use the game tree to pick a price, knowing that the other firm is picking a price too.

▲  Figure 27.1  A Cartel Picks the Monopoly Quantity and Price
The monopoly outcome is shown by point a, where marginal revenue equals marginal cost. The monop-
oly quantity is 60 passengers and the price is $400. If the firms form a cartel, the price is $400 and each 
firm has 30 passengers (half the monopoly quantity). The profit per passenger is $300 (equal to the $400 
price minus the $100 average cost), so the profit per firm is $9,000.

Figure 27.3 shows the game tree for the price-fixing game. Let’s call the managers 
of the airlines Jack and Jill. The game tree has three components:
• The squares are decision nodes. Each square has a player (Jack or Jill) and a list 
of the player’s possible actions. For example, the game starts at square A, where 
Jill has two options: high price or low price.

The equilibrium path of the game is square A to square C to rectangle 4: Each firm picks the low price

picked the high price, but both firms pick the low price.

In the second column, Jack charges the low price and has 60 passengers at a price of 
$300, so his profit is $12,000:
profit = (price - average cost) * quantity per firm =($300 - $100) * 60 = $12,000
This is shown by rectangle 2 in Figure 27.3: The path of the game is square A to 
square B to rectangle 2. The other underpricing outcome is shown by rectangle 3. 
In this case, Jill chooses the low price and Jack chooses the high price, so Jill gains 
at Jack’s expense. The roles are reversed, and so are the numbers in the profit 
rectangle. 
Equilibrium of the Price-Fixing Game
We can predict the equilibrium of the price-fixing game by a process of elimination. 
We’ll eliminate the rectangles that would require one or both firms to act irrationally, 
leaving us with the rectangle showing the equilibrium of the game:
• If Jill chooses the high price, we’ll move along the upper branches of the tree 
and eventually reach rectangle 1 or 2, depending on what Jack does. Although 
Jill would like Jack to choose the high price too, this would be irrational for Jack. 
He can earn $12,000 profit by choosing the low price, compared to $9,000 with 
the high price. Therefore, we can eliminate rectangle 1.
• The arrows show the possible paths of the game from left to right. Jill chooses 
her price first, so we move from square A to one of Jack’s decision nodes, either 
square B or square C. If Jill chooses the high price, we move from square A to 
square B. Once we reach one of Jack’s decision nodes, he chooses a price—high 
or low—and then we move to one of the rectangles. For example, if Jack chooses 
the high price too, we move from square B to rectangle 1.
• The rectangles show the profits for the two firms. When we reach a rectangle, 
the game is over, and the players receive the profits shown in the rectangle. 
There is a profit rectangle for each of the four possible outcomes of the price-
fixing game.
We’ve already computed the profits for two payoff rectangles. Rectangle 1 shows 
what happens when each firm chooses the high price. This is the cartel or price-fixing 
outcome, with each firm earning $9,000. Rectangle 4 shows what happens when each 
firm chooses the low price. This is the duopoly outcome, when firms compete and each 
firm earns a profit of $8,000.
What would happen if the two firms chose different prices? If Jill chooses the high 
price and Jack chooses the low price, Jack will capture a large share of the market and 
gain at Jill’s expense. In the first column of Table 27.2, Jill charges the high price and 
has only 10 passengers at a price of $400, so her profit is $3,000:
profit = (price - average cost) * quantity per firm = ($400 - $100) * 10 = $3,000

• If Jill chooses the low price, we’ll move along the lower branches of the tree and 
eventually reach rectangle 3 or 4, depending on Jack’s choice. Jack won’t choose 
the high price because he can earn $8,000 with the low price, compared to $3,000 
with the high price. Therefore, we can eliminate rectangle 3.
We’ve eliminated the two profit rectangles that represent a high price for Jack—­
rectangles 1 and 3. For Jack, the low price is a dominant strategy: Regardless of what 
Jill does, Jack’s best choice is the low price.
Two profit rectangles are left—2 and 4—and Jill’s action will determine which 
rectangle is the equilibrium. Jill knows Jack will choose the low price regardless of 
what she does. She could choose the high price and allow Jack to capture most of 
the market, leaving her with a profit of only $3,000 in rectangle 2. A better choice 
is to pick the low price and get a profit of $8,000 in rectangle 4. In other words, it 
would be irrational for Jill to allow herself to be underpriced, so the outcome of 
the game is shown by profit rectangle 4: Each player chooses the low price. The 
thick arrows show the equilibrium path of the game, from square A to square C to 
rectangle 4.
Both firms will be unhappy with this equilibrium because each could earn a higher 
profit with rectangle 1. To get there, however, each firm must choose the high price. The 
duopolists’ dilemma is that although both firms would be better off if they both chose 
the high price, each firm chooses the low price. The dilemma occurs because there is a 
big payoff from underpricing the other firm and a big penalty from being underpriced, 
so both firms pick the low price. As we’ll see later in the chapter, to avoid the dilemma, 
the firms must find some way to prevent underpricing. 
Nash Equilibrium
We have used a game tree to find the equilibrium in a price-fixing game. It is an equi-
librium in the sense that each player (firm) is doing the best he or she can, given the 
actions of another player. The label for such an equilibrium is Nash equilibrium. This 
concept is named after John Nash, the recipient of the 1994 Nobel Prize in economics, 
who developed his equilibrium concept as a 21-year-old graduate student at Princeton 
University. Nash’s life story, which includes a 25-year bout with schizophrenia and a 
dramatic recovery, is chronicled in the book A Beautiful Mind, later made into a movie 
starring Russell Crowe as Nash.3
In the Nash equilibrium for the price-fixing game, both firms pick the low price. 
Each firm is doing the best it can, given the action of the other firm:
• If Jill picks the low price, Jack’s best action is to pick the low price.
• If Jack picks the low price, Jill’s best action is to pick the low price.
What about the other potential outcomes? Consider first the possibility that both 
firms pick the high price. This is not a Nash equilibrium because neither firm is doing 
the best it can, given the action of the other firm:
• If Jill picks the high price, Jack’s best action is to pick the low price.
• If Jack picks the high price, Jill’s best action is to pick the low price.
Consider next the possibility that Jill picks the low price and Jack picks the high price. 
This is not a Nash equilibrium because Jack is not doing the best he can, given Jill’s 
choice:
• If Jill picks the low price, Jack’s best action is to pick the low price.
The concept of the Nash equilibrium has been applied to a wide variety of deci-
sions. Analysts have used it to study the nuclear arms race, terrorism, evolution-
ary biology, art auctions, environmental policy, and urban development. Later in 
the chapter, we use it to predict the outcomes of games of entry deterrence and 
advertising.

Overcoming the Duopolists’ Dilemma
The duopolists’ dilemma occurs because the two firms are unable to coordinate their 
pricing decisions and act as one. Each firm has an incentive to underprice the other 
because the low-price firm will capture a larger share of the market and earn a larger 
profit. Firms can avoid the dilemma in two ways: low-price guarantees and repetition 
of the pricing game, with retaliation for underpricing.
Low-Price Guarantees
The duopolists’ dilemma occurs because the payoff from underpricing the other firm 
is too lucrative to miss. To eliminate the possibility of underpricing, one firm can 
guarantee it will match a lower price of a competitor. Suppose Jill places the following 
advertisement in the local newspaper:
If you buy an airline ticket from me and then discover that Jack offers the same trip at a 
lower price, I will pay you the price difference. If I charge you $400 and Jack’s price is 
only $300, I will pay you $100.
Jill’s low-price guarantee is a credible promise because she announces it in the 
newspaper.
Suppose Jack makes a similar commitment to match a lower price from Jill. 
Figure 27.4 shows the effect of low-price guarantees on the game tree. Jill now 
has two decision nodes. As before, she starts the game in square A. If Jill picks the 
high price and then Jack picks the high price, we end up at rectangle 1, as before. 
But if Jill picks the high price and Jack picks the low price, we get to square D. Jill 
will issue a refund of $100 to each of her consumers. In effect, she has retroactively 
chosen the low price, and payoff rectangle 2 is the duopoly outcome, with both 
firms picking the low price. For the lower half of the game tree, recall that Jack 
has committed to match a lower price by Jill, so the old payoff rectangle 3 disap-
pears, leaving us with rectangle 4, where both firms choose the low price and get 
the duopoly profit.

Failure of the Salt Cartel

decreased prices. In response to the increased competition, 
salt producers colluded by forming salt pools, enterprises that 
set a uniform price and distributed the salt of all participat-
ing producers. Some pools established output quotas or paid 
firms not to produce salt for a year, a practice known as “dead-
renting” a salt furnace. Every salt pool eventually broke down, 
usually within a year or two of its formation. In some cases, 
individual firms cheated on the cartel by selling salt outside 
the cartel. In other cases the artificially high price caused new 
firms to enter the market and underprice the salt pool.  Related 
to Exercises 1.9.

The thick arrows show the path of the game with low-price guarantees. Consider 
Jack’s decision first:
• If Jill picks the high price, Jack chooses between payoff rectangles 1 and 2, a pair 
of high prices or a pair of low prices. His profit is higher at $9,000 with a pair of 
high prices (rectangle 1), so if Jill picks the high price, he will too.
• If Jill picks the low price, Jack is committed to the low price too.
Consider Jill’s decision. She knows Jack will match her price—either high or low—
meaning she chooses between profit rectangles 1 and 4. Profit is higher with rect-
angle 1, so she will pick the high price.
The low-price guarantee eliminates the possibility of underpricing, so it eliminates 
the duopolists’ dilemma and promotes cartel pricing. The firms don’t have to create 
a formal cartel to get the benefits from cartel pricing. The motto of a low-price guar-
antee is “Low for one means low for all,” so both firms charge the high price. Once 
the possibility of underpricing has been eliminated, the duopoly will be replaced by an 
informal cartel, with each firm picking the price that a monopolist would pick.
To most people, the notion that a low-price guarantee leads to higher prices is 
surprising. After all, if Jill promises to give refunds if her price exceeds Jack’s price, we 
might expect Jill to keep her price low to avoid handing out a lot of refunds. In fact, Jill 
doesn’t have to worry about giving refunds because Jack will also choose the high price. 
In other words, the promise to issue refunds is an empty promise. Although consumers 
might think that a low-price guarantee will protect them from high prices, it means 
they are more likely to pay the high price. 
Repeated Pricing Games with Retaliation for Underpricing
Up to this point, we’ve assumed the price-fixing game is played only once. Each firm 
chooses a price and keeps it for the lifetime of the firm. What happens when two firms 
play the game repeatedly, picking prices over an extended period of time? We’ll see that 
▲  Figure 27.4  Low-Price Guarantees Increase Prices
When both firms have a low-price guarantee, it is impossible for one firm to underprice the other. The 
only possible outcomes are a pair of high prices (rectangle 1) or a pair of low prices (rectangles 2 or 4). 
The equilibrium path of the game is square A to square B to rectangle 1. Each firm picks the high price 
and earns a profit of $9,000.

These three pricing schemes promote cartel pricing by penalizing the firm that 
underprices the other firm. To decide whether to underprice Jill, Jack must weigh the 
short-term benefit against the long-term cost:
• The short-term benefit is the increase in profit in the current period. If Jack 
underprices Jill, he can increase his profit from the cartel profit of $9,000 to the 
$12,000 earned by a firm that underprices the other firm. Therefore, the short-
term benefit of underpricing is $3,000.
repetition makes price fixing more likely because firms can punish a firm that cheats 
on a price-fixing agreement, whether it’s formal or informal.
1	 A duopoly pricing strategy. Jill chooses the lower duopoly price for the remaining 
lifetime of her firm. Once Jill is underpriced, she abandons the idea of cartel 
pricing and accepts the duopoly outcome, which is less profitable than the cartel 
outcome but more profitable than being underpriced by the other firm.
2	 A grim-trigger strategy. When Jack underprices Jill, she responds by dropping her 
price to a level at which each firm will make zero economic profit. This is called 
the grim-trigger strategy because grim consequences are triggered by Jack’s 
underpricing.
3	 A tit-for-tat strategy. Starting in the second month, Jill chooses whatever price Jack 
chose the preceding month. This is the tit-for-tat strategy—one firm chooses 
whatever price the other firm chose in the preceding period. As long as Jack 
chooses the cartel price, the cartel arrangement will persist. But if Jack underprices 
Jill, the cartel will break down.
Figure 27.5 shows how a tit-for-tat system works. Jack underprices Jill in the sec-
ond month, so Jill chooses the low price for the third month, resulting in the duopoly 
outcome. To restore the cartel outcome, Jack must eventually choose the high price, 
allowing Jill to underprice him for one month. This happens in the fourth month, and 
the cartel is restored in the fifth month. Although Jack can gain at Jill’s expense in the 
second month, if he wants to restore cartel pricing, he must allow her to gain at his 
expense during some other month. Under a tit-for-tat strategy, a duopolist does exactly 
what his or her rival did the last round. This encourages firms to cooperate rather than 
compete. Several studies have shown that a tit-for-tat strategy is the most effective 
strategy to promote cooperation.4

• The long-term cost is the loss of profit in later periods. Jill will respond to Jack’s 
underpricing by cutting her price, and this decreases Jack’s profit. For example, 
if Jill retaliates with the duopoly price, Jack’s future profit will be $8,000 per day 
instead of the $9,000 he could have earned by going along with the cartel price. 
The cost of underpricing is the daily loss of $1,000 in profit.
If the two firms expect to share the market for a long time, the long-term cost 
of underpricing will exceed the short-term benefit, so underpricing is less likely. 
The threat of punishment makes it easier to resist the temptation to cheat on 
the cartel. 
Price Fixing and the Law
Under the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890 and subsequent legislation, explicit price 
fixing is illegal. It is illegal for firms to discuss pricing strategies or methods of punish-
ing a firm that underprices other firms. In one of the early price-fixing cases (Addyston 
Pipe, 1899), six manufacturers of cast-iron pipe met to fix prices. Several months after 
the Supreme Court ruled that their cartel pricing was illegal, the firms merged into a 
single firm, so instead of acting like a monopolist, they became a monopolist. Here are 
some other examples of price fixing:
1	 Electric generators (1961). Executives from General Electric and Westinghouse 
were convicted of fixing prices for electrical generators, resulting in fines of over 
$2 million and imprisonment or probation for 30 corporate executives.
2	 Carton-board pricing in Europe (1994). The European Union Commission fined 
19 manufacturers of carton board a total of 132 million euros ($165 million) for 
operating a cartel that fixed prices at secret meetings in luxury Zurich hotels.
3	 Food additives (1996). An employee of Archer Daniels Midland (ADM), a huge 
food company, provided audio and videotapes of ADM executives conspiring to 
fix prices. ADM pleaded guilty to the charges of price fixing and was fined $100 
million.
4	 Music distribution (2000). In exchange for advertising subsidies, music retailers 
agreed to adhere to the minimum advertised prices (MAP) specified by distribu-
tors. Any retailer that advertised a CD for less than the MAP would lose all of its 
“cooperative advertising” funds from the distributor. In May 2000, the Federal 
Trade Commission reached an agreement with music distributors to end the MAP 
scheme. The FTC estimated that the MAP scheme imposed an annual cost of 
$160 million on U.S. music consumers.5
5	 Industrial diamonds (2004). DeBeers, the world’s largest diamond producer, pled 
guilty to conspiring with General Electric to fix the price of industrial diamonds, 
and paid a fine of $10 million. 
Price Leadership
Because explicit price fixing is illegal, firms sometimes rely on implicit pricing agree-
ments to fix prices at the monopoly level. Under the model of price leadership, one 
of the oligopolists plays the role of price leader. The leading firm picks a price, and 
other firms match the price. Such an agreement allows firms to cooperate without 
actually discussing their pricing strategies.
The problem with an implicit pricing agreement is that it relies on indirect signals 
that are often garbled and misinterpreted. Suppose two firms have cooperated for sev-
eral years, both sticking to the cartel price. When one firm suddenly drops its price, 
the other firm could interpret the price cut in one of two ways:
• A change in market conditions. Perhaps the first firm observed a change in 
demand or production cost and decides that both firms would benefit from a 
lower price.
price leadership
A system under which one firm in an oli-
gopoly takes the lead in setting prices.

part 9
610
• Underpricing. Perhaps the first firm is trying to increase its market share and 
profit at the expense of the second firm.
The first interpretation would probably cause the second firm to match the lower 
price of the first firm, and price fixing would continue at the lower price. In contrast, 
the second interpretation could trigger a price war, undermining the price-fixing 
agreement. 
Simultaneous Decision Making and the Payoff Matrix
So far we have considered a game with sequential decisions. Jill chooses her price first, 
and then Jack observes her choice and then makes his own. An alternative scenario is 
that the two firms make their decisions simultaneously, so each firm picks its price 
without knowing the other firm’s price. The analysis of a simultaneous game requires 
a different tool. A payoff matrix shows, for each possible outcome of a game, the 
consequences—or payoffs—for each player.
Simultaneous Price-Fixing Game
Figure 27.6 shows the payoff matrix for the price-fixing game. Each cell in the matrix 
shows the payoffs from a potential outcome of the game. In the northwest corner of 
the matrix, if both firms pick the high price, each firm earns a profit of $9,000. In the 
southeast corner, if both firms pick the low price, each firm earns a profit of $8,000. 
If one firm picks the low price and the other picks the high price, the low-price firm 
earns $12,000 and the high-price firm earns only $3,000. For example, in the north-
east corner, if Jill picks the high price and Jack picks the low price, Jill earns a profit of 
$3,000 and Jack earns a profit of $12,000.
We can use the payoff matrix to predict the equilibrium of the price-fixing game. 
In a simultaneous-decision game, Jack doesn’t know whether Jill will pick the low price 
or the high price. There are two possibilities:
• If Jill picks the high price, we will be in the upper half of the matrix, and Jack’s 
best response is the low price. In the northeast corner of the matrix, he can earn

price (and also pay the customer some percentage of the price 
gap). In fact, for each of the 35 types of tires, the December price 
was the same or higher than the November price. In this case, a 
low-price guarantee generated higher prices.
Is the relationship between low-price guarantees and prices 
apparent or real? A careful study of the retail tire market sug-
gests that prices are generally higher in markets where firms 
offer low-price guarantees. On average, the presence of a 
low-price guarantee increases prices by $4 per tire, or about 
10 ­percent of the price.  Related to Exercises 2.5.

$12,000 by picking the low price. This is better than the $9,000 he can earn by 
picking the high price in the northwest corner.
• If Jill picks the low price, we will be in the lower half of the matrix, and Jack’s 
best response is the low price. In the southeast corner of the matrix, he can earn 
$8,000 by picking the low price. This is better than the $3,000 he can earn by 
picking the high price in the southwest corner.
In other words, the low price is the dominant strategy for Jack. Jill knows this, so she 
realizes that the equilibrium will be in the eastern half of the matrix. Her best response 
is the low price. In the southeast corner of the matrix, she can earn $8,000 by picking 
the low price. This is better than the $3,000 she can earn in the northeast corner by 
picking the high price. Therefore, the equilibrium is the same as with the game-tree 
approach: Both firms pick the low price. 
The Prisoners’ Dilemma
We can gain some insight into the duopolists’ dilemma by examining the classic pris-
oners’ dilemma. Consider two people, Bonnie and Clyde, who have been accused of 
committing a crime. The police give each person an opportunity to confess to the 
crime. The traditional version of the story is a simultaneous decision-making game: 
The two are put in separate rooms, and each makes a choice without knowing the 
other’s choice.
The police confront Bonnie and Clyde with the payoff matrix in Figure 27.7. If 
both confess, each gets 5 years in prison, as shown in the southeast corner of the matrix. 
If neither confesses, the police can convict both of them on a lesser charge, and each 
gets 2 years, as shown in the northwest corner of the matrix. If only one confesses, he 
or she will implicate the other prisoner. The confessor is rewarded with a 1-year prison 
sentence, while the other prisoner gets 10 years. If Bonnie confesses and Clyde does 
not, we are in the southwest corner of the matrix. If the roles are reversed, we are in 
the northeast corner.
We can use the payoff matrix to predict the equilibrium of the prisoner game. In a 
simultaneous-decision game, Clyde doesn’t know whether Bonnie will confess or not:
• If Bonnie does not confess, we are in the upper half of the matrix, and Clyde’s 
best response is to confess. In the northeast corner of the matrix, he gets 1 year 
in prison if he confesses. This is better than the 2 years he would get in the 
northwest corner by not confessing.

• If Bonnie confesses, we are in the lower half of the matrix, and Clyde’s best 
response is to confess. In the southeast corner of the matrix, he gets 5 years in 
prison. This is better than the 10 years he would get in the southwest corner by 
not confessing.
In other words, confessing is the dominant strategy for Clyde. Bonnie knows this, 
so she realizes that the equilibrium will be in the eastern half of the matrix. Her best 
response is to confess. In the southeast corner of the matrix, she gets 5 years in prison. 
This is better than the 10 years she would get in the northeast by not confessing.
If both prisoners confess and each gets 5 years in prison, we have a Nash equilibrium 
because each prisoner is doing the best he or she can, given the actions of the other prisoner. 
Although both would be better off if they kept quiet, they implicate each other because 
the police reward them for doing so. There is an incentive for squealing, just as there is an 
incentive for one duopolist to underprice the other.

Chapter 27 • Oligopoly and Strategic Behavior
613
If Mona discovers that a second airline is thinking about entering the market, what 
will she do? Now that her monopoly is insecure, she has two options: She can be passive 
and allow the second airline to enter the market, or she can try to prevent the other 
firm from entering the market.
The passive approach will lead to the duopoly outcome we saw earlier in the chapter. 
In Figure 27.8, if the second firm enters the market, we move downward along the market 
demand curve from point c to point d. In a duopoly, each firm charges a price of $300 
and serves 40 passengers, half the total quantity demanded at a price of $300. For each 
duopolist, the daily profit is $8,000:
profit = (price - average cost) * quantity per firm = ($300 - $100) * 40 = $8,000
The Insecure Monopolist and Entry Deterrence
We’ve seen what happens when two duopolists try to act as one, fixing the price at 
the monopoly level. Consider next how a monopolist might try to prevent a second 
firm from entering its market. We use some of the numbers from our airline example, 
although we look at a different city with a different cast of characters.
Suppose Mona initially has a secure monopoly in the market for air travel between 
two cities. When there is no threat of entry, Mona uses the marginal principle (mar-
ginal revenue equals marginal cost) to pick a quantity and a price. In Figure 27.8, we 
start at point c on the market demand curve, with a quantity of 60 passengers per day 
and a price of $400 per passenger. Her profit is $18,000:
profit = (price - average cost) * quantity per firm = ($400 - $100) *60 = $18,000

Entry Deterrence and Limit Pricing
The second option is to take actions to prevent the second firm from entering the 
market. To decide whether to deter the entry of the other firm, Mona must answer 
two questions:
• What must she do to deter entry?
• Given what she must do to deter entry, is deterrence more profitable than being 
passive and sharing the market with the second firm?
To prevent the second firm from entering the market, Mona must commit her-
self to serving a large number of passengers. If she commits to a large passenger load, 
there won’t be enough passengers left for a potential entrant to make a profit. Suppose 
there are economies of scale in providing air travel, and the minimum entry quantity 
is 20 passengers per day: That is, it would be impractical for a firm to serve fewer than 
20 passengers. In Figure 27.8, the long-run average cost curve is negatively sloped for 
relatively low levels of output, and the average cost for the minimum entry quantity of 
20 passengers is just over $100, say $101.
Mona must compute the quantity of output that is just large enough to prevent the 
second firm from entering the market. In Figure 27.8, point z shows the point of zero 
economic profit in the market: If the two firms serve a total of 120 passengers per day 
and split the market equally, with 60 passengers each, the price ($100) equals average 
cost, so each firm would earn zero economic profit. The quantity required to prevent 
the entry of the second firm is computed as follows:
 deterring quantity = zero profit quantity - minimum entry quantity 
 100 = 120 - 20
If Mona commits to serve 100 passengers and a second firm were to enter with the 
minimum quantity of 20 passengers, the price would drop to $100. Mona, with an 
average cost of $100 to serve 100 passengers, would break even. The second firm, 
with an average cost just above $100, would lose money. Specifically, if the aver-
age cost of 20 passengers is $101, the second firm would lose $1 per passenger, or 
$20 in total.
Note that Mona cannot simply announce that she will serve 100 passengers. She 
must take actions that ensure that her most profitable output is in fact 100 passengers. 
In other words, she must commit to 100 passengers. She could commit to the larger 
passenger load by purchasing a large fleet of airplanes and signing labor contracts that 
require her to hire a large workforce.
Which is more profitable, entry deterrence or the passive duopoly outcome? The 
deterrence strategy, shown by point e in Figure 27.8, generates a price of $200 and a 
profit of $10,000:
 profit = (price - average cost) * quantity per firm 
 = ($200 - $100) * 100 = $10,000
This is larger than the $8,000 profit under the passive approach, so deterrence is the 
best strategy.
Figure 27.9 uses a game tree to represent the entry-deterrence game. Mona makes 
the first move, and she considers the consequences of her two options:
• If Mona is passive and commits to serve only 40 passengers, we reach the upper 
branch of the game tree. The best response for Doug, the manager of the second 
firm, is to enter to earn a profit of $8,000, as shown by rectangle 1.
• If Mona commits to serve 100 passengers, we reach the lower branch of the game 
tree. If Doug enters with the minimum entry quantity of 20 passengers, his aver-
age cost will be $101, which exceeds the market price of $100. Therefore, the 
best response is to stay out of the market and avoid losing money.

Chapter 27 • Oligopoly and Strategic Behavior

Mona can choose between rectangles 1 and 4. Mona’s profit is higher in rectangle 4, 
so that’s the equilibrium. The equilibrium path of the game is square A to square C to 
rectangle 4.
Mona’s entry-deterrence strategy generates a market price of $200, which is less than 
the $400 price charged by a secure monopolist and less than the $300 price with two 
competing firms. Mona can keep the second firm out of the market, but only by producing 
a large quantity and charging a relatively low price. This is known as limit pricing: To 
prevent a firm from entering the market, the firm reduces its price. The price that is just 
low enough to prevent entry is known as the limit price. 
Examples: Aluminum and Campus Bookstores
For an example of limit pricing, consider the Aluminum Company of America (Alcoa). 
Between 1893 and 1940, Alcoa had a monopoly on aluminum production in the United 
States. During this period, Alcoa kept other firms out of the market by producing a 
large quantity and keeping its price relatively low. Although a higher price would have 
generated more profit in the short run, the entry of other firms would eventually have 
reduced Alcoa’s profit.
We can apply the notion of entry deterrence to your favorite monopoly: your cam-
pus bookstore. On most college campuses, other organizations are prohibited, usually 
by the state government or the college, from selling textbooks on campus. Internet 
commerce has given students another option: order textbooks online and have them 
shipped by mail, UPS, FedEx, or DHL. Several online booksellers charge less than 
the campus bookstore, and the growth of Internet book sales thus threatens the cam-
pus bookstore monopoly. If your campus bookstore suddenly feels insecure about its 
monopoly position, it could cut its prices to prevent online booksellers from capturing 
too many of its customers. If it does this, you will pay lower prices even if you don’t 
patronize the Internet seller.

but more than the duopoly profit of $8,000.

Entry Deterrence and Contestable Markets
We’ve seen that an insecure monopolist may cut its price to prevent a second firm 
from entering the market. The same logic applies to a market that has a few firms 
but could have many. The mere existence of a monopoly or oligopoly does not 
necessarily generate high prices and large profits. To protect its market share, an 
oligopolist may act like a firm in a market with many firms, leading to relatively 
low prices.
The threat of entry faced by an insecure monopolist underlies the theory of market 
contestability. A contestable market is a market with low entry and exit costs. The 
few firms in a contestable market will be threatened constantly by the entry of new 
firms, so prices and profits will be relatively low. In the extreme case of perfect contest-
ability, firms can enter and exit a market at zero cost. In this case, the price will be the 
same as the price that would occur in a competitive market. Although few markets are 
perfectly contestable, many markets are contestable to a certain degree, and the threat 
of entry tends to decrease prices and profits. 
When Is the Passive Approach Better?
Although our example shows that entry deterrence is the best strategy for Mona, 
it won’t be the best strategy for all insecure monopolists. The key variable is the 
minimum entry quantity. Suppose that the scale economies in air travel were rela-
tively small, so a second firm could enter the market with as few as 10 passengers. 
In this case, if Mona commits to serving only 100 passengers, that won’t be enough 
to deter entry: A firm entering with 10 passengers will still make a profit. If the 
minimum entry quantity is 10 passengers, the entry-deterring quantity rises to 
110 passengers:
 deterring quantity = zero profit quantity - minimum entry quantity 
 110 = 120 - 10
Mona can commit to serving 110 passengers and thus prevent the second firm from 
entering the market, but is this the most profitable strategy? As shown by point f in 
Figure 27.8, the limit price associated with an entry-deterring quantity is $150. Mona’s 
profit from entry deterrence would be $5,500:
 profit = (price - average cost) * quantity per firm 
 = ($150 - $100) * 110 = $5,500
This is less than the $8,000 profit she could earn by being passive and letting the sec-
ond firm enter the market. In this case, the minimum entry quantity is relatively small, 
so the entry-deterring quantity is large and the limit price is low. As a result, sharing 
a duopoly is more profitable than increasing output and cutting the price to keep the 
other firm out.
For another example of the passive response to market entry, consider the ball-
point pen, introduced in 1945 by Reynolds International Pen Corporation.6 For 
3 years Reynolds earned enormous profits producing this revolutionary product 
and selling it for $12.50, about 16 times the average production cost of $0.80. Then 
in 1948, Reynolds stopped producing pens, dropping out of the market entirely. 
Why? Other producers could easily copy the simple production technology of the 
ballpoint pen. The limit price was thus so low that it was better for Reynolds to 
charge a high price and squeeze out as much profit as possible from a short-lived 
monopoly while it lasted. By 1948, a total of 100 firms had entered the ballpoint 
market, and the price had fallen to the average cost of production, so each firm 
made zero economic profit.

The Advertisers’ Dilemma
We have explored two sorts of strategic behavior of firms in an oligopoly: price fixing 
and entry deterrence. A third type of strategy concerns advertising. As we’ll see, firms 
in an oligopoly may suffer from an advertisers’ dilemma: Although both firms would 
be better off if neither spent money on advertising, each firm advertises.
Consider the producers of two brands of aspirin. Each firm must decide whether 
to spend $7 million on an advertising campaign for its product. In Table 27.3, the first 
two columns show what happens if neither firm advertises. Each firm earns $8 million 
in net revenue (revenue minus production cost) and spends no money on advertising, so 
each firm earns $8 million in profits. The third and fourth columns show what happens 
if each firm spends $7 million on advertising. The net revenue for each firm increases 
by only $5 million, so the profit of each firm drops by $2 million, to $6 million.

Microsoft As An Insecure Monopolist
Applying the Concept #4: How does a monopolist respond to the threat of entry?
tools is about $354, but the actual price (the limit price) is 
about $143. The estimated cost for a second firm to develop, 
maintain, and market an alternative software bundle is about 
$38 billion, and Microsoft’s actual price is just low enough to 
make such an investment unprofitable.
2	 The pure monopoly profit would be about $191 billion, while 
the profit under Microsoft’s limit pricing is about $153 billion. 
Although the profit under the entry-deterrence strategy is less 
than the pure monopoly profit, it is greater than the profit 
Microsoft would earn if it allowed a second firm to enter the 
market ($148 billion). In other words, entry deterrence is the 
best strategy.   Related to Exercises 4.8.

Microsoft has a virtual monopoly in the market for personal-
computer operating systems and business software. But there is 
a constant threat that another firm will launch competing prod-
ucts, so Microsoft engages in limit pricing to deter entry into 
its key markets. A recent study revealed some of the numbers 
behind the insecure monopoly.

What happens if one firm advertises and the other does not? As shown in the

increases to $17 million and her profit increases to $10 million. Adeline’s advertise-
ments cause some of Vern’s consumers to switch to Adeline, and Vern’s profit drops 
to $5 million.
We can use the data in Table 27.3 to construct a game tree for the advertising 
game. In Figure 27.10, Adeline makes her decision first, followed by Vern:
• If neither firm advertises, we go from square A to square C to rectangle 4, and 
each firm gets a profit of $8 million.
• If both firms advertise, we go from square A to square B to rectangle 1, and each 
firm earns a profit of $6 million.
• If Adeline advertises and Vern does not, we go from square A to square B to rect-
angle 2. Adeline earns $10 million, while Vern earns $5 million. If the roles are 
reversed, we end up in rectangle 3, with Vern the advertiser earning $10 million 
and Adeline earning only $5 million.
▲  Figure 27.10  Game Tree for the Advertisers’ Dilemma
Adeline moves first, choosing to advertise or not. Vern’s best response is to advertise no matter what 
Adeline does. Knowing this, Adeline realizes that the only possible outcomes are shown by rectangles 
1 and 3. From Adeline’s perspective, rectangle 1 ($6 million) is better than rectangle 3 ($5 million), so her 
best response is to advertise. Both Adeline and Vern advertise, and each earns a profit of $6 million.

To determine the outcome of this advertising game, let’s start with Vern’s possible 
actions:
• If Adeline advertises, we move along the upper branches of the game tree from 
square A to square B. Vern will earn $6 million if he advertises (rectangle 1), 
but only $5 million if he does not advertise (rectangle 2). Therefore, Vern’s best 
response is to match Adeline’s campaign.
• If Adeline does not advertise, we move along the lower branches from square 
A to square C. Vern will earn $10 million if he advertises, but only $8 million 
if he does not. Therefore, if Adeline does not advertise, Vern’s best response is 
to advertise.

Chapter 27 • Oligopoly and Strategic Behavior
619
Advertising is Vern’s dominant strategy because it is the best response no matter what 
Adeline does.
Consider next the options faced by Adeline. She will figure out that advertising 
is a dominant strategy for Vern, so she realizes that the only possible outcomes are 
shown by rectangles 1 and 3. To get to rectangle 1, she advertises and gets a profit of 
$6 million. This is better than not advertising and going to rectangle 3, with a profit 
of $5 million. So Adeline’s best response is to advertise. The thick arrows show the 
equilibrium path of the game, from square A to square B to rectangle 1. In equilibrium, 
both firms advertise and each earns a profit of $6 million.
What is the advertisers’ dilemma? Both Adeline and Vern would be better off if 
neither advertised. Each would get a profit of $8 million, compared to $6 million when 
they both advertise. But each firm has an incentive to use advertising to increase its 
sales at the expense of the other. Stuck in the dilemma, each firm earns $2 million less 
than it would if neither advertised.
Why does the advertisers’ dilemma occur? In general, it happens when advertising 
causes a relatively small increase in the total sales of the industry but allows a firm that 
advertises to gain at the expense of firms that don’t. In our example, a pair of advertising 
campaigns costing a total of $14 million increases the net revenue of the entire indus-
try by only $10 million. The increase in revenue is less than the cost of advertising, so 
advertising decreases total profit. Nonetheless, each firm has an incentive to advertise 
to take sales away from the other firm. If the increase in industry-wide net revenue 
were larger, advertising could benefit both firms.

Got Milk?
Applying the Concepts #5: What is the rationale for generic advertising?
so advertising by one producer increases demand and benefits 
other producers. No single firm has an incentive to incur the cost 
of an advertising campaign because the firm bears all the cost 
but experiences only a fraction of the benefits. The result is an 
advertisers’ dilemma: All firms would benefit from an advertis-
ing campaign, but no single firm has an incentive to pay for a 
campaign. The solution to this advertisers’ dilemma is to share 
the cost of an advertising campaign, along with the benefits.
In 2014, the industry ended the Got Milk? campaign and 
switched to Milk Life, a campaign that focuses on the protein 
content of milk. In one TV spot, a boy and his mother harness 
milk propellers to chase a soccer ball. The idea is to promote 
milk as a food to power activities during the day.   Related to

In this chapter, we’ve 
seen that when a few 
firms share a market 
they have an incen-
tive to act strategically. 
Firms in an oligopoly try 
to use cartel pricing—
price fixing—to avoid 
competition and keep 
prices high. A monopolist may commit to a large quantity and 
a low price in order to prevent a second firm from entering the 
market. Oligopolists may use advertising to increase their sales 
at the expense of competitors. Here are the main points of the 
chapter:
1.	 Each firm in an oligopoly has an incentive to underprice the other 
firms, so price fixing will be unsuccessful unless firms have some 
way of enforcing a price-fixing agreement.
2.	 One way to maintain price fixing is a low-price guarantee: One 
firm chooses the high price and promises to match any lower 
price of a competitor.
3.	 Price fixing is more likely to occur if firms choose prices repeatedly 
and can punish a firm that chooses a price below the cartel price.
4.	 To prevent a second firm from entering the market, an inse-
cure monopolist may commit itself to producing a relatively large 
quantity and accepting a relatively low price.
5.	 The advertisers’ dilemma is that both firms would be better off if 
neither firm advertised.

1.11	 Vitamin Market Areas. Beta and Gamma produce 
vitamin A at a constant average cost of $5 per unit. 
Assume that low-price guarantees are illegal. Here are 
the possible outcomes:
• Price fixing (cartel). Each firm sells 30 units at a 
price of $20 per unit.
• Duopoly (no price fixing). Each firm sells 40 units 
at a price of $12 per unit.
• Underpricing (one firm charges $20 and the other 
charges $12). The low-price firm sells 70 units and 
the high-price firm sells 5 units.

Gamma. Draw a game tree for the price-fixing

a price of $25.
• Duopoly (no price fixing). Each firm has 20 passen-
gers at a price of $20.

Overcoming the Duopolists’ Dilemma
Explain the effects of a low-price guarantee on the price.
2.1	 For firms with a low-price guarantee, the promise 
of matching a lower price is a(n) 
 promise 
because all firms will charge the same 
 price.
2.2	 Suppose that Jack and Jill use a tit-for-tat scheme to 
encourage cartel pricing. Jill chooses the low price for 
two successive months, and then switches to the high 
price. The two firms will deviate from cartel pricing for 
a total of 
 months.
2.3	 If two firms expect to be in the market together for a 
long time, the 
 (cost/benefit) of underpricing 
will be large relative to the 
 (cost/benefit).
2.4	 If a seller promises to refund any difference between its 
price and the price of its competitors, this practice will 
lead to 
 (higher/lower) prices.
2.5	 A careful study of the retail tire market suggests that 
low-price guarantees 
 (increase/decrease) 
prices by about 
 (1, 10, 25, 37) percent. 
(Related to Application 2 on page 610.)
2.6	 Low-Price Guarantees for a Canopy Tour. Dip and 
Zip provide canopy tours in a rain forest. The average 
cost per rider is constant at $10. Here are the possible 
outcomes:
• Price fixing (cartel). Each firm has 6 passengers at 
a price of $20.
• Duopoly (no price fixing). Each firm has 8 passen-
gers at a price of $15.
• Underpricing (one firm charges $20 and the other 
charges $15). The low-price firm has 13 passengers 
and the high-price firm has 2 passengers.
Dip chooses a price first, followed by Zip.
a.	 Assume that the firms do not provide low-price 
guarantees. Draw a game tree and predict the out-
come of the price-fixing game.
b.	Suppose both firms provide low-price guarantees. 
Draw a new game tree and predict the outcome of 
the price-fixing game.
c.	 Is the promise to match any lower price a substan-
tive promise or an empty promise?
2.7	 Going Out of Business Sales? Many firms have 
going-out-of-business sales with remarkable bargains. 
What insights does the material in this chapter provide 
about such sales?
2.8	 Under a price-leadership model, a sudden drop in price 
by the leader is unlikely to trigger a price war if other 
firms believe that the price cut was caused by higher 
.
Simultaneous Decision Making and the Payoff Matrix
Describe the prisoners’ dilemma.
3.1	 Consider a market with two firms managed by Harry

price), each firm earns a profit of $80. Under a duo-
poly (both firms pick the low price), each firm earns a 
profit of $60. If the two firms pick different prices, the 
high-price firm earns a profit of $20 and the low-price 
firm earns a profit of $90.
a.	 Fill in the following payoff matrix.
b.	The outcome of the pricing game is that Harry picks

The Insecure Monopolist and Entry Deterrence
Explain the behavior of an insecure monopolist.
4.1	 Otto has a monopoly on limousine service, and Carla 
is thinking about entering the market. The outcome 
of the entry-deterrence game represented by the 
game tree on the following page is that Otto picks 
the 
 quantity and Carla 
 the 
market.
4.2	 Use the game tree in the previous exercise as a start-
ing point. If the minimum entry quantity increases, 
a single number in one of the profit rectangles 
changes from $
 to a smaller number. If 
the relevant number is reduced by half, the new 
outcome of the entry-deterrence game is that Otto 
picks the 
 quantity and Carla 
 
the market.
4.3	 Consider a market with an insecure monopolist. The 
zero-profit quantity is 60 units and the minimum 
entry quantity is 5 units. The entry-deterring quantity 
is 
 units. The zero-profit price is $80. The 
slope of the market demand curve is -$2 per unit of 
output. The limit price is 
 .
4.4	 To deter entry, a monopolist can simply threaten that 
if a second firm enters, the monopolist will cut its price

for fantasy amphibians is linear, with a slope of -$0.01 
per amphibian. The average cost of production is con-
stant at $3. The demand curve intersects the horizon-

c.	 How would your response to part (a) change if the 
minimum entry quantity dropped to 50 amphibians?
4.10	 Take the Pen Money and Run? Consider the exam-
ple of Reynolds International Pen and the ballpoint 
pen. Suppose the unit cost of a ballpoint pen is $1.00. 
Reynolds has two options:
1.	Passive. Pick the monopoly price of $13. In the 
first year, Reynolds will sell 100,000 pens. Over 
time as other firms enter the market with lower 
prices, the quantity sold by Reynolds will decrease 
by 20,000 per year, to 80,000 in the second year 
and so on, down to zero in the sixth year.
2.	Deterrence. Commit to produce 1 million pens per 
year, an amount large enough to deter entry. The 
limit price is $1.05.
a.	 Under the passive strategy, the profit per year 
is $
 in the first year, $
 in 
the second year, and so on, down to zero in 
the sixth year. The total profit over the 6-year 
period would be $
 .
b.	Under the deterrence strategy, the profit per 
year is $
. Over a 20-year period, total 
profit would be $
.
c.	 Taking a 20-year perspective, which strategy is 
more profitable?
d.	How would your answer to part (c) change if 
the limit price were $1.50 rather than $1.05?
4.11	 Shuttle Deterrence? Consider the market for air 
travel between Boston and New York. The long-run 
average cost is constant at $100 per passenger, and the 
demand curve is linear, with a slope of -$2 per pas-
senger. The demand curve intersects the horizontal 
average-cost curve at a quantity of 120 passengers. The 
minimum entry quantity is 20 passengers. FirstShuttle 
currently has a monopoly, with 60 passengers at a price 
of $220. Another firm, SecondShuttle, is considering 
the market, and the minimum entry quantity is 20 pas-
sengers. If FirstShuttle is passive and lets the other 
firm enter, each firm will have 40 passengers at a price 
of $180.
a.	 Draw a graph like the one shown in Figure 27.8 on 
page 613 with all the relevant numbers.
b.	Draw a game tree like the one shown in Figure 27.9 
on page 615 and predict the outcome of the game. 
How will FirstShuttle respond to the threat of 
entry? Will SecondShuttle enter the market?
c.	 How would your response to (a) change if the mini-
mum entry quantity dropped to 10 passengers?
4.12	 Going off Patent. Consider the producer of a branded 
drug that will soon go off patent and compete with 
generic versions of the drug. The average cost of pro-
duction is constant at $8 per dose. The producer could 
prevent the entry of generics by committing to a limit 
price of $10. At this price, the firm will sell 100 doses 
per day. Alternatively, the producer could charge a 
price of $12 and passively allow generics to enter the 
market. The price elasticity of demand for the branded 
drug is 2.0.
a.	 Under the passive approach (price = $12), the quan-
tity of the branded drug demanded is 
; 
the firm’s profit is 
.
b.	Under the entry-deterrence approach, the firm’s 
profit is $
 .
c.	 The best approach is 
 (entry deterrence, 
passive).
d.	If the price elasticity of demand for the branded 
drug were 3.0 instead of 2.0, the profit under the 
passive approach would be $
, so the best 
strategy is 
 (entry deterrence, passive).
The Advertisers’ Dilemma

5.2	 The advertisers’ dilemma shown in Figure 27.10 on 
page 618 occurs when advertising causes a relatively 
 increase in the total sales of an industry.
5.3	 Consider a duopoly with two firms managed by Huck 
and Stella. A standard advertising campaign has a cost 
of $5 million per firm. If both firms run a standard 
campaign, the net revenue from sales increases by $4 
for each firm. If only one firm runs a campaign, the 
advertiser’s net revenue from sales increases by $8 
million, and the other firm’s net revenue from sales 
decreases by $7 million. Fill in the blanks in the follow-

advertising, each firm’s net revenue will be $12 mil-

in net revenue and $13 million in profit ($20 million 
minus $7 million for advertising). If only one producer 
advertises, that firm will earn $16 million in net rev-
enue, and the other firm will earn $15 million in net 
revenue. Prepare a game tree like Figure 27.10 on page 
618. Assume that Bessie decides first. What is the out-
come of this advertising game? If there is an advertis-
ers’ dilemma, how does it differ from the advertisers’

Price Fixing
Here is a price-fixing or cartel game for the classroom. 
You’ll have an opportunity to conspire to fix prices in a 
hypothetical market with five firms. The instructor divides 
the class into five groups. Each group represents one of 
five firms that produce a particular good. Each group must 
develop a pricing strategy for its firm, recognizing that the 
other groups are choosing prices for their firms at the same 
time. Only two choices are possible: a high price (the cartel 
Ec ono m ic Experiment
price) or a low price. The profit of a particular firm depends 
on the price chosen by the firm and the prices chosen by the 
four other firms. The profit matrix is shown below.
From the second row, if one of the five firms chooses the 
high price, and the other four firms choose the low price, the 
high-price firm earns a profit of $2, and each low-price firm 
earns a profit of $7. The game is played for several rounds. In 
the first three rounds, the firms make their choices without

talking to each other in advance. In the fourth and fifth 
rounds, the firms discuss their strategies, disperse, and then 
make their choices. The group’s score equals the profit 
earned by the firm.

In April 2000, four former executives of drug 
­companies pled guilty to conspiring to fix the 
prices of bulk vitamins worldwide. 
It was the largest price-fixing case in U.S. history. The leading companies involved in 
the illegal cartel were Hoffman-La Roche (with 60 percent of the U.S. vitamin market), 
BASF AG (28 percent), and Rhone-Poulenc (7 percent). They were joined by other 
vitamin producers from Japan, Switzerland, and Canada. The announcement brought 
the number of Swiss and German executives imprisoned for the case to six, with fines 
for individual executives and their companies totaling $1 billion.
For almost a decade, these executives conspired to stifle competition around the 
globe by fixing prices on vitamins A, B2, B5, C, and E and beta carotene. The execu-
tives called their group “Vitamin Inc.” and met regularly in hotel rooms to carve up 
the market. Market shares for each region were specified down to a half percentage 
point, and prices for each vitamin were agreed upon down to the penny. For vitamin 
“premixes” (used for livestock feed and human food such as breakfast cereals), the 
executives rigged the bidding process for contracts, specifying a price and designat-
ing a “winner” for each contract. To help prevent cheating, they had “budget meet-
ings” to check each other’s data on sales and market shares. The cartel managed 
to boost the prices of vitamins, with markups averaging about 20 percent, or even 
more at the high end of the vitamin price range. For example, the price of vitamin A 
increased, from about $12 per pound to $20.
LaRoche ultimately paid a fine of $500 million, about half of its annual revenue 
from its vitamin business in the United States. BASF paid a fine of $225 million. 
Rhone-Poulenc broke ranks early in the investigation, and by cooperating with U.S. 
Justice Department investigators the firm avoided any fines. A group of Japanese 
companies paid a total of $137 million.1

his chapter looks at various public policies dealing with markets that are domi-
nated by a small number of firms. We start with the case of natural monopoly, 
which occurs when the scale economies in production are so large that only a 
single large firm can survive. In this case, the government can intervene by regulating 
the price charged by the natural monopolist. Then we look at markets in which the 
government can affect the number of firms in the market by using various policies to 
promote competition.
The government uses antitrust policies to break monopolies into several smaller 
companies, prevent corporate mergers that would reduce competition, and regulate 
business practices that tend to reduce competition. Sometimes prior government regu-
lations actually end up inhibiting competition, so the government later deregulates an 
industry to promote more competition. In the last part of the chapter, we look at the 
recent deregulation of three markets: air travel, telecommunications, and electricity. In 
these three markets, the government reversed a long history of regulation, deregulating 
the industries to promote competition.
Natural Monopoly
In an earlier chapter, we considered monopolies that resulted from artificial barriers 
to entry, such as patents and government licenses. In this chapter, we look at natural 
monopolies, which occur when the economies of scale for producing a product are 
so large that only a single firm can survive. Some examples of natural monopolies are 
water systems, natural gas distribution, electricity transmission, and cable TV service. 
It is efficient for a city to have a single supplier of water service because a second sup-
plier would install a second set of water pipes when a single set of pipes would suffice. 
Similarly, it is efficient to have a single set of transmission lines for electricity and a 
single set of cables for TV service.
Picking an Output Level
Figure 28.1 shows the long-run average-cost curve for water service in a particular 
city. The curve is negatively sloped and steep, reflecting the large economies of scale 
that occur because water service requires a costly system of pipes, and the cost is the 
same whether the firm pipes 70 or 70 million cubic meters of water. As the quantity of 
water increases, the average cost per unit decreases because the cost of the pipe system 
is spread over a larger volume of water.
What about the long-run marginal cost—the cost of an additional cubic meter of 
water delivered to a customer—once the system is built? For each additional unit, a 
water company incurs a cost for the energy required to pump the unit from the water 
source to a customer. The pumping cost depends on the distance (horizontal and 
vertical) from the source to the customer. To simplify matters, we’ll assume that the 
marginal cost is constant at $0.80 per cubic meter.
Learning Objective 28.1
Define a natural monopoly and explain 
the average-cost pricing policy.
M a r g i n a l  P r i n c i p l e 
Increase the level of an activity as long as its marginal benefit 
exceeds its marginal cost. Choose the level at which the marginal 
benefit equals the marginal cost.
Figure 28.1 shows how to use the cost curves and revenue curves to pick the output 
level that maximizes profit. Like other firms, the provider of water can use the marginal 
principle.

part 9
628
If a single firm—a monopolist—provides water, the firm-specific demand curve is 
the same as the market demand curve: The market demand curve shows, for each price, 
the number of units sold by the monopolist. From the firm’s perspective, the marginal 
benefit of a cubic meter of water is the increase in revenue—the marginal revenue. The 
marginal principle is satisfied at point a, with 70 million cubic meters. The price associ-
ated with this quantity is $2.70 per unit (shown by point b), and the average cost is $2.10 
per unit (shown by point c), so the profit per unit is $0.60. The price exceeds the average 
cost, so the water company will earn a profit.
Will a Second Firm Enter?
If there are no artificial barriers to entry, a second firm could enter the water market. 
What would happen if a second firm entered the market? In Figure 28.2, the entry of a 
second firm would shift the demand curve of the first firm—the former monopolist—to 
the left, from D1 to D2: At each price, the first firm will sell less water because it now 
shares the market with another firm. For example, at a price of $2.70, a total of 70 
million units are sold, or 35 million for each firm (point d ). In general, the larger the 
number of firms, the lower the demand curve for the typical firm.
Will a second firm enter the market? Notice that the demand curve of the typical 
firm in a two-firm market lies entirely below the long-run average-cost curve, so there 
is no quantity at which the price exceeds the average cost of production. No mat-
ter what price the typical firm charges, it will lose money. The firm’s demand curve 
lies below the average-cost curve because the average-cost curve is steep, reflect-
ing the large economies of scale for water provision. A second firm—with half the

and Price
Because of an indivisible input (the pipe system), the long-run average-cost curve is negatively sloped. 
The monopolist chooses point a, where marginal revenue equals marginal cost. The firm sells 70 million 
units of water at a price of $2.70 (point b) and an average cost of $2.10 (point c). The profit per unit of 
water is $0.60 (equal to $2.70 - $2.10).

The entry of a second firm would shift the demand curve of the typical firm to the left. After entry, the 
firm’s demand curve lies entirely below the long-run average-cost curve. No matter what price the firm 
charges, it will lose money. Therefore, a second firm will not enter the market.

market—would have a very high average cost and wouldn’t be able to charge a price 
high enough to cover the cost of building the pipe system in the first place. Therefore, 
the second firm will not enter the market, so there will be a single firm, a natural 
monopoly.
Price Controls for a Natural Monopoly
When a natural monopoly is inevitable, the government often sets a maximum price 
that the monopolist can charge consumers. There are many examples of natural 
monopolies that are subject to maximum prices. Local governments regulate utilities 
and firms that provide water, electricity, cable service, and local telephone service. 
Many state governments use public utility commissions (PUCs) to regulate the electric 
power industry.
We can use the water market to explain the effects of government regulation on 
a natural monopoly. Suppose the government sets a maximum price for water and 
requires the water company to serve all consumers who are willing to pay the maximum 
price. In other words, the government—not the firm—picks a point on the market 
demand curve. Under an average-cost pricing policy, the government picks the price at 
which the market demand curve intersects the monopolist’s long-run average-cost 
curve. In Figure 28.3, the average-cost curve intersects the demand curve at point e, 
with a price of $1.20 per cubic meter. This is much lower than the profit-maximizing 
price of $2.70. As a result, the total quantity of water demanded is much larger—150 
million units compared to 70 million. The purpose of the average-cost pricing policy 
is to get the lowest feasible price. The water company would lose money at any price 
less than $1.20, so a lower price isn’t feasible.

Public Versus Private Waterworks
Applying the Concepts #1: What is the rationale for regulating a natural monopoly?
made firefighting ineffective, and water hardness (high mineral 
content) that damaged industrial boilers and reduced the qual-
ity of silk products. The control of the water supply gradually 
returned to local governments, and by 1891 only one-sixth of 
the urban population was served by private water companies. 
In addition to improving water pressure and water softness, the 
move to municipal provision increased total consumption of 
water and decreased the capital cost per unit of water.
What does the British experience with water privatization tell 
us? The distribution of water is a natural monopoly, meaning that 
although a single firm will be profitable, two firms will not. The pri-
vate water companies established under the policies of Parliament 
were unregulated natural monopolies. As we’ve seen, an unregu-
lated monopoly is socially inefficient. In this case, the inefficiency 
resulted in a low-quality product (hard water), low service (low 
pressure), low output (small quantity of water per capita), and high 
capital cost. If the water monopolies had been regulated in an effi-
cient manner, the experience with privatization of the water supply 
might have been different.  Related to Exercises 1.5 and 1.9.

the Nineteenth Century,” Economic History Review 38 (1985), pp. 531–547.
In the middle part of the nineteenth century, the British parlia-
ment staged an experiment in private enterprise. In the early 
part of the century, water was drawn from local rivers, stored in 
ponds on higher ground, and then distributed by wooden pipes 
to customers. In most urban areas, this primitive water system 
was run by local government. The Industrial Revolution caused 
the rapid growth of urban areas, and local governments lacked 
explicit powers to borrow money to finance the expansion of 
their water systems. The policies of Parliament caused many 
towns and cities to switch to private water companies, and by 
1851 about three-fifths of the urban population got their water 
from private companies. There were many problems with the pri-
vate provision of water, including low pressure that sometimes

How will this regulatory policy affect the monopolist’s production costs? Under 
average-cost pricing, a change in the monopolist’s production cost will have little effect 
on its profit because the government will soon adjust the regulated price to keep the 
price equal to the average cost. The government will increase the regulated price when 
the monopolist’s cost increases and decrease the price when the monopolist’s cost 
decreases. Because the monopolist has no incentive to cut costs and faces no penalty 
for higher costs, its costs are likely to creep upward. As average cost increases, the 
regulated price will too.
Antitrust Policy
A trust is an arrangement under which the owners of several companies transfer 
their decision-making powers to a small group of trustees. The purpose of antitrust 
policy is to promote competition among firms, which leads to lower prices for 
consumers.
Two government organizations, the Antitrust Division of the Department of Jus-
tice and the Federal Trade Commission, are responsible for initiating actions against 
individuals or firms that may be violating antitrust laws. The courts have the power to 
impose penalties on the executives found to be in violation of the laws, including fines 
and prison sentences. In some cases, the government seeks no penalties but directs the 
firm to discontinue illegal practices and take other measures to promote competition.

Applying the Concepts #2: When does a natural monopoly occur?
that the new firm could have a lower fixed cost per subscriber 
and thus could earn a profit. One possible disadvantage was 
that the new firm might charge higher prices.
Two years later, the new firm, Sirius XM, earned its first 
quarterly profit of $14.2 million, compared to a loss 1 year 
earlier of $245.8 million. The firm became profitable—just 
barely—by increasing the number of subscribers to 19 mil-
lion and thus lowering its cost per subscriber. In other words, 
the merger transformed two unprofitable firms into a single 
profitable firm.
There was some concern that the merger would increase 
prices. Consumers choose from five packages of stations, 
including a limited set of stations for $10, the original Sirius 
stations for $13 (the same price as before the merger), a pack-
age that combines the original Sirius stations and a subset of 
the XM radio stations for $17, and a complete package for 
$19. In other words, the merger did not increase the price of 
the original Sirius package, but gave consumers more options 
for lower-priced and higher-priced packages.  Related to 
Exercises 1.6 and 1.10.

In 2008, the nation’s only two satellite radio providers, Sirius 
Satellite Radio and XM Satellite Radio, merged into a single 
firm. Together the two firms had 14 million subscribers, each 
paying $13 per month for dozens of channels, most of which are 
free of advertisements. Both firms were losing money as they 
struggled to get enough subscribers to cover their substantial 
fixed costs. The cost of the infrastructure to set up a single 
system—satellites and ground stations—is about $2 billion. In 
addition, both firms added to their setup costs by signing con-
tracts with radio personalities, news organizations, and sports 
information sources. One possible advantage of a merger was

We explore three types of antitrust policies: breaking up monopolies, blocking mergers, 
and regulating business practices.
Breaking Up Monopolies
One form of antitrust policy is to break up a monopoly into several smaller firms. The 
label “antitrust” comes from the names of the early conglomerates that the government 
broke up. The classic example is John D. Rockefeller’s Standard Oil Trust, which was 
formed in 1882 when the owners of 40 oil companies empowered nine trustees to make 
the decisions for all 40 companies. The trust controlled over 90 percent of the market 
for refined petroleum products, and the trustees ran it like a monopoly. In 1911, the 
government ordered its breakup. The Supreme Court found that Rockefeller had used 
“unnatural methods” to maintain his monopoly power and drive his rivals out of busi-
ness. In addition to forming the trust, he coerced railroads to give him special rates for 
shipping, and he spied on his competitors. The government broke up Standard Oil into 
34 separate companies, including the corporate ancestors of Exxon, Mobil, Chevron, 
and Amoco.
The American Tobacco Company started in 1890 as a merger of several tobacco 
firms. By 1907, the company had acquired over 200 rival firms and controlled 95 per-
cent of the U.S. cigarette market. The Supreme Court found that American Tobacco 
maintained its monopoly power by driving rivals out of business and agreeing to 
exclusive contracts with wholesalers that prevented them from purchasing cigarettes 
from other companies. The court-ordered breakup in 1911 led to new companies, 
including several of today’s big cigarette companies: R.J. Reynolds, Liggett and 
Meyers, and P. Lorillard.
In 1982, the government broke up American Telephone and Telegraph (AT&T) 
into seven regional phone companies. AT&T had used its legal monopoly in local 
telephone service to prevent competition in the markets for long-distance service and 
communications equipment. After an 8-year legal battle, AT&T agreed to form seven 
Regional Bell Operating Companies, transforming “Ma Bell” into seven “Baby Bells.” 
The new AT&T was allowed to compete in the market for long-distance service, 
where it faced competition from newcomers MCI and Sprint. AT&T was also allowed 
to operate in the market for communications equipment, where it faced competition 
from newcomers Mitel and Northern Telecom.
Blocking Mergers
A merger occurs when two or more firms combine their operations. A horizontal merger 
involves two firms producing a similar product, for example, two producers of pet food. 
A vertical merger involves two firms at different stages of the production process, for 
example, a sugar refiner and a candy producer. A second type of antitrust policy is to 
block corporate mergers that would reduce competition and lead to higher prices. We 
saw in an earlier chapter that as the number of firms in a market increases, competition 
among firms drives down prices. Because a merger decreases the number of firms in a 
market, it is likely to lead to higher prices. In 1994, Microsoft tried to purchase Intuit, 
the maker of Quicken, a personal-finance software package that was a substitute for a 
similar Microsoft product. The merger would have reduced competition in the per-
sonal-finance software market, so the government blocked it.
Of course, the government does not oppose all corporate mergers. One possible 
benefit from a merger is that the new firm could combine production, marketing, 
and administrative operations, producing products at a lower average cost. Consumers 
might reap the rewards in the form of lower prices. In 1997, the Justice Department 
and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) released new guidelines for proposed merg-
ers. The new guidelines allow companies involved in a proposed merger to present 
evidence that the merger would reduce costs and lead to lower prices, better products, 
or better service. If the evidence for greater efficiency is convincing, the government

might allow a merger that reduces the number of firms in a market. The chairman of 
the FTC assessed the effects of the new guidelines as follows:2
There may be some deals that go through which otherwise would not have. But it won’t 
change the result in a large number of cases [rather, it will have] the greatest impact in a 
transaction where the potential anticompetitive problem is modest and efficiencies that 
would be created are great.
The new guidelines will bring the U.S. antitrust rules closer in line with those of 
Europe and Canada and could help U.S. companies compete in those markets.
In recent years, the analysis of proposed mergers has shifted from counting the 
number of firms in a market to predicting how a particular merger would affect prices. 
The data generated by retail checkout scanners provide an enormous amount of infor-
mation about prices and quantities sold. Using these data, economists can determine 
how one firm’s pricing policies affect the sales of that firm and its competitors. Econo-
mists can use this information to predict whether a merger would lead to higher prices.
As we saw in the chapter opener, the FTC used pricing data to support its decision 
to block a proposed merger between Staples and Office Depot. The data showed that 
Staples charged lower prices in cities where Office Depot also had stores. Figure 28.4 
shows Staples’ revenue and cost curves for one specific product: file folders. Panel A 
shows what happens when Staples faces no competition from an Office Depot, and 
Panel B shows what happens when it does. The demand curve of Staples is lower in 
the city where it faces competition with Office Depot because the two firms share the 
market. Using the marginal principle, Staples picks the quantity and price where its 
marginal revenue equals its marginal cost. The profit-maximizing price is $14 in a city 
without an Office Depot and $12 in a city with one.
▲  Figure 28.4  Pricing by Staples in Cities with and without Competition
Using the marginal principle, Staples picks the quantity at which its marginal revenue equals its mar-
ginal cost. In a city without a competing firm, Staples picks the monopoly price of $14. In a city where 
Staples competes with Office Depot, the demand facing Staples is lower, so the profit-maximizing price 
is only $12.

The FTC used this logic to convince the court that the proposed merger of Sta-
ples and Office Depot would lead to higher prices. The judge in the case observed 
that, “direct evidence shows that by eliminating Staples’ most significant, and in many 
markets, only, rival, the merger would allow Staples to increase prices or otherwise 
maintain prices at an anticompetitive level.” Evidence from the companies’ pricing 
data showed that the merger would have allowed Staples to increase its prices by about 
13 percent. According to an FTC study, blocking the merger saved consumers an 
estimated $1.1 billion over 5 years.

Table 28.1   A Merger Increases Prices
Merger Remedy for Wonder Bread
In some cases, the government allows a merger to happen but imposes restrictions on 
the new company. In 1995, Interstate Bakeries, the nation’s third-largest wholesale 
baker, tried to buy Continental Baking, the maker of Wonder bread. Based on grocery 
store scanner data, the government concluded that Wonder bread is a close substitute 
for Interstate’s bread: The demand for Wonder bread increases when the price of Inter-
state’s bread increases, and vice versa.3 The scanner data showed that when Interstate 
increased its price, many consumers switched to Wonder bread, so their bread money 
went to Continental instead of Interstate. The substitutability of the two brands dis-
couraged Interstate from increasing its prices.
Table 28.1 shows an example of a merger leading to higher prices and smaller 
quantities. Let’s assume that the average cost per loaf of bread is $1.50, and this doesn’t 
change with a merger. The situation before the merger is shown in columns 1 and 3: 
For each brand, the price per loaf of bread is $2.00, the quantity is 100 loaves, and the 
profit is $50 (the profit $0.50 per loaf times 100 loaves).
How would a merger affect the incentives to raise prices? After a merger, a single 
company would earn the profits from both brands (Wonder and Interstate) and pick 
both prices. Suppose the new company increased the price of Interstate bread to $2.20 
but kept the price of Wonder bread at $2.00. The price hike would bring bad news and 
good news for the new company:
• Bad news: Less profit on Interstate bread. As shown in columns 3 and 4, the price 
hike decreases the quantity of Interstate bread from 100 to 70 loaves. Although 
the profit per loaf increases to $0.70 (the new price of $2.20 minus the average 
cost of $1.50), only 70 loaves are sold, so the profit from the brand drops to $49, 
down from $50. The bad news is the $1 loss of profit on Interstate bread.
• Good news: More profit on Wonder bread. As shown in columns 1 and 2, the 
increase in the price of Interstate bread increases the quantity of Wonder bread 
sold from 100 to 110 loaves. The profit per loaf is still $0.50 per bread, so the 
profit on Wonder bread increases to $55, up from $50. The good news is the 
extra $5 of profit on Wonder bread.
In this case, the good news ($5 more profit from Wonder) exceeds the bad news 
($1 less profit from Interstate), so the price hike increases the total profit of the merged 
company. This is shown in columns 5 and 6. Although the total quantity drops, total 
profit increases by $4. A merger means that the good news from a price hike stays 
within the larger firm, encouraging that firm to increase prices.
The lesson from this example is that a merger of two firms selling close substitutes 
may lead to higher prices. That’s what the Department of Justice concluded in the case 
of Interstate Bakeries and Continental Bakery. The government allowed the merger 
between the two companies but forced Interstate to sell some of its brands and bakeries. 
For example, Interstate sold the rights to sell its Weber brand bread to Four-S Baking 
Company. The idea was to ensure that other companies would be able to compete with 
the newly merged company.

Chapter 28 • Controlling Market Power: Antitrust and Regulation
635
Regulating Business Practices
The third type of antitrust policy involves the regulation of business practices. As we 
saw in the previous chapter, price fixing—a cooperative agreement among firms to col-
lude rather than compete—is illegal. Under the law, firms cannot discuss their pricing 
strategies with their competitors.
The government may intervene when a specific business practice increases market 
concentration in an already concentrated market. A tie-in sale occurs when a business 
forces the buyer of one product to purchase another product. The FTC recently 
charged a pharmaceutical company with tying the sale of clozapine, an antipsychotic 
drug, to a blood testing and monitoring system. Another illegal business practice is a 
cooperative agreement to limit advertising. The FTC recently charged a group of auto 
dealers with restricting comparative and discount advertising.
The Robinson–Patman Act prohibits the selling of products at “unreasonably low 
prices” with the intent of reducing competition, a practice known as predatory pricing. 
A firm engages in predatory pricing when it sells a product at a price below its production 
costs, with the objective of driving a rival out of business. Once the predator’s rivals drop 
out of the market, the firm then charges a monopoly price, well above its production cost. 
This strategy will be profitable if the firm can charge the monopoly price for a long 
enough period to offset the losses it experienced while driving its rivals out of business.
But is predatory pricing really practical? Consider a market with two firms, one of 
which is determined to have the market to itself. By cutting its price below its cost, the 
firm can drive its competitor out of business, losing perhaps $10 million in the process. If 
it increases its price next year, there may be nothing to prevent a new firm from entering 
the market. If so, it would have to cut its price below its cost again to drive the new firm 
out. The problem with predatory pricing is that it never ends. The firm must repeatedly 
lose money to drive out an endless series of competitors.
A Brief History of U.S. Antitrust Policy
Table 28.2 provides a brief summary of the history of antitrust policy. The first legis-
lation was the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890, which made it illegal to monopolize a 
market or to engage in practices that result in a restraint of trade. Because the act did 
not specify which practices were illegal, it led to conflicting court rulings.

ing tie-in sales contracts and price discrimination that reduces competition. The act

also outlawed mergers resulting from the purchase of a competitor’s stock when such 
a merger would substantially reduce competition.
Subsequent legislation clarified and extended antitrust laws. The Robinson–­
Patman Act of 1936 prohibited predatory pricing. The Celler–Kefauver Act of 1950 
closed a loophole in the Clayton Act by prohibiting one firm from purchasing another 
firm’s physical assets, such as buildings and equipment, when the acquisition would 
reduce competition substantially. The Hart–Scott–Rodino Act of 1980 extended anti-
trust legislation to proprietorships and partnerships. Before this act, antitrust legislation 
applied only to corporations.

Merger of Pennzoil and Quaker State
Applying the Concepts #3: How does a merger affect prices?
In 1998, Pennzoil Motor Oils purchased Quaker State Motor 
Oils in an acquisition valued at $1 billion. The merger brought 
together two of the five brands of premium motor oil, with a 
combined market share of 38% (29% for Pennzoil and 9% for 
Quaker State). The antitrust agencies approved the merger with-
out any modifications. A recent study of the merger concludes 
that the new company increased the price of the Quaker State 
products by roughly 5%, but did not change the price of Penn-
zoil products. The market share of Pennzoil products increased, 
while the market shares of Quaker State products decreased.
The study also examines the price effects of four other 
mergers. In three of four cases, the merger increased prices, 
with price hikes between 3 and 7 percent. The modest price 
effects might be surprising to (1) people who expect relatively 
large positive price effects as firms exploit their greater market 
power and (2) people who expect negative price effects as the 
firms become more efficient.  Related to Exercise 2.5.

Merger of Office Depot and Officemax
Applying the Concepts #4: What is the role of competition in the regulation of mergers?
The FTC concluded that the merger of the second and third larg-
est office supply superstores was unlikely to substantially reduce 
competition in the retail office-supply market. The FTC noted the 
increased competition in the office supplies market. Competition 
comes from general superstores such as Wal-Mart and Target 
and club stores such as Costco and Sam’s Club. In addition, 
Amazon and other Internet retailers of office supplies compete 
with office supply superstores.  Related to Exercise 2.6.

In this chapter, we’ve explored public 
policies for markets with a few dominant 
firms. In the case of natural monopoly, the 
government can regulate prices. In other 
industries, the government uses antitrust 
policies to affect the number of firms in 
the market, encouraging competition that 
leads to lower prices. Here are the main 
points of the chapter:
1.	 A natural monopoly occurs when 
there are large-scale economies in 
production, so the market can sup-
port only one firm.
2.	 Under an average-cost pricing pol-
icy, the regulated price for a natural 
monopoly is equal to the average cost 
of production.
3.	 The government uses antitrust policy 
to break up some dominant firms, 
prevent some corporate mergers, 
and regulate business practices that 
reduce competition.
4.	 The modern approach to merger policy uses price data to predict 
the effects of a merger.
5.	 In most circumstances, predatory pricing is unprofitable because 
the monopoly power is costly to acquire and hard to maintain.
6.	 The deregulation of the airline industry led to more competition 
and lower prices on average, but higher prices in some markets.

2.10	 Check YellowPages.com? On Yellin’s first day on the 
job as an economist with the FTC, she was put on a 
team examining a proposed merger between the coun-
try’s second- and fourth-largest hardware store chains. 
Her job was to predict whether a merger would increase 
hardware prices. Her boss handed her some CDs with 
checkout scanner data from the second-largest chain. 
Each CD contained scanner data from one small town, 
listing the prices and quantities of hammers, wrenches, 
nuts, bolts, rakes, glue, drills, and hundreds of other 
hardware products. Her boss also gave her the Web 
address for YellowPages.com. How can she use the 
information in the discs and YellowPages.com to make 
a prediction?
2.11	 Cost Savings from a Merger. Consider the follow-
ing statement from a firm that has proposed a merger 
between two companies: “The two companies could 
save about $50 million per year by combining our pro-
duction, marketing, and administrative operations. In 
other words, we could realize substantial economies 
of scale. Therefore, the government should allow the 
merger.” In light of the new guidelines concerning 
mergers, how would you react to this statement?
2.12	 Deadweight Loss from a Merger. Consider a mar-
ket that is initially served by two firms, each of which 
charges a price of $50 and sells 50 units of the good. 
The long-run average cost of production is constant 
at $40 per unit. Suppose a merger increases the price 
to $60 and reduces the total quantity sold from 100 to 
50. Compute the consumer loss associated with the 
merger. How does it compare to the increase in profit? 
What is the net loss from the merger?

One of the key tenets of the 
European Union (EU) is the equal 
treatment of men and women. 
In Test-Achats v. Council of Ministers, EU Advocate 
General Juinane Kokott ruled in 2011 that taking the 
gender of an insured person into account as a risk 
factor in insurance contracts is not compatible with 
the fundamental rights of citizens in the European 
Union. As a result, the providers of automobile insur-
ance cannot discriminate on the basis of gender, but 
must charge the same price to men and women.
What are the implications for the insurance mar-
ket? On average, women are much safer drivers: In 
Britain, the average insurance claim of an 18-year-old woman is about £2,700, compared to £4,400 for an 18-year-
old man. Before the unisex pricing policy, women paid lower prices because they were less costly for insurance 
companies. As expected, the ban on gender discrimination increased insurance prices for young women and 
decreased prices for young men. Economists expect that some women will respond to the higher price by dropping 
out of the automobile insurance pool, while some men will respond to the lower price by entering the pool. The pool 
will have a more costly mix of customers, leading to a higher average cost for insurance companies and a higher 
average price for automobile insurance.1

T
his chapter explores the role of information in markets and what happens when 
one side of the market has better information than the other. In the market for 
used cars, sellers know more about the quality of the product than buyers do. In 
the market for life insurance, buyers know more about the risks they face than sellers 
do. As we saw earlier in the book, the  model of supply and demand is based on several 
assumptions, one of which is that buyers and sellers have enough information to make 
informed choices. In a world of fully informed buyers and sellers, markets operate 
smoothly, generating an equilibrium price and an equilibrium quantity for each good. 
In a world with imperfect information, some goods will be sold in very small numbers 
or not sold at all. In addition, buyers and sellers will use resources to acquire informa-
tion to help make better decisions. The 2001 Nobel Prize in economics was awarded to 
three economists—George Akerlof, Michael Spence, and Joseph Stiglitz—who studied 
the effects of imperfect information on all sorts of markets.
Adverse Selection for Buyers: The Lemons Problem
The classic example of a market with imperfect information is the market for used cars.2 
Suppose there are two types of cars, low quality and high quality. A low-quality car, 
also known as a “lemon,” breaks down frequently and has relatively high repair costs. 
A high-quality car, also known as a “plum,” is reliable and has relatively low repair costs. 
Suppose buyers cannot distinguish between lemons and plums. Although a buyer can 
get some information about a particular car by looking at the car and taking it for a test 
drive, the information gleaned from this kind of inspection is not enough to determine 
the quality of the car. In contrast, a person selling a car after owning it for a while knows 
from experience whether the car is a lemon or a plum. We say there is asymmetric 
information in a market if one side of the market—either buyers or sellers—has better 
information than the other side. Because buyers cannot distinguish between lemons 
and plums, there will be a single market for used automobiles: Both types of cars will 
be sold together in this mixed market for the same price.
Uninformed Buyers and Knowledgeable Sellers
How much is a consumer willing to pay for a used car that could be either a lemon or 
a plum? To determine a consumer’s willingness to pay in a mixed market with both 
lemons and plums, we must answer three questions:
1	 How much is the consumer willing to pay for a plum?
2	 How much is the consumer willing to pay for a lemon?
3	 What is the chance that a used car purchased in a mixed market will be of low 
quality?
Suppose the typical buyer is willing to pay $4,000 for a plum and $2,000 for a 
lemon. The buyer is willing to pay less for a lemon because it is less reliable and 
has higher repair costs. For someone willing to put up with the hassle and repair 
expense, a lemon is a reasonable car. That’s why the typical buyer is willing to pay 
$2,000, not $0, for a low-quality car we tag with the label “lemon.” Someone who 
pays $2,000 and gets a lemon is just as happy as someone who pays $4,000 and 
gets a plum.
Consumer expectations play a key role in determining the market outcome when 
there is imperfect information. Suppose half the used cars on the road are lemons, and 
consumers know this. A reasonable expectation for consumers is that half the cars on 
the used-car market will be lemons, too. In other words, buyers initially expect a 50–50 
split between the two types of cars. A reasonable assumption is that a buyer in the 
mixed market is willing to pay the average value of the two types of cars, or $3,000. 
In other words, a buyer is willing to pay $3,000 for a 50–50 chance of getting either a 
plum or a lemon.

The current owner of a used car knows from everyday experience whether the 
car is a lemon or a plum. Given the single market price for all used cars, lemons and 
plums alike, the question for each owner is “Should I sell my car?” The answers to this 
question are shown by the two supply curves in Figure 29.1, one for lemons and one 
for plums:
• Lemon supply. As shown by the lower curve, the minimum supply price for 
lemons is $500: At any price less than $500, no lemons will be supplied. Lemons 
have a lower minimum price because they are worth less to their current owners. 
The number of lemons supplied increases with price. For example, 80 cars will 
be supplied at a price of $3,000 (point b).
• Plum supply. As shown by the upper curve, the minimum supply price for plums 
is $2,500: At any price less than $2,500, no plums will be supplied. Consistent 
with the law of supply, the higher the price of used cars, the larger the number 
of plums supplied. For example, 20 plums will be supplied at a price of $3,000 
(point a).
▲  Figure 29.1  All Used Cars on the Market Are Lemons
If buyers assume that there is a 50–50 chance of getting a lemon or a plum, they are willing to pay 
$3,000 for a used car. At this price, 20 plums are supplied (point a) along with 80 lemons (point b). This 
is not an equilibrium because consumers’ expectations of a 50–50 split are not realized. If consum-
ers become pessimistic and assume that all cars on the market will be lemons, they are willing to pay 
$2,000 for a used car. At this price, only lemons will be supplied (point c). Consumer expectations are 
realized, so the equilibrium is shown by point c, with an equilibrium price of $2,000.

Equilibrium with All Low-Quality Goods
Table 29.1 shows two scenarios for our hypothetical used-car market, based on the 
supply curves shown in Figure 29.1. In the first column, we assume buyers have 50–50 
expectations about the quality of used cars. As we saw earlier, if buyers expect a 50–50 
split between lemons and plums, the typical buyer will be willing to pay $3,000 for a 
used car. From the supply curves in Figure 29.1, we know that at this price 20 plums 
and 80 lemons will be supplied, so 80 percent of the used cars (80 of 100) will be 
lemons. In this case, consumers are too optimistic and underestimate the chance of 
getting a lemon.
The experiences of these 100 consumers show that the actual chance of get-
ting a lemon is 80 percent, not 50 percent as initially assumed. Once future buyers 

Chapter 29 • Imperfect Information: Adverse Selection and Moral Hazard
643
realize this, they will of course become more pessimistic about the used-car market. 
Suppose they assume that all the used cars on the market will be lemons. Under 
this assumption, the typical buyer will be willing to pay only $2,000 (the value of 
a lemon) for a used car. As shown in Figure 29.1, this price is less than the $2,500 
minimum price for supplying plums, so plums will disappear from the used-car 
market. At a price of $2,000, the quantity of plums supplied is zero, but the quantity 
of lemons supplied is 45 (point c). In other words, all the used cars will be lemons, 
so consumers’ pessimism is justified. Because consumers’ expectations are consis-
tent with their actual experiences in the market, the equilibrium price of used cars 
is $2,000. The equilibrium in the used-car market is shown in the second column 
of Table 29.1.
In this equilibrium, no plums are bought or sold, so every buyer will get a lemon. 
People get exactly what they pay for: They are willing to pay $2,000 for a serviceable 
but low-quality car, and that’s what each consumer gets. The domination of the used-
car market by lemons is an example of the adverse-selection problem. The unin-
formed side of the market (buyers in this case) must choose from an undesirable or 
adverse selection of used cars. The asymmetric information in the market generates a 
downward spiral of price and quality:
• The presence of low-quality goods on the market pulls down the price consum-
ers are willing to pay.
• The decrease in price decreases the number of high-quality goods supplied, 
decreasing the average quality of goods on the market.
• This decrease in the average quality of goods on the market pulls down the price 
consumers are willing to pay again.
In the extreme case, the downward spiral continues until all the cars on the market are 
lemons.
A Thin Market: Equilibrium with Some High-Quality Goods
The disappearance of plums from our hypothetical used-car market is an extreme case. 
The plums disappeared from the market because informed plum owners decided to 
keep their cars rather than sell them at a relatively low price in the used-car market. 
This outcome would change if the minimum supply price of plums were lower, specifi-
cally if it were below $2,000. In this case, most but not all the used cars on the market 
will be lemons, and some lucky buyers will get plums. In this case, we say asymmetric 
information generates a thin market: Some high-quality goods are sold, but fewer than 
would be sold in a market with perfect information.

Figure 29.2 shows the situation that leads to a thin market. The minimum supply 
price for plums is $1,833, and the quantity of plums supplied increases with the price of 
used cars. Suppose consumers are initially pessimistic, assuming all cars for sale will be 
lemons. This means consumers are willing to pay only $2,000 for a used car. Because 
the minimum supply price for plums ($1,833) is now less than the willingness to pay 
for a lemon, some plums will be supplied at a price of $2,000. In Figure 29.2, 5 plums 
and 45 lemons are supplied at this price, so 1 of every 10 buyers will get a plum. In this 
case, pessimism is not an equilibrium because some buyers will get plums when they 
expect lemons. This is also shown in the first column of Table 29.2.
▲  Figure 29.2  The Market for High-Quality Cars (Plums) Is Thin
If buyers are pessimistic and assume that only lemons will be sold, they are willing to pay $2,000 for 
a used car. At this price, 5 plums are supplied (point a), along with 45 lemons (point b). This is not an 
equilibrium because 10 percent of consumers get plums, contrary to their expectations. If consumers 
assume that there is a 25 percent chance of getting a plum, they are willing to pay $2,500 for a used 
car. At this price, 20 plums are supplied (point c), along with 60 lemons (point d). This is an equilibrium 
because 25 percent of consumers get plums, consistent with their expectations. Consumer expectations 
are realized, so the equilibrium is shown by points c and d.

In equilibrium, consumer expectations about the chances of getting the two types 
of cars are realized. Suppose consumers expect one of every four cars to be a plum. Let’s 
assume each consumer is willing to pay $2,500 for a used car under these circumstances. 
Consumers are willing to pay a bit more than the value of a lemon because there is 
a small chance of getting a plum. In Figure 29.2, at this price 20 plums are supplied 
(point c) and 60 lemons are supplied (point d), so in fact one in four consumers actually 
gets a plum. This is an equilibrium because 25 percent of the cars sold are plums and 
75 percent are lemons, consistent with consumers’ expectations. This is also shown in 
the second column of Table 29.2.
Evidence of the Lemons Problem
The lemons model makes two predictions about markets with asymmetric information. 
First, the presence of low-quality goods in a market will at least reduce the number of 
high-quality goods in the market and may even eliminate them. Second, buyers and 
sellers will respond to the lemons problem by investing in information and other means 
A p p l i c a t i o n  1
Are Baseball Pitchers Like Used Cars?
Applying the Concepts #1: What is adverse selection for buyers?
from injuries that prevent him from playing. In contrast, the new 
team has much less information. Its physicians can examine the 
pitcher, and the team can check league records to see how long 
the pitcher has spent on the disabled list, but these measures 
do not eliminate the asymmetric information. The original team 
has several years of daily experience with the pitcher and has 
better information about the pitcher’s physical health.
Now consider the incentives for a team to outbid another 
team for a pitcher. Suppose the market price for pitchers is 
$1 million per year, and a pitcher who is currently with the 
Detroit Tigers is offered this salary by another team. If the Tigers 
think the pitcher is likely to spend a lot of time next season 
recovering from injuries, they won’t try to outbid the other team 
for the pitcher: They will let the pitcher switch teams. But if the 
Tigers think the pitcher will be injury-free and productive, he 
will be worth more than $1 million to them, and they will outbid 
other teams and keep him. That’s why an injury-prone pitcher 
is more likely to switch teams. As in the used-car market, there 
are many “lemons” on the used-pitcher market. The market for 
baseball players playing other positions does not suffer from 
adverse selection, perhaps because the injuries that affect their 
performance are easier for other teams to detect.
Although you may think it’s bizarre to compare baseball 
pitchers to used cars, people in baseball don’t think so. They rec-
ognize the similarity between the two markets. Jackie Moore, who 
managed a free-agent camp where teams looking for players can 
see free agents in action, sounded like a used-car salesman: “We 
want to get players off the lot. We want to cut a deal. How many 
camps can you go into where you can look at a player and take 
him home with you?”  Related to Exercises 1.7, 1.8, and 1.16.
SOURCES: Based on Kenneth Lehn, “Information Asymmetries in Baseball’s Free 
Agent Market,” Economic Inquiry 22 (January 1984), pp. 37–44; Associated Press, 
“Free Agents at End of Baseball’s Earth,” Corvallis Gazette-Times, April 15, 1995.
Professional baseball teams compete with each other for play-
ers. After 6 years of play in the major leagues, a player has the 
option of becoming a free agent and offering his services to the 
highest bidder. A player is likely to switch teams if the new team 
offers him a higher salary than his original team. A puzzling fea-
ture of the free-agent market is that pitchers who switch teams 
are more prone to injuries than pitchers who don’t. On average, 
pitchers who switch teams spend 28 days per season on the 
disabled list, compared to only 5 days for pitchers who do not 
switch teams. This doesn’t mean that all the switching pitchers 
are lemons; many are injury-free and are valuable additions to 
their new teams. But on average, switching pitchers spend five 
times longer recovering from injuries.
This puzzling feature of the free-agent market is explained 
by asymmetric information and adverse selection. Because 
the coaches, physicians, and trainers from the player’s original 
team have interacted with the player on a daily basis for several 
years, they know from experience whether he is likely to suffer

of distinguishing between low-quality and high-quality goods. What is the evidence 
for the lemons model?
Studies of the market for used pickup trucks have provided mixed results concern-
ing the lemons problem.3 It appears that for trucks less than 10 years old, those sold 
on the market are just as reliable, on average, as those that remain with their current 
owners. These studies provide support for the second implication of the theory of 
lemons, that people acquire information and develop effective means to deal with 
the problem of asymmetric information. In contrast, there does seem to be a lemons 
problem for trucks at least 10 years old, which represent about one-third of transac-
tions. Compared to old trucks that remain with their current owners, old trucks that 
are sold have significantly higher repair costs, with a difference in cost of about 45 
percent. Old trucks that are sold have a much higher probability of requiring engine 
and transmission repairs.
Responding to the Lemons Problem
In a market with asymmetric information, there are strong incentives for buyers and 
sellers to solve the lemons problem. In our example of a thin market, the price of a 
used car is $2,500, but consumers are willing to pay $4,000 for a plum. This $1,500 gap 
between the willingness to pay for a plum and the price in the mixed market provides 
an opportunity for mutually beneficial exchange. A person who owns a high-quality car 
may not be willing to sell it for $2,500, but might accept something closer to $4,000, 
an amount a buyer is willing to pay. The challenge is to identify a high-quality car in 
the mixed market.
Buyers Invest in Information
In our model of the thin market, one in four buyers pays $2,500 to get a plum worth 
$4,000. The more information a buyer has, the greater the chance of picking a plum 
from the cars in the mixed market. Suppose a buyer gets enough information to identify 
the plums in a market. The buyer could purchase a plum worth $4,000 at the prevailing 
price of $2,500, generating a gain of $1,500. A buyer can get information about indi-
vidual cars by taking the car to a mechanic for a careful inspection. In addition, a buyer 
can get general information about the reliability of different models from magazines 
and the Internet. Consumer Reports publishes information on repair histories of different 
models and computes a “Trouble” index, scoring each model on a scale of 1 to 5. By 
consulting these information sources, a buyer improves the chances of getting a high-
quality car. Another information source is Carfax.com, which provides information on 
individual cars, including their accident histories.
Consumer Satisfaction Scores from ValueStar and eBay
The problem of asymmetric information in consumer goods such as cars also occurs 
for some types of consumer services. Most consumers can’t easily determine the qual-
ity of service they will receive from an auto repair shop, a landscaper, or a plumber. 
How can a high-quality service provider distinguish itself from low-quality providers?
Some organizations provide information about firms that provide consumers ser-
vices such as landscaping, auto repair, and home improvement. ValueStar is a consumer 
guide and business directory that uses customer satisfaction surveys to determine how 
well a firm does relative to its competitors in providing quality service. To earn the 
right to display a Customer-Rated seal from ValueStar, a firm must prove that it has 
all the required licenses and insurance and must agree to pay for a survey of its past 
customers. ValueStar uses consumer surveys to compute a consumer-satisfaction score 
for each company. Any company receiving a score of at least 85 out of 100 has the 
right to display a Customer-Rated Gold seal for a 1-year period. In New York City, 
servicemagic.com rates all kinds of contractors and household service providers, with 
scores based on reports from consumers.

Online consumers help each other by rating online sellers. On eBay, buyers must 
rely on sellers to honestly disclose the quality of the goods they are auctioning and to 
promptly ship them once a consumer pays. Buyers help other purchasers distinguish 
“good” from “bad” sellers on eBay by rating them online with “stars,” indicating their 
satisfaction with their transactions. The same sort of information is provided by people 
who buy secondhand books.
Guarantees and Lemons Laws
Used-car sellers also have an incentive to solve the lemons problem. If a plum owner 
persuades a buyer that his or her car is a plum and then sells the car for $4,000 rather 
than $2,500, the seller’s gain is $1,500. Sellers can identify a car as a plum in a sea of 
lemons by offering one of the following guarantees:
• Money-back guarantees. The seller could promise to refund the $4,000 price if 
the car turns out to be a lemon. Because the car is in fact a plum—a fact known 
by the seller—the buyer will not ask for a refund, so both the buyer and the seller 
will be happy with the transaction.
• Warranties and repair guarantees. The seller could promise to cover any 
extraordinary repair costs for 1 year. Because the car is a plum, there won’t be 
any extraordinary costs, so both the buyer and the seller will be happy with the 
transaction.
Many states have laws that require automakers to buy back cars that experience 
frequent problems in the first year of use. For example, under California’s Song-
Beverly Consumer Warranty Act, also known as the “Lemons Law,” auto dealers 
are required to repurchase vehicles that have been brought back for repair at least

producers. On average, the sugar content at the time of har-
vest was below the industry standard, established by kiwifruit 
from New Zealand. Given the large number of “lemons” among 
­California kiwifruit, grocery stores were not willing to pay as 
much for California fruit. In other words, the presence of low-
quality (immature) fruit in the mixed market pulled down the price 
of California fruit. Mature kiwifruit is more costly to produce than 
immature fruit, and the low price decreased the production of 
mature fruit. This result is similar to the way low used-car prices 
decrease the number of high-quality used cars on the market. In 
general, adverse selection led to low prices and a relatively large 
volume of low-quality kiwifruit from California.
In 1987, California producers implemented a federal mar-
keting order to address the lemon–kiwi problem. The federal 
order specified a minimum maturity standard, and as the aver-
age quality of California fruit increased, so did the price. Within 
a few years, the gap between California and New Zealand prices 
had decreased significantly.  Related to Exercises 2.3 and 2.6.
SOURCE: Based on Christopher Ferguson and Hoy Carman, “Kiwifruit and the 
‘Lemon’ Problem: Do Minimum Quality Standards Work?” (Working Paper, Inter-
national Food and Agribusiness Management Association, 1999).
Kiwifruit is subject to imperfect information because buyers 
cannot determine its sweetness—its quality level—by simple 
inspection. The sweetness level at the time of consumption is 
determined by the fruit’s maturity—its sugar content at the time 
of harvest. Kiwifruit continues to convert starch into sugar after 
it is picked, but fruit that is picked early has a low sugar content 
at harvest time and never tastes sweet. There is asymmetric 
information because producers know the maturity of the fruit, 
but fruit wholesalers and grocery stores, who buy fruit at the 
time of harvest, cannot determine whether a piece of fruit will 
ultimately be sweet or sour.
Before 1987, kiwifruit from California suffered from the 
“lemons” problem. Maturity levels of the fruit varied across

four times for the same problem or have been in the mechanic’s shop for at least 30 
calendar days in the first year following purchase. A vehicle repurchased under the 
Lemons Law must be fixed before it is sold to another customer and must be identi-
fied as a lemon with a stamp on the title and a sticker on the car that says “Lemons 
Law buyback.” One problem with enforcing these laws is that lemons can cross state 
lines without a paper trail. The interstate commerce in lemons has led to new laws in 
some states requiring the branding of lemons on vehicle titles to follow the car when 
it crosses state lines.
Adverse Selection for Sellers: Insurance
So far, we have explored the effects of asymmetric information when sellers are more 
knowledgeable than buyers. The same sorts of problems occur when buyers are more 
knowledgeable than sellers. The best example of superior knowledge on the demand 
side of the market is insurance. A person who buys an insurance policy knows much 
more about his or her risks and needs for insurance than the insurance company knows. 
For example, when you buy an auto insurance policy, you know more than your insur-
ance company about your driving habits and your chances of getting into an accident. 
We’ll see that insurance markets suffer from the adverse-selection problem: Insurance 
companies get an adverse or undesirable selection of customers.
Health Insurance
To illustrate the information problems in the market for insurance, consider health 
insurance provided to individual consumers. Suppose there are two types of consumers: 
low-cost consumers with relatively low medical expenses of $2,000 per year and high-
cost consumers with relatively high medical expenses of $6,000 per year. The amount 
a consumer is willing to pay for an insurance policy covering all medical expenses 
increases with the anticipated medical expenses, so high-cost people are willing to pay 
more for health insurance.
The insurance company cannot distinguish between high-cost and low-cost people, 
but it still must pick a price for its coverage. To simplify matters, let’s assume there are 
no administrative costs, so the only cost for the insurance company is the medical bills 
it pays for its customers. Let’s also assume the insurance company sets the price equal 
to its average cost per customer, equal to the total medical bills paid by the insurance 
company divided by the number of customers. These assumptions simplify the math 
without affecting the basic results.
What is the insurance company’s average cost per customer? To determine the 
average cost in a mixed market, we must answer three questions:
• What is the cost of providing medical care to a high-cost person?
• What is the cost of providing medical care to a low-cost person?
• What fraction of the customers are low-cost people?
Suppose that half the population is high cost and the other half is low cost. Let’s 
assume the insurance company is somewhat naive and initially assumes that the mix of 
insurance buyers will be the same as the population mix. In other words, the insurance 
company initially assumes that half its customers will be high cost and half will be low 
cost. In this case, the average cost per customer is $4,000, that is, the average of $2,000 
for each low-cost customer and $6,000 for each high-cost customer.
There is asymmetric information in the insurance market because potential buyers 
know from everyday experience and family histories what type of customer they are, either 
low cost or high cost. For each person, the question is “Given the single market price 
for all insurance, for low-cost and high-cost people alike, should I buy insurance?” The 
answers to this question are shown in two demand curves in Figure 29.3. The demand 
curve for the high-cost people is higher than the curve for the low-cost people, reflecting 
their larger benefits from having medical insurance.

Equilibrium with All High-Cost Consumers
Table 29.3 shows two scenarios for our hypothetical insurance market, with num-
bers based on the demand curves shown in Figure 29.3. In the first column, firms 
initially assume a 50–50 mix of customers. As we saw earlier, if sellers expect a 50–50 
split between the two types, the average cost per customer is $4,000, and that’s the 
price they charge for medical insurance. From the demand curves in Figure 29.3, we 
know that at this price 25 low-cost people will buy insurance (point a), along with 75 
high-cost people (point b). In this case, insurance companies are too optimistic and 
underestimate the fraction of customers with large medical bills. The actual fraction of 
▲  Figure 29.3  All Insurance Customers Are High-Cost People
If insurance companies assume there will be a 50–50 split between high-cost and low-cost customers, 
the average cost of insurance and its price is $4,000. At this price, there are 25 low-cost customers 
(point a) and 75 high-cost customers (point b). This is not an equilibrium because 75 percent of insurance 
buyers are high-cost customers, contrary to the expectations of a 50–50 split. If insurance companies 
become pessimistic and assume that all buyers will be high-cost consumers, the average cost and price 
is $6,000. The insurance company’s expectations are realized, so the equilibrium is shown by point c.

high-cost customers is 75 percent, and the actual average cost is $5,000 (equal to 0.25 
times $2,000, plus 0.75 times $6,000). The company’s average cost of $5,000 exceeds 
its price of $4,000, so the firm will lose money.
Suppose that after observing the outcome in the first column, insurance companies 
become very pessimistic. They assume that all their customers will be high-cost people. 
Under this assumption, the average cost per customer is $6,000, the average cost per 
high-cost customer, and that’s the pessimistic price. As shown in Figure 29.3, this price 
exceeds the maximum that low-cost people are willing to pay for insurance ($5,200), 
so none of the low-cost consumers will buy insurance at this price. But a total of 40 
high-cost consumers will buy insurance at this price (point c). In other words, all the 
customers will be high-cost people, so the company’s pessimism is justified. The price 
chosen by the insurance company equals the actual average cost of providing service, 
so the equilibrium is shown by point c, with an equilibrium price of $6,000. This equi-
librium is shown in the second column of Table 29.3.
The domination of the insurance market by high-cost people is another example of 
the adverse-selection problem. The uninformed side of the market (sellers in this case) 
must choose from an undesirable or adverse selection of consumers. The asymmetric 
information in the market generates an upward spiral of price and average cost of service:
• The presence of high-cost consumers in the market pulls up the average cost of 
service, pulling up the price.
• The increase in price decreases the number of low-cost consumers who purchase 
insurance.
• This decrease in the number of low-cost consumers pulls up the average cost of 
insurance.
• In the extreme case, the upward spiral continues until all insurance customers 
are high-cost people.
Our example of health insurance indicates that only high-cost people buy insur-
ance. A more realistic outcome is a thin market, with a relatively small number of 
low-cost people buying insurance. The adverse-selection problem could be less severe, 
but it will still be present as long as insurance companies cannot distinguish perfectly 
between low-cost and high-cost people.
Responding to Adverse Selection in Insurance: Group Insurance
Insurance companies use group insurance plans to diminish the adverse-selection prob-
lem. By enrolling all the employees of an organization in one or two insurance plans, 
they ensure that all workers, not just high-cost people, join the pool of consumers.
In our example, group insurance would generate a 50–50 mix of low-cost and 
high-cost customers, and the break-even price would be $6,000. In contrast, when a 
firm sells insurance to individuals, the low-cost people have an incentive to go without 
insurance, leading to the adverse-selection problem and higher prices.
Most insurance companies use experience rating to set their prices for group 
insurance. They charge different prices to different firms, depending on the past medi-
cal bills of the firm’s employees. A firm whose employees have low medical bills pays a 
low price for its employees’ health insurance. Experience rating gives firms an incentive 
to decrease the health costs of their workers by investing in safety and health programs 
for them. Firms also have an incentive to avoid hiring applicants with health problems. 
Under experience rating, a firm that hires a worker with above-average medical costs 
will ultimately pay a higher price for its group insurance.
The Uninsured
One implication of asymmetric information in the insurance market is that many low-
cost consumers who are not eligible for a group plan will not carry insurance. Given the 
adverse-selection problem, the price for an individual insurance plan is relatively high, and 
experience rating
A situation in which insurance companies 
charge different prices for medical insur-
ance to different firms depending on the 
past medical bills of a firm’s employees.

many consumers go without insurance. This is a contributing factor to the problem of the 
uninsured. In 2008, about 47 million people (about 14 percent of the U.S. population) were 
not covered by health insurance. About 70 percent of working-age people have private 
insurance, and another 10 percent have some sort of government insurance, leaving 20 per-
cent without health insurance. In general, the uninsured are the people and their families 
who do not receive insurance through their employers, are unemployed or between jobs, 
or are poor but do not qualify for Medicaid. The uninsured obtain care for medical emer-
gencies but typically do not receive routine—and ultimately less costly—preventive care.
In 2010 the U.S. Congress approved legislation to regulate the nation’s health 
insurance markets and reduce the number of uninsured people. The new law will pre-
vent insurance companies from denying coverage based on preexisting conditions and 
outlaws lifetime caps on reimbursement. In addition, the law requires individuals to get 
health insurance, and imposes penalties on people who remain uncovered. Other provi-
sions impose penalties on employers that do not provide insurance to their employees. 
For small businesses and low-income individuals, the law provides subsidies and tax 
credits to partly offset the cost of insurance. The law is expected to significantly reduce 
the number of uninsured citizens.
Other Types of Insurance
The same logic of adverse selection applies to the markets for other types of insurance, 
including life insurance, home insurance for theft and property damage, and automobile 
insurance. Buyers know more than sellers about their risks, so there is adverse selec-
tion, with high-risk individuals more likely to buy insurance. Life insurance companies 
provide group coverage to get a broader base of consumers and also try to distinguish 
between high-risk and low-risk people with physical exams. However, because the com-
panies are unable to distinguish between high-risk and low-risk people with sufficient 
precision, the adverse-selection problem persists.

Genetic Discrimination

that increases the risk of an inherited disorder. At the national 
level, the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) is 
designed to protect people from genetic discrimination. Title I 
of GINA prohibits genetic discrimination in health insurance. It 
is illegal for health insurance providers to use genetic informa-
tion in making decisions about a person’s insurance eligibility 
or coverage. GINA does not apply when an employer has fewer 
than 15 employees. GINA also does not protect against genetic 
discrimination in the provision of life insurance.
What are the implications of genetic testing for adverse selec-
tion in the market for health insurance? The information from 
genetic testing could help insurance companies estimate the likely 
cost of health insurance for each customer. This new informa-
tion would increase insurance prices for high-cost customers and 
decrease prices for low-cost customers, and reduce the adverse-
selection problem. A ban on genetic discrimination prevents these 
sorts of price changes.  Related to Exercise 3.3 and 3.4.

Insurance and Moral Hazard
Does insurance affect people’s risk-taking behavior? The answer is yes. Insurance 
causes people to take greater risks because they know part of the cost of an undesirable 
outcome will be borne by their insurance companies. Here are some examples of people 
taking greater risks because they have insurance:
• Will Irma buy a fire extinguisher for her kitchen? If she had to pay for any 
property damage caused by a fire, she would definitely buy a fire extinguisher. 
But because her homeowner’s insurance covers property damage from fires, she 
doesn’t buy a fire extinguisher.
• Will Harry drive his car carefully? If he had to pay for all repairs resulting from 
a collision out of his own pocket, he would drive very carefully. But because his 
auto insurance covers some of the repair costs, he drives fast and recklessly.
• Will Flo fly on a commercial airline or hitch a ride with her pilot friend in a 
four-seat airplane? Traveling in small airplanes is much riskier. If Flo dies in an 
airplane crash, her family will lose the income she would otherwise earn. If she 
didn’t have life insurance to offset these income losses, she would be less likely 
to risk harming her family by flying on the small plane instead of the commercial 
airline. But because she knows her family will collect $1 million in life insurance, 
she is willing to take the risk.
The risky behavior triggered by insurance is an example of the moral-hazard prob-
lem. Moral hazard occurs when one side of an economic relationship takes undesirable 
or costly actions that the other side of the relationship cannot observe. For example, 
Irma’s insurance company doesn’t know whether she has a fire extinguisher. If there is 
a fire, Irma’s hidden action—going without an extinguisher—is costly for the insurance 
company. Similarly, Harry’s insurance company doesn’t know how fast and recklessly 
he drives, and insurance encourages him to drive recklessly. His hidden action of reck-
less driving increases the likelihood of a costly accident. Just as collision insurance 
encourages risky driving, life insurance encourages risky activities such as flying small 
airplanes, parachuting, and bungee jumping. Similarly, health insurance encourages 
risky behavior such as smoking, drinking, and unhealthy diets.
Insurance Companies and Moral Hazard
Insurance companies use various measures to decrease the moral-hazard problem. 
Many insurance policies have a deductible—a dollar amount that a policyholder must 
pay before getting compensation from the insurance company. For example, if your 
car insurance policy has a $500 deductible and the damage from a collision is $900, the 
insurance company will pay you only $400. You pay the other $500 as your deductible. 
Deductibles reduce the moral-hazard problem because they shift to the policyholder part 
of the cost of a claim on the policy. Like a deductible, an insurance copayment shifts part 
of the cost of risky behavior to policyholders and thus reduces the moral-hazard problem.
Savvy insurance companies anticipate moral hazard. To illustrate, suppose 1 of 
10 bicycles on your campus was stolen in 2008. If you decide to be the first to offer 
bicycle theft insurance, you might naively assume that the theft rate wouldn’t change. 
But the moral-hazard problem tells us that people with insurance take greater risks, so 
we’d expect a higher theft rate on a campus where insurance is widespread. Students 
who buy theft insurance are likely to be less careful in protecting their bikes, perhaps 
using flimsy locks or no locks at all. Or they might start leaving their bikes on campus 
overnight. A savvy insurance company would assume a theft rate higher than 10 percent 
and set its price accordingly.
Deposit Insurance for Savings and Loans
For another example of moral hazard, consider the insurance provided for bank 
­deposits. When you deposit money in a savings and loan (S&L), the money doesn’t

just sit in a vault. The S&L will invest the money, loaning it out and expecting to make 
a profit when loans are repaid with interest. Unfortunately, some loans are not repaid, 
and the S&L could lose money and be unable to return your money. To protect people 
who put their money in S&Ls and other banks, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corpo-
ration (FDIC) insures the first $250,000 of your deposit, so if the S&L goes bankrupt, 
you’ll still get your money back. The government enacted the federal deposit insurance 
law in 1933 in response to the bank failures of the Great Depression.
How does deposit insurance affect you and the people who manage the S&L? If 
you know you’ll get your money back no matter what happens to the S&L, you may 
deposit your money there without evaluating the performance of the S&L and the 
riskiness of its loans to borrowers and investments in the stock market. The manager 
of an S&L will also be more likely to make risky investments knowing that if it doesn’t 
pay off and the S&L goes bankrupt, the federal government will reimburse deposi-
tors. Recognizing this moral-hazard problem, the federal government has historically 
limited S&Ls to relatively safe investments.
In the 1980s, the federal government loosened some of the investment restrictions 
on S&Ls, and S&L managers began investing in volatile securities, including high-risk 
commercial mortgages and junk bonds. When these risky investments failed, many of 
the S&Ls went into bankruptcy. The government then bailed out the failed S&Ls, at 
a total cost to taxpayers of about $200 billion.
The Economics of Consumer Search
Suppose the price of a particular television model varies from one store to another. If 
you don’t know which store has the lowest price, should you keep shopping until you 
find it? The short answer is “no.” Searching is costly because it takes time to visit a 
store, make a phone call, or visit a Web site. We can apply the marginal principle to 
the problem of searching for low prices. It will be sensible to continue searching if the 
marginal benefit of search (the expected savings from finding a lower price) exceeds the 
marginal cost (the time cost). In most cases, it will be rational to stop shopping before 
you find the lowest possible price.

Car Insurance and Risky Driving
Applying the Concepts #4: What is moral hazard in car insurance?
moral-hazard cost of automobile insurance is substantial. When 
a state makes car insurance compulsory and thus decreases 
the number of uninsured drivers, roads become more hazard-
ous: The number of collisions and the number of traffic deaths 
increase. Roads become more dangerous because the newly 
insured drivers drive less cautiously. The study estimates that a 
one percentage point decrease in the share of uninsured drivers 
increases the number of traffic fatalities by 2 percent. Of course, 
there are benefits associated with compulsory insurance, but 
in the interests of efficiency, we must compare the benefits to 
the costs, including the increase in fatalities on more hazardous 
roads.  Related to Exercises 4.5 and 4.11.

Search and the Marginal Principle
We can illustrate the economics of search with a simple example. Suppose the price 
of a television ranges from $100 at the lowest-price store to $180 at the highest-
price store. In addition, suppose that for a randomly selected store, any price from 
the low price to the high price is equally likely. Let’s assume that the opportunity 
cost of the time required to visit a store—the marginal cost of search—is constant 
at $0.90 per visit.
The marginal benefit of search depends on your discovered price—the lowest 
price you have found so far in your search. The first column in Table 29.4 shows how 
to compute the marginal benefit of another visit when the discovered price is $140. A 
price of $140 is at the 50th percentile of the price range of the television (from $100 
to $180). In other words, half the stores have lower prices (from $100 to $139), and 
half have higher prices (from $141 to $180). We compute the marginal benefit of an 
additional visit as follows:
• Row 2: If you visit one more store, the probability of finding a lower price is 0.50. 
You have a 50–50 chance of finding a lower price.
• Row 3: If you actually find a lower price, it will be between the low price of 
$100 and your discovered price of $140. The best guess for a lower price is the 
midpoint of this range, or $120.
• Row 4: The best guess for the savings from a lower price is the gap between the 
discovered price ($140) and the lower price ($120), or $20.
• Row 5: The probability of finding a lower price is 0.50, so your expected savings 
from visiting another store is $10 (equal to the anticipated $20 price gap times 
0.50). You have a 50–50 chance of saving $20, so on average a visit to another 
store will generate a $10 savings.
To summarize, the marginal benefit of search is $10, which exceeds the $0.90 mar-
ginal cost. Therefore, if your discovered price is $140, it is sensible to visit one 
more store.
discovered price
The lowest price observed so far in a 
search process.
As shown in the second column of Table 29.4, if the discovered price is $120, 
the marginal benefit of another visit is only $2.50. This is lower than the mar-
ginal benefit shown in column 1 (discovered price = $140) for two reasons. First, 
a discovered price of $120 is in the 25th percentile of the price range of $100 to 
$180 (only one-fourth of stores have lower prices), so the probability of finding a 
lower price is only 0.25. Second, if you actually find a lower price, the savings will 
be smaller because you start with a lower discovered price. A lower price will be 
between $100 and $120, so your best guess of a lower price is $110 (the middle of 
the range) and your best guess of the savings from a lower price is only $10 (equal 
to $120 - $110). Multiplying the probability of finding a lower price (0.25) by the 
$10 price gap, the expected savings is $2.50. This marginal benefit still exceeds the 
$0.90 marginal cost, so it is sensible to visit an additional store to try to improve on 
your discovered price of $120.
As shown in the third column of Table 29.4, if the discovered price is only $110, 
visiting an additional store is not sensible. In this case, only one in eight stores has 
lower prices, meaning that the probability of finding a lower price at the store you visit

is only 0.125. In addition, your best guess of a lower price is $105 (the middle of the 
range from $100 to $110), and your savings from a lower price is only $5. The expected 
savings from an additional visit is only $0.625 (equal to 0.125 times $5), which is less 
than the $0.90 marginal cost. In this case, the cost of an additional visit exceeds the 
expected benefit, so it is best to pay your discovered price of $110 rather than continu-
ing to search for a lower price.
Figure 29.4 illustrates the application of the marginal principle to the search 
process. The horizontal axis shows the discovered price, and the vertical axis shows 
the marginal benefit and marginal cost. As we saw in Table 29.4, the higher the dis-
covered price, the larger the marginal benefit of additional search, so the marginal-
benefit curve is positively sloped. For example, the marginal benefit is $2.50 for a 
discovered price of $120 (point b), compared to $10 for a discovered price of $140 
(point a). If the marginal cost is constant at $0.90 per visit (per unit of search), the 
marginal-cost curve is horizontal. If the discovered price is less than $112 (for exam-
ple, $110), the marginal benefit is less than the marginal cost, and it is not sensible 
to search for a lower price.
▲  Figure 29.4  Marginal Benefit and Marginal Cost of Search
The marginal benefit of search increases with the discovered price (the lowest price found so far), while 
the marginal cost of search is constant. If at a particular discovered price the marginal benefit exceeds the 
marginal cost, it is sensible to continue searching for a low price. The reservation price, defined as the 
price where the marginal benefit of search equals the marginal cost, is $112 (shown by point c).

Reservation Prices and Searching Strategy
A consumer’s reservation price is defined as the discovered price at which the con-
sumer is indifferent about additional search. If the discovered price exceeds the reserva-
tion price, additional searching is sensible, but if the discovered price is lower, additional 
searching is irrational. In Table 29.4, the reservation price is computed as $112.

ferent about additional search for a lower

• The probability of finding a lower price is 0.15 (a price of $112 is in the 15th 
percentile of the price range $100 to $180).
• The best guess of a lower price is $106 (the midpoint of the range $100 to $112).
• The marginal benefit (the expected savings over the discovered price) is $0.90, 
equal to 0.15 times $6.
The marginal benefit equals the marginal cost, so the consumer is indifferent about 
additional search. In Figure 29.4 the reservation price is shown by the intersection of 
the marginal-cost curve and the marginal-benefit curve at point c.
The reservation price provides consumers with a convenient rule for when to stop 
searching for a lower price. The consumer should continue to search until the discovered 
price (the lowest price found) is less than or equal to the reservation price. Some con-
sumers will get lucky and discover a price below their reservation prices with just a little 
bit of searching, while others will take longer. But a consumer who knows the range of 
prices from lowest to highest can compute a reservation price before starting the search, 
and then search until the discovered price is less than or equal to the reservation price.
Figure 29.5 provides two examples of price searches that stop when the discovered 
price drops below the reservation price. The dots show one sequence of observed 
prices, starting at $174, followed by $175, then $165, and so on to $110 after 10 visits. 
The solid line connects the discovered prices—the lowest price observed over the 
course of the search. The dots above the line are the observed prices that, at the time 
they were observed, exceeded the discovered price. The discovered price finally drops 
below the reservation price in the 10th visit. The triangles show a second sequence of

$107. The second (diamond) sequence is half as long as the first because the discovered 
price drops below the reservation price in the fifth visit.
The Effects of Opportunity Cost and Product Prices on Search Effort
Reservation prices and search efforts vary across consumers. A consumer with a rela-
tively high opportunity cost of search time will have a higher marginal cost of search 
and will naturally spend less time searching for lower prices. In Figure 29.4 an increase 
in the marginal cost of search will shift the marginal-cost curve upward, increasing the 
reservation price. For example, if the cost per visit were $2.50 instead of $0.90, the 
reservation price would be $120 rather than $112. The higher the reservation price, 
the less time it will take, on average, to discover a price below the reservation price. 
Therefore, a consumer with a high opportunity cost of search won’t spend as much 
time searching for low prices.
The amount of searching for low prices also depends on the price of the product. 
The higher the price, the bigger the payoff from discovering a price that is, say, 2 per-
cent lower. For example, if an additional visit to a car dealer could save you 2 percent 
on a $10,000 car ($200), an additional visit will be sensible if your opportunity cost is 
less than $200. In contrast, if additional searching might save you 2 percent on a $10 
pizza ($0.20), it is not sensible to continue searching unless your opportunity cost is 
less than $0.20. In general, the higher the price of a product, the greater the incentive 
to search for a lower price.
The amount of searching also depends on the range of prices, from lowest to high-
est. The smaller the gap between the low and high price, the smaller the possible sav-
ings from additional search. In our example, suppose the price range for the television 
is only $139 to $141, and suppose your discovered price is $140 (the average price). As 
before, there is a 50–50 chance that an additional visit will generate a lower price. But 
at most you’ll save only $1, and your best guess for a lower price is $139.50 (the middle 
of the range $139 to $140). Given the relatively small anticipated savings, additional 
search will be rational only if your marginal cost is very low ($0.25). In general, the 
smaller the price range for a product, the less time consumers will spend searching for 
lower prices.

on income because 1 hour of search means 1 less hour available 
for earning income. The study examines search behavior for liq-
uid detergents, and shows that a doubling of income increases 
the cost of search and decreases the amount of searching by 
about 14 percent. In addition, consumer search on workdays is 
more costly and thus less extensive than on weekends. Related 
to Exercise 5.6.

In this chapter, we’ve seen 
what happens when one of the 
assumptions underlying most 
supply and demand analysis—
that people make informed 
decisions—is violated. If either 
buyers or sellers don’t have reli-
able information about a partic-
ular good or service, the market 
will suffer from the adverse-selection problem. The uninformed side 
picks from an adverse selection of goods or customers. Here are 
the main points of the chapter:
1.	 The adverse-selection problem occurs when one side of the 
market cannot distinguish between high-quality and low-quality 
goods. The presence of low-quality goods pulls down the price 
that buyers are willing to pay, which decreases the quantity of 
high-quality goods supplied, which further decreases the average 
quality and the price. In the extreme case, only low-quality goods 
are sold.
2.	 A thin market occurs when the sellers of high-quality goods 
have a relatively low minimum supply price, so some high-quality 
goods are sold.
3.	 In a market subject to asymmetric information, buyers have an 
incentive to invest in information to help make better choices and 
sellers have an incentive to provide quality guarantees.
4.	 Insurance markets suffer from adverse selection because com-
pared to insurance sellers, buyers have better information about 
the risks they face.
5.	 Insurance encourages risky behavior because part of the cost of 
an unfavorable outcome will be paid by an insurance company.
6.	 Searching for low prices is costly, and a rational consumer is 
likely to stop searching for low prices before finding the lowest 
possible price.

1.4	 We will have a thin market for used cars if the mini-
mum supply price for plums (high quality) is 
 
(greater than/less than) the willingness to pay for a 
lemon.
1.5	 Arrows up or down: A decrease in the minimum supply 
price for a plum (high quality) shifts the plum supply 
curve 
 and the likelihood of buying a plum 
.
1.6	 Suppose you are willing to pay $2,000 for a low-quality 
used car and $10,000 for a high-quality used car. If 
there is a 70 percent chance of getting a low-quality car 
and a 30 percent chance of getting a high-quality car, 
you are willing to pay 
 for a used car.
1.7	 In baseball, a puzzling feature of the free-agent market is 
that pitchers who switch teams are more prone to inju-
ries than pitchers who don’t. This feature is explained 
by 
 and 
. The new team has 
 (more/less) information because it has inter-
acted 
 (more/less) with the player to know 
whether he is likely to suffer from injuries that prevent 
him from playing. (Related to Application 1 on page 645.)
1.8	 Suppose the market price for pitchers is $1 million per 
year. A pitcher who is currently in one team is offered 
this salary by another team and chooses to leave. Under 
what circumstances will the pitcher’s current team try 
to outbid the other team? (Related to Application 1 on 
page 645.)
1.9	 Consumer Reports. You want to buy a used car, spe-
cifically a 1999 Zephyr. According to Consumer Reports, 
half the 1999 Zephyrs now on the road are lemons, 
meaning they break down frequently and generate 
large repair bills. Consumers are willing to pay $2,000 
for a lemon, but $5,000 for a plum. According to Ms. 
Wizard, “The equilibrium price of used 1999 Zephyrs 
will be $2,000 in Sourland but $2,600 in Sweetland.”
a.	 Illustrate with a complete graph for each market.
b.	What is the fundamental difference between the two 
markets?
1.10	 Fashion and Prices. You are in the market for a used 
car and have narrowed your options to two types of cars, 
type F and type P. According to Consumer Reports, the 
two types of cars have roughly the same frequency of 
lemons (50 percent). Like other consumers, you are will-
ing to pay $1,000 for a lemon and $7,000 for a plum. The 
people who buy new F cars are fashion-conscious and 
purchase a new car every 3 years. The people who buy 
new P cars are insensitive to the whims of fashion. Predict 
the equilibrium prices of the two types of cars and defend 
your answer with two graphs, one for each type of car.
1.11	 Double Ignorance. Suppose both buyers and sellers of 
used cars are ignorant: No one can distinguish between 
lemons and plums. Would you expect the market to 
be dominated by lemons? Illustrate with a completely 
labeled graph.
1.12	 Groucho Club. Consider a classic quip from Groucho 
Marx: “I won’t join any club that is willing to accept me 
as a member.” Suppose Groucho wants to associate with 
high-income people (the higher the income the better) 
and everyone else has the same preferences as Groucho.
a.	 Use the notion of adverse selection to explain this quip.
b.	Relate the quip to the adverse-selection problem.
1.13	 Purchasing a Fleet of Used Cars. You are responsible 
for buying a fleet of 10 used cars for your employees 
and must pick either brand B or brand C. For your pur-
poses, the two brands are identical except for one dif-
ference: Based on your experience with the two brands, 
you figure that 50 percent of B cars in the market are 
lemons and only 20 percent of C cars in the market 
are lemons. You are willing to pay $1,000 for a known 
lemon and $3,000 for a known plum. If the price of B 
cars is $1,800 and the price of C cars is $2,200, which 
brand of car should you pick?
1.14	 Adverse Selection of Laptops. Consider the market 
for used laptops, with knowledgeable sellers and igno-
rant buyers. Half the laptops in existence are plums and 
half are lemons. Each buyer is willing to pay $800 for a 
plum and $400 for a lemon. The minimum supply price 
for a plum is $200 and the minimum supply price for a 
lemon is $50.
a.	 In equilibrium, will the market be “thin” or will all 
the used laptops in the market be lemons? Explain 
and illustrate your answer with a complete graph.
b.	Suppose that at a price of $500, the quantity of 
plums is 40 and the quantity of lemons is 60. Is this 
an equilibrium? Explain and illustrate your answer 
with a complete graph.
1.15	 Mix of Lemons and Plums in the Month-Old Car 
Market. Suppose the value of a high-quality month-
old car (a plum) is $30,000 (the same as the purchase 
price of a new car), while the value of a low-quality 
month-old car (a lemon) is $15,000. Suppose that at a 
price of $20,000 per car, 5 of 8 cars on the used market 
are plums and 3 of 8 are lemons.
a.	 How much is the typical buyer willing to pay for a 
used car in the mixed market?
b.	Is the $20,000 price an equilibrium price? Why or 
why not?
c.	 Suppose that for every 8 new cars sold by new-car 
dealers, 6 are plums and 2 are lemons. Why is the 
equilibrium mix in the used car market different 
from the mix of new cars sold?
1.16	 Willingness to Pay for Used Baseball Pitchers. Sup-
pose a healthy baseball pitcher is worth $5 million per 
year to his team, compared to only $1 million per year 
for an unhealthy pitcher. Suppose that half the pitch-
ers in the league are healthy, and half are unhealthy. 
According to an executive of a baseball team, “If my 
assumptions are correct, our team is willing to pay a 

660
maximum of $3 million for a pitcher in the free-agent 
market.” (Related to Application 1 on page 645.)
a.	 What are the executive’s assumptions?
b.	Are these assumptions realistic?
Responding to the Lemons Problem
Discuss the possible responses to adverse selection for 
buyers.
2.1	 Consider a thin used-car market. Someone just devel-
oped a device that can instantly identify the nearest 
plum in a used-car lot. The device works only once. 
The maximum amount that a consumer would be 
willing to pay for the device equals 
 minus 
.
2.2	 A money-back guarantee will be provided by the own-
ers of 
, but not by the owners of 
 
(lemons/plums).
2.3	 Arrows up or down: Government regulations for kiwi-
fruit 
 the average quality and 
 
the price of kiwifruit. (Related to Application 2 on 
page 647.)
2.4	 Paying for Information. You are willing to pay 
$10,000 for a high-quality car—a plum. The current 
price of used cars is $6,000, and 9 of 10 cars in the 
market are lemons, meaning that 1 of 10 is a plum.
a.	 Suppose you could pay a finder’s fee to a personal 
shopper/mechanic who will find you a plum at a 
price of $6,000. What is the maximum you are will-
ing to pay as a finder’s fee?
b.	As you shop for a used car, you will bring each car 
you consider to your mechanic, who will thoroughly 
inspect the car and tell you for certain whether it is a 
plum or a lemon. If the price per inspection is $200, 
is it worth the money?
c.	 How would your answer to part (b) change if only 
1 out of 5 used cars was a plum and the inspection 
cost was $400?
2.5	 Money-Back-Plus Guarantee. The equilibrium price 
in a thin market is $3,500. Suppose car dealers provide 
a special money-back-plus guarantee: A dissatisfied 
buyer can return a car for a refund plus $300.
a.	 If a lemon owner sells his or her car for $5,000, 
the owner’s gain from providing the guarantee is 
$
.
b.	If a plum owner sells his or her car for $5,000, 
the owner’s gain from providing the guarantee is 
$
.
2.6	 Equilibrium in the Kiwifruit Market. Consumers 
are willing to pay 10 cents for a sour kiwifruit and 30 
cents for a sweet kiwifruit. The minimum supply price 
for sour kiwifruit is 6 cents and the minimum supply 
price for sweet kiwifruit is 18 cents. The slope of each 
supply curve is 1 cent per thousand kiwifruit. (Related 
to Application 2 on page 647.)
a.	 Suppose consumers initially expect a 50–50 mix of 
sweet and sour kiwifruits. Is this an equilibrium? 
Illustrate with a graph.
b.	Suppose consumers are pessimistic, expecting all 
sour kiwifruit. Is this an equilibrium? Illustrate with 
a graph. What is the price of kiwifruit?
c.	 Suppose the state outlaws sour kiwifruit, and they 
disappear from the market. What happens to the 
equilibrium price of kiwifruit? What is the equilib-
rium quantity of sweet kiwifruit?
Adverse Selection for Sellers: Insurance
Explain the notion of adverse selection for sellers.
3.1	 Suppose the average annual penalty is $10,000 for 
reckless drivers and $1,000 for careful drivers. If half 
of an insurance company’s insured drivers are reck-
less, the company will earn zero economic profit if 
the price of insurance is $
. If careful driv-
ers are not willing to pay any more than $4,000 for 
insurance, the price required for zero economic profit 
is $
.
3.2	 Arrows up or down: In an insurance market, the pres-
ence of high-cost consumers 
 the average 
cost of providing insurance. The resulting 
 
in the number of low-cost consumers 
 the 
average cost of providing insurance and 
 
price.
3.3	 The Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act 
(GINA) protects people from genetic discrimination 
in 
 insurance, but not in 
 insur-
ance. (Related to Application 3 on page 651.)
3.4	 Genetic Testing and Insurance Prices. Suppose the 
likelihood that a person will get disease X is determined 
in large part (but not exclusively) by his or her genes. 
Initially, it is impossible to determine who carries the 
gene for the disease, and many people spend $500 on 
special health insurance to cover the costs of treatment 
for the disease. Suppose scientists uncover the gene 
responsible for the disease and develop a simple test 
for the gene. (Related to Application 3 on page 651.)
a.	 Suppose the government passes a law that prevents 
insurance companies from getting the results of a 
customer’s genetic test for X. Will the new price of 
X insurance be greater than or less than $500?
b.	Suppose insurance companies have access to the 
results of genetic tests and they require all custom-
ers to get the test. How will the insurance company 
change its price of X insurance?
3.5	 Rising Insurance Rates. Consider an insurance 
company that provides group medical coverage for 

661
university employees. The company discovered that 
some of its younger employees had switched to other 
insurance companies. The company responded to the 
loss of customers by increasing its price. This is puz-
zling because you might think the insurance company 
would drop its price to prevent other employees from 
switching to other companies.
a.	 What is the rationale for increasing the price?
b.	If you change one word in the second sentence, 
it would be logical for the insurance company to 
decrease rather than increase its price. What is the 
word, and why is it decisive?
3.6	 State Auto Insurance Pool. Consider a state in which 
automobile drivers are divided equally into two types 
of drivers: careful and reckless. The average annual 
auto insurance claim is $400 for a careful driver and 
$1,200 for a reckless driver. Suppose the state adopts 
an insurance system in which all drivers are placed in 
a common pool and allocated to insurance companies 
randomly. An insurance company cannot refuse cov-
erage to any driver it is assigned, but a driver who is 
unhappy with the insurance company has the option of 
being randomly reassigned to another insurance com-
pany. By law, each insurance company must charge the 
same price to all its customers. Predict the price of auto 
insurance under the two alternative policy scenarios:
a.	 Under Policy M, auto insurance is mandatory.
b.	Under Policy V, auto insurance is voluntary.
Insurance and Moral Hazard
Explain the notion of moral hazard.
4.1	 In the market for insurance, the moral-hazard problem 
is that 
 encourages 
.
4.2	 While shopping for office equipment, an office man-
ager sees a display of fire extinguishers. After making a 
single phone call, the manager decides not to buy a fire 
extinguisher. The manager had called her 
 
and asked, “
?”
4.3	 Many professional athletes purchase insurance against 
career-ending injuries. We expect the insured players 
to experience 
 (more/fewer) injuries than 
uninsured players.
4.4	 If the single firm providing bicycle theft insurance on 
campus disappears and is not replaced, we would expect 
bicycle theft rates on campus to 
.
4.5	 Car insurance increases traffic 
 because 
insured drivers 
. (Related to Application 4 
on page 653.)
4.6	 Selling iPod Insurance. On the campus of Klepto 
College, half the iPods are expensive (replacement 
value is $400) and half are cheap (replacement value is 
$100). There is a 20 percent chance that any particular 
iPod—expensive or cheap—will be stolen in the next 
year. Suppose a firm offers iPod-theft insurance for 
$50 per year: The firm will replace any insured iPod 
that is stolen. Suppose the firm sells 20 insurance 
policies.
a.	 Assume for the moment that the theft rate remains 
at 20 percent for both types of iPods. The firm’s 
total revenue equals 
. The firm’s cost—
the money paid out to replace stolen iPods—will 
be $
 to replace expensive iPods and 
$
 to replace cheap iPods, for a total of 
$
. The insurance firm will make zero eco-
nomic profit with a price of $
.
b.	Is it realistic to assume that the introduction of 
insurance will not affect the theft rate? Which is a 
more plausible assumption, that the theft rate will 
decrease to 10 percent or that it will increase to 30 
percent? For the more plausible theft rate, compute 
the zero-profit insurance price when insurance is 
purchased exclusively by the owners of expensive 
iPods.
4.7	 Skydiver Question. Several of your friends have 
offered to take you on a tandem skydiving adventure: 
Strapped together with a single set of parachutes (main 
and emergency), you will all jump out of an airplane 
and then either float to the earth or crash. All your 
skydiving friends are equally skillful, and none of them 
has the thrill-seeker gene. You can ask each of them a 
single question.
a.	 What’s your question?
b.	Provide the answer you’re looking for in a skydiv-
ing mate.
4.8	 Insurance and Fire Prevention. In a given year, there 
is a 20 percent chance that a fire in Tom’s house will 
cost $200,000 in property damage. If Tom spends 
$5,000 on a fire-prevention program, the probability 
of a fire would drop to zero.
a.	 If Tom doesn’t have fire insurance, will he spend the 
money on the prevention program?
b.	If Tom has an insurance policy that covers 80 per-
cent of the property damage from a fire (covering 
$160,000 of the $200,000 worth of damage), will he 
spend the money on the prevention program?
4.9	 Mandatory Insurance. Consider a hospital with 
500 doctors and a perfectly competitive market for mal-
practice insurance. The demand curve for malpractice 
insurance is linear and negatively sloped, with a slope 
of –$50 per case. At the initial price of $3,000, half 
the hospital’s doctors (250 doctors) buy insurance. The 
price is just high enough to cover all the costs of pro-
viding insurance, including a 50 percent premium to 
cover costs associated with uninsured doctors. ­Suppose 
the hospital makes malpractice insurance mandatory. 
Predict the new equilibrium.

662
4.10	 Crop Insurance. Consider a state in which farmers are 
divided equally into two types: high risk and low risk. 
The average annual crop loss (and possible insurance 
claim) is $200 for a low-risk farmer and $1,200 for a 
high-risk farmer.
a.	 If all farmers were to buy insurance, what is the 
break-even price for the insurance company?
b.	Suppose a farmer will purchase insurance only if the 
price (the annual premium) is no more than 50 per-
cent higher than his or her average crop loss. What 
is the equilibrium price?
4.11	 Safety Rebate from the Insurance Company. In 
2010 a leading insurance company started a policy that 
pays a policyholder a 5 percent rebate on his or her 
insurance premium in any year in which the driver does 
not file an insurance claim. For example, a household 
with an annual premium of $1,200 will get a $60 rebate 
check each year it does not file a claim. Explain the 
rationale for the rebate policy. What problem is the 
policy trying to solve? (Related to Application 4 on 
page 653.)
The Economics of Consumer Search
Use the marginal principle to describe optimal search by 
consumers.
5.1	 The reservation price is the price at which the con-
sumer is 
 about additional search, meaning 
that the 
 of search equals the 
.
5.2	 If a consumer knows that TVs are available at BestBuy 
at a price as low as $200, it is sensible not to continue 
shopping until the consumer finds the lowest-price 
store. 
 (True/False)
5.3	 Suppose the range of prices for a cooking book is $30 
to $70 and your discovered price (lowest price so far) 
is $48. If you visit one more store and discover a lower 
price, the best guess for a lower price is 
 and 
the savings if you discover this lower price is 
.
5.4	 As the opportunity cost of search time increases, the 
reservation price 
 (increases, decreases) 
and the amount of search time 
 (increases, 
decreases).
5.5	 A doubling of prices 
 (increases, decreases) 
the marginal benefit of search at a given 
 
price, and the percentage gap between the reserva-
tion price and the lowest price 
 (increases, 
decreases).
5.6	 A study of consumer search for liquid detergents esti-
mated that a doubling of income decreased the amount 
of search by roughly 
 (1, 14, 50, 70) percent. 
(Related to Application 5 on page 657.)
5.7	 Compute the Reservation Price. Suppose the range 
of prices for a consumer good is $20 to $60, and all 
prices in this range are equally likely.
a.	 Fill in the blanks in the table.
Discovered price (lowest so far)

b.	If the marginal cost of search is $1.25, the reserva-
tion price is 
.
5.8	 Internet and Reservation Prices. Consider a coun-
try that initially has no Internet service or telephones, 
so consumers must travel to stores to get information 
about prices. Use a graph to show the effects of intro-
ducing Internet service on the reservation price for a 
consumer good.

Rolling for Lemons
In this experiment, students play the role of consumers pur-
chasing used cars. Over half the used cars on the road (57%) 
are plums, and the remaining cars (43%) are lemons. Each 
consumer offers a price for a used car and then rolls a pair of 
dice to find out whether he or she gets a lemon or a plum. In 
general, rolling a big number is good news: To get a plum, 
you need to roll a big number. The higher the price you offer, 
the smaller the number you must roll to get a plum. Here is 
how the experiment works:
• Each consumer tells the instructor how much he or she is 
offering for a used car and then rolls the dice.
• The instructor tells the consumer whether the number 
rolled is large enough to get a plum. If the number is not 
large enough, the consumer gets a lemon.
Econom ic Experiment
• The consumers’ scores equal the difference between the 
maximum amount they are willing to pay for the type of 
car they got ($1,200 for a plum and $400 for a lemon) and 
the price they actually paid. For example, if Otto offers 
$500 and gets a plum, his score is $700. If Carla offers 
$600 and gets a lemon, her score is -$200.
• The instructor announces the result of each transaction 
to the class.
• There are three to five buying periods. At the end of the 
last trading period, each consumer adds up his or her 
score.

Bike Insurance
This experiment shows the effect of asymmetric information 
on the market for bicycle insurance. Consider a city with two 
types of bike owners: Some face a relatively high probability 
of bike theft, and others face a relatively low probability of 
bike theft. Bike owners know from experience whether they 
face a high probability or a low probability of theft, but the 
insurance company cannot distinguish between the two types 
of owners. For the city as a whole, 20 percent of bicycles are 
stolen every year. Here is how the experiment works:
• The class is divided into small groups. Each group rep-
resents an insurance company that must pick a price at 
which to offer bike-theft insurance. The insurance com-
pany must pay $100 for each insured bike that is stolen.
• The instructor has a table that shows for each price of 
bike insurance how many owners of each type (high 
Ec onom ic Experiment
probability and low probability) will purchase insurance. 
­Using the numbers supplied by the instructor, each in-
surance company can compute its total revenue (the price 
per bike insured times the number of insured bikes), the 
number of bikes stolen, and the company’s total replace-
ment cost.
• The group’s score for a trading period equals the com-
pany’s profit, which is the total revenue less the total re-
placement cost for stolen bikes.
• The experiment runs for several trading periods, and a 
group’s score equals the sum of its profits over these trad-
ing periods.

Meteors regularly enter Earth’s 
atmosphere, and most burn up 
before they reach its surface or 
are too small to do much harm.
But the impact of the occasional large meteorite—
at least 200 meters in diameter—would have cata-
strophic global effects. In 2012 the European Union 
initiated NEOShield, a project that will explore alterna-
tive responses to the threats posed by large near-earth 
objects (NEOs). The cooperative project draws support 
and expertise from Germany, France, Britain, Spain, 
Russia, and the United States.
Scientists are exploring three options for preventing 
an NEO impact: nudge, tug, and blast.
Nudge: Launch a kinetic impactor to strike the NEO and change its velocity so that it arrives at the crossing point 
with Earth’s orbit at an earlier or later time, thus avoiding an impact. A nudge replaces an impact with a near miss.
Tug: Position a spacecraft close to the NEO and use long-term thrusters to maintain a constant distance between 
the objects and use the gravitational force between the two objects to pull the NEO off course.
Blast: Detonate a nuclear device close enough to the NEO to change its course.
The purpose of the NEOShield project is to study each of the three options and recommend a course of action.

Chapter 30 • Public Goods and Public Choice
665
I
n this chapter, we see that if a particular good generates external benefits, govern-
ment intervention can make beneficial transactions happen. For example, although 
everyone on Earth would benefit from a system to deal with NEOs, the cost is so 
high that no single person would provide it. We will never have such a program—even 
if its benefits exceed its costs—unless we make a collective decision about what sort of 
system to develop and how to pay for it. One purpose of government is to help make 
this kind of collective decision.
This chapter explores the challenges associated with providing goods that generate 
external benefits. After an overview of government spending programs and tax sources, 
we look at the differences between private goods, such as housing, and public goods, 
such as levees. We discuss various responses to the problem of free riders—people who 
benefit from public goods but don’t pay for them. We also discuss the external benefits 
from education and other private goods. Then we show how the preferences of citizens 
affect elections and decisions in the public sector. Finally, we look at some alternative 
theories on government decision making.
Although it’s convenient to talk about “the” government, there are thousands of 
governments in the United States, and each citizen deals with at least three different 
levels of government. Figure 30.1 shows the budget breakdown for the three levels 
of government. The United States has more than 80,000 local governments, includ-
ing municipalities (city governments), counties, school districts, and special districts 
responsible for providing services such as water, fire protection, and libraries. Local 
governments spend most of their money on education (kindergarten through high 
school), public welfare and health (payments to poor households and support for public 
hospitals), highways, fire protection, and police and corrections. For states, the biggest 
spending programs are education (including colleges and universities), public welfare, 
highways, health and hospitals, and corrections (state courts and prisons). For the fed-
eral government, the biggest spending programs are programs for older adults (Social 
Security and Medicare), national defense, income security (payments to the poor), and 
interest on the national debt.

Figure 30.2 shows the revenue sources for local governments, states, and the 
federal government. About two-fifths of local government revenue comes from higher 
levels of government in the form of intergovernmental grants. The other major rev-
enue source for local governments is the property tax, which is a fixed percentage 
of the value of residential, commercial, or industrial property. At the state level, 
the most important revenue sources are intergovernmental grants from the federal 
government, the sales tax, and the individual income tax. A person’s state income tax 
liability is based on how much he or she earns, with tax rates that typically increase 
as income increases. At the federal level, the major revenue sources are individual 
income taxes and employment taxes, which include taxes collected to support Social 
Security and Medicare.
External Benefits and Public Goods
As we saw earlier in the chapter on market efficiency, when there are neither external 
benefits nor external costs, the market equilibrium is efficient. When a government 
intervenes in an efficient market, the result is inefficiency. In this chapter, we see that 
a market with external benefits is inefficient, so there is an opportunity for government 
to promote efficiency.
For most goods, the benefits of consumption are confined to the person who buys 
the good. The benefit experienced by a buyer is called a private benefit. In contrast, when 
someone else benefits from a good, the good generates an external benefit. To illustrate 
the idea of external benefits and inefficiency, consider a dam built for flood-control 
purposes. One thousand people would be protected by the dam, and each person would 
get a $50 benefit. If one person builds a dam, the private benefit is $50 and the external 
benefit is $49,950, or $50 for each of the 999 other people who benefit. If the cost of 
building the dam is $20,000, no single person will build it because the cost exceeds the 
$50 private benefit. In other words, if we rely on the forces of supply and demand, with 
each person considering only the private benefits and costs of the dam, it won’t be built.

When there are external benefits from a good, collective decision making generates 
more efficient choices. In the case of the dam, the total benefit of $50,000 exceeds the 
$20,000 cost, so the dam is efficient and society as a whole will be better off if it is built. 
The government can solve this problem by collecting enough tax revenue to pay for the 
dam. Suppose the government proposes to collect $20 per person to pay for the dam. 
The tax raises $20,000 in tax revenue ($20 per person times 1,000 people), which is just 
high enough to pay the $20,000 cost of the dam. Most people will support this proposal 
because the $20 tax per person is less than the $50 benefit per person. The government 
can use its taxing power to provide a good that would otherwise not be provided.
Public Goods and the Free-Rider Problem
The dam is an example of a public good. A public good is available for everyone to 
utilize, regardless of who pays for it and who doesn’t. More precisely, a public good is 
nonrival in consumption: The fact that one person benefits from a good does not pre-
vent another person from benefiting. For example, the fact that I benefit from a flood-
control dam doesn’t reduce your benefit from the dam. Public goods are also 
nonexcludable: It is impractical to exclude people who don’t pay. Some examples of 
public goods are national defense, law enforcement, space exploration, the preservation 
of endangered species, the protection of the earth’s ozone layer, and fireworks shows. 
If someone refuses to pay for one of these public goods, it would be impractical to 
prevent that person from consuming or benefiting from the good.
In contrast with public goods, each unit of a private good is consumed by a single 
person or household. For example, only one person can eat a hot dog, so it is a private good. 
If a government hands out free cheese, is the free cheese a public good or a private good? 
Although anyone can get in line for the cheese, only one person can actually consume a 
particular piece of cheese, so the free cheese is a private good that happens to be available 
free of charge from the government. Similarly, an apartment in a public housing project can 
be occupied by a single household, so it is a private good provided by the government.
Most public goods are supported by taxes. What would happen if we eliminated 
taxes and asked people to contribute money to pay for national defense, dams, city 
streets, and the police? Would people contribute enough money to support these 
programs at the efficient level? The problem with using voluntary contributions to 
support public goods is known as the free-rider problem. A free rider is a person who 
gets the benefit from a good but does not pay for it. Each person has a financial incen-
tive to try to get the benefits of a public good without paying for it. That is, some 
people will try to get a “free ride” at the expense of others who do pay. Of course, if 
everyone tries to get a free ride there will be no money to support the public good, so 
it won’t be provided.
The flip side of the free-rider problem is the chump problem: No one wants to be 
the chump—the person who gives free rides to other people—so no one contributes 
any money. The free-rider problem suggests that if taxes were replaced with volun-
tary contributions, the government would be forced to cut back or eliminate many 
programs. 
Overcoming the Free-Rider Problem
Many organizations, including public radio and television, religious organizations, and 
charitable organizations, raise money through voluntary contributions. So it appears 
that some people overcome their inclination to be free riders and contribute voluntarily 
to organizations that provide public goods. The successful organizations use a number 
of techniques to encourage people to contribute:
• Giving contributors private goods such as coffee mugs, books, musical record-
ings, and magazine subscriptions. People are more likely to contribute if they 
get something for it.
• Arranging matching contributions. You are more likely to contribute if you 
know your $30 contribution will be matched with a contribution from another 
person or your employer.

consume, regardless of who pays and who 
doesn’t; a good that is nonrival in con-

• Appealing to a person’s sense of civic or moral responsibility. People are more 
likely to contribute when they are reminded that they benefit from the service.
Note, however, that these organizations are only partly successful in mitigating the free-rider 
problem. Public radio is one of the success stories, even though the typical public-radio station 
gets contributions from fewer than a quarter of its listeners.

navigation and telecommunication services. In 2009, an Iridium 
communications satellite was demolished in a collision with 
an old Russian satellite. Modern global positioning systems 
(GPS), which employ satellites to provide precise timing and 
navigation signals, are at risk from collisions with orbital junk. 
The failure of a GPS system would disrupt Earth activities such 
as emergency response systems, global banking, and electric 
power grids.
The clearing of space debris is a public good that is subject 
to the free-rider problem. If one nation clears space debris and 
thus prevents collisions that would disrupt Earth activities, the 
benefits would go to people throughout the world. The solution 
to the problem will require international cooperation, to develop 
debris-clearing technology and to implement a system to pay 
for the cleanup.  Related to Exercises 1.4.

little monitoring. This makes it difficult to observe the interactions 
between oceans and atmosphere, and difficult to measure any 
changes in sea level that might be caused by global warming.
In recent years, the United States has taken the lead in 
encouraging cooperation and the sharing of data collected by 
different organizations around the world. The experience of 
coordination in monitoring El Niño, the intermittent ocean cur-
rent that affects weather in the western United States, is encour-
aging. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration (NOAA), early warnings of a change in the current 
in 1997–98 reduced damage to the California economy by about 
$1.1 billion.   Related to Exercise 1.6.

As another example of a public good, consider global weather 
observation. In this case, information gathered by one country 
generates external benefits when it is shared with other coun-
tries. Satellites, nomadic buoys, and weather stations monitor 
weather in different parts of the world, but no single organiza-
tion gathers all the information to reveal the big weather picture. 
Another problem is that the uninhabited parts of the world, in

Private Goods with External Benefits
In contrast to a public good, a private good can be utilized by only a single person 
or household. However, some private goods generate benefits for people who do not 
directly consume the good. For example, suppose I replace the peeling paint on my house 
with a fresh coat of paint. I benefit from the new paint because it protects my house from 
decay and my house will look better. My neighbors will also benefit from the improved 
appearance of the neighborhood. Similarly, if I buy a fire extinguisher and install fire-
proof roofing, my neighbors benefit because a fire is less likely to spread to their houses.
External Benefits from Education
Education is another private good that generates external benefits. Most of the benefits 
of education go to the student because education increases productivity and income, 
and presumably it makes everyday life easier and more interesting. Education generates 
three kinds of external benefits:
1	 Workplace externalities. In most workplaces, people work in groups and teamwork 
is important. A well-educated person understands instructions readily and is more 
likely to suggest ways to improve the production process. As a result, when a 
well-educated person joins a work team, the productivity of everyone on the team 
increases. Higher productivity generally leads to higher profits for firms, and 
members of the team are likely to earn higher salaries.
2	 Civic externalities. Citizens in a democratic society make collective decisions by voting 
in elections, and each citizen must live with these decisions. A well-educated person 
is more likely to vote intelligently, so there are external benefits for other citizens.
3	 Crime externalities. Educated people earn higher legal incomes and thus commit 
less crime. High school dropouts have relatively low wages and high crime rates, 
so increasing the high school graduation rate generates large reductions in crime.
A recent study estimates the external benefits of education related to lower crime 
rates.1 For every high-school student who graduates rather than dropping out after 
11th grade, the cost of crime decreases by about $1,600 per year for the rest of the 
graduate’s working life. The average cost of 1 year of high school is about $6,000, so 
for a one-time expense of $6,000 society gets a crime-reduction benefit of $1,600 per 
year for 30 or 40 years. 
External Benefits and the Marginal Principle
Consider a parent’s decision about how much time and money to spend on a child’s 
education. Suppose the parent bases the decision on his or her cost and the child’s 
private benefits—the child’s increase in potential earnings as an adult. To be spe-
cific, consider the decision on how many books to buy for the child. In Figure 30.3, 
the marginal private benefit curve shows the extra benefit to the child from each 
additional book, measured as the increase in future income. Assume the marginal 
cost of books is constant at $8 per book. Applying the marginal principle, the par-
ent will choose point a, where the marginal benefit equals the marginal cost, and 
buy nine books.

Increase the level of an activity as long as its marginal benefit

part 10

The higher of the two negatively sloped curves is the marginal social benefit of 
education. The marginal social benefit equals the marginal private benefit plus the 
marginal external benefit. As we’ve seen, there are external benefits from education, so 
the social benefit exceeds the private benefit. From society’s perspective, the best point 
is b, where the marginal social benefit equals the marginal cost. The socially efficient 
quantity is 15 books. As an illustration, consider the 12th book. The marginal private 
benefit is $6 (shown by point c) and the external benefit is $4, so the marginal social 
benefit is $6 plus $4, or $10 (shown by point d). The social benefit exceeds the $8 cost, 
so providing the book is efficient from the social perspective. The private benefit of $6 
is less than the $8 cost, however, so the parent won’t buy the 12th book, but instead 
will stop with nine books. The lesson is that when there are external benefits, decisions 
based on private benefits will generate an inefficiently small quantity of the good.
Because of the external benefits from education, the government uses various 
policies to encourage people to become educated. Local governments provide free 
education through high school. States subsidize students at public colleges and 
universities, providing college education at a fraction of its actual cost. In addi-
tion, the federal government provides financial aid to students in both public and 
private schools. 
Other Private Goods That Generate External Benefits
The government subsidizes other goods that generate external benefits. Subsidies for 
on-the-job training and education encourage workers and firms to invest in human 
capital and increase labor productivity. It is sensible for the government to subsidize 
training and education because some of the benefits are transferred to other firms 
when workers change employers. Another example of external benefits is research at 
universities and other nonprofit organizations. If a research project provides knowledge 
or technology that leads to the development of new products or the improvement of 
old ones, the benefits from the project spill over onto consumers and producers. When 
there are external benefits, the government can encourage people to take actions that 
benefit other people. By making beneficial transactions happen, the government can 
increase efficiency. 
▲  Figure 30.3  External Benefits and the Marginal Principle
Education (represented here as the number of books read) generates external benefits, so the marginal 
social benefit exceeds the marginal private benefit. Using books as an example of education, an indi-
vidual picks point a, where the marginal private benefit equals the marginal cost. Point b is the socially 
efficient point, where the marginal social benefit equals the marginal cost.

External Benefits From Lojack
Applying the Concepts #3: What private goods generate external benefits?
install LoJack systems in their cars generate benefits for them-
selves and external benefits for other car owners who don’t 
have LoJack.
A study by two economists estimated the private and exter-
nal benefits from LoJack. The annual cost of a LoJack system 
is about $100. For a car owner who carries theft insurance, 
the benefit from a LoJack system is the discount offered by 
an insurance company, typically well below the $100 annual 
cost. For every three LoJack systems installed, the number of 
auto thefts decreases by one car per year. The external ben-
efit from fewer vehicle thefts is about $1,300 per LoJack per 
year. The benefits are experienced by people who don’t buy 
their own LoJack systems but who benefit because thieves can 
never be sure whether a particular car is protected by LoJack 
or not.   Related to Exercises 2.6 and 2.8.
SOURCE: Based on Ian Ayres and Steven Levitt, “Measuring Positive Externalities 
from Unobservable Victim Precautions: An Empirical Analysis of Lojack,” Quarterly 
Journal of Economics 113 (1998), pp. 43–77.
LoJack, a system used to recover stolen vehicles, is a private 
good that generates external benefits. A small, silent transmit-
ter hidden in a vehicle allows police to track a stolen car. The 
name is a play on words, meant to convey the idea that LoJack 
will recover vehicles that are hijacked or stolen. A thief who 
steals a LoJack-equipped car won’t keep the car for long and 
is likely to get caught, so LoJack is an effective deterrent to 
car theft. Car thieves cannot distinguish between cars with and 
without LoJack, so the system decreases the payoff from car 
theft in general, and criminals steal fewer cars. People who

The Private and External Benefit of Trees
Applying the Concepts #4: What happens when neighbors benefit?
benefits—from shade, improved air quality, and aesthetics—
go to the property owner and the neighbors. A forest econo-
mist estimates that a mature tree adds about $7,000 to the 
value of the owner’s house, and also increases the value of 
neighboring houses (within 100 feet) by a total of $13,000. 
Given the $13,000 external benefit, we anticipate that the 
equilibrium number of trees will be less than the socially effi-
cient number. To address this problem, some cities subsi-
dize the purchase of trees. For example, the city of Portland, 
Oregon, pays $50 for each new tree. In addition, some cities 
provide public services such as leaf pickup that reduce the 
cost of upkeep.   Related to Exercise 2.7.
SOURCE: Based on Matthew Preusch, “The Money Trees,” The Oregonian, 
­February 12, 2010, p. E1.
Mature trees in residential neighborhoods have private 
costs and both private and social benefits. The initial cost—
to purchase a seedling and plant it—is relatively low, but 
the owner’s opportunity cost of upkeep (time and money 
spent watering, raking leaves, trimming) can be large. The 
Public Choice and the Median Voter
We have discussed the challenges associated with providing and paying for goods that 
generate external benefits. In this part of the chapter, we study public-choice 
­economics, a field that uses models of rational choice to explore decision making in 
the public sector. We start with a model of government decisions based on voting and 
then look at some alternative models.

Voting and the Median-Voter Rule
As citizens in a democracy, we pick people to make public decisions. We vote for people 
to represent our viewpoints in legislative bodies (city council members, state legisla-
tors, and congressional representatives), and we vote for people in executive positions 
(mayors, governors, and presidents). The basic idea of a democracy is that the govern-
ment will take actions that are approved by the majority of citizens. If governments are 
responsive to voters, the voting public ultimately makes all the important decisions, 
and the actions of the government will reflect their preferences.
One concept of public-choice economics is known as the median-voter rule. 
According to this rule, the choices made by the government will match the preferences 
of the median voter, defined as the voter whose preferences lie in the middle of the set 
of all voters’ preferences: Half the voters want more of something (for example, a larger 
government budget) and half want less (a smaller government budget). As we’ll see, 
this rule has some important implications for decision making and politics.
To see the logic of the median-voter rule, consider a state where there are 
two candidates for governor—Penny and Buck—and the only issue in the election 
is how much the state should spend on education. Each citizen will vote for the 
candidate whose proposed education budget is closest to the citizen’s preferred 
budget. Figure 30.4 shows citizens’ preferences for education spending, with dif-
ferent preferred budgets on the horizontal axis and the number of voters on the 
vertical axis. For example, two citizens have a preferred budget of $1 billion, four 
have a preferred budget of $2 billion, and so on. The median budget, which splits 
the rest of the voters into two equal groups (20 voters on each side), is $5 billion.

The choices made by the government 
will match the preferences of the median 
voter.
▲  Figure 30.4  The Median-Voter Rule
If Penny proposes a $3 billion budget and Buck proposes a $7 billion budget, the election will result in a 
tie. By moving toward the median budget, Penny can increase her chance of being elected. In equilib-
rium, both candidates will propose a budget close to the $5 billion preferred budget of the median voter.

Preferred education budget (billions of dollars)
Suppose the two candidates start out with very different proposed education bud-
gets. Penny proposes a budget of $3 billion, and Buck proposes $7 billion. The 20 citi-
zens with preferred budgets less than or equal to $4 billion will vote for Penny because 
her proposed budget is closest to their preferred budgets. Buck’s supporters include the 
20 citizens with preferred budgets greater than or equal to $6 billion. The two candi-
dates will split the 10 voters with a preferred budget of $5 billion (halfway between the 
two proposed budgets), so each candidate will get a total of 25 votes, resulting in a tie.
Penny could increase her chance of being elected by increasing her proposed bud-
get. Let’s say she proposes $4 billion instead of $3 billion. All the voters with a preferred 
budget of $5 billion will vote for Penny because Penny’s $4 billion proposal is now 

Chapter 30 • Public Goods and Public Choice
673
closer to their $5 billion preferred budget than Buck’s $7 billion proposal. Penny won’t 
lose any of her other votes either, so she will win the election by a vote of 30 (equal 
to 2 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 10) to 20 (equal to 8 + 8 + 4). If Buck is smart, he will realize 
that he could get more votes by moving toward the median budget. For example, if he 
decreases his proposed budget to $6 billion, the election would result in a tie vote again. 
Penny and Buck will continue to move their proposed budgets toward the median bud-
get ($5 billion) until they both propose budgets that are very close to the median budget.
Powerful forces pull the two candidates toward the preferences of the median 
voter. As long as Penny proposes a smaller budget than Buck, the people with small 
preferred budgets will continue to vote for her. The benefit of moving toward the 
median is that she can take some votes from Buck. Similarly, Buck doesn’t have to 
worry about people with large preferred budgets but can concentrate instead on the 
battle for voters in the middle. The result is that by election day the two candidates have 
adopted virtually the same position: The position of the median voter. Voters trying 
to choose between two candidates may feel they don’t have much choice. In fact, the 
median-voter rule says the choices made by government will match the preferences of 
the median voter, regardless of who wins the election.
Although we usually think that people make political decisions by voting in elec-
tions, it is also possible to “vote with your feet.” In 1956 economist Charles M. Tiebout 
suggested that a household’s choice of which community to live in is based in part on 
the tax and spending policies of different communities.2 Households express their pref-
erences by moving to communities that offer the best package of services and taxes. A 
community with inefficient public services will experience a loss in population, perhaps 
causing the local officials to make public services more efficient to attract new residents.
It is clear that people vote with their ballots and with their feet. In both cases, citi-
zens can express their preferences for public goods, taxes, and public policies. These 
two sources of citizen power limit the ability of governments to take actions that are 
inconsistent with the preferences of most voters. 
The Median Voter and the Median Location
The logic of the median-voter result also applies to competition among some types of 
sellers. Imagine a 1-mile stretch of beach with 120 swimmers and sunbathers distrib-
uted evenly along it. Suppose each person on the beach will purchase one ice cream 
cone and is willing to travel up to a mile to get it. If there are two ice cream vendors 
on the beach selling identical products, where will they locate?
The most efficient arrangement is to locate the two vendors a half mile apart. 
We could divide the beach into two half-mile territories and locate each vendor at the 
middle of a territory. As shown in Panel A of Figure 30.5, Lefty would be at the 1/4 
mile mark, and Righty would be at the 3/4 mile mark. If beachgoers patronize the closer 
vendor, each vendor would sell 60 ice cream cones. This arrangement will minimize 
the total travel costs of ice cream patrons.
Is this an equilibrium arrangement? If Lefty were to move to the right—to the 1/2 
mile mark, the median location that splits consumers into two equal halves—he would 
not lose any of his customers to his left but would capture part of Righty’s market. 
As shown in Panel B of Figure 30.5, Lefty would then be the closer vendor for the 
people located between the 1/2 mile mark and the 5/8 mile mark. Therefore, Lefty 
would sell 75 cones (up from 60) and Righty would sell only 45 cones. To protect her 
market, Righty would move to the median location, too, locating right next to Lefty. 
By doing so, Righty can recover her 50 percent share of the market, again serving the 
consumers on the right half of the beach. At any other location, she would get less than 
half the market, given Lefty is at the median location. In equilibrium, shown in Panel C 
of Figure 30.5, both vendors pick the median location and each serves half the market.
The outcome of the ice cream vendors’ game is the same as for the politicians’ 
game. Like politicians, the vendors have an incentive to move to the median location, 
so there is no real difference between the two vendors.

Alternative Models of Government: Self-Interest  
and Special Interests
Several economists, including Nobel Laureate James Buchanan, have suggested a model 
of government that focuses on the selfish behavior of government officials. According 
to this view, politicians and bureaucrats pursue their own narrow interests, which, of 
course, may differ from the public interest. For example, politicians or bureaucrats may 
gain prestige from starting a new spending program even if the cost of the program 
exceeds its social benefit. Because voters don’t have much information about the costs 
and benefits of public services, they may not be in a position to evaluate the actions of 
politicians or bureaucrats and vote accordingly.
The self-interest theory of government explains why voters sometimes approve 
explicit limits on taxes and government spending. For example, many states have limits 
on property tax rates and total revenue, and many states also limit total government 
spending. According to the self-interest theory of government, limitations on taxes 
and spending are necessary safeguards against politicians and bureaucrats who benefit 
from larger budgets.
Another model of government is based on the idea that small groups of people 
manipulate government for their own gain. Suppose the total benefit of a dam is 
less than its total cost, so the project is inefficient, but a few farmers reap large 
benefits from the dam, while the costs are spread over a million taxpayers. The 
farmers have a strong incentive to spend time and money convincing policymakers 
▲  Figure 30.5  Competition on a Beach Leads to a Median Location for Both Sellers

mile mark, and he sells 75 cones, compared to 45 for Righty. (C) Righty can recover her lost territory by

to build the dam. In contrast, if the tax is only $1 per person, few taxpayers will 
make their preferences known to policymakers because the marginal benefit (the 
$1 tax savings) is less than the marginal cost (the opportunity cost of their time). If 
politicians listen to people who express their preferences and contribute money to 
political campaigns, the inefficient project may be approved. This is an example of 
a special-interest group (farmers) manipulating the government at the expense of a 
larger group (all taxpayers). In general, when a few people share the benefit from a 
project and a large number of people share the cost, the government is more likely 
to approve inefficient projects.
Whenever benefits are concentrated on a few citizens but costs are spread 
out over many, we expect special-interest groups to form. Special-interest orga-
nizations often use lobbyists to express their views to government officials and 
policymakers. 
Which Theory Is Correct?
Which of these theories or viewpoints best describes the actual practices of govern-
ments? This is a very difficult question. Economists and political scientists have stud-
ied many dimensions of the decision-making processes underlying tax policies and 
spending policies. There is evidence that people do vote with ballots and with their 
feet, and that these two forms of voting make a difference. There is also evidence that 
government officials sometimes pursue their own interests and those of special-interest 
groups. The field of public choice is a very active area of research for both economists 
and political scientists.

The Median Voter in the NBA
Applying the Concepts #5: What is the median-voter rule?
The National Basketball Association (NBA) uses labor agree-
ments between players and owners to control player salaries. 
In the absence of a collective bargaining agreement regarding 
salaries, the market equilibrium would generate very high salaries 
for a small number of superstar players. Labor agreements are 
approved by majority rule, and as in other voting environments, 
the winning proposals reflect the preferences of the median voter, 
defined in this case as the player with the median salary. To predict 
the outcome of a vote between two competing labor agreements, 
we can ask, Which agreement does the median player prefer?
Recent NBA agreements use salary caps and other provisions 
to shift salary money away from the superstars in favor of less 
super players, including the median player. For the 1997 agree-
ment, all players with salaries below the median salary gained from 
the agreement, and the largest gains went to players with salaries 
closest to the median salary.   Related to Exercise 3.5.

In this chapter, we’ve 
seen why the govern-
ment provides public 
goods. The free-rider 
problem means that we 
can’t rely on voluntary 
contributions to support 
public goods and subsi-
dies, so taxes are nec-
essary to support public 
programs. We’ve also 
examined different views on how governments actually make deci-
sions. Here are the main points of the chapter:
1.	 When a good generates external benefits, collective decision 
making generates more efficient choices.
2.	 A public good is available for everyone to consume (nonri-
val in consumption), regardless of who pays and who doesn’t 
(nonexcludable).
3.	 A system of voluntary contributions suffers from the free-rider 
problem: People do not have a financial incentive to support 
public goods.
4.	 Education generates external benefits in the workplace and in 
elections and reduces crime.
5.	 The median-voter rule suggests that government choices will 
match the preferences of the median voter, defined as the voter 
whose preferences lie in the middle of voter preferences.

External Benefits and Public Goods
Define a public good and the free-rider problem.
1.1	 Suppose 2,000 people would each get a benefit of $60 
from a bridge. Building the bridge is socially efficient 
if its cost is less than $
. If the cost is $80,000, 
a tax of $
 per person would generate unani-
mous support for the bridge.
1.2	 An external benefit is experienced by 
.
1.3	 A public good is 
 (rival/nonrival) in con-
sumption and 
 (excludable/nonexcludable).
1.4	 The clearing of space debris is an example of a 
 that suffers from the 
 problem. 
(Related to Application 1 on page 668.)
1.5	 Paying for a Wi-Fi Network. Consider a small town 
with 1,000 households. The town could install a wire-
less Wi-Fi network that would give everyone in town 
access to the Internet. Each household is willing to pay 
a maximum of $50 per year for the network, and the 
cost of the system is $20,000 per year.
a.	 Is the Wi-Fi system efficient?
b.	Suppose the town asks for voluntary contributions 
to support the network. Would you expect the total 
contributions to cover the $20,000 cost?
c.	 Suppose the town keeps track of the contributions 
and issues passwords to people who contributed at 
least $20. Would you expect the total contributions 
to cover the $20,000 cost?
1.6	 Cost Sharing for Monitoring El Niño. Suppose the 
monitoring of El Niño’s current costs a total of $12 
billion per decade. Over a decade, early warning of the 
current’s path would reduce its damages by $9 billion 
in the United States, $6 billion in Canada, and $3 bil-
lion in Mexico. (Related to Application 2 on page 668.)
a.	 Does any country, acting unilaterally, have an incen-
tive to monitor El Niño?
b.	Do the social benefits of monitoring exceed the 
costs?
c.	 Design a cost-sharing arrangement that will cause 
all three countries to support a monitoring system.
All problems are assignable in MyLab Economics.

1.7	 Defenders of Wildlife. Suppose that each of the 
70,000 citizens in the Tatra County of Poland is will-
ing to pay $0.10 to increase the number of bears by 
one. Each bear imposes a cost of $2,000 in various 
losses (e.g., in crops and livestock) to farmers.
a.	 Is the drive to save the endangered bears from 
extinction efficient from a social perspective?
b.	How can the drive be implemented to compensate 
the farmers’ loss?
1.8	 Class Participation. Consider a course with 40 stu-
dents, some of whom are confused after the profes-
sor explains a concept. The professor doesn’t know 
whether students are confused but will clarify the con-
cept if one student asks a question. A student who asks 
a question—and reveals his or her confusion—loses 
10 utils. When the professor clarifies the concept in 
response to a question, each confused student gets a 
benefit of 2 utils.
a.	 At what level of confusion (measured by the number 
of confused students) is a question from a confused 
student socially efficient?
b.	In the absence of participation incentives, will a 
confused student ask a question when it would be 
socially efficient to do so?
c.	 Design an incentive system to generate efficient 
questioning.
1.9	 Fireworks as Public Goods. A three-person city is 
considering a fireworks display. Bertha is willing to pay 
$100 for the proposed fireworks display, Marian is will-
ing to pay $30, and Sam is willing to pay $20. The cost 
of the fireworks display is $120.
a.	 Will any single citizen provide the display on his or 
her own?
b.	If the cost of the fireworks display is divided equally 
among the citizens, will a majority vote be in favor 
of the display?
c.	 Describe a transaction that would benefit all three 
citizens.
1.10	 Stream Preservation. Consider a trout stream that is 
threatened with destruction by a nearby logging opera-
tion. Each of the 10,000 local fishers would be willing 
to pay $5 to preserve the stream. The owner of the land 
would incur a cost of $20,000 to change the logging 
operation to protect the stream.
a.	 Is the preservation of the stream efficient from a 
social perspective?
b.	If the landowner has the right to log the land any 
way he wants, will the stream be preserved?
c.	 Propose a solution to this problem. Describe a 
transaction that would benefit the fishers and the 
landowner.
Private Goods with External Benefits
Define an external benefit from a private good.
2.1	 A fire extinguisher is an example of a(n) 
 
good with a(n) 
 benefit.
2.2	 Education generates three types of external benefits: 
, 
, and 
.
2.3	 The external benefit of transforming a high school 
dropout into a graduate may amount to about 
$
 in 30 years.
2.4	 A parent chooses the level of education at which the 
marginal 
 benefit equals marginal cost and 
chooses 
 (more/less) than the socially effi-
cient level because the parent ignores the 
.
2.5	 It is sensible for the government to subsidize worker 
training and education because some of the benefits 
from training go to 
.
2.6	 For a car owner who has theft insurance, the benefit 
from a LoJack system is usually well below its annual 
cost of $
. However, the 
 benefit 
from fewer vehicle thefts is about $1,300 per LoJack 
per year. (Related to Application 3 on page 671.)
2.7	 The external benefit of a tree is measured by the change 
in 
, and is equal to about 
. (Related 
to Application 4 on page 671.)
2.8	 LoJack and Insurance Companies. Consider the 
application “External Benefits from LoJack.” Suppose 
all vehicles in a state carry theft insurance. The benefit 
from reduced vehicle theft goes to insurance companies 
because they replace fewer stolen vehicles. Insurance 
companies do not offer any discounts for customers who 
install LoJack. The cost of LoJack is $100 per vehicle 
per year. To simplify matters, assume that the private 
benefit of LoJack is zero, so the social benefit equals the 
external benefit. (Related to Application 3 on page 671.)
a.	 Suppose a single insurance company provides auto-
mobile insurance to all vehicles in the state. Will the 
insurance company provide free LoJacks to at least 
some of its customers? Explain.
b.	Suppose that there are 20 companies in the state, 
each with a market share of 5 percent. Will the 
insurance company provide free LoJacks?
c.	 What is the threshold number of insurance com-
panies—the number at which each insurance com-
pany will be indifferent about providing free LoJack 
systems?
2.9	 External Benefits from Education and Deadweight 
Loss. Using Figure 30.3 on page 670 as a starting 
point, compute the deadweight loss associated with 
reaching the market equilibrium at point a rather than 
the socially efficient outcome at point b. Notice that 
the marginal external benefit is constant at $4 per book, 
so the gap between the marginal private benefit curve 
and the marginal social benefit curve is $4.

Public Choice and the Median Voter
Describe the median-voter rule and its consequences for 
public policy.
3.1	 According to the model of voting developed in the 
chapter, the choices made by the government match 
the preferences of the 
 voter.
3.2	 The self-interest theory of government explains 
why many states have limits on 
 and 
.
3.3	 The special-interest theory of government sug-
gests a government will approve an inefficient 
project if the costs of the project are paid by a 
 (large/small) number of citizens and the 
benefits go to a 
 (large/small) number of 
citizens.
3.4	 In the example of ice cream vendors, the vendors 
choose the 
 location, and this is an 
 
(­efficient/inefficient) choice.
3.5	 Does the median-voter rule apply to the labor agree-
ments of the National Basketball Association players? 
How? (Based on Application 5 on page 675.)
3.6	 Consider the application on the median voter and pub-
lic education. (Based on Application 5 on page 675.)

b.	Under what scenario is the median voter more likely 
to vote in favor of public schooling?
c.	 Consider the scenario that is least favorable 
to the median voter. Under what conditions 
will the median voter vote in favor of public 
schooling?
3.7	 Alienation and the Median-Voter Rule. Consider the 
example of the ice cream vendors on the beach. Suppose 
people are unwilling to walk more than 1/4 mile for an 
ice cream cone. As a starting point, suppose both sellers 
locate at the median location, the 1/2 mile mark.

d.	What are the equilibrium locations for the two sell-
ers? How does it differ from the equilibrium when 
everyone bought an ice cream cone, regardless of 
the distance to the nearest seller?
e.	Recall the discussion of the median-voter rule. 
Suppose voters are subject to alienation: A citizen 
will not vote in a budget election if the difference 
between the voter’s preference and the politician’s 
position is too large. Does the median-voter rule 
still hold?
3.8	 More Voters. Consider the example of the guber-
natorial election shown in Figure 30.4 on page 672. 
Suppose 28 new people move into the state and each 
newcomer has a desired education budget of $3 billion. 
Predict the proposed education budgets for the two 
candidates for governor.
3.9	 Change in Preferences and Proposed Budgets. 
Consider the example of the election shown in Fig­
ure 30.4 on page 672. Suppose the preferences of the 
four voters who prefer a budget of $8 billion change, 
with each person preferring $15 billion instead. Will 
this change in preferences change the proposed bud-
gets of the two candidates?
Voluntary Contributions
Do people really try to get free rides? Or would most people 
contribute at least some money to support a public good? 
Here is a classroom experiment that helps to answer this 
question:
Eco nom ic Experiment
• The instructor selects 10 students and gives each student 
10 dimes.
• Each student can contribute money to support a pub-
lic good by dropping one, two, or three dimes into a

cal Economy 64 (1956), pp. 416–424.
Notes
­public-good pot. Each student has the option of keeping 
all the dimes and not contributing anything. The con-
tributions are anonymous: No one knows how much a 
particular student contributes.
• For each dime in the pot, the instructor adds two dimes. 
For example, if the students contribute a total of 40 dimes, 
the instructor adds 80 dimes, for a total of 120  dimes 
in the pot. The two-for-one match represents the idea 
that the benefits of public goods exceed the costs. In this 
case, the benefit/cost ratio is three to one.
• The instructor divides the money in the public-good pot 
equally among the 10 students. For example, if there are 
120 dimes in the pot, each student receives 12 dimes.
• Steps 2 through 4 can be repeated four or five times.
We can change the experiment to mimic the compulsory 
tax system. The instructor could require each student to 
contribute three dimes, the maximum amount. Would a 
switch to a compulsory tax system make the students better 
or worse off?
Debriefing
After completing the experiment, do the following exercise: 
Consider the contribution incentives for Margie, one of the 
10 students in the experiment. She thinks in marginal terms 
and asks herself, “If I contribute one more dime, how would 
that affect my payoff from the experiment?”
a.	 Answer Margie’s question, assuming her contribution 
does not affect the contributions of other students.
b.	If Margie uses the marginal principle to make all her 
decisions, will she contribute the extra dime?

MyLab Economics helps you master each

Buildings account for about 40 percent 
of our consumption of raw materials 
and energy, and are responsible for 
about 30 percent of greenhouse gas 
emissions.
To encourage the construction of energy-efficient buildings, the 
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) awards Energy-
Star certificates to buildings that meet certain efficiency targets. 
In addition, a private organization awards LEED certificates 
(Leadership in Environmental and Energy Design) to buildings 
that meet energy-efficiency targets, among other “sustainability” 
goals. Many states and cities in the United States require LEED 
certification for new commercial buildings and renovations.
How do the market prices of Energy-Star and LEED build-
ings compare to the prices of less energy-efficient buildings? 
A recent study1 shows that the typical building certified under 
one of the programs sells at a premium of about $5.7 million, 
or about 16 percent of the purchase price. A certified build-
ing sells at a premium because its greater energy efficiency 
means lower utility bills for its tenants. In addition, there are 
other unmeasured benefits such as higher worker productivity 
and a more favorable corporate image. The certified buildings vary in their energy efficiency, and the greater the 
energy efficiency, the larger the premium: a 10 percent decrease in the actual energy used in a building increases 
the market price by 1.2 percent.

Chapter 31 • External Costs and Environmental Policy
681
A
s we saw earlier in the chapter on market efficiency, one condition for mar-
ket efficiency is that there are no external costs in production. The cost of 
producing a product is confined to the person who sells it. In contrast, when 
production generates external costs such as air or water pollution, we say there is 
market failure: Markets fail to allocate resources efficiently. The role of public policy 
is to intervene in the market to make it more efficient. As we’ll see in this chapter, the 
best response to market failure is not to abandon markets, but instead to use them to 
reduce pollution in the most efficient manner. We discuss two market-oriented poli-
cies: pollution taxes and auctions for pollution permits. The chapter’s theme is that 
often the economic solution to market failure is to create markets where they do not 
currently exist.
One of our most challenging environmental problems concerns climate change. 
The mission of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), an organiza-
tion that reports to the United Nations, is to provide comprehensive scientific assess-
ments of the causes and consequences of rising levels of atmospheric greenhouse gases 
(GHGs). In a recent report,2 the IPCC presents three key conclusions:
1	 Observed changes in climate. The warming of the climate system is unequivocal, 
as shown by increases in average air and ocean temperatures, widespread melting 
of snow and ice, and rising sea levels.
2	 Causes of change. The energy balance of the climate system has been altered by 
changes in (a) atmospheric concentrations of GHGs and aerosols, (b) land cover, 
and (c) solar radiation. Between 1970 and 2004, the GHG emissions from human 
activities increased by 70%.
3	 Projected climate change and its impacts. Under current practices (including cur-
rent climate-change mitigation policies), there is much evidence that global GHG 
emissions will continue to increase over the next few decades.
To summarize, IPCC concludes that the climate is warming, that human activities 
contribute to warming, and that under current practices, warming will continue.
The IPCC reports the most reliable projections of changes in surface tempera-
tures and sea levels for the rest of this century. The projected changes are large enough 
to cause significant changes in economies throughout the world. The anticipated 
increase in sea level will inundate coastal land, and the anticipated changes in the 
climate will alter the patterns of winds and rainfall, affecting the production of food 
and other agricultural products. As we’ll see in this chapter, the economic approach 
to the problem of global warming is to impose a unit tax on greenhouse gases such as 
CO2. This approach ensures that any reduction in CO2 emissions will be achieved in 
the most efficient way.
The Optimal Level of Pollution
Should we eliminate all pollution? Although a pristine environment with pure water 
and air sounds appealing, there would be some very unappealing consequences. To 
reduce air pollution, we could eliminate trucks, but shipping goods by horse-drawn 
wagon would result in higher freight costs and higher prices for most products—and a 
different sort of pollution. We could reduce water pollution by shutting down all the 
paper mills, but reverting to parchment and slate boards would be unwieldy. Given the 
consequences of eliminating pollution, it is sensible to allow some pollution to occur. 
What’s the optimal level of pollution?
Using the Marginal Principle
The most convenient way to discuss pollution policies is in terms of pollution abate-
ment, that is, reductions in pollution from some starting level. We can use the marginal 
principle to determine the optimal level of pollution abatement.
Learning Objective 31.1
Use the marginal principle to describe 
the optimum level of pollution.

part 10
682
According to this principle, we should cut pollution to the level where the marginal 
benefit of abatement equals its marginal cost.
The marginal principle focuses our attention on the trade-offs from pollution—its 
costs and benefits. From society’s perspective, there are many benefits from pollution 
abatement:
• Better health. Cleaner water means less sickness from waterborne pollutants, and 
cleaner air means fewer respiratory problems and thus lower health-care costs 
and fewer sick days taken by workers.
• Increased enjoyment of the natural environment. Improving the air quality 
increases visibility and improves the health of trees. Improving the water quality 
enhances recreational activities, such as swimming, boating, and fishing.
• Lower production costs. Some firms are dependent on clean water for survival: 
Farmers use water for irrigation, and some manufacturers use clean water as 
part of the production process. Cleaner water means lower production costs for 
these firms.
On the other hand, pollution abatement is costly because resources—labor, capi-
tal, and land—are used in the abatement process. Using the marginal principle, we 
look for the level of pollution abatement at which the marginal benefit equals the 
marginal cost. 
Example: The Optimal Level of Water Pollution
To illustrate the determination of the optimum level of pollution, consider a lake 
shared by a steel mill and a fishing firm. The mill dumps waste into the lake, and pol-
lution degrades the fish habitat and decreases the fish harvest. Figure 31.1 shows the 
marginal benefits and marginal costs of pollution abatement. The firm can abate pollu-
tion, and the positively sloped curve is the marginal cost of abatement, which increases 
from $3 for the first unit abated (point b) to $13 for the last unit abated (point f  ). The 
negatively sloped curve is the marginal benefit of abatement, equal to the increase in 
the fish harvest from a 1-ton decrease in pollution. The marginal benefit decreases as 
abatement increases, from $21 for the first ton of abatement (point a) to $1 for the last 
ton abated (point g).
We can apply the marginal principle to determine the socially efficient outcome. 
The efficient outcome is shown by point e, where the marginal benefit of abatement 
equals the marginal cost at 300 tons of abatement and 200 tons of waste. For any 
smaller quantity of abatement, the marginal benefit exceeds the marginal cost, so 
increasing abatement is more beneficial than costly. For example, if we start with 
100 tons of abatement (400 tons of waste), the marginal benefit is $17, compared to 
a marginal cost of $5. Abating an additional ton increases the fish harvest by $17 but 
costs the steel firm only $5, so additional abatement is socially efficient. At the other 
extreme, we could have a pristine lake, with zero waste and 500 tons of abatement 
(points f and g). This is inefficient because the last unit of abatement (decreasing pol-
lution from 1 ton to 0) has a cost of $13 (point f  ) and a benefit of only $1 (point g). 
Stated another way, the first unit of pollution is less costly to experience ($1) than it 
is to prevent ($13), so it is efficient to have some pollution. The same logic applies to 
M a r g i n a l  P r i n c i p l e 
Increase the level of an activity as long as its marginal benefit 
exceeds its marginal cost. Choose the level at which the marginal 
benefit equals the marginal cost.

the 301st through the 500th units of abatement: The marginal benefit of abatement 
is less than the marginal cost. 
Coase Bargaining
Under some circumstances, an external-cost problem can be resolved through bargain-
ing among the affected parties. The Coase bargaining solution, named after economist 
Ronald Coase, applies to a situation when there is a small number of affected parties, 
and the transactions costs of bargaining are relatively low.
We can illustrate the bargaining solution with our example of a lake shared by 
a steel mill and a fishing firm. If the steel mill has the property rights to the lake, it 
can dump waste into the lake. The fishing firm benefits from abatement, and would 
be willing to pay the mill to reduce pollution. For the first ton of abatement, the fish-
ing firm is willing to pay $21, the cost of abating the first ton is only $3, and the two 
parties can cut a deal. If they split the difference between the benefit and the cost, the 
fishing firm will pay $12 to the mill for 1 ton of abatement, and both will be better off. 
The fishing firm pays $12 to get $21 in additional fish, while the mill gets $12 to incur 
an abatement cost of $3. The same logic applies to the second ton of abatement: The 
marginal benefit (just below $21) exceeds the marginal cost (just above $3), so the two 
parties can cut a deal. As shown by points c and d, the marginal benefit of the 100th ton 
of abatement exceeds the marginal cost by $12, so there is still an opportunity for an 
abatement deal. The deal making continues until we reach point e, where the marginal 
benefit to the fishing firm equals the marginal cost to the mill. Beyond this point, the 
marginal benefit of abatement is less than the marginal cost: The amount the fishing 
firm is willing to pay for one more ton of abatement is less than the cost of abatement.
How would things change if we assigned the property rights to the fishing firm 
rather than the steel mill? In this case, we would start with a pristine lake, with 0 tons 
▲  Figure 31.1  Efficient Abatement and Coase Bargaining
The efficient level of pollution abatement, where the marginal benefit equals the marginal cost, is 300 
tons (200 tons of waste). If the property rights are assigned to the polluter (steel mill), we start with zero 
abatement, and the other party (the fishing firm) pays to reach 300 tons of abatement. If the property 
rights are assigned to the other party, we start with zero pollution, and the polluter pays to increase pol-
lution to 200 tons of waste.

1 ton of pollution to 0), is a $1 increase in the fish harvest. As shown by point f, the 
marginal cost of the last unit of abatement is $13. In other words, going from 1 ton of 
pollution to 0 generates a cost to the steel mill of $13. Reversing direction, allowing 
1 ton of pollution would save the steel firm $13. In other words, allowing the first ton 
of waste would harm the fishing firm by only $1 and save the mill $13, so there is room 
to bargain. Splitting the difference between the $1 harm and $13 cost savings, if the 
steel mill paid $7 for the right to dump 1 ton of waste, both firms would be better off: 
The fishing firm would receive $7 to tolerate a $1 loss in harvest, while the steel mill 
would pay $7 to avoid $13 in abatement cost. The same logic applies to the second ton 
of pollution: The harm to the fishing firm (just above $1) is less than the cost savings 
to the steel firm (just below $13), so the fishing firm can cut a deal to allow 2 tons of 
waste. The bargaining stops at the socially efficient point (200 tons of waste and 300 
tons of abatement) because an additional ton of pollution harms the fishing firm by 
more than it saves the steel firm.
We’ve seen that assigning property rights to either the steel mill or the fishing firm 
generates the socially efficient outcome. Once property rights are assigned, bargaining 
and side payments allow the firms to adjust the level of pollution as long as the marginal 
benefit exceeds the marginal cost. For efficiency purposes, it doesn’t matter who owns 
the lake as long as someone owns it. Of course, the assignment of property rights has 
important equity implications: Whoever owns the lake collects the side payments from 
the party that doesn’t.
Under what circumstances can we rely on Coase bargaining to generate the socially 
efficient outcome? In our example, bargaining is plausible because there are only two 
parties. In contrast, if there were several polluting and fishing firms, bargaining among

atmosphere and then using it to generate heat or electricity. 
The marginal cost of abatement is less than $10 per ton for 
the first 36 million metric tons, and increases at an increas-
ing rate, reaching $150 per ton at 69 million metric tons. It is 
relatively cheap to recover moderate amounts of methane from 
landfills and coal mines and to reduce leaks in the distribution 
of natural gas. As the volume recovered increases, however, 
the abatement systems become progressively more expen-
sive. For example, it is relatively cheap to reduce natural-gas 
leakage by maintaining surface facilities such as pipelines, but 
relatively expensive to reduce venting at production sites.
What is the optimal level of methane abatement? It 
depends on the marginal benefit of abatement. For example, if 
the marginal benefit is $10, the optimum level is about 36 mil-
lion metric tons. But if the marginal benefit is $150, the optimum 
level of abatement is about 69 million metric tons.  Related to 
Exercises 1.3 and 1.4.

Methane is one of the greenhouse gases that contribute to 
global warming. It is released into the atmosphere from land-
fills, natural gas systems, coal mining, and livestock manage-
ment. In this case, abatement of emissions requires methane

all the affected parties would probably be unwieldy. In general, Coase bargaining 
requires a small number of affected parties and small transactions costs (the costs of 
arranging side payments). When the number of affected parties is large, the bargaining 
process won’t work, and the solution to a spillover problem requires a centralized policy 
such as pollution taxes, regulations, or marketable permits. 
Taxing Pollution
The economic approach to pollution is to get producers to pay for the waste they 
generate, just as they pay for labor, capital, and materials. The costs of labor, capital, 
and materials are the private cost of production, the cost borne by the producer of 
the product. The external cost of production is the cost incurred by someone other 
than the producer, for example, the cost associated with health problems and premature 
deaths from sulfur dioxide. The social cost of production is the sum of the private 
cost and the external cost. The idea of a pollution tax equal to the external cost per 
unit of pollution is to “internalize” the externality—to make the producer responsible 
for the external cost of production. When the tax equals the external cost imposed on 
others, the externality is internalized. In the example of sulfur dioxide pollution, the 
appropriate pollution tax is the external cost of $3,500 per ton.
A Firm’s Response to a Pollution Tax
A polluting firm will respond to a pollution tax in the same way it responds to the prices 
of labor and materials. The firm will use the marginal principle to decide how much 
waste to generate and how much to abate. The firm will increase the level of abatement 
as long as the marginal benefit exceeds the marginal cost and stop when the marginal 
benefit equals the marginal cost.
Figure 31.2 shows an electricity producer’s marginal benefits and costs of abating 
SO2. The marginal cost is $2,200 for the first ton abated (point a), and the marginal 
cost increases with the level of abatement to $3,500 for the sixth ton abated (point c) 
and $4,500 for the seventh ton (point d). The marginal cost increases with the amount 
abated because the firm must use progressively more costly means to cut emissions. 
From the firm’s perspective, the benefit of abating pollution is that it can avoid paying

From the perspective of a firm subject to a pollution tax, the marginal benefit of abatement is the $3,500 
pollution tax that can be avoided by cutting pollution by 1 ton. The firm satisfies the marginal principle at 
point c, with 6 tons of abatement, leaving 2 tons of SO2 discharged into the atmosphere.

the pollution tax. The marginal benefit of abatement is the $3,500 savings in pollution 
taxes from abating a ton of SO2 rather than discharging it into the air.
The firm satisfies the marginal principle at point c, with 6 tons of abatement. 
For the first 6 tons abated, the marginal benefit of abatement—avoiding the $3,500 
tax—is greater than or equal to the marginal cost. The firm stops at 6 tons because the 
marginal cost of abating a 7th ton ($4,500, as shown by point d ), exceeds the marginal 
benefit (the $3,500 tax avoided). Instead of paying $4,500 to abate 1 more ton, the firm 
will instead pay the $3,500 tax. 
The Market Effects of a Pollution Tax
Consider the effect of a pollution tax on the market for the product produced by pol-
luting firms. For example, a tax on SO2 increases the cost of producing electricity 
because firms pay for abatement and also pay pollution taxes on any remaining waste 
they generate. As we saw in an earlier chapter on market efficiency, a  tax shifts the 
supply curve upward by the amount of the tax, decreasing the equilibrium quantity and 
increasing the equilibrium price.
Consider the effects of pollution taxes on the market for electricity. The produc-
tion of electricity generates two major pollutants:
• Sulfur dioxide. Electric power plants are responsible for about two-thirds of SO2 
emissions. As we saw earlier in the chapter, the marginal damage from SO2 is 
$3,500 per ton, so that’s the appropriate pollution tax.
• Nitrogen oxides (NOx). Power plants are also responsible for about one-quarter 
of the nation’s NOx emissions, a contributing factor in acid rain and the most 
important factor in urban smog. The study cited earlier in the chapter estimated 
that the appropriate tax for NOx is about $1,100 per ton.
Figure 31.3 shows the effects of pollution taxes in the market for electricity. The 
taxes increase the cost of producing electricity, shifting the supply curve upward. 
The equilibrium moves from point a to point b, where the demand curve intersects 
the new supply curve. According to the electricity study, the pollution taxes would 
increase the price of electricity from $64.90 to $67.60 per megawatt-hour, an increase 
of 4 percent. The price elasticity of demand for electricity is 0.28, so the 4 percent 
increase in price decreases the quantity of electricity demanded by 1.1 percent, from

4,294 to 4,247 megawatt-hours. Like other taxes, the pollution tax is shifted forward 
to consumers in the form of a higher price, and they respond by consuming less of 
the polluting good. When consumers face the full cost of producing electricity, they 
buy less of it.
A pollution tax also changes the production process as firms switch to cleaner 
technology. Figure 31.4 shows the effects of pollution taxes on the energy sources used 
to generate electricity. Producers respond to the taxes by switching to low-sulfur coal, 
which is more expensive but reduces their SO2 taxes. The share of power generated 
with low-sulfur coal increases from 0.43 to 0.53. The taxes increase the cost of using 
coal relative to the cost of using natural gas and nuclear power, so the share of electric-
ity from these other sources increases while the share of power from coal decreases. As 
firms shift to cleaner energy sources, the amount of SO2 and NOx emissions per unit 
of electricity generated decreases.
These pollution taxes decrease the total amount of air pollution for two reasons. 
First, as shown in Figure 31.3, the increase in the price of electricity decreases the 
quantity of electricity demanded by 1 percent. Second, as shown in Figure 31.4, the 
shift to cleaner energy sources means that each unit of electricity generates less pollu-
tion. The combined effect of these two changes is a substantial reduction in pollution: 
SO2 decreases to 11 percent of its initial volume, and NOx decreases to 30 percent of 
its initial volume. An added bonus of the pollution tax is that the government could 
use the revenue from the tax to cut other taxes, for example, the payroll tax or the 
income tax.

Example: A Carbon Tax
An ongoing environmental issue is how to respond to the problem of global warming 
caused by greenhouse gases. One approach is to tax carbon-based fuels. A carbon tax of 
$100 per ton of carbon content would translate into taxes of $0.28 per gallon of gaso-
line, $12 per barrel of oil, and $70 per ton of coal. The tax on coal would be relatively 
high because of its higher carbon content.

part 10
688
A carbon tax would reduce greenhouse emissions in several ways:
• The price of gasoline would increase, causing people to drive less and buy more 
energy-efficient vehicles.
• The tax would increase the price of electricity, decreasing the quantity of elec-
tricity demanded and the quantity of fossil fuels burned.
• The higher price of home heating would cause people to turn down their ther-
mostats and improve the heating efficiency of their homes, perhaps by installing 
energy-efficient windows or more insulation.
• Some electricity producers would switch from coal to natural gas, which has a 
lower carbon content, and thus a lower carbon tax. Others would switch to non-
carbon energy sources such as wind power, solar power, and geothermal sources.
Carbon taxes have been imposed by governments around the world. In Canada, 
the province of British Columbia has a revenue-neutral carbon tax of $30 per ton 
of CO2. The revenue raised from the carbon tax is returned to taxpayers through 
reductions in taxes on personal and business income. Since 2008, per capita fuel 
consumption in the province has decreased by 4.5 percent, and citizens use less 
fuel—and pay lower income taxes—than elsewhere in Canada. According to local 
observers, the tax has been good for the environment and taxpayers, and hasn’t 
harmed the economy.3 In the United States, the city of Boulder, Colorado, has a tax 
on carbon emissions from electricity. In Europe, there are carbon taxes in Britain, 
Finland, and Sweden.

Washing Carbon Out Of The Air
Applying the Concepts #2: What are the possible responses to a pollution tax?
be piped underground or used as feedstock in the production 
of synthetic fuels for transportation. With current technology, 
the cost of carbon washing would be roughly $200 per ton. 
But if the technology for carbon washing develops at the same 
pace as other recent new technologies, the cost per ton could 
drop to roughly $30. At that cost, a tax of roughly $0.25 per 
gallon of gasoline would cover the cost of capturing the CO2 
it generates.
How would a carbon tax affect the incentives for carbon 
washing? Suppose a firm that produces CO2 has a marginal 
abatement cost of $90 per ton and faces a carbon tax of $70 per 
ton. The firm will generate CO2 and pay the tax. But if the cost 
of carbon washing is $50 per ton, the firm could instead offset 
its carbon emissions with a carbon washing machine. The result 
would be a savings of $20 per ton for the firm and less carbon in 
the atmosphere. The carbon tax also provides the incentives for 
new carbon-washing firms to develop. Such a firm would deploy 
a carbon-washing machine and charge a price high enough to 
cover its costs.  Related to Exercise 2.6.

302 (6) (June 2010); David Bielo, “Can Carbon Capture Technology Be Part of the 
Climate Solution?” Yale Environment 360 (September 8, 2014).
One option to address the problem of CO2 in the atmosphere is 
large machines to wash CO2 out of the air. The removal of car-
bon will at least partly offset current emissions, and could actu-
ally be used to reduce the carbon content of the atmosphere 
and restore historic levels of atmospheric carbon.
Several organizations are developing prototype machines 
that, like trees and other vegetation, absorb carbon and thus 
reduce atmospheric carbon. The machines use rotating filters 
to trap and liquify CO2, and are designed to trap from 1 ton to 
hundreds of tons of CO2 per day. The liquified CO2 can then

Traditional Regulation
Although the economic approach to pollution is to get polluters to pay for the waste 
they generate, governments often take a different approach. Under a traditional regu-
lation policy, the government tells each firm how much pollution to abate and what 
abatement techniques to use.
Uniform Abatement with Permits
To illustrate the effects of regulation, consider an area with two electricity genera-
tors, firm L (for low cost) and firm H (for high cost). Suppose that in the absence of 
pollution-abatement efforts, each firm would discharge 2 tons of pollution per hour. 
The government sets a target abatement level of 2 tons of SO2 per hour, divided 
equally between the two firms. Under this uniform abatement policy, the government 
will issue four pollution permits to each firm, forcing each firm to cut pollution from 
2 tons to 1 ton.
Table 31.1 shows the numbers behind the example. The marginal abatement 
cost of firm L is $2,000 and the marginal abatement cost for firm H is $5,000. Under 
the uniform-abatement policy, the total cost of abatement is $2,000 for firm L and 
$5,000 for firm H, for a total of $7,000. Suppose instead the government imposes a 
pollution tax of $3,000 per ton. Firm L will respond by abating 2 tons because the 
marginal cost of abatement ($2,000) is less than the tax. In contrast, firm H will pay 
the tax because the marginal cost of abatement ($5,000) exceeds the tax. When the 
low-cost firm does all the abating, the total cost of reducing pollution by 2 tons is 
only $4,000.
Learning Objective 31.3
Explain the superiority of taxation over 
traditional regulation.
A policy of uniform abatement is inefficient because it does not take advantage of the 
differences in abatement costs between the two firms. In contrast, a pollution tax encour-
ages abatement by the most efficient abaters. When we treat firms equally in terms of 
the consequences of their pollution (each pays the same tax per ton), we get an efficient 
response. The low-cost firm incurs abatement costs to avoid the tax, while the high-cost 
firm incurs tax costs to avoid costly abatement. 
Command and Control
Traditional regulation policies have another dimension that contributes to higher com-
pliance costs. Under a command-and-control policy, the government requires each 
firm to produce no more than a certain volume of pollution and requires the abate-
ment be done with a particular technology. The problem with this approach is that the 
mandated abatement technology—the control part of the policy—is unlikely to be the 
most efficient technology for two reasons:
• The regulatory policy specifies a single abatement technology for all firms. 
Because the producers of a polluting good often use different materials and pro-
duction techniques, an abatement technology that is efficient for one firm may 
be inefficient for others.

• The regulatory policy decreases the incentives to develop more efficient abate-
ment technologies. The command part of the policy specifies a maximum volume 
of waste for each firm, so there is no incentive to cut the volume of waste below 
the maximum allowed. In other words, the benefit of developing new technolo-
gies is relatively small because there is no payoff from using them. In contrast, a 
pollution tax provides the right incentives: If the firm develops a new technology 
that cuts pollution, it will pay less in pollution taxes.
A command-and-control policy causes firms to use inefficient abatement 
technologies, so production costs will be higher than they would be under a 
­pollution tax. 
Market Effects of Pollution Regulations
How do the market effects of pollution regulations compare to the effects of a pollution 
tax? Recall that the uniform abatement policy achieves the same reduction in pollution 
at a higher cost because it doesn’t exploit differences in abatement costs across firms. In 
addition, the control part of command and control may lead to relatively costly abate-
ment techniques because there’s no incentive to develop better ones. This will cause the 
supply curve for the polluting good to shift upward by a larger amount than it would 
with a tax. A larger supply shift causes a larger increase in the equilibrium price and a 
larger reduction in quantity. The inefficiency of regulations is passed on to consumers, 
who pay higher prices.
One advantage of the command-and-control policy is its predictability. The 
policy specifies how much waste each firm can produce, so we can predict the total 
volume of waste. In contrast, we don’t know exactly how firms will respond to the 
pollution tax—they could pollute a little or a lot, depending on the tax and the cost 
of abating pollution—so it is difficult to predict the total volume of waste that will 
be emitted. 
Lesson from Dear Abby: Options for Pollution Abatement
We’ve seen that one problem with traditional environmental policy is that it is inflexible. 
It doesn’t allow firms to use the most efficient abatement methods available. An example 
of different abatement strategies comes from advice columnist Abigail Van Buren.4 A 
person with the moniker “Dreading Winter” sought advice about how to deal with a 
pollution problem. Her neighbors heated their home with a wood-burning stove, and 
the smell and smoke from the wood fire gave Dreading Winter burning eyes, a stuffy 
nose, and painful sinuses. She offered the neighbors $500 to stop burning wood, but 
they declined the offer. The readers of “Dear Abby” offered the following suggestions 
to Dreading Winter:
• Buy the neighbors a catalytic add-on for the wood stove or a wood-chip gasifier 
for an oil furnace. In either case, there would be much less air pollution from 
burning wood.
• Soak a towel in water, swish it around the room, and watch the smoke disappear.
• Leave a saucer of vinegar in each room to eliminate the smoke odor.
• Pay your neighbors to hire a chimney sweep to clean their flue.
• Seal and caulk your windows to keep the smoke outside at a cost of less than 
$500.
• Use the $500 to purchase an air purifier for your home.
These suggestions demonstrate a fundamental idea behind environmental eco-
nomics: There is usually more than one way to deal with a pollution problem. The 
economic question is “What is the most efficient and least costly way to reduce the 
problem?” In some cases, it may be more efficient to prevent pollution (by modifying 

Chapter 31 • External Costs and Environmental Policy
691
the stove or switching to an alternative fuel) than to let pollution happen and then 
clean up the environment (by using an air purifier). In other cases, cleanup will be more 
efficient than prevention. 
Marketable Pollution Permits
In recent years, policymakers have developed a new approach to environmental policy. 
The approach uses marketable pollution permits, sometimes called pollution allow-
ances. Here is how a government runs a system of marketable pollution permits:
• Pick a target pollution level for a particular area.
• Issue just enough permits to meet the pollution target.
• Allow firms to buy and sell the permits.
In the policy world, this is known as a cap-and-trade system: The government “caps” 
the total emissions by issuing a fixed number of permits, and then allows firms to trade 
the permits.
Voluntary Exchange and Marketable Permits
Making pollution permits marketable is sensible because it allows mutually beneficial 
exchanges between firms with different abatement costs. This is another illustration of 
the principle of voluntary exchange.

Options For Reducing CO2 Emissions From International Shipping
Applying the Concepts #3: What is the most efficient way to reduce pollution?
International shipping is responsible for about 3% of global 
CO2 emissions, and there are many ways to reduce (abate) 
CO2 emissions. As a tool for comparing the cost of alterna-
tive reduction methods, policy analysts compute the marginal 
abatement cost (MAC) of each method, defined as the cost per 
ton of CO2 abated. For low-cost methods such as propeller 
maintenance and weather-sensitive routing, the fuel savings 
cover the cost of the abatement method, so the MAC for these 
methods is close to zero. For other abatement methods, the 
MAC is higher:
• Switch from diesel to gas-powered engines: $20 per ton
• Reduce speed and increase fleet size: $90 per ton
• Install fixed sails and wings to tap wind power: $105 per ton
Related to Exercise 3.7.

A voluntary exchange between two people makes both people better off.

part 10
692
Firms will buy and sell pollution permits only when an exchange will make both 
firms better off. This happens when the firms have different abatement costs.
To illustrate the effects of marketable permits, let’s return to the example of the 
two electricity generators with different abatement costs shown in Table 31.1. Suppose 
the government issues each firm one permit (one less than the initial level of pollution). 
In other words, the government will reduce pollution by 2 tons. Can the two firms 
make a deal for a permit?
• Firm H is willing to pay a maximum of $5,000 for a permit because that’s how 
much it costs to abate a ton of pollution.
• Firm L is willing to accept a minimum of $2,000 for a permit because that’s how 
much it costs to abate a ton of pollution.
Firm H is willing to pay up to $5,000 and firm L is willing to accept as little as 
$2,000, so there is an opportunity for mutually beneficial exchange. If the two firms 
split the difference, the price of a permit is $3,500, and each firm gains $1,500 from 
the transaction. Firm H pays $3,500 to save $5,000 on abatement cost, for a savings 
of $1,500. Firm L gets $3,500 but pays an additional $2,000 in abatement cost, for a 
benefit of $1,500.
How does the marketability of permits affect the total cost of abatement? In our 
example, the total cost with nonmarketable permits is $7,000, including $2,000 for firm 
L and $5,000 for firm H. In contrast, when a single firm does all the abating, the cost 
for 2 tons of abatement is $4,000 (2 tons times $2,000 per ton). The savings of $3,000 
equals the gap between the abatement cost of the high-cost and low-cost firm. Making 
the permits marketable exploits differences in abatement costs across firms, so we get 
the same level of abatement at a lower total cost.
The first program of marketable pollution permits, started in 1976 by the U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency, allowed limited trading of permits for several air-
borne pollutants. Trading was later extended to lead in gasoline (in 1985) and to the 
chemicals responsible for the depletion of the ozone layer (in 1988).
The Clean Air Act of 1990 established a system of marketable pollution permits 
(also known as allowances) for SO2. Under the cap-and-trade program, in 1990 the 
government issued permits for SO2 emissions based on a firm’s emission levels 10 years 
earlier. Each company initially received enough permits to discharge between 50 and 
70 percent of the volume it had discharged a decade earlier, and over time the number 
of permits will decrease. Firms can also trade the permits. For example, if one firm has 
an abatement cost of $140 and a second firm has an abatement cost of $180, the low-
cost firm could sell a permit to the high-cost firm at a price of $160, giving each firm a 
benefit of $20: The low-cost firm gets $160 for a permit and incurs an abatement cost 
of $140; the high-cost firm pays $160 for a permit but saves $180 in abatement cost. 
A report from the National Acid Precipitation Assessment Program (NAPAP) showed 
that being able to buy and sell permits lowered firms’ total cost of abatement by 15 to 
20 percent.
Each year the Environmental Protection Agency issues permits to existing SO2 
sources but withholds some for auction on the Chicago Board of Trade. In 2008, a 
total of 125,000 permits were auctioned at an average price of $390 per ton. Individu-
als and environmental groups are allowed to buy the permits and, if they wish, reduce 
pollution by withdrawing them from the market. In 2001 a total of 31 permits went to 
schools and environmental groups. 
Supply, Demand, and the Price of Marketable Permits
We can use a model of supply and demand to represent the market for pollution per-
mits. Figure 31.5 depicts a trading system introduced in the Los Angeles basin for smog 
pollutants such as NOx. The supply curve for permits is vertical at the fixed number of 
permits provided by the government. The demand for permits comes from firms that 
can use a permit to avoid paying for pollution abatement, and the willingness to pay 
for a permit equals the savings in abatement costs. In Figure 31.5 the demand curve 

Chapter 31 • External Costs and Environmental Policy
693
for permits is negatively sloped, meaning that the larger the number of permits avail-
able, the lower the willingness to pay for a permit. This is sensible because with more 
permits and pollution, the marginal cost of abatement will be relatively low. With a 
fixed supply of 100 permits in 1994, the equilibrium price, shown by the intersection 
of the demand curve and the 1994 supply curve at point a, is $7.
Under Los Angeles’s smog program, the number of NOx permits decreased each 
year, and in 2003 reached its goal of cutting NOx discharges to 30 percent of the level 
attained 9 years earlier.5 In Figure 31.5, the decrease in the number of permits from 100 
to 30 shifts the supply curve to the left, increasing the equilibrium price of permits from 
$7 at point a to $21 at point b. Polluters in Los Angeles responded to the higher permit 
prices by abating more. The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power installed 
abatement equipment—at a cost of $40 million—because abatement was cheaper than 
buying pollution permits. Libbey Glass Company installed low-pollution burners in its 
plant, dropping its emissions below the volume allowed by its permits. The company 
sold its extra permits to other firms, generating income for Libbey. The firms that 
bought the permits from Libbey were able to continue production using their existing 
abatement equipment.

How do technological advances in abatement technology affect the price of pollu-
tion permits? A pollution permit allows a firm to avoid paying for abatement, and the 
higher the abatement cost that can be avoided, the larger the amount a firm is willing to 
pay for a permit. A technological innovation that decreases abatement costs will encour-
age firms to use the new technology to abate pollution rather than buying permits that 
allow pollution. As a result, the demand curve for permits shifts downward and to the 
left, and the equilibrium price of permits decreases.

External Costs from Automobiles
The use of automobiles generates three types of external costs. First, as we saw in 
Chapter 1, a person who uses a congested highway slows down other travelers, impos-
ing time costs on other people. Second, automobiles generate air pollution, so drivers 
impose external costs on people sensitive to air pollutants. The third externality is 
motor-vehicle accidents—collisions with other vehicles, bicycles, and pedestrians. In 
this part of the chapter, we explore various policy responses to these externalities.
External Costs from Pollution
Ozone pollution, more commonly known as smog, is one of our most persistent envi-
ronmental problems. Smog results from the mixing of several pollutants, including 
nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, and volatile organic compounds. Smog causes health 
problems, triggering asthma attacks in the 15 million people in the United States 
who suffer from asthma and causing other respiratory problems, leading to premature 
deaths. Smog also retards plant growth and decreases agricultural productivity. Because 
of health and other problems created by smog, the EPA has established standards for 
smog concentrations in urban areas. Nonetheless, in many cities ozone pollution levels 
rise above these healthful levels.
The Breathmobile provides a visible reminder of the health effects of smog. Started 
in Los Angeles in 2000, the mobile asthma clinic, housed in a 34-foot recreational 
vehicle, provides free diagnosis and treatment for asthmatic schoolchildren. The clinic 
identifies and treats children who experience aggravated asthma symptoms on smoggy 
days. The Breathmobile program started in low-income neighborhoods and has since 
spread to other cities.6
The automobile is by far the biggest source of smog-causing pollutants. We cur-
rently use a command-and-control approach to regulate automobile pollution: The 
EPA tells automakers what abatement equipment to install in cars. The equipment 
does not control the total emissions of the car, just the pollution per mile driven. If 
people buy cleaner cars but then drive more miles, total emissions can actually increase.

Weather And The Price Of Pollution Permits

materials, pulp and paper, electricity generators, and heat gen-
erators. The demand for the allowances is determined by a 
number of factors, including the level of economic activity, fuel 
prices, and the weather.
The Nordic countries rely heavily on hydroelectric power to 
generate electricity. In a dry year, the amount of power generated 
by hydroelectric plants is relatively low, and the Nordic countries 
shift to coal-fired plants. For example, in the exceptionally dry 
year of 1996, the emissions from power and heat generation in 
Denmark were roughly 70 percent higher than the emissions in 
1990, a relatively wet year. A dry year will generate a relatively 
high demand for CO2 emissions and thus increase the equilibrium 
price of the allowances.  Related to Exercises 4.5 and 4.10.
SOURCES: Based on European Climate Exchange, www.ecx.eu.
The European Climate exchange is a market for the CO2 allow-
ances issued to European Union (EU) countries under the EU 
cap-and-trade system. The equilibrium price of an ­allowance 
is determined by the interplay of supply and demand. The EU 
determines the total quantity of allowances issued, and distrib-
utes the allowances to organizations in the energy-­intensive 
industries, including iron and steel production, building 

Chapter 31 • External Costs and Environmental Policy
695
The economic approach to air pollution is to internalize the external cost with a 
pollution tax. Under such a tax, a car owner would have the car tested at the end of the 
year to determine how much pollution it generated per mile and then pay a tax equal 
to the miles driven times the external cost per mile. For example, if the external cost 
for a particular car is $0.02 per mile and the mileage for the year is 10,000 miles, the 
pollution tax for the year would be $200. The pollution tax would encourage people 
to buy cleaner cars, maintain their emissions equipment, drive less, and use alternative 
modes of transportation. The tax is consistent with the idea that people should pay the 
full cost of driving their automobiles, including the external costs.
One alternative to a direct pollution tax on automobile travel is a gasoline tax. 
According to a recent study, smog-related damages from automobiles average about 
$0.02 per mile driven, which translates to an average of $0.40 per gallon of gasoline.7 
Burning gasoline also contributes to global warming, and if the appropriate carbon tax 
is $100 per ton of carbon, the associated gasoline tax would be about $0.28 per gallon. 
Adding the $0.40 tax for smog damage and the $0.28 tax for global warming, the gaso-
line tax would be $0.68 per gallon. This tax would be added to the current gasoline taxes 
(a federal tax of $0.18 and state taxes that average about $0.22), which pay for highway 
construction and maintenance. A gasoline tax would be inferior to a real pollution tax 
because a driver’s gasoline tax bill would not depend directly on pollution, so there 
would be less incentive to drive cleaner cars.
Figure 31.6 shows the market effects of a gasoline tax equal to $0.68 per gallon. 
The tax shifts the supply curve upward by the amount of the tax, as shown by points 
a and b. The new equilibrium is shown by point c, with an equilibrium price of $2.00 
(up from $1.60) and an equilibrium quantity of 80 million gallons (down from 100 
million gallons). The increase in price decreases the quantity demanded as consumers 
drive fewer miles, switch to alternative travel modes—bus, train, bicycle, walking—and 
switch to more fuel-efficient cars.
▲  Figure 31.6  The Market Effects of a Gasoline Tax
A gasoline tax of $0.68 per gallon shifts the supply curve upward by the amount of the tax and increases 
the equilibrium price by $0.40. The tax is shifted forward onto consumers, who pay $0.40 more per gal-
lon, and backward onto input suppliers, who receive lower prices for crude oil.

The equilibrium price rises by $0.40, which is less than the $0.68 tax. As we saw 
earlier in the book, a tax is shifted forward to consumers in the form of a price hike 
($0.40 in this example) and backward onto input suppliers in the form of lower prices 
for inputs. The decrease in the quantity of gasoline produced will decrease the demand

for crude oil, decreasing its price. In other words, part of the gasoline tax will be borne 
by the people and governments who own crude oil. 
External Costs from Congestion
As we saw in Chapter 1, the typical urban commuter wastes about 47 hours per year in 
slow traffic and wastes $84 worth of fuel. The economic approach to congestion is to 
internalize the external cost by imposing a tax on drivers equal to the external costs they 
impose on others. To compute the appropriate tax per mile driven, we compute the 
change in total travel time caused by one additional car on the highway and multiply 
the change in travel time by the opportunity cost of travel time. For peak travel in the 
typical large metropolitan areas, the external cost is about $0.21 per mile traveled, so a 
commuter who makes a 10-mile trip during peak travel times would pay a congestion 
tax of $2.10. During off-peak periods when highways are less crowded, the external cost 
is much lower, around $0.04 per mile driven. When traffic volume is low enough that 
everyone can travel at the legal speed limit, the external cost is zero, so there would be 
no congestion tax.
Modern technology allows the efficient collection of congestion taxes. Under a 
vehicle identification system (VIS), each car is equipped with a transponder—an elec-
tronic device that allows sensors along the road to identify a car as it passes. The system 
records the number of times a vehicle uses a congested highway and sends a congestion 
bill to the driver at the end of the month. For example, a driver who travels 10 miles 
along a congested highway 20 times per month would pay a monthly congestion bill 
of $42.00 (20 times $2.10). The alternative approach is to use anonymous debit cards 
to charge for driving on congested roads.
The use of congestion taxes and other time-sensitive pricing of highways is spread-
ing. Singapore uses Electronic Road Pricing (ERP), a debit-card system with charges 
that increase with the level of congestion. In Toronto, users of the Express Toll Road 
pay fees that depend on the distance traveled and time of day. The per-kilometer toll 
is $0.10 (Canadian) during peak periods, $0.07 during other weekday times, and $0.04 
on the weekend. Along some highways in Southern California, drivers can pay a fee to 
use lanes normally reserved for carpools. The toll varies in “real time” from $0.50 to 
$4.00, depending on the level of congestion, and is highest from 7:00 a.m. to 8:00 a.m. 
and 4:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. 
External Costs from Collisions
A third externality from the use of the automobile comes from motor-vehicle acci-
dents—collisions with other vehicles, bicycles, and pedestrians. In the United States, 
the annual cost of property damage, injuries, and deaths from traffic collisions is about 
$300 billion per year. On average, the driver who causes an accident incurs about two-
thirds of the costs, leaving one-third as an external cost imposed on others. On aver-
age, the collision-related external cost of travel is about 4.4 cents per mile driven. By 
way of comparison, the fuel cost per mile is about 10 to 15 cents. The direct approach 
to internalize this externality would be to impose a tax of 4.4 cents per vehicle-mile 
traveled, a VMT tax. Such a tax would improve traffic safety by reducing the number 
of miles driven.
Consider two alternatives to the VMT tax. First, the premium for automobile 
insurance could be based on miles driven rather than being a fixed amount per year. A 
person who drove less would pay less for insurance, which is sensible because he or she 
would be less likely to have an accident and impose an external cost on someone else.
Second, a gasoline tax could be imposed. The basic problem is that a person’s 
gas-tax bill depends on the amount of gasoline consumed, not the number of miles 
driven and the external cost of collisions. Gas mileage varies across vehicles, and 
a person in a car with better gas mileage would pay less than the external cost of 
collisions.

Young Drivers And Collisions
Applying the Concepts #5: What is the external cost of young drivers?
the age of the driver. The external cost per mile is 11 cents for 
young drivers (age less than 25 years), 3.4 cents for middle-aged 
drivers (age 25 to 70), and 5.4 cents for older drivers. A precise 
VMT tax would involve a higher tax rate for young drivers and 
generate a relatively large decrease in the miles driven by drivers 
with the highest collision rates and external costs.  Related to 
Exercises 5.6 and 5.7.

Table 31.2   The External Accident Costs for Different Vehicles and Driver Ages
The theme of this chapter is 
that the best way to control 
pollution and other external 
costs is to rely on the exchange 
principle and markets. A pollu-
tion tax internalizes the exter-
nal cost of pollution, causing 
firms to cut the pollution per 
unit of output and consumers 
to buy less of a polluting prod-
uct. A cap-and-trade system 
for emissions achieves a pol-
lution target at the lowest pos-
sible cost because the firms 
with the lowest cost do most 
of the abatement. The external 
costs from automobiles could be internalized with taxes on pollu-
tion, congestion, and miles driven. Here are the main points of the 
chapter:
1.	 The optimum level of pollution abatement is where the marginal 
benefit equals the marginal cost.
2.	 A tax on the emissions of electricity generators decreases total 
emissions as firms switch to cleaner fuels and consumers buy 
less electricity at the higher price.
3.	 Compared to a pollution tax, traditional pollution regulations lead 
to higher production costs and higher product prices.
4.	 Allowing firms to buy and sell pollution permits reduces the cost 
of abatement because low-cost firms do more of the abatement.
5.	 Urban smog is a continuing problem, in part because the tradi-
tional command-and-control policies are less effective than an 
annual automobile pollution tax.
6.	 The external cost from traffic congestion could be internalized 
with a tax that varies with the level of traffic congestion.
7.	 The external cost from traffic collisions could be internalized with 
a tax that varies with the likelihood of causing a collision.

The Optimal Level of Pollution
Use the marginal principle to describe the optimum level 
of pollution.
1.1	 The optimal level of pollution abatement is the level 
at which the 
 of abatement equals the 
 of abatement.
1.2	 The marginal cost of abatement typically 
 
(increases/decreases) with the level of abatement.
1.3	 The marginal cost of abating methane 
 at 
a(n) 
 rate. If the marginal benefit of meth-
ane abatement is $150 per metric ton, the optimal level 
of abatement is about 
 million metric tons. 
(Related to Application 1 on page 684.)
1.4	 Optimal Pollution Abatement. Suppose the marginal 
benefit of pollution abatement is constant at $12 per 
unit. The marginal cost of abatement is $2 for the first 
unit abated and increases by $2 for each additional unit, 
to $4 for the second unit, $6 for the third unit, and 
so on. Draw the marginal-benefit and marginal-cost 
curves and show the optimum level of pollution abate-
ment. (Related to Application 1 on page 684.)

to play the violin, much to the dismay of her house-
mates. Vivian and her roommates are willing to bar-
gain over her practice time, and will split the difference 
between the willingness to pay for noise reduction and 
the willingness to accept it. The following table shows 
her marginal benefits from playing for one to five hours 
as well as the marginal external cost incurred by her 
housemates (constant at $5 per hour).

Taxing Pollution
Describe the role of taxation in promoting efficient 
environmental policy.
2.1	 The private cost of production includes the amount a 
firm pays for 
, 
, and 
.
2.2	 The external cost of production is the cost incurred by 
.
2.3	 The social cost of production equals the 
 
cost plus the 
 cost.
2.4	 A pollution tax will decrease the amount of pollution 
a firm generates if the tax exceeds the 
 of 
abatement.
2.5	 A pollution tax decreases the volume of pollution in 
two ways, by decreasing 
 and decreasing 
.
2.6	 If a CO2 washing machine can trap CO2 at a cost of $30 
per ton, a gasoline tax of roughly 
 per gallon 
of gasoline would cover the cost of capturing the CO2 
it generates. (Related to Application 2 on page 688.)
2.7	 Arrows up or down: A carbon tax will shift the sup-
ply curve for home heating oil 
, causing the 
equilibrium price to 
 and the equilibrium 
quantity to 
.
2.8	 The Market Effects of a Carbon Tax. Consider the 
market for gasoline. In the initial equilibrium, the price 
is $2.00 per gallon and the quantity is 100 million gal-
lons. The price elasticity of demand is 0.70, and the 
price elasticity of supply is 1.0. Suppose a carbon tax 
shifts the supply curve upward by $0.34 and to the left 
by 17 percent.
a.	 Use a graph to show the effects of the tax on the 
equilibrium price and quantity of gasoline.
b.	After reviewing the price-change formula in the ear-
lier chapter on elasticity, compute the new price and 
quantity. The new price is $
 per gallon 
and the new quantity is million 
 gallons.
c.	 Consumers pay $
 of the $0.34 tax and 
producers pay the remaining $
 of the tax.

mental to the health of both smokers and non-smokers.

“secondhand” smoke in public areas. Due to this nega-
tive externality, smokers are being forced to compen-
sate their behavior through legislative measures, such 
as the imposition of a tax on cigarettes. Suppose the 
price of a pack of cigarettes is $6.00 and the average 
social cost of smoking is $10.00 in a country.
a.	 Determine the optimal retail price of a pack of ciga-
rettes and compare it to the current price. Is the 
current level of cigarette consumption too high or 
too low? Why?
b.	If excise taxes are imposed on cigarettes, are these 
taxes set at the optimal level? Briefly explain.
c.	 Assuming that the social cost per cigarette pack does 
not change with a fall in demand, what should be the 
correct amount of an additional tax on cigarettes?
d.	Suppose demand is relatively inelastic while supply 
is relatively elastic in this market. Who will bear 
more tax incidence, producers or consumers?
Traditional Regulation
Explain the superiority of taxation over traditional regulation.
3.1	 Compared to a pollution tax, a uniform-abatement 
policy is 
 (more/less) efficient because it does 
not exploit differences in 
 across firms.
3.2	 The “command” part of a command-and-control pol-
lution policy specifies a 
 for each firm.
3.3	 A command-and-control policy is likely to be ineffi-
cient because it requires firms to use 
.
3.4	 A pollution tax encourages firms to develop more 
­efficient abatement technology. 
 (True/False)
3.5	 Arrows up or down: A switch from a pollution-tax 
policy to a uniform-reduction policy will shift the 
supply curve of the polluting product 
 and 
 the equilibrium price.
3.6	 The lesson from the Dear Abby column is that some-
times 
 is more efficient than 
, and 
sometimes the reverse is true.
3.7	 Arrange the following CO2 abatement techniques for 
international shipping in order of increasing MAC 
(marginal abatement cost): reduce speed, switch to 
gas-powered engines, propeller maintenance, tap wind-
power with sails and wings. (Related to Application 3 
on page 691.)
3.8	 Options for Abating Gasoline Pollution. Your pro-
duction of gasoline generates a negative externality to 
the society. Suppose an unregulated market leads to 
an equilibrium price of $4 per gallon and a quantity 
of 150 million gallons. If the market is regulated by 
imposing a constant pollution tax of $0.72 per gallon, 
the new equilibrium price is $4.40 and quantity is 142 
million gallons. Consumers pay $0.32 of the tax and 
you pay the remaining $0.40. They are willing to pay a 
maximum of $7 per gallon and your production cost is 
$2 per gallon. 
a.	 Draw a graph depicting the above information.
b.	In the regulated market, the equilibrium price and 
quantity are $
 and 
 gallons, 
respectively. How much is your producer surplus?
c.	 If you are required to use clean technology due to 
the government’s environmental policy, how much 
would your producer surplus be?
d.	Which regulation is more efficient, the pollution tax 
or the environmental policy? Why?
3.9	 Regulations Eliminate a Market? Consider a market 
in which the initial equilibrium quantity of a polluting 
good is 20 tons.
a.	 Use a graph to show the effects of a pollution tax 
that decreases the equilibrium quantity to 12 tons.
b.	Consider a command-and-control policy that gen-
erates the same volume of pollution as the pollu-
tion tax but decreases the equilibrium quantity of 
the polluting good to zero. Use a graph to show the 
effects of the command-and-control policy.
Marketable Pollution Permits
Describe the virtues of marketable pollution permits and the 
factors that determine their price.
4.1	 Under a system of marketable pollution permits, a firm 
with 
 (low/high) abatement costs will buy 
permits from a firm with 
 (low/high) abate-
ment costs.
4.2	 Arrow up or down: A switch from regular pollution 
permits to marketable permits 
 the total cost 
of abatement.
4.3	 A decrease in the supply of marketable pollution permits 
will shift the supply curve for permits to the 
 
and the 
 equilibrium price of permits.
4.4	 Arrows up or down: A technological advance that 
decreases abatement costs will 
 the demand 
for marketable pollution permits and 
 the 
equilibrium price.
4.5	 Dry weather in the Nordic countries will 
 the 
demand for CO2 allowances and 
 the equi-
librium price. (Related to Application 4 on page 694.)
4.6	 Split the Difference for a Pollution Permit. Con-
sider two firms, each of which is issued three market-
able pollution permits. For firm H, the marginal cost 
of abatement is $190. For firm L, the marginal cost of 
abatement is $130.
a.	 Is there room for a mutually beneficial exchange of 
one permit? If so, which firm will buy a permit and 
which firm will sell a permit?
b.	If the two firms split the difference, what’s the price 
of a permit?

700
c.	 Suppose that after the exchange of one permit, the 
marginal cost of abatement for the firm that sold the 
permit is $170 and the marginal cost of the firm that 
bought the permit is $150. Will the firms exchange 
another permit, or are they done trading?
d.	What is the savings in abatement cost from allowing 
firms to buy and sell a permit?
4.7	 Reforestation versus Abatement. Suppose your firm 
commits to reducing greenhouse gases by 11 tons per 
year. You can pay for a reforestation project that offsets 
your emissions at a cost of $7 per ton of carbon offset. 
Or you can modify your production cost to abate pollu-
tion. Your marginal cost of abating the first ton is $3; the 
marginal cost increases by $1 for each additional ton, to 
$4 for the second ton, $5 for the third ton, and so on.
a.	 What’s the best combination of reforestation offsets 
and abatement?
b.	How much money does your firm save by using the 
offsets?
4.8	 No Permits Exchanged? A state issued marketable 
permits for sulfur dioxide emissions to several electric-
ity generators. Most of the permits were given to the 
utilities with the oldest generating facilities. One year 
later, none of the permits had been bought or sold. 
What could explain the absence of permit exchanges?
4.9	 Lower Abatement Cost and Permit Prices. Suppose 
new technology decreases the cost of abating pollu-
tion by half. Depict graphically the implications of the 
decrease in abatement cost on the equilibrium price 
of marketable permits. Use Figure 31.5 on page 693 
as a starting point, with an initial permit price of $21 
(point b). What’s the new equilibrium price?
4.10	 Consider the demand for CO2 allowances in the Euro-
pean Union. The supply of allowances is fixed, and the 
initial price is $20 per ton. Suppose that dry weather in the 
Nordic countries increases the demand for allowances by 
6 percent, and the price elasticity of demand for permits is 
2.0. Predict the new equilibrium price, and illustrate with 
a graph. (Related to Application 4 on page 694.)
External Costs from Automobiles
List three external costs associated with automobiles.
5.1	 A pollution tax on automobiles provides an incentive to 
buy 
, maintain 
, drive 
, 
and use alternative 
.
5.2	 Arrows up or down: A gasoline tax will shift the supply 
curve for gasoline 
, causing the equilibrium 
price to 
 and the equilibrium quantity to 
.
5.3	 A gasoline tax will be shifted forward to 
 
and backward to 
, such as the suppliers of 
.
5.4	 To internalize the external cost associated with 
automobile emissions that cause urban smog, 
the appropriate gasoline tax is about 
 
($0.20/$0.40/$0.80/$1.00) per gallon.
5.5	 To internalize the external cost associated with traffic 
collisions, the appropriate VMT tax is about 
 
($0.01/$0.02/$0.04/$0.20) per mile.
5.6	 The external accident cost per mile for the typical 
young driver is about 
 (1/3/6/11/15) cents, 
compared to 
 (1/3/6/11/15) cents for a driver 
between the ages of 25 and 70. (Related to Application 5  
on page 697.)
5.7	 Youngsters Pay to Drive. The demand for automobile 
travel by the typical young driver (age less than 25 years) 
is linear, with a vertical intercept of $1.00 per mile and 
a horizontal intercept of 200 miles per week. Initially, 
the cost of automobile insurance is a fixed weekly sum, 
independent of mileage. The average cost of driving—
for gasoline, oil, maintenance, and repair—is constant at 
$0.20 per mile. (Related to Application 5 on page 697.)
a.	 Use a graph to show the driver’s choice of how many 
miles to drive, labeled as point a.
b.	Use the data in Table 31.2 on page 697 in the appli-
cation “Young Drivers and Collisions” to show the 
socially efficient outcome, labeled as point b.
Pollution Permits
In this pollution-permit experiment, students play the role 
of paper firms that buy or sell pollution permits. The class is 
divided into groups of three to five students, with each group 
representing a firm that produces 1 ton of paper per period. 
The instructor provides each firm with data about its cost of 
production. The cost depends on how much waste the firm 
generates: The smaller the volume of waste, the higher the 
production cost. Here is an example:
Each firm receives three pollution permits for each of 
the five trading periods. A firm that does not sell any of its 
Econom ic Experim ent
permits to other firms has the right to generate 3 gallons of 
waste in that period. A firm that sells one of its three permits 
can generate only 2 gallons of waste, and a firm that buys a 
permit from another firm can generate 4 gallons of waste.

At the beginning of each of the five trading periods, firms 
meet in the trading area to buy or sell pollution permits for that 

701
day. Each firm can buy or sell one permit per day. Once a trans-
action has been arranged, the buyer and the seller inform the 
instructor of the transaction, record the transaction on their 
report cards, and then leave the trading area. The firm’s 
objective is to maximize profit, and in each trading period we 
­compute the firm’s profit with the following equation:
profit = price of paper - production cost
+ revenue from permit sold - cost of permit purchased
In each period, a firm will either buy or sell a permit, so we 
compute the firm’s profit with just three numbers. For exam-
ple, using the production cost numbers shown in the table, 
if the price of paper is $50 per ton and a firm buys a permit 
for $5 and generates 4 gallons of waste, the firm’s profit is
profit = $50 - $20 + $0 - $5 = $25
If another firm sells a permit for $5 and generates two gallons 
of waste, the firm’s profit is
profit = $50 - $36 + $5 - 0 = $19
For the fourth and fifth trading periods, several environ-
mental groups have the option of buying pollution permits. 
Each environmental group is given a fixed sum of money 
to spend on permits, and its objective is to get as many 
permits as possible, reducing the total volume of pollution 
in the process.

Chapter 32 • The Labor Market and the Distribution of Income
703
U
p to this point in the book, we have discussed the markets for final goods and 
services. In this chapter, we switch to the market for one of the factors of 
production: labor. Labor costs are responsible for about three-fourths of pro-
duction costs, and for most people labor income is by far the most important source 
of income. We use a model of demand and supply to see how wages are determined 
and why wages differ between college graduates and high school graduates, men and 
women, and people in different occupations. We also take a look at recent changes in 
the distribution of income and the effects of government tax and transfer policies on 
poverty and the distribution of income.
The Demand for Labor
We can use demand and supply curves to show how wages are determined and exam-
ine how changes in the labor market affect wages and employment. We start with the 
demand side of the labor market, looking first at how an individual firm can use the 
key principles of economics to decide how many workers to hire.
The demand for labor and other productive inputs is different from the demand 
for consumer products such as iPods, books, haircuts, and pizza. Firms use work-
ers to produce the products demanded by consumers, and so economists say that 
labor demand is a “derived demand.” That is, it is determined by, or derived from, 
the demand for the products that workers produce. As we’ll see in this chapter, the 
demand for labor is determined by the demand for consumer products and the price 
of those products.
Labor Demand by an Individual Firm in the Short Run
Consider a perfectly competitive firm that produces rubber balls. Because this firm is 
perfectly competitive, it takes the price of its output and the prices of its inputs as given. 
Because it hires a tiny fraction of the workers in the labor market, it takes the market 
wage as given and can hire as many workers as it wants at that wage. In addition, the 
firm produces a tiny fraction of the rubber balls sold in the market, so it takes the price 
of its output as given. Let’s say the price of rubber balls is $0.50.
Consider the firm’s hiring decision in the short run, defined as the period during 
which at least one input—for example, its factory—cannot be changed. We can use 
two of the key principles of economics to explain the firm’s hiring decision. Recall the 
marginal principle.
Learning Objective 32.1
Explain why competition generates 
wages equal to marginal revenue 
product.
M a r g i n a l  P r i n c i p l e 
Increase the level of an activity as long as its marginal benefit 
exceeds its marginal cost. Choose the level at which the marginal 
benefit equals the marginal cost.
The firm will pick the quantity of labor at which the marginal benefit of labor 
equals the marginal cost of labor. It can hire as many workers as it wants at the mar-
ket wage, so the marginal cost of labor equals the hourly wage. If the wage is $8 per 
hour, the extra cost associated with one more hour of labor—the marginal cost—is $8, 
regardless of how many workers the firm hires.
What is the marginal benefit of labor? The firm hires labor to produce balls, so the 
marginal benefit equals the monetary value of the balls produced with an additional hour 
of labor. Table 32.1 shows how to compute the marginal benefit associated with different 
quantities of labor. The first two columns show the relationship between the number of 
workers and the quantity of balls produced. Recall the principle of diminishing returns.

part 11
704
As we saw earlier in the book, the marginal product of labor, the change in output 
from one additional unit of labor, typically rises for the first few workers and then 
eventually decreases. To simplify matters, we’ll assume diminishing returns start to 
occur with the second worker. As shown in the third column of Table 32.1, the mar-
ginal product of labor decreases as the number of workers increases, from 26 for the 
first worker, to 24 for the second worker, and so on.
The marginal benefit of labor equals the marginal-revenue product of labor 
(MRP), which is defined as the extra revenue generated by one additional unit of labor. 
To compute the MRP, we multiply the marginal product of labor by the price of output 
($0.50 per ball in this example):
MRP = marginal product * price of output
Figure 32.1 shows the marginal-revenue product curve. Because the marginal 
product drops as the number of workers increases, the MRP curve is negatively sloped, 
falling from $11 for the third worker (point a) to $8 for the fifth worker (point b), and 
so on.
A firm can use its MRP curve to decide how much labor to hire at a particular 
wage. In Figure 32.1, the marginal-cost curve is horizontal at the market wage ($8). 
The perfectly competitive firm takes the wage as given, so the marginal-cost curve 
is also the labor-supply curve faced by the firm. The marginal principle is satis-
fied at point b, where the marginal cost equals the marginal-revenue product. The 
firm will hire five workers because for the first five workers, the marginal benefit 
(the MRP) is greater than or equal to the marginal cost (the $8 wage). It would not 
be sensible to hire another worker because the additional revenue from the sixth 
worker ($6) would be less than the $8 additional cost of that worker. If the wage 
increases to $11, the firm will satisfy the marginal principle at point a, hiring only 
three workers.
The MRP curve is also the firm’s short-run demand curve for labor, which 
shows the relationship between the wage and the quantity of labor demanded in the 
short run, when the firm cannot change its production facility. The demand curve 
answers the following question: At each wage, how many workers does the firm want 
to hire? We’ve already used the MRP curve to answer this question for two different

Suppose that output is produced with two or more inputs and we 
increase one input while holding the other inputs fixed. Beyond 
some point—called the point of diminishing returns—output will 
increase at a decreasing rate.

wages ($11 and $8), and we can do the same for any other wage. Because the MRP 
curve is a marginal-benefit curve, and the firm uses the marginal principle to decide 
how much labor to hire, the MRP curve is the same as the firm’s demand curve for 
labor. If you pick a wage, the MRP curve tells you exactly how much labor the firm 
will demand at that wage.
What sorts of changes would cause the demand curve to shift? To draw the 
labor-demand curve, we fix the price of the output and the productivity of workers. 
Therefore, an increase in the price of the output will increase the MRP of workers, 
shifting the entire demand curve for labor to the right: At each wage, the firm will 
hire more workers. This is shown in Figure 32.2. An increase in the price of balls 
shifts the labor-demand curve to the right. At a wage of $8, the firm hires seven 
workers instead of five. Similarly, if workers become more productive, the increase 
in the marginal product of labor will increase the MRP and shift the demand curve to 
the right. Conversely, a decrease in price or labor productivity will shift the demand 
curve to the left. 
Market Demand for Labor in the Short Run
To draw the short-run market demand curve for labor, we add the labor demands of 
all the firms that use a particular type of labor. In the simplest case, all firms are iden-
tical, and we simply multiply the number of firms by the quantity of labor demanded 
by the typical firm. If there were 100 firms and each hired five workers at a wage of 
$8, the market demand for labor would be 500 workers. Similarly, if the typical firm 
hired three workers at a wage of $11, the market demand would be 300 workers. In 
the more realistic case of nonidentical firms, we use the same technique used for 
the market demand for a consumer good. We draw the individual demand curves 
and then sum them horizontally to get the market demand curve. In other words, 
for each wage we add up the labor demands of all the firms to get the aggregate or 
market demand. 
▲  Figure 32.1  The Marginal Principle and the Firm’s Demand for Labor
Using the marginal principle, the firm picks the quantity of workers at which the marginal benefit (the

Labor Demand in the Long Run
Recall that in the long run, firms can enter or leave the market and firms already in the 
market can change all their inputs, including their production facilities. The long-run 
demand curve for labor shows the relationship between the wage and the quantity of 
labor demanded over the long run, when the number of firms in the market can change 
and firms in the market can modify their production facilities.
Although there are no diminishing returns in the long run, the market demand 
curve is still negatively sloped. As the wage increases, the quantity of labor demanded 
decreases for two reasons:
• The output effect. An increase in the wage will increase the cost of produc-
ing balls, and firms will pass on at least part of the higher labor cost to their 
consumers: Prices will increase. According to the law of demand, firms will 
sell fewer balls at the higher price, so they will need less of all inputs, includ-
ing labor.
• The input-substitution effect. An increase in the wage will cause the firm 
to substitute other inputs for labor. At a wage of $4, it may not be sensible to 
use much machinery in the ball factory, but at a wage of $20, it may be sen-
sible to mechanize the factory, using more machinery and fewer workers. 
This substitution of other inputs for labor decreases the labor input per unit 
of output.
The input-substitution effect decreases the labor input per unit of output while the 
output effect decreases total output. The two effects operate in the same direction, so 
the market demand curve is negatively sloped.
The notion of input substitution applies to other labor markets as well. For the 
most graphic examples of factor substitution, we can travel from a developed country—
such as the United States, Canada, France, Germany, or Japan—to a less-developed 
country in South America, Africa, or Asia. Wages are much lower in the less-developed

An increase in the price of the good produced by workers increases the marginal revenue product at 
each quantity of workers, shifting the demand curve to the right. At each wage, the firm will demand 
more workers. For example, at a wage of $8, the demand for labor increases from five workers (point b) 
to seven workers (point d).

countries, so production tends to be more labor intensive. In other words, labor is 
less costly relative to machinery and equipment, so labor is substituted for these other 
inputs. Here are some examples:
• Mining. U.S. firms use huge earth-moving equipment to mine for minerals; 
firms in some less-developed countries use thousands of workers digging by 
hand.
• Furniture. Firms in developed countries manufacture furniture with sophisti-
cated machinery and equipment; firms in some less-developed countries make 
furniture by hand.
• Accounting. Accountants in developed countries use computers and sophisticated 
software programs; some accountants in less-developed countries use simple cal-
culators and ledger paper. 
Short-Run versus Long-Run Demand
How does the short-run demand curve for labor compare to the long-run demand curve? 
There is less flexibility in the short run because firms cannot enter or leave the market 
and they cannot modify their production facilities. As a result, the demand for labor is 
less elastic in the short run. That means the short-run demand curve is steeper than the 
long-run demand curve. In the chapter on perfect competition we used the same logic to 
explain why the short-run supply curve for a product (plain cotton T-shirts) was  steeper 
than the long-run supply curve for the product.

agents, meaning that they are free to negotiate a contract with 
any MLB team. Given the competition between teams for the 
services of free agents, their salaries are close to their MRPs. In 
contrast, two types of players are not allowed to change teams, 
and the limited competition for their services means that they 
earn relatively low salaries:
1	 Journeymen (3−6 years in the league) are restricted to a 
single team, but can enter salary arbitration to change 
their salaries.
2	 Apprentices (up to 3 years in the league) are restricted to a 
single team and cannot change their salaries.
Given the immobility of journeymen and apprentices, we expect 
them to be paid less than their MRPs. According to a recent 
study, the average MRP of journeymen is about $1.08 million, 
which is about 17 percent higher than the average journeyman 
salary. For apprentices, the average MRP is about $810,000, 
which is about 3.6 times the average apprentice salary. Related 
to Exercise 1.7.

a Player’s Marginal Revenue Product,” Economic Inquiry 37 (1999), pp. 369−381.
In 2011, the average salary in Major League Baseball (MLB) 
was $3.3 million. Are players really worth that much? A team 
will pay $3.3 million for a player only if the player’s marginal 
revenue product (MRP) is at least $3.3 million. The MRP of a 
player equals his contribution to the firm’s total revenue from 
ticket sales and television contracts. People are willing to pay for 
winners, and a player whose performance increases the team’s 
winning percentage increases its revenue from tickets and TV. 
For example, a player with a relatively high slugging percent-
age increases the team’s winning percentage, increasing the 
revenue from ticket sales and TV.
A recent study shows that for some types of players, the 
salary is less than the player’s MRP. Some MLB players are free

The Supply of Labor
The labor-supply curve answers the following question: How many hours of labor will 
be supplied at each wage? When we speak of a labor market, we are referring to the 
market for a specific occupation in a specific geographical area. Consider the supply for 
nurses in the hypothetical city of Florence. The supply question is, “How many hours 
of nursing services will be supplied at each wage?” To answer that question, we must 
think about how many nurses are in the city and how many hours each nurse works.
The Individual Labor-Supply Decision: How Many Hours?
Let’s start with an individual’s decision about how many hours to work. The decision to 
work is a decision to sacrifice some leisure time for money: Each hour of work reduces 
leisure time by 1 hour. Therefore, the demand for leisure is the flip side of the supply 
of labor. The price of leisure time is the income sacrificed for each hour of leisure, 
that is, the hourly wage. We know from earlier chapters that an  increase in the price 
of a good has two effects: a substitution effect and an income effect. An increase in the 
wage—the price of leisure—has two effects on the demand for leisure.
Consider first the substitution effect for leisure demand. The worker faces a 
trade-off between leisure time and consumer goods such as music, books, food, and 
entertainment. For each hour of leisure time Leah takes, she loses 1 hour of work time, 
and her income drops by an amount equal to the wage. Therefore, she has less money 
to spend on consumer goods. For example, if the wage is $8 per hour, each hour of 
leisure decreases the amount of income available to spend on consumer goods by $8. 
When the wage increases to, say, $10, Leah will sacrifice more income—and consumer 
goods—for each hour of leisure she takes. Given the larger sacrifice of consumer goods 
per hour of leisure time, she will demand less leisure. That means she will work more 
hours and earn more money for consumer goods. In other words, as the wage increases, 
she will substitute income—and the consumer goods it buys—for leisure time.
Consider next the income effect for leisure demand. For most people, leisure is 
a normal good in the sense that the demand for leisure increases as real income 
increases. An increase in the wage increases Leah’s real income in the sense that she 
can afford more of all goods, including leisure time. Suppose Leah has a total of 100 
hours per week to divide between leisure and work. At a wage of $10, she works 36 
hours and has 64 hours of leisure. She also earns $360 ($10 per hour times 36 hours of 
work) and spends that amount on consumer goods. If her wage increases to $15, her 
real income increases because she can have more consumer goods and more leisure 
time. For example, if she worked only 30 hours, she could buy $450 worth of consumer 
goods ($15 per hour times 30 hours) and have 70 hours of leisure (100 hours per week 
minus 30 hours of work). The increase in real income causes Leah to consume more 
of all normal goods, including leisure time. The increase in real income causes her to 
demand more leisure and supply less labor.
In the labor market, the income and substitution effects of an increase in wages 
operate in opposite directions. The substitution effect decreases the desired leisure time, 
while the income effect increases the desired leisure time. Therefore, we can’t predict 
whether an increase in the wage will cause a worker to demand more leisure time (supply 
less labor) or less leisure (supply more labor). 
An Example of Income and Substitution Effects
A simple example will show why we can’t predict a worker’s response to an increase 
in the wage. Suppose each nurse in Florence initially works 36 hours per week at an 
hourly wage of $10 and the wage increases to $12. The following are three reasonable 
responses to the higher wage:
1	 Lester works fewer hours. If Lester works 30 hours instead of 36 hours, he 
gets 6 hours of extra leisure time and still earns the same income per week 
($360 = 30 hours * $12 per hour).

2	 Sam works the same number of hours. If Sam continues to work 36 hours per week, he 
gets an additional $72 of income ($2 per hour * 36 hours) and the same amount 
of leisure time.
3	 Maureen works more hours. If Maureen works 43 hours instead of 36 hours, she 
sacrifices 7 hours of leisure time but earns a total of $516, compared to only $360 
at a wage of $10 per hour.
Empirical studies of the labor market confirm that each of these responses is reason-
able. When the wage increases, some people work more, others work less, and others 
work about the same amount. At the market level, the aggregate response to an increase 
in the wage varies across markets. 
The Market Supply Curve for Labor
Now that we know how individual workers respond to changes in wages, we’re ready 
to consider the supply side of the labor market. The market supply curve for labor 
shows the relationship between the wage and the quantity of labor supplied. In 
Figure 32.3, the market supply curve for labor is positively sloped, consistent with 
the law of supply: There is a positive relationship between the wage (the price of 
labor) and the quantity of labor supplied, ceteris paribus. An increase in the wage 
affects the quantity of nursing supplied in three ways:
1	 Hours worked per employee. When the wage increases, some nurses will work 
more hours, some will work fewer hours, and some will work the same number 
of hours. We don’t know for certain whether the average number of work hours 
will increase, decrease, or stay the same, but the change in the average number of 
hours worked is likely to be relatively small.
2	 Occupational choice. An increase in the nursing wage will cause some workers to 
switch from other occupations to nursing and motivate more new workers to pick 
nursing over other occupations.
3	 Migration. Some nurses in other cities will move to Florence to earn the higher 
wages offered there.

▲  Figure 32.3  Supply, Demand, and Labor Market Equilibrium
At the market equilibrium shown by point a, the wage is $15 per hour and the quantity of labor is 16,000 
hours. The quantity supplied equals the quantity demanded, so there is neither excess demand for labor 
nor excess supply of labor.

The second and third effects reinforce one another, so an increase in the wage 
causes movement upward along the market supply curve. If the wage of Florence nurses 
increases from $10 to $15 per hour, the quantity of nurses supplied increases from 
8,000 hours per day (point b) to 16,000 hours per day (point a). Although individual 
workers may not work more hours as the wage increases, the supply curve is positively 
sloped because an increase in the wage changes workers’ occupational choices and 
causes migration. 
Labor Market Equilibrium
We’re ready to put demand and supply together to think about equilibrium in the labor 
market. A market equilibrium is a situation in which there is no pressure to change the 
price of a good or service. Figure 32.3 shows the equilibrium in the market for nurses. 
The supply curve intersects the demand curve at point a, so the equilibrium wage is 
$15 per hour and the equilibrium quantity is 16,000 hours of nursing per day. At this 
wage, there is neither an excess demand for labor nor an excess supply of labor, so the 
market has reached an equilibrium.
Changes in Demand and Supply
How would a change in the demand for nurses affect the equilibrium wage of nurses? 
We know from Chapter 4 that a change in demand causes the equilibrium price and the 
equilibrium quantity to move in the same direction: An increase in demand increases the 
equilibrium price and quantity, whereas a decrease in demand decreases the equilibrium 
price and quantity. For example, suppose the demand for medical care increases. Nurses 
help to provide medical care, so an increase in the quantity of medical care demanded 
will shift the demand curve for nurses to the right: At each wage, firms will demand more 
hours of nursing services. As shown in Figure 32.4, an increase in demand increases the 
equilibrium wage and the equilibrium quantity of nursing services.

earned by taxi drivers. A recent study of the taxi market in 
New York City shows that an increase in the regulated fare 
(an increase in the wage) actually decreases the quantity of 
labor supplied. In 2004 a 19 percent increase in the regulated 
fare decreased the miles driven per cabbie by 5.6 percent. 
Overall, the elasticity of miles driven (quantity of labor sup-
plied) with respect to the fare per mile (the wage) is -0.22. 
In other words, a 10 percent increase in the wage decreases 
the quantity of labor supplied by 2.2 percent. Related to

Taxi drivers have a lot of flexibility in choosing their work 
hours, and we can readily observe their response to an 
increase in the wage. An increase in the taxi fare, which 
is regulated by cities, represents an increase in the wage

How would a change in supply of nurses affect the equilibrium wage of nurses? 
We know from Chapter 4 that a  change in supply causes price and quantity to move in 
opposite directions: An increase in supply decreases the equilibrium price but increases 
the equilibrium quantity, whereas a decrease in supply increases the equilibrium price 
but decreases the equilibrium quantity. Suppose a new television program makes nursing 
look like an attractive occupation, causing a large number of young people to become 
nurses rather than accountants, lawyers, or doctors. The supply curve for nurses will shift 
to the right: At each wage, more nursing hours will be supplied. The equilibrium wage 
will decrease, and the equilibrium quantity will increase. 
The Market Effects of the Minimum Wage
We can use the model of the labor market to show how various public policies, such as the 
federally mandated minimum wage, affect total employment. In 2012 the federal minimum 
wage was $7.25 per hour. Figure 32.5 shows the effects of a minimum wage on the market 
for restaurant workers. The market equilibrium is shown by point a: The supply of restau-
rant workers equals demand at a wage of $6.05 and a quantity of 50,000 worker hours per 
day. Suppose a minimum wage is established at $7.25 per hour. At this wage, the quantity 
of labor demanded is only 49,000 hours (point b on the demand curve). In other words, 
the minimum wage decreases the quantity of labor restaurants use by 1,000 hours per day.
What are the trade-offs associated with the minimum wage? For restaurant work-
ers and restaurant diners, there is good news and bad news:
• Good news for some restaurant workers. Some workers keep their jobs and 
receive a higher wage ($7.25 per hour instead of $6.05 per hour).
• Bad news for some restaurant workers. Some workers lose their jobs. If the 
typical workday for restaurant workers is 5 hours, the loss of 1,000 hours of 
restaurant work per day translates into a loss of 200 jobs.
• Bad news for diners. The increase in the wage increases the cost of producing 
restaurant meals, increasing the price of meals.
There are winners and losers from the minimum wage. Workers who keep their jobs 
gain at the expense of other workers and at the expense of diners. A recent study 
­suggests that a 10 percent increase in the minimum wage decreases the number of 
minimum wage jobs by about 1 percent.2

An increase in the demand for nursing services shifts the demand curve to the right, moving the equilib-
rium from point a to point b. The equilibrium wage increases from $15 to $17 per hour, and the equilib-
rium quantity increases from 16,000 hours to 19,000 hours.

Why Do Wages Differ across Occupations?
There is substantial variation in wages across occupations. Most professional athletes 
earn more than medical doctors, who earn more than college professors, who earn more 
than janitors. We’ll see that the wage for a particular occupation will be high if the sup-
ply of workers in that occupation is small relative to the demand for those workers. This 
is shown in Figure 32.6, where the supply curve intersects the demand curve at a high 
wage. The supply of workers in a particular occupation could be small for four reasons:
1	 Few people with the required skills. To play professional baseball, people must be 
able to hit balls thrown at them at about 90 miles per hour. The few people who 
have this skill are paid a lot of money because baseball owners compete with one

day (point b). Although some workers receive a higher wage, others lose their jobs or work fewer hours.

another for skillful players, bidding up the wage. The same logic applies to other 
professional athletes, musicians, and actors. The few people who have the skills 
required for these occupations are paid high wages.
2	 High training costs. The skills required for some occupations can be acquired 
only through education and training. For example, the skills required of a medi-
cal doctor call for medical school training, and legal skills must be acquired in law 
school. If it is costly to acquire these skills, a relatively small number of people will 
become skilled, and they will receive high wages. The higher wage compensates 
workers for their training costs.
3	 Undesirable working conditions. Some occupations have undesirable working 
conditions, and workers demand higher wages as compensation. Wages are higher 
for jobs that are dirty or stressful or require people to work at odd hours.
4	 Danger. Some jobs are dangerous, and wages are higher to compensate for the 
risk of injury or death. The workers with the greatest risk of losing their lives on 
the job are lumberjacks, boilermakers, taxicab drivers, and mine workers. To com-
pensate for the higher risk of getting killed on the job, steelworkers receive a wage 
premium of 3.7 percent. In the United States, the average job fatality rate is 1 in 
25,000 workers per year. For a worker who faces twice the average fatality rate, 
the wage is about 1 percent higher. The wage premium for jobs with an annual 
injury rate of 2 percent is 1.15 percent for men and 3.68 percent for women.3
5	 Artificial barriers to entry. Government and professional licensing boards restrict 
the number of people in certain occupations, and labor unions restrict their mem-
bership. These supply restrictions increase wages. 
The Gender Pay Gap
Why do women, on average, earn less than men? In the United States, the typical 
woman earns about 80 percent as much as the typical man.4 A recent study explored 
several factors that contribute to the gender pay gap.5 The study observed a gap of 
about 20 percent among workers aged 26 to 34, and identified four factors that con-
tribute to the gender gap:
• Difference in worker skills and productivity. On average, women have less edu-
cation and work experience, so they are less productive and thus receive lower 
wages. An important factor in the lower level of work experience among women 
is that many women interrupt their careers to raise children. The study con-
cluded that lower productivity is the most important factor in the gender gap.
• Differences in occupational preferences. Wages vary across occupations: Clerical 
and service occupations receive lower wages than craft and professional occu-
pations. Compared to men, women express stronger preferences for low-wage 
occupations, such as clerical and service occupations, and weaker preferences for 
some high-wage occupations, such as craft and operator occupations. In contrast, 
men have slightly stronger preferences for high-wage professional and technical 
occupations. On balance, the general orientation of women toward low-wage 
occupations contributes to the gender gap.
• Occupational discrimination. Given the variation in wages across occupations, if 
employers have a bias against hiring women for high-paying occupations, women 
will receive lower wages. The study shows that on average, women are less suc-
cessful than men in attaining their desired occupations, and this occupational dis-
crimination by employers explains between 7 and 25 percent of the gender gap.
• Wage discrimination. If employers pay women less than their equally produc-
tive male counterparts, women’s wages will be lower. The results of the study on 
this issue are mixed, with some evidence that wage discrimination is a significant 
factor in the gender pay gap.

part 11
714
The general conclusion of the study is that differences in productivity and occu-
pational status are the most important factors in the gender pay gap. It appears that 
the relatively large number of women in low-paying occupations results both from the 
occupational preferences of women and employer discrimination that inhibits occupa-
tional attainment for women. 
Racial Discrimination
What about differences in earnings by race? African American males who work full 
time earn 73 percent as much as their white counterparts, while African American 
females earn 85 percent as much as their white counterparts. Hispanic males earn 
65 percent as much as white males, while Hispanic females earn 78 percent as much 
as white females.6 For both males and females, part of the earnings gap is caused 
by differences in productivity: On average, whites have more education and work 
experience, so they are paid higher wages. However, part of the wage gap is caused 
by racial discrimination. Some African American and Hispanic workers are paid 
lower wages for similar jobs, and others are denied opportunities to work in some 
high-paying jobs.
How much of the earnings gap is caused by discrimination? Recent studies suggest 
that racial discrimination decreases the wages of African American men by about 13 
percent and that these earnings differences have decreased over the last few decades 
and are now small enough that “most of the disparity in earnings between blacks and 
whites in the labor market of the 1990s is due to the differences in skills they bring to 
the market, and not to discrimination within the labor market.”7 The differences in 
skills brought to the labor market are caused by a number of factors, including past 
discrimination that has inhibited the acquisition of job skills and differences in educa-
tional opportunities. For example, in urban areas about one-third of African American 
high school students have above-average scores on reading and math exams, compared 
to about two-thirds of white students. 
Why Do College Graduates Earn Higher Wages?
In 2009, the college premium—the increase in earnings from a college degree—was 
74 percent. A college education provides the skills necessary to enter certain occupa-
tions, so a college graduate has more job options than a high school graduate. Both high 
school grads and college grads can fill jobs that require only a high school education, so 
the supply of workers for these low-skill jobs is plentiful, and the equilibrium wage for 
these jobs is low. In contrast, there is a smaller supply of workers for jobs that require 
a college education, so the wages in these high-skill jobs are higher than the wages for 
low-skill jobs. This is the learning effect of a college education: College students learn 
the skills required for certain occupations, increasing their human capital.
A second explanation of the college premium requires a different perspective on 
college and its role in the labor market. Suppose certain skills are required for a particu-
lar job, but an employer cannot determine whether a prospective employee has these 
skills. For example, most managerial jobs require the employee to manage time effi-
ciently, but it is impossible for an employer to determine whether a prospective 
employee is a good manager of time. Suppose that these skills are also required to 
complete a college degree. For example, to get passing grades in all your classes, you 
must be able to use your time efficiently. When you get a college degree, firms will 
conclude that you have some of the skills they require, so they may hire you instead of 
a high school graduate. This is the signaling effect of a college education: People who 
complete college provide a signal to employers about their skills. This second explana-
tion suggests that colleges simply provide a testing ground where students can reveal 
their skills to potential employers.
The most important factor in the doubling of the college premium over the last few 
decades is technological change. Changes in technology have increased the demand for

college graduates relative to the demand for other workers. In all sectors of the economy, 
firms are switching to sophisticated machinery and equipment that require highly skilled 
workers. Consequently, the share of jobs that require a college education has increased 
steadily, increasing the demand for college graduates. Of course, the supply of college 
graduates has increased too, but not by as much as demand. Because the increase in 
demand is large relative to the increase in supply, the wages of college graduates have 
increased. Another factor in the growing college premium is the pace of technological 
change. Workers with more education can more easily learn new skills and new jobs, so 
firms are willing to pay more for college graduates. 
Labor Unions and Wages
A labor union is a group of workers organized to increase job security, improve work-
ing conditions, and increase wages and fringe benefits.8 Acting as a group, union 
members have some control over the wages and fringe benefits they receive. In the 
United States, about one in eight workers in the United States belongs to a union, 
down from about one in three workers in the 1950s. The unionization rate is 8.2 
percent for private-sector workers, compared to 39.8 percent for public-sector work-
ers. In the rest of the world, unionization rates vary widely, from 2 percent in India to 
78 percent in Sweden.
There is evidence that unions raise the wages of union workers. For the United 
States, the consensus is that union workers earn 10 to 20 percent more than nonunion 
workers doing the same work. As we saw earlier in the chapter, an increase in the wage 
decreases the quantity of labor demanded because of the output effect and the input-
substitution effect. Given the trade-off between wages and employment, an increase 
in the union wage increases the income of the workers who keep their jobs, but also 
decreases the number of union jobs.
One response to the trade-off between wages and jobs is to impose work rules that 
increase the amount of labor required to produce a given quantity of output. This is 
called featherbedding. One example of featherbedding is requiring a minimum crew 
size, which forces a firm to hire more workers than it needs to perform a particular task. 
For example, the typical unionized airline hires three workers to guide an airplane into 
the gate, while nonunion airlines use only two workers. In the past, railroad unions 
forced railroads to use firemen (whose job was to shovel coal) on diesel-powered 
engines, which don’t use coal.
Although featherbedding forces the firm to use more labor per unit of output, it 
also decreases the quantity of output produced. A firm that hires workers it doesn’t need 
will have higher production costs, resulting in a higher price for its product. Consum-
ers respond to a higher price by purchasing less output, so although the firm may use 
more labor per unit of output, it sells less output. If output falls by a large amount, the 
quantity of labor demanded by the firm will actually decrease.
We’ve seen that unions lead to higher wages and may impose work rules that 
reduce productivity. In other words, unions increase production costs. What are the 
possible benefits of unions? First, unions may increase worker productivity by facilitat-
ing communication between workers and managers. A second possible benefit of unions 
is lower turnover among workers. If a worker is unhappy with a job, one option is to 
quit. From the firm’s perspective, this is costly because the firm loses an experienced 
worker and must train a new one. A dissatisfied worker who belongs to a union has a 
second option: The worker can use the union as an intermediary to discuss job issues 
with managers. This sort of communication can solve problems before they become so 
severe that the worker quits. There is evidence that firms whose workers are in unions 
have lower turnover rates, in part because they facilitate communication between work-
ers and managers. These lower turnover rates lead to lower training costs and a more 
experienced workforce. The savings from less turnover is equivalent to a 1 to 2 percent 
reduction in costs.

The Distribution of Income
In 2009 the median household income in the United States was $49,777. In other 
words, half of households earned more than $49,777, and half earned less. There 
is substantial variation in household income, with some households earning much 
more and others earning much less. In this part of the chapter, we discuss the extent 
of income inequality in the United States and recent trends in the distribution of 
income. We also explore the effects of several government policies on the distribu-
tion of income.
Income Distribution in 2007
Market income is defined as all earnings received from labor and capital markets. It 
includes wages and salaries, as well as earnings from bonds, stocks, and real estate. 
Market income does not account for the effects of government tax and transfer pay-
ments. We discuss the effects of government tax and transfer programs in the next 
section of the chapter.
Table 32.2 shows the distribution of market income in 1979 and 2007. Both years 
were peak economic years, when the nation’s economy was thriving. To compute the 
numbers in a column of the table, we take four steps:
1	 Rank the nation’s households according to market income: The household with 
the highest income is at the top of the list, and the household with the lowest 
income is at the bottom of the list.

The Beauty Premium
Applying the Concepts #3: What explains differences in wages?
are considered beautiful or handsome, and the beauty premium 
is larger for men than for women. The penalty for bad looks is 
about 8 percent for the 10 percent of workers who are consid-
ered plain or unattractive. The beauty premium and the plain 
penalty have been observed in other countries and within spe-
cific occupations such as lawyers.
Why do beautiful people earn more income? According to 
biologists, beauty is a marker for underlying characteristics such 
as health and intelligence, and beautiful people start with a slight 
edge in the labor market. Beautiful people get more opportuni-
ties to learn through experience, and they also acquire better 
professional contacts. Because of these wider opportunities, a 
small difference in innate characteristics can be amplified into 
a large difference in earnings. Another factor in the beauty pre-
mium is that some workers and consumers simply like dealing 
with attractive people, so there is a higher demand for beautiful 
workers, resulting in higher wages. Related to Exercises 3.10 
and 3.11.

Market,” American Economic Review 84 (2001), pp. 1174–1194; “To Those That

How does physical attractiveness affect earnings? Studies of 
the U.S. labor market show that beautiful people earn more than 
people of average looks, and unattractive people earn less. The 
beauty premium is 5 percent for the 33 percent of workers who

2	 Divide the households into five groups, or “quintiles”: The lowest fifth includes 
the poorest 20 percent of households (the lowest 20% of the list); the second fifth 
is the next poorest 20 percent, and so on.
3	 Compute each group’s income by adding up the income received by all the house-
holds in the group.
4	 Compute each group’s share of market income (the numbers in the second and 
third columns of the table) by dividing the group’s income by the nation’s total 
income.
In the case of perfect income equality, each quintile would earn 20 percent of income.
The third column of Table 32.2 shows the distribution of market income in 2007. 
As shown near the top of the table, the lowest fifth earned only 2.5 percent of the total 
income. If we combine the first two quintiles, the lowest 40 percent of households 
earned 9.8 percent of total income. In contrast, the top quintile (percentiles 80–100) 
earned about 60 percent of total income. At the very top, households in the top 1 per-
cent earned 21.3 percent of market income. In other words, the one percenters earn 
over 20 times the income they would earn in the case of perfect income equality. In 
contrast, households in the first quintile earn one-eighth of the income they would earn 
in the case of perfect equality.
What explains the substantial differences in market income? There are three key 
reasons for income inequality in a market-based economy:
1	 Differences in labor skills and effort. Some people have better labor skills—more 
human capital—than others, so they earn higher wages. Labor skills are deter-
mined by innate ability, education, and work experience. In addition, some people 
work longer hours or at more demanding jobs, so they earn more income.
2	 Luck and misfortune. Some people are luckier than others in investing their 
money, starting a business, or picking an occupation. Among the unlucky people 
are those who develop health problems that make it difficult to earn income. 
Among the lucky people are those who inherit wealth and earn income by invest-
ing their inheritance.
3	 Discrimination. Some people are paid lower wages or have limited opportunities for 
education and work because of their race or gender. 
Recent Changes in the Distribution of Income

quintile was 18.3 percent, compared to 43.3 for the fourth quintile and 75.6 percent for 
the top quintile. For the one percenters, the growth rate was 277.5 percent.
The second and third columns in the table show the changes in the income shares 
over the 28-year period. The shares of the bottom 99 percent of households (quintiles 
1 through 4 and percentiles 80−99) decreased, while the share of the top 1 percent 
increased. Although the income share of the top quintile increased (from about 50 
percent to about 60 percent), the increase in income was concentrated among the top 
1 percent of households.
Over the period 1979−2007, all major sources of income became less evenly 
distributed. Consider the income share of the bottom 80 percent of households. As 
shown in Table 32.2, the share of overall income earned by the 80 percenters decreased 
from 51.4 percent to 41.1 percent. This group’s share of labor income decreased from 
60 ­percent to 50 percent, while its share of income from capital, business, and capital 
gains decreased from 41 percent to 25 percent. Another factor in the increased concen-
tration of income is that the share of income from capital gains (the most concentrated 
source of income) increased.
Why has labor income become less evenly distributed? It appears that the most 
important reason for growing inequality is what labor economists call an “increase 
in the demand for skill.”9 In the labor market, the demand for highly skilled (highly 
educated) workers has increased relative to the demand for less-skilled (less-educated) 
workers. As a result, the wage gap between the two groups has widened. Over the 
last few decades, the college premium doubled, and the advanced-degree premium—
the increase in earnings from getting postgraduate degrees—has increased as well. At 
the low end of educational attainment, the dropout penalty—the income loss from

Trade-Offs From Immigration
Applying the Concepts #4: Who benefits from the immigration of low-skilled workers?
earns less income than the average native, immigrants compete 
with low-skill natives, decreasing their wages. On the benefit 
side, the decrease in the wages of low-skill labor decreases 
production costs and product prices, so consumers benefit. In 
general, we expect low-skill workers to lose as a result of immi-
gration because the lower wages will dominate the benefits of 
lower consumer prices. In contrast, we expect high-skill workers 
to benefit from lower prices.
Economists have estimated the net effect of immigration on 
the U.S. economy. George Borjas shows that immigration to the 
United States has a small positive effect, with the losses in wages 
of low-skilled workers more than offset by gains to consumers and 
firms. This conclusion is consistent with the idea that exchange 
increases efficiency and the size of the overall economic pie. Stud-
ies of the most recent wave of immigration suggest that immi-
gration decreases the wages of high-school dropouts and other 
low-skilled workers. Related to Exercises 4.5, 4.6, and 4.7.

of Economic Literature 32 (1994), pp. 1667–1717; George Borjas, “The Labor 
Demand Curve Is Downward Sloping: Reexamining the Impact of Immigration on 
the Labor Market,” Quarterly Journal of Economics 108 (2003), pp. 1335–1374;

Theory and Evidence from the U.S.” (Working Paper No. 11672, NBER, 2005).
Since about 1850, international migration has played an impor-
tant role in labor markets. In the first wave of immigration, from 
1850 to 1913, over a million people migrated to the Americas 
each year. Most were from European countries. After several 
decades of war and economic depressions, massive immigra-
tion resumed in 1945, and most of the immigrants were from 
less-developed countries. The most recent wave of immigration 
started in 1990 and has increased the supply of labor to the U.S. 
economy by about 10 percent per decade.
Immigration creates winners and losers within the economy. 
The increase in the supply of labor decreases wages for the 
native workers who have the same skill level as the immigrants. 
Because the average U.S. immigrant has less education and

dropping out of high school, rather than simply graduating from high school—has 
nearly doubled.
Why did the demand for skill increase over the last three decades? Economists 
have explored this issue, and provide evidence for two key factors:
• Technological change. Advances in technology have simultaneously decreased 
the demand for less-educated workers and increased the demand for college 
graduates and people with advanced degrees. While the new technology has 
made it possible to replace many low-skilled workers with “smart” machines and 
computers, it has also increased the demand for workers who have the education 
and skills required to produce the new technology and use it.
• Increased international trade. An increase in international trade means more 
exports and imports. Trade allows developed countries like the United States to 
easily export goods produced with high-skilled labor and import goods produced 
with low-skilled labor. As a result, the expansion of international trade in the last 
three decades has increased the demand for high-skilled workers and decreased 
the demand for low-skilled workers in the United States.
Economists have not yet reached a consensus on the relative importance of these 
two factors. 
Public Policy and the Distribution of Income
Government policies affect the distribution of income through taxes and transfer poli-
cies. In this part of the chapter, we explore the broad effects of federal tax and transfer 
policies on the distribution of income. We also discuss specific policies designed to 
boost the income and economic prospects of the poor.
Effects of Tax and Transfer Policies on the Distribution of Income
Table 32.3 shows the shares of income for the five quintiles before and after accounting 
for federal taxes and transfers. The federal policies redistribute income from the top 
fifth, whose income share decreases by about 7 percentage points (from 59.9 percent 
to 52.7 percent) to the lowest four-fifths, which collectively gain about 7 percentage 
points. The largest gain occurs for the lowest fifth (2.6 percentage points), and the 
other three quintiles gain between 0.9 and 1.9 percentage points.
In the last few decades, the redistributional effects of federal tax and transfer poli-
cies have diminished. Between 1979 and 2007, the government took less from high-
income households and gave less to low-income households for two reasons:

is determined by income) such as Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF). 
In contrast, an increasing share was spent on Medicare, a program that is not 
means-tested. Households in the lowest quintile received only 36 percent of all 
federal transfer payments in 2007, down from 54 percent in 1979.
2	 The overall average federal tax rate decreased from 22 percent in 1979 to 20 per-
cent in 2007. The average rate for the individual income tax, which is responsible 
for the bulk of the redistributional effects of federal taxes, decreased from over 11 
percent in 1979 to less than 10 percent in 2007. 
Poverty and Public Policy
The U.S. government defines a poor household as one with a total income less than the 
amount required to satisfy the “minimum needs” of the household. The government 
estimates a minimum food budget for each type of household and multiplies the food 
budget by three to get the official poverty budget. A household with income lower 
than the official poverty budget is considered poor. In 2010 the poverty budget was 
$22,113 for a two-adult, two-child household, which is less than half of the median 
household income. In 2010, almost 47 million people were below the poverty line, or 
15.2 percent of the population.
Table 32.4 shows the incidence of poverty among different groups of people. For 
each group, the poverty rate equals the percentage of people in that group who live in 
households with incomes lower than the official poverty budget.
1	 Race. The poverty rates for both blacks and Hispanics are more than twice the 
poverty rates for whites.
2	 Type of family. The poverty rate for female-headed households is about five times 
the poverty rate for households headed by a married couple.
3	 Age. The poverty rate is relatively low for the aged, and relatively high for children.
Education is a key factor in determining wages, and poverty rates are lower for 
more-educated workers. As we saw earlier in the chapter, college graduates earn 74 
percent more than high school graduates. The poverty rate for college graduates is 3 
percent, compared to 9 percent for high school graduates. For high school dropouts, 
the poverty rate is 22 percent.
The government uses a number of programs to provide assistance to the poor. In 
decreasing order of spending, they include medical care (about half of spending), cash 
assistance (about one-fifth of spending), food assistance, and housing assistance. These 
programs, broadly defined as “welfare programs,” are means-tested programs, mean-
ing that only people whose incomes fall below a certain level receive assistance. These 
means-tested programs

provides assistance to those whose income 
falls below a certain level.

programs reduce the poverty rate by a substantial margin. The poverty rates shown in 
Table 32.4 account for cash transfers to poor households. Cash transfers decrease the 
overall poverty rate by about one-third. The poverty rates listed in Table 32.4 do not 
account for the value of noncash programs such as food stamps, which decrease poverty 
rates by roughly two percentage points.
In 1996, the overhaul of federal antipoverty programs ended decades of policy 
based on the notion that poor families are entitled to cash and in-kind assistance. The 
Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 eliminated 
the entitlement of poor families to receive cash assistance. The federal government now 
provides block grants to states to provide Temporary Aid to Needy Families (TANF), 
with restrictions on what recipients must do to qualify for assistance and limits on how 
long they can receive assistance:
• A recipient must participate in work activities, defined as employment, on-the-
job training, work experience, community service, or vocational training.
• After a total of 60 months of cash assistance (consecutive or nonconsecutive), 
assistance stops. States can allow exceptions to the 60-month rule for up to 20 
percent of recipients.
The general thrust of welfare reform was to change an entitlement program into a pro-
gram that requires work in exchange for time-limited assistance. Since the implementation 
of welfare reform, the number of people receiving assistance has decreased dramatically.
How does cash assistance to the poor affect their incentives to work? Two features 
of an assistance program affect work incentives:
• Base cash payment. The larger the amount provided as a base—the payment 
to someone who earns no market income—the lower the incentive to work to 
supplement the base income.
• Benefit reduction rate. When a recipient earns market income, the welfare 
payment decreases by a rate that varies from state to state. The reduction rate is 
100 percent in about one-third of states ($1 of market income decreases the welfare 
payment by $1), and less than 50 percent in about one-third of states ($1 of market 
income decreases the welfare payment by less than $0.50). The lower the reduc-
tion rate, the larger the payoff for each hour of market income, and the greater the 
incentive for the recipient to earn additional income. 
The Earned Income Tax Credit
The government also provides assistance to low-income households through the tax 
system. In 2010, federal spending on the earned income tax credit (EITC) was $55 
billion, which was more than twice the spending on TANF. EITC is an earnings sub-
sidy for low-income households that is determined by the number of children in the 
household. Here is how the EITC works for a household with two children (roughly 
two-fifths of EITC recipients).
• Phase in: For the first $12,590 of earnings, the subsidy rate is 0.40: for each $1 of 
earnings, the government provides a subsidy of $0.40.
• Flat spot: The credit reaches its maximum of $5,036, when household earn-
ings reach $12,590. For the next $2,410 of income, the credit remains at the 
maximum.
• Phase out: For income above $15,000, the phase-out rate is 0.21: for each addi-
tional dollar of earnings, the credit decreases by $0.21. The earnings subsidy 
reaches zero at an income of $40,363.
The subsidy rate and the phase-out rate are lower for households with fewer children.
The EITC is a successful antipoverty policy on two counts.10 First, the policy 
encourages participation in the workforce. For a $1,000 increase in the maximum 
credit, the employment rate of single mothers increases by about 3.6 percentage points. 

722
Between 1992 and 1999, the employment rate for single mothers increased from 71 percent 
to 86 percent, and increases in the maximum credit over this period were responsible for 
a large share of the increase in the employment rate. Second, the EITC reduces poverty. 
In 2003, the program lifted 4.4 million people in low-income working families out of pov-
erty. For the period 2002−2004, the EITC decreased the poverty rate among participants 
from 57 percent to 49 percent. For households below the poverty line, the EITC filled 
31 percent of the gap between income and the poverty line.

Expanding the Eitc
Applying the Concepts #5: How do government policies affect the distribution of income?
In response to stagnant wages for low-income workers, policy-
makers have proposed the expansion of wage subsidy programs. 
Under President Barack Obama’s 2014 plan, EITC coverage 
would be expanded to increase payments to 7.7 million workers 
and extend coverage to 5.8 million additional workers. Most of 
the additional workers are young or old (age 21–24 or 65–67), 
and do not have qualifying children. The expansion of EITC would 
lift about half a million people above the poverty line and reduce 
poverty for an additional 10 million workers. In addition, the exten-
sion of wage subsidies to more workers is expected to increase 
labor force participation. In the U.S. Senate, Senator Marco Rubio 
advocates the replacement of the EITC with a “wage enhance-
ment program,” a system of wage subsidies that shares many 
features of the President’s proposal. Related to Exercise 5.5.

In this chapter, we’ve seen 
how wages are determined 
in perfectly competitive labor 
markets and why wages dif-
fer from one occupation to 
another. We’ve also looked 
at the distribution of income 
in the United States and 
explored possible reasons for growing inequality. Here are the main 
points of the chapter:
1.	 The long-run demand curve for labor is negatively sloped 
because the output and input-substitution effects operate in the 
same direction: An increase in the wage decreases labor per unit 
of output and decreases the total output produced.
2.	 An increase in the wage triggers income and substitution effects 
that operate in opposite directions, so an increase in the wage 
has an ambiguous effect on the quantity of labor supplied.
3.	 The wage in a particular occupation will be relatively high if supply 
is small relative to demand. This will occur if (1) few people have 
the skills required for the occupation, (2) training costs are high, 
or (3) the job is dangerous or stressful.
4.	 College graduates earn more than high school graduates 
because a college education provides new skills and allows 
people to reveal their skills to employers.
5.	 The trade-off with a minimum wage is that some workers earn 
higher income, but others lose their jobs.
6.	 In the last few decades, the distribution of income has become 
more unequal. Federal tax and transfer policies diminish income 
inequality, but the redistributional effect has diminished in recent 
decades.
7.	 Poverty rates are relatively high among blacks, Hispanics, high 
school dropouts, and female-headed households.

Ex erc ises
The Demand for Labor
Explain why competition generates wages equal to marginal 
revenue product.
1.1	 The marginal revenue product of labor equals 
 times 
 .
1.2	 A profit-maximizing firm will hire the number of work-
ers where 
 equals 
 .
1.3	 Your favorite professional team is considering hiring a 
new player for $3 million per year. It will be sensible 
(profitable) to hire the player if his 
 is greater 
than the $3 million cost.
1.4	 Arrows up or down: The logic of the output effect is 
that a decrease in the wage will 
 produc-
tion costs, so the price of output will 
 and 
the quantity of output demanded will 
 . As a 
result, the quantity of labor demanded will 
 .
1.5	 The input-substitution effect is that a decrease in the 
wage 
 (increases/decreases) the quantity of 
labor per unit of 
 , so the quantity of labor 
demanded 
 (increases/decreases).
1.6	 The short-run market demand curve for labor is 
 (steeper/flatter) than the long-run demand 
because 
 occur(s) in the short run.
1.7	 Fill the blanks with 75, 100, 117, 200, or 360. In major 
league baseball, the marginal revenue product of the 
typical free agent is roughly 
 percent of his 
salary, compared to 
 percent for a journey-
man and 
 percent for an apprentice. (Related 
to Application 1 on page 707.)
1.8	 Demand for News Kids. Consider the market for 
newspaper delivery kids in Kidsville. Each news kid 
receives a piece rate of $2 per subscriber per month 
and has a fixed territory that initially has 100 subscrib-
ers. The price elasticity of demand for subscriptions is 
2.0. Suppose the new city council of Kidsville passes 
a law that establishes a minimum piece rate of $3 
per subscriber per month. As a result, the publisher 
increases the monthly price of a subscription by 20 per-
cent. How will the new law affect the monthly income 
of the typical news kid?
1.9	 Demand for Airline Pilots. Comment on the follow-
ing: “There is no substitute for an airline pilot: Some-
one has to fly the plane. Therefore, an increase in the 
wage of airline pilots will not change the number of 
pilots used by the airlines.”
The Supply of Labor
Explain why an increase in the wage could increase, decrease, 
or not change hours worked.
2.1	 Arrows up or down: An increase in the wage 
 
the opportunity cost of leisure time, which tends to 
 leisure time and 
 labor time.
2.2	 Arrows up or down: An increase in the wage 
 
real income, and if leisure is a normal good this tends 
to 
 leisure time and 
 labor time.
2.3	 We 
 (can/cannot) predict a worker’s response 
to an increase in the wage because the 
 effect 
and the 
 effect work in 
 (the same/
opposite) direction(s).
2.4	 Your objective is to earn exactly $120 per week. If your 
wage decreases from $6 to $4 per hour, you respond by 
working 
 hours instead of 
 hours. 
In other words, your labor-supply curve is 
 
sloped.
2.5	 In the short run, labor supply is influenced by the 
wage rate, while in the long run, it is influenced by net 
advantages of the job.

724
2.6	 For cabbies in New York City, the elasticity of supply 
of labor is 
 (positive/negative/zero). (Related 
to Application 2 on page 710.)
2.7	 Income and Substitution Effects. Sabrina works for a 
workers’ cooperative that initially pays her a lump sum 
of $200 per week (as long as she works at least 15 hours 
per week) and a wage of $20 per hour of work. She ini-
tially works 40 hours per week. Suppose the cooperative 
changes its pay plan by increasing the lump-sum pay-
ment to $280 and decreasing the hourly wage to $18.
a.	 If Sabrina continues to work 40 hours per week, 
how does the change in the pay plan affect her total 
income?
b.	Use the concepts of the income and substitution 
effects to predict whether Sabrina will work more 
hours, fewer hours, or the same number of hours. 
(Hint: Is there an income effect to consider?)
2.8	 City versus National Carpenter Supply. Draw two 
supply curves for carpenters: one for the market in the 
city of Portland and one for the market in the United 
States. In which market would you expect a more elas-
tic supply of carpenters?
2.9	 Tax Rate and Tax Revenue. Critically appraise the 
following statement: “The law of supply says that an 
increase in price increases the quantity supplied. A 
decrease in the income tax rate will increase the work-
er’s net wage, so each worker will work more hours. As 
a result, the revenue from the income tax will increase.”
2.10	 Personal Labor Supply. We discussed the responses 
of Lester, Sam, and Maureen to a wage increase. Which 
person’s response is closest to your own? If your wage 
increased, would you work more hours, fewer hours, or 
about the same number of hours?
2.11	 Cabbie Wages and Income. Suppose New York City 
increases the taxi fare by 20 percent. (Related to Appli-
cation 2 on page 710.)
a.	 For the typical cabbie, daily income will increase by 
 (more than/less than/exactly) 20 percent. 
Explain.
b.	Suppose the initial fare per mile is $0.60 and the 
initial miles per day is 100. Compute the percentage 
change in daily income.
Labor Market Equilibrium
Explain why wages differ across occupations and levels of 
human capital.
3.1	 Arrows up or down: A decrease in the supply of nurses 
will 
 the equilibrium wage and 
 
the equilibrium quantity of nursing services.
3.2	 Arrows up or down: An increase in the demand for 
nursing services will 
 the equilibrium wage 
and 
 the equilibrium quantity of nursing 
services.
3.3	 Arrows up or down: A minimum wage 
 the 
quantity of labor demanded and 
 the quan-
tity of labor supplied.
3.4	 A minimum wage for restaurant workers brings good 
news to 
, but bad news to 
 and 
.
3.5	 In Figure 32.5 on page 712, an increase in the wage 
decreases the quantity of labor demanded. Using the 
simple approach to computing percentage changes (see 
the Appendix to Chapter 1), the implied elasticity of 
demand for labor is 
.
3.6	 The wage for a particular occupation will be relatively 
low if labor 
 (demand/supply) is small rela-
tive to labor 
 (demand/supply).
3.7	 Better working amenities in the manufacturing indus-
try would shift the labor supply curve to the 
 
and wages to be relatively 
 (high/low).
3.8	 In some countries, it is customary to tip restaurant 
waiters. We would expect the wages paid to waiters 
to be 
 (higher/lower/the same) in countries 
where tips are customary.
3.9	 After several years of training, Larry works as a res-
ervoir engineer in an oil and gas firm. This job would 
normally be expected to offer a 
 (higher/
lower) wage as compared to a desk job.
3.10	 The wage premium for beautiful people is about 
 percent, while the wage penalty for unat-
tractive people is about 
 percent. (Related 
to Application 3 on page 716.)
3.11	 Beautiful workers get wider opportunities to 
  , 
so a small difference in innate characteristics can lead 
to a large difference in 
. (Related to Applica-
tion 3 on page 716.)
3.12	 Living Wage and Labor Income. Consider a uni-
versity that has sweatshirts bearing its logo produced 
overseas by a contractor who initially pays a wage of $8 
per sweatshirt and has other costs of $12 per sweatshirt, 
resulting in a price of $20 per sweatshirt. At this price, 
the university sells 100 sweatshirts per week. Suppose 
a student group succeeds in getting the contractor to 
increase the wage to $10 per shirt and the other costs 
of production don’t change.
a.	 The price per sweatshirt will increase from 
 to 
, an increase of 
 
percent.
b.	Suppose the price elasticity of demand for the univer-
sity’s sweatshirts is 3.0. At the higher price, a total of 
 sweatshirts will be purchased and the total 
spending on sweatshirt labor (total labor income) will 
change from $
 to $
.

725
c.	 Suppose consumers are willing to pay a higher price 
for sweatshirts made by workers receiving a higher 
wage. How would this change the numbers in  
part (b)? Provide an example in which the higher 
wage actually increases the total spending on sweat-
shirt labor.
3.13	 Payroll Tax. You are an economic consultant to a city 
that just imposed a payroll tax of $1 per hour of work. 
This payroll tax is paid by workers through a pay-
roll deduction: For each hour of work, the employer 
deducts $1 and sends the money to the city govern-
ment. The initial wage (before the tax) is $10, and total 
employment is 20,000 hours per day. Use a graph to 
show the effect of the tax on the equilibrium wage and 
employment.
3.14	 Higher Teacher Salaries. Advocates of higher salaries 
for teachers point out that most teachers have college 
degrees and that teaching children is an important job.
a.	 Why aren’t teachers’ salaries higher, given the 
importance of the job and the education required?
b.	Suppose a new law establishes a minimum teacher 
salary that is 20 percent higher than the prevailing 
salary. How would you expect this law to affect the 
average quality of teachers and the taxes paid by the 
typical household?
3.15	 Improved Safety and Wages. Consider an occupa-
tion that initially has a relatively high rate of nonfatal 
injuries. The equilibrium wage is $20 per hour, and the 
equilibrium quantity is 100,000 hours. Suppose a new 
safety device cuts the injury rate in half, and the sup-
ply of labor increases by 12 percent: The labor supply 
curve shifts to the right by 12 percent.
a.	 Use a graph to show the effects of the safety device 
on the equilibrium wage and employment.
b.	Suppose the elasticity of supply of labor is 3.0 and 
the elasticity of demand is 1.0. Use the price change 
formula discussed in an earlier chapter on elasticity 
to compute the change in the equilibrium wage.
c.	 Suppose the demand curve you’ve drawn is a long-
run demand curve. Explain the roles of the output 
effect and substitution effect on the change in the 
quantity of labor demanded.
3.16	 Waiter Tips and Income. Consider a city where the 
typical waiter has a five-hour shift and daily “sales” (total 
bills presented to customers) of $400. The customary 
tip is 15 percent, so tips add up to $60 per day (15% of 
$400). The initial wage is $10 per hour, so the typical 
waiter initially earns $50 in wages paid directly by the 
restaurant. Suppose a local waiter association runs a suc-
cessful campaign to get the city’s restaurant patrons to 
increase the average tip from 15 to 20 percent.
a.	 Use a supply and demand graph with wage (exclud-
ing tips) on the vertical axis to show the effects of 
the new tip rate on the labor market.
b.	How will the new tip rate affect the daily income 
(wages plus tips) of the typical waiter?
The Distribution of Income
Describe recent changes in the distribution of income.
4.1	 Government transfer and tax policies increase the 
income share of the lowest quintile of the income 
distribution from about 
 percent to about 
 percent.
4.2	 The college premium is defined as the percentage 
difference between the incomes of 
 and 
. It is currently about 
 percent.
4.3	 Arrows up or down: Since 1970, the income share of 
the top fifth of the income distribution has 
 , 
while the shares of the lowest and middle fifths have 
.
4.4	 Arrows up or down: An important factor in grow-
ing inequality over the last 30 years is technological 
change that has 
 the demand for ­college 
graduates and 
 the demand for less-­
educated workers.
4.5	 The average immigrant has 
 (less/more) 
education than the average native, so immigra-
tion 
 (increases/decreases) the wages of 
 (low/high) skill natives. (Related to Appli-
cation 4 on page 718.)
4.6	 The immigration of low-skill workers generates net 
benefits for 
 workers because they benefit 
from lower 
 without bearing the cost associ-
ated with lower 
. (Related to Application 4 
on page 718.)
4.7	 Wage and Price Effects of Immigration. In the ini-
tial equilibrium in the market for farm workers, the 
wage is $10 per hour. The elasticity of supply of farm 
workers is 2.0, and the elasticity of demand for farm 
workers is 1.0. Suppose that immigration increases 
the supply of farm workers by 12 percent: The sup-
ply curve shifts to the right by 12 percent. (Related to 
Application 4 on page 718.)
a.	 Use the price-change formula discussed in an earlier 
chapter on elasticity to compute the change in the 
equilibrium wage.
b.	Suppose that farm workers are responsible for one-
fourth of the production cost of food. What are the 
implications of immigration for the cost of produc-
ing food and its price?

Public Policy and the Distribution of Income
Describe the effects of government policies on poverty and 
the distribution of income.
5.1	 For each of the following pairs of population groups, 
indicate which group has a higher poverty rate:
a.	
 white vs. 
 Hispanic
b.	
 white vs. 
 Asian
c.	
 married couple vs. 
 female-
headed household
d.

 65 years 
and older
5.2	 Government spending and tax policies reduce the over-
all poverty rate from roughly 
 (25/20/15/10) 
percent to roughly 
 (15/10/5/2) percent.
5.3	 Cash aid to the poor makes up roughly 
 
(90/50/30/20) percent of the total spending on means-
tested programs.
5.4	 A low-income person receiving cash aid under TANF 
receives a fixed sum per month for an unlimited length 
of time.
