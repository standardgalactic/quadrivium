DVD 5 – Group Induction Secrets, Corporate Inductions 
& How to Deal with Problems
Corporate Group Inductions

Spencer:
Well, let’s get on with it. Where were we? How many of you are confident 
about getting out there and doing this thing now?
Yeah.
All right, we’re there we’re going for it. What are we going to do now? Oh 
boy, look at this. Let’s do some more group inductions. I want to work on 
that some more, because as a stage hypnotist you’ll be doing a great thing 
when doing demonstrations. I’m telling you, this will open the doors to so 
many possibilities for you guys that you’ll be speechless.
Oftentimes, the stage hypnotist will get gigs working with Corporate 
America. Corporate America pays ka-Ching. They pay big money because
they’ve got big money to spend and they want to do every year for 
entertainment– ka-Ching, ka-Ching.
If you think about it, I mean really, if a company has 500 or 1,000 
employees, they’re paying some big bucks out there. They’ve got some 
money that they’re paying and they’re going to have to pay taxes, but if they 
have somebody for entertainment, that’s a write-off. 
The smart employer, the CEO is going to go wow, HR person, let’s find 
some entertainment. Let’s keep the money right here. Let’s make our
employees feel good. Let’s do something great for them. That’s where you 
come in. 
Oftentimes, you’ll find that companies will call a hypnotist to come in and do 
things like stress management seminars, because hypnotists are proficient 
in stress management. That’s what you do, I think you do, smoking 
cessation, weight loss type stuff, insomnia or wellness programs that 
corporation’s have.
So, when you’re doing these types of presentations, people have heard 
about you because you have a presence on the Internet and you all have a 
website built. You know that you need to, right? 
Right.
By a raise of hands, how many people in here do not have a website? Stick 
around with me, I’ll hook you up, don’t worry about it. I got you covered 
there. We want you guys to look spiffy-diffy.

When Corporate America comes knocking at your door and they want you 
to come in to do a presentation, group inductions is the way to begin it. You 
go in there and you might talk about whatever your presentation may be, 
but at some point you’re going to want to do two things. 
i. You’ll want to do a group demonstration for relaxation because that’s 
usually what they call you in for. 
ii. Then from the group induction where you do the demonstration of 
the group induction, you will pick some people out of the audience 
and you’ll bring them up for a one-on-one demonstration. 
That’s when the fireworks begin. This is your moment to shine. That’s why 
they hired you. Because you’re cool, you’ve got the goods, man. You can 
help people relax instantly is what you can do, and you will. This is what 
you’re going to be doing you’re going to help people to relax, to chill and
feel about themselves. 
Let’s do a group induction again. This time we don’t really have to go all the 
way through it. Now, again, if you’re chewing gum, swallow it or put it 
underneath the chair like you did in school or spit it in a napkin.
Laughter
The reason I say this is because I’ve seen it happen. I’ve seen people in 
hypnosis chewing on gum and sometimes the gum will fall apart because of 
the acids in your mouth. I’ve seen big old long, stringy globs and it just 
doesn’t look good. 
You can be kind of goofy and play off of that because that’s part of doing 
the hypnosis show. It’s like you’re always looking for improv. As a stage 
hypnotist, you have your routines but you are the master of improv. 
You’ve got to be quick on your toes and light on your feet. See what’s going 
on and go oh, how can I use this to make my show better? What can I do 
with this person? Oh, you didn’t do what you were supposed to do, but 
that’s okay. Why? Sleep. Oh, do it differently then.
So let’s just imagine for a second, so that we can press on through here 
that you’re all asleep, with your eyes closed down all the way. 
With your eyes closed down all the way, just the way that you like it 
to be, both eyes closed down all the way, you can quickly remember 
what it’s like to be so comfortable. In fact, I know that you’re here for 
my presentation on stress today and because of that, I’m going to 
help you to make this very simple for yourself.

I’d like you to think of a place that you’ve gone in your mind, in your 
body for a time that’s in your mind because anything you’ve done out 
there is in there, your mind. So if you could just stop and think about 
that place now, a place that you’ve been where you’re comfortable 
and relaxed and nobody will bother or disturb you, I want you to find 
that place right now.
As you begin to think about that place now, then just nod your head 
for me if you would please. That’s right. Now I want you to simply 
breathe into that image. Breathe into that image of that place that 
you’ve been to. Make it as powerful and real as you can without 
trying too hard. 
I want you to make this picture vivid in your mind. Imagine that you’re 
there right now, all the sounds, all the sights, all the smells, all the 
textures and even the taste. Imagine yourself there now. Be there. 
Make this image as real as you can. Expand this image. Make it 
bigger and even bigger. Really enjoy that place. That’s right. You’ve 
been there before.  
Listen, each and every time that you relax, you’re going to relax 
deeper and faster. Each and every time your eyes close, you will 
relax deeper and faster. Every time that you close your eyes with the 
intention of going into hypnosis, you will relax deeper and you will 
relax 
faster. 
Whenever 
I 
say 
the 
word 
“sleep”
or 
“sleep now,” it’s simply a word, a cue for your mind and your body to 
relax instantly.
Whenever I say the word “sleep” or “sleep now,” your eyes close, 
your body becomes loose and limp and relaxed easily and naturally. 
In this place in this space in your mind where you’ve gone before, 
this is your place, your special place that you can relax comfortably, 
and it feels so good to be there, this place that you’ve been to.
I want you to take another deep breath into it. That’s right. Just let it 
spread out through your entire body. There you go. Yeah, that feels 
so good to be there. That’s right. 
In a moment I’ll count to three, on number three just open your eyes 
and come all the way back and we’re going to talk about this for just 
a moment 1-2-3, eyes all the way open now. Come all the way back. 
Very good. How do you guys all feel?
Great.

Spencer:
Yeah. If you felt better before, you’re feeling even better now. So when 
you’re doing a group, what better way is there? We don’t have to spend a 
lot of time, especially in a smaller intimate group. We don’t have to go 
through a whole fractionization type of relaxation, going from your head to 
your toes. You can simply go into a place that a person’s been to that 
makes them feel comfortable, and you can be there now without wasting a 
lot of time.
So there are many different strategies that you, the professional trained 
competent, confident, powerful state hypnotist, skills and tools that you 
have learned and now today you’ll take with you forever, from this point on 
that you’ll remember, you’ll use.

So now that you’ve got people in this state and they’re feeling good, it’s like, 
wow, how did that happen so quickly and so easily? What can you now do? 
You can do a demonstration. 
Scratching your head, your name is? Come on up here. You were 
scratching your head so you looked like you needed to come up here. 
Laughter
Wendy?
Yes.
Good. Can I borrow you for a second?
Yes.
This is Wendy and I’m going to borrow Wendy for a second because I just 
want to show you guys a demonstration real quick. Do you mind if I just 
help you relax real quickly?
Sure.
This is very cool. You’re not going to fall over. Your legs are nice and 
strong. Very good.
Take a deep breath in. Close your eyes and lean way back. There 
you go. Loose and limp and relaxed. Good. Now listen very carefully. 
I’m going to drop your arm down to your side and when I do, let’s just 
go back in time very quickly. I’m going to drop your arm to your side, 
and let’s just go back in time to a time when you were just a little girl, 
before 10 years old – a very happy time only – and just be there right 
now.
Where you are is it daytime or nighttime? 
Daytime.
Inside or outside?
Outside.
Are you alone or is somebody with you?

You’re with dolphins? That’s so cool. What are you doing with 
dolphins?
I’m swimming with them.
Swimming with dolphins. That’s awesome and how old do you seem 
to be?
Seven.
Seven, wow! Is this the coolest thing you’ve ever done?
Pretty much.
Pretty much, yeah. Hey, where’s mom and dad?
Watching. 
They’re watching. What’s it like to be out there with the dolphins?
Pretty good. I was a Sea World. 
Oh, at Sea World. That is so cool. Very good. Let your mind go clear 
for a second. Good.
I’m going to drop your hand down to your side. Let’s go back to an 
even earlier time before you were 5. An earlier time before you were 
5 years old, just be there now and where this takes you now is it 
daytime or nighttime? Very quickly, daytime or nighttime.
Daytime, but it looked like nighttime.
Okay, good. Daytime. Are you inside or outside?
Inside.
Alone or is somebody with you?
I’m with a group of people. 
And how old do you seem to be?
Three.
Three. No kidding? What are you doing with this group of people?

Dancing on stage. 
Dancing on the stage? Are you serious? What are you wearing?
Tutu.
A tutu? Wow. What color is that?
Pink.
That is so cool. That must be a lot of fun, isn’t it?
Yes.
Yeah, sure it is. Let your mind go clear. In just a moment I’m going to 
count to three. Let’s move up in time a little bit. Actually, on the count 
of three, open your eyes and come all the way back 1-2-3, wide 
awake. Good. How do you feel?
Good.
Have a seat here for a second please. Let me ask you something. What did 
you think about that?
That was cool. 
Yeah, going back that quickly. Did you know that you could do that?
Yeah.
You did know that?
Yeah.
Far out. So listen, you guys. When you’re doing a demonstration, I mean a 
regression is a very simple thing to do. When you’re doing it, I only use 
happy times. Why do I only use happy times? 
Abreaction.
So you don’t get an abreaction, right. Is there anybody in here that does not 
know what an abreaction is? Two people, okay. For you who don’t know 
what an abreaction is, it’s having an experience in your body about 
something that happened a long time ago, usually bad.

For example,– this is not you– but let’s just say that there is somebody who 
had a bad experience as a child, a little boy or little girl who was maybe 
touched inappropriately. If you say, go back to a time in your life when you
were younger, I like to cover it and say just a happy time only because if 
you just say go back to any time and all the sudden they’re crying, it’s an 
abreaction. 
They may be reliving this memory and having this physical experience in 
their body that you may not be ready to deal with. If you’re doing a 
demonstration you sure don’t want that to happen in front of a group of 
people that you’re trying to motivate. 
Laughter
They’re going whoa, what’s going on? You’re going, oh boy, I don’t know. I 
always do happy times. Now, is it possible that even if I do a happy time 
that something bad could come out? Yeah. That sucks! It’s happened to 
me, so I’m not saying it can’t happen. Anything that could ever happen to 
any hypnotist has happened to me, so I’m coming to you with good 
information here.
I’ve done all the wrong things so hopefully, I don’t continue to make those 
mistakes. If you have something that happens like that, just deal with it 
appropriately. 
The first rule in hypnotherapy is – does anybody know?
Stay calm. Don’t panic.
Wow! Let me tell you my idea, deal with what emerges. You don’t panic, 
you do stay calm, but whatever happens hey listen, you’re the professional, 
simply deal with what emerges. If something happens, like wow that’s cool. 
Let’s fix that real quick. Let’s just take care of that real quick. Thank you.
Thank you.
Give her a round of applause. Make her feel good.

Get Business Through Demos
Spencer:

Student:
Spencer:
Can you see the benefit of doing a group type of induction like that and then 
taking one person out of the audience or out of the group and bringing them 
up and doing a demonstration? When you do that, what goes on in the 
minds of the people in the audience?
I wonder if they can help me later.
Before we answer all these, let’s get some microphones out here because 
I’d like to get some of this feedback. It’s not just you. I should be saying, 
let’s give you a microphone and have you stand up. I sometimes get ahead 
of myself. 
The people are going wow that looks like it works maybe I should get his 
card because I need to lose 30 pounds.
Right. Check that out. I need to lose 30 pounds let me get that guy’s card, 
this is pretty cool. How much is 30 pounds worth?
Two hundred and ten dollars.
Okay, $210 for one session.
Per pound.
Per pound. Or, could it be $2,500 for a program? That’s the only thing I do. I 
don’t sell one-on-one I sell programs. Why? Because, listen, weight loss 
has to do with lifestyle changes folks, and we’re there to help. You can go 
around and you can do one-on-one seminars. Get a bunch of people and 
do a weight loss or a stop smoking thing. 
It’s like a shotgun. Some people are going to get hit in the rear end and 
they’re going to change, and a lot of people are not going to get that big 
blast right in the middle they’re just going to get a little pellet here and there. 
In hypnosis, take the shotgun with one person, you condense it and get 
close up. Change! Get that gun up close. Bam! 
So, when you do it over and over through repetition in a program, the 
results skyrocket and you’ll have more business than you know what to do 
with. Seriously, I worked in a little town for a while and I was only making 
$15,000 a month, but it wasn’t too bad, just doing programs. Really, that’s 
not bad money. 
Who wouldn’t work for $15,000 a month come on, seriously it’s not bad.

Q&A Session
Student:
Spencer:
Student:
Spencer:
Student:
Spencer:
Student:
Spencer:
The question I remember your asking is; do we see the benefit in doing this 
kind of group work and then finding someone to do a demo with. I guess I 
don’t see the benefit of that if we’re talking about stage hypnosis. I see the 
benefit of that if we’ve been hired by a group to do wellness training or 
something like that, and I guess I don’t see the benefit of doing regression 
in stage work.
Okay.
So, in answer to your question do you see the benefit, no, I don’t at this 
point so help me.
I get it. Whoa. How many people heard me say that if you’re doing this for 
groups like corporate stuff, how many of you heard me say that? What I 
was talking about was if you’re working in smaller groups like corporate, this 
works very well. 
Let’s translate that for a second onto the stage and let’s talk about 
regression and I don’t see the benefit of doing that. Are you referring to that 
as far as working with like in corporate demonstration or on stage?
No, I was thinking in the context of on stage.
Okay, so my question for you would be what do you see troublesome to you 
about doing a regression with somebody on stage?
I’m not sure I see the likely entertainment value of that.
Let me explain that to you then. Here’s the entertainment value because I 
think it’s a blast. Now not everybody agrees with me, that’s okay and that’s 
what’s so awesome about being humans. We can all agree to disagree and 
we can all get along and that’s what’s fantastic. 
I’ve done regressions in my shows since day one, but I don’t do it like this. 
I’ll say in a moment I’m going to count to three, you’re all little children and 
we’re going to go for a rollercoaster ride. We’re going to have a lot of fun 1-
2-3, hi kids. Hi. They’re out there doing all this little kid stuff. 
For entertainment value it’s a lot of fun. If you want to do a stage show and 
not do a regression, you don’t have to it’s no big deal. There’s an 
entertainment value there, but you have to remember you’re not there to 
demean the people up here.

11
                                 
You always want to respect them. So you do it in a way that’s respectful of 
them and be sure you don’t go into something that could be inappropriate 
for little kids. 
Does that make sense? Does that help?
It does help because in different contexts, I do see the value.
Good. I’m glad you found value then. Give him a hand.
Applause
Getting back to where we were as far as you’re doing this corporate 
relaxation thing and getting everybody relaxed and it’s nice and great. Then 
you just picked Wendy you said because she was scratching her head, but 
in other words, you haven’t done a suggestibility. You’ve just done a 
relaxation with a group of us you just picked one person out of there?
Let’s stop for just a moment. What is suggestibility?
It’s hypnosis.
Stop. Stand there for a second so I can address this again. What is
suggestibility? No, never mind sit down. Are you getting it? 
I get it. 
Okay. Suggestibility is nothing more than offering a suggestion, whether it’s 
to close your eyes and go into an experience, that’s a suggestion. So there 
are many different ways to approach suggestibility. Did I really pick her 
because was scratching her head? I mean she was, but here’s the way my 
mind thinks. Do you really want to know?
Think of it this way. I kind of look for the goofiest things I can possibly come 
up with. It kind of just throws people off. It’s like, scratching her head, so 
you’re going to use somebody because they’re scratching their head? I 
don’t know. That’s not how I think. There’s no rhyme or reason for it. 
In fact, so much of what I do, I do unconsciously anymore because I’ve 
done it for so long, and it just happens. Sometimes I have to stop and think, 
well, why did I do that? Then I run it through it through my brain and go oh, 
okay, that’s why I did that. If I look at it logically and seriously and 
unbiasedly, I’ll go oh okay, that’s why I did it. I have to question myself, so 
thank you for questioning me.

Yeah, the entertainment value for the regression well, you’re up there 
advertising yourself, you’re advertising your different services and you’re 
showing the people what you can do. Some people might say well yeah, I 
need to go back to that time to address that situation and deal with it. It’s 
like handing out a business card, isn’t it?
Exactly. Listen, even during a show when you’re doing a presentation and 
you do a regression or no matter what you do, trust me on this. People are 
going to come up to you at the end of the show and they’re going to go, 
wow, that was amazing. 
I’ve got this cousin… 
I’ve got this brother… 
I’ve got this wife… 
My husband… 
Or me…
Its like, can I lose weight?
I want to stop smoking. 
I’m stressed can you help me with this?
So the presentation of the stage show is to excite the imagination. You may 
want to only be a performer. That’s great. Go out and be a performer. You 
may never want to do therapy at all. I personally do not like doing therapy. 
I’m done with it. I will work with people though, because they pay me money 
to do it. I don’t mind taking money, but it’s not what I do or pursue in my 
everyday life.
I’m kind of like, argh. I tried it, it creeps me out, but that’s my own trance 
thing. I need help with it I need to see a hypnotist. 
I’ll give you my card.
There you go. I’m very happy doing what I do. I love doing stage work. It’s 
my deal, but there’s so much value in doing that presentation because 
people will come up to you. 
Because you have excited their imagination, they look at you and go, wow 
you are the one you can help. You’re the missing link. I’ve been to all these 
other people, but there’s something about what you’ve done, what I’ve seen 
about who you are that I think I can get some help. 
Trust me on this. One of the neatest things that I hear from people is, like I 
believe that you can help me. If I can help one human being make a 
significant positive change in their life because of what I do as a showman, 
my whole day is made.

I don’t really care about the entertainment. I love doing entertainment, but if 
somebody comes up there and says, I know you can help me and if I can, 
wow. For me, that’s the bonus there, but I hate doing therapy. 
I don’t like doing it that much. I really don’t like it, but I will because I can do 
it very well. I’ve done it for a long time, and it’s a very natural process, and it 
will become natural for you too. You’ll find as working with large groups that 
you’re going to begin to notice things about people that you’ve never 
noticed before about people individually. And you’ll know things about 
people individually in a group that you’ve never noticed in a group before.
It’s amazing.

Let’s do another group thing here. I need a volunteer. Eric, I haven’t seen 
you up here. Come on up here. Let’s just imagine for a second Eric, that 
you’re a hypnotist. 
I am. I’m a master hypnotist.
Master Hypnotists don’t chew gum in front of other people on stage.
My bad all right. 
Pretend you didn’t see him do that.
Hey, I’m just trying to be compliant. 
I know it’s very cool. Here’s what I want you to do very quickly because I 
want you to have an experience here. Okay, you’re a Master Hypnotist, 
right, correct, you’re cool; you’ve got it all down?
Absolutely.
Everything’s happening. Everything’s flowing. Okay, good. Let’s just 
imagine for a second that you’re doing a stage show and it hasn’t begun, 
but you’re going to do this quick induction. You only have like 30 seconds to 
do it with a group. Here’s your group. You’ve got 30 seconds.
On you?
No, not me the group.
I’m doing the group? Okay. All right. 
I’d like everyone to stick both hands out in front of you and I want 
you to slap them together and rub them real fast. That’s right. Faster, 
faster, faster. Now I want you to take them like this and start 
pumping them like you’re milking a cow. That’s right. Pump them like 
you’re milking a cow and slap.
All right, now I want you to imagine that you’ve got a magnet in front 
of them. Feel that fuzzy, buzzy feeling in your hands. The magnet is 
squeezing them together, just like that and when they touch you’re 
going to drop your hands down and you’re going to go into trance. As 
soon as they touch, they’re going to drop down and go into a trance.

Close your eyes. That’s right. Deeper and deeper down you go. The 
deeper you go, the better you feel. The better you feel the deeper 
you go. And counting 1-2-3, eyes wide open, wide awake, fully alert, 
feeling wonderful in every way. 
Give him a round of applause and make him feel good. Thank you. 
Applause
Wow that was fast! That was good. I gave him 37 seconds. Not bad, right.
Very cool. I like that. See how he did that? You guys can do that too. I don’t 
think I’ve ever done it that fast. That was awesome. 
See what happens when you put a little bit of pressure on people. You’d be 
amazed at the things that you could actually accomplish when you’re put in 
a position to do it. When you’re told to do it, you have to, it’s like if you’re life
depended on it, you can do it. 
Here’s what we’re going to do. Let’s divide up into two groups. Linda, I don’t 
know who you are. Stand up, please, since you’re just right there in front. 
You can be the leader of this group. Arthur, you look like a powerful 
hypnotist. Why don’t you stand up? You’re nervous, aren’t you? What 
comes next? You do.
Here’s what I want you to do. This is your group here. You guys focus on 
him and imagine that you don’t hear any of this stuff over here. So this is 
going to take some action on your part to focus Arthur, he is your hypnotist, 
your presenter. 
Linda here is yours. You guys over here ignore them. Just focus over here 
on her. It’s going to take all your active participation to do this. With that 
said, I want you and you to be hypnotists to your respective audience for 
the moment and I want you to simply show me what you can do as a group. 
You’ve got one minute to do a group induction. 
After you do the group testing here, I want you to turn it into an induction by 
taking one or two people out of there and ripping them down quickly. You’ll 
bring them up here. You’ve got one minute and then you’ve got one minute 
to bring them up, so you’ve got two minutes total, beginning right now. 
Okay, have a seat. Give everybody a round of applause.
Applause
In the group induction, when you’re working with groups and doing groups, 
there are a few tricks of the trade. I’m not sure it’s really a trick of the trade;
it’s just deepeners, using language skills in order to produce a deeper, more 
powerful trance.

If you’ve been listening to what I say or what Igor has been saying – did we 
begin today? It’s been a long day and we’re not even halfway through. 
Listen to what we do. 
For example, when you close your eyes, go ahead and close your 
eyes, I want you to pay attention for a moment with your eyes closed. 
Listen to what I have to say this is very important, because I think 
you’re going to benefit more from it from the inside than from the 
outside. With your eyes closed down, I want you to notice that you 
breathe. 
As you breathe, your breath relaxes you even more. The more you 
breathe, the better you feel. The better you feel, the deeper you relax. 
Listen to the words. The words I continue to use are compounded 
words that help you to relax. It doesn’t matter how you relax because 
your mind and body knows how to get you there quickly, easily and 
gently. 
As you go ahead and get there, as quickly as you want to, you can 
slow everything down inside and just be there because when you 
relax your head and your shoulders, everything follows all the way 
down your body. Every suggestion that you get is compounded upon 
another suggestion. Listen. 
Whenever I say the words “sleep” or “sleep now,” your eyes close, 
your body relaxes completely. Why do I say the words sleep or sleep 
now? Listen. It’s an anchor. You’re anchoring individuals to a state of 
relaxation so that when you’re working with them as a group or 
individually, in your state hypnosis presentation, all you need to do is 
say the words “sleep” or “sleep now.” Their eyes will close and their 
body will become loose, limp and relaxed.
This is one of the tricks, I guess, of the stage hypnotist. It’s to reinduce 
trance very quickly. Now the audience does not know this, but you know 
this now, what you’re doing. You just make it part of the show so it seems 
like it’s just a part of the show because nobody really thinks about it. You’re 
the one who knows it, and you’re the one who thinks about it. 
Whenever I say the words “sleep” or “sleep now,” your eyes close 
and you relax completely. The more you breathe, the better you feel. 
As you continue to relax, you’re going to hear music. The sound of 
the music helps you to relax. You’ll even hear sounds. Every time 
you hear the audience applause, it just helps you to go even deeper 
and deeper into hypnosis.

If the person next to you moves or touches you or if you feel them 
shift in their chairs, it simply helps you to relax and go even deeper 
into trance. Every time your eyes open and close, you just sink 
deeper and deeper. You let go a little bit further, quicker and faster. 
Open your eyes and come back for just a moment, please. Okay, 
good. 
Now I want to get a little bit of feedback on this because I want to make 
sure that you guys are all following me with what I’m saying and with what 
I’m doing. Is there anybody that does not understand what I just did? If 
there is, please raise your hand. 
Okay, everybody understands. You not sure you understand? How many of 
you are getting totally bazonkered and wasted? Oh, I love it. We’re wearing 
down all resistance. –Resistance is futile.–
I’ll tell you what, what’s going to happen is that you’re going to take away 
from these next four days and everything that you learn here you’re going to 
walk away and at some point, all of the sudden you’re going to go, whoa
wow! What can I do now? You’re going to be going out there and busting 
down doors. You’re going to be taking over the world. Well, after me. We’ll 
all go there together. Let’s all go on the journey together, shall we?
Was that the fractionization to keep saying it over and over again, saying 
sleep and sleep now? I’m a little confused on that.
When you’re working with a group, whether it’s a group out here or you’re 
audience up here on stage, it’s nothing more than just continued 
deepeners. I just continue to deepen the trance and give suggestions. 
They’re just multiple suggestions and I just trailer one on top of another.
Every time your eyes open and close, you will go deeper into trance. 
Whenever I say the word “sleep,” your eyes close. Your body relaxes. 
Every sound around you helps you to relax. Everything becomes a 
suggestion. Everything is a suggestion. 
When you sneeze, relax and go even deeper into sleep. If you get an itch, 
itch it and relax into that feeling. So everything becomes a suggestion. 
Everything becomes suggestibility because everything in my world is 
hypnosis. Hypnosis is nothing more than suggestion. 
A suggestion is nothing more than well, look around. You have people with 
long hair, short hair, black hair, gray hair, orange hair, no hair. It all 
suggests something to us, right? I mean we’re all a product of our 
environment. Everything is a suggestion. So as a performer, how you 
appear on stage suggests something to people. How you look and how you 
dress.

Do you wear one watch or two? What does that suggest? The guy’s crazy. I 
don’t know. I always want to know what time it is. I’m not taking any 
chances. I got two time zones I’ve got to watch out for. Actually, I do it 
because I can. How’s that? That’s the thing.
Is it the stage hypnosis version of like a boilerplate? Is that kind of what 
you’re talking about? Whatever happens makes you go deeper.
Exactly, yes. What’s a boilerplate, I’m not familiar with that?
That’s something Igor taught us when we were doing hypnotherapy training. 
The boilerplate for safety reasons so nothing else messes with your client, 
any external noises. Making them go deeper, it’s the stage hypnosis version 
of a boilerplate.
Right. Anything you do in therapy is the same thing. If you’re working with 
somebody in a clinical setting and you happen to have an office with a lot of 
noise around you, it’s like, as a person walks down the hallway, just let that 
sound relax you even more, so yeah.
The human mind is a fragile thing, and it’s in your hands. Treat it very kindly
and with respect. I live in a little place called Montana. Does anybody know 
where that is? I live in Kalispell, Montana. Does anybody know where that 
is? No. It’s that way, north. It’s that close to Canada.
They’ve got this place up there called Big Mountain where we go skiing. I 
was skiing a couple of weeks ago with my son who is 6 ½ years old. All the 
sudden, he’s become this skier. The other day we were skiing and I’m 
skiing backwards and I’m watching him. He’s like this, going like this with 
his hand behind his back because he doesn’t use poles. I do because I 
learned with poles, but he didn’t. So he’s back there going like this, going 
look at me. Then he goes, I’m a bat. Kids are crazy skiing.
You never know what’s going to happen. I’ll get back to that later. I go off on 
these tangents in my own mind, but I hope that you can enjoy the ride every 
once in a while. 
Laughter
The mind, treat it with respect. So I try to treat people with respect like I do 
my little guy. It’s the same thing you do as a stage hypnotist. You never 
know what’s going to happen, but you do the best you can. 
If you have somebody that really seems to be having some difficulty, you, 
the trained professional, analytical and highly competent hypnotherapist –
not the stage hypnotist – will use your mind, and you say listen, here’s my 
card. Please give me a call afterwards I’d like to see you. No cost. No

charge. Come and see me in my office the first session is on me. Take care 
of them.
Always take care of them. Be cool that way, if you can. If you’re not in town, 
refer them to somebody that maybe you know that would help you do that. 
Does that make sense? All right. So always do that if you can. It’s the nice 
thing to do.

I hope that’s it’s a good time to ask this question, although the previous 
presentation made it a bit weird now. I want to ask you, what would you 
suggest, how would you cope with people from the college, for example. 
You get on stage, and you have people laughing. How do you deal with 
that? How do you deal with people laughing – because I found it very hard 
to actually induce hypnosis to them.
I’m sorry you find it hard. Why do people laugh? That’s a good question. I 
want to open that up. I want to pick your brains. Let’s find out why they 
laugh. I could sit up here and give you all the answers and I know that if you 
asked that question there are more people that have the same question.
The stage hypnotist has to dance on his feet. Why are they laughing? Let’s 
see if we can figure it out.
A lot of times in street hypnosis, you invade a person’s space or you ask 
them to look into your eyes. The person looking into your eyes, this is very 
intense, they get very nervous and start smiling and laughing. They might 
even do a few other things. 
Interesting. Any other thoughts on that? Why does the person laugh if 
you’re trying to hypnotize them?
I was saying nervousness. 
They’re laughing because they’re nervous?
Yeah. They don’t know what’s going to happen. 
They don’t know what’s going to happen. Could very well be. 
She stole my answer.
I would say it could be an emotional release. They’re losing control a little 
bit and they’re just laughing about it.
They could be having a good time. They could be entertained. 
Yeah, they could be just drunk, if you’re at a 21 and over venue.
They could be with a bunch of their buddies and they don’t want to look like 
the odd man out, so they’re just grouply making fun of or laughing at you.

Could be. Now, I’m going to answer that the best way that I can for you. 
Why do people laugh? Who knows why they laugh. I have no idea, but 
usually laughing and crying are two the extremes. It’s a release of anxiety. 
For example, if a person is laughing it’s just a way for them to release 
tension for the most part. That’s what they’re doing, it’s kind of a way for 
them to let go of tension because they’re kind of nervous to be up there,
that’s one way that the human psyche releases anxiety and apprehension is 
by laughing.
I’ve had people sit there and laugh and laugh and laugh. It’s kind of like, I 
think don’t stop now. Let it out. Just let it out, man. Just go with the flow. 
Get it out of you. They’ll be laughing and laughing and I’ll go okay good. 
Sleep! Just take them down. It’s the same thing. Do you see what I’m 
saying? 
You can use that as a rapid induction, as a shock induction because they’re 
laughing and so it’s kind of like ah, sleep! What? Okay. They may get up 
and laugh at you again. So you just go through it again. Did that answer 
your question?
Yes. Basically, I think you suggested shocking induction, a rapid induction. 
Well, I don’t know that I recommend anything. It’s hard to say because 
every time that you go out and do a performance.
I’m saying that’s a possibility. The bigger answer is I don’t know. I wish I 
could say if this happens, you do this, but it doesn’t work that way. You 
have to be quick on your feet and you just every situation differently. So 
maybe I could do that as a shock induction. It could work beautifully. Maybe 
I could say, listen, I think you’d have a lot more fun laughing out there and 
just take them off the stage. 
A lot of it comes through experience of doing a lot of shows, working with a 
lot of people, learning how to read a person and read your situation on 
stage. I’ve done thousands of shows, thousands. I can’t even count how 
many. I’ve forgotten. Everything is different. The thing is if somebody is 
laughing and you try something and it doesn’t work, do something else.
One size does not fit all in hypnosis, especially on the stage. However, 
when people come to your show – stage hypnotists – they come to whose
show? 
My show.

That’s right. When they come to my show – let’s just pretend it’s your show, 
and they’re out there and you’re doing your group induction, when people 
come and they’re sitting out there, you come out there boldly because they 
have announced you. 
Ladies and Gentlemen, please put your hands together for the world’s 
goofiest hypnotist. Be whatever you want to be, the world’s goofiest 
hypnotist. How many of you out there want to be hypnotized? Oh good you 
do, sit back in your chairs we’re going to have a good time right now. It 
doesn’t matter because you are the commander of the show.
However you want to come across, you come across. However you set 
people at ease is how you do it. However you create rapport, because it’s 
all about creating rapport with your audience and every audience is 
different. If somebody hires you as the world’s goofiest hypnotist, they’re 
expecting the world’s goofiest hypnotist. 
So if you go out there as the world’s goofiest hypnotist and that’s what they 
expect, but you go out there and you’re not, do you think they’d take you 
seriously as being the goofiest? Well, maybe, but probably not. So you lose 
rapport with people right away. That goes back to suggestibility, waking 
suggestions and waking hypnosis. Your show begins with who you are in 
your promotions. 
So when you go out there, you better dang well be that which you are 
because that’s what they expect, nothing different. Don’t try to do a change-
up. Be your genuine authentic self. 
Yeah, not so much a question, but maybe I can get into agreement with you 
on something. It had a little bit to do with what this fellow was saying earlier. 
In my mind – and I think there’s an old saying that life is a stage. I mean 
basically, I went out in the warehouse and did two guys that were on smoke 
breaks that work here. 
What did you do?
Hypnotized them. Point is everywhere is a stage. In other words, in my 
mind I don’t differentiate between a stage with five chairs up there or six 
chairs up there with people getting up there. Even if you’re at a Lion’s Club 
or wherever you’re at, that is stage hypnosis or if you’re in a living room with 
your friends, stage hypnosis. Or you’re at Denny’s, stage hypnosis – in my 
mind.
That’s good because, as you just said, that’s in your mind and that’s a good 
place, because when you begin with it in your mind, that’s where it begins. 
The whole role of the stage hypnotist begins in your mind. My mind. You 
can change your mind at any time, if you don’t mind.

There are times when I don’t want to be a stage hypnotist. When I go to 
Montana, I’m just a dad. I’m just a dad that hangs out with his kid and I kind 
of dig that role. That’s probably my favorite role, just going out there and 
hanging out with my boy, because I have him half the time. I go out there 
and hang out with him, and we just do cool things that dads and kids do – I 
hope most dads and most kids. We just have a blast. 
My son, I’ve got to tell you, man he sees what I do all the time and now he 
goes around going, sleep now. He’s getting it down. The other day he goes 
I want to be in a play. I’m going oh boy, here it comes. Now he wants to be 
in a play. I can see this coming out, another little guy in there.
I want to do some more of these suggestibility tests. Do you guys feel pretty 
good about suggestibility tests? Do you want to practice some more. 
Yeah.
I don’t know. I want to kind of open up this segment to you because I want 
to know what you want from me in the next 20 minutes. I mean we’ve got a 
lot more to do tonight and in the next three days, but what do you want from 
me in the next 20 minutes that revolves around groups and 
demonstrations?
More suggestibility tests.
I hear that one. Shout out loud.
More practice. 
Got it.
Short group inductions.
The ones you had us do are much shorter than the time you allowed for 
yourself to do us.
Oh. How unfair is that? 
I have a question. You had two people stand up here and show us 
something. I’m not sure what we were supposed to get from that and where 
that was supposed to go.
What I wanted to do was I just wanted to have an idea of where people are 
at in their own minds with themselves and with a group. So that was for me 
to see what they’re doing with a group and where their level is.

Let’s go ahead I want to do some more, short group inductions and then 
we’re going to do more suggestibility tests for the next 20 minutes. Is that 
fair? Because I want you guys to go out of here at lunch time or at dinner 
time, and I want you to really use what we’ve done here and get good at it. I 
want you to feel good about what I’ve done here with you. 
I take a lot of shortcuts because I think there’s a quick way to get to doing 
stage hypnosis rapidly without a lot of technical stuff.

The Easiest Group Induction
Spencer:
Let’s do another group thing, and you want to see a faster group thing? Let 
me take you through this one. I did this at the last training at Lowe’s. Those 
of you who were there may remember this. This is a pretty quick one. This 
is another little journey through your mind and you can use this one with a 
group. 
This works beautifully because anybody can do it. There’s absolutely no 
resistance, and that’s what the stage hypnotist may run into more than 
anything is resistance by people saying, I cannot be hypnotized. I cannot do 
any of that. That’s what happens even to the hypnotist. 
What I want you to do is close your eyes. I want you to for just a 
moment imagine that you’re standing out in front of your house. It 
could be an apartment. It could be a duplex. Wherever you live, I 
want you to imagine that you’re standing out there right now looking 
at it, and there’s nobody there inside except you’re going to be going 
there in a moment. 
When you find yourself standing out there in front of that dwelling of 
yours, nod your head, and do that very quickly. Very cool. Let’s go a 
little bit further. Let’s walk up to the door. Walk up to the house. I 
want you in your mind’s eye to go ahead and open the door. Maybe 
you’re turning a knob or hitting a latch. Go ahead and do that.
You’re going to walk inside. There’s nobody there, but as you walk 
inside, I want you to notice the surroundings. I want you to go to your 
front room where there’s maybe some knick-knacks and furniture
whatever’s in there. As you notice that, once again, please nod your 
head. Very good. 
You’ve all been to your home before so you know exactly what that’s 
like, but it’s been a long day. What I want you to do is find a place 
that you can relax. Maybe it’s the couch. Maybe it’s a chair. Find that 
now. Sit down or lie down. 
When you find yourself sitting or lying down, once again nod your 
head, please. Very cool. Now, I want you to notice yourself sitting 
there or lying there, and you’re going to go ahead and sleep for a 
little bit. Maybe you’re going to take five or 10 minutes. 
Take a deep breath in and as you exhale slowly through your mouth, 
just notice yourself sitting there or lying there just going into a deep, 
deep sleep, becoming relaxed and comfortable, everything turning 
loose. 

© Street Hypnosis Publishing All Rights Reserved
26
                                 
As you notice yourself sitting there or lying there going into a deep 
sleep, time is drifting by slowly. It’s almost as if time is speeding up 
now as one minute goes by, two minutes, five minutes has just 
drifted by. Ten minutes. Fifteen minutes has gone by and you’ve 
been sitting there or lying there relaxing.
You notice yourself now sitting there or lying there, and it’s time to 
wake up because you’re starting to feel a little bit hungry. So you 
notice yourself waking up there, and you get up off the couch and 
you go into the kitchen.
In the kitchen, you’re hungry and so you look inside the kitchen for 
something to eat, something that has your name on it. You go into 
the refrigerator or you go into the cupboard and you prepare that 
meal very quickly. Go ahead and just take a bit of it because you are 
hungry. Go ahead and take a bit and really let that roll across your 
tongue in your mouth, taste that. Oh boy, that tastes good.
As you begin to taste that food and have that sensation, rolling down 
across your tongue and down your throat, nod your head once again, 
if you would please. Very good. Yeah, that’s awesome. That’s good. 
Now go ahead and open your eyes. Come all the way back for a 
moment please. Okay, great. 
Now, I’m sitting here and I’m watching each and every one of you. Trust me 
on this, this is a hypnotic induction. What can you do with this? You can do 
many things with this in a group or individually. You’re leading a person 
every step of the way. 
When you find yourself standing out in front of the house, nod your head. 
You get the head nod. All right. They’re with me. Walk up to the door. 
Reach down. When you have the handle, nod your head, another good 
sign. Walk inside. Look around. When you notice all the surroundings, nod 
your head. 
You are on a roll, hypnotist. Notice yourself sitting down or lying down 
because it’s been a long day. Take a couple of deep breaths in. Breath is 
the key to what?
Relaxation.
Relaxation is the key to what?
Suggestions.
Suggestion is the key to what?

We didn’t even tell them what we were doing, did we? We’re hypnotizing 
these people. See yourself relaxing there. Take a deep breath and just 
relax, all the way down. Take a minute, take five, take 10, however long you 
need. But now it’s time to open your eyes and get up and go into kitchen 
because you’re really hungry. 
So you get up and when you notice yourself getting up, nod your head. 
Going into the kitchen and looking around, finding something good to eat. 
Eat it. Take a bite. Taste it. Savor it. Experience it on your tongue and in 
your mouth. That’s delicious, isn’t it? Nod your head. When you really got 
that, open your eyes. 
Okay, now I’m curious. When I point to you, tell me what you ate. 
Sushi. 
Cake.
Swiss and pepperoni sandwich.
Cheerios.
Can you see what’s happening here. We’ve just taken a group 
demonstration, a suggestibility test, is all it is. Now can you take that and 
turn that into an induction? Or are we already induced? I mean there’s a 
fine line there.
Even when you do a suggestibility, just think about it. Is it already an 
induction, or are you following through with an induction just to deepen the 
trance? As a performer, you are there to perform. You already know that a 
person is in trance, when a person steps up to your stage.
If you’ve done your job right, most of the time, because there are still times 
when you’ll have to drop people off the stage, when you’ve done this kind of 
a presentation. Beforehand you already know you’ve got a stage full of 
people, who are already in trance, before you even begin to do your show
and the rest of it is fluff, filler and presentation. Your style and this is where 
you get to shine. 
People, believe it or not, like to see people getting hypnotized for some 
crazy reason. Even though you’re doing this out there already to everybody, 
it’s like those of you who really have something good, who can really feel 
yourself salivating, I want you guys to come on up here and have a seat. 
Let’s have some fun.

How many of you salivated? Raise your hands if you salivated. All right. 
Good. We’ve got a bunch of you that salivated. You salivaters come on up 
here. You see? I want you salivaters. You bring them on up because you 
know you’ve got yourself some very good subjects. 
Even though you’ve got your good subjects up here – the salivaters – you 
still may have some people up here that won’t go any further than that, and 
you’ll have to send them off the stage. No big deal. Make it a part of your 
show. Don’t be stressed out about it. 
What I want you to do is, go ahead and pick somebody you have not 
worked with yet please. I’ll give you like three minutes to run through that
and then the other person, do it to the other one. Let’s run through that.
Remember, you’re doing a simple visualization that’s very simple that 
anybody can do.

address that. Her question for me was – she was wondering – she said, I 
don’t know that I feel comfortable if I’m out there in the real world having a 
guy come down on my happy place. 
That’s a good question because in different cultures, for example, over in 
Saudi Arabia. You do not touch the ladies. You do not touch their head. You 
keep your distance. How do you do hypnosis that way?
Here, the thing is well, can we do this without – it’s like, I don’t want a guy 
down there. I don’t want that impression. Simple. You can do something like 
this. Just close your eyes and just sleep. So just do that and just keep them 
off of that part like that. Does that make sense? Or you can do the same 
thing. You can be next them and say, just close your eyes, just sleep. Just 
keep their head – you can control the environment at all times. 
Does that make sense to you guys? All right. Do you guys know how to do 
that? Are you comfortable with that? Okay, good.
I feel comfortable in here. I’m just thinking out in the world. 
The other thing you can do if you’re working with somebody of the opposite 
sex, it’s the same thing. You can simply just have him sit down and do 
nothing else. Have him sit down and just say, take a deep breath, and just 
close your eyes and just sleep. So you can do the same thing without 
having to get them close. 
There are always ways around that. Open your eyes come all the way back. 
You guys know how to do that, correct? You’re comfortable with hypnotizing 
people just sitting there. It’s the same thing or standing up without having all 
those touchy things. Are you good?
Yeah.
All right. Thank you. Okay, good.

Now, do you feel like you’ve learned something cool in this last session that 
you can take out there into the real world?
Yes.
Everything is building on top of one another.

All right. Who is the youngest person in here? I’m looking at this guy right 
here, and I’m kind of curious. How old are you?
I turned 16 on June 3rd.
He turned 16 on June 3rd.

Why are you here? I want to know this for myself. 
He wants to get into bars.
His dad made him come. Oh, I see. This is his dad right here. Why are you 
here?
I think hypnosis is a powerful skill. As Igor said at the beginning, it’s a skill 
you can have for the rest of your life. You can also use it to help other 
people, and I might use it to go into the field of medicine. I might now, but 
either way, I’ll always have something I can use to help other people and 
help yourself.
Very cool. All right, good.

I wanted to know that because the first time I ever did hypnosis, I was 12 
years old. So what sparked my imagination was when I was 12 years old, I 
had a girlfriend and she taught me how to hypnotize her. Her father was in 
the Navy and it just was like playing Simon Says when I was 12, right? I 
never forget that experience, and it just stayed with me forever. Here I am. 
Now that I’m 22, I’m still doing it.
Laughter
Hey, what are you laughing about? Come on.
Benjamin Button.
Benjamin Button. I’m curious, aren’t I? And you’re going to be curious about 
just how young I am. I think with that, I think we’ve got about another minute 
left. You guys got some good skills. I would encourage you during dinner to 
eat dinner because we’ve got more stuff coming at you.

We’re going to take everything that we’ve learned today, we’re going to 
wrap it up all into one package and see how it all works together so that we 
can all do it as a group, going from A to Z with everything we’ve learned 
today because tomorrow we’ve got a huge day coming at you too. Yes, we 
have 10 seconds.
Is it appropriate in stage hypnosis to do the one where you fall back? Do 
you know what I mean?
The sway test? Good question. He’s talking about the sway test. Let’s take 
dinner, after dinner I’ll take a few minutes and show you how to do the 
backward sway test. It’s very cool.
