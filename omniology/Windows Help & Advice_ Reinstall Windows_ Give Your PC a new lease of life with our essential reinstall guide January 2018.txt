Windows 10 is a fantastic thing 
– an ever-evolving smorgasbord 
of PC operating system goodness 
that brings new features and 
enhancements with every major 
update. In this issue we’re taking 
an in-depth look at the latest: the 
Fall Creators Update, which makes 
it easier than ever to get creative 
on your PC – and brings Windows 
Mixed Reality to the AR/VR table. 
There’s even a new look-and-feel 
in places, thanks to Microsoft’s 
Fluent Design – you can find out 
all about it on page 58.
Of course, with every Windows 
update come some brickbats too, 
so on page 12 we’re going to 
show you how to reinstall 
Windows from scratch, making 
your PC run faster, leaner and 
meaner than ever before.
And in our Explore section, 
starting on page 23, we’ll show 
you how to do all kinds of 
incredible things with your PC 
– from creating animated 
GIFs to mirroring your 
desktop on your TV.

The Knowledge…
4K is a real buzzword at the moment, and 
many of us have taken the leap and 
upgraded our TVs. Microsoft’s hardware 
division is keeping pace; hot on the heels of 
Sony’s 4K-compatible PS4 Pro comes the 
brand new Xbox One X (£449), a substantially 
upgraded version of its flagship console. It 
even one-ups Sony’s competitor, packing 
enough power on board to run games at a 
native 3,840x2,160 pixels, taking full 
advantage of the abilities of 4K screens.

The latest US series, exclusive content, 
classic movies – it’s all there. Netflix 
doesn’t publish numbers, but it’s 
estimated that over six million people in 
the UK subscribe to the Internet 
streaming service, with more signing up 
every day. It’s brilliant, but there’s a lot you 
can do with it than you might realise.
Fancy enjoying the latest shows with 
someone else? Open the Google Chrome 
web browser on your Windows PC and 
install the Netflix 
Party extension 
(netflixparty.com). It 
synchronises video 
playback between 
everyone who’s 
joined a specific 
party and offers a 
built-in chat, enabling you to create an 
impromptu movie night (with the 
all-important acerbic commentary) even 
if you’re geographically distinct from your 
friends and family.
Another Chrome extension worth 
trying is FlixPlus (http://bit.ly/2jEnazn), 
which adds ratings information from 
IMDB and Rotten Tomatoes, hides spoiler 
text for a more seamless and surprising 
viewing experience, lets you watch 
random episodes of series, and even 
fades out or tints content you’ve already 
watched so you don’t sit through it again. 
Netflix’s selection is vast, to say the 
least, so if you’re struggling to work out 
what to watch you might find yourself 
clicking through the categories. Only, 
well, they’re often not very useful. Netflix 
sorts its content 
much more finely 
than it might first 
appear, and that can 
really help you 
burrow down to the 
sort of things that 
you really want to 
watch; visit netflixcodes.me in your web 
browser and you’ll be able to choose 
from a much broader selection of narrow 
categories. And if you still can’t decide 
what to watch, then netflixroulette.com is 
the website for you. It will spin up a 
random selection from Netflix that’s 
surely worth a look.
Millions of us watch quality programming through Netflix, 
but you could be watching it better. here’s how…
The great  
Emoji debate
there’s a debate?
Oh yes. A hot one. And it’s gone straight 
to the top. After a Twitter user noted that 
Google’s version of the cheeseburger 
emoji ordered the ingredients in 
completely the wrong order – placing the 
cheese below the burger patty – Google 
CEO Sundar Pichai promised to “drop 
everything” to fix the egregious ordering if 
a consensus could be reached.
so it’s been fixed?
Well, not as of press time. But that stacking 
silliness is just the tip of the emoji iceberg. 
The Unicode Consortium, the non-profit 
group which decides which characters 
appear in the international unicode 
standard – a character library which 
includes the entire emoji canon – is in the 
middle of a big debate about what 
constitutes a viable emoji.
What’s the matter?
The Unicode Consortium releases new 
emoji (and other characters) in major 
updates, the next of which is due in mid 
2018. The next batch, currently standing at 
nearly 50 additional entries, includes a 
number of proposed emoji which are 
dividing members of the Consortium.
like what?
Perhaps the most contentious entry is 
labeled ‘Frowning pile of poo’, and it’s just 
that: a version of the inexplicably popular 
emoji with that stupid grin wiped off its 
face. The proposal that suggested its 
inclusion ran to a comprehensive 12 
pages, but some in the Unicode 
Consortium feel it’s a step too far.
does this even matter?
That depends on who you ask. To some, 
emoji are simply annoying, infantile 
graphics that add nothing to conversation. 
To others, they’re increasingly a part of 
worldwide language, and the catalogue 
deserves to grow and grow – although the 
fact that different apps and services use 
different visual representations of them  
– iOS vs Android, for example – means 
they’re unavoidably ambiguous at times.
NeW look the xbox one x – as well as its elder 
siblings – get a new, upgraded interface.
good looks every game in the xbox library gets 
a visual upgrade, even if you don’t own a 4k tV.
old look the xbox one x strongly resembles the

When is a turtle not a turtle? When it’s a 
rifle. Or maybe a stealth bomber is actually 
a dog. A human would know, but recent 
research from Kyushu University in Japan 
suggests that image-analysing Artificial 
Intelligence (AI) engines – previously 
considered reliable – can be thrown 
completely off course by changing just one 
pixel in an image. Items that AI engines had 
no problem identifying previously instead 
threw up random results, and researchers 
don’t yet know why – but it has technology 
firms concerned, 
with the likes of 
Google and 
Facebook now 
working with 
their own sets  
of ‘adversarial 
images’ to see if 
they can come 
up with a 
suitable solution. 
This may not 
immediately sound worrying, but image 
recognition is fast becoming something 
that our lives rely on. Tesla has been trialling 
an autopilot mode for its existing cars, and 
many companies are working on their own 
self-driven vehicles; if a vulnerability like 
this exists in those cars’ cameras, the result 
could be a highly confused two-ton death 
machine doing its own thing on the roads. 
That’s a doomsday scenario, but since some 
self-driving cars have already been shown 
to have vulnerabilities to carefully placed 
lasers (which, admittedly also tend to affect 
humans), the big names in AI are right to fix 
each and every potential problem.
rise of the  robots
Less dangerous AI is already in action all 
over the web. Companies frequently make 
use of neural networks (essentially very 
limited artificial brains) to target ads and 
identify trends online. Others, such as 
Janelle Shane 
(aiweirdness.
com) use them to 
automatically 
generate funny 
Dungeons & 
Dragons spells or 
new My Little 
Ponies. But some 
see the rapidly-
developing world 
of AI, and its 
ever-reaching roots, as a massive potential 
problem. Tesla’s Elon Musk, for example, 
expressed concern at the recent World 
Government Summit about AI scientists 
being “so engrossed in their work that they 
don’t really realise the ramifications of what 
they’re doing”, and has invested millions of 
dollars into researching AI’s vulnerabilities. 
The robot revolution is still a way off – with 
luck, AI will know what it’s doing by then.
As AI makes more and more of an impact on our lives,  
can it really be trusted to know what it’s doing?

We’d be surprised if you hadn’t heard of 
Google Maps by now. It’s just about the 
only way we at Windows Help & Advice 
have any idea where we are in the world. 
But here’s a trick you might not know: 
switch to satellite view, and use your 
mousewheel (or the minus buttons on 
screen) to zoom out all the way. Keep 
going, and a sidebar will pop up, enabling 
you to check out a whole host of other 
celestial bodies, all the way from the 
Moon to Venus to Pluto. You can even 
jump inside the International Space 
Station (ISS) for an interactive tour; click 
the circles highlighting many elements, 
and you’ll be given more information on 
the controls, modules and gadgets on 
board. The lack of an up direction can 
make the ISS a little tricky to navigate, so 
try using the arrow keys to move through 
its corridors rather than the mouse.
Out Of this wOrld take a tour of the

Windows 10 
The best way to reinstall
Christmas 2017  |  
  |  13
L
Make your next Windows reinstall a better 
experience, with the help of Nick Peers
ong bootup times and 
sluggish performance 
are just two of the 
tell-tale signs that your 
Windows installation is 
in need of a complete do-over – 
especially if you haven’t done so for 
a couple of years. That was certainly 
the case with one of the desktop PCs 
in the Windows Help & Advice office 
– despite having 16GB of RAM, a fast 
SSD boot drive and a quad-core 
processor on board, Windows took 
what seemed like an age to get 
going and its overall performance 
simply wasn’t what it was.
Unsurprising, really: Since we last 
wiped the drive, we’d installed three 
major Windows 10 updates – the 
Anniversary Edition, the Creators 
Update and the Fall Creators Update 
and Windows had ballooned to an 
immodest 90GB of drive space. It was 
obviously time for an overhaul, but 
experience has taught us a few 
lessons along the way. Some go back 
to the early days of Windows; others 
are peculiar to Windows 10.
And that’s where this feature 
comes in. We’re going to take you on 
the ultimate Windows reinstall tour, 
whether you’re installing Windows 7, 
8.1, or 10. You’ll discover that the 
actual physical act of reinstalling is 
the simplest bit, so we’ll step you 
through everything you need to do 
to preserve all your data, transfer 
your settings across the reinstall 
divide, and ensure that nothing gets 
left behind – just in case.
We’ll show you how to prep for 
your reinstall by bringing all your key 
apps, drivers, and licenses into one 
place (oh, and don’t forget to 
uninstall apps that need deactivating 
prior to reinstalling). You’ll also 
discover how to source the latest 
version of your Windows install media 
for a cleaner, more up-to-date install 
out of the box. (We’ll also reveal a 
tool that gives you the power to craft 
your ultimate reinstall disc).
We’ll step you through the install 
process, but crucially, we’ll be on 
hand to guide you through the 
post-setup phase: Get Windows up 
and running again, reinstall core 
apps, restore links to your data 
folders, bring back your app settings, 
and – for good measure – install a 
snapshotting backup regimen that 
enables you to roll back your PC 
quickly when the need arises. Long 
story short, everything you need is 
here. Enough preamble – let’s 
reinstall Windows!
REINSTALL
WIND   WS
THE BEST WAY TO

14  |  
  |  Christmas 2017
Step one of the 
reinstall process is 
to make sure that 
your PC is fully 
backed up. Let’s 
begin by taking a 
fail-safe drive image 
of your computer in its current state. 
Not only does this give you something 
to roll back to if the reinstall process 
fails for any reason, but it also ensures 
that every scrap of your current 
configuration – including programs and 
their settings – are accessible in case 
you need to refer to or access them 
after performing the install.
There are plenty of good third-party 
drive-imaging tools out there, but for 
the purposes of your fail-safe image, 
let’s stick with the Windows 7 Backup 
and Restore tool. The quickest way to 
launch it in any version of Windows 
– including Windows 10 – is to press 
[Win] + [R] to open the Run dialog, then 
type ‘sdclt.exe’ and press [Enter]. Click 
‘Create a system image’, choose your 
backup drive as the destination, and 
click Next. By default, your system 
partitions should be selected, so verify 
that there’s enough space on your 
target drive – the actual backup will be 
smaller than the size indicated – and 
click Next again.
With your fail-safe backup in place, 
it’s time to turn your attention to your 
data. If you’ve been diligently backing 
up your files using File History or the 
Windows Backup and Restore tool, you 
should be covered, although if you’re 
using the latter, open it, and click ‘Back 
up now’ to ensure it’s fully up to date. 
Another option is to move your data 
to a different drive or partition, so it’s 
left untouched when you reinstall 
Windows. You’ll need to fix permissions 
after reinstalling, but we’ll cover that in 
due course. If you don’t have a second 
storage drive available (make sure it’s 
not your backup drive), check out the 
box below for details of partitioning 
your system drive in two. Once set up, 
create a user folder on the root of your 
new drive or partition, then open File 
Explorer, and start moving user folders 
over to the new drive by right-clicking 
each in turn, and choosing Properties, 
then the Location tab. Click ‘Move’ to 
select the corresponding folder on your 
data drive, then choose Yes when 
prompted, and all your files are moved 
to the new drive. If you have cloud 
folders hosted on your system drive, 
don’t forget to move them now, too – 
this will save you the bother of a 
lengthy resync post-install. In this case, 
copy rather than move the files – you 
can link your cloud sync app to the 
correct folder after reinstallation.
This is a key part of 
the reinstallation 
process. If you want 
to avoid having to 
meticulously record 
all of your program 
settings, the best 
thing to do is find ways of backing 
them up. Start by downloading the free 
portable tool CloneApp from www.
mirinsoft.com (go to Download 
Resources > CloneApp – Portable). 
Right-click ‘cloneapp.zip’, and choose 
Extract All – save it to your backup 
Partition your drive
You need a secondary (not 
backup) drive if you want to 
separate data from Windows. 
If you don’t have one, you 
can partition your main drive 
in two to separate Windows 
and your apps from your 
documents, photos, portable 
apps, and any files not 
directly tied into Windows.
It is possible to partition 
using the Disk Management 
tool (type ‘diskmgmt.msc’ 
into the Run dialog box), but 
if files are situated at the end 
of the drive, you won’t be 
able to partition it to the size 
you want. Instead, download 
and install AOMEI Partition 
Assistant (http://bit.
ly/2AXfGuV).
Ascertain how you wish to 
split your drive in two – 
typically look to allocate 
64GB or more of space for 
your Windows partition, 
depending on the number of 
apps and games you use, 
leaving the rest for your data. 
If you’re currently low on 
space, temporarily move your 
data off the drive while you 
create the second partition.
Launch Partition Assistant, 
select your Windows drive 
(typically drive C), and click 
Check Partition. Choose ‘Scan 
and Repair’, and reboot to let 
it do its work. Once complete, 
restart Partition Assistant, 
select drive C again, and this 
time choose Resize/Move 
Partition. Use the slider to 
shrink the drive by the 
amount you wish to free up 
for your data partition. Be 
sure to leave at least 5GB 
(preferably more) of free 
space for your system drive. If 
partitioning a solid-state 
drive (SSD), click Advanced, 
and select ‘Allow partition 
alignment’. Click ‘OK’.
Next, select the unused 
space, and click Create 
Partition. Leave all available 
space allocated, and File 
System set to NTFS. Click 
‘Advanced’ to set a label (such 
as Data), but leave all other 
settings alone. Click ‘OK’, then 
Apply. Review your changes, 
and click Proceed. Reboot 
when prompted – the new 
drive should then appear, 
ready for your data.

drive (or portable apps folder if you 
have one), then open the CloneApp 
folder, right-click ‘CloneApp.exe’, and 
choose ‘Run as administrator’.
A list of supported apps is displayed. 
Click ‘Select Installed’, and CloneApp 
automatically selects all the 
applications in its database that you 
have installed – including some handy 
Windows settings, such as Library and 
network settings. go through the list, 
unchecking those you have no plans to 
restore along with Windows.
To see what’s being backed up, click 
‘What is being backed up’, and a 
complete list of apps and their settings 
– such as Registry entries or associated 
folders – is displayed. If you click Start 
CloneApp, these settings and files are 
backed up. Simply uncheck an item to 
exclude it from the backup, and then 
click update when you’re ready.
Not all your programs will be 
supported here, but you can still 
back up their settings using 
CloneApp if you can identify where 
they’re stored – either in the Registry 
or in a specific folder. You should 
start your search under the C:\
user\<username>\AppData and  
C:\ProgramData folders, as well as 
the app’s own folder under C:\
Program Files or C:\Program Files 
(x86). Also, open the Registry Editor 
(type ‘regedit’ into the Run dialog), 
and look under the HkEY_CuRRENT_
uSER\SOFTWARE Registry key for any 
subkeys related to your apps.
Once you’ve identified where they 
are, click the Custom button in 
CloneApp, and click the appropriate 
buttons – Files, Folders, or Registry 
keys – to manually add these 
locations. If you’re struggling to 
locate them, try googling the 
program name, along with words 
such as ‘backup’ and ‘settings’, or 
explore the app’s own preferences or 
settings for an option to ‘export 
settings’ to back them up manually.
Another important consideration 
is any saved games you have – try 
the free gameSave Manager tool 
from www.gamesave-manager.com, 
where you’ll find that its database 
supports over 5,000 games.
Now might also be the time to 
consider migrating to portable apps 
where you can – these can be stored 
on your PC’s data drive, and will 
survive all your Windows reinstalls 
with their settings intact. use the 
PortableApps.com platform tool 
(https://portableapps.com) to 
manage and launch them – you can 
download and install apps from 
here, or manually add them to the 
PortableApps folder inside their 
own folder. Then open the 
PortableApps.com platform, and 
click Apps > Refresh App Icons to 
bring them into the program menu.
The ultimate reinstall disc
If you want full control, 
then it’s possible to 
create the ultimate 
customised install media. 
But be warned: It’s for 
technically-proficient PC 
users only.
Download and install 
the free version of NTLite 
from www.ntlite.com. 
Once set up, launch the 
app. The simplest way to 
use it is in conjunction 
with a previously created 
installation USB flash 
drive – with that plugged 
in, click Add to select the 
drive containing your 
Windows install files. The 
OS should appear in the 
list – click it to mount it.
Once the source has 
been added, several 
options appear down the 
left-hand side of the 
NTLite window. Start 
with Components – read 
the warning – it’s a good 
idea to test your 
customised Windows 
install in a virtual 
environment, such as 
VirtualBox, as advised 
– and click OK. From 
here, you can remove 
various components 
– including drivers, 
selected apps, and 
localization files – to slim 
down the size of your 
install media and 
subsequent Windows 
install. You’ll see some 
options are marked in 
blue and greyed out 
– you need to pay for a 
full license (from £42.90) 
to access these.
The Configure section 
enables you to choose 
which elements are 
pre-installed, and which 
ones need to be 
manually enabled after 
installation – you can 
disable Internet Explorer 
11 and Windows Media 
Player, and enable 
Hyper-V support out of 
the box, for example.
Go to Integrate to 
slipstream Windows 
Updates and Drivers into 
the media – these will be 
automatically installed 
after Windows, so while 
lengthening the overall 
install time, it saves you 
the hassle of doing so 
manually. Finally, the 
Automate section 
enables you to skip some 
of the setup questions.
Once done, apply your 
changes, then – if 
necessary – generate a 
new ISO file, which you 
can burn to disc or copy 
to a USB flash drive using 
a tool such as Rufus 
(https://rufus.akeo.ie).
If you switch to portable apps, you save time configuring them.

Before going any 
further, make sure 
that you have the 
program media you 
need – install CDs 
and DVDs, plus any 
product keys. If you 
purchased digitally, simply make sure 
you have access to your online account, 
or check your email for the keys you 
need. If you’re struggling to track down 
product keys, a free portable tool such 
as License Crawler (www.klinzmann.
name – use the ‘Mirror ServeSr (1)’ link 
on the Download page – can track 
down the information you need.
go through your list of programs for 
those that require activation – some, 
such as Nitro Pro, need to be 
deactivated or uninstalled before you 
reinstall Windows. Scour the Taskbar 
and Taskbar Notification area, as well as 
the Start menu, for any apps that you 
may have forgotten about.
Also consider your drivers. Driver 
backup tools are available, but a neater 
solution is to source your own core 
drivers now, if required. Most drivers 
can be reinstalled after Windows – 
many even come as part of Windows 
itself – but it’s important that you 
check whether specific drivers are 
covered. These include your display 
drivers – particularly for older AMD 
cards – as well as network drivers, 
enabling you to get back online.
If Windows was pre-installed on 
your PC, don’t assume your drivers are 
guaranteed to come back when you 
reinstall. Instead, visit your PC 
manufacturer’s website now to source 
drivers for the version of Windows that 
you plan to install. You should find 
most here – if your PC is self-built, the 
motherboard manufacturer’s website is 
a rich source of drivers, too.
If you can’t find supported drivers 
for your version of Windows, drivers for 
an older version – such as Windows 7 
for Windows 10 – may still work if 
required, so long as they’re the same 
system type (either 32-bit or 64-bit) as 
your version of Windows.
Finally, if you open Device Manager 
(type ‘devmgmt.msc’ into the Run 
dialog), you can see what drivers are 
installed for your hardware – double-
click an item and switch to the Driver 
tab. If the Digital Signer states 
‘Microsoft Windows Hardware 
Compatibility Publisher’, it’s likely that 
the driver will be installed along with 
Windows; if the provider is Microsoft, 
then it’s a given.
Time to reinstall, 
right? Wrong. You 
may already have a 
Windows install CD 
– particularly if 
you’re rolling back 
to an earlier version 
Creating a fresh install of 
Windows is often seen as
the ultimate solution to 
any problem – whether 
it’s hardware, software or 
Windows install-related.
However, completely 
reinstalling Windows 
maybe overkill if the 
problem is simply with 
Windows itself. If your PC 
is functioning perfectly 
other than in specific 
instances –  such as 
Microsoft Edge no longer 
working after the Fall 
Creators Update, for 
example – a repair install 
may be a better option.
Repair installs simply 
overwrite the Windows 
files on your machine – 
leaving your apps, 
programs (including 
settings), and any data on 
your system drive 
untouched, at least in 
theory. Performing a 
repair install varies 
between each version of 
Windows, but each 
procedure shares one 
common characteristic: 
You have to be able to 
boot into Windows to 
launch the repair from the 
Windows desktop.
If you’re using either 
Windows 7 or 10, you can 
can insert your Windows 
install media and launch 
the installation process 
from there. When 
prompted, choose the 
Custom option to 
‘upgrade’ your existing 
installation. If your 
Windows 10 media isn’t 
the latest version, run the 
Media Creation Tool 
instead, and choose the 
Upgrade option from 
there – make sure you 
select the option to keep 
personal files and apps 
before clicking Install.
Windows 8.1 provides a 
handy ‘refresh’ option, 
which enables you to 
reinstall Windows over 
the top of itself – access 
this from ‘Change PC 
settings’ > ‘Update and 
recovery’ > Recovery, 
then click ‘Get started’ 
under Refresh.
The installation process 
is identical to performing 
a full reinstall, but at the 
end of it, your programs 
and data are untouched; 
only Windows gets 
refreshed, hopefully 
resolving whatever 
problems you’ve been 
having. Note: It’s a 
lengthy process, so be 
prepared to wait an hour 
or more, depending on 
the speed and state of 
your computer. 
Repair, not reinstall

of Windows – but it may not be the 
latest version. Why force yourself to 
install more Windows updates than 
necessary – the Fall Creators update for 
Windows 10, or Service Pack 1 for 
Windows 7, for example – when you 
can download and create the latest 
version of your Windows install media, 
which comes with these updates 
pre-installed? Not only do you save 
yourself time, but you also ensure that 
your install is as clean as possible.
You need one of two things for your 
install media: either a blank DVD – or 
possibly two – or a large enough uSB 
flash drive (typically 8gB or larger). The 
latter is preferable, because installing 
from this is much quicker than via DVD, 
but check that your PC can boot from 
uSB drives before proceeding – any PC 
worth its salt from the last decade 
should be able to, but check with your 
PC’s manufacturer before proceeding.
If you would like to craft the 
ultimate reinstall disc – complete with 
more slipstreamed updates and 
Windows configured just so – check 
out the box on NTLite (see page 15). 
Windows 7 users who want to 
create reinstall media with Service 
Pack 1 slipstreamed into it should head 
to www.microsoft.com/software-
download/windows7 – you need to 
provide your Windows product key, 
and you’re pointed toward one of two 
ISO downloads for 32-bit and 64-bit. 
unless your PC is incredibly old, 64-bit 
is the preferred choice. It enables you 
to use more than 4gB of RAM, and 
offers better performance.
One key consideration may be older 
hardware – check that you can source 
64-bit drivers, or you may have to 
replace the hardware or stick with the 
32-bit version instead.
Once you’ve downloaded the ISO 
file, grab the Windows uSB/DVD 
Download Tool from https://wudt.
codeplex.com – this enables you to 
create your Windows 7 install media 
from the ISO file.
Things are simpler if you want to 
reinstall Windows 8.1 (go to www.
microsoft.com/software-download/
windows8) or Windows 10 (www.
microsoft.com/software-download/
windows10). Both versions of the 
Media Creation Tool enable you to 
download the latest version of the 
installer files – the Fall Creators update, 
for example – and burn a DVD or 
create a bootable uSB flash drive.
Now it’s finally time 
to ditch your 
underperforming, 
glitchy Windows for 
a brand new install. 
You’re all backed 
up, your data has 
been moved to a new partition or 
drive, and you’ve sourced any key 
drivers you might need.
First, insert the install media and 
restart your PC. If it’s set to look for a 
bootable DVD or uSB drive, you’ll see a 
message inviting you to press any key 
to boot from a CD or DVD – press it 
and jump to the next paragraph. If not, 
look for a message inviting you to 
enter the boot menu. When the menu 
appears, select your DVD drive or uSB 
flash drive from the list, and press 
[Enter] on your keyboard; if two entries 
exist, try the one marked uEFI first.
If you’re using Windows 8 or 
Windows 10, you may find no options 
appear on startup – this is down to 
Make sure you note down your product keys and licenses.
Fix permissions
When you hive off your data to 
a separate partition or drive, 
you may have issues accessing 
your user folders after 
reinstalling Windows. That’s 
because they’re ‘owned’ by 
your current user account, and 
when you reinstall Windows, 
you’ll end up creating a new 
user account, even if it’s 
identical to your old one.
In most cases, when you first 
try to access one of these 
folders – when you point 
Windows toward them, say 
– you’re told access is denied, 
but are prompted to click 
Continue to gain permanent 
access. This usually resolves the 
issue, adding your current user 
account to the list of users who 
have been permitted access. If 
this fails, you need to manually 
take control of the folder. 
Right-click it, and choose 
Properties, then the Security 
tab. If there aren’t any read 
permissions, click Advanced, 
followed by Continue. Next, 
click Add, followed by ‘Select a 
principal’, before clicking 
Advanced > Find Now.
You have a choice – if you 
share your PC with others, 
select your username; if you’re 
the only user, you could select 
‘Everyone’, which saves the 
hassle of having to repeat this 
process every time you reinstall 
Windows, although if it’s a 
laptop, ask yourself if you want 
the data accessible to anyone 
who might steal it. Click ‘OK’ 
twice, and you should now be 
able to assign basic permissions 
– choose Full Control if you 
were the previous owner of the 
folder. Click ‘OK’, select ‘Replace 
all child objects’, and click Apply 
> OK. Click ‘OK’ twice, and you 
should now have access. If 
you’re feeling zealous, 
right-click the folder again, and 
choose Properties, then the 
Security tab. Click ‘Edit’, then 
select each ‘Account unknown’ 
entry – a reference to earlier 
Windows installations – and 
click Remove followed by OK to 
get rid of them all.

your PC’s ultra-fast boot setting. If this 
is the case, boot back into Windows, 
then navigate to Settings > ‘update & 
Security > Recovery, and click ‘Restart 
now’. When the ‘Advanced start-up’ 
menu appears, click ‘use a Device’ to 
select your boot device.
If you’re downgrading from Windows 
8.1 or 10 to Windows 7, you need to 
tweak some uEFI settings – from the 
‘Advanced start-up’ menu, choose 
Troubleshoot > ‘Advanced options’ > 
uEFI Firmware Settings. Now look for 
the Fast Boot and Secure Boot settings, 
disabling both. If there’s a CSM 
(Compatibility Support Module) 
setting, make sure it’s enabled. Once 
done, save your settings and exit, then 
start the reinstall process.
The install process 
is practically 
identical across 
Windows 7, 8.1, and 
10. When the 
Windows Setup 
wizard starts, verify 
that the language, time, and currency, 
and keyboard are all set to your chosen 
language. Click ‘Next’, followed by 
Install Now. If you’re using Windows 8.1 
or Windows 10, you’ll be prompted for 
your product key. If you’re using 
Windows 10 you can skip this step if 
you’ve upgraded to Windows 10 from 
Windows 7 or 8.1, because your license 
is digital and is tied to your computer; 
Windows will activate automatically 
after the install has completed.
If prompted to choose a Windows 
edition, select the one you’re currently 
running – typically Home. Click ‘Next’, 
agree to the license agreement, and 
then click Next again. Now select 
‘Custom: Install Windows only 
(advanced)’ by clicking it.
A list of available drives appears – 
your current Windows partition should 
be selected by default, but check that 
the size, type (Primary), and free space 
match what you expect. Click ‘Format’ 
to wipe the drive, then click Ok to 
confirm the warning. With the drive 
selected, click Next.
There are two distinct phases to the 
installation process. First, files are 
copied and prepared for installation. 
Then Windows starts installing features 
and updates. It then informs you that it 
needs to restart – this should happen 
automatically, or you can click Restart 
Now to do so manually.
If prompted to boot from CD or DVD, 
don’t press anything. You’ll see the 
Windows logo appear, then a series of 
messages pop up about ‘preparing 
devices’ and ‘getting ready’. Windows 
may restart several times.
This stage of the 
process is simple 
enough if you’re 
using Windows 7: 
Simply enter your 
product key when 
prompted, and 
follow the prompts to set up a user 
account, and get going. The same is 
true for Windows 8.1, although its 
Express Settings option isn’t as 
pervasive as Windows 10’s.
Windows 10 first asks you about your 
location and keyboard, sorts out your 
network connection (including any 
Wi-Fi configuration), then asks you 
whether you’re setting up for personal 
use or for an organisation. Personal is 
the choice for most. You’re then 
prompted to sign in with your 
Microsoft account – if you want to stick 
with an old-school local user account 
for now, click ‘Offline account’, 
followed by ‘Maybe later’.
If signing into your Microsoft 
account, you go through the usual 
procedure, including any additional 
verification or authentication you may 
have set up. You’re prompted to set up 
a PIN, then asked to set up Cortana. 
This is the point where your privacy 
comes into play, so review all the 
options carefully, flicking the slider to 
Off for any you don’t need or use.
That’s the end of the setup process 
– Windows now configures itself based 
on your choices, and you’ll see a series 
of messages appear on the screen. 
Eventually – when all is ready – you’ll 
find yourself back at the familiar 
Windows 10 desktop.
Now that the 
Windows desktop  
is back, you should 
notice things are 
much quicker. They 
won’t remain this 
fast, though – not 
once you’ve reinstalled your core apps 
and settings – but you’ll still end up 
with a much quicker computer than 
before once you’re done.
Let’s start by bringing your Windows 
install fully up to date. Windows 
update should already be operating in 
the background, but you can move

Set up snapshots
The Windows drive-imaging 
tool is fine for occasional 
image-based backups, but if 
you want to regularly back 
up your entire Windows 
installation without running 
out of drive space – handy if 
you want to test software, 
then roll things back without 
making permanent changes 
to your system, for example 
– you need a tool that offers 
differential backup images, 
such as Macrium Reflect 
Free (www.macrium.com/
reflectfree.aspx). Differential 
images only record the 
changes made since the last 
backup was taken, reducing 
their file size dramatically.
Once you’ve installed 
Macrium Reflect Free 
(create the rescue media 
when prompted, in case of 
disaster), click ‘Create an 
image of the partition(s) 
required to back up and 
restore Windows’. Select a 
suitable location on your 
backup drive, then click 
Next. Click the Template 
drop-down menu, and 
choose Differential Backup 
Set to create a schedule that 
makes a monthly full drive 
image, then daily differential 
images – select Differential, 
then Edit Schedule to 
change this (to a weekly 
schedule, for example).
To stop you running out 
of spare drive space, tweak 
Macrium Reflect Free’s 
Define Retention Rules by 
weeks, days, or number of 
backups. Click ‘Next’ to 
review your settings – click 
Advanced Options > Auto 
Verify Image, and check the 
box to automatically verify 
your drive image after it’s 
created. Click ‘OK’, followed 
by Finish. You need to enter 
your account password to 
enable scheduled backups, 
and Macrium is set up to 
back up automatically going 
forward, but you need to 
create your first backup: 
Switch to the Backup 
Definition Files tab, select 
your backup definition file, 
and click Run, choosing Full 
from the drop-down menu.
If you’re diligent, create 
another backup job from 
here to periodically back up 
to an alternative location – a 
network drive, say – to 
provide an extra layer of 
redundancy for your 
Windows installation.

things along by opening it – via 
Settings > update & Security if you’re 
using Windows 10 – and performing a 
manual scan. Let all updates install 
themselves, then reboot.
Now is a good time to reinstall any 
third-party security software you have, 
then it’s time to restore your personal 
data – or link it back into Windows if 
you’ve moved it to another partition or 
drive. If you’ve backed it up previously, 
you need to open File History or 
Backup and Restore, and choose the 
Restore option. Locate your backup, 
and choose the option to restore it to 
its original location.
If you’ve partitioned your main drive 
and hived off your data folders to 
another drive, open your user folder, 
and repeat the process for pointing 
your user folders to their new locations 
(again, choose Yes when prompted to 
move any existing data – this doesn’t 
affect your data). If you run into 
permissions issues, see the ‘Fix 
Permissions’ box on page 17.
Next, go through Settings and the 
Control Panel, setting things up as you 
remember. For example, type ‘sysdm.
cpl’ into the Run dialog box to set up 
your Workgroup, rename your PC, 
switch System Restore on – Windows 
10 now disables it by default – and 
make various other system tweaks. If 
you have any Windows tweaking apps, 
such as the ultimate Windows Tweaker 
from The Windows Club (www.
thewindowsclub.com/?p=106674) – 
which, among other things, enables 
you to use Windows Photo Viewer as 
your default image viewing app – 
now’s the time to run them.
One final step if you’re running 
Windows 10: Download and run the 
portable O&O Shutup10 tool from 
www.oo-software.com/en/shutup10 to 
tighten Windows’ privacy controls.
Now might be a 
good time to take 
your first post-
Windows install 
drive image – a nice 
clean image that 
you can roll back to 
if your next round of post-setup actions 
goes awry. See the ‘Set up snapshots’ 
box on the facing page for an 
alternative to Windows’ own Backup 
and Restore tool.
Once that’s done, start reinstalling all 
your core apps, making sure you run 
them to reactivate or register any 
license keys. Once done, run CloneApp 
from your backup drive. If you click 
Restore, every single setting you’ve 
backed up is restored; if this doesn’t 
appeal, open the CloneApp\Backup 
folder, and move out any program 
folders to exclude them from the 
process. If prompted to overwrite files 
when restoring, choose Yes to replace 
new files with your backed-up versions. 
If all goes well, you should find – when 
you next open your programs – that 
they’ve got your old settings intact.
If you find you’ve forgotten to back 
up a file or program setting, what 
then? This is where your fail-safe drive 
image comes into play. Step one is to 
mount the drive image as a virtual 
drive in Windows. Type ‘diskmgmt.msc’ 
into the Run dialog, and choose Action 
> Attach VHD. Click ‘Browse’, and go to 
‘WindowsImageBackup\<Computer 
Name>\Date’ on your backup drive, 
where you’ll find several VHDX files. 
Select the largest one, and click Open 
> Ok. The partition is highlighted, so 
right-click it, and choose ‘Change Drive 
Letter and Paths’. Click ‘Add’ to allocate 
it a drive letter, and you can browse its 
contents in File Explorer, enabling you 
to copy off any files that you need.
If you need to locate and extract 
Registry settings from your old 
installation, open the Registry Editor, 
and select ‘HkEY_LOCAL_MACHINE’ 
from the list. Then choose File > Load 
Hive. You can then browse to the drive 
you’ve just mounted, and load the 
following files from the locations listed, 
depending on which Registry hive you 
need (typically HkEY_CuRRENT_uSER 
or HkEY_LOCAL MACHINE\SOFTWARE).
 HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE \SAM:  
Windows\system32\config\SAM
 HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE \SYSTEM: 
Windows\system32\config\SYSTEM
 HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE \SOFTWARE: 
Windows\system32\config\SOFTWARE
 HKEY_USERS \.Default:  
Windows\system32\config\DEFAULT
 HKEY_CURRENT_USER:  
%userprofile%\ntuser.dat
Browse these keys for missing data, 
export it to your main drive as .REg 
files, and then reimport them to 
Windows’ Registry. ■

Create a GIF 
from any video
“In this tutorial we’ll show you  
how to turn any video into a fun 
animation you can share online”
hey say a picture is worth a 
thousands words, but an 
animated GIF is worth a 
million. Despite the rise of HTML5 
video, these little animations are still 
hugely popular – partly because of 
their relatively small file size, which is 
friendly to mobile devices on limited 
data plans, and also because the 
format is so widely supported.
Sites such as Giphy (https://giphy.
com) are a great source of ready-
made animations, but sometimes you 
can only express yourself by creating 
your own – and with the right tools, 
it’s surprisingly easy to do.
If you already have a video file, skip 
straight to Step 5 to find out how to 
edit and convert it. Alternatively, you 
can grab and convert a video from 
YouTube, as explained in Step 1, or 
make a recording from your desktop, 
as described in Step 3. This is a great 
way to make a GIF from a game or 
movie playing on your PC.
1 Find a video online
If you have the copyright holder’s permission, or you 
uploaded it yourself, you can download a video from the web  
to turn into a GIF. Download and install 4K Video Downloader  
(www.4kdownload.com), then find the video you want online  
and copy its address from your web browser. Open 4K Video 
Downloader and click the green ‘Paste link’ button.
2 Save it to your PC
You’ll now be prompted to choose a quality option. Part of 
the appeal of animated GIFs is their small size, so the ‘High quality 
480p’ option is fine. Leave the format as MP4, choose a location 
for the saved file – we recommend either your desktop or your 
Videos directory – and click Download. You’ll see a green progress 
bar; once this is full, your video is ready.

3 Capture a video from your screen
If you want to make a GIF from a game or other software, 
you need free screen recorder OBS Studio. It might look 
intimidating at first, but it’s remarkably easy to use. Download it 
from https://obsproject.com/download and run the installer. You 
don’t need the plugins, so feel free to uncheck them. When it’s 
done, launch the software and skip the optimisation wizard.
4 Start and stop recording
Click the ‘+’ icon under Sources and select ‘Display capture’ 
from the drop-down menu. Click the ‘Start recording’ button on 
the right, then minimize OBS Studio and do whatever you want to 
record. When you’ve finished, maximise the recorder and click 
‘Stop recording’. The captured footage will be saved automatically 
in FLV format, and stored in your Videos directory.

9 Save your GIF
GIF format doesn’t support sound, so click Audio and select 
‘Disable audio’. Reduce the frame rate to approximately 15fps, 
click ‘Export file’, give it a name ending in the extension .gif and 
click Save. A status bar on the right will show you when it’s 
finished processing. Congratulations, you’ve turned a video into 
an animated GIF, ready to share wherever you like.
7 Keep it brief
Drag the video preview into the timeline at the bottom of 
the screen. Try to make your GIF ten seconds long or less. Drag 
the vertical white bar (the playhead) along the waveform until 
you find the point where you want your GIF to start and click ‘Split 
at playhead’. Select the section of video you want to remove and 
tap [Delete]. Now do the same for the end of the video.

Download Shotcut
Whether you’ve downloaded a video, recorded your own, or 
found one somewhere else, Shotcut is the best tool for converting 
it to GIF format. It’s totally free, doesn’t add watermarks to your 
videos, and is packed with lots of handy tools and filters to make 
your GIFs look great. Download it from www.shotcut.org and run 
the installer. When it’s done, click Close and launch the program.
10 Get the size right
Want to share your GIF on a certain site, but not sure about 
the best size? Sprout Social has a handy guide at http://bit.
ly/2AtqVL4/ that shows you the optimum image dimensions for 
all the most popular social networks, including Twitter, Facebook 
and Pinterest. It’s a very useful reference that will help ensure your 
GIFs look as good as possible when you publish them. ■
8  
Prepare to export
When you’ve trimmed your video down to a few seconds, 
click Export and select GIF as the format. Now take a look at the 
resolution. The ideal size of the GIF will depend on where you’re 
planning to use it, but a resolution of 800x600 should be fine for 
most purposes. Click the Codec tab and change the codec to GIF 
– you’ll need to scroll down a little to find it.
6 Crop your video
Click ‘Open file’ and load your chosen video. GIFs work best 
if they’re tightly cropped to focus on the most important part of 
the action. If your video needs cropping, click Filters, then click 
the ‘+’ icon to add a new filter. Click the small monitor icon to see 
video filters, then click Crop. Now use the sliders to adjust how 
much is cut off the top, bottom and sides of the video.

Find out how to perform a security audit and use simple tips and 
techniques to keep your personal data safe and secure online
lmost every other day brings 
news of another online security 
hack. The vulnerability of our 
personal data has never been more 
apparent, but there’s no reason to sit there 
feeling helpless or to retreat from the 
Internet completely. Armed with the right 
tips and techniques, you can tighten your 
online security to make it much harder for 
hackers to gain access to your online 
accounts or personal information.
In this tutorial we’re focusing on your 
Google account, but many of the steps will 
work with your other online accounts too. 
Most of us have connected to Google at 
some point, whether it’s to collect email in 
Gmail, sync web browser settings in 
Chrome, purchase books, media or apps 
on Google Play or back up data to the 
cloud using Google Drive. 
Read on to discover how to perform a 
much-needed security audit and to 
tighten protection, such as using strong 
passwords and two-step verification.
Learn how to…
Secure your Google account
A
Step-by-step How to audit and secure your Google account
1 Log into your account
After performing manual scans with your security software, 
open your web browser and head over to https://account.google.
com to log into your Google account. If you get a cookie 
mismatch error, open your browser’s privacy and security settings 
and add ‘google.com’ to the list of allowed exceptions, then try 
again. Enter your username and password to log on.
2 Perform a security audit
You’ll see your account settings are split into three sections 
– let’s start with ‘Sign-in & security’. Scroll down the page and click 
Get Started under Security Check-up. You’ll be given an instant 
security rating, with potential issues split into four categories. 
Start at the top by clicking Third-Party Access to see which apps 
and services have unverified access to your account.
3 Review and revoke
Work through the sections using the annotation as a guide. 
It’s all self-explanatory – potential security issues, such as risky 
apps are listed first, but don’t forget to check everything within 
each section (click ‘Show others’ under Third-Party Access, for 
example). Revoke access where applicable, or click ‘Don’t 
recognise an event?’ to change your password.
4 Change your password
When you’ve completed your audit, click ‘Continue to my 
account’. From the main screen, click ‘Signing into Google’. You’ll 
see your password listed along with the date it was last changed. 
Click ‘>’ to update it. Enter your existing password, then change it 
for something stronger – if you have a password manager use 
that to generate and store a strong, random password.

5  
Switch on two-step verification
Two-step verification ensures you need a verification code 
along with your account password to sign into Google. It protects 
your account in case your password is compromised, and the 
code changes regularly for additional protection. The code can be 
delivered to your mobile phone. Click ‘>’ next to 2-Step 
Verification, followed by Get Started to start the process.
6 Basic setup
Enter your password, then, if you’ve not already linked one, 
pick a phone number as well as a delivery message: text is best for 
mobile; phone call for landline. Click ‘Next’. A code will be texted 
or phoned through. Enter this and click Next followed by Turn On. 
You may have to get the message re-sent one or two times before 
it comes through – let’s choose a more convenient method.
7 Select your two-step method
The most viable alternative is Google Prompt, which pops 
up on your phone when required – all you’ll have to do is tap Yes 
to complete the sign-in process. Click ‘Add Google Prompt’ 
followed by Get Started. This involves downloading, installing and 
signing into the Google app on your smartphone. Follow the 
prompts, sign into the app and then click ‘Click here to try again’.
8  
Use an Authenticator app
If you have Google Authenticator or LastPass Authenticator 
on your phone, select the Authenticator option – which works 
when you’re offline too. Select your phone type, then open your 
app and use its camera to scan in the barcode or click ‘Can’t scan 
it’ to manually enter a 40-digit alphanumeric code. Enter the code 
generated in the app to verify the connection.

9 Use app passwords
Some apps don’t support two-step verification – for these 
to work, you’ll need to a unique app password: click ‘>’ next to 
App passwords to set these up. Also review and – if necessary 
– update your account recovery options: email, phone and 
security question. Once done, select ‘Your personal info’ followed 
by ‘About me’ to review what information is publicly available.
10 Stay secure
Congratulations, your Google account is now more secure 
than it was, particularly with two-step verification enabled. We 
recommend performing this audit every six months – consider 
changing your password at least once every 12 months too. Now 
roll this security audit out to other online accounts you have – 
including your Microsoft account, which has similar options. ■

Mirror your desktop 
on a Chromecast
“Google’s affordable media streamer is the perfect 
tool for viewing content from your PC or phone on 
an HDMI-equipped TV or monitor. Here’s how…”
oogle’s Chromecast – and its 
4K-compatible Chromecast 
Ultra sister – are inexpensive 
streaming devices that make it quick 
and easy to send (or ‘cast’) content 
from your smartphone or PC to your 
TV - or any other display equipped 
with an HDMI socket – via your 
wireless home network.
Commonly used to stream content 
such as movies, online videos and 
photos, Chromecast can also be used 
to ‘cast’ your entire PC desktop, as 
well as individual browser tabs using 
the Google Chrome web browser.
In this tutorial, we’ll explain exactly 
how to get Chromecast up and 
running; how to use Google Chrome 
to stream various kinds of media, 
your desktop, browser tabs and from 
services such as BBC iPlayer. We’ll also 
show you how to tweak your Chrome 
settings to make sure everything 
works as seamlessly as possible. Let’s 
get started, shall we?
1 Download the app
Set up Chromecast using the Google Home app on your iOS 
or Android device. Google produces plenty of apps, but the Home 
app is one of the key ones – it enables you to set up other Google 
devices as well, such as Google Home. Once you’ve installed it, tap 
‘Add a device’ to set up your Chromecast. The app will guide you 
through the entire setup process in just a few minutes.
2 Set up Chromecast
This is pretty simple and involves two main steps: plugging 
a Chromecast into an HDMI port on your TV; and then connecting 
it to your Wi-Fi network. Updates may be downloaded during this 
process. You can connect to Chromecast from any phone or PC on 
your Wi-Fi network. This is key, because if your PC and Chromecast 
are connected to different networks, none of this will work.

7 Cast a tab
To cast just a tab, right-click the current page and select 
‘Cast tab’, then select your Chromecast when it appears at the top 
of the window. If you don’t select a source manually, Chromecast 
will probably start casting the tab by default (although it doesn’t 
always). Tab casting will stop if you close the tab, or you click Stop. 
Casting tabs can be useful for showing videos, photos and more.
8 Cast from video services
If you’re on a site, such as BBC iPlayer or YouTube, in Chrome 
on your PC, you may see the Cast button – this is similar to how 
your Chromecast works with Android and iOS devices. Clicking 
the button will cast that programme or video directly to your TV. 
It can be a bit of overkill to do this for an hour-long programme, 
but for showing videos to an entire room it’s brilliant. ■
5 Enable cloud services
Your Chromecast is now up and running. The first time you 
open the Cast dialog box, you’ll see an ‘Enable casting to cloud-
based services like Google Hangouts’ option. Enable this since it 
lets you cast browser tabs directly to Google Hangouts and other 
services – it may help to avoid any issues when trying to use Cast 
with other services. Select ‘OK, Got It’ when you’re done.
3 Use Google Chrome
Once you’re done, start the Chrome web browser on your 
PC. The Cast feature is now built into Google Chrome, so you no 
longer need the Google Cast extension that was necessary with 
the original Chromecast (if you happen to remember that). 
However, you do still have to use Google Chrome rather than 
another browser, such as Mozilla Firefox or Microsoft Edge.
6 Chromecast settings
If there is more than one Chromecast or Google Home 
device connected to your home Wi-FI network, they’ll all appear 
in this list – even if you can only play audio to the device. If you 
need to rename or change settings for your Chromecast, 
right-click the Cast icon on the top-right then choose ‘Manage 
Cast devices’. Click the Settings ‘cog’ on the page.
4 Share the desktop
Click the Chrome menu button on the top right and choose 
Cast from the menu. When casting, click the arrow next to Cast to 
choose whether you want to share your browser tab or the entire 
desktop. If you want to cast your desktop, you can also choose if 
you also want to share your PC’s audio and adjust the volume. 
Remember this will send all the audio on your PC!

Create an 
ethereal image
Discover how you can make an 
eye-catching image by blurring 
the edges of a photograph”
hotographers, as a rule, like 
to take sharp images. At 
least where the subject of 
those images is concerned. Opening 
up your lens aperture, if you have 
such a control on your camera, can 
blur the background and make your 
subject stand out, but compact 
cameras and smartphones generally 
have sensors that are too small, and 
lenses that are too short, to create 
much of a depth-of-field effect.
This is where post-processing 
comes in. By using a Windows 
application, such as Paint.net, you can 
add blur to an image to create a 
feeling of otherworldliness, a 
romantic mood, or just to draw 
attention to your subject.
And it doesn’t have to be the entire 
image that’s blurred. Here, we’re 
going to show you how to use Paint.
net’s layers, selections and filters to 
selectively blur parts of an image, 
leaving the rest sharp and untouched.
1 A suitable image
Not every photo is right for the blurring treatment. This one 
of some autumn leaves already has a slightly blurred background, 
but the foreground doesn’t seem as separated from it as much as 
it could be. There’s a lot of green in the image, which can be tinted 
another colour to warm the photo before blurring. Composition is 
important too, with the more central the subject the better.
2 Select and invert
Use the Ellipse Select tool to draw an oval selection around 
the subject of your photo, in our case the autumnal tree, trying to 
keep it fairly central in the frame. Once you’re happy, go to Edit > 
Invert Selection. This will reverse your selection, so the central 
portion is now the only part not selected. This is a useful, 
time-saving trick for selecting any large area.

3 Coloured tint
Create a new layer using Layers > Add New Layer, and 
make sure it’s on the top of the stack in the palette and selected. 
Choose a colour that complements your image from the Colors 
palette. Your chosen colour will become the foreground colour. For 
the background colour, expand the Colors palette with the 
More>> button and pick ‘transparent’.
4 Gradient
With the Gradient tool selected, choose Radial from the 
options at the top, then click in the middle of the oval you made 
earlier. The edges of your image will become the foreground 
colour you selected, with no sign of the background. Bring this 
out by finding the tiny circle that appears by the side of the centre 
point of your gradient, and drag it to the edge of your canvas.

9 Even more blurs
Surface Blur is an interesting one, since it blurs away details 
while retaining the edges that make structures in your image 
recognisable. Its sliders are Radius, which determines how far the 
filter looks while averaging pixels; and Threshold, which controls 
how much detail is retained. This is another filter that will make 
your CPU fans spin up, especially when working on big files.
7 Start to blur
There are several blur filters under Effects > Blurs, and any of 
them can be useful depending on your source image and the final 
use you have in mind for your image. The first, Fragment, gives a 
particular look, and can catch you out because as much as you 
increase the Fragment Count slider, you won’t see much change 
until you raise the Distance slider, when it bursts into life.
5  
Blending
Go to Layers > Layer Properties. From here, you can set the 
layer’s blend mode, or how it interacts with the layers below it. In 
Normal and at full opacity, the layer is opaque and blocks what’s 
underneath. Change it to Screen, which lightens the colours as 
they blend, and bring the opacity down to around 100. You 
should see the layer below showing through your coloured area.
10 Still more blurs
Unfocus is similar to Gaussian Blur, but has a dreamier look. 
They both only have one slider: Radius. The final filter is Zoom 
Blur. Use this with Surface Blur to create your final look. Zoom Blur 
adds motion toward the centre of the image, and is ideal for 
guiding the eye towards the subject in a photo. Its centre point 
can be adjusted, and you can control how strong the effect is. ■
8  
More blurs
Gaussian Blur is a simple blur filter with a multitude of uses, 
and makes the selected area very soft. Motion Blur makes your 
image look as if it’s being pulled in the direction you choose; 
while Radial Blur makes it look as if your image is being twirled 
around, and can be controlled with a high degree of accuracy. 
They’re both processor intensive, especially on large image files.

This step is optional. Select the lower layer in the stack, and 
keep the selection in place. Select Effects > Photo > Glow. Mess 
with the sliders until you have a result you’re pleased with. Here, it 
brightens the background even more than it already had been by 
the blending mode change, and this suits our source image. There 
isn’t another filter like Glow in Paint.net.

Play music 
with Winyl
“Manage and enjoy music on any 
PC with this lightweight digital 
music and streaming radio player”
inyl will appeal if you’re 
looking for a no-nonsense, 
lightweight music player for 
your digital music library. The app 
consumes around 22MB of memory 
in use – compare that to Windows 
Media Player (around 50MB) or 
Groove Music (over 100MB) – making 
it suitable for older and slower 
machines, such as 2-in-1 tablets. 
Despite this, Winyl still boasts handy 
features and a slick user interface to 
help you enjoy your music.
In this tutorial we’ll show you how 
to create your music library, plus 
change metadata (and artwork) using 
Winyl’s handy tag-editing tools. You’ll 
also learn how to customise the 
program and make use of its playlists 
and smartlists too. Finally, if you’re fed 
up with your own music, just select 
Radios from the Library pane to 
access hundreds of streaming radio 
stations spanning many genres and 
tastes. Let’s rock!
1 Download and set up
Go to vinylsoft.com and click Downloads. You can download 
a regular version of Winyl to install (use the direct link), or a 
portable version in ZIP format, the contents of which you extract 
to your portable tools folder or USB drive. Once done, open Winyl 
from its Start menu shortcut or – if you’ve extracted the portable 
version – by double-clicking Winyl.exe inside the Winyl folder.
2 Set up libraries
You’ll be prompted to point the program towards your 
music folder (or folders). Click ‘Add’ to manually browse for – and 
select – the parent folder containing your music. If your music is 
scattered across multiple locations on your PC, click Add as many 
times as you need to select additional folders. When you’re done, 
click Update and wait for Winyl to scan through your music files.

3 Review library
Once the progress bar disappears, your screen will remain 
blank. Don’t panic – expand the Artists link on the left and you 
should see all your music organised by artist. Select one and you 
should see a list of tracks organised into albums appear. You can 
also navigate by folder or genre – assuming music has been 
tagged as such – using the links on the left side of the window.
4 Listen to your music
Select a track or album, then click the Play button at the 
bottom of the window to start listening to it. Playback controls 
include skip back and forward, shuffle, repeat and volume 
adjustment. Press [F6] to open the Equalizer window to alter the 
sound using a 10-bar graphic equaliser with preamp and support 
for over 20 presets, from Rock and Pop to Bass Reducer.

9 Use Smartlists
Smartlists are playlists automatically generated using rules 
or filters rather than manually selected tracks. The annotation 
reveals how to create your own, but a number of examples are 
included, from ‘50 Random tracks’ to ’25 Most Played’ and ‘90’s 
Music’. Select one and the selected tracks will appear in the main 
window. Don’t like the random choice? Click again to change it.
7 Create a playlist
Create your own mix compilation by adding favourite tracks 
or albums to playlists. Select each track or tracks (use [Ctrl]-click or 
click an album header), then right-click and choose ‘Add to 
Playlist’ > To New Playlist to create a new playlist, named Playlist 
DD/MM/YYYY. Add additional tracks in the same way, this time 
choosing the Playlist name under ‘Add to Playlist’.
5  
Edit library information
You can fix incorrect matches or add extra information to 
both entire albums and individual tracks. To update a single track, 
right-click it and choose Properties, or click on an album title to 
select all the tracks, then right-click and choose Properties. Use 
the Tags tab to change the track or album’s metadata – here we’re 
adding the Album Artists tag to file the album correctly.
10 Customise Winyl
Press [F4] to change the look of Winyl; a choice of six light or 
dark skins are available. Open the Settings sub-menu to disable 
visual effects and smooth scrolling to improve performance on 
low-end machines, or select Settings > Advanced for more 
customisation options, such as choosing what items appear in the 
Library pane as well as the transparency of the mini player. ■
8  
Manage playlists
Manage your playlist from the left-hand pane under 
Playlists. Start by right-clicking its name and choosing Rename to 
change it, or Delete to remove it. Select the playlist to view its 
contents and running order in the main pane. Click and drag a 
track to change its position in the running order, or right-click the 
track and choose Delete to remove it from the playlist.
6 Add album art
Switch to the Cover Art tab to review the current album art. 
Drag a photo from a folder or the Firefox web browser to the ‘Drag 
picture here’ window to change it, or click Google to search for 
artwork based on the artist and album title – although this 
doesn’t work in the portable version.  You can choose to embed 
the artwork into the music file itself, or save it as a separate file.

Nobody should know what you’re doing online except you. Make sure 
that your connection stays private with the brilliant IPVanish VPN
here’s a lot going on online, and 
not all of it good. Sometimes the 
connections we use to connect to 
the Internet are not entirely secure – who’s 
listening in to that Wi-Fi network in the 
coffee shop down the road? Sometimes 
we’re denied access to services we could 
enjoy if we simply lived somewhere else in 
the world. And sometimes the websites we 
visit – or even our Internet Service 
Providers (ISPs), or the government – log 
all sorts of information about us and our 
activities online.
A Virtual Private Network, or VPN, is the 
solution to each of these problems. It sits 
between your web browser and your 
Internet connection – whether you’re 
using public Wi-Fi or connecting at home 
or work – and encrypts everything you 
send and receive, only unlocking it once 
it’s been sent to a completely different 
geographical location. Your Internet 
address changes, and nobody can see 
what you’re doing.
Learn how to…
Protect your privacy online
T
Step-by-step Hide your traffic with IPVanish
1 Get started
Open your web browser and head to www.ipvanish.com, 
then click the Start Now button. Note that IPVanish isn’t free; a 
VPN is a relatively demanding service, and the company charges a 
monthly fee for use of its facilities with a seven-day money-back 
guarantee. There are free VPNs, but IPVanish is our top pick – and 
who knows what the free ones are doing with your information?
2 Sign up
Select your payment option (bear in mind that anything 
other than the monthly payment is billed in one chunk) and 
create your account – in the spirit of anonymity, all you need is an 
email address and a password. You can even pay anonymously, 
although this means owning Bitcoin. Here’s a tip: loiter on the site 
for a while, and you’ll be offered a discount on your first billing.
3 Verify and install
You’ll be sent an email to the address you supplied. Click the 
link within, head to the ‘My account’ link at the top of the site to 
log in with the details you used in the previous step, then click the 
Apps link. Click ‘Download now’, followed by Download Windows 
App, then run the file you downloaded. Simply click through the 
installer to get it installed, then Run IPVanish when it’s complete.
4 First steps
Sign into the app with your username (your email address) 
and the password you set earlier. You’ll be taken first to the Quick 
Connect screen; click the big green Connect button for the first 
time and IPVanish will ask to install a TAP device – this isn’t 
sinister. Confirm it’s OK to do this, and click the relevant prompts 
when they pop up. You’ll be prompted again when it’s complete.

5  
Finally online
Click ‘Connect’ again, and IPVanish will hook you up to a 
random server in the USA. You’ll see the location information at 
the top left of the window change as it does so, and the graph in 
the centre will start moving to show that traffic is flowing through 
the VPN. Open your web browser and head to www.whatismyip.
com. The information shown there should match your new locale.
6 Moving around
Click the red Disconnect button and you’ll go back to 
broadcasting your location, with your traffic back out in the open. 
Now’s a good time to try one of IPVanish’s other servers. Click 
‘Server List’ in the left-hand menu to see the map; drag it around 
with the left mouse button, and zoom with the mousewheel. Click 
one of the green locations to move your connection there.
7 Find the fastest
If you want the speediest connection, selecting the server 
with the lightest load is key. You can connect to specific servers 
using the drop-down boxes above the Connect button on the 
Quick Connect screen, but head to the My Account section of the 
IPVanish website and click the Server List button to see current 
loads. Click the top of the status column to find the lightest ones.
8  
Lowest latency
You can also find servers by their latency. A low-load server 
won’t be much good if it’s half the world away and behind a 
clogged connection. Head to the server list within the IPVanish 
app, and click the Filter tab. Use the lower drop-down box on the 
left, and select 50-100ms to see servers which offer a reasonably 
fast response – double-click a likely looking one to connect to it.
Where am I?

9 Automate it
If you’re paranoid, you may want to set IPVanish to work on 
your connection the moment you boot up your PC. Just go to the 
Settings screen and check the box at the top of the General tab. 
You may also wish to set it to automatically connect to your last 
server or a country of your choosing using the radio buttons 
below. Using a VPN isn’t a great choice if you need top speed.
10 Auto switching
If encrypting your internet connection and sending it across 
the world isn’t quite enough for you, you can harden IPVanish 
further in the IP Settings tab. Check the top-most box, and specify 
a time: IPVanish will now automatically change your address for a 
new one periodically. Be warned that you’ll experience a blip in 
your internet connection when it does so, but it won’t last long. ■

Use your PC with a set of 
Bluetooth headphones
“Enjoy music, movies and games in Windows using a 
pair of wireless headphones – and discover some 
quick and easy fixes if they don’t work as planned”
e all connect headphones or 
speakers to our computers. 
Thanks to Bluetooth, this is 
increasingly something you can do 
wirelessly. Bluetooth audio devices 
aren’t new, of course, but they are 
now ubiquitous in a way they weren’t 
before. Many headphones now use 
Bluetooth – even at the more budget 
end of the market – while we’re used 
to connecting wirelessly between our 
mobile devices and wireless 
headphones, too – sometimes 
because more mobile devices are 
eschewing traditional headphone 
jacks. That isn’t an issue on laptops 
and desktops yet, so it’s simply that 
it’s more convenient to go wire-free, 
not to mention that it also gives you 
the versatility to move around and 
not be tethered to your PC 
continually. So let’s show you how 
easy it is to connect up Bluetooth 
headphones to your PC – and what to 
do if it doesn’t completely work out.
1 Check that Bluetooth is active
The first thing to do is to switch on Bluetooth on your PC. 
Go to the Action Centre by clicking on the icon on the far 
right-hand side of the Taskbar next to the clock. Then click the 
Bluetooth icon. If it’s already highlighted (as some of the other 
tiles are here) then it’s already on. On some PCs switching on Wi-Fi 
will also switch on Bluetooth, and it’s also often on by default. 
2 Use Bluetooth’s settings
You can enter the Bluetooth settings window in one of two 
ways – either via the Settings app or by right-clicking the 
Bluetooth button in the Action Centre. You can also search for 
Bluetooth Settings direct from the Taskbar, press [Win] and type 
‘Bluetooth’. Note the Connect option in Action Centre, as you’ll 
need that later to reconnect to your Bluetooth device.

7 Reconnect your headphones
Your headphones will only automatically reconnect if 
Bluetooth remains active on your PC. If you have to manually 
reconnect your headphones, you can also go to the Connect 
menu in the Action Centre to reconnect to the device – with 
Bluetooth and the headphones turned on, just select the device 
from the menu. Not all devices that appear will be active.
8 Troubleshoot your connection
Your Bluetooth headphones and PC should connect when 
the two devices are in range of each other and with Bluetooth 
active, but if they don’t and unpairing and re-pairing doesn’t 
work, press [Win] and type ‘Troubleshoot’ to open the Settings > 
‘Update & security’ menu, then select Bluetooth under ‘Find and 
fix other problems’, then click ‘Run the troubleshooter’ for a fix. ■
5 Pairing tips and tricks
Click the Pair button. If there is a problem, turn Bluetooth 
off on your PC, then on again before restarting your headphones. 
If you leave it too long, your headphones might come out of 
pairing, so do check that. Once you’ve clicked Pair, your PC will 
add the Bluetooth headphones to your system – in other words, it 
will install the driver software. This may take a few minutes.
3 Manage Bluetooth devices
The Bluetooth settings are contained within the Devices 
sub-menu of the Settings app. There are a lot of devices here, but 
you may have some or none depending on what’s been paired 
with your PC. There’s also a switch at the top of the list to toggle 
Bluetooth on and off. Note: Bluetooth sends out wireless signals, 
it will switch off if you put your PC in Airplane Mode. 
6 Removing your headphones
Once your headphones have been installed by Windows 
you’ll see them appear in the list as Connected. When you 
highlight the headphones in Bluetooth’s settings, you’ll also see a 
button called ‘Remove device’. You might need this if you need to 
re-pair, although this isn’t a usual occurrence. Now that the device 
is paired, it should automatically connect to your PC from now on. 
4 Pair your headphones
Switch your Bluetooth headphones on and make sure 
they’re in pairing mode. Usually this involves holding down the 
power button for longer when you switch them on, but this does 
vary depending on model – check the user manual to be sure. 
When they’re in pairing mode, you’ll see them pop up in this list 
of Bluetooth devices with ‘Ready to pair’ next their name.

Make an emergency 
toolkit on a USB stick
“Put together all the essential  
apps you’ll need to deal with  
potential PC disasters”
iruses, malware, accidental 
deletion or corrupted data 
can all put your valuable files 
at risk. The best insurance is to make 
regular backups, but what if you run 
into trouble in between backups, or 
you let your routine slide, or a friend 
has a crisis with their PC? That’s 
where an emergency USB toolkit of 
portable apps comes in, giving you 
everything you need to fix the 
damage and save the day.
When you install a program, not 
only are the files it needs to run saved 
on your startup drive, it also makes its 
own changes to the rest of your 
system – such as adding entries to 
the Windows registry. Portable apps 
don’t do this, meaning you can save 
them to a USB flash drive and use 
them on any PC by double-clicking 
the program’s EXE file. We’ve put 
together a collection of the best 
ones for use in emergencies.
1 Prepare your USB stick
First, you’ll need a USB flash drive – 1GB will be fine. Plug it 
into your PC and open File Explorer, then right-click it in the menu 
on the left, select Rename and name it ‘Emergency’. If you’ve used 
the flash drive before, you can wipe it by right-clicking it and 
selecting Format > ‘Restore device defaults’ > OK. Make sure there 
isn’t anything you want to keep on the USB flash drive first.
2 Prepare for accidents
Now to build your toolkit. A common disaster is accidentally 
deleting a file – from your hard drive, an SD card or other storage. 
Piriform Recuva can help you get it back, but installing this after 
you’ve lost files can result in them being overwritten. It’s far better 
to have it ready to run from your USB stick. Download it from 
www.piriform.com/recuva – using ‘Manual download’ is easiest.
Your guide Cat Ellis says…

Cat’s best tip!
You might have extra room 
on your USb flash drive once

7 Get set to blast malware
Emsisoft Emergency Kit, from www.emsisoft.com/en/
software/eek/, will check your PC for programs that aren’t strictly 
viruses but are still malicious. Double-click the downloaded file 
and it will run an installer, which automates the process of 
extracting the files from a ZIP archive. Select your USB flash drive 
as the destination, make a folder called ‘Emsisoft’ and click OK.
8 Ready for anything
Double-click Start Emergency Kit Scanner and let Emsisoft 
update itself. Now, whenever you think your PC has a malware 
infection (you notice unexpected changes to your web browser, 
for example), insert your USB flash drive, launch Emsisoft, click 
Scan and follow the instructions. Label the USB flash drive and 
keep it handy – you never know when you’ll need it. ■
5 Get ready for a deep clean
If your PC is running slow, or you’re getting error messages 
about corrupted files, CCleaner can save the day. Download it 
from www.piriform.com/ccleaner/builds (it’s the second link), 
then extract the downloaded file to your USB flash drive just as 
you did for Recuva, saving it in a new folder called ‘CCleaner’. To 
run it, double-click the file CCleaner.exe.
3 Recover deleted files
Click the downloaded ZIP file in your browser, and select 
Extract > ‘Extract all’. Click ‘Browse’ and select your USB flash drive. 
Right-click and create a folder called ‘Recuva’ (to make it easier to 
find in future). Open this folder and click ‘Select folder’ > Extract. 
Now if you need to restore a deleted file, just plug in your USB 
flash drive, double-click Recuva.exe and follow the instructions.
6 Sweep away junk and fix errors
To free up extra space and improve performance, click 
Analyze and CCleaner will search your hard drive for unnecessary 
files. Once it’s finished, look through the list, uncheck the boxes 
next to anything you want to keep, then click Run Cleaner. To 
solve errors with the Windows registry, select Registry from the 
menu on the left and select ‘Scan for issues’ > ‘Fix selected issues’.
4 Download a virus-zapper
If you suspect your PC has a virus, McAfee Labs Stinger can 
help stop it in its tracks. Download it from www.mcafee.com/uk/
downloads/free-tools/stinger.aspx. This program doesn’t come in 
a ZIP archive, so once it’s downloaded you can drag the EXE file 
straight to your USB flash drive using File Explorer. When you 
want to run it, just double-click the file and click Scan.

Improve password 
security with LastPass
“Managing multiple website logins and using 
hacker-proof passwords needn’t be a chore. LastPass 
makes bulletproof personal security an easy task”
ecurity experts often offer 
words of wisdom, such as: 
“Use a different password for 
every site" or “Make sure you don’t 
use any dictionary words". But then 
they’ll say contradictory things like: 
“a string of dictionary words is more 
secure than a random jumble of 
characters”. Those security experts 
don’t want us to have an easy life, 
that much is clear. 
Seriously, though, your online 
security is important. Share 
passwords between sites and, if one 
of them happens to lose its password 
database to a hacker, your security 
across all those sites is compromised. 
Remembering a host of long-winded 
passwords is difficult, though; do you 
write them all down in a book? If 
someone gets hold of that book, 
what then? It’s much better to use 
a secure service, itself password 
protected, to manage the whole 
thing for you…
1 Getting hold of it
Although you can use LastPass entirely online, it’s more 
effective to use its browser extension on your PC to manage 
logging into sites. You never actually have to remember the 
passwords you’ve set. Head to lastpass.com/download, and 
download the Universal Windows Installer, which will add the 
LastPass extension to your browsers.
2 Installing it
If Windows asks whether you want the app to make 
changes to your PC, click Yes. Click ‘Install LastPass’, then ‘Create a 
New Account’. You now need to set your master password, which 
is the only password you’ll have to remember. Make it a good one, 
and one you’ve never used anywhere else; try to make the green 
bar fill up to ensure it’s strong enough. Click ‘Create Account’.

7 In the vault
LastPass’ vault is where it stores your passwords, should 
you ever need to use them to log in on a device that doesn’t have 
LastPass installed. Either click the My Vault option in the LastPass 
extension, or head to lastpass.com and log in with your details to 
see it. Find the login for which you need the password, click the 
spanner icon, then click the eye icon to reveal all.
8 More secrets
The vault isn’t just a place to keep passwords. You can 
use its encrypted space to store anything you’d like to keep 
secret (but might need quick access to), such as Wi-Fi passwords, 
passport info or bank details, though we’d still use caution with 
the latter. Click the notepad icon, click Add Secure Note, and fill 
in the form; you can attach photos and documents if required. ■
5 Making memories
The login text-boxes will look slightly different from usual, 
with the LastPass logo on the right. Input your username and 
password as usual, and LastPass will pop up a green bar offering 
to remember your details. Click ‘Save Site’, and confirm the details 
on the next page. Now log back out of the site and come back; 
you’ll find that LastPass has filled in your details automatically.
3 Begin the lockdown
LastPass sniffs through your web browsers and attempts 
to detect insecurely stored passwords at this point. Click ‘Import’ 
and it’ll bring them into its secure vault and delete the insecure 
references to them. LastPass will now open up any browsers into 
which it couldn’t automatically install itself – you’ll need to follow 
the instructions on each to get its browser extension ensconced.
6 Character soup
Let’s create a new password. Head to your chosen site’s 
account settings page and find the password change portion. Fill 
in the details the site asks for until it asks for your new password. 
Click the LastPass icon, then Generate Secure Password, and use 
the controls to create a suitably complex jumble of characters. 
Copy and paste it into the password box, and confirm the change.
4 Finding it
You’ll now find LastPass – in whichever web browser you 
prefer – as a grey icon to the right of the address bar. Left-click 
it and enter the details from Step 2 to log in; we’d suggest not 
allowing it to remember your master password, since this adds an 
extra layer of security. Now head over to a site that requires you to 
enter a username and password – we’re using outlook.com.

Download YouTube 
videos for free
“Save videos from YouTube to watch offline  
at a time that is convenient for you!”
here are many reasons 
why you would want to 
download YouTube 
videos, as anybody who’s going to 
be in a poor coverage area, who 
has a capped mobile broadband 
data plan or who won’t be able to 
stream high-quality video will 
appreciate the ability to download 
YouTube videos for offline use. It’s 
also handy if you suspect that the 
video is about to disappear for 
sinister reasons too…
Downloading videos from 
YouTube couldn’t be simpler, 
although the methods you 
employ will depend on the device 
that you are using.
Your guide Gary Marshall says…
T
In this guide we’ll show you how 
to download YouTube videos for 
free, as well as looking into the 
ethics and legality of downloading 
YouTube videos. 
It's against YouTube's terms and conditions, which say 
you can only use its content for streaming, and you 
could argue that it's unethical too – many artists  
depend on YouTube's adverts for their income, so any 
ad-free playback you do is depriving them of money.  
We suspect the legality of this is similar to ad-blocking: 
content owners would rather you didn't do it and try 
their best to stop the tools from working, but there's not 
a lot they can do to prevent you watching videos ad-free 
if your listening comes under ‘fair use’ in copyright 
terms. Then again we're not lawyers, so proceed with 
this at your own risk.

Check to see if the video 
you want has been made  
available for offline viewing.

Download to your 
Android phone
YouTube added offline viewing 
to its Android app back in late 
2014, but the feature is limited 
to YouTube Red subscribers. If 
a video is available for offline 
viewing (not all videos are, and it's 
up to the video owner to decide 
whether offline viewing should be 
available for each clip) you'll see 
an icon showing a down arrow. 
Tapping on that will download the 
clip for offline viewing.
However, this isn't the most 
flexible of ways to download 
YouTube videos to your Android 
device, but at least it's officially 
supported. If you want a bit  
more freedom to download 
YouTube videos on Android,  
then you should look at using  
a third-party app.
There are a number of free 
apps to help you download 
YouTube videos, and one of the 
best ones is TubeMate. This app 
isn't available on the Google Play 
Store, so first of all you'll need to 
allow your Android device to 
install and run apps downloaded 
from other places. Be cautious 
when you turn on this setting, as 
you'll want to make sure you only 
downloaded apps that you know 
are safe and reliable.
Open up Settings and go 
to Security. Scroll down and 
next to where it says 'Unknown 
sources', tap the toggle to turn 
this setting on. Now on your 
Android device browse to the 
TubeMate YouTube Downloader 
website and tap Download. You 
may see a warning message pop 
up about downloading .apk files, 
so click OK to allow it. Once 
downloaded, run the file and then 
tap to install it.
With the app installed, open 
it up and watch videos as you 
would in the normal YouTube 
app. If you see a video you want 
to save for later, load it up, then 
tap on the green arrow icon at 
the top of the screen. You'll be 
given a range of video formats 
and resolutions to download 
the file as. Select the one you 
want and it will then download 
the YouTube video to your 
Android device.
Download to your PC
It's important to note that 
under YouTube's terms and 
conditions, downloading 
other people's YouTube videos 
is prohibited. If you've submitted 
your own video, you can 
download it by logging into 
YouTube, going to your channel's 
“Downloading videos couldn’t be 
simpler, although the methods 
you use depend on the device”
If you're downloading using the YouTube app for 
Android, you'll download an MP4 video file – although it 
appears to only play back in Google's own YouTube app. 
With video-converter services, you'll usually get a choice 
of file formats. The most common of these are MP4, 3GP, 
AVI, and MOV; the choice of format and quality settings 
will affect what you can watch your video on, and how 
good the video will be.
If you're not too fussed about video quality, 3GP is the 
file format for you. It's perfect for small-screened mobile 
phones and awful on anything else, but the files are tiny 
– which matters on old mobiles, since they don't usually 
have very much on-board storage or any memory 
expansion capabilities.
For other devices, MOV is Apple's video format 
and works on every Mac, AVI was developed by 
Microsoft and works happily on PCs, and MP4 is the 
video equivalent of MP3 and works on pretty much 
everything. For maximum compatibility we'd suggest 
that you stick with MP4.

example because YouTube has 
decided you've downloaded too 
many of your own videos (the 
limit is two videos an hour) or 
because the clip contains an audio

then you'll need to turn to a

Download YouTube to 
your PC with an app
There are lots of YouTube video 
downloader websites and apps, 
but many of them can be less 
than reputable: expect 
unwanted software installation, 
misleading download links, 
terrifying terms and conditions 
and masses of other dense 
information to sift through. 
We've come to trust ClipConverter.
cc, www.clipconverter.cc/ though, 
since it doesn't do any of those 
things. However, if you stumble 
across a better alternative, please 
do let us know!
Using ClipConverter couldn't 
be simpler. Point your browser  
to its website, paste the URL of  
the YouTube video you want to 
convert, choose the file format 
you want and edit the options  
(if you want to – the defaults  
work well too).
The web app will then give you 
a choice of sources at different 
quality, ranging from tiny 3GP 
mobile files to huge 4K Ultra HD 
files, and once you've chosen your 
options clicking on Start will fly 
through the conversion process 
and present you with a download 
link on completion.
You don't have to capture entire 
videos, either – if you only want to 
download a chunk, for example 
because you're using it for 
criticism or review, you can 
specify the start time and end 
time for the file conversion. n 
The next decision you’ll need to make is the video 
quality. If you’re downloading via a service such as 
ClipConverter, you’ll be given a choice of video sources. 
That’s because YouTube streams in multiple qualities 
ranging from 3GP for old mobiles to 4K Ultra HD for 
large Ultra HD displays.
3GP aside, you have five options here for your 
computer, smartphone or tablet: 360p, 480p, 720p,  
1080p and 4K (if available). The higher the quality the 
bigger the file, so the trick is to balance quality and size: 
unless you’re watching on a really big screen, you can 
probably manage without 4K or even 1080p quality 
unless you’ve got oodles of spare storage – although 
watching 360p video on a typical HDTV or HD tablet 
display is likely to be a fairly blocky experience.
Unless you have unlimited storage capacity, the 
trade-off usually means finding the lowest video  
quality that you can tolerate on the display you’ll be 
watching the video on.
If the video you’re downloading has music, it 
doesn’t matter what video quality you choose – the 
soundtrack has the same bit-rate whether you go for  
a 480p video or a 4K one. That’s because YouTube’s 
audio and video streams are two separate things,  
so adjusting the video quality doesn’t make any 
difference to the quality of the soundtrack.

The blockchain and the Internet have 
spawned cryptocurrency, and it’s here to stay
n January 3, 2009, a programmer (or 
programmers) working under the pseudonym 
Satoshi Nakamoto launched something 
remarkable: a new form of money, a digital 
cryptocurrency called Bitcoin. The idea was 
that Bitcoin would be completely independent 
of outside forces – no banks, no governments. It would be a 
distributed method of wealth that required no trusted third 
party to verify transfers or hold money. Supply was limited, to 
combat inflation. A simple idea done with clever maths.
Cryptocurrencies run on a peer-to-peer system. Transactions 
take place between two parties without intermediaries, 
verified by horribly involved calculations. This maths is based 
on public-key cryptography; put very simply, each transaction 
is verified by the completion of a series of cryptographic 
puzzles, and added to the blockchain. The blockchain is the 
ledger, which is distributed and checked by the network. To 
reward those who do the hard work of maintaining the ledger, 
they are paid in coins – as you ‘mine’, you run the network. 
The maths may be complex, and the concept big, but in use, 
it’s fairly easy. Create a wallet with public and private 
cryptographic keys, and you can buy and transfer coins. At first 
glance, there’s one clear problem: no collateral at all. Bitcoin is 
built on sand and trust, yet it works…

Bitcoin explained

Top crypTocurrencies you cAn mine
Bitcoin was the first 
and is by far the largest 
cryptocurrency, with a 
market capitalisation of 
$133-odd billion. 
However, it has 
spawned many more, 
and these are the 
current biggest 
alternatives. Values 
here are, as ever, 
volatile as anything.
EThereum
Launched in 2015 and 
subject to huge recent 
growth, Ethereum is 
currently worth about 
$34 billion (£25 billion). It 
uses a scripting language, 
which can be executed 
over the network, making 
it an ideal platform for 
other applications. 
BiTcoin cAsh
Split from Bitcoin earlier 
this year, Bitcoin Cash’s 
coins are currently wortth 
around 15 percent of the 
value of the originals, or 
$20 billion (£15 billion) as 
a whole. Bitcoin Cash 
(BCH) uses a larger block 
size to increase the speed 
of any transactions.
LITECOIN
Worth over $3.8 billion 
(£2.8 billion), Litecoin is 
technically very similar to 
Bitcoin, although 
tweaked to be faster – 
transactions are currently 
about four times quicker. 
It was launched in 2011, 
which makes it one of the 
original cryptocurrencies. 
DAsh
Worth about $3.4 billion 
(around £2.5 billion), 
Dash is similar to Bitcoin, 
but uses a two-tier 
structure of miners and 
masternodes. Self-
funding and self-
governing, it operates a 
decentralised business 
model known as a DAo.
nthusiastic early adopters 
got the Bitcoin gears 
turning, but the initial 
value of the coins was 
negligible and negotiable, 
and they were traded between friends. 
The first cited proper purchase took 
place in May 2010, for two pizzas, at a 
cost of 10,000 coins. 
In July 2010, a Bitcoin was worth 
eight cents. By early 2011, it achieved 
parity with the dollar. Early this year, it 
reached parity with gold. Since then, it 
has gone well beyond that. As we type 
this, a Bitcoin is worth £5,939. Those 
pizzas cost the equivalent of over £59 
million today. Bitcoin maybe valuable, 
but it’s also volatile – at the time of 
writing, it had jumped to a high of 
£6,002 and fallen to a low of £3,935 all 
within the past month. There have 
certainly been some spectacular 
slumps along the way, the value 
halving or worse a number of times. 
Money is trust, and to be worth 
anything, it must be transferable to 
goods or other currencies. At first, you 
would have to talk a merchant into 
accepting it; now, Bitcoin has reached a 
turning point, depending on where you 
are in the world. It is not fully 
integrated with the banking system, or 
even legal tender, yet it can be spent.
The United States Department of the 
Treasury classifies cryptocurrencies as 
virtual currencies, and therefore not 
under its remit; however, their 
generation counts as money 
transmitters. Last year, a US federal 
judge ruled that Bitcoins are “funds 
within the plain meaning of the term”. 
So, it is money. In China, individuals can 
trade in Bitcoins, but the banks cannot. 
Elsewhere in the world, it ranges 
from being completely illegal to being 
widely accepted as money. Generally, it 
is treated as ‘private money’, not legal 
tender, but is still wealth, and subject 
to the same taxation. One acid test for 
money is whether you can pay your 
taxes with it. That next step has been 
taken. From April this year, Japan 
started counting Bitcoin as legal tender. 
Russia, Germany, and others reportedly 
have plans for similar steps. Bitcoin is 
on the verge of going fully legit. Full 
government approval inevitably leads 
to regulations at some point, or 
attempts, anyway. 
financial stability
Until legislation fully catches up with 
cryptocurrencies, you are operating 
largely outside the traditional financial 
framework, and therefore the legal 
protection of the central banks and 
governments, including in the UK. You 
are pretty much on your own if things 
go wrong. Don’t panic, though; Bitcoin 
has amassed enough adherents to be 
respectably stable.  
Another acid test for money is 
whether you can swap it for other 
money, preferably the folding kind. To 
do this, you need to go to a Bitcoin 
exchange. There are some 64 of these 
worldwide, and levels of security, 
privacy, and control vary. Over the 
years, a number have had their security 
breached, gone bankrupt, or, in at least 
one case, simply disappeared with all 
the funds. This is where that democratic 
and distributed – and hence loosely 
regulated – aspect of cryptocurrencies 
can look worryingly fragile. Some 
research is recommended before you 
start making large transactions. Scary? 
A little, but the cowboys are rapidly 
being weeded out.
The days of these unregulated 
exchanges may well be numbered, 
anyway. Becoming legal tender opens 
the way for the traditional financial 
institutions to start trading in Bitcoin. 
Increasingly, it is becoming yet another 
cog in the wheels of international 
business. This summer, the Swiss bank 
Falcon added Bitcoins to its accounts – 
customers can now buy and hold them 
in their own accounts. At the end of 
August, this was expanded to Ether, 
Litecoin, and Bitcoin Cash, too. Amazon, 
Apple, and Google are all working on 
integrating Bitcoin services. 
Widespread adoption is coming quickly.
Meanwhile, there are more than a 
few technical problems to deal with. 
The increasingly technical complexity 
of transactions has begun to drag. 
Currently, a Bitcoin transaction takes 
about 20 minutes to process; 
occasionally, an hour or more. On 
smaller deals, merchants often ignore 
this, and take the payment on trust – if 
you are buying a fancy new watch, 
you’ll probably have to wait.
This, along with the attendant 
meagre results when mining, has 
helped spark a bit of a civil war in the 
Bitcoin camp, which led to it being split

EThereum clAssic
This was born out of a 
fork of Ethereum after 
the DAo ethereum 
spin-off project had $50 
(£37) of its Ether tokens 
stolen. Ethererum Classic 
is the original Ethereum 
blockchain, and is 
currently worth around 
$1.7 billion (£1.26 billion).
BITCONNECT
Launched in February 
2016, BitConnect has 
seen huge growth since, 
with coins jumping 1,800 
percent in six months, 
and currently worth 
$624m (£461 million) in 
total. BitConnect includes 
the facility to earn 
interest on lent coins.
mONErO
Based on different 
technology to Bitcoin 
and a fork of Bytecoin, 
monero experienced 
huge growth thanks in 
part to its use on the 
darknet market AlphaBay 
(now defunct). Currently 
worth about $2 billion 
(£1.5 billion).
ZcAsh
Under a year old and 
already worth $792 
million (£585 million), 
Zcash’s blockchain can 
hide the amounts and 
recipients, or make 
selective disclosures to 
third parties – making it 
handy for complying with 
money-laundering and 
tax regulations.
ByTECOIN
Not to be confused with 
Bitcoin (BTE versus BCN). 
The first currency based 
on the CryptoNote 
protocol, which is behind

for a cryptocurrency, it’s 
been around since 2012, 
and is current valued at 
$234 million (around 
£173 million).
in two. A clone of Bitcoin was created 
– Bitcoin Cash – which altered the 
maths to allow for much faster 
transitions. Unfortunately a software 
upgrade, called SegWit2x, which was 
due in November and aimed at 
speeding up Bitcoin transactions was 
cancelled at the last minute – making 
the value of Bitcoin even more volatile. 
Interestingly, the upgrade was also 
causing conniptions, leading to a talk 
over a second split or ‘hard fork’. 
The decentralised nature of Bitcoin 
was designed to ensure no single 
failure would have much impact, and 
no single player could dictate terms. 
That has been eroded considerably 
now; huge swathes of the network run 
in large data centres. Salcido 
Enterprises is building a data centre in 
North Washington, USA that will 
consume 7.5MW of hydro-electric 
power. Going further up the scale, in 
Xinjiang province in China, a major 
player called Bitmain is building a data 
centre that will consume up to 135MW 
of power, and Bitcoin mining will be its 
main job. Bitcoin has come a long way 
from its hobbyist roots.
Bitcoin has an intrinsic limit of 21 
million coins, which is expected to be 
more or less reached by around 2040, 
although it’ll take a lot longer to mine 
the very last block. What happens then 
could be awkward. By this point, the 
complexity of the blockchain will be 
considerable, and there will be no new 
coins to pay for running things. It’s 
inevitable then that transaction fees 
will have to be levied at some point.
As a cryptocurrency ‘matures’, it 
increasingly falls under the control of 
those with the computing power to run 
it. Control over the supposed 
democratic and distributed currency 
gathers around the big data centres 
and the exchanges. It’s an old story: 
The ‘kids’ come along with something 
cool, and the ‘suits’ take it away, 
commercialise it, and sell it back. Man. 
However, digital money’s full 
integration into more mainstream 
financial markets is hampered by its 
very nature. The markets like 
centralised exchanges and institutions, 
and don’t like volatile currencies. 
Volatile value
Rapid changes in value are not too 
much of an issue when ordering 
pizza, but a corporation making a 
big international payment won’t like 
to see percentage swings in value of 
the currency used over the minutes 
or hours it takes to verify a payment, 
which could end up being millions of 
dollars either way.
The central concept of the 
blockchain is proven, though. A 
number of currencies have been 
created that cannot be mined, but 
concentrate on the business of 
transfers. They launch with a fixed 
number of tokens. The biggest of these 
is Ripple, currently worth over $9.1 
billion (£6.7 billion). The aim is similar 
to Bitcoin: seamless and easy transfers 
of any currency to anywhere else, with 
no third-party fees or involvement. It 
positions itself as a complement to, not 
a rival of, Bitcoin. Transactions go 
through in seconds, which alleviates 
the problem of the currency’s value 
This is why your PC can’t mine 
 Bitcoin effectively anymore. This mining 
farm in Iceland is your competition.

Bitcoin explained

The BlockchAin
It’s a little complicated. And 
it should be – it’s 
cryptography. Every 
requested transaction is 
packaged into a block with 
a timestamp, and broadcast 
to every machine on the 
network, the nodes, to be 
verified. once it is, the 
transaction goes through, 
the block is added to the 
chain, and all nodes are 
updated with the new 
longer chain. This 
blockchain is essentially a 
list of transactions. 
To verify a transaction, 
the blockchain must be 
checked to ensure sufficient 
coins have been added to 
your account to cover the 
output. These are then not 
considered valid for future 
transactions. Coins are kept 
in a wallet application, 
protected by cryptographic 
keys – one public, one 
private. your transaction is 
encrypted using your 
private key and the 
recipient’s public one, to 
ensure only they receive it, 
and they know it’s from you.
Before a block can be 
added to the chain, each 
must contain the answer to 
a complicated maths 
problem, created using a 
one-way cryptographic hash 
function, which essentially 
turns input into a mass of 
tangled data. To unlock this 
requires the network to 
guess a number which, 
combined with the previous 
block, gives the correct 
answer. Thus, each block is 
cryptographically locked to 
the previous one. 
These puzzles take 
considerable power to 
unlock. To reward those 
who go through the hard 
work, successful solutions 
receive Bitcoins. Each block 
can contain multiple 
transactions, limited by the 
block size: currently 1mB, 
with typically 1,700 
transactions for a Bitcoin. 
The difficulty level is 
periodically recalculated, to 
ensure that security is 
maintained, and that each 
block takes about ten 
minutes to process. Every 
four years, the block reward 
is halved. 
Security is tight. Nodes 
only accept the longest 
verified chain, and any 
erroneous block quickly 
disappears. To force the 
system to accept a modified 
transaction would involve 
taking on the combined 
mathematical power of all 
the nodes. Blockchain 
technology isn’t limited to 
cryptocurrencies; coins can 
represent anything, such as 
shares, copyright 
registrations, digital 
identities, contracts, votes, 
or anything else you want to 
keep on a secure verifiable 
ledger. Or the tokens can be 
the data itself – distributed

specifically with banks and business in mind, 
citing better security and scalability than 
Bitcoin and its ilk. You can trade in these 
business-orientated cryptocurrencies on the 
exchanges, but there’s none of the fun of 
mining, or watching values bounce around.
Mining coins offers the tantalising 
prospect of ‘free’ money, and it’s this aspect 
of cryptocurrencies that catches the eye of 
many. Fortunes made by adopters of the first 
currencies have fuelled a healthy interest in 
new launches. Getting in early is key: Hit on a 
coin that rises, be one of the first to mine, 
and you’re a millionaire in days. Yeah, well, 
probably not. It’s not 2012 anymore, and 
anything that looks to have a chance of 
being remotely successful has serious 
computing power thrown at it in short order. 
Despite what the sellers of mining machines 
may say, it is a tenuous business to run on a 
small scale, unless you hit the right vein.
Losing money
Any cryptography can be broken. The early 
years saw a number of large losses. In 2014, 
650,000 coins were stolen from what was at 
the time the biggest exchange – Mt. Gox, 
in Japan – leading to its bankruptcy, and 
the halving of Bitcoin’s value. Technology 
is improving, but there will always be the 
shadow of hacks, as there is in all electronic 
banking systems, generally originating from 
inside the company. The foundations of 
Bitcoin have proved to be robust enough to 
survive early glitches, though. 
As with any digital property, duplication 
is easy. If there can be one, there can 
be many. There are currently over 600 
cryptocurrencies, and frequent new 
launches. Their values drop as you scroll 
down the lists, from Bitcoin’s billions to 
virtually nothing for new contenders. There’s 
Titcoin, which is, ahem, designed to pay for 
‘adult services’. And PotCoin, which is, well, 
you guessed. Others are plain scams. At the 
bottom of the market, it’s like the Wild West. 
Last year, one of the senior Bitcoin 
developers, Mike Hearn, rather publicly left, 
and told the world why. He claimed it was 
a ‘failed experiment’. He bemoans the fact 
that, while founded on libertarian principles, 
Bitcoin was effectively controlled by five 
people who have the authority to change 
the source code, and that there was much 
dissent between them. The other problem he 
cited were the big miners: 95 percent of the 
network is controlled by a handful of people 
with big data centres. “The fundamentals are 
broken, and whatever happens to the price 
in the short term, the long-term trend should 
probably be downward”. 
His points about the control of 
Bitcoin are valid; his prediction on price 
is anybody’s guess. However, Bitcoin is

mining COINS
mining Bitcoins means 
running the shA256 double 
round hash verification 
process, the maths that 
verifies each block in the 
chain. Complete a block, and 
you are rewarded with a 
portion of a coin. Essentially, 
your processing power is 
converted into coins. The 
main cost is the electricity 
burnt to run the hardware. 
To help take some of the 
randomness out of hitting 
the solutions to each block, 
it’s best to join a mining 
pool, where efforts and 
rewards are spread.
In the early days, an 
average PC could do the job 
– the blockchain was short 
and the maths simpler. Fat 
chance now; you really need 
Application-specific 
integrated circuits, or Asic 
machines. These rigs pack 
the required mathematical 
power but are otherwise 
pared down to the 
minimum. mining power is 
measured in hashes per 
second – the base operation 
of the cryptography. These 
days, this is expressed in 
trillions of hashes per second 
(TH/s). Probably more 
important is efficiency: watts 
per gigahash (W/gh). 
Powerful machines are not 
cheap – a 14TH/s box 
running at 0.1W/gh would 
set you back £2,000 or so. 
Older and smaller machines 
are much cheaper – £150 or 
so – but are horribly 
inefficient. margins are tight, 
and the field of play very 
fluid. it’s a delicate balance 
between profit and loss, and 
only the latest and most 
efficient hardware has a 
chance to run profitably.
Still want to mine? If 
you’re serious, you’ll need an 
air-conditioned room, with 
substantial racks of the latest 
Asic machines, and a 
friendly electricity company. 
Too much? you can run a 
box or two at home, or 
cobble together custom rigs 
using high-end graphics 
cards. you don’t have to own 
the hardware yourself; cloud 
mines rent out capacity. you 
pay so much per TH/s, but 
you have to hope the cost is 
less than the returns. 
New cryptocurrencies are 
a gamble; modest hardware 
may return lots of coins, 
which the market may then 
decide are near worthless. 
Accusations of scams 
abound, and many clones of 
current blockchains are 
launched, and many 
flounder. yes, you could hit a 
winner early and win big, but 
the mining world is pretty 
savvy now, and competition 
is fierce. or you could stick to 
one of the established 
cryptocurrencies, and find 
that you’ve turned £500 of 
electricity into £300 of coins. 
It happens.
ASIC machines do the 
majority of mining now. This 
is an Antminer S9, capable 
of 13.5TH/s. The other 
product is heat. Serious 
farms need air conditioning 
– or, better yet, they operate 
near the Arctic Circle.
Cryptocurrency mining has recently 
led to a scarcity of certain graphics 
cards, such as AMD’s Radeon RX480.
Asus’s forthcoming B250 Mining Expert 
board will offer a staggering 19 expansion 
slots, in order to fit as many GPUs as 
possible in a single system.
increasingly looking to be a solid bet in 
the long term. A number of big players 
have made considerable investments in 
cryptocurrencies: venture capital names and 
hedge fund managers, through to key figures 
in the tech business. 
Snapchat’s Jeremy Liew went as far as 
postulating a Bitcoin value of $500,000 
(£369,600) by 2030. If that sounds optimistic, 
he is not alone. Facebook’s Chamath 
Palihapitiya said that “it’s the ultimate 
insurance policy against autocracy, currency 
curbs, and other forms of value destruction”. 
The digital equivalent of gold under the bed. 
Cryptocurrencies are popular in countries 
that have experienced financial disasters, 
such as hyperinflation, or have lived under 
oppressive governments. Not quite what its 
originators had in mind, but still. Big names 
invite confidence, and it’s this that keeps 
Bitcoin and its friends afloat. Bill Gates believes 
in it, and that’s good enough for most.
Predictions of any authority on the 
cryptocurrency market in the short term are 
next to impossible. It is young and volatile, 
and we can expect more spikes and crashes 
along the way. As markets mature, they tend 
to coalesce. Many smaller currencies will 
fade. Can Bitcoin make it? In one form or 
other, probably. Most likely as an investment 
unit; it’s just too slow in its current form for 
everyday money transfers. Bitcoin may not 
remain the main player, but it’s attracted 
enough investments to ensure it can survive 
some pretty heavy weather.
There are some terribly enthusiastic 
supporters for Bitcoin. They talk of a 
revolution, of values hitting $250,000 
(£184,800) a coin by 2020. A tantalising 
possibility. Given its limited supply, it would 
take much investment capital moving from 
gold or shares into Bitcoin to send values 
skyward. It has reached a point for many 
where a coin or two in a balanced portfolio 
is well worth considering. Bitcoin cannot be 
manipulated by governments; you cannot 
simply create more. Soon it will be readily 
tradable for goods and services, and be 
part of the monetary system. Then you may 
well be glad you have one. There are issues, 
which Mike Hearn highlighted. It may be 
free from government control, but it is still 
under control, and currently by a rather small 
group. There are interesting times ahead. 
Yes, Bitcoin could crash and burn, but so can 
any monetary system.
It’s clear that digital currency is here 
to stay. To those raised on hard cash and 
chequebooks, cryptocurrencies look odd. 
There’s no collateral, nothing underneath. 
But the genie is out of the bottle, and our 
kids won’t know a world without them. 
Meanwhile, there’s one clear winner: Satoshi 
Nakamoto. He/she/they mined a lot of the 
early coins, a million or so. ■

Windows 10 
Fall Creators Update

WindoWs 10 Fall Creators Update
eXplained
hen Windows 10 launched back in 2015, Microsoft 
promised that this would be the ultimate version 
of Windows that will continue to get new features 
and major updates well into the future, and it’s 
stayed true to its word with the release of the Fall 
Creators Update, the most recent package of new features that’s 
available to download for free.
Following on from this year’s earlier Creators Update, and last 
year’s Anniversary Update, the Fall Creators Update brings a wide 
range of new features and tools that makes Windows 10 even 
better. As the name suggests, many of these new features are 
geared towards creative pursuits, such as editing your home 
videos and photos, and exploring 3D worlds in mixed reality, but 
it also brings some more serious, behind-the-scenes, updates 
that make Windows 10 even more secure.
There are loads of new and exciting features in the Fall Creators 
Update, so we’ve put together this six-page guide that explores 
the biggest changes, and how they can transform the way you 
use Windows 10. Of course, it’s no good just banging on about 
the new features if you aren’t able to use them, so we’ll also show 
you how you download and install the Fall Creators Update right 
now, without having to wait for your computer to update itself.
The Fall Creators Update is a free update for all Windows 10 
users, and it’s been tested by Microsoft and a range of 
volunteers, so you should be able to download and install it 
without experiencing any issues.

The Fall Creators Update is here! This is everything you need to know

Installing the Update
The Fall Creators Update will make your PC even better than before - here 
are the steps you need to take for a happy and hassle-free upgrade
ne of the most pleasing 
results of Microsoft’s 
determination to make 
Windows 10 the ultimate 
version of Windows is 
that you get a 
constantly-evolving operating system 
that’s continually getting new features 
for free – rather than having to pay for a 
new operating system every five years. It 
also means you don’t need to worry 
about compatibility – if your PC or 
device is able to run Windows 10, then it 
means you’ll be able to install and run 
the Fall Creators Update as well.
As with previous major updates to 
Windows 10, such as the Anniversary 
Update, Microsoft will be rolling out the 
Fall Creators Update as an automatic 
update in waves. This means that for 
many people you won’t need to do 
anything to get the Fall Creators Update 
– Windows 10 will quietly download it 
when you’re doing something else, then 
will inform you when the update is 
ready to be installed.
By releasing the update in waves, it 
does mean you may have to wait for the 
update to appear. This isn’t necessarily a 
bad thing, since it means Microsoft’s 
servers aren’t being hammered by 
millions of users wanting to get the 
update right away. It also enables 
Microsoft to monitor the success of the 
software, and catch any bugs or issues. 
If some arise, Microsoft can get to work 
fixing those while the update rolls out.
If you are eager to try out the Fall 
Creators Update, and don’t want to wait 
for the rollout to reach your device, we 
don’t blame you, and thankfully there is 
an easy way to download and install the 
update yourself. Check out our step-by-
step guide on the facing page that will 
take you through the process.
preparing for the update
Whether you wait for the update to 
reach you via Microsoft’s rollout, or you 
manually download and install the Fall 
Creators Update, you should make sure 
that your device, and the important files 
and documents you store on it, are 
backed up and ready for the update. 
After all, this is a major update to your 
device’s operating system, and while it’s 
Changing your mind
Once you have installed 
the Fall Creators Update, 
you’re given a period of 
ten days to test out the 
new features. If, during 
that time, you don’t like 
the update, or there are 
problems that prevent 
your PC from working, 
then you can easily roll 
back to a previous 
version of Windows 10. 
To do this, go to 
Settings > ‘Update & 
security’ > Recovery and 
click on ‘Get started’ 
under where it says ‘Go 
back to the previous 
version of Windows 10’. A 
window will appear 
asking you why you want 
to revert to a previous 
version. Answer the 
question (this helps 
Microsoft improve future 
versions of Windows), 
then click ‘No, thanks’ 
from the next window. 
This is where you’ll be 
asked you if you want to 
check for any updates.
Click ‘Next’ on the 
window that follows, then 
‘Next’ again, making sure 
you have your Windows 
login details handy. Then 
click ‘Go back to earlier 
build’ and the Fall 
Creators Update will 
uninstall itself.
You’ll need to make sure you install the correct version of the Fall Creators Update for your processor
After the ten-day ‘trial’ period has elapsed you won’t be able to roll back the Fall Creators 
Update – you’ll need to do a full Windows 10 reinstall instead.

Windows Update
The easiest way to download and 
install the Fall Creators Update is to use 
the Windows Update tool. Type ‘Windows 
Update’ in the Search box on the Taskbar, 
then select ‘Check for updates’. If The Fall 
Creators Update is ready to be installed on 
your machine, it will appear here. Click to 
install the update, and follow the onscreen 
instructions. Your PC will need to restart, 
so make sure any open documents are 
saved before you begin.
2
Update assistant
If the Fall Creators Update doesn’t 
appear in Windows Update, then it means 
Microsoft hasn’t rolled out the update to 
your device yet. Don’t worry as Microsoft 
provides a tool for starting the upgrade 
manually, called the Update Assistant. Go 
to http://bit.ly/2iWVGEV and click ‘Update 
now’ to download it, then check for the 
latest version of Windows 10. Once 
downloaded, run it, then select Update 
Now. The tool will do the rest.
3
a fresh install
If you want a fresh install of the 
Fall Creators Update, you’ll need to 
download an ISO file with it included. This 
will wipe all your files and settings, so 
make sure they are backed up first. Go to 
the Download Windows 10 web page 
(http://bit.ly/2A3zV9B), and where it says 
‘Create Windows 10 installation media’, 
click the ‘Download tool now’ button. 
You’ll need a blank DVD or a USB flash 
drive with 5GB of free space for the files. 
unlikely that anything will go wrong, 
you don’t want to put your irreplaceable 
files at risk unnecessarily. So, the first 
thing you should do is make sure you 
have copies of any documents or photos 
you do not want to lose. This can be 
done by either copying the files to an 
external hard drive or USB flash drive, or 
by making sure the files are also stored 
on a cloud service, such as OneDrive, 
which is built into Windows 10, or the 
likes of Dropbox or Google Drive.
You’ll also want to make sure that 
your hard drive has enough space to 
download and install the Fall Creators 
Update. Microsoft recommends at least 
16GB of space for the 32-bit version, and 
20GB for the 64-bit version. Before 
installing the Fall Creators Update, you’ll 
need to know which version you’ll need. 
This is determined by whether or not 
your device has a 32-bit or 64-bit 
processor. As a general rule, most 
modern devices will have a 64-bit 
processor, but you can double-check to 
be sure by typing ‘System’ into the 
Search box on the Taskbar (right next to 
the Start menu button).
In the window that appears, there 
should be a setting labelled System. 
From there you’ll see ‘System type’ and 
it is here that Windows 10 will state 
whether it is 32-bit or 64-bit. Once you 
know which version you’re using, you 
can follow the guide below for installing 
the Fall Creators Update.
after installing the Update
Once you’ve downloaded and installed 
the Windows 10 Fall Creators Update, 
you can quickly check to make sure 
you’re running the update correctly by 
opening the Start Menu and clicking on 
the Settings button (the icon which 
looks like a cog). Click ‘System’ then 
About at the bottom of the left-hand 
menu. Under where it says ‘Windows 
specifications’ there will be a number 
next to where it says Version. The Fall 
Creators Update is version 1709, so if 
that number, or one higher than that, is 
displayed, then the Fall Creators Update 
has been successfully installed on your 
PC or other Windows device.
As with any major update to an 
operating system, there may be a few 
bugs or issues that need to be ironed 
out. In the Search box on the Taskbar, 
type in ‘Windows Update’ and then 
select ‘Check for updates’. If there are 
any further updates available, install 
them, since they may contain fixes for 
any problems you’re experiencing – 
another reason to back up your PC. 
How to install the Fall Creators Update

has enough space to download and 
install the Fall Creators Update”
To be sure you have the Fall Creators Update correctly installed, you can check the version number.

New features in full
The Fall Creators Update brings Mixed Reality, Fluent Design and better 
battery life to your PC – read on to find out these features can help you
Now that the Fall 
Creators Update has 
been downloaded and 
installed on your PC, the 
fun begins – checking 
out all the cool new 
things that Microsoft has included. 
There’s a huge amount of new features 
included in this update, so we will focus 
on the most exciting additions.
Windows Mixed reality
Probably the most incredible feature to 
have been added to Windows 10 with 
the Fall Creators Update, Windows 
Mixed Reality has the potential to 
change the way you interact with your 
PC in future. Essentially, it enables you 
to use Windows 10 and various apps in a 
virtual reality (VR) setting. A number of 
big name brands, such as Asus, Dell, HP 
and Lenovo have created special 
headsets for Windows Mixed Reality. 
You can explore Windows and its 
various Mixed Reality apps with the 
Mixed Reality Portal, which enables you 
to walk around a virtual home, and 
launch things from inside the home. 
Paint 3D, Microsoft’s reimagining of its 
classic Paint software that was brought 
in with the earlier Creators Update, has 
also been given a slight revamp with the 
Fall Creators Update, and now enables 
you to create 3D artwork and view it in 
3D in either a virtual reality setting 
using the headset, or placed in the real 
world using augmented reality (AR). This 
doesn’t need any fancy headsets – you 
can simply use a Windows 10 laptop or 
tablet with a back-facing camera. The 
camera captures the real world, while 
Windows 10’s Mixed Reality Viewer app 
intelligently places the 3D model into 
the real-world image displayed on the 
device’s screen. You can even move your 
device around to view the model from 
different angles.
improved edge browser
If you use Edge, Microsoft’s default web 
browser in Windows 10, then you’re 
going to love the Creators Fall Update, 
since it brings a number of new features 
to the software. You can once again pin 
your favourite websites to the Taskbar 
for easy access, and the browser can 
Mixed Reality headsets
One of the most exciting 
new features of the Fall 
Creators Update is 
support for Windows 
Mixed Reality, and to 
coincide with the launch 
of the update, a number 
of big names in the 
computing world have 
launched their devices.
For example, the Acer 
Windows Mixed Reality 
head-mounted display 
(HMD) launched at £300, 
while the Dell Visor can 
be bought for £350. 
Both of these prices are 
well below the asking 
price of VR headsets 
such as the Oculus Rift 
and HTC Vive. Other 
Mixed Reality headsets 
include the HP Windows 
Mixed Reality Headset, 
the Lenovo Explorer, the 
Asus Windows Mixed 
Reality Headset and the 
Samsung HMD Odyssey.
With this early support 
for Windows Mixed 
Reality from these 
brands, it’s clear there’s a 
lot of faith in Microsoft’s 
new augmented reality 
(AR)/virtual reality (VR) 
platform – and we 
should see even more 
Mixed Reality devices 
become available in the 
very near future.
Cortana has its 
own settings 
page now, for 
easy access.
Windows Mixed Reality mixes augmented reality and virtual reality tech to bring you a 
whole new way to interact with your PC – and gadget makers are already getting onboard.

a new store
Remember the Windows Store, 
that had an icon on your Taskbar and 
allowed you to install Windows apps? 
You’ll notice that with the Fall Creators 
Update the icon is no longer there – 
instead there’s a new icon that leads you 
to the Microsoft Store. Don’t worry, it’s 
essentially the same as before, it’s just that 
Microsoft has rebranded it so that it fits in 
with its non-Windows products – such as 
the Xbox One – as well.
2
search the store
Click on the icon to open the 
Microsoft Store and you’ll see the home 
page. This lists the top apps and games for 
you. Clicking on a tile will take you to 
more information. You can also browse by 
category: Apps shows you the Windows 
Apps available; Games if you fancy a break 
from working. Music, and Films & TV lets 
you buy or rent media. To find a particular 
app, game or media, type the name in the 
Search box at the top-right of the window.
3
Buy from the store
Once you’ve found what you’re 
looking for, you’ll be taken to a new page 
where you’ll see additional information. If 
you choose a game and see it is an Xbox 
Play Anywhere title, you’ll also be able to 
play it on your Xbox One – and you won’t 
need to pay for a second copy! If the app 
or game costs money the price will also be 
shown. Click the Buy button and follow 
the instructions to pay for the selection 
and install the app or game on your PC.
handle PDF files and e-books better as 
well, making it a very versatile tool.
So, if you have a stylus you can now 
write on and annotate PDF and e-books 
– useful if you’re using your device for 
studying, and you can also open and fill 
out PDF forms. As for e-books, your 
reading progress is synced with your 
Microsoft account, so you can carry on 
from where you left off when you switch 
to another device!
Cortana is better than ever
Microsoft has continued to invest in 
Cortana, the virtual personal assistant 
that made its debut with the first 
version of Windows 10, and it’s now 
smarter – and more useful – than ever 
before. You can now tweak Cortana 
from a new Cortana section in the 
Settings app, and the virtual assistant 
can now access your photos and 
recognise certain aspects of them, 
thanks to machine learning, enabling 
you to use Cortana to find particular 
photos faster. It even tags them for you.
You can also ask Cortana to control 
your PC, so you can say ‘Hey Cortana, 
restart PC’ or ‘Hey Cortana, lock PC’, and 
the virtual assistant will do your bidding.
Better battery life
The Fall Creators Update can also help 
prolong the life of the battery of your 
device. It does this thanks to a clever 
new feature known as Power Throttling, 
which enables Windows to control your 
processor, putting it into a low-power 
state when it’s not doing anything too 
taxing. By dropping the power 
consumption of the CPU – Microsoft 
claims it can reduce processor usage by 
up to 11 percent – your battery life 
could see a fair bit of improvement. 
Programs and apps that are running 
quietly in the background will have their 
processor power throttled, while 
programs that you’re currently using – 
and which need plenty of oomph to 
work smoothly – won’t be affected, so 
you should not see any nasty side 
effects as a result of this feature.
Power Throttling is turned on 
automatically when you set your PC to 
Battery Saver or Recommended mode in 
Windows 10. If you choose Best 
Performance, it’s disabled.
improved interface
Microsoft has been working hard on 
improving the look and feel of Windows 
10, and you can see some of the fruits of 
its labours with the Fall Creators Update. 
Known as Fluent Design, this new look 
uses transparency effects to make 
Windows 10 look better, while being 
easier to use. The Start menu has seen 
elements of Fluent Design added, and it 
can now be resized horizontally and 
vertically. The Action Centre (which 
appears on the right side of the screen) 
has also been given a new look. ■

Mayank’s solution
OpenDNS (www.
opendns.com) offers 
several ways in which 
you can both improve security and 
performance across your entire 
network. For it to apply to every 
device on your network, log on to 
your router through your web 
browser and go hunting for its DNS 
settings – these may be on their 
own tab, on the main screen or 
under the DHCP settings.
For basic OpenDNS, set the 
primary DNS to 208.67.222.222  
and the secondary DNS to 
208.67.220.220 respectively. This 
should deliver noticeably faster 
response times when accessing 
web pages. Some protection is 
built-in, but if you’re happy to apply 
a network-wide pornographic filter, 
set the router’s DNS settings to 
208.67.222.123 and 208.67.220.123 
instead. Now all adult content will 
be blocked automatically from all 
connected devices.
If that’s a step too far, leave the 
basic OpenDNS settings in place 
and sign up for OpenDNS Home 
Free at https://signup.opendns.

BEST INTERNET 
AccELERATOR 
Q I would like to speed up my 
broadband connection. 
What’s the best free Internet 
accelerator tool for Windows 7?
Peter claxton
Rob’s solution
Internet accelerator 
tools basically attempt 
to tweak various system 
settings to fine-tune network and 
Internet performance. They won’t 
have any effect on your physical 
connection, but you may find they 
have a minor performance benefit 
(it’s unlikely you’ll see major 
improvements, however). We could 
only find one free tool – Internet 
Accelerator, which you can 
download from www.pointstone.
com (look under Software > 
Freebies). Although Internet 
Accelerator will run on Windows 10, 
it’s not been designed for it; we 
recommend trying it on older 
versions of Windows, and take a 
System Restore point or drive 
image first, just in case it makes 
things worse and the Restore 
Defaults option doesn’t work.

UPDATE cRIPPLED My 
USER AccOUNT 
Q My main – and only 
administrator – user account 
has lost key functionality after a 
Windows feature update: no Start 
menu, search facility, library files or 
drive access. I’ve tried various 
solutions, and even performed a 
refresh install, but it hasn’t fixed the 
problem. Strangely, my wife’s 
non-administrator account is 
unaffected. Please can you help?
kevin Riddick
Nick P’s solution
Kevin had managed to 
create another user 
account, but it was a 
standard user, with no apparent 
means for elevating to 
administrator. Thankfully, this can 
be done by temporarily enabling 
the system Administrator account.

laptops. The best eMMC can’t 
compete with SSD when it

corrupt partitions – hopefully it’ll 
be immediately visible, enabling 
you to select and mount it, then 
copy the files off intact.
If this fails, you may need to take 
a risk and try a quick format when 
prompted by Windows. Once 
complete, DMDE or even Recuva 
(www.piriform.com) should be able 
to detect any recoverable data. As 
always with data recovery, avoid

FLAky ETHERNET 
cONNEcTION 
Q Since upgrading to fibre 
broadband my PC’s Ethernet 
connection has kept dropping out. I 
have a Wi-Fi adaptor, which works 
fine with it, and none of my other 
Ethernet-connected devices have 
any problems. What’s the cure?
Tom West
Mayank’s solution
This could be either a 
driver problem or a 
hardware glitch. Tom 
tried a different Ethernet cable as 
well as router port, all to no avail, 
plus verified he had the latest 
drivers installed. The upgrade to 
fibre appears to have been 
coincidental, although the act of 
plugging the PC’s Ethernet cable 
into a new router may have 
triggered or exacerbated an 
underlying issue. Tom revealed that 
his Ethernet port – which was part 
of his PC’s motherboard – did 
wiggle when touched, which 
suggests a loose connection 
caused by a dry solder joint. 
Tom wasn’t confident with a 
soldering iron, but he had a spare 
internal PCI-Express slot, so we 
directed him towards the TP-Link 
TG-3468 PCIe Gigabit Ethernet card 
(http://bit.ly/2hTDmZQ), which is 
available for around £8.50 online. 
Installing and using this resolved 
Tom’s connection problem.
Windows
SySTEM RESTORE 
PROBLEM 
Q I’m stymied with regards to 
upgrading to Windows 10. My 
Windows 7 Ultimate PC refuses to 
carry out a System Restore, which I 
regard as vital when upgrading. 
The fault is 0x80070005, which 
appears to be a common one, but 
with no simple fix. Can you advise?
John Ellinghouse
Nick O’s solution
System Restore isn’t 
needed during an 
upgrade – it’s not 
required should you subsequently 
want to roll back your system to the 
previous version. A more effective 
fallback would be to take a system 
image using Macrium Reflect Free 
(www.macrium.com/reflectfree) or 
the built-in Windows Backup and 
Restore tool – then if anything bad 
does happen, you will be able to 
restore Windows 7 effortlessly.
There’s little point in trying to fix 
System Restore ahead of the 
upgrade – a better bet is to wait 
until Windows 10 is in place and see 
whether it’s magically fixed by the 
update. System Restore will be 
switched off by default – switch it 
back on by typing ‘System restore’ 
into the Search box and clicking 
‘Create a Restore point’. If the 
problem persists, get back in 
contact and we’ll continue to 
examine the problem. ■

70 How to master the 
Windows 10 desktop 
72 Change the way 
the Start menu works
 

You’ll spend a lot of time there, so here are 
some great ways to make it work for you…
Master the desktop
hen not actually using 
applications, the Windows 
desktop is where you’ll 
spend much of your time, 
moving files about, hunting for that 
obscure application you installed six 
months ago and suddenly need, or 
lining up your windows so that they 
fill the space perfectly (a time-wasting 
pastime that’s all but dead now 
thanks to window snapping).
In Windows 10, the desktop and the 
Taskbar get a few new tricks that 
make working with files and folders 
even easier, and the new search bar 
means pulling up an application you 
don’t use often is a breeze. Follow 
these tips to a happy start…
W
1 Show desktop/peek
The Show Desktop button isn’t marked, and some people 
don’t even know it exists. Press this anonymous section at the 
extreme right of the Taskbar, and all your open windows will 
minimise. Hover the mouse pointer over it, and you’ll get a 
preview ‘peek’ at the desktop that reverts when you move your 
mouse pointer away. It’s very useful when you’ve got a chaotic 
number of windows open on your desktop.
2 Virtual desktops
If you find your desktop frequently getting overcrowded as 
you work, why not offload some of the mess onto another one? 
Click the Task View button to the right of Cortana’s search box on 
the Taskbar, and you’ll be taken to a screen that shows your open 
apps, and also your desktops. Add a new one, or even more, and 
you’ll be able to flick between them with different apps open on 
each. It’s a great way to stay organised on your PC.
4 Window snapping
A real godsend for those who used to tease their window 
edges out until they exactly matched the edge of the screen, 
snapping in Windows 10 enables you to have two or more 
windows open that completely fill their areas of the screen. Pick 
up a window and move it to the extreme left or right edge of the 
desktop to try it (you’ll see it ‘snap’ to the new half screen format). 
You can adjust how much of the screen they take up too.
3 Scroll inactive windows
An annoyance for anyone who’s come to Windows from 
using the Mac, the ability to scroll the window your pointer is 
currently over – instead of the one that’s currently active – is new 
in Windows 10. So, if you have a browser and a word processor 
open, and are reading one while typing in the other, you can now 
scroll down in the browser without having to take your focus 
away from your text document.
70  |  
  |  Christmas 2017

5 Desktop icons
The Windows 10 desktop icons have a pixellated look, and 
if this offends you it’s easy to change them. Luckily, there are icon 
packs available online – including the shinier Windows 8 icons. 
Download the icon pack you want to use, then go to Start > 
Settings > Personalisation > Themes. Click the ‘Desktop icon 
Settings’ and select the icons you want to place on the desktop, 
then use the Change Icon option to change their look.
6 Shake to minimise
This may sound like something left over from a tablet build 
of Windows that needs a built-in accelerometer, but picking up a 
window with your mouse pointer and shaking it back and forth 
will minimise every other window, leaving you with a clear and 
uninterrupted view of the one you want to work with. It’s much 
faster than clicking several minimise buttons, and it’s a fun little 
quirk that’s a good one to remember.
8 Window management
In addition to window snapping, you can arrange your 
windows in some other ways too. Right-click on the Taskbar to 
reveal three window arrangement schemes: ‘Cascade windows’; 
‘Show windows stacked’; and ‘Show windows side by side’. These 
are similar to the Windows menu’s functions that have been 
available all the way back to Windows 3.1, and can make it quick 
and easy to find what you’re looking for.
7 Notifications
The notifications panel – or Action Centre – slides in from 
the right of the screen, with a button in the system tray, and will 
house any messages that apps or Windows components want to 
send you. It’s where you’ll find links to details of Windows updates 
that have been installed on your machine, and any social media 
messages or upcoming calendar events. You can customise it so 
it’s as intrusive as you can deal with.

Welcome to Windows 10 
Master the desktop

The Start menu in Windows 10 is more powerful than 
ever – here are some easy tips to make it work for you
Customise the Start menu
he Start menu’s return was big news 
when Windows 10 launched, and it 
has evolved as the operating system 
has been updated. It’s become a fast, 
and efficient way to access apps and settings – 
Windows 8’s full-screen monstrosity is now a 
distant memory, thankfully!
However, if you don’t like how the Start menu 
looks when you first pop it up on your fresh 
install of Windows 10, it doesn’t have to stay that 
way. It’s fully customisable in ways that were 
never possible in earlier versions of the 
operating system, and can be made to work in 
just about any way you want, standing out from 
its background for ease of reading, or 
automatically blending in with the colour 
scheme of whatever theme you have currently 
set on your desktop.
T
1  
Colour
Your Start menu’s background can be any colour you like 
– all you have to do is untick a box. Open up Settings, then 
Personalisation and finally Colours. Untick the ‘Automatically pick 
an accent colour from my background’ option and you’ll be able 
to pick a colour from the palette. So your Start menu can be a 
contrasting red or yellow rather than a dull blue or grey. Play 
around to find a combination that works for you.
2  
Size
To make space for all the customising you can do to the 
Start menu, you can easily resize it to your liking. Just move your 
mouse pointer to the top-border or right-border of the Start 
Menu, the pointer will change into arrows, and you’ll be able to 
increase or decrease height and width, dragging it out to 
completely fill the screen if you want to. This is particularly useful 
if you have a PC filled with programs that you access regularly.
4 Hide program lists
By default, the Start menu will show you lists of both your 
most used programs and the most recently opened ones. This can 
end up repeating itself, so if you want to get rid of one or the 
other of the lists, or both, open up Settings > Personalisation > 
Start, from where you’ll be able to toggle the lists on or off. You 
can also prevent apps from appearing on the lists so you only get 
a view of the things you really need from day to day.
3  
Folders and tiles
Your Start menu is made up of lists and tiles, and some of 
these can be shortcuts to folders such as Documents. Settings > 
Personalisation > Start enables you to tinker with this, so if you 
never shoot videos you can stop the empty Videos folder from 
taking up space on the menu. You can turn the links to the 
Settings window – and the one that opens an empty File Explorer 
window – on and off too.
72  |  
  |  Christmas 2017

8  
Bring back the Start screen!
It may have been almost universally mocked and reviled in 
Windows 8, but the full-screen Start menu is still there in Windows 
10, ready to block out all your work at a single press of the [Win] 
key! But, if you liked it, go to Settings > Personalisation > Start and 
tick the box marked ‘Use full-screen Start when in the desktop’. 
Note that wording: the Start menu now won’t actually cover up 
your apps like it used to do in Windows 8.
7  
Pin tiles and shortcuts
If there’s something you need to be able to find quickly, but 
which gets lost in the lists of the Start menu, you can pin and 
reposition it so it’s always prominently placed. To do that right-
click an item and choose ‘Pin to Start’. It will now appear in tiles. 
Now click and drag the tile to where to want to move it to. To 
resize the tile, right-click, choose Resize then the tile size you 
want. You can pin shortcuts to the Taskbar for easy access too.
5  
Use it to search with
Hitting the [Win] key on your keyboard to pop up the Start 
menu’s Search box is one of the fastest ways to look for anything 
in Windows 10. Just type a few characters and you will get 
suggestions for applications and documents stored on your 
computer that match your initial query. You can also use the 
arrow keys on your keyboard to navigate the Start menu, if you’d 
rather not use the mouse.
6  
Live tiles
Live tiles are tiles that are constantly updated with data, 
usually gleaned over the internet to make them up-to-date. 
There’s one for the Mail app that shows your most recent 
messages, one for the Weather app that uses your PC’s location to 
tell you what’s going on outside the window, and so on. If you 
find them distracting, you can turn them off by right-clicking 
them and choosing the appropriate option.

rivals from the Lenovo Miix 510 and 
Acer Switch 3 to Samsung’s 
Android-powered Galaxy Book.
Now HP is at it. Well, at it again, 
since this is the latest iteration of 
the Spectre x2. Previously posited 
as an affordable alternative to the 
Surface Pro, it’s now anything but. 
Starting at an aggressive £1,349 
($1,149) price point, the HP Spectre 
x2 intimidates with more than its 
gold-and-black aluminium finish.
Pricing and availability
The HP Spectre x2’s price isn’t bad 
when you consider its spec. For 
$1,299, the US model, tested here, 
has a 2.4GHz Intel Core i7-7560U 
processor, 8GB of RAM and 360GB 
of solid-state storage. Pair that with 
a 3,000x2,000 display, and you have 
a better-than-competent slate. 
For £1,549 ($1,599), the Surface 
Pro comes with a slightly better 
2.5GHz Intel Core i7-7660U, 8GB of 
RAM, a 256GB SSD and 2,736x1,824 
PixelSense display. In the UK, the HP 
Spectre x2 is available in only one 
version. It packs the same Core i7 
i7-7560U chip and 8GB of RAM as 
the US model, but has 512GB of 
flash storage and a £1,449 asking 
price. That also covers a three-year 
Care Pack should anything go awry.
Design
One of the best parts of owning an 
HP Spectre x2 is flaunting it at a 
coffee shop or library. Those 
familiar with HP’s other offerings 
will recognise its illuminant 
appearance from the HP Spectre 
and Spectre x360 15 before it. 
Trimmed with a gold stand and a 
chic logo to match, the HP Spectre 
x2 is a design feat. It doesn’t make 
the same mistake as the Lenovo 
Miix 510, a more evident derivation 
of the Surface Pro, by effectively 
enabling it to thrive independent 
from its main tastemaker. It’s a near 
bezel-less beauty that destroys the 
notion that gold is gaudy. 
In fact, none of the issues you’ll 
experience with the HP Spectre x2 
have to do with its form, but rather 
it’s function that’s to blame for its 
few shortcomings. The most 
heartbreaking of these is the 
trackpad – wide and functional, it 
ultimately overstays its welcome. 
Don’t think about seating this 
tablet even slightly off the edge of 
your table or desk. On our review 
unit at least, the HP Spectre x2 can 
be audibly and haptically clicked on 
both the left and right-hand side 
areas on the outside of the 
trackpad. You can imagine how 
much of a nuisance this can be.
Aside from that, the HP Spectre 
x2 is a joy to use. The stunning 
display is noticeably more vivid 
than that of the Surface Pro, not to 
mention the magnetically-attached 
keyboard and Active Stylus Pen,

test. That’s a simulation of normal 
productivity tasks you might 
engage in throughout the day.
Now, four hours and 45 minutes 
is how long the HP Spectre x2 
lasted in our movie test, where we 
loop Guardians of the Galaxy in VLC 
player at 50 percent brightness 
until the system dies. That’s longer 
than in the PCMark 8 test, but it’s 
only useful for determining battery 
life in passive use cases. 
More demanding tasks, such as 
video editing, will kill the battery 
faster, making this a tablet you’ll 
have to keep plugged in most of 
the time. The HP Spectre x2 
certainly can’t keep up with the 
Surface Pro, which lasted four hours 
and three minutes, and six hours 
and 58 minutes respectively.
Summary
The HP Spectre x2 is clad with 
darling looks that distinguish it 
from the competition. It may be 
slightly weaker than the closest 
Surface Pro configuration it rivals, 
but it’s also less expensive. Sadly, 
the scrupulous trackpad and 
pedestrian battery life make the 
Spectre x2 a chore to use on the go. 
Whereas the Surface Pro brings 
better penmanship and battery life 
to the table, the HP Spectre x2 is a 
testament to fashion and value on 
high-end Windows 10 tablets. ■
The HP Spectre x2 is one of the 
best Windows tablets ever made. 
Only poor battery life lets it down.
which are bundled in the package. 
Plus, there’s a microSD card slot, a 
headphone jack and two USB-C 
ports to work with.
There are two cameras on-board 
here, one to be used as a regular 
webcam and, the other, an infra-red 
sensor for Windows Hello facial 
recognition-based logins. The latter 
works well, despite you having to 
reconfigure it from time to time.
It’s a miracle that the Spectre x2 
comes with a stylus at all, yet we 
have to complain where it’s due. 
This isn’t the Surface Pen. This is the 
HP Active Pen, a dual-button 
writing and drawing tool that 
supports only 2,048 pressure points 
of sensitivity, as opposed to the 
4,096 of the Surface Pro.
Still, 2,048 pressure levels is 
nothing to scoff at. It’s the same 
number you could expect from a 
Wacom Cintiq tablet. Once 
heralded as the pen tablet to end 
all pen tablets, however, the Cintiq 
has fallen behind the times in 
recent years, so to say that the HP 
Spectre x2 shares its sensitivity will 
garner a ‘so what?’ from Microsoft.
Performance
The HP Spectre x2 is handsome and 
powerful. Its i7 processor doesn’t 
boast quite as much horsepower as 
the newest Surface Pro, though  
– and that’s something that’s 
reflected in our benchmarks.
In our 3DMark Sky Diver test, the 
HP Spectre x2 scores 4,238 points 
compared to the Surface Pro’s 
6,431. While in the more CPU-
centric Cinebench test, the Spectre 
x2 scored 351 points compared to 
the Surface Pro’s 414. 
That’s not to say the Spectre x2 is 
lacking, only that HP has opted for 
a more conservative i7 chip than 
Microsoft has in the Surface Pro. 
This is likely an effort to keep costs 
down while still brandishing an i7. 
The HP Spectre x2 still performs 
better than the Intel Core i5-
equipped Lenovo Miix 510, which 
scores 3,269 and 323 points in Sky 
Diver and Cinebench, respectively.
In real-world applications, these 
numerical differences between the 
HP Spectre x2 and the Surface Pro 
don’t matter much. They’re both 
highly capable flagships that can 
double as your tablet and your PC, 
replacing each if you’re so inclined.
Battery life
The more important question is, 
how long can you expect to use the 
HP Spectre x2 without its clunky 
power adaptor? Unfortunately, the 
answer is not long – just two hours 
and 40 minutes, according to our 
PCMark 8 Conventional battery life

iaomi has fingers in a lot of 
pies. The Chinese company 
maybe better known for its 
smartphones but it also makes a 
host of other products, from air 
purifiers to electric rice cookers. Its 
laptops, however, have been the 
real head-turners over the past 18 
months. Following the Xiaomi Mi 
Notebook Air 13.3 (2017) and the 
Xiaomi Air 12, meet the new kid on 
the block, the Mi Notebook Pro.
Design
Ruthless postmodernism is how 
one might define the design of the 
Mi Notebook Pro – the chaps in 
charge at Xiaomi opted for a darker 
colour scheme compared to its 
smaller sibling. ‘Deep grey’, as they 
call it, is an attractive alternative to 
the silver brushed metal designs 
that most ultra-slim laptops sport.
There’s no significant tapered 
profile here. Instead, you have an 
almost perfectly rectangular slab of 
metal alloy – with some curves here 
and there – that weighs just under 
2kg, with its dimensions (360x244x 
15mm) making it hardly portable; 
that’s the price you have to pay for 
its 15.6-inch display.
In comparison, the Mi Notebook 
Air, which sports roughly the same 
configuration, is more than a third 
lighter and costs less. The biggest 
differences are the size and fewer 
ports. With the Notebook Pro, you 
get one HDMI port, two USB Type A 
ports and an audio jack on the left 
side, with two USB Type-C ports 
and an SD card reader on the right. 
Note that one of the Type-C 
connectors is used as a power port. 
The power button is located at the 
top right-hand side of the device, 
not our favourite location.
As with other Xiaomi laptops, 
there’s no logo on the top of the 
device. Flipping it over exposes a 
large flat surface with a Mi logo, a 
removable sticker, five rubber feet, 
a pair of speaker grilles and a 
multitude of air vents. Open the 
laptop and you’ll see that display, 
which is covered by a Gorilla Glass 
sheet, an odd choice given that the 
display is not touch-capable.
The long, single hinge is 
reminiscent of Apple’s notebooks, 
and so is the layout of the 
keyboard. Remember, this is a 
15.6-inch model so it has enough 
space for a numeric keypad. You 
won’t find one here, though – 
instead Xiaomi has opted for 
full-size keys with a low activation 
force, short 1.5mm travel (to give 
better sense of confirmation), a 
0.3mm thick hyperboloid keycap 
(rather than a flat one) and a 
noticeable absence of any double-
function keys – at least on the main 
bank of keys.
And yes, this is a backlit keyboard 
and unlike some competitors, it 
only offers an on-off option. The 
touchpad is large and houses a 
fingerprint reader. It doesn’t have 
physical right and left buttons 
which might put off some folks.

are fed by a heat pipe (which is 
itself connected to a large ‘thermal 
conductivity area’) and they kick in 
– with a vengeance – when the 
CPU/GPU becomes too hot.
The keyboard offers superb 
feedback and good travel on a par 
with the major league rivals, while 
the touchpad is sensitive and 
responds well to finger gestures.
The screen is the outstanding 
component here. With a Full HD 
resolution and 300-nit brightness, it 
provides the optimum level of 
performance for most tasks. 
Colours are bright and punchy, 
although some might complain 
about the lower pixel density (lack 
of sharpness) usually associated 
with large displays.
The model sent for review was 
the cheapest of three versions 
available. The Xiaomi Mi Notebook 
Pro is also available – on pre-order 
at the time of writing – with a Core 
i7-8550U processor, and in a variant 
with 16GB of memory.
Summary
The Xiaomi Mi Notebook Pro is a 
great laptop – an outstanding piece 
of technology, in fact. The question 
is whether you’re prepared to 
spend almost £870 ($1,140) – and 
potentially far more than that if you 
have to add taxes – on a piece of kit 
knowing that you will have to 
reinstall Windows, and also 
potentially wait for months for 
support/repairs if anything goes 
wrong. On balance, we wouldn’t do 
this ourselves, but if you are ready 
to take a punt, then this notebook 
is a fantastic piece of kit. ■
The Mi Notebook Pro is a great 
laptop, with cutting-edge specs 
and affordable pricing.
Specifications
The Xiaomi Mi Notebook Pro is one 
of the very few laptops to feature 
Dolby’s Atmos sound technology, 
which is used in conjunction with 
the onboard pair of 2.5W Harman 
Kardon Infinity speakers.
It is also one of the first to offer 
an 8th-generation Intel Core 
processor. Our review sample came 
with the Core i5-8250U, which is far 
superior to previous Core i5 CPUs 
for one good reason: it is the first 
time that Intel has opted for a 
quad-core architecture for the i5 
range, and it’s one that supports 
multi-threading.
So it has four cores, eight threads, 
a base frequency of 1.6GHz and a 
Turbo frequency of 3.4GHz. Add in 
6MB cache, support for DDR4-2400 
memory and a new graphics 
subsystem (Intel UHD Graphics 620) 
and you have a compelling CPU 
that should easily surpass even a 
Core i7-7600U processor in 
multi-threaded tasks.
The Nvidia GeForce MX150 
discrete GPU, which is equipped 
with 2GB GDDR5 memory, is based 
on the Pascal architecture and 
should deliver up to around a third 
extra performance compared to 
the GeForce 940MX. The MX150 
also supports Optimus technology, 
which enables applications to 
switch seamlessly between Intel’s 
integrated graphics and the 
dedicated graphics to save battery 
life when the latter isn’t needed.
Performance
This laptop performs more like a 
Core i7 than a Core i5-powered 
model, especially on heavily-
threaded applications, such as 
Cinebench, where the extra grunt 
of the Nvidia discrete GPU comes in 
handy. The Mi Notebook Pro 
achieves a staggering 89.44 fps on 
that benchmark, an almost 
unheard-of score for a non-
workstation device. Its read/write 
speeds struggle to match those of 
the Xiaomi Notebook Air 2017, 
though, despite using the same 
Samsung PM961 NVMe SSD. You 
should not see any big difference in 
real-life performance, however.
The 61Whr 4-cell battery also 
enables this machine to last for  
seven hours 22 minutes between 
recharges – that’s less than a 
MacBook Pro, but is still better than 
most PC laptops – note the Mi 
Notebook Pro comes with a 
Chinese version of Windows 10 
Home Edition and had to be 
reformatted to be benchmarked.
The Mi Notebook Pro is noisy 
under heavy usage, which is to be 
expected. There are two fans that

ith PC graphics cards 
becoming increasingly 
powerful, using a 4K Ultra 
HD monitor is an increasingly viable 
option, and the BenQ PD3200U is 
an excellent example of a 4K screen 
for  both business and pleasure.
At such a high resolution, you 
need a large screen to avoid having 
to squint at tiny text and minuscule 
icons, and with its 32-inch diagonal 
screen size, the BenQ PD3200U 
provides that while avoiding being 
obnoxiously large – remember, this 
is a monitor for your desk, not a TV.
BenQ is a trusted brand when it 
comes to monitors, and we’ve had 
plenty of nice things to say about 
its other displays, so we’re hoping 
for big things from this big monitor.
Price and availability
A 4K monitor of this size is never 
going to be a budget proposition; 
however at £800 (around $1,000), 
the BenQ PD3200U is actually 
pretty reasonably priced.
It means that having a large 4K 
monitor isn’t going to necessarily 
break the bank. However, there are 
cheaper 4K monitors out there. The 
Acer XB281HK, for example, is a 
28-inch UHD monitor with G-Sync 
and a 1ms response rate, and can 
be had for £600 (around $800), 
while the Philips 328P6VJEB is the 
same size as the BenQ PD3200U, 
but can be had for around £530 
($700). It doesn’t have some of the 
PD3200U’s more pro-orientated 
features, but it’s a good alternative.
Design and features
The BenQ PD3200U looks simple 
yet elegant. It’s clear this is a 
monitor made with work and 
productivity in mind. BenQ 
describes it as a “simple, functional 
design for increased efficiency”, 
which we’d broadly agree with.
The PD3200U maybe big, but it 
doesn’t feel it, thanks to the thin 
bezels that surround it. Its footprint 
is reasonable too, so it doesn’t feel 
like its taking up an inordinate 
amount of space on your desk. The 
supplied stand can be put together 
and attached to the screen without 
the need for any tools, which makes 
set-up easy, yet it still feels sturdy.  
Its neck is also fully adjustable, 
enabling you to tilt and swivel the 
screen and adjust the height. The 
screen can be rotated 90 degrees 
into portrait mode, giving you 
more flexibility. The neck is also set 
quite far back into the base, so the 
screen can be pushed back for 
more desk space. There’s an 
integrated carry handle too.
The PD3200U also comes with a 
KVM (Keyboard Video Mouse) 
switch, which enables you to plug 
in a second PC and switch between 
the two using a single monitor, 
keyboard and mouse, making your 
desk even less cluttered.
On the right-hand side of the 
monitor are two HDMI 2.0 ports, a 
DisplayPort 1.2, a mini DisplayPort, 
SD card slot, two USB 3.0 ports and

editor and more. Ultra HD 
resolution is equivalent to four 
1080p screens, and it feel like you 
have a huge amount of space when 
using the PD3200U – albeit without 
the fuss and extra desk space you’d 
need to drive four separate 
monitors at the same time.
Images and video files also look 
excellent on the BenQ PD3200U. 
This is where the factory calibration 
really comes into its own – the 
PD3200U looks great straight out of 
the box, little tweaking needed.
If you’re buying this as a business 
monitor for your work you’ll be 
impressed with its performance, 
especially considering its price.
But what about performance for 
non-professional applications? The 
PD3200U supports HDR, which 
along with the HDMI 2.0 support 
makes this a viable screen for 4K 
games consoles and UHD.
Although the 60Hz refresh rate 
won’t impress gamers used to 
higher refresh rates and G-Sync or 
FreeSync technology, if you’re 
playing modern games at 4K, 60Hz 
is all you need. Its 4ms response 
time is on the slow side, though.
If you’re looking for an excellent 
high-resolution monitor with 
accurate colour reproduction, 
which can also do a good job of 
displaying films and games, the 
BenQ PD3200U is a great choice.
Summary
The BenQ PD3200U performs 
brilliantly with its 4K resolution and 
large screen size helping to boost 
your productivity. Other monitors 
feel claustrophic by comparison. ■
The BenQ PD3200U is a fantastic 
4K monitor, suited to home and 
professional applications alike.
a 3.5mm audio port. With HDMI 2.0 
you can now use HDMI to display 
4K visuals at 60Hz, which means 
you can also plug in a PS4 Pro or 
Xbox One X into the monitor and 
use it as a display for those.
As far as features go, the BenQ 
PD3200U’s main selling point is its 
3,840x2,160 resolution, which 
provides excellent image quality.
The 32-inch screen size – which 
amounts to a 708.4mmx398.5mm 
display area – ensures that, despite 
the high resolution, text, icons and 
other visual elements aren’t too 
small, with the pixel-per-inch count 
coming in at a comfortable 137.68.
The panel type is IPS, with a 
native contrast of 1,000:1. This 
ensures viewing angles are very 
good, which is essential for a screen 
of this size, as when sitting in front 
of it at a desk it really does take up 
almost all of your peripheral vision.
With BenQ is pitching this as a 
pro monitor, colour accuracy at any 
angle is important, and the 100 
percent sRGB colour gamut adheres 
to industry standards. It also meets 
Rec. 709 video production specs.
The PD3200U is part of BenQ’s 
Designer Monitor range, which 
means it has been individually 
factory-calibrated before being 
shipped. Plus, it comes with a range 
of modes for professionals, such as 
a CAD/CAM mode, which ups the 
contrast for lines and shapes in 
technical illustrations. It also 
includes Low Blue Light and 
Flicker-free technology, making it 
more comfortable to use at night. 
Animation Mode boosts the 
brightness of dark areas without 
overexposing light areas of an 
image, while Darkroom Mode, 
enables you to work comfortably in 
dark environments. A customisable 
switch (included) connects to the 
monitor and enables you to switch 
between presets and options.
Both the straightforward design 
and the breadth of features makes 
the PD3200U an excellent monitor   
for productivity, and its selection of 
ports allow it to perform as a great 
entertainment screen as well.
Performance
In use, the BenQ PD3200U is very 
impressive. Windows 10 scales 
brilliantly at 4K, and even at that 
high resolution, menus, text and 
icons are easily readable, mainly 
because of the large screen size.
You can work comfortably on the 
PD3200U with a large number of 
programs and windows open, 
including web browsers which are 
able to show almost entire web 
pages without the need for 
scrolling, along with an image

T
he Silicon Power Armor A85 
may look like a hip flask 
containing some luxurious 
libation, but in reality it’s a portable 
external hard drive that’s been built 
to be abused beyond all reasonable 
expectations – it’s shockproof, dust- 
and waterproof to IP68, drop-proof 
to US military standards (up to 3m) 
and is pressure-proof too – Silicon 
Power’s marketing for the product 
even shows it under the wheels of a 
parked car, although that’s not 
something we’d suggest you try.
The 1TB model on test here sells 
for around £78 in the UK and $75 in 
the US. It’s also available in 2TB, 
3TB, 4TB and 5TB capacities, so you 
can choose the model which best 
meets your needs. The top-end 5TB 
model costs £227/$248.
Design
There are only two items in the box: 
the Armor A85 and a short (32cm) 
USB cable that has Type A super-
speed connectors at both ends.
The advantage of this design is 
never worrying about which end to 
plug in. However, this layout isn’t a 
common USB cable, so misplacing 
it might prove problematic.
Silicon Power’s approach to 
avoiding that scenario is to make 
the join between the black cap and 
the sandblasted aluminium section 
a thick rubber band that you can 
use to hold the cable. We’re not 
sure how well this will work in 
practice, but at least Silicon Power 
has considered that cable loss 
could be an issue.
The USB Type A port on the drive 
is hidden under a thick plug on the 
black cap end that incorporates a 
tight rubber seal. The plug looks 
good for keeping unwanted water 
and dirt out of the drive, but it’s 
also an excellent route to breaking 
a fingernail trying to pop it out.
The temptation would be to 
leave it in the open state, but failure 
to replace it after use would 
undermine the ability of the drive 
to handle being accidentally 
dunked in water, of course.
A downside of this level of 
protection is that if the hard drive 
dies inside its cocoon, that’s where 
it will stay – no practical means to 
extract it exists, at least not without 
an angle grinder.
Beyond these points, there is 
relatively little to say about this 
design, other than it’s built to 
handle abuse rather than win any 
style awards.
On one level, the A85 Armor is 
just a hard drive stuffed inside a 
thick metal tube. However, that 
thinking ignores the tricky technical 
details the Silicon Power engineers 
had to resolve to make that work. 
Like avoiding overheating issues 
with the drive in an enclosed metal 
space, and cosseting the drive from 
accidental assaults of water, dust, 
and the general trials and 
tribulations of careless ownership.
The solution isn’t subtle, and 
primarily involves the creation of a

unbelievably, drive a car over it. So 
obligingly – post-benchmarking 
– that’s exactly what we did.
Unsurprisingly, the car exercise 
did leave some minor abrasions on 
the Armor A85, but that didn’t stop 
it from working. The A85 also 
survived complete immersion in 
water, though it’s worth noting that 
it doesn’t float. That’s an issue 
because dropping it into a depth of 
more than one metre might be 
catastrophic even if it can be 
successfully retrieved.
As far as performance goes, the 
Armor A85 does what it says on its 
rather thick aluminium tin.
Summary
This isn’t the quickest external drive 
we’ve tested, but the Silicon Power 
Armor A85 is undeniably one of the 
toughest. If you’re taking a trip 
where data loss might result from 
dust or water penetration, then the 
Armor A85 is an affordable solution 
that can withstand plenty of 
punishment at your hands.
The only significant caveat is that 
the drive doesn’t float, so dropping 
it into anything other than shallow 
water could be its undoing without 
some kind of extra means of 
flotation being added.
The only other issue concerns the 
unusual twin-ended USB Type A 
cable, which could be difficult to 
replace if you lose it.  ■
A USB 3.0 portable drive that 
performs reasonably well, and 
under the toughest conditions.
gently curved aluminium tube and 
a rubber sleeve that isolates the 
drive from whatever is happening 
physically to the outer case.
The engineers also created a 
suspension system that isolates the 
external connector from the 
floating internal hard drive, an 
obvious point of potential failure.
Engineered in this fashion, the 
Armor A85 survived the MIL-STD 
810G Method 516.6 Procedure IV, 
aka the transit drop test. And 
Silicon Power’s promotional 
material claims it can withstand 
500kg of force, should something 
unfortunate happen to it.
As tempting as driving over the 
device a few times before 
benchmarking is, the three-year 
warranty and its ability to handle 
MIL-STD 810G convinced us that the 
Armor A85 is tough in more ways 
than just the looks department.
The transit drop test is to perform 
26 drops on each face, edge, and 
corner from a height of 122cm 
above the floor. And all those test 
drops can only be divided among 
five test items. The device must also 
survive a single 3m drop test and 
still be functional afterwards.
Having compliance to IP68 in this 
context means the device should 
be dust-proof and protected 
against immersion in water for 
more than 30 minutes at a depth of 
up to one metre.
A reasonable assumption for this 
test is that the immersion would 
take place with the USB cover in 
place, and therefore not connected 
to another device at the time.
The Armor A85 certainly talks the 
talk, but can it walk the walk?
Performance
Silicon Power has previously used 
Seagate’s Momentus hard drives in 
its products and we suspect that’s 
what’s inside here too.
We only got to test the 1TB 
model, but as mentioned 
previously, the same outer shell is 
used with a range of drives up to 
5TB. The only difference, other than 
the capacity, is that the larger 
versions are marginally heavier.
Performance isn’t SSD level, but 
it’s more than acceptable when 
compared with many portable 
drive solutions that use 
conventional drive technology.
In our benchmark tests, 
CrystalDiskMark rated the read 
speed at 119.3MB/s and the write 
speed at just a little less: 118.4MB/s. 
To achieve those levels you’ll need 
a USB 3.0 connection with USAP 
mode active – it should be natively 
on any Windows 8.x or Windows 10 
PC with the right hardware.

L
ooking at the tiny GoPro Hero6 
Black, it’s almost impossible to 
tell it apart from last year’s 
GoPro Hero5 Black. There are, 
however, plenty of noteworthy 
differences on the inside.
The new camera can capture 
super-slow-motion video at a high 
resolution, output a stabilised 
image in 4K, and transfer 
everything to your phone at faster 
speeds – your video can be posted 
before your GoPro-documented 
adventure is even over if you wish. 
It’s not perfect, of course. The 
problem with GoPro’s devices is 
that the image quality is more 
impressive than phones and other 
devices are capable of handling at 
times, thanks to huge file sizes.
It’s a big problem when you 
offload and edit the video, 
especially slow-motion footage at a 
silky-smooth 240 frames per 
second. You can find your phone 
and PC overwhelmed by the 
demands of GoPro video files.
That said, GoPro’s edit-in-post 
software is a lot better in 2017, so as 
long as you don’t feel in over your 
head transferring HD and 4K video 
files to your device this is the best 
action camera you can buy today
The biggest change to the Hero6 
Black is the arrival of GoPro’s first 
custom chipset, the aptly named 
GP1 processor. This enables the 
Hero6 Black to offer 4K video 
capture at a smooth 60 frames per 
second (fps); the Hero5 Black is only 
capable of shooting at 30fps. 
That’s not all. The Hero6 Black 
can capture 1080p Full HD footage 
at an impressive 240fps. In between 
those two extremes it’s possible to 
shoot 2.7K footage at 120fps.
GoPro hasn’t just concentrated 
on boosting the frame rate of the 
Hero6 Black over its predecessor, 
also tinkering with the image 
stabilisation system. Thanks to the 
GP1, it’s possible to have image 
stabilisation active while shooting 
4K footage. Stabilisation is capped 
at 30fps, but it’s a marked 
improvement over its Hero5 Black 
predecessor. Stabilisation is also 
possible at up to 120fps at Full HD. 
The Hero6 can also capture 12MP 
still images in single, burst and 
time-lapse modes. What’s new is a 
built-in HDR (High Dynamic Range) 
mode for high-contrast scenes. This 
replaces the Wide Dynamic Range 
mode on the Hero5 Black, and, 
again thanks to the GP1 processing 
engine, it captures images with 
greater detail in both the shadows 
and highlights. And, if you’re in the 
habit of venturing out after dark, 
Night mode is here for more 
accomplished low-light shooting.  
Build and handling
While there was quite a design shift 
from the Hero4 Black to the Hero5 
Black, the Hero6 Black doesn’t look 
any different from its predecessor. 
This action camera is as discreet as 
ever, it’s compact, feels extremely 
durable, and is waterproof (down to

GoPro’s best, most powerful action camera ever
84  |  
  |  Christmas 2017

GoPro footage has increasingly 
been a pain due to large file sizes, 
especially with older phones. GoPro 
is tackling this issue with a three-
pronged approach: First, the Hero6 
supports the High Efficiency Video 
Coding (HEVC) codec, which can 
halve file sizes, meaning it’ll save 
space on compatible phones, and 
make camera-to-phone transfers 
faster. Second, the Hero6 utilises 
the 5GHz wireless frequency, which 
can offer transfer speeds three 
times faster than the Hero5 could 
manage. We found transfer times 
were faster in our early testing. 
Third, QuikStories returns as a way 
to transfer and compile your 
footage into an automatic video 
collage, adding transitions and 
even music. The best part is that 
videos remain fully editable. 
Shooting video with your GoPro 
isn’t the hard part. Transferring 
hours of 4K 60fps video and 240fps 
super-slow motion-movies, though, 
can feel like a chore. The Hero6 
Black does a good job at chipping 
away at the workload. But we still 
find that offloading and editing 
camera footage takes practice.
Summary
The GoPro Hero6 Black instantly 
becomes the best action camera. 
At £500 ($500), though, the Hero6 
Black is £100 ($100) more than its 
now reduced-in-price predecessor.
Is slow-motion video worth the 
extra money? No, but improved 
image stabilisation, wider dynamic 
range and better low-light 
performance, plus faster transfer 
speeds and small file sizes are. ■
With huge improvements over its 
predecessor, the Hero6 Black is 
our new favourite action camera.
10m) without the need for a 
housing. The absence of a housing 
also means that with no casing 
getting in the way of the built-in 
mic, audio quality is better. 
It also comes with a sturdy plastic 
frame that allows for all sorts of fun 
camera mounts, while the entire 
design is incredibly tight, snuggly 
fitting the microSD card right up 
against the user-swappable battery.
The Hero6 Black has a 5.08cm 
touchscreen on the back for 
reviewing photos and videos, and 
adjusting settings, using what 
seems like the world’s tiniest 
touch-based user interface. You’d 
think this might be fiddly to use, 
but it’s not bad, with simple swipes 
and taps enough to access the 
settings and make changes.
If using the touchscreen is too 
much effort, the Hero6 also offers 
voice control. This isn’t enabled by 
default, but it’s easy to activate in 
the preferences menu, and you can 
then shout ‘GoPro start recording’, 
or ‘GoPro take a photo’ for the 
Hero6 to spring into action. There 
are 12 simple voice commands, 
covering pretty much everything 
you’re likely to want to do.
The Hero6 Black also has a new 
Wake On Voice function. Turn the 
camera off with a voice command 
and your Hero6 Black will switch off 
and run in low-power listening 
mode, waiting for the command 
‘GoPro turn on’. Leave it longer than 
eight hours and the Hero6 Black 
shuts down completely. 
Video and photo quality
The GoPro Hero6 Black is built for 
catching action incredibly fast and 
you’ll benefit from the enhanced 
performance if want to record 
video at ‘normal’ frame rates too. 
The image stabilisation has been 
beefed up, with footage slightly 
cropped to reduce shakiness. The 
effect is noticeable, but don’t throw 
away your GoPro Karma Grip, as 
software-based stabilisation can 
only correct so much.
Low-light performance has 
always been a GoPro shortcoming, 
but the Hero6 delivers improved 
dynamic range, thanks to its new 
processor, resulting in better image 
quality indoors and out.
Editing and apps
Raw support is welcome for still 
images, although because of the 
sensor’s small size don’t expect 
image quality to be any better than 
from a decent point-and-shoot 
compact. Nonetheless, it’s a handy 
feature to have.
The Hero6 takes uncompromised 
video, but offloading that raw

MESH NETWORKING
Mesh networking is the new hotness in Wi-Fi. Are  
you ready to take your network to the next level?
3 Ubiquiti Labs Amplifi HD
£360 (router & two nodes), amplify.com
Amplifi doesn’t expect you to reserve a 
precious surface in your home for a Wi-Fi 
module: its nodes are magnetically 
hinged onto plug sockets. Plug them in, 
angle them until the LEDs display the 
best signal, and you get nigh-invisible 
extension. The central router module – a 
neat cube with a circular touchscreen 
display – controls them all, offers an 
at-a-glance look at your network speeds 
(or a clock) and includes a four-port 
Gigabit switch. No dedicated 
interconnect radio means this isn’t the 
fastest combo, but the Amplifi HD is 
cheap and discrete.
.
1 Zyxel Multy X WSQ50
£249 (two nodes), zyxel.com
If you’re not a fan of the traditional 
router look, Zyxel’s heavy, wide white 
pebble of a device won’t float your boat. 
But these nodes have some serious tech 
inside, with an AC3000 radio 
combination that dedicates over half of 
that bandwidth to inter-device 
communication. Even at the furthest 
distance we could muster, the device pair 
communicated flawlessly with one 
another, though we hit the only set-up 
snag out of any of the mesh networking 
options in this test – the Multy refused 
set-up on our Android device, but 
worked fine on iOS.
2 Google Wifi
£229 (two nodes), store.google.com
Google’s marketing muscle fired up the 
mesh Wi-Fi revolution, and the Google 
Wifi itself doesn’t disappoint. Immensely 
simple to set up, it’s USB-C powered for 
maximum flexibility, looks cute and 
features two Gigabit Ethernet ports. 
Google Wifi does a great job at shaping 
traffic for top speeds while streaming or 
gaming, and effectively filled our home 
despite its relatively low-power AC1200 
signal. The accompanying app for 
Android and iOS is a masterwork, 
making keeping tabs on your network 
and configuring individual devices an 
absolute breeze.

6 Linksys Velop
£360 (three nodes), linksys.com/gb
Parental controls are a common feature 
on modern Wi-Fi devices, but few do it 
better than Linksys in its excellent 
Android/iOS app. Filtering by device, 
temporarily activating guest access, 
cutting out certain kinds of content – it’s 
easy. Set-up is similarly simple, just plug 
in, poke the app a little and go. Each unit 
packs a powerful AC2200 radio 
combination for an amazing signal, even 
when just running a pair of nodes. 
Adding an extra unit is costly, though, at 
an eye-watering £199, and three is 
probably overkill for the average 
two-storey home. 
4 TP-Link Deco M5
£229 (three nodes), tp-link.com
The Deco’s nodes, far squatter than 
Google’s with a twisty conical surface to 
discourage you from using them as a 
coaster, don’t have quite the same 
broadcast power as some of the others 
on test, although this three-node 
collection is cheaper than most 
two-node packages. The Deco’s nodes 
are simple to set up, with an Android/iOS 
app that offers a good slice of peace of 
mind: built-in traffic-sniffing anti-virus 
and web filtering, which you can activate 
and configure on groups of machines at 
once, gives supreme control over 
network activity.
5 BT Whole Home Wi-Fi
£199 (three nodes), shop.bt.com
Less flexible than other mesh systems 
– you can pause the whole network, but 
not disable it for particular devices, and 
there’s no kind of parental controls on 
board – BT’s Whole Home pack has its 
work cut out for it. But it’s a winner: at 
£100 less than its original launch price, 
it’s a real steal for a three-node setup 
with great signal strength and speed, a 
straightforward set-up process, and 
stand-up small footprint Wi-Fi discs, 
which tell you (and feed back to the free 
Android/iOS app) when they’ve been 
positioned poorly relative to each other, 
in different areas of your home. 
he days of the traditional 
router may be numbered. 
We all live in complex 
homes. We all have those 
corners that stubbornly refuse to 
give up a decent signal. And most of 
us have to put up with an awkwardly-
T
located central access point, which 
just makes solving the problem more 
difficult. There are options out 
there, such as powerline and Wi-Fi 
repeaters, but mesh networks do it 
better: they send signals between 
individual nodes, usually using a 
dedicated radio channel, meaning 
you can place them in those murky 
areas of your home that really need 
the boost. Still have wireless black 
spots? Then you can seamlessly add 
another. It’s easier, it’s faster and it’s 
all app-controlled.
