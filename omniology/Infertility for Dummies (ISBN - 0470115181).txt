About the Authors
Sharon Perkins has spent the last twenty years working as an RN, raising five
children and spoiling two grandchildren. Following her Air Force pilot hus-
band from state to state, she’s lived from Arizona to South Carolina, and still
enjoys traveling from Arizona to Texas to Michigan to Virginia to visit kids,
grandkids, and mom.
Sharon’s ambition to be a writer dates back to grade school, if not earlier, and
her desire to be a nurse (okay, she originally thought it would be nice to be a
doctor but changed her mind) goes back at least that far. Amazingly enough,
she found a way to combine nursing and writing in a way she would never
have dreamed possible, thanks to a patient (Jackie) with the persistence and
drive to make it happen.
Jackie Meyers-Thompson is managing partner of Coppock-Meyers Public
Relations/JD Thompson Communications Inc. and a “professional” fertility
patient (seeking “early retirement” however!) It’s been said that we make
plans . . . and the gods laugh. Jackie has heard that laughter often. It took her
longer than she expected, and yielded more than a few laughs, and tears,
before she met her husband-to-be, Darren Thompson. But by 35, she was
newly married and deliriously happy and felt that the rest of the story would
soon fall into place . . . Jackie can be a slow learner.
Nonetheless, she can also be an industrious worker. She loved writing and, as
a result, carved her path in marketing and public relations. She had a loving
husband and a successful business, so the only things left to add were a few
cherubic children and her own Great American Novel. Three years and a slew
of physicians later, Jackie had more than a few doubts whether her future
would ever include children. But her persistence and focus paid off. Infertility
For Dummies is, in part, Jackie’s story of the journey that landed her a book
and her beautiful baby daughter Ava Rose, who at 31/2, doesn’t want to be
called a baby anymore. When not writing, working, or watching her daughter
grow, Jackie spends her time making plans. Some things never change.

Dedication
From Sharon: To my father, who always thought I could do anything, and my
mother, who kept all our dreams alive.
From Jackie: This book is dedicated to my still wonderful and Darling
Husband (DH!), Darren Thompson, who has now added DF (Darling Father) 
to his ‘resume’ as well! And to Ava Rose Thompson, our long awaited child,
who reminds me daily of the miracles in life that so often come when you
least expect them.
Authors’ Acknowledgments
From Sharon: It’s hard to say thank you to everyone in the world, and yet
I feel I would have to thank everyone from third grade teachers to babies I
cared for in the NICU, because every one has taught me something useful 
and helped me become who I am today--both a nurse and a writer! 
So I’ll settle for thanking my family, including children, husband, in-laws, sis-
ters, brothers, nieces, nephews and of course my grandchildren. I can’t leave
out my friends, work buddies, and every patient I’ve ever cared for, as well as
my church family and various writing groups who have been supportive and
encouraging over the years. And, last but not least, Jackie — for having the
vision and optimism to see that we really could accomplish this, even when we
hardly knew each other outside of the nurse-patient relationship. Without her,
I never would have tried this, and we’ve long since left the nurse-patient thing
behind for genuine friendship. To quote St. Paul, “I thank God for all of you.”
From Jackie: I don’t believe I would have gotten to this point had it not been
for the wonderful care and treatment that I received through Dr. Jerome Check
and the Cooper Center for In Vitro Fertilization in Marlton, New Jersey. It was
also at the Cooper Clinic that I met Sharon Perkins. Her humor, caring, and
expertise make her as great a nurse as they do a writer and most importantly
a friend. 
I have so much to be grateful for in the support of family and friends. Cousin
Sandy searched and researched and learned as much about fertility as his
own field of medicine in helping us through the maze of doctors and proto-
cols. My mother Larissa Meyers who helped us through the highs and lows in
every way she knew how along with the rest of our families, the Thompsons,
the Jaffes, the Cicecklis, and the Perlsteins. To my friends Melissa, Camille,

Courtenay, Susan, Leslie, Irene, Erin, Liz, Judy, Donna, Patty, Angie, Cheron,
Leora, Margaret and Maureen, who were there for me during some of the
most difficult and glorious times, unfailing in their encouragement and
always providing a shoulder to cry on or a voice to laugh with.
In the writing of this book, a number of professionals became friends as 
well. Jennifer R. Bloome, founder and president of Anji, Inc. and The Anji
Connection, provided me with great insight into the power of mind and 
body when trying to conceive. To Rachel Glasser who listened and helped 
me learn. To Lisa, Evan, Dan and all the great folks at Follas Laboratories 
who celebrated every good result with me. 
And a special thanks to Dr. Garry Cutting and his staff at Johns Hopkins
University who gave their time and expertise when we hit another brick in
the wall during our efforts to conceive. Thanks as well to Dr. Martin Schwarz,
who became a friend and great source of information on the ‘other side of the
pond’ and Steven Keiles and Dr. Luke Padwick, who helped provide us with
some crucial pieces to our puzzle.
From both of us: Wiley took a chance on us six years ago, and we thank
you all for your faith in us and your support. Our acquisitions editor
Lindsay Lefever’s enthusiasm for this book was infectious; our project
editor, Jen Connolly, has been a pleasure to work with. 
Immense thanks to Dr. Richard Paulson, who has been a marvelous source of
information and guidance for this book; he kept our hyperbole under control
and made sure we had our facts straight!

Infertility For Dummies 
xx

Introduction
I
nfertility is a medical problem for more than 7.2 million Americans, yet
insurance companies often deny that it’s a disease, many people (the “just
relax and you’ll get pregnant” crowd) don’t understand its biological origins,
and a few (the “take this magic pill and you’ll get pregnant, guaranteed!” group)
even exploit those suffering from it. If you’re dealing with infertility, you may
feel alone, confused and depressed over the potential loss of the dream you
cherished since childhood: the dream of having a baby of your own.
There is good news on the infertility front, however; not only are medical
treatments for infertility making great gains, but there’s also more awareness
of the emotional effects of infertility.
Infertility For Dummies was conceived by combining Jackie’s knowledge of
infertility from a patient’s viewpoint, Sharon’s wealth of information as an
infertility nurse, and both of their personal experiences. We wrote this book
so that patients dealing with infertility will know that they’re not alone.
We hope it finds its way to the bookshelves and nightstands of all the
patients who need it to help find their road to their baby. And, as Sharon
and Jackie found out along the way, anything can happen!
About This Book
This book is our attempt to help those of you who want to walk into the
doctor’s office and not walk out feeling foolish and out of control of your fer-
tility. Our vision is to provide fertility patients — both those at the starting
line and those close to the finish — and the people who love them, with as
much information as we can on the options available to them. We discuss
topics ranging from the scientific to the spiritual. 
You can read through this book from front to back and feel confident that you
can find the answer to just about any fertility issue, from natural family plan-
ning to cloning. But if you’re like most people, you’ll probably look through the
Table of Contents, zero in on the chapters that affect you, and jump directly
to them. This book is meant as a resource, which means that you can go back
to it whenever a new issue or question arises and find the answer you need
without reading through everything that comes before. This book is meant
for people with every degree of fertility expertise, from the novice to the jaded,
been-there-done-that patient. The no-tech and low-tech fertility chapters come
first, so you can skip them if you’re already a veteran and move right into high-
tech and really high-tech stuff found in the second half of the book.

We intersperse personal stories throughout the book; these (we hope!) make
interesting reading from the viewpoint of either Sharon (an infertility nurse)
or Jackie (an infertility patient). If you skip them, you won’t miss any essen-
tial information, although you may miss a few humorous sidelines or “I did it,
so you can too” stories.
Conventions Used in This Book
To help you pick out information from a page, we use the following conventions
throughout the text to make elements consistent and easy to understand; the
last thing we want to do is confuse you!
 Any Web addresses appear in monofont.
 New terms appear in italics and are closely preceded or followed by an
easy-to-understand definition.
 Bold highlights the keywords in bulleted lists.
 Sidebars, which look like text enclosed in a shaded gray box, consist of
information that’s interesting to know but not necessarily critical to
your understanding of the topic.
What You’re Not to Read
We think every word in this book is interesting and educational, but we under-
stand that sometimes you just need a quick answer to a burning question.
Other times you want to discover everything possible about infertility, even
the technical stuff. We’ve designated some information as interesting-but-not-
essential-to-read. Feel free to read it, but if you skip it, you’re not missing 
anything vital. Optional sections are:
 Text in sidebars: Shaded boxes that appear throughout the book. The
information they contain may be anything from personal stories to tech-
nical information. The common denominator is that the information isn’t
essential to understanding or dealing with endometriosis.
 Anything with a Technical Stuff icon attached: This information is
interesting, but not essential — unless you’re planning on doing your
doctorate thesis on endometriosis. (For more information on icons,
check out “Icons Used in This Book” later in this Introduction.)
 The stuff on the copyright page: The attorneys require that we have
this information. Unless you’re an aspiring lawyer, feel free to skip it.

Infertility For Dummies 

Foolish Assumptions
We assume that you’re reading this book because you want to know more
about infertility and because, despite your hopes to the contrary, you and/or
a loved one, are dealing with infertility on one level or another, be it your first
child or your fifth. We also assume that you want to:
 Understand the biologic causes of infertility 
 Discover what you can do to overcome infertility, from proper timing to
changing underwear!
 Be up-to-date on the latest medical and surgical treatments for infertility
 Learn about high tech options for conception
 Pursue options for parenthood if the traditional roads fail you, from
donor egg to use of a surrogate
Infertility is not the end of the road, or the end of your dream of parenthood.
There is help available, and we’re here to help you find the resources you
need, whether your infertility issues are simple to solve or complex.
How This Book is Organized
Infertility For Dummies is divided into six parts. As with every For Dummies
book, this one is designed to help you find the information you need quickly
and easily, without having to read the book cover to cover. The following
explanations can help you find the information you need with a minimum of
effort.
Part I: Are We There Yet? Wondering 
Why You’re Not Pregnant
If you’re a newcomer to the wonderful world of baby making, we suggest that
you start reading here. In this part, we explain male and female anatomy
(including everything you ever wanted to know about reproductive organs),
look at the logistics of getting pregnant, and review behaviors you should
change — or not — before trying to get pregnant.
3
Introduction

Part II: Stepping Up Your Efforts 
This part helps you fine-tune your conception efforts by using methods to
predict ovulation and helps you understand how complicated getting preg-
nant, whether infertility is involved . . . or not, really is. We also guide you
through your initial gynecology visits for simple infertility treatment. Next we
take a look at some alternative approaches to pregnancy, from herbs to
acupuncture, discuss the special issue of secondary infertility, and last but
not least, help you avoid the emotional pitfalls that can be the most painful
part of infertility. 
Part III: Asking for Directions: 
Finding the Problem
This part explains the tests you may be doing to find out why you haven’t
gotten pregnant yet; we explain what the tests are and what the results may
mean. We also give male factor issues a chapter of their own. We give you
information about miscarriage; why it occurs and what you can do emotion-
ally and physically to overcome recurrent miscarriage. 
Part IV: Moving Up to 
High-Tech Conception
This part explains what high-tech infertility treatments are, from injections to
in vitro fertilization. We guide you through the complicated maze of finding
the right clinic and take you through the stimulation process and the egg
retrieval itself. We visit the embryology lab after your egg retrieval and give
advice on how to get through the “two week wait” for your pregnancy test
without losing your mind. We also discuss the dollars and cents of infertility,
what different processes may cost, and how to maximize your funds, your
insurance, and your resources.
Part V: The Road Less Traveled . . . So Far!
In this part, we look at nontraditional families and methods of conception,
including donor egg and surrogacy. We also help you decide when “enough is
enough” and discuss the possible alternatives to biological parenthood.
Finally, we peer into the future for a look at what’s on the horizon for infertil-
ity treatment.

Part VI: The Part of Tens
Want to know the ten most annoying things people say when you’re trying to
get pregnant? Want to know where to find fertility medications for reasonable
prices and find out exactly what a gonadotropin is? Need to navigate your
way through an infertility chat board? Then this is the part for you.
Icons Used in This Book
Icons are the strange-looking symbols that appear occasionally in the mar-
gins next to the text. We include them to let you know that a topic or informa-
tion is special in some way. Infertility For Dummies includes the following
icons:
This icon identifies information that’s helpful and can save you time or 
trouble.
This icon highlights key points in the section you’re reading.
This icon stresses information that describes potentially serious issues, such
as side effects to medication or other dangerous problems. Pay attention to
warnings — they can keep you out of trouble!
This icon signals information that’s interesting but not essential to under-
standing endometriosis, unless you’re a scientist or medical student.
If either of us has a personal story that is funny, informative, inspirational, or
otherwise interesting, we identify it with the Personal Story icon. These anec-
dotes are never essential reading, but they’re usually entertaining!
Where to Go from Here
If we’d written the great American novel, we’d want you to start at Chapter 1
and read straight through. But it’s not a novel, and it’s not a textbook, where
each chapter builds on the one before. You can open this book at any point
and be able to understand the information there.
5
Introduction

The early chapters of this book deal with infertility issues that can be solved
fairly easily, like timing. If you don’t have a basic understanding of human
biology, Chapter 2 can help you understand the complexity of the human
reproductive system. On the other hand, if the emotional aspects of
infertility are impacting your relationships, Chapter 9 may be more what
you need to read.
The point is, you don’t have to read everything (although you certainly can,
and you may discover something you never knew before)! Just flip to the
Table of Contents or index, find a subject that interests you, and turn to that
chapter. It’s not essential to read everything — just what interests you and
helps you.
Infertility For Dummies is a resource, a guide that presents the practical infor-
mation in a fun, easy-to-read-and-understand format. Read a chapter a day or
a chapter a year, or keep it in the bathroom for frequent browsing. But how-
ever you choose to use this book, we hope it’s helpful.

Are We There Yet?
Wondering Why
You’re Not Pregnant

In this part . . .
I
f you’re a newcomer to the wonderful world of baby
making, we suggest that you start reading here. In this
part, we explain male and female anatomy (including every-
thing you ever wanted to know about reproductive organs),
look at the logistics of getting pregnant, and review behav-
iors you should change — or not — before trying to get
pregnant.

Chapter 1
Where, Oh Where, 
Can My Baby Be? 
In This Chapter
 Understanding infertility
 Exploring the odds of getting pregnant
 Researching your family tree
 Adding up the costs of infertility
 Realizing why getting pregnant can be hard today
I
f you’re reading this book, the odds are good that you want to have a baby.
You may actually have been trying to have a baby for a while without suc-
cess, and maybe you’re becoming frustrated, annoyed, and a little scared —
are you ever going to have the family you’ve dreamed of?
We want to help make this process easier for you — less stressful and more
successful. In this chapter, we tell you the official definition of infertility (it may
surprise you!), show you statistics on infertility today, show you how to shake
your family tree for genetic problems and talk about the cost of infertility —
the emotional cost as well as the monetary cost.
Defining Infertility
Infertility as defined by the experts may surprise you. According to guidelines
established by infertility specialists, you’re not considered to be infertile
until you’ve been trying to get pregnant for one year, if you’re under age 35.
That means that trying to get pregnant last week and not having signs of
pregnancy this week does not mean that you’re infertile.

However, since the modern world is one of immediate gratification, it can be
hard — if not downright impossible — to try to get pregnant for a full year
without getting impatient, discouraged, or just plain panicked. There’s noth-
ing wrong with going to see your gynecologist to talk about why you’re not
getting pregnant after just a few months; in fact, your co-authors, being fairly
impatient people themselves, would consider you to be a candidate for saint-
hood if you could wait a year without talking to your doctor. One year is,
however, the official definition.
Infertility in America — 
Looking at the Statistics
Most women know that the older you get, the harder it is to get pregnant. But
what about race, socioeconomic status, geography and heredity as fertility
factors? In the next sections we look at how infertility affects different
groups.
Making babies: An inefficient 
process at best 
You may think of Mother Nature as a pretty efficient woman, but the truth is,
the path to pregnancy is an inefficient one even under the best of circum-
stances. For example, out of 100 couples under the age of 35 trying to con-
ceive, only 20 will get pregnant in any given month, and of those 20, 3 will
miscarry. In other words, if you’re under 35, every month you have a 17 per-
cent chance of walking out of the maternity ward with a baby nine months
later. Obviously, nature is not as efficient as people think.
Looking at 100 women under age 35 trying to get pregnant, the breakdown
will look like this:
 80 will be pregnant within one year
 10 more will be pregnant after two years of trying without medical 
intervention.
 10 won’t get pregnant without some help from the medicine man. 
High-tech infertility treatments, such as in vitro fertilization, claim a suc-
cess rate of about 50 percent for those under age 35, which means 5 out
of 100 women will not become pregnant, even with medical intervention.
10
Part I: Are We There Yet? Wondering Why You’re Not Pregnant 

Age and infertility
If you’re over 35, you’re in good company; 20 percent of all first-time moms in
the United States are over 35! Despite this, Mother Nature doesn’t make it easy
to get pregnant past age 35. (We look more at age and infertility in Chapter 6.)
For example:
 By your late thirties, 10 percent will get pregnant in any given month and
17 percent of those will miscarry.
 If you’re over 40, the pregnancy rate, per month, slips to 5 percent, with
34 percent of those miscarrying.
 By age 45, your chance per month of conceiving is less than 1 percent,
and 53 percent of those will miscarry.
Race and infertility
Does your racial background affect your chance for pregnancy? There is a
slight difference in infertility rates, with Hispanic women under 35 experienc-
ing a 7 percent infertility rate, Caucasians a 6.4 percent infertility rate, and
African American women recording a 10.5 percent rate of infertility. These dif-
ferences could be due to socioeconomic factors, such as poverty, poor nutri-
tion, or lack of physician care, rather than strictly racial issues.
High-tech treatments and infertility
If you’re already frantically reading your insurance booklet and shaking the
piggy bank in hopes of finding a few spare thousand dollars to pay for high
tech infertility treatments, you might take comfort in the following statistic:
only around 3 percent of infertile couples end up doing high tech treatment
like in vitro fertilization IVF) to get pregnant. (You can find everything you
need to know about IVF in Chapters 15 to 18.)
Shaking Down the Family Tree
It may seem silly to look to your family tree for signs of infertility that could
be inherited; after all, you’re here, so how could your parents have had fertil-
ity issues?
Putting together a family birth history
Most of us don’t ask our parents about their road to parenthood until we’re
trying to become parents ourselves. But you might be surprised to learn that
11
Chapter 1: Where, Oh Where, Can My Baby Be?

it took your parents a number of years to have you or your siblings. It’s also
possible that people in your family tree may be adopted or the product of
artificial insemination, issues that often weren’t discussed a few decades ago.
While family lines who are completely infertile tend to die out in a generation
(for obvious reasons), some families may be sub-fertile, with less than aver-
age sperm counts or ovulation issues, and still manage to have a child or two. 
Ask the most talkative member of your family for a family “birth history.” You
may be surprised what you learn. And remember, sometimes a vehement
denial, such as “there’s never been any problem in our family,” may be a clue
to dig a little deeper and find out why everyone is so defensive.
Finding out important information
Researching your family history can provide valuable information. For exam-
ple, you may learn of family genetic tendencies that could cause problems 
on your own reproductive road. Or you may find out that everyone in your
family took six months to get pregnant, a fact that may put your mind at ease,
particularly around month number five of trying without success.
Before trying to get pregnant, you’ll want to know whether any diseases
occur more than once on your family tree. This disease may be caused by a
dominant gene that you could pass on, if you carry it, even if your partner
doesn’t carry it. Depending on how open your family is, finding out this infor-
mation can be difficult. Many families don’t discuss anything related to preg-
nancy, especially not problems getting pregnant, pregnancy losses, or genetic
defects. Just a few generations ago, parents of children with genetic abnor-
malities were encouraged to put them in a home and tell the relatives the
baby had been stillborn.
If your family tree does hold a genetic problem or a birth defect that shows
up more than once, you’ll probably want to have genetic testing done. A gene
map, which can be done from a blood test, will show whether you carry
abnormal genes that could cause problems for your child.
Sometimes the only thing you learn from family records is nonspecific, such
as “all the Smith boys died young.” Try and pin down why they all died
young: Did they have hemophilia or muscular dystrophy, or did they all fall
out of the same apple tree?
You may also want to ask your mother whether she took any pills during her
pregnancy, or whether her doctor gave her anything to prevent miscarriage.
Women whose mothers took DES, a synthetic estrogen hormone, to help pre-
vent miscarriage may have a T-shaped uterus, which may make it difficult to
carry a pregnancy. Almost 5 million women were given DES by their doctors
12
Part I: Are We There Yet? Wondering Why You’re Not Pregnant 

between 1938 and 1971, and as many as 50 percent of their daughters may
have infertility issues related to DES exposure. Studies are now beginning to
be done on problems that affect DES sons and their fertility. The following
male problems may be linked to DES:
 Varicocele: An enlarged vein in the testicles that can affect sperm 
production
 Undescended testicles: Testicles that fail to descend into the scrotum
 Hypospadias: A misplacement of the opening on the end of the penis
Don’t be too hard on Mom for not telling you everything. Many women aren’t
even aware that they took DES until their children enter their reproductive
years and begin experiencing problems. Asking the doctor what was in the
pills he gave you wasn’t something many women did in the 1950s and 1960s.
If you and your partner are blood relatives, it is especially important to see a
genetic counselor before getting pregnant. You may carry more of the same
abnormal genes than unrelated partners would, which may make you more
likely to have a child with a genetic problem. The risk for serious birth
defects is 1 in 20 for second cousins and 1 in 11 for first cousins.
Checking the stats of your race
Even if you’re not aware of genetic illnesses in your family, certain populations
tend towards specific issues. For example, while sickle cell anemia occurs in
1 of 8 African Americans, cystic fibrosis can be found in 1 out of 26 Caucasians
and at an even higher percentage among Ashkenazi Jews. Other diseases such
as Tay-Sachs and Gaucher are also prevalent among the Jewish population.
Many OB/GYNs suggest screening for the most likely diseases based on your
heritage. It doesn’t hurt to get this done before you become pregnant. While
many genetic diseases are recessive, meaning that both parents must carry
the gene in order for the baby to develop the disease itself, should you turn
up to be a carrier, your partner can be tested right away. If both you and your
partner are carriers, each child from your union holds a 25 percent chance of
inheriting both genes and thus the disease. Fifty percent of your children will
be carriers of the disease and twenty-five percent will not have or carry the
disease. 
Remember, these are all statistical numbers. Some families where both parents
carry a recessive gene disorder have multiple children in a row who have the
disease, despite the 25 percent odds per child. Other families don’t. Statistics
are based on large numbers of people and the likelihood of any one event
occurring. You and your family may fall into the statistical pattern or not. 
13
Chapter 1: Where, Oh Where, Can My Baby Be?

In the case of diseases such as cystic fibrosis, just because you don’t see evi-
dence in your family tree doesn’t mean it isn’t there. Eighty percent of fami-
lies who give birth to a child affected with cystic fibrosis have never had an
incidence of the disease in their family. That’s because recessive disorders
require two carriers in order to produce the disease in their offspring. Even if
two carriers do reproduce, there is still only a 25 percent chance per child
that any given baby will have the disease itself. Thus, carrier status can be
passed along for generations without ever showing up as the disease itself.
Testing is the only way to know for sure.
If you do uncover a “bad” or questionable gene through testing, don’t panic.
This is the reason for testing in the first place. Before you make out a will or
go hunting down your mother, father, or great-great-aunt to give them a piece
of your mind, remember this:
 Not all gene mutations are disease causing. Some are merely benign
changes. These differences are what make us all unique individuals.
 If you’re a carrier of a recessive genetic disorder, you’re carrying only
one gene and will not get the disease. You’re simply a potential conduit.
What Causes Infertility?
Infertility has many causes, and figuring out which applies to you may be
very simple — or very difficult. Although women used to bear the brunt of

The good news about inherited diseases
When it comes to inherited diseases, you have
options your grandmother and mother never
did. You can receive pre-pregnancy genetic
counseling or have early pregnancy testing of
the fetus for abnormalities. Your grandmother,
who may have had children well into her 40s,
was more likely to have a baby born with chro-
mosomal abnormalities. Such problems are
more common in women over 35, and there was
no way to test for them during pregnancy in ear-
lier generations. Your mother may have been
afraid to have more than one child if she knew
there was a family history of cystic fibrosis or
muscular dystrophy. The problem that your aunt
had during pregnancy from an inherited bleed-
ing disorder is now a condition that can be diag-
nosed and treated during pregnancy, increasing
your chances of having a healthy full-term baby.
Rh factors may have caused fetal death just two
generations ago, but they can now be easily
prevented by an injection of RhoGAM, which
prevents the growing fetus from having its blood
cells attacked in utero.

blame for infertility, the truth is that male and female factors share equally in
infertility. Consider the following statistics:
 One third of infertility is caused by female factors
 One third of infertility is caused by male factors
 Around 20 percent of infertility is unexplained
 Around 10 to 15 percent of infertility is caused by a combination of male
and female factors
Among women, the main causes of infertility are:
 Ovulatory disorders — no ovulation or irregular ovulation
 Tubal disorders — blocked or infected tubes
 Uterine issues — fibroids, polyps or adhesions
For men the most common causes of infertility are:
 Low sperm count
 Decreased sperm motility
 Abnormally shaped sperm
 No sperm at all in the ejaculate
Each of theses categories of infertility can be caused by a number of things;
for example, a decreased sperm count can be caused by a disease such as
diabetes, by a birth defect, or by trauma. A woman can have blocked tubes
from endometriosis, pelvic inflammatory disease, or from a congenital malfor-
mation. Anovulation can be caused by polycystic ovarian syndrome, prema-
ture ovarian failure, or by over-exercising. While it may be fairly obvious what
the problem is, finding the reason for the problem may be more difficult.
Diagnosing Infertility
You may think this is a no-brainer: If you’re not getting pregnant, it seems like
you’ve already diagnosed yourself with infertility! However, diagnosing a lack
of pregnancy is the easy part; figuring out why you’re not getting pregnant is
the hard part.
After reading through Chapter 5, which discusses simple techniques for
increasing your pregnancy odds, or Chapter 10, which explains some of the
tests used to diagnose infertility, of this book, you may be able to diagnose
15
Chapter 1: Where, Oh Where, Can My Baby Be?

the reason for your difficulty in getting pregnant without any help from your
doctor. For example, you might be having sex at the wrong time of the month —
your “infertility issue” may be solved with a calendar, a thermometer and
an ovulation predictor kit! Or you may not have realized how irregular your
periods were — 35 days apart one month, 40 the next, 60 the next — maybe
you’re not ovulating on a regular basis.
Your gynecologist can run a few simple blood tests to help determine whether
or not you’re ovulating. Ovulation is, after all, the first step in getting pregnant,
and usually blood tests or observation of your own cervical mucus and tem-
perature (see Chapter 4 for ways to figure this out) can help you figure out
when you’re ovulating so you can time sex accordingly.
If you’re still not pregnant after six months of “hitting the mark,” it’s time for
more testing; your doctor may suggest a test to see if your tubes are open
and testing on your partner to see if “his boys can swim.”
This process of looking for the problem and then seeing if it’s fixed can take a
few months. Only 20 percent of infertile couples never have a definite answer
to why they can’t get pregnant, so the odds are your favor.
Getting Pregnant: More Difficult 
Today than Yesterday?
Sometimes things seemed easier in Grandma’s day. Large families were
common, and it appeared that everyone had children. In fact, getting preg-
nant may be harder today, for several reasons:
 People are having children later in life. Over age 25, there is a slight
but definite decrease in fertility in women, a decrease that increases dra-
matically over age 35. Men are also less fertile at older ages.
 Due to better medical management, people are living longer and get-
ting pregnant (or trying to) despite the presence of serious chronic
disease, such as diabetes or lupus. In the past, just the presence of
these conditions would have precluded the possibility of pregnancy.
 Male infertility, related to decreased sperm counts, has increased.
Many theories circulate as to why this is occurring, with environmental
factors being carefully studied.
 The incidence of sexually transmitted diseases has increased. Some of
these diseases, such as chlamydia, cause serious damage to the repro-
ductive organs.
16
Part I: Are We There Yet? Wondering Why You’re Not Pregnant 

 More men and women have had either a vasectomy or a tubal ligation
at a young age and then decided to have another child. Needless to
say, they immediately face fertility issues due to their previous choices.
 It may seem as if everyone had children years ago, but start asking
questions and you’ll get a different story. You may find out that Uncle
Charlie wasn’t really Aunt Jo’s son; he was her sister’s child, whom she
raised after his mother died young, and on and on. Everyone may have
been raising children, but many of those children may have been
extended family members.
 People today talk more. Just because you never heard about your
grandmother’s stillborns or your mother’s miscarriages doesn’t mean
they didn’t happen. Pregnancy talk today is big business, and everyone
in the world seems to be in the news talking about their babies, lack of
babies, adopted babies, and how they got pregnant. This focus puts a
constant in-your-face emphasis on pregnancy. It also makes you feel,
when you’re trying to get pregnant, like everyone else is doing it — and
doing it better than you are!
Relax, this is only the beginning for you, and we do our best to help you start
baby making with the best of them.
Calculating the Cost of Infertility
Infertility costs a lot. We’re not just talking money here; the emotional toll is
usually much higher and longer lasting than any hit to your pocketbook. In
the next sections, we look at the costs of infertility on your self esteem, your
marriage, and last of all (because it’s really the least important) on your wallet.
The emotional costs of infertility
Infertility is not for the faint of heart. Will it test your mental, physical and
spiritual strength? Um, possibly. Will you come out a better person than
before? No guarantee, but as with all of life’s challenges, the better prepared
you are going in, the more likely your psyche is to survive and thrive. 
In this book, we discuss a lot about support, be it your partner, friends, family,
professionals, or online networks. It doesn’t matter in what shape it comes,
everyone needs a little help from their friends, no matter who those friends
may be. 
17
Chapter 1: Where, Oh Where, Can My Baby Be?

You might decide to let just a few close confidantes know of your situation
with trying to conceive. You might tell anyone who will listen. Regardless,
know that at some point, someone will say something wrong. Set the ground
rules now. If you don’t want to be asked how things are going (secret speak
for “Are you pregnant yet?”), tell your network up front that you will let them
know when there is something to know. Their over-enthusiasm may annoy
you time and again, but they are probably almost as excited as you are to
hear about your success. 
While you don’t want to anticipate a long, arduous battle with your fertility,
or lack thereof, don’t set yourself up to expect that within a month you’ll be
shopping online for maternity clothes. Decorating the baby’s room at this
point is probably not a great idea either. If all goes well and success finds you
early, that’s great . . . and we promise you that you’ll have plenty of time to
find the perfect maternity wardrobe and baby collection. If not, you will only
set yourself up for disappointment, and the goal is to keep that to a minimum
as best you can, in the areas over which you do have control. Your thinking is
one of them. 
And it’s not just you!
Whether the infertility issues are yours, your partner’s, or something you
share, be certain that you most likely will share the ups and downs of baby
making. Infertility is tough on the most resilient of individuals and couples.
It will find the weak spots in you and your relationship. Steady yourself and
your union for what could be turbulent waters ahead (this includes success
and a new baby!).
When it comes to baby making, sooner is often better than later, but keep in
mind that this is from a biological perspective. And although you may hear
the biological clock ticking away, ready-or-not is not the best way to make
your decision about when to conceive. The state of your union is an issue we
revisit throughout this book, as it is one of the most important aspects in
dealing with fertility, infertility, and baby makes three (or more). And although
biology is a key issue in deciding when and if you’re ready to conceive, matu-
rity, financial security, and stability are equally important, whether your 
challenge is trying to get pregnant or trying to raise said baby in a difficult
and expensive world.
The quality of your partnership is the foundation for your family. Take the
time to make sure that it’s solid before moving on to the next level. Re-visit it
often to make sure it’s staying secure through the ups and downs of trying to
conceive.
18
Part I: Are We There Yet? Wondering Why You’re Not Pregnant 

Just keep talking! As with all other areas, communication is key in the deci-
sion to add on to your family, whether you’re successful right away or not. 
If you find yourselves at an impasse, enlist the help of an outside party: a
member of the clergy, a therapist, or a physician to help you sort out feelings
and facts.
The costs of treatment
Talk about rubbing salt on a wound. Infertility treatments can be difficult
enough. Now throw in the “opportunity” to spend anywhere from a few hun-
dred to tens of thousands of dollars, and you have the makings for a truly
bitter pill.
Like everything, infertility costs vary and can depend on where you live,
which physician/practice you see and most importantly, whether your treat-
ment is small, medium, or large. 
When you’re starting out, expect to pay $10 to $15 for an ovulation predictor
kit and about the same for home pregnancy kits. A basal body thermometer
will run you about $10 to $20. This is the easy stuff. We haven’t brought in the
professionals yet.
What about insurance you ask? “What about it?” we answer. Only 15 states
have mandated coverage for infertility, meaning that for those who aren’t for-
tunate enough to live in one of these areas, infertility treatments are paid for
out of pocket . . . yours that is. Even if you have insurance coverage, you may
be amazed to see how little of your bill is covered. Some insurance plans cover
only monitoring, meaning the frequent blood draws and ultrasounds. Because
these can run well over $2,000 per cycle, this coverage is a help. Other plans
cover only the medications, which is a help, but not by any means relief from
the total cost.
Many insurance plans, however, will cover the tests and procedures related
to diagnosing your particular infertility problem. This can be very helpful as
well because many cases of infertility require blood work, ultrasound, and
even exploratory surgical procedure, to determine a cause for infertility . . .
a mere starting point for treatment. This generally applies to both you and
your partner, but double-check this with your insurance company prior to
signing up for the “party platter” of tests.
Once diagnosed, and even if you escape diagnosis (20 percent of infertility is
unexplained), that’s when the real costs can kick in. Should your problem be
resolved quickly and easily, you may get by with the cost of a few months’
worth of Clomid (a pill that causes super ovulation in order to push your
19
Chapter 1: Where, Oh Where, Can My Baby Be?

ovaries into producing one or more follicles that can be fertilized), a few ultra-
sounds (which generally cost anywhere from $200 to $500 depending on where
you live and which physician practice you frequent) and approximately $200
per blood draw for the basic tests needed to monitor your cycle. If you need IUI
(Intrauterine Insemination), the cost is generally $500 per insemination. 
If you are to be monitored via blood work and ultrasound throughout the
month, some clinics offer “package” prices which can range from $900 to
$1500 for blood work and ultrasounds for one month. 
If your cycle require injectable gonadotropins (Repronex, Follistim, Gonal F to
name a few), you are looking at a cost of $50 per vial. Most of these drugs are
sold in five-vial boxes, although some are available in larger multidose con-
tainers. You could use as few as one vial per day for 5 to 10 days of your cycle
or as many as six vials per day for 12 days. It all depends on your issues, pro-
tocol, physician, and response.
If you are also adding in luteal support (which occurs after the egg has suppos-
edly been fertilized), progesterone and estrogen may run you a few hundred
dollars per cycle (a bargain compared to other costs!). 
Keep in mind that these are all approximate costs. Later on in the book, we
discuss places to purchase medications that may offer better deals and other
methods that you can use to cut your costs.
If you move up to the big time, keep in mind that the average IVF cycle costs
between $8,000 and $15,000. Of that, about $4,000 to $5,000 is spent on med-
ication, and another $4,000 to $10,000 goes to your clinic.
But, for now, let’s take it one step at a time. You’ve bought this book and if you
get pregnant from the information you find here, consider it a great bargain!

In This Chapter
 Taking a refresher course in male and female anatomy
 Understanding your menstrual cycle
 Getting into your genes
 Revealing the mysteries of sex
You may think that you know how to get pregnant. Doesn’t everybody?
Not necessarily! In this chapter, we review basic male and female biol-
ogy, educate you on the inner workings of your menstrual cycle, and teach
you about sex and conception. Then we peer into your genes — what they
are, how they affect you and your future child, and what scientists currently
know about them.
Biology 101: Reviewing Male and
Female Anatomy
Were you paying attention in Biology 101? You may have taken a quick peek
at the film on the miracle of birth and announced loudly to all your friends,
“Eww, gross, I’m never having kids!” And yet here you are, some undisclosed
number of years later, wishing you had paid more attention back then. Don’t
worry; we’re here to fill in the gaps in your reproductive education.
The human body has the basics and the accessories — just like at Macy’s!
When you buy an outfit, you can be dressed with just the basics, but the
accessories really pull your outfit together. When you’re trying to have a
baby, the parts that you don’t see — the “accessories” —determine whether
you can get pregnant.

Looking at the female accessories
(besides shoes)
A naked woman is pretty unrevealing, from a reproductive viewpoint. You
can’t see the organs that count in childbearing, so you can’t tell at a glance
whether yours are present and functioning. Take a look at what should be
inside every woman, starting from the outside and working your way up.
(See Figure 2-1.)
The vagina
The vagina mostly serves as a passageway, first for the penis to deliver
sperm up near the opening of the uterus, and later for the delivery of the
baby. If you have a very small vaginal opening, intercourse may be uncom-
fortable. If your vaginal opening is large, as it may be after having a baby, sex
may be less pleasurable. Neither condition, however, will have any effect on
your ability to get pregnant.
The vagina secretes fluid during sexual arousal, making it easier — and a lot
more enjoyable! — for a penis to enter the vagina. Sometimes, (especially
when you have to have sex at a particular time), the lubrication function may
not work as well as it should. In these cases, you may need a personal lubricant.
This is much better for your vagina than trying to have a “dry experience,”
which causes abrasion of the vagina, and will make intercourse that much
more uncomfortable the next time.

Part I: Are We There Yet? Wondering Why You’re Not Pregnant 

Some women are born without a vagina; usually the uterus is also missing in
these women. The formal name of this syndrome is Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser-
Mayer, and it’s the second most common cause of amenorrhea, or lack of
periods starting by age 16. This condition is usually diagnosed when you
don’t start your periods by age 16.
Found at the entrance to the vagina, the hymen is a nonfunctional piece of cir-
cular tissue; the bleeding many women have the first time they have sex comes
from the tearing of the hymen. The hymen is not a solid piece of tissue; 99 per-
cent of baby girls already have openings, or perforations, in the hymen. An
imperforate hymen, one that has no holes, can cause blood to back up behind
the small opening; this blood can be forced back up into the fallopian tubes.
Women with an imperforate hymen have a higher incidence of endometriosis,
a disease that can affect your ability to get pregnant in several ways. (See
Chapter 6 for more on endometriosis in this book, and check out Endometriosis
For Dummies, by Joseph Krotec. MD and Sharon Perkins, RN [Wiley 2006], for
all you ever wanted to know about endometriosis.)
The cervix
The cervix is the lower part of the uterus. It keeps the baby from falling out of
the uterus when you’re pregnant because it’s a tight, muscle-like tissue. The
cervix also guards against infection because it’s filled with mucus that forms
a barrier between your vagina and the inside of the uterus. If you have an
incompetent cervix, it means that the cervix doesn’t stay tight and closed
when you’re pregnant but starts to open up from the weight of the growing
baby. An incompetent cervix is usually stitched with a suture called a cerclage
in early pregnancy to keep the baby where it belongs.
The uterus
The uterus, or womb, is a pear-shaped organ designed to hold and nourish 
a baby for nine months. Every month the lining of the uterus, called the
endometrium, thickens to make a nourishing bed for an embryo. If you don’t
get pregnant that month, the lining breaks down and is shed as your menstrual
flow, or period.
Many women have a uterus that doesn’t conform to the standard upside-down
pear shape you’ve all seen in pictures marked “this is your uterus.” If you’re
one of these women, your uterus is flopped forward, toward your pubic bone.
Twenty percent of women have a tipped or retroverted uterus, which, contrary
to what many women believe, does not cause problems getting pregnant.
Around 2 to 3 percent of women have an abnormally shaped uterus. The
most common variation is a septate uterus, which means that a band of tissue
(septum) partially or completely divides the inside of the uterus. This tissue can
be surgically removed. A T-shaped uterus is often a side effect of your mom’s
taking DES, a drug given from the 1940s to the 1960s to prevent miscarriage.
23
Chapter 2: Understanding Your Anatomy

Bicornuate (two-horn) and unicornuate (one-horn) uteri have either one (uni)
or two (bi) narrower-than-normal cavities. Women with T-shaped, bicornuate,
and unicornuate uteri have higher-than-normal miscarriage rates.
It’s also possible to have two separate uterine cavities, called a didelphys
uterus; such women usually also have a second cervix. You may need to have
a cesarean section (a surgical delivery) if you have a double cervix, meaning
that more isn’t always better. 
Even if the shape of your uterus is normal, it may contain some unwanted
“accessories” — growths such as polyps and fibroids — which may decrease
the chance that a fetus can implant and grow in your uterus. Polyps are easily
removed and don’t cause any complications after they’re gone. Removing
fibroids is more complex. Small ones may be removed through the vagina by
entering the uterus through the cervix in an outpatient surgicenter, but large
ones may require an abdominal incision and a hospital stay of a couple of
days. Removing fibroids can leave scar tissue in the cavity that can make it
harder to get pregnant because the fetus won’t be able to implant in the
scarred area. You may also need a cesarean section after fibroid removal. 
Scar tissue can also form in your uterus after a dilation and curettage (D&C
for short). If there’s a lot of scar tissue, nearly filling the uterus, it’s called
Asherman’s syndrome. This scar tissue can also be removed surgically to
make it easier for you to get pregnant.
The ovaries
Most women have two ovaries, which contain the most important accessory
of all — eggs! How many eggs? Less every year, since every day of your life,
eggs are lost through atresia, which means that they die off because they’re
not being stimulated to mature. For example:
 Before birth, a girl fetus’s ovaries contain around 3.5 million eggs
 A newborn baby girl’s ovaries contain about 1 million eggs
 By puberty, only 300,000 to 400,000 eggs remain
 Every month, 500 to 1,000 eggs are lost, along with the one or possibly
two eggs that mature and are released each month. 
 By age 50, only 1,000 or so eggs remain, and many are abnormal because
the “good” eggs get used up first.
The eggs
You may wonder what eggs contain to make them into your potential scream-
ing newborn. The answer is chromosomes — 23 chromosomes, to be exact.
Each chromosome contains the genes that determine whether your baby is
tall or short, blond or brunet, and, to some extent, fat or thin. (See the section
“Recognizing genetic diseases that can impact fertility” for more information
on chromosomes and genes.)
24
Part I: Are We There Yet? Wondering Why You’re Not Pregnant 

Of course, there’s more to an egg than chromosomes. Three protective layers
surround the egg, starting with the cumulus layer. That’s the nourishing and
protecting fluffy layers of cells that completely surround the egg. Moving
inward, you’ll see the corona radiate, the protective single layer of cells cov-
ering the zona pellucida, the “shell” of the egg. A mature, ready-for-fertilization
oocyte, or egg, has a small attachment called a polar body, which is the rem-
nant left after the egg divides (a process called meiosis) so that it contains
only 23 chromosomes. The polar body also contains 23 chromosomes.
All cells in the human body besides eggs and sperm have 46 chromosomes.
Eggs and sperm each have 23, so the baby they create has 46.
Each month, one egg is released from one of your ovaries. The decision about
which one ovulates (right or left) is random; they do not necessarily alter-
nate. If you have only one ovary, either because you were born that way or
because one was surgically removed, your one ovary takes over egg making
each month, so that you still ovulate each month.
The fallopian tubes
You should have two fallopian tubes, one near each ovary. Tubes are kind of
like a pickup bar — a place where sperm and egg should meet and, it is
hoped, go on to create something bigger and better: a baby! When an egg is
released from the ovary, little projections called fimbriae on the end of the
tube move back and forth to “entice” the egg into the tube. Once in the fallop-
ian tube, the egg needs a few days to shimmy down to the uterus. One hopes
along the way it meets Mr. Sperm and fertilizes, thereby transforming into an
embryo by the time it reaches the uterus. Damaged tubes, usually damaged
from infection but sometimes from endometriosis or surgery, are a very
common cause of infertility. We talk about this in depth in Chapter 11.
The egg does not have to be picked up by the fallopian tube nearest the
ovary. As much as one-third of the time, the opposite tube can do the job.
So if you only have one open tube, and you ovulate from the opposite ovary,
pregnancy can still occur.
The breasts
Breasts aren’t necessary for getting pregnant; women who have had breasts
removed can get pregnant. The normal number of breasts, of course, is two.
Nipples are a different matter. As many as 1 in 20 people have more than two
nipples. The extras may be nothing more than reddish brown, rough pieces
of skin, often found in line with the main nipples. Check yourself out!
Controlling your hormones
You can have all the reproductive organs you need, and all in perfect order,
and still have no chance of getting pregnant. You can’t get pregnant unless
25
Chapter 2: Understanding Your Anatomy

your organs are all synchronized to produce an egg and prepare a proper
“landing spot” for it in the uterus at the proper time. What you need to orches-
trate the process are hormones, which are chemical substances released from
one part of the body that cause a reaction in another part of the body.
The three female hormone-control systems that work together to orchestrate
your menstrual cycle are:
 The hypothalamus (the small structure in the middle of the brain that
regulates the nervous and endocrine systems, as well as body weight
and temperature)
 The pituitary (an endocrine gland at the base of the brain below the
hypothalamus that secretes several hormones, including FSH and LH
which are critical for reproduction; the pituitary gland used to be called
the “master gland”)
 The ovary (the female reproductive organ that produces estrogen, prog-
esterone, and eggs)
These three hormone systems work together in a feedback system called the
Hypothalamus-pituitary-ovarian axis, which simply means that they function
together to produce a seamless masterpiece — your menstrual cycle. 
The main female hormones are:
 Estrogen
 Luteinizing hormone (LH)
 Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH)
 Progesterone
Putting All Your Reproductive Parts
Together: Your Menstrual Cycle
All the components of your reproductive tract — the vagina, uterus, ovaries,
fallopian tubes, and the glands that orchestrate your hormones — have to
work together perfectly for you to be able to get pregnant. (Yes, you need
sperm, too, but we get to that in a later section, “Hanging Out with the Guys.”)
Although your menstrual cycle seems simple enough, a lot of things, unfortu-
nately, can go wrong. We not only address how your cycle works but also
how it may not work in the next few sections.
26
Part I: Are We There Yet? Wondering Why You’re Not Pregnant 

Checking out how your cycle runs
The hormone-secreting systems work to create your menstrual cycle like this:
1. Follicular phase: The old uterine lining breaks down and passes through
the vagina as menstrual flow. This process takes one to five days.
Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) is released from your pituitary gland. 
In the ovary, 10 to 15 follicles, called antral follicles, begin to grow. The
cells surrounding each egg secrete a liquid, forming a follicle, a fluid-
filled sac. Each follicle contains one egg. During this time period an egg
matures.
In response to FSH and luteinizing hormone (LH), the follicle is released
from the pituitary gland, and begins to produce estrogen. In the ovary,
one egg-containing follicle is growing and producing estrogen. In the
uterus, the estrogen produced by the ovary is making the lining thicken.
This is called the proliferative phase of the uterus.
One follicle becomes dominant, growing faster than the others. As the
dominant follicle grows, it produces more estrogen. The amount of FSH
released decreases, and the smaller follicles stop growing.
A large amount of LH, called an LH surge, is released from the pituitary
gland as the estrogen rises. This makes the egg inside the dominant folli-
cle mature.
2. Ovulation: The follicle bursts; the egg is released (ovulation) and is
picked up by one of the fallopian tubes.
3. Secretory phase: After meeting up with the lucky sperm, the resulting
embryo begins to travel down the fallopian tubes, a journey of several
days. The uterine lining is now thick enough to support embryo implan-
tation and its glands secrete proteins which help guide the embryo to
the correct spot. 
4. Luteal phase: The leftover part of the follicle, now called the corpus
luteum, produces progesterone to help an embryo implant. 
The embryo floats in the uterus for several days and then implants in the
thickened uterine lining and starts to grow. If you’re not pregnant, the
lining will break down two weeks after ovulation, and your cycle will
begin again.
The importance of regular periods
Do your periods always come every 28 days like clockwork? If they do, you’re
a rarity; only one in ten women fall into what we’ve been conditioned to think
27
Chapter 2: Understanding Your Anatomy

of as a “normal” menstrual pattern. Most women have cycles 25 to 31 days
apart.
When your doctor asks you how long your cycles are, he’s asking how many
days are between day one of one period and day one of the next period.
When he asks how long your period is, he’s asking how many days you bleed.
Day one of your period is the first day of normal (for you) flow, not the day
when you have light or irregular spotting before your period starts. 
If you are on, or have been on, birth control pills, be sure to note that in
charting your menstrual pattern. The pill chemically coordinates your cycle
to come at the same time each month (provided you take the pill correctly!).
Determining your actual menstrual pattern can only be done after you’ve
been off the pill for at least three months.
What’s regular for you may not be regular for someone else, but having some
sort of pattern to your periods is important, because it indicates that you’re
producing and releasing eggs on a regular basis. This isn’t, however, a hard-
and-fast rule; some women with periods like clockwork aren’t making eggs at
all, but that’s a rarity.
It normally takes between 10 to 14 days to mature a good egg and release it,
so you normally ovulate sometime between day 10 and day 14 of your cycle.
How do you know if you’ve ovulated? Some women experience a sharp pain
when they ovulate, called mittelschmertz (see the section “Recognizing signs
of ovulation” for tips on knowing when you’re ovulating).
The most consistent part of your period should be the time between ovula-
tion, or release of the egg, and the start of your next period. This time period
should be between 13 to 14 days; if you’re getting your period 12 days or less
after ovulation, you may not be making enough progesterone to support a
pregnancy.
If you’re cycles are very long, or very irregular, you may not be producing
eggs often, or at all! See “Malfunctioning menstrual cycles” for more on how
irregular cycles affect your chance of getting pregnant.
Wanna know what’s in that flow?
Just before your period starts, your uterine lining is approximately 10 millime-
ters thick. Your period starts when the lining, or endometrium, starts to break
down. Menstrual flow consists of endometrial tissue mixed with blood from
the torn blood vessels, cervical mucus, and cellular debris. This all adds up
to a little more than 30 milliliters (an ounce) of discharge, although it certainly
seems like a lot more! More than 80 milliliters (a little less than 3 ounces) of
discharge is abnormal.
Menstrual blood normally doesn’t clot, unless your flow is very heavy.
Sometimes the lining is shed in large fragments (sometimes called decidual
casts) that can look like an early miscarriage.
28
Part I: Are We There Yet? Wondering Why You’re Not Pregnant 

Don’t assume that you’re having a miscarriage if you pass some tissue and
blood, even if it’s not the right time to have a period. If you can, bring the tissue
to your doctor (a zipper baggie or a plastic tub is fine), and even if you can’t,
you can still get a pregnancy test to see if you were or were not pregnant. This
information may be very helpful to your doctor (and to you) in the future.
Timing and fertility
Timing is everything when it comes to getting pregnant. Many women miss
the mark month after month because of mistaken ideas about the best time
to get pregnant. 
Sperm and eggs both have a short “shelf life”; eggs are capable of being fertil-
ized for around 24 hours and sperm can live up to four days in the proper
environment, such as the fluid that fills the fallopian tubes. That means that if
you don’t have sex within a few days before ovulation, you’re not going to get
pregnant.
Many women have been conditioned to believe that ovulation occurs on day
14; they have sex on days 12, 13, or 14 in hopes of hitting the right time. But
the most consistent thing about your menstrual cycle should be that ovula-
tion occurs 14 days before your period begins. So if your cycles are 28 days,
you ovulate on day 14. But if your cycles are short, say 25 days, you’re actu-
ally ovulating on day 11, and having sex starting on day 12 will be too late to
achieve a pregnancy.
On the other hand, if your cycles are long, say 34 days, you don’t ovulate
until day 20. Having sex on day 14 will be way too early, since sperm don’t
live for a week.
So timing sex correctly when you want to get pregnant is dependent on a
solid knowledge of when you’re ovulating. We discuss the ways ovulation can
be predicted in Chapter 4.
Sperm live longer in your body than the egg, so err on the early side when
deciding when to start having sex. Every other day is enough, and there is no
harm in having extra sperm around. When in doubt, just do it!
Malfunctioning menstrual cycles
Although it may seem like your menstrual cycle runs like clockwork, always
appearing on the expected day, the likelihood is that at least part of the time,
your cycle is out of synch, showing up too early, too late, or not at all, even
though you’re not pregnant. Irregular periods not only make it hard to deter-
mine when you ovulate; they can also indicate that your reproductive system is
in need of fine tuning. In this section, we discuss all the ways cycles can get out
of synch, what it can mean, and how your doctor might suggest fixing them.
29
Chapter 2: Understanding Your Anatomy

Menstrual cycles that don’t fall into the norm can indicate that you’re not
ovulating at all, or that you’re only ovulating occasionally. An occasional
irregular cycle can be brought about by stress, a change in routine, exercise,
eating patterns, or illness, but periods that are “never the same length twice,”
consistently shorter than normal or longer than normal, should be evaluated
by your doctor.
Bleeding too often — short cycles
If your cycles are very short — less than 25 days apart on a regular basis, you
may be ovulating too soon. Since the period between ovulation and the start
of your period should consistently be 14 days, if your periods are short, it
usually (but not always — we discuss the alterative in this section) means
that you have a short follicular phase, the time between you period and your
ovulation.
A short follicular phase can mean that the egg doesn’t have time to develop
properly before it’s being released; this is called premature luteinization. (See
Chapter 11 for more about premature luteinization.) Short follicular phases
can occur when your ovarian reserve, the number of eggs you still have in
your ovaries, is starting to decrease.
Just realizing that you’re ovulating before day 14 may result in pregnancy if
your cycles are short. However, if your cycles are very short because you’re
ovulating very early, on day 6 or so, your uterine lining may not have time to
build up enough for an embryo to implant by the time you ovulate. You need
to see your doctor in this case, to help prolong your follicular phase with hor-
mones. (See Chapter 14 for how this can be done.)
Your cycles can also be short if the secretory phase, the time between ovula-
tion and your next period, is shorter than 14 days. This is called luteal phase
defect, and usually indicates that the corpus luteum isn’t making enough
progesterone to sustain an embryo’s growth into the uterine lining. You may
need progesterone supplements if your progesterone is too low and your
periods are coming too quickly after ovulation.
Bleeding too infrequently or skipping periods
Cycles that are very long, over 35 days apart, can indicate that you’re not
ovulating regularly. This can be a factor of stress, exercise, weight change, or
other factors, but can also be caused by Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome, or
PCOS. PCOS can cause changes in hormone ratios that can be diagnosed by
your doctor, as well as physical changes such as excessive hair, weight gain,
and acne. (See Chapter 5 for more on PCOS.)
Endometriosis, premature ovarian failure (see Chapter 5 for more on both of
these), abnormal thyroid levels, or high prolactin levels (see Chapter 11 for
30
Part I: Are We There Yet? Wondering Why You’re Not Pregnant 

the details on diagnosing infertility causes through blood tests) can also
cause irregular or absent periods. 
Bleeding between periods
Bleeding between periods can indicate that something is wrong inside your
uterus, or that your hormones are out of balance. Some of the things that can
go wrong with your uterus to cause irregular bleeding are:
 Cervical irritations or infections: Possible causes of cervical bleeding 
 Fibroids: Benign growths found in the uterine wall
 Polyps: Small fleshy growths found on the endometrium, the lining of
the uterus, or the cervix
Bleeding too heavily (menorrhagia)
Bleeding too heavily and passing clots can be “normal” for some women,
especially in women who are overweight. Fibroids, PCOS, and irregular peri-
ods can be related to heavier than normal bleeding. Heavy bleeding can also
be a sign of recurrent early miscarriage (see Chapter 13).
Women who bleed heavily every month are at risk for becoming anemic
(having a decreased number of red blood cells). Anemia can lead to fatigue
and weakness, so heavy periods should be checked out with your doctor.
A simple blood test can diagnose anemia.
Having scant periods
If your period is very light, it could be a normal variant, (in which case, lucky
you!) or it could be a sign that your uterine lining isn’t getting as thick as it
should. Scant periods are typical if you’re usingbirth control pills or have just
stopped using them, or if your periods have just started. If your lining isn’t
thickening properly, you may not be ovulating normally, so seeing your
doctor is a good idea.
Experiencing painful periods (dysmenorrhea)
Up to 40 percent of women experience pain with their periods, called 
dysmenorrhea. Dysmenorrhea falls into two categories:
 Primary dysmenorrhea has no other underlying cause besides the release
of prostaglandins, (chemicals made by cells that have specific functions
such as controlling body temperature, stimulating smooth muscle, and
influencing heat cycles) in the uterus, which cause uterine contractions.
 Secondary dysmenorrhea is caused by disease present in addition to
the normal release of prostaglandins, such as endometriosis, fibroids, or
infection.
31
Chapter 2: Understanding Your Anatomy

Because painful periods can be caused by diseases that can interfere with
getting pregnant, such as endometriosis, you should always see your doctor
if you have painful periods. Dysmenorrhea is the most common symptom of
endometriosis, which affects over 5 million women in North America and
causes infertility in 30 to 40 percent of its sufferers.
The release of prostaglandins that cause cramping can also cause nausea,
diarrhea, and exhaustion, just to make you feel really terrible during your
periods. Taking anti-inflammatory medications such as ibuprofen can help
with the symptoms.
Hanging Out with the Guys
Compared to women, guys let it all hang out, reproductively speaking. That’s
a good thing because “hanging out,” at least as far as testicles are concerned,
is necessary to keep the developing sperm from getting too warm. Take a
look at what every guy should have. See Figure 2-2 for a graphic portrayal of
your average man.

The penis
The number-one guy concern is probably related to penis size: How do I com-
pare to everyone else? For those obsessed, here are the standards: normal
length when flaccid, or limp, 3.9 inches; stretched (still limp), 4.8 inches;
erect, 5 to 7 inches. We hope that bit of info made most of you fellows feel
better. A small penis, less than 1.9 inches limp, is usually able to impregnate
as long as it can get the sperm into the vagina, up toward the cervix. Size is
rarely an issue in infertility.
Size may not matter, but function does. If you watch Viagra commercials,
you may be comforted to know that even athletes and famous men have
problems with erectile dysfunction, also known as impotence. As nice as it
is to know that you’re not alone, this condition can be an embarrassing 
detriment to getting pregnant. Impotence, the inability to have or sustain an
erection, is more common as men get older; as many as 50 percent of men
between the ages of 40 and 70 have had problems with impotence. Impotence
can be caused by diseases such as diabetes or by chronic conditions, such as
alcohol abuse, or it can be a side effect of medications. (We discuss impotence
in Chapter 12.)
The opening that lets both urine and sperm out of the penis should be at the
tip of the penis, located dead center. Two types of variations can cause prob-
lems getting pregnant. One in around 300 men has hypospadias, which means
that the opening is on the underside of the penis. In 20 percent of cases, this
problem is hereditary. Epispadias occurs far less frequently; only 1 in approx-
imately 100,000 men has epispadias. In epispadias, the opening is on the top
of the penis. Both conditions are associated with an unusual curvature of the
erect penis; it curves up in epispadias and down in hypospadias. Both condi-
tions can prevent the sperm from getting exactly where they need to be.
Surgical correction is possible, and inseminations can also help get the sperm
to where they need to go.
The testicles
Testicles are the sperm production and warehouse site. Here, as in many
other places on the human body, nature has been generous and given two of
the same body part (testicles, in this instance), in case something happens to
one. Testicles first develop inside the abdomen and gradually descend out-
side the body by the time a baby boy is born. At birth, about 4 in 100 boys
have undescended testicles, properly called cryptorchidism. Testicles need to
be kept a few degrees cooler than 98 degrees for sperm to develop properly,
so to prevent future infertility, doctors usually recommend surgery to lower
the testicles outside the body as soon as the baby is a year old.
The testicles are contained in a pouch of skin called the scrotum. In about 
80 percent of men, the left testicle is bigger and hangs lower. Sometimes the
33
Chapter 2: Understanding Your Anatomy

testicles are abnormally large, which can be caused by a hydrocele, which is 
a collection of fluid inside the scrotum, or by a varicocele, which is the condi-
tion of dilated or varicose veins in the testicle. These conditions can be 
surgically corrected. If left alone, they can raise the temperature of the
testes and cause infertility.
Sperm are produced every day, but it takes about 70 days for the new sperm
to fully mature. Sperm production starts in the testes. FSH and LH, the same
hormones that develop eggs, are needed to begin sperm production. LH stim-
ulates production of testosterone, another male hormone. The sperm mature
in the epididymis and travel through the vas deferens up to the seminal vesi-
cle and the prostate, where they’re bathed in the fluid known as semen.
They’re then ejaculated through the urethra during male orgasm.
Sperm — 200 million of them!
Here comes one egg — or maybe two eggs, if it’s a good month — tooling
down the fallopian tubes. The egg is about the size of a pencil point dot —
in other words, barely visible. All of a sudden the egg meets up with about
200 sperm, the sole survivors of an ejaculate of over 100 million sperm a few
hours before — talk about an embarrassment of riches. The sperm are much
smaller than the egg, so small that all the sperm needed to repopulate the
earth could sit on an aspirin tablet. There’s enough room for all of them to
attach their heads to the egg and try to beat down the door. Ideally, only one
will succeed, and the others will be shut out immediately.
Why are there so many more sperm than eggs? Because it’s a long way
through the uterus and up the tubes, and because only 50 percent (of a good
sperm sample) of the sperm know how to swim forward, and because some
of them are barely moving, a tremendous number of sperm are needed to
ensure that a few hundred will get through to the egg. Their journey is like
one of you trying to swim across the Pacific Ocean. If there were 200 million
of you, maybe a few hundred would make it. Imagine if you had to fertilize an
egg when you finally got there! (We talk about sperm and male factor issues
much more in Chapter 12.)
Putting Male and Female Parts Together:
Having Sex (At the Right Time)
Now that you know how all your parts work, are you ready to have a baby?
Yes? Then it’s time to have sex. No, not right now. It’s important to have sex
when the timing is right. How do you know when the timing is right? This is
more than just mood lighting and foreplay. To get pregnant, you need to be
close to ovulation. 
34
Part I: Are We There Yet? Wondering Why You’re Not Pregnant 

Recognizing signs of ovulation
You may be able to tell that you’re ovulating in a few simple ways, just by
watching the calendar and being observant about your bodily functions.
Usually the mucus from your cervix increases around the time of ovulation.
It also becomes very thin, clear, and stretchy; you can easily stretch it out a
couple of inches. Rising estrogen levels from a developing follicle create this
mucus, which is easier for sperm to swim through than your usual thicker
mucus and also has an alkaline pH, which helps the sperm live longer. At
other times of the month, cervical mucus is acidic. Be sure that you’re not
confusing cervical mucus with semen from previous sex or increased secre-
tions from sexual arousal.
Some doctors believe that taking antihistamines may decrease cervical
mucus. To be on the safe side, avoid antihistamines around ovulation time.
If you have no objection to feeling around inside your vagina, you’ll also
notice that your cervix becomes softer, slightly open, and easier to locate
with your fingers when you’re about to ovulate. At other times of the month,
the cervix is found farther back in the uterus, feels firmer to the touch, and is
tightly closed.
If you know how long your cycles are, count back 14 days from the length of
your cycle to figure out when you’re probably ovulating. For example, if your
cycles are 29 days, you ovulate on day 15. If your cycles are 26 days apart,
you ovulate on day 12.
About 20 percent of women have pain called mittelschmertz (German for
“middle pain”) when they ovulate. The pain seems to be caused by blood and
fluid irritating the tissues around the ovary after it releases from the follicle.
Sometimes a small amount of vaginal bleeding occurs with ovulation too.
Some women have headaches around the time of ovulation, and others com-
plain of bloating or breast pain. You’re probably already aware of your personal
ovulation indicators, but you may have just never paid much attention to them.
Now you should. They’re a big help in choosing when to have baby sex.
Conceiving a Baby: How Sex 
Should Work
The time is right, the moon is bright, and it’s time to get pregnant. Here’s
what needs to happen:
35
Chapter 2: Understanding Your Anatomy

1. It’s near ovulation; an egg is about to release from its follicle.
2. You and your partner become aroused. Your vagina produces secretions
that make it easier for the now erect penis to enter the vagina.
3. During the man’s orgasm, several million sperm are forcefully ejaculated
into the vagina. As they pass through the cervix into the uterus, the cer-
vical mucus “filters” the sperm so that they’re ready to penetrate an egg.
4. Your egg releases from the follicle and enters one of your fallopian tubes.
5. The sperm swim through the uterus up to the fallopian tubes; half
choose the wrong tube to enter.
6. The next day your egg meets up with several hundred sperm in the fal-
lopian tube, and the sperm all attach themselves to the egg, trying to
beat down the door.
7. One sperm breaks through the outer layer of the egg, and the egg imme-
diately becomes impenetrable to the rest of the sperm.
8. The genetic material of the egg and sperm combine, and the newly cre-
ated embryo drifts down the fallopian tube to the uterus.
9. The embryo implants in the uterine wall and grows, and you miss your
period.
10. You’re pregnant! Congratulations.
After sex, just lie there for a while. Don’t jump up and go to the bathroom
right away. Let gravity help those little swimmers get to where they need to
be. Some doctors advocate placing a pillow under the hips during sex to give
gravity a little edge in directing the sperm where they need to be. Doing so
probably isn’t necessary. You can also choose whatever position is best for
you and your partner. There is no “best” position for making babies.
Figuring Out How Often to Have Sex
When you’re trying to get pregnant, you need to strike a balance between too
much sex and not enough. Too much sex decreases sperm counts, but if you
have too little sex, you may miss the right moment for conception. Not having
sex for more than five days may raise the number of sperm but decrease their
motility (the active movement). Sex less than two days apart may decrease
the sperm count. So how do you figure out when the right time is?
When you’re close to ovulating, have sex at least every other day; every day
is okay, but more than once per day is probably too much. Most doctors rec-
ommend the two days before and the day you ovulate as the best time for
conception.   
36
Part I: Are We There Yet? Wondering Why You’re Not Pregnant 

Getting Into Your Genes
Everyone should inherit 23 chromosomes from each parent, for a total of
46 chromosomes, arranged in 23 pairs. Genes are found in standard locations
on different chromosomes.
Genes are an important, although normally invisible, part of your anatomy.
Genes are sections of DNA that occupy certain locations on chromosomes;
they determine the characteristics that make you “you,” like the color of your
eyes, your height, and your predisposition to certain diseases. The sections
that follow explore some of the diseases based on genetics as well as the
basics about genetic testing. 
Recognizing genetic diseases 
that can impact fertility
Certain inherited diseases can interfere with getting pregnant. You may
already know you have an infertility-causing disease, , or may you just find
out when you start trying to get pregnant.
Genetic diseases such as Turner Syndrome in women, Kleinfelter Syndrome
in men and cystic fibrosis can cause infertility. Less easily recognized prob-
lems, such as deletion of part of the Y chromosome in males, may not be 
recognized until a fertility workup is done.
About 1 in 500 people has a chromosomal translocation. Translocation of chro-
mosomes may cause an individual no problem and isn’t usually obvious but
may cause recurrent miscarriage if passed on by either parent. This is because
the translocation in an individual is usually balanced — one piece of a chromo-
some has been exchanged for another. When the chromosome is passed on,
however, it may be “unbalanced,” causing miscarriage or abnormal pregnancy.
Factoring in your genes
Back in 1990, scientists began a project called the Human Genome Project,
designed to map the location of every gene present on the 23 pairs of human
chromosomes, and to sequence the over 3 billion DNA base pairs that make
up the chromosomes. A daunting task — but the Human Genome Project
announced the completion of this task in 2001, after the identification of 30,000
(give or take a few) genes. The Human Genome Project makes it possible to
test for very specific changes on chromosomes that can cause diseases such
as cystic fibrosis and Tay-Sachs diseases.
37
Chapter 2: Understanding Your Anatomy

Understanding inherited genes
Genetic disease inheritance is complicated and falls into several different pat-
terns; the four most common are:
 Autosomal recessive: A child must inherit the mutation from both par-
ents to have the disease. A child whose parents both carry the gene has
a 25 percent chance of having the disease, a 50 percent chance of being
a carrier of the disease but not having it, and a 25 percent chance of not
inheriting the gene at all. Cystic fibrosis and sickle cell anemia are exam-
ples of autosomal recessive diseases. Approximately 80 percent of chil-
dren born with an autosomal recessive disorder have no evidence of the
disease itself in their families. That’s because family members can carry
a gene for autosomal recessive disease for generations . . . or forever,
without the disease showing up, if no one marries a partner with the
same recessive gene. Without two copies of the mutation, one from each
parent, a child will not be born with the actual disease. 
 Autosomal dominant: The child will have the disease even if only one
parent passes on the mutation. Huntington’s chorea is an example of
this disease. Huntington’s chorea can be passed on because its carriers
usually survive long enough to have children and pass on the gene.
 X-linked dominant: An X-linked disease is a mutation of the X chromo-
some. Females are more often affected because they have two X chromo-
somes. Men can only pass an X chromosome to a daughter (girls have
XX sex chromosomes, boys have XY, and mom always passes on one of
the Xs) so men can’t pass X-linked disease to their sons. Fragile X
Syndrome is an example of this disease.
 X-linked recessive: Both parents must pass on the gene for the child to
be affected; one in four will have the disease, two in four will be carriers,
and one in four will be free of the disease. Hemophilia is an example of
an X-linked recessive disease. More males than females are affected by
X-linked recessive disease, and males can’t pass them on the sons.
Checking out common and not so common genetic diseases
Some genetic diseases are fairly common, such as the tendency toward heart
disease, diabetes, and certain types of cancer. Others are rare, with only a
few known cases in the world. Genes can spontaneously mutate, so a genetic
disease can show up in a family without a previous history of that disease.
Race and genetic diseases
Some diseases are more likely to be found in persons of a certain race:
African Americans are more likely to carry the sickle cell anemia gene, for
example, and cystic fibrosis is found more frequently in Caucasians.
38
Part I: Are We There Yet? Wondering Why You’re Not Pregnant 

Ethnicity and genetic diseases
Populations that have intermarried more often over the years are more prone
to carrying certain genes. One such well documented group is the Ashkenazi
Jewish population, which consists of Jews from central and Eastern Europe.
Around 80 percent of American Jews are of Ashkenazi descent. Two well
known examples of genes carried by people of this descent are:
 Tay-Sachs Disease: 1 in 31 Ashkenazi Jews is a carrier.
 Gaucher Disease: 1 in 10 is a carrier.
Another example is the Pakistani community in the United Kingdom, in
which:
 Between 20 and 88 percent of the population are related to one another
 One out of every one hundred babies dies from life-threatening 
malformations 
 Nonlethal malformations are four times more likely to occur than in the
general population
Testing for abnormalities
If you have a known hereditary disease in your family or are experiencing
recurrent pregnancy loss, you may want to know more about your individual
genes because knowing what genes you carry can predict whether or not
your future child will inherit certain diseases. If you’ve had recurrent loss,
genetic testing may be able to tell you whether you have a chromosomal
abnormality that’s causing pregnancy loss.
Chromosomal testing is done by different techniques, depending on what
you’re looking for. Chromosomal tests look only at the number and shape of
chromosomes. It doesn’t evaluate the genes found on the chromosomes.
Many genetic abnormalities are found by chromosome testing because the
diseases are caused by extra chromosomes or too few chromosomes. Down
syndrome, or trisomy 21, for example, is caused by an extra copy of chromo-
some 21.
Genetic testing can also be done if you’re looking for a specific known gene.
Changes in that specific gene can be evaluated for presence of disease. All
that’s needed for testing is a blood sample.

Chapter 3
Practicing Positive Behaviors —
Before Conception
In This Chapter
 Changing your lifestyle for conception
 Eating properly
 Avoiding bad habits
 Treating sexually transmitted diseases
E
ven though you’re probably anxious to get started on baby making, take
a little time to make sure that you’re in the best possible condition for
conceiving a healthy baby. This means making sure that you’re not carrying
an infection that could harm you or your baby and taking a look at your
lifestyle habits, good and bad. In this chapter, we tell you how to get in shape
physically if you’re trying to get pregnant and discuss some behavior that
could be decreasing your odds of getting pregnant. We also take a look at
how what you eat could influence your chance of conceiving.
Making Healthy Lifestyle Changes
“Everything in moderation” is certainly a good motto for habits, good and
bad. Too much exercise can have a less than desirable effect, while coffee,
drunk in moderation, can be benign. But, before you say yes to things that
are better left in the no category, consider that some things are best elimi-
nated entirely, particularly when you’re trying to conceive.

Giving up smoking
Smoking is bad for you. You all know it. Yet 30 percent of women in the
United States still smoke. Need some good reasons to quit? Here are a few:
 Smokers are 50 percent more likely to miscarry.
 Smokers are two to four times more likely to have an ectopic pregnancy
(one that implants in the fallopian tube rather than in the uterus, a topic
we discuss in detail in Chapter 6).
 Smokers go through menopause earlier, decreasing the number of years
pregnancy can occur.
 Smokers’ eggs have more genetic abnormalities.
 Smokers’ eggs are prone to polyspermy, where two or more sperm enter
an egg. The embryos that result are chromosomally abnormal and will
not grow.
If you’ve quit but your partner hasn’t, he may want to consider the following:
 Men who smoke have a lower sperm count.
 Men who smoke have a 20 percent decrease in sperm motility.
 Smokers’ sperm have more abnormal shapes. Abnormally shaped sperm
have a higher rate of chromosomal abnormalities.
Eliminating alcohol
Studies show that heavy drinkers (more than three drinks a day) have more
trouble getting pregnant. Continuing to drink while pregnant increases the
chance for miscarriage and can also cause fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). FAS
babies have learning and behavioral problems and typically have small
heads, a flat midface, small eye slits, and a low nasal ridge.
In addition, drinking heavily can cause menstrual irregularities, and can also
make you forget about trying to get pregnant!
What about an occasional drink on a special holiday or on New Year’s Eve? It’s
best to follow your own doctor’s recommendation on alcohol and to remem-
ber that an occasional glass means just that — occasional, not every day!
Saying no to drugs
Undoubtedly you know that illegal drugs are taboo when trying to become
pregnant! Here are the problems that some common drugs can cause when
you’re trying to get pregnant.
42
Part I: Are We There Yet? Wondering Why You’re Not Pregnant 

Cocaine
Cocaine causes constriction of the blood vessels, which can result in early
miscarriage, preterm delivery, and problems with the placenta, the organ that
nourishes the baby. In addition, cocaine can cause menstrual irregularities,
possibly making it harder for you to become pregnant.
Marijuana
Marijuana lowers sperm count, decreases sperm’s motility or ability to move
forward, lowers the amount of testosterone in males, and results in an
increased number of abnormal eggs and sperm.
Avoiding anabolic steroids
Some studies show that as many as 6 to 7 percent of all males have used ana-
bolic steroids before age 18 to build muscle mass. Anabolic steroids suppress
the body’s ability to make testosterone, which is necessary for normal sperm
production. This damage can be permanent, so stay away from the steroids.
Eating Well When Trying to Conceive
Because the best parents generally practice what they preach, setting up
some good habits even before conception occurs is as good a start as any!
Good nutrition is important at every stage of your life, but particularly when
you’re trying to conceive and maintain a pregnancy and ultimately deliver a
healthy child. Although a perfectly tuned body isn’t a necessity for having
children, it certainly provides an ideal starting point. Nurturing your mind
and heart is equally important. The following sections offer some tips on
keeping your entire self in tiptop baby-making shape.
Obtaining the proper nutrition
Although vitamins provide good supplementation, get as many nutrients and
minerals as possible from the food you eat. So before ingesting supplements
ranging from vitamin A to zinc, start instead with your diet. Eating three
square meals a day, plus a snack, is a good place to begin. What should those

Getting in the right shape — nutritionally
Look at your fertility diet in the shape of a pregnant woman’s body. See
Figure 3-1 for a visual of a pregnant you as a food chart. At the top, the small-
est spot (your head) should be reserved for fats, oils, and sweets. This cate-
gory includes jam, mayonnaise, margarine, candy, and so on. Use these foods
sparingly.
43
Chapter 3: Practicing Positive Behaviors — Before Conception

The next step down on the chart consists of two slightly larger categories:
the milk, yogurt, and cheese group and the group that includes meat, poultry,
fish, dry beans, eggs, and nuts. It is recommended that you consume two to
three servings from the milk, yogurt, and cheese group. In this category, a
serving is considered 1 cup of milk or yogurt or 2 ounces of processed
cheese. Two to three servings (ounces) are recommended in the group that
includes lean meat, poultry, fish, eggs, dry beans, and nuts. This level pro-
vides you with calcium, riboflavin, protein, iron, and B vitamins.
The next level calls for three to five servings of vegetables and two to four
servings of fruit. A serving size of vegetables consists of 1 cup of raw leafy
vegetables, 1⁄2 cup of cooked vegetables, or 3⁄4 cup of vegetable juice, and a
serving size of fruits consists of one medium apple, banana, or orange, 1⁄2 cup
of chopped cooked or canned fruit, or 3⁄4 cup of fruit juice. Notice that the rec-
ommended servings have increased from the higher level of this food chart.
Pay attention to this recommendation. Vegetables and fruits are your most
important source for fiber, vitamin A, vitamin C, and carbohydrates.
At the bottom of the pregnant woman food chart, you find the largest food
group, which contains bread, cereal, rice, and pasta. Consider this the abdomen!
The recommendation is that you eat six to eleven servings of this group per
day. But before you wolf down a plate of pasta, remember your serving sizes.
A serving in this group consists of one slice of bread, half a bagel, 1 ounce of
ready-to-eat cereal, 1⁄2 cup of cooked rice or pasta, three to four small, plain
crackers, or one 4-inch pancake.

Part I: Are We There Yet? Wondering Why You’re Not Pregnant 

If this seems like any other food plan you’ve ever seen, there’s a reason for it —
it is! Healthy eating is a standard practice. There are few tricks to eating healthy.
When trying to conceive, eat enough but not too much and use your calories
for healthy foods and not empty ones (such as chocolate). If you’re not lactose
intolerant, you may want to up your dairy intake; if you’re lactose intolerant,
which means that you can’t properly digest milk products, you can get cal-
cium from oral supplements.
Be careful of health foods such as soy, sunflower seeds, or herbs such as Vitex
that promise to raise your estrogen level. (You can read more about herbs in
Chapter 5.) Your body — more specifically, your ovaries — should be produc-
ing estrogen. By introducing an exogenous (outside) source, you’re not assist-
ing your body in manufacturing its own supply; you’re only supplementing it
artificially. This addition does not change the quality of your eggs or their
output of estrogen. It only confuses any measurement of estrogen, as it’s impos-
sible to distinguish what your body makes on its own from that which you
gain from outside sources. Skip any supplement or food that claims to
increase your estrogen level.
Weighty warnings
Another practice to avoid is dieting, particularly fad diets. Conception is an
act of incredible balance and timing. You don’t want to throw your body off
with the latest diet that promises to help you lose five pounds fast. More than
likely, such a diet is a method that probably won’t help your weight or your
health any more than it will help your fertility.
If you’re significantly overweight or underweight, you may want to consult
your physician first (an OB/GYN will do). Either extreme can cause problems
in fertility, particularly if your weight is symptomatic of another condition
such as diabetes, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), or amenorrhea. Twelve
percent of all infertility is a result of weighing either too much or too little.
The good news is that 70 percent of all women diagnosed with infertility
related to being overweight or underweight conceive spontaneously when
their weight normalizes.
If weight loss or weight gain is in order, consider addressing this matter
before trying to conceive. Check with your physician and ask for a healthy
diet and exercise plan. If you must embark on a weight adjustment program
simultaneously with your baby-making efforts, make sure that your physician
is aware of both goals.
In an Australian study of 3,500 women, very obese women were half as likely
to conceive when compared to their healthier peer group. The researchers
also concluded that it was no good being underweight either: Women who
were below moderate weight also had less of a chance of becoming pregnant.
45
Chapter 3: Practicing Positive Behaviors — Before Conception

Ways in which extremes of weight can affect fertility include menstrual 
disturbance, disturbance to the lining of the uterus, inability to ovulate
(anovulation), and increased risk of miscarriage.
Taking vitamins
Multivitamins are a good way to supplement your diet, but they’re not a sub-
stitute for good nutrition. While you’re trying to conceive and when you get
pregnant, you need both. Much has been written about the importance of
folic acid in early pregnancy. It has been shown to diminish certain birth
defects, such as spina bifida.
Most garden-variety multivitamins contain adequate amounts of folic acid
and suffice while you’re trying to conceive. Your OB/GYN can switch you to
prenatal vitamins as soon as you become pregnant. 
Complicating Things through 
Common Infections 
The onset of the sexual revolution in the 1960s caused a lot of fallout, and
some of it fell on future fertility. Sexually transmitted diseases, or STDs, have
increased dramatically in the last 20 years. More than 13 million Americans
each year are affected, and many STDs pack a major anti-fertility wallop for
both sexes. You may not even know that you have a sexually transmitted dis-
ease. Some STDs cause a vaginal or penile discharge, others cause itching or
small sores, but some cause no symptoms at all. Most are easily treated with
antibiotics. The problem is that many women don’t realize they have an infec-
tion because most have no clear symptoms. The following sections describe
a few of the most damaging STDs and provide some statistics about the dis-
eases in the United States.
Chlamydia: The most common STD
Chlamydia is the most common sexually transmitted disease in the United
States. The bacterium Chlamydia trachomatis is responsible for the infection.
Both men and women can be infected, and both male and female fertility can
be damaged. Chlamydia is easily tested by swabbing the penis or vagina and
sending the swab to a lab for testing. A new test using urine is also being
developed. Chlamydia is easily treated with antibiotics.
46
Part I: Are We There Yet? Wondering Why You’re Not Pregnant 

Here are some facts about the disease:
 About 4 million new cases of chlamydia are diagnosed every year.
 Approximately one in ten sexually active adolescents has been exposed
to chlamydia.
 Women with untreated chlamydia have a 40 percent chance of developing
pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), a major cause of damaged fallopian
tubes.
 Women with PID are seven to ten times more likely to have an ectopic
pregnancy, a pregnancy that grows outside the uterus, usually in the
tubes. (For more about ectopic pregnancies, see Chapter 6.)
 Most women (75 percent) have no symptoms of infection; symptoms
include lower abdominal pain, burning with urination, and vaginal 
irritation.
 Twenty-five percent of men have no symptoms from chlamydia; seventy-
five percent have a discharge from the urethra, or pain and burning on
urination.
 Men with untreated chlamydia can develop epididymitis, an infection in
the testicles, where sperm are developed. This condition can lead to low
sperm counts.
 Each year, 100,000 women become infertile from chlamydia. With a first
infection, 12 percent of women become infertile; a second case increases
infertility to 40 percent. Eighty percent of women who have had chlamy-
dia three or more times are infertile.
 Untreated chlamydia when you’re pregnant can lead to blindness in 
your child.
Gonorrhea
Gonorrhea is caused by the bacterium Neisseria gonorrhoeae, which can infect
the genital tract, mouth, or rectum. It can be carried by males and females and
can be cured with antibiotics. Here are some other facts about gonorrhea:
 Each year, 650,000 new cases of gonorrhea are diagnosed.
 Gonorrhea is diagnosed second only in frequency to chlamydia.
 Like chlamydia, gonorrhea in women can cause PID, leading to tubal
damage. Most doctors test for gonorrhea and chlamydia before doing
common fertility tests such as a hysterosalpingogram (HSG), in which
dye is injected into the uterus and fallopian tubes to see whether there
47
Chapter 3: Practicing Positive Behaviors — Before Conception

are any irregularities. (We discuss HSGs in more detail in Chapter 11.)
If you have gonorrhea or chlamydia and push dye into the tubes and
uterus, you may push the infection up also and end up with more tube
or uterine damage than you had to begin with.
 Men with gonorrhea usually have a discharge from the penis and a burn-
ing sensation; women may have no symptoms.
Syphilis
Syphilis is caused by the bacterium Treponema pallidum. The bacterium can
be transmitted through genital, oral, or anal contact. Syphilis is easily cured
with penicillin. Contrary to folklore, syphilis can’t be caught from a toilet
seat. But consider the following:
 Syphilis can cause stillbirth, blindness, mental retardation, or chronic
syphilis in your unborn child if you have this disease while pregnant. Syph-
ilis is treated with antibiotics.
 Lest you think syphilis is a thing of the past, 35,000 cases were reported in
the United States in 1999, with 556 cases of congenital syphilis in newborns.
Genital herpes
Genital herpes is caused by the herpes simplex type 2 virus. The cold sores
some people are prone to on their lips are caused by the herpes simplex type
1 virus (although you can get genital herpes with type 1 and cold sores with
type 2, STD’s don’t always play by the rules!). Scientists are working on a vac-
cine against herpes, which would work only for those not already infected
with the virus. Here’s some more information:
 Sixty million Americans are infected with genital herpes, with 500,000
new cases diagnosed each year.
 If you have an outbreak of genital herpes at the time your baby is ready
to be delivered, you’ll need to have a cesarean section; if you deliver
vaginally without treatment, your baby may suffer from mental retarda-
tion or may die.
 Herpes can’t be cured; outbreaks are treated with antiviral medications.
HIV
Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) causes the disease AIDS (acquired
immune deficiency syndrome). At present, there is no cure for AIDS, although
antiviral medications may keep the disease under control for some time.
48
Part I: Are We There Yet? Wondering Why You’re Not Pregnant 

Check out the following facts about HIV and pregnancy:
 Women with HIV can become pregnant and carry the pregnancy to term,
but they risk transmitting HIV to the baby.
 The risk of transmission is about 25 percent if you’re untreated but may
be reduced dramatically if you receive AZT, an antiviral drug, while
you’re pregnant.
 Some doctors believe that the stress of pregnancy may cause your
symptoms to worsen.
 You may reduce the risk of transmission of the disease to your baby if
you have a cesarean section rather than a vaginal delivery.
 You must wait 3 to 18 months after delivery to find out whether your baby
is HIV positive, because during pregnancy your antibodies are passed to
the baby. This means that all babies of HIV-infected moms will test posi-
tive at birth. It can take as long as 18 months for all your antibodies to
disappear from your baby’s blood. After your antibodies are all gone, if
the baby tests positive, it means he or she is infected with the virus.
You can be tested for sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV, before
trying to conceive. If you suspect that you may have an STD, or have been
exposed to one, you need to rule out this potential danger to your fertility
and your unborn child.
Ureaplasma and mycoplasma
Ureaplasma and mycoplasma are microorganisms that can affect different
parts of the body, depending on the strain. The genital tracts of both sexes
can carry mycoplasma or ureaplasma. The following list gives some other
information about the diseases:
 As many as 40 percent of women and men are carriers of bacteria called
ureaplasma or mycoplasma.
 Some controversy exists about whether certain strains of ureaplasma and
mycoplasma cause problems in getting pregnant; some studies show
that they increase the incidence of miscarriage and/or problems with
the embryo implanting in the uterus. This seems to be related to either
partner having the infection, which is easily passed between partners.
 There’s no scientific data to prove that either ureaplasma or
mycoplasma reduces fertility.
 As with other STDs, both partners are easily treated with a 14-day
course of an antibiotic, such as doxycycline. Both partners must take
the drug, or they’ll probably continue to reinfect each other.
49
Chapter 3: Practicing Positive Behaviors — Before Conception

Looking at Everyday Lifestyle Issues
Most everyone knows about drinking, smoking, and drugs being bad for you
when you’re trying to get pregnant. In this section, we talk about a few things
that affect getting pregnant of which you might not be aware. 
Cutting back on caffeine
Caffeine is controversial, but several studies have suggested that drinking
several cups of coffee a day may increase the risk of developing difficulty
becoming pregnant and early miscarriage. A cup of coffee contains twice the
caffeine of one can of soda. Limit caffeine to less than 300 mg, which is three
cups of coffee, or, better yet, cut it out completely! Teas also contain caffeine,
but much less than coffee — 12 to 100 mg per cup.
Staying out of the hot tub
Anything that raises the temperature of a man’s testicles can decrease sperm
production and motility. Hot tubs, saunas, steam rooms, and tight underwear
are out for men! And in case you’re thinking of jumping in the tub without
him, high temperatures have also been associated with egg damage and mis-
carriage. Find another way to relax when you’re pregnant or trying to be.
Exercising with caution
So your partner decided to work out stress by bicycling or playing rugby.
This exercise should be a good thing, right? Wrong! Prolonged cycling can
cause damage to the groin from constant pressure of the bike seat, and con-
tact sports can lead to injury to the testicles and can damage sperm 
production.
Women who exercise heavily may find that their periods have stopped. This
condition is called amenorrhea and is common among women who are very
thin and exercise daily. Obviously, you can’t get pregnant if you’re not having
periods; you’re not making any eggs. So what can you both do to reduce
stress that won’t cause fertility problems? Knitting is nice. If knitting isn’t
enough for you, exercise in moderation is fine — for both of you!
50
Part I: Are We There Yet? Wondering Why You’re Not Pregnant 

Dumping the douche
Douching is a bad idea whether you’re trying to get pregnant or not. Women
who douche regularly have a 73 percent increase in pelvic inflammatory dis-
ease (PID), which can cause damage to the fallopian tubes and uterus. The
ectopic pregnancy rate is about 75 percent higher in women who douche reg-
ularly. Thirty-seven percent of women between the ages of 15 and 44 douche,
and their risk of developing cervical cancer is about 80 percent higher than
those who don’t. Dump the douche!
Checking prescription medications
Have you overlooked something that could be interfering with your getting
pregnant? Think back a few months, especially when thinking about sperm
production; the sperm being ejaculated today have been over two months in
the making, so anything your partner was taking a few months ago could be
affecting his sperm count today. Ask yourself the following questions about a
few possible deterrents you may not have thought about:
 Has your partner taken antibiotics, such as erythromycin or gentamycin,
or antifungal medications, such as ketoconazole, or been treated for pso-
riasis with methotrexate? Has he been on anabolic steroids? These medi-
cines can all affect sperm production.
 Does your partner take medication for high blood pressure? Sometimes,
when you’ve been taking a medication for a long time, you almost forget
that it can have serious side effects. Men who take certain types of anti-
hypertensives called calcium channel blockers may produce sperm that
can’t penetrate eggs well; other high blood pressure medications may
cause retrograde ejaculation, a condition in which the semen is pushed
backwards into the bladder instead of being ejaculated out; or may
cause an inability to get and sustain an erection. Other antihypertensive
drugs are available that don’t have these effects. Suggest that your part-
ner talk to his doctor about switching medications if possible.
 Are you using a lubricant for sex? Lubricants are helpful because inade-
quate lubrication during sex can cause vaginal abrasions, and can lead
to yeast infections. There are lubricants specifically manufactured for
couples trying to conceive, which are supposed to be less likely to slow
sperm down in their race to the egg.
51
Chapter 3: Practicing Positive Behaviors — Before Conception

Avoiding toxins in the workplace
Changing your job isn’t always easy, but you do need to consider potential
exposure to dangerous substances and take steps to protect yourself from
them. Here are some examples:
 Think about substances that you’re exposed to at work. For instance, if
you’re a home remodeler, bridge painter, welder, or solderer, you may be
exposed to large amounts of lead. You run the same risk if you’re remod-
eling an old house and scraping old paint off the walls. Lead exposure
in men has been linked to low sperm count and decreased motility of
sperm. In women, lead exposure may cause low birth weight in babies,
high blood pressure during pregnancy, damage to the baby’s nervous
system, and developmental delays.
 Healthcare workers are exposed to a number of potentially dangerous
drugs, as are pharmacists; exposure to chemotherapy drugs, radiation
from X-rays, or inhaled anesthetics used in the operating room all can
contribute to infertility.
Reducing stress
Can stress keep you from getting pregnant? Severe stress can change your
menstrual cycle, even make you skip a few cycles. Every cycle you skip means
one less chance to get pregnant, since you’re not making an egg that month.
What can you do to reduce stress? We talk more about stress reducing tech-
niques in Chapter 8, but in general:
 Talk it out. Stress increases when you hold everything in.
 Try to focus on the “big picture.” When you’re trying to get pregnant,
every failed month seems like a year — or the end of the world. When
you finally do get pregnant, it won’t matter whether you got pregnant in
November or January. Remember that the odds are on your side, in most
cases, and that you will get pregnant.
 Don’t lose sight of the rest of your life. While trying to have a baby may
be a big part of your life at this moment, it’s not the only thing you have
going on in your life. Make time for your family, your partner, your friends,
your hobbies — and anything else that helps you remember that you
had a life before you started thinking about pregnancy, and you still do!
Getting Checked Out From Top to Bottom 
Having a checkup even before you try to get pregnant is always a good idea,
and it’s essential if you’ve been trying for a few months and still getting “not
52
Part I: Are We There Yet? Wondering Why You’re Not Pregnant 

pregnant” results on the home pregnancy tests. Sometimes simple imbal-
ances in your thyroid levels, or other levels easily checked by a simple blood
test, can be keeping you from getting pregnant.
Having a full physical
You can see either your primary care physician (PCP) or your gynecologist
for a check up — or both! Your PCP looks at the “big picture” while your GYN
looks mainly at your reproductive issues. Either one can order blood work
and do a physical exam. (See Chapter 8 for more on choosing a doctor to
help you get pregnant.)
Do you need to book a full body MRI or CT scan to find out if you’re in shape
to get pregnant? No, a half hour with your doctor should do the trick. If you’re
putting off a visit because you’re afraid of being “yelled at” because you’re
overweight, have bad habits you know you’ll be lectured about, or are terri-
fied of having blood drawn, now is the time to put those fears aside. 
A simple checkup by your gynecologist or family doctor may be all you need
to help you get pregnant; for example, your doctor can look at the following
possible pregnancy stumbling blocks:
 Your weight: Are you underweight or overweight? Being either over- or
underweight may interfere with pregnancy.
 Your sexual practices: Are you missing the big day each month because
you’ve been misinformed about when you ovulate?
 Your sexual history: Do you have a sexually transmitted infection (STD)
that could be preventing pregnancy? (See the section, “Complicating
Things through Common Infections” for more on STDs.)
 Your habits: Do you douche right after sex? You may be washing some
of the best swimmers away!
 Your blood pressure: Women with high blood pressure may be prone to
developing serious hypertensive disease during pregnancy.
Checking your blood levels
The good thing about having blood drawn is that a single specimen can be
used to test for many different health conditions, including some that can
interfere with getting pregnant; we look at a few in the next sections.
Looking at your thyroid function 
Women who have an underactive or overactive thyroid may have trouble get-
ting pregnant. Thyroid abnormalities can cause anovulation (no egg is released)
53
Chapter 3: Practicing Positive Behaviors — Before Conception

irregular menstrual cycles or short menstrual cycles. (See Chapter 2 for more
about menstrual dysfunction).
Hypothyroid, or low thyroid levels, can raise your prolactin level (prolactin is
a hormone that helps control milk production in breastfeeding women). High
prolactin levels can prevent ovulation; prolactin levels can be diagnosed with
a blood test.
Running a chemistry panel
A chemistry panel tests your blood sugar to show if you have diabetes; it also
tests your liver and kidney functions. Many health problems that can impact
on pregnancy can be found through a chemistry panel.
Checking your blood count
A complete blood count, or CBC, tests your hemoglobin, which shows if
you’re anemic. It also tests your white blood count, which can show chronic
infection.
Deciding if you need a mammogram
It’s not essential to have a mammogram before getting pregnant, but it can’t
hurt, especially if you’re over the age of 40 or if you have a family history of
breast cancer. 
During the time of your pregnancy (10 months), along with the time you plan
to breastfeed, mammograms will not be a good option. This could be one to
two years, depending on how long you choose to nurse. Talk to your OB/GYN
about this before you get pregnant, as he/she may elect to do a baseline
mammogram prior to conceiving.

Infertility

of infertility
I
n the immortal words of Baseball’s Yogi Berra “It’s Déjà vu all over again!”
For many, Yogi’s words perfectly describe the struggle with secondary
infertility, or difficulty getting pregnant a second time . . . or a third. 
Although exact numbers are difficult to pin down, experts estimate that in
2005 about 3 million people suffer from secondary infertility (less than half
the number that suffers from primary infertility). According to Resolve, a
national infertility organization, that figure represents an increase from an
estimated 1.8 million in 1995. In this chapter, we define secondary infertility
and then take a closer look at its emotional impact, as well as what you can
do to deal with the merry-go-round of infertility — take two.
Defining Secondary Infertility
Secondary infertility is defined as the condition where a woman is unable to
get pregnant or carry a pregnancy to term after already having had one or
more children. Some experts put the added caveat of “after 12 months of
trying to conceive naturally on their own,” to better qualify the term. Some
experts define secondary infertility as occurring anytime after a previous
conception, whether that conception ended in a birth or a miscarriage.

Secondary infertility can occur whether the first conception was difficult or
easy. It can be due to female issues, male issues, or a combination of both.
Whatever the exact nature of the definition, few disagree that secondary
infertility, whether an adjunct to primary infertility or a new challenge all its
own, can be a confounding and painful experience that seems to prevent
many from creating the complete family of their dreams. 
Facing Secondary Infertility
Knowing what you’re dealing with, particularly if it is secondary infertility,
doesn’t make it any easier. Often, if a woman had little to no problem conceiv-
ing a first or second child, the diagnosis of secondary infertility can be con-
fusing. If there were problems the first time around, facing them again can be
too much to bear. In the following sections, we discuss some of the different
challenges that secondary infertility can present.
Will it feel as bad as it did the first time?
Secondary infertility can be as bad or worse as dealing with infertility the
first time around. Coping with secondary infertility after the pain of infertility
sometimes seems unbearable. Perhaps you thought that despite the five
years of trying to conceive baby number 1, baby number 2 would just miracu-
lously appear one day. Sometimes that is the case and conceiving and giving
birth to number 1 seems to open the floodgates. More often than not, how-
ever, patterns tend to repeat themselves, including the ‘pattern’ of primary
infertility.
The obvious answer is to try the exact same plan that worked for you the
first time. If you want to try on your own, hoping for the possible reprieve
from Infertility, Part 2, go ahead. But, for your peace of mind and for the sake
of giving yourself the best opportunity within a reasonable amount of time,
set some parameters. If you haven’t conceived naturally within 6 months to a
year (less time if you’re over 40), consider going back to the drawing board
and/or the original “architect,” whether that be your primary physician,
OB/GYN, or reproductive endocrinologist. 
Until you’ve given the tried and tested method another go-round, this proba-
bly isn’t the time to switch doctors, switch protocols, or go out on a brand
new limb. Give the old method at least a few tries before discussing moving
to different options with your physician or before you discuss moving to a
different physician with your partner.
56
Part I: Are We There Yet? Wondering Why You’re Not Pregnant 

But it worked before . . . 
Perhaps one of the most confusing physiological and psychological dilemmas
occurs when something worked before and suddenly, apparently without
reason, ceases to be effective. 
Those struggling with secondary infertility commonly lament:
“We conceived the first month we tried.” 
“All my husband had to do was look at me and we got pregnant with our
first two.” 
“Conceiving a child was never the problem with us.”
Sometimes secondary infertility seems to defy proper or satisfying explana-
tions; other than being a year or two older than you were the last time you
had a baby, nothing seems to have changed. Other times, getting to baby
number one might have been a challenge, and the fact that it’s not going to
be easier the second time around is disappointing, but not unexpected.
Some healthcare providers deny the existence of secondary infertility, claim-
ing that it is actually primarily infertility where the patient “got lucky” the
first time around. From an emotional standpoint, that line of reasoning is akin
to telling a victim of a disease that his or her condition is not valid. 
One thing that can be taken from this line of thinking, however, is a careful
review of your first successful go-round. Ask yourself the following:
 Was it as easy as it seemed the first time or is that merely in comparison
to the current struggle of secondary infertility?
 Did you miscarry two or more times on the way to a healthy baby? Were
these miscarriages investigated and found to be due to chromosomal
abnormalities, which increase with age? 
 Was it ever suggested, prior to conception, that there might be issues
that could cause a problem in conceiving or carrying a child (for exam-
ple, abnormal hormonal levels; structural issues in the uterus, ovaries,
or fallopian tubes; a family history of infertility; and so on)?
It’s not uncommon to disregard a previous observation, even if it was made
by a medical professional, particularly if their diagnosis proved to be wrong,
and the proof is now pulling all the pots and pans out of your cabinet and
trying to flush them down the toilet. It’s even more common to ignore a
family member’s recollection of history (for example, every woman on your
mother’s side went into menopause at the age of 35) if you seem to be the
exception. 
57
Chapter 4: Struggling with Secondary Infertility

Conduct your own investigation if you feel that you might have overlooked a
comment or a speculation the first time around. Ask your partner if you can’t
remember correctly or check with whatever physician whose care you were
under prior to the conception of your first child. You may also see this as an
opportunity to open or re-open discussion with family members to get an
accurate picture of your genetic history when it comes to reproduction. You
may well end up finding out that you do indeed have a clean bill of health,
but you may also uncover information that could help you get to the bottom
of secondary infertility. 
Looking for What’s Different 
This Time Around
So the reproductive system isn’t working like it used to — what could be the
problem? Similar to primary infertility, the answer to secondary infertility
could take awhile and fill up at least an entire book such as this one. But, for
the sake of getting to the point, we list some quick and perhaps not so obvi-
ous possibilities.
Changes in age
Unless (or even if) your last child was born six weeks ago, time does march
on! And from an infertility point of view, that’s never a good thing. One of the
primary reasons for secondary infertility is the age of the mother. Age-related
male infertility can also be a consideration, although Father Time does seem
to be a bit more forgiving when it comes to the dads. Regardless of whose age
we’re discussing, by definition, both you and your partner (should both par-
ties remain the same!) will be older when you try to conceive your next child.
As we have seen in preceding chapters, fertility declines throughout the
years, so the baby that popped up so easily in your 20s, might not be as
forthcoming in your 30s or 40s. The longer the interval between children, the
more likely that time is not on your side. The fact that you have conceived,
carried, and delivered a baby are certainly positive predictors of your ability
to do so, but realize that many cite the age of the mother as the primary
reason for reproductive success. Is this true? Only time will tell.
Remember, your age isn’t an admonishment. Family planning is all about the
spacing of children to fit with your lifestyle, finances and capabilities. Having
children back to back is not necessarily the best thing to do, for your health
and well being and that of your family. Most physicians recommend a mini-
mum of one year in between pregnancies in order to allow your body to heal.
Considering that sex is a no-no for the first six weeks after delivering, those
58
Part I: Are We There Yet? Wondering Why You’re Not Pregnant 

that have a 10-month difference in the age of their children are ignoring 
someone’s advice. While age is certainly a large factor in planning your
family, it can’t be the only thing. 
So what now? You’re older and having problems. As with primary infertility, 
if you are over the age of 35 and have not conceived after trying naturally for
six months, it might be time to visit your primary care physician, OB/GYN, or
reproductive endocrinologist. They will likely run the same battery of tests
on you that they would on a patient that presented with primary infertility.
Be patient. You want a thorough report, not a speedy one. The difference in
two weeks will not a difference make!
Changes in health
As with primary infertility, your overall health does make a difference. While
you may still be living the clean life, it doesn’t mean that your body hasn’t
undergone changes all its own. Have you had an increase or decrease in your
weight? As we discuss in previous chapters, BMI (body mass index) can cer-
tainly play a part in your fertility or lack thereof. Have you suddenly become
a marathon or long-distance runner? This too can affect your metabolism and
your body’s responses, including the reproductive ones. While these can be
positive health changes, they can also upset the delicate balance to which
your body may be clinging. Take a look at any lifestyle changes, good or bad,
and discuss them with your physician to see if therein lies the culprit.
Occult, or not yet uncovered, chronic or acute illness can also play a role in
reversing your fertility. Diabetes, autoimmune disease such as lupus, thyroid
problems, and a host of other issues, large and small, can also affect your
ability to conceive and could be brewing without your knowledge. If you haven’t
had a complete physical workup, as well as a gynecological one, now would
be the time. 
Are you fresh from your first, or last, pregnancy? Still breastfeeding? Or burn-
ing the midnight oil trying to rock Junior to sleep? Again, even subtle changes
such as a shift in your sleep patterns can wreak havoc on your system, which
can leave your fertility in less than fighting shape. Another thing to consider
and discuss with your OB/GYN is any lasting effects from your previous preg-
nancy(ies). Could you have developed adhesions as a result of a caesarian
section? Did you have problems with excessive bleeding that might indicate
unresolved issues? Make sure that you check out as normal from your last
foray into baby making before jumping into the next. 
The other large category of problems in secondary infertility is the status of
the pelvic organs: Are you having abnormal bleeding (especially between
periods) that might be indicative of a fibroid or a polyp in your uterus? Have
59
Chapter 4: Struggling with Secondary Infertility

you had any kind of abdominal surgery since your last delivery (appendec-
tomy, gall bladder surgery, ovarian cyst removal)? All surgery is associated
with a risk of scarring (adhesions), which may either block the fallopian
tubes or pull them away from the ovaries so that they cannot pick up the
ovulated eggs. The good news is that all of these conditions can be identified
with the use of appropriate diagnostic tests that your doctor can order.
Throughout the process of secondary infertility, make it a point to take opti-
mal care of yourself through nutrition, rest, and exercise. You will need to be
in tiptop shape to handle children in multiple forms; this would be a good
time to start the process.
Changes in partners
No, we’re not suggesting you go out and look for a new partner if you’re not
getting pregnant the second time. But you may be focusing on the wrong part
of the equation, if you’re only thinking about what’s different with you this
time around. Remember, primary infertility is split fairly evenly between
women’s issues, men’s issues, and those issues that are shared by both. If
you have changed partners since your last child, perhaps the problem lies
with your other half. Has he recently taken up running marathons? Has he
developed a passion for spending hours in the Jacuzzi? Has he built a Finnish
spa in the backyard and loves to sit in it and read “War and Peace”? 
Even if you’re with the same partner, once again, age can play a factor with
men as well. More recent studies have shown that men over 40 have a decrease
in the motility and morphology of sperm, reducing their fertile potential. In
addition, DNA changes that come with age can also negatively impact a man’s
sperm, making it abnormal and less likely to fertilize an egg. 
And, just as with you, your partner’s health status can change over time as
well, having a less-than-desirable effect on his contribution to the baby mix.
If you’ve been checked out in all areas, maybe it’s time to check, or re-check,
dear old dad.
Hurting Just As Much: 
The Emotional Pain
“I’ll be happy when . . .” 
It’s easy to place caveats on joy, particularly when it comes to getting what
you want. Remember when you thought/said/prayed/swore that if you could
60
Part I: Are We There Yet? Wondering Why You’re Not Pregnant 

only conceive this one child, you would never ask for anything again? Like
many “foxhole prayers,” it’s easy to forget previous promises. It’s human
nature. 
While some couples are more relaxed the second time around, others bring
the same intensity to conceiving number 2 (or number 3!). As with everything
in life, it’s how you see the situation . . . is the cradle half empty or half full? 
Longing for another child
“Another child is a bonus,” a friend once said in describing her desire to have
another child. Her belief is that she and husband are forever grateful for their
beautiful daughter, and their one and only has given them their dream and a
wonderful life to go along with it. This friend has not conceived again since
her four-year-old daughter was born, but she has stood by her promise.
While she may occasionally dream of giving her child a sibling, she is ulti-
mately happy and satisfied. 
While this mindset may be an ideal, it is certainly not shared by most and
more often forgotten by many. Secondary infertility can, and often is, every
bit as painful as the first go-round. Some friends have said that it can be even
more difficult. Suddenly, you are thrust into the world of children where
everything seems to come in pairs, if not higher multiples. The “lonely only”
child is regarded by many in the child-abundant world as somehow missing
out, whether it be in social interaction or family dynamics. 
You can’t miss out on what you don’t have. Children without siblings tend to
be higher achievers, quite social, and often leaders in society. And you can
certainly have spoiled, lonely, or maladjusted children, even amongst large
sibling groups. “I don’t want my only child to grow up spoiled,” whine many
parents. Yet, upon having baby number 2, many of these families find that
indeed they don’t have one spoiled child anymore, they now have two!
Remember, history repeats itself. Don’t assume that another child will mirac-
ulously convert you . . . or your parenting skills. That’s a job that YOU have
to do, whether with one child or twenty. 
Losing support the second time
Another emotional dilemma of secondary infertility can be the lack of sup-
port by those who once mopped your tears. “Be thankful for the child you
have,” family and friends may snap at you impatiently. It’s hard to explain
that you’re immensely grateful and through the joy of conceiving, delivering,
and raising your first son or daughter, you have awakened your own inner
parent, one that dreams of adding to the flock. 
61
Chapter 4: Struggling with Secondary Infertility

You can’t quantify pain, particularly not that of another. Many women grieve
as much for the inability to have child number 3 as others do for number 1.
Dreams are highly personal and don’t generally adjust themselves too easily
to life’s ups and downs. But, explaining that to family and friends who don’t
understand can be as challenging as any other aspect of secondary infertility.
Even “classic” forms of support, including the internet, often disregard those
suffering from secondary infertility, claiming that at “least” they have a child. 
You are not alone. Look for specific friends and organizations, whether online
or in person, that address some of the issues of secondary infertility. You may
be surprised, upon getting to know other parents in your child’s playgroup,
to find that others have or are dealing with the same issues. 
After a particularly painful second-trimester loss of a second child, Jackie
was swinging her daughter Ava in the park one day in between two pregnant
mothers (just for the record, Jackie was there first!). As Jackie quietly
bemoaned her fate, feeling sorry for herself and simultaneously jealous of
these strangers, she found herself eavesdropping on their conversation.
One of the mothers was sharing how she was just approaching the “critical”
point of her pregnancy. As she appeared to be ready to pop, Jackie was a bit
confused and continued her nosy vigil. Apparently, she had prematurely
delivered her last child at seven months and the baby had not made it. This
woman, who Jackie saw as filled with baby and with hope, had endured an
even greater tragedy than Jackie had. This is a good reminder to not measure
your insides against another’s outsides. 
Wanting an Heir and a Spare? 
“I want another child,” Jackie cried out, only weeks after her long-awaited
daughter was born (following a three-and-a-half year battle with primary
infertility). “That’s because you haven’t spent enough time caring for the one
you have yet,” laughed Sharon, “Wait a year.” Sharon was right. Those first
few weeks of babydom were filled with all of the promised dreams of baby
food commercials everywhere. Jackie and her husband often looked down
upon their (then) sleeping baby and commented that if only they “could,”
they’d have many more. And then the long-awaited daughter came to. 
Seriously, the next few months were consumed with feeding issues, sleeping
issues, adjustment issues, family issues, and so on. We could barely imagine
how we could care for the child we had, let alone another. In case you’re won-
dering the same thing, we give you some good reasons to not rush into trying
for another child:
62
Part I: Are We There Yet? Wondering Why You’re Not Pregnant 

 Underestimating the responsibility and work of a new baby: Perhaps
this is one of the reasons why sex is forbidden in the six weeks following
delivery. If it wasn’t, maybe in that pink (or blue) cloud of new parenting,
second babies would be sprouting up everywhere! 
 Wanting to have a spare: As a friend of multiples pointed out, doubling
your child load doesn’t “halve” your fears of bad things happening. It
actually doubles your fears, since it doubles your love. 
 Trying for that elusive son or daughter: Trying again just for another
gender is a sure way to set yourself up for disappointment. You need
look only as far as Jackie’s poor grandmother who birthed seven daugh-
ters prior to finally producing a male heir. Jackie’s uncle didn’t marry
until much later in life and then decided to limit himself to one child
who he adores — who is a daughter and who will not continue the family
name anyway! 
 Giving your child a playmate: As an only child myself, I (co-author
Jackie) always imagined the “luxury” of having a sibling to share my joys
and the responsibilities of dealing with my parents as time went on. All I
needed to clear up that misconception was time and eyesight. For as
many inseparable siblings that exist, so do those that never speak at all.
Biology is no guarantee of love or friendship. Nor is it a promise of com-
mitment. Most families that I have encountered are made up of one child
that bears many of the family burdens, including mending fences, deal-
ing with aging relatives and facilitating communication throughout the
flock. Seldom are those responsibilities equally divided. The other lack
of equality is in perception. I often wished for a sibling to share my views
on my parents, our home and life itself. Yet, it seems that there are as many
different views of a family as there are members. Being raised together
and/or in the exact same way does not guarantee a shared vision.
Ideally, the parents of multiple children truly enjoy the experience of
raising each child as an individual as well as part of a family. Giving your
child a playmate is an added bonus to having more than one child, but
not a reason in and of itself. Wanting to share your love again and again
is cause for trying again, whatever the process of again might entail.
So, if siblings and families bring no promise of inherited closeness through
thick and thin, then what are the reasons to duplicate or triplicate your
efforts in the area of reproduction? We give you some good reasons in the list
that follows:
 There is a joy and warmth that can come in larger and extended fami-
lies. If having a houseful of people around all the time makes you happy,
a houseful of kids will guarantee it — at least until they grow up and
leave the nest.
63
Chapter 4: Struggling with Secondary Infertility

 Siblings take off the pressure that only children are sometimes subject
to — the pressure to be all things to their parents, the total fulfillment of
every pre-parent dream.
 Siblings can teach each other valuable life lessons — as well as some
not so valuable ones. Sibling influence isn’t always beneficial!
 You just want another baby. There’s nothing wrong with that, as long as
you remember that a new baby will, like the first, grow into an individual
person with quirks and characteristics that may have you wondering
why you thought this was a good idea in the first place!

A
fter you start trying to get pregnant, you expect results — that’s human
nature. But Mother Nature isn’t always on your timetable, and you may
find yourself still trying after a few months, and anxious to step up the pace a
bit with some scientific aids. In this chapter, you can find out about some
low-tech but helpful methods of trying to pin down an elusive positive preg-
nancy test.
Many women can read their bodies’ signals well enough to pinpoint ovulation
almost to the minute; others need scientific aids to help pin down exactly
when they’re ovulating. We discuss both the simple and the scientific in this
chapter. 
We also look at how all this planning may affect the romance in your relation-
ship and give you some ideas for keeping the spark alive. In addition, we help
you avoid sparks in your relationships with family and friends when you’re
under stress, and give advice about living through major stressors like the
holidays — or your friends’ baby showers.
Ovulation is the monthly release of an egg from your ovary. Ovulation is the
one time during the month that you can actually get pregnant. Your window
of opportunity is approximately two to three days.

Reading Your Body’s Signals and Signs
Sharon had a patient tell her that the patient’s family doctor told her just to
have sex on day 14 of her cycle if she wanted to get pregnant. While this
advice might work for some women, it was a complete bust for Sharon’s
patient, who ovulated around day 10, because she had short menstrual
cycles. (See Chapter 2 for a thorough discussion of menstrual cycles and
their variations.)
Despite popular belief, not all women ovulate on day 14 of their cycles. And
knowing when you ovulate is crucial to your success in getting pregnant
because sperm and egg can only get together if they’re both in the same place
at the same time. Having sex too early — or as little as one day too late —
can reduce your chance of success. 
This doesn’t mean you have to have sex at a precise instance, or even a pre-
cise day, to get pregnant. Pregnancy rates are the same whether couples have
sex on the day of ovulation, the day before, or two days before, so you have a
window of several days on which to have sex. We hope this will take some
“performance anxiety” off both of you! 
Planning with “natural” methods — 
get out the calendar
Some women can chart their periods back for years; they religiously mark an
“X” on the calendar when their period starts, and they always know exactly
when their next period is due. Others are always surprised when their peri-
ods start, either because their cycles are irregular or because they never
mark anything down on the calendar.
If you’re the regular, record-keeping type, it will be easy for you to figure out
when you’re ovulating. If you’re irregular and/or disorganized, it may take
you a month or two to determine when you’re ovulating. Never fear, though;
your body has ways of telling you when ovulation is approaching, and we can
help even the most irregular/disorganized women figure it out.
Counting the days — correctly
Most women ovulate 14 days before the start of a new menstrual cycle. So if
your cycles are 28 days apart, you ovulate on or about day 14; if your cycles
are 25 days long, you ovulate earlier, around day 11. If your cycles are long,
like 33 days, you don’t ovulate until day 19. This is why it’s so easy to miss
the right day for conception; most women don’t have on-the-dot, regular-as-
clockwork periods, and may ovulate on a different day each month. 
68
Part II: Stepping Up Your Efforts 

To figure out when you’re most likely to be ovulating, you need to keep track
of your menstrual cycles each month. This will give you an idea of when
you’re most likely to ovulate. This, combined with simple observation of your
fertility signs, can result in success if you’ve just been missing the mark
every month.
Determining the shelf life of eggs and sperm
Do you have to have sex at the exact moment of ovulation to get pregnant?
No, thank goodness, or getting pregnant would be much harder than it already
is! Fortunately both sperm and egg have a lifespan that, although short, allows
them to stick around long enough to meet even if your timing isn’t perfect.
Sperm live longer than eggs; in the proper cervical mucus (we talk about cer-
vical mucus more in the section “Observing cervical mucus”), sperm can live
as long as five days, although two to three days is a more average lifespan
for sperm. So you can have sex up to a few days before ovulation and have
sperm ready and waiting for an egg to appear.
Eggs, on the other hand, go bad fast; after ovulation, eggs live only 24 hours
or so. That means that if you have sex more than a few hours after ovulation,
there won’t be time for sperm to reach the egg before it disintegrates.
Timing is everything — but don’t make it too complicated!
The proper timing is necessary to get pregnant, but you don’t have to have
sex at the exact moment of ovulation to improve your chances. Pregnancy
rates are the same whether couples have sex on the day of ovulation, the day
before, or two days before. In contrast, having sex just one day too late (after
ovulation) results in no pregnancies.
It’s better (and probably less nerve wracking) to have sperm waiting for the
egg by having sex every other day around the time you’re expecting to ovu-
late, or even all month, if you’re feeling that energetic! There’s no evidence
that having sex too often decreases the chances for pregnancy, although it
does decrease the sperm count.
The point is that although timing is essential, you don’t need to spend the
whole month on pins and needles, wondering if now is the right time for con-
ception. Predicting ovulation is a matter of watching the calendar and having
a rough idea when you might be ovulating and observing your body’s natural
signals that precede ovulation.
Observing your body’s natural signals
So what are all these signals that your body puts out before ovulation? Don’t
worry — they’re not a secret, and you can easily learn to watch for them.
69
Chapter 5: Trying Simple Techniques in Not-So-Simple Situations

Most occur a day or so before ovulation, so you have plenty of warning before
the big day (or night). 
Taking your morning temperature
Recording your basal body temperature (BBT) is one of the oldest methods
of predicting ovulation. Sharon remembers doing this before getting pregnant
with her son, who is now over 30 years old! A basal body temperature is just
a long-winded way of saying your individual normal temperature. You use the
same type of thermometer you do whenever you take your temperature to
find out whether you have a fever when you’re not feeling well.
This method of predicting ovulation is simple but requires a certain amount
of determination and a good memory. You need to remember to take your
temperature every morning before you get up. Most doctors recommend that
you not get up, eat, drink, or smoke before taking your temperature because
any activity at all will raise your temperature, and eating or drinking will raise
or lower it, depending on what you had.
Some doctors also recommend buying a special BBT thermometer, which has
larger numbers and reads only up to 100 degrees or so. Each one-tenth of a
degree is much easier to read on this type of thermometer. You don’t need a
BBT thermometer, but it’s nice to have if your temperature doesn’t fluctuate
much or if your eyesight is going.
Many charts are available to help you chart your temperature (you can just
use the one we’ve provided in the front of this book!), but you can easily
make one yourself. Here’s what you do:
1. Draw a graph. You can use graph paper or just draw the lines yourself;
you’re not going to be graded on neatness!
2. Mark off spaces for 30 days. Use more if your periods run longer. Mark
these spaces on the bottom of the page (horizontal).
3. Mark off spaces for temperature readings from between 97 degrees
and 99.5 degrees in 1/10th increments down the side of the paper
(vertically).
4. Take your temperature before getting out of bed in the morning, or
before performing any other activities.
5. Mark down your morning temperature to the exact one-tenth of a
degree.
6. Connect the “dots.” You’ll notice that your temperature is lowest when
your period first starts. 
7. Have sex every other day, to cover all the bases.
8. Look for a subtle drop in temperature, followed by a sustained rise in
temperature, meaning a rise for more than three days. Your tempera-
ture should rise at least 0.5 degrees and remain elevated. The drop
70
Part II: Stepping Up Your Efforts 

occurs around ovulation, and the rise indicates an increase in your prog-
esterone levels.
9. If you’re having sex every other day, you should be “covered” at the
time of ovulation by having waiting sperm ready for the released egg.
If you’ve been a little lax in this, make sure you have sex the day of your
temperature drop.
Even though progesterone increases only after you’ve ovulated, several stud-
ies have found that most women ovulate after the temperature has risen. So
don’t stop trying until the temperature has been high for at least two days.
This method has a few drawbacks: 
 You need to be scrupulous about taking your temperature and record-
ing it so that you don’t forget it.
 You have to keep your chart for the whole month. If you’re the type
who loses things easily, keep a few copies of the chart around in case
you lose one.
 Your temperature can be influenced by factors other than hormones.
If you’re sick, even small temperature fluctuations may make your chart
inaccurate, and you’ll think you’ve ovulated when you actually have the
flu. Alcohol, too little or too much sleep, and subtle illnesses can all
change your temperature.
Your BBT can also give you an idea of whether you’re pregnant. If your tem-
perature stays elevated more than 15 days, there’s a good chance that you’re
pregnant — unless, of course, you have the flu. If your temperature starts to
drop after ten days or so, you may have a luteal phase defect, which means
that your progesterone may be too low to sustain a pregnancy.
If you’re prone to losing paper charts, you may be interested in a digital ther-
mometer that stores your previous temperature. This device is handy in case
you forget to write your temperature down one morning. Digital thermome-
ters are a little more expensive than glass ones, but not more than $7 or $8
for a good one. Or you can “store” your last temperature even with a glass
thermometer by not shaking it down immediately after using it. This tip is
especially convenient if you don’t have time to record your temperature right
away. The mercury will stay at your temperature point until it’s shaken down.
Observing cervical mucus
Cervical mucus changes consistency around the time of ovulation. Right after
your period stops, cervical mucus is very thick, which makes it difficult for
sperm to penetrate. Cervical mucus is normally thick (viscous) because it
protects the uterus from invading bacteria from the vagina.
71
Chapter 5: Trying Simple Techniques in Not-So-Simple Situations

As you get closer to ovulation, cervical mucus becomes thinner, more slip-
pery, and stretchy, and more copious, all of which helps sperm get through it
into the uterus. In addition, all the lubrication makes it easier to have sex —
ingenious, isn’t it?
In addition to becoming thinner and stretchy, cervical mucus becomes more
alkaline, because sperm live longer in an alkaline environment. You can check
the acidity or alkalinity of cervical mucus with an over-the-counter product
called TesTape, which comes in a long thin roll of yellow paper. You tear off a
small piece of the yellow paper and wrap it around the end of your finger. Next,
you reach into your vagina and touch the paper to the end of your cervix.
Then you bring out the piece of paper see whether it turns color. It will first
turn an olive color a few days before ovulation and then turn dark green or
blue when your cervical mucus is alkaline, as it is right before you ovulate.
After ovulation, cervical mucus again becomes thick, cloudy or white in
color, and scant.
Feeling your cervix
If you have no idea how to find your cervix, it’s pretty easy. You just carefully
insert your clean finger into your vagina until you feel a firm bump that feels
somewhat like the end of your nose. That’s your cervix. 
You’ll notice that your cervix itself also changes at different times of the
month; around ovulation, it becomes softer, feeling more like your lips in
firmness, and feels slightly open in the center. You’ll also feel an increase in
moisture. All these changes, like the changes in cervical mucus, help the
sperm get through the cervix.
The cervix also moves to a lower and more central position, so it’s easier to
find with your finger, which means it’s also in a more direct line with ejacu-
lated sperm.
Ouch! I think I ovulated
About 20 percent of women have pain called mittelschmerz (German for
“middle pain”) when they ovulate. The pain seems to be caused by blood and
fluid irritating the tissues around the ovary after it releases from the follicle.
Sometimes a small amount of vaginal bleeding occurs with ovulation, too.
Mittelschmerz can be a very precise way of pinpointing exactly when you
ovulate; the only downside of using mittelschmerz to help you conceive is
that it usually occurs at the time of ovulation. In other words, once you’ve
72
Part II: Stepping Up Your Efforts 

ovulated, the clock is ticking and your egg is on a countdown with destruc-
tion within 24 hours or so, so you’ve got to have sex pretty quickly.
Even though your egg hangs around for 24 hours after ovulation, you can’t
wait that long to have sex and get pregnant, because it takes a little time —
possibly only 15 minutes or so, but still time — for sperm to meet up with the
egg. It’s better to have sex a few hours or a day before ovulation, so the
sperm are ready and waiting.
Keeping a Fertility Chart
Although a fertility chart sounds exotic and complicated, it’s nothing more
than a record of observation of your body’s natural fertility signals: your tem-
perature, your cervical mucus and changes in your cervix itself. You can make
a simple chart yourself, recording your daily temperature on a graph with
cervical changes and mucus written in underneath, or you can download one
of the many fertility charts found on the internet. One place to download a
fertility chart and get some useful information as well is www.ovulation-
calculator.com/fertility-chart.htm
Maybe you write everything down on little pieces of paper and keep losing them
and think you’d do better to keep track of your data on your computer. There
are programs you can download to allow you to keep everything organized
online — just don’t let your boss see you poring over your “data” at work!
Two software titles available on the Internet are TCOYF (Taking Charge of Your
Fertility) Software found at www.tcoyf.com, www.fertilityfriend.com,
and CycleWatch, found at www.cyclewatch.com. All let you download soft-
ware to chart your basal body temperature, cervical mucus, and cervix changes
to let you know that you should “have sex now,” as the software puts it. If you
have an OvaCue II saliva tester (see “Just spit here – the saliva test” for details
on saliva testing), you can buy software to use with it that will let you down-
load your information, chart it, graph it, and print it out.
Predicting Ovulation: Kits, Sticks, 
and Software
Maybe a month of trying to get pregnant has gone by — or maybe two, three,
or four months — and you’re beginning to feel frustrated and even a little
scared that you’re never going to get pregnant. Go back and read the statis-
tics in Chapter 1 to remind yourself that nature is inefficient, and remember
73
Chapter 5: Trying Simple Techniques in Not-So-Simple Situations

that everyone in your family took six months to get pregnant. You may be think-
ing, “That’s all well and good to read about,” but you want to do something
now. There must be something more scientific and more successful that you
can do. You thought that you hit all the “right” days to have sex for the last
few months, but maybe you’re still missing the right day or misinterpreting
your body’s ovulation signs. This section covers a few ways to monitor your
ovulation cycle that are more “scientific” than stretching cervical mucus and
counting calendar days. Hopefully, one will work for you!
Using an ovulation predictor kit
Ovulation predictor kits (OPKs) are a popular way to test if and when you
ovulate. The tests measure the amount of LH (luteinizing hormone) found in
your urine. LH generally rises 24 to 36 hours before ovulation; the rise of LH
is called your LH surge. You should have sex the day or two before ovulation
and the day of ovulation to improve your chances of getting pregnant.
OPKs are easy to find; every drugstore carries them. They use your urine, a
cheap and abundant substance, to test for ovulation. The sticks are small
enough to carry around with you.
The OPKs, or “pee sticks” as they’re called, have some drawbacks. Certain
women, such as women with polycystic ovaries (see Chapter 7), may have a
high LH all the time, so the kits will always be positive. Women over 40 or
those in premature ovarian failure (POF) may also have a higher than normal
LH, because LH and FSH (follicle-stimulating hormone) both rise in POF. Some
tests are also difficult to read, require several steps that need to be carefully
done for good results, or start to show positive only when the LH reaches
40mIU/ml, the International Standard for an LH surge.
Some women may not have a surge that registers as high as 40mIU/ml; look
for kits that register positive at 20mIU/ml.
Most kits show a positive as a line as dark as or darker than the control line.
Read the test at exactly the time indicated; sometimes the lines darken over a
few hours, but that doesn’t mean you’re having a surge.
For many, reading an OPK can be a frustrating test of judgment and trial and
error. Is the test line lighter than the control line? By how much? Is it darker
today than it was yesterday? What about in bright light? All of these may
seem like legitimate questions when determining the right time of ovulation,
but keep in mind that the best indication of a surge is a test line that is as
dark as or darker than the control line. Just like in horseshoes, “almost,”
doesn’t really count.

The kits are harder to use if you don’t have regular cycles; unless you know
approximately when you ovulate each month, you may use up a lot of sticks
trying to figure out when your surge starts. If you have regular cycles, you can
start testing about 16 days before you expect your next period, but if your
cycles are irregular, you need to start testing earlier to make sure that you don’t
miss the big-O day. Table 5-1 can help you determine when to start testing.

OPKs aren’t cheap; they cost about $14 for five sticks. You’ll use one stick
each time you test, and you need to test every 12 to 24 hours around the time
of ovulation to accurately “catch” your surge. Resist the urge to buy the cheaper
kits. They may not register lower LH levels, and they may be much harder to
read. As a result, you use up more sticks because you’re showing all your
friends and asking their opinion on which line is darker. In addition to using
up a lot of sticks, you may use up a lot of friends, too!
OPKs register only when your surge has begun, so you won’t be able to time
sex as accurately for the two days immediately before ovulation. Also, the
strips must be stored at temperatures between 59 and 86 degrees F to ensure
their accuracy, so carrying them around in a purse can be problematic unless
you live in a totally climate-controlled world.
Also remember that the test measures a concentration of LH in the urine.
This means that if the urine is too concentrated (like first morning urine,
which looks dark), the test may show a false positive even if you are not surg-
ing. Along the same line, if your urine is too diluted (looks clear and not
yellow, like if you just finished a 32-ounce soda ), it won’t show a positive
test, even if you’re ovulating. A good rule to follow is to do the test about two
hours after eating, after you haven’t had anything to drink for an hour or so,
and the urine should look yellow, but not too dark.
Adding computer power 
with a fertility monitor
If you want to go a little higher tech than the OPKs, you may be interested in
a fertility monitor. A fertility monitor works a little differently than the standard
OPK. These devices are actually small computers that store data about your
76

Positive levels of some urine OPKs
Many brands of urine ovulation predictor kits
are available. The ones listed below are just a
sampling. The number listed is the amount of
luteinizing hormone needed to make the stick
register a positive surge.

cycle to tell you when you’re going to ovulate. They’re more labor intensive;
you need to start testing the first day of your period and test every day
around the same time. Morning is recommended as the best time to test.
Because they test both estrogen and LH levels, fertility monitors can better
predict ovulation about five days before it occurs, giving you a better chance
to have sex two days before ovulation.
The fertility monitor can be used if you’re taking fertility medications, unlike
some of the one-use OPK urine tests. It also “sets” itself to your cycle if you’re
somewhat irregular.
These monitors are expensive — about $200 — and you also need to buy the
sticks. Like the less expensive kits, they may not be accurate if you are
menopausal or breastfeeding, have polycystic ovaries (see Chapter 7) and a
normally higher than normal LH level, or are taking tetracycline antibiotics,
which means they won’t be able to tell if you’ve released an egg.
Just spit here — the saliva test
This is one of the newest and most interesting ovulation prediction tests out
there; it tests your saliva for a rise in salt content, which rises as your estro-
gen rises. This method has several advantages:
 Carrying this around isn’t too conspicuous. The tube that holds the
lens you place saliva on and the tiny lighted microscope you look
through are all contained in what looks like a tube of lipstick.
 Because the lens can be washed and reused, this is a one-time purchase.
 According to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, this method is
about 98 percent accurate.
 Unlike ovulation kits, which use urine, these can be used any old
time, not just when your bladder is full. Peeing on demand can be hard,
but you always have saliva. Plus, you can use the saliva kit on the bus,
which is out of the question with urine-based OPKs!
Disadvantages to this method include the following:
 It’s fairly expensive, about $60.
 It’s slightly more complicated to use. You have to take the lens out and
put it back properly or you won’t read it correctly. You also risk the pos-
sibility of breaking or scratching the lens.
 Also, as with OPKs and TesTape, this tells you only when you’re about
to ovulate. It won’t confirm that you did actually release an egg.
77
Chapter 5: Trying Simple Techniques in Not-So-Simple Situations

The saliva test can be done every day starting at day one of your cycle; at
first you’ll see only little dots (of salt) when you look through the viewing
piece. As ovulation gets closer, you’ll see what look like ferns (see Figure 5-1);
when the ferns cover the whole slide, you’re about to ovulate. It takes about
five minutes for the slide to dry so you can accurately read it.
The saliva tests have an advantage over urine-based OPKs, which will only
give you a yes or no answer as to whether you’re ready to ovulate. The saliva
test gives you more advance warning that ovulation is coming. With the
saliva test, you can also avoid some of the false positives from LH kits and
the fluctuations in temperature that can throw off results of the basal body
temperature method (see “Taking your morning temperature,” earlier in this
chapter).
Even though the saliva test is initially expensive, it may be cheaper than
buying ovulation predictor kits every month. And if you do get pregnant, you
can use it after you deliver to prevent pregnancy until you want another baby!
This method of birth control is approved by the Catholic Church and in some
cases is thought to be more accurate than the rhythm method of counting
days to avoid pregnancy.
Saliva monitors that store and analyze data, just like the urine monitors, are
now available. These are quite expensive, however — over $200.
If you already have a microscope and slides hanging around the house from a
leftover science project or something, you can test saliva at home without any
of the expensive packaged equipment. Put some saliva on a slide and take a
look! You should also know that most doctors prefer the urine LH tests for
accuracy.

Sperm testing at home
While you’re doing all this home testing on yourself, it might seem like a good
idea to get your partner in on the act with a little home testing of his own. 
It’s now possible to do a very rudimentary semen analysis at home; this
method won’t give you detailed information, but it will let you check out two
semen samples to see whether the concentration of sperm meets the accepted
fertility level of 20 million/ml. The brand name is FertilMARQ. You can pur-
chase this product online and have it sent directly to your home, to avoid an
embarrassing trip to the drugstore. Two Web sites that sell the sperm test are
www.babyhopes.com and www.completefertility.com; both also sell
basal digital thermometers, home pregnancy tests, and OPKs.
Hoping for a Boy or Girl: 
Will Timing Help?
You may wonder if you’re equally likely to have a boy or girl. As far as con-
ception goes, more boy babies are conceived than girl babies by a ratio of
130:100, but by the time of birth, this ratio drops to 105:100, signifying the
higher rate of miscarriage for baby boys. Are you really, really hoping for a
child of one sex or another, and looking for ways to maximize your chances
of buying pink or blue? One theory is that boy sperm (those that carry the Y
chromosome, which, combined with the woman’s X chromosome, creates a
boy baby) are shorter lived but faster swimmers; girl sperm (those that carry
the X chromosome to create a girl) live longer but are slower. So if you want a

Saliva tester brands to check
Two nonelectronic saliva tester products are
widely available. One goes by the name Donna
(Doña in Spanish-speaking countries). It looks
like an ordinary lipstick tube and is very easy to
carry with you. The other is Lady Q, which also
looks like a lipstick container and is easy to use
anywhere.
Going higher tech, you may want to take a look
at OvaCue II, an electronic saliva tester. It comes
with a spoon-sized sensor that you place on
your tongue for eight seconds in the morning, so
it’s not quite as portable as the lipstick-sized
tubes. It also comes with a vaginal probe, which
you can use in addition to the oral probe for
even greater accuracy. Obviously, this isn’t a
product to use on the bus or in the office. It’s
manufactured by Zetek.

girl, have sex two days before ovulation; if you want a boy, try to hit the day
of ovulation straight on. Is there any real proof that this works? Not really!
(We discuss high tech sex selection further in Chapter 21.)
Getting through the Two-Week Wait
The two-week wait (2WW) is the time between ovulation and your next
expected period, when you’re on pins and needles waiting for enough time to
pass to be able to look for pregnancy symptoms or to buy the ever popular
home pregnancy test.
You, like many women before you, may spend this time analyzing every possi-
ble pregnancy symptom — “Are my breasts tender?” “Am I peeing more?”
“Was that a twinge of nausea?” — looking for something — anything! — that
indicates success in the pregnancy department.
The 2WW may seem like 1,000 years, and it’s not likely that much will divert
you from constantly thinking about pregnancy. If it’s possible, putting preg-
nancy completely out of your mind may help you maintain your sanity; staying
busy at work, going on vacation, taking up a new and incredibly complex
hobby, or cleaning your house from top to bottom may help keep you occu-
pied and away from the home pregnancy tests until two weeks have passed.
Looking for a Positive — 
Home Pregnancy Tests
If you think that you used a lot of ovulation predictor sticks, wait until you
start using the home pregnancy tests (HPTs)! They’re widely advertised on
TV, depicting a couple excitedly waiting for the good news or a tense woman
alone hoping for the happy news that she’s not pregnant. The sections that
follow give you all you need to know about HPTs.
Getting to know HPTs
The first home tests were available in the 1970s, and everyone probably would
have been a little more squeamish about leaving them in the fridge next to
the milk if they had known that they contained prepackaged red blood cells.
These tests were very sensitive to movement, so you had to put them some-
place quiet and leave them alone for a few hours. When you finally peeked
80
Part II: Stepping Up Your Efforts 

into the fridge, you looked for the dark ring at the bottom of the tube — that’s
what appeared if you were pregnant. The clumping together of red blood
cells if you were pregnant is what formed the ring.
All the tests, from the 1920s on, measured hCG (human chorionic gonado-
tropin), the hormone released by the implantation of the embryo and the
growing placenta. The newest tests are very sensitive; the most sensitive
tests of the 30 or so brands on the market claim to detect concentrations of
25mIU/ml, which usually occur about ten days after ovulation, or about four
days prior to the time you would miss your first period. Others don’t test
positive until the hCG level is 50 or even 100mIU/ml, so read the box before
you buy. Even though most tests are accurate a few days before your period
is due, a negative test at that time may not be accurate. You may have had a
late implantation, or you may have ovulated a day or two after you thought
you did. Another test should be done a few days later if your period still
hasn’t started.
The average level of hCG 10 days post ovulation is 25mIU/ml; it is 50mIU/ml
12 days post ovulation, and 100mIU/ml 14 days after you ovulate. Keep in
mind that these numbers are averages; your number may be higher or lower
and still be perfectly normal. Also, as with LH kits, the concentration of the
urine can play a large role in whether or not the test turns positive. Because
any positive value is important, using first morning (most concentrated)
urine is a good idea.
Blood tests can also measure hCG, detecting concentrations less than 5mIU/ml.
(We talk about pregnancy blood tests more in Chapter 15.) 
Using HPTs
Home pregnancy tests are available in every drugstore, so if you’re buying in
bulk because you’re a compulsive tester, you can hit every grocery store and
drugstore in town, and no one will know that you’re compulsive — er, anxious
to know! These tests give fast results, usually in two to five minutes. Most tell
you to not urinate for four hours before you test so the concentration of the
hormone will be high. Some kits suggest that you urinate in a cup and dip the
wand into it, and other kits suggest peeing directly on the stick. Some show a
positive as a little plus sign; others want you to drag all your friends back in to
the bathroom (if you still have any friends left after ovulation) and have them
compare the control line to the test line to see whether they match. Usually a
positive is indicated by a test line that’s as dark as or darker than the control,
and many women drive themselves mad staring at the line trying to determine
its exact shade of purple. Some tests now eliminate the “match game” by
spelling out, “Yes, you’re pregnant” or some variation if your test is positive.
81
Chapter 5: Trying Simple Techniques in Not-So-Simple Situations

Don’t let the test sit around before looking at it, as some test results will
change after an hour or two and will not be accurate. See Figure 5-2 for 
positive and negative results on a home pregnancy test.
Table 5-2 lists the common brands of home pregnancy tests and the lowest
number they claim will register a positive result. Sensitivity is measured in
units called mIU, which means milli-International Units per milliliter.

Understanding false positives
False positive results are rare in home pregnancy tests. You may have a false
positive if
 You’re taking injections of the hormone hCG to induce ovulation or for
any other reason; it takes 14 days for 10,000U of hCG (a standard dose)
to completely clear your system.
 You recently had a miscarriage or ectopic pregnancy, and the hCG levels
have not dropped to a negative range yet. (This can take up to 4 weeks.)

Chapter 5: Trying Simple Techniques in Not-So-Simple Situations

 You have developed a rare cancer called a choriocarcinoma. This cancer
usually follows a full-term birth, miscarriage, or other pregnancy loss.
This is a fast-growing cancer, so if you recently had a pregnancy loss of
any kind and have a positive home pregnancy test and heavy bleeding,
you must see a doctor immediately

Some enterprising manufacturers have marketed kits containing about seven
ovulation predictor sticks and one or two HPTs, plus a sperm kit for your
partner! Of course these are more expensive than buying just the home preg-
nancy tests, but it certainly cuts down on all those embarrassing trips to the

tion predictors, one HPT, and some Tums antacids! We guess this

Dealing With Buttinskis (Also Known 
As Friends and Relatives)
There’s no question that dealing with infertility is a strain, and it’s a strain
that can turn into a major emotional drain when friends and relatives decide
to involve themselves in your situation. 
You can try, nicely but firmly and, one hopes, unemotionally, to let relatives
know that their concern is welcome but their advice and opinions are not.
Most often, you’ll find they don’t really want to know all the details. They just
want to feel like they’re an important part of your life and that you care
enough about them to include them in what’s going on.
Jackie told each and every one of her family and friends that she would let
them know as soon as she actually became pregnant and that they didn’t need
to ask her on the hour. More friends than relatives got the hint, but certain sit-
uations, such as holidays, baby showers, or lunch time, seemed to bring out
the nosiest in everyone. In the sections that follow, we give you some tips on
how to cope with these situations and people that try your patience.
84
Part II: Stepping Up Your Efforts 

Remembering that you need your 
friends and family — even if 
they drive you up a wall!
You may be faring pretty well and your partner may be a rock, but your mother,
sister, or best friend may be a royal pain in the proverbial you-know-what,
wanting to know all the details of how things are going, how you’re feeling,
how your partner is reacting, and so on.
The obvious way to handle this situation is to just tell everyone to stay out of
your business, but as you well know, this is much easier said than done. Like
it or not, these people are usually important to you or you wouldn’t let them
interfere in your lives this way, and you do want your potential child to have
a grandma, aunt, or godmother some day.
Some families consider this sort of interference as sort of a family right.
Inquiring into your reproductive plans may have started the minute your
relationship with your partner began. A polite “I’d rather not discuss it” isn’t
going to work in this kind of family. Before you know it, the whispering has
begun, and the word is out in the family that something is wrong with you.
How much you tell is up to you and your partner. Usually your partner isn’t
as eager to blab the details to one and all as you may be, but you may want to
consider that even the most prying parents and friends may turn out to be a
real source of support after they know what you’re going through.
Surviving the holidays
Holidays bring their own special challenges to almost everyone, but those
trying to conceive may be particularly affected. The summer holidays always
seem to be the perfect setting for family picnics, reunions, and other get-
togethers where carefree children frolic and nosy relatives coyly ask when you
will be eating for two. Winter provides little relief as Thanksgiving, Hanukkah,
Christmas, and Kwanzaa all seem to focus on extended family, talk of Santa,
the latest children’s toys, and holiday newsletters that share every painstak-
ing family detail, from birth to potty training to Junior’s first car accident.
Some of this family updating is normal, but you may be especially sensitive 
to the topic while you’re trying to conceive yourself. Try as best you can to
determine whether the conversation is the speaker’s way of trying to connect or
reconnect with family and friends or whether you’re face to face with an insuf-
ferable boor. If you discover it’s the latter, realize that you can’t do much to
guard against people like this, whether they’re related to you or not. Even when
you do have children of your own, they’re little protection in this situation.
Those who want to prattle on endlessly about themselves and their families
85
Chapter 5: Trying Simple Techniques in Not-So-Simple Situations

will do so anyway, with little notice given to whether you’re with child or with-
out. In such situations, the art of the smile, the nod, and the hasty exit will
serve you well.
If you plan on spending extended time with your extended family, consider
cluing in a few folks about your situation. They can be helpful in deflecting
family or friends who are notorious for ill-timed comments. Arriving late
and/or leaving early is another way to minimize your contact with difficult
people and situations. You may want to plan something special for you and
your partner or a friend after your family affair. This activity will give you
something to look forward to throughout the family function.

Everybody else is doing it! Comparing 
and contrasting
When Jackie’s college friend, Leslie, got mar-
ried at 39 and began planning her family, Jackie
was still on the infertility treadmill that had taken
up three years of her life. The friends had dis-
cussed fertility at great length. They were the
same age, and Jackie anticipated that her
friend would also be faced with the same uphill
battle. Jackie walked her through the ovulation
predictor kit and the tale of the little purple line.
Two months later, after recounting their latest
high-tech fertility strategy, Jackie asked her
friend Leslie how her low-tech attempts were
faring. “Jackie,” she said, her voice breaking,
“I’m pregnant.” Jackie couldn’t believe it. Hadn’t
she gotten married only 15 minutes ago? Jackie
managed to blurt out, “When?” struggling with
the conflicting emotions of wanting to congrat-
ulate her and wanting to cry. “I’m six weeks
along,” she replied. “It happened the second
month.” Thank God for call waiting. When the
other call beeped in, Jackie quickly wished her
all the love and luck in the world and cut the
conversation short. That poor telemarketer. Talk
about making the wrong call at the wrong time.
Jackie loves her friends and wishes them the
best. And despite this, Leslie’s success seemed
to be Jackie’s failure, even more so than the
unsuccessful years of trying. Luckily, Jackie had
her network in place. A call to her friend Susan,
who was also experiencing infertility, quickly
salved Jackie’s wounds, at least temporarily.
“Don’t you hate it when that happens?” Susan
said with a sigh. She proceeded to share her
stories of a sister-in-law who conceived every
time her husband walked in the room. Susan, on
the other hand, had spent the last five years in
low-, medium-, and high-tech fertility treatments
with no baby to show for it (although she has
since given birth to a healthy baby girl, who
came about in a completely unplanned, non-
technological way!). Susan’s ability to immedi-
ately understand helped Jackie to begin to put
the situation in perspective. Sharing with the
newly pregnant Leslie that she (Jackie) felt
happy for her and jealous also eased the pain.
Jackie remembered how difficult it was when
she had lost friends who couldn’t deal with the
fact that Jackie was getting married while they
remained single. Jackie knew she didn’t want to
give up her friendship no matter how difficult it
felt. Instead, Jackie committed to working
through it by continuing to communicate with
the same honesty and sensitivity that she was
seeking. When all else fails, try to see another’s
pregnancy as a chance to observe just what
you’re getting yourself into! Perhaps you can put
this more intimate knowledge of the pros and
cons of being pregnant to good use in the future.

Jackie was certain that, after attending family functions solo for years, her
discomfort would end if and when she was married. How was she supposed
to know that there was still another hoop to jump through? What she did
learn was that there will always be another obstacle, if she allows it. Even if
Jackie were to arrive with her perfect family in tow, some new challenge
would always await. Holidays can become a time for comparison rather than
a time for joy, if you choose to compete. Instead, consider meeting those ill-
timed comments and people with a hug and an expression of good wishes.
Your grace may just stop the others in their tracks.
For those who are truly interested in you and your life, share some of the
positive things from the past year. They may truly appreciate the chance to
connect, much more so than a bouncing baby story.
Rather than ignore the children playing with their new toys, get in there and
play with them. Doing so is wonderful practice for the future. And in the
meantime, you may just discover some of the fun of being with children and
sharing their joy, before giving them back to their rightful owner after the
excitement wears off! Consider this your gift of the holiday season.
Declining invitations
If a family member or friend is expecting, you may find it difficult to attend
any gathering that this pregnant woman attends. Don’t chide yourself for
your absence. A little denial can go a long way toward helping you gracefully
deal with a painful situation. You may decide to bow out of a family dinner or
two or ’fess up with the truth and count on the understanding of those who
love you. Either way, you’ll preserve your integrity and that of your family
relationships by not forcing yourself to handle even one bit more than you
think you can. This too shall pass.
Forecast: Baby showers likely
Definition of a baby shower: A seemingly benign tradition that can wreak
havoc in the hearts of infertile women everywhere (many men claim this as
well, no matter what the circumstances). Here’s some advice on the topic:
 If you choose to attend (and remember you don’t have to), don’t go it
alone. Sometimes that may mean sharing your situation with the preg-
nant guest of honor. Although it is her day, a little bit of knowledge goes
a long way toward sensitivity.
 If you don’t choose to confide in the lady of the hour, hang with a
friend. Face it: Baby showers can be very emotional, but they can also
87
Chapter 5: Trying Simple Techniques in Not-So-Simple Situations

be very, very humorous, particularly when shared with someone who
understands your situation and can help you see the (inevitable)
comedy of errors that often surrounds the pregnant population. This
tactic can help you to laugh your way through situations that you may
have spent months dreading. Remember though, be nice — isn’t that
how you want to be treated when you’re pregnant?
 If no allies are in attendance, the telephone can be a wonderful thing.
Try to make a difficult situation tolerable by calling a trusted friend
before, after, and sometimes during (that’s what bathrooms are for!) the
event. Cellular phones are wonderful for this purpose and have helped
many a pregnant woman through a tough spot. Consider turning down
the ringer and/or putting your phone on vibrator mode if you expect a
“cavalry call” to help you through. This way, you can get the support
you need and not disrupt the party.
 If you’re going solo to the shower, you can always use the bathroom,
the porch, or your car for temporary refuge . . . or for a good cry if
you need it.
 You don’t have to stay until the last present is unwrapped either.
Making an appearance is sufficient, particularly when you’re under pres-
sure. You can be the life of the party another time. Your friends will
understand.

we talk about the effects of age on getting pregnant and look at some diseases
that can make getting pregnant a challenge. We also help you decide what to
do if you had a tubal ligation in the past and want to get pregnant now.
Are You an “Older Mom?” Calculating
Your Fertility Odds at Different Ages
More and more women and men are delaying childbirth until later years. In
fact, over 20 percent of new mothers are now over the age of 35, and the aver-
age age for women to have their first baby is now over 25. 
Checking out the statistics
But Mother Nature is apparently not one for statistics (see Table 6-1). For
women, optimum fertility occurs when you’re about 18 years old. It stays pretty
constant in the early part of your 20s and then begins a gradual downward
turn at about the age of 30. By the time you turn 35, the process has acceler-
ated. When you hit 40, the slide becomes even more dramatic; 33 percent 

of women over 35 have some difficulty getting pregnant, and 66 percent of
women over 40 have infertility issues.

abnormalities
Why the decrease in pregnancy and rise in miscarriage as you get older? It’s
because of the increase in chromosomal abnormalities in your eggs as they
age. At age 20, your chance of having a baby with a chromosomal abnormal-
ity such as Down syndrome (also called trisomy 21), or trisomy 13 or 18
(these usually result in newborn death shortly after delivery), is 1 in 526. By
age 30, the risk is 1 in 385; by age 35, 1 in 192; by age 40, 1 in 66; and by age
45, 1 in 21. And this is just the tip of the proverbial iceberg. Information from
pre-implantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) strongly indicates that the majority
of embryos in women over 40 are chromosomally abnormal. Of course, most
of these don’t implant, and those that do are usually miscarried. That’s why
the miscarriage rate increases with age.
Men have it a little easier (don’t they always?). Their peak fertility generally
remains constant throughout their 30s. It does begin to decline over time, but
at a slower pace than their female counterparts. Recent studies, however, do
show a rise in chromosomal abnormalities in men over 35, and by age 50,
most men show a 33 percent decrease in the number of sperm produced. So
although their problems may be less obvious when it comes to conceiving,
the effects of age may play a significant role down the road.
A new study on autism, a spectrum communication disorder which can range
from mild to severe, suggests that the age of the father plays a significant role
as well. Fathers over 40 are six times more likely to produce a child with
autism as those under 40. Autism spectrum disorder has been on the rise
over the past few decades with some experts pointing at environmental fac-
tors as well as possible links to preservatives used in vaccines. The “age”
issue is an interesting correlation as the age of the average father, like that of
the mother, has also risen over the years, which could be another explana-
tion for the rise in the disorder.

Understanding how much 
age itself matters
We say this often throughout this book: Human reproduction is a very ineffi-
cient process at any age. When a woman is 35, one out of four embryos is

Chapter 6: Considering Special Circumstances
Being an “older” mom — Jackie’s 
personal opinion! 
Under the category of “things I didn’t expect in
life,” having children in my 40’s was certainly
one of them! Infertility was another one. On the
upside, I always hoped but never dreamed that
I would find a partner as wonderful as my hus-
band. And he was worth waiting for! That all
said, I am the proud “older” mom of a beautiful
31⁄2--year-old girl, and I wouldn’t change a thing. 
Being an older mom certainly has its down-
sides, primarily if you “aged” while waiting to
conceive! But, for me, and many of my “older
mom” friends, we see the glass as more than
half full. As an older mom, we may lack a bit in
energy (although truth be told, I’m in better car-
diovascular shape than I was in my 20s), but I
believe that many of us more than make up for
this when it comes to maturity and stability.
I often said that I could barely figure out what I
wanted to wear when I was in my peak repro-
ductive years (generally classified as younger
than 27 years old), let alone raise a child or two.
While others in their 20s may certainly possess
a more grownup attitude than I did, most young
women go through extraordinary changes at
this time of their life, centering on self discov-
ery, life’s goals and their own place in the world.
In my not-so-humble opinion, this process is
best conducted solo, without partner or child, in
order to truly understand what you want out of
life and how to get it. (Co-author Sharon, who
had children in her early twenties, doesn’t nec-
essarily agree!)
Financial, educational, and career stability is
also often lacking in these younger years. While
plenty of women choose to have children first
and complete their education later, many will
also tell you that going back to school, chang-
ing careers, and so on can be far more difficult
at a later age, particularly with family in tow.
Statisticians have also cited the higher level of
divorce amongst couples who marry in their
early 20s, due in great part to the changes that
both partners will inevitably go through as they
“grow up.”
For young marrieds, I believe there is a crucial
and wonderful period of time, the “honeymoon”
phase of discovering one another, that is best
done as a couple without a couple of children in
the mix.
All this said, most people are secure enough in
themselves, their relationships, and their
careers by their late 20s or early 30s, which is
certainly an excellent time to plan (and have!) a
family. Unfortunately, also falling in the category
of “Things we don’t expect, plan for, and can’t
control,” many women and men do not meet
their partners on nature’s timetable. At the end
of the day, we all do the best we can with what
we have and what we “got” and being an Older
Mom is a pretty amazing gift.

abnormal; this number increases to one out of two at age 40, and five out of
six at age 45. Although these statistics certainly show that age is a factor in
conceiving, remember that you’re an individual, not a statistic, and your odds
may be better or worse than the statistics.
And remember, once you are pregnant, advanced maternal age (a lovely med-
ical term!) will contribute to an increased risk of chromosomal defects, of
which Down syndrome is one. 
Consider Table 6-1 to give you a better picture of how age affects not only fer-
tility but the risk of birth defects.
As with everything, there’s good news and bad news to being an older mom . . .
or dad. The best we can tell you is to use age as a suggested guideline. Fertility,
most often, decreases over time. You will not become infertile overnight.
Indeed, studies have shown that many women experience perimenopause
(the stage prior to menopause, which can last up to ten years) and subfertil-
ity for as long as five to seven years before the onset of actual menopause
(which generally signifies the end of your reproductive years). 
The average age of menopause is 51. You can still become pregnant during
perimenopause, although it may be more difficult and/or require medical inter-
vention because you ovulate less frequently and the quality of your remaining
eggs is not as good as it once was. That’s not to say you should purposely
delay childbirth until your “golden years”. Common sense, and knowledge of
the facts, will help you make the best decision for you and your family.
What’s “older” these days?
We read a lot of ink on how 50 is the new 40 and 40 is the new 30. That’s all
well and good, but someone forgot to tell our ovaries, or for that matter, any
other part of our body that is busy adjusting itself to our chronological age,
regardless of what ages our faces, figures, or fantasies place us.
In all fairness, however, we are seeing an extraordinary rise of pregnant
women and mommies over 40, 50, and sometimes even 60. This isn’t a reflec-
tion of the end of menopause as we know it, but rather the new technologies
such as donor egg, sperm, and embryo, which allow women and men to bear
children much later in life. 
You can’t pick up People magazine or turn on Oprah without hearing it: the
great fertility debate over what age is appropriate when it comes to concep-
tion. Unfortunately, much of the information in magazines is inappropriate
and just plain inaccurate. Recent statistics report an approximate 5 percent
chance in a given month for a woman over 40 to conceive. This number
sounds frighteningly low, until you compare it with the statistic that shows
that a healthy couple in their 20s has only a 20 percent chance of success
92
Part II: Stepping Up Your Efforts 

during any given month. This comparison is seldom brought up because the
one isolated, surprising statistic often sells better than the facts. Our advice:
Be a skeptic when it comes to supermarket medical opinions.
Over time, most people become fairly desensitized to the latest surefire cures
or health warnings used to sell everything from the scientific to the supernat-
ural. Apply the same approach when weeding through the information on fer-
tility. You wouldn’t take medical advice from your car mechanic, so don’t just
assume that everyone who offers up an opinion, even a public one, knows
anything more. Instead, ask your doctor, ask your nurse, or read a book (like
this one) written by someone actually in the field. Although the media may
provide you with a source of information, make sure that you qualify that
source. More often than not, you’ll find that the information presented has a
mere modicum of truth in it surrounded by a lot of hype designed to get your
attention. Ignore the hype. The next big story will take its place in no time.
But I don’t look my age!
Whether you’re dealing with fertility or fitness, age does play a role. Whether
you feel like you’re 15 or 50, whether you look your age or not, your body
knows how old you are, and your ovaries do too.
In truth, there is only one answer to how old you are . . . and it can be found
on your birth certificate. 
You can keep yourself in better baby-making shape (and better overall health)
through good self-care, including nutrition and exercise. These measures will
make a difference in your overall health, and may actually improve your health
during pregnancy, even decrease the risk of obstetrical complications (for exam-
ple, losing weight may decrease the risk of gestational diabetes). We touch on
these topics in Chapter 3. But ultimately, you can’t fool Mother Nature. In other
words, there is no known way to reverse the aging of the eggs.
Putting age in its (proper) place
Reversing the aging process is not an option, and if it you’ve found a way to do
so, we recommend writing a book . . . and a movie! But when it comes to con-
ceiving at a later age, there are a few things that you can do to help the odds:
 Keep yourself in the best health, and baby-making shape, possible;
regular checkups, good nutrition, plenty of sleep and exercise.
 Consult with a physician, be it OB/GYN or reproductive endocrinolo-
gist, who has experience in working with older wannabe moms. Not
all fertility doctors specialize in advanced maternal age, or want to for
that matter. Ask around and/or check with RESOLVE or online resources
93
Chapter 6: Considering Special Circumstances

to find a doctor who will have the latest and best information to help
you address your individual issues. (If you’re over 35, you should seri-
ously start with a reproductive endocrinologist.)
 Don’t compare yourself to younger women suffering from infertility,
or any other woman for that matter. Your issues may be entirely differ-
ent and call for a completely different approach. Just because your
friend’s sister-in-law was successful with a high stimulation protocol at
the age of 32, doesn’t mean that this will work for you at the age of 39. It’s
important to work with a physician, and a plan, tailored to your needs. 
 Jackie was convinced that high-tech IVF with lots of drugs was the
only thing that would work for her. Luckily, Jackie’s physician believed
differently. Even so, it took Jackie quite a few months to believe him!
After trying his lower tech, low-dose medication protocol for a while, lo
and behold, Jackie ended up with a bouncing baby girl. Being wrong was
one of the few right things that she did in trying to conceive!
 Surround yourself with a good support team. Whether it be friends,
family, clergy or professional help, this is not a battle that you want to
fight alone. Your support team can help keep you sane and realistic.
 Consider your options. Would you be willing to adopt? Use third-party
reproduction (for example, donor eggs, sperm, embryo)? A surrogate?
Success can often be found in Plan B, C, and so on down the line.
 Set a timetable. You don’t want to make baby making a midlife project
or crisis. Decide how long you want to spend trying and stick to it as
best you can. Knowing that there’s an end in sight can relieve a great
deal of pressure.
 Investigate alternative treatment if you’re interested. Some women
swear by acupuncture, naturopathy, or massage. Certainly, these are
easier alternatives for your mind and body and just might deliver your
baby to you as well. These measures are excellent for decreasing
stress and helping you tune into your body’s own signals. Just remem-
ber that alternative treatments can’t reverse ovarian aging any more
than “traditional” medications.
 Be patient. Even at a young age, consider trying to conceive as a
marathon, not a sprint. With each passing year, the time that this could
take you is likely to be longer and the effort more intense. Don’t set your-
self up by expecting success the first month around ... or the second. If
this does happen, you’ll be pleasantly surprised, and extraordinarily lucky! 
Living with Diseases That Affect Fertility
Just a few generations ago, systemic diseases such as diabetes or lupus ruled
out the possibility of having a baby. Now, pregnancies in patients with systemic
disease are commonplace, and obstetricians or perinatologists who specialize
94
Part II: Stepping Up Your Efforts 

in high-risk patients guide women with a history of cancer, kidney problems,
heart problems, or just about any other health condition through successful
pregnancies. Discuss the potential problems of pregnancy with your doctor
beforehand so that you can be prepared for the problems you may face get-
ting pregnant or carrying a pregnancy to term.
Polycystic ovaries
Polycystic ovarian syndrome, sometimes called PCO or PCOS, although in
medicalese it’s known as Stein-Leventhal Syndrome, is the most common hor-
monal problem in women of childbearing age, affecting between 5 and 10 per-
cent of women. PCOS is often associated with infertility, but affects women in
many other ways as well.
PCOS can be diagnosed by physical exam, including pelvic ultrasound, which
may show polycystic ovaries, or ovaries which contain many small cysts.
Blood tests may show an abnormal luteinizing hormone (LH) to follicle-stimu-
lating hormone (FSH) ratio. Normally, the ratio between these two hormone
levels is 1:1, but in PCOS patients, the LH is elevated, with a ratio of about 2:1
or higher. Insulin levels, free testosterone (a male hormone), and glucose may
be high, and thyroid levels may be low.
The official definition of PCOS as determined by a workshop sponsored by
ESHRE/ASRM (the European and American conferences on reproductive
endocrinology) in 2003 is that PCOS is present if 2 of the 3 following criteria
are met:
 Anovulation (no ovulation) or oligoulvation (ovulating only occasionally
rather than every month)
 Excess androgen activity
 Polycystic ovaries diagnosed by ultrasound and not related to any other
cause
It’s difficult to say what causes PCOS; some women, but not all (about 50 per-
cent), with PCOS are overweight, which can be related to the body’s ability to
make insulin, a hormone that regulates the body’s use of starches and sugars.
This is why one of the treatments for PCOS is Metformin (Glucophage), a
medication that is most commonly used for Type 2 (adult-onset, noninsulin-
dependent) diabetes. The unanswered question is, which came first, being
overweight or the PCOS? Most doctors today think that the PCOS is the cause
of being overweight rather than the other way around. There may be a
genetic component to PCOS.
The overabundance of insulin production in women with PCOS may lead to
the ovaries making too many androgens, or male hormones. The excess of
95
Chapter 6: Considering Special Circumstances

androgens leads to many of the symptoms associated with PCOS, which
include the following:
 Discoloration of the skin under the arms, breasts and around the groin
(acanthosis nigricans)
 Excess facial hair
 Acne
 Thinning hair or male pattern baldness
 Excess weight
PCOS can also affect women systemically, outside of the reproductive
system, causing:
 Type 2 (adult onset) diabetes
 Heart disease
 High blood pressure
 High cholesterol levels
 Sleep apnea 
Women with PCOS may start to develop follicles, but because of the imbal-
ance between FSH and LH, they don’t mature and don’t ovulate. Instead, the
follicles get “stuck” in the surface of the ovary in a state that can best be
described as “suspended animation.” Because there is no ovulation, there’s
no monthly period. Periods become irregular and, when they do occur, they
may be quite heavy because the uterine lining has become thickened as a
result of not shedding on a regular basis.
This lack of regular shedding and thickening of the uterine lining can eventu-
ally lead to a risk of hyperplasia (a pre-cancerous thickening of the uterine
lining) which can, if left untreated, lead to uterine cancer. If you have PCOS
and don’t ovulate regularly, your doctor may recommend doing endometrial
biopsies (a small piece of the uterine lining is scraped off and sent to pathol-
ogy to be tested for abnormal cells) to check for cancer cells.
Women with PCOS may also have a higher rate of miscarriage, and are more
likely to develop gestational diabetes during pregnancy. Some women have
an easier time conceiving if they take insulin-lowering medication; it’s not yet
clear if these same medications can also lower the risk of miscarriage in
women with PCOS. 
If you have PCOS, you may need to see a fertility specialist to get pregnant.
There are treatments that can help you get pregnant; the most common are:
 Medications like Clomiphene Citrate and gonadotropins (see Chapter 22
for a description of different fertility medications) to induce ovulation.
96
Part II: Stepping Up Your Efforts 

 Medications to lower insulin resistance; these medications, Glucophage
and Avandia, are also taken by people with diabetes. 
 Ovarian drilling: A number of small punctures are made in the ovary using
a laser during a laparoscopy, resulting in a lowering of male hormones.
 Weight loss; the catch-22 is that women with PCOS have a harder time
losing weight.
Endometriosis
Endometriosis is the growth of pieces of endometrial tissue (the inner lining
of the uterus) outside the uterus. Endometriosis is commonly found in fallop-
ian tubes, ovaries, bladder, and sometimes even outside the pelvic cavity, in
the abdomen. In rare cases, it has been found in the lungs, and even under
the skin or in the brain! How does it manage to leave the uterus and travel to
all these places? 
There are many theories about how endometriosis travels; the most common
are that endometriosis travels along with menstrual blood that flows “back-
wards” out of the uterus and into the fallopian tubes, ovary, pelvis, bladder,
and abdomen. This theory doesn’t explain how endometriosis ends up far
from the pelvis; theories for how this happens range from travel through the
lymph system to a theory that endometrial tissue doesn’t travel to these places,
but is present in these locations from birth (pick up a copy of Endometriosis for
Dummies, [Wiley 2006] for all you ever wanted to know about endometriosis).
Endometriosis is a big player on the infertility field; around 30 percent of
women suffering from infertility have endometriosis. Conversely, if you have
endometriosis, you have around a 40 percent chance of having some degree
of infertility. In addition, more than 30 percent of laparoscopic surgeries for
unexplained infertility result in a diagnosis of endometriosis.
Endometriosis may affect fertility in a number of ways, including the following:
 Blocking fallopian tubes so the ovulated egg can’t reach the uterus
 Destroying the fimbriae, the hair-like projections on the end of the fal-
lopian tubes that guide the released egg into the fallopian tube
 Causing cysts that may interfere with the release of eggs from the ovary
 Creating an immune response in the pelvis that interferes with fertilization
 Partially blocking fallopian tubes, so the embryo is more likely to
implant in the tube (ectopic pregnancy)
Does all this mean you should throw in the towel on having a baby if you have
endometriosis? Not at all! As many as 70 percent of women with minimal or
97
Chapter 6: Considering Special Circumstances

mild endometriosis and infertility do conceive within three years of trying
without any therapy.
However, you may not want to wait three years to get pregnant. And if you
have moderate to severe endometriosis, your chances of pregnancy may be
significantly lower without medical intervention. The good news is that surgi-
cal treatment of minimal or mild endometriosis increases pregnancy rates; in
one study, more than 40 percent of women with moderate or severe
endometriosis became pregnant after surgery.
In vitro fertilization (IVF) has helped many women with endometriosis con-
ceive, even in previously “hopeless” cases. (Check out Chapter 15 for more
info about IVF.) In spite of its other effects on natural conception,
endometriosis does not diminish IVF success rates.
Diabetes: More than a “sugar” problem
Diabetes affects about 17 million Americans, or approximately 6 percent of
the population. There are actually several different types of diabetes, includ-
ing the following:
 Type 1 diabetes, which used to be called juvenile diabetes, usually devel-
ops before puberty, but can develop at any age. Five to ten percent of
diabetics have Type 1 diabetes, which is an autoimmune disease. In Type 1
diabetes, the beta cells of the pancreas stop making insulin altogether,
so people with this problem must take injections of insulin every day.
 Type 2 diabetes usually develops in people over 40, but it can develop
earlier. It is often associated with being overweight; 80 percent of Type 2
diabetics are overweight. It develops more slowly than Type 1 and can
possibly be controlled with diet and pills rather than injections.
Diabetes leads to problems with blood vessels, circulation, and nerve func-
tion. Therefore, men with diabetes often have problems with erection and
ejaculation; some male diabetics have retrograde ejaculation, a condition in
which sperm back up into the bladder.
Women with diabetes need to have well-controlled blood sugar levels during
pregnancy. Even with good control, the rate of birth defects in women with
diabetes is two to three times the normal rate. Women with polycystic ovary
syndrome may develop Type 2 diabetes later in life.
Diabetics tend to have large babies, which can create problems at the time of
delivery.

Part II: Stepping Up Your Efforts 

Lupus: Not just a rash
Systemic lupus erythematosus, commonly called lupus, is primarily a disease
of women, although a small percentage of men also develop it. One of the out-
ward symptoms of lupus is a facial rash, but lupus can affect every organ in
your body. A few generations ago, women with lupus were advised not to have
children, because it was felt that pregnancy worsens the disease. More recent
studies have shown this belief not to be true, although one-third of pregnant
lupus patients have “flares,” or increases in disease activity. About 10 percent
of pregnant lupus patients find that their symptoms actually improve.
Fifty percent of women with lupus have normal pregnancies and normal
deliveries; about 25 percent deliver prematurely, and another 25 percent
experience miscarriage or stillbirth.
Miscarriage may be related to antibodies called antiphospholipid antibodies
(discussed earlier in this chapter) found in some lupus patients. These antibod-
ies cause clotting and interfere with the growth of the placenta. Baby aspirin
and/or heparin may be given in pregnancy to help blood flow to the placenta.
About 20 percent of lupus patients develop toxemia, a condition that results
in high blood pressure, liver and kidney malfunctions, and premature deliv-
ery and can lead to eclampsia, which can cause maternal seizures and death.
If you have lupus, you need to be followed carefully by an obstetrician who
specializes in high-risk patients.
Cancer and Fertility: The News Is
Cautiously Optimistic
Just a few years ago, having cancer meant that you would probably not be able
to conceive and carry a child. Surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy, the
mainstay treatments of most cancers, could destroy ovaries and sperm cells
as well as your hope of having a child.
Today, however, new advances have made it possible for cancer survivors to
become parents, and the really good news is that more advances are being
made all the time. The information of today may be obsolete soon, and the
chances for parenthood will hopefully be better than ever. The good news even
today is that there’s no evidence that your baby will have a higher risk of birth
defects or childhood cancer if you become pregnant after cancer treatment.
99
Chapter 6: Considering Special Circumstances

For women . . .
Because women are involved not only in the production of gametes but also
for carrying a baby to term, cancer in women who want to be parents can be
more complicated than cancer in men. In the next sections, we look at differ-
ent types of cancer that can impact future motherhood.
Beating breast cancer
Breast cancer survivors are now being told that pregnancy after treatment is
possible, as long as their ovaries are intact and haven’t been irradiated. Many
doctors encourage patients to wait two years after treatment before trying to
get pregnant. Pregnancy doesn’t increase the chance of cancer recurrence,
according to most recent studies, but doctors want to make sure that the
cancer doesn’t recur on its own.
If you do have a recurrence of cancer while pregnant and require chemother-
apy, you need to be aware that chemo in the first trimester may cause fetal
malformation, while waiting till the second or third trimester may result in
preterm labor or fetal loss. 
At the time of this writing, a study showed that breast cancer patients trying
to get pregnant through in vitro fertilization made more eggs when given
tamoxifen.
Battling ovarian cancer
If you’ve been treated for ovarian cancer with radiation or ovarian ablation,
your ovaries will not be functioning, and you’ll need to use donor eggs to
become pregnant. If you were treated with multiple-agent chemotherapy,
there’s a good chance you’ll go into premature ovarian failure. One-third of
women under age 30 and two-thirds of those over 30 go into POF.
It’s sometimes possible to remove only one ovary or move the ovary not
affected by cancer out of the way (surgically lift the ovary out of the pelvis),
so it won’t be affected by radiation treatment.
Fighting uterine cancer
The treatment for uterine cancer is usually removal of the uterus; this means
you won’t be able to carry a pregnancy, although if your ovaries are not
removed, you can produce eggs that can be fertilized and implanted into a
gestational carrier.
New therapy for very early endometrial (the lining of the uterus is called the
endometrium) cancers involves treating patients with the hormone medrox-
yprogesterone and also performing repeated dilatation and curettage, scrap-
ing the uterine lining until it’s free of cancerous cells. This method can be
100
Part II: Stepping Up Your Efforts 

used only in cancer cases that are discovered very early and confined to the
endometrium. Because the cancer can return, very close follow up is required.
Coping with cervical cancer
Early stage cervical cancer can be effectively treated by the removal of only
part of the cervix; this process is called cervical conization. It may also be
possible to remove the cervix while leaving the uterus intact when treating
cervical cancer (this is called a trachelectomy). 
For men . . .
Although testicular cancer is rare, making up only 1 percent of all cancer, it’s
the most common cancer found in men between the ages of 20 and 34, with
7,000 new cases diagnosed each year. It is four times more common among
Caucasian men than African American men.
If only one testicle is removed surgically, the remaining testicle will produce
enough sperm so that fertility won’t be damaged. If both testicles need to be
removed, several semen samples can be frozen before surgery and used for
insemination later on. If only one testicle is affected, the man has a 2 to 5 per-
cent chance of developing cancer in the other testicle.
Some chemotherapy treatment causes temporary loss of fertility, but sperm
counts may return to an acceptable level after two to three years. Radiation
may also cause temporary infertility, but some men regain adequate sperm
counts within a short time.
If certain lymph nodes are removed, the nerves that control ejaculation may
be affected, although the sperm count may be normal. This condition may
require sperm aspiration with ICSI and IVF to achieve a pregnancy.
Turning Around a Tubal Ligation
Nearly 40 percent of American women of childbearing age have been surgi-
cally sterilized. (See Chapter 12 for info on reversing a vasectomy, the male
sterilization procedure.) Unfortunately, at least 10 percent regret their deci-
sion down the road. Can tubal ligation be reversed? The answer is yes, no,
and maybe, depending on when the surgery was done and what kind of
surgery it was.
Surgical sterilization is very common in the United States. A 1995 study
showed that 41 percent of ever-married women ages 15 to 44 were surgically
101
Chapter 6: Considering Special Circumstances

sterile. About 1 million women have their tubes tied, a procedure known as
tubal ligation, each year. Human nature being what it is, at least 10,000 of
these women regret their decision and want to have another baby.
If you want a tubal reversal, look for a surgeon skilled in microsurgery (find
them through the Society for Reproductive Surgeons website at www.asrm.
org, the website of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine.). Depend-
ing on the surgeon and type of surgery done, your surgery can take up to four
hours to perform and may require several weeks of recovery. However, most
surgeons only require only a one-night hospital stay.
Risks after surgery include scar tissue formation, infection, and increased risk
of ectopic pregnancy. If the fimbriated end of the tube (the part that the egg
enters from the ovary) is intact and your doctor believes that you have enough
tube left to reconnect, your pregnancy chances after reanastomosis can be
higher than IVF success rates. This is because with repaired fallopian tubes,
the couple can “try at home” every month, whereas IVF is a one-shot deal.
A tubal reanastomosis, or tubal reversal, has some drawbacks. For one thing,
it’s expensive — around $10,000, about the same as an IVF cycle — and insur-
ance usually doesn’t cover the cost. For another, the success rate depends on
how long ago your tubes were tied and how they were tied. Success rates can
be anywhere from 20 to 70 percent, depending upon your individual situation.
Before you decide to have your tubal ligation reversed, consider these factors:
 Your age: Are you in your late thirties or younger? If you’re over 40, you
may have other fertility problems related to age, and in vitro fertilization
(IVF) may be a better option for you.
 Your partner: If your partner has sperm problems, you may also be
better off doing IVF rather than reversing your tubal ligation.
 How your tubes were tied: If your tubes were blocked off or clamped
with clips or rings instead of being cauterized or having a large section
removed, your chance of success is higher. Studies show that you need
at least 4 cm (about an inch and a half) of healthy tube to successfully
conceive after having the tubes reconnected (the average length of fal-
lopian tubes before sterilization is about 10 cm, or about 4 inches).

T
wo classic Norman Rockwell drawings show a family on vacation in the
station wagon. In the first scene, everyone is in clean new outfits and
wearing big smiles. The second scene shows the return from vacation —
everyone is dirty, bedraggled, and grumpy, and Dad looks like he’s ready to
drive the whole group over a cliff.
You may have started toward pregnancy in the “starting vacation” mode,
thinking “I can’t wait to do the nursery,” “What kind of maternity clothes
should I get?” and “I wonder who’ll give me a baby shower?” After a few
months with no pregnancy, you may resemble the return group, worn out and
testy, ready to slap the next person who asks when you’re going to have a
baby. It’s time to get some help — from your doctor.
In this chapter, we explain the ins and outs of finding a doctor who can help
when you’re not getting pregnant on your own, help you decide when to see a
specialist, and give you an idea of what to expect at your first visit. 
Deciding When You Should Make an
Appointment with Dr. Basic
Conventional medical opinion says that you should consult a physician if you
haven’t gotten pregnant in one year if you’re under age 35, or six months if
you’re over 35. These guidelines must have been written for very patient

people. If you’re under 35 and patient enough to wait for a year — a year —
before talking to a doctor about getting pregnant, let’s just say you have the
patience to make a very good parent!
Seeking professional help is a big step. Here you always thought you were an
average sort of person, and now you find yourself part of the 20 percent of
women who don’t get pregnant in a year of trying. For the first few months,
you could pretend it wasn’t a big deal, but now, well, open the phone book.
It’s time to call Dr. Basic. Who’s Dr. Basic? He can be your primary care physi-
cian or your regular GYN (gynecologist). In most cases of infertility, Dr. Basic
is the only doctor you’ll need to get pregnant.
When not to wait — even a few months
Sometimes even conventional wisdom, that conservative soul, says not to
wait six months or a year before seeing a doctor about not getting pregnant.
For example, see your doctor before even trying to get pregnant if:
 You’re over age 38. You may want to do more thorough testing before
trying because your aging ovaries are making fewer good eggs.
 You’ve had a previous ectopic pregnancy or have pelvic inflammatory
disease. You may have damage to your fallopian tubes, which may make
surgery necessary. 
 You’re not getting your period, or you’re getting it very irregularly.
You may need help regulating your cycles so that you produce an egg
every month. 
 You have very painful periods. You may have endometriosis (see
Chapter 6 for more discussion of this condition) and may need treat-
ment to get pregnant.
You may want to have your partner do a semen analysis early on if he:
 Has a history of trauma to the testicles
 Had undescended testicles 
 Had mumps as a child
Any of these conditions may have caused damage to his sperm; he may need
to see a urologist (a doctor that specializes in the urinary-genital tract).
If you’ve had your tubes tied or if your partner had a vasectomy, you need to
see a specialist to discuss either reversal of the surgery (see Chapter 11) or
in vitro fertilization (which we discuss in detail in Part IV).
104
Part II: Stepping Up Your Efforts 

Choosing between a family 
doctor and an OB/GYN
So who is Dr. Basic when you’re trying to get pregnant? The average doctor
has about nine initials after his name, so how are you supposed to know
which one you should see when you’re trying to get pregnant? Some of the
more common abbreviations you may see include the following:
 M.D.: Medical doctor trained in traditional medicine with four years of
medical school after college and a residency length varying with spe-
cialty. After that, residency can be from two to ten years, depending on
the specialty.
 D.O.: Doctor of osteopathy. These doctors used to be more trained in
manipulation and homeopathic methods, but today’s osteopaths train in
programs virtually identical to traditional medical schools.
 OB: Obstetrician. This specialist is trained to take care of pregnant
women and handle labor and delivery. OBs are also gynecologists but
may specialize in pregnancy.
 GYN: Gynecologist. This physician is trained to take care of women’s
health. Obstetricians and gynecologists all start with the same four-year
residency training after medical school, but they may choose to special-
ize in one area of the specialty.
 RE: Reproductive endocrinologist. This doctor is a graduate of an OB/
GYN program who has chosen to specialize in infertility. After medical
school, these doctors complete three years of additional training, called
a fellowship, to take tests to become certified for this sub-specialty.
 FP: Family practitioner. These doctors have chosen to specialize in the
health of the entire family. In some parts of the country they, rather than
OBs, handle many women’s health problems, including pregnancy and
deliveries.
 FACOG: Fellow of the American College of Obstetricians and
Gynecologists. A doctor who has FACOG after his name is board certified
in Obstetrics and Gynecology and is a member of this national society.
You may also come across these terms when doctor-shopping:
 Board eligible: These doctors have completed the education in their
specialty and can now take the tests to become board certified.
 Board certified: These doctors have practiced their specialty for two
years, taken the tests necessary to be certified, and have passed them.
105
Chapter 7: Seeing a Doctor — and Keeping Your Cool

If you live in a remote area, you may need to start with your family doctor
because specialists may not have offices in your area. Also, you may feel
more comfortable starting with a doctor who already knows you, such as
your OB/GYN or family doctor. If your doctor believes that your case is more
complex than he is qualified to treat, he’ll probably refer you to someone
more experienced in your particular situation.
The “top of the heap” in fertility specialists are board-certified reproductive
endocrinologists, doctors who have completed an additional three years of fel-
lowship in Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility after becoming OB/GYNs.
Bringing your partner 
to the OB/GYN office
Back in the olden days of gynecology, say before the 1960s, you never saw a
man in the OB/GYN waiting room. Today, however, the situation is different;
some men accompany their partners to every OB/GYN visit. Many doctors
even specifically request that you bring your partner to a visit so that you
can all get to know each other.
So should you encourage your partner to attend your first why-aren’t-we-
pregnant visit? That depends on a few things:
 Will he feel horribly out of place, not pay attention, or say something
you’d rather he didn’t?
Some men don’t like to go to the doctor, ever, for anything. Whether it’s
the loss of control, the digging into what they consider their personal
business, or just discomfort in the face of an authority figure, many men
are not assets at the doctor’s office. You probably know by now whether
your partner will do well at the doctor’s office. If you’re going to sit there
(half naked, no less) worrying about what embarrassing thing he might
say or do, go by yourself.
On the other hand, if your partner is the person in your twosome who
remembers details, writes things down correctly, asks sensible ques-
tions, and provides moral support, by all means, take him to your first
doctor visit. If you don’t get pregnant right away, he’ll probably need to
have his own testing done, so he may as well get familiar with the doctor
right from the start.
 Are you going to have to impart information that you don’t want your
partner to know?
For example, did you have an abortion, give a child up for adoption, have
a sexually transmitted disease, or do any other thing you’d rather your
106
Part II: Stepping Up Your Efforts 

partner didn’t know about? Then go to the first visit by yourself, frankly
explain the situation to your doctor, and take your partner to the next
visit. (Do not write confidential information down, as medical records
have a way of getting copied and sent from office to office. Instead, tell
the doctor, and explain that this information is confidential; he or she
should not write it down, either.)
 Are you going to be embarrassed about undergoing an examination with
your partner there?
Even today, in this let-it-all-hang-out age, some of you aren’t comfortable
having other people, even your partner, present for a gynecological
exam. If this situation is going to make you uneasy, maybe your partner
can wait in the waiting room until the exam is over and then come in
when you’re dressed.
Making a list of questions 
for your first visit
Whether you go alone or as a team to your doctor’s appointment, prepare a list
of questions ahead of time so that you won’t forget anything. Here’s a starter
list. You’ll probably have other questions specific to your own situation.
 Do you treat many patients trying to get pregnant?
Obviously, you don’t want a doctor taking on your case whose practice
mostly consists of gynecological surgery on women over age 50.
 Will you do any testing before we start treatment?
Some doctors just start you on medication for a few months before
putting you through more invasive testing. Other doctors do blood
work, semen analysis, and ultrasounds before starting you on medicine.
 Will my insurance cover any testing?
 What do you think my chance for success will be?
Obviously, your doctor doesn’t have a crystal ball, but he should have
some general idea, based on your age and history, what your chance of
getting pregnant is.
 How long should we try this before we do further testing?
If your doctor shrugs and gives you the impression that she would do
simple methods forever, you may want to find another doctor, especially
if you’re over age 35.
107
Chapter 7: Seeing a Doctor — and Keeping Your Cool

Answering Dr. Basic’s Questions
Dr. Basic is going to have some questions for you, too. He’ll want to know the
following, so come prepared with the answers:
 How long have you been trying to get pregnant?
 How often do you have sex?
 Do you use any lubricants?
 How do you time intercourse (what days of the month)?
 How long do your periods last?
 How long are your cycles from day one of one cycle to day one of 
the next?
 What was the first day of your last period?
 Are your periods painful?
 Are your periods heavy?
 How many pads or tampons do you use a day?
 Do any sisters or other close relatives have children?
 Are there any known genetic factors in your family?
 Have you used ovulation predictor kits; if so, what have they shown?
Dr. Basic may also have questions aimed specifically at you. If you’re heavy
and have adult acne or facial hair, he may wonder if you have polycystic
ovary syndrome (PCOS). PCOS patients often don’t ovulate on their own.
If you’re very thin, he may be concerned about you not getting periods due
to overexercising, anorexia, or poor nutrition.
Understanding What Your Doctor Says
Doctors and nurses aren’t really trying to confuse you when they spew forth
a list of initials or shortcut terms. But when your doctor says something like
“Get an HSG and a sono, and then if your APA and FSH come back okay, we’ll
start the stims,” your immediate reaction may be “Huh?”
Whenever you don’t understand what the doctor or nurse just said, ask the
person to stop and explain. Don’t write it down, thinking that you’ll look it up
later, or nod just to look like you know what they’re talking about. 
108
Part II: Stepping Up Your Efforts 

You may find it necessary to take notes on what your doctor is saying. Some
choose to tape record their conversations with their doctor. Any type of note
taking can be a helpful tool in relaying this information to your partner or to
your cousin who’s a doctor. Always ask your doctor if doing so is okay, partic-
ularly when it comes to taping your discussions. Most doctors have no prob-
lem with this; it’s better than a return phone call because you can’t remember
what was said. However, most people (including doctors) become a bit
unhinged if they find out that they were being taped secretly.
A second set of ears is helpful as well. This can be a perfect spot for your
partner to participate! Fertility is an emotional subject. Especially if the doctor
is addressing problems that you have, you may be too close to the situation to
hear and understand all the options that are available. Your partner or a friend
may be a bit more detached and better able to comprehend and communicate
the information to you. Many fertility patients view themselves (incorrectly!)
in a battle against their doctors. In this case, you may be more open to your
partner’s interpretation of what the doctor has said. Either way, try to remem-
ber that your doctor is on your side. Your doctor is your advocate, and part
of that duty involves giving you the complete picture, good and bad.
Keeping Your Own (Hit) Records
Fertility is certainly a project that can generate a lot of paperwork.
After initially relying on only her doctor’s records, Jackie eventually discov-
ered the need to keep her own records as well. The process was simple, but
the organization was not. After every doctor’s appointment, monitoring visit,
or blood test, she asked for a copy of her records from that day. Jackie’s records
often consisted of nothing more than her notations from the day’s blood work
results, which she would date and keep in a separate folder. Her records proved
invaluable during the course of her treatment. Seldom did Jackie have a ques-
tion that couldn’t be answered by reviewing her own information. She was
able to compare her results from different cycles to see how she was faring in
a historical sense. And, when the time came to switch doctors, Jackie had her
own history to present to her new doctor at the first visit.
Keeping your own records certainly provides you with a point of reference as
you go through your treatment. Doing so also allows you to double-check
doctor’s instructions and test results if the communication with your clinic is
less than perfect.
As a cautionary note (from one who knows!), try to avoid making your records
nighttime reading. If you bring this paperwork to bed with you, you may be
109
Chapter 7: Seeing a Doctor — and Keeping Your Cool

becoming a wee bit obsessive about the process. This type of behavior will
not help your cause or your sleeping patterns. A lighthearted magazine or
book that has nothing to do with fertility is a better sleep aid.
Reviewing your information periodically and having an extra set of records
for your files are very helpful to your treatment. Trying to diagnose yourself
based on your past performance is a job better left to the pros. Your records
are your backup. Your doctors are still the front line. 
Moving Up to Dr. Specialist
After seeing Dr. Basic for a few months, you may have a better idea of what
your fertility problems are, and you may decide that it’s time to see a special-
ist. Or perhaps your testing hasn’t shown any specific problems, and Dr. Basic
has decided you should move on to a specialist in infertility.
Finding Dr. Specialist
Your family doctor or gynecologist may hand you a piece of paper with the
name of an infertility specialist scribbled on it. “Go to this guy. He’s the best,”
she may say, and you may do just that, without thinking a whole lot about
alternative choices.
Before you set up your first appointment with Dr. Specialist, you may want to
ask Dr. Basic why she thinks the person she has suggested is the best. Does
the specialist have the best pregnancy rates, is he a prolific publisher in jour-
nals, or is he just a member of the same health organization?
Even worse, is he your doctor’s golfing buddy? Many doctors refer patients to
each other, and there’s nothing wrong with the practice of referral. That
system, however, doesn’t ensure that you’ll end up with the doctor best
suited to you, either.
Although the name that Dr. Basic gives you is a starting point, you should
check out other doctors, too, before making a final decision. At this point,
you will probably be looking for a specialist in the field, such as a reproduc-
tive endocrinologist.
Start with the phone book (or the internet). No, you’re not going to shut your
eyes and blindly poke your finger at a name. You can use the phone book as a
starting point, looking under the reproductive endocrinologists listing and
accumulating the names of doctors in your area. This approach gives you a
basic list from which to work and a starting point for some research.
110
Part II: Stepping Up Your Efforts 

Eliminate clinics that are too far away from you. “Too far away” is a subjec-
tive measure; if you work and have a very hectic lifestyle, more than 15 min-
utes away may be too far, and your options may be limited. If your schedule
is more flexible, an hour or even two may seem reasonable. Remember that
you may have to go in for blood and ultrasound monitoring several times a
month and that some clinics do all their monitoring early in the morning. You
may find that a clinic close to work is more convenient than one close to
home. If you must work with a clinic that is quite far, ask if you can have
some of the monitoring done in an office that is closer. Many RE’s work with
general OB/GYNs in your community who are perfectly adept at performing
basic ultrasounds and blood tests. That way, you only travel far for the actual
egg retrieval and/or embryo transfer.
Getting help from national organizations
If you have a core list of infertility clinics near you (if not, see the earlier sec-
tion, “Finding Dr. Specialist” to find out how to make this list), you need to
check each one out. You can visit each one, hanging around the waiting room
and questioning people as they come out the door. Or you can call your local
Resolve organization and see whether it has information on any of the offices
you’re considering. Resolve is the largest national organization dedicated to
the treatment of infertility.
If you have Internet access, finding your local Resolve organization is easy;
the Web site is www.resolve.org. Just click on the local chapter’s hyperlink
to find one near you. If you don’t have computer access, check your local
paper for listings of meetings or call Resolve’s HelpLine at 1-888-623-0744.
The Resolve Web site contains clinic success rates published by the Centers
for Disease Control (CDC). This information is compiled by the Society for
Assisted Reproductive Technology (SART), which you can read more about in
Chapter 10. These numbers give you some idea of your clinic’s success rates,
but keep in mind that these statistics are only for high-tech in vitro fertiliza-
tion (IVF) treatment, not for medium-tech treatment such as IUI (intrauterine
insemination). Keep in mind also that clinics that treat younger patients, or only
those who have not failed previously, are more likely to have higher success
rates. That’s why the SART Web site has a disclaimer about over-interpreting
success rates. 
Local Resolve meetings will probably connect you with people who can give
you the inside scoop on the local clinics, which may help narrow your search
or at least give you some ideas about where you don’t want to go!
The Resolve Web site contains a huge amount of information on insurance
coverage for infertility, adoption options, and information on clinical trials
111
Chapter 7: Seeing a Doctor — and Keeping Your Cool

and research studies being carried out around the country. Resolve is very
vocal in lobbying for insurance coverage for infertility treatments. The Web
site also has bulletin boards, lists of interesting meetings and events around
the country, and a host of other information. Check it out!
Another patient advocacy group is the American Fertility Association (the AFA).
Their website is www.theafa.org. This organization also has an active Web
site with message boards, access to articles about infertility issues, a physi-
cian referral hotline, and more!
Your area may have other groups that meet to help you deal with infertility.
Some are informal groups that started out as a few friends meeting to commis-
erate, and then grew into clubs with monthly meetings. You may also find local
psychologists or therapists who have started groups for infertile patients.
All of these are good resources for information on who’s good and who’s not
in your area. Always get more than one person’s opinion on a clinic because
each person may have a bias one way or the other, depending on her own
outcome.
Going online for more resources 
and information
Resolve isn’t the only information source online. In fact, after you start surf-
ing the Net, your sources of information will be limited only by the amount of
time you have to spend. Whether you’re interested in reading scientific jour-
nals, chatting with new friends online, or checking out clinic Web sites, we
guarantee that the Internet has enough stuff to keep you occupied until your
children leave for college!
Chat rooms and bulletin boards
Perhaps one of the greatest sources of information and strength on the road
to baby that Jackie found came from the countless women she encountered
in cyberspace, some of whom became friends in real time as well. Jackie hap-
pened upon this wealth of relating and resources right after a failed in vitro
fertilization attempt and a subsequent high FSH (follicle-stimulating hormone)
reading, which, at the time, seemed a death knell to any future attempts.
After a good cry, Jackie logged on to www.google.com to see what she could
find in reference to her new diagnosis of high FSH. Convinced that she was
the only one to suffer from this odd disorder (actually a measure of dimin-
ished ovarian egg reserve), Jackie was surprised at how quickly Google
returned a result listing over 38,000 Web pages on the topic. Okay, so maybe
a few others out there had the same problem after all. The first listing, High
FSH E-mail Group, connected her to a very lively, upbeat chat room. Through
112
Part II: Stepping Up Your Efforts 

teary eyes, she asked one and all if she was doomed. Jackie logged off in
despair and went to work her way through the other 37,999 sites. After visit-
ing two more sites, she went back to the chat room and was amazed to find at
least ten responses to her wail. She read each and every one, printed them all
(and has saved them to this day), and spent until the wee hours of the morn-
ing reading every message of encouragement and every link to more informa-
tion on high FSH, low FSH, infertility, and the best medical and nonmedical
sources for help, including doctors, clinics, acupuncturists, and herbs.
Jackie never left that site through the remaining year of her fertility battle.
From it, she garnered hope that she could conceive despite what her doctor
had told her. She also found a new (and improved) doctor who (eventually)
treated her successfully. Jackie also discovered insights on new treatments
and medications and located a 24/7 support network that accompanied her
through fertility, pregnancy, and all the stressors in between. She developed a
core group of friends from all over the country who were the first ones she
called when the pregnancy test came back negative and when it finally came
back positive. She can honestly say that her high FSH diagnosis was a bless-
ing, one that led her to a much greater place.
The beauty of the Internet is the availability of libraries full of information right
at our fingertips. Bulletin boards help provide links to this information, along
with the kinship so helpful in thriving through infertility. Man or woman, what-
ever problem that ails you, you can be almost certain that the Internet offers
a chat room/bulletin board filled with others facing the same struggles.
Doctors’ Web sites: Separating the glitter from the goods
When Sharon first started working for an infertility clinic, few infertility clin-
ics had Web sites. Now it seems as if every infertility clinic has a Web site.
Some are pretty basic, giving not much more than name, rank, and serial
number, and others run a 24-hour-a-day media show, complete with question-
and-answer sessions with the doctors, links to published articles, and testi-
monials from happy clients.
Some clinics list their Web site right next to their phone number in the phone
book; others direct you to their Web site when you call the office. Some Web
sites give detailed and frequently updated pregnancy rates. Other sites either
don’t supply or don’t update statistics.
Here’s what not to be impressed by when looking at clinic Web sites:
 The way the doctor looks: That picture may have been taken in 1963.
 Testimonials from patients: Unless you know the patients personally
and can verify what they say, you have no way of knowing who wrote
these glowing reports.
 How many articles the doctor has had published: Unless there’s a list-
ing of the articles, and you can see how long they were published and
113
Chapter 7: Seeing a Doctor — and Keeping Your Cool

where. It’s not hard these days to Google the journal and the article. But
a simple listing of “50 articles” is not helpful.
 Great graphics: Splashy visuals may indicate that the doctor has a son
or daughter who knows a lot about Web sites, but those graphics don’t
reveal anything about a doctor’s medical ability.
 Success rates: Be careful, only those on the SART website are actually
audited. Web site success rates are just an approximation of reality. 
You can be impressed by the following Web site information:
 Clearly written, user-friendly information 
 A list of clinic services
 Evidence that you will have access to the doctor or nurse with questions
or problems — these will arise!
 The doctors’ degrees and the schools from which they were obtained 
 The doctor’s board certifications and dates
 Lab certifications
Facing the Stranger in Your Sex Life —
Treatment and Your Privacy
When going through fertility treatment, you open the door to your private 
life — yes, including your sex life — for all the medical world to see. This loss
of privacy is bound to happen and takes some getting used to.
Talking sex
Your doctor (and his staff!) would rather discuss things other than your sex
life (like their sex lives for instance!). They will not discuss your private life 
in their private lives. Their job, however, is to help you conceive a baby, and
their inquiries are part of the process. Once again, consider this good train-
ing for pregnancy, when your body and your life will be oft-discussed topics
with your physicians, your friends, and even your in-laws.
The frequency of intercourse, the quality of your menstrual cycles, and your
past history of pregnancies, whether by hit or miss, are crucial bits of infor-
mation in piecing together your reproductive profile. Offer information gladly
because doing so only helps to educate your medical team. Feel free, however,
114
Part II: Stepping Up Your Efforts 

to leave out the details that truly define intimacy. Remember that sexual
intercourse is a biological process. Intimacy may occur in or out of the bed-
room, and the specifics of that are all your own.
Discussing dollars with the doctor
When Jackie visited Dr. Badadventure for the first time, she was quickly whisked
away to meet with Mr. Dollars and Sense, the finance guy. It should have been a
warning. Needless to say, her fertility experience with Dr. Badadventure cost
considerable dollars and yielded pennies in results.
We’re not saying that you should turn tail and flee when the mention of pay-
ment comes up. Fertility doctors and clinics are for-profit institutions, so
they’re permitted and expected to make money from their patients. Most 
clinics ask for payment upfront for certain procedures, including extensive
testing, surgery, and in vitro fertilization. Don’t be offended. Because many
insurers don’t cover fertility, doctors do need to guarantee payment for their
time, services, and staff. However, your initial health assessment and plan for
treatment should come before you receive a price list for procedures. If you
feel like you’re getting a hard sell toward high-tech fertility from the finance
guy (not the fertility doc), you probably are. If, however, your doctor deter-
mines, after careful review of you and your records, that high tech is the way
to go, expect the issue of cost and payment to come up. You don’t want to be
surprised by a bill in the tens of thousands of dollars. For more information
on dealing with the costs of fertility treatment, see Chapter 10.
Knowing When to Switch Doctors
So you’ve tried and tried and tried some more with your initial doctor of choice.
Despite your efforts, he or she isn’t sensitive to your needs, whether they’re
physical, emotional, or financial. Perhaps your doctor is stuck in a time warp of
sorts, insisting that eventually you’ll conceive naturally, or with minimal inter-
vention, despite the fact that you’ve been trying for months or years with no
success and a loudly ticking biological clock. Or else your doctor is pushing for
expensive, invasive treatment for which you don’t feel prepared. Your doctor
may be the sort who travels from one office to another, meaning that he or she
is virtually inaccessible, except for those occasional appointments.
Any of these reasons, or no particular reason at all, is perfectly understandable
in your decision to switch doctors. The personalities of some patients and
doctors just clash. For many, this alone can be a reason to run.
115
Chapter 7: Seeing a Doctor — and Keeping Your Cool

One thing to consider at any time during your treatment, (including before you
begin, by the way) is getting a second opinion. Infertility treatment is not only
very stressful, it can be extremely expensive. Before you plunk down $10,000,
it might be worthwhile to invest another $200 to $300 for a consultation with
another RE. It’s a little-known fact that the initial consultation with a doctor is
the biggest bargain at the infertility doctor’s office! A whole hour alone with
the doctor, reviewing records, making plans for the cost of what you’ll end up
paying for a single ultrasound which may take as little as 5 minutes! Your doctor
should understand that you want to consult with someone else. If he or she
doesn’t, that’s not a good sign. If you would rather not have to deal with the
stress of telling him or her, keep a copy of all your medical records for yourself.
That way, you not only know exactly what is going on, but are free at any time
to have another specialist review that information and give you a “thumbs up”
or “thumbs down” as the case may be about your treatment.

You’re feeling tired. You’ve charted your ovulation, timed your sex life,
and possibly even tried a few of the more basic fertility medicines. Nothing
has worked so far, and your doctor may be suggesting stepping up the pace,
as if the present pace isn’t hard enough. His advice may involve injecting
medications made from such odd ingredients as the urine of pregnant or
menopausal women. “Wait a minute!” you cry out. “Isn’t there another way?”
Yes, there are other ways, and you may have already tried one of them. In the
first stages of trying to conceive, you may have been met with the well-
intended, but unasked for, opinions of those who tell you to just relax and
you’ll get pregnant. Sometimes, this directive may actually work, but more
often it doesn’t. Now, as you prepare to move to the next level, the middle-
tech road to baby, you’ll more than likely hear of (and from!) others who
swear by other, nontraditional ways of conceiving.
Alternative therapies, which can include everything from acupuncture to
Traditional Chinese Medicine, from massage to meditation, have become a
popular means of either supplementing or substituting for the standard
“Western” approach to infertility (a.k.a. doctors, tests, and blood work). 

Some clinics are offering alternative services to their patients through liaisons
with providers. Others, while not adding to their staff, are allowing outside
providers to come into their clinics and service patients upon request, such
as acupuncture treatments before and after IVF embryo transfers.
In this chapter, we talk about those “other” ways to become pregnant, alter-
native measures from basic to beyond, and help you decide which ones are
worth trying and which ones may just result in expensive urination.
Eating for Two? Sampling a Fertility Diet
Eat meat if you want to get pregnant with a boy, and eat sugar if you want a
girl, an old wives’ tale states. But what if you just want to have a baby — of
any kind? When Jackie first ventured online to learn more about this road
that had become a little longer than she had first anticipated, she found an
entire civilization of people trying to conceive by using a variety of dietary
means, claiming that diet changes put them in tiptop reproductive shape.
These women (and men) had purged their diets of red meat, dairy products,
white flour, sugar, and a host of other staples that she viewed as necessary.
She was terrified. Their list of don’ts was Jackie’s diet in a nutshell.
Some people swore by omega-3 fatty acids, found most commonly in salmon
and other fish, as the magic potion for improving and/or restoring fertility.
The only fish Jackie consumed were Goldfish (those popular snack crackers,
that is). She thought she was in big trouble. The prospect of shots, whatever
they were made of, seemed more attractive to her than a complete overhaul
of her diet, but she didn’t want to skip what could be a crucial step. But is
your diet a factor when trying to get pregnant? A good rule of thumb is to
treat your body as though you were already pregnant. That way, when you
get there, you’ll already be in tune with your new state!
Here’s a brief look at some foods and our recommendations (our recommen-
dations may not help, but they certainly won’t hurt, and they do represent a
“common sense” way of eating):
 Red meat: Studies show that red meat can neither help nor hurt your
chances of getting pregnant. Trim all visible fat and cook the meat 
thoroughly.
Do not eat raw or undercooked fish, meat, or poultry when trying to get
pregnant or during pregnancy. These products have a higher than normal
chance of carrying listeria, a bacteria that may make a mom somewhat
ill but wreak havoc on an unborn child’s nervous system. Listeria has
also been linked to an increased rate of spontaneous abortion.
118
Part II: Stepping Up Your Efforts 

Many pregnant women are also advised to heat up luncheon meats
(sliced turkey, bologna, et al) which can also carry listeria. If you choose
to do so, heat the meat in a microwave and eat it while it’s still hot. Once
it cools, the bacteria can reform.
 Dairy: Many women trying to conceive cut dairy products from their
diet, but there’s no conclusive medical or scientific data that supports
the notion that dairy foods compromise fertility. Use organic products if
possible. If you’re lactose intolerant, dairy products can create havoc on
your system, so be aware of your personal dietary needs.
 White flour and processed sugar: No studies have proven that refined
sugar or processed flour decreases fertility. We recommend limiting
their intake.
 Artificial additives: Despite hot debate, no definitive studies prove that
additives such as aspartame and MSG are harmful. Limit or eliminate
these additives from your diet if the controversy worries you.
 Omega-3 fatty oils: Studies are underway to evaluate the use of omega-3
oils in male infertility and in women with endometriosis. Omega-3 oils,
present in fish, soybeans, flaxseed oil, canola oil, wheat germ, and wal-
nuts, have been shown to reduce heart disease. We recommend (and the
FDA/EPA guidelines also suggest) that you eat no more than 12 ounces of
fish each week and limit canned tuna to an occasional serving. Avoid
shark, swordfish, king mackerel, and tilefish (also called golden or white
snapper), tuna steak (fresh or frozen), orange roughy, Spanish mackerel,
marlin, and grouper because these fish are at the top of the food chain
and contain the highest levels of mercury.
 Soy: Some studies have shown that a very high soy intake may decrease
fertility, and soy may disturb thyroid function, decreasing fertility. The
recommendation: Skip the soy or limit it severely.
Soy is a source of phytoestrogens, weak estrogens that can enhance or
suppress natural estrogen production. Knowing whether you produce
enough, or too much, estrogen on your own is a part of the diagnostic
process in your fertility treatment. Confusing the matter with outside
sources of estrogen will do just that — confuse the matter. Keep it simple.
Good nutrition is something that you should not ignore. Consider it common
sense, as well as medical sense, that the healthier your body is, the healthier
all its systems, including the reproductive system, are. Nutrition is part of the
bigger picture that also includes such basics as getting enough sleep, exercis-
ing, and nourishing your body as well as your mind. Although good nutrition
is rarely the sole factor that brings about a baby, it does help to better pre-
serve your overall health so that you may enjoy your future child as well, and
as long, as possible.
119
Chapter 8: Taking Supplemental Steps on the Road to Baby

If you choose to opt for a complete nutritional overhaul, realize that this is a
long-term commitment and is unlikely to produce a quick fix for your fertility
issues. Books such as The Infertility Diet: Get Pregnant and Prevent Miscarriage,
by Fern Reiss, can provide you with a menu plan of fertility foods if you want
to try a complete dietary overhaul. For most people, this is a major lifestyle
change and may lead to better overall health. On the fertility front, however,
keep your expectations in check; diet changes alone are unlikely to get you
pregnant. And conversely, it is unlikely that your dietary habits, whatever
they are, are playing a large role in your infertility.
For those looking to take the more moderate road, consider planning your
diet around the major food groups that we discuss in Chapter 2. You may also
choose to consult a nutritionist to make sure that you get the proper balance
of vitamins and minerals. A good diet is a good idea whether you’re trying to
conceive or not.
The Controversy over Estrogen
The debate over possible side effects from the use of estrogen supplementa-
tion in menopause and in birth control pills (estrogen is the main hormone
responsible for female sex characteristics) has been raging since time began.
(But, really, it only seems that way.) Estrogen comes in several different
forms; the form most familiar to women is the synthetic estrogen called
ethinyl estradiol, which is found in birth control pills and some forms of hor-
mone replacement therapy. 
In 2005, the National Institutes of Health released the results of a long-term
study of more than 11,000 women on the effects of estrogen on post-menopausal
women undergoing hormone replacement therapy to relieve common meno-
pausal symptoms such as hot flashes, depression, and low libido. This double
blind (neither doctor nor patient knew whether the “drug” was in fact estro-
gen or a placebo) study sought to determine whether the use of estrogen
post menopause did in fact decrease the risk of heart disease and/or increase
the risk of cancer, primarily of the breast. 
The results showed that there was little decrease in the rate of heart disease
and an actual increase in the rate of breast cancer. The study was halted
immediately and women were advised to exercise caution in the use of hor-
mone replacement therapy. It was suggested that this use be as short term as
possible and to be determined through careful discussion between patient
and physician as to the benefits and possible risks involved (These findings
are still considered controversial and more data are being added. By the time
you reach menopause, one hopes some of the controversy will have been
resolved.)
120
Part II: Stepping Up Your Efforts 

However, menopausal estrogen therapy has very little to do with fertility
therapy. After all, your ovaries make estrogen (in the form of estradiol),
and this is a very important function. You look like a woman because of 
estradiol! And estradiol is necessary to develop a healthy egg, to thicken the
endometrium to get it ready for embryo implantation, to change the cervical
mucus to the thin “stretchy” kind, and so on, and so on!
So when your doctor prescribes estrogen to help the uterine lining, or to
“support the luteal phase”, or even to help women with POF to ovulate (see
Chapter 6 for more on POF), this is the same estradiol that your ovaries
would be making if everything were going well. 
So why is there a warning on the estrogen pills you get from the store, saying
you should not take them during pregnancy? Unfortunately, if women acci-
dentally take birth control pills during early pregnancy, the hormones may
have a bad effect on the fetus (girl fetuses can have changes in their genitals
that make them look more “masculinized”). However, birth control pills con-
tain not only synthetic estrogen in the form of ethinyl estradiol, but also a
synthetic progestin (usually a derivative of testosterone), which has the abil-
ity to cross the placenta and have effects on the developing fetus. Even
though this has nothing to do with natural estradiol, the drug companies are
obliged to put a warning on all forms of estrogen.
Hormones are not necessarily bad; in fact, they are needed to make pregnancy
happen. If in doubt, ask your doctor, and make sure that all the hormones
you take are “natural” and not “synthetic.” 
Looking at Supplements — Vitamins,
Minerals, Herbs, and More
Dietary supplements are very popular; one survey shows that over 40 percent
of all Americans use some form of supplement. Dietary supplements include
herbs, vitamins, minerals, amino acids, enzymes, and extracts. Because they’re
considered a dietary product rather than a medicinal product, they aren’t
regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration the way prescription
medications are. This lack of regulation means that the ingredient amount
may vary from one pill to the next. Supplements have also been found to be
contaminated with animal parts and toxic molds in some cases.
Because they’re sold over the counter, without a prescription, supplements
are often viewed as harmless. Studies have shown that many supplements are
far from harmless. Some supplements, such as ephedra, have been implicated
in causing death, and others, such as comfrey, can cause severe liver damage.
121
Chapter 8: Taking Supplemental Steps on the Road to Baby

Yet many naturopaths, who believe that the body will heal itself if kept in proper
balance, and herbalists tout supplements as a way to help get (and stay) preg-
nant. Internet sites abound with happy moms claiming that supplements were
responsible for their pregnancies. So who do you believe, and are there any
supplements that you absolutely should not take?
Herbs
Although herbs have been used for centuries, studies on their safety and ben-
efits have been few. That’s beginning to change, with the National Institutes
of Health (NIH) now studying many herbs and other alternative medications.
Herbs aren’t always benign, and someone with some knowledge of their inter-
actions should oversee their use. Practitioners in this area may include chiro-
practors, osteopaths, nutritionists, and naturopaths (those who employ a
drugless approach to keep the body in balance).
Here’s a look at some of the more popular herbs used in the treatment of
infertility. This list represents a small sample of herbs that can be used and
represents herbs that are both Western in origin as well as Chinese.
 Black cohosh: An herb with estrogenic qualities, black cohosh is often
used to relieve the discomfort associated with menopause (hot flashes,
for example). Studies have been mixed on whether black cohosh is effec-
tive. Black cohosh is also recommended to boost estrogen production,
although there’s no proof that this works. Side effects of black cohosh
are dizziness, nausea, low pulse rate, and increased perspiration.
 Dong quai: Dubbed the “ultimate herb” for women, dong quai is used for
everything from restoring menstrual regularity to treating menopausal
symptoms. Dong quai is a blood thinner and should not be taken during
an IVF cycle or by women who have very heavy periods.
 False unicorn root: Native Americans used this herb to improve men-
strual irregularities and to alleviate problems associated with menopause
and problems with infertility due to irregular follicular formation.
 Nettle leaves: This herb is considered to be an overall uterine tonic that
better prepares the uterus for implantation of the embryo. (There is no
scientific evidence for this.)
 Primrose oil: A fatty acid, primrose oil may increase cervical mucus to
make it easier for sperm to get to the egg. An unwanted side effect of
primrose oil may be thinning of the uterine lining, making implantation
more difficult.
 Red clover: This herb is often used to boost estrogen in a women’s
body. This exogenous, or outside the body, form of estrogen may raise
your estrogen levels artificially, which is meaningless if the rise isn’t
caused by the production of a mature egg.
122
Part II: Stepping Up Your Efforts 

 Red raspberry leaves: Another uterine toner, this herb reportedly
increases the uterine lining thickness (in order to make the uterus more
receptive to the embryo). Red raspberry causes uterine contractions
and absolutely should not be used in early pregnancy.
 Vitex: Also known as chaste tree berry, this herb has been used by
herbalists for many years to help regulate women’s hormones. Some use
Vitex to increase luteinizing hormone levels and help an egg release.
According to others, Vitex can also increase progesterone levels and
should be used only after you ovulate — not before. If taken earlier, it
may keep you from releasing an egg. If taken in the luteal phase, after
you ovulate, it may regulate and lengthen your cycle to give the embryo
a chance to implant. Vitex is slow acting, so it may take several months
for any effect to occur.
 Wild yam: In large doses, wild yam is used as a contraceptive; in smaller
doses, it may promote progesterone production. Don’t take wild yam
until after ovulation occurs.
The following herbs stimulate the uterus so you absolutely should not take
them after you get pregnant:
 Black cohosh
 Dong quai
 False unicorn root
 Feverfew
 Goldenseal
 Pennyroyal
In addition, avoid these drugs if you get pregnant:
 Blue cohosh: May cause fetal heart defects
 Mugwort: May cause fetal abnormalities
Herbal treatment of infertility is not a do-it-yourself approach! Let all your
doctors know whether you’re taking any kinds of herbs, whether they’re the
over-the-counter variety or prescribed to you by another source. Undesirable
reactions may occur between one herb preparation and another. In addition,
they may all cross-react with the drugs your reproductive endocrinologist is
giving you. Deciding what to take on your own is complicated, because the
same herb may be described as useful for two entirely opposing actions.
Telling your doctor that you are taking supplements is the very least that 
you should do!

Vitameatavegamin and all that jazz
A good multivitamin has the correct amounts of the vitamins you need, so
rarely do you need to supplement with additional vitamins. Your body takes
in only what it needs from water soluble vitamins (generally the maximum
recommended daily dose found in most multivitamins) and urinates out the
rest (talk about good money down the drain!). In addition, overdoing it on
some vitamins can cause adverse reactions in your system. Excess amounts
of fat soluble vitamins, such as vitamin A, are stored in your body instead of
being excreted. Although adequate levels of vitamin A help to preserve your
vision and immune system, an excess of vitamin A can result in liver disease
and birth defects when taken by pregnant women. So, yes, you can really
have too much of a good thing.
Overdosing on vitamins through foods alone is highly unlikely. Because most
foods contain small amounts of any individual vitamin or nutrient, you would
have to eat bushels of bananas, oranges, or spinach to get too much. Over-
dosage of any particular vitamin, mineral, or nutrient is generally only a danger
if you consume it in a concentrated form, such as vitamin pills or powders.
Is taking a prenatal vitamin when trying to conceive premature? Not really.
The primary difference between multivitamins and prenatal vitamins is the
greater concentration of folic acid and iron in a prenatal vitamin. Folic acid is
crucial in pregnancy to help prevent spinal and neural tube defects, while
iron is often needed as a supplement for the loss of iron due to pregnancy. An
excess of iron can result in constipation, which can be remedied through the
introduction of additional fibers, fruits, and vegetables in your diet, a good
thing no matter where you are on the baby-making quest.
Over-the-counter (OTC) prenatal vitamins may boast that they contain even
higher levels of the necessary vitamins and nutrients. In order to achieve
this, however, the OTC brand may require dosages up to three times a day
while prescription prenatal vitamins pack their punch in one dose per day. If
you’re feeling childlike, even though you’re not with child yet, you can also
get the same ingredients of a prenatal vitamin by taking three Flintstones
Complete vitamins per day.

Lydia Pinkham’s tonic
For half a century, Lydia Pinkham’s Vegetable
Compound was a best-selling “medicinal” used
by women for a variety of female complaints,
including problems with menstruation and
symptoms of menopause. Whether the drug
was so beloved because of its high black
cohosh content or the 36-proof alcohol in the
bottle is something we’ll never know. But if you
have an old bottle of this sitting around some-
where (it’s still manufactured, but with different
ingredients), don’t dump it — antique collectors
will be glad to take it off your hands!

If you’re taking a standard multivitamin rather than prenatal vitamins while
pregnant, make sure that it doesn’t contain extra ingredients such as herbs.
Many health food stores sell blends that contain herbs. Don’t take these
types of vitamins during pregnancy.
Are certain vitamins, taken in greater (or lesser) quantity, more likely to
result in increased fertility? At the time of this writing, no direct evidence
supports this. We advise you to stick with a standard multivitamin or prena-
tal vitamin. Your local pharmacist can recommend a good OTC brand, and
your doctor can steer you toward a good prescription choice.
Some studies have shown that liquid prenatal vitamins are better absorbed
than pills. They may also be less likely to make you nauseated after you
become pregnant.
All the vitamins in the world won’t get you pregnant, but they will help you
keep your body in the best nutritional shape possible, along with proper diet,
exercise, and general care. This balanced state is the best place for babies to
come from!
Folic acid
Folic acid, a B vitamin, is essential when trying to get pregnant. Many studies
have shown that 0.4 mg of folic acid a day cuts the chance of having a baby
with neural tube defects by 50 percent. Neural tube defects occur in 6 of
10,000 births in the United States and include problems with the spine and
brain. Neural tube defects develop very early in pregnancy, in the first four
weeks, so taking a good multivitamin containing this amount while trying to
get pregnant is essential. Many foods, including leafy green vegetables, forti-
fied cereals, orange juice, and lean beef, contain folic acid, but overcooking
can destroy folic acid, so take a vitamin even if you eat well.
Wheatgrass
For Jackie, it was a litmus test. When she dropped a wheatgrass pill on the
floor, her basset hound (also known as the canine garbage disposal) raced
toward it. Before she could grab it, he had it in his mouth. Then, to her disbe-
lief, the dog, who has been known to view dead squirrel as a delicacy, dropped
the wheatgrass pill and scurried away. It was not a testament to taste.
Despite Jackie’s dog’s opinion, many others claim that taking regular shots of
wheatgrass (meaning a liquid taken in a shot glass, not through injection) or
a daily handful of pills has lowered their FSH (follicle-stimulating hormone)
levels, allowing for better egg production and/or egg quality.
125
Chapter 8: Taking Supplemental Steps on the Road to Baby

What is wheatgrass anyway? Wheatgrass is a dark, leafy, green vegetable 
that can be harvested, dried, and bottled in pill form. Some people attest that
the homegrown or fresh-grown variety is better and raise their own wheatgrass
from seed, later shaving off the grass and blending it into a questionable-
looking green froth. Many health food stores do this blending for you; how-
ever, you still must drink the stuff. In all honesty, wheatgrass juice is fairly fla-
vorless, with a slightly sweet taste and an aroma similar to, well, freshly cut
grass! You probably won’t find a wheatgrass-flavored Blizzard at Dairy Queen
anytime soon, however. Many people follow up a wheatgrass shot with a
“chaser” of fresh vegetable juice.
Wheatgrass is an antioxidant, meaning that it can cleanse your body of impu-
rities and toxins. It’s also used to build hemoglobin (iron stores) in the blood,
reduce blood pressure, and keep your hair from going gray.
Regarding the claims that wheatgrass lowers FSH levels and thus improves
the number and/or quality of eggs, remember that you’re born with a limited
number of eggs that only decrease over time. There is virtually no way to
increase that number or to change a bad egg into a good one. FSH is merely a
measurement of ovarian reserve and is generally checked to determine the
probable response to stimulation via fertility medicines.
L-arginine
L-arginine is another example of a product that has received cult status over
the past few years for treating everything from immune disorders to sexual
problems. L-arginine is a nonessential amino acid found in whole wheat, rice,
nuts, seeds, corn, soy, grapes, carob, and other foods. Nonmedical individu-
als in the fertility community have used L-arginine (also known as arginine) in
126

Ann Wigmore, the mother of wheatgrass
Wheatgrass as a way to good health was pop-
ularized by Ann Wigmore (1909–1994), who
immigrated to the United States at a young age
from Eastern Europe. She believed that wheat-
grass cured the insanity of King Nebuchadnezzar
in the Old Testament after he was forced to live
on grasses for seven years while wandering the
fields. She also believed that the fact that ani-
mals ate grass when they were ill showed the
value of eating various grasses. Her ideas
became well known through her many books 
on the subject of raw diet and through her
Hippocratic Health Institute. She was sued sev-
eral times for claiming her elixir could cure
AIDS or prevent cancer. Her institute is still
active as the Wigmore Foundation. “Dr. Ann,”
as she was known, had no medical degree and
was a self-taught naturopath. (Naturopaths
believe that the body will heal itself if balance is
maintained.)

concentrated pill form during fertility cycles in efforts to improve egg quality.
Some studies also show increased blood flow to the uterus. In males, some
studies (but not all) have shown increased sperm motility and production
when taking L-arginine.
A study published by the professional journal Human Reproduction pointed
out a negative effect of L-arginine if you’re taking fertility medications. The
study showed that in a small test group, the use of L-arginine supplementa-
tion was detrimental to embryo quality and pregnancy rate during a sample
cycle when the test also used fertility medicines.
If you’re prone to cold sores, L-arginine may exacerbate them. Use with caution.
Like many supplements, L-arginine can cause adverse reactions at higher
doses when taken in pill form as a supplement. It is virtually impossible to
overdose on the amount of L-arginine found in foods, as even foods that con-
tain it have it only in trace amounts. However, L-arginine can reach less than
desirable levels when taken in more concentrated forms, such as pills.
Pregnant women are advised not to use L-arginine.
Natural doesn’t necessarily mean safe. If your fertility doctor prescribes any
medication for you, let him or her know of any other herbs, pills, or treat-
ments that you’re already taking, in order to prevent a possible harmful drug
interaction.
A walk down the aisle at a local “health food supplement” store to peruse the
ingredients in all the bottles t may shock you! There are “natural” remedies
that were made from animal thyroid glands, adrenal glands, and other parts
of animals. Yet nowhere on the label does it warn the consumer that products
made from animal thyroid glands contain thyroid hormone, which is identical
to the one made by humans! This thyroid hormone is available without a pre-
scription, in purity that could not be assessed and in doses that could not be
determined! And products made from adrenal glands of course contain adrenal
hormones, which include steroids (such as cortisol), adrenalin, and so on.
All of these can and do have real physiologic effects on humans, and those
trying to conceive are especially vulnerable.
Supplements for better sperm production
Fertility is not just a female issue. In fact, 40 percent of the time, male factor
is responsible for a couple’s failure to conceive.
So women aren’t the only ones who may venture onto an alternative path for
treating medical problems related to infertility. Keep in mind that studies
have been mixed (at best) as to the efficacy of taking supplements. Also
remember that in male problems where surgery is deemed necessary (to fix a
127
Chapter 8: Taking Supplemental Steps on the Road to Baby

varicocele or any other structural issue), diet and/or supplements won’t do
the trick. These tips, however, can benefit overall health, which can contribute
to better reproductive health. A man produces new sperm every three months,
so what you do today can theoretically affect conception down the line. The
following supplements have been suggested to benefit sperm count and motil-
ity in some studies (but note that as with women, no conclusive evidence
exists, and, just as with women, too much of a good thing can be quite toxic,
never mind counterproductive):
 Zinc: Suggested to increase sperm motility and sperm count
 Vitamin B12: Suggested to increase sperm count
 Vitamin C: Suggested to increase sperm count
 Vitamin E: Suggested to increase sperm motility
 Selenium: Suggested to increase sperm motility
 L-Carnitine: Suggested to increase sperm motility and sperm count
 L-arginine: Suggested to increase sperm motility and sperm count
 Folic acid: Suggested to increase sperm motility and sperm count
 CoQ10: Suggested to increase sperm motility and sperm count
A good multivitamin will generally contain an adequate amount of all of the
preceding.
Visiting a Traditional Chinese 
Medicine Practitioner
Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), often referred to as Eastern medicine,
works on a different set of principles and beliefs than Western medicine (that
which is practiced in the United States and many other parts of the world).
Traditional Chinese medicine views the individual as an integral mind/body
organism and, in essence, believes that a delicate balance, the yin and yang,
is necessary for optimal health and well-being. TCM divides the body into
various meridians, or pathways, along which qi, or energy, flows. For example,
fertility problems might be explained by liver qi stagnation, that is, congestion
in the liver meridian. Primary treatment in TCM includes the administration
of herbal formulas and acupuncture to clear the body passageways and
restore normal function.
Although traditional Chinese medicine has been practiced since 204 B.C., only
during the past two decades has it been recognized in the United States and
other parts of the world. According to Western medicine, anecdotal evidence,
as demonstrated in TCM, awaits confirmation in randomized clinical trials. 
128
Part II: Stepping Up Your Efforts 

Despite this lack of scientific evidence, many patients, suffering from diseases
ranging from cancer to chronic fatigue to infertility, have found a haven in the
TCM community, which many times is warmer and fuzzier than the classic
Western doctor/hospital setting. Some who have given up on Western medicine
(or on whom Western medicine has given up) have found palliative relief, remis-
sion, and results under the guidance of a traditional Chinese medicine doctor.
Before you jump on the TCM bandwagon, check the credentials of the practi-
tioner whom you select. TCM doctors must complete training, just as they do
in Western medicine, and should be licensed or certified (if your state offers
this). In addition, they should be nationally certified through the National
Certification Commission for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine. To confirm
certification, visit the commission’s Web site at www.nccaom.org.
Help from herbal formulas
Your TCM practitioner may prescribe an herbal formula containing up to ten
different herbs. The combination of herbs to create a formula is one of the
main differences between the Western and Eastern views. TCM relies on this
ability to modify formulas in order to customize an individual approach
based on a patient’s needs. TCM herbal formulas are also available in pills
that can be purchased from your TCM practitioner; however, they’re consid-
ered to be less effective due to the extraction process necessary to convert
them into this form.
Because there are over 6,000 herbs from which to choose, this formulation is
a science in and of itself and, unlike the single-ingredient, Western herb
approach, can’t be self-administered.
Most TCM practitioners also use moxibustion, in which small mounds of herbs
are burned over certain areas of the body, in the treatment of infertility. TCM
practitioners also treat male infertility issues, so feel free to go as a couple.
Don’t view traditional Chinese medicine as a shortcut. Nothing in medicine
ever is. The treatments require consistency and commitment, but they may
provide you with a more palatable process than Western treatments.
We also recommend that you “pick your poison,” for lack of a better term.
Whether your treatment is traditional Chinese medicine or Western medicine,
don’t try to combine the two. Many herbs, when taken with fertility medi-
cines, can cause adverse reactions. Particularly when combined with treat-
ments that involve surgical procedures, such as in vitro fertilization, the
ingestion of herbs or other tonics can cause more severe problems, such as
bleeding, or simply complicate matters. As a result, both your TCM doctor
and your Western doctor may find it impossible to accurately define and treat
your condition.
129
Chapter 8: Taking Supplemental Steps on the Road to Baby

If you choose to try both TCM and Western medicine simultaneously (despite
our suggestions to the contrary), make sure that all of your practitioners, doc-
tors, and nurses, are aware of your protocol. Not revealing this information is
an ideal way to confuse the people whose goals are to help you conceive.
On pins and needles — acupuncture 
for infertility
Perhaps one area of traditional Chinese medicine that has benefited the most
from the recent interest on behalf of Western medicines is acupuncture.
Acupuncture is based on the belief that a person’s health is determined by a
balanced flow of energy (qi) in the body. This 5,000-year-old practice is most
often used to relieve chronic pain by inserting needles into a variety of pres-
sure points on the head and body. Acupuncture is also used for treatments
for everything from the common cold to drug addiction.
In April 2002, a study in the prestigious medical journal Fertility and Sterility
cited evidence that acupuncture, when used in conjunction with in vitro fertil-
ization, notably improved pregnancy rates. In the study involving 160 patients,
acupuncture was performed just prior to the transfer of embryos into the
uterus and again after the transfer took place. Needles were inserted along
the spleen and stomach meridians, as well as other sites, in an effort to 
stimulate blood flow to the uterus. Of the acupuncture group, 42 percent got
pregnant, compared to 26 percent of the nonacupuncture group. The sedative
effect of acupuncture is also believed to assist in relaxing a woman, quieting
her uterus, and making it more receptive to embryos.
Although this study will require additional follow-up to make sure that the
previous results were not psychosomatic and are indeed repeatable, the find-
ings were certainly of great interest to those in the fertility community.
Acupuncture has long been a popular alternative form of treatment for infer-
tility. Many women have used this treatment in hopes of increasing blood
flow to the uterus, thus helping to thicken the uterine lining. Other women
have found that acupuncture has been crucial in helping them relax through
the trials and tribulations of fertility treatment.
Whether its effects are actually physiological or not, acupuncture is an excel-
lent adjunct to a fertility regimen. However, be sure that those performing the
treatment are certified. Many fertility clinics work in conjunction with an
acupuncturist and/or can recommend someone who specializes in fertility-
based treatment.
Many states have their own acupuncture society, and some states have spe-
cific requirements that must be met. For example, in Indiana, people need a
130
Part II: Stepping Up Your Efforts 

prescription from a physician in order to be treated by a certified acupunc-
turist. You can check online for your state’s rules and regulations, as well
as for acupuncture societies, which may also provide you with specific 
recommendations.
If you’re scared of being stuck with acupuncture needles, take heart! The
average acupuncture needle has the thickness of a human hair. You may feel
a small stick, but it’s far less discomfort than a blood test. But if you’re still a
bit apprehensive and too needle-phobic about the procedure, you may be
better off skipping this particular form of treatment. Remember that the goal
is to relax.
Bring along a favorite tape or CD to listen to during acupuncture treatment.
Most acupuncture treatments require you to lie still with the needles in place
for a short period of time, usually 20 minutes or less. This may also be a great
time to use your visualization techniques (see “The Eyes Have It: Visualizing
Your Baby,” later in this chapter).
The Eyes Have It: Visualizing Your Baby
Have you ever come across an individual who appeared to set her mind on
something and ultimately achieve it? Some credit this ability to positive
thinking, while others say it’s dumb luck.
Philosophers through the ages have said that if you change your mind, you
change your life. Now, no amount of positive thinking will reverse uterine or
tubal scarring that may be preventing conception, but your attitude can cer-
tainly help you walk whatever path you’re on with greater ease and peace.
A study conducted by the American Society of Reproductive Medicine
(ASRM, the medical organization for fertility professionals) saw a marked
improvement in the response of in vitro fertilization patients who showed a
more positive attitude going into the process. These findings were noted in
the number of eggs produced, quality of eggs, and the overall pregnancy rate.
Indeed, very few people doubt the negative impact of stress on all areas of
your life and your health.
Visualizing your goal, whether it’s to move peacefully through the process of
fertility or to imagine the feeling of holding your own child, is a wonderful
tool for both relaxation and focus. Legions have sworn by the teachings of
Shakti Gawain, Deepak Chopra, and others whose books and tapes can lead
you through the journey to your goals. Visualization can help you identify the
skills (such as persistence, patience, or diligence) that can help you reach
your goal and can also help you name and let go of those traits that may
stand in your way.
131
Chapter 8: Taking Supplemental Steps on the Road to Baby

Jackie found moments of peace, along with the occasional glide into a nap,
while listening to Shakti Gawain’s Creative Visualization tape. She listened to
that tape on her personal tape player while waiting in many a fertility doctor’s
office and found that it helped her escape a difficult or painful situation by
refocusing her thoughts. This consistent, positive reinforcement helped her
to turn down the volume on the voices of naysayers, including herself.
Saying Om: Meditation and Yoga
For those who need a little more help than self-help, consider the structure
of a class such as meditation or yoga. Although they’re not cure-alls, these
ancient arts can go a long way in easing your body and spirit.
Staying sane through the process is a goal that can carry you through your
fertility rites. This goal is something you can control, and meditation or yoga
can help. Check with your local gyms or wellness centers to see whether they

How do you spell relief? R-e-l-a-x
Medical researchers have known for some 
time about what’s called relaxation response,
which is defined as a series of physiological
changes that occur when a person blocks out
intrusive thoughts by repeating a word, a sound,
a phrase, or a prayer. Relaxation response can
cause a decrease in metabolism, heart rate,
rate of breathing, and brain wave activity.
When used in conjunction with nutrition and
exercise, relaxation response has been proven
to be effective therapy in treating a number of
conditions, including cardiac disease, chronic
pain, symptoms associated with cancer and
HIV/AIDS, anxiety, mild and moderate depres-
sion, and the stress brought on by infertility and
its treatments.
Some research says that infertile women are
twice as likely to experience depressive symp-
toms as fertile women. No matter how large or
small the effect may be, excessive stress and
depression can certainly contribute to or exac-
erbate infertility.
Jackie participated in a six-week program that
applied the techniques of relaxation response
conducted by a nurse who worked for a local
fertility clinic. Although she was initially skepti-
cal about the benefits, she did find the relax-
ation techniques, nutritional information, open
dialogue, and camaraderie to be helpful.
Partners were invited to participate in the last
class of the session, where everyone focused
on communication skills to better express their
individual problems and fears related to their
infertility and treatment. She enjoyed this oppor-
tunity immensely, and her husband appreciated
the refreshments.
To find out more about workshops in relaxation
response in your area, ask your doctor (ideally
your OB/GYN or a fertility specialist) or contact
your local chapter of Resolve by visiting

have classes. Or ask your family or fertility doctor to recommend a particular
class or instructor. You may be surprised at how many medical folks use the
same techniques to bring peace to their own lives.
Both meditation and yoga can carry you through your pregnancy as well.
Meditation can help relieve the discomfort and pain of everything from morn-
ing sickness to labor, and yoga can keep your gestating (or pregnant!) body fit
and focused all the way through.
Massaging Away What Ails You
If you’re more relaxed with a hands-on approach, consider massage. Although
no evidence proves that regular massage improves fertility or increases the
likelihood of pregnancy, few people question its ability to relax the body and
mind. And although relaxation itself won’t get you pregnant, it certainly
makes the fertility process a little more tolerable.
Consider massage as a healthy, lowfat, guiltless way to reward yourself as
you go through the fertility process (or any other stress-producing activity
for that matter!). If the hormones, either naturally produced or artificially
added, are getting you down, schedule a Swedish massage. Other, more vigor-
ous forms of massage, such as shiatsu, may be useful in energizing your body.
Some people believe that massage helps promote better blood flow.
Although massage can be very beneficial, make sure that your massage thera-
pist knows that you’re trying to conceive. Massaging certain areas can be
harmful during pregnancy. Your massage therapist should be aware that you
could be pregnant during this process, and she should be skilled in what
areas to focus on and what areas to avoid.
A few clinics nationwide claim high success rates with the practice of deep
muscle massage and internal massage to reduce or eliminate scar tissue such
as endometriosis and other types of structural anomalies that might prevent
pregnancy. Little proof supports these claims, as no one has shown that mas-
saging away excess or scar tissue is possible. Take great care if pursuing this
type of treatment. Internal massage can be detrimental, if not just painful,
expensive, and altogether unnecessary.
Distinguishing the glitter from the goods
As with anything that involves entrusting your mind, body, or heart, it’s
important to know just WHO the trustworthy people and practices may be.
As Alternative Medicine has grown, so have the resources that support it.
133
Chapter 8: Taking Supplemental Steps on the Road to Baby

The National Institutes of Health (NIH), long considered the Gold Standard on
determining protocol in the medical field, is now also dipping their feet in the
water when it comes to alternative medicines and treatment. The National
Center for Alternative and Complimentary Medicine is now a department of
NIH, designed to investigate the efficacy, safety, and mechanisms of action of
diverse complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) modalities. More
definitive findings on many varieties of treatments will become available in
the coming years. For now, you can check their Web site at nccam.nih.gov
to keep up with the latest findings.
As we mentioned earlier, some clinics and physicians are working with one or
more alternative providers in order to offer these options to patients. Ask
your doctor or nurse if your facility works with anyone in particular (in what-
ever specialty area in which you’re interested) or if they have recommenda-
tions for outside providers.
How about finding out the scoop on who the alternative practitioners in your
area are? Services such as The Anji Connection (www.anjiconnection.com)
offer a free and interactive Web site to locate alternative providers of all vari-
eties in your city or town. You can use a resource such as this to read up on
what different providers offer, charge, and who might best fit your needs.
Ultimately, the proof is in the pudding and someone who looks great on paper
may not work for you. Consider using resources such as this to narrow your
search and then arrange time(s) to meet with the provider(s) by phone or in
person to determine if you have the right match.
No one can or should guarantee you success! Physicians are prohibited from
making promises due to their professional codes, rules, and regulations. This
may not apply to alternative providers. If someone tries to promise you a
pregnancy “if only you” (pick one): sign on the dotted line, write a check,
make a long term commitment . . . run! Alternative medicine is another option
for treatment, not a magic cure.
Seeking Help from On High
When you’re caught up in the minutiae of fertility management (and there’s
plenty of minutiae!), you may have trouble seeing your daily struggles as part
of a larger plan designed by a power greater than yourself. Whatever your
faith, solace and relief are available to you.
Jackie has witnessed many women online and in person walking through the
fertility process with confidence as they placed their fears and worries in the
hands of their God, a special saint, or an icon. Many chat rooms started their
own prayer group. And although many people claim to be disbelievers, the
old adage “there are no atheists in foxholes” seems to be true. Online prayer
groups grew at a lightning pace, bearing the names of those who were pious
by nature, as well as those who just figured prayer couldn’t hurt. And it can’t.
134
Part II: Stepping Up Your Efforts 

Through the ages, certain groups have turned to the power of prayer for heal-
ing the sick and giving sight to the blind. A study was released in the United
States in early 2002 that claimed that patients in a test group who were
prayed for by outside individuals made a quicker and better recovery than
those who weren’t. Some physicians scoff at this notion. However, many
people find credence in the idea that prayer helps patients relax and, in doing
so, helps them to release whatever stranglehold they may have on their con-
dition and to stop trying to force results. This type of help may make what-
ever road you travel a little less bumpy.
Individuals and couples may also benefit from the moderation of a third party,
such as a priest, rabbi, or other religious figure. These professionals often act
as counselors to help an individual or couple work through problems resulting
from outside stressors, such as fertility. Religious leaders also respect your
privacy and maintain confidences just as a therapist or doctor does. Their
consideration of all things spiritual may also help to reveal another point of
view or option. If nothing else, your local clergy can provide additional sup-
port, something that you can never get enough of, regardless of your situation.
Exercising without Overdoing It
Jackie found that one of the most difficult parts of infertility and its treatments
was the loss of certain aspects of her life (for example, free time that she used
to have was now spent running from one doctor appointment to another). As
an avid runner, Jackie questioned her exercise routine and wondered whether
the constant jarring might be preventing her from getting pregnant. She asked
her doctor, who recommended moderate exercise. Jackie’s not the type of
person who understands the word moderate, regardless of its context. She
decided not to take any chances and replaced running with a workout on a
stair-climbing machine. After a few more months of failed attempts at preg-
nancy, she reevaluated the stair-climbing workout as well. And so it went until
she was reduced to walking, which also became a personal no-no during the
two-week wait after the time of ovulation. As the fertility bar seemed to get
higher and higher, her stress management tools, such as exercise, had dimin-
ished to almost nothing. It was not a pretty sight.
Regular exercise is a good thing when trying to conceive, just as it is at almost
any time in your life (except maybe when you’re in traction). The key is to par-
ticipate in moderate (there’s that word again) activity that’s consistent with
your past routines. For example, if your previous exercise plan consisted of
wind sprints to the refrigerator and back, training for your first marathon while
trying to conceive isn’t a wise idea. Some doctors recommend keeping your
heart rate to a maximum of 140 beats per minute. You can use this as a guide to
help build your exercise plan. When it comes to nonaerobic activity, the sky is
(virtually) the limit. Again, use common sense when making your choices. Full-
contact boxing may be a bit more precarious during this time (actually during
any time!), but kickboxing for fitness could be a good compromise.
135
Chapter 8: Taking Supplemental Steps on the Road to Baby

If you’re someone who overexercises as a means to lose weight, your behavior
could affect your fertility. Check with your doctor to make sure that you’re
within the proper weight limits. Carrying too little weight can affect your men-
strual cycle as well as your hormones, therefore compromising your ability to
conceive.
Above all, no matter what exercise in which you engage, stay well hydrated at
all times. Doing so is especially important when trying to conceive and even
more so while pregnant. Wear comfortable clothing and be aware of how you
feel at all times. Exercise shouldn’t be painful — ever! If it is, stop, rest, and
consult a trainer or exercise physiologist before resuming your routine.
Ironically, after tiring of her lack of exercise and treating her body as though
it was spun glass, Jackie began running again during her third year of trying
to conceive. After one month of resuming her former exercise routine, she
found out she was pregnant. Go figure.
Evaluating the Good and the 
Bad of Antidepressants
Few conditions seem to warrant the use of an antidepressant more than infer-
tility. The insecurity brought on by the inability to conceive, the physical and
psychological stress associated with treatment, and the repeated disappoint-
ments seem to be the perfect setup for creating a person in need of a little
more help. Indeed, infertile women are twice as likely to experience depres-
sion as fertile women.
As with all things medical, refrain from diagnosing yourself. No matter how
much your symptoms fit the latest commercial for Paxil, Prozac, or Zoloft,
you still need to be evaluated by a psychiatrist (the only mental health pro-
fessional who can prescribe medication).
Your fertility doctor can, and may, offer to put you on antidepressants to help
you over the hump. Some doctors aren’t sure of the long-term effects and
may prefer to avoid them. Still other physicians use antidepressants as part
of their fertility treatments (particularly when addressing immune issues). Be
aware, however: Antidepressants aren’t benign medications, and you shouldn’t
take them as such. You’re better off being evaluated by a doctor who special-
izes in this area. Your fertility doctor, general practitioner, or therapist can
certainly refer you to an appropriate specialist. You can also ask for recom-
mendations from friends or family if you feel comfortable doing so, or you
can contact your local mental health center and keep your request anonymous.
136
Part II: Stepping Up Your Efforts 

Don’t start taking your sister’s or your best friend’s antidepressant prescrip-
tion. These drugs are individually dosed, based on a person’s needs, size, and
medical history.
No significant long-term studies have been done on the effects of antidepres-
sants on fertility. The jury is still out on these relatively new medications
(which have been on the market 20 years or less), and no conclusive results
of the effect of these medications on fertility may be available for many years.
Antidepressants, however, do have some side effects that may affect fertility.
Decreased sexual desire is among the possible reactions, possibly opening
the door to other reproductive interaction. Antidepressants can also dry up
cervical mucus, which is crucial in transporting the sperm to the egg and in
helping to build up the uterine lining. You and your fertility doctor are the
best judge as to whether you’re experiencing these side effects.
Ultimately, as with most medications, you must weigh the pros and cons
when deciding whether to take antidepressants. Depression can be consum-
ing and can affect your health, work, relationships, and, consequently, your
fertility. If you’re suffering through this, the uncertain risks of antidepres-
sants may be far outweighed by your need for relief.
Taking a Break from Your Fertility 
“Job” — You Deserve It
When all else fails to help you relax, consider taking off, whether that’s a
break from your efforts or a real vacation!
Fertility often becomes a job with no benefits and dismal working conditions.
Just like any job, time off is necessary in order to clean your mind, refresh
your spirit, and come back to greet another day with your best efforts.
Many individuals and couples take anywhere from a few weeks to a few years
off from the process of trying to conceive. This doesn’t mean adhering to a
celibate lifestyle. Instead, it’s a reintroduction to sex sans schedule, trying to
conceive a baby the old-fashioned way. Obviously, your age and condition are
critical in determining just how much time away from fertility treatment you
can spare, but a short respite will probably do nothing but refresh you. Try to
avoid feeling guilty for needing the break. Actually, in giving your mind and
body the time and space they need, you’re taking the best possible care of
yourself. And don’t minimize your partner’s need for a break either. He may
need a respite from “performing” on demand, undergoing batteries of tests,
137
Chapter 8: Taking Supplemental Steps on the Road to Baby

or just providing you with the support you need, but he may not feel comfort-
able suggesting it.
Getting away from the daily grind also helps you to gain a better perspective
and make decisions that best suit you, your partner, and your living style.
Some people can do this by taking a fertility-free weekend that includes no
discussion of anything to do with physicians, fertility, treatments, or future
plans. Others find it necessary to truly get away from home. You’ll be amazed
by the perspective and peace that you can gain from a well-needed vacation.
And although we don’t advise planning a vacation with the hidden agenda of
making this getaway the one that does the trick, perhaps it will! In the mean-
time, throw caution and your medical records to the wind and relax. Your
baby will wait for you.

Chapter 9
Are We Having Fun Yet? Trying to
Conceive and Your Relationship
In This Chapter
 Staying in touch with your partner’s feelings — and your own
 Surviving the effects of stress on your relationship
 Seeing a counselor
“W
hy oh why can’t a ‘growth experience’ ever be fun?” lamented a
popular sitcom character in a line that drew plenty of canned and
real laughs. While making a baby certainly has all the right ingredients for a
good time, once infertility is stirred into the pot, fun becomes a concept
reserved for those for whom sex has remained — well, just sex. 
In this chapter, we discuss how to traverse the lost and found sections of the
couples fun department. While infertility certainly has its share of growth
opportunities, which are anything but a good time, your relationship can
actually grow in a positive manner, helping you and your partner learn ways
to support and love one another through the rough spots. Consider all these
learning experiences good practice for the many challenges that child rearing
will offer you!
Navigating the Relationship 
Pitfalls of Infertility 
Experiencing infertility can take your relationship to a whole new level--one
you could probably live without. Human relationships are rarely improved by
the addition of stress, frustration, anger and recriminations, at least not until
the crisis is over and some perspective on the situation can be gained.
The potential loss of a dream as big as a family of your own can be devastat-
ing in a number of ways. The pitfalls you fall into while trying to navigate the
uncharted waters of infertility will depend on your personalities, the way you

relate to each other normally, and sometimes just on the time of day or the
weather! In the next sections, we look at some of the common relationship
challenges couples dealing with infertility may face.
This is easy! Early misconceptions 
about conception
Most couples start trying to get pregnant with barely a thought that success
might not be immediate. Most couples are more afraid to start trying too
soon, worrying more that they’ll get pregnant the first month of trying. It usu-
ally comes as a complete shock to discover that pregnancy can, even under
normal conditions, take up to six months or more to achieve.
A few months of negative pregnancy tests can be hard to process, intellectu-
ally and emotionally, when everyone else seems to be able to get pregnant so
easily. “I never thought I’d be at this point,” Jackie remembers lamenting to
herself, and anyone else who would listen. Married at 34, she had been trying
to conceive for two years to no avail. Her local doctor had been convinced,
and convincing, that she would get her baby through the low-tech intrauter-
ine insemination (IUI) procedures. “You have stingy ovaries,” he would say
with a wink. “We’ll just push you a little harder and hope you don’t end up
with more than one.”
After three failed attempts and increasingly higher doses of medication, that
dialogue began to wear thin. Her faith in him and in herself had waned, and
she was off to find a new doctor and a more direct line to baby. Now, here she
stood contemplating in vitro fertilization (IVF), a $15,000-plus, two-month
procedure for what she thought would have been accomplished in one night
after a bottle of cheap wine. The mountain was indeed much higher than she
thought.
Failing to get pregnant month after month can be especially difficult if one of
you is still in the “No problem, we’ll just keep trying, it’ll happen eventually”
mode while the other partner is ready to move on — to a new doctor, medical
intervention, or a high tech procedure like IVF. If you’re a couple with one
laid-back partner and one gung ho partner, you probably know this already.
How to cope with mismatched ideas of how to proceed when what seemed
easy turns out to be really hard? Talk to each other! One of you may need to
lighten up a little and the other may need to “get off the pot” so to speak, so
you can proceed at a pace with which you’re both comfortable.
It’s not my fault — the blame game
Perhaps the most destructive force in any relationship is blame, whether it is
deserved or not. All of us can take responsibility for our actions, but for the
140
Part II: Stepping Up Your Efforts 

most part, our reproductive system is what it is, regardless of anything we
did or didn’t do. Remember, infertility is not punishment, it’s biology.
There’s almost a perfect balance between male factors and female factors as
causes for infertility; 40 percent of the time the problem is due to male issues,
40 percent of infertility is due to female issues, and 20 percent is unexplained —
or a combination of the two. With the scales so evenly balanced, there is no
rational reason to play the blame game but inevitably, many couples end up
in this no-win scenario.
The blame game is a diversion from the true problem of infertility. Consider
other diversions instead. Playing cards can be just as competitive without
the ill side effects on either one of your psyches. 
We should have started sooner — 
more of the same game
Ah! Another one of those useless diversions . . . we should have known we
would have had problems and started earlier! With such perfect 20/20 hind-
sight, none of us would need gainful employment. 
Waiting until age 50 to conceive might not be the brightest of ideas, unless of
course, you are completely willing to use donor eggs, sperm, or both. But,
other than an extreme case such as this, second guessing your decision to
(pick one) 1. wait for the right person with whom to build your life, 2. put off
having a baby to finish school, 3. become financially stable, or 4. improve a
tumultuous relationship before bringing a child into it, is futile. These are
probably all excellent reasons for putting the brakes on baby making.
Revisiting these choices when you encounter problems is similar to replaying
an accident over in your mind, trying to imagine what might have happened
had you taken another route. It’s over, move on and make the next right deci-
sion. Don’t waste your time and energy rethinking your motives. Resist the
temptation to reinvent history. It doesn’t work. 
You just don’t care! – When one partner
seems more committed to conception
You probably won’t be surprised to learn that people react to things differ-
ently. While one partner’s emotions may often rise and fall with each test
result, the other person’s feelings may not. 
141
Chapter 9: Are We Having Fun Yet? Trying to Conceive and Your Relationship

One common view of some partners is that the proof is in the baby, not in the
myriad details. He (often it’s a “he” who has this behavior pattern) may not
want to hear daily about your cervical mucus, your possible nausea, your
maybe-slightly-a-little-bit-sore breasts, or your latest discussion with your
mom about how long it took your cousin Susie to get pregnant. It’s not that
he doesn’t want a baby, it’s just that he doesn’t want to hear about it ad
infinitum. He’ll be thrilled when you actually have the baby, but the details in
getting the baby are more than he wants to hear.
If you’re a micromanager (and many women are, especially when it comes to
something as big as getting pregnant), this seeming nonchalance, if not out-
right indifference, to the process of baby getting may infuriate you. You may
goad your partner with “You just don’t care” accusations, which probably
aren’t true and will probably provoke retaliation in kind, which isn’t going to
help either of you.
Some men want to talk about something once and then let it go until some-
thing actually happens. Women, on the other hand, often want and need to
talk things out — not just once, but daily, hourly, or sometimes even every
few minutes. Many men seem better able to compartmentalize the things that
are going on in their lives than women do, being able to put aside baby con-
cerns when watching the Super Bowl, for example. You, on the other hand,
may find the Super Bowl a perfect time to talk about baby names, or to
wonder out loud if football players ever have infertility issues from wearing
those tight pants or from being crushed at the bottom of a five-man pileup.
Once you’ve been assured — or reassured — once or twice by your partner
that yes, he really wants a baby, and yes, he really does care about you and
your future offspring, more than life itself, but could he just watch the Super
Bowl now without thinking about how hard it must be for the player’s wives
to get pregnant when they’re on the road all the time? Who knows? The score
of the Super Bowl may actually have a greater impact on your life in the long
run than the fact that your temperature chart looks totally different this
month than it did last month. And even if it doesn’t, your partner’s extreme
desire to talk about the game rather than your temperature chart when the
game is in overtime is in no way a reflection of what kind of a dad he’ll be. 
If, on the other hand, you notice real foot dragging on your partner’s part
when it comes to matters of infertility, you may need to have a serious dis-
cussion. Maybe he’s got concerns he hasn’t brought up; maybe he really isn’t
as committed to having a baby as you are. If that’s the case, it’s time to put
on the brakes until you can talk things out and find out what each of you is
really thinking. Having a baby when one partner isn’t sure about the idea is
rarely a good idea.
142

Fun and Games for Two – Remembering
How to Enjoy Each Other Again
So sex isn’t fun anymore. Dreaming about your family to be causes your eyes
to mist up. So how do you bring the fun back into your relationship . . . and
your life?
And you’re not the only one. It may be hard to believe it, but it’s the partner
of the fertility patient who primarily faces the problem of loneliness resulting
from the pursuit of a baby. While one partner is trying to cope with the possi-
ble loss of fertility, the other partner is dealing with a loss of a different sort:
the loss of a partner immersed in the facts, figures, and minutiae that can
become all-encompassing when trying to conceive. For the fertility patient,
the struggle with fertility may bring a great deal of fear and pain, but it can
also deliver new friends (real and cyber), enough reading and research to fill
a lifetime, and a litany of emotions to sort through. A woman may find herself
so busy with these activities that she doesn’t even have time for a quiet night
with her partner in front of the television.
To help solve this problem, we recommend “fertility-free zones,” times and
places where the subject is off-limits. Although detaching from what appears
to be such a looming issue may be hard, the space created by these mini-
vacations allows you to recharge yourselves as a couple and remember what
brought you together in the first place.
Fighting with your fertility is a battle best won with kindness, toward yourself
and your partner. Here are our suggestions for marking time:
 Take the time to appreciate good health; it’s not a guarantee, whether
you conceive or not.
 If you don’t have a baby to love yet, direct that energy toward the chil-
dren and adults who are in your life today. Doing so involves no risks,
and the rewards will carry you through this difficult time.
 Are you angry? Makes sense to us. Perhaps you can channel that anger
into a letter to your congressman lobbying for better healthcare cover-
age for fertility patients.
 Do you feel it’s unfair that people you consider undeserving parents get
to have the children that you dream of? Step up to the plate and volun-
teer to be a Big Sister or Big Brother for a child who will truly benefit
from your good parenting skills.
143
Chapter 9: Are We Having Fun Yet? Trying to Conceive and Your Relationship

 Pamper yourself and your body. Get a massage, enjoy fine (and healthy)
dining, read a good book, go for a walk, or play with a puppy.
 Create a support network. While your old friends are like gold in getting
you through this, no one can truly comfort and sustain you quite like
another person experiencing the same thing. You’ll find plenty of other
women and men out there struggling with fertility.
To get pregnant is not a job, a cause, or a raison d’etre. It’s a means to an end
with the idea of creating a family as the goal. When your mind is too caught
up with too many details concerning the problem, you have lost sight of your
objective. Step back and let go. It’s a great way to get some perspective and
some space, for you and your partner.
Getting Some Professional Guidance
Everybody needs a shoulder to cry on from time to time. Those of you going
through fertility treatments may need more than one person’s shoulders.
Continued communication between you and your partner, devoid of blame
and misdirected anger is key to working through the infertility battle as a
team. But, sometimes, the hole feels a little too deep, and you may need fur-
ther professional intervention.
Don’t minimize the stress you’re under. By acknowledging how difficult this
may be for you, realizing that it may not be that difficult for your partner, and
recognizing all points in between, you can define your starting point, a neces-
sary step in determining your direction.
Although many of the more complex decisions in fertility treatment require
medical guidance, you may find yourself getting stuck in areas that seem far
simpler. Perhaps you’re overwhelmed, a natural response when the path in
front of you seems confusing. Talking about your options with your doctor is
certainly one way to get clarity. A therapist, however, can help prevent you
from getting bogged down with the small stuff and often help you to realize
what’s behind it all. Perhaps you’re feeling the weight of the world on your
shoulders in trying to conceive. Your partner’s admonishment to “take it easy”
may seem insensitive and unaware. It probably is.
Couples counseling is a great place to have your thoughts and feelings trans-
lated into a language that your partner might better understand. Do you find
yourself snapping at every mail carrier and store clerk in town? Therapy may
be a good place to unburden your frustrations before people scatter at the
sight of you. Are you resentful of your or your partner’s fertility problems?
144
Part II: Stepping Up Your Efforts 

Telling one another over dinner may exacerbate the problem, but the helpful
mediation of a therapist can allow you to acknowledge your feelings and your
partner’s and move on.
Many fertility specialists advise the couples they treat to consult a counselor
or psychologist, especially one that specializes in fertility. These counselors
are particularly adept at dealing with differences in the way men and women
deal with the stress of infertility. And because a counselor is not the physi-
cian treating you, he/she is often in a better position to offer objective advice
about types of treatments, adoption, and so on.
There’s an old saying that what doesn’t kill you makes you stronger. Therapy
is a good place to develop the mental muscle you need to succeed. 
Throughout our many years of struggling to conceive their first and then
second child, Jackie and her husband actually DID gain a deeper and more
loving understanding with one another. As their marriage continued, they
learned that life had even more ups and downs than trying to conceive. What
they learned through the process of creating a child, however, made them
better suited to face other challenges as well.

f you haven’t gotten pregnant after several months to a year, it may be
time to start doing some tests. Your doctor may suggest these tests to
you, or you may suggest them to him or her if you feel that time is slipping
away and you want to find out why you haven’t gotten pregnant yet, or why
you can’t stay pregnant.
In this chapter, we give you a rundown of the tests that fertility doctors do on
women most frequently, why they do them, and what you can expect to learn
from the tests. If you’re wondering why all the emphasis on you when there
are two of you involved in the baby making process, never fear — we address
male issues in Chapter 11.
For about 30 percent of couples trying to get pregnant, several problems con-
tribute to infertility. This fact is especially important to remember if one of
you has a known factor, such as previous tubal surgery or a known sperm
problem. Many couples come to a clinic and tell the staff, “I don’t need to do
any testing — we already know the problem is him (or her).” You may think
that you already know the problem, but keep in mind that for 30 percent of
you, tests will reveal another problem, and pregnancy won’t occur until both
problems are addressed.
Understanding Female 
Structural Problems
Men’s infertility issues seem simple at first because the problem all comes
down to sperm: Are they produced, can they get out, and how do they look
when they get there? Women’s infertility issues can be more complex

because so many different systems can be at fault. Is the problem uterine,
tubal, hormonal, age related, or ovarian? Any one of these problems can
cause enough trouble to prevent you from becoming and staying pregnant.
Looking in the uterus
Maybe you had an HSG to evaluate your fallopian tubes and uterus, which 
we discuss in the section “HSG (don’t even try to spell out the word),” later 
in this chapter, or maybe you had a hysteroscopic surgery for an even closer
look into the uterus. Looking at the uterus is an integral part of any fertility
workup because the uterus nourishes and holds a baby for nine months.
Finding fibroids in the uterus
Fibroids, or benign tumors, are commonly found inside or on the outside of
the uterus. They’re extremely common, with 40 percent of women between
the ages of 35 and 55 having at least one. Fibroids are even more common in
African-American women, with 50 percent having at least one.
Fibroids can cause bowel or bladder problems, very heavy bleeding, or pain.
Fibroids can be either inside or outside the uterine cavity; their location
determines whether they cause a problem with your ability to get or stay
pregnant. Fibroids completely outside the uterus, such as pedunculated
fibroids, which are attached to the uterus by a stem, don’t usually cause 
a problem with fertility.
Subserosal fibroids are located in the outer wall of the uterus and generally
don’t impinge on the cavity. Intramural fibroids, those within the wall of the
uterus, can push the uterus in if they grow large enough. Submucosal fibroids
grow through the lining of the inside wall and can make the cavity too small
for a baby to gestate for nine months. In fact, 40 percent of pregnancies will
miscarry if submucosal fibroids are present.
Fibroids can be surgically removed, a process called a myomectomy. A small
fibroid inside the uterus can usually be removed by hysteroscopy, a procedure
in which a thin telescope is inserted into the uterus through the vagina. This is
outpatient surgery and is relatively atraumatic. In contrast, large intramural
fibroids require an abdominal incision and a hospital stay. You generally need
to deliver by cesarean section after an abdominal myomectomy.
Removing polyps
Polyps are small fleshy benign growths found on the surface of the
endometrium. Very small polyps usually cause no problem with getting 
pregnant, but larger polyps or multiple polyps can interfere with conception.
150
Part III: Asking for Directions: Finding the Problem 

Polyps can cause irregular bleeding; they can be diagnosed via sonohystero-
gram or hysteroscopy and can be scraped off the endometrium. Polyp
removal is called polypectomy.
Checking out the fallopian tubes
Most women have two fallopian tubes, one on each side of the uterus, next to
the ovaries. Because these tubes are the transport path from the ovary to the
uterus, a problem with one or both tubes can have a big impact on your
baby-making ability.
Sometimes a tube is surgically removed after an ectopic pregnancy, a pregnancy
that starts to grow in the tube rather than in the uterus. If this pregnancy is
found early enough, it may be possible to dissolve the pregnancy with a
chemotherapy agent called methotrexate. However, if the fetus grows large
enough undetected in the tube, the tube can burst, causing life-threatening
bleeding (we discuss this in Chapter 6). The only way to stop the bleeding is 
to remove the tube.
You can get pregnant with only one tube, but you must be aware that having
one ectopic pregnancy leaves you at a higher risk to have another.
Investigating damaged tubes
Women who have only the left ovary and the right fallopian tube can get 
pregnant because the egg can “float” to the remaining tube. Of course, this
also applies to women who have the left tube and the right ovary. (One study
estimated that the egg gets picked up by the opposite tube about 30 percent
of the time.) Sometimes fallopian tubes are seen to be enlarged on ultrasound
or during an HSG. If the tubes are very swollen and dye doesn’t flow through
them, you may have a hydrosalpinx, the medical term for a chronically
infected tube (see Figure 10-1). If both tubes are dilated, the condition is
known as hydrosalpinges.
A hydrosalpinx interferes with pregnancy in two ways:
 The egg cannot be picked up by the dilated tube, whose fimbriae 
(the end) is blocked by scarring. 
 The embryo, if it makes it to the uterus by traveling down the other
tube, or perhaps even being placed there during IVF, may not be 
able to survive because the infected material from the tube drips
down into the uterus, making an inhospitable environment for the
embryo to grow.
151
Chapter 10: Finding the Problem: Testing 1, 2, 3

The treatment for a hydrosalpinx is surgical. In mild cases, the end of the
tube can be opened and the ends peeled back like a flower. However, in
severe cases, the tube will not work even if it is opened. In these cases, the
tube or tubes must be removed, and you need to have in vitro fertilization
(IVF) to get pregnant because your eggs can no longer float down to the
uterus. This diagnosis is a hard thing for many women to accept because it
definitely ends any chance that they’ll be able to get pregnant on their own.
In very rare cases, women can be born without any fallopian tubes; often the
tubes are missing as part of a syndrome in which the external sex organs look
normal, but the vagina, uterus, and fallopian tubes are missing. Of course, if
you’ve had two ectopic pregnancies, you may have had both tubes surgically
removed also.
Sometimes fallopian tubes look fine on an X-ray but may be surrounded by
adhesions (scarring) that prevent them from picking up the egg. (See “Seeing
the complications of scar tissue” for more about adhesions and infertility.)
Endometriosis, tissue growths found anywhere in the pelvis, can grow in or
around the fallopian tubes and is a common cause of adhesions around
tubes. Normal tubes cannot be visualized by ultrasound.
Because the fallopian tubes play such a large role in getting pregnant, you’ll
probably need intervention, such as IVF, to get pregnant if a problem is dis-
covered with them. Removal or absence of the tubes, or a blockage that can’t
be removed, makes IVF inevitable if you’re trying to get pregnant.

Seeing the complications of scar tissue
In her years as a labor and delivery nurse, Sharon saw firsthand how scar
tissue, or adhesions (as shown in Figure 10-2), can form in your reproductive
system. Many women having a second or third cesarean section delivery or
other surgery had scar tissue throughout the pelvis that needed to be cut
away before the delivery team could get to the uterus.
Adhesions form when blood and plasma from trauma such as surgery form
fibrin deposits, which are threadlike strands that can bind one organ to
another. They can be removed, but surgery to correct adhesions may result
in — you guessed it — more adhesions.
Adhesions in the pelvis are common after a surgery, such as an appendectomy,
tubal removal for an ectopic pregnancy, or fibroid removal. Between 60 and
90 percent of surgeries leave adhesions behind. Adhesions often cause pelvic
pain; 30 to 40 percent of women with chronic pelvis pain have adhesions, and

153
Chapter 10: Finding the Problem: Testing 1, 2, 3

one out of seven women has chronic pelvic pain. Cesarean sections also 
commonly cause adhesions, but they tend to be anterior (or in front of) the
uterus, and thus may cause difficulty during a subsequent C-section. However,
C-sections don’t usually cause problems with tubes (which tend to be behind
the uterus), and thus don’t usually cause infertility.
Your chances of getting pregnant after adhesion removal are highest in the
first six months after surgery, before extensive adhesions form again. Some
adhesions can’t be removed without damaging the tubes or ovaries, and you
may need in vitro fertilization to get pregnant.
If you have adhesions in the uterus itself, you may be diagnosed with
Asherman’s syndrome, also called uterine synechiae. With Asherman’s, the
adhesions crisscross the entire cavity and make it difficult, if not impossible,
for a pregnancy to implant. 
Asherman’s can follow a dilation and curettage (D&C), an abortion, or a uter-
ine infection. It can be diagnosed during an HSG but is best diagnosed with a
hysteroscopy, where the inside of the uterus can be visualized. Asherman’s 
is also suspected if you have scant or no menstrual flow or recurrent miscar-
riages following uterine trauma. If the mild to moderate adhesions are
removed surgically, you have a good chance, probably 75 percent or better,
of becoming pregnant and carrying to term. Severe adhesions may destroy
nearly all the normal uterine lining, and pregnancy may not be possible.
Common Tests to Diagnose 
Structural Problems
Unfortunately, a quick exam isn’t usually enough for your doctor to see that
you have problems inside your reproductive organs that can prevent preg-
nancy. Fortunately, it’s become much easier to diagnose tubal and uterine
problems with new diagnostic tools, which we discuss in the nest sections.
HSG (don’t even try to spell out the word)
An HSG, or hysterosalpingogram, is an X-ray that outlines the inside of your
uterus and fallopian tubes to make it easy to see where abnormalities may be
keeping you from getting pregnant. (See Figure 10-3.) Dye is injected through
your cervix to make the uterus and tubes easy to see on an X-ray.
154
Part III: Asking for Directions: Finding the Problem 

HSGs can be uncomfortable, causing mild to severe cramping, but they’re 
a valuable tool in diagnosing fertility problems you can’t see. Some of the
problems that can be diagnosed with an HSG are fibroids in the uterus, large
polyps in the uterus, an unusually shaped uterine cavity, a septum (a piece 
of tissue dividing your cavity), or adhesions (scar tissue) in the uterus. If you
know that you have fibroids, an HSG can show whether they’re intruding into
the inside of the uterus, where they may prevent implantation of an embryo.
The dye also outlines the fallopian tubes, so your doctor can see whether
your tubes are normally shaped and, most importantly, whether your tubes
are open, which your doctor can tell by noticing whether the dye passes
through the tubes and flows into the pelvis. The HSG is an important test
because it lets you know that if your tubes are blocked in any way, or if they’re
very swollen, an egg or embryo won’t be able to get through to the uterus. If
dye does pass through easily, your HSG report will say that the fallopian tubes
“filled and spilled,” meaning that the dye passed easily up from the uterus, all
the way up the tubes, and out the end of the tube into the pelvis.

155
Chapter 10: Finding the Problem: Testing 1, 2, 3

How uncomfortable is an HSG? That depends on your own pain tolerance and
whether your tubes are open. If the tubes are slightly blocked with debris,
your doctor may need to push the dye more forcefully to clear the block,
which may increase cramping. Most doctors tell you to take ibuprofen or 
a similar pain medication an hour or so before your test. Of course, it also
depends on the skill (and “gentleness” of the doctor). Ask your fertility
doctor if he or she is going to perform the injection or if they refer patients 
to the radiologist. If a radiologist is going to do the dye injection, ask who has
the most experience. This may be one time when you should ask for a woman
radiologist if one is available!
Schedule your test for the early part of your menstrual cycle, usually before
day 12 (before you ovulate), because both the dye and the pelvic X-rays can
be harmful if you’re pregnant.
Many doctors also do cervical cultures for gonorrhea and chlamydia before
doing an HSG because pushing dye through the uterus and fallopian tubes
can spread the infection and cause serious complications. Your doctor may
also prescribe antibiotics for you to take starting a few days before your HSG
because between 1 and 3 percent of women experience some type of infec-
tion after the procedure.
If you’re allergic to contrast dye or shellfish, you may not be able to have the
test done. Contrast dye and shellfish both contain iodine, and some doctors
believe an allergy to shellfish means you have a higher chance of having an
allergic reaction to the dye.
After the test, a small amount of bleeding is normal; you’ll also leak a small
amount of dye (which is clear, not colored) over the next day or so. You may
be crampy for a few hours after the procedure as well. Take someone with
you so that you don’t have to drive yourself home.
Hysteroscopy
Sometimes smaller polyps and fibroids are hard to see on an HSG. For a
close-up look at the inside of the uterus, your doctor may want to do a 
hysteroscopy.
A diagnostic hysteroscopy, often done in the doctor’s office, is a procedure in
which a small tube is guided through the cervix into the uterus. The uterus 
is distended, usually with carbon dioxide, so that your doctor can clearly see
the entire area, including any small polyps, adhesions, or fibroids. You may
be given local anesthesia, such as a cervical block, or mild sedation, such as
Valium, for the procedure.
156
Part III: Asking for Directions: Finding the Problem 

If the procedure detects polyps, scar tissue, or small fibroids in the uterus,
your doctor may do an operative hysteroscopy. In this procedure, the doctor
inserts small instruments through the scope to remove the abnormal tissue.
Your doctor may perform this procedure in his office, or in the hospital if
more extensive work needs to be done. You may have a nerve block, such as
an epidural, or general anesthesia for an operative hysteroscopy done in the
hospital.
Laparoscopy
A laparoscopy involves placing lighted telescopes and other instruments
through the abdomen, as shown in Figure 10-4. The incisions made are 
very small, about 1⁄2 inch or less, and the procedure usually involves one 
to three incisions. Endometriosis and scar tissue can be removed during 
a laparoscopy. Fallopian tubes that are infected and dilated also can be
removed this way.

Chapter 10: Finding the Problem: Testing 1, 2, 3

A laparoscopy is usually done as an outpatient procedure in a hospital or sur-
gical center. The most common problems after the surgery are pain (usually
minimal) from the incisions and pain in the right shoulder from the carbon
dioxide used to inflate the abdomen. The recovery period is usually short,
less than a week. (This is the same kind of surgery that is done for tubal 
ligations, and is often referred to as “Band-Aid surgery”.)
Post-coital tests
Post-coital testing, also known as the Huhner test, is done around the time of
ovulation. It is a diagnostic test done to evaluate the ability of your partner’s
sperm to survive in your cervical mucus. Timing of this test is very important
to correctly evaluate the results. Your doctor will want you to have sex
around the time of your LH surge (determined by blood levels or ovulation
predictor kits) and come into the office the next morning, anywhere from 4 to
12 hours later; different doctors have different opinions on the exact timing.
The doctor or a nurse takes a sample of mucus from your cervix for the test,
so don’t take a bath, douche, or use lubricants, such as KY Jelly, for sex. The
doctor puts the mucus on a slide and looks at it under a high-powered micro-
scope. You hope that the doctor sees six to ten sperm moving forward per
high-powered field. You don’t want to see a few inert sluggards or a bunch 
of sperm seemingly stuck together; stuck-together sperm may mean that 
antisperm antibodies are present. (See the section “Testing for immune 
disorders,” later in this chapter, for more information about antisperm 
antibodies.)
In addition to checking out “the boys,” your doctor also examines the mucus
itself, which should be clear in color, make a leaf-like fern pattern under the
microscope, and be very stretchy, a quality known as spinnbarkeit. Good 
ovulation-time mucus can be stretched about 4 inches, but nobody will 
blame you if you don’t want to check this out yourself! All these qualities are
required for sperm to swim rapidly through the vagina without being mired
down or destroyed.
Sometimes the mucus seen doesn’t live up to all these great qualities; here
are a few possible reasons why it may not:
 You may not be ovulating. If your predictor kit says that you’re having a
surge but your mucus is thick, your kit may be wrong. Your LH level
could be high in conjunction with a high FSH level; this is common in
premature ovarian failure or perimenopause.
158
Part III: Asking for Directions: Finding the Problem 

 You may have a cervical infection. With cervicitis, normal cells are
destroyed, and the squamous cells that grow in their place don’t make
good cervical mucus.
 If you’re taking Clomid (a fertility drug), it may be affecting your mucus.
(See the section “Passing the clomiphene citrate challenge test (CCCT),”
later in this chapter, for more on Clomid.)
 If you’ve had any procedures done on your cervix for abnormal Pap
smears, your mucus-producing cells may have been destroyed. Such
procedures include cone biopsy, in which a wedge-shaped piece of
cervix is cut out and sent to be tested for cancerous cells; loop electro-
surgical excision procedure (LEEP), in which a piece of cervix is
removed by using a fine wire; laser; and freezing.
Many fertility experts have recently given up the post-coital test. This is
because women with poor post-coital tests can still get pregnant, and the
treatment for most simple infertility involves the use of intra-uterine insemi-
nation (IUI), in which the sperm are injected directly into the uterus, thus 
by-passing the cervix entirely. 
Sonohysterogram
A sonohysterogram is very similar to a hysterosalpingogram, except that a
saline solution, rather than a dye, is injected, and ultrasound, rather than 
an X-ray, is used to show uterine abnormalities such as polyps or fibroids.
The test can be done in the doctor’s office and requires no medication in
most cases.
A sonohysterogram is very effective for evaluating your uterus but not as
effective as an HSG for looking at the fallopian tubes. It’s commonly used 
to verify findings discovered by the HSG, and as a follow-up to previous 
surgeries. It’s generally much less uncomfortable than an HSG.
Taking Your Blood
It’s never fun to have blood drawn, but there’s a wealth of information in
those little tubes. Blood tests are one of the most non-invasive ways to see
how you’re doing, reproductively speaking, by testing your hormone levels 
at different times of your menstrual cycle to see if you’re “measuring up” to
fertility standards.
159
Chapter 10: Finding the Problem: Testing 1, 2, 3

Baseline blood tests
“Let’s get some baseline bloods,” your doctor may say when you first start
looking for an answer to the “why am I not pregnant” question. This test is 
one of the simplest tests you can have done. You simply wait until your period
starts, go to the lab on day two or day three of your period, and have blood
drawn. Within a day or two, you usually receive the results, which give you
quite a bit of information about your fertility. Here’s what the tests reveal:
 Estradiol: Estradiol on day 2 or 3 of your period is normally greater than
10 but less than 80. An estradiol level that is very low, less than 10, may
indicate that your ovaries are suppressed and may not respond well to
stimulation to make a normal egg (however, it may be normal). An estra-
diol level that is over 80pg/ml on day three may indicate ovarian cysts.
It’s also a bad sign for pregnancy happening in that particular cycle.
 Progesterone: On day two or three of your period, your progesterone
levels should be low, less than 2. Progesterone levels go up in the second
half of your cycle, after you ovulate, and should be over 10 ng/mL after
you release an egg. Progesterone comes from the corpus luteum, the left-
over shell of the follicle after you ovulate, and is necessary to help the
embryo implant.
 Luteinizing hormone (LH): The LH level is usually about 5 on day two 
or three; women with polycystic ovaries (we discuss this in the section
“Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS),” later in this chapter) may have 
an LH level that is significantly higher than their follicle-stimulating 
hormone level on day two. LH levels rise later in the cycle, usually going
over 40 when you’re almost ready to ovulate.
 Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH): Your FSH level should be less than
10 or 11, depending on your lab, on day two or day three. A higher 
than normal FSH level may indicate that you have diminished ovarian
reserve, or may mean you’re going into perimenopause, the period a few
years before menopause; you may also not be making eggs every month.
We discuss FSH in more detail in the section “FSH and Inhibin B,” later in
this chapter.
Your partner’s hormone levels, especially LH, FSH, and testosterone, also
need to be normal for good sperm production. Most doctors don’t test the
levels unless your partner’s semen analysis is abnormal because a good
semen analysis means his hormone levels are normal. 
160
Part III: Asking for Directions: Finding the Problem 

FSH and Inhibin B
Follicle-stimulating hormone is necessary for the production of an egg each
month, but, like other things in life, sometimes too much of a good thing is a
problem. FSH rises above normal levels when production of estrogen by the
ovaries wanes, similar to what happens in many other parts of the human
body; this is a feedback loop reaction. FSH is cranked out in larger quantities,
trying to get the ovary to understand and put out estrogen, reflected as a
higher blood level of FSH. Because the estrogen stays low, no egg is matured.
Your doctor may say that you’re in perimenopause, which is the time from
two to ten years before menopause.
Many doctors feel that a single high FSH reading, meaning anything over
10 or 11mIU/ml — the exact number varies with your lab — means that you
have diminished ovarian reserve. If you’re under 40 years of age and the FSH
is over 20, you may be diagnosed with premature ovarian failure (POF). If you’re
over 40, your doctor may consider this rise in FSH as a normal reaction to
aging ovaries. In any case, FSH over 20 can indicate difficulty getting pregnant
with your own eggs.
You may wonder why normal ranges for FSH vary from lab to lab. The reason
is that many labs establish their own norms based on their specific patient
population. The instruments used in the lab can also cause variations from
one lab to another.
In certain cases of POF, some doctors try to bring down high FSH levels by
fooling the ovary into thinking that the estrogen level is rising. This is done
by giving a type of synthetic estrogen. The ovary reduces the amount of FSH
produced because it “sees” the estrogen rising, which may give your ovary 
a chance to start producing an egg, either on its own or with the help of 
medication. This has worked for some women, and may be worth trying,
especially if the patient is young (under 40). 
An Inhibin B blood test is done on day three of your period and may give an
idea of how your ovaries are functioning. A low level of Inhibin B may indi-
cate that your ovarian function is decreased. This test may be considered to
be complementary to the FSH test. It does not appear to be superior or have
any more predictive value, and for this reason, the day 3 FSH test remains the
“gold standard”.
161
Chapter 10: Finding the Problem: Testing 1, 2, 3

Passing the clomiphene citrate 
challenge test (CCCT)
The CCCT, or clomiphene citrate challenge test, is a measurement of estradiol
and FSH (see “Baseline blood tests” for a description of each) taken on day
two or three of your period and then measured again after you take a medica-
tion called clomiphene citrate for five days. This drug, marketed under the
brand names Clomid or Serophene, is a fertility medication that stimulates
egg production. You then recheck your estradiol and FSH levels. Your estra-
diol level should rise by the fifth day, but if your FSH level is elevated on
either day two or after five days, you’ll be told that you had a failed CCCT.
Your doctor may feel that a failed CCCT means that you have a decreased
ovarian reserve, which decreases your chance of getting pregnant.
Hyperprolactinemia, or high prolactin
Although less than 1 percent of women have high prolactin levels, high 
prolactin (the hormone responsible for maintaining breast milk production)
levels are found in 10 to 40 percent of premenopausal women who have
stopped menstruating due to anovulation.
Women who are pregnant or breast-feeding should have high levels of pro-
lactin. If yours is elevated at any other time, it may suppress ovulation. A
tumor is found on the pituitary gland in about 30 percent of women with high
prolactin levels; these are almost always benign. Many drugs can cause high
prolactin levels, including antidepressants and antihypertensives.
A pill called Parlodel can be given to lower your prolactin levels so that you’ll
start ovulating again.
Thyroid tests
The best state to be in with your thyroid is euthyroid, which means that your
thyroid is in balance. Thyroid problems are very common, with one out of
eight women diagnosed with a thyroid problem at some point in their lives;
men can also have thyroid disorders, but women are five to eight times more
likely to be affected. Your thyroid can be either overactive (hyper) or under-
active (hypo). Both hyper- and hypothyroid conditions can cause infertility
problems in men and women.
162
Part III: Asking for Directions: Finding the Problem 

A thyroid that is hypoactive usually causes fatigue, dry skin, and weight gain.
A hyperactive thyroid causes a rapid heart rate, anxiousness, sweating, and
weight loss.
In men, thyroid problems can cause a low sperm count and decreased 
sperm motility. Women may experience an increased rate of miscarriage, lack
of ovulation, or irregular periods. Hypothyroidism can cause an increase in
prolactin, the hormone responsible for maintaining breast milk production in
pregnancy. High prolactin can cause a decrease in fertility.
Thyroid imbalances can be treated by daily medication, radiation, or, in
severe cases, surgery. Your thyroid medication may need to be adjusted if
you become pregnant.
Testing for immune disorders
Immune testing in infertility is considered controversial. This is because 
rigorous studies have not definitively proven a role in infertility. However,
some doctors feel that it can be valuable.
In most cases, only a blood sample is required. Interpretation of the results
isn’t always simple, however, and different doctors have different opinions 
of the importance of immune testing in infertility. Some tests are widely done
and the results almost universally accepted. Other tests are done only by
doctors specializing in immune disorders, and not all doctors believe the
results are important. Here are some of the most common immune tests, 
with information on what the tests mean and how you’re treated if the tests
are abnormal.
Antisperm antibody (ASA)
Many fertility centers do antisperm antibody (ASA) tests on all their patients.
Both you and your partner may be positive for ASA. Women are tested
through a blood test, and men are tested through a semen specimen.
Antisperm antibodies in either partner are thought to cause problems with
fertilization. Males with ASA may need to do IVF with ICSI (intracytoplasmic
sperm injection, or the injection of one sperm into an egg) if they have more
than 20 percent antibodies because the antibodies cause the sperm to clump
together instead of moving forward. (We discuss ICSI in more detail in
Chapter 11.) About 70 percent of men who have had a vasectomy reversal
have antisperm antibodies; they’re also common in men who have had injury
or insult to the testicle. Ten percent or so of infertile men have ASA. Some IVF
programs routinely perform ICSI if the man has a history of vasectomy rever-
sal or high levels of ASA.
163
Chapter 10: Finding the Problem: Testing 1, 2, 3

Antisperm antibodies are less common in women; less than 5 percent of infer-
tile women have antisperm antibodies. They’re found in the cervical mucus as
well as the blood. The antibodies attach to the head of the sperm and make it
hard for the sperm to penetrate an egg. The treatment is IVF with ICSI.
Antiphospholipid antibodies (APA)
You’ll most likely be tested for antiphospholipid antibodies (APA) if you’ve
had multiple miscarriages or repeated failure with IVF. The test for APA actu-
ally tests for a number of different antibodies; a moderate or high reaction to
two or more antibodies is considered a positive reaction. Treatment is either
baby aspirin, heparin (an anticoagulant, or blood thinner), or a combination
of the two. Antiphospholipid antibodies can interfere with the embryo
implanting or can cause miscarriage; they disrupt the normal clotting of
blood and the adhesion of the embryo to the uterus.
Antinuclear antibodies (ANA)
A high positive antinuclear antibodies (ANA) test can mean that you may
have a disease called systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). At lower positive
levels, especially if the pattern is speckled, ANA can increase your risk of mis-
carriage. A positive ANA level may be treated with low-dose steroids, but this
therapy is not proven to decrease miscarriage rates.
Antithyroglobulin (ATA)
Antithyroglobulin antibodies (ATA) can cause problems with your thyroid
function. Because the thyroid is so important in maintaining your hormone
levels, antibodies that interfere with the thyroid’s functioning have been
hypothesized to cause problems with egg production. As with other antibod-
ies, a high ATA level may be treated with steroids.
Antiovarian antibodies (AOA)
If you’re in premature ovarian failure or early menopause, you may be tested
for antiovarian antibodies (AOA).
Leukocyte antibody detection (LAD)
Foreign bodies are usually rejected because they’re attacked by antibodies; this
would be true of a fetus if it didn’t have the protection of blocking antibodies,
which you make in response to the genetic material from your partner that
is present in the embryo. Therefore, it has been suggested that if you and
your partner have DNA that is too similar, those antibodies won’t be 
activated, and the fetus is more likely to be rejected. A positive leukocyte
antibody detection (LAD) test is good; it means the antibodies are present. 
164
Part III: Asking for Directions: Finding the Problem 

If the test is negative, patients were advised to undergo leukocyte immuniza-
tion (LI) therapy, which injects white blood cells from the male partner into
you by using a small intradermal needle, similar to a tuberculin test. At pre-
sent, LI therapy has been stopped by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
Natural killer (NK) cells
NK cells are part of white blood cells that attack and destroy anything they
see as a foreign substance in the body. They’re an important part of keeping
cancer cells from spreading. A normal NK cell range is about 2 percent; if the
count is higher, the cells are thought to be too aggressive, and it has been
suggested that they may attack a growing embryo. Treatment for high NK
cells is intravenous immunoglobulin therapy (IVIG), which is also used in
cancer therapy. IVIG is quite expensive (over $1,000 per treatment), quite
controversial among infertility specialists, and often not covered by insur-
ance. (We talk more about IVIG therapy in Chapter 20.)
Enbrel, a drug created for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, has also been
used to treat NK cells. Its value in the treatment of recurrent miscarriage is
also unproven.
Considering the Possibility 
of Endometriosis
More than 5 million American women have endometriosis, a common, 
complicated condition that affects 30 to 40 percent of all infertility patients.
Despite its prevalence, it’s often underdiagnosed and undertreated. (See
Endometriosis for Dummies [Wiley, 2006] for the full scoop on endometriosis,
and see Chapter 6 for more on getting pregnant with endometriosis.)
Endometriosis is the presence of endometrial tissue, which lines the inside of
your uterus, in places it has no business being. Endometriosis can be found
throughout the pelvis — around the fallopian tubes and ovaries — but it 
has also been found in the lungs, skin, and brain. No one is quite sure how
endometriosis travels so far, but theories are that it travels through the 
circulatory system or the lymphatic system.
Because endometriosis is endometrial tissue, it reacts to hormone changes
the same way your uterine lining does. So when you get your period or have
midcycle spotting, endometriosis tissue also bleeds. Because this tissue
doesn’t have a handy exit point the way your uterine lining does, the blood
stagnates, causing inflammation, irritation, and eventually scar tissue.
165
Chapter 10: Finding the Problem: Testing 1, 2, 3

You might suspect that you have endometriosis if you have any of the 
following symptoms:
 Chronic or recurring pelvic pain
 History of ectopic pregnancy or miscarriage
 Backache or leg pain
 Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or constipation
 Rectal bleeding or bloody stools
 Blood in urine
 Urinary urgency or frequency
 Chest pain or coughing up blood, especially at the time of your period
 High blood pressure
Because the symptoms are so broad and sometimes nonspecific, endometrio-
sis may be confused with the following:
 Appendicitis
 Irritable bowel syndrome
 Bowel obstruction
 Ovarian cysts
 Pelvic inflammatory disease
Endometriosis can be diagnosed by laparoscopic surgery or a laparotomy;
endometrial lesions can often be removed at the same time.
Ovulation Issues
You can have all the right reproductive parts in all the right places, but if
they’re not functioning properly, pregnancy will never occur. Getting preg-
nant is dependent on the release of a healthy egg capable of being fertilized
by a healthy sperm. If your menstrual cycle is messed up, your egg produc-
tion and release may be, too. (We take a closer look at menstrual disorders 
in Chapter 2.) Your menstrual cycle is one of the first things your doctor will
probably ask you about when trying to get to the bottom of fertility issues.
166
Part III: Asking for Directions: Finding the Problem 

Amenorrhea — not getting 
your period at all
Amenorrhea is the absence of menstrual periods. If you’ve never had a
period, undoubtedly you’ve been evaluated sometime during your teenage
years to see whether a structural problem, such as absence of the uterus,
malformation of the vagina, or undeveloped ovaries, is the cause. 
However, many women have periods at one time and then quit having them.
This may happen if you have Asherman’s syndrome (discussed earlier in this
chapter in the section “Seeing the complications of scar tissue”) because
little normal tissue is left and the exit path from the uterus may be blocked
with scar tissue, or maybe you aren’t ovulating any longer. If you’ve had peri-
ods previously and no longer do, have a checkup to see whether anovulation
(failing to ovulate) is the problem.
Failing to ovulate
If you’re not getting your period at all, or if you’re having irregular periods,
you may not be ovulating, a condition known as anovulation. Many factors,
including emotional factors and stress, can cause anovulation.
Looking at your weight . . . or lack thereof
One cause of anovulation is weight gain or loss. Of course, most women 
don’t want to look at their weight. But even a slight deviation — about 
15 percent — either up or down may create menstrual irregularities and
subtle infertility issues. After your weight falls into normal limits, your
chance of getting pregnant without any other therapy may increase.
In today’s culture, where thin is in and “you can’t be too thin” is a widely
accepted standard, overweight women are far more likely to consider their
weight a problem than the underweight. The fact is, however, that being
underweight is equally as damaging as being overweight if you’re having 
fertility problems.
Frequent, strenuous exercise can also cause anovulation if it causes the body
fat percentage to drop to less than 22 percent, the amount needed to keep
menstruation occurring.
167
Chapter 10: Finding the Problem: Testing 1, 2, 3

Factoring in stress
You may wonder about the role stress plays in anovulation. Stress can alter
your body functions, which can affect your menstrual cycle. Lowering stress
levels is easier said than done, but if you’re under severe stress, you may
want to consider therapies such as biofeedback to decrease negative
response to stress.
Reducing stress and maintaining normal weight may help correct some cases
of anovulation, but not all.
Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)
Between 3 and 5 percent of women have a condition called polycystic ovary
syndrome (PCOS). Many of these women have difficulty getting pregnant
because many women with PCOS ovulate irregularly or not at all.
Often your doctor will test for PCOS if you’re overweight (50 percent of all
PCOS patients are obese) and are hairy where you shouldn’t be, a condition
that may be caused by an overabundance of male hormones called androgens.
If your doctor suspects that you have PCOS, he may do a pelvic ultrasound.
Women with PCOS have lots of small follicles on their ovaries that are visible
on ultrasound. Your doctor will probably check your hormone levels as 
well; PCOS patients often have a baseline blood LH level that is higher than
normal. The high LH levels can cause abnormalities in eggs and also increase
miscarriage rates. Insulin levels are often high as well, but these can be
treated by taking oral diabetic medications such as Glucophage. PCOS
patients have a higher chance of developing adult onset diabetes.
Many women with PCOS respond well and begin ovulating if treated with
Clomid or with injectable gonadotropins to induce ovulation. In resistant
cases of anovulation, your doctor may suggest laparoscopic laser ovarian
drilling, a procedure in which your doctor makes small punctures in your
ovary during laparoscopic surgery. Between 70 and 90 percent of women
start ovulating after this procedure, although the effect may be temporary.
Risks of the surgery are infection and scar tissue formation. (See Chapter 6
for more about PCOS and its effect on fertility.)

In This Chapter
 Men are different — let us count the ways!
 Sorting through sperm
 Finding the best sperm
 Making lifestyle changes to increase sperm counts
 Repairing a varicocele
 Undoing a vasectomy
You always knew men were different — but you might not have known
how different! When it comes to reproduction, everything about men is
different is — from the way they let it “all hang out” to the way they produce
gametes (both eggs and sperm are called gametes.)
In this chapter, we hang out with the boys, examining their reproductive
organs, their sperm-producing mechanisms, and the ways things can go 
awry in the sperm production department.
Analyzing a Semen Specimen
You may find your partner acting a little funny when it’s time to “check out
the boys,” but because male-factor infertility accounts for about 40 percent 
of infertility, semen analysis is a necessary step.
Undergoing semen analysis
Semen analysis can be done at your doctor’s office, if he has the proper tools, 
or in a laboratory. There’s no special preparation for a semen analysis, although
your partner should have abstinence (no ejaculation) for two to five days.

Usually semen samples are produced on site; some clinics or offices may pro-
vide “visual aids” to ejaculation such as magazines or movies. Can you “help”
with production? Only if you promise to use no lubricants or saliva, which
can mess up the sample!
If it’s absolutely impossible for your partner to produce on site, you can bring
in a sample produced within the last 15 minutes to half an hour in a sterile
container.
Most any laboratory can do a “screening” semen analysis. However, the
determination of morphology (proportion of “normal” forms), especially by
the criteria of Kruger (see the section “Evaluating sperm”), takes a high level
of expertise, and is generally only available at a bona fide fertility program.
If you’re bringing in a semen sample, keep it at next-to-body temperature —
holding it under your armpit is ideal. Make sure that the lid’s on tight!
Evaluating sperm
Sperm are extremely small, but under the microscope, you can see how com-
plicated they really are. A normal sperm (see Figure 11-1) has three sections:
a head, a midpiece, and a tail. All three parts need to be normal for a sperm
to be considered normal according to the strict Kruger morphology, a system
for evaluating sperm that was developed in Africa by Dr. Thinus Kruger.
 Head: Contains all the genetic material, so a sperm with an abnormal
head — either a round head, pinhead, large head, or double head — 
isn’t capable of fertilizing an egg.
 Midpiece: Contains fructose, the energy the sperm needs to move
rapidly.
 Tail: Needed for propulsion. Sperm with no tail, two tails, or coiled tails
are all considered abnormal.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has set standard parameters for 
a normal semen specimen, so this is what your sperm should have to be
graded A+. Your doctor probably won’t go into these fine points of your
sperm with you, but you can always ask about morphology or forward 
progression if you want to dazzle him with your knowledge!
 Volume: Should be 1.5 to 5 ml, or approximately a teaspoon. 
 Concentration: Should be greater than 20 million sperm/ml, or a total 
of greater than 40 million per ejaculate.
 Motility: More than 40 percent of the sperm should be motile, or moving.
170
Part III: Asking for Directions: Finding the Problem 

 Morphology: More than a certain percentage of the sperm should be
normally shaped, as determined by the lab technician. If the lab is using
the WHO criteria, the normal cutoff is 30 percent. If the lab is using
Kruger criteria, which are more strict, the normal cutoff is 14%, with a
value of 4 percent to 13 percent considered “borderline.” Less than 4
percent is considered poor prognosis.
 Forward progression: On a scale of 1 to 4, at least 2+ means a good
number of sperm moving forward.
 White blood cells: Should be no more than 0 to 5 per high-power field.
More could indicate infection.
 Hyperviscosity: Should gel promptly but liquefy within 30 minutes 
after ejaculation.
 Ph: Should be alkaline, to protect sperm from the acidic environment 
of the vagina.
There are some other tests that the doctor may order, although these are not
normally performed during the initial evaluation:
 HOS, or hypo-osmotic swelling, test: Greater than 50 percent of the
sperm tails should swell when exposed to a hypo-osmotic solution; 
this swelling is a sign of normal functioning.
 Antisperm antibodies: A normal semen sample contains no antisperm
antibodies. Antibodies cause problems if they’re attached to the sperm
tail, because they interfere with movement, or to the head, where they
may make it difficult for the sperm to penetrate the egg.
 Zona-free hamster-egg penetrating test: Human sperm cannot penetrate
the egg of another species. This is because there are specific binding
sites on the zona pellucida, the outer layer or “shell” of the human egg.
However, a normal human sperm can penetrate a hamster egg after the
zona, or outside layer of the egg, is removed. The ability to penetrate
the hamster egg has predictive value for the sperm because sperm 
that can penetrate the hamster egg can generally also penetrate intact
human eggs. The Kruger morphology assessment is so good that many
fertility programs use it in place of the hamster test. 
 Acrosome reaction test: The head of the sperm is covered with two
layers of membranes, called the acrosome. It contains enzymes that
allow the sperm to penetrate the egg. In order for the enzymes to be
released, the sperm needs to undergo an “acrosome reaction.”. The 
proportion of sperm that have undergone the acrosome reaction can 
be assessed in the laboratory and this result is thought to be predictive
of fertility in the male. 
171
Chapter 11: All About the Boys

It takes three months for sperm to properly develop, so if your partner was
sick, taking medication, or had anything else unusual going on three months
ago, his specimen may be abnormal. Check a second specimen in a few weeks
to see whether anything has changed.
Interpreting Your Partner’s Test Results
With some of the test results back, you may be even more confused than you
were before. If your partner’s semen analysis comes back with some results
askew, he may be too embarrassed to ask what the results mean. Sometimes
it’s easier to look up the problems in a book, so here you are!
Semen samples can vary from month to month, or even day to day. That’s
because it takes about 72 days for sperm to develop. Unlike eggs, which are
present from your embryonic days, sperm are replenished all the time. 
Sperm are produced in the testicle, then collect in an area called the epididymis,
and from there they must be transported via the vas deferens to the ejaculatory
duct. The prostate adds the seminal plasma, the thick liquid which then carries
the sperm via ejaculation into the outer world. There are lots of things that have
to happen to make sperm come out, and therefore, there are lots of factors that
can cause variability from ejaculate to ejaculate.

Part III: Asking for Directions: Finding the Problem 

Because men are constantly producing new sperm, one “bad” semen analysis
should be followed up with another in a month or so to see if the problem
was a temporary one. An illness, injury, or medication or drug use a few
months before may make one sample not so superior, but checking again 
a month later may show an improvement.
Making too few sperm
Sometimes a semen analysis shows a very low number of sperm, less than
20 million, a condition called oligospermia.
While 20 million sperm may sound excessive — why isn’t one or two million
enough? — large numbers of sperm are needed in the ejaculate because
many sperm are abnormal even in a good sperm sample, and it’s a long 
way to the ovulated egg, so many don’t make it all the way.
There are many causes of oligospermia, ranging from varicoceles (see
“Correcting Varicoceles”) to lifestyle issues (check out “Lifestyle Changes 
to Improve Sperm Production”). Other causes might be:
 Hormone imbalances, which can be checked by a simple blood test
 Chromosomal abnormalities such as a congenital deletion of part of 
the Y chromosome
 History of lymphoma or testicular cancer or chemotherapy (see 
chapter 6 for more about fertility and cancer treatment)
 Diabetes
 Sickle cell disease
 Kidney disease
 Liver disease
You can get pregnant without fertility treatments if your partner has oligosper-
mia, but your chances of pregnancy are higher if you do one of the following:
 Intrauterine insemination (IUI): The sperm will be concentrated
and “washed” so that the best sperm are used for insemination. (See
Chapter 13 for more on IUI.) 
 In vitro fertilization (IVF): This treatment allows fertilization to take
place in the lab, where a high concentration of sperm can be put in with
the egg. If the sperm are especially abnormal, the lab may need to utilize
intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), the insertion of a sperm directly
into an egg. The procedure is done by an embryologist under a high-
powered microscope. (See Chapter 17 for more information on ICSI.)
173
Chapter 11: All About the Boys

When there’s no sperm in sight
If no sperm are seen, it’s called azoospermia. Between 5 and 10 percent of the
male population have either azoospermia or oligospermia.
If your partner has azoospermia, you won’t be able to get pregnant conven-
tionally. Different factors can cause azoospermia; either the production of 
the sperm or the delivery of the sperm can be at fault. Sperm production
problems can be caused by the following:
 Sertoli cell only syndrome: In this condition, the germ cells that 
produce sperm in the testes are absent. There is no way for a person
with this syndrome to father a child.
 Anabolic steroids: Their use may cause a possibly reversible shutdown
of the sperm production.
 Abnormal hormone levels: Low levels of LH, FSH, or testosterone can
cause low sperm production. This problem can be treated with hormone
injections, pills, or transdermal patches.
If the problem is obstruction, in general, the sperm production is normal, 
and the sperm simply can’t get to the ejaculatory duct. In these cases, your
partner will need a surgical procedure to extract the sperm from the testicle
(discussed in the sidebar “If you need a sperm aspiration,” later in this 
chapter). This procedure must be done in conjunction with IVF because 
the sperm need to be injected directly into the egg. Obstructive problems
include the following:
 Absence of the vas deferens, the tube that delivers sperm to the ejaculatory
duct and the prostate
 Previous vasectomy
 Previous infection that causes scarring and obstruction of the epididymis
 Obstruction from prior surgery
Mechanical problems with getting the sperm where they need to be include
the following:
 Retrograde ejaculation, in which the majority of the sperm go into 
the bladder
 Spinal cord injury that prevents ejaculation
 Previous injury from trauma
 Previous injury from surgery, such as hernia surgery
 A disease such as diabetes
174
Part III: Asking for Directions: Finding the Problem 

Congenital absence of the vas deferens, the duct that leads to the urethra, 
is associated with cystic fibrosis in men. Genetic testing will most likely be
suggested if this problem is found. One way to diagnose absence of the vas
deferens is to test for a sugar called fructose that’s usually found in semen; 
it won’t be found if the duct is missing.
Swimming in circles, or not at all
Sometimes plenty of sperm are seen in the ejaculate, but the sperm themselves
are abnormal. Sperm are very complicated little creatures. Despite their small
size, they contain three distinct sections, and a problem with any section can
cause infertility.
The head of the sperm contains the DNA, or genetic material. If the head is
abnormally shaped, the sperm is probably incapable of fertilizing an egg
because its genetic material is abnormal.
175
Chapter 11: All About the Boys
If you need a sperm aspiration
Sperm can be aspirated from either the epi-
didymis, which sits on top of the testes, or from
the testes themselves. There are four different
types of procedures, each with advantages and
disadvantages:
 MESA (microsurgical epididymal sperm
aspiration): This procedure can be done
only for obstructive azoospermia, because
men with nonobstructive azoospermia
rarely have sperm in the epididymis. A small
incision is made in the scrotum, and then a
dilated tubule in the epididymis is cut open
and examined through a lighted micro-
scope. Fluid is collected from the tubule and
examined for sperm. This procedure can be
done in the doctor’s office. You may be
given a spermatic cord block and sedation
during the procedure. You can generally
return to work the following day.
 PESA (percutaneous epididymal sperm aspi-
ration):This procedure is done in the office. A
blind needle stick into the epididymis is used
to extract sperm. Local anesthesia and seda-
tion may be given.
 TESE (testicular sperm extraction): A small
incision is made, and a piece of testicular
tissue is removed. Testicular sperm doesn’t
freeze or thaw as well as epididymal sperm
but may be the only sperm found in men
with nonobstructive azoospermia.
 TESA (testicular sperm aspiration): This
procedure is done in the office, using a blind
needle aspiration of the testicle.
All four techniques can cause bleeding and
hematoma (a collection of blood that can be
painful). A biopsy usually requires only a one-day
recovery and can be done under local anesthesia
or mild sedation.

The midpiece of the sperm contains the energy necessary to propel it to the
egg. Sperm need a tremendous amount of energy to get to an egg. If they lack
this energy, they’re not going to make it the whole distance.
The tail of the sperm makes the sperm move rapidly; if the sperm sample has
a lot of coiled, rather than whip-like tails, or no tails at all, those sperm may
go in the wrong direction or may go nowhere at all — they may just twitch a
bit. Again, these sperm aren’t going to be able to get where they need to be.
Correcting Varicoceles
A varicocele is an abnormal dilation of the spermatic vein. Varicoceles are
more common than you may think; about 15 percent of men have them. More
varicoceles are found on the left testicle than the right — around 90 percent,
in fact. The effect of varicoceles on male fertility is somewhat controversial.
However, some doctors feel that they are the leading cause of male infertility.
Varicoceles can lead to decreased fertility in the following ways:
 Increased temperature in the testes
 Stagnation of blood around the testicles
 Hormonal alterations
 Decreased sperm production and motility
Varicoceles can be corrected in one of two ways:
 Surgery: Done as an outpatient; a small incision is made just above the
groin, and the offending vein is located and tied off. Recovery time is a
week to ten days, but heavy lifting should be avoided for a month or so.
Surgical risks include infection, nerve injury, and hydrocele formation 
(a collection of fluid around the testicle).
 Radiographic embolization: Also an outpatient procedure; advantages
are immediate recovery with no restrictions on lifting. A small catheter
is threaded through the femoral vein in the groin; dye is injected to show
exactly where the problem vein is, and then the vein is blocked, or
occluded, so that no blood flow can reach it.
In the past, varicocele repair was a very common procedure. Most recently,
varicocele repair has become controversial because studies designed to
demonstrate improvement in fertility after the surgery have not been able to
show the degree of improvement that was anticipated. Only very large and
obvious varicoceles tend to be repaired these days. It can take up to 4 months
for an improvement in sperm count to be seen after a varicocele repair.

Lifestyle Changes to Improve 
Sperm Production
Even if your partner’s sample doesn’t look optimal, take heart; there may be
things he can do to improve. Many lifestyle issues can impact sperm produc-
tion in a big way; consider the following and change what you can:
 Smoking: Cigarette smoking can decrease sperm count, increase 
the number of abnormal sperm in a semen sample, and some studies
suggest that smokers are more likely to be impotent (unable to sustain
an erection) than non smokers.
 Marijuana: Marijuana use in men can lower the amount of seminal fluid
produced, and can result in decreased sperm production.
 Alcohol: Alcohol, in large quantities, increases the number of abnormally
shaped sperm, can change male hormones, and leads to impotence.
 Anabolic steroids: Anabolic steroids suppress testosterone, resulting in
small testes, possible impotence, and severe decrease in sperm count,
or even a total absence of sperm.
 Bicycling: Cycling seems like a great way to burn calories and stay in
shape — and it is. However, studies have shown that cyclists are more
likely to have fertility issues related to the pressure of the bicycle seat
on the testicles.
 Chemical exposure: Working with chemicals such as pesticides, chemi-
cal compounds, or inhalants can result in a decreased sperm count
and/or an increased number of abnormal sperm in the ejaculate.
 Cocaine: Cocaine decreases sperm counts, results in abnormal-looking
sperm, and may be carried on the sperm into the fertilized egg; this may
lead to abnormal development in their children.
 Laptops: Who’d have thought it ten years ago: Your laptop can actually
decrease male fertility! This only happens if you hold it on your lap; the
heat produced by the laptop can overheat the testicles. Some laptops
have gotten hot enough to start on fire! So put something between you
and the laptop, or better yet — put the laptop on a desk or table.
 Medications: Many prescription drugs used to treat high blood pressure
and depression have negative effects on fertility; if you are dealing with
a low sperm count or impotence, be sure to discuss any prescription
medications you’re taking with your doctor.
 Weight: As with women, overweight men have decreased fertility,
according to some studies. If you’re overweight, reducing may help
increase your sperm count — and give you more energy to chase after
your future bundle of joy!
177
Chapter 11: All About the Boys

Analyzing the effects of age
For years, it’s been considered unfair that men, unlike women, had no age
limit placed on their fertility. While new dads in their seventies still make the
news from time to time, studies have shown that age may play a part in male
fertility as well as female fertility.
Some studies suggest that older men produce fewer mature sperm. Immature
sperm are slower moving and lack the strength to “go the distance” to the egg.
Decreased testosterone production in older men may lead to erection difficul-
ties and a weaker ejaculation.
A recent study showed a possible link between older men and the incidence
of autism in their offspring; similar studies have shown an increase in off-
spring with schizophrenia born to older dads. A Canadian study showed
abnormalities in DNA in sperm of men over age 45 — in fact, men over 45 
had double the number of abnormal sperm found in men aged 30.
Of course, you can’t change your age, so if you’re attempting pregnancy over
age 40, the best thing you can do is maintain a healthy lifestyle to make sure
you’re producing the best sperm possible.

Two syndromes that affect male fertility
Kleinfelter’s syndrome and Kallman’s syndrome
are two syndromes that affect male fertility.
Kleinfelter’s syndrome is far more common than
most people realize. One out of 500 to 1,000 males
are affected. Symptoms of Kleinfelter’s are
delayed puberty, decreased facial and body hair,
small firm testes, and long legs. Blood tests show
an increase in LH and FSH levels and a decrease
in serum testosterone levels. Chromosome tests
will show an XXY karyotype. Treatment is testos-
terone. Fertility was thought to be impossible, but
recently several live births have been reported
after testicular sperm extraction and IVF with ICSI.
Kallman’s syndrome is less common but may be
familial. Symptoms are loss of smell, delayed
puberty, osteoporosis, red-green color blind-
ness, and possibly cleft palate and urogenital
abnormalities. Blood tests show high LH and
FSH levels and low testosterone levels.
Treatment is with hormones such as HCG or
FSH and testosterone. Since Kallman’s syn-
drome affects the brain and pituitary gland, and
not the testicles, fertility is possible after hor-
mone replacement in these patients.

Considering Erectile Dysfunction 
Issues: A Sensitive Topic
Abnormal sperm may be a problem you both can deal with. Problems with
ejaculation or the ability to sustain an erection, however, may be so difficult
to address that you may have a hard time bringing it out into the open. Yet
it’s a common problem: Ten percent of men between the ages of 18 and 59
have experienced erectile problems in the last year, and 10 percent of men
between the ages of 40 and 70 have complete erectile failure.
Plenty of medical-related conditions can cause problems with erection 
and ejaculation. The following list gives examples of what can cause 
such problems:
 Medications
• Antidepressants
• Anti-ulcer medications
• Certain blood pressure medications
• Cholesterol-lowering medications
 Diseases
• Diabetes
• Heart attack (myocardial infarction)
• Hypertension or other vascular disease
• Hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism
• Leukemia
• Liver cirrhosis
• Renal failure
• Sickle cell anemia
 Surgeries
• Abdominal perineal resection
• Proctocolectomy
• Radical prostatectomy
• Transurethral resection of prostate 
• Radiation, trauma, heavy alcohol use, and neurological damage
from surgery, stroke, epilepsy, or multiple sclerosis can also cause
erectile dysfunction.

Chapter 11: All About the Boys

Erectile dysfunction may also result from psychosexual problems better
addressed by therapy. Whatever the reason, the first step in dealing with 
the problem is being able to discuss it, especially with an outsider such as 
a doctor or nurse.
Handling the emotional effect of 
male problems on both of you
A few decades ago, failure to produce a baby was always considered to be
the woman’s fault. In many cultures, a man could obtain a no-questions-asked
divorce from any woman who didn’t give him a child. With the advent of
microscopes high powered enough to look closely at sperm, it became obvi-
ous that male factors are as important for reproduction as female factors.
Intellectually it shouldn’t matter which one of you has a problem, but intellect
and emotion are two different matters. Women tend to approach medical prob-
lems with a “let’s just fix it” attitude, while many men approach medical issues
with a “let’s just bury our head in the sand” approach. For whatever reason,
more men than women have an ego issue when it comes to their reproductive
parts. Their sense of personal failure may be more pronounced than yours, and
they may also be less willing to face the problem and do what it takes to fix it.
If it turns out that he’s the problem, you may have to tread very gently
around the issue, especially if you’re the one more interested in having a
child. He may consider the whole subject closed if he’s the problem — no
sperm, no child, okay, end of discussion. Not all men feel so closely tied to
their semen analysis, but if your partner does, be prepared for some tense
moments.
Undoing a Vasectomy: 
Is It Worth the Pain?
About 500,000 vasectomies are performed each year. As with tubal ligation,
many men regret their decision and decide to have the surgery reversed.
Vasectomy reversal surgery is often successful in that sperm will be found in
the ejaculate in the majority of cases, but the number of sperm may be too
small to make pregnancy likely, or antibodies attached to the sperm may
make it nearly impossible for the sperm to swim properly or fertilize an egg.
180
Part III: Asking for Directions: Finding the Problem 

Antibodies are found in 50 percent of men after vasectomy reversal; men with
antibodies may need IVF for their partner to become pregnant.
As with tubal ligation, vasectomy reversal success depends on what type of
surgery was done. The reversal success rate is higher if:
 The surgery is done on a straight section of the vas deferens.
 The pieces to be joined together are of equal size.
 The reversal is done within ten years of the original surgery.
Your chance of pregnancy after sterilization reversal depends on several 
factors. Consider carefully whether reversal will be more cost effective 
and offer a better chance of success than IVF, in which tied tubes can be
bypassed or sperm can be removed directly from the testicles via sperm 
aspiration. Of course, personal preference plays a great role in this decision.
The principal appeal of vasectomy reversal is that pregnancy can occur natu-
rally. The main disadvantage is that it may not work, and if it doesn’t, IVF will
be needed anyway.
A recently reported study showed that there was less pain and less time lost
from work with sperm aspirations as opposed to vasectomy reversals.

Early Pregnancy Loss
In This Chapter
 Understanding the meaning of “a little bit” pregnant
 Dealing with a miscarriage or ectopic pregnancy
 Recovering after a loss
A
s upsetting as it is not to get pregnant, getting pregnant and having the
pregnancy end in loss is even more devastating. Why do so many preg-
nancies end early, and what does it mean for future pregnancies? And how
can you avoid personal feelings of failure when a loss occurs? In this chapter,
we discuss how and why pregnancies are lost in the first 12 weeks, and we
offer advice on how to pick yourself up and try again if this happens to you.
Being “a Little Bit” Pregnant — 
It’s Possible
Most of you have heard that there’s no such thing as “a little bit” pregnant.
This statement is true in one sense, but at times, you do feel that you’re
“almost” pregnant . . . and you may be right.
Understanding chemical pregnancies
Even after embryos successfully implant, a large percentage (depending on
the age of the mother) stop developing before they develop a heartbeat. Most
of these early miscarriages, up to 30 percent, take place before the time when
you would notice any signs of pregnancy. If this happens, you may have no
pregnancy symptoms at all, not even a missed period. Or you may have very
early pregnancy signs, such as breast tenderness, which suddenly disappear.
These signs may be followed by a slightly late, heavier-than-normal period,

which is actually the passing of a very early pregnancy. You may pass more
clots than normal (for you), or you may feel “crampier” than usual. You 
probably wouldn’t even realize that you had been pregnant unless you did 
a sensitive early pregnancy test, such as a blood test.
If you’re under treatment by a fertility doctor, you may be asked to do a
blood pregnancy test, called a beta-HCG (this stands for the beta sub unit of
the HCG molecule, the hormone of pregnancy produced by the implanting
placenta, or “beta” for short), about two weeks after ovulation or embryo
transfer. Your beta number may be positive (most labs have a sensitivity of 5,
meaning that anything over 5 is considered positive; some labs have a sensi-
tivity of 2, or even 1.5) but very low when first tested, and it may be negative
a few days later, at the second test. Your doctor may say that you had a 
chemical pregnancy if this happens.
Testing for possible fixes
At least 50 percent of the time, chemical pregnancies are caused by the
implantation of a chromosomally abnormal embryo, but other factors 
can also cause very early miscarriage. Your doctor may do tests, such as
checking your progesterone level, to see whether there are other reasons
why the embryo isn’t “sticking.” In a normal pregnancy, the corpus luteum, or
leftover “shell” of the ovulated egg, produces a hormone called progesterone.
Progesterone is necessary for the implantation and growth of the early
embryo. If your progesterone is lower than normal, the embryo may not be
able to grow properly.
A simple blood test can check your progesterone levels. Alternately, your
doctor can do a biopsy to see if the uterine lining (the endometrium) is
responding to the progesterone that is in your system. In a biopsy, your
doctor takes a tiny scraping of your uterine lining and sends it to a lab to 
see if the response to progesterone is adequate. If the tissue sample shows
less than a normal response to progesterone, your doctor can recommend
supplementing progesterone in the form of shots, pills, or vaginal supposito-
ries. The biopsy needs to be done just before the period. Since you may be
pregnant at this time, it is usually done after a negative pregnancy test; it
needs to be done within a day or so of the test because it will not be accurate
if your period has started.
So even though people may say that you can’t be a “little bit” pregnant, the
truth is that a pregnancy can start to implant and then stop before you even
miss a period. You may not realize this is happening to you without a very
early blood pregnancy test. If your doctor suspects that you’re having chemi-
cal pregnancies, he or she will order further testing to see whether an easy
fix, such as adding progesterone supplements, can solve the problem.

Part III: Asking for Directions: Finding the Problem 

Suffering a Miscarriage
A miscarriage is a pregnancy loss that occurs after you know you’re pregnant
but before the fetus is viable, or able to live on its own.
Miscarriages are very common: About one in four women has a miscarriage
during her reproductive years. But knowing that miscarriages are common
events and not likely to recur doesn’t make them any easier to deal with.
The vast majority of miscarriages occur in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy.
Based on this fact, many couples decide not to shout the news to friends 
and relatives before this time has passed.
Understanding different terms
Doctors call all miscarriages abortion; that term doesn’t have the same 
meaning as what you’re used to. There are different types of miscarriages,
and they’re tied to the type of symptoms you have:
 Threatened abortion: The first sign of possible miscarriage is usually
spotting. But because spotting is common in pregnancy (occurring in one
in five women), doctors don’t always take it as a dire sign. If spotting and
cramping stop quickly, the chances are excellent that the pregnancy will
carry to term. Most doctors restrict sex and heavy exercise if some spot-
ting has occurred. Your doctor may call cramping and spotting a threatened
abortion. Bleeding can be caused by implantation of the embryo or by
the sloughing off of the lining around the area where implantation has
occurred. An internal exam will show whether your cervix has started to
open. An ultrasound done around six weeks will show whether a fetus is
in the uterus and may show a heartbeat. A heartbeat should be seen by
vaginal ultrasound by seven weeks at the latest. 
 Inevitable abortion: If your cervix has started to open, or dilate, and
you’re bleeding, you’ll almost certainly miscarry. Your doctor may call
these symptoms an inevitable abortion. An ultrasound may show no fetal
heartbeat. Your doctor will want you to watch for signs of infection,
such as a temperature over 100 degrees or a foul-smelling discharge.
Hospitalization isn’t necessary in most cases of miscarriage. Save any
tissue that you pass so that your doctor can send it to a pathologist,
who will examine it and make sure there is nothing sinister about the
miscarriage. In general, tissue passed at home will not be viable enough
to allow an evaluation for chromosomal abnormalities. You’ll probably
continue bleeding for seven to ten days.
185
Chapter 12: When the Beginning Is the End: Early Pregnancy Loss

 Missed abortion: A missed abortion occurs when the pregnancy stops
progressing but there are no signs of miscarriage, such as bleeding or
cramping. Your pregnancy blood levels may be lower than expected, 
and the ultrasound shows no fetal heart activity. A missed abortion may
require a dilation and curettage, a minor surgery, to remove the tissue.
Knowing if you need a D&C
You need a D&C, or dilation and curettage, if you don’t pass all the pregnancy
tissue on your own. This procedure involves opening the cervix and scraping
the uterus with a blunt instrument called a curette, or with a plastic tube with
an opening connected to suction vacuum, to make sure that no tissue is left,
because leftover tissue can cause an infection. This surgery is done under
light sedation, usually as an outpatient procedure. Your doctor may tell you
not to take tub baths, use hot tubs, douche, or have sex for a week or two.
You may be asked to return for a follow-up visit to make sure that you’re 
healing normally. There won’t be any stitches to remove after a D&C.
Don’t be upset if your doctor calls your miscarriage a spontaneous abortion,
or SAB. This is the medical term for a miscarriage.
Finding the cause
More than 50 percent of miscarriages are due to chromosomal abnormalities.
In these cases, no amount of rest or anything else that you do — or don’t 
do — will prevent them. The good news is that the vast majority of these are
considered “random” and “non-recurrent,” which means that the next time
you get pregnant, there is no reason to think the same thing will happen.
In trying to understand chromosomal abnormalities, you can compare a grow-
ing fetus to a house being built. If a builder orders a lot of lumber but no roof-
ing materials, a house’s walls can be built, but only up to the point where the
roofing materials are needed. If the genes needed for the baby to develop are
processed wrong at the time of conception, the baby will develop to the point
where it needs those genes to keep growing. Without those genes, the fetus
can’t continue to develop. Its “walls” will be built, but without the “roof,” it
can’t continue to grow. Two types of chromosomal errors are listed below.
Blighted ovum
A blighted ovum is the most common outcome (other than a chemical preg-
nancy) of a conception that has a chromosomal error. Blighted ovum occurs
when the placenta and amniotic sac develop and put out pregnancy hormones
but the fetus itself doesn’t develop. So you may test pregnant, but there is no
186
Part III: Asking for Directions: Finding the Problem 

fetus. You and your doctor may discover this fact when you start spotting 
and the doctor tests for fetal activity and finds no fetus. Since most fertility
doctors perform routine ultrasound testing of all pregnancies, a blighted 
ovum (or “empty sac”) may also be picked up at the time of a routine evalua-
tion. The most frustrating part of a blighted ovum is that the HCG is produced
by the placenta, and therefore may be quite high, with associated pregnancy
symptoms — morning sickness, breast tenderness, tiredness — and yet there
is no baby.
Molar pregnancy
Another, somewhat rare type of chromosomal anomaly is called a molar preg-
nancy. Molar pregnancies, also called a hydatidiform mole, occur in one in a
thousand conceptions in the United States; Molar pregnancies result when 
the egg is abnormal; it has no chromosomal content to pass on, so there is 
no fetus, only a placenta. The placenta usually grows very quickly; you may
show signs of pregnancy very early and have unusually high beta levels. 
Molar pregnancies are treated with a D&C to evacuate the abnormal cells. In
some cases, the cells can transform into choriocarcinoma, a rare disease that
behaves like a cancer in that it can spread to other parts of the body. In these
cases, you may be given methotrexate, a chemotherapy drug, to stop the
abnormally fast cell division. After a molar pregnancy, you will be advised to
avoid another pregnancy for 6 to 12 months to be sure that no abnormal cells
remain in the body and that a choriocarcinoma does not develop.
Other common causes of miscarriage, such as abnormalities of the uterus,
lack of progesterone support after ovulation, or vaginal infection, can be 
evaluated before you try to get pregnant again.
You should know, though, that regular cigarette smoking can increase the
rate of miscarriage by 30 to 50 percent, so cutting down drastically or stop-
ping smoking is a good idea if you want a successful pregnancy.
Evaluating chromosomes
Even though most miscarriages are caused by chromosomal abnormalities,
don’t expect your doctor to always be able to prove this. Sharon remembers
this as one of the most frustrating things about having a miscarriage--the fact
that no one could give her a reason why. The tissue may be sent for analysis,
but the cells may not grow (the cells must be viable and divide in the lab in
order for the chromosomal testing to be done). Other times, the mother’s
own cells may overgrow the cells of the placenta, and the chromosomal
analysis simply confirms that the mother was normal (46 XX); this is called
maternal contamination.
187
Chapter 12: When the Beginning Is the End: Early Pregnancy Loss

Whereas the vast majority of chromosomally abnormal conceptions are
caused by random errors and are non-recurrent, there are some mistakes that
are caused by rearrangements in chromosomes that are passed on by the
parents. Even if you have the right number of chromosomes (46), two of
them, or parts of two of them, may have gotten “stuck” together. Now imag-
ine what happens when you try to make an egg (or a sperm), and put half of
your chromosomes into the gamete (remember you only get to contribute
half of your chromosomes, and your partner provides the other half). If two
of your chromosomes are “stuck” together, instead of contributing 23 chro-
mosomes, you may only be able to contribute 22, or 24. Any pregnancy that
occurs will always have the wrong number of chromosomes. 
Your doctor will recommend chromosomal testing, also called karyotyping, if
you have had two or more miscarriages, or if the chromosomal test on one of
them revealed a translocation. Chromosomal abnormalities fall into one of
several categories:
 The wrong number of chromosomes — either too many, or too few
 Translocations, or rearrangements, of chromosomes
 Data added to or subtracted from certain chromosomes
Playing the blame game
Are you feeling guilty about your miscarriage because you once sneaked a
cigarette, had a glass of champagne at a wedding, had sex, or went skydiving
during your pregnancy? Maybe you’ve been depressed or had an abortion
when you were 17. Whatever, now you blame yourself and your careless ways
for the miscarriage. Don’t. Although some of these actions may not have been
the best decisions, the truth is that almost certainly none of them caused this
miscarriage.
Factoring in age
As in most fertility issues, age is a definite factor in miscarriage rates.
Consider these numbers:
 If you’re under 35, the miscarriage rate is about 6 percent.
 If you’re pushing 40, the miscarriage rate increases to 14 percent.
 If you’re over 40, your chance of miscarriage is 23 percent.
 If you’re around 43, the rate goes up to nearly 50 percent.
 After age 45, 87 percent of all women are infertile, so pregnancy is rare,
making miscarriage rates more difficult to gather. Also, periods are more
irregular, so what appears to be a late period could be a miscarriage.
188
Part III: Asking for Directions: Finding the Problem 

These statistics reflect the increased number of chromosomally abnormal
eggs still left as you get older; your “best eggs” have already been ovulated.
We discuss age-related fertility issues more in Chapter 1.
Ectopic Pregnancy: When the Embryo 
Is Developing in the Wrong Place
An ectopic pregnancy is a different type of miscarriage. In an ectopic pregnancy,
the embryo may be developing normally, but it’s growing in the wrong place,
usually in the fallopian tube. Like a miscarriage, an ectopic pregnancy ends
your hopes for a baby this time, but it can cause other problems as well.
Ectopic pregnancies aren’t rare — 1 out of 100 pregnancies is ectopic — and
the percentage has been rising over the last 30 years. With an ectopic preg-
nancy, the fetus may be normal but attaches to tissue outside the uterus, 
usually in the fallopian tube, and begins to grow there. The fallopian tube 
is much smaller than the uterus, and the baby can’t grow beyond a certain
point, usually around seven weeks, before rupturing the tube, causing severe
complications. Ectopic pregnancy is the leading cause of maternal death in
the first trimester of pregnancy.
What to do if you suspect 
an ectopic pregnancy
Any time you have severe one-sided pain, severe shoulder pain, or a feeling of
lightheadedness and weakness a few weeks after missing a period, you must
go to the emergency room to make sure that you don’t have an ectopic preg-
nancy. A positive pregnancy test and an ultrasound showing no fetus in the
uterus can confirm an ectopic pregnancy. If you have no physical symptoms,
an ectopic pregnancy may be suspected if the BSU is lower than it should be;
rarely, the pregnancy test can also be negative. An ultrasound will show noth-
ing in the uterus — no sac, placenta, or fetus.
What your doctor will do
Treating an ectopic pregnancy involves either dissolving the developing 
pregnancy with a drug called methotrexate, the same drug used for molar 
pregnancies (see the section “Molar pregnancy,” earlier in this chapter), or
removing the pregnancy through surgery. Surgical removal of an ectopic preg-
nancy can also cause more infertility problems; the fallopian tube may need to
be removed, and adhesions or scar tissue may develop after the surgery. An
ectopic pregnancy can be a life-threatening event. If the fetus gets too big, the
fallopian tube will burst, and you could be in danger of bleeding to death.
189
Chapter 12: When the Beginning Is the End: Early Pregnancy Loss

Methotrexate causes the pregnancy to dissolve by stopping the rapid cell divi-
sion necessary for a fetus to grow. Four percent of women taking methotrexate
have diarrhea, mouth soreness, or stomach irritation because these cells are
also fast-growing and affected by the disturbance in cell division. Serious side
effects, such as liver toxicity or lung problems, are rare.
Stop taking folic acid while on methotrexate because it may interfere with the
action of the methotrexate.
Methotrexate successfully dissolves an ectopic pregnancy 90 percent of the
time, but it must be used before the fetus grows larger than 3.5 cm (a little
over an inch). After that, surgical removal is necessary.
If surgery is required, your doctor may try to save the fallopian tube if possi-
ble. If the fallopian tube has to be removed, you can still get pregnant. An egg
can even be released from the right ovary and find its way to the left tube if
the right tube is gone.
Can the pregnancy be moved somehow from the fallopian tube to the uterus?
Because the placenta and the tissues involved with growth are “dug in” to the
tube, removing the fetus from the tube and reattaching it to the uterus are
impossible at this time.
Understanding why ectopic pregnancies happen
Although anyone can have an ectopic pregnancy, ectopic pregnancies are
more likely in women who have any of the following risk factors:
 If you have a swollen, dilated fallopian tube, called a hydrosalpinx, you’re
six to ten times more likely to have an ectopic pregnancy. Hydrosalpinx is
frequently caused by pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), often associated
with a chlamydia infection. (See Chapter 2 for more on chlamydia.) Even
if you have IVF, in which the embryo is placed directly in the uterus, it
may migrate back up into the hydrosalpinx and implant there! This is 
one of the reasons a hydrosalpinx should be removed prior to IVF.
 If you smoke, you’re one and a half to four times more likely to have an
ectopic pregnancy.
 Have you had a previous tubal surgery? You have a 15 percent chance
for an ectopic pregnancy. If you’ve had a prior tubal sterilization
reversed, the risk is about 5 to 10 percent (it’s less than after surgery for
diseased tubes because, in most cases, tubal ligation is performed on
healthy tubes, and they should be healthy again after the reconnection.)
 Previous use of an IUD slightly increases the chance of an ectopic preg-
nancy. (If you currently have an IUD and you get pregnant anyway — 
not likely if you’re reading this book, by the way — the risk that the
pregnancy is in the tube is about 20 percent.)
190
Part III: Asking for Directions: Finding the Problem 

 Current use of progestin-only birth control pills also increases the
chance of an ectopic pregnancy.
 If you’ve had a previous ectopic pregnancy, your chance for another is
20 percent. Your chance of being infertile is about 30 percent.
 If you douche regularly, at least three times a week, you’re more likely to
have an ectopic pregnancy.
Other origins of ectopic pregnancies
Most infertility treatments are associated with a higher rate of ectopic preg-
nancies. In fact, just being a patient in an infertility doctor’s office increases
your risk of ectopic pregnancy! Twin, triplet, and other multiple pregnancies
are also associated with ectopic pregnancies; in some cases, one fetus may
implant in the uterus and another in a tube, a condition called a heterotopic
pregnancy.
Recurring Miscarriage: Why It Happens
Two percent of all couples suffer recurrent miscarriage, which is the loss of
three or more early pregnancies. After three losses, the chance of a fourth
loss increases to 45 to 50 percent. What causes this repeated heartbreak?
 Uterine problems, such as fibroids that intrude into the uterine cavity,
scar tissue in the uterine cavity (Asherman’s syndrome), or malforma-
tions of the uterine cavity shape, can result in a miscarriage. If your
mom took DES, a drug to prevent miscarriage, in the 1950s and 1960s,
you may have an unusually shaped uterine cavity. Between 15 and 20
percent of recurrent miscarriages are caused by uterine problems.
(We discuss this topic in depth in Chapter 7.)
 An incompetent cervix is responsible for 5 percent of all recurrent 
miscarriages. An incompetent cervix is a cervix too weak to stay closed
during pregnancy. The cervix dilates painlessly, resulting in the loss 
of the pregnancy; this usually occurs after 12 weeks, when the growing
fetus puts more weight on the cervix. An incompetent cervix can be diag-
nosed on ultrasound; the cervical length will measure less than 20 mm.
An incompetent cervix can be caused by DES exposure before you were
born, trauma to the cervix (such as a cone biopsy done to diagnose pos-
sible cervical cancer), or congenital deformities. Pregnancy loss can be
prevented in most cases by placing a stitch, called a cerclage, through
your cervix to keep it from opening too soon. This is usually done after
12 weeks.
191
Chapter 12: When the Beginning Is the End: Early Pregnancy Loss

 Chromosomal abnormalities in either you or your partner cause 5 per-
cent of recurrent miscarriages. Chromosomal karyotyping, performed as
a blood test, on you and your partner can be used to diagnose chromo-
somal abnormalities.
 Immune problems, including diseases such as lupus, may be a factor 
in a miscarriage. Antibodies called antiphospholipid antibodies, which
cause clotting problems, and many other possible immune deficiencies
are currently a hot topic in fertility workups. (See Chapter 7 for more
information about immune issues.)
Pregnancy loss is an issue of biology, not morality. Fertility problems are not
a punishment for anything; they’re the result of biology gone awry.
Suffering the insensitive remarks 
of family and friends
What’s worse after a miscarriage than friends who become pregnant? Or
friends who continue to be pregnant when you’re not? How about relatives
who try to jolly you out of depression with stories of how miscarriage was
probably a blessing and that you should be thankful for the children you have?
Or what about women who regale you with stories of their own miscarriages?
Everyone has her own way of dealing with people you can’t avoid. Some
women politely ask that it not be discussed. Other women not so politely 
ask the offender to please shut up. Yet other women agree and pretend that
they’re feeling better. Try to remember that people are feeling awkward and
don’t know what to say, but they’re trying to make you feel better because
they care about you. Spouses may be having an equally difficult time because
few men discuss miscarriage with their friends; if they do, they may find little
sympathy for an early loss. They may also feel out of the loop and unin-
formed about exactly what happened, and may not want to question you for
fear of upsetting you more. If you can bring yourself to talk about it, a little
conversation goes a long way toward making your partner feel more like a
partner and less like a hindrance during this difficult time.
Picking Yourself Up after a Loss
As if you haven’t heard it enough, your body needs to heal after a miscar-
riage. However, also remember that miscarriage is a common event, and is a
part of reproduction. Women have been having miscarriages for millennia. 
192
Part III: Asking for Directions: Finding the Problem 

Your doctor may recommend waiting up to three months before trying 
to conceive again. However, a recent study evaluated the risk of another mis-
carriage in women who conceived in the first month after a miscarriage — 
without a single intervening period — and found no increase in a second 
miscarriage as compared to women who waited longer. Therefore, there is no
reason to wait longer than one month before trying again. This is especially
important if you’re over 40. Remember, time is not your friend!
If you’re still bleeding after a miscarriage (or a D&C), your cervix may still be
open, and your body is telling you that it is not yet ready for conception. So
you probably want to avoid intercourse until the bleeding stops. After that,
you should be fine. If you bleed for longer than two weeks after a miscarriage
(or a D&C), call your doctor and get an ultrasound. There may be some tissue
left behind.
Time truly does heal, or at least dulls the pain. Each passing day will help to
make your next pregnancy a joyous experience completely its own, not a
shadow of the fear and doubt of your early pregnancy loss.
Even the most optimistic of you will experience those times when your hope
button is stuck on “off.” This phase is a temporary, albeit painful, condition.
Rebooting your emotions can go a long way toward resetting your physical
condition as well.
What to do while you’re waiting
Just like your body needs to repair itself, your spirit needs some help as well.
As you count the days until you can begin trying again, consider using this
time to help your future child in another way. Here’s your to-do list:
 If you have already been blessed with a child or children, take a
moment to appreciate them. A hug from your precious one can right
many of the world’s wrongs.
 Allow yourself the time to grieve. Trying to pretend that you’re back 
to normal when you’re not may make you feel temporarily better. In the
long run, however, covering up grief rather than expressing it and work-
ing through it will cause it to resurface again, possibly during your next
pregnancy, in the form of resentment or guilt. Take the time to heal.
 Do something wonderful for yourself. Whether it’s a special purchase,
a dinner out with your partner, or an ice cream sundae, indulge a whim.
 Do consider professional help if your sadness is debilitating or lasts
longer than three months. A counselor can help guide you through the
minefield of emotions that you’re facing.
193
Chapter 12: When the Beginning Is the End: Early Pregnancy Loss

You and your partner are allies, not enemies, no matter how differently you
process the stress and grief of your loss. Helping your partner deal with his
own emotions will help you come to terms with your own feelings as well.
This experience can make you a stronger team if you work together.
What not to do
Taking care of yourself during this time and allowing others to care for you
should be your first priority, if not your only one. Part of this task, which may
seem daunting enough, is to keep in touch with your own feelings and stay in
touch with those who care about you. To help accomplish this, here’s our list
of things to avoid:
 Don’t force yourself to do anything that you don’t feel up to. You may
need to decline an invitation to a friend’s baby shower, christening, or
family gathering, and that’s okay. This time is about getting better, emo-
tionally and physically. Don’t do anything to compromise your recovery.
 Don’t go into hiding. You’ll want to skip some events, but don’t com-
pletely isolate yourself. Your community of friends and family can help
you heal. Although pain is unavoidable, suffering, particularly alone, is
optional.
 Don’t redecorate the nursery or wander through baby stores. These
types of behaviors are similar to picking at a scab. The temptation to do
these things is great, and you can talk yourself into believing that these
actions will be cathartic. In actuality, they’ll most likely cause you more
pain and prolong your healing process.
An early pregnancy loss does have somewhat of a silver lining. It confirms
that you can conceive, which can often be more than half the battle.

S
tarting an IUI (intrauterine insemination) cycle or a stimulated medication
cycle is a big step up from just trying to figure out when you’re ovulating
and planning to have sex accordingly. IUI cycles involve monitoring blood and
ultrasound results, and often involve injecting potent hormone stimulators
called gonadotropins.
In this chapter, we explain how IUI and stimulated cycles work and discuss
some of the testing involved and the medications you may be taking. We also
help you find those expensive gonadotropins as cheaply as possible, and we
give you tips on how to inject them as safely as possible.
Deciding How Much Treatment You Need
There are several roads to travel when seeing a fertility doctor, and on 
which one Dr. Specialist (see Chapter 7 for more on how to find the right Dr.
Specialist) places you depends on the reason for your infertility. If the problem
is diagnosed as mild male factor (a slightly lower than normal sperm count or
motility), Dr. Specialist may suggest doing an IUI (see “Artificial Insemination?
No, It’s Real!” for details on IUI) to give the sperm a “leg up” on getting where
they need to be by washing them and placing them directly into the uterus.

If you’re not producing an egg or not releasing an egg, you may be prescribed
stimulating medications to increase egg production. If you’re getting your
period less than two weeks after you ovulate, your doctor may prescribe
progesterone for a suspected luteal phase defect, which we explain in the
section “Treating Luteal Phase Defects.”
Even if your partner’s sperm is fine, you’re ovulating, and your tubes have been
tested and found to be open, you may still be faced with so-called “unexplained
infertility.” Many studies have shown that couples with unexplained infertility
have substantially higher chances of pregnancy if the woman takes fertility
medications and the sperm are placed in the uterus with an IUI.
If you’ve gone several months without a positive pregnancy test, you may
end up doing all three: IUI, gonadotropins (stimulating medications), and
progesterone supplementation.
“Take two Clomid and call 
me in three months”
The prescription Dr. Basic hands you (if you can decipher it) at the end of
your first visit may say “Clomiphene citrate 50 mgm qd X 5 days, #10. Refills
3.” Or it may simply say “CC 50mg qd d 3-7.” What does this mean?
Clomiphene citrate, more commonly called Clomid or Serophene (two brand
names), is given to help you make an egg or to help you make a better egg; it
may also help sustain a pregnancy by creating an egg whose corpus luteum
(see Chapter 2 for more about the function of the corpus luteum) produces
higher progesterone levels. Normally, you take Clomid for five days. Some
doctors start you on it on day three of your cycle, and others start you on
day four or five. The exact timing isn’t important; the point is to start it
before your ovaries start to develop one dominant follicle.
Usually your doctor will give you one pill a day the first month or two and
then move up to two or three tablets a day if you still don’t seem to be ovu-
lating regularly. Clomid comes in 50 milligram tablets, so if your doctor starts
you at a higher dose, 100 to 150 milligrams per day, you’ll need to take more
than one. After you stop taking the pills, you can check for ovulation by using
your old friends, the basal thermometer and the ovulation predictor kits.
Clomid works by fooling the body into thinking it’s not making enough estro-
gen. When your hypothalamus thinks that you’re low on estrogen, it releases
GnRH (gonadotropin-releasing hormone), which stimulates the release of FSH
(follicle-stimulating hormone) into your blood. The FSH stimulates the ovary
to produce estrogen, so that a follicle will begin to grow. 
198
Part IV: Moving Up to High-Tech Conception 

Eighty percent or so of women taking Clomid ovulate in response to this stim-
ulation. Clomid works best for those whose ovaries are capable of function-
ing normally but need a little tune-up. If you’re already ovulating a mature
follicle regularly, Clomid can help by increasing the stimulation to the ovary,
or even by causing you to ovulate more than one egg. In the latter cases, the
Clomid is generally combined with an IUI.
Your doctor may want you to have an ultrasound before starting Clomid each
month to make sure you don’t have any ovarian cysts. Most pregnancies from
Clomid occur in the first three to six months of therapy if the drug is taken
for anovulation.
Clomid has a few drawbacks, including the chance for multiple births.
Between 5 and 10 percent of all Clomid pregnancies are twins, 1 in 400 is a
triplet pregnancy, and 1 pregnancy in 800 results in quadruplets. Obviously,
you may be delighted to have a twin pregnancy, but triplets or quads may not
be so thrilling. Higher-order multiples (triplets and above) have a very high
rate of premature delivery and significantly higher than normal maternal and
infant complications. Multiples result from Clomid working too well and stim-
ulating more than one follicle to grow.
Some doctors monitor you with ultrasounds while you’re on Clomid to be
sure that you’re not making too many eggs. If you’re making a large number 
of eggs, you may develop ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, which can
cause a very high estradiol level, making hospitalization necessary. If you’re
on Clomid and feel very ill, with a sudden weight gain, severe bloating in your
abdomen, or abdominal pain, call your doctor immediately. This is a rare side
effect of Clomid.
Clomid also has some less serious side effects, some annoying, some poten-
tially detrimental to pregnancy. For example:
 Because your body has been fooled into thinking that it doesn’t have
enough estrogen, you may have some of the same symptoms women
have when they enter menopause and their estrogen drops: hot flashes,
headaches, nausea, or blurred vision. Some doctors may give you estro-
gen to decrease your symptoms.
 Clomid can also interfere with your production of cervical mucus because
it locks into all the estrogen receptors, including those in your cervix, 
so they don’t make mucus in response to rising estrogen levels like they
normally do. Because estrogen also builds your uterine lining, some
women on Clomid don’t make a thick lining. If you have either of these
side effects, you may need to take estrogen after you start making a folli-
cle. If your cervical mucus is decreased, an IUI may be in order to bypass
the mucus altogether and deposit the sperm directly into the uterus (see
Chapter 5 for more information on the importance of cervical mucus).

Chapter 13: A Little Help from Dr. Specialist

“Artificial” Insemination? No, It’s Real!
Artificial insemination may sound like it’s a fake procedure, but it’s the real
thing. Artificial insemination (another term for “insemination”, which in
today’s day and age means “intrauterine insemination” or IUI) means simply
that sperm is placed into the uterus to give it a “leg up” on getting where it
needs to go, which is to your egg.
You may or may not be taking stimulating medications to create more eggs
during an IUI cycle. Some doctors start with Clomid, a pill given to increase
your egg output, and move up after a few months to stimulation with
gonadotropins. In the past, some doctors would simply monitor your normal
cycle and inseminate, hoping to fertilize the one or possibly two follicles you
produce each month. This may be okay if you’re using donor sperm; how-
ever, there’s no evidence that an IUI without stimulation increases the
chances of pregnancy in unexplained infertility.
Measuring your chance for success
Artificial insemination will not increase your chances over timed intercourse
if you have a normal semen analysis and normal ovulation (see Chapter 11
for more about semen analysis). Nor will IUI be effective if the problem is
severe male factor (a very low sperm count or antisperm antibodies) or
blocked tubes.
Although statistics reported for IUI seem to vary widely, most studies have
shown about a 10 per month success rate for women under age 35, using
clomiphene plus IUI, with decreasing success as your age goes up. Injectable
medications produce more follicles per month and thus, the per cycle suc-
cess rate with their use along with IUI is a little higher, about 15 percent for
women under 35. Many experts believe that your chance of getting pregnant
after six failed IUI cycles is slim unless you do in vitro fertilization.
Collecting sperm
When your partner is directed to produce a semen sample in a cup, you may
have a mental picture of a little paper drinking cup. Of course, no clinics use
paper cups to collect sperm — at least, we hope they don’t. Clinics give the
guys a plastic sterile container for this purpose.
Semen collection and concentration are a big part of IUI. Several methods are
used both to collect and to concentrate the sperm:
200
Part IV: Moving Up to High-Tech Conception 

 Clean container collection: A sterile container is used to collect the
sample obtained through masturbation.
 Condom collection: A special condom containing no lubricants or sper-
micides is used if the semen sample has to be collected during inter-
course. This method is useful for those whose religious beliefs prohibit
masturbation. This method is not as good as masturbation, because less
of the specimen is collected, plus contact between the semen and the
penis inevitably introduces bacteria into the specimen.
 Withdrawal: Other men who cannot masturbate may be able to ejaculate
as a result of intercourse and withdraw at the last minute to collect the
specimen into a sterile cup. This takes a certain presence of mind! This
method is also not as good as masturbation for the same reasons as the
condom collection method, but may actually result in a slightly better
collection and a slightly cleaner specimen than the condom method.
Don’t be insulted if the andrologist (the person who deals with sperm) asks
whether there was any spillage. This isn’t a comment on your general clumsi-
ness or the look of your sample! The first part of the semen has the highest
concentration of sperm, so if any was lost, your semen sample may not be as
good as it should be.
Sperm need to be “washed” before they’re ready for IUI. Washing must be
done because the unwashed semen specimen contains not only the sperm,
but also the seminal plasma. This liquid, which originates in the prostate
gland, is designed to protect the sperm from the acidic environment of the
vagina. It is alkaline, forms a sticky clump to keep the sperm in the vagina,
and contains large amounts of prostaglandins, chemicals that cause smooth
muscle contractions. None of these qualities are favorable for a trip directly
into the uterine cavity. If a large amount of semen — more than 0.2 ml — is
injected unwashed into the uterus, the prostaglandins can cause severe
cramping at the least! 
If you’re picturing the washing process being done in a little machine with 
a spin cycle, you’re partially right! The semen specimen is first diluted with 
culture media (a sperm nutrient solution) and the sperm are spun down into
a little pellet in a centrifuge before being placed in the uterus. One method
spins the sperm in a centrifuge, and another puts the sperm on the bottom 
of a test tube and allows the best sperm to swim up, and third method com-
bines the two: centrifugation followed by swim-up. Another common method
used puts the sperm on top of several layers of washing media; the tube is
spun down, and the pellet on the bottom will contain the largest amount of
motile, healthy sperm. The sperm pellet is then placed via catheter into the
uterus. All methods have in common the concept of isolating the sperm from
the seminal plasma.
The main risks of doing IUI are risk of infection and risk of multiple births if
you’re taking medication to stimulate growth of more than one follicle.
201
Chapter 13: A Little Help from Dr. Specialist

Checking out your egg
IUI and timed intercourse (timed for your ovulation) will work only if the
sperm arrives in the right place at the right time — when you have a mature
egg. Making sure that you’re making a follicle and checking it for maturity
before an IUI increase your chances of pregnancy.
Monitoring your hormone level
One way to be sure you’re making a good egg is to monitor your hormone
levels. As you start to make a mature egg, your estradiol starts to rise. A good
egg should produce an estradiol of 150 to 300 pg/ml. About 30 hours before
your egg releases, your LH will also start to rise; a good LH surge is usually
over 40.
Thar she blows: Ultrasounds before and after ovulation
Many fertility doctors use pelvic ultrasound to monitor the growth of ovarian
follicles. Ultrasound works by bouncing high-frequency sound waves off
internal organs. Unlike X-rays, ultrasounds don’t expose you to radiation.
There are two types of pelvic ultrasound:
 Transvaginal ultrasound: This procedure uses a long, wand-like probe
that can be embarrassing if you’re very modest. In addition, the moving
probe can cause uncomfortable pressure. This method, which can be
done with an empty bladder, gives better images than abdominal ultra-
sounds in most cases.
For a transvaginal ultrasound, you undress from the waist down, cover
yourself with a sheet, and lie flat on your back with your legs in typical
exam table stirrups. The ultrasound technician or your doctor inserts
the vaginal probe after covering the tip with transducing jelly and 
placing a condom over it. The tip of the wand is smaller than a vaginal
speculum. Some centers ask you to insert the probe yourself. The tech-
nician moves the wand from side to side to record good pictures of your
ovaries and uterus.
 Abdominal ultrasound: This procedure requires a full bladder. The
images aren’t usually as clear as the transvaginal ultrasound.
For an abdominal ultrasound, you pull your pants down to the pubic
hair line. Jelly is placed directly on your stomach, and the technician
then moves the transducer (a small hand-held device about the size of
your hand) over it. Be aware that, because you have a full bladder, this
pressure can be uncomfortable.
A full bladder is needed for abdominal ultrasound for this reason: The
uterus and ovaries normally lie behind the intestines, but a full bladder
moves the uterus back and pushes the intestine up, so the uterus and
ovaries can be seen more clearly. The bladder also provides a fluid con-
trast that makes the uterus easier to identify.
202
Part IV: Moving Up to High-Tech Conception 

There are no known side effects from ultrasound. When your ultrasound is
finished, you can go home with no special instructions.
If your doctor does ultrasounds during the first two weeks of your cycle,
you’ll see your follicle growing as your estradiol rises and your LH surges;
usually the follicle is about 22 to 25 millimeters at the time of ovulation. Many
centers do an ultrasound the day of IUI and the day after, to make sure that
the egg has released from the follicle; when this happens, the follicle shrinks
on ultrasound. Without a release ultrasound, you may be making a good folli-
cle but not having the egg release. Pregnancy can’t occur unless the egg
releases. Some clinics will ask you to come back for a second IUI if the follicle
is still there, hoping that it will ovulate before you come back the next day.
Getting the timing right
Timing is all important when doing IUI because washed sperm don’t seem to
live as long as sperm ejaculated into the vagina. At best, washed sperm are
thought to live 24 hours, while ejaculated sperm can live up to 3 days nor-
mally, and as long as 5 days in optimal mucus. What this means is that IUI
timing has to be well coordinated, with egg release and sperm placement
timed so that the short lived sperm can get to the egg at the right time.
Sharon remembers talking to an out-of-state friend who was not a patient
about her IUIs and suggesting to her (she still blushes at her audacity about
this!) that she talk to her doctor about the timing of her IUIs, since she hadn’t
gotten pregnant in three cycles. She did; he (what a great doc!) listened to
her, changed the timing slightly, and she got pregnant the next cycle — with
triplets! 
Moving Up to Controlled Ovarian
Hyperstimulation
Clomid is usually the first drug given to start your follicles growing because it
can be given orally and has fewer side effects than injections. If Clomid isn’t
working for you after a few months, your doctor may suggest moving up to
the big time: injecting gonadotropins, a technique called controlled ovarian
hyperstimulation, or COH for short. We talk about gonadotropins in the sec-
tion “Defining gonadotropins,” later in this chapter.
Understanding the need for injections
With COH, the goal is to make more than one or two follicles. The reasoning
is that if you make a few more follicles, you have a better chance of getting
pregnant each month. 
203
Chapter 13: A Little Help from Dr. Specialist

Obviously, taking injections is a big step. Not only do you have a possibility
of making too many follicles when taking injectable stimulating medications,
but you also have to deal with the logistics of COH, including going in for fre-
quent blood tests and ultrasounds and finding someone to give you your
injections. Some clinics may offer to give the injections, usually for a small
fee, but others want your partner or someone else to come in and learn how
to give the shots. Fortunately, with newer formulations of the gonadotropins,
many can be given subcutaneously (called “sub-cu” for short, it means that
the shot is given with a small needle just under the skin, much like an insulin
shot that may be taken by a diabetic. It’s physically easy to self-inject these
medications; of course that doesn’t account for the psychological difficulties!
Getting injections from your partner
Believe it or not, most partners do very well giving injections — after the first
few times, that is. Giving shots is a learning experience, and unfortunately,
you are the learning tool in this experience.
Your clinic will probably show you and your partner how to give injections,
and it may send you home with a video and an informational tearsheet that
you’ll refer to frequently in the first few days.
Is it really safe to put a needle in the hand of a totally untrained person and
tell them to have at it? Statistically speaking, yes. Millions of diabetics inject
themselves every day or have someone else do it. The biggest risks are from
infection and hitting a nerve. You can prevent infection with a careful sterile
technique, and hitting a nerve can happen to anyone, even a professional,
because your anatomy may not look like the textbook picture.
If at all possible, insist on doing your first injection in front of someone at
your clinic, so a person skilled in this procedure can critique and give point-
ers. Also, after you and your partner have done it once, your partner is less
likely to pass out the first time you do an injection at home.
Giving yourself shots
Sometimes, for whatever reason, you may have to give yourself the shots.
Maybe you don’t have a partner, maybe your partner is locked in the bath-
room refusing to give you a shot, or maybe you travel a lot. You can inject
yourself, although it’s a bit trickier.
If you know that you’ll be doing your own injections, ask your doctor if he can
give you subcutaneous gonadotropins. These are injected with a very tiny
needle — like a diabetic needle — and can be used in the top of your leg, in your
stomach, or in the back of your arm, although this latter site is a hard place to
inject yourself. Subcutaneous gonadotropins are recombinant or purified, so
they can be injected subcutaneously without causing a rash. The medication
your doctor orders depends primarily on personal preference, since there are
no studies proving the superiority of one medication over another.
204
Part IV: Moving Up to High-Tech Conception 

If you end up taking intramuscular injections, such as Repronex, made from
human urinary proteins, standing in front of a mirror when you give them may
be helpful. Or ask your clinic if you can inject them into the top of your leg.
Your doctor may recommend that you take all medication intramuscularly if
your body mass index (BMI) is over 30, so that the medications will be
absorbed better.
Defining gonadotropins
Gonadotropins are stimulating medications (see Chapter 22 for the most 
commonly used ones), meaning that they make follicles grow. Each follicle
contains an egg, so making five follicles each month rather than one or two
gives you a better shot at getting pregnant.
Gonadotropins contain either all follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) or a 
combination of FSH and luteinizing hormone (LH). Some doctors prefer that
you have a little LH because they feel it aids stimulation, while others prefer 
a pure FSH product. Urinary products are cheaper and some need to be
injected intramuscularly, although most of the newer medications are
injected subcutaneously.
Some doctors have definite preferences about which type and brand of drug
you should take. Sometimes the preference is medical, and sometimes it
depends on which drug company representative has been in the office most
recently. The reality is that studies that have tried to compare the various
medications have consistently failed to demonstrate the superiority of one
medication over another.
Exploring the side effects
Because these drugs are hormones (which stimulate your ovaries to make
more hormones), you can expect to be more “hormonal” when taking them.
The most common side effects are headache, bloating, weight gain, and mood
swings. Obviously, the hormone changes are going to be a big part of making
a stressful situation worse for some people.
Deciding which medication to use
All gonadotropins are purified in the laboratory from a raw protein product.
This product can be either the urine of menopausal women, or the product 
of a cell culture which has been bio-engineered to make gonadotropins. The
cells which are used for this are Chinese hamster ovary cells which have had
the DNA for the gonadotropins injected into them. When the cells grow, they
205
Chapter 13: A Little Help from Dr. Specialist

make FSH, LH, or HCG, depending on which DNA is in the cells. The choice
between medications depends on several things:
 With which medication does your doctor feel most comfortable working?
If your doctor has a preference, ask him why. He may have done or read
studies that have influenced his opinion that one is better than the other.
 Do you have drug coverage? Which medication will it cover? If your pre-
scription plan covers only one type of injectable, that’s probably what
you’ll get. If you have no drug coverage, you may want to go with what’s
least expensive.
 How needlephobic are you? If you’re extremely needlephobic, you’ll
need to go with subcutaneous medications (see the section “Giving
yourself shots,” earlier in this chapter) or risk being a wreck for two
weeks, dreading each shot.
 Do you have someone to give you your injections? If you’ll be doing
most of your shots yourself, you’ll probably want to do subcutaneous
injections.
 Have you taken one or the other in the past? How did you respond? If
you’ve taken stimulating medications before, you have some kind of
track record. Did you do well on that medication? If not, you’ll probably
want to try something different. If you did well, you may want to do the
same, because changing to something else may change your results.
Mimicking nature with a minipump
When all else fails, some fertility specialists may use a rarely-used method 
of ovulation induction: stimulating the pituitary with an infusion pump. The
pump, which can administer either intravenous or subcutaneous doses of
gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), attempts to mimic nature by releas-
ing a small dose of GnRH every 90 minutes. This stimulates your body to pro-
duce LH and FSH.
The benefits of the pump over LH and FSH injections are the following:
 It doesn’t require daily injections.
 Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, described in the section “Ensuring
proper monitoring throughout your cycle,” later in this chapter, is not 
as common.
 You have less chance of a multiple pregnancy.
Disadvantages of the pump are the following:
 It’s expensive.
 It must be inserted and refilled by a physician.
 It increases the chance of infection.
206
Part IV: Moving Up to High-Tech Conception 

Injecting HCG to mature your eggs
The last injection you’ll take when doing COH is called HCG, or human 
chorionic gonadotropin, a luteinizing hormone substitute given to mature 
your eggs and help them release from their follicles. It’s usually given a day
or two before your IUI.
The HCG injection is not always necessary. Most of the time, when you take
gonadotropins, this affects your ability to release LH at the right time and in
quantities sufficient to induce follicle release. For this reason, HCG is given 
as a substitute LH surge. However, in some cases, LH release does take place.
The risk is that your IUI may be timed on the basis of the HCG injection, 
and if you have already ovulated on your own, the timing will be wrong.
Therefore, some fertility clinics ask the patients to monitor their LH surge
with a urinary ovulation kit, and others instruct the patients to have inter-
course every other day during the gonadtropin stimulation “just in case.”
HCG helps the eggs in the follicles to mature and complete the cell division
needed before they can be fertilized. HCG is made by several companies (see
Chapter 22) and is usually given intramuscularly; a newer laboratory-created
HCG called Ovidrel can be given subcutaneously.
Don’t take nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories such as aspirin, Motrin, 
or ibuprofen during the middle part of your cycle. They may inhibit
prostaglandin production, which may keep you from ovulating.
Ensuring proper monitoring throughout your cycle
If you’re taking stimulating medications of any kind — injectables or Clomid —
your clinic may want to monitor you to make sure that you’re not making too
many eggs. Some centers will cancel your IUI or insist that you do in vitro fer-
tilization if you’re making a lot of eggs because the risk of hyperstimulation
and getting pregnant with triplets — or more — is increased.
Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) is a serious complication that
could land you in the hospital. It starts when you take injectable stimulating
medications and make a lot of follicles. If your estradiol rises over 1500, OHSS
may occur; it’s more common with IVF but can also occur with IUI cycles.
Some symptoms of OHSS are the following:
 Difficulty urinating
 Difficulty breathing
 Sudden weight gain of ten pounds or more
If you have OHSS, your clinic may want to monitor your blood count, liver
function, weight, and urine output. OHSS may not resolve itself for several
weeks, and symptoms may worsen if you’re pregnant.
207
Chapter 13: A Little Help from Dr. Specialist

OHSS isn’t the only complication of taking gonadotropins or Clomid; multiple
pregnancies of five or more babies are usually the result of stimulating med-
ications. Albeit rare (there’s a reason why they make the evening news!),
these high-order multiples are more often the result of IUI or timed inter-
course than IVF because IVF can control the number of embryos put back
into the uterus, whereas IUI can’t. The number of follicles you have is the
number of babies you could end up with!
Treating Luteal Phase Defects
Luteal phase, in fertility circles, means the two weeks after you ovulate and
before your period starts. You may be diagnosed with luteal phase defect
(LPD) if your period starts ten or so days after you ovulate, rather than the
normal two-week period. If you’ve been monitoring your BBT (basal body
temperature), you may see an early drop in your temperature as well, but
this is not considered a reliable indicator of LPD. LPD can be caused by the
following problems with the corpus luteum or with the uterine lining.
After you ovulate, the leftover shell of your follicle, now called the corpus
luteum, starts to produce progesterone. Progesterone stimulates the uterine
lining to produce extra blood vessels so that the embryo has a good supply
to support its growth if it attaches.
A poorly developed follicle, or one that releases an abnormal egg, won’t put
out enough progesterone to properly develop the lining. In this case, the
treatment is not more progesterone after you ovulate, but stimulating med-
ications to produce a better-quality follicle.
Some women have a uterine lining that doesn’t respond normally to proges-
terone, and in these cases, progesterone supplements may be helpful. The
best way to evaluate your lining is to have an endometrial biopsy done; an
ultrasound done a week after you ovulate can also show if your lining is
changing to a pattern needed for implantation. 
If you get your period less than two weeks after you ovulate, it’s important 
to have a biopsy done to check your progesterone. An endometrial biopsy
involves scraping a little of your uterine lining with a small curette. The
scraping is then checked to see whether the lining has responded appropri-
ately to the progesterone and whether it is capable of supporting embryo
implantation. A biopsy is done in your doctor’s office, usually the day of a
negative pregnancy test before your period starts.
208
Part IV: Moving Up to High-Tech Conception 

Boosting Progesterone
Because progesterone is essential to maintain pregnancy, many doctors give
progesterone supplements in pill, suppository, or injection form to all their
infertility patients on an “it can’t hurt and might help” basis. Most doctors
want to see a progesterone blood level of at least 10 and preferably 15 ng/ml
after ovulation.
Another way to raise progesterone levels is to give HCG “boosters,” usually a
2,500 IU injection of HCG every few days. HCG stimulates the corpus luteum
so that it puts out more progesterone. The disadvantage to boosters is that
your pregnancy test will be positive, even if you’re not pregnant, for up to ten
days after the last HCG injection. Furthermore, HCG injections increase the
risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). 
If you’ve taken gonadotropins, you may be given both progesterone and
estrogen supplements after you ovulate. Your doctor may prescribe them
because gonadotropin administration can affect embryo implantation by
interfering with normal hormonal production after ovulation.
The main problem is that when gonadotropins are given to stimulate follicle
development, the luteal phase is very often shortened as a result of estrogen
and progesterone secretion dropping prematurely. In other words, both estro-
gen and progesterone secretion drops off earlier than the two weeks which
are thought to be needed to allow good embryo implantation. For many
years, progesterone alone was given and it is probably enough by itself. More
recently, because of the strong stimulation used in conjunction with IVF, both
estrogen and progesterone have been used. Either way (progesterone alone
or both estrogen and progesterone), the idea is to extend the duration of the
luteal phase so that embryo implantation has the best chance of occurring
before the lining starts to break down in the next menstrual cycle. 
Getting Your Medications for Less
As any smart shopper knows, it’s always best to avoid paying the retail price.
Instead, look for outlets, sales, and other bargains that can help you get the
same product for less money. In this section, we discuss some of the “deals”
available when purchasing fertility medications.

Chapter 13: A Little Help from Dr. Specialist

Shopping at mail-order pharmacies
Many doctors suggest that you order your medications from one of the mail-
order pharmacies now specializing in fertility medications. (See Chapter 22
for a list of some of the biggest mail-order pharmacies.) These pharmacies
carry all fertility medications, can ship quickly, and often offer the best
prices. In addition, they may provide 24-hour access to nurses or pharma-
cists who can answer questions for you and Web sites that address common
concerns. Many mail-order pharmacies offer overnight shipping at no addi-
tional cost with a minimum order. Many mail-order pharmacies also provide
booklets, tapes, and hotlines to provide you with information any time of the
day or night.
Another added benefit is virtual anonymity. You won’t risk standing next to a
nosy neighbor who’s certain to share your fertility battle with the neighbor-
hood, if not the world. Mail-order pharmacies are subject to the same Food
and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations as your corner drugstore and are
completely safe to use.
Making a quick trip over the border
For those adventurous types who would rather use the drive-through to get
low-cost medications, should you consider a trip over the border? Mexico
and Canada are both sources for lower-cost medications, and for some
people, they’re only a car ride away. Do remember, however, that the stan-
dard in the United States, set by the FDA, is quite rigid, and you have no guar-
antee that other countries will employ the same quality controls. The more
Westernized a country, the more likely it is to maintain standards similar to
those of the United States. But if you want the security of homegrown prod-
ucts, the only option is to stay home!
When we speak of going over the border to buy medications, we’re not referring
to scoring fertility drugs from the guy on the corner. Your only source should be
the local pharmacy. Some individuals and couples join forces and elect a repre-
sentative to travel across the border and fill prescriptions for the group.
Turning to drug studies 
Another option for low-cost or no-cost medications is to get involved in a
drug or protocol study, which is generally run by larger institutions or drug
companies. Ask your doctor if he is aware of any existing studies for which
you may qualify. Internet bulletin boards also have this information, and
other fertility patients often pass along information on studies that their doc-
tors or others are conducting. Studies usually provide only free medications.
You would still be required to pay for any procedures, such as IUI or IVF.

Deciding How Long to Keep 
Trying COH and IUI
Because statistics vary so much on successful COH plus IUI, it can be difficult
to know when to say “enough.” You may also notice that every doctor has a
different take on your odds for success. Although most doctors quote you
numbers that reflect their own success with any given process, they may also
alter them a bit to better reflect your age or your response to treatment so far.
Many doctors use the “three strikes and you’re out” rule. In other words, they
have you try a particular method three times and then move on to something
else if that approach doesn’t work. Others point out that if a particular proto-
col hasn’t worked by (for example) the fourth try, the odds of success are
greatly diminished.
Jackie and her husband were beyond her doctor’s statistics, which showed
that 87 percent of his patients became pregnant by IUI #4, if at all. In fact, 
it was the baker’s dozen, the lucky stimulated cycle #13 (IUI #7), that finally
stuck!
But, regardless of whether you’re on IUI #1, 4, or 40, after a while, it all
becomes a bit too much.
Growing sick of getting stuck
Perhaps you grew sick of waiting when the first home pregnancy test read
negative. But even if you’re more patient, what if a month, or two or three, 
of nightly injections of hormones is just about all you can handle?
First off, be assured that your impatience and irritability aren’t a reflection of
your winning personality, but more likely the side effects of the drugs you’re
taking. Most women find that acknowledging that their moods or mood swings
are largely chemical in nature does lessen the burden. If you haven’t confided
in a friend about your fertility struggles, perhaps now is as good a time as any.
You’ll find that friends or relatives in the know will treat you with kid gloves
right about the time that you’re ready to pull out the boxing gloves.
Another thing to remember is the numbers game that is human reproduction.
One of our favorite stories is that of a professional basketball player who
smiled and clapped every time he missed a free throw. When asked about
this odd behavior, he responded, “With every miss, I’m one shot closer to
success.” Consider your shots the same way.
211
Chapter 13: A Little Help from Dr. Specialist

Being sensitive to your partner’s feelings
Just as you may find the fertility rituals to be all-consuming, your partner
may be sharing your views, more than you know. The partner being treated
may feel that he or she is undergoing the lion’s share of discomfort and dis-
appointment. But remember, even if your partner isn’t experiencing every
needle stick or test result, that person is watching you go through it. “Big
deal!” you scoff. Well, it can be. Watching another person experience pain 
or sadness can be as difficult as going through it yourself. The silent partner
also must suffer with feelings of inadequacy and powerlessness in being
unable to relieve your discomfort. Partners of terminally ill patients often
need their own support networks as well. And, as a recent study reveals, 
fertility patients, due to the sometimes long nature of their treatment, share
some of the same issues faced by the chronically and terminally ill.
Encourage your partner to share his or her feeling with friends, family, or a
professional. Although you may feel as though you’re losing your sanity, your
partner may feel as though he’s losing you.

Welcome to the Big Time: 
In Vitro Fertilization
In This Chapter
 Moving up to in vitro fertilization
 Finding the right clinic
 Funding IVF
I
n vitro fertilization (IVF) and the other assisted reproductive technologies
(ARTs) represent the top of the high-tech mountain of infertility treat-
ments, so naturally, you may be a bit nervous about moving into an invasive,
expensive, no-guarantees treatment. The good news is that high-tech fertility
has come a long way and is no longer a shot in the dark. Pregnancy rates can
approach or even exceed 50 percent per attempt in good prognosis situa-
tions, and even if you are not under 35, IVF still represents your best chance
for fertility even if all simple treatments have already failed.
The term in vitro fertilization means fertilization (the joining of egg and
sperm) that occurs in the laboratory; that’s where the term “test tube baby”
comes from. Before you get to the fertilization point, you have to make eggs
with the help of stimulating medications called gonadotropins and retrieve
them from the follicles they grow in during an egg retrieval procedure.
Twenty years ago only a handful of clinics performed IVF. Now more than
400 clinics offer this service (just in the U.S. and Canada, never mind the hun-
dreds of clinics around the world), and IVF has become a big (and lucrative)
business.
In this chapter, we help you evaluate different IVF clinics, decipher the con-
fusing statistics about IVF success rates, and give you some help in deciding
whether IVF is the next step for you.

Reaching the Top of the Mountain: What
In Vitro Fertilization Means for You
For those of you who just basically need to know when to show up at the
clinic, here’s the scoop on IVF:
 IVF is expensive.
 IVF is time consuming.
 IVF is unpredictable.
 IVF does not guarantee success.
 IVF involves injections.
 IVF requires frequent ultrasounds and blood work.
 IVF can be frustrating; you will scream at the IVF nurses at least once
during your treatment.
 IVF can make your whole life stressful; you will scream at your partner at
least once, and then he’ll scream at the IVF nurses.
That’s all you really need to know — you can pick up the rest along the way.
But we thought you’d like some insights.
Perhaps the most intimidating part of IVF is the notion that you’re at the end
of the technologic line, the top of the fertility treatment mountain in your
quest for a biological baby. While part of you may feel enormous excitement
anticipating that you’ve finally found the magic path, the other part may fear
what will happen if IVF doesn’t work. If it fails, you may find yourself going
back to less-technological methods, or you may move forward to other
means of creating a family, such as donor egg or adoption. Think of IVF as a
beginning and one step closer to your dream, however it may be attained.
Understanding that IVF isn’t for everyone
Although IVF gets a large share of publicity when it comes to infertility, the
fact is that only about 2 percent of infertile couples actually end up doing 
IVF. (In 2003, approximately 122,000 IVF cycles were done in the United
States.) Because the techniques used and the ethical issues are still consid-
ered cutting edge, media coverage of IVF far exceeds that of, say, intrauterine
insemination. So it may seem that way more people are doing in vitro than
really are.
214
Part IV: Moving Up to High-Tech Conception 

Publicity for every celebrity IVF baby may also make it seem like IVF is a sure-
fire success method, but of course, media coverage is almost always oversim-
plified. However, the national statistics for live births per initiated IVF cycle are
about 35 percent — and that’s for women under age 35. The national statistics
break down this way (even though individual clinics may do a little better):
 Under age 35: A 37 percent chance of a live birth per IVF cycle
 Ages 35 to 37: Approximately 30 percent chance of taking home a baby
per IVF cycle
 Ages 38 to 40: A percent chance of a live birth per cycle
 Ages 41 to 42: An 11 percent chance of a live birth per cycle
 Over age 42: A 4 percent chance of a live birth per initiated cycle
 Over age 45: Virtually no chance of pregnancy unless you use donor eggs
If you want to see all the national statistics for ART, check out the following
Web site: www.cdc.gov/ART/ART2003/section1.htm.
The cost of one IVF cycle is about $8,000 to $10,000, which may or may not
include your medication and blood draws. It does generally include monitor-
ing, including ultrasound tests, egg retrieval, embryo culture, and embryo
transfer. Most centers charge extra for additional laboratory procedures, like
intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). Of course these items may not be
covered by insurance.
Looking at the preceding success rates, you can see that it may well take two
or more cycles to get pregnant with IVF, and the cost equals or exceeds a new
car. Plus, you have no guarantees of success. Sounds like a great way to
spend money, eh?
On the brighter side, if your insurance covers IVF, including medications and
ultrasounds, the only thing you have to lose is time.
Looking at the risks of IVF
Although IVF has become a familiar and accepted way of dealing with infertility,
it’s not entirely without risk. Some risks are well established, and others are
not as clear-cut. Before you decide to move on to IVF, consider these factors.
High rate of twins or triplets
The best documented risk of doing IVF is the high rate of twins or triplets.
Because more than one embryo, usually two to four, is placed into the uterus
215
Chapter 14: Welcome to the Big Time: In Vitro Fertilization

at one time, the risk of getting pregnant with more than one baby is high.
In the normal population, twins occur a little over 1 percent of the time, or
about 1 in 90 births in the United States. Contrast this with the fact that
about 25 percent of IVF births are twins! You may see this as an advantage —
two for the price of one — but the price tag on multiple deliveries is high.
About one-half of twins are born prematurely, (before 35 weeks gestation), or
with a low birth weight. Up to half have a lower than expected birth weight,
compared to 10 percent of single babies. One-half or more of twins are deliv-
ered by cesarean section, as compared with about 30 percent of the normal
population. (Of course, for reasons that are not clear, the cesarean section
rate after IVF, even for singletons, is substantially increased. It may be that
after all that work getting pregnant, more women are likely to simply sched-
ule their delivery and accept the cesarean as part of the deal.) Mothers of
twins are twice as likely to have preeclampsia (high blood pressure and fluid
retention, factors that can lead to preterm delivery and in extreme cases can
cause maternal seizures).
Neonatal deaths are rare these days. Nevertheless, premature infants in gen-
eral are three to six times more likely than full-term infants to die in the first
year of life. Premature babies also have a higher risk of vision problems, cere-
bral palsy, and learning difficulties. And you thought that getting pregnant
was the only thing you had to worry about!
Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome
Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) occurs in 1 to 5 percent of all
stimulated cycles in which gonadotropins, medications that stimulate growth
of follicles, are taken. OHSS can generally be managed with fluids and pain
control, but in extreme cases can cause serious maternal illness, including
blood clots and pulmonary emboli. Your doctor will monitor you for the
development of this serious complication, whether you are doing COH for IUI
or for IVF. In severe cases in association with IVF, pregnancy is intentionally
avoided by freezing all of the embryos and allowing the ovaries to return to
normal size before trying the embryo transfer. If you have OHSS, keep in
touch with the doctor’s office. Serious complications have been reported
after severe OHSS, including stroke.
Birth defects
An increase in the rate of birth defects is a controversial and as yet unproven
possibility in IVF. Some studies show an increase in birth defects in IVF preg-
nancies, while other studies don’t support this claim. This may be because
babies born after IVF tend to be scrutinized more than the general popula-
tion. It’s also not clear if an increase in birth defects is associated with IVF or
simply with infertility. Much more research will undoubtedly be done in this
area as IVF children become older. Techniques such as ICSI and assisted
hatching (see Chapter 12 for more on assisted hatching) have been done only
in the last ten years, so the children conceived are still young.
216
Part IV: Moving Up to High-Tech Conception 

It’s logical to expect that men who need to do ICSI for male factor issues may
pass the gene responsible to their sons, who will most likely also need to do
ICSI (or whatever the equivalent technique is) 20 or 30 years from now.
Deciding Whether to Stay 
with Your Current Doctor
The clinic you’ve been going to for IUI or monitoring may also perform IVF.
And if you’re comfortable with the staff and the doctors, know the routine,
and have all your insurance coverage set up there, you may decide to stay
with that clinic.
You should, however, think about it and do some reading before deciding to
stay with your current center. More than 400 U.S. clinics do IVF, and they
range from little more than the “weekend dabbler” that does maybe 30 to
40 egg retrievals a year to the megacenters that do more than 1,000 or even
2,000 egg retrievals a year.
Bigger isn’t always better, but when it comes to high-tech procedures such as
IVF, success rates are highly dependent on the quality of the IVF lab. It stands
to reason that a small center doing 30 or 40 retrievals a year may not have
the same lab setup as a center doing 1,000 a year. (This is why many small
centers actually use a lab that is associated with a large IVF center. You need
to ask and find out what the individual setup is.)
You can evaluate centers by:
 Comparing their statistics and what they offer via the Society of
Assisted Reproductive Technology (SART). SART is the professional
society for doctors and clinics performing IVF. At the very least, you
should be sure that the center with which you work belongs to SART.
A condition of membership is that every center sends all of their IVF
data to a central organization, which compiles and publishes them.
Since member clinics also voluntarily agree to have their data audited
periodically, SART is, in effect, the statistic watchdog of IVF. We describe
in detail what it monitors and how the statistics are compiled in the sec-
tion “Sorting through SART statistics,” later in this chapter.
 Talking to patients who are currently doing IVF there and to your
doctor or the nurses. Sometimes the nurses are more candid about
whether you should stay or move on, especially if they’ve gotten to
know you, like you, and want what’s best for you. If the nurse slips you a
little note about another clinic a few towns away, pay attention!
217
Chapter 14: Welcome to the Big Time: In Vitro Fertilization

Moving On: Finding Dr. Magic’s Clinic
Sometimes the decision to move on to another clinic is easily made. For
example, if your current clinic doesn’t take your insurance, you don’t like the
staff, or its hours aren’t convenient for the more intensive monitoring of IVF,
you know you need to switch doctors. Or maybe you need or want special-
ized treatment that your present clinic doesn’t do, such as sex selection,
preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD), or sperm aspiration. Luckily for
you, Dr. Magic most likely has a Web site, a good place to start looking
for your IVF doctor.
Searching through IVF Web sites
Most medium to large IVF clinics have a Web site. At the very least, the Web
site should tell you the following information:
 How many egg retrievals the clinic does in a year
 How many embryo transfers the clinic does in a year
 Pregnancy rates for all age groups, broken down per egg retrieval and
per embryo transfer
 Whether it freezes embryos
 Whether it does ICSI
 Whether it transfers three-day embryos or blastocysts (see Chapter 12)
 How many doctors do IVF
 The educational level of the doctors and whether the doctors are repro-
ductive endocrinologists
 Whether the clinic cycles patients through all the time or you have to
wait for the next group
 Whether the clinic has a donor egg or embryo program
You may have other concerns pertaining to your own situation. If you can’t
find the answer on the Web site, you may be able to call the center and ask to
speak to an IVF nurse. Usually they’re happy to answer any questions you
have about their program, and you won’t feel as committed as you might
after talking to a doctor. (You don’t have to give your real name, either!)
218
Part IV: Moving Up to High-Tech Conception 

Sorting through SART statistics
The Society of Assisted Reproductive Technology (SART) is an organization
affiliated with ASRM (American Society of Reproductive Medicine), the orga-
nization for healthcare professionals involved with reproductive medicine.
SART’s members are the approximately 430 IVF clinics in the United States
that submit the following information to SART for publication each year:
 The number of cycles they do
 The types of infertility their patients have
 The outcome of their cycles
 Pregnancy rates
 Multiple pregnancy rates
 Miscarriage rates
 Cancellation rates
In short, the clinics provide information on just about anything and every-
thing concerning their patients’ IVF cycles.
SART takes the information and compiles a booklet of information about
every one of the 437 clinics and distributes it to its members; it also pub-
lishes the data on its Web site. SART data is also found with other data from
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
Clinics that are members of SART can be audited and their data checked for
accuracy. The amount of information required by SART is astounding: Your
age, Social Security number, infertility type, and type of cycle are reported to
SART for every IVF cycle that you do. In most medium to large clinics, compil-
ing and reporting SART data take a tremendous amount of time.
SART confirms clinic-reported data by visiting about 30 clinics a year and
auditing selected patients’ charts to make sure that the submitted informa-
tion is accurate.
Individual clinic statistics presented on their Web sites can be difficult to
read because not all clinics report their numbers in the same way. For exam-
ple, one clinic may report pregnancy rates per retrieval, and another may
report per transfer. One advantage of the SART data is that it does allow you
to compare apples to apples when sifting through SART data. But remember
that statistics do not tell the whole story. For example, SART statistics don’t
tell you anything about the clinic population except for its breakdown by age.
A center dealing with only the crème de la crème of patients, the place every-
one else calls the “Mecca,” certainly has higher pregnancy rates than the
center that treats everyone, including patients rejected at the Mecca.
219
Chapter 14: Welcome to the Big Time: In Vitro Fertilization

Looking for a clinic
Although SART statistics make interesting reading and may help you decide
which clinic to use, they don’t tell the whole story. You also need to check
into the following information:
 The clinics that are nearest to you. Long-distance IVF is possible but
complicated.
 The clinics that are accepting new patients.
 How much clinics charge if you don’t have insurance.
 Whether the clinics take insurance — not all do!
 Whether the clinics treat patients like you, an important consideration if
you’re over age 40 or have been turned down by another clinic.
 The kind of feeling you get from the clinic. For the answer to this ques-
tion, you’ll probably need to make a consultation appointment with a
doctor. The clinic usually charges for this appointment. However, com-
pared with all of the other costs associated with fertility treatment, the
cost of the initial consultation is a relative bargain! You will have uninter-
rupted “quality” time with the doctor for 45 minutes to an hour. Before
deciding on the clinic with which you are going to work, you should seri-
ously consider visiting two or three that you picked out. You will find
that this is a worthwhile investment of time and money.
You don’t need to commit to a program at your initial consultation. It never
hurts to go home and think everything over before you go any further.
Remember, also, that if you’re at one of the big-name clinics, you’re also
being sized up as a candidate for its program, and you could be turned down
for treatment if you don’t fit the clinic’s criteria. Some centers don’t want to
give you false hope if they don’t believe that they can help you, and others
don’t want to bring down their statistics.
Whether you need or want to know everything about a clinic before you go
there depends on your personality. You may be happy to go wherever it was
that your best friend went, or to go where your insurance tells you to go, or
to go to the clinic around the corner. There’s nothing wrong with trusting
your instincts and other people’s personal experiences. However, if you’re
already filling up infertility notebook number three, your family doctor’s rec-
ommendation that you just go to his golfing buddy probably isn’t going to
convince you.
220
Part IV: Moving Up to High-Tech Conception 

Evaluating a clinic’s personality
IVF clinics have personalities just like people do, and just like with individu-
als, you may find your personality is a better fit at some clinics than at
others. Usually, but not always, the head honcho or main doctor at the clinic
sets the tone for the whole office. Sometimes instead of one main doctor, a
clinic has a team of fairly equal doctors, all of whom leave their impression
on the way the clinic functions. Here’s a rundown on the most common types
of offices and what you may encounter when you enter their doors:
 The razzle-dazzle office: They have the name recognition and reputa-
tion as the “Meccas of infertility.” These places are selective and often
expensive, but you’ll probably feel like you’re in first class if you go
there. And because their reputation is based on success, you may well
get pregnant here — if they’ll take you as a patient.
 The serious office: Dr. Serious and his cohort, Dr. Seriously Published,
take infertility very seriously indeed. Their offices are quiet, well orga-
nized, and feature conversations peppered with statistics. If you’re a
serious type yourself, you’ll love Dr. Serious.
 The gloom-and-doom office: If you have a naturally pessimistic nature,
Drs. Gloom and Doom will foster your natural tendencies. They want to
make sure you understand all the problems you’ll have getting pregnant,
so they dwell on them in great detail. A visit with Dr. Doom and Gloom
may cause you to need antidepressants before each visit.
 The chaotic office: They lost your appointment, can’t find your chart, and
dropped your blood down the sink by mistake? Welcome to Dr. Chaotic’s
office, where nothing ever seems to go the way it should. However,
because Dr. Chaotic is often an original thinker with great ideas, wade
through the chaos if you think he can help your unique situation.
Just keep duplicate copies of everything.
Why IVF Costs So Much — Especially
Without a Free Toaster
No, you won’t get a free toaster at your IVF clinic, but you may feel like you
should. Why on earth does IVF cost so much? Although supply and demand
may have a bearing on costs — in other words, doctors respond to market
pressures — the fact is that IVF costs are high because IVF is a high-tech 
procedure and high tech costs money. An IVF lab costs over a million dollars
to set up, and you will see lots of employees — nurses, lab personnel, ultra-
sound techs — when you go for your consultation. 
221
Chapter 14: Welcome to the Big Time: In Vitro Fertilization

However, it’s hard to feel sorry for your fertility clinic when you’re the one
who will be pouring thousands of dollars into its coffers. In the next sections,
we help you get every penny out of your insurance company to which you’re
entitled to help pay for your IVF cycle.
Discovering what your insurance 
plan really covers
Even if you have insurance coverage, you may be amazed to see how little of
your IVF bill is covered. Some insurance plans cover only monitoring, mean-
ing the frequent blood draws and ultrasounds. Because these can run well
over $2,000 per cycle, this coverage is a help. Other plans cover only the
medications, which is a help, but not by any means relief from the total cost.
Nor is it easy in some cases to decipher your insurance plan. Check out your
plan before you start treatment. Even if you live in a state with mandated cov-
erage, your particular employer may find several loopholes to slip through.
Finding out you’re not covered at the pharmacy the night before your cycle is
supposed to begin isn’t a good way to start treatment.
Many insurance companies require preauthorization even if you do have cov-
erage. Preauthorization can take several days to complete, so don’t leave this
step until the last minute!
You may be covered only if you go to an “approved” clinic. But what if you
don’t want to go to this clinic? Maybe it doesn’t offer treatments you want, or
it doesn’t have high success rates. In that case, you’ll be forced to make an
unpleasant choice: Will you go for care that costs you less but may not suc-
ceed, or will you pay more for a higher chance of success? These decisions
would have had even King Solomon, the master of wise decisions in the Old
Testament, in a quandary.

Insurance 101: The differences 
between types of insurance
You may be confused over whether your insur-
ance is public or private, group or individual.
Public insurance is paid for, at least in part, by
the government. Medicaid, for those on public
assistance; Medicare, for those over age 62 or
disabled in some way; and CHAMPUS, for mili-
tary families, are public insurances. Private
insurances are paid for by you, either directly
or indirectly. If your employer pays the costs for
you as part of a benefits package, you have
group insurance. If you pay the entire cost
yourself, you have an individual policy, which is
usually quite expensive.

Changing jobs or changing insurance 
to get infertility coverage
People have been known to change jobs to get better insurance, or to drop
insurance at their place of employment and pick up coverage under their
spouse’s policy, even if it costs more per month.
Is it worth taking a lesser-paying job to cover IVF costs? If the drop in pay
isn’t too much, it might be. Three or four IVF cycles could certainly cost you
more than $40,000 over a year or so.
Consider a part-time job as another means for establishing fertility coverage.
Some companies offer insurance to part-time (20 or more hours a week)
employees — insurance that may cover fertility treatments.
For a listing of major companies that offer infertility coverage (of some sort),
visit http://www.inciid.org/article.php?cat=benefits&id=243.
You still need to confirm this information with the organization (after you get
the job, that is!) to determine the specifics of the plan. And remember, most
companies have a waiting period, which could last from 30 days to one year,
prior to the time when you are eligible for insurance. So don’t cancel your old
policy until/unless you know that your new policy kicks in. Going from one
group insurance plan to another gives you an automatic acceptance regardless
of pre-existing conditions. You don’t want to get caught with a lapse in cover-
age, however. Not only is that a precarious situation for your health and your
finances, but it could also affect what your new insurance will or will not cover.
Before you throw away your law career or consider moonlighting, you may
want to check out any other insurance your company may offer. Some com-
panies offer a choice of plans. You may pay more for a plan that covers infer-
tility, but the savings may be worth the extra cost.
Some companies allow you to change insurance only at certain times of the
year; this is usually called open season. Check out your choices ahead of time
so that you can have your insurance in place before you need to start using it.
Getting coverage from professional 
associations
So your insurance company won’t give an inch, and the option of a new or
second job is just not an option at all. Is it over? Maybe not.
223
Chapter 14: Welcome to the Big Time: In Vitro Fertilization

That flier inviting you to your industry association dinner may come in handy
after all. Many organizations have professional associations that offer open
enrollment programs for insurance, meaning that if you’re a member (you
pay the monthly dues), you can’t be turned down for insurance. Because
these associations generally boast large memberships, you benefit from
group coverage, which may include some of the extras not found in smaller
companies or individual plans. You can start by checking out associations
within your profession.
Long-time resources for the self-employed, who often have trouble getting
coverage of any kind, professional and trade organizations are a popular way
to cover yourself. Associations can be found in almost any field, particularly
those that tend toward the self-employed or those underrepresented in busi-
ness. Examples include the National Writers Union, Graphic Artists Guild,
Public Relations Society of America, American Marketing Association, and
Women in Communications. Often, you must be a member for a period of
time before you can enroll in an insurance program. Sometimes, the insur-
ance policy may have a one-year preexisting condition rider as well.
The type of insurance available to you will also depend upon where you live,
even if you are part of an association or professional group. Typically, the tri-
state area of New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania tends to offer more
plans for freelancers and the self-employed. These plans are not necessarily
available for those that live outside of the area.

Part IV: Moving Up to High-Tech Conception 
States are in charge — for now
No federal mandate for insurance coverage
for infertility treatment exists at this time,
although a few bills were sent to Congress in
2002. When you consider that the federal gov-
ernment has spent years arguing over general
health care coverage for U.S. citizens, one can
only imagine how bogged down a specific cov-
erage for infertility treatment would become in
Washington.
For now, it’s up to individual states to pass and
enforce infertility coverage. States can force
employers to cover treatment in two different
ways:
 They can mandate companies to cover
infertility treatment.
 They can mandate that employers offer
coverage.
If your employer is only mandated to offer cov-
erage, you’ll usually have to pay extra for the
coverage, in the form of a rider, or extra policy,
attached to your main insurance coverage.

Touring the States That Mandate 
Fertility Coverage
As of this writing, 15 states mandate some sort of reimbursement for in vitro
fertilization. No consensus exists between states on how coverage should be
applied or who has to offer it. This coverage is still a mixed bag for the aver-
age patient; even if your state mandates insurance coverage, your employer
may be exempt from offering coverage if he meets certain requirements listed
below.
States that currently have some infertility coverage mandates are Arkansas,
California, Connecticut, Hawaii, Illinois, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts,
Montana, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Rhode Island, Texas, and West Virginia. 
Remember, state mandates affect the states where your employer/corporation
reside. So, even if you are a sales representative living in a covered state, if
your employer is based out of a noncovered state, your insurance will reflect
the laws of your employer’s domicile, not yours. The opposite applies as well.
You may live/work in a state that is not mandated but your company head-
quarters are in a state that is. Don’t just assume. That’s what human resource
departments are for!
Here are the state requirements:
 Arkansas: Requires coverage for infertility, including IVF up to a lifetime
cap of $15,000.
 California: Employers must make available a policy covering infertility
treatment, excluding IVF but covering gamete intrafallopian transfer
(GIFT), a type of IVF in which the egg and sperm are placed in the fallop-
ian tube before fertilization takes place. This avoids the religious/ethical
difficulty of having embryos in the lab, but adds a laparoscopy to the
mix, which adds cost and invasiveness to the procedure.
 Connecticut: Must offer a policy covering infertility, including IVF.
 Hawaii: Requires coverage, including one cycle of IVF.
 Illinois: Requires coverage of diagnosis and treatment of up to six IVF
cycles. Employers with fewer than 25 employees are exempt.
 Maryland: Requires coverage for IVF after certain conditions are met;
HMOs and companies with fewer than 50 employees are excluded.
225
Chapter 14: Welcome to the Big Time: In Vitro Fertilization

 Massachusetts: Requires comprehensive coverage.
 Montana: Requires HMOs to cover infertility as part of “preventive care.”
 New Jersey: Requires coverage, including IVF.
 New York: Requires coverage of diagnosis and treatment as part of a
correctable medical condition.
 Ohio: Requires HMOs to cover infertility under “preventive care.”
 Rhode Island: Requires comprehensive coverage but allows a 20 per-
cent co-pay for consumers.
 Texas: Requires certain insurers to offer coverage for IVF only.
 West Virginia: Requires HMOs to cover infertility costs.
Some states exempt HMOs from mandated coverage. Some states make
HMOs cover infertility treatment. Some states cover everything except IVF;
others cover IVF but not medications.
After you get past what is and isn’t covered, in some states your employer
can refuse to pay for infertility treatments if:
 The company has fewer than 50 employees.
 The company doesn’t cover maternity care.
 You haven’t done at least several cycles of intrauterine insemination
(IUI) before moving to IVF.
 You’ve had a vasectomy or tubal ligation.
 You’re over a certain age.
 You haven’t had two years of documented infertility.
If you are still unsure of your state’s policy, you can always contact your local
RESOLVE chapter (www.resolve.org) to find the information for your area. 
State mandates are always an issue under consideration in the legislature. If
you are feeling particularly motivated or vocal in trying to get your state cov-
ered for infertility, contact your local RESOLVE chapter. They are generally on
the front lines when it comes to advocacy in this area. They can let you know
“what’s on the table” and how you can help.
226
Part IV: Moving Up to High-Tech Conception 

Fighting City Hall: Insurance Appeals
Insurance appeals need to attack one of the three basic reasons insurance
companies give for not covering infertility treatments:
 Infertility is not an illness.
 Infertility treatments are not medically necessary.
 Infertility treatments are experimental.
You need to address one of these issues to win your claim. In some cases, your
doctor may write a letter of “medical necessity” for some of your treatment.
A policy with vague wording may be easier to appeal than coverage that
specifically excludes infertility treatment. 
Take it up the ladder. Don’t just settle for a “No” from the first person who
gives it, particularly if you feel that there is a legitimate “Yes” that should
apply instead. Generally, decisions or reversals get made at a higher level.
Keep asking for a supervisor’s name (and their supervisor, and their supervi-
sor, and so on). If you’re going to get turned down, put up a good fight and
besides, you just might win after all!
When Having Insurance Doesn’t Help
You can have the world’s most comprehensive infertility insurance that can
end up being worth nothing to you if your clinic is not on the preferred
provider list. This is why the best kind of insurance is the type that pays a
certain amount, regardless of where you go. Why would a clinic choose not to
contract with an insurance company? For one thing, the amount the insur-
ance offers isn’t enough, in the eyes of the clinic. Clinics that won’t take
insurance are usually the “Mecca” types; they’re the best, they know it, and
they don’t see why they should accept the typically low payment that your
insurance offers. But there are other reasons. Insurance contracts are convo-
luted, may require the doctors to fill out special forms, and the insurance
company may refuse to pay for a given treatment because some procedure
was not followed correctly. Because the contract is between the clinic and
the insurance company, this is not your problem, but it may be a serious
enough problem for the clinic to cancel that particular insurance contract. 
227
Chapter 14: Welcome to the Big Time: In Vitro Fertilization

Some clinics take your insurance amount but require you to pay the rest of
the bill out of pocket. If a clinic is a preferred provider for that insurance, it’s
generally required to accept the amount offered as payment in full. If a clinic
doesn’t want to accept the amount offered, which is usually quite a bit below
what most clinics charge for high-tech treatments (such as IVF), it may simply
refuse to take the insurance at all. But this is not allowed if the clinic is on the
preferred provider list! So double-check the list and contact the insurance
company if you see the clinic there.
Getting Creative When You’re 
Out of Other Options
If you don’t have insurance or if your insurance doesn’t pay anything toward
IVF treatment, you may need to get creative. There are ways to have your IVF
cycle paid for if you meet certain requirements and are in the right place at
the right time!
Donating eggs to reduce costs
A few clinics have innovative donor egg programs that let you donate half
your eggs to another couple in return for treatment. The recipient of your
eggs pays for your medications and your IVF retrieval and transfer. You need
to pay for your own pretesting (such as infectious blood work and a hysteros-
alpingogram), blood and ultrasound testing, and the cost of freezing any
excess embryos you have.
Usually you must meet certain requirements to be an egg donor. Generally,
you must be under 35 years old and have a normal follicle-stimulating hor-
mone (FSH) level. Usually a donor list is sent out every month or so by the
clinic, and you need to be picked by a recipient to be able to do a retrieval
cycle. The donors and recipients need to be matched ahead of time so that
their cycles can be synchronized, thereby ensuring that both the donor and
the recipient can have a fresh embryo transfer.
Your chances of getting picked are highest if you meet the following 
requirements:
 You’re young, preferably under 30: The younger you are, the better the
chance that you’ll make a lot of eggs.
 You’re of normal weight and height: Overweight donors aren’t usually
a first choice. Recipients may worry that obesity is hereditary and also
228
Part IV: Moving Up to High-Tech Conception 

may be concerned that they may have infertility problems, such as poly-
cystic ovaries, a condition in which many eggs are made but the egg
quality may be lower than normal.
Very short donors may also not be picked as quickly because, given a
choice, more people choose to have a taller donor (and hopefully taller
children).
 You have proven fertility: If you have children already, you’re more
likely to be picked as a donor.
 You have a male-factor issue: If your only fertility issue is male factor,
you may be picked because you don’t have any fertility issues yourself.
 You have a good family background: You have lots of brothers and sis-
ters with lots of children, no genetic diseases, and no mental illnesses.
These factors make you a prime candidate.
Everyone has some problem in her background — after all, our grand-
parents had to die of something. So if your grandfather died of cancer at
85, that’s not likely to be a deterrent to getting picked. If your mom died
at 40 from breast cancer, you may have more problems being selected.
 You’re a nonsmoker: Evidence exists that smoking can damage eggs,
plus nonsmokers are perceived as healthier people who take better care
of themselves.
Egg recipients are often looking for someone whose blood type matches
theirs and who has certain physical characteristics or racial background, so
you may be selected faster if you have what a lot of people are looking for: a
common blood type, or a rare one if someone on the list is looking for that.
Your savings as a donor could equal between $8,000 and $12,000, but you
need to be comfortable with the idea that your genetic child could be grow-
ing up with another family, or that the recipient could get pregnant with your
egg and you may not. Only you can say whether you can accept the emo-
tional repercussions of donating eggs to another couple.
Some women say that they don’t feel a genetic connection because their egg
isn’t being fertilized with their partner’s sperm, so the child created isn’t the
same as the offspring from their own relationship. Other women become very
angry when their recipients get pregnant and they don’t. This is another one
of those times where “know thyself” is of the utmost importance.
229
Chapter 14: Welcome to the Big Time: In Vitro Fertilization

Joining a drug study
Some doctors’ offices are well connected to certain drug companies and do
frequent drug studies for compensation. The compensation may be made to
the office as well as the patient. Patients may receive anything from a free
cycle of medication to an entire paid IVF cycle, including blood work, ultra-
sounds, and egg retrieval costs.
Some studies have very specific requirements for age, weight, and infertility
problem. Others are less strict with their requirements and let the clinic
select patients whom they feel are suitable.
In most studies, a new drug not yet approved by the FDA is being tested. If
you sign up for the study, you need to understand that you may get fewer
eggs or less fertilization than you would from proven drugs. Most studies
require that you sign a document stating this. You may also have to keep a
journal of all side effects and have frequent interviews with the person run-
ning the study.
Centers selected to run drug studies are usually the larger centers, so you
may want to check and see whether the clinics you’re considering ever par-
ticipate in drug studies.
Scoring freebies from the drug companies
With the growth of the infertility industry and the volume that the participat-
ing drug companies realize, some have taken an extra step to help educate
and even finance their clients’ efforts.
Serono, Ferring and Organon, three of the larger infertility drug companies,
have started services manned by health professionals to answer basic ques-
tions on infertility (but don’t expect them to give you recommendations on
your particular protocol, lay odds on your success, or adjust your meds!).
Another interesting facet of these services is the financial aid that they have
developed by donating cycle medicines to patients who are in need and have
limited resources to pay for the drugs that they require. This “scholarship
program” is run on a case-by-case basis and you must contact the company
directly to find out the requirements and how to apply. Be aware that you
may need to show proof of income such as an income tax return, which may
be more information than you want to have to supply.
230
Part IV: Moving Up to High-Tech Conception 

Shopping for “sales” 
Clinics and drug companies can also be helpful when financing IVF is an
issue. The following deals may appeal to you!
Going for the money-back guarantee
Some clinics try to overcome resistance to the high cost of IVF by offering a
money-back guarantee. This offer sounds good, but it does have a few catches.
Some centers call these “shared risk” programs. The specifics vary, but usu-
ally you pay an upfront fee, such as $15,000, for three or four IVF cycles. If
you get pregnant in any one of the cycles, the clinic keeps all your money. If
you don’t get pregnant at the end of the last cycle, you get your money back
(or at least a large part of it). You must pay extra charges for intracytoplas-
mic sperm injection (ICSI) or using an egg donor or gestational carrier.
Patients must meet certain requirements for acceptance into the programs;
usually you must be under a certain age and have a normal uterine cavity and
normal baseline blood test results.
Are these programs a good deal? That depends. Obviously they try to hedge
their bets somewhat by selecting patients they feel have a good chance of
success. If you get pregnant on the fourth try, you’ll have gotten a good price
per try. If you get pregnant on the first try, you’ll have spent a great deal of
money for one cycle, far more than you needed to. But if you get pregnant on
the first try, will you care about the cost? Only you know the answer.
If you’re able to look at a pregnancy on your first try as an incredible blessing
and not count the cost, this program may be for you. After two cycles, the
clinic begins to break even on you, so if you get pregnant on the fourth cycle,
this is a good deal for you financially.
Taking ‘em up on a twofer
Other clinics advertise a “twofer” deal, offering two cycles for the price of
one for a limited time when they open a new office. As long as the office is a
reputable one, you have nothing to lose by signing up for this offer. If the
clinic doesn’t have a proven track record or a good success rate, you may not
be getting a good deal no matter how many free cycles it gives you.
ASRM (the American Society for Reproductive Medicine) has supported
shared risk programs as a way to decrease costs to patients if they don’t get
pregnant. If you do get pregnant on the first try, you’re basically subsidizing
other people’s third and fourth tries.
231
Chapter 14: Welcome to the Big Time: In Vitro Fertilization

Ask your doctor whether his or her practice offers this type of quantity dis-
count (or any discount at all for that matter). For specific information on 
networks of physicians who offer this type of pricing, visit your local search
engine on the Internet. One such organization is www.arcfertility.com,
but other such networks are available as well.
Going overseas for IVF
As you may have heard, the term medical tourism now describes a new type
of travel, one that can certainly benefit those pursuing lower cost infertility
treatments.
South Africa, South America, Mexico, and certain parts of Europe have infer-
tility programs that provide higher tech options such as IVF and Donor Egg at
lower prices, with some clinics quoting IVF cycles under $10,000, inclusive of
travel, and Donor Egg cycles under $15,000, inclusive of travel. Before you
rush to make your reservations or shudder at the thought of a back alley
operation, keep a few things in mind:
 While not FDA regulated, most countries have their own federal board of
standards that require that certain conditions be met to insure safety
and efficacy. When researching a clinic abroad, you might want to
directly contact one of the regulatory agencies in the region. South
Africa has SASRSS (South African Society of Reproductive Science and
Surgery) and the South African Department of Health; European coun-
tries may be regulated by ESHRE (European Society of Human Repro-
duction and Embryology. If you’re not sure what agency to contact, start
with the country/government Board of Health. You can also contact the
local docs at ASRM (American Society of Reproductive Medicine) to get
the latest on which countries or clinics are the best regulated. 
 For donor egg programs, you want to be assured that the donors are
being screened for Infectious Diseases and/or Sexually Transmitted
Diseases as well as basic genetic mutations.
Make sure that the price(s) that you are being quoted are inclusive of all nec-
essary medical services. Is anesthesia extra? You might want to know. Some
programs include the price of air travel in their package. Make sure to find
out what the travel arrangements are and that they meet your needs. 
Lastly, take some time to enjoy the scenery! One of the benefits of “infertility
tourism” is the tourism part. Ask the clinic to recommend good hotels and/or
activities that you might enjoy.

Let the IVF Cycle Begin!
In This Chapter
 Experiencing an in vitro fertilization cycle
 Injecting gonadotropins

 Getting answers to common questions
I
n vitro fertilization (IVF) is the high-tech method of getting pregnant.
During an IVF cycle, you take stimulating hormone medications called
gonadotropins so that your ovaries are willing to make more than one or two
eggs. Then you go through an egg retrieval, a minor surgery to take the eggs
out of the follicles in which they grow. After that, the eggs are fertilized in the
lab and then put back into your uterus so they can grow.
The treatment sounds complicated, and it is — but not so complicated that
you can’t understand the basic idea and walk into your clinic confident that
you know what to expect.
So, if you’ve sent in your payment for in vitro after hassling with the billing
office a few times, gasped at the hole left in your wallet, spent days on the
phone arguing with your insurance company, bought all your medications,
and gasped again at the cost, you’re ready to start an IVF cycle. In this chap-
ter, we discuss how to get through an IVF cycle with the least amount of frus-
tration, explore what egg retrieval involves, and explain how your best friend’s
cycle may be completely different from yours and why you shouldn’t worry
about it.

Starting an IVF Cycle: A Roller 
Coaster Ride of Emotions
In vitro fertilization is a complicated process. It involves injecting potent
medications with possibly serious side effects for several weeks, taking time
out of your schedule to have blood work and ultrasounds done, and undergo-
ing surgery, albeit minor, to retrieve your eggs. And that’s just the beginning!
Every step of the way through IVF is crucial, and every day brings news that
will either thrill you or bring you to your knees in despair. Is it any wonder
that you’re feeling scared?
Experiencing the emotional ride
Even though you’re scared to death, you’re also excited. You’ve probably
been through a lot to get here, you’ve spent buckets of money, and you have
high hopes that high tech will not fail you.
Behind the excitement may be depression. This is where you’ve ended up.
You’ve tried all the simpler methods of conception, and they failed. This is
your last shot, and it may seem that there’s nowhere to go from here. Before
you got to IVF, you always knew you had one last thing to try. Now you’re
trying IVF, and if it fails, you don’t know what you’ll do next.
From the emotional side, rely on that support network that you’ve been
building. Many women on chat room sites, in Resolve meetings, and in mind-
and-body classes find “cycle buddies,” literally other women going through
IVF (or any of the lower-tech measures) at the same time. (For more details
about Resolve, turn to Chapter 8.) You may find comfort in sharing your
experiences, good and bad, with someone else who is going through the
same thing at the same time. Remember, though, to share and not compare!
You’re not in competition with anyone. You’re trying to have your baby.
And try to get your partner to read this chapter, because he’s going to be
bewildered by the roller coaster ride. Your partner is experiencing much of
the IVF process secondhand (with your “hand” being the first line of defense).
You’re the one dealing directly with the physical discomfort, the scheduling
madness, and the emotional ups and downs, so your partner will likely relate
to the experience much differently than you do.
234
Part IV: Moving Up to High-Tech Conception 

Looking at your protocol
When you first sit across the desk from an in vitro fertilization specialist, 
you may come to think of him as Dr. Magic. He’ll probably give you a stack 
of totally incomprehensible papers that you’ll promptly file in your fertility
notebook — you know, the notebook that every patient seems to carry around
with her. One of those undecipherable papers is probably your protocol. A
protocol is nothing more than a blueprint or schedule of how your cycle will
be done. It includes the medications you’ll be taking, instructions on how to
take them, and the procedures you need to follow throughout the cycle.
Dr. Magic may review your protocol with you, or he may mumble something
about the IVF nurses going over the protocol with you. If he reviews it that
day, you’ll probably be too excited, nervous, or scared to remember exactly
what he says. Patients have described to co-author Sharon protocols that
they swear the doctor gave them that resembled no IVF protocol on the face
of this earth.
Reading your protocol
So it’s time to take out your protocol. Step Number 1: Read the protocol. You
would think this would go without saying, but it doesn’t. Read the protocol!
Now, your cousin Mary out in Duluth may be going through IVF too, so you
call her up and start comparing your protocols. Even though you’re only four
months apart in age, and everyone says you’re more like sisters than cousins,
you have two completely different protocols! How can this be? Has one of
your doctors made a mistake?
Relax. Doctors rely on a few standard IVF protocols (we list them in Table 15-1),
and most doctors prefer to use one over the other. Here are some possibilities:
 If you’re under 35 and your baseline hormone levels are normal, your
doctor could choose to start you on a down regulation cycle, starting
leuprolide acetate (which has the brand name Lupron) a few days after
you ovulate. (Some clinics like to start birth control pills on the third
day of your menses, and then overlap the pill with the Lupron shots; this
takes a little longer but you avoid having to monitor your ovulation.)
Lupron shuts down your normal hormone receptors and encourages the
growth of many follicles instead of one or two. The drug also keeps you
from ovulating before retrieval. You start your hormone-stimulating
drugs when your period starts. Some centers call this a “long Lupron”
cycle, and others call it a “down regulation” cycle. Lupron is a GnRH
(gonadotropin-releasing hormone) agonist; it shuts down your normal
growth of one dominant follicle by suppressing your pituitary gland.
235
Chapter 15: Let the IVF Cycle Begin!

Instead of stimulating a dominant follicle, like you would normally do,
Lupron allows multiple follicles to develop at the same time.
 Your doctor may prefer to use a drug called ganirelix, a GnRH antagonist
(with the brand name Antagon), or cetrorelix (with the brand name
Cetrotide) in conjunction with follicle-stimulating medications; this drug
also suppresses your LH surge so you won’t ovulate before your egg
retrieval. (The difference between the GnRH agonists and the antago-
nists is that the agonist must be started sometime before ovulation
would normally happen in order to prevent its occurrence, whereas the
antagonists work right away and prevent ovulation on the same day that
they are given.)
 If you’re over 35, many centers use a modified Lupron protocol, some-
times called a “stop Lupron” cycle because you take Lupron for just ten
days following ovulation and then stop when you start your stimulating
medications. This protocol is to decrease the suppressing effects of
Lupron, which can be detrimental to those over 35 or women who are
known to produce fewer eggs. Some doctors may administer a GnRH
antagonist prior to ovulation to make doubly sure the patient doesn’t
ovulate prematurely. Or you may be given a “microdose Lupron” proto-
col, in which Lupron is diluted in normal saline so that only a minute
amount is given each day; this protocol is used for women who didn’t
stimulate well in a previous cycle or those who have an FSH (follicle-
stimulating hormone) level above normal (10.5 to 15, depending on your
lab’s values). In this case, the Lupron is used for its stimulatory properties,
as opposed to its suppressive properties (as in the long Lupron protocol).
 You could also be doing a natural protocol, with very little or no medica-
tion. This protocol isn’t common, but it’s used in women who can’t toler-
ate large doses of stimulating medication due to age or previous illness,
such as breast cancer.
In addition, your doctor will prescribe gonadotropins, or follicle-stimulating
medications, usually taken twice a day, although some centers give only one
daily injection. Recombinant or highly purified drugs, are typically more expen-
sive but are able to be injected subcutaneously, which means they’re given
with a very tiny needle. (Follistim, Menopur, Bravelle, and Gonal-F are exam-
ples of such drugs.) Some, like Follistim, Gonal-F, or Bravelle are nearly pure
FSH, without any luteinizing hormone (LH) in them. Menopur is the only
highly purified medication that contains equal doses of FSH and LH. Older
gonadotropins, such as Repronex, are made from purified urine from post-
menopausal women; they need to be given intramuscularly, with a longer
needle, because they’re more likely to cause irritation to the tissues. They’re
equal parts LH and FSH. They’re usually (although not always!) cheaper than
the recombinant or highly purified medications. 
236
Part IV: Moving Up to High-Tech Conception 

Your doctor will prescribe the protocol and medications he feels most 
comfortable using for your particular case. Try not to compare what you’re
getting to what anyone else is using. Birth control pills may be used in associ-
ation with any of these protocols to help cycle scheduling or to suppress the
occasional ovarian cyst. The duration of birth control pill treatment is quite
variable and is not included in the table.

Reviewing your protocol
After you’ve read your protocol over a few times, you’re ready to call the
doctor’s office to discuss it and make sure that you understand it. Some offices
have an orientation class for IVF patients to review protocols and policies. Some
centers make attendance mandatory for their patients. Other centers schedule
injection instruction sessions for you and your partner to review your medica-
tions and show you how to inject them. Having your partner inject medications
is one of the scariest parts of IVF — for you and for your partner. Make sure
that you get very clear instructions on how to do this. 
237
Chapter 15: Let the IVF Cycle Begin!

If your IVF center is large, nurses probably take care of only IVF patients. If
your program is smaller, the nursing staff may take care of both non-IVF and
IVF patients. Some programs have only one IVF nurse with whom you deal
throughout your cycle; others have so many nurses you can’t tell who’s who
without a scorecard!
Try to figure out how your center works and to whom you should be talking
before your cycle starts. In many centers, the IVF nurses draw blood and also
do your ultrasounds; larger centers have a separate staff that draws blood
and ultrasonographers who do the ultrasounds. Make sure that you talk to
the right person when you have a problem or need help.
Following the trend toward less medication
Some doctors are advocating using less stimulating drugs and developing
(doctors may use the word “recruiting”) fewer follicles. The reason for using
a low stimulation protocol may include the following:
 Less cost to the patient
 Less risk of hyperstimulation, or OHSS (see “Avoiding the risks of 
hyperstimulation”)
 Possibility of recruiting better eggs (some doctors feel that hyperstimu-
lation can be bad for eggs)
 Less chance of producing more embryos than you can ever use, along
with the ethical considerations that accompany an overabundance of
embryos
Dealing with a disappearing doctor
After your initial consult appointment, you may wonder where your doctor
went. In smaller centers, doctors may do callbacks with your blood results;
some also do their own ultrasounds. In larger centers, you may feel as though
your doctor has vanished from the face of the earth because all your instruc-
tions come from the nurses. This system of patient communication can be
upsetting if you came to a center specifically to deal with a particular doctor.
Rest assured that your doctor is reviewing your callbacks and instructing the
nurses on what you should do next, but in bigger centers, doctors simply
don’t have the time to do more than 50 callbacks a night. Some centers have
even gone to a system where you don’t talk to anybody: Your instructions are
left on a message tape you can access.
238
Part IV: Moving Up to High-Tech Conception 

If your center has more than one doctor doing IVF procedures, you may also
feel like you’ve lost the doctor you came to see. Many centers rotate doctors
through IVF on a one- or two-week cycle; you may never see the doctor with
whom you had your consultation again! Sometimes you can request that a
certain doctor do your procedure, but granting that request may not always
be possible. Your doctor may be doing outside surgery or seeing patients for
new appointments the week of your retrieval.
The doctor you saw on your initial visit to the clinic may not be the doctor
who is managing your IVF procedure. Try to find out what your center’s policy
is for scheduling doctors and whether you can request the doctor of your
choice.
Taking your medications without 
having a nervous breakdown
Suppose that you had your injection class a week ago, and on this beautiful
bright Sunday morning, you’re ready to begin taking your medications. Your
partner, with shaking hands, opens the first vial to mix your first injection.
“No, no!” you scream, as he proceeds to draw up the liquid. “That’s not how
she said to mix it!” He stops, and both of you stare dumbfounded at the boxes,
the needles, and each other. In one week you’ve forgotten every word the
nurse said. You look at the film you were given on giving injections again,
read the colorful pieces of paper that tell you how to mix and inject, and still
feel confused, scared, and totally out of control. And it’s a Sunday. What on
earth are you going to do?
Being confused: Par for the course
First, take a deep breath. Of course, giving yourself injections is hard to do.
Do you think doctors and nurses were born knowing how to mix and inject
medications? Most people are scared the first time they give a shot or mix a
medication. Your reaction is normal.
Second, call your center. Some centers do IVF procedures on weekends, and
if yours does, you may be able to talk to someone who can talk you through
the mixing and injection.
If no one is there, you can call the answering service and ask for the doctor
on call, who may be annoyed but can at least give you some guidance. Some
centers also have nurses who carry beepers so they can answer questions
when the office is closed. If you got your medications from a large mail-order
pharmacy, it may have a nurse on call who can also give you instructions.
239
Chapter 15: Let the IVF Cycle Begin!

Call the main number and ask. Remember that medication confusion (dosing,
mixing, injecting) are considered bona fide “emergencies” at a fertility center.
Do not hesitate to call! Or maybe you never got to know the doctor or nurse
who lives next door? Now might be as good a time as any to strike up an
acquaintance! Such a person is likely to be more adept than you at handling 
a needle and walking you through your first shot.
If you can’t get anyone, take a little break, compose yourself, and then go
back and try again. The procedure probably won’t look quite as overwhelm-
ing the second time.
Monitoring your progress (more 
poking and prodding)
After a few days of injections, you’ll start to feel like a pro, your partner will
have his injection techniques down pat, and your protocol will start to make
sense to you. It’s time to find out how well this is working. It’s time to have
blood drawn and do an ultrasound.
Most centers monitor you every few days to see how you’re responding to
the medication. If your follicles are growing nicely and your estradiol is
rising, your medications will probably not be changed. If you’re stimulating
too well, or not stimulating well enough, your medications may be decreased
or increased.
Avoiding the risks of hyperstimulation
Stimulating too well can be another example of too much of a good thing. The
goal of IVF is to have a number of follicles grow so that more than one egg can
be retrieved. This result will, it is hoped, prevent you from having to do multi-
ple cycles of IVF to get pregnant, because your extra embryos may possibly 
be frozen and used later if you don’t get pregnant on your first try. With some
women, especially those who have polycystic ovaries (see Chapter 6 for more
about this condition), hyperstimulation can get way out of hand very quickly. If
your estradiol rises too fast, or if you make too many follicles — 20 or more —
you run a risk of developing OHSS, or ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome.
Patients with OHSS can be very ill after egg retrieval, with fluid buildup in the
pelvis and around the lungs. Some women become sick enough to require hos-
pitalization. In the past, a few patients have even died from severe OHSS, which
causes fluid volume shifts through your whole body and can make your blood
very thick and prone to clotting.
240
Part IV: Moving Up to High-Tech Conception 

Because OHSS is so potentially serious, most centers watch patients on stim-
ulating medications quite closely, monitoring their blood and ultrasound
results every few days. If your clinic thinks that you’re in danger of severe
OHSS, you may have to freeze all your embryos after retrieval and not do an
embryo transfer. OHSS becomes worse if you become pregnant, due to the
rising hormone levels from the pregnancy. Some centers may not do egg
retrieval at all, and simply cancel the cycle, because the hCG trigger given
before retrieval also makes OHSS worsen.
On the other hand, you may not be stimulating well, and your clinic may be
increasing your medication to see whether you can do better. This situation
also requires closer monitoring because your medications may require fre-
quent adjustment. See Table 15-2 for a typical IVF stimulation cycle, but
remember that your cycle may vary.
As a rough guide, you’ll probably be on stimulating hormones ten days before
you’re given hCG to mature the follicle for your retrieval. During those ten
days, you’ll probably have blood work and ultrasounds done four times, or
maybe more or less depending on your circumstances. Some centers insist
that all your blood work and ultrasounds be done at their facility; others allow
patients to be monitored at outside facilities closer to their homes. You need
to find a place capable of doing same-day reports and willing to fax results to
your clinic.

Waiting for the phone to ring . . . 
again and again
The phone rings at 4 p.m., and you grab it off the hook. “Hi, this is Nancy
Nurse,” chirps the voice on the other end. Your whole world stops for a
second, as you try to decipher from the tone of her voice whether she has
good news or bad news.
Setting up your callback
Blood and ultrasound callbacks consume a huge part of your life after you
start IVF. You find yourself leaving whole volumes of information on how to
reach you that day (cell phone, home phone, don’t leave a message with the
babysitter, partner’s number, don’t call before 6, don’t call after 6, don’t leave
a message, I really need to talk to you) on your callback sheets, because this
call, whether good or bad news, is the highlight of your day.
If your clinic has a lot of staff, try to cultivate a good relationship with one or
two nurses with whom you feel comfortable. It doesn’t hurt to ask to speak
with that nurse when you call. Most nurses are happy to call you if you per-
sonally ask for them. Also, if you get to know one or two people well, you
won’t have to explain all the ins and outs of your case every time you call in.
242
Part IV: Moving Up to High-Tech Conception 

You may find it easiest to have the clinic call you on your cell phone, and
some clinics prefer that you give them your cell number as your primary
source of contact. That way, you can have it with you at all times and don’t
have to feel tethered to the office phone, home phone, and so on. And what if
you have to go to the bathroom!
Knowing what to do if you don’t get along with the nurse
What if the clinic has only one nurse and you just don’t get along? Try to
make it easier for both of you. Maybe you can ask for the doctor to call you; if
your personality really clashes with the nurse’s, the doctor may be willing to
handle your calls. If you have to get your calls from someone with whom
you’re not happy, ask the nurse to leave your instructions on your answering
machine so that you don’t have to talk to her on the phone. Or you may want
to fax in your list of questions so that the nurse can write the answers on it
and fax it back. That way, you get the answers you need with a minimum of
aggravation.
Sometimes you can just feel it — you’ve become an annoyance to the nurses.
You picture the nurses throwing the phone to each other when you call, in a
version of patient hot potato. You feel terrible about this. Everyone wants to
be liked, and every patient also wants her questions answered without feel-
ing like a pest.
If you’re getting bad vibes, you may want to try to clear the air with the staff.
Explain politely (not at callback time, when everyone is busy) why you feel
things are strained, and encourage some open communication about how
you can best work together. Everyone benefits if the communication between
you and the staff is good, and unfortunately you’re the one who will suffer the
most if you don’t get along with the rest of the team.
Feeling like everyone in the waiting 
room is doing better than you
There you are in the waiting room, listening to the person ahead of you brag
about how well her cycle is going, how she’s got 20 beautiful follicles, how
good her partner is at giving shots, how she loves the nurses so much she’s
making them each a ceramic something to say thank you, how great her veins
are, and how happy she is to be alive. You look at your poor black and blue
arms and think about how you have only seven follicles on ultrasound, how
your partner seems to hit a nerve every other day, how much you hate all the
nurses, and how much you hate this whole process.
243
Chapter 15: Let the IVF Cycle Begin!

In some centers, the waiting room is like group therapy in a psychiatrist’s
office: All the patients pull their chairs together while waiting for their ultra-
sound appointments and talk about IVF and life in general. This kind of place
can provide you with new friends who know exactly what you’re going through,
but it can also turn into a sort of golf course with chairs — she got pregnant
on the first try, she has the most follicles, she’s doing better than she did last
cycle, she’s having twins, she’s having triplets.
Stay out of the comparison contests, if you can. Everyone responds differ-
ently to medications, and in the end, the person with three follicles may get
pregnant, and the person with twenty follicles may not. Remember that the
only statistics that matter are your own.
If talking to other people about your problems makes you feel worse, don’t
join in. Bring a book and headphones and put an unapproachable expression
on your face. Arrive as close to the time of your appointment as you can, get
engrossed in the TV, or hide in the bathroom!
On the other hand, if you can listen to other women’s tales and not compare
yourself to them, the waiting room can be a great source of camaraderie and
a place to make lasting friendships.
Why feeling blue is normal
We can’t stress enough that mood swings are normal with high hormone
levels. You may also experience a letdown feeling when doing an IVF cycle.
You’ve planned for it and fantasized about how things would go, and now it’s
almost over. It’s like Christmas: Sometimes the anticipation surpasses the
reality. When you’re almost ready for egg retrieval, you can’t change things.
It’s too late to say, “We should have waited another month” or “I should have
taken more meds, less meds, or different meds.”
Taking a Shot in the Dark: Time for hCG
It’s Nancy Nurse on the phone again, and this time you can tell that she’s got
really big news. “It’s time for hCG!” she says, and because she sounds so
excited, you feel like you should get out the pompoms and do a cheer. If
you’ve read your protocol, you know what hCG (human chorionic gonado-
tropin) is; if you haven’t, here’s a refresher course.
244
Part IV: Moving Up to High-Tech Conception 

Defining the role of hCG
HCG is a crucial part of your IVF cycle. HCG is given 32 to 36 hours before
your egg retrieval; its job is to mature your eggs and prepare them to be fer-
tilized. Giving hCG allows the IVF staff to plan egg retrievals for a reasonable
time during the day, instead of waiting for your natural LH surge to occur.
That’s why the timing of your hCG is very important.
Watching the clock: Timing 
is everything with hCG
The hCG instructions include a specific time to take your injection, and fol-
lowing the directions is absolutely critical because timing really is every-
thing. Your injection may be scheduled for midnight, or even a few hours
later, if your center has a lot of egg retrievals to do on one day.
If your injection is scheduled for, say, 2 a.m., you can mix the medication
ahead of time and put it on your bedside table; then set your alarm for the
time you need to take the hCG. Giving the injection at an odd hour is easier if
you don’t need to fumble around mixing medications when you’re half asleep.
If you normally have a doctor’s office, close friend, or neighbor do your injec-
tions, you may have a problem getting them to give hCG in the middle of the
night. Be aware ahead of time that you need to find someone willing to do
this when the time comes.
Going for the Gold: The Egg Retrieval
Almost before you know it, it’s time for your egg retrieval. All kinds of emo-
tions are probably churning around inside you and your partner. This is the
culmination of several weeks of injections, emotions, and worries. It’s your
big day! How do you feel?
If you know ahead of time about an event that may conflict with your egg
retrieval, tell your doctor about it before you start taking your stimulating
hormones. Sometimes an egg retrieval can be held off for a few days if you
take Lupron or birth control a few extra days before starting your stimulating
medications. After you start stimulating medications, influencing the day of
your retrieval is harder.
245
Chapter 15: Let the IVF Cycle Begin!

Looking at retrieval schedules
Some IVF centers do egg retrievals every day of the week. Others do
retrievals only Monday through Friday and start their patients’ medications
all at the same time to avoid the weekends. Still others cycle patients through
in batches, doing retrievals only every other month or a few months of the
year. You probably won’t have much say in what day or what time your
retrieval is done.
Signing here . . . and here . . . and here . . .
Some centers have you sign consent forms ahead of time for your egg
retrieval, but you may be asked to sign the day of the retrieval. Usually a
nurse reviews the consent forms with you. Keep in mind that your anxiety
level will be through the roof, and the chances that you’ll be able to read and
comprehend 18 pages of legalese the morning of your retrieval are slim. If
possible, ask for the consent forms ahead of time so that you have time to
read and understand what you’ll be signing.
Some centers let you make changes in the consent forms as long as they
know what the changes are ahead of time and can have a lawyer review your
changes. Here are the most common concerns that people have with IVF con-
sent forms:
 Having pictures taken of themselves, their eggs, sperm, or embryos, for
use in any type of publication. Many people have no objection to this,
but some do.
 Allowing medical, nursing, or other students in the room to watch the
procedure.
 Using any sperm, eggs, embryos, or tissue for research. “Tissue” can
mean fluid from follicles, endometrial tissue, or anything else removed
at the time of retrieval or transfer.
 Freezing of any embryos not transferred on a fresh transfer. Some
people have religious objections to embryo freezing, and they want to
inseminate only a few eggs, so that they can use up all their embryos
and not have any left to freeze. Discuss this step ahead of time with
embryology to make sure that everyone understands exactly what will
be done.
246
Part IV: Moving Up to High-Tech Conception 

If you have objections to anything in the consent forms, address them before
the morning of your egg retrieval. If your clinic has a problem with your
requests, it could delay or cancel your retrieval.
Meeting the retrieval team
A whole new group of unfamiliar people will be with you for the egg retrieval —
how wonderful. During the egg retrieval, a nurse or a medical assistant may
be in the room helping the doctor. An ultrasonographer may be present, and
the embryologist will be nearby. It is hoped, you’ll know the ultrasonogra-
phers and the nurse. With any luck, you’ll know the doctor, too, although, 
the doctor with whom you had an initial consultation may not do your egg
retrieval. The person in whom you may be most interested as you arrive in
the IVF area (which you probably have never seen before) is the person who
will give you the medication for your retrieval.
Previewing what happens 
in an egg retrieval
Different centers do things different ways, but in most centers, you’re taken
to the IVF suite, a part of the building you’ve never seen before and had no
idea existed. You’ll change into a gown, hat, and shoe covers because the IVF
suite is a sterile area where an attempt is made to keep outside germs from
entering.
An intravenous (IV) infusion is started. The purpose of the IV is mainly to
have access for giving you medication, but it’s also there in case any compli-
cations require you to be given large amounts of fluid quickly. If you know
that certain of your veins are better than others for the IV, don’t be shy about
informing the person starting your IV!
The embryologist usually comes in to see you before the procedure starts to
ask you to verify your name, Social Security number, and information about
your partner. The purpose of checking this information is to prevent any type
of mix-up with eggs, sperm, or embryos.
The doctor generally comes in the room at the last minute, introduces her-
self, one hopes, if you don’t already know her, and instructs the person giving
you medications to start giving them. The doctor inserts a speculum and
washes the vagina and cervix thoroughly, trying to keep the area as clean as
possible.
247
Chapter 15: Let the IVF Cycle Begin!

You won’t remember the rest, so we explain what happens next. The doctor
inserts the vaginal ultrasound probe into your vagina. On the top of the
probe is a needle guide, a plastic attachment which has a hollow narrow
tube-like guide along which a long metal needle slides. The doctor locates
your follicles on ultrasound with the probe and then punctures the back of
the vagina with the needle, entering each follicle and sucking out the fluid.
The follicular fluid is given to the embryologist, who examines it under a
microscope and says, it is hoped, “Egg one, egg two,” and so on. When the
follicles are all emptied, you’ll wake up and be taken to a nearby bed for a
short time to recover. An egg retrieval usually takes about 30 to 40 minutes
from start to finish, and you’ll be asleep the whole time.
Knocking you out: Anesthesia 
choices for the retrieval
IVF centers vary considerably in their methods of anesthesia for egg retrievals.
Some centers do all their retrievals in a hospital operating suite, so a nurse
anesthetist or an anesthesiologist (a doctor who specializes in giving anesthe-
sia) gives your medications. Smaller centers may have only an assistant or the
nurse giving medication under the guidance of your doctor. Still others offer you
a choice between conscious sedation and MAC, monitored anesthesia care.
With conscious sedation, you receive some version of medication in the
valium family, possibly Valium or Versed, and also some type of narcotic,
such as Demerol, fentanyl, or morphine. The degree to which you’re awake
during your procedure varies quite a bit between individuals. If you’ve taken
narcotics frequently in the past, you may develop a tolerance to them, and
they may not make you comfortable. Some women are much more sensitive
to all drugs and need very little medication to put them to sleep. Your vital
signs, including your heart rate, blood pressure, and respirations, are care-
fully monitored during your procedure.
If you have MAC, an anesthesiologist or a nurse anesthetist must give it to
you. Either of those professionals is qualified to give the medication propofol
(Diprivan is the brand name), which will put you in a deep sleep for your
retrieval.
Certain medications, such as Versed, have amnesiac properties, which is 
a fancy way of saying that you won’t remember what went on during the
retrieval. This effect lasts for a short time after the procedure as well. Nearly
every IVF patient wakes up after the procedure and asks, “How many eggs did
248
Part IV: Moving Up to High-Tech Conception 

I get?” at least three times before she’s actually awake enough to remember
the answer! You may not remember walking from the table to a bed, either, but
you did!
Doing His Duty: Your Partner 
Is Busy, Too
While you’re snoozing away in the IVF suite, your partner will be watching
the movies most centers helpfully provide to make it easier for him to mas-
turbate to produce a semen specimen. This can be a tricky issue for some
men and downright impossible for others. If you think that your partner is
going to suffer from performance anxiety on retrieval day, consider the fol-
lowing ways to take the pressure off:
 You can have him freeze a specimen ahead of time. Most centers prefer
to use fresh sperm, but if your partner knows a frozen backup is avail-
able, he may have an easier time in the producing room. And if he can’t,
the lab can use the frozen specimen; not as good as the fresh, but a
whole lot better than nothing!
 He can go to a nearby hotel, or home, if you live close enough — within
15 to 20 minutes away — use a sterile cup the andrologist will give him,
and produce there.
 You can help him produce. You may feel uncomfortable going in with
him, but believe us, it’s no big deal — people do it all the time. But
andrologists enforce two rules: no saliva and no lubricants. Either one
can mess up the semen specimen. Make sure the specimen goes directly
from the penis into the cup to maintain sterility as much as possible; no
collecting it in your hand or elsewhere!
Answering Common Post-IVF Questions
After a retrieval, almost everybody asks these questions:
 Can I see my eggs before I go home? You can’t see your eggs because
they can be seen only under a microscope, and no embryologist in the
world is going to let a patient still lurching around in an anesthesia daze
mess around with his extremely expensive microscope or those pre-
cious eggs!
249
Chapter 15: Let the IVF Cycle Begin!

 Why can’t my partner come back to the retrieval room? In some centers,
partners are allowed to be present at the egg retrieval. Other centers
don’t allow anyone else to be in the room for the retrieval, although
they’re often allowed in for the embryo transfer. Usually the rooms are
too small to allow extra people, and no one wants partners feeling woozy
in the retrieval room and knocking over the ultrasound equipment if
they fall.
 Do I have to have an IV? Yes.
 Are you sure you won’t mix up my eggs (or sperm or embryos) with
someone else’s? Yes.
Centers are anxious to reassure patients on this topic, since all centers
are very aware of the recent cases in the news and are being extremely
careful to avoid such an incidence.
Most centers label all dishes, collection cups, and so on with the patient’s
name, Social Security number, patient number, and sometimes a color
code. Egg retrievals and embryo transfers are done one at a time —
never two at the same time. Eggs and embryos go from labeled container
to labeled container. And catheters used for embryo transfer are never
reused, so someone else’s embryo won’t be stuck in your catheter!
After an embryo transfer, the catheter that was used is examined again
to make sure that none of your embryos decided to stay behind. All
those little guys should be in the uterus, where they belong!

T
he medical advances that enable IVF (in vitro fertilization) clinics to fertil-
ize eggs and grow embryos in a lab are a science but also an art. The
embryology team is skilled in working with the most precious of all biologic
material: the eggs, sperm, and embryos that have the potential to become
your child.
After you’ve completed the stimulation part of the IVF cycle and gone
through an egg retrieval, everything is in the hands of the members of the
embryology team. They’re the ones who check your eggs, ready the sperm
for fertilization, and keep those embryos growing until the day of transfer.
They’re the bearers of all good news and bad news, and you want to know
everything they’re doing.
In this chapter, we tell you what goes on in the lab, what the embryologists
want to see, and what they don’t want to see in eggs, sperm, and embryos. We
also review your instructions for transfer, explain why you’re taking certain
medications, and give some insight into how many embryos you may want to
transfer.

Recognizing a Good Egg 
When You See One
Before you go home after retrieval (see Chapter 15), embryology will look 
at your eggs and may let you know whether they’re mature, postmature, or
immature. Mature eggs are needed for fertilization to occur, but immature
eggs will often mature within 24 hours after retrieval. An egg retrieval may
yield eggs that are both mature and immature, especially if you made a lot 
of follicles. If your eggs are postmature, they may not fertilize. However, the
ability to judge eggs right after retrieval is somewhat limited by the fact that
eggs are surrounded by a layer of cumulus cells, which protect the egg during
ovulation, but limit the ability of the embryologist to see details about the
egg. They may not be able to tell you much about the eggs until the next day,
when the sperm have dispersed the cumulus layer.
A mature egg is surrounded by a fluffy cumulus layer that allows the embryol-
ogist to see through it and identify the outline of the egg. In contrast, imma-
ture eggs have a tight, dense cumulus that has not yet expanded, which makes
it very difficult to see the inner details of the egg. An immature egg still con-
tains 46 chromosomes because the immature egg has not yet thrown off half
of them, a step that’s necessary before fertilization can take place.
When hCG is given at the end of the IVF stimulation (or during the LH surge
in a natural cycle), the egg, still in the follicle for 36 hours before being col-
lected during an egg retrieval procedure, undergoes maturation. It separates
its chromosomes in a process called meiosis, and puts 23 of them into a small
cell fragment called a polar body. This is what makes an egg “mature,” mean-
ing fertilizable. An immature egg has not yet successfully put out its polar
body, but may do so during the next day or so in the laboratory, becoming
fertilizable at that point. 
Embryologists use the term, “Postmature eggs” to describe those that are
mature, but may be dark and grainy-looking. They tend not to fertilize, and
are sometimes associated with stimulations that go on too long; the embryol-
ogists say they are “overcooked.” But this may not be the real reason the
eggs don’t fertilize, and postmature eggs may just be eggs that weren’t meant
to be embryos.
If your partner’s sperm is normal, and your eggs are going to be fertilized in
the lab with normal insemination, the next steps will be:
 The sperm are washed and the egg is separated from the follicular fluid.
It still has its cumulus, which helps to activate the sperm.
 Your eggs (up to six to eight per dish) and sperm will be placed in a petri
dish, a flat-bottomed round glass or plastic dish, which will be labeled
with your name, lab number, the date, and the number of eggs in the dish. 
252
Part IV: Moving Up to High-Tech Conception 

 The dish is placed in an incubator so the eggs and sperm can be kept at
body temperature. They’re kept in a nutrient solution (culture medium),
which provides conditions as similar as possible to those in the body.
Different labs use different culture media, and this is one way that labs
differ from one another.
 Conventionally inseminated eggs are left alone for 16 to 20 hours. The
day after the retrieval, embryology takes the dish out of the incubator,
strips off the cumulus, (which has by now been greatly loosened by the
action of the sperm) and checks the eggs; what they hope to find is two
pronuclear (2PN) embryos, or embryos that have two visible circles lined
up next to each other (see Figure 16-1). These embryos contain the
genetic material from each parent.
If you’re planning to freeze some or all of your embryos for use at another
time, your clinic may freeze them at the 2PN stage. Some centers grow all
your embryos out to blastocyst stage and freeze only those that make it to
blastocyst.
Congratulations! You’ve got embryos!

Having atretic eggs
Atretic eggs are dead; they’re incapable of
being fertilized. What would cause eggs to
“die”? Some atretic eggs are postmature;
they’ve been retrieved after their “peak fresh-
ness date,” so to speak. This can happen when
you have many eggs maturing at different rates;
allowing time for smaller follicles to “catch up”
may mean that a few of the larger eggs may
become atretic.

Looking at what can go wrong 
when egg meets sperm
Good fertilization depends on the quality of the sperm and egg. At most cen-
ters, the fertilization rate is about 90 percent of the mature eggs. However,
since the embryologists inseminate all the eggs, the overall fertilization rate
that you should expect is closer to 60 percent. This reflects the fact that
some eggs were not fertilizable. Why do they inseminate all the eggs? For one
thing, judging maturity is not a perfect process, and even if an egg is imma-
ture at the time of insemination, it may still mature overnight and fertilize
then. When embryologists look at the other 40 percent of the eggs, they may
see things they’d rather not. For example, they may see the following:
 Your embryos may be polyploid, meaning that they contain more than
two pronuclei. This can occur when more than one sperm has entered
the egg (polyspermy), or when the egg doesn’t throw off the second
polar body (which should occur at the time of fertilization). These
embryos are never normal, because they contain too many chromo-
somes. Since each pronucleus contains 23, a triploid embryo (3 pronu-
clei) contains 69. Such an embryo will not grow into a baby, and they are
not transferred.
 The egg may still be immature. In this case, it may still be left in culture,
even placed with sperm, with the hope that it will mature and fertilize
later.
 The egg may be mature, yet show no signs of fertilization. In this case,
the egg might be re-inseminated (by putting in some fresh sperm, hoping
that the egg was immature when it started, has recently matured, and
will now be able to fertilize). Alternately, the embryologists may decide
to fertilize the egg by using intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI).
Whereas fertilization can be achieved by this method, embryos resulting
from “second day ICSI” have a lower chance of implanting, and some
clinics feel that it is not worth the effort. 
Doing ICSI
If you need to do ICSI for male factor (explained in Chapter 11), the embryolo-
gist removes the cumulus and the coronal layers from the egg, washes the
sperm in a special solution, and then sits down at the microscope for a most
delicate task. ICSI is done under a high-powered microscope and involves
holding the egg steady with one pipette, while another is used to inject the
sperm into its mid-section. 
254
Part IV: Moving Up to High-Tech Conception 

This task can be time consuming, and if moving, active sperm aren’t avail-
able, the embryologist tries to pick out sperm for fertilization that are at least
“twitching.” Sperm obtained during a sperm aspiration (see Chapter 11 for
more about sperm aspirations) are particularly notorious for not moving, and
the embryologists sometimes put in extra chemicals to get them to twitch so
that they can pick out the most viable ones!
ICSI is done with a very fine-gauge needle. The sperm is sucked into the
needle, your egg is stabilized, and the needle point is slowly inserted into 
the egg. ICSI requires very steady hands and a good eye for picking the best-
looking sperm.
The process afterward is the same as conventional insemination. The ICSI
eggs are left overnight and checked in the morning for fertilization. If the eggs
haven’t fertilized, ICSI can’t be redone.
Some studies have suggested that ICSI embryos may have a higher than
normal rate of aneuploidy, or abnormal number of chromosomes. This higher
rate may occur because men with severe male factor have more chromoso-
mal abnormalities, or because of the way the chromosomes come out the
sperm head after ICSI.
Checking Chromosomes with 
Pre-Implantation Genetic 
Diagnosis (PGD)
If you carry a genetic disease or sex-linked disease, are over age 35, or have a
history of repeated miscarriage, you may want to check your embryo’s chro-
mosomes before transferring. Pre-Implantation Genetic Diagnosis, or PGD,
makes it possible to check an embryo for some common chromosomal
abnormalities and can also determine whether the embryo will be a boy or
girl. The procedure doesn’t come cheap, however; centers charge between
$2,500 and $5,000 (and up!) for PGD, although the cost isn’t based on the
number of embryos you have — one embryo is the same price as five or six,
although that could change at any time.
PGD can be done to make sure the embryo has the right number of chromo-
somes (or to make sure the embryo carries the right sex chromosomes in
gender selection), or it can used to test for a specific gene. For example,
sickle cell anemia is a genetic defect in a specific gene, or part of the DNA.
During PGD, this gene can be identified, and only the embryos that don’t
255
Chapter 16: The Care and Feeding of an Embryo: Amazing Teamwork in the Lab

have the disease can be transferred, thus minimizing the risk of passing that
gene on to the next generation. PGD can also be done for tissue matching,
called HLA matching, to see if an embryo would be a suitable donor of tissue
or organs to another person. That is because the HLA genes can be identified
in the removed cell.
PGD is done by removing a cell, called a blastomere, from an eight-celled
embryo, and then testing that one cell for either the number of chromosomes
or for a specific genetic defect (like sickle cell anemia) or a genetic quality
(like an HLA tissue match). PGD can be quite labor intensive for the lab, and
it is not perfect. It is currently estimated that between 1 percent and 10 per-
cent of the time, the diagnosis is not correct. That is because only a single
cell is being analyzed (as compared with amniocentesis, in which hundreds
of cells are available). Embryos can also have something called mosaicism,
which means that the cells do not all have the same number of chromo-
somes! So the cell that is tested may be abnormal, yet the rest of the embryo
may be normal, or vice versa. Not all IVF labs can perform PGD and/or test
chromosomes. (See Chapter 2 to learn more about your genes.)
PGD can specifically test for the following, among others:
 Common trisomies (meaning an extra copy of the gene is present) such
as Trisomy 13, 18 and 21 (Down syndrome)
 Single gene inherited genetic disease such as cystic fibrosis, sickle cell
anemia, and Huntington’s disease
 Anomalies of the X and Y chromosomes, such as Klinefelter (male child
has 47 chromosomes, including XXY) and Turner (female with only
45 chromosomes; only one X is present) syndrome
 Gender-linked disorders, such as hemophilia
Although PGD sounds like, and certainly can be, a miracle for couples with
genetic issues, there are some limitations to PGD, and also some serious ethi-
cal concerns. (See Chapter 20 for more about the ethics of PGD.) The limita-
tions are:
 PGD doesn’t test for every possible chromosomal abnormality, just the
most common ones, which means that 10-15 percent of chromosomal
abnormalities may be missed.
 Only one cell is usually tested in the United States, although some cen-
ters remove and test two cells (this is controversial; removing one cell
hurts the embryo a little bit, taking out a second one may hurt it more).
Occasionally, one cell may develop differently than the others, even
though at this early stage they should all be identical. Having one cell
with chromosomes that differ from the others is called mosaicism; up to
50 percent of embryos may have mosaicism. Mosaicism in a tested call
can result in a false diagnosis, either a false positive or false negative. 
256
Part IV: Moving Up to High-Tech Conception 

It’s not clear how much damage an embryo sustains from having a cell
removed during PGD. Since individual blastomeres frequently die, and the
embryo still continues to develop, it’s thought that removing a single cell at
this early stage of development will have no effect on embryo growth or
development. 
However, even though abnormal embryos aren’t transfer, PGD doesn’t increase
pregnancy rates. This has been interpreted as meaning that undergoing PGD
decreases the per embryo implantation rate by as much as 50 percent. Of
course, this is offset by the ability to transfer only normal embryos, and the
overall pregnancy rates are maintained. The “absolute damage” rate, meaning
that the whole embryo dies during PGD, is small, less than 10 percent.
Results of PGD have to be received quickly, within one or two days, so that a
fresh transfer can be done. For this reason, PGD labs frequently work around
the clock!
Some studies have shown that embryos with abnormal chromosome testing
at day 3 “self correct” by day 5 to have cells with a normal number of chro-
mosomes. Would these embryos have implanted if they had been transferred
on day 3? This is just one of the many PGD-related questions that are as yet
left unanswered. Much more research is needed into the mysteries of embryo
growth at a very early stage. 
Answering the Call from Embryology
An embryologist usually calls the morning after your egg retrieval to let you
know how many embryos you have and to discuss how many you are think-
ing you will want to transfer (the final decision will most likely have to be
made on the day of transfer, when you will have a better idea of how they’re
growing). If you’re going to freeze some, the embryologist also gives you
some help deciding how many to leave out to grow a few days before picking
the best few to transfer. Some centers suggest letting six to ten embryos, if
you have that many, grow for a few days. They then pick the best two or
three to transfer and freeze the rest, sometimes growing the remaining
embryos to blastocyst stage before freezing all that survive.
The embryos that are frozen after a few days usually have two to eight cells,
and their thaw rate may not be as good as 2PN embryos (embryos frozen the
day after egg retrieval).
Two days after retrieval, embryology may call again, this time to tell you how
your embryos are growing. One hopes they’ve now reached the two- to four-
cell stage. Figure 16-2 shows a four-cell embryo.
257
Chapter 16: The Care and Feeding of an Embryo: Amazing Teamwork in the Lab

You may get a third call from embryology the third day after retrieval if
you’re doing a three-day transfer. Some centers still do transfers two days
after retrieval, and some do most transfers five days after retrieval — at five
days, the embryo should have reached the blastocyst stage. (We discuss
blastocyst transfer in the section “Blasting Off! Considering a Blastocyst
Transfer,” later in this chapter.) If your embryos are now four to eight cells,
they’re ready for transfer. In addition to being graded by the number of cells,
embryos are also graded by the equality and roundness of the cells and by
the amount of fragmentation, or broken pieces, that are in the embryo. 
Figure 16-3 shows an embryo with a high degree of fragmentation.
Although a funny-looking embryo doesn’t create a funny-looking kid, most
embryologists do feel that an embryo with less fragmentation and more even-
looking cells has a better chance of implanting. If you do get pregnant from
fragmented embryos, the fragmentation does not mean that your baby will be
abnormal in any way. Some centers remove the fragmented pieces before the
embryo is transferred if the embryo has a significant amount of fragmenta-
tion. (See Figure 16-3 for a picture of an embryo with fragmentation.) One
study suggested that the size and location of the fragments was also impor-
tant; removing large fragments improved pregnancy rates more than remov-
ing small or scattered fragments. However, fragment removal is one of those
controversial areas of embryology; if the lab with which you’re working doesn’t
do fragment removal, this doesn’t mean they’re not up to date. This is why
embryology is not just science but also an art. Things that work in one lab
may not work in another and may be felt to be unnecessary.
Grading an embryo
At some centers the best-looking embryos on day 3 are graded as an 8A, with 8
being the number of the cells and A through F being the degree of fragmenta-
tion. Different centers grade embryos differently, so make sure you understand
your particular clinic’s grading system.
Figure 16-2:
A four-cell
embryo.
258
Part IV: Moving Up to High-Tech Conception 

Does a great-looking embryo improve your chance of getting pregnant? Most
embryologists would say a cautious yes, depending on your age, uterine
cavity, general health, and many other factors. (An “A” embryo in a 40-year-
old woman still has a much lower chance of implanting than, say, a “C”
embryo in a 30-year old.)
Occasionally, if you’re doing a three-day transfer, one or more of your embryos
may already be morulas, meaning that the cells have pulled together and can
no longer be counted. Morulas (from the Latin for “mulberry”) usually have 
a very high rate of implantation, similar to blastocysts; in fact, they’re the
embryo stage right before blastocyst (see the section “Blasting Off! Considering
a Blastocyst Transfer,” later in this chapter).
Should you transfer that embryo?
Not all embryos are eight-cell, grade A embryos. In fact, most aren’t. But most
embryos that are at least four cells and graded B or C have a decent chance
of implanting, and every embryologist has seen terrible-looking embryos that
went on to become beautiful children. Embryologists suggest discarding the
following types of embryos, however, because they’re generally chromosoma-
lly abnormal:
 Multinucleated embryos, which contain three or more “bundles” of
genetic material: At least 75 percent are abnormal.
 Embryos with uneven pronuclei: About 85 percent are abnormal.
 Embryos that develop too rapidly: Many of these have an abnormal
number of chromosomes.

Looking at Your Uterine Lining
Embryos will implant only if the uterus is ready for implantation. Many cen-
ters look via ultrasound at the uterine thickness and also the appearance of
the lining, called the pattern, to decide whether your embryos have a good
chance of implanting after transfer. Your lining may be described as triple
lined, also called tri-laminar. This pattern description is shortened to TL in
most centers and describes the lining most clinics like to see before embryo
transfer. Fertility centers differ on what’s considered a good thickness, but
most prefer to see a thickness of at least 7 millimeters.
The next best lining is an isoechogenic (IE) pattern, and the lining that has
the lowest implantation rate is a homogenous hyperechoic (HH) pattern.
Different clinics place varying amounts of importance on lining patterns, and
your clinic may not even check the pattern.
Most centers, however, do check the lining thickness before transfer; any-
thing over 7 millimeters thick is considered adequate, although pregnancies
do occur with thinner linings. Your center’s emphasis on the importance of
the lining thickness or pattern will vary.
Hatching Embryos — Come 
on Out, You Guys
Around 1994, embryologists came out with a new technique called assisted
hatching to help human embryos implant in the uterus. The majority of IVF
centers do hatching on at least some of their embryos.
Assisted hatching (AH) is done the morning of your embryo transfer. The
embryologist takes a tiny needle with acid on the end of it and barely touches
the shell of the embryo, creating a small hole. This helps the embryo “break
through” the zona, or hard shell, and attach to the uterus, an action that must
happen a day or so after the embryo reaches the uterus in nature. Embryos
created in the lab are theorized to have harder shells than are seen in natural
conception, so the little hole, one hopes, gives them a head start on breaking
out and hunkering down where they belong.
Hatching was originally done only on embryos whose zona, or outer shell,
was thicker than normal, or on embryos from women over age 37, whose
embryos might have a harder time breaking out of the shell. Now, some cen-
ters do assisted hatching on almost all their embryos; others still do AH only
on certain patients, and some use it on frozen-thawed embryos.
260
Part IV: Moving Up to High-Tech Conception 

Deciding How Many Embryos to Transfer
Deciding how many embryos to transfer can be difficult. Some centers and
some parts of the world don’t give you any say in the matter. For example, in
England, you transfer two embryos if you’re under age 40 — no exceptions.
Some centers allow transfer of two embryos for women up to age 30, three
embryos between ages 30 and 35, four embryos over age 35, and six or more
embryos if you’re over 40.
The ideal situation is discussing at your first doctor’s appointment how many
embryos to transfer, but the trouble is, you won’t know at that point how well
you’ll stimulate, or how your embryos will look. Spending an hour debating
about transferring four embryos is silly when you may get only three. If you
end up with five embryos with a lot of fragmentation, most doctors suggest
transferring more embryos than if they all look good. Some centers don’t
freeze extra embryos, usually because their labs don’t do freezing well.
You may have to use ’em or lose ’em, and you may not be willing to discard
embryos. At the very least, you can find out your clinic’s policies about trans-
fer at your first visit, and keep thinking ahead as you go through IVF about
what you’ll do at transfer time.
Blasting Off! Considering 
a Blastocyst Transfer
A few years ago, IVF centers became alarmed at the large number of higher-
order multiples (triplets or more) their patients were delivering, and they
261
Chapter 16: The Care and Feeding of an Embryo: Amazing Teamwork in the Lab
Making embryos stick: Why 
Super Glue doesn’t work
Several IVF centers have come forward with
new ideas for “sticking” embryos to the uterine
lining. They either coat them with a sticking
substance or dig a little hole in the endometrium
into which they put them. The IVF community
hasn’t gone crazy over these ideas because
failure to implant usually isn’t due to the embryos
not sticking to the lining. It’s a problem with the
embryo or the lining itself. If the embryos, for
whatever reason, aren’t capable of growing
into normal human beings, or the lining itself
isn’t capable of supporting their growth, forcing
the embryos to attach to the lining won’t make
them grow.

started looking for ways to transfer fewer embryos and still maintain the all-
important high pregnancy rates.
Understanding blastocyst transfer
In most centers, the percentage of live-birth twins is about 25 percent of total
births, and triplets somewhere between 5 and 10 percent. Quadruplets and
higher are relatively rare, but are considered a problem at almost all clinics
because the complication for both mother and babies is very high, and many
babies die of prematurity or are miscarried.
Out of that concern came the concept of blastocyst transfer, the transfer of a
five-day-old embryo. Because only 30 to 50 percent of embryos grow to blas-
tocyst stage (see Figure 16-4), centers felt that only the best embryos were
going to be transferred. As it turned out, blastocyst transfer of two embryos
results in pregnancy rates in women under 35 that are the same as those
achieved by the transfer of three embryos on day 3. However, the risk of
triplets was greatly decreased. 
Considering complications
Blastocyst transfer isn’t for everyone. Because blastocysts are more compli-
cated to grow than three-day embryos, requiring multiple media changes to
keep up with their increased nutritional needs, many centers find it too diffi-
cult to grow enough blastocysts to get to transfer. So if your center transfers
only blastocysts, you may end up with nothing to transfer.

A blastocyst.
262
Part IV: Moving Up to High-Tech Conception 

The second problem comes from the blastocysts themselves. Because they’re
already “hatching” out of their shells at the time of transfer, blastocysts seem
unusually likely to split into identical twins. Although on the surface, having
identical twins doesn’t seem much different than having fraternal twins, the
fact is that identical twin pregnancies are much more problematic than frater-
nal ones. Because identical twins share the same placenta and sac, twin-twin
transfusion syndrome, in which one twin gets too many nutrients and the other
not enough, is more common, as are cord accidents, in which one baby gets
tangled in the other’s umbilical cord. The incidence of identical twins is about
four to five times higher in blastocyst transfer than in normal conception. Of
course, if you transfer two blastocysts and one splits, you’re right back to the
problem of higher-order multiples again. For these reasons, some centers have
stopped doing blastocyst transfer on all patients and instead use it selectively,
such as for patients who have had several IVF failures.
Taking Post-retrieval Pills and Potions
You may think that you’re all done with medication after your egg retrieval,
but you’ll receive a sheet full of instructions about everything you need to
take starting the day of your retrieval. Yes, the pills and potions go on after
retrieval, but most are designed to help your embryo grow. Here’s what you’ll
probably be given:
 Antibiotics: An egg retrieval is surgery that goes through a “dirty” area:
your vagina. Yes, your vagina is considered a dirty area no matter how
personally dainty and clean you are, which simply means that in medical
terms, the area is not sterile. (By the way, so is your mouth; medically
“dirty” simply means that it is not sterile.) So your doctor will probably
give you antibiotics for several days, starting the day of your retrieval.
Make sure that you mention any allergies or sensitivities.
If you’re prone to yeast infections, you can take an over-the-counter pill
called acidophilus, which maintains the balance of good and bad bacte-
ria in your vagina. When the good bacteria are killed off with the bad
ones, you get an overgrowth of yeast, which causes itching and a white
cheesy discharge.
 Steroids: These may seem like an odd addition to your pill arsenal, but
steroids are given to protect your embryo from attack by white blood
cells after transfer. Steroids decrease the number of white blood cells in
your blood. The dose given is very low and usually for just a few days.
Their use is controversial, and most centers don’t use them.
 Progesterone: When it comes to progesterone supplements, you may be
given pills, gels, suppositories, or — can you stand it? — injections.
263
Chapter 16: The Care and Feeding of an Embryo: Amazing Teamwork in the Lab

Some centers give progesterone injections to everyone because injec-
tions are the best absorbed. But progesterone injections do have a
downside:
• They hurt. The needle used for progesterone needs to be at least 
a 22-gauge (relatively thick) variety because the progesterone is
very thick, or viscous, and won’t flow through a smaller needle.
The progesterone is mixed in sesame or peanut oil, and a fair
number of women have allergic reactions to the oils.
• They’re hard to find. Commercially made progesterone in oil is
very hard to find. Some small compounding pharmacies make their
own, as do some of the large mail-order pharmacies that specialize
in fertility medications.
• Insurance doesn’t always cover the cost. Some insurance compa-
nies don’t feel that progesterone injections are medically neces-
sary. Costs are reasonable — about $45 a bottle — but can add up
if you’re using a bottle every five days for several months.
On the other hand, some centers use vaginal suppositories. The down-
side aspects of these are
• They’re messy. The suppositories leak, making it necessary to
wear a pad.
• They can cause yeast infections. Because they keep you continu-
ally wet, you’re more likely to develop a yeast infection or rash,
which can be more than a little annoying.
• They’re hard to find. Specialty pharmacies usually make them
themselves, which means that the amount of medication delivered
can vary.
Other progesterone options are the following:
• Crinone: This progesterone gel is manufactured by Serono, a drug
company that makes many fertility medications. Crinone causes
less leakage and irritation than vaginal suppositories. It comes in
an applicator that is inserted vaginally. Crinone is more expensive
than vaginal suppositories.
• Prometrium capsules, or compounded capsules: These are pills,
which means that if you take them orally, they pass through your
liver after being digested in the stomach. The main disadvantage is
that the way they’re metabolized causes drowsiness, which can be
severe. Some women also complain about dizziness or nausea. The
amount of progesterone you get this way is quite small. For this
reason, most centers that use these advise patients to take the pills
vaginally. The progesterone actually absorbs better than after swal-
lowing them, and they’re somewhat less messy than suppositories.
264
Part IV: Moving Up to High-Tech Conception 

Transferring Your Embryo
When you arrive for your embryo transfer, you’ll be taken back to the IVF
suite. Many centers allow your partner to come with you, and both of you
may need to change into sterile gowns and coveralls. Some centers give you
Valium before your transfer, primarily to reduce cramping after the proce-
dure, although relaxing you is a side benefit.
Studies have shown that reducing cramping that you can’t even feel can
boost the pregnancy rate by 50 percent.
You’ll be instructed to lie on an exam table that can be tilted. The worst part
of the transfer in most clinics is that you’re lying there with a full bladder. A
full bladder, uncomfortable as it is, makes it easier to see your uterus under
abdominal ultrasound guidance, and many centers now do embryo transfers
under ultrasound guidance rather than blindly placing them through the
cervix.
Your bladder, lying right over the uterus, pushes your uterus back when it’s
full; this also straightens the path into the uterus, making the transfer easier. 
A full bladder is especially helpful if you have an anteverted uterus, meaning
one that is normally tilted forward. This is the most common position for the
uterus. Remember that the uterus is attached by its base, and its top (the
fundus) is therefore free to flop forward or backward. Sometimes, a retro-
verted uterus is called “tipped,” but this is simply a relatively uncommon
alternative position. The direction of your uterus makes no difference to
whether or not you get pregnant, but it is important to the doctor performing
your transfer because he or she must direct the catheter in the right direction.
An embryologist or your doctor may come in to speak with you before the
transfer. That person will tell you how your embryos look today, may show 
or give you pictures, will verify your identity, and will confirm the number of
embryos you want to transfer. You’ll most likely receive something to sign
that says that you agree to transfer X number of embryos, that you under-
stand the risks of multiple birth, that you realize there’s no guarantee of suc-
cess, and that you are who you say you are.
After this point:
 An ultrasonographer (if your clinic uses ultrasound guidance) will place
the probe on your abdomen so that the uterus can be visualized.
 The doctor or associate (nurses do embryo transfers in some centers)
will wash your cervix and remove any mucus from the opening. 
265
Chapter 16: The Care and Feeding of an Embryo: Amazing Teamwork in the Lab

 Leaving a speculum in place, the doctor will let the embryologist know
she’s ready. Here come your embryos!
 Your doctor will slide the catheter through your cervix, which may
cause a little cramping. If your clinic uses ultrasound guidance for the
transfer, the ultrasonographers will let the doctor know how far away
from the top of the uterus the catheter is before the embryos are slowly
injected into the uterus. 
 The catheter is slowly removed and handed back to the embryologist,
who examines it under a microscope to make sure that no embryos are
still in the catheter.
A transfer that’s traumatic in any way, causing bleeding or severe cramping,
may decrease your chance of pregnancy. If you’ve done a mock transfer (in a
mock transfer, a soft catheter is inserted into the uterus, and the depth of the
uterus and the angle required to get into it are recorded) before starting IVF,
the doctor has a “map” of your cervical canal and uterine opening so trauma
is less likely. Ultrasound guidance also makes it easier to see the curves in
your anatomy, so your center may not do a mock transfer if it’s using ultra-
sound guidance for your embryo transfer.
After your embryos are in the uterus, you may need to stay on the table with
your feet tilted up for a half hour or so. Clinics vary widely in their bed rest
requirements, and they may keep you anywhere from no time at all to up to 
a few hours. After you go home, you’ll be instructed to maintain a variable
degree of rest for a specified time. Most clinics suggest two days. Others rec-
ommend up to a week, and some clinics don’t feel that any bed rest is justified.
Embryos are placed directly into your uterus; emptying your bladder or
bowels isn’t going to dislodge them! Neither will coughing or sneezing. It’s
easy to get constipated during this time because you’re resting. This will
make you uncomfortable, never mind more worried about straining! It’s best
to take a gentle stool softener, like milk of magnesia (which doesn’t absorb
from the bowel), or extra bran in the diet.
Keeping Your Feet and Your Spirits 
Up After the Transfer
After you’re safely home, you may be on restricted activity for a period of
time, depending on your clinic’s policies. Try not to compare what you’re
doing to what anyone else is doing, because different centers have different
policies. If you don’t follow your center’s policies, you’re bound to feel guilty
if you don’t get pregnant, so follow your instruction sheet.
266
Part IV: Moving Up to High-Tech Conception 

If your center restricts activity after the transfer, you’ll be lying around on 
the bed or couch, getting up only to use the bathroom and eat meals. After
your strict rest period is over, many centers still ask you not to lift anything
heavy (over 15 pounds is typical), not to do any strenuous exercise, and not
to have sex.
Sex is restricted because it can cause uterine contractions, especially if you
have an orgasm, so the no-sex rule applies to any activity that could cause an
orgasm, not just intercourse. Yes, this restriction does include vibrators!
Heavy lifting is another common prohibition that can cause concern, espe-
cially if your job requires it or if you have a small child. Most centers will
gladly write you a note restricting your work activity, but your 1-year-old
probably won’t understand a note saying you can’t lift him into his high 
chair. If you have to lift a child, bend with your knees, trying to keep your
back straight when you lift rather than bending at the waist and straining
your abdominal muscles. This form is good body mechanics, and you should
pick up heavy objects, such as children, this way all the time if you want to
keep your back in working order.
Mild exercise, such as a leisurely walk, is fine, but forget about aerobics for a
while. Use common sense about yoga, tai chi, or whatever else you do to
decrease stress and increase endorphins. If you feel guilty doing it, you prob-
ably shouldn’t be doing it!

Now it’s time to wait for your pregnancy test. Because the test results won’t
be accurate for almost two weeks after your embryo transfer, this time period
is often referred to by patients as “the two-week wait.”
In this chapter, we review some of the do’s and don’ts of the two-week wait,
and take a little peek into the future when you’ll have an answer to the big
question — am I pregnant or not? — and what you’ll be doing in either case.

Technically, You’re Pregnant — 
Waiting for the Proof
From a purely technical viewpoint, after the embryos are placed into your
uterus, you’re pregnant — in the loosest sense of the word, at least. You have
embryos floating around where they belong, and all they have to do is attach
and grow.
This is probably the first time in your infertility history where you can say
without a doubt that you’ve formed an embryo and that it is where it needs
to be to grow. You may have known that you made a follicle, and been fairly
sure that you got sperm where it needed to go at the right time, but you
never knew for sure that the egg and sperm got together. Now you do.
Now comes the waiting period. The two-week wait is a time of “what ifs” and
“if onlys” like no other time you’ve probably experienced. Because this is new
territory for you, we give some ideas on how to make it through the two-week
wait without driving yourself crazy.
Keeping busy
Although you may be tempted to just relax and wait, unencumbered by other
responsibilities, the truth is that sitting around waiting is hard work, a lot
harder than keeping yourself busy with everyday tasks. Waiting for water to
boil and staring at it as well is a quick recipe for instant irritation, and so is
staying idle during these two weeks.
Try to plan as many activities as you can manage (after your post-transfer 
rest period). If you work, consider it a blessing and immerse yourself in your
responsibilities. Many women suggest reading a good book to get you through
this time. Try to keep the book as far away from the topic of fertility as possi-
ble. Exercise is also a good way to keep busy, but keep it mild, like walking
around the block. Many couples find that the two-week wait is a great time to
take a vacation. What better way to distract yourself than with a little R&R?
If the tension does begin to run high, assemble your backup plan. What will
you do next, pregnant or not? This type of planning often alleviates the fear
and uncertainty that accompany the two-week wait.

Making your to-do or not-to-do list
Taking care of yourself during the roller coaster ride of trying to create a
baby is crucial. For some women, this may mean a trip to the hairdresser,
manicurist, gym, or all of the above. But you should consider a few limita-
tions as you wait out these last few weeks before your pregnancy test.
Coloring your hair
For those whose follicle challenges begin at the top of their heads, hair color-
ing is more than just a luxury; it’s a way of life. To color or not to color has
been a long-time topic of discussion among the newly pregnant. According to
the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, hair coloring is safe
during pregnancy. Based on this opinion, coloring your hair during the two-
week wait is also presumed to be safe (unless of course your colorist turns
your hair orange!). However, keep in mind that the two-week wait is only two
weeks. If you’re at all concerned, staying off the bottle (of color, that is) for
the time being may be the best advice for you.
Having manicures and pedicures
The greatest danger that we know of in manicures and pedicures is for those
who give them. You may have noticed that many manicurists now wear masks
to protect themselves from the fumes and toxins generated by the products.
A simple polish-and-go won’t hurt you during the two-week wait. Those with
acrylic nails are advised to refrain from having this service during the two-
week wait, and those who don’t have acrylic nails but want them are better
off waiting until after the two-week wait, and after the first trimester of preg-
nancy for that matter. If you already have acrylic nails, don’t panic, but you
may consider having them removed before your cycle.
Getting your exercise
Exercise can be a great way to take your mind off your waiting and your wor-
ries during the two-week wait. Here are two basic rules to remember with
exercise during this time:
 Don’t start up a brand-new routine during the two-week wait. In other
words, if you’re not a runner, don’t become one now. Keep your exercise
routine consistent with that in which you engaged before.
 Keep your heart rate equal to or lower than 140 beats per minute. This
rate is also recommended during pregnancy, so this is a good time to 
get used to keeping track of it. Most fitness stores sell inexpensive heart
rate monitors, and certain exercise machines (such as particular brands
of treadmills) have a built-in monitor that can read your heart rate when
you grasp the metal sensors on the handle bar.
271
Chapter 17: Waiting, Waiting: Surviving the Two-Week Wait after an IVF Cycle

Keep in mind that moderation must become your middle name, in judgment
and in exercise. Should you choose the two-week wait as the ideal time to
scale Mount Everest? We think not. Nor do we recommend skydiving for
novices (or even experts) during this time. Both activities, aside from being
highly dangerous, also pose the added risk of high altitude, which may be
hazardous for those unaccustomed to it. However, if you live in Denver, the
mile-high city, you don’t have to move. The two-week wait calls for maintain-
ing the status quo. Leave the new stuff for later.
Having sex during the two-week wait
For those going through the two-week wait after in vitro fertilization, sex is
considered a no-no (at least by most doctors). You’ve had surgery (albeit
minor), and the risk of infection may be greater, so hands (and other body
parts) off during this time. Another concern is that female orgasm may cause
a series of uterine contractions, which are not ideal in creating a hospitable
environment for baby embryo. Read a good book instead.
Sensing Every Little Twinge: The Truth
about Pregnancy Symptoms
Of course you’re anxious. Of course you’re anxiously examining every twinge
and cramp you have for some indication of whether you’re pregnant. If you’re
taking progesterone, as you most likely are after an IVF cycle, the symptoms
of pregnancy can easily be confused with symptoms of progesterone supple-
mentation, because an increase in progesterone is associated with many
common pregnancy symptoms. What might you experience, and which signs
are good, bad, and meaningless? Here are some symptoms you may experi-
ence and what they mean:
 Sore breasts: Tender breasts are almost a universal sign of pregnancy,
with or without feelings of heaviness or tingling in the nipples. Unfor-
tunately, sore breasts are caused by increased progesterone and estro-
gen, so sore breasts may be caused by the ovarian stimulation you
underwent or your suppositories rather than by a growing embryo.
 Spotting: This symptom is very common in very early pregnancy,
whether or not you’ve undergone fertility treatment. Spotting may be
caused by an embryo burrowing into the uterus and causing leakage of
blood from small blood vessels. If you’re taking progesterone supposito-
ries, irritation from the suppositories can also cause some spotting.
272
Part IV: Moving Up to High-Tech Conception 

 Cramping: This discomfort is typical in the two-week wait and may be
caused by the enlarged ovaries if you’ve done a medicated cycle (taken
ovarian stimulating medications, as discussed in Chapter 13). Some cen-
ters believe that cramping is a sign of low progesterone, and they may
increase your supplements if you have continued cramping.
 Fatigue: This symptom is often related to higher than normal levels of
hCG (human chorionic gonadotropin, the injection given 36 or so hours
before an egg retrieval) and progesterone, both of which can be from the
growing embryo or from your hCG trigger shot. Progesterone pills are
particularly noted for causing extreme fatigue. Progesterone also raises
your temperature, which may make you more sluggish than usual. Plus
you’re probably emotionally exhausted from the IVF cycle! This is a per-
fectly good time to get extra rest.
 Nausea: This symptom is fairly common with progesterone, especially in
pill form, and also with high levels of hCG. Higher than normal levels of
estrogen can also cause nausea.
So how can you tell whether you’re pregnant in the two-week wait? Unfor-
tunately, you really can’t. Sharon can name at least a dozen patients who
swore they weren’t pregnant and were, along with many patients who were
sure they were pregnant but weren’t. Continue taking your meds even if
you’re sure you’re not pregnant, because there’s a good chance you’re wrong!
273
Chapter 17: Waiting, Waiting: Surviving the Two-Week Wait after an IVF Cycle
Don’t be so sure you’re not pregnant!
Patients who quit taking their medications such
as progesterone on their own when they
assume that they’re not pregnant make Sharon
want to pull her hair out. She usually finds this
out when she calls a patient (we’ll call her
Mary) who inexplicably never came in for her
pregnancy test a week or so ago. When Sharon
asks the patient why she never came in, she
says, “Oh, I got my period, so I stopped my
meds.” At this point, Sharon’s hair starts to
stand on end, and she asks if Mary got a full-
flow period. Some patients may say yes, but
Mary, like most patients, says no — it was
lighter than normal. Some women have a very
light period even though they’re pregnant, so
this raises Sharon’s voice a few octaves, and
she tells Mary to have blood work done. Today.
Right now, in fact. Mary voices extreme surprise
and a little irritation at this, and says she knows
she’s not pregnant. And besides, she has some-
thing else to do today. You would think that
people who just spent thousands of dollars
trying to get pregnant wouldn’t do something
like this, but you’d be wrong. And so is Mary,
quite frequently. Don’t stop taking your medica-
tions until you have your pregnancy test done
and someone tells you specifically to stop!

Saying No to Home Pregnancy Tests
Most women find the temptation of a home pregnancy test (HPT) impossible
to resist. Those little packaged sticks promise immediate results and an
answer to the question “Am I pregnant or not?” Before you go out and buy up
your druggist’s supply of home pregnancy tests, consider the following:
 Many home pregnancy tests require a minimum amount of hCG in your
system in order to register a positive. Early pregnancy may not result in
a high enough number to register, even if you are pregnant.
 You were most likely given an hCG shot to trigger ovulation before your
IVF retrieval. That shot of 10,000 units of hCG doesn’t leave your system
overnight. Furthermore, it’s the same hormone (the pregnancy hormone)
measured in home pregnancy tests. For some women, the traces of the
hCG shot can take 10 to 15 days to disappear. Your HPT doesn’t know
that though! This can result in a false positive and a big letdown when
the moment of truth arrives.
 Home pregnancy tests generally require the first morning’s urine, which
contains the highest concentration of hCG, for greatest accuracy. Many
women, pregnant or not, awake in the middle of the night to urinate,
making the first morning’s urine not the first after all. Unless you want to
subject yourself to 3 a.m. wake-up calls for home pregnancy tests, this is
yet another reason to “skip the stick.”
 Home pregnancy tests are, first and foremost, over-the-counter devices.
They do not replace a beta HCG — a blood test that measures the level
of hCG. Don’t expect the same accuracy or reliability from drugstore
pregnancy tests.
Many women get on the HPT roller coaster, allowing their emotions to rise
and fall with each subsequent pee stick. It isn’t worth it. Wait for the real
thing, as hard as the waiting may be. You have no reason to subject yourself
to a test that could very well yield incorrect results.
Waiting for the Phone to Ring
It’s beta day — the day your blood tests reveal whether you’re pregnant or not.
Waiting for the phone to ring is almost always an unpleasant experience —
whether waiting for a date to call or a nurse to deliver news of whether your
baby is on its way. But modern technology has given us answering machines
and voicemail so that you don’t have to sit by the phone! Take advantage of
this technology. 
274
Part IV: Moving Up to High-Tech Conception 

Deciding where you want the call
If you choose not to be home when the phone rings, alert the nurse or doctor
who will be calling you with your results. Do you want that information left
on your answering machine? Is there a chance that your little sister, mother,
or cleaning person might hear the results instead, and perhaps forget to tell
you? Work out these details ahead of time and communicate them to those
who’ll be delivering your results. Planning to receive this call at work may not
be the best idea, unless you have a private area and/or supportive people
around you. If you don’t want to be called at work, make this fact very clear
to the nurses and/or doctor as well. Some choose to have their partners
receive the news. If you feel that hearing the news from someone close to you
would be easier, consider this option and put it into action. You can’t control
the news you’ll hear, but you can control the way you hear it. 
Understanding chemical pregnancy 
and false positives
False positives are rare in pregnancy tests. You’re most likely to get a false
positive result on either a home pregnancy test or a beta subunit if it’s been
less than two weeks since you took hCG. Some doctors give hCG “boosters”
during the two-week wait because it helps the corpus luteum, the remnant of
your follicle that produced an egg, put out more progesterone.
Although anything over 5 IU is a positive test, the chances of a pregnancy
with such a low starting level succeeding are less than if the beta was higher.
However, sometimes a pregnancy may implant a few days later than normal,
giving an initial low positive. These pregnancies may pick up steam quickly,
and the beta will start rising appropriately.
A beta that is positive for only a few days may be called a chemical pregnancy
by your doctor; a chemical pregnancy is one in which the embryo starts to
implant but fails to grow normally, so that a low level of hCG may be picked
up for a short time. The beta in these cases may be negative a few days later
if you repeat the test. (See Chapter 5 for more about chemical pregnancies.)
Most clinics urge cautious optimism if the first beta level is lower than they
would like to see it. Don’t broadcast the news to anyone except those closest
to you if your initial beta isn’t very high.
275
Chapter 17: Waiting, Waiting: Surviving the Two-Week Wait after an IVF Cycle

Responding to Positive News
After you get the call from your center that your test was positive, your initial
elation may quickly change to worry: Will everything go well? Are your num-
bers too high or too low? Should you tell anyone yet? After almost constant
contact with your clinic for weeks or months, it can be scary to think that
you’ll soon be leaving the people you’ve come to know and trust.
Don’t panic. Most clinics continue to see you for a few weeks after your first
positive test to make sure that your pregnancy is going well. Some centers
even have nurses on staff who deal only with the center’s pregnant patients.
Continuing the tests
Some centers continue to check your beta and your progesterone levels 
for several weeks to make sure that your pregnancy is a good one. Because
you may not be able to see an obstetrician for a few weeks, this monitoring
ensures that if you have an ectopic pregnancy, you’ll be diagnosed promptly,
to avoid life-threatening complications.
Your clinic usually wants to see your beta double every two to three days for
the first few weeks. The following numbers are typical milestones based on a
day-three embryo transfer (three days after the egg retrieval). If you trans-
ferred blastocysts on day five, subtract two days. Obviously there are many
exceptions to the “rules” here. This list gives only the averages.
 9 days post-transfer: Average BSU 48; range 17–119
 10 days post-transfer: Average BSU 59; range 17–147
 11 days post-transfer: Average BSU 95; range 17–223
 12 days post-transfer: Average BSU 132; range 17–429
 13 days post-transfer: Average BSU 292; range 70–758
 16 days post-transfer: Average BSU 1061; range 324–4130; yolk sac may
be visible
 By the sixth week of pregnancy: Average BSU 17,000; heartbeat seen by
end of sixth week
 End of sixth week: Average BSU 30,000; embryo seen
276
Part IV: Moving Up to High-Tech Conception 

If your beta isn’t rising appropriately, no one can do much but wait to see
what happens. Some clinics monitor your progesterone levels and add more
progesterone if your numbers are a little low, but adding progesterone won’t
save a bad pregnancy if the issue isn’t a lack of progesterone.
A beta that starts out high and rises very quickly may mean a twin or triplet
pregnancy. In one very unusual case in the clinic where Sharon works, a very
high first and rapidly rising beta was caused by a pregnancy growing in an
ovary. This is an extremely rare type of ectopic pregnancy.
When will you get to see your baby on ultrasound? Some clinics schedule 
an ultrasound around six weeks, or two weeks after you’ve missed a period.
Don’t expect to see much at this point. The enthusiastic ultrasonagrapher
may be able to point out the fetal pole and the yolk sac to you, but these fea-
tures resemble a blob much more than a baby.
For historic reasons, obstetricians count the “gestational age” from the theoret-
ical first day of the last menstrual period, assuming normal cycles and natural
conception. During IVF, the day of egg retrieval is considered the day of ovula-
tion, or 14 days after the last menstrual period. So 6 weeks of gestational age
means 4 weeks after ovulation, or exactly 28 days after egg retrieval during IVF.
If today is the 31st day after egg retrieval, then your gestational age is 6 weeks
plus 3 days.
At this point, you should know whether you have more than one baby, but
keep in mind that many times one twin or triplet will disappear by the next
ultrasound. Very early losses of one or more embryos are very common, so
wait until 12 weeks or so before you tell all the neighbors you’re having twins
or triplets.
By six to seven weeks you should be able to see a heartbeat, which you may
actually recognize on ultrasound as a little flicker, and the embryo will be vis-
ible. At this point, your baby will resemble a fish more than a human being.
No one will be willing to guess if you’re having a boy or girl for another seven
or eight weeks. Remember that ultrasound guesses aren’t always accurate, so
don’t decorate the nursery in pink or blue just yet!
One of the most accurate ways of making sure that your baby is growing the
way it should is to measure the crown-to-rump length. The embryo can first
be measured around six weeks, when it’s about 4 millimeters long and the
heartbeat can first be visualized. Fetal growth in the first 12 weeks is fairly
exact, and your baby’s gestational age can be determined from the crown-to-
rump length. (This is more important when women are not sure when they
conceived, but during IVF it helps to reassure you that the pregnancy is grow-
ing according to schedule.) Here are what the measurements should be at dif-
ferent stages. See above for how obstetricians determine gestational age.
277
Chapter 17: Waiting, Waiting: Surviving the Two-Week Wait after an IVF Cycle

 Six weeks: 4 millimeters
 Seven weeks: 10 millimeters
 Eight weeks: 16 millimeters
 Nine weeks: 23 millimeters
 Ten weeks: 31 millimeters
 Eleven weeks: 41 millimeters
 Twelve weeks: 54 millimeters
Saying goodbye to your fertility doctor
Some fertility clinics monitor you through the first few weeks after you
become pregnant; others wave goodbye with your first positive beta test.
Most clinics don’t want to keep you too long as a pregnant patient because
they don’t want to deal with pregnancy issues. Also, malpractice insurance
for gynecologists and reproductive endocrinologists does not cover taking
care of patients beyond the first trimester. But you may have a hard time get-
ting an appointment with an obstetrician until you’re ten weeks pregnant or
so, leaving you in sort of a no man’s land of medical care.
Establish yourself as a patient of an obstetrician even before you get preg-
nant. That way, if you have any problems in the first few weeks, such as spot-
ting, cramping, or severe pain (as in a possible ectopic pregnancy), your
obstetrician can take care of you, even if your clinic doesn’t deal with these
issues.
Defining high-risk pregnancy
Don’t think of yourself as a high-risk pregnancy just because you did IVF to
get pregnant. Most of the time, IVF doesn’t increase the risk of complications
in pregnancy. The complications come from whatever caused your infertility,
such as your age, uterine shape, or other health issues.
Most doctors consider you high risk for the following reasons:
 You’re over age 35.
 You have a uterine malformation that may make it hard for you to carry
the pregnancy.
 You have multiples (twins or higher).
278
Part IV: Moving Up to High-Tech Conception 

 You have a health history of cancer or a disease such as diabetes, lupus,
or heart disease.
 You have a history of incompetent cervix.
 You have had several previous cesarean sections.
 You’re significantly overweight.
If you’re a high-risk patient, you’ll probably be seeing your obstetrician more
often than once a month in the first trimester. You may be doing additional
testing, such as chorionic villus sampling (CVS), to check for chromosomal
abnormalities in the first three months.
Considering the Next Step 
If IVF Doesn’t Work
Every day, a patient asks Sharon how she could not be pregnant. “But my
embryos looked perfect. My lining looked great, and I did everything I was
supposed to. How could it not work?” women say.
Unfortunately, most of the time the answer is, “We don’t know.” Statistically
speaking, if you have a 50 percent chance of getting pregnant, you have an
equal 50 percent chance of not getting pregnant, but this isn’t the answer a
disappointed patient wants to hear. You want an answer, something you can
fix in the future. But the truth is that medicine doesn’t have all the answers.
Figuring out what happened
What happened? One of several things happened if your pregnancy test was
negative:
 The embryos may not have implanted at all. The most common reason
for embryos not implanting is that their development stopped prior to
reaching the implantation stage. The older you are, the more likely this
is to happen, but the cessation of embryo development is thought to be
the most common cause of lack of pregnancy at any age, and in fact,
even during natural conception.
 The embryos started to implant and then stopped. Usually this happens
because the embryos are abnormal chromosomally. The only way to tell
whether embryos have the right chromosomes is to do preimplantation
genetic diagnosis (PGD), a procedure in which one cell is removed from
279
Chapter 17: Waiting, Waiting: Surviving the Two-Week Wait after an IVF Cycle

the embryo before implantation and its DNA is analyzed for abnormali-
ties. This procedure is expensive, and not all centers do PGD (see
Chapter 16 for more about PGD). Plus PGD has never been shown to
improve overall pregnancy rates.
 The embryos could be damaged during the process of growth in the 
lab and in the actual transfer itself. Man-made processes are never going
to be as effective as nature intended, and occasionally, a bad batch of
medium, which is used to nurture the embryos before transfer, causes
the embryo not to grow the way it should.
There might have been a problem with the uterus. There isn’t any way to
test the endometrium during the actual cycle, because an endometrial
biopsy would damage the lining and might actually prevent the implan-
tation, but it is possible to measure the thickness of the lining to make sure
it is at least 7 mm. It is also important to check the cavity to make sure
there aren’t any fibroids or polyps that might interfere with implantation.
Other than these two tests, there isn’t any other testing that has proven
to be useful. Nevertheless, there is always a chance that the embryos
found a bad spot in the uterus and failed to implant. This is thought to
be a relatively rare situation, however.
Things may have gone poorly during the actual embryo transfer
process. As previously mentioned, a traumatic transfer (where there
might have been cramping and/or bleeding during the procedure) are
associated with decreased pregnancy rates. But even when everything
seems to go well, it is possible that the uterus will have cramping and
move the embryos to a spot where they’re less likely to implant. How to
get around this problem? The only way is to try again.
Questions for God and your doctor 
(who are not one and the same)
An unsuccessful attempt at IVF can be devastating financially, physically, and
emotionally. It opens up the floodgates for a host of worries and fears that
can be overwhelming. For this reason, your best thinking probably doesn’t
come on the day of or the day after an unsuccessful attempt. You need to put
some time and space between the cycle and your next steps. Remember that
your hormone levels are probably off kilter as well. They’ll eventually return
to normal and probably your mood will, too, as the days pass.
As you prepare your list of questions for your doctor, try to be as specific as
possible. “What went wrong?” may be a good question with which to start,
but you’re better off breaking this broad question down into more specific
questions, such as the following:
280
Part IV: Moving Up to High-Tech Conception 

 Did I respond as expected?
 How was my egg quality?
 What particular stage in the process did you feel posed the most 
problems?
 What did you learn about me and my situation through this process?
 What would you recommend as a next step? Why?
Remember that your doctor is not God and doesn’t have all the answers that
you may want. Fertility is a numbers game, under the best of circumstances.
If doctors knew exactly why it all worked or didn’t work, they would save you
and themselves a lot of time and make a lot more money. Unfortunately, medi-
cine doesn’t have all the answers, for anything, including fertility.
Your doctor may be a great source of comfort, but consider taking the
“Why me?” question to a therapist, a religious person, or God. Use your
doctor for the knowledge that she does have and seek other avenues for
the answers that your doctor doesn’t have.
Going through the grief process
Perhaps the best way to deal with the morass of emotions brought on by an
unsuccessful cycle is by looking at the grief process. Elisabeth Kubler-Ross,
the author of On Death and Dying, identified the five stages of grief following the
death of a loved one: denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance.
The death of a dream, even if it’s only a temporary condition, is much the
same. You can treat this disappointment as a loss, and some women even
liken it to miscarriage. Consider the following stages and how they may apply:
 Denial: “Maybe the test results are wrong, and I really am pregnant,” you
may say. Denial is perhaps one of the most time-honored human tradi-
tions in dealing with painful situations. Although denial provides you
with a brief respite from your pain, it isn’t something that can success-
fully carry you out of your grief. Realizing that you’re not pregnant (after
your doctor has confirmed it), no matter how much you want to be, is
the first step.
 Anger: “My doctor doesn’t care” or “Somebody messed up” may be a
typical response. Anger is also a perfectly natural and understandable
response to grief. You may find that, as your emotions (and hormones)
subside with time, your anger may not seem as urgent. Remember that
physical force or verbal intimidation are never appropriate, no matter
how angry you are. If you feel this way, you need some time to cool off
and perhaps some professional help to do so.
281
Chapter 17: Waiting, Waiting: Surviving the Two-Week Wait after an IVF Cycle

 Bargaining: “If only I could be pregnant, I would never again (pick one)
yell at my mother, slack off at work, speed, or engage in any other bad
habits.” Bargaining is similar to foxhole prayers, those pleas for help
that come at desperate times. It’s also a normal reaction to grief, albeit
not a very useful one. Allow yourself time to move through this stage
(as with all of the stages that you experience). This too shall pass.
 Depression: “I’m not pregnant. I’ll never have a baby. My life is worth-
less.” Also known as “stinking thinking,” depression can cast a cloud
over your thoughts and feelings. This is another (normal) stage of grief
that often doesn’t let you take into account the positive realities in your
life. If your depression lasts longer than two weeks, consider seeking
professional help, whether from your doctor or a therapist. She or he
may prescribe antidepressants to get you through this difficult time. 
 Acceptance: Remember that acceptance doesn’t equate to agreement.
You may accept your circumstances as they are today and yet continue
to feel that the situation is unfair — and it is. Remember that you can
change your circumstances now that you’ve passed through your period
of mourning.
You may go through these stages of grief more than once. You may skip a
stage or repeat it twice before you come to accept what has happened.
Regardless, don’t rush yourself. You’ll get there when you get there, and 
not a moment sooner.
Taking time out for you and your partner
While you’re grieving, your partner may be grieving as well. He may be stuck
in a particular stage of the process, such as denial or anger. Look for signs
that he may need some additional help to work through his feelings.
After you’re both past the initial shock and grief, consider taking some time
out to relax and regroup, in that order. Although you may be tempted to
resume your normal routine, your body, mind, and spirit will benefit from a
little R&R. Your relationship will, too. Grief can be a very personal thing and
one that isolates you from the most important people in your life, including
your partner. Take the time to reconnect with one another and appreciate
those things that you love in each other. A one-month hiatus will not make a
difference in the big picture. However, not taking the time to recoup and
renew yourself and your partnership could have lasting effects.
Use your follow-up doctor’s visit as a springboard to discuss your future
plans with your partner. Remember that you’re both playing on the same
team. If your goals appear to be different at this point, give one another the
282
Part IV: Moving Up to High-Tech Conception 

space and time to consider both sides. If you need help arriving at a mutually
agreeable decision, you may want to consider visiting a therapist or a reli-
gious adviser. 
Keeping Embryos Frozen — What’s 
Their Expiration Date?
If you have embryos frozen from a fresh cycle, you may be concerned that if
you don’t use ’em, you’ll lose ’em. This thought may have you rushing into
another cycle before you’re emotionally ready, or doing another cycle soon
after you deliver Baby Number 1.
While there’s nothing wrong with doing a frozen embryo transfer as soon as
you’re ready, you don’t have to worry that your embryos will get freezer burn
if left in the tank too long. Embryos have been successfully thawed and cre-
ated perfectly normal children even after being frozen for ten years.
Some clinics are imposing time limits on keeping embryos frozen because 
of limited storage capacity. Your clinic will tell you how long they’ll store
embryos at the time of freezing (and will have you sign a consent form to
make sure you understand the implications).
Giving Up on Fertility Treatments?
Considering When to Let Go
“When to say when” may come sooner for some infertility patients because 
of basic reasons: a lack of money, time, or opportunity. But even for those
who’ve figured out ways to juggle limited resources a little bit longer, know-
ing when to say when still isn’t easy. A good friend of hers counseled Jackie
one day when she felt she couldn’t take the fertility treatments anymore.
“When do I give up?” Jackie cried to her over the phone. 
“When you just can’t walk another step,” her friend replied firmly.
283
Chapter 17: Waiting, Waiting: Surviving the Two-Week Wait after an IVF Cycle

Jackie had moments and even days when she felt that she couldn’t take one
more blood test or one more ultrasound or answer one more phone call.
During those times, the wonderful support of her online network, friends, and
family helped her through. It often took what felt like a Herculean effort to do
the next right thing when it came to fertility. Along the way, however, Jackie
also “gave up” in little pieces. By her last cycle (the one that worked after
three-and-a-half years), she had put away her extensive filing system in which
she cataloged every test result. Instead of comparing her daily results to past
results, she stuffed the files into the bottom of a cabinet and just looked at
the day in front of her. Was she giving up or letting go? Perhaps a little bit of
both. And although the cycle was successful, she realized that it was not
because she let go. Letting go at the time was her only option in order to 
continue taking the necessary steps.
For many people, giving up and letting go are one and the same. For Jackie,
both actions allowed her to take the responsibility and the results off herself,
where they don’t belong anyway. This attitude allowed her to continue with-
out a death grip on every last detail, many of which are truly insignificant in
the long run.
Let go if you can, sooner rather than later. Doing so helps you maintain your
spirit throughout the process, whether it is short or long. And, if this stops
working, and you just can’t walk another step, consider your other options.

Reproduction
In This Chapter
 Using donor sperm, donor eggs, or donor embryos
 Considering a gestational carrier or surrogate
 Taking proper precautions before going the third-party route
 Having a baby as a single or gay parent
 Deciding whether to share the news
T
he traditional family of mom, dad, and 2.7 children has changed consider-
ably over the past few decades. Families today may contain biological
children, adopted children, children with single parents of either sex, gay par-
ents, children born with the help of third parties from donor eggs, sperm, or
embryos, as well as children carried through pregnancy by their grandmother,
their aunt, or a total stranger.
The legal and emotional issues involved with using eggs, sperm, or uteri 
from someone else can be tricky. In this chapter, we tell you how to decide
whether third-party — or even fourth- or fifth-party! — reproduction is right
for you, and how to proceed after you make your decision.
Deciding to Use Donor Eggs, 
Sperm, or Embryos
Deciding to use donor eggs, embryos, or sperm is a difficult decision that
opens up a host of emotional issues and legal issues. Usually, you make this
decision because you have to — because one or both of you has a fertility
issue that can’t be fixed. Or you make the decision because you’re a same-sex
couple or a single parent; obviously, you need some type of donor in these
cases.

If you’re moving to donor eggs or sperm because you have an unfixable prob-
lem, you need to come to terms with your loss before moving on. As an infer-
tility nurse, Sharon saw couples move too quickly to donor eggs and sperm
and then struggle with their feelings about being pregnant with a child not
biologically their own. Donor eggs or sperm will always be available; don’t
jump in before you’re sure that you’re emotionally ready.
If you decide to use donor eggs or sperm, the child created will be related to
one of you. Is this fact going to be a problem if you and your partner separate
down the road? Is it something that one of you might fling in the other’s face
if the child has a serious health problem, or ends up in trouble with the law?
Will the fact that one of you can see family features in your child’s face while
the other can’t become a source of friction? You need to consider these ques-
tions, as well as any others that cross your mind, before you make the leap.
Protecting Yourselves — the Least You
Should Do If You’re Using a Donor
Before entering into any type of donor situation that we describe in this chap-
ter, whether it involves eggs, embryos, or sperm, you need to do several things:
 Thoroughly check out the donor’s health history but realize that a
clean slate is no guarantee against a host of other potential problems.
For starters, we can only test for those diseases that we’re aware of
today. New communicable diseases and new strains of old ones, not able
to be tested for today, may be uncovered in the future. 
 Be aware of the limitations of genetic tests. While most centers test for
the most common genetic diseases such as cystic fibrosis or sickle cell
anemia, they may only test for the most frequently recognized muta-
tions. While this covers the majority of cases, there may still remain as
many as 10 percent to 20 percent of rare mutations that are not tested
for. Certain populations, such as Native Americans, tend to carry more
remote, albeit just as harmful, mutations of diseases such as cystic fibro-
sis. These would only be found via extensive screening, which would
need to be done at your request and on your bankroll as well.
 If you’re a known carrier of a genetic disease, be sure your donor is
tested for these specific diseases. Less common genetic illnesses, such
as Tay-Sachs disease or Maple Syrup Urine Disease are generally not
tested for in the standard centers. 
288
Part V: The Road Less Traveled . . . So Far! 

 Be aware of the testing differences between donor sperm and donor
eggs. While donor sperm is frozen and quarantined for six months after
initial testing, donor eggs are a different egg altogether! Because eggs
aren’t quarantined after the initial infectious disease testing, there’s a
small chance that infectious disease could be transmitted to their recipi-
ent. While you may be able to rule out the likelihood of certain diseases
by your donor’s lifestyle, partnership, or health history, remember that
you’re going on her word and that of the clinic compiling her information.
 Do some soul searching. Only you know how you really feel about using
another person’s eggs, embryos, or sperm. Think it all the way through —
past the cute baby stage into the teenage years and beyond.
 Decide who to tell. You may change your mind later about telling (or
not telling) your child and others that you used donor eggs or sperm. If
you must tell someone about your decision, make sure that the person
or people you tell are supportive and can keep a secret until you’re ready
for the news to go public.
 Put things in writing. If you’re using donor eggs, embryos, or sperm,
make sure that your clinic’s legal documents are thorough. If they’re not,
get a lawyer to write up a document. Think ahead and consider things
such as divorce. You may think that you and your partner will never sep-
arate, and it is hoped you won’t, but it’s always a possibility. You owe it
to yourselves and your potential child to be prepared.
If you’re using a gestational carrier or surrogate (see “Borrowing a
Uterus for the Next Nine Months,” later in this chapter), make sure that
everything is in writing. Everything. Legally controlling another person’s
actions is very difficult, so bring up just about any possibility you can
think of. Having something in writing may save you from some heart-
break down the road.
289
Chapter 18: Challenges of Third-Party Reproduction
Reviewing the current FDA regulations 
for gamete donation
In 2005, the FDA (Food and Drug Administration)
implemented stringent new rules regarding
donation of oocytes and embryos. The new reg-
ulations mean that egg donors must be tested
for a number of communicable diseases no
more than 30 days before their eggs are
retrieved. Couples who may wish to donate
their embryos in the future also need to com-
plete testing within 30 days before egg retrieval.

Borrowing from the Bank — 
the Sperm Bank, That Is
Donor sperm has been used for artificial insemination for more than 100
years. About 50,000 children are born each year as a result of donor sperm
insemination, also known as TDI (therapeutic donor insemination) or AID
(artificial insemination — donor). Sperm banks are licensed by the state in
which they’re located, and they have stringent requirements for donors.
Sperm banks should be certified by the American Association of Tissue Banks.
Why fewer couples are using donor sperm
Use of donor sperm has decreased since 1992, when it became possible to
inseminate an egg with a single carefully selected “ideal” sperm (as ideal as
existed in the male’s sample, anyway) in a process known as intracytoplasmic
sperm injection, or ICSI. (See Chapter 11 for more about ICSI.) Men whose
sperm counts were very low, or those with poor sperm motility, or move-
ment, could now become biological parents — as long as they could afford 
to do in vitro insemination.
Many couples, however, can’t afford, or don’t want to do IVF, so they use
donor sperm. Also, those men who have no sperm at all, such as those with
Sertoli cell only syndrome, (see Chapter 11 for more on this syndrome) still
depend on donor sperm to become parents.
Picking “dad” from a catalog
Picking donor sperm can be similar to buying a house; it sounds like fun until
you have to really do it! Then the “what if I choose wrong” fears start to set in
and the process becomes more nerve wracking than fun.
Choosing the right biological father for your future child is far more impor-
tant than buying a house, but many of the same caveats apply. Don’t be too
heavily swayed by externals, don’t let fear of the unknown keep you from
making a decision at all, and don’t agonize over your decision once you’ve
made it! These next sections can help you understand the donor sperm
process and help you choose the best man for the job.
290
Part V: The Road Less Traveled . . . So Far! 

Reviewing donor requirements
In case you were thinking that sperm donation might be a way of making a
little extra money, here’s a list of requirements for donors from some of the
most popular donor sperm centers with the most stringent requirements:
 Height: Most people request a donor between 5 feet 10 inches and 6 feet
2 inches.
 Weight: The donor’s weight should be proportionate to his height.
 Age: The donor should be between the ages of 19 and 39.
 Education: The donor should be a graduate of a four-year college, or at
least have completed two years of college.
 Sperm specs: The donor must have 70 percent motile, or moving, sperm,
60 percent with normal appearance (morphology), and a sperm count 
of 70 million/milliliter. A donor must have better than average sperm
because some will be lost in the freeze-and-thaw process.
Donor sperm can be frozen nearly indefinitely. They’re kept in liquid nitrogen
containers and shipped out when requested. The cost for a vial of donor sperm
runs about $150 to $300, or more if you have specific requests, such as a
Nobel Peace Prize winner. Most clinics suggest that you order at least three
vials at a time.
Testing donors and taking precautions
Here are some common precautions taken to ensure you receive good sperm:
 Infectious disease testing: The donor is tested for all infectious diseases
as well as certain genetic diseases, depending on his genetic background.
He’s also required to fill out a very detailed questionnaire about his back-
ground, his family background, his interests, and his likes and dislikes.
He may be asked to submit a baby picture.
One center, concerned about donors bringing in a “ringer” to produce 
a specimen for them, has the donor’s hands recorded on a three-
dimensional biometric device. The donor then has to “sign in” and
match the hand key before he’s allowed to produce. Of course, this
assures the bank that all of the specimens for a given donor match up
with his blood tests, and so on.
 Use of frozen sperm: Because the risk of disease transmission is too
high, sperm banks no longer use fresh sperm. Instead, sperm are now
frozen and the donor retested for infectious disease before the sperm
are released for use — usually a waiting period of six months.
291
Chapter 18: Challenges of Third-Party Reproduction

 Number of children a donor can father: The American Society for
Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) guidelines suggest that a donor be
allowed to father no more than ten children, to avoid, it is hoped,
unknowing incest between half-siblings 20 years down the road. Sperm
banks routinely follow up with questionnaires to centers using donor
sperm to ask whether the donation resulted in a live birth.
Ordering sperm
You can choose between sperm that has not been washed, and is therefore
only ready for intracervical insemination (ICI ready) or sperm that’s already
been washed and is therefore ready for intrauterine insemination (IUI ready).
The technique for IUI, which injects the sperm directly into the uterus, is more
complicated, but most centers report a higher pregnancy rate with IUI than
ICI. Pregnancy rates for women under 35 are about 10 to 20 percent per insem-
ination; rates decrease for women over 40 to 5 to 10 percent per insemination.
Some fertility centers prefer that the patients bring in ICI sperm, and then do
the sperm washing themselves, because they feel that it gives them a better
specimen; check with your center before ordering one or the other type.
Remaining anonymous
Estimates show that only one child in ten is ever informed that he or she is
the result of donor insemination, but times may be changing. Some donor
clinics now advertise that they have donors open to having some contact
with any children born — some say after the child reaches age 18, and others
are open to an ongoing relationship. Several recent court cases have ques-
tioned the sperm donor’s right to remain anonymous, and at least one coun-
try, Sweden, has made it illegal to keep the donor anonymous.
Asking someone you know to donate
Some parents-to-be choose a donor they know, perhaps a brother or close
friend of the intended dad. In these cases, fresh sperm can be used. However,
if the insemination is done by a doctor’s office, the doctor should insist on
having all infectious disease testing up to date.
Fresh sperm have a higher pregnancy rate than frozen, and this fact may be a
consideration if you have a relative or friend who’s willing to donate. Keep in
mind that the donor will need to be tested for infectious diseases. Most clin-
ics will still prefer that the sperm be frozen and quarantined, and in this case
there will be a waiting period of six months before the sperm can be used.
This gives the clinic time to retest for infectious diseases — many infectious
diseases (like HIV) take up to six months to show up in the blood. Many cen-
ters won’t use fresh sperm at all, but its use is within the new FDA guidelines.
292
Part V: The Road Less Traveled . . . So Far! 

With known-donor insemination, of course, the chance that the child will find
out the truth about his conception is much higher, because more people are
involved in the process. For some couples, the psychological issues may be
too complicated for them to handle. However, couples who want a genetic
match that’s as close as possible, and who can handle the psychological
problems, may find this method to be a good solution.
Although such a topic may be difficult to discuss, some type of legal docu-
ment should be drawn up. This document should address such issues as how
much say the donor will have in the child’s upbringing, how much contact
he’ll have with the child, and whether he’ll have legal rights to the child if
anything happens to you.
Of course, you may never experience any emotional or legal problems as a
result of this donation. The donor may see your child as just another niece 
or nephew and never give it a second thought. You know your own family
best, but covering the possibility of interference down the road is always 
a good idea.
What if your partner’s father is interested in being your donor? This happens
more often than you might think. He is a genetic link, but remember that
grandparents in general can be too outspoken about your child’s upbringing.
(Why do you let that kid have so many cookies? Why do you let him scream
like that?) Ask yourself whether his being the silent “parent” as well as the
grandparent may cause problems in your relationship.
Using Donor Eggs
Unlike sperm donation, which has been around for decades, the use of donor
eggs is a relatively newer phenomenon (the first baby after donor egg was
born in 1984). It required the invention and perfection of in vitro fertilization
(IVF) in order to become practical. (See Part IV for complete information
about IVF.) Egg donation is a growing national trend, with approximately
30,000 babies born in the United States as a result.
The reasons for using donor eggs are similar to those for using donor sperm.
The recipient either doesn’t make eggs or doesn’t make good eggs. This lack
of good eggs may be due to premature ovarian failure or age, or the woman
may carry a lethal gene or chromosome disorder that she doesn’t want to
risk passing on. Because female age is so important in fertility, and because
egg donation obviates the role of the age of the mother (recipient), egg dona-
tion has dramatically altered the fertility potential of women over 40.
293
Chapter 18: Challenges of Third-Party Reproduction

Getting donor eggs
Perhaps you’re wondering how you can obtain donor eggs. You have several
options:
 You can be matched with a paid IVF donor at your clinic. These
women donate all their eggs to one or possibly two recipients for a fee.
 Use a broker. Brokers can also be found on the Internet by using a
search engine, under “donor eggs.” One large site is www.eggdonor.com.
Sharon personally likes www.awomans gift.com. This is currently the
most common form of egg donation because most clinics have given up
recruiting their own donors. The advantage of brokers is that they pro-
vide more choice of donors; the disadvantage is that they add consider-
able cost.
 You can be matched with a fellow infertility patient at your clinic.
This woman will agree to share half her eggs with you in exchange for
your paying her IVF costs. Few women under 35 are infertile because
they have “bad eggs.” More often, there are sperm problems or blocked
tubes, fibroids, or other uterine abnormalities. The availability of this
type of donation varies widely from center to center, with some centers
favoring this type of arrangements, while others may not offer it at all.
 Find a willing friend or relative. If you’re fortunate enough to have a
friend or relative who agrees to donate eggs to you, you’ll both be
screened through your clinic for infectious diseases, and then your
cycles will be coordinated so that you can have a fresh embryo transfer.
This is the second most common form of egg donation. The obvious
advantage of using a relative is that she shares some fraction of your
DNA. In the case of a sister donor, you share 50 percent of your DNA –
and the child will have the same grandparents as if you were the genetic
parent. Furthermore, because your husband contributes 50 percent of
the genes, and your sister the other 50 percent, you can think of the
baby as 75 percent genetically “yours” as a couple.
Keeping the facts in mind
Although your reason for using egg donors is similar to that of using sperm
donors, differences do exist. Keep the following in mind when thinking about
using an egg donor:
 Using donor eggs is more complicated than using donor sperm; IVF cen-
ters usually try to coordinate the menstrual cycles of the egg donor and
recipient so that the recipient can transfer into her uterus fresh embryos
294
Part V: The Road Less Traveled . . . So Far! 

that were created a few days before in the IVF lab. This transfer requires
monitoring at an IVF center to make sure that the uterus is ready to
receive the embryos.
 Asking someone to be an egg donor is much more complicated than
asking someone to be a sperm donor. Egg donation involves several weeks
of injections, blood draws, ultrasounds, and, at some clinics, psychologi-
cal testing. Plus, you’ll need to explore the emotional and legal conse-
quences, just as you would if you were using donor sperm. You’ll also
need a lawyer to draw up a detailed legal contract; you should do this
even if you’re using someone you know.
 One disadvantage of donor eggs is that, unlike donor sperm, you don’t
know what you’re getting in advance. Because the egg donor is doing a
stimulated IVF cycle while you’re taking medication to be ready for
embryo transfer, you won’t know how many eggs you’ll get or their 
quality until a few days before your transfer.
 Although you may assume that a 22-year-old donor will make a good
number of eggs in an IVF cycle, that doesn’t always happen. Clinics usu-
ally have rules about what happens if your donor doesn’t stimulate well,
but chances are that you’ll still have to pay for the blood tests, medica-
tions, and ultrasound examinations that she had before the bad cycle
was diagnosed.
Finding donor eggs
Most clinics are still doing traditional donor egg programs; seniority on the
recipient list gets you first pick at the donor of your choice, all donors being
paid the same. However, a search of the Internet reveals a plethora of near
genius beauty queens ready to barter their eggs to the highest bidder.
If you really are looking for something very specific — say, a redhead 
because everyone in your family has red hair or a biracial donor if you’re
both biracial — the classifieds may be the way to go. Some centers have very
few black donors; others have very few Asian donors. A good place to adver-
tise is the campus newspaper or bulletin board in the student union at a
large, diverse college campus.
If you’re not looking for an exact match, get on the nearest clinic’s waiting
list. Eventually, you’ll have seniority on the list and will be able to find what
you’re looking for. 
Try some of the broker agencies, and do not assume that you have to restrict
yourself to local ones. Many out-of-state agencies are happy to have the
donor travel to your fertility center. When you consider the cost of donor
eggs (several thousand dollars), the additional cost of a flight and a couple of
nights in a hotel is not that much of a premium.
295
Chapter 18: Challenges of Third-Party Reproduction

Funding donor eggs
The cost of using donor eggs can vary tremendously, depending on what
you’re looking for. Are you looking for a Harvard grad with blonde hair and
blue eyes who stands 5 feet 7 inches tall and weighs 125 pounds and volunteers
at the nursing home once a week and bakes cookies for shut-ins in addition to
running her law practice and taking care of her adorable twins, picture avail-
able upon request? You may be able to find her, but it will cost you. Some
Grade-A egg donors are offering to donate eggs for a mere $5,000 per egg.
If you’re looking for a normal person, like yourself, you’ll probably pay
between $5,000 and $10,000 to your donor to do an IVF cycle — with 
10 to 15 eggs retrieved, one hopes.
The cost of the IVF cycle itself is between $5,000 and $10,000 in most clinics,
and the medications are an additional $3,000 to $4,000.
A donor egg cycle at your average IVF clinic costs from $13,000 to $18,000,
including medications, if you don’t have insurance. If you’re going the
designer route, the cost may be much more.
Checking out your donor
Most centers send out donor lists every month or every six weeks. The donor’s
physical characteristics and family history are listed, as well as education
level and current job. Also listed is her childbearing history. Most centers
accept anonymous donors only if they’re under 35 years old and have no
major health issues or inherited family disease. Most centers also have the
donor and her partner checked for all infectious diseases, such as HIV,
hepatitis B and C, syphilis, and gonorrhea. Some also do psychological
screenings to make sure that the donor fully understands the implications
of egg donation and is mentally stable enough to handle donating.
If you’re bringing a donor that you’ve found yourself to the clinic, she’ll most
likely be required to do all the same testing. If your donor is a relative, how-
ever, your clinic may allow you to waive some of the testing.
Signing the documents
You and your donor must sign legal consents. The donor signs that she’s vol-
untarily donating her eggs and won’t try to claim any parenting rights in the
future. This consent is required even if the donor is someone you know.
296
Part V: The Road Less Traveled . . . So Far! 

You sign that you’re voluntarily using donor eggs to create a child. You also
sign that you and your partner (if you aren’t a single parent) agree to be the
sole legal parents of the child and assume all costs for bearing and raising 
the child.
At present, a child born from donor sperm, eggs, or embryos is automatically
the child of the recipients and doesn’t need to be legally adopted by either
parent at birth.
Getting support
You can find numerous support groups on the Internet, not only for egg 
recipients but also for donors. Go to your favorite search engine, type in
“donor eggs,” and see what you get! If you have any questions or doubts
about donating eggs or receiving donor eggs, you should be able to find
plenty of people on the bulletin boards who can help you with your decision.
One bulletin board with an active following is found at www.network54.
com/Hide/Forum/57451.
If you want a more one-on-one approach, a family counselor who specializes 
in adoptions or other family situations may be very helpful; the phone book 
is a good place to look for family counselors, under “Counselors, Human
Relations.” You can also ask your fertility clinic for recommendations or con-
tact Resolve for suggestions. (We discuss Resolve in more detail in Chapter 8.)
Borrowing a Uterus for 
the Next Nine Months
Asking someone for the use of her eggs is one thing; she only has to commit
to a few weeks of time and discomfort. Asking someone to commit to your
cause for nine whole months by being a gestational carrier is quite another.
The use of gestational carriers has exploded with the advent of in vitro fertil-
ization. Women with health issues, women who lack a uterus, and women with
a history of recurrent miscarriage are among those who are using friends,
family, or total strangers to carry and deliver their biological children.
297
Chapter 18: Challenges of Third-Party Reproduction

Finding a willing woman
Some people love to be pregnant, and other people love to be pregnant as
long as they’re getting paid for it. Either type may be suitable as a gestational
carrier. Many women ask immediate family members first, but remember that
a “no” doesn’t mean that person doesn’t love you or want to help. Some women
see pregnancy as a nine-month misery and wouldn’t go through it if you
begged them; others truly enjoy being pregnant and welcome the chance to
help you out as well.
If your sister and best friend turn you down, you need to look a little further.
What if your mom wants to do this for you? Would you feel funny about her
giving birth to her grandchildren? How would you handle the local press?
(You can assume that there might be some, because this type of human inter-
est story is very popular with the press.)
If all possible friends or relatives are out, you may want to look on the
Internet, where gestational carriers place ads and, of course, all sound like
the salt of the earth. Again, some women love being pregnant and also don’t
mind the extra money. Others are just looking for the extra money.
Don’t sign up with the first wonderful sounding candidate without doing a lot
of research. Many women have even hired a private agent to check into the
carrier’s background. That’s not a bad idea; it’s easy on paper to say that
you’re something you’re really not!
If you want to go with a woman you don’t know, visit her home if possible.
And make sure that it is her home, not some place that she’s borrowed for a
few hours to make a good impression. If all this checking sounds sneaky and
untrusting, you’re right; it is. But the world is full of unscrupulous people
who have no problem taking advantage of a desperate couple wanting to
have a child. By far, the safest approach is to go with a surrogacy agency,
who first makes sure that the surrogate is psychologically screened, and then
provides ongoing psychological care. Such agencies also have attorneys who
draw up the paperwork and really can provide much-needed peace of mind.
Before a pregnancy occurs, you and your carrier should discuss genetic test-
ing during the pregnancy and pregnancy termination. Even though the baby
is genetically yours, the decision to undergo testing and/or end a pregnancy
is that of the carrier, regardless of legal contract. Make sure that you and your
carrier are on the same page on this difficult and touchy issue. If you’re not,
consider it a deal breaker. Make sure that the contract covers the issue of
selective termination as well; many people have very strong feelings, pro and
con, and you want to make sure you and your donor feel the same way.
298
Part V: The Road Less Traveled . . . So Far! 

Going through the process
You’ll have to do in vitro fertilization to use a gestational carrier because
you’ll be transferring embryos to her uterus. The carrier will usually take
Estrace, an estrogen pill, to thicken her uterine lining, for several weeks. The
embryos are then transferred to her uterus. You and your carrier can do syn-
chronized cycles so that the embryos can be transferred to her a few days
after your egg retrieval without first being frozen. Or you can do an egg
retrieval first, and freeze the embryos to transfer to the carrier a month or
even a year down the road. If you need an egg donor as well, the cycle will be
coordinated by the clinic using the donor’s eggs, your husband’s sperm, and
the surrogate’s uterus. This is more complex than traditional surrogacy (see
below) but is easier from a legal point of view because the surrogate is not
genetically related to the offspring.
Once the carrier gets pregnant, her pregnancy and delivery will proceed just
like any other. Most couples are in fairly close contact with the carrier during
the pregnancy, so that any problems that arise can be dealt with jointly. If
you’ve hired a carrier rather than using a friend or relative, you should have
a payment plan agreed on before doing the embryo transfer.
In most cases, the carrier agrees to let you be present for the delivery, so you
can see the baby right away. You need to know your state’s rules for petition-
ing to have your names on the birth certificate as the biological parents of
the baby. Your lawyer will be instrumental in getting the affidavits you’ll need
from the IVF center, verifying that the baby is your biological child.
After a short hospital stay, you take the baby home with you.
Traditional Surrogacy — 
the Road Less Traveled
Unlike gestational carriers, surrogates are both the egg donors and the preg-
nancy carriers. The good thing about traditional surrogacy is that it often
doesn’t require doing in vitro fertilization. The bad news is that you’re asking
for more than nine months out of a woman’s life — you’re also asking for her
biological child. Because the child born is the natural child of the surrogate,
you could find yourself without a leg to stand on legally if the surrogate
decides to keep the baby. Legal agreements, no matter how complete, may
not hold up in court if this happens.
299
Chapter 18: Challenges of Third-Party Reproduction

If the surrogate is a relative, you may have a greater trust in her to keep her
promise to give the baby to you after she delivers. But keep in mind that if
she does change her mind, you’re looking at a family nightmare from which
you may never recover.
States have different laws about the legality of surrogacy, and some states
specify that no money may change hands except to cover reasonable
expenses. You’ll most likely need to go through an adoption process after
delivery, which may involve a home study by an adoption agency.
Because of the risks of surrogacy, many couples use donor eggs from one
person and hire another to be the gestational carrier, in order to avoid the
risks of using a traditional surrogate. This route is more expensive, but it may
buy you some peace of mind about the likelihood of your carrier changing
her mind and keeping the baby.
Adopting at the Cellular Level — 
Embryo Donation 
Some clinics maintain lists of couples who want to donate their embryos to
another couple, usually because the donating couple has one or more chil-
dren through IVF and doesn’t want any more. Brokers also match unwanted
embryos with prospective parents via the Internet or through organizations
dedicated to egg and embryo donation. Screening ranges from no more than
infectious blood testing to a full-blown home study done by an adoption
agency; you also receive information about the donating parents and usually
some type of family genetic history.
When you use donor embryos, you’re essentially adopting a child; the differ-
ence between this and traditional adoption is that you get to experience the
pregnancy and delivery just as if this were your genetic child. Your name is
on the birth certificate, and unless you give out the information, no one will
know that you used donor embryos. Some couples find it easier emotionally
to have a child who’s not related to either one of them, rather than using
donor eggs or sperm.
Of course, this method again brings up the possibility of legal questions,
moral issues, and possible complications a few years down the road. At the
time of this writing, no cases have been filed of biological parents going to
court to get their children back after their birth. But that doesn’t mean that it
couldn’t happen in the future, despite the paperwork that parents sign when
they donate their embryos.
300
Part V: The Road Less Traveled . . . So Far! 

Using donor embryos is fairly simple from a medical point of view. The 
procedure requires doing a frozen embryo transfer at an IVF clinic. This 
cycle requires minimal medication, usually just estrogen pills before the
transfer and progesterone after the transfer to maintain the pregnancy.
However, the legal issues associated with donor embryos can be quite 
complex; for example, if the child should be born with an abnormality, 
the potential for a lawsuit is considerable. For this reason, many fertility 
clinics have shied away from embryo donation.
Telling the Family or Keeping 
It to Yourself
Will you tell your family? That depends on you, your family, and a host of
other factors that only you know. Some people don’t even tell their families
that they’re doing IVF, much less tell them that they’re using donor eggs.
Donor sperm have been utilized for more than 30 years, and evidence shows
that most parents do not tell the child that his father isn’t his biological parent.
It seems likely that some families won’t talk about using donor eggs, either,
although in a recent study, just over half the parents surveyed indicated that
they planned to tell the child eventually.
It’s possible that somewhere down the line, your child will find out that he’s
the product of donor eggs or sperm, even if you don’t want him to. It may
happen in high school biology, where students often test their blood types.
Or it may happen when your child develops a rare inherited disease, and you
need to go back to his biological family for information.
Keeping a secret like this is difficult, but dealing with negative family reac-
tions, if there are any, is difficult too. If you tell your child, you’ll cry inside
every time he says, “You’re not my real mother!” and if you don’t tell, you’ll
cringe every times he says, “I wish I had a different mother!” All children say
things like this, whether they’re adopted, biological, or whatever; take it with
a grain of salt!
Utilizing a Registry
You’ve seen the show one hundred times. Mothers, fathers, brothers, sisters
meeting in a tearful on-air display of how technology can help locate and
reunite long-lost relatives. Will this become commonplace in the case of
301
Chapter 18: Challenges of Third-Party Reproduction

donor eggs, sperm, and embryos in the future? Most gamete donors in the
past had no intention of maintaining any contact with their future offspring,
and most parents of children conceived through donor gametes weren’t inter-
ested in future contact, either. Is this changing? Will everyone be able to
maintain anonymity in the future, when information once secreted away in
confidential files is available to anyone who can hack into a computer?
Today, you can find thousands of internet sites under sibling registry, parent
registry, donor registry, and so on. Donors, parents, siblings, and children
can be registered with agencies that will put interested parties together in
the future. While these sites have traditionally been utilized mostly for
adopted children and the biological parents, the future may find gamete
donors and their offspring being reunited as well.
The downside to all of this? Plenty! Many parents who choose donor options
desire to remain in the “No Tell” camp. This could be challenging if/when a
half sibling or a biological relative comes to call. At the moment, both parties,
for example, parent/relative and child must be searching to find one another.
But with the improvement of tracking tools on the internet, this caveat might
cease to exist. Some men who assumed that the details of their donation to a
sperm bank a few decades ago were permanently locked away have been sur-
prised to find that the women to whom they donated to feel that they, and
their children, have a right to know who they are. 
For this reason, donor and adoption agencies are being forced to be crystal
clear regarding the issue of disclosure. The exception to the “closed at all
costs” status has sometimes been used when the issue of medical necessity
arises. Should a donor be found to have a hereditary or genetic condition,
requiring notification or treatment for his/her offspring, some agencies will
contact the recipients and inform them without putting the two parties in
contact with one another directly.
Getting Pregnant When 
You’re Single or Gay
It’s never been easier to have a child if you’re a single parent or in a same sex
relationship, with sperm banks available to single or gay women and the use
of gestational carriers and egg donors available to single or gay men. (See the
section “Borrowing From the Bank — The Sperm Bank, That Is” for info on
finding donor sperm.)
302
Part V: The Road Less Traveled . . . So Far! 

Finding sperm
If you’re a single or gay woman, you’re going to find it easier to have a baby
than a single man — you’ve got the right equipment! All you need is the sperm,
and sperm is something that’s readily available, whether you want to use an
anonymous donor or a close friend.
If you’re considering using a friend as your donor, here are some of the 
benefits:
 You’re most likely aware of the person’s personality traits.
 You know what he looks like.
 You probably like the person, or you wouldn’t be asking him to do this
for you.
Alas, where you find pros, you also find cons. Here are some of the potential
complications that come from using a donor you know over one who remains
anonymous:
 How involved will he be in your child’s life? No involvement, holiday
visits, or heavy involvement?
 If your parenting techniques differ, how much input will he have on how
you raise your child?
 If something happens to you, will he be the legal guardian?
If you’re thinking of using an anonymous donor, consider the following pros:
 You won’t have to worry about the father wanting to be involved with
the child.
 You can be very picky about physical characteristics and other attributes.
On the con side, consider these issues:
 You’ll have to rely on what the catalog says about the donor, with no
way of knowing how accurate the information really is.
 You won’t be able to tell your child much about his paternal heritage.
 It may be difficult for your child to be able to contact his birth father, if
he wants to.
303
Chapter 18: Challenges of Third-Party Reproduction

Even if you don’t foresee any complications down the road, writing up a legal
document to cover your bases is always a wise idea. 
If you’re using fresh sperm from a known donor, you need to be aware of the
risk of contracting an infectious disease such as HIV or hepatitis. It’s much
wiser to use a frozen specimen after having your donor tested at the time the
specimen is frozen, and then tested again six months later. If he’s still nega-
tive, you can use the frozen specimen.
Never try to do an intracervical or intrauterine insemination at home! You
can place the sperm near the cervix but not inside it! 
Finding eggs and a uterus
Things are certainly more complicated if you’re a guy or gay couple trying to
have a baby without a female partner. You just can’t do it alone! If you want to
be a dad, the first thing you need to find is a mother. You may want to ask a
friend, or you may want to hire a surrogate who’ll carry the baby for you and
then relinquish all parental rights to you. A traditional surrogate is both the
biological mother of the baby and the person who carries the baby through-
out the pregnancy; a gestational carrier is not the biological mother. (See
“Borrowing a Uterus for the Next Nine Months” for more on surrogates.)
If your surrogate is married, the child, when born, may be presumed to be
legally her husband’s in some states. You may have to adopt your own child.
Legal issues should be written up by a lawyer who’s well versed in surrogacy
in the state where the baby will be born, because that state’s laws will govern
your experience. Many of the laws that govern gay parent surrogacy also
cover a single male’s use of a surrogate or carrier, with California being the
most liberal state.
Your lawyer will need to submit affidavits to the court from your clinic, your
carrier or surrogate, and you to help establish paternity for the birth certifi-
cate. Some states require DNA testing to establish paternity; others don’t.
If you want to use a gestational carrier, you’ll have to utilize IVF; the eggs of
one woman can be fertilized (see the “Using Donor Eggs” section for all the
details on donor eggs), and the resulting embryo can be transferred to the
gestational carrier. This method, of course, is much more expensive than 
traditional surrogacy, because you have to pay both the gestational carrier
and the egg donor, not to mention the IVF center. You’re looking at spending
$40,000 or more.

Part V: The Road Less Traveled . . . So Far! 

Finding the right clinic
Not all fertility clinics will work with singles or gays. One place to look for
information is the National Center for Chronic Disease and Health Promotion’s
“Reproductive Health Information Source” (www.cdc.gov/nccdphp/drh/
ART99/index99.htm). Under the section “Clinic Services and Profiles,” you
find basic information as to whether the clinics work with donor egg patients,
gestational carriers, or singles. If you live in a rural or particularly conserva-
tive area, you may have to travel to get the job done. The American Fertility
Association (www.theafa.org) now has a gay/lesbian resource section on
their website (under “LGBT family building”).
After you have your list of possibilities, mention your specific circumstances
during your first phone call. You want to make sure that your doctor is sup-
portive of your situation before you make an appointment.

 Dealing with grief
 Choosing adoption
 Deciding to be happily child free
F
or some people, the road to biological childbearing closes early. A severe
male factor (such as a total absence of sperm), lack of a uterus or ovaries,
or other structural problems may make biological parenthood impossible.
Other couples invest months or years, along with huge sums of money, seek-
ing biological parenthood, only to end up at the same roadblock.
How you get to this point isn’t important. What matters is making decisions
about what road to take next. You may choose to adopt, and after you make
that decision, you need to make many more. Do you want to adopt interna-
tionally, interracially, through a public agency, or from a private source?
Do you want a newborn or an older child?
You may choose instead to work with children as a teacher or social worker,
or as a foster parent. Or you may decide that you can live a fulfilling life with-
out children. In this chapter, we show you how to evaluate your choices and
find the path that’s right for you — when you’re ready.
Deciding to Let Go of the Dream
Jackie was sure that she had finally had enough. This realization came about
three weeks prior to the start of the successful cycle that brought Jackie 
her beautiful daughter Ava. Less than halfway through that cycle, which she
referred to as a “goat rodeo” for all that went wrong, Jackie had decided that
she could not take another step. She fought with her doctor, nurse (also known
as coauthor Sharon Perkins), husband, and anyone else who would listen to
her complain. She knew that she had reached her endpoint. Luckily, the light
at the end of the tunnel wasn’t a train. But then again, it generally never is.

Everyone reaches points in their lives when they instinctively know that they
can’t take another step. The process of infertility is no exception. The trick is
knowing when you have reached the end of the line, or when a well deserved
break may be in order (we discuss ways to take a respite in Chapter 9).
But if you have truly gotten to that point of no return where you can’t fathom
another test, another shot, another phone call — regardless of the outcome,
it’s time to do something different. 
Letting go is never easy, and the higher the stakes, the more difficult the
process. 
Going through the grief process 
Grief is one of life’s most difficult emotions. Despite the fact that you may
have many people around who are willing and able to help, grief can cause
you to feel isolated, desperate, and hopeless. Either extreme of avoiding grief
or immersing yourself in it can lead to depression, which actually stops you
from moving through, and beyond, the grief process. As clichéd as it may
sound, you can get through it, and time will help.
Perhaps the best way to deal with the morass of emotions brought on by the
loss of the dream of a biological child is by looking at the grief process.
Elisabeth Kubler-Ross, the author of On Death and Dying, identified the five
stages of grief following the death of a loved one: denial, anger, bargaining,
depression, and acceptance. The death of a dream is much the same. 
You may go through these stages of grief more than once. You may skip a
stage or repeat it twice before you come to accept what has happened.
Working through the grief process of not having a biological child takes time.
And unfortunately, it’s hard to hurry up the process no matter how much you
want it to be over. The only way past grief is through it. But you don’t have to
do it alone.
Knowing when to get help
While grief is a process to move through, many people can get stuck in it 
as well. Figuring out whether you are stuck or not can be tricky and often
requires the input of your friends, family, and even colleagues who might 
be more objective in offering you a reality check. Asking your partner or 
a trusted friend to help you figure out if you’re dealing with your grief or
dwelling on it too much can help give you clarity on what to do next. Friends,
family, support groups, and books can help to buoy you through the process. 
308
Part V: The Road Less Traveled . . . So Far! 

It’s easy to isolate yourself when you’re feeling the kind of pain brought on 
by grief. If you find that you can’t even bring yourself to check in with those
around you, you could probably use some guidance. If you are beset with the
‘Why Me’s?’ that have you questioning yourself, your faith, and life as you
know it, you would likely benefit from the wisdom that a pastor, priest, rabbi,
or cleric may be able to provide. If your feelings of grief have become feeling
of despair and hopelessness, particularly of the type that have you contem-
plating doing harm to yourself or someone else, you need help, and fast. 
Professional help is a wonderful option for those whose hope switch is tem-
porarily stuck in the off position. You might ask your family physician, fertil-
ity specialist, or nurse to recommend a therapist to help you work through
your emotions. It’s not about finding someone to tell you that your dreams
can come true; it’s working to re-tool those dreams to better fit your circum-
stances. You can be happy again and you will, provided you deal with that
which ails you. Don’t be alarmed if a professional suggests antidepressants.
This treatment, like your depression, may be a temporary situation. Whether
medication or talk therapy, you can find relief during this difficult time.
Opting to Adopt
A life without biological children doesn’t mean a life without any children.
Many children, both in the United States and abroad, need parents to love
and care for them. Adoption is a tree with many branches, and you need to
first decide for what kind of child you’re looking. Are you open to adopting an
older child or one with physical handicaps? Are you interested in a child of
another race? Or are you willing to keep all your options open and try several
different routes at one time?
More than 120,000 children are adopted each year in the United States.
Nearly half, about 40 percent, are adopted by step-parents or other relatives.
Ninety percent of adoptions are domestic, and the other 10 percent come
from foreign adoptions. Some adoptions are open adoptions, meaning that
the adoptive and birth parents meet and continue to have some involvement
in one another’s lives. Other adoptions are arranged through established
public agencies and usually don’t include any contact between birth and
adoptive families. Adoption can cost anywhere from a few dollars to thou-
sands of dollars. We look briefly at different types of adoption.
Web sites such as www.adoption.com also contain adoption forums, waiting
children information, and ads for prospective adoptive parents. The National
Adoption Information Clearinghouse (NAIC) can be found at www.calib.
com/naic and also contains information on every aspect of adoption.
309
Chapter 19: Moving On

Traditional domestic adoption
When most people think about adoption, they think about traditional domes-
tic adoption. An old movie, Penny Serenade, details the typical scenario: A
couple is unable to have children, so they go through the process of adopting
a Caucasian infant. The film contains the traditional themes — parents-to-be
are evaluated by a strict social worker, and the baby is almost taken away
because the hopeful father lost his job and income before the adoption was
finalized. This type of adoption is becoming rarer today because more birth
mothers are choosing to place their children through private adoption, which
gives them more control over who will adopt their child (see the next section,
“Private domestic adoption” for more information on private adoptions).
Some agencies still doing traditional adoptions are Catholic charities and
county and state adoption agencies. Two well-known established private
adoption agencies, Gladney (www.adoptionsbygladney.com) and Spence-
Chapin (www.spence-chapin.org), have large Internet Web sites.
In a traditional adoption, the adoptive parents usually have no contact with
the birth parents. A social worker conducts a home study to make sure that
you’re financially and emotionally able to support a child. The children
adopted are usually infants, although more older and special-needs children
are starting to be adopted, especially through state and public agencies.
If you’re older, have any type of criminal record, or aren’t reasonably finan-
cially secure, the agency may turn you down. The number of people looking
to adopt an infant far outweighs the number of infants available, so agencies
can afford to be picky.
Private domestic adoption
You’ve probably seen the ads, and maybe you’ve even written one: “Loving,
financially secure couple wants to give your child a home.” Newspapers and
many Internet Web sites contain these ads, written to appeal to young women
looking to give their children up for adoption. If you really want a newborn,
this method is probably your best route to adoption.
These adoptions are handled by a lawyer who may be your source for a baby
in addition to being your legal advisor. You may also find an infant through an
organization specializing in finding newborns. Your source for a baby may
also be your pastor or your doctor.
Private adoption is expensive — you can pay between $8,000 and $30,000 to
adopt privately. Legitimate payable expenses in private adoption include
lawyers’ fees, birth mom’s living costs, pregnancy, delivery, and newborn
care costs.
310
Part V: The Road Less Traveled . . . So Far! 

To be successful at a private adoption, tell everyone you know that you’re
looking. Write the most emotionally appealing ad you can, and send it to as
many newspapers as you can afford. (Make sure the state in which you’re
advertising allows this type of ad — not all do.) Many prospective adoptive
parents spend up to $5,000 in advertising costs alone. Also, post a Web site
on the Internet and make sure that you, your house, and your lifestyle are
pictured in as appealing a manner as possible.
Get a good lawyer, even before you start looking. If you find a baby, you want
to have all the legal issues taken care of as soon as possible.
After you find a possible candidate, keep your guard up all the time. Go slow,
and don’t commit to anything right away. And, most importantly, don’t give
anyone money without having a lawyer review everything.
A private adoption can be as open as you want it to be. Some couples have
the birth mother live with them before she delivers; others just have a few
meetings at a neutral location. Some never meet the birth parents at all. You
may be able to be at the delivery and take the baby home from the hospital, 
if the birth mother agrees. Many experts today argue that open adoption is
better for the adopted child and his family because his origins are never
hidden and are often well known. However, you must do what you feel is 
best for all involved.
If you’re normally a trusting person, you’d better learn to be wary and cau-
tious during this process. We’ve heard of many cases of women pretending to
be pregnant, taking money from more than one couple, or just reneging on
the deal after the baby is born. You can’t be too careful.
For information about the legalities of adoption, check the Web site www.
adoption.about.com.
Private international adoption
Harry Holt became an adoption pioneer when he and his wife headed off for
Korea to help find families for the mixed-race children of the Korean War.
(The sidebar “Molly’s adoption,” later in this chapter, tells you one of his suc-
cess stories.) Now, Holt is one of many agencies placing children from Korea,
China, Russia, South America, and India, among others. (His Web site can be
found at www.holtintl.org.)
Ten percent of adoptions (or more than 10,000) each year are international
adoptions. Not all are done through agencies; some are private. The cost of
adopting internationally is seldom less than a domestic adoption and, some-
times, is much more. Besides the costs for a home study, lawyers’ fees, and
311
Chapter 19: Moving On

agency services, there’s the cost of travel and doing business in a foreign
country.
Some parents feel more secure with a foreign adoption, because the chances
of the birth parents showing up and asking to take their child back are per-
ceived as lower than with a stateside adoption.
Some of the children up for adoption are younger than 6 months, but the red
tape of international adoptions means that your baby may be closer to a year
by the time you get him or her home. Some countries want you to stay in the
country for several weeks; others let you pick your child up at the airport.
Children adopted from foreign countries may arrive sicker than those
adopted from the United States. Medical care ranges from excellent to nearly
nonexistent, depending on from where your child came. More countries are
trying to place children in foster care rather than keep them in orphanages,
to help their social and emotional development. Some children come with
serious attachment disorders, and others may have undiagnosed medical
conditions.
Adopting a special-needs child
Plenty of children up for adoption, in this country and abroad, are classified
as special-needs children. Usually, they have a physical handicap, but they
may also have a mental or emotional handicap. Some children are classified
as special-needs kids because they’re not infants or toddlers, or because
they’re members of a racial minority.
Back in the heyday of adoption, before abortion was legal and having a child
out of wedlock was a social stigma, children were plentiful, and older children
(older being anyone over 1 year old back then), racially mixed children, and
handicapped children were rarely adopted. Now, prospective parents are
applying to adopt Down syndrome babies, children with serious emotional
and physical disabilities, and children of a different race.
Sometimes, people are tempted to adopt special-needs children because
they’re more easily available. Other couples are drawn by a picture of a child
on a TV program or in a magazine. Sharon remembers thinking seriously
about adopting a child with handicaps while her family was waiting for their
referral; OURS Magazine had pictures every month of hard-to-place children
who were waiting for homes, and every one of the pictures appealed to her.
However, she realized that her family wasn’t really emotionally prepared to
handle a child with serious problems.
312
Part V: The Road Less Traveled . . . So Far! 

Although it’s easy to be caught up emotionally in the idea of raising a special-
needs child, look realistically at your lifestyle and personalities before making
a decision.
Social workers in the United States are still somewhat hesitant to place an
African-American or Native American child in a family of a different race.
Many Native American groups are vehemently opposed to their children
being placed in white families, and many African-Americans feel the same
way, saying the children won’t develop a proper racial identity if they aren’t
raised by parents of the same race.
Foster parenting first?
Some couples look at foster parenting as a way to get a foot in the door, so 
to speak. Although you may possibly be allowed to adopt a foster child, the
majority of children in foster care aren’t available for adoption.
However, some foster children are released for adoption. If they do become
available for adoption, 64 percent will be adopted by their former foster
family, so in some cases you may be able to adopt your foster child.
Foster parents usually need to take classes to qualify. They’re also subject to
home inspections and supervision from social workers. Foster parents receive
a monthly stipend of anywhere from $300 to $700 a month, depending on
where they live.
Foster parenting can be very rewarding, but it can also be heartbreaking to
see children you’ve come to care about go back to environments that were
harmful to them in the first place. However, there’s a real need for good foster
parents, and if you want to be truly instrumental in the life of a child — or
more than one — foster parenting can be a good place to start.
Deciding to Live Child Free
So here you are. You’ve tried and tried to conceive your child, and you’ve run
out of money, time, hope, or all the above. Third-party reproduction (donor
eggs or sperm) isn’t an option for you. Adoption is neither financially nor
emotionally feasible at this time. What do you do?
313
Chapter 19: Moving On

Take stock in your life as a child-free individual or couple. Think that living
a life without children sounds depressing? Well, consider a few benefits of
being child free:
 Extra money. Can you figure out a fun way to spend $250,000? We
thought so! We discuss the costs of child rearing at the beginning of this
book, but, in short, child-free couples have a “spare” quarter million to
play with. Maybe you’ve always wanted a second home, for winter or
summer, or maybe you’ll decide to take a trip around the world. And
maybe you just like the idea of being able to go out to dinner whenever
you want and not worry about whether you can afford the extra appe-
tizer or bottle of wine.
 Extra time. Most parents today find themselves in a time crunch 
that forces them to skip many former activities, such as hobbies and
working out.
Former pleasures, such as putting your feet up after a long day at work
or enjoying a relaxing dinner with your partner, quickly become a thing
of the past for most parents, new and old. And sleeping in on Saturdays?
Forget about it!
Even after considering the extra money and time, along with the ability to be
spontaneous, your mind may still be filled with 101 romantic notions of life
with baby. Do you dream of watching your young charge score the winning
touchdown for your collegiate alma mater? Consider that the chances of your
child becoming a star athlete are probably about equal to him or her spend-
ing time in prison. Do you dream about you and your partner sharing blissful
moments with your baby? Keep in mind that many couples spend far more
time fighting over child rearing than they do reveling in it.
And also keep in mind that not having children of your own doesn’t mean
that you have no children in your life whatsoever. You probably have nieces
or nephews or friends’ children to spoil and care for. And the best part is, at
the end of the day when they get tired and grouchy, you can give them back!

In this chapter, we look at some of the hottest fertility debates and how they
may affect you.

Looking Down the Road: Long-Term
Health Effects of Fertility Medication
Fertility medications, or gonadotropins, are natural hormones, normally pro-
duced by the body. And when you go through menopause, the blood levels of
all of these hormones are going to be far higher than anything that can be
attained by injecting fertility medication. However, when given to women of
reproductive age, whose ovaries can and do respond, they are powerful stuff.
Anyone who takes them through even one cycle can attest to the physical and
emotional effects of having one’s hormones surging at a much higher level
than nature ever intended. Do people suffer long-term effects 2 or 20 years
down the road? No one knows for sure, but here are the most recent conclu-
sions on the safety of taking gonadotropins.
Effects on the mother
At this time, experts have no solid proof that taking gonadotropins has any
long-term effect on women. Some studies have shown a possible link to fertil-
ity medications and ovarian cancer, but other studies have not supported
these findings.
One thing most studies have agreed upon is that the risk of ovarian cancer is
higher in all women who’ve never become pregnant, regardless of whether or
not they’ve taken fertility medications. So if you’ve taken fertility drugs for
any amount of time and never had a child, make sure to do your yearly gyne-
cological checkup — no skipping a year or being a few months late. This is
especially important if other women in your family have had ovarian cancer
because doctors have established a genetic link for this type of cancer, among
others. (Of course this recommendation applies to all women, regardless of
whether or not they have had fertility treatment, but if this warning gets you
to take the doctor visits seriously, it will all be for the best.)
Effects on the baby
No one is sure whether fertility medications will have a long-term effect on
the children conceived through their use — the children born through high-
tech methods such as in vitro fertilization (IVF) aren’t old enough yet. The
oldest IVF baby, Louise Brown, is only in her twenties. Techniques such as
ICSI (intracytoplasmic sperm injection) and assisted hatching are even
newer; they’ve only been used extensively since the 1990s.
316
Part V: The Road Less Traveled . . . So Far! 

Because research is ongoing even as children are being born, high-tech treat-
ment has an element of risk simply because the jury’s still out on long-term
effects. Some studies have suggested that high-tech babies have lower birth
weight and developmental delays. What is not known at this point is whether it
is the treatment or the condition of infertility that puts the patients at high risk.
However, more twins and triplets are born to moms using fertility meds, and
multiples more commonly have low birth weight and developmental delays.
Also, more babies are born to older mothers through high-tech treatment,
and older women tend to have more complicated pregnancies than women
under age 35.
It’s important to note that up to this point, no effect of fertility medications
on the babies has been shown. Furthermore, fertility medications are natural
hormones, normally present in the body. And even though they may be pre-
sent at higher than normal values during the stimulation phase, they’re all
well out of your system by the time the embryo implants. So whatever effect
these medications might have would have to be on the egg and these effects
are purely hypothetical. Still, only time will tell for sure.
Because some men who need ICSI to conceive have part of a chromosome
missing, which results in their infertility, some of their sons may have the
same chromosomal abnormality and may also need to do ICSI (or whatever
high-tech methods are available in 30 years) to have children.
Sex Selection: When You Absolutely,
Positively, Want a Boy (Or a Girl)
There are lots of old wives’ tales about having a boy versus a girl — where to
sleep, what to eat, what to wear, and so on. But if you already have five boys
and would dearly love a girl, or if you carry a genetic link to a sex-determined
disease, such as hemophilia, you’re probably looking for something a little
more scientific. Until recently, 50-50 odds were the best you could do, but
newer advances have made it possible to increase the odds of taking home
the boy or girl for which you’re hoping.
Many years ago, a doctor named Shettles wrote an entire book on how to
select the gender of your child based on early observations of sperm, which
indicated that male sperm were smaller, faster, more sensitive to an acidic
environment, and more prone to early death. In contrast, female sperm were
thought to be larger, slower, more hardy, and lived longer. Many different
methods were based on these assumptions, including advice that women
douche with vinegar (acid) if they wanted a girl, timing intercourse for close
317
Chapter 20: Hello, Dolly! New Advances, New Concerns in Fertility

to ovulation if they wanted a boy (since male sperm were “faster”), and so 
on. Unfortunately, these early observations of sperm behavior have not been
borne out and there is not a shred of evidence that any of these methods are
any more successful than thinking masculine thoughts or wearing cowboy
boots to bed!
About 40 years ago, a small scientific study purported to show that a method
based on density and speed of swimming could separate sperm into males
and females. This method, called the Erickson method, was actually patented,
and was successfully marketed for many years. Unfortunately, there has never
been a large study substantiating the claims of successful gender selection,
and this method, too, has fallen by the wayside. Remember that “successfully
marketed” doesn’t necessarily mean “successful”!
The trouble with statistics like these is that they can be quite misleading.
First, you have to remember that nature gives you odds of about 53 percent
to 47 percent in favor of males, so a 65 percent chance of a boy is only 12 per-
cent more than nature gives you already. Furthermore, small studies that
show, say 7 out of 10 boys versus 3 out of 10 girls to technically demonstrate
a 70% boy rate, but it is easy to see how this could have happened by chance
alone. That is why studies need to be scrutinized by professional editors, and
undergo peer review, before they are published. Until a study is published in
a reputable journal, you should take any reported results as hearsay and take
with a large grain of salt!
The one method of sperm selection for gender determination that appears to
have promise is MicroSort, first done at Genetics and IVF in Fairfax, Virginia.
One vial of MicroSorted sperm costs about $3,400 (and you have to bring
your own sperm!), and one vial is enough for only one IVF cycle; you can buy
a second vial from the same sample for $700, which sounds like a bargain!
And don’t forget to add travel costs to the deal. This is one package the post
office can’t deliver. The sperm sample must be produced on site, although
after it’s washed and processed, you can take it back to your local clinic for
insemination purposes. One disadvantage of MicroSort is that some doctors
feel that it lowers the number of sperm available, so you may need to do IVF,
although IUI can also be used.
MicroSort uses the fact that female sperm contain slightly more DNA (3%
more to be exact, too little to allow for separation by standard means, such
as density gradients or swimming contests. In the MicroSort technique, 
individual sperm are stained with a fluorescent dye that binds to the DNA.
The males show up green, and the females show up red/pink. The sample is
sorted using an instrument called a flow cytometer.
Female MicroSorted sperm will result in a girl 91 percent of the time, and
male MicroSorted sperm will give you a boy about 76 percent of the time.
318
Part V: The Road Less Traveled . . . So Far! 

Of course, the merchandise is nonrefundable. You should note that these
numbers refer to the percentage of sperm separated, not necessarily to live
births. There has as yet not been any large series proving that these ratios will
actually be reflected in the percentage of boys versus girls (although logically,
this would make sense; remember that a lot of “logical” things in medicine
don’t turn out that way!)
At the moment, the most secure way to determine a baby’s sex is to do 
preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD), in which a cell taken from an already
created embryo can be analyzed to see if the baby will be a boy or a girl (see
Chapter 16 for more on PGD). This method is more than 95percent accurate,
and its accuracy is only limited by the technical limits of the PGD methodology
itself. Of course, this procedure requires doing IVF, which is a little inefficient,
because an IVF cycle is expensive (about $10,000) and may give you only a
few embryos to test.
The Promises — and Pitfalls — 
of Preimplantation Genetic 
Diagnosis (PGD)
Right now, PGD is mainly used to screen for genetic diseases or to check for
sex if the parents are carriers of a disease that affects only a child of one sex;
however, geneticists and other specialists in genetic-borne illnesses hope
that the coming years bring an ever improved rate of success for distinguish-
ing healthy embryos to implant. Most agree that this is the best use of PGD, a
process that is expensive, technologically challenging and labor intensive for
all those involved (including the patient!). (See Chapter 16 for more informa-
tion about PGD and its uses.)
Currently, PGD can test for a wide variety of genetic diseases, including
hemophilia, Huntington’s, muscular dystrophy, sickle cell disease, and Tay-
Sachs, as well as chromosomal defects, such as Down syndrome and Turner
syndrome.
However, the technology is there to determine the sex of the potential infant,
although it’s still very expensive. One can imagine PGD being used routinely
in a few years for couples who want only a boy or a girl. In fact, it’s already
available in many clinics in the United States. A quick search of the Internet
will reveal many clinics offering these services.
As genetic mapping advances, it’s not hard to imagine parents screening
embryos not only for sex or genetic diseases but also for hair and eye color,
319
Chapter 20: Hello, Dolly! New Advances, New Concerns in Fertility

intelligence, and personality traits. Although it’s possible that none of these
traits will ever be able to be accurately determined by PGD, they may be.
This possibility has ethicists concerned about where PGD is headed.
Ten years from today, will parents be routinely selecting the child of their
choice, picking height, IQ, hair and eye color, and left- or right-handedness?
Or will they even go one step further and have the potential to insert genes
that they themselves don’t possess into their children, with short parents
having tall children, or brunettes having blondes?
The potential for gene tinkering is limitless, after certain traits have been
mapped out and identified. The positive aspect of such manipulation could
be the elimination of certain diseases or handicaps.
The negative side is that we could end up with populations skewed in one
direction only, such as a nation full of tall, blonde, genius baseball players.
Or we could find the male-to-female ratio off balance, as is happening in
China with its one-child-only rule.
Although the potential for using gene selection for good purposes is high, the
potential for abuse is just as high. However, many experts feel that such fears
are overstated. They point out that if people really wanted a tall blonde baby,
they could already go to a sperm bank and get the sperm from a tall blonde
sperm donor, and then match it with the egg of a tall blonde egg donor. The
reality is that individuals are shaped by many factors, both genetic and envi-
ronmental. Even identical twins, who have identical genes, and were carried
in their mother’s womb at the same time, are not identical individuals. 
Freezing Eggs: The Next Big Technology?
Sperm has been frozen for decades. Embryos have been frozen for 20 years.
Eggs haven’t caught up yet, although a lot of clinics are working on it. Egg freez-
ing would be a boon for women, whose eggs are all present at the time of birth
and age along with their carrier, as well as those with illnesses that require
them to undergo chemotherapy before their childbearing years are over. Many
women are marrying later and/or deciding to have children later — in their 30s
and beyond — only to find that their eggs have used up their expiration limit.
The trouble is, eggs don’t freeze well. They contain a lot of water, which crys-
tallizes when it freezes. Ice crystals can damage the chromosomes or ruin the
inner workings of the cell. Antifreeze solutions could be used to prevent the
water inside from freezing, but antifreeze agents tend to be cytotoxic, which
means damaging to cells, and will damage the egg. Also, frozen eggs can only
be fertilized by using ICSI, which adds to the cost of doing an embryo transfer.
320
Part V: The Road Less Traveled . . . So Far! 

However, several clinics devoted to egg freezing claim that their survival rate
of frozen eggs has reached 80 percent, and that nearly 60 percent of those
eggs fertilize normally — almost as high as the percentage of fresh eggs that
fertilize.
Undoubtedly, the next few years will bring improvements to egg freezing. One
day freezing your own eggs for later or using frozen donor eggs will eliminate
the need to synchronize donor and recipient cycles, as well as bring a wider
choice of donors because eggs can be shipped around the world.
Caution: Beware of “Freeze Eggs Quick” promises by organizations, particu-
larly those that are not medical in nature. As with all new opportunities, there
are those who may look to take advantage of them . . . and you in the process.
There’s nothing guaranteed about egg freezing at this time, but the process is
getting better all the time. Just remember that “successfully marketed” is not
the same as “successful”! 
The American Society for Reproductive Medicine maintains that egg freezing
is considered experimental and should only be performed under approval
and oversight by a research committee. If you are considering freezing eggs,
make sure that the institution with which you decide to work has such over-
sight in place before you start.
Transplanting ovaries
Other experimental techniques that may hold promise for freezing eggs for
future use involve freezing a portion of the ovary and transplanting it back 
to the original owner or to another woman. This has been done for women
undergoing chemotherapy; once the treatment is finished and the risk of
recurrence is low, the tissue is transplanted either back to the pelvis or to 
the forearm. Follicles have developed in the ovary after it was transplanted.
The first baby was born after ovary transplantation from one identical twin to
another in 2004; when this technique is refined, it could bring hope of deliver-
ing a genetic child to women who undergo chemotherapy.
Posthumous Conception: 
Legal and Ethical Issues
It’s not difficult or expensive to do. It creates a child. It usually helps heal
wounds that come from the death of a loved one. So why is there so much
controversy over posthumous conception?
321
Chapter 20: Hello, Dolly! New Advances, New Concerns in Fertility

Posthumous collection of sperm — removing sperm from the testes after a
man has died — has been done on just about every continent. The legal
issues have been discussed almost as much as the ethical issues. And there’s
still little legal or moral consensus about using a deceased man’s sperm to
create a child.
The person using the sperm is usually the spouse or partner of the dead man.
Sometimes, but not always, she has advance written permission to collect
and use the sperm at the time of his death. Legal issues have revolved around
inheritance of the dead man’s property and the payment of Social Security to
the children who are born after a man’s death — more than 300 days after his
death.
The waters become murkier when the man has given no written permission for
the sperm extraction. Can a spouse or partner legally request this be done?
How does she know that it’s what the man would want done? Does it matter?
One widow used a videotape in which her husband, who had been killed in a
car accident, expressed a desire to have children someday as support for her
request to have sperm removed at the time of his death.
Most recently, a case in which a man left frozen sperm to his fiancée came
under scrutiny because she didn’t want to use the sperm, but the man’s par-
ents did. They wanted to use donor eggs and a gestational carrier to create a
child of their child, which they presumably would then raise.
In England, a widower is trying to find a surrogate to carry embryos created
right before his wife’s death; she had an egg retrieval done while she was
waiting for a heart-lung transplant.
In another case of motherhood after death, the parents of a dead woman
were searching for a gestational carrier to give birth to their dead daughter’s
children, created from their daughter’s eggs and donor sperm.
Cases like these and even more complex ones will be popping up in courts all
over the world in the next few years.
Dividing Up the Leftover Embryos
A few years ago, England found itself with more than 3,000 embryos in stor-
age tanks that weren’t being used or paid for by the people who created
them. Because English law stipulated that frozen embryos must be used
within five years, unless the parents were granted an extension, the embryos
were destroyed.
322
Part V: The Road Less Traveled . . . So Far! 

In the United States, an estimated 100,000 embryos are frozen in storage
tanks. Some will be used for another pregnancy attempt by their parents, but
others will be left frozen, unpaid for and unused. In the United States, clinics
who have documented proof that they tried to contact parents can destroy
embryos after five years, according to guidelines from the American Society
for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM).
The United States still has no hard and fast rules for frozen embryos. Each
state rules differently when the cases go to court.
Infertility centers try to prevent these types of lawsuits by having couples
sign a form at the time of egg retrieval stating what they want done with their
embryos if they die or are divorced. Recently, though, a judge ruled that the
decisions made at the time of retrieval were meaningless under changed 
circumstances.
Frozen embryos have been at the center of other types of lawsuits. Even in
1983, when IVF was a brand-new technology, frozen embryos made the news
when their wealthy parents were killed in a plane crash, leaving no heirs.
Technically, their only offspring were two frozen embryos. Of course, many
women offered to carry the embryos and raise them — as long as their inher-
ited fortune came with them! In the end, the embryos were treated as prop-
erty and were destroyed.
Even if parents don’t divorce or die, the decision of what to do with frozen
embryos is a tough one because the choices are limited. Parents can donate
the embryos to research, donate them to another couple, or have them
destroyed. Not liking any of the choices, many parents just keep the embryos
in storage, postponing any decision on what to do with them.
Frozen embryos have survived and created healthy children after a ten-year
freezing period, so most centers aren’t anxious to destroy embryos after five
years.
In an ideal world, couples would use up all their embryos, having one baby
initially and then one or more a few years later. However, for various reasons,
that often doesn’t happen. Leftover embryos then become a huge emotional
and legal headache for most IVF centers. It takes space to store them and
costs money to maintain the storage tanks. Few centers want to make deci-
sions about potential human beings without some input from their parents,
even if the parents haven’t been seen or heard from in years.
When parents separate or divorce with embryos still in storage, frozen
embryos can become a bitter battleground. In more than one case, divorcing
couples have fought publicly over what should be done with their unused
embryos. One ex-husband wanted to implant the embryos in his new wife!
323
Chapter 20: Hello, Dolly! New Advances, New Concerns in Fertility

The recent debates about using “leftover embryos” for stem cell research has
created heated debates among ethicists. Is it ethically justifiable to destroy
embryos — that many argue will be destroyed anyway — to potentially save
other people? Or is the destruction of human embryos — potential people in
their own right — wrong even if it’s done for a good cause? Whose life takes
precedence? These are hard questions with hard answers that many ethicists
are still debating, and that many IVF patients agonize over on a personal level. 
Saving Stem Cells for Research: 
Raising Ethical Concerns
Stem cells are cells that can be grown into any type of tissue or organ. In other
words, they’re not specific.
Human embryos are a good source of stem cells, and it could be possible to
substitute DNA from a living person into a human egg after the egg’s DNA was
removed. The egg could then be “shocked” to get it to grow, and after two
weeks or so, the stem cells would be removed. Of course, in the process, the
embryo would cease to exist.
The stem cells would then be grown into whatever the adult needed —
organs, skin, or other tissue. Because the genetic match would be exact, the
person’s body wouldn’t reject the new organ or tissue. People needing organ
transplants or new skin after a burn may find this type of science valuable.
Some doctors feel that the surplus of embryos destroyed every year should
be used for stem cell development. Others feel that the potential life of the
embryo shouldn’t be sacrificed to save an already living person. Many people
with frozen embryos would like to see something positive done with embryos
that they donate for research, and would rather have them used for stem cell
development than just be destroyed.
Parents with sick children have already been in the news for trying to create
embryos for the specific purpose of donating stem cells to their living child.
Others have had a baby specifically for the purpose of donating blood or
tissue to a sick child. Whether it’s morally and ethically acceptable to give
birth to a child so that that child can save another’s life is a question that’s
still under debate.
Animal cloning from an adult hasn’t been very successful, but separating
cells at an early embryonic stage has worked fairly well. The trouble with this
technique is that it doesn’t have much practicality in humans. Although iden-
tical twins, triplets, or more could be created, few families are looking to have
an army of identical children.
324
Part V: The Road Less Traveled . . . So Far! 

Cloning and Human Concerns
People talk about cloning as if all cloning is the same thing. In reality, there
are three different types of cloning; some have been successful, some have
been partially successful, and some haven’t been done at all yet as far as we
know. We discuss all three in this section.
The cloning causing the most controversy is the type that produced Dolly the
sheep. It involves taking a healthy embryo, removing its DNA, and putting the
DNA from another person into the embryo. Any cell contains DNA, so obtain-
ing DNA isn’t difficult. If the embryo continues growing normally, it can be
placed into a host uterus to grow for nine months.
There are numerous concerns about cloning. Many of the offspring cloned so
far have had serious abnormalities. There is also concern that cloned individ-
uals might age much faster than normal because their DNA was obtained
from a mature adult.
People wanting an exact copy of themselves may be disappointed because
cloned animals aren’t totally identical. Environmental influences can change
certain characteristics and alter appearance.
Another type of cloning that could be used to create human beings has been
done pretty successfully in animals. It involves taking a cell from an embryo
and allowing it to grow into a second, identical embryo. This is how identical
twins occur in nature.
It would be possible to give birth to identical twins several years apart by
using this technique, which is done frequently in farming. It would also be
possible to do genetic testing on the “cloned” embryo while freezing the orig-
inal. If the clone passed the genetic tests, the “original” could then be thawed
and implanted.
325
Chapter 20: Hello, Dolly! New Advances, New Concerns in Fertility
Cutting the cord — but saving it
Stem cells can be obtained from other places
besides human embryos. Many parents are
now banking blood from their child’s umbilical
cord in case the child needs stem cells at a
later date. Unfortunately, the utility and/or cost-
effectiveness of such an approach has not yet
been evaluated. One possible strategy would
collect all of the umbilical blood in a given
community, with the idea of setting up a stem
cell bank. It has been estimated that 10,000
specimens would be required to have a sample
of every possible combination of HLA genes.
When someone needed stem cells, say for a
bone marrow transplant, such stem cells
would then be available. As with so many
aspects of this new science, only time will tell.

Forcing Clinics to Decide 
Who’s Fit to Parent
If you’re fertile, you can become a parent anytime you want. No one is in your
bedroom rating your ability to raise children. And after children are born,
they’re taken only from parents who’ve crossed far over the line of normal
parenting behavior.
People who do IVF are no better or worse as parents than anyone else; the
potential for child abuse or neglect exists just as it does in any other popula-
tion. Some clinics require psychological screening for their patients, trying to
weed out those who are psychologically unprepared to raise children; others
do not.
Not long ago, a father was arrested for beating his infant son to death. The
father had used IVF with donor eggs and a gestational carrier to create his
son. This case raised questions about how aggressive clinics should be in
evaluating patients for parenthood. Should potential parents be turned away
because they don’t fit a typical social mold? In Australia, for example, gay
women aren’t allowed to do IVF. Should IVF parents be required to have a 
certain income level or be of a certain intelligence level?
At this time, most clinics set their own rules for evaluating patients. One
prime example is the use of donor eggs or embryos for older women — 
older as in over 55. Many centers use 55 as an arbitrary cutoff age. Why 55
and not 65? Some centers do strict testing on patients over 40 to make sure
that they’re healthy enough to carry a pregnancy. Yet some 45-year-olds are
much healthier than some 25-year-olds.
326
Part V: The Road Less Traveled . . . So Far! 
The creation of Dolly
The cloning technique that created Dolly, the
well-known cloned sheep, involved taking a cell
from another sheep and putting it into a sheep
embryo. The genetic material was removed
from the embryo, so that the only DNA was from
the donor sheep, which was about 6 years old
at the time. Dolly was the only successful clone
born out of about 300 original attempts. Dolly
started to develop arthritis when she was
almost 6 years old, causing concern that she
was aging faster than normal. In early 2003,
Dolly had to be euthanized at the age of 6 after
being diagnosed with a progressive lung dis-
ease. Sheep usually live to be 12 to 14 years old.
Calf cloning has been mildly successful; 73 per-
cent of pregnancies end in miscarriage, and 20
percent die soon after birth. Some are born
oversized, with enlarged tongues, with immune
deficiencies, or with diseases such as diabetes.

IVF isn’t well regulated in the United States. Although most centers follow
guidelines set by ASRM and the Society of Assisted Reproductive Technology
(SART), guidelines are only that. A patient denied treatment at one center
may be accepted at another. Should IVF centers be in the business of choos-
ing who will be good parents? Are they guilty if an IVF parent harms his child?
Making Mistakes in the Lab: When
Saying You’re Sorry Isn’t Enough
Black children born to white couples. Embryos misplaced while in storage.
A clinic in California charged with more than 100 cases of taking one woman’s
eggs and giving them to another and of selling embryos left in storage. These
are just a few of the mistakes (whether accidental or intentional) that fertility
clinics have made.
Most clinics are careful not to work on eggs or embryos belonging to two dif-
ferent people at the same time. They label everything that they’re working on
to prevent mix-ups, yet mix-ups do sometimes occur.
When a clinic makes these kinds of mistakes, saying sorry isn’t nearly good
enough. Most of the highly publicized cases of parents ending up with the
wrong children have come to light only because the parents and children were
of different races. It’s hard to say whether similar errors have been made and
not discovered because parents and children were all of the same race.
In one instance involving black children and white parents, the error was
made in the andrology lab; sperm from a black man was used instead of the
sperm from the Caucasian spouse. In this case, the birth mother was also the
biological mother, making the children genetically hers.
In another case, embryos from a black couple were implanted along with a
white couple’s own embryos. The woman gave birth to one biological child
and one unrelated child, who was then returned to his biological parents by
the courts.
It’s hard to safeguard yourself against errors like these. The errors aren’t
made purposely; they’re the result of fallible human beings making mistakes.
You can help keep mistakes to a minimum by reading everything you’re given
to sign, and making sure that your name is properly spelled on everything.
When you leave a semen specimen, make sure that it’s labeled properly. When
the embryologist hands your embryos over for transfer, make sure that she
says your proper name.
327
Chapter 20: Hello, Dolly! New Advances, New Concerns in Fertility

If you have questions at any point about your eggs or embryos, ask them at
that time. If there’s any question of error, getting to the bottom of it right then
is much easier than getting to the bottom of it nine months later. Monetary
compensation is never going to be adequate enough to fix the heartbreak
caused by an error in an embryology lab.
Injecting Immune Therapy 
If standard fertility methods have failed you, you may be interested in moving
on to some of the more controversial methods:
 Leukocyte immune therapy (LIT)
 Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG)
 Enbrel or Remicade
These methods are considered controversial because only a few doctors sup-
port them or because they’re considered to be risky in some way. Immune
issues are generally believed to be responsible for less than 5 percent of infer-
tility, but some doctors feel that this condition is under-diagnosed because
the testing for immune factors is expensive and done only in a few labs.
However, mainstream organizations have been quite uniform in rejecting
these therapies. Very few university centers offer them, and if a doctor goes
out of his or her way to recommend them, you should become suspicious
and seek a second opinion. As with other unproven therapies, there are sev-
eral dangers:
 You waste time with unproven therapy instead of using something that
can actually work.
 There may be quite serious side effects from the therapy. The potential
dangers of many of these immunotherapies far exceed the potential dan-
gers of fertility medications.
 They are expensive.
Leukocyte immune therapy
The idea that some women’s bodies reject an embryo isn’t a new one, but 
the methods for overcoming rejection are fairly new. One method, leukocyte
328
Part V: The Road Less Traveled . . . So Far! 

immune therapy (LIT), was halted by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
and shows no signs of being reapproved at this writing. LIT was fairly simple:
White blood cells from the woman’s partner or a donor were washed and
injected under the woman’s skin. The theory behind LIT is that some women
don’t have the right amount of blocking antibodies, which keep them from
rejecting a growing fetus as a foreign piece of tissue. By giving proteins from
your partner or another person, some of the proper blocking antibodies are
introduced into your body, and the embryo will, one hopes, not be rejected.
The FDA currently bans the use of LIT in the United States, but some women
have gone abroad to have LIT done. If you choose this option, you and your
partner need up-to-date infectious blood testing. 
There are no studies showing that this therapy is safe. Since it is banned by
the FDA, there is no other requirement for studies showing safety. 
Investing in IVIG
Because LIT has been banned, some doctors recommend intravenous
immunoglobulin (IVIG) therapy as a substitute. Unfortunately, IVIG must be
administered as an intravenous infusion, which takes two to four hours, and
must be done by a doctor or nurse. By way of comparison, LIT is a subcuta-
neous (under the skin) injection that takes just a few minutes to give.
IVIG has two major drawbacks:
 A single infusion may run between $3,000 and $4,000, and if you get 
pregnant, your doctor will most likely recommend at least two or three
infusions.
 Unlike the proteins injected from your partner in LIT, IVIG is a commer-
cially produced blood product from strangers, so there is a small chance
of transmission of HIV or hepatitis through the infusion.
Use of IVIG therapy in infertility is extremely controversial. Many doctors
don’t see any benefit at all to IVIG; other doctors believe that good prospec-
tive (set up in advance) studies on IVIG treatment in infertility are few and
inconclusive.
Side effects of IVIG can be severe; anaphylactic shock is a small risk. Rash,
fever, headache, dizziness, and nausea are fairly common side effects. A pub-
lication by the practice committee of SART has specifically denounced the
use of IVIG.

Enbrel and Remicade
The newest drugs proclaimed by some doctors to help pregnancies implant
are Enbrel and Remicade, drugs that decrease levels of TNF, or tumor necro-
sis factor. 
In larger than normal amounts, TNF can cause pain and inflammation seen in
autoimmune diseases such as Crohn’s disease and rheumatoid arthritis;
Enbrel and Remicade help relieve the inflammation and pain by decreasing
concentrations of TNF.
Some doctors use TNF fighters to decrease immune responses that may keep
pregnancies from implanting and growing. A number of deaths and lawsuits
have resulted from patients taking Enbrel and Remicade. To date, Enbrel and
Remicade have been implicated in the following:
 Development of lymphoma, a type of cancer
 Neurological damage
 An increase in the development of systemic lupus erythematosus, an
autoimmune disease
 Serious infections
 Blood disorders, including severe anemia

The Ten-Plus Most Annoying
Things to Hear When You’re 
Trying to Get Pregnant
In This Chapter
 “Supportive” statements
 Unbelievable utterances
 Direct from the doctor
A
s if trying to get pregnant wasn’t stressful enough, anything to do with
reproduction seems to be fair game for comment by friends, relatives,
and complete strangers. In this chapter, we list some of the most common and
most annoying things you’ll hear on the road to pregnancy. Feel free to tear
this chapter out and throw darts at it!
Helpful Hints
“Just relax, and you’ll get pregnant.” (Who hasn’t said this to you by now?)
“My friend Bootsy adopted a child and got pregnant the next day. Have you
considered this?”
“Have you tried . . . ?” “Have you read . . . ?” “Have you heard . . . ?” (These
questions all usually refer to harebrained schemes for getting pregnant.)
“Dr. Perfect has the best stats around. He can get anyone pregnant, well
almost anyone.” (Of course, you usually hear this after your first, second,
third, or later unsuccessful attempt.)

“I Know How You Feel”
“I know how you feel. It took us four months to conceive our third child.”
(There should be a law against comments like this.)
“I can’t believe you’re having such a tough time! I get pregnant every time my
partner walks in the door!” (See response to preceding comment.)
“Things could be worse.” (No, really?)
“I bet this experience has brought you and your partner a lot closer.”
(Of course, brain surgery would, too, but I’m sure there’s an easier way.)
Comments You Can’t Believe You Heard
“Are you pregnant yet?”
“You’re still not pregnant?” (Yes folks, people really do say the dumbest things!)
“Do you have a good doctor?” (Actually, I’m using a vet, but thanks for asking.)
“Trying to conceive is really hard work.” (You may hear this from your spouse,
whose contribution involves monthly ejaculations while watching and/or
reading pornography in your doctor’s office.)
“Plenty of people live happy lives without children.” (Thanks for sharing!)
Straight from Your Doctor’s Mouth
“Your chances of conceiving are 2.6786 percent, about the same as getting hit
by lightning.” (This statement is obviously taken from the table of famous sta-
tistics that doctors pull out of thin air.)
“You’re not having much of a response, are you?” (Doctors generally say this
when you’re lying in a prone position with an ultrasound wand in position.)
“You need to be very aggressive, considering your age.”
334
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

“Maybe you shouldn’t have waited so long to start trying.” (Hmmm, let’s
spend some time flogging ourselves over that!)
“Guess you and your partner will just have to keep ‘practicing’.” (With a wink,
wink, nudge, nudge from the doctor who continues to “practice” his skills, or
lack thereof, on you!)
Leaving You Speechless
“Why do you think God is doing this to you?” (I dunno, maybe you could ask
for me.)

Chapter 22
Ten (Okay, Seven) Groups of
Fertility Medications and 
Where to Find Them
In This Chapter
 Categorizing fertility medications
 Locating fertility medications
A
lthough fertility medications come with a bewildering array of names,
these medications fit into only a few categories. The different names are
brand name-only differences, in most cases. In this chapter, we describe the
different categories and list the most common brand names of each.
Sorting the Medications
Fertility medications are often sold in boxes of five or ten vials or in multi-
dose bottles or syringes. There’s no logical reason for fertility medications to
be sold in multiple units; the main reason, of course, is profit. Pharmacies
that specialize in fertility medications will break up a box and sell you one or
two, but usually your local Cost-Cut Pharmacy won’t.
Gonadotropins
These drugs are the mainstay of fertility treatment. Gonadotropins (gonad
meaning reproductive organ; tropin being Greek for “turning towards,” in 
this case, a hormone which has an affinity for the gonad) stimulate follicle
growth. All gonadotropins are manufactured in the lab, and are generally

divided into two broad categories according to the raw material from which
they are extracted. Recombinant gonadotropins are extracted from a protein
product that is generated by cells in culture. The cells are Chinese hamster
ovary cells that have been injected (“transfected”) with the DNA for the
gonadotropins, and therefore produce the hormones (which are proteins)
from the DNA blueprint. 
Urinary gonadotropins are extracted from protein extracted from the urine of
postmenopausal women. Postmenopausal women have very high FSH levels,
and their bodies excrete all of this FSH in the urine. Urinary products generally
contain both FSH and LH (although the LH can be removed), and recombi-
nant products generally contain only FSH (although recombinant LH has also
recently been brought to the market). 
Side effects of gonadotropins are generally caused by the hormones that are
produced by the ovary in response to the gonadotropins, (rather than due to
direct effects of the gonadotropins themselves) and include bloating, headache,
and mood swings.
Recombinant gonadotropins
Recombinant drugs contain relatively few other human proteins and are con-
sidered to be nearly free from impurities. These drugs are follicle-stimulating
drugs; they contain nearly pure FSH, so they encourage the growth of many
follicles rather than just one in an in vitro fertilization (IVF) or stimulated
cycle. Because they’re purified and unlikely to cause a skin reaction, they can
be given subcutaneously with a very small needle; women with a body mass
index over 30 should receive the drug intramuscularly for best absorption.
Two brands are currently available: Follistim and Gonal-F.
Follistim
Follistim is made by Organon, a large manufacturer of several fertility medica-
tions. It comes in a prefilled, premixed multidose syringe containing 300IU,
600IU, or 900 IU of medication. You turn a dial to choose the amount of med-
ication you want to inject, and then change the needle for your next dose.
Gonal-F
Gonal-F is produced by Serono Labs, another large manufacturer of fertility
medications. Gonal-F is sold in three types of packaging:
 In a multidose vial containing 450 IU of medication. The advantage is
that you mix it with a small amount of water and have only a tiny amount
to inject at a time; plus you have to mix a new batch only every couple
of days. The disadvantage is that you can’t save the unused portion for
another cycle. As a result, you may waste a lot of medication or have to
buy a combination of multidose and single-dose vials.
338
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

 In single vials of 75IU, which must be mixed with sterile water before
being injected subcutaneously. If you only need a dose or two of medica-
tion, this method may be cheaper to purchase.
 In a prefilled, premixed pen containing 300IU, 450IU, or 900IU of 
medication.
Urinary FSH
One purified FSH alone product made from urine is available. The advantage
to a product made from human products rather than lab-manufactured ones
is that the cost is less.
Bravelle
Bravelle is made by Ferring, another large manufacturer of fertility medica-
tions. Although Bravelle is made from purified urine, it’s nearly as pure as
recombinant FSH and tends to be somewhat cheaper. It comes in 75 IU vials
and is given subcutaneously with a small needle after being mixed with ster-
ile water.
Recombinant LH
There’s only one recombinant LH product on the market at the moment.
Luveris, manufactured by Serono, is a recombinant LH preparation that
administers 75IU of LH after being mixed with 1 cc of sterile water. The 
drug is given subcutaneously.
Urinary LH/FSH
These were the earliest gonadotropins on the market. They’re made from
purified urine from menopausal women and contain nearly equal amounts of
LH and FSH. Some doctors now believe that some LH is helpful in a stimu-
lated cycle and may prescribe these along with a pure FSH product.
Menopur 
Menopur is manufactured by Ferring, and contains equal amounts of LH and
FSH. It comes in 75 IU vials. Because it is highly purified, it is given subcuta-
neously after being mixed with 1 cc of water. More than one vial can be mixed
with the 1 cc of sterile water. Menopur should be given within 15 minutes
after mixing.
Repronex
Repronex is also manufactured by Ferring. It is the last of the “traditional”
gonadotropin preparations. These preparations undergo considerably less
purification, and therefore contain much more in the way of foreign proteins.
This is not dangerous, and in fact, some doctors feel that some patients
339
Chapter 22: Ten (Okay, Seven) Groups of Fertility Medications

respond better to this less purified version of the natural FSH and LH hor-
mones. Some centers give Repronex subcutaneously, but others have found
skin rashes to be fairly common (10 to 20%) unless given intramuscularly. It
comes in 75 IU vials and is mixed with 1 cc diluent if given subcutaneously,
2 cc if given intramuscularly. Repronex tends to be cheaper than the other
medications. If it is prescribed for you, consider trying to inject it subcuta-
neously (which is easier and less painful), and if you get a rash, change to
intramuscular.
GnRH agonists
Leuprolide acetate, more commonly known as Lupron, is a gonadotropin-
releasing hormone agonist, meaning that it suppresses hormones such as
LH and FSH. It’s manufactured by TAP Pharmaceutical Products and sold in
a 14-day kit, which contains a 2.8 ml multidose vial of premixed Lupron and
14 syringes. Lupron first causes a stimulation of the pituitary, which makes
extra FSH and LH, which can then stimulate your ovaries, but then after a few
days starts to suppress the pituitary and causes what you will hear the nurses
and doctors call “down-regulation.” This means that your normal menstrual
cycle, which matures only one egg at a time, will be shut off. More impor-
tantly, this allows many follicles to be stimulated with gonadotropins. If taken
for more than a few weeks without any other medications, Lupron causes low
estrogen levels, which can result in hot flashes, headaches, and bone pain.
Some centers use a smaller dose of Lupron, called a microdose Lupron,
which can be purchased premixed from pharmacies that specialize in fertility
medications. Microdose Lupron is used exclusively for stimulation as part of
a protocol called a “microdose flare.” This means that the Lupron is used for
its stimulatory properties, and the gonadotropins are started either at the
same time, or two days later. The lower dose of Lupron means that the down-
regulation takes longer to achieve and thus the stimulatory properties of the
Lupron are maximized. The microdose flare is an example of a “poor responder”
protocol, which means that it’s used for women who either have a history of,
or are anticipated to have a poor response to stimulation.
GnRH antagonists
A newer category of medication called GnRH antagonists was designed to
keep women from releasing eggs early during an IVF cycle without the initial
stimulatory effects of Lupron. (For this reason, the antagonists do not have
to be administered ahead of time, and can simply be given near the end of the
stimulation to prevent the body from releasing the eggs before the doctors
340
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

can get to them during an egg retrieval procedure). It’s manufactured by
Organon as Antagon and by Serono as Cetrotide. Cetrotide is manufactured
as a 3 mg one-time injection and also as a 250 mcg (which is the same as 
0.25 mg) daily injection; Antagon is only sold as a daily 250 mcg injection.
The daily injection usually starts around day six of an IVF cycle (when the lead
follicle is around 14 mm in diameter). Antagon is sold in a prefilled syringe
that requires no mixing. Cetrotide comes with a syringe prefilled with diluent,
which needs to be injected into a powder; the mixture is then drawn back
into the syringe and injected.
hCG (human chorionic gonadotropin)
intramuscular
Several different brands of hCG are sold; all contain 10,000 IU of hCG. They’re
packaged with more water than is needed for a single injection, usually 10 cc;
the hCG is generally mixed with 2 cc of water and then injected intramuscularly.
(Several recent studies have confirmed that these medications are absorbed
equally well when injected subcutaneously. Therefore, some clinics are using
them with the small sub-cu injection. Ask your doctor what his recommenda-
tion is. Common brand names are:
 Novarel (Ferring)
 Pregnyl (Organon)
 Profasi (Serono)
hCG subcutaneous recombinant
Ovidrel is a lab-manufactured subcutaneous dose of hCG packaged as 250 mcg
equivalent to 5,000 to 10,000 IU; it comes with a 1 cc vial of water for mixing.
Serono makes Ovidrel.
Progesterone
Progesterone can be given in intramuscular injections (the highest blood
levels), vaginal suppositories, vaginal gel, vaginal pills, or oral pills (the
lowest blood levels).
 Injections: The intramuscular injection form of progesterone comes in
multidose vials of 50 mg/ml. Progesterone in oil needs to be mixed under
a special hood, so it’s made only by pharmacies that compound medica-
tions; these are usually pharmacies that specialize in fertility medications,
such as those found at the end of this chapter.
341
Chapter 22: Ten (Okay, Seven) Groups of Fertility Medications

 Vaginal suppositories: These suppositories are made in several
strengths and must be made by the pharmacy, so they can be hard to
find; they’re not commercially manufactured. They’re little bullets that
must be inserted manually and come in 100 mgm, 200 mgm, and 400 mgm
strength. Vaginally administered progesterone produces blood levels
that are lower than those achieved with the injections, but much higher
tissue levels of progesterone in the uterine lining. This is because there
appears to be a special uptake mechanism for medications from the
vagina into the uterus.
 Gel: Crinone is a gel manufactured by Serono; it comes in prefilled appli-
cators of 90 mg. Some patients have fewer problems with yeast infections
and irritation with Crinone than with vaginal suppositories.
 Capsules: These are manufactured as Prometrium by Solvay and are
available in 100 mg and 200 mg. Compounding pharmacies also make
their own micronized progesterone capsules.
 Micronized tablets: These are also compounded by pharmacies. If they
are taken orally, they absorb well but are then rapidly metabolized in the
liver, leading to low serum levels of progesterone and low effectiveness.
Oral progesterone is not generally recommended during fertility proce-
dures, (but may be adequate for menopausal replacement therapy).
Oral progesterone also causes considerable sleepiness, as some of its
metabolites act as sedatives.
 Micronized tablets taken vaginally: The same tablets can be taken vagi-
nally. The progesterone absorbs much better this way and produces
excellent tissue levels in the uterus. Some centers prefer the vaginal
tablets to suppositories because they’re less messy and the powder
inside the capsules stays in the vagina for 24 hours or more, thus pro-
ducing a steady supply of progesterone during the day, as opposed to
suppositories which melt quickly and are quickly gone.
Ovulation induction medications
Clomiphene citrate is more commonly called Clomid even though it’s sold as
Clomid by several manufacturers and Serophene by Serono Labs. Clomid is a
50 mg pill that stimulates the ovaries and increases the release of follicle-
stimulating hormones. Side effects include hot flashes, bloating, headache,
and blurred vision.
Femara (Leterozole) was originally used in the treatment of breast cancer.
Some clinics are also using it for ovulation induction, although its use as an
ovulation induction drug is considered “off label” by the FDA, meaning it’s
not approved for this use. Be sure to discuss all the possible pros and cons
with your doctor before taking this drug.
342
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Mail-Order Pharmacies
Although medications such as Clomid and hCG are fairly easy to find at your
local pharmacy, gonadotropins and progesterone can be harder to find. A
whole industry of mail-order pharmacies that specialize in fertility drugs 
has evolved, and there are some advantages to using them over your local
pharmacy:
 They charge less for fertility medications than most pharmacies
 They mail the medications directly to your home
 They offer overnight delivery
 They take a wide variety of insurances
 They may have special programs to help low income women afford 
medications
 Many produce injection instruction tapes and have hotlines you can call
with medication questions 24 hours a day
This list of mail-order pharmacies is by no means complete; the area in which
you live may have similar pharmacies with which your clinic deals on a regu-
lar basis.
