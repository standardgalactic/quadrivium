Preface
About This Edition: What’s Old and What’s New?
This second edition retains all the main mathematical and pedagogical attributes
and strategies of the ﬁrst edition, as outlined below. For example, this edition
retains—and perhaps increases—the ﬁrst edition’s strong focus on helping stu-
dents acquire and use mathematical language. Many students at the level envi-
sioned for this text ﬁnd the linguistic challenge of parsing complicated deﬁnitions
and theorems just as difﬁcult as the mathematics itself. This edition, therefore,
contains additional problems and exercises that ask students to unpack, instan-
tiate, or even “perturb” the statements of deﬁnitions and theorems. (See, e.g.,
Problem 7, page 112.)
This book, like any second edition, incorporates repair of ﬁrst edition typos
(and possibly the introduction of some brand-new ones). The narrative has also
been “smoothed” or (in the author’s view) otherwise improved in places identiﬁed
either by the author or (thanks!) by other users.
Following are some more signiﬁcant new features and content.
New sections on topology and compactness. Two entirely new sections, Sec-
tions 3.5 and 3.6, introduce basic ideas of topology and compactness. Some gen-
eral deﬁnitions and principles are discussed, but the setting is almost always the
real line, treated (when helpful) as a metric space. Compactness is deﬁned in
terms of open covers (which pose their own linguistic challenges!) but there is
strong emphasis on closed and bounded sets in R, via the Heine–Borel theorem.
This material is very occasionally alluded to, but not really depended on, in later
sections. In this sense these sections are essentially self-contained, and could be
used for independent study or enrichment projects.
New material on series of functions and “Taylor stuff.” Treatment of function
series in general and of Taylor series in particular has been beefed up, both in Sec-
tion 4.4 and in the new Section 4.5, on Taylor series. Section 4.5 joins Section 2.7
(on upper and lower limits) in the mode of “guided discovery”. Both sections are
designed for students to encounter as projects or other forms of enrichment. Their
content, though mathematically important, is not explicitly required in the sequel.

Preface
New problems and exercises. This edition includes new problems and exercises
in most of the sections. Many new problems focus on helping students understand
and “unpack” (in the sense discussed above) deﬁnitions and theorems. Students
are often asked to prove special cases, explore concrete instances of general re-
sults, and the like. Many problem sets have also been more carefully ordered to
distinguish between odd- and even-numbered exercises; most of the former have
hints or solutions in the back.
Thanks
This book, in both of its editions, owes its existence to a large (uncounted but
surely countable) set of teachers, academic colleagues, St. Olaf College students,
publishing company professionals, friends, advisors, critics, “competitors,” fam-
ily, and others. It is a pleasure to acknowledge some of them by name—and to
claim sole credit for errors that survived their best efforts to help.
Among local colleagues I thank Bruce Hanson, Paul Humke, Loren Larson,
the late Arnold Ostebee, Matt Richey, the late Lynn Steen, Ted Vessey, and many
others with whom I have discussed matters mathematical and pedagogical for
many years. On matters of taste and usage—both linguistic and mathematical—
my friend Barry Cipra is a reliable resource. His advice, when I have taken it,
has always proved correct. These gifted teachers, expositors, and mathematicians
have helped me think about the deep connections and subtle relationships among
teaching, telling, and doing mathematics. They have also demonstrated, by ar-
gument and example, that serious engagement with post-calculus mathematics is
possible, and valuable, for a broad range of students, not just a small elite. This
“big tent” approach to our discipline informs and underpins St. Olaf’s very suc-
cessful undergraduate program, and I have kept it in mind when writing this book.
Academic colleagues elsewhere have taught me a lot, too. These include my
own mathematics teachers at Washington University and the University of Wash-
ington; authors and referees from my work with Mathematics Magazine and other
publications of the Mathematical Association of America; and authors of other
real analysis textbooks from which I have learned, taught, or read. Real analysis
can be viewed usefully from many angles; doing so offers depth and perspective.
The late Klaus Peters and Charlotte Henderson worked with remarkable care,
diligence, and intelligence to make the ﬁrst edition of this book better and its
production easier. I’m all the more grateful to them because, as a sometime editor
myself, I know how difﬁcult and exacting that work can be.
For encouragement and equally diligent and meticulous work on the second
edition, I thank Karen Simon, Robert Ross, Sunil Nair, and Shashi Kumar, all of
Taylor & Francis.
Last, but hardly least important, are the support and forbearance of my wife,
Janet, in everything that book writing entails for anyone unlucky enough to ob-

serve and be around the process. Thanks.
The remainder of this preface is from the ﬁrst edition.
What This Book Is, and Isn’t
This book aims to do what its title suggests: help students—especially those new
to real analysis—really understand what it is all about.
Who could oppose such a goal? A better question is how, concretely, this
textbook tries to achieve it. Following are some more speciﬁc goals, strategies,
and features.
Building on calculus basics. Students in the beginning real analysis course that
this book supports may have little or no course experience beyond single-variable
calculus (a year, say) and perhaps some exposure to linear algebra, differential
equations, or multivariate calculus. What can be expected from such students is a
general, though probably informal, sense of the big ideas of calculus—function,
limit, derivative, and integral—and some curiosity about the rigorous theory that
lies behind the techniques. This book’s main strategy is to exploit students’ prior
experience with and curiosity about calculus in working toward deeper under-
standing.
Focus on mathematical proof and structure. Beginning real analysis students
may or may not already have taken a “proofs” or “bridge” or “transition” course.
This book makes no hard-wired assumption either way. The long and relatively
leisurely Chapter 1 includes enough of this material (e.g., a fairly complete in-
troduction to sets and cardinality) to help less “mature” students make their way
efﬁciently into real analysis. A class of students who do have this background can
simply move more quickly through these preliminaries; there is enough material
here to support a full semester course in either case.
Real analysis is, arguably, a challenging area in which to learn proof tech-
niques, as I hope many students will do. Deﬁnitions and theorems, for instance,
can be quite technical, with multiple layers of quantiﬁcation. On the ﬂip side (I’m
convinced!), real analysis has the advantage of being about ideas most students
will have recently encountered—and many students really are eager to accept a
challenge so closely connected to their recent experience.
Focus on mathematical language. Outsiders and newcomers ﬁnd mathematical
language surprisingly subtle, sophisticated, and sensitive to word order, usage,
and punctuation. (Run the deﬁnition of uniform continuity by a colleague in the
humanities sometime.) Most mathematics students need guidance and explicit
attention to linguistic conventions in the discipline. This book aims to offer such

xii
Preface
help, especially in earlier sections, before the mathematical and linguistic subtlety
ramp up—together.
Redoing some elementary calculus topics “right.” A beginning analysis course
can help students deepen and consolidate their understanding of calculus ideas.
For example, few students seem to make deep sense of inﬁnite series on that ﬁrst
dreaded pass, usually in Calculus 2. Students who study sequence convergence
carefully, as in the course envisioned here, are in a far better position to make
sense of abstract questions of series convergence and divergence and to go deeper
into such topics as estimation of series “tails.”
Focus on the basics. This book focuses on (what I take to be) basic elements of
the theory; neither compactness nor the Lebesgue integral is covered, for instance.
This is intentional: I’ve willingly traded “coverage” for “simplicity.” (Instructors
who want to go deeper can readily do so; see below for suggestions.) Covering
fewer topics, moreover, leaves room for more narrative discussion and concrete
examples, of which there are many. To put it another way, I try to look closely at
relatively simple things.
Many examples, many solutions. The book contains many worked-out exam-
ples and quite a few detailed solutions to exercises, especially in earlier sections.
I believe that many students learn theory largely “inductively,” from examples,
and that detailed solutions to a substantial number of problems can usefully illus-
trate, for newcomers, the language and conventions of mathematical discourse.
Reader-friendly style. I’ve aimed for a friendly-but-serious narrative style. The
marginal notes, for instance, are intended mainly as brief nudges, pointers to “dan-
gerous curves,” or just friendly asides. It takes two to achieve friendliness, of
course, so the verdict is ultimately up to the reader.
Increasing sophistication. Mathematical depth and technical sophistication grad-
ually increase over the chapters. Chapter 1, for instance, is quite leisurely, while
Chapter 5, on the Riemann integral, is relatively technical (like the integral itself)
and business-like.
Using This Book
Following are some suggestions for using this book.
A one-semester course? This book is designed for use in one typical college
semester, but there is more material here than I would cover in that time, except
perhaps with veterans of a proofs course. With a less experienced class I might
omit the coverage of inﬁnite series, for instance, to concentrate more heavily on

Preface
xiii
integrals. Or one could omit integrals entirely, and go into more depth on series,
sequences, and derivatives.
Supplementary topics. Real analysis offers many possibilities for group or in-
dividual projects on supplementary topics. These can be especially useful with
unusually well-prepared or highly talented students, who can otherwise be bored
in a class of less highly selected students. Here are some ideas; all are readily
researchable in books or online by motivated students:
• The Cantor–Banach–Bernstein theorem: if f : A →B and g : B →A are
injective, then there is a bijection h : A →B.
• Exploring the limit superior and the limit inferior (a “guided discovery” on
this topic appears in the book).
• Exploring Taylor polynomials and remainder theorems (Taylor’s theorem
is mentioned, but only brieﬂy).
• Exploring compactness of subsets of R, the Heine–Borel theorem, and con-
nections with boundedness of functions and convergence of sequences.
• Exploring deeper properties of the Riemann integral. Suppose, for instance,
that a function f is integrable on [0, 1] and f(x) > 0 for all x. Showing
rigorously that
R 1
0 f > 0 is harder than it might seem, and it raises good
questions about monotonicity, points of continuity, and integrability.


CHAPTER 1
Preliminaries: Numbers, Sets,
Proofs, and Bounds
1.1
Numbers 101: The Very Basics
Real analysis is all about real-valued functions of a real variable, so an obvious
early step is to understand basic properties of the set of real numbers. Many of
these properties are related to or inherited from slightly simpler sets, such as the
integers and the rational numbers. We reserve some special symbols for these
important sets:∗
N = {1, 2, 3, . . .} :
the natural numbers;
Z = {. . . , −2, −1, 0, 1, 2, . . .} :
the integers;
Q :
the rational numbers;
R :
the real numbers.
Using these symbols we can discuss these sets clearly and efﬁciently, with sen-
tences like the following:
N ⊆Z ⊆Q ⊆R;
42
43 ∈Q;
√
152399025 ∈Z;
√
93 ∈R \ Q.
What each of these symbol strings says should be clear. Whether each claim is
The last one says that
√
93 is
real but not rational. Notice the
funny “setminus” sign.
true or false is less obvious—but that’s a matter of mathematics, not of symbolic
clarity. As it turns out, all four claims are true; proving the last assertion takes
some effort.
We’ll see a proof soon; for now
the proof is beside the point.
Set notation is useful and efﬁcient, but only when used correctly. Something
is amiss, for instance, with each of the following expressions:
(i) R ∈Q;
(ii) 3.1 ⊃N;
(iii)
√
N ⊆R.
∗The special font can help avoid confusion with other sets. The choices N and R are made for
obvious reasons; Q and Z remind us of quotient and Zahlen (German for “numbers”), respectively.
The symbol C can denote the set of complex numbers.

1. Preliminaries: Numbers, Sets, Proofs, and Bounds
A charitable reader might try to make sense of (i)–(iii), but their problems are
ultimately fatal—none really makes sense. (A nicer way to say this is to refer to
errors of syntax.) The problem with (i), for instance, is not the (true!) fact that
real numbers may be irrational, but rather that R is a set of numbers, and hence
not even in the running to be an element of the set of rationals. Expression (ii) is
meaningless for similar reasons, and (iii) is even worse: the expression
√
N has
no clear meaning, so the question of containment in R is moot.
EXAMPLE 1.
Does each of the following symbolic claims make sense? If a
claim makes sense, is it true or false?
(i) Q ∈R;
(ii) 106π ∈Q;
(iii) if a ∈Q and b ∈Q then a + b ∈Q.
SOLUTION.
Statement (i) makes no sense—Q is the wrong type of object to
be an element of R. Claim (ii) asserts—meaningfully but falsely—that 106π is
rational. Claim (iii) also makes good sense; it says that the sum of two rational
If 106π were a quotient of
integers, π would be rational,
too, which it isn’t.
numbers is another rational number. This, too, is true, because the sum of two
“fractions” is another “fraction.”
♦
Integers, Rationals, and Reals
What exactly is a real number?
The question may seem absurd. Nobody reading this book will balk at expres-
sions like
sin
π
4

=
√

and
Z 1
0
ex dx = e −1,
both of which are rich stews of integers, fractions, and irrational numbers. We
will not deny or ignore your earlier experience—all of it will be useful—but aim
to sharpen intuition and make assumptions explicit.
As a look ahead consider, for instance, the expression
lim
x→π
f(x) −f(π)
x −π
= f ′(π),
which describes a certain derivative. Making clear sense of such an expression,
It’s f ′(π), as we know from
beginning calculus.
as we’ll need to do later in studying derivatives, depends on various properties of
real numbers. Here are some early hints:
• Real arithmetic: The fractional expression
f(x) −f(π)
x −π

1.1. Numbers 101: The Very Basics

is built up using subtraction and division of the real numbers x, π, f(x),
and f(π), at least some of which are irrational. Depending on its deﬁnition,
the function f may require additional arithmetic operations on reals.
• Approximation and distance: The idea of limit entails one quantity “ap-
proaching” another, in a subtle sense that we’ll soon work hard to make
precise. But it is clear already that we won’t get far without some notion of
“distance” between numbers, and we’ll need to know that any real number,
say π, has plenty of “near” neighbors along which an “approach” to π can
be made.
• No gaps: For any limit to exist there needs to be a value for the quantity in
question to approach; if the real numbers had “gaps” there could be trou-
ble. This modest-seeming requirement, called completeness, turns out to be
subtler than it might ﬁrst seem. We’ll revisit it soon.
Integers. We’ll build up our description of the real numbers by starting with sim-
pler sets: ﬁrst Z and then Q. What’s “simpler” depends, of course, on the situa-
tion. To a number theorist, for instance, there is nothing simple about the integers.
In real analysis, however, we’ll need only basic, familiar properties of the integers,
and we’ll usually take these as “known.” We’ll accept without fuss, for instance,
that equations like
a + b = b + a,
ab = ba,
(a + b)c = ac + bc,
and
(3a −5b)(2a −7b) = 6a2 −31ab + 35b2
make sense, and hold true, for any integers a, b, and c. We also “know” that every
integer a has an additive inverse, −a, but that a multiplicative inverse, 1/a, need
What happens if a = 0?
not be an integer.
The well-ordering property. Here’s another basic fact we’ll just assume: Every
nonempty set of positive integers has a least element. This fact is known formally
as the well-ordering property of the positive integers. The name may be myste-
rious but the property itself should be familiar and believable from experience.
It comes from set theory—not
our subject here.
Among all even positive multiples of 7, for instance, 14 is smallest. We’ll take
the well-ordering property as an axiom, not as a theorem to be proved.
In more formal discussion the
property is sometimes proved to
follow from even simpler
axioms.
Rational numbers. Basic algebraic properties of Q are equally familiar. All four
equations above, for example, hold just as well for rational numbers a, b, and
c as for integers. Because nonzero rational numbers have (rational) reciprocals,
equations and expressions that involve division can now make sense. Here are
three examples:
p + q
r

r + q
r ;

r = p q

p.

1. Preliminaries: Numbers, Sets, Proofs, and Bounds
All are true, of course, whenever p, q, and r are rational numbers and all denomi-
nators are nonzero.
In later work we’ll freely use such familiar facts, usually without comment.
Right now it is a good exercise to derive some properties of Q, assuming basic
properties of Z.
For us a rational number r is just a ratio of integers:
r = a
b ,
where a, b ∈Z and b ̸= 0.
Of course, any given rational number has many possible forms:
2
3 = 14
21 = −222
−333 = 88
132 = . . . ;
the ﬁrst form, in which numerator and denominator have no common factors, is
called reduced.
EXAMPLE 2.
Prove—assuming basic properties of integer arithmetic—that if p
and q are any rational numbers, then p + q ∈Q and p + q = q + p.
SOLUTION.
The proof is direct: We start with the hypothesis and derive the
conclusions. Because p and q are rational, we can write
p = a
b
and
q = c
d,
where a, b, c, d ∈Z and b ̸= 0 ̸= d. Now we add fractions:
p + q = a
b + c
d = ad + cb
bd
,
which exhibits p + q as the desired ratio of integers. (Both numerator and de-
nominator are integers, and the denominator is nonzero, thanks to basic integer
arithmetic, which we take as known.)
Also,
q + p = c
d + a
b = cb + ad
db
= ad + cb
bd
,
where the last equality follows from commutativity of integer operations. The last
expression is just what we calculated earlier for p + q, so we’re done.

with pq = 1. (In other words, q deserves the name 1/p.)

SOLUTION.
We’ll give an explicit formula for q.
The hypothesis means that there are nonzero integers a and b with p = a/b.
Now q = b/a does the job, since
pq = ab
ab = 1.
♦
Q is a ﬁeld. The following theorem says, in mathematical parlance, that Q is a
ﬁeld.
Nothing in the theorem should
surprise you; the point is to
collect and formalize key
properties.
Theorem 1.1. The set Q has the following properties:
• Two operations: Addition and multiplication are operations on Q: if p and
q are any rational numbers, then so are p + q and pq.
• Commutativity: Addition and multiplication are commutative operations:
if p and q are any rational numbers, then p + q = q + p and pq = qp.
• Associative operations: Addition and multiplication are associative opera-
tions: if p, q, and r are any rational numbers, then (p+q)+r = p+(q+r)
and (pq)r = p(qr).
• Identities: The rational number zero is an additive identity: 0 + p = p
holds for all p ∈Q. The rational number one is a multiplicative identity:
1p = p holds for all p ∈Q.
• Inverses: For every rational number p, the rational number −p is an ad-
ditive inverse: p + (−p) = 0. For every nonzero rational number p, the
rational number 1/p is a multiplicative inverse: p · 1/p = 1.
• Distributivity: Multiplication distributes across addition: For any rationals
p, q, and r, p(q + r) = pq + pr.
All parts of the theorem can be proved in the spirit of the preceding examples,
assuming similar properties of Z. But ...
EXAMPLE 4.
Z is not a ﬁeld. Why not?
SOLUTION.
To be a ﬁeld, a set must satisfy each of the long list of properties
in Theorem 1.1. Proving all this can be daunting. But there’s a happy ﬂip side:
Disproving that Z is a ﬁeld is easy. It is enough to ﬁnd just one property that fails
for Z, and for this even a single counterexample sufﬁces. We could just observe,
for instance, that the integer 42 has no multiplicative inverse among the integers,
and leave it at that.

Q is not R. The set Q is clearly inﬁnite—it contains all the integers, for one thing.
A bit less obvious, perhaps, is the fact that between any two different rationals lie
inﬁnitely many more rationals. Between 3.14 and 3.15, for instance, lie
3.141, 3.142, . . . , 3.149, 3.1411, 3.1412, . . . , 3.14237568, 3.14237569, . . .
and so on. With so many rational numbers around, one might wonder whether
there are any irrationals—numbers that cannot be written as ratios of integers.
Nowadays everybody “knows” the answer:
√
2,
√
3,

2, π, e, and many
other favorite numbers are all irrational. But none of these facts is completely
trivial. Indeed, the Pythagoreans (around 500 BCE) saw all numbers as rational.
By some accounts, they drowned the philosopher Hippasus as a heretic after he
demonstrated that a square of side 1 has irrational diagonal. We’ll take that risk
and still give a proof.
Theorem 1.2.
√
2 is irrational.
Proof:
The proof is by contradiction: Assuming
√
2 is rational, we’ll derive an

this one exploits basic
properties of integers.
absurdity.
Assume, then, that
√
2 is rational. We can write
√
2 = a
b , for some positive
integers a and b, not both even. (If both were even we could cancel a common
factor of 2.) Next we do some algebra:
√
2 = a
b
=⇒
2 = a2
b2
=⇒
2b2 = a2.
Now 2b2 is certainly even, and so a2 must be even, too. But then a itself must be
even; otherwise, a2 would be odd. Thus we can write a = 2c for some integer c,
and we have
2b2 = a2 = 4c2
=⇒
b2 = 2c2.
This implies that b (like a) is even, which contradicts our earlier assumption, and
completes the proof.
□
The following more general theorem can be proved by similar means. It shows,

too, that the set of irrational numbers, or R \ Q, has inﬁnitely many members.
Theorem 1.3. If the positive integer n is not a perfect square, then √n is irra-
tional. In symbols, √n ∈R \ Q.
Inﬁnitely many irrationals for the price of one. It took some work to ﬁnd even
one irrational number. This done, however, it is surprisingly easy to ﬁnd many,
many more irrationals.

xr,
x + r,
x −r,
1/x,

and
r
x
are all irrational.
Proof: There is less to this than meets the eye. Everything boils down to the
ﬁeld properties of Q, listed in Theorem 1.1. For example, suppose (aiming for
a contradiction) that xr is rational. We know from Theorem 1.1 that 1/r is also
rational, and so the product
xr × 1
r = x
is rational, too. This contradicts our hypothesis, and so xr must be irrational. The
remaining parts are similar, and are left as exercises.

Real numbers. So what is a real number?
For us, the set R is the union of all the rational and all the irrational numbers.

our informal view is a good start, and we’ll deepen it in the next section as we
study properties and alternative ways of viewing the real numbers.

attributed to Fermat.)
If

2 = a/b holds for any positive integers a and b, then there must be a
smallest possible b, in the sense that no smaller denominator works. Let
such a and b be given; note that 2b2 = a2. Now consider the new fraction

15. We know from elementary calculus that ln n tends to inﬁnity (“blows up”)
slowly as n tends to inﬁnity. It follows that ln ln ln n also tends to inﬁnity,
but slower still. Use the well-ordering property to explain why there must
be a least positive integer n0 such that ln ln ln n0 > 2. (Notes: Finding n0
exactly would be tricky, since n0 is very, very large. For fun, try to estimate
how many digits n0 has.)

set N:
If S ⊂N and S ̸= ∅, then S has a least element.
Give informal answers, not formal proofs, in each part following.
(a) Does Q have the well-ordering property? (In other words, does every
nonempty subset of Q have a least element?) Why or why not?
(b) Does the set R = { 1, 10, 100, 1000, . . . } have the well-ordering
property? Why or why not?
(c) Does the set T = { −3, −2, −1, . . . , 41, 42 } have the well-ordering
property? Why or why not?

above. Does the result hold for N? For T ? For Z \ N?

Sets 101: Getting Started
This section is a brief introduction to (or review of) rudiments of set theory that
play some role in real analysis. An important purpose is to establish vocabulary
and notations that will help us streamline later discussions.
A set is any collection of objects, called elements of the set. Here are some
samples:
A = {January, February, March, ..., December} ,
B = {January, March, May, July, August, October, December} ,
C =

1, {2, 3}, x2 + 1, November, elephant
	
,
D = {2, 3} ,
I = [2, 3] = {x | 2 ≤x ≤3} ,
N = {1, 2, 3, . . .} ,
∅= the empty set.
Observe:

1.2. Sets 101: Getting Started
11
• Names: It is common, but not required, to use uppercase letters to denote
sets. For a few very special sets, like N and ∅above, we use special charac-
ters.
• Looks can deceive: The sets D = {2, 3} and I = [2, 3] bear some typo-
graphical resemblance but are otherwise very different—D has only two
elements while I, like every nonempty interval, has inﬁnitely many.
• Different descriptions: Sets can be described in various ways. For B, C,
and D, for instance, we listed each set’s elements explicitly. For A, I, and
N we described a pattern or condition that elements must satisfy. What
really matters is clarity.
• Weird sets: The strange set C illustrates that a set’s elements may be quite
different from each other. In particular, a set may contain other sets as ele-
ments. We’ll usually stick to relatively tame sets in studying real analysis.
Notations and operations. Standard symbols let us describe set properties and
operations clearly and concisely. Just a few go a long way:
• Subsets and containment: The expression B ⊂A says (truthfully for the
sets above) that B is a subset of A; the C-like symbol suggests containment.
If B ⊊A, then B is a proper subset of A.
In a similar spirit, all of these expressions:
A ⊃B;
B ⊆A;
B ⊊A;
I ⊇D;
∅⊆D
describe various containment relations.
Are they all true of the sets
above?
• Membership: The expression a ∈A means that a is an element of A. Here
Read ∈as “in.”
are some (true) examples for the sets above:
March ∈A;
2 ∈D;
April /∈B;
{2, 3} ∈C;
{2, 3} /∈I.
The last two claims might be surprising. Notice that the set {2, 3} is indeed
an element of the peculiar set C, but not of I, which contains only numbers.
On the other hand, {2,3} ⊂I.
• New sets from old: Any two sets S and T can be combined in various ways
to form new sets:
union :
S ∪T = {x | x ∈S or x ∈T };
intersection :
S ∩T = {x | x ∈S and x ∈T };
set difference :
S \ T = {x | x ∈S and x /∈T };
Cartesian product :
S × T = {(x, y) | x ∈S and y ∈T }.

12
1. Preliminaries: Numbers, Sets, Proofs, and Bounds
Here are some (true) examples from the sets above; note that all quantities
in question are sets:
A ∩C = {November};
A ∪B = A;
A ∩B = B;
A \ B = {February, April, June, September, November} ;
B \ A = ∅;
A × N = {(m, n) | m is a month and n is a positive integer} .
• Handling complements: The sets Q of rationals and P of irrationals are
complementary in R in an obvious way:
P ∩Q = ∅
and
P ∪Q = R.
Notice, too, that P = R \ Q and Q = R \ P.
For any set A ⊆R, we call R \ A the complement of A in R. In the
same spirit, A is the complement of R \ A, and it’s easy to check that
R \ (R \ A) = A.
De Morgan’s laws connect complements with unions and intersections.
Named for an inﬂuential
Victorian-era English
mathematician—and textbook
writer.
For any two subsets A1 and A2 of R, De Morgan’s laws assert the following
identities:
R \ (A1 ∪A2) = (R \ A1) ∩R \ A2)
R \ (A1 ∩A2) = (R \ A1) ∪R \ A2)
Similar rules hold for unions and intersections of more than two subsets of
R. We’ll use these rules in coming chapters; a proof is in the exercises.
Analogous rules hold for
inﬁnitely many Ai, too.
EXAMPLE 1.
What do De Morgan’s laws say if A1 = Q and A2 is the set of
negative numbers?
SOLUTION.
Here A1 ∩A2 is the set of negative rationals, so R \ (A1 ∩A2) is
the set of numbers that are not negative rationals. Similarly, R \ A1 is the set of
irrationals, and R\A2 is the set of nonnegative numbers. The relevant De Morgan
law asserts that
R \ (A1 ∩A2) = (R \ A1) ∪R \ A2).
In our situation, this means, plausibly enough, that a number is not a negative
rational if and only if it is either irrational or nonnegative or both.
The notation seems formal, but
the claim makes common
sense.
The set A1 ∪A2 is the set of numbers that are either rational or negative or
both. De Morgan’s other law,
R \ (A1 ∪A2) = (R \ A1) ∩R \ A2),
also makes good sense: numbers not in A1 ∪A2 are neither rational nor negative.

Decoding set language. Statements about sets may involve complicated or tricky
symbolic combinations. Making sense of them takes careful reading.
EXAMPLE 2.
Let Z, Q, and R denote (as usual) the sets of integers, rationals,
and reals, respectively, and consider the sets
S =

x ∈R | x2 −x −1 = 0
	
;
T =

x ∈R | x2 −x −1 > 5
	
.
The sets S and T illustrate set-builder notation: they are “built” from a larger set
using a selection rule or membership criterion. (The vertical bar | means some-
thing like “such that.”)
What does each of the following assertions mean? Which are true?
(i) S ∈Z;
(ii) S ⊂Q;
(iii) S ⊂R \ Q;
(iv) 4 ∈T.
SOLUTION.
Statement (i) says that S—a set of numbers—is itself an integer;
this is clearly false. Statements (ii) and (iii) make better sense; (ii) says that all
roots of x2 −x−1 are rational, while (iii) says that these same roots are irrational.
Who’s right? Well, by the quadratic formula, the two roots are (1 ±
√
5)/2, both
of which are real but irrational, so (iii) is true and (ii) is false. Statement (iv) boils
down to the claim that 42 −4 −1 > 5, which is clearly true.
We might, by the way, have saved some work by ﬁrst rewriting S and T in
simpler or different forms. As we’ve seen,
S =

.

and x = 3, and so
T = {x ∈R | x < −2 or x > 3} .

Intervals. Intervals in the real line are familiar but useful sets in studying real
analysis. Calculus veterans have seen countless examples; we collect a few as
reminders of the possible variety and of some useful descriptive language.

1. Preliminaries: Numbers, Sets, Proofs, and Bounds
In particular, closed intervals contain their endpoints, if any, while open in-
tervals do not.
All intervals, open or closed, bounded or unbounded, share two
deﬁning properties:
Deﬁnition 1.5. A set I ⊂R is an interval if (i) I contains at least two points;
(ii) if a and b are in I and a < x < b, then x ∈I, too.
EXAMPLE 3.
Let I and J be any two intervals. What possible forms can the
intersection I ∩J take?
SOLUTION. The intervals I and J might miss each other entirely; then I∩J = ∅.
Or I and J might intersect in a single point, as do I = [1, 3] and J = [3, 5]. More
interesting is the fact that only one other possibility exists: If I ∩J contains at
least two points, then I ∩J is an interval.
The hard way to prove this is to handle many special cases, depending on
whether each of I and J is open, closed, bounded, unbounded, etc. The easy way
is to use Deﬁnition 1.5, in which only (ii) is a live question.
Suppose, then, that both a and b are in I ∩J, and a < x < b. Since I is an
interval, Deﬁnition 1.5 guarantees that x ∈I. For the same reason, we must have
x ∈J, too. Thus x ∈I ∩J, and we’re done.
♦
Open sets: a look ahead. Open intervals are sets like (1, 3) and (−∞, 42) that
don’t contain any endpoints. More generally, any set U ⊂R is called (topologi-
cally) open if U is the union of any collection (empty, ﬁnite, or inﬁnite) of open
intervals. A set A ⊆R is called closed if A = R \ U, where U is open. In other
We get serious about basics of
topology later. This is just a
taste.
words, closed sets are complements of open sets.
Example 4 shows that this new terminology plays well with what’s already
familiar.
EXAMPLE 4.
Among the sets
(1, 3),
R,
[1, 3],
{42},
{42} ∪[1, 3],
which are open or closed? What about ∅?
SOLUTION.
The sets (1, 3) and R = (−∞, ∞) are open intervals, and therefore
also open in the topological sense. For the other sets, we study complements:
[1, 3] = R \ ((−∞, 1) ∪(3, ∞))
and
{42} = R \ ((−∞, 42) ∪(42, ∞))
Both of these complements are unions of open intervals and are therefore open
sets; hence both [1, 3] and {42} are closed sets. The complement of {42} ∪[1, 3]
It would be troubling if [1, 3]
were not closed.
is the union of three open intervals, so {42} ∪[1, 3] is also closed.

1.2. Sets 101: Getting Started
15
Here comes a twist: As the union of an empty collection of open intervals, the
empty set ∅is open. As the complement of the open set R, ∅is also closed. As
the complement of ∅, R is also closed. Thus, R and ∅turn out to be both open and
closed.

1.3
Sets 102: The Idea of a Function
In everyday mathematics we might discuss “the tangent function” or “the function
f(x) = x2.” In a calculus course such language may be ﬁne, but in other settings
we’ll need a more general description of functions—using the language of sets.
Deﬁnition 1.6. Let A and B be nonempty sets. A function f : A →B is a rule
for assigning to each “input” element a in A one and only one “output” element,
f(a), in B. Here A is the domain of f and B is the codomain.
In other words. Alternative language is available. A function f is sometimes
called a mapping, and we say that f maps a domain element a to a codomain
element b, sometimes called the image of a. In symbols, we might write f : a 7→
b, or just a 7→b if the function name is understood.
EXAMPLE 1.
How is the “calculus description” f(x) = x2 related to the formal
deﬁnition?
SOLUTION.
The formula f(x) = x2 makes the rule perfectly clear: For inputs
−3,
√
2, and 1.2345, the corresponding outputs are f(−3) = 9, f(
√
2) = 2, and
f(1.2345) = 1.23452. The domain and the codomain, on the other hand, are open
to choice. In a calculus course we might, if pressed, use the natural domain—the
set of all real numbers for which the rule makes sense. For f(x) = x2, that’s R
itself. (For g(x) = tan(x), the natural domain omits some real numbers.) In a
number theory course, we might use N as domain.
The codomain, too, is open to choice. For a given domain, we need only as-
sure that the codomain contains all possible outputs. With domain R, for instance,
we could use as codomain for f(x) = x2 any set that contains all the nonnegative
reals. This might be R itself, the inﬁnite interval [0, ∞), or something stranger,
like (−42, ∞) or C. With domain N, we could reuse N as codomain, or choose
any set of integers that contains all positive perfect squares.
♦
The moral. The preceding example shows that a function is more than a formula.
A function is a 3-part package: a domain A, a codomain B, and a rule (which may
or may not be a symbolic formula) for assigning a unique output b = f(a) in B to
every input a in A. The notation f : A →B emphasizes this three-fold nature. In

20
1. Preliminaries: Numbers, Sets, Proofs, and Bounds
practice the domain or codomain or both are sometimes understood from context,
or even ignored, but they’re always waiting in the wings.
Range and codomain. The range (or image set) of a function f : A →B is the
set of all outputs:
range of f = {f(a) | a ∈A} .
Note that the range is always a subset—perhaps a proper subset—of the codomain.
For f : R →R given by f(x) = x2, for instance, the range is the interval [0, ∞),
which omits all the negative numbers.
Function examples. A good way to explore functions is through examples and
non-examples, including some strange ones with strange names. (We’ll usually
stick with one-letter function names, although longer, more descriptive names are
perfectly legal.)
EXAMPLE 2.
Consider the sets
A = {January, February, March, ..., December} ;
N12 = {1, 2, 3, . . ., 12} ;
P = {Alice, Bob, Carol, Dave} .
Is each of the following a function?
• MONTHNUMBER : A →N12, where MONTHNUMBER(January) = 1,
MONTHNUMBER(February) = 2, ..., MONTHNUMBER(December) = 12.
• WORDLENGTH : A →N12, where WORDLENGTH(a) is the number of
letters in a.
• BIRTHMONTH : P →A, where BIRTHMONTH(p) is the month in which
p was born.
• j : P →N12, where j(p) = MONTHNUMBER (BIRTHMONTH(p)).
• SQUARE : N12 →N12, where SQUARE(n) = n2.
SOLUTION.
All of MONTHNUMBER, WORDLENGTH, BIRTHMONTH, and j
are functions. In each case, every member of the domain is paired with one and
only one member of the codomain. Some of the rules are admittedly peculiar.
To ﬁnd BIRTHMONTH(Alice) and j(Alice), for instance, we would need more
information. Still, the rules make sense because everyone has a unique birth
We could “ﬁx” this problem by
choosing a larger codomain,
such as N.
month. By contrast, SQUARE has a problem: Squaring members of N12 produces
results outside N12.

21
Seeing Functions
Graphs. Graphs are deservedly popular in elementary calculus. Properties like
smoothness, steepness, rising vs. falling, concavity, and existence of asymptotes
reﬂect and reveal a lot about functions.
A less familiar fact is that, like functions, graphs can also be described in
the language of sets. The graph of a calculus-style function, say, f(x) = x2, is
a curve in the xy-plane, made up of points of the form (x, f(x))—in this case,
(x, x2). But the idea of a graph makes sense for any function:
Deﬁnition 1.7. Let f : A →B be a function. The graph of f is the set
G = {(a, b) | a ∈A and b = f(a)} .
Observe:
• A graph is a set: The graph of f is a certain set of ordered pairs, and thus
a subset of the Cartesian product A × B.
• But not just any set: For f to be a function with domain A, its graph G
must contain one and only one point (a, b) for each a ∈A. The graph of
a function f : R →R, for instance, must contain exactly one point of the
form (3, y).
In pre-calculus lingo, this is the
vertical line test.
• Maybe a curve, maybe not: Graphs of calculus-style functions are often nice
curves. Indeed, a lot of beginning calculus is about connecting geometric
properties of curves to analytic properties of functions. But some functions
have graphs that are nothing like curves. The graph of j in Example 2, for
instance, has points of the form (Carol, February)!
• Other “graphs” out there: Like other useful math words, “graph” has dif-
ferent meanings in different settings. The graph of an equation, for exam-
ple, is the set of points (x, y) for which x and y satisfy the equation. The
graph of x2+y2 = 1 is a circle, and therefore not the graph of any function.
In this book, “graph” will refer only to functions.
• One idea, two views: A function and its graph are so closely linked—either
one completely determines the other—that functions are sometimes de-
ﬁned, rather than just visualized, as sets of ordered pairs. We’ll use both
From this perspective, functions
are sets in their own right.
of these viewpoints freely.
Other views. For some functions, geometric graphs make little sense, so we
use other descriptive devices—tables, diagrams, etc. To describe the function
BIRTHMONTH in Example 2, for instance, we could use a table:

22
1. Preliminaries: Numbers, Sets, Proofs, and Bounds
The BIRTHMONTH function
input (person)
Alice
Bob
Carol
Dave
output (month)
May
December
December
August
We could also use a diagram to describe BIRTHMONTH, showing the domain, the
codomain, and arrows connecting inputs p to their corresponding outputs h(p).
(In such a view, the range is the set of “arrowheads,” where incoming arrows
“land.”)
Draw your own diagram for
BIRTHMONTH.
Yet another, even less formal notation is sometimes useful. To describe the
MONTHNUMBER function, we could just write
January 7→1,
February 7→2,
March 7→3,
. . . ,
December 7→12
to convey the idea. (The 7→symbol is usually read as “maps to.”)
All Kinds of Functions
Functions come in many varieties. We will now deﬁne and illustrate, mainly using
“toy” functions, some properties a given function may or may not have.
Deﬁnition 1.8 (One-to-one functions). A function f : A →B is one-to-one (or
injective) if f(a1) ̸= f(a2) whenever a1 and a2 are in A and a1 ̸= a2. In equiva-
lent words: f maps different inputs to different outputs. In equivalent symbols:
Convince yourself of the
equivalence.
f(a1) = f(a2)
=⇒
a1 = a2.
The next two examples will help illustrate the meaning of—and how to prove or
disprove—injectivity.
EXAMPLE 3.
The BIRTHMONTH function from Example 2 is not one-to-one,
because BIRTHMONTH(Bob) = BIRTHMONTH(Carol) = December, even though
Bob ̸= Carol. By contrast, MONTHNUMBER, which maps each month to its

that give the same output is
enough.
number in the year, is one-to-one. The “inclusion” function i : Q →R with rule
i(x) = x is one-to-one, since outputs are inputs. The constant function c : R →R
with rule c(x) = 3 is at the opposite extreme—all inputs are mapped to the same
output.
The linear function L : R →R given by L(x) = 3x + 5 is also one-to-one.
To prove this, let’s check the equation in Deﬁnition 1.8, using some algebra:
L(x1) = L(x2)
=⇒
3x1 + 5 = 3x2 + 5
=⇒
3x1 = 3x2
=⇒
x1 = x2,
as desired.
♦

1.3. Sets 102: The Idea of a Function
23
Deﬁnition 1.9 (Onto functions). A function f : A →B is onto (or surjective) if,
Using “onto” as an adjective
sounds ugly, but everybody
does it.
for every b ∈B, there is some a ∈A with f(a) = b. In equivalent words: Every
element of the codomain is also in the range. In equivalent symbols:
{f(a) | a ∈A} = B.
EXAMPLE 4.
The function BIRTHMONTH from Example 2 is not onto, because
no member of P was born in (say) March. The function MONTHNUMBER : A →
Finding even one such
codomain member is enough.
N12 is onto, because the 12 months range in number from 1 to 12. The “inclusion”
i : Q →R with rule i(x) = x is not onto, because the codomain includes
irrationals, but the range does not.
Is the quadratic function q : R →R given by q(x) = x2 −6x surjective?
The short answer is no: A little calculus or algebra shows that q(3) = −9 is the
minimum value, so the range of q is the interval [−9, ∞), a smaller set than the
codomain. We could make q surjective by using [−9, ∞), not R, as the codomain.
♦
Bijective functions. A function that is both injective and surjective is called bijec-
tive, or, equivalently, a one-to-one correspondence. Our MONTHNUMBER func-
tion is one bijection. Another is suggested by a few values:
What are the domain and
codomain? What’s a good
name for this function?
1 7→a,
2 7→b,
3 7→c,
. . . ,
25 7→y,
26 7→z.
Here are two bijections from calculus, this time in a matched pair:
f :

−π
2 , π


→R,
with rule
f(x) = tan(x)
g : R →

−π
2 , π
2

,
with rule
g(x) = tan−1(x).
You can readily convince yourself, perhaps with graphs, that f and g are indeed
one-to-one and onto. But notice a little surprise: f and g are one-to-one cor-
respondences between an interval of ﬁnite length and the entire real line. Such
strange behavior is possible when inﬁnite sets are involved; we will explore inﬁ-
nite sets further in a later section.
New Functions from Old
Elementary calculus courses are full of complicated functions, like
f(x) = sin x + (1 + ex) sin (x + ex) ,
concocted in various ways from simpler ingredients. Tools like the product rule,
the chain rule, and u-substitution help us ﬁnd derivatives and antiderivatives of
such built-up functions as appropriate combinations of simpler derivatives and
antiderivatives.

24
1. Preliminaries: Numbers, Sets, Proofs, and Bounds
Composition. Among these familiar ways to combine functions, composition is
not quite like the others, requiring some special care with domains and codomains.
If f : A →B and g : B →C are functions, then we can compose f and g to
form the new function
g ◦f : A →C,
with rule
g ◦f(a) = g(f(a)).
Recall, especially, that order matters: The notation g ◦f means that g follows f.
This makes sense with respect
to nested parentheses—but it
goes against the usual grain of
reading from left to right.
The two compositions g ◦f and f ◦g are seldom equal—even if both make good
sense.†
EXAMPLE 5.
Which compositions make sense for the functions
MONTHNUMBER : A →N12,
WORDLENGTH : A →N12,
and
BIRTHMONTH : P →A
from Example 2?
SOLUTION.
The compositions
WORDLENGTH ◦BIRTHMONTH : P →N12
and
MONTHNUMBER ◦BIRTHMONTH : P →N12
make sense (the former is the function we called j in Example 2). For instance,
WORDLENGTH ◦BIRTHMONTH(Carol) = WORDLENGTH(December) = 8
and
MONTHNUMBER◦BIRTHMONTH(Carol) = MONTHNUMBER(December) = 12.
Another possibility, SQUARE ◦MONTHNUMBER : A →N12, fails right out
of the box, because SQUARE : N12 →N12 isn’t a function at all. But there is an
We explained why in
Example 2.
easy ﬁx: If we use the almost-identical function
SQUARE : N →N,
with rule
SQUARE(n) = n2,
†A minor technical point: Above, to avoid extra notation, we used the same symbol, B, both for
the codomain of f and for the domain of g. In fact, these sets need not be identical. What really
matters is that the composition rule g ◦f(a) = g(f(a)) make good sense. This occurs as long as the
range of f is contained in the domain of g. As we have seen, a function’s codomain is often open to
some choice, so this subtlety seldom causes difﬁculty.

1.3. Sets 102: The Idea of a Function
25
then the composition SQUARE ◦MONTHNUMBER : A →N makes good sense,
and (say)
SQUARE ◦MONTHNUMBER(March) = SQUARE(5) = 25.
Many other compositions, like
BIRTHMONTH ◦BIRTHMONTH
and
BIRTHMONTH ◦WORDLENGTH,
make no sense.
♦
Properties of composite functions. If both f and g are, say, injective, must g ◦f
be injective too? We answer several such questions in the following theorem,
leaving some proofs to the exercises.
Theorem 1.10. Let f : A →B and g : B →C be functions.
(i) If both f and g are one-to-one, then so is g ◦f.
(ii) If both f and g are onto, then so is g ◦f.
(iii) If both f and g are bijective, then so is g ◦f.
(iv) If g ◦f is one-to-one, then so is f.
(v) If g ◦f is onto, then so is g.
Notes on proofs. We’ll prove (ii) and (iv), leaving (i) and (v) to the exercises.
Statement (iii) just combines (i) and (ii), so there is nothing new to prove.
To prove (ii) we need to show that for any c ∈C there is some a ∈A with
g ◦f(a) = c. We can do this directly. For given c ∈C, we know (because g is
onto) there exists b ∈B with g(b) = c. Because f is onto there exists a ∈A with
f(a) = b, and this a does the job: g ◦f(a) = g( f(a) ) = g(b) = c, as desired.
To prove (iv) we’ll show that if f is not one-to-one, then g ◦f cannot be one-
to-one either. (In math-speak, this is an indirect proof; more details on such things
in later sections.) Suppose, then, that a1 ̸= a2, but f(a1) = f(a2). Then we’d
have g( f(a1) ) = g( f(a2) ), which is just another way of saying that g ◦f(a1) =
g ◦f(a2). Thus g ◦f is not one-to-one, and the proof is done.
Note, ﬁnally, that g need not be one-to-one just because g ◦f is. The calculus
formula y = (ex + 1)2 illustrates this. (Let f(x) = ex + 1 and g(x) = x2; further
details are left to exercises.)

26
1. Preliminaries: Numbers, Sets, Proofs, and Bounds
Inverse Functions
Another important deﬁnition:
Deﬁnition 1.11 (Inverse functions). Let f : A →B and g : B →A be func-
tions. We say f and g are inverse functions if both
f( g(b) ) = b
for all b ∈B
and
g( f(a) ) = a
for all a ∈A.
In this case we can write f = g−1 or g = f −1.
Recall, ﬁrst, that “inverse” has several meanings in mathematics. For instance,
the numbers 3 and −3 are additive inverses because 3+(−3) = 0. Similarly, 3 and
1/3 are multiplicative inverses because 3×1/3 = 1, the multiplicative identity. In
a similar spirit, two functions are inverses if composing them (rather than adding
or multiplying) produces identity functions:
f ◦g(b) = b
for all b ∈B;
g ◦f(a) = a
for all a ∈A
The function MONTHNUMBER : A →N12 of Example 2 has a natural inverse
function—let’s call it NUMBERMONTH : N12 →A, with values as follows:
MONTHNUMBER(January) = 1;
NUMBERMONTH(1) = January;
. . .
MONTHNUMBER(December) = 12;
NUMBERMONTH(12) = December.
By contrast, WORDLENGTH : A →N12, which maps a month to its number of
letters, has no inverse function LENGTHWORD : N12 →A. One problem is that
WORDLENGTH(June) = 4 = WORDLENGTH(July),
so there’s no clear choice for LENGTHWORD(4). Another problem is that no
month has one letter, so there’s no sensible value for LENGTHWORD(1).
These toy examples suggest an important general fact: a function f : A →B
has an inverse g : B →A if—but only if—f is both one-to-one and onto. In this
case, f and g simply “reverse” each other’s work: if f maps a to b, then g maps b
to a, and vice versa.
Relations
Let A be a nonempty set, and f : A →A any function on A. We can think of f
as its graph Gf = {(a, f(a)) | a ∈A}. Note that Gf is a subset of A × A—but a
A function and its graph are
essentially the same thing.
subset with special properties that reﬂect the fact that f is a function. For instance,
Gf cannot contain two different elements of the form (a0, a1) and (a0, a2).
Deﬁnition 1.12 (Relation on a set). A relation R on a set A is any subset of A×
A. If (x, y) ∈R, we write x R y, and we say that x is related to y.

1.3. Sets 102: The Idea of a Function
27
This may sound forbiddingly abstract, but familiar (if lightly disguised) examples
are all around us.
• Functions are relations: The graph of any function f : N →N is a subset
of N × N, so f is also a relation, and we could write x f y instead of y =
f(x).
• Extreme examples: The extreme (but uninteresting) cases are R = N × N
and R = ∅. In the ﬁrst case, all pairs of integers are related; in the latter, no
integer has any relatives, even itself.
• Equality: The set
EQUALS = {(n, n) | n ∈N}
corresponds to the equality relation: each integer is related (i.e., equal) only
to itself. In this case, of course, we usually write n = n, not n EQUALS n.
• Order relations: The set
LESSTHAN = {(m, n) | m < n}
is an order relation: each integer is related to every integer larger than
itself. Again we have a handy symbol, and we write 3 < 4 instead of the
more cumbersome 3 LESSTHAN 4. (Similar relations correspond to other
ordering symbols: ≤, >, and ≥.)
• Divides: The set
DIVIDES = {(m, n) | m divides n evenly}
deﬁnes the “divides” relation, in which we ﬁnd 3 DIVIDES 123456, 42 DIVIDES 42,
and 1 DIVIDES n for all n. Number theorists use the handy symbol m | n
rather than m DIVIDES n.
Equivalence relations. The deﬁnition of a relation on A—any subset of A ×
A—is very, very general. In practice, many useful relations have some special
properties, with impressive names. An equivalence relation R on A is one that is
(i) reﬂexive: a R a for all a ∈A;
(ii) symmetric: if a R b, then b R a;
(iii) transitive: if a R b and b R c, then a R c.

1. Preliminaries: Numbers, Sets, Proofs, and Bounds
Equality (on any set) is the prototype and simplest—but not the only—example
of an equivalence relation. Consider, for example, the SAMEBLOODTYPE rela-
tion on the set of humans, where x SAMEBLOODTYPE y means (of course) that
x and y have the same blood type. It is easy to see that SAMEBLOODTYPE is
indeed an equivalence relation, which sorts people into four “families” (called
equivalence classes) based on their blood types: A, B, AB, or O. More examples
are in the exercises and later in this book.

Proofs 101: Proofs and Proof-Writing
Without proofs, mathematics would not exist. Proof is as fundamental to working
mathematicians as structured experiments are to chemists or biologists.
This is not to say that mathematics is nothing but proof. Calculations, hunches,
See also the coda at the end of
this section.
experiments, and searches for patterns are all indispensable in mathematics, as
they are in the sciences. But mathematical certainty, obtained through rigorous
proof, has no clear analogue in the other sciences, where theories are always open
to revision or falsiﬁcation through experiments. The Pythagorean theorem, by
contrast, has been known to be true for at least 2500 years.
Pythagoras recognized his
proof as a big deal. He
celebrated, legend has it, by
sacriﬁcing 100 oxen.
A ﬁrst course in real analysis is a natural setting for learning about, and for
practicing, mathematical proof. Many concepts and objects of real analysis—
sequences, functions, derivatives, etc.—are familiar, if perhaps only informally,
from calculus courses. The main theorems are mathematically powerful and in-
tuitively accessible. Finding and writing proofs takes care and practice, but the
reward is proportional to the effort.
Mathematical Language and Literature
The beginning of wisdom is to call things by their right names.
The old Chinese sage who supposedly said so may have had other things in mind,
but the advice certainly applies to mathematics. Without clear and unambiguous
language—“right names”—we can’t know exactly what we are talking about, and
therefore we can’t produce really convincing proofs.
The moral is that care with language is just as important in mathematics as it
is in, say, the literary arts. Granted, poets and mathematicians use language very
differently: good poetry may rely on subtle allusions and shaded meanings, but
the best mathematical proofs are always clear, direct, and straightforward, even
when they convey difﬁcult ideas. Both poems and proofs can be praised as ele-
gant, but the judgment depends on different standards. The good news is that we
mathematicians need not aspire to fancy artistry: clarity and directness of expres-
sion are less rareﬁed arts than practical skills, readily acquired and improved on
the job.

1.4. Proofs 101: Proofs and Proof-Writing
33
Following are some samples, phrased as advice, of characteristics of mathe-
matical writing.
Use standard symbols and notations. Using standard notations, of which we’ll
encounter many in this book, helps shorten, unclutter, and clarify mathematical
discussion—but only if notations are used consistently, and with care. For in-
stance, the notations (1, 3), [1, 3], and {1, 3} all have precise but different mean-
ings—one is an open interval, one is a closed interval, and one is a set with just
two members. Straying from these conventions is asking for trouble. It is far from
clear, for instance, what such notations as
[x | x2 > 2]
and
Q | (−
√
2,
√
2)
really mean. By contrast, the expressions
{x | x2 > 2}
and
{x ∈Q | x2 < 2}
are clear and unambiguous.
Or will be, once we have
deﬁned all the ingredients.
Deﬁne everything. Everyone expects theorems, proofs, and calculations in math-
ematical writing. Less expected, but equally important, are formal deﬁnitions.
Words in everyday language have ﬂuid meanings, with nuances that depend on
context. By contrast, words in mathematics have ﬁxed, precise, agreed-upon
meanings. A typical theorem claims that some mathematical object has some
There are some exceptions, but
not many.
mathematical property. Without clear deﬁnitions of the objects and properties
under discussion, proof can’t get started.
EXAMPLE 1.
Prove this claim: The set of rational numbers is closed under
addition.
DISCUSSION.
The mathematical object in question is the set of rational num-
bers. The claimed property, closure under addition, means that the sum of any
two rational numbers is another rational number.
It is easy enough to check that the claim holds for any particular pair of ratio-
nal numbers. For the rationals 3/5 and 2/7, for instance, we use a common de-
nominator to calculate the sum, 31/35, and observe that it is rational, as claimed.
A general proof, however, requires a general deﬁnition, and to this end we deﬁne
a rational number as any ratio of integers a/b, where b ̸= 0. While we’re at it,
let’s also sharpen our description of the closure property: a set S is closed under
addition if r + s is a member of S whenever r and s are members of S. Now we
can restate the claim for our convenience:
If x and y are rational numbers, then so is x + y.
With clear deﬁnitions at hand we’re ready for a concise proof.

34
1. Preliminaries: Numbers, Sets, Proofs, and Bounds
PROOF.
Since x and y are rational, we can write x = a/b and y = c/d, where
a, b, c, and d are integers, and b and d are nonzero. Now we use some fraction
arithmetic:
See the common denominator?
x + y = a
b + c
d = ad
bd + bc
bd = ad + bc
bd
,
a rational number, and the proof is done.
♦
Fair game? Few proofs are completely from scratch. Even the simple proof
above relies on some very basic properties of integers: sums and products of in-
tegers are always integers, and the product of nonzero integers is always nonzero.
(In this book we will freely assume and use such basic properties of integer arith-
metic.) Knowing just which assumptions are safe and which need proof can be
tricky—especially when assumptions are “understood” rather than stated explic-
itly. Learning to sort out such matters is part of the craft of proof.
Write in complete “sentences.” The quotes are there because mathematical sen-
tences in mathematics may include not just ordinary words but also symbols,
equations, inequalities, etc. For instance, it is ﬁne to write
because x > 3 we know x2 > 9 and x3 > 27,
but it’s bad form to write
x > 3, x2 > 9, x3 > 27.
One problem with the latter is the lack of “connective tissue”: a reader can’t tell
whether you’re asserting that something implies something else, or just listing
your favorite inequalities. At any cost, be clear.
Use standard grammatical niceties. These devices—such as punctuation and
capital letters—are used in ordinary English to help the reader see clearly what’s
being said or implied. Consider, for instance, a notice supposedly posted near an
Australian beach:
Crocodiles don’t swim here
Would you swim here or not? Is the sign intended for human or for reptile readers?
In practice, many mathematical sentences convey complex ideas, and so nat-
urally have correspondingly complex structures. It is especially important, there-
fore, to write mathematics as clearly and unambiguously as possible, and to help
the reader decipher your meaning.

1.4. Proofs 101: Proofs and Proof-Writing
35
Write sentences that “scan.” Proofs and solutions must of course be correct,
but they must also be intelligible to the intended reader. An excellent way to
ensure the latter is to read each sentence back to yourself. (Doing this silently
may reduce ridicule from neighbors.) A sentence with proper English grammar
and syntax may be mathematically right or wrong; every mathematician has seen
eloquent proofs that boil down to nonsense. But an ungrammatical sentence is
almost surely wrong or, worse, meaningless to a reader.
Make sense. Ask carefully whether what you write makes sense by the strict
standards of mathematical writing. For instance, the sentence
For all Q, we have x2 ≥0.
is nonsensical (do you see why?) and hence neither true nor false. Your ﬁrst job
is to write sentences that make sense. Your second job is to write sentences that
are true.
Watch word order. Because mathematical language conveys complex thoughts,
word order can be crucial. Consider these two statements:
For every positive ǫ there exists an integer n such that 0 < 1/n < ǫ.
There exists an integer n such that 0 < 1/n < ǫ for every positive ǫ.
The ﬁrst statement is true; it is a version of so-called Archimedean principle for
real numbers. The second statement is meaningful, but false.
We will study the Archimedean
principle in Section 1.6.
Just don’t do “it.” The harmless-looking pronoun “it” commits countless crimes
in mathematics. Here, for example, is a confusing way to describe an important
connection between a function f and its derivative f ′:
It’s maximum or minimum when it’s ﬂat, and that happens when it’s
a zero of its derivative.
That’s way too many pronouns, and who knows what each refers to? Just say no:
A function f may have a maximum or minimum value where the
graph of f is ﬂat. This can occur at a value of x for which f ′(x) = 0.
Make it look easy. A musician planning a recital invests hours of practice and
study, and hits plenty of false notes. The recital itself skips all of this practice and
study, and most of the false notes. In the same way, a ﬁnished mathematical proof
should be the polished result, rather than the basic process, of whatever informal
thinking, experiments, and false starts may have happened along the way. It is
sometimes helpful to hint at the investigative phase of proving a result, but it is
important not to confuse such material with the proof itself. Good proofs are
clear, concise, and couched in standard mathematical language.

36
1. Preliminaries: Numbers, Sets, Proofs, and Bounds
Don’t say too much—or too little. Respect, but don’t overtax, your reader’s intel-
ligence and willingness to work. Ideas in your proof should be clear and accessi-
ble to your reader—someone with your own level of intelligence and knowledge.
Proof Language: A Lexicon
Mathematics, like every discipline, has its own body of technical language. Spe-
cialized vocabulary (“jargon” to its detractors) is sometimes impugned as will-
fully obscure, but exactly the opposite is true: well-chosen technical language is
essential to clear and concise discussion of technical subjects. To get these bene-
ﬁts, of course, we’ll need to know and agree on what technical words mean. The
following little lexicon of important “proof words” begins that project. A general
warning: Some technical words, such as “statement,” have everyday meanings
We could, but won’t, argue over
whether this is for better or for
worse.
somewhat different from their mathematical uses.
Statement. A mathematical statement is a phrase or sentence that can reasonably
be called either true or false. Here are some possibilities:
P : 3 > 5
Q : It is cloudy.
R : It is raining.
S : Life is good.
Statements P, Q, and R are all good examples. Statement P is obviously false,
but mathematically meaningful. Statements Q and R are also ﬁne because, at a
given time and place, each is either clearly true or clearly false. Statement S is
too vague to make our cut, and we’ll leave the fun of debating it to colleagues
across campus.
Complex statements can be built up from simpler ones. Using ingredients
above, for instance, we can create blends like these:
if R then Q : If it is raining, then it is cloudy.
and
Q and not R : It is cloudy but not raining.
Variables. Some statements involve variables: symbols that stand in for unspec-
iﬁed inputs. For such statements we sometimes use names like P(x) to emphasize
the presence of variables. Here are some examples:
P(x) : x2 < 3
Q(y) : y is Fred’s brother.
R(x, y) : x2 + y2 ≥−3
The truth or falsity of such statements usually depends on the values of the vari-
ables involved. Here, for instance, P(7) is false, P(−1) is true, Q(Sue) is proba-
bly false, and Q(Ed) might be true. In this case R(x, y) happens to be true for all

real number inputs x and y.

1.4. Proofs 101: Proofs and Proof-Writing
37
Implication and equivalence. An implication is a statement of the form “if P
then Q”; we often write P
=⇒
Q. This means, of course, that Q is true
whenever P is. With P : x > 3 and Q : x2 > 9, for example,
P =⇒Q
means
x > 3 =⇒x2 > 9
and
Q =⇒P
means
x2 > 9 =⇒x > 3.
Here, clearly, the implication P
=⇒
Q is true: x2 > 9 does indeed hold
whenever x > 3. But the implication Q
=⇒
P is false; try x = −42. An
important moral is that implication is, by default, a one-way street: P =⇒Q is
no guarantee that Q =⇒P.
If it happens that both P

Q and Q
=⇒
P, then P and Q always

algebra, is all about searching

equations.
have the same truth values, and are therefore called equivalent. The statements
P(x) : 2x + 5 = 11 and Q(x) : x = 3 are equivalent, for instance.
And, or. Given statements P and Q, we can form new statements ( P and Q )
and ( P or Q ). (The parentheses aren’t essential, but they help keep the right
things together.) “And” is used mathematically much as it is in everyday speech:
( P and Q ) is true if, but only if, both P and Q are true. “Or” is a little different:
We take ( P or Q ) to be true when either or both of P and Q is true. This conven-
tion, called the inclusive or, differs a bit from the exclusive or, sometimes written
xor, that’s common in everyday life: A child might be offered either candy or ice
cream, but not both.
Negation. The negation of a statement P is a new statement, which we’ll denote
not P,
whose truth value is opposite to that of P. Negating simple statements is easy.
With
R : It is raining,
for instance, we have simply
not R : It is not raining.
Negating complicated statements can take some thought. Consider, for instance,
Goldbach’s conjecture:
This famous unsolved problem
dates back to the 1740s, in
correspondence between
Christian Goldbach and
Leonhard Euler.
G : Every even integer greater than 2 is the sum of two primes.
How would we negate G? We could, admittedly, write something like
It is not the case that G,

38
1. Preliminaries: Numbers, Sets, Proofs, and Bounds
but this is unhelpful. A better approach is to notice that G asserts that every even
integer has a certain property. To negate such a claim is to say that some even
integer does not have this property:
not G: Some even integer greater than 2 is not the sum of two primes.
In other words, to disprove G it is enough to ﬁnd even one big even number that

It’s been tried . . . .
In a similar spirit, De Morgan’s laws tell how to negate statements that involve

section.
and and or:
not ( P and Q )
is equivalent to
( not P ) or ( not Q ) ;
not ( P or Q )
is equivalent to
( not P ) and ( not Q ) .
Notice, especially, that negating and statements produces or statements, and vice
versa.
The meaning of existence. Consider two typical, analysis-style statements about
real numbers:
They happen to be true.
(i) For all x > 3, x2 + 9 > 6x.
(ii) sin x = x/2 for some x ∈[1, 2].
Statement (i) says that a certain property holds for all x ∈(3, ∞), while (ii) says
that a number with a certain property exists in the set [1, 2]. The for all and there
exists constructions are everywhere in mathematics, and have their own symbols:
∀and ∃, respectively. Using these symbols we could rewrite
(i) ∀x ∈(3, ∞), we have x2 + 9 > 6x;
(ii) ∃x ∈[1, 2] such that sin x = x/2;
or even just
(i) ∀x ∈(3, ∞)
( x2 + 9 > 6x );
(ii) ∃x ∈[1, 2]
( sin x = x/2 );
if brevity is really important.
The symbol ∀is known as the universal quantiﬁer; ∀xP(x) means that the
property P(x) holds for every x in some “universe” of discussion. Similarly, ∃is
the existential quantiﬁer; ∃x P(x) means that P(x) holds for at least one x.
The ∀and ∃symbols arise frequently in analysis, often together. For instance,
the statement
∀x ∈R ∃n ∈N such that x < n

1.4. Proofs 101: Proofs and Proof-Writing
39
says—truthfully—that every real number x is smaller than some integer. The
superﬁcially similar-looking statement
∃x ∈R such that ∀n ∈N x < n
says something different—and false.
What does it say to you?
Converse and contrapositive. For some reason, C-words are disproportionately
common among crucial components of concise corroborations. Can this be just
curious coincidence?
An implication P

Q has both a converse and a contrapositive. The

converse of P
=⇒Q is the implication Q =⇒P; the contrapositive is the
implication ( not Q ) =⇒( not P ). If, say, P : x > 3 and Q : x2 > 9, then we
have
P =⇒Q :
x > 3 =⇒x2 > 9
(the original);
Q =⇒P :
x2 > 9 =⇒x > 3
(the converse);
( not Q ) =⇒( not P ) :
x2 ≤9 =⇒x ≤3
(the contrapositive).
As noted earlier, an implication and its converse need not have the same truth
value—and they do not in the present case. An implication and its contrapositive,
on the other hand, always have the same truth value. This matters in mathematical
Common sense bears this out;
we explore it further in the
exercises.
practice, as we will see, because the contrapositive of a statement is sometimes
easier to prove than the original.
Counterexample. For which integer powers p is 2p −1 prime? Back-of-the-
envelope calculations show that this happens if p is 2, 3, 5, or 7; and so, running
out of envelope, we might guess that 2p −1 is prime for all prime powers p. Not
so, alas: 211−1 = 2047, which is not prime. In proof talk, 11 is a counterexample
to our hasty claim.
A counterexample is just what the name implies: a single example that coun-
ters an incorrect general claim. When, as above, the claim asserts that some
property P(x) holds for all x in a given set, a counterexample is simply some
x for which P(x) fails. Mathematicians love counterexamples, perhaps for the
pleasure they can offer in toppling grand theories with humble facts.
Coda: new-age proofs. Proofs are no less important now than they’ve ever been.
But modern viewpoints and, especially, modern technology have made new kinds
of mathematics possible—and sometimes require new kinds of proof. For exam-
ple, the four-color theorem (four colors sufﬁce to color any planar map of “coun-
tries”) was posed in 1852, but proved only in 1976, with aid from a computer to
check hundreds of special cases. Computer-aided proofs are now common, but
they remain controversial.

Types of Proof
Mathematical assertions come in enormous variety. Here is a tiny sample, includ-
ing at least one that is false:
I: If a and b are rational numbers, then so is ab.
II: If a and b are irrational, then so is a + b.
III: If a is irrational, then so is 1/a.
IV:
√
5 is irrational.
V: There are inﬁnitely many prime numbers.
VI: Every even integer from 4 to 100 is the sum of two primes.
VII: Every even integer greater than 2 is the sum of two primes.
VIII: A ﬁnite set with n elements has 2n subsets.
Proofs (and disproofs, when needed) come in similar variety; no simple taxonomy
is possible. Still, a few standard types of argument are so common that they appear
in every mathematician’s toolkit. We name and illustrate several of them in this
section.
Hypotheses and conclusions. A typical mathematical assertion (theorem, claim,
proposition, lemma, corollary, etc.) starts with one or more hypotheses and derives
a conclusion. This structure is often—but not always—explicit in the language it-
self. All of I–III above, for instance, have the general form of an implication: if
[hypothesis], then [conclusion].
For other assertions, including IV–VIII above, the hypotheses are implicit or
understood rather than stated explicitly. If we prefer to state hypotheses more
explicitly, we could rewrite Claim IV, for instance, as

44
1. Preliminaries: Numbers, Sets, Proofs, and Bounds
IV′: If x2 = 2, then x is irrational.
Claim V is harder to restate in if–then form because its hypotheses, such as the
deﬁnition of a prime number, would be tedious to list.
The form of a claim often suggests possible strategies for proving or refuting
it. In the case of an if P then Q claim, for instance, we might attack either the
claim itself or its contrapositive, if not Q then not P. For broad claims like VII
and VIII, each of which covers inﬁnitely many cases, we should expect to work
harder for a proof—or maybe look for even one counterexample as a disproof.
Direct Proof
A direct proof addresses a claim if P then Q in the “obvious” way—it starts with
P and derives Q. We illustrate with Claim I.
EXAMPLE 1.
Prove directly (using basic properties of integer arithmetic) that if
Remember, we’re assuming
integer basics.
a and b are rational numbers, then ab is rational.
SOLUTION.
Because a and b are rational, we can write
a = x
y
and
b = z
w,
where x, y, z, w are all integers, and y ̸= 0 ̸= w. Now we multiply:
ab = x
y × z
w = xz
yw ,
which exhibits ab as the desired ratio of integers, and completes the proof.
Note, by the way, that with a few more words we could also establish that
ab = ba. (We did something similar with sums in Example 2, page 4.)
♦
Indirect Proof
An indirect proof, like a direct one, addresses a claim of the form if P, then Q. But
there is a twist: instead of showing that P implies Q, we prove the contrapositive
(but equivalent!) statement:
if (not Q) then (not P).
An indirect proof may be the simplest choice when either P or Q is awkward, but
(not P) or (not Q) is simpler. We illustrate with Claim III.
EXAMPLE 2.
Prove indirectly: if a is irrational, then 1/a is irrational too.

1.5. Types of Proof
45
SOLUTION.
A direct argument seems awkward here because the hypothesis says
something negative about a. The contrapositive is simple and straightforward: if
1/a is rational, then a is rational.
This is easily shown. If 1/a is rational, then we can write 1/a = x/y for
some (nonzero) integers x and y. But then we have a = y/x, which shows that a
is rational, as desired.
♦
EXAMPLE 3.
Discuss Claim II: If a and b are irrational, then so is a + b.
SOLUTION.
The direct approach looks unpromising, as it did in Example 2. An
indirect proof might seem the next resort. But there is a catch: Claim II is false,
and any counterexample will demolish it. If, say, a =
√
2 and b = −
√
2, then
both a and b are irrational, but a+b = 0, which is rational, so our counterexample
is good.
Our counterexample depends, of course, on the fact that
√
2 is irrational, as
we showed in Theorem 1.2, page 6. Observe, however, that any irrational number
would do in place of
√
2.
♦
Proof by Contradiction
Proofs by contradiction are close kin to indirect proofs. In each case we ﬁrst
assume that the conclusion fails, and then try to deduce a contradiction, either of
the hypothesis or of some other known fact. From the resulting absurdity we infer
that the original conclusion must have been true all along. (The method is also
known as reductio ad absurdum, Latin for “reduction to the absurd.”)
EXAMPLE 4.
Prove Claim IV:
√
5 is irrational.
SOLUTION.
We could tweak the proof of Theorem 1.2, page 6, but for variety
we’ll take an approach based on prime factorization: Every positive integer n has
a unique list of prime factors, some of which may be repeated. (For n = 60 the
list is {2, 2, 3, 5}.) The key insight for our proof is about squaring: each prime
factor of n appears twice as often among the prime factors of n2. (For n2 = 602,
the prime factors are {2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 5, 5}.) In particular, every square integer has
an even number of prime factors. So much said, we’re ready for a crisp proof.
PROOF.
Assume, toward contradiction, that
√
5 is rational. Then we can write
It is traditional, and helpful, to
label contradiction proofs up
front.
√
5 = a/b for some positive integers a and b, and so
√
5 = a
b =⇒5 = a2
b2 =⇒5b2 = a2.

46
1. Preliminaries: Numbers, Sets, Proofs, and Bounds
The last equation provides our contradiction. The right side is a square, and there-
fore has an even number of prime factors. But the left side has an odd number of
prime factors—an even number coming from b2 and one more from the 5. This
absurdity completes the proof.
♦
EXAMPLE 5.
Prove Claim V: There are inﬁnitely many prime numbers.
SOLUTION.
The following beautiful proof is attributed to Euclid, a Greek math-
ematician who worked in Alexandria, Egypt, around 300 BCE. Euclid’s idea can
be phrased as a proof by contradiction.
PROOF.
Assume, toward contradiction, that there are only ﬁnitely many primes,
say p1, p2, p3, . . . , pn. Now consider the number N = p1p2p3 · · · pn + 1. By its
construction, N is not divisible by any of the primes p1, p2, p3, . . . , pn. Hence ei-
N is one more than a multiple of
each pi.
ther N is itself prime or N has at least one prime factor not among p1, p2, p3, . . . , pn.
Either way, the list {p1, p2, p3, . . . , pn} could not have been complete. This con-
tradiction completes the proof.
♦
Brute Force, Cases, Exhaustion, Enumeration
Satisfying as it is to dispatch broad claims with elegant proofs like Euclid’s, some
claims resist such treatment. Sometimes we just argue case-by-case, through
several—or even many—different parts of a general assertion. Such “brute force”
or “exhaustive” methods can be ugly, but sometimes there is no alternative. And
Sometimes there is an
alternative, but it’s hard to ﬁnd.
working through special cases, especially with a computer’s help, can reveal im-
portant patterns.
EXAMPLE 6.
Prove Claim VI: Every even integer from 4 to 100 is the sum of
two primes.
SOLUTION.
Why not just prove Claim VII—every even integer greater than two
is the sum of two primes—and be done with it? That would indeed do the job,
but Claim VII is Goldbach’s conjecture, a famous problem dating to the 1740s.
Considering that Claim VII has already stumped the likes of Euler, we’ll stick
with Claim VI. Handling its 49 special cases is easy, although perhaps tedious:
Try some more!
4 = 2 + 2;
6 = 3 + 3;
8 = 3 + 5;
. . .
98 = 11 + 87;
100 = 7 + 93.

Proof by Induction
Mathematical induction is among every mathematician’s favorite power tools. It
is a simple, structured, and sometimes astonishingly powerful approach to prov-
ing whole families of claims at once. We illustrate the idea ﬁrst informally, by
example.
EXAMPLE 7.
Discuss Claim VIII: A set with n elements has 2n subsets.
SOLUTION.
Claim VIII is really an inﬁnite collection of propositions P(1),
P(2), P(3), . . . , one for each positive integer n. To emphasize this structure,
we can list the propositions individually (we may as well use {1, 2, . . . , n} as a
convenient n-member set):
P(1) : {1} has 2 subsets,
P(2) : {1, 2} has 4 subsets,
. . .
P(42) : {1, 2, . . ., 42} has 242 subsets.
. . .
It is easy in this case to check P(n) for small n, simply by listing. For P(1), the
two subsets are {1} and ∅. For n = 2 the list is
Every set has ∅as a subset.
∅,
{1} ,
{2} ,
{1, 2} .
With n = 3 we get eight subsets, as expected: four from the n = 2 case plus four
See the pattern?
more that include a 3:
∅,
{1} ,
{2} ,
{1, 2} ,
{3} ,
{1, 3} ,
{2, 3} ,
{1, 2, 3}.
The basic ingredients of a proof should now be clear:
(i) a set with one element “obviously” has two subsets; and
(ii) adding a new element to any ﬁnite set doubles the total number of subsets
(every “old” subset generates a new one when we throw in the new element).
Hence sets with 1, 2, 3, 4, . . . elements have 2, 4, 8, 16, . . . subsets, as desired.
♦
Induction, formally. Example 7 illustrates the usual setting for a proof by induc-
tion: a claim that some proposition P(n) holds for every positive integer n. To
prove such a claim by induction takes two (named) steps:
• The base case: Show that P(1) holds.

48
1. Preliminaries: Numbers, Sets, Proofs, and Bounds
• The inductive step: Show that P(k) implies P(k + 1) for every positive
integer k. (Here P(k) is called the inductive hypothesis.)
We illustrate the idea (and the customary shop talk) by formalizing the proof
that, for all n, the set {1, 2, . . . , 42} has 2n subsets.
Proof (of Claim VIII, by induction): The base case n = 1 holds because the set
{1} has only itself and the empty set as subsets.
For the inductive step we assume the inductive hypothesis—that {1, 2, . . ., k}
has 2k subsets—and try to show that {1, 2, . . ., k, k + 1} has 2k+1 subsets. To
this end, note ﬁrst that all 2k subsets of {1, 2, . . . , k} are also subsets of {1, 2, . . . ,
k + 1}. Every remaining subset of {1, 2, . . ., k + 1} contains k + 1, and so can be
formed by adding k +1 to some subset of {1, 2, . . ., k}. Thus {1, 2, . . ., k, k +1}
has 2 × 2k = 2k+1 elements, as desired, and the proof is complete.
□
After one more simple example we’ll draw some conclusions.
EXAMPLE 8.
The identity 1 + 2 + 3 + · · · + n = n(n+1)
2
holds for all positive
integers n.
SOLUTION.
We’ll write P(n) for the identity above; for instance, P(10) says
that 1 + 2 + · · · + 10 = 10 · 11/2 = 55. This is easily checked directly, but
we’d rather prove P(n) for all integers n—just the right job for mathematical
induction.
PROOF BY INDUCTION. The base case, P(1), holds by a trivial calculation—
both sides of the equation are 1.
For the inductive step we assume equation P(k) and derive P(k + 1). A little
algebra is all we need:
adding k + 1 to both sides of
P (k)
by algebra
1 + 2 + · · · + k + (k + 1) = k(k + 1)
2
+ (k + 1)
= (k + 1)
k
2 + 1

= (k + 1)(k + 2)
2
That the ﬁrst and last quantities are equal is just what P(k + 1) asserts. The proof
is complete.
♦
Notes on the method. Mathematical induction is so useful and so ubiquitous in
mathematics that some general themes deserve mention.
• Not cheating: To many conscientious newcomers the inductive step in a
proof feels like cheating—assuming the desired result in order to prove it.
Caution is always wise, but here we’re OK: this part of the proof shows
only that P(k) implies P(k + 1), not that P(k) itself must hold.

1.5. Types of Proof
49
• Dominoes, ladders, lily pads: Choose your favorite metaphor—different
authors use different real-world images to illustrate mathematical induction.
My favorite involves dominoes labeled P(1), P(2), P(3), etc., arranged in
the classical childhood manner (if only the child had inﬁnitely many), so
that every P(n) falls to the right, toppling P(n + 1). The inductive idea is
now a domino theory: if (i) the ﬁrst domino falls; and (ii) each domino fells
its right-hand neighbor, then all the dominoes fall (to the child’s inﬁnite
delight).
Ladders (getting to the ﬁrst rung is the base step) and frogs crossing lily
ponds, pad by pad, lead to similar stories—ﬂesh out your own details.
• Other bases: Not every claim for which induction looks promising starts
with the n = 1 case. For instance, the inequality n2 < 2n fails for some
small integers, but holds whenever n ≥5. An inductive proof is possible,
See the exercises.
with the small twist that the base case now corresponds to n = 5. Claim
VII (every even integer from 4 on is the sum of two primes) is another case
in point: an inductive proof would have base case n = 4. (Whether an
inductive proof can be found is another matter entirely.)
• Why induction works: Inductive proofs themselves may be hard or easy,
but the underlying “domino theory” is simple and plausible. A rigorous
proof that mathematical induction “works” depends on an axiom about the
natural numbers:
If S ⊆N is such that (i) 1 ∈S, and (ii) n + 1 ∈S whenever
n ∈S, then S = N.
We’ll take this basic fact, like others about the integers, as an axiom rather
than something to be proved.

16. A version of Theorem 1.3 says that if n is a positive integer and √n is
rational, then n is a perfect square. Prove this using the following outline,
the idea of prime factorization, and the fact that a positive integer n is a
perfect square if and only if every prime factor of n appears to an even
power. See also Example 4, page 45.
If √n = a/b, where a and b are positive integers, then squaring both sides
gives nb2 = a2. Now factor each side of this equation as a product of
prime numbers. Because the right side is a square, each prime factor on the
right side appears to an even power, and so the same must be true on the
left. Each prime factor of b2 appears to an even power, and so (do you see
why?) each prime factor of n must also appear to an even power.

18. Claim: In any group of n kittens, if one is orange, then all are orange.
That’s absurd, of course, but what’s wrong with the following “proof” by
induction?
Proof: The claim is trivial if n = 1, so the base case holds. To illustrate the
inductive step, assume the claim holds for n = 42. Suppose we’re given a
group of 43 kittens, including at least one—say, Hans—that’s orange. Any
other kitten—say Fritz—can be put in some 42-member group with Hans,
and so Fritz must also be orange by the inductive hypothesis. Thus all 43
kittens are orange, and the proof is done.

Sets 103: Finite and Inﬁnite Sets; Cardinality
How “big” is a set?
Finite sets: few surprises. “Small” sets offer few surprises. It seems clear, for
instance, that S = {a, b}, with two elements, is “smaller” than T = {a, b, c}, with
three. Similarly, N42 = {1, 2, . . ., 42} is obviously “smaller” than FIFTYSTATES
= {Alabama, Alaska, ..., Wisconsin, Wyoming}, even though the two sets have
completely different types of elements, while N26 and ENGLISHALPHABET =
{a, b, c, ..., z } have the same “size.”
“Measuring” sets by counting their elements works well for sets with ﬁnitely
many elements. For such sets, moreover, our intuition is usually reliable. If, say,
a set S has 427 elements and T ⊊S, then T must be “strictly smaller,” with 426
elements or fewer.

1.6. Sets 103: Finite and Inﬁnite Sets; Cardinality
53
Inﬁnite sets: many surprises. Matters are very different for inﬁnite sets. Con-
sider, for instance,
N = {1, 2, 3, 4, . . .
and
E = {2, 4, 6, 8 . . .}.
In one way E seems obviously “smaller”—it omits all of the (inﬁnitely many!) odd
numbers in N. On the other hand, the mapping
1 7→2,
2 7→4,
3 7→6,
. . . ,
n 7→2n,
. . .
is a one-to-one correspondence between N and E, so maybe the two sets have the
“same size.” Similarly, the interval (0, 1) is “shorter” than the interval (0, 2), but
the same mapping, x 7→2x, is a one-to-one correspondence. An important aim
of this section is to develop useful ways of “measuring” inﬁnite sets.
Cardinality: The Idea
So how should we gauge “size” for inﬁnite sets? The answer for present purposes
involves cardinality. We need some clear deﬁnitions, and an excuse to drop all
those lawyerly quotation marks:
Deﬁnition 1.13. Two nonempty sets A and B have the same cardinality if there
is a function f : A →B that is both one-to-one and onto. In this case we write
A ∼B.
Deﬁnition 1.14. A set A is ﬁnite if either A = ∅or A ∼{1, 2, . . ., n} for some
positive integer n. Otherwise, A is inﬁnite.
Informally speaking, two sets have the same cardinality if there is a one-to-
one correspondence between them. We saw this above for N and E and also for
(0, 1) and (0, 2); thus, N ∼E and (0, 1) ∼(0, 2).

Show that (0, 1), (−2, 5), and (0, ∞) all have the same cardinality.
SOLUTION.
It is enough to ﬁnd one-to-one and onto functions f : (0, 1) →
(−2, 5) and g : (0, ∞) →(0, 1). Figure 1.1 hints at two of the many possibilities.
The function f shown is the linear function whose graph passes through
(0, −2) and (1, 5); its formula turns out to be f(x) = 7x −2. The function g
Check this easy calculation.
shown has formula g(x) = x/(1 + x). Graphs of f and g illustrate their one-to-
one and onto properties; honest proofs require the formulas.
To prove, for instance, that g is onto, we have to ﬁnd, for each b ∈(0, 1),
some a ∈(0, ∞) with f(a) = a/(1 + a) = b. A little symbolic work reveals the
recipe:
a
1 + a = b ⇐⇒a = b + ab ⇐⇒a −ab = b ⇐⇒a =
b
1 −b.

The key property should be clear: every z ∈Z appears once and only once in the
second row. The integer z = −42, for instance, corresponds to n = 85.
♦
We can describe this
correspondence a little more
formally; see the exercises.
We’ve just seen that Z can be “paired up with” or “counted off against” N—
even though Z is, in another sense, a bigger set. The following deﬁnition captures
this possibility:
Deﬁnition 1.15. A nonempty set A is countable if either A is ﬁnite or A has the
same cardinality as N. In the latter case, A is countably inﬁnite.
We’ve already seen several examples, including Z, of countably inﬁnite sets.
We’ll show soon, too, that Q is countable. (This is probably surprising—after all,
between any two rationals lie inﬁnitely many others, so Q might seem “larger”
than N.) We might wonder, then, whether any set of numbers, even R itself, is
uncountable, i.e., too big to be in one-to-one correspondence with N. The answer,
as we’ll see, turns out to be yes.
Working with Countable Sets
Finite sets. Finite sets have commonsense properties as far as cardinality is con-
cerned, at least if we assume some basic properties of the integers. Following are
As indeed we do in this book.

some properties we will accept, without formal proofs, as intuitively reasonable.
• The pigeonhole principle: If a (ﬁnite!) hotel has fewer rooms than guests,
We’ll revisit some of these facts
in the exercises.
then at least one room must house at least two guests. This simple but useful
idea is known as the pigeonhole principle (trade rooms for nest boxes and
guests for pigeons). Here is a more formal statement:
Let f : A →B be any function, where A and B are ﬁnite sets,
and B has fewer members than A. Then f is not one-to-one.
• Subsets are ﬁnite, too: If A is a ﬁnite set and B ⊂A, then B is ﬁnite, too.
• New ﬁnite sets from old: If A and B are ﬁnite sets, then A ∪B, A ∩B,
A \ B, and A × B are all ﬁnite.
• Listing and ordering: If A is any ﬁnite set, say with 42 elements, then we
can list the elements: A = {a1, a2, a3, . . . , a42}. If A happens to be a ﬁnite
set of real numbers, we can order our list from smallest to largest:
a1 < a2 < a3 < · · · < a40 < a41 < a42.
Biggest and smallest members. The last property above has a useful form that
deserves special mention:
We discuss this further in
Problem 3, page 50.
Fact 1.16. Every ﬁnite set of real numbers contains a maximum and a minimum
element.
The words “ﬁnite” and “contains” both matter. Some inﬁnite sets, such as Z,
are unbounded, and therefore obviously lack maximum and minimum elements.
The case of a bounded inﬁnite set, such as the open interval (1, 3), is a little
subtler. The problem is that 3 and 1—the obvious candidates for biggest and
smallest—are not members of (1, 3).
The closed interval [1,3] does
contain maximum and minimum
elements.
Countably inﬁnite sets. The set N is the “model” countably inﬁnite set, but many
other sets turn out to have the same cardinality as N. The following proposition
says, in effect, that N is the “smallest” inﬁnite set.
Proposition 1.17. Let S be countably inﬁnite, and let T ⊂S be any nonempty
subset. Then T is either ﬁnite or countably inﬁnite.
Notice the possible surprise: Every inﬁnite subset of N—the odd numbers, the
primes, the powers of 2, the powers of 123456789—is in the sense of cardinality
just as “big” as N itself.
The idea of the proof is to list all the members of T :
t1, t2, t3, . . . , t234, . . . .

56
1. Preliminaries: Numbers, Sets, Proofs, and Bounds
Such a list deﬁnes a nice one-to-one correspondence: 1 7→t1, 2 7→t2, ...,
234 7→t234, and so on. The details follow.
Proof (sketch): By hypothesis, S is in one-to-one correspondence with N, so we
may as well assume right away that S = N. and that T ⊂N. If T is ﬁnite we’re
done already, so we assume T is inﬁnite.
To ﬁnish the proof we need a bijective function f : N →T . To start, let t1
be the smallest element of T (the well-ordering principle guarantees that there
It’s discussed in Section 1.1.
is a smallest element), and set f(1) = t1. Now let t2 be the smallest element
of T \ {t1}, and set f(2) = t2. Continuing, we set f(3) = t3, where t3 is the
smallest element of T \ {t1, t2}, and so on. This process continues indeﬁnitely
because T is inﬁnite, and so does indeed construct a function f : N →T , as
desired. The method of construction assures that the ti are all different from one
another, and so f is one-to-one. The function f is also onto. If, say, t = 42 ∈T ,
then there are at most 41 smaller members of T , so f(k) = 42 must hold for some
k ≤42. A similar argument works for every t ∈T , so f is indeed onto, and the
proof is done.
□
New countable sets from old. Proposition 1.17 gives one way of creating count-
able sets: start with a given countable set and take subsets. Propositions 1.18 and
1.19 describe some other operations that leave countability intact. You may be
surprised ....
Proposition 1.18. Let A and B be countable sets. The Cartesian product
A × B = {(a, b) | a ∈A and b ∈B}
is countable.
Proof: We’ll take both A and B to be countably inﬁnite. In this case, we have
The proof is a little easier if
either or both are ﬁnite.
A = {a1, a2, a3, . . . }
and
B = {b1, b2, b3, . . . } ,
and we can list all members of A × B in a “doubly-inﬁnite matrix”:
The matrix extends inﬁnitely
upward and to the right, like the
ﬁrst quadrant in the xy-plane.

(a1, b1)
(a2, b1)
(a3, b1)

Our last trick is to “count off” all the entries in this gigantic array—without miss-
ing any. One way to do this is to start at lower left and proceed along “northwest-
pointing” diagonals:
Find these entries in the big
matrix.

(a1, b1), (a2, b1), (a1, b2), (a3, b1), (a2, b2), (a1, b3), (a4, b1), . . . .
Do you see the pattern? What matters is that every point (ai, bj) appears once,
but only once, in our list. These facts imply that the function f : N →A × B
given by n 7→nth entry in the list is the desired bijection.
□
Proposition 1.19. Let A1, A2, A3, ..., An, ...be a countable collection of sets,
all of them countable. Then the union
A1 ∪A2 ∪A3 ∪· · · =

[
i=1
Ai
is also countable.
Proof (sketch): Again we assume that each Ai is countably inﬁnite, and list its
elements: Ai = {ai,1, ai,2, ai,3, . . . }. As in the preceding proof, we can list all
elements of all the Ai in a big “matrix”:
. . .

. . .
Just as before, this “matrix” has countably many entries, so we’re almost done.
But a minor subtlety needs attention: the Ai might have some elements in com-
mon, so some elements of the union might appear more than once in the “matrix.”
Luckily, this turns out not to matter, because the distinct elements of the union cor-
respond to some subset of the matrix entries, and we showed in Proposition 1.17
that such subsets are countable.

Corollary 1.20. The set Q of rational numbers is countable.

Uncountable Sets
The preceding propositions imply that many apparently large sets, such as Q, are
in fact no larger in cardinality than N. Might R itself be countable? The answer
is hardly obvious, but it turns out to be no, as the German mathematician Georg
Cantor showed around 1873.
Theorem 1.21. R is uncountable.
We’ll give a version of Cantor’s ingenious proof below, but ﬁrst let’s consider
some striking implications of the theorem:
Corollary 1.22. The interval (0, 1) is uncountable. Every nonempty open interval
(a, b) is uncountable. The irrational numbers are uncountable.
All parts of the corollary say that the sets mentioned are, in cardinality, much
larger than the comparatively “sparse” set Q. Throw a dart at random at the real
line, and you’ll almost certainly hit an irrational.
Proofs of the corollaries. In Example 1 we showed that the intervals (0, 1),
(−2, 5), and (0, ∞) all have the same cardinality. Similar methods show that all
We found explicit bijective
functions between these
intervals.
nonempty open intervals, including (−∞, ∞) (aka R), have the same cardinality.
If the set P of irrationals were countable, then R = P ∪Q would be the union of
two countable sets, and hence countable itself.
Cantor’s “diagonal” proof. Cantor uses the idea of inﬁnite decimal expansion
to show that the interval (0, 1) is uncountable. The proof is by contradiction. If
(0, 1) were countable, we could list all of its elements in an inﬁnite sequence:
x1, x2, x3, . . . . Now each xi has an inﬁnite decimal expansion, of the form
xi = 0.di1 di2 di3 di4 di5 . . . , where the dij are decimal digits, ranging from 0 to
9. Thus, we can write
x1 = 0.d11 d12 d13 d14 d15 . . .
x2 = 0.d21 d22 d23 d24 d25 . . .
x3 = 0.d31 d32 d33 d34 d35 . . .
x4 = 0.d41 d42 d43 d44 d45 . . .
x5 = 0.d51 d52 d53 d54 d55 . . .
. . . = . . .
Here comes the clever part. Cantor uses the diagonal entries
d1,1, d2,2, d3,3, d44, d5,5, . . .

1.6. Sets 103: Finite and Inﬁnite Sets; Cardinality
59
in this array to produce a new number x0 = 0.e1 e2 e3, . . . , which lies in (0, 1)
but all of whose digits differ from the corresponding diagonal entry:
e1 ̸= d11,
e2 ̸= d22,
e3 ̸= d33,
e4 ̸= d44,
. . . .
There are ten choices for each digit, so there are plenty of ways to choose the ei,
and therefore countless possible numbers x0. What matters is that x0 differs from
Pun intended.
x1 in the ﬁrst digit, from x2 in the second digit, from x3 in the third digit, and
so on. Thus x0 is nowhere among the original xi, which contradicts our original
assumption.

f(1/3) = 1/5, f(1/4) = 1/6, f(1/5) = 1/7, etc. For all other x, set
f(x) = x. Think about it, draw a graph, etc.; show that this function does
the job. (We’ll show later, by the way, that no continuous function f can
have the desired properties.)

real number a is called algebraic if p(a) = 0 for some p in Z[x]. If, say,

a particular number is transcendental is usually difﬁcult. But “nearly
every” number is transcendental.)
17. (This extended “problem” could be the basis of a possible project.) Suppose
we have two sets A and B and a one-to-one function f : A →B. Then it’s
reasonable to say that the cardinality of A is not greater than that of B; in
symbols, |A| ≤|B|. (Think of |A| as the “size” of A, not as an absolute
value.) For instance, the one-to-one function f : N →Z given by f(n) = n
suggests, correctly, that |N| ≤|Q|. In words, N is “not greater” than Z.
If there is also a one-to-one function g : B →A, then we can write both
|A| ≤|B| and |B| ≤|A|, and it’s natural to expect that A and B have the
same cardinality—i.e., |A| = |B|, or A ∼B in our preferred notation.
The famous Cantor–Schr¨oder–Bernstein theorem says that this is indeed so.
For any sets A and B and injective functions f : A →B and g : B →A,
we can construct from f and g a bijective function h : A →B.

is obviously bijective, but it’s not constructed from f and g as the
proof idea describes.)
(c) Try to describe the function h using the binary expansion of points in

Numbers 102: Absolute Values
Recall the familiar absolute value function:
|x| =
(
x
if x ≥0;
−x
if x < 0.
In beginning calculus this function is a favorite example of mildly bad behavior—
it’s continuous but has no derivative at x = 0. We’ll use the same example later,
too, but the absolute value also plays a much more basic role in real analysis: it
measures the size, or magnitude, of a quantity. Such questions—how big? how
close?—are crucial in real analysis; so, therefore, are equalities and inequalities
with absolute values.
The absolute value has a nice geometric interpretation:
If x and a are real numbers on a number line, then |x −a| is the
distance between x and a.
This simple idea is surprisingly helpful in making sense of expressions that in-
volve absolute values.
EXAMPLE 1.
Which real numbers x satisfy (i) |x −3| < |x + 2|? What about
(ii) |3x −7| < 5?
SOLUTION.
Both inequalities are slightly awkward algebraically because of the
need to handle positive and negative cases separately. Distance interpretations
can help—a lot. Inequality (i), recast as |x −3| < |x −(−2)|, now says simply
that x is closer to 3 than to −2. This means, in turn, that x lies right of 1/2, the
midpoint of (−2, 3); equivalently, x > 1/2.
Make a sketch.
Inequality (ii) can also be interpreted in distance language, after a little rear-
rangement:
Is all the algebra OK?
|3x −7| < 5 ⇐⇒3
x −7

 < 5 ⇐⇒
x −7

The last version makes the meaning clear: x lies within distance 5/3 from 7/3.
Equivalently, x ∈( 2/3, 4 ).

1.7. Numbers 102: Absolute Values

Absolute Truths
We collect some key properties of absolute values in two theorems. The ﬁrst is
easy; proofs are omitted or left as exercises.
Theorem 1.23. Let x and y denote arbitrary real numbers; assume k > 0.
(a) −|x| ≤x ≤|x|.
(b) |x| = |−x| ;
|x −y| = |y −x|.
(c) |x| < k
⇐⇒
−k < x < k.
(d) |x| > k
⇐⇒
x > k
or
x < −k.
(e) |x · y| = |x| · |y|.
The next theorem is important enough to have its own name.
We explain the name below.
Theorem 1.24 (Triangle inequality). Let x and y be any real numbers. Then
|x + y| ≤|x| + |y| .
The reverse triangle inequality says
|x −y| ≥| |x| −|y| | .
On proofs. The triangle inequality follows from several bits of Theorem 1.23.
From (a), we get
−|x| ≤x ≤|x|
and
−|y| ≤y ≤|y| .
Adding these inequalities gives
−(|x| + |y|) = −|x| −|y| ≤x + y < (|x| + |y|) ,
which is equivalent, by part (c) of Theorem 1.23, to |x + y| ≤|x|+|y|, as desired.
The reverse triangle inequality can be derived from the standard triangle in-
equality; see the exercises.
Variations on a theme. The triangle inequalities are often used in forms slightly
different from the “vanilla” versions in the theorem. Following are some exam-
ples; observe occasional uses of Theorem 1.23:
(i)
|x −y| = |x + (−y)| ≤|x| + |y| ;
(ii)
|x −y| = |x −a + a −y| ≤|x −a| + |a −y| = |x −a| + |y −a| ;
(iii)
|x| −|y| ≤|x −y| ≤|x| + |y| .

64
1. Preliminaries: Numbers, Sets, Proofs, and Bounds
Note especially what (ii) says about distance: the trip from x to y is no longer
than the sum of the distances from x to a and from a to y. This should sound
reasonable—stopping at a enroute shouldn’t shorten the trip from x to y—and it
helps explain the allusion to triangles. Note also (iii), which traps |x −y| between
upper and lower bounds.
In fact, triangle-type inequalities hold in quite general mathematical settings,
some beyond the scope of this book. The basic triangle inequality |x + y| ≤
|x|+|y| holds for complex numbers x and y, for instance, if |x| denotes the length
of x considered as a vector in the plane. Generalizing in another direction, related
facts like
|x1 + x2 + · · · + x100| ≤|x1| + |x2| + · · · + |x100|
and

also hold, and are sometimes called triangle inequalities.
EXAMPLE 2.
Suppose we know that |x −7| < 0.01, |y −7| < 0.02, and
|z −7| > 0.03. What can be said about |x −y|, |x −z|, |xy|, and |x/y|?
SOLUTION.
Triangle inequalities help. To estimate |x −y| we have
|x −y| = |x −7 + 7 −y| ≤|x −7| + |y −7| < 0.01 + 0.02 = 0.03.
For |x −z| there is no upper bound (why?), but the reverse triangle inequality
gives a lower bound:
|x −z| = |(x −7) −(z −7)| ≥|z −7| −|x −7| > 0.03 −0.01 = 0.02.
To estimate |xy| and |x/y| we notice ﬁrst that 6.99 < |x| < 7.01 and 6.98 <
|y| < 7.02. Thus,
These bounds follow from the

Bounds
Theorems and proofs in real analysis often turn on boundedness. We’ll prove
later, for instance, that a continuous function deﬁned on a closed and bounded
interval I = [a, b] is itself bounded on I. To make sense of such a claim re-
quires clear meanings for all its words—which include two somewhat different
instances of the b-word. In this section we start to unpack the idea and language
We’ll also need to deﬁne

of boundedness in several settings.
Deﬁnition 1.25. Let S be a nonempty set of real numbers.
• S is bounded above if there exists a number M with s ≤M for all s ∈S;
here M is an upper bound for S.
• S is bounded below if there exists a number m with s ≥m for all s ∈S;
in this case m is a lower bound for S.
• S is bounded if it is bounded both above and below.
It is clear, for instance, that all three of the sets {1, 2, 3}, [1, 3], and (1, 3) are
bounded above by 3 and below by 1, while the interval (1, ∞) has the same lower
bound, but no upper bound.
Here are some basic notes on the idea and language of boundedness:
• Many choices: Upper and lower bounds are far from unique. For {1, 2, 3},
[1, 3], and (1, 3), for instance, −42 and 42 also work as lower and upper
bounds. These may seem unlikely choices, but in practice we sometimes
care more about the existence (or absence) of bounds than about particular
numerical values.
• Unboundedness: A set is unbounded if it is not bounded. The deﬁnition is
And similarly for sets

unbounded below.

• Boundedness and absolute values: Absolute values—which measure magnitude—
have a natural connection to boundedness. Indeed:
Fact 1.26. Let S ⊂R be a nonempty set. S is bounded if and only if there
exists M > 0 such that |s| ≤M for all s ∈S.
We outline the (straightforward) proof in the exercises.

1. Preliminaries: Numbers, Sets, Proofs, and Bounds
EXAMPLE 1.
Let S and T be nonempty sets of real numbers. Prove some basic
properties of bounded sets:
(a) If S ⊂T and T is bounded, then S is bounded, too.
(b) If S is ﬁnite, then S is bounded.
(c) Let |S| = {|s| | s ∈S}. Then S is bounded if and only if |S| is bounded.
(d) Let S + T = {s + t | s ∈S, t ∈T } and ST = {st | s ∈S, t ∈T }. If S
and T are bounded, then so are S + T and ST .
SOLUTION.
These facts follow directly from the deﬁnition of boundedness.
Claims (a) and (c) are left to the exercises; claim (b) follows from the fact that
every ﬁnite set of numbers has a largest and a smallest member. For (d), note ﬁrst
that, by assumption, there are positive numbers MS and MT with |s| ≤MS and
|t| ≤MT for all s ∈S and t ∈T . Hence we have

|s + t| ≤|s| + |t| ≤MS + MT

Getting Edgy: sup, lub, inf, and glb
The interval I = (−3, 42], like every bounded set, has inﬁnitely many upper and
lower bounds. But there is something obviously special about −3 and 42: the
former is the greatest lower bound and the latter the least upper bound for I. The
following deﬁnition formalizes these properties—and introduces some impressive
Latin synonyms.
Deﬁnition 1.27 (Supremum and inﬁmum). Let S ⊂R be a nonempty set. A num-
ber α is the inﬁmum of S, and we write α = inf(S) (or α = glb(S)) if
(i) α is a lower bound for S; and
(ii) if α′ is any lower bound for S, then α ≥α′.
A number β is the supremum of S, and we write β = sup(S) (or α = lub(S)) if
similar inequalities hold for upper bounds.
This may all seem, for now, like a lot of fuss over not much. Indeed, there is little
interesting to be said about sups and infs of simple sets, like bounded intervals.
We will see soon, however, that the existence of real sups and infs for more general
bounded sets—a property called completeness—is essential in the theory of real
analysis. Here, for the moment, are some simpler notes on the deﬁnition.

1.8. Bounds
69
• Do they exist? If S is unbounded above (or below), then, obviously, S has
no supremum (or inﬁmum). Every bounded set of real numbers, by con-
trast, has a real supremum β and a real inﬁmum α. We discuss this subtle
property and its implications carefully in the next section.
• In or out? The interval I = (−3, 42] contains its supremum but not its
inﬁmum; including or excluding intervals’ endpoints shows that all such
combinations are possible. If a set S contains its supremum β (or inﬁmum
α), then β is the maximum (or minimum) element of S.
• Only one? We said “the” in the preceding deﬁnition, and this is justiﬁed: a
set S has at most one supremum and one inﬁmum. The proof is easy. If β1
and β2 are both suprema for S, then we’d have both β1 ≤β2 and β2 ≤β1,
and so β1 = β2.
Elbow room. Every member of I = (0, 1) is positive, but I pushes right up
against 0 in that members of I can be found within any given distance of 0. By
contrast, I leaves 1.003 a little “elbow room”: no member of I is within 0.003 of
1.003. This distinction, which comes up often in real analysis, can be described
efﬁciently in terms of boundedness.
Deﬁnition 1.28. If a is a number and S ⊂R is a nonempty set, then S is bounded
away from a if, for some δ > 0, |s −a| > δ for all s ∈S.
For I = (0, 1) and a = 1.003, for example, we can use δ = 0.003 (or any smaller
value of δ). Just as clearly, no positive δ works for I = (0, 1) and a = 0.
EXAMPLE 2.
The interval I = (2, 3) is bounded away from π because |π−x| >
0.14 for all x ∈(2, 3). By contrast, 3 /∈I, but I is not bounded away from 3,
since I has members within any small distance δ from 3. The set N is bounded
away from π, but Q is not, since for any δ > 0, no matter how small, there are
rational numbers within δ of π.
♦
EXAMPLE 3.
Let S = {s1, s2, . . . , sn} be a ﬁnite set of real numbers, with
a /∈S. Show that S is bounded away from a.
SOLUTION.
The idea is that, since S is ﬁnite, one of the si must be closest
to a. More precisely, let di = |si −a| be the distance from si to a. Then
D = {d1, d2, . . . , dn} is a ﬁnite set of positive numbers, and so has a minimum
member, say d1. (Every ﬁnite set of numbers has largest and smallest elements;
see Fact 1.16, page 55.) Now it is clear that δ = d1/2 works in Deﬁnition 1.28.
Any positive δ smaller than d1
would work here.

Functions and Bounds
Boundedness for functions is much like that for sets, but the jargon is slightly
different:
Deﬁnition 1.29. Let f be a real-valued function and A a subset of the domain of
f. If f(a) ≤M for all a ∈A, then f is bounded above by M on A. If f(a) ≥m
for all a ∈A, then f is bounded below by m on A. If f is bounded above and
below on A, then f is bounded on A.
EXAMPLE 4.
Let
f(x) = sin x,
g(x) = x3 −5x2 + 7x + 13,
and
h(x) = 1/x.
On which sets A are f, g, and h bounded or unbounded?
SOLUTION.
The function f is least interesting. Because −1 ≤sin(x) ≤1
for all real x, f is bounded (above by 1 and below by −1) on every set A ⊂
R. Sharper bounds can be found on some smaller sets, of course. If, say, A =
[0.36, 1.27] and a ∈A, then 0.353 ≈sin 0.36 ≤sin a ≤sin 1.27 ≈0.955.
sin x increases on this interval.
We know (informally for now) from elementary calculus that g(x)—like every
odd-degree polynomials—“blows up” for large (positive or negative) values of x.
Thus, g is unbounded on unbounded sets like [0, ∞), (−∞, 42), and R itself. On
the other hand, g is bounded on every bounded set A. If, say, A is the interval
[−K, K] and a ∈A, then we have
Thanks, triangle inequality.
|g(a)| =
a3 −5a2 + 7a + 13
 ≤
a3 + 5
a2 + 7 |a| + 13
≤K3 + 5K2 + 7K + 13;
the last quantity is an upper bound. (With more work we might ﬁnd a smaller
upper bound.)
The function h behaves somewhat differently: although bounded on some
inﬁnite intervals, such as [0.00017, ∞) and (−∞, −0.24), h is unbounded on
some ﬁnite intervals, like (0, 1) and (−0.24, 0).

Numbers 103: Completeness
There are many, many rational numbers. Indeed, between any two particular
rationals lie inﬁnitely many others. Between zero and one, for instance, we ﬁnd
1
2, 1
3, 1
4, . . . ,
1
507,
1
508, . . . .
Between any two of these, say 1/507 and 1/508, lie inﬁnitely many others; and
between any two of those .... Who could ask for more?
We could, and we do. There are just not enough rational numbers out there
to permit the sort of analysis—or even algebra—that we want to do. We have
seen, for instance, that there is no rational, exact solution to the simple-looking
equation x2 = 2, even though rational numbers like 1.4142135 (too small) and
1.4142136 (too big) come very, very close.
The real numbers have no such gaps. Somewhere between all those too-small
rational numbers x (with x2 < 2) and the too-big rational numbers y (with y2 >
2) is a real number r that deserves the name
√
2 because r2 = 2 exactly. We will
take this “gap-free” property, known technically as completeness, as an axiom: a
deﬁning property of the real numbers rather than a claim that requires proof.
The Completeness Axiom for R. Every nonempty set of real numbers
that is bounded above has a supremum. In symbols: If S ⊂R,
S ̸= ∅, and S is bounded above, then there is a real number β such
that β = sup(S).
Like other succinct mathematical statements, this one can use some unpacking:

1.9. Numbers 103: Completeness
75
• What about infs? For brevity, the completeness axiom mentions only sups.
But the story is similar for infs: Every nonempty set that is bounded below
has an inﬁmum. The inf version, moreover, follows easily from the sup
version.
See the exercises.
• The real advantage: The completeness axiom guarantees that every bounded
set of rationals has a supremum—which may or may not be a rational num-
Rational numbers are also real.
ber. By contrast, the supremum of a bounded set of reals must be real. In
this sense R is complete, while Q is incomplete.
• In or out? We know already that the sup and the inf of a given set may
or may not lie within the set. It is pretty obvious, for instance, that the
half-closed interval (1, 2] contains its supremum but not its inﬁmum. For
more complicated sets, things may be less clear. Consider, for example,
the set S =

r ∈Q | r2 ≤152399024
	
. A little thought shows that S
is bounded, so the completeness axiom guarantees that a sup and an inf
exist. We might also guess (correctly!) that sup(S) =
√
152399024 and
inf(S) = −
√
152399024, but do these numbers lie inside or outside S?
This is far from clear at a glance—and the completeness axiom is no help
The question boils down to
whether 152399024 is a perfect
square. It isn’t . . . quite.
at all. To decide, we’d need to discover whether
√
152399024 is rational,
and this takes a little effort.
Using Completeness: Order Properties of R
The following theorem collects some useful properties of the real numbers as an
ordered set. Most are familiar; the surprise, if any, is the role that completeness
plays in their proofs.
Theorem 1.30 (Order properties of numbers).
• N is unbounded: Given any real number M, there exists a positive integer
n with n > M.
• Squeezing in: For every positive number ǫ, no matter how small, there ex-
ists a positive integer n such that 0 < 1
n < ǫ.
• The Archimedean principle: Given real numbers a and b with 0 < a < b,
there exists a positive integer n with na > b.
More on the Archimedean principle. The Archimedean principle can be thought
of geometrically. The challenging case occurs when a is small and b is large, as
suggested in Figure 1.2.
The principle says that steps of size a, no matter how short, will eventually
complete a trip of length b, no matter how long. As Archimedes (around 250 BCE)
might have put it, a positive number a, no matter how small, is not “inﬁnitesimal”:
successive multiples a, 2a, 3a, . . . will eventually exceed any proposed bound b.

Figure 1.2. Archimedes in motion: a long trip in short steps.
Proof: To show that N is unbounded, assume toward contradiction that no integer
n exceeds M. Then M is an upper bound for N, and so, by the completeness
axiom, N must have a real supremum, say β. Because β is the least upper bound,
β −1 is not an upper bound, and so n0 > β −1 must hold for some positive
integer n0. But then n0 + 1 > β, which contradicts our assumption that no
integer exceeds β. Thus N is unbounded, as claimed.
The remaining claims turn out to be lightly disguised versions of the result
just shown. For the Archimedean principle, note that, for positive a and b,
na > b
⇐⇒
n > b
a.
But we’ve just shown that N is unbounded, so the right-hand inequality must hold
for sufﬁciently large n.
Proof of the “squeezing-in” principle is left as an exercise.

Nested Intervals
A collection of intervals I1, I2, I3, . . . is called nested if
I1 ⊇I2 ⊇I3 ⊇I4 ⊇. . . .
Here is a nested collection of open intervals:
(0, 1) ⊇(0, 1/2) ⊇(0, 1/3) ⊇(0, 1/4) ⊇. . . .
Observe that, although each interval In contains inﬁnitely many points, the inter-
section of the full collection is empty.
The story is different for closed intervals. The nested collection
[0, 1] ⊇[0, 1/2] ⊇[0, 1/3] ⊇[0, 1/4] ⊇. . .
has exactly one point of intersection—the number 0. The following theorem de-
scribes the situation in general; completeness is the key.
Theorem 1.31 (The nested intervals theorem). Consider a nested inﬁnite col-
lection

of closed and bounded intervals. The intersection
I1 ∩I2 ∩I3 ∩I4 ∩. . .
contains at least one point. If the intervals’ lengths shrink to zero, then the inter-
section is a single point.
Proof (sketch): We sketch the main idea, leaving some details to exercises. If we
write In = [an, bn] for all positive integers n, then the nesting condition means
a1 ≤a2 ≤a3 ≤· · · ≤b3 ≤b2 ≤b1.
In particular, the “left endpoint set” A = {a1, a2, a3, . . . } is bounded above. By
completeness, we can set α = sup A, and it is readily shown that α lies in all the
In. A similar argument shows that β = inf{b1, b2, b3, . . . } lies in all the In. If
the lengths of the In shrink to zero, then α = β.
□
Rationals and Irrationals: Tightly Packed
We mentioned casually at the beginning of this section that between any two given
rational numbers lie inﬁnitely many other rational numbers. A little more is true,
and now we can prove it.
Theorem 1.32. Let x and y be any two real numbers, with x < y.
(a) The interval (x, y) contains at least one rational and one irrational number.
(b) The interval (x, y) contains inﬁnitely many rationals and inﬁnitely many
irrationals.
Proof: Claim (b) looks much stronger than (a), but showing that (a) implies (b)
is surprisingly easy. Let’s suppose, toward contradiction, that (a) holds but (x, y)
contains only ﬁnitely many rationals r1, r2, . . . , rn. Then one of these, say rn,
is largest. But then the interval (rn, y) must contain no rationals, which contra-
Recall: Every nonempty ﬁnite
set of reals has a maximum
element.
dicts (a). Exactly the same proof applies to irrational numbers, so we conclude
that (a) implies (b).
To prove (a) we’ll use Theorem 1.30. For convenience, we’ll handle here only
the special case 0 ≤x < y, and mop up remaining cases as exercises. If we
set ǫ = y −x, then the squeezing-in part of Theorem 1.30 says that for some
integer n the rational number r = 1/n lies in the interval (0, ǫ)—as does the
irrational number p = r/
√
2.
Note that 0 < p < r < y – x.
To ﬁnish the proof, we show that at least one of r, 2r, 3r, 4r, . . . (all are
rational) and at least one of p, 2p, 3p, 4p, . . . (all are irrational) lie inside (x, y).
This is intuitively reasonable—for both sequences, the “jumps” are too small to
miss (x, y) entirely. To put it formally, say for p, 2p, 3p, 4p, . . . , consider the

78

set S = {np | n ∈N and np < y}. By the Archimedean principle, np > y
for sufﬁciently large n, which amounts to saying that S is ﬁnite. Hence S has a
largest element, say n0p, with n0p < y but (n0 + 1)p ≥y. But now
(n0 + 1)p ≥y
=⇒
n0p ≥y −p > y −(y −x) = x,
and so x < n0p < y, as desired. The proof that x < m0r < y for some positive
integer m0 is almost identical.

where each di is a decimal digit. Use these digits to construct a bounded

Sequences and Convergence
An inﬁnite sequence is a list a1, a2, a3, . . . of real numbers, indexed by the posi-
tive integers. Here are some examples:
a1, a2, a3, a4, . . . , a42, . . .
=
1, 1
2, 1
3, 1
4, . . . ,
1
100, . . . ;
b1, b2, b3, b4, . . . , b42, . . .

1, −1, 1, −1, . . . , −1, . . . ;
c1, c2, c3, c4 . . . , c42, . . .
=
sin 1, sin 2, sin 3, sin 4, . . . , sin 42, . . . ;
f1, f2, f3, f4, . . . , f42, . . .

Observe:
• Words and notations: A particular entry an in a sequence is called its nth
term. Notice that the subscript, or index variable name, is arbitrary: an and
ai and even ax can all mean the same thing. For the entire sequence we

a “continuous” variable.
write {an}∞
n=1, or just {an}; the braces emphasize the fact that a sequence
is a set.
• Sequences as functions: A sequence {an} is, among other things, a real-
valued function, with domain N. Writing, say, a(42) rather than a42 can
help emphasize this viewpoint.
• Sequence rules: Like other functions, sequences are often deﬁned by sym-
bolic rules. Among the sequences above, for example, we have the rules
an = 1/n,
bn = (−1)n+1,
and
cn = sin n.
Not every sequence (or function, for that matter) has such a simple recipe.
The sequence {fn} above is the famous Fibonacci sequence, which is de-
ﬁned recursively:
f1 = 1;
f2 = 1;
fn = fn−2 + fn−1
if n ≥3.
The sequence {gn} can be built (can you guess how?) from {fn}.
83

2. Sequences and Series
• Converge or diverge? It is clear at a glance that {an} converges to the limit
zero. Sequences {bn} and {fn} presumably diverge, because the former
never settles on any single limit, while the latter blows up in size. Precise
deﬁnitions, which we’ll give in a moment, will formalize these intuitions
and lead to rigorous proofs. Whether {cn} and {gn} converge or diverge
Calculating some decimal
values might help us guess.
may be harder to guess.
Convergence and Divergence
Informally speaking, a sequence {an} converges to a limit, say 3, if the numbers
an “approach” 3 as n “tends to inﬁnity.” Such an intuitive view can be useful,
but it’s too vague to permit careful proofs. The words in quotes are especially
important—but especially unclear as written. We need a formal deﬁnition:
Deﬁnition 2.1. Let {an} be a sequence and L a number. We say {an} converges
to L if for every ǫ > 0 there exists a number N so that
|an −L| < ǫ
whenever n > N.
In this case L is the limit, and we write limn→∞an = L, or just an →L. If no
such L exists, we say {an} diverges.
The deﬁnition is subtle, and deserves some unpacking:
• Greek letters: The Greek letter ǫ (lower-case epsilon) is traditionally used
in mathematics to denote small positive quantities. Later we’ll use δ (lower-
case delta), as well, for similar purposes.
• ǫ measures “nearness”: The inequality |an −L| < ǫ means that an is
within ǫ of L. If ǫ is very small then an is very near to L.
• N measures “waiting time”: The deﬁnition requires that every term an with
n > N be within ǫ of L. The number N says how long we need to wait
for this happy outcome. If, say, ǫ = 0.001 and N = 234.7, then we’re
guaranteed that a235, a236, a237, and all following terms are within 0.001
of the limit.
• Symbolic shorthand: The heart of the deﬁnition can be written compactly
in symbols:
∀ǫ > 0
∃N ∈N
such that
n > N =⇒|an −L| < ǫ
Using the deﬁnition: notes on proofs. Our concise deﬁnition can lead, ideally,
to equally concise proofs. But such polished products can seem both impressive
and mysterious, like a Ferrari with the hood up. To raise the hood a bit, we’ll
often precede formal proofs with informal discussion—but keep the two separate.
We start with some positive and negative examples.

Pre-proof discussion. The fact that an →0 seems obvious; how could it be oth-

and we’re ready for a slick and seamless proof.

EXAMPLE 2.
Let xn = (3n + 2)/(n + 5). Show that {xn} converges.
Discussion.
First we need a candidate for L; a little thought or plugging in large
numbers suggests L = 3. As in Example 1, we manipulate the desired inequality
in search of a suitable N. This time we need a little more algebra:
Again the annoying absolute
value eventually vanishes.

EXAMPLE 3.
Show that the oscillating sequence b1, b2, b3, b4, · · · = 1, −1, 1,
−1, . . . diverges.
Discussion.
As in Example 1 the claim is hardly surprising. The new twist is to
prove a negative: No number L works in the deﬁnition. One approach involves
the fact that no single number L can be close (within 0.01, say) to both 1 and −1.
Proof.
Assume, toward contradiction, that {bn} converges to any number L.
Let ǫ = 0.01 and choose N as in the deﬁnition. If n0 is any odd integer with
n0 > N, then we have
|bn0 −L| = |1 −L| < 0.01 =⇒L ∈(0.99, 1.01).
Similarly, if n1 is an even integer with n1 > N, then
|bn1 −L| = |−1 −L| < 0.01 =⇒L ∈(−1.01, −0.99).
Thus L lies in two disjoint intervals, which is absurd.
♦
Visualizing Sequences and Convergence
Like ordinary graphs in a calculus course, geometric views of sequences and con-
vergence help us visualize their behavior—good and bad. Different views are
possible.
Points on a line. Selected terms of a sequence {an} can be plotted as labeled
points on a line. The resulting diagrams are crude and limited, but they can illumi-
nate properties of sequences and convergence. Figure 2.1, for example, illustrates
the ǫ–N condition for convergence: All terms an with n > N lie within ǫ of L.
Points in a plane. Terms of {an} can also be viewed as points (n, an) on the
graph of the function a : N →R. Figure 2.2 offers glimpses of two sequences,
{1/n} and {sin n}. One converges to zero (as we’ve proved!); the other looks un-
likely to convergeto anything. Such graphs can reveal a lot, but never everything—
Proving this is another matter.

Sequence graphs can also show how ǫ and N interact. The idea is to express
the key deﬁnition in graphical language: for any ǫ > 0, no matter how small,
there is some N on the (horizontal) n-axis so that all graph points to the right of
N lie inside an “ǫ-band” around the horizontal line y = L, as Figure 2.3 suggests.
Properties of Sequences
Sequences, like other real-valued functions, may or may not have various behav-
ioral properties. Here are some typical deﬁnitions:
Deﬁnition 2.2. Let {an} be a sequence of real numbers.
• Boundedness: {an} is bounded above if there exists M such that an ≤M
for all n ∈N; it is bounded below if there exists m such that an ≥m for
all n.
• Monotonicity: {an} is increasing if an ≤an+1 for all n ∈N; {an} is

88
2. Sequences and Series
decreasing if an ≥an+1 for all n ∈N. {an} is monotone if it is either
increasing or decreasing.
• Strictness: {an} is strictly increasing if an < an+1 for all n ∈N. {an} is
strictly decreasing if an > an+1 for all n ∈N.
The sequence {1/n}, for example, is strictly decreasing and bounded (above and
below), while the Fibonacci sequence is increasing and unbounded (above).
The following two theorems link these properties to convergence and diver-
gence. Neither statement is surprising, but the formal proofs are nice exercises—
and left as exercises—in using the deﬁnition. Some pre-proof discussion follows
each result.
Theorem 2.3. If a sequence {an} is (i) monotone, and (ii) bounded, then {an}
converges.
Almost-a-proof discussion. Let’s assume that {an} is increasing; a similar proof
works for the decreasing case. Since the set {an} is bounded, it has a supremum,
by the completeness axiom. Let’s call the supremum L, and show that L is the
Nice to see it turn up again.
limit, too. To this end, let ǫ > 0 be given; we’re done if we ﬁnd any N that
“works” for this ǫ.
Here’s the trick. Because L is the supremum, L −ǫ is not an upper bound
for {an}, and so there must be some term, aN, with L −ǫ < aN. The punchline
is that this N “works”: If n > N, then an ≥aN because {an} is increasing;
therefore, we have
L −ǫ < aN ≤an ≤L < L + ǫ,
as desired.
Theorem 2.4. If a sequence {an} converges, then {an} is bounded both above
and below.
Discussion.
Suppose {an} converges to L. If we set ǫ = 1, then—by the
deﬁnition—there is some N such that L −1 < an < L + 1 for all n > N.
We could play the same game
with smaller ǫ, but there’s no
need.
In particular, the “upper tail” {aN+1, aN+2, aN+3, . . . } is bounded (above by
L + 1 and below by L −1). Now the “front end” {a1, a2, . . . , aN} is a ﬁnite
set, and hence also bounded. Thus the entire sequence {an} is the union of two
bounded sets, and is therefore bounded.
Beyond the basics: inequalities. The sequences in Examples 1 and 2 led to
relatively simple inequalities and, in turn, to relatively simple recipes for N in
terms of ǫ. Sequences with more complicated deﬁnitions may require more clev-

the work. Following are two examples.

Show that the sequence {zn} with
zn =

converges to zero.
Discussion.
But for the annoying denominator {zn} resembles {1/n}, which
converges to zero (see Example 1). To show that zn →0, too, for given ǫ > 0,
we need to ﬁnd N for which

27. In this section we mentioned the Fibonacci sequence {fn}, deﬁned by f1 =
f2 = 1 and fn = fn−2+fn−1 for n ≥3. It is clear that {fn} is unbounded,
but how fast does {fn} increase? We explore this question in this problem.
Let’s show ﬁrst, by induction, that fn < 2n for n ≥1. Because the Fi-
bonacci sequence is deﬁned using two previous terms, it is convenient to
take both n = 1 and n = 2 as base cases.
The claim is obvious for n = 1 and n = 2. For the inductive step, we
suppose the claim holds for all n up through k (with k ≥2) and show, as
follows, that it holds for n = k + 1:
fk+1 = fk−1 + fk < 2k−1 + 2k < 2k + 2k = 2k+1,
as desired.
(a) Show by induction that fn > 1.5n for all n ≥11. (It is easy to check
with technology that the inequality is false for smaller n.)
(b) It can also be shown by induction (as in the preceding problem) that
fn > 1.6n for all “sufﬁciently large” n. Use technology to decide
which n have this property.

(c) Observe (with technology) that {gn} appears to hop back and forth
across the number φ = (1+
√
5)/2 ≈1.618 (this is the famous golden
ratio). Prove this by showing (algebraically; no induction needed) that
(i) if gn > φ then gn+1 < φ; and (ii) if gn < φ then gn+1 > φ.

Working with Sequences
New Sequences from Old
As with other functions, “old” sequences can be combined in various ways to
form “new” ones. Naturally enough, convergence and divergence properties of a
built-up sequence reﬂect properties of the building blocks.
Theorem 2.5 (Algebra with convergent sequences). Let {an} and {bn} be con-
vergent sequences. Let a, b, and c be real numbers, with an →a and bn →b.
• Sums and differences: The sequence {an ± bn} converges to a ± b.
• Constant multiples: The sequence {can} converges to ca.
• Products: The sequence {an · bn} converges to a · b.
• Quotients: If b ̸= 0 and bn ̸= 0 for all n, then the sequence {an/bn}
converges to a/b.
Let’s use the theorem ﬁrst; proofs come later.
EXAMPLE 1.
In Example 2, page 85, we used the deﬁnition of convergence to
show that
n
3n+2
n+5
o
converges to three. Could Theorem 2.5 have helped?
SOLUTION.
Yes. Basic algebra gives
3n + 2
n + 5 = 3 + 2/n
1 + 5/n = 3 · 1 + 2 · 1
n
1 + 5 · 1
n
,
which shows the original sequence as a combination of the much simpler se-
quences {1}, and {1/n}, which converge to 1 and 0, respectively. Now Theo-
rem 2.5 implies that
3 · 1 + 2 · 1
n
1 + 5 · 1
n
→3 · 1 + 2 · 0
1 + 5 · 0

as expected.
We just assumed, of course, that {1} and {1/n} do indeed converge to one
and zero. These claims need proof, too, but the proofs are easy—and need to be
done just once.
♦
EXAMPLE 2.
Let {an} and {bn} be divergent sequences, and let {cn} be a
convergent sequence. Can the sum {an + bn} converge? Can it diverge? What
about {an + cn}?
SOLUTION.
Theorem 2.5 says nothing about sums of divergent sequences. But
easy examples show that {an} and {bn} can either converge or diverge. With
an = n and bn = π −n, for example, we get an + bn = π for all n, so {an + bn}
converges.
Find your own example where
{an + bn} diverges.
Theorem 2.5 does help with {an + cn}; let’s call it {dn} for the moment. If
{dn} were convergent, then the difference {dn −cn} = {an} would converge,
too, contradicting our assumption. Thus, {an + cn} diverges.

EXAMPLE 3.
A sequence {sn} is deﬁned recursively by
s1 = 2.0
and
sn = sn−1

sn−1
for
n > 1.
The ﬁrst few terms (rounded) are 2.0, 1.5, 1.41667, 1.41422, 1.41421, .... What
is happening here? Why?
SOLUTION.
The numbers suggest convergence to
√
2, but can we be certain?
The answer is yes—if we invoke appropriate theorems. The deﬁnition implies
that sn > 0 for all n. It’s also true (and proved in exercises) that {sn} is decreas-
ing, and so Theorem 2.3, page 88, implies that {sn} converges to some limit L.
Invoking different parts of Theorem 2.5 lets us ﬁnd L. Because sn →L, we know
sn = sn−1
2
+

sn−1
=⇒L = L
2 + 1
L,
which implies, in turn, that L2 = 2, or L =

2.
♦
L = −
√
2 is clearly impossible
since all sn are positive.
Proving Theorem 2.5. Theorem 2.5 contains few surprises. Concerning sums,
for instance, it should seem reasonable that if an ≈a and bn ≈b for large n, then
also an + bn ≈a + b for large n. Rigorous proofs are another matter, of course.
The deﬁnition of convergence is all about inequalities; therefore, so are con-
vergence proofs. Here, we’ll need to show that inequalities like
|(an + bn) −(a + b)| < ǫ,
|anbn −(a ± b)| < ǫ,
and

2. Sequences and Series
hold for large n. What we have to work with are
|an −a| < ǫ
and
|bn −b| < ǫ,
which do hold for large n, by hypothesis. The trick is to parlay these simpler
inequalities into proofs of their more complicated cousins. The triangle inequality
will come in very handy; watch for it in the following proof.
Watch for a technical trick, too.
Proof (for sums): Let ǫ > 0; we need to choose N so that |(an+bn) −(a+b)| <
ǫ whenever n > N. Set ǫ′ = ǫ/2; note ǫ′ > 0. Because an →a, there is a number
N1 that “works” for ǫ′:
n > N1 =⇒|an −a| < ǫ′.
Similarly, there exists N2 such that
n > N2 =⇒|bn −b| < ǫ′.
Now let N be the larger of N1 and N2. If n > N, then both n > N1 and n > N2,
and so
|(an + bn) −(a + b)| = |(an −a) + (bn −b)|
≤|an −a| + |bn −b| < ǫ′ + ǫ′ = ǫ,
where we used the triangle inequality at the line break. This shows that N works
in the desired sense, and completes the proof.
□
Working with products. To prove our claim about products we will use the cor-
responding properties for sums (just proved) and for constant multiples (left as an
exercise). The proof starts with a standard analyst’s trick: subtracting and adding
We’ll see this again.
the same quantity:
anbn = anbn −anb + anb = an(bn −b) + anb.
The result for constant multiples shows that anb →ab; we’ll be done if we can
also show that an(bn −b) →0. The key insight, as we will see in the formal
proof, is that the {an} are bounded.
Proof (for products): First we write anbn = an(bn −b) + anb. By the result for
sums, it’s enough to show that
anb →ab
and
an(bn −b) →0.
That anb →ab follows from the property of constant multiples that we assumed.
And left as an exercise.
To show an(bn −b) →0, observe ﬁrst that the convergent sequence {an} is
bounded (Theorem 2.4, page 88, says so); in other words, there exists M > 0

2.2. Working with Sequences
99
with |an| ≤M for all n. Now let ǫ > 0 be given; note that ǫ/M > 0, too. Since
bn →b, there exists N such that |bn −b| < ǫ/M when n > N. This N works
for {an(bn −b)}, because if n > N, then
|an(bn −b) −0| = |an| |bn −b| ≤M |bn −b| < M ǫ
M = ǫ,
as desired.
□
Quotients. To show an/bn →a/b requires—even to make sense—that b ̸= 0
and bn ̸= 0 for all n. If we assume this, it is enough to show that 1/bn →1/b, for
then the result for products gives an · 1/bn →a · 1/b, as desired. We will outline
a proof that 1/bn →1/b in the exercises.
Squeezing. The algebraic methods of Theorem 2.5 don’t immediately help with
the sequence {sin n/n}, which has a trigonometric ingredient. Still, we expect
the sequence to converge to zero because the numerator remains tamely bounded,
while the denominator “blows up.” More precisely, we know
−1
n ≤sin n
n
≤1
n
for all n. Both the left- and right-hand sequences converge to zero, and we expect
them to “squeeze” the middle sequence to the same limit. That intuition is correct:
Theorem 2.6 (The squeeze principle). Let {an}, {bn}, and {cn} be sequences
such that an ≤bn ≤cn for all n. If an →L and cn →L, then bn →L, too.
Proof: For given ǫ > 0, we need to ﬁnd N such that n > N implies |bn −L| < ǫ,
or, equivalently, L −ǫ < bn < L + ǫ.
Because an →L we can choose N1 so
n > N1 =⇒L −ǫ < an < L + ǫ.
Similarly, there is N2 so
n > N2 =⇒L −ǫ < cn < L + ǫ.
Now let N = max{N1, N2}. This N works for {bn}, since if n > N then
L −ǫ < an ≤bn ≤cn < L + ǫ,
as desired.
□
Theorem 2.6 suggests additional “squeeze-like” properties of sequences.
Proposition 2.7 (More squeezing). Let {an} and {bn} be sequences and L a
number.

100
2. Sequences and Series
(a) an →0 ⇐⇒|an| →0
(b) If an →L, then |an| →|L|.
(c) If |an| →0 and {bn} is bounded, then anbn →0.
Proof: Claim (a), left as an exercise, is a basic application of the deﬁnition.
Claims (b) and (c) follow from (a) by judicious squeezing. For (b), notice ﬁrst
that an −L →0 by hypothesis, and so |an −L| →0, according to (a). The
reverse triangle inequality now gives our squeezing inequality:
Here one sequence is constant.
0 ≤| |an| −|L| | ≤|an −L|
Since the right-hand sequence tends to zero, so must the middle one, as we aimed
to show.
For (c), we ﬁrst use boundedness of {bn} to choose B > 0 with |bn| ≤B for
all n. This leads to another squeezing inequality:
0 ≤|anbn| ≤B |an| .
Again, the left- and right-hand sequences tend to zero (the constant multiple B
does no harm) and therefore squeeze the middle sequence to the same limit.
□
Sequences to order. Sequences with speciﬁed properties can often be made to
order, as the following two (similar) samples suggest. We’ll call them lemmas
because the sequences involved here are often used in proofs of other results.
(Lemmas are junior-grade theorems, normally used to prove something else.)
The German Hilfsatz, or
“helping sentence,” is more
descriptive.
Lemma 2.8. Let L be any number. There exist sequences {rn} and {pn}, both
converging to L, with rn ∈Q and pn /∈Q for all n. If desired, {rn} and {pn}
and can be chosen to be either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing.
Proof: If L is rational, then the sequences deﬁned by
rn = L + 1

and
pn = L +

are strictly decreasing and converge to L. Other cases are similar, and left as
exercises.

β = sup(C). There exist sequences {an} and {bn} contained in C with an →α
and bn →β.
Proof: Let’s ﬁnd {bn}. For each n ∈N we know β −1/n is not an upper bound
The {an} case is similar.

Divergence to Inﬁnity
Sequences like {n} and {−n3} clearly have no ﬁnite limit, but they misbehave
less seriously than, say, the zig-zag sequence {1, −2, 3, −4, . . .}. The following
deﬁnition formalizes these ideas.
Deﬁnition 2.10. A sequence {xn} diverges to inﬁnity if for every M > 0 there
exists a number N such that
xn > M
whenever n > N.
In this case, we write limn→∞xn = ∞, or just xn →∞.
Observe:
• Divergence to −∞: A similar deﬁnition holds for divergence to −∞: For
given M > 0 there must exist N with xn < −M whenever n > N.
• Big M, small ǫ: For ordinary convergence we focus mainly on small posi-
tive values of ǫ; here the challenging values of M are large.
• Convergence or divergence? Some authors refer to convergence to ∞; we
prefer to reserve “convergence” for ﬁnite limits.
• Unboundedness and divergence to inﬁnity: An unbounded sequence need
not diverge to ±∞, as {1, −2, 3, −4, . . .} illustrates. An unbounded mono-
tone sequence, on the other hand, must diverge to ±∞; see Example 5.
• Zero or inﬁnity? A sequence {xn} of positive terms diverges to ∞if and
only if {1/xn} converges to 0. (Proofs follow directly from the deﬁnitions;
see the exercises.) A similar result holds for negative sequences.
Swept away: a comparison test. Here’s an unsurprising claim about comparing
one sequence to another:
If an ≤bn for all n and an →∞, then bn →∞, too.
(A similar claim holds for sequences tending to −∞.) Proofs follow easily from
the deﬁnitions; see the exercises. The surprise is how powerful this straightfor-
ward idea can be in applications.

2. Sequences and Series
SOLUTION.
In a word, yes. Observe ﬁrst that sn ≥hn for all n, so it is enough
to show that hn →∞. One approach is to recall from elementary calculus that
If using unproved calculus
results seems like cheating, see
the exercises for another
approach.
hn = 1

x = ln n.
It is well known that ln n →∞, and so both {sn} and {hn}, being larger, are
also “swept away” to ∞.

EXAMPLE 5.
Prove concisely that if {xn} is unbounded and increasing, then
xn →∞.
SOLUTION.
Let M > 0 be given. Since {xn} is unbounded, there exists N
with xN > M. This N works in the deﬁnition: if n > N then, since {xn} is
increasing, we have xn ≥xN > M, as desired.

(c) Show in two steps that {1/|bnb|} is bounded.
(i) Show that the set {bn} is bounded away from zero—i.e., there is
some δ > 0 such that |bn| ≥δ for all n. (Hints: Let ǫ = |b|/2 >
0. Since bn →b there is an integer N such that |bn−b| < ǫ when
n > N; note that |bn| > |b|/2 for all such n. The remaining set
{|b1|, |b2|, . . . , |bN|} is a ﬁnite set of positive numbers, and so
has a positive minimum. Use these facts to ﬁnd a suitable value
of δ.)
(ii) Show that 1/|bnb| ≤1/(δ|b|) for all n .

Subsequences
Basic Ideas
Any given sequence x1, x2, x3, x4, . . . has many, many subsequences. Here are
three examples:
x1, x3, x5, x7, . . .
x1, x4, x9, x16, . . .
x123, x124, x125, . . .
Subsequences are formed by choosing—in order—any inﬁnite subset of the orig-
inal sequence {xn}. The last example above could be called an upper tail sub-
sequence, formed simply by skipping over an initial string. Order matters, and
repetitions aren’t allowed, so
x2, x1, x4, x3, x6, x5, . . .
and
x1, x1, x2, x2, x3, x3, . . .
are not considered subsequences of the “parent” {xn}.
Subsequences may or may not behave much like their parents. If, say,
x1, x2, x3, x4, · · · = 1, 2, 1, 2, . . . ,
then {xn} has no single limit, and therefore diverges. But the subsequences
x1, x3, x5, · · · = 1, 1, 1, . . .
and
x2, x4, x6, · · · = 2, 2, 2, . . .
obviously converge to 1 and 2, respectively. Still other subsequences, such as
x3, x6, x9, x12, . . .
and
x1, x10, x100, x1000, . . .
may or may not converge. By contrast, the sequence {yn} with
y1, y2, y3, y4, · · · = 1.0, 0.1, 0.01, 0.001, . . .
converges to zero—and so does every one of its subsequences, including
y1, y3, y5, . . . y83, . . .
and
y1, y10, y100, . . . , y1041, . . . .
Stranger examples are possible.

EXAMPLE 1. (A walk along the rationals.)
Because Q is countably inﬁnite, it
can be listed as a sequence r1, r2, r3, r4, . . . . Is there a subsequence consisting
entirely of positive integers? Must some subsequence converge to zero?
SOLUTION.
Yes and yes. Lacking rigorous deﬁnitions, we’ll argue (very!) in-
Coming soon.
formally.
To ﬁnd a subsequence of positive integers, imagine walking from left to right
along the rational sequence, underlining each term that happens to be a positive
integer. The result might look like this:
r1, r2, r3, r4, r5, r6, . . . , r23, r24, r25, . . . , r1234, r1235, . . . .
The process never stops because the supply of positive integers is inﬁnite, so we
have our desired subsequence:
r2, r3, r24, r1235 . . . .
To ﬁnd a subsequence that converges to zero, recall ﬁrst that for every positive
ǫ, no matter how small, the interval (−ǫ, ǫ) contains inﬁnitely many rationals. To
ﬁnd our desired subsequence, therefore, we walk again from left to right along the
original sequence. At some position, say a9, we ﬁnd a9 ∈(−1, 1). Continuing
our rightward walk, we ﬁnd, say,
a17 ∈(−0.1, 0.1),
a137 ∈(−0.01, 0.01),
a2988 ∈(−0.001, 0.001),
and so on. We never need to stop because, at any stage, we’ve left behind only
ﬁnitely many of the inﬁnite family of residents of (−ǫ, ǫ).
♦
Similar reasoning shows that any listing {rn} of Q has subsequences consist-
ing entirely of prime numbers or entirely of fractions with denominator 424242.
It is less obvious—but true—that {rn} has an increasing subsequence with limit
π, a decreasing subsequence with limit e, a decreasing subsequence of integers
diverging to −∞, and countless other subsequences of interest. We sort out such
possibilities in this section.
Formalities. The idea of subsequences is simple enough but the notation takes
some getting used to. To create a subsequence from a given sequence {an} means
to choose a strictly increasing sequence of subscripts
n1 < n2 < n3 < n4 < n5 < . . . ,
and use them to form the subsequence
an1, an2, an3, an4, an5, . . . .

108
2. Sequences and Series
If, say, n1 = 4, n2 = 7, n3 = 11, n4 = 29, . . . , then the subsequence has the
form
a4, a7, a11, a29, . . . .
The entire subsequence is denoted {ank}; note the double subscript.
The process can be described precisely in the language of functions. Recall,
ﬁrst, that a sequence {an} is a function a : N →R, with a(1) = a1, a(2) = a2,
etc. From this viewpoint a subsequence is formed by composition, as the formal
deﬁnition says:
Deﬁnition 2.11 (Subsequence). Let {an} be a sequence, regarded as a function
a : N →R. A subsequence {ank} of {an} is a composite function a◦n : N →R,
where n : N →N is any strictly increasing function.
Observe:
• A useful inequality: The deﬁnition implies a simple inequality that is use-
ful in proofs: nk ≥k for all k. A formal proof might involve induction
or the pigeonhole principle, but the idea is mainly common sense—the kth
term of a subsequence can’t appear before the kth term of the parent se-
quence.
• Another subsequence: The subsequence indices n1, n2, n3, n4, . . . for
{ank} form still another subsequence—a strictly increasing subsequence
of {1, 2, 3, . . . }.
EXAMPLE 2.
Let {an} be a sequence. Interpret the subsequences
a1, a3, a5, a7, . . .
and
a2, a4, a6, a8, . . .
in functional language and notation. What can be said about {an} if both subse-
quences converge to three?
SOLUTION.
For the “odd” subsequence we have n(1) = 1, n(2) = 3, and
n(42) = 83; in general, n(k) = nk = 2k −1. Thus,
a ◦n(k) = a(n(k)) = a(2k −1)
for all k. In ordinary sequence notation, we can write {ank} = {a2k−1}; notice
that k, not n, is now the index variable. For the “even” subsequence similar
reasoning gives {ank} = {a2k}.
If both subsequences {a2k−1} and {a2k} converge to three, then it is reason-
able to expect the parent sequence {an} to do so as well. To prove this let ǫ > 0
A bit laboriously.
be given. By hypothesis, there exist numbers K1 and K2 such that
k > K1 =⇒|a2k−1 −3| < ǫ
and
k > K2 =⇒|a2k −3| < ǫ.

2.3. Subsequences
109
Now it turns out that N = max {2K1, 2K2} “works” for ǫ in the parent sequence.
To see why, suppose n > N. If n = 2k happens to be even, then n = 2k >
2K2, and so k > K2, which implies that
|an −3| = |a2k −3| < ǫ.
If n = 2k −1 is odd, then n = 2k −1 > 2K1, and so k > K1, and we see
|an −3| = |a2k−1 −3| < ǫ.
Thus we have |an −3| < ǫ for all n > N, and the proof is complete.

Properties of Subsequences
Every inﬁnite sequence {xn} has countless subsequences. What can be said about
Uncountably many, in fact.
such an enormous set? The answer is, “quite a lot”: subsequences often “inherit”
their parents’ basic properties.
Theorem 2.12. Let {xn} be a sequence and L a number.
(a) If {xn} converges to L, then every subsequence {xnk} converges to L, too.
(b) If {xn} diverges to ±∞, then every subsequence {xnk} diverges to ±∞,
too.
(c) If {xn} has subsequences converging to different limits, then {xn} di-
verges.
About proofs. Key to both proofs is the fact, mentioned above, that, for any sub-
sequence, nk ≥k for all k. To prove (a), let ǫ > 0 be given. By hypothesis there
exists N that works for {xn} in the sense that |xn −L| < ǫ whenever n > N.
The key fact above implies that the same N works for {xnk}; if k > N then
nk ≥k > N, and so |xnk −L| < ǫ, as desired.
The proof of (b) is similar, and (c) follows immediately from (a). Further
details are left to exercises.
Monotone subsequences. Following is a striking property of every sequence;
we’ll make good use of it below in proving this section’s marquee result, the
celebrated Bolzano–Weierstrass theorem.
Proposition 2.13. Every sequence has a monotone subsequence.
Proposition 2.13 is easy to state, but it’s a bit tricky to prove anything about all
“Nontrivial,” in math-speak.
sequences—convergent or divergent, bounded or unbounded, tame or wild. Here,

for instance, is a randomly-chosen stretch (from n = 125 to n = 130) of terms
from the sequence {n cos(n2)}:
. . . , 35.617, −4.847, 126.746, −106.052, −128.983, −25.531, . . . .
It is hard to see much pattern there, but Proposition 2.13 guarantees that some-
where in there is an increasing subsequence, a decreasing subsequence, or maybe
both.
We’ll sneak up on a proof of Proposition 2.13 through two technical lemmas
about special cases.
Lemma 2.14. Every unbounded sequence {xn} has a monotone subsequence
that diverges to ±∞.
Proof (sketch): For a sequence {xn} unbounded above, we’ll ﬁnd an increasing
sequence {xnk} with xnk > k for all k. Since {xn} is unbounded above, we can
choose n1 so xn1 > 1. Now the “upper tail”
xn1+1, xn1+2, xn1+3, xn1+4, . . .
is also unbounded above, and so we can choose n2 with n2 > n1 and xn2 >
Do you see why?
max{2, xn1}. Then we choose n3 > n2 with xn3 > max{3, xn2}. Continuing
this process produces the desired subsequence. A similar construction produces a
strictly decreasing subsequence if {xn} is unbounded below.
□
Lemma 2.15. Let {xn} be a boundedsequence, with inﬁmum α and supremum β.
If α /∈{xn}, then there is a decreasing subsequence {xnk} with xnk →α. If
β /∈{xn}, then there is an increasing subsequence {xnk} with xnk →β.
Proof (sketch): To save a little labor we’ll use Lemma 2.14 and some fancy alge-
bra. In the case β /∈{xn}, we deﬁne a new sequence {yn} by the rule
yn =
1
β −xn
.
Now {yn} is unbounded above, and so Lemma 2.14 guarantees that there is an
Do you see why?
increasing subsequence {ynk} with ynk →∞. But this implies that
1
ynk
= β −xnk →0.
This implies, in turn, that {xnk} is increasing, with limit β. A similar argument
applies if α /∈{xn}.
□
At last we can prove Proposition 2.13. Watch for the completeness axiom to
pop up, and for Lemma 2.15 to provide the key technical insight.

2.3. Subsequences
111
Proof (of Proposition 2.13): Let {xn} be our sequence. If {xn} is unbounded,
we’re done, by Lemma 2.14. So we’ll assume that
(i) {xn} is bounded,
and
(ii) {xn} has no increasing subsequence,
and use these assumptions to construct a decreasing subsequence.
To get started, let β1 = sup{x1, x2, x3, . . . }. (Assumption (i) and the com-
pleteness axiom guarantee that β1 exists.) The key observation is that β1 is in the
set {x1, x2, x3, . . . }. Otherwise, says Lemma 2.15, some increasing subsequence
would converge to β1. Thus, we can ﬁnd n1 with xn1 = β1; this is the ﬁrst term
of our desired subsequence.
To continue, we set
β2 = sup {xn1+1, xn1+2, xn1+3, . . . } ,
Again, β2 exists by the completeness axiom, and Lemma 2.15, applied this time
to the upper tail sequence
xn1+1, xn1+2, xn1+3, xn1+4 . . . ,
implies that β2 = xn2 for some n2 > n1. It is clear, too, that β2 ≤β1, as β2
bounds a smaller set than does β1.
Continuing this process indeﬁnitely produces the desired decreasing subse-
quence {xn1, xn2, xn3, . . . }, and the proof is complete.
□
A big theorem. It is now easy to prove a famous theorem, which we’ll use re-
peatedly. We’ve done all the hard work.
Starting in the very next section.
Theorem 2.16 (Bolzano–Weierstrass). Every bounded sequence {xn} has a con-
vergent subsequence.
Proof: By Proposition 2.13, {xn} has a monotone subsequence {xnk}, which is
also bounded because {xn} is. By Theorem 2.3, page 88, every monotone and
bounded sequence converges.

Cauchy Sequences
The obvious way to prove that a sequence {xn} converges is to know or guess a
limit, say L, and then show that xn ≈L for large n (in the precise sense of the
deﬁnition). For some sequences no obvious candidate for L presents itself, but
we may know instead that the xn are close to each other for large n. Consider,
for instance, the sequence {sn}:
1, 1 −1
3, 1 −1
3 + 1
5, 1 −1

7, . . . .
Here are approximate numerical values for the ﬁrst few sn:

Successive sn appear to jump back and forth across smaller and smaller intervals.
Does {sn} approach some limit?
In this particular case the answer is classical. Our sequence {sn} is derived
from the famous Leibniz series

which has been known for at least 300 years to converge to π/4 ≈0.7854. More
generally, {sn} illustrates the notion of a Cauchy sequence, named for the French
mathematician Augustin–Louis Cauchy (1789–1857), a key ﬁgure in the devel-
opment of real analysis.
Cauchy Basics
The formal deﬁnition describes precisely what we mean by “close to each other
for large n.”
Deﬁnition 2.17. A sequence {xn} is Cauchy if, for every ǫ > 0, there exists N
such that
|xn −xm| < ǫ
whenever n > m > N.
Observe:
• Similar, but different: The deﬁnition resembles that for convergence, but
with a key difference: no limit L is mentioned.
• Not just consecutive terms: The deﬁnition requires that all terms with large
index be close to each other. This applies not only to consecutive terms, like
x12345 and x12346, but also to any two terms with large index, like x12345
and x98765.

• A minor convenience: The condition n > m in the deﬁnition is sometimes
convenient in proofs. This apparent asymmetry is actually harmless, be-
cause the case n = m is trivial, and we lose no generality in using n to
denote the larger of two indices.
EXAMPLE 1.
As we know, the sequence {1/n} converges to zero, while {√n}
diverges to inﬁnity. Is either sequence Cauchy?
SOLUTION.
The sequence {1/n} is Cauchy. Intuitively, we expect that, since
terms approach zero, they must also stay close to each other. To prove this for-
mally, let ǫ > 0 be given, and set N = 1/ǫ. This N “works,” since if n > m > N,
then
Notice where we use n > m.
|xn −xm| =

1
n −1
m
 = 1
m −1
n < 1
m <
1
1/ǫ = ǫ,
as the deﬁnition requires.
The sequence {√n} is not Cauchy—even though the difference between suc-
cessive terms (like
√
123456 ≈351.363 and
√
123457 ≈351.364) tends to zero.
We can prove this formally by showing that if ǫ = 1, then no N works in the sense
of the deﬁnition. Indeed, let N be any positive number, and let k be any positive
integer with k2 > N. If we set m = k2 and n = (k + 1)2, then
n > m > N
but
√n −√m = 1 = ǫ,
and so the deﬁnition is not satisﬁed.
♦
EXAMPLE 2.
The sequence {sn} at the beginning of this section is Cauchy.
Explain why.
SOLUTION.
The key idea, on which a formal proof can be based, is the se-
quence’s back-and-forth behavior:
s2 < s4 < s6 < s8 < · · · < s7 < s5 < s3 < s1,
combined with the fact that the distance between successive terms tends to zero.
If, say, ǫ = 0.001, we could set N = 1000, and observe that if n > m > 1000,
then
s1000 < sn, sm ≤s1001 = s1000 +
1
1001,
which implies that sn and sm lie within 1/1001 of each other.

2. Sequences and Series
Morals from the examples. The examples suggest, correctly, a close connec-
tion between sequence convergence and the Cauchy property. Indeed, the two
properties turn out to be equivalent. As we’ll see, it is easy to show that every
convergent sequence is also Cauchy. The fact that every Cauchy sequence con-
verges is deeper, and proving it takes a little more work. The Bolzano–Weierstrass
theorem—another convergence guarantee—will be useful.
Properties of Cauchy Sequences
First we pick two low-hanging fruits.
Proposition 2.18. If {xn} converges, then {xn} is Cauchy.
The basic idea is that if both xn and xm are eventually close to a limit L, then
they must also be close to each other. The proof makes this precise.
Proof: Suppose xn →L. For given ǫ > 0, we can choose N such that |xn−L| <
ǫ/2 whenever n > N. This N works in the Cauchy sequence deﬁnition, because
Why is it OK to use ǫ/2, not ǫ?
if n > m > N, then
|xn −xm| ≤|xn −L| + |xm −L| < ǫ
2 + ǫ
2 = ǫ;
we used the triangle inequality in the ﬁrst step.
□
Proposition 2.19. If {xn} is Cauchy, then {xn} is bounded.
Proof: For ǫ = 1, choose N as in the Cauchy deﬁnition. Now ﬁx any integer
m0 with m0 > N. If n > m0, then we have |xn −xm0| < 1, or, equivalently,
xm0 −1 < xn < xm0 + 1. In particular, the set {xm0, xm0+1, xm0+2, . . . } is
bounded (above by xm0 + 1 and below by xm0 −1). Since the remaining terms
{x1, x2, . . . xm0−1} form a ﬁnite set, the entire sequence {xn} is bounded.
□
Combining Proposition 2.19 with the Bolzano–Weierstrass theorem lets us prove
our main theoretical result.
Watch for another ǫ/2 trick.
Theorem 2.20. A sequence {xn} converges if and only if {xn} is Cauchy.
Proof: Proposition 2.18 is the “only if” part. To prove the “if” part, suppose that
{xn} is Cauchy. Proposition 2.19 implies that {xn} is bounded; by the Bolzano–
Weierstrass theorem, {xn} has a subsequence {xnk} that converges to some limit,
say, L. To complete the proof, we’ll show that the full sequence {xn} also con-
verges to L.
Let ǫ > 0 be given. Since {xn} is Cauchy, we can choose N1 such that
|xn −xm| < ǫ/2
whenever
n > m ≥N1.

2.4. Cauchy Sequences
117
Because {xnk} converges to L, we can choose a member of the subsequence, say
xN, with N > N1 and |xN −L| < ǫ/2. Now this N works in the deﬁnition of

convergence of {xn} to L, because if n ≥N, then
|xn −L| ≤|xn −xN| + |xN −L| < ǫ

as desired.

EXAMPLE 3.
A “random walk” sequence a1, a2, a3, . . . is produced iteratively,
with help from a fair coin. First we ﬂip the coin and set a1 = 1 if heads show
and a1 = −1 otherwise. Then we ﬂip again and set a2 = a1 + 1/2 for heads and
a2 = a1 −1/2 for tails. We ﬂip again at each stage, and set
an+1 =
(
an +

2n
if heads,
an −
1
2n
if tails.
Particular values of ak depend, of course, on random coin ﬂips. Here’s what

−1.1445,
−1.1426,
−1.1436,
. . . .
Must every such sequence converge?
SOLUTION.
Yes, thanks to Theorem 2.20. The sequence {an} is Cauchy—no
matter how the coin falls. To prove this formally observe ﬁrst that, for any an and
am with n > m, we have
|an −am| =

Now for given ǫ > 0, we can choose N with 1/2N−1 < ǫ. This N works in the
Cauchy deﬁnition, because if n > m ≥N, then, as just shown,
|an −am| <
1
2m−1 ≤

2N−1 < ǫ,
as desired.

2. Sequences and Series
Cauchy, convergence, completeness: crucial C-words. This section’s main re-
sult, that Cauchy sequences converge, is not obvious; proving it took planning
and effort. The work is worthwhile because it guarantees that sequences like
those of Example 3, for which the terms become close together in a strong sense,
do indeed have speciﬁc numerical limits. Without such guarantees it would be
difﬁcult, for example, to deﬁne the integral of a function (another kind of limit)
unambiguously.
As we’ll do later.
Another C-word—completeness—is at the heart of Theorem 2.20. Complete-
ness appears implicitly in the proof, by way of the Bolzano–Weierstrass theorem,
which itself required the completeness axiom. (We invoked it in proving Proposi-
tion 2.13, page 109, for example.) Indeed, completeness is sometimes deﬁned not
in terms of the supremum (as was done earlier; see page 74) but rather in terms of
Cauchy sequence convergence. We pursue this connection brieﬂy in the exercises.
Exercises
1. Show that each of the following sequences either is or is not Cauchy. (Use
the deﬁnition, not theorems.)

2. Let {xn} and {yn} be Cauchy sequences. Use Deﬁnition 2.17 to show that
{xn + yn} is Cauchy, too.
3. Let {xn} be a Cauchy sequence such that x1 = 0 = x10 = x100 = x1000 =
. . . . Use Deﬁnition 2.17 (not theorems) to show that {xn} converges to
zero.
4. Let {xn} be a Cauchy sequence, with xn ∈Z for all n. Show that {xn}
is “eventually constant”—i.e., there exists N > 0 such that xn = xm
whenever n > m > N.
5. As we said at the end of this section, completeness can be deﬁned using
Cauchy sequences: A subset A ⊆R is complete if every Cauchy sequence
{xn} contained in A has a limit in A. Use this deﬁnition below.
(a) The set Q of rational numbers is not complete. Show this by ﬁnding a
Cauchy sequence {rn} of rational numbers that has no rational limit.

(a) Use the deﬁnition of a Cauchy sequence (not theorems) to show that
if {xn} is Cauchy, then so is {yn}.
(b) Use any convenient theorems to give a shorter (not necessarily better)
proof that if {xn} is Cauchy, then so is {yn}.
7. Let {an} be a Cauchy sequence. Show that if {xn} is a sequence such that
|xn −xm| ≤42 |an −am| for all n and m, then {xn} is Cauchy, too.
8. This problem is about the sequence {an} in Example 3, page 117.
(a) Under what circumstances is {an} monotone?
(b) Suppose the ﬁrst six coin tosses show HT HT HT . Find the smallest
interval in which the limit can lie.
(c) Explain why −2 < an < 2 for all n (regardless of the coin tosses).
9. Consider the sequence {πn} deﬁned by π1 = 3.1, π2 = 3.14, π3 = 3.141,
...; for each n, πn shows the ﬁrst n decimal digits of π. Show (use the
deﬁnition, not theorems) that {πn} is Cauchy.
10. This problem is about the fact that if {xn} and {yn} are Cauchy sequences,
then the product sequence {xnyn} is Cauchy, too.
(a) Use Theorem 2.20, page 116, and any other already-proved results to
explain why the fact holds.
(b) (Harder.) Prove the same fact without using Theorem 2.20, page 116.
(Hints: An algebraic trick and the triangle inequality give
|xnyn −xmym| = |xnyn −xnym + xnym −xmym|
≤|xnyn −xnym| + |xnym −xmym| .
Now use boundedness of both {xn} and {yn} (Proposition 2.19) to
complete the proof.)
11. Let {an} be a sequence for which successive terms are “very close” in the
sense that |an+1 −an| ≤1/2n+1 for all n. Show that {an} is Cauchy.
Hint: For any n and m with n > m, we have

Series 101: Basic Ideas
An inﬁnite series is a sum with inﬁnitely many summands, or terms:
∞
X
k=1
ak = a1 + a2 + a3 + . . . .
Here are two important examples, each of which we will revisit:

4 + . . . .
As usual for inﬁnite processes, some obvious questions arise. Is there some limit
(or “inﬁnite sum”) to which the series converges? How do we decide? If a series
has a limit, how do we ﬁnd it?
A ﬁrst observation is that series are close kin to sequences—about which we
already know a lot. Indeed, every series P ak corresponds in a natural way to
a certain sequence {An} whose properties tell us “everything” about the series.
We’ll deﬁne it in a moment.
The ﬂaw in this happy scenario is that, in practice, getting one’s hands directly on
the sequence {An} can be difﬁcult. Much of what follows can be thought of as
strategy for getting around this problem.
Enough generalities.
Deﬁnition 2.21. For a given series P∞
k=1 ak = a1 + a2 + a3 + . . . , the sequence
of partial sums is given by
A1 = a1,
A2 = a1 + a2,
. . . ,
An = a1 + a2 + · · · + an,
. . . .
In general, An = Pn
k=1 ak.

inﬁnity?
It turns out—as you probably know, and as we will review in exercises—that
{Hn} diverges to inﬁnity. This has been known for at least 650 years, thanks to
the French philosopher and bishop Nicole Oresme. The moral for now is that this
partial sum sequence has no simple formula, and so requires some work-around
effort to analyze. This state of affairs is typical—most series don’t have partial
sum sequences with nice, “closed form” expressions. Exceptions, like the ﬁrst
series above, are precious.

2. Sequences and Series
Series: The Basics
Our systematic discussion starts, as usual, with a formal deﬁnition.
Deﬁnition 2.22. Let P∞
k=1 ak be a series of numbers, and {An} its sequence
of partial sums. If {An} converges to a ﬁnite limit A, then we say P∞
k=1 ak
converges to the sum A, and write P∞
k=1 ak = A. Otherwise, P∞
k=1 ak diverges.
Notes on notation. Sigma notation packs a lot of information into a small suit-
case—and so may need careful unpacking. For instance, all of the following
expressions mean exactly the same thing:

With due care taken, such cosmetic differences won’t cause trouble. For typo-
graphical economy, moreover, we will write just P ak, not P∞
k=1 ak, when con-
fusion seems unlikely.
As another example of notational alternatives, observe that the equation

is a highly compressed form of the deﬁnition of convergence of a series P ak to
the sum A. There is no shame—and often added clarity—in expanding things a
bit, so we might write, instead,
Efﬁciency isn’t everything.
a1 + a2 + a3 + · · · = lim
n→∞(a1 + a2 + a3 + · · · + an) = A.

P ak: one for which ak ≥0 for all k. In this case the partial sum sequence
{A1, A2, A3, . . . } is increasing:
a1 ≤a1 + a2 ≤a1 + a2 + a3 ≤a1 + a2 + a3 + a4 ≤. . . .
By Theorem 2.3, page 88, there are only two possibilities: Either {An} converges,
or it diverges to inﬁnity. If we can somehow rule out either alternative, the other
must apply.
Algebra with convergent series. Convergent series, like convergent sequences,
allow basic algebraic operations; the following theorem has a counterpart for se-
quences in Theorem 2.5, page 96. Proofs of the following theorem, too, follow
easily from those for sequences.
Theorem 2.23 (Algebra with convergent series). Let P an and P bn be con-
vergent sequences, with respective sums A and B.
• Sums and differences: P (an ± bn) converges to A ± B; equivalently,
X
(an ± bn) =
X
an ±
X
bn.
• Constant multiples: P can converges to cA; equivalently,
X
can = c
X
an.
Proof: We will leave the proof for sums as an exercise. For constant multiples
we want to show, in effect, that the distributive law applies to (convergent) inﬁnite
sums. To do this, we need to show that the sequence of partial sums
ca1, ca1 + ca2, ca1 + ca2 + ca3, . . .
converges to cA. This follows from the distributive law for ﬁnite sums, and from
what we already know about sequences. By the distributive law, we can rewrite
the preceding sequence as
ca1, c(a1 + a2), c(a1 + a2 + a3), . . . , c(a1 + a2 + . . . an), . . . ,
or, equivalently, as
cA1, cA2, cA3, . . . , cAn, . . . ,
where {An} is the sequence of partial sums of P an. But we know by hypothesis
that An →A, and the constant multiple rule for sequences implies that cAn →
cA, as desired.

converge or diverge? Why?
SOLUTION.
It diverges. The given series is the sum of two simpler series—
one convergent and one divergent—discussed in Example 1. In fact, every such
sum diverges. To see why, suppose that P an converges and P bn diverges. If
P(an + bn) were convergent, then, by Theorem 2.23, the series
X
bn =

( (an + bn) −an )
would also converge, against our assumption.
♦
Detecting Convergence and Divergence
Theorem 2.23 is nice to know. But it is of little use unless we know that some
particular series converge or diverge. To this end, we need reliable methods for
deciding whether a given series converges or diverges. We address that deﬁcit
next, starting with a simple test for divergence.
Proposition 2.24 (nth term test). If a series P∞
n=1 an converges, then the se-
quence {an} converges to zero.
In practice, the contrapositive is especially useful:
if {an} does not converge to zero, then P an diverges.
The converse,
if an →0 then P an converges,
is tempting but false: a series P an may diverge even if an →0.
Don’t give in. (The harmonic
series is one counterexample.)
Proof: Observe ﬁrst that, for all n > 1,

“telescope.”
An −An−1 = (a1 + · · · + an−1 + an) −(a1 + · · · + an−1) = an.
Now convergence of P an means that An →A for some number A. But then
An−1 →A, too; therefore,
lim
n→∞an = lim
n→∞(An −An−1) = lim
n→∞An −lim

= A −A = 0,
as claimed.

Geometric series: the nicest examples. Proposition 2.24 sometimes helps us
identify divergent series. But we would still like a good source of convergent
series; the geometric family ﬁts that bill.
A geometric series is one of the form
∞
X
k=1
ark−1 = a + ar + ar2 + ar3 + . . . ,
where a and r are any ﬁxed numbers; notice the common ratio r of each summand
to its predecessor. The ﬁrst series discussed above, for instance, is geometric, with
ratio r = 1/2:
∞
X
k=1
1
2k−1 = 1 + 1
2 + 1
4 + 1
8 · · · =
∞
X
k=1
0.5k−1.
Here is another example:
3 + 3.3 + 3.63 + 3.993 + 4.3923 + 4.83153 + 5.314683 + . . . .
The geometric form may be slightly hidden in the numbers, but it is easy to check
that successive terms have common ratio r = 1.1, and so the standard geometric
template P∞
k=1 3 × 1.1k−1 ﬁts the pattern.
Geometric series satisfy a useful algebraic equation:
It’s readily proved by induction.
a + ar + ar2 + ar3 + · · · + arn−1 = a 1 −rn
1 −r
(∗)
holds if r ̸= 1, n is a positive integer, and a is any number. This pretty formula
tells us, almost instantly, whether any geometric series converges and, if so, to
what limit.
Proposition 2.25. Let a and r be any real constants, with a ̸= 0.
(a) If |r| < 1, then P∞
k=1 a rk−1 converges to
a
1−r.
(b) If |r| ≥1, then P∞
k=1 a rk−1 diverges.
We can infer, for instance, that P∞
k=1 0.5k−1 converges to 2—as we proved in
Example 1. By contrast, P∞
k=1 3 × 1.1k−1 diverges—as the numerical evidence
suggests, and as the nth term test also implies.
Proof (sketch): Convergence and divergence of series are all about partial sums,
and Equation (∗) above tells almost the whole story. If r ̸= ±1 we have

What happens to the right side as n →∞? The answer depends entirely on the
rn in the numerator—and that depends, in turn, on the value of r. If |r| < 1, then
rn →0, and so

1 −r ,
as claimed. If |r| > 1, then {arn} is unbounded, and so the series (badly!) fails
the nth term test, and so diverges.
The remaining cases (r = ±1) are much simpler, and left to the exercises. □

The ﬁrst series we recognize—it is geometric and converges to two—but what
about the second? Does it also converge, or might its partial sums diverge to
inﬁnity?

2.5. Series 101: Basic Ideas
127
Comparing the two series suggests some common-sense guesses. Because
each term of the second series is less than its counterpart in the ﬁrst, we expect
the second series, like the ﬁrst, to converge, and to some limit less than two.
Sampling some partial sums {Sn} from this series adds some credence:
S10 ≈1.2625479,
S20 ≈1.2644979,
S30 ≈1.2644998,
. . . .
Comparing series for size in this simple way is valid—and useful. Details are in
the following theorem and proof.
Theorem 2.26 (Comparison test). Let P ak and P bk be series, with 0 ≤ak ≤
bk for all k.
(a) If P bk converges to a number B, then P ak converges to a number A,
with A ≤B.
(b) If P ak diverges, then P bk diverges, too.
Proof: Let {An} and {Bn} be the partial sum sequences for P ak and P bk.
Because {An} and {Bn} are increasing sequences, each converges if—but only
if—it is bounded above. By hypothesis,
An = a1 + a2 + a3 + · · · + an ≤b1 + b2 + b3 + · · · + bn = Bn
for all n. If {Bn} happens to be bounded above, then certainly {An} is also
bounded above, and we have
A = sup{An} ≤sup{Bn} = B.
In this case An →A and Bn →B, as (a) claims. Part (b) follows from part (a).□

For series (c), comparison with P∞
k=1 1/2k is tempting, but some terms of (c)
may be negative, and so Theorem 2.26 doesn’t apply. Still, numerical evidence
suggests convergence; here are some (approximate) partial sums Sn:
s5 ≈0.588433, s10 ≈0.59333, s15 ≈0.59285, s20 ≈0.59284.
The case for convergence looks strong, but we don’t (quite yet) have a proof.
♦
Absolute Convergence
Series (c) from Example 5 stumped us. The next theorem comes just in time.
It’s a triangle inequality, but for
inﬁnitely many summands.
Theorem 2.27. If P |ak| converges then P ak converges too, and

Let’s polish off series (c) from Example 5 before proving this. Clearly,
|sin k|
2k
< 1
2k
for all k, and so Theorem 2.26 guarantees that the left-hand series converges,
to some positive limit less than one. Theorem 2.27, in turn, says that series (c)
converges too, to a limit somewhere in the interval (−1, 1).
We don’t know exactly where.

2.5. Series 101: Basic Ideas
129
The proof, informally. Suppose P |an| converges. To show that P an converges,
too, we need to prove that the partial sum sequence {An} converges. Since we
have no speciﬁc limit in mind, we will show that {An} is a Cauchy sequence, and
then invoke Theorem 2.20, page 116.
We worked hard to prove the
theorem; here comes the
payoff.
Observe ﬁrst that, because P |an| converges, its partial sum sequence
C1 = |a1|, C2 = |a1| + |a2|, C3 = |a1| + |a2| + |a3|, . . .
is convergent, and therefore Cauchy. We will use this fact and the triangle in-
equality to show that {An} is Cauchy, too.
Let ǫ > 0 be given. Because {Cn} is Cauchy we can choose N such that
|Cn −Cm| < ǫ whenever n > m > N. The same N turns out to work for {An},
because if n > m > N, then
Watch for the (ﬁnite) triangle
inequality.
|An −Am| = |(a1 + · · · + am + am+1 + · · · + an) −(a1 + . . . am)|
= |am+1 + am+2 + · · · + an|
≤|am+1| + |am+2| + · · · + |an|
= Cn −Cm = |Cn −Cm| < ǫ.
Thus, {An} is Cauchy and hence also convergent.
Invoking the triangle inequality again gives
|An| = |a1 + a2 + · · · + an| ≤|a1| + |a2| + · · · + |an| = Cn
for all n, and so

This ﬁnishes the proof.
Conditional convergence. A series P ak for which P |ak| converges is called
absolutely convergent. Theorem 2.27 says that every absolutely convergent series
is also convergent in the ordinary sense. The converse, however, is false: A series
P ak may converge while P |ak| diverges. A series with this property is called
conditionally convergent.

SOLUTION.
Taking absolute values of all terms gives the ordinary harmonic
series
1 + 1
2 + 1
3 + 1
4 + 1
5 + . . . ,
which we know to diverge. To see why the alternating version converges, consider
the partial sums {Sn}:
1, 1 −1
2, 1 −1
2 + 1
3, 1 −1
2 + 1
3 −1
4, 1 −1

5 . . . .
Here’s a (rounded) numerical view of S1, . . . , S10:
1.00, 0.500, 0.833, 0.583, 0.783, 0.617, 0.760, 0.635, 0.746, 0.646, . . ..
Notice the pattern: Successive partial sums alternately increase and decrease, but
with smaller and smaller gaps. In particular, for any N, every term Sn with n > N
lies between SN and SN+1. If n > 1000, for example, then
0.69265 ≈S1000 ≤Sn ≤S1001 ≈0.69365.
The same holds for two terms. If n > m > 1000, then both Sn and Sm lie
between 0.69265 and 0.69365, and so lie within 0.001 of each other. Using this
idea we can prove that {Sn} is Cauchy, and hence convergent. We leave details
to the exercises.
So what is the limit? The striking but far-from-obvious exact answer turns
out to be ln 2 ≈0.69315. A rigorous proof is beyond our scope, but numerical
evidence shows we are in the ballpark.

Use this to show (again) that {Hn} diverges. (Hint: If {Hn} were

too.)

ln n for all positive integers n and the fact that ln n →∞. Without a
formal deﬁnition of ln n we can’t prove this rigorously. Instead, draw
a picture illustrating that Hn > ln n; view ln n as the area under the

(i) If r and L are any real numbers and rn →L, then rn+1 →L,
too.
(ii) If r and L are any real numbers and rn →L, then rn+1 =
r rn →r L.
(iii) If r ̸= 0 and rn →L, then L = 0. (Hint: Use the two preceding
parts.)
(iv) If 0 ≤r < 1, then rn →0. (Hint: Use a theorem about
monotone sequences.)

why rn →0 is impossible.)

Series 102: Testing for Convergence
and Estimating Limits
The preceding section was about deﬁnitions and basic ideas. Now we proceed
to deeper investigation of the two main questions about any given series: Does it
converge? If so, to what limit?
We start by expanding our catalog of “known” series.
Meet the family: p-series. A p-series has the form
∞
X
k=1
1
kp = 1
1p + 1
2p + 1
3p + 1
4p + 1
5p + . . . ,
where p is any ﬁxed number. With p = 1 we have the harmonic series, which
we’ve shown to diverge. With p = 2 we get
∞

k=1
1
k2 = 1 + 1
22 + 1
32 + 1

52 + . . . ,
which converges, as we’ll prove in two different ways. The general story on
convergence and divergence is simple:
Proposition 2.28. The p-series P∞
k=1
1
kp converges if p > 1 and diverges if p ≤1.

2.6. Series 102: Testing for Convergence and Estimating Limits

Notes toward a proof. For p ≤1, divergence follows by comparison to the har-
monic series: For all integers k > 1, we have

Because the harmonic series diverges, so must every p-series with p ≥1.

As with any positive series, convergence occurs if the partial sum sequence

keeping to show that the subsequence
S1, S3, S7, S15, S31, . . . , S2n−1, . . .
is bounded above; this implies, in turn, that the entire sequence {Sn} is bounded
above. The idea is to group summands into blocks of length 1, 2, 4, 8, . . . , and
Do you see why?
then estimate the contribution of each block. We illustrate this for S31. The
inequality holds because the ﬁrst term in each block is largest, and the last equality
comes from counting the terms in each block:

the sum—about 5.326—of a convergent geometric series. This completes the
proof for p = 1.3; other exponents p > 1 can be handled similarly.
Sharper Tests for Convergence
Now that we understand the convergence behavior for two important families—
geometric and p-series—we can study convergence and divergence more effec-
tively. First we need some more discriminating convergence tests.

136
2. Sequences and Series
Limit comparison test. The ordinary comparison test (Theorem 2.26, page 127)
is simple and powerful, but can be hard to apply. The limit comparison test can
simplify the work.
Theorem 2.29 (Limit comparison test). Consider two series P ak and P bk with
positive terms, and suppose that {ak/bk} converges to a ﬁnite limit L.
(a) If P bk converges, then P ak converges, too.
(b) If L ̸= 0, then either both P ak and P bk converge or both diverge.
Before proving the theorem, let’s try it out.
EXAMPLE 1.
We showed in Example 2, page 122, that the series P∞
k=1 bk =
P∞
k=1 1/(k2 + k) converges, with sum 1. Use limit comparison to deduce that
some other series converge.
SOLUTION.
We have already shown that the p-series P ak = P 1/k2 con-
verges, but the proof was laborious. Limit comparison is easier. Here is the key
limit:
lim
k→∞
ak
bk
= lim
k→∞
1/k2
1/(k2 + k) = lim
k→∞
k2 + k
k2
= lim
k→∞1 + 1
k = 1,
which implies (again) that P 1/k2 converges.
Similar arguments apply to uglier series. If, say,
∞
X
k=1
ak =
∞
X
k=1
k2 + 7k −3 sin k
2k4 −k
,
then a look at powers of k in the numerator and denominator suggests limit com-
parison with P 1/k2. The strategy turns out to work:
Note the algebra with sequence
limits.

2.
Because the limit is ﬁnite, the ugly series converges.
♦
We’ll prove Theorem 2.29 using two auxiliary facts, each of interest in its own
right.

2.6. Series 102: Testing for Convergence and Estimating Limits
137
Proposition 2.30. Suppose ak = bk for all k > N, where N is any constant.
Then either both P ak and P bk converge (not necessarily to the same limits) or
both diverge.
Proof (sketch): The trick is to compare the partial sum sequences {An} and {Bn},
which turn out to resemble each other. Here is the idea for N = 42; a general
proof is almost identical. If ak = bk for k > 42, and we know n > 42, then
An = a1 + · · · + a42 + a43 + · · · + an
= a1 + · · · + a42 + b43 + · · · + bn
= (a1 + · · · + a42) −(b1 + · · · + b42) + (b1 + · · · + b42) + b43 + · · · + bn
= A42 −B42 + Bn.
Thus, An = A42 −B42 + Bn for n ≥42, which implies that the sequences
{An} and {Bn} either both converge or both diverge. If, in fact, Bn →B, then
An →A42 −B42 + B.

Proposition 2.31 (Bounded comparison test).
Consider two series P ak and
P bk with positive terms, and suppose that the sequence {ak/bk} is bounded
above.
(a) If P bk converges, then P ak converges, too.
(b) If P ak diverges, then P bk diverges, too.

(ordinary) comparison test, P ak must also converge, as claimed in (a). Part (b)
is the contrapositive of (a).
□
The limit comparison test is a special case of Proposition 2.31, so the proof is
easy.
Proof (of Theorem 2.29): Because {ak/bk} converges, it is also bounded above,
and so Proposition 2.31 implies part (a).
Now suppose, as in (b), that L ̸= 0. In this case {bk/ak} converges to 1/L,
and we can apply (a) to conclude that if P ak converges, P bk must do so, too.
Sorting out the a’s and b’s is a
little confusing . . . but it all works
out.
This establishes the claim in (b) about convergence; the statement about diver-
gence is equivalent.
□
The ratio test. For a geometric series, the ratio of successive terms is a constant r,
and convergence depends on the magnitude of r. The ratio test generalizes this
principle to a large class of series that, although not geometric, behave “in the
limit” something like geometric series. The theorem makes these ideas precise.

2. Sequences and Series
Theorem 2.32 (Ratio test). Consider a series P ak with positive terms, and sup-
pose that the sequence {ak+1/ak} converges to a ﬁnite limit L.
(a) If L < 1 then P ak converges.
(b) If L > 1 then P ak diverges.
(c) If L = 1 the test is inconclusive; P ak may converge or diverge.
Let’s try it out.

What does it say about the harmonic series?
SOLUTION.
The ratio test says that the ﬁrst series converges. The ratio in ques-
tion collapses nicely:
ak+1
ak
= 1/(k + 1)!
1/k!
=
k!
(k + 1)! =
1 · 2 · · · · · k
1 · 2 · · · · · k · (k + 1) =

k + 1.
The last quantity converges to zero as k →∞, so the ratio test guarantees con-
vergence.
The limit-of-ratios calculation is just as easy for the harmonic series:
ak+1
ak
= 1/(k + 1)
1/k
=
k
k + 1 →1
as k →∞.
Because the limit is one, however, the ratio test says nothing. The wasted work
is annoying, but only mildly so: we knew already from other arguments that the
harmonic series diverges.
♦
The ratio test wasn’t the right
tool for this job.
Proof (of the ratio test): We prove (a) and leave (b) and (c) to the exercises. Given
L < 1, as in (a), choose any real number r with L < r < 1. Then the geometric

series 1 + r + r2 + . . . converges, and we’ll use “bounded comparison” (Propo-
sition 2.31) to show that P ak converges, too.
Doing so requires a basic observation about limits and an algebraic trick. The
observation is that, because ak+1/ak →L and L < r, there must be a number N
such that
ak+1
ak
< r
whenever
k > N.
To complete the proof, using Proposition 2.31, we’ll show that the sequence
{ak/rk} is bounded. To do this it is enough to assume k > N. In this case,
The remaining terms, with k ≤
N, form a ﬁnite set.

Now the last quantity is constant (independent of k), and so the sequence is
bounded, as desired.

which have both positive and negative terms. What can we do?
We’ve already seen one work-around: test P |ak|, not P ak, for convergence.
Theorem 2.27, page 128, guarantees that if the former converges, so does the
latter. Indeed, we already used this method (Example 5, page 127) to show that
the ﬁrst series converges.
This approach fails for the second series, however, because

which diverges. We need another strategy.
It’s a p-series with p = 1/2.
The series P(−1)k−1/
√
k resembles the alternating harmonic series
P(−1)k−1/k, which we’ve shown to converge. (See Example 6, page 129.)
The former series turns out to converge, too, and for essentially the same reasons.
The following theorem applies to these and to other alternating series—ones for
which successive terms alternate in sign. It is convenient to write such a series in
the form P∞
k=1(−1)k−1ak = a1 −a2 + a3 −. . . , where ak ≥0 for all k.
A series that starts with a1 + a 2
– . . . needs a tiny change in
notation, but no new ideas.
Theorem 2.33 (Alternating series test). Let P∞
k=1(−1)k−1ak be an alternating
series such that
(i) the sequence {ak} is positive and decreasing: a1 ≥a2 ≥a3 ≥· · · > 0;
(ii) ak →0 as k →∞.
Then the series converges, and the limit S lies between any two successive partial
sums Sn and Sn+1.

as needed. Thus our series converges to some limit S, which lies between any two
successive partial sums. For instance, we have
S100 ≈0.55502 < S < 0.65453 ≈S101
and
S1002 ≈0.58911 < S < 0.62068 ≈S1003.
♦
Proof (of Theorem 2.33): The proof depends on a pleasing pattern among the par-
tial sums:
S2 ≤S4 ≤S6 ≤S8 ≤· · · ≤S7 ≤S5 ≤S3 ≤S1.
All of these inequalities hold because the terms alternate in sign but decrease in
size. The reasons are straightforward but pretty, and best thought through for
oneself.
Start small. See, e.g., why
S 5 ≥S 8.
In particular, the odd-index subsequence S1, S3, S5, . . . is decreasing and
bounded below (by any even-index term, such as S8), while the even-index sub-
sequence S2, S4, S6, . . . is increasing and bounded above. Hence both of these
subsequences converge. They tend to the same limit, moreover, because
S2k −S2k−1 = a2k,
and the right side tends to zero as n tends to inﬁnity. This implies, ﬁnally, that
{Sn} itself converges, as desired, and that the limit, S, satisﬁes the main inequal-
ity:
S2 ≤S4 ≤S6 ≤S8 ≤· · · ≤S ≤· · · ≤S7 ≤S5 ≤S3 ≤S1.
□
Estimating Limits
We have now acquired and sharpened several tools for detecting whether a lot of
series converge or diverge. That’s nice, but what about the limits themselves? The
bad news is that exact limits may be hard or impossible to ﬁnd. (The family of
geometric series is a rare but important exception.) The good news is that the same
tools, cleverly employed, can also help us estimate limits with good precision.

converges. What can we say about a limit?
SOLUTION.
Listing the ﬁrst few (rounded) partial sums Sn,
1, 2, 2.5, 2.66667, 2.70833, 2.71667, 2.71806, 2.71825, 2.71828, 2.71828,
suggests a limit somewhere near S10 ≈2.71828. Could the limit be the number e?
Can we be sure? The Sn are strictly increasing, after all, so what would prevent,
say, S123456789 > 3? How much can the rest of our series

contribute, at most?
The comparison test idea gives a quick (if slightly crude) answer. Since

1

we can compare with a geometric series, for which we do know a limit:

13! + · · · <
1
210 + 1
211 + 1
212 + · · · = 1
29 ≈0.002.
This tells us that S10 ≈2.71828 underestimates the true limit by less than 0.002,
so we can have conﬁdence in (at least) the ﬁrst three digits.
♦
Bounding the tail: lessons from Example 4. For any convergent series P ak
and any partial sum Sn we can write
∞
X
k=1
ak = (a1 + a2 + · · · + an) + (an+1 + an+2 + . . . ) = Sn + Rn,
where Rn = P∞
k=n+1 ak is the nth upper tail, or remainder.
The idea illustrated in Example 4 is to bound the tail: If we can somehow
show that |Rn| is small, then the limit S = Sn + Rn must be close to the ﬁnite
sum Sn, which we can compute without any worries over convergence. Upper
tails are often bounded by comparison to suitable geometric series, for which
(atypically) we can ﬁnd exact limits.
We should confess, ﬁnally, that the exact limit of the series in Example 4 is
well known to be e ≈2.71828182846. A rigorous proof requires methods we
haven’t developed; our point here is that reasonable accuracy is available using
basic arguments.

29 .
For the present series we ﬁnd S10 ≈0.367879, and we conclude that the exact
limit lies somewhere within about 0.002 of S10.
But we can do better—with less work—using Theorem 2.33, which guaran-
tees that the exact limit lies between any two successive partial sums. Calculating
S9 ≈.3678792 and S10 ≈0.3678795 gives us about six decimal places of accu-
racy. Again, our estimate plays well with the exact limit, which can be shown by
other methods to be 1/e ≈0.367879441.

Lim sup and lim inf: A Guided Discovery
This brief section, designed for self-study, explores two useful generalizations of
the “ordinary” limit of a sequence: the limit superior and the limit inferior (also
known as the upper limit and the lower limit, respectively).
Results of this section are not
needed in later sections of the
book.
Deﬁning the lim sup. Given any bounded sequence {xn}, we can deﬁne the new
We will discuss unbounded
sequences below.
sequence {vn}
v1 = sup{x1, x2, x3, . . . };
v2 = sup{x2, x3, x4, . . . };
. . .
vn = sup{xn, xn+1, xn+2, . . . }.
(We’ll call this the sup-sequence associated to {xn}.)
Now we can give the deﬁnition:
lim sup xn = lim
n→∞vn.
In brief: lim sup xn = limn→∞sup {xk | k ≥n}.
Basic problems.
1. For each of the following sequences {xn}, ﬁnd the corresponding sequence
{vn}; then ﬁnd lim sup xn.
(a) {xn} = {1, 1, 1, 1, . . .}.
(b) {xn} =

2. Why must all the vi exist in the sup-sequence? Why must {vn} have a
limit? (Cite appropriate theorems.)
3. How are lim xn and lim sup xn related to each other for a bounded se-
quence {xn}? Can one exist but not the other? Can both exist but be
different?

2.7. Lim sup and lim inf: A Guided Discovery
147
The lim inf. The lim inf is closely analogous to the lim sup.
1. Carefully state an appropriate deﬁnition for the lim inf of a bounded se-
quence. Then ﬁnd lim inf xn for each of the example sequences in the ﬁrst
problem.
2. Find a sequence {xn} with lim sup xn = 5 and lim inf xn = −2.
3. Prove that if lim sup xn = 5 and lim inf xn = 5, then lim xn = 5, too.
4. It seems reasonable that lim inf xn ≤lim sup xn for any bounded sequence
{xn}. Prove this. What happens if the two are equal?
Algebra with the lim inf and the lim sup. The ordinary limit has nice algebraic
properties: for example, lim (xn + yn) = lim xn + lim yn (assuming that both
limits on the right side exist). Do lim inf and lim sup have similar properties?
1. Suppose lim sup xn = S, lim inf xn = I, and k is a constant. What can
be said about lim sup kxn and lim inf kxn? (Hints: Experiment with your
example from above, and with several possible values of k.)
2. If lim sup xn = L and lim sup yn = M, what can be said about lim sup(xn
+ yn)? (Show that lim sup(xn + yn) ≤L + M.)
Unbounded sequences. If {xn} is unbounded above, then the sup-sequence
{vn} doesn’t exist, but it is natural to deﬁne lim sup xn = ∞. Similarly, if {xn}
is unbounded below, then we deﬁne lim inf xn = −∞.
1. Find the lim sup and the lim inf of the sequence −1, −2, −3, −4, . . .. Find
a sequence {xn} with lim sup xn = ∞and lim inf xn = −∞.
2. Show that every sequence (bounded or not) has a lim sup and a lim inf.
3. If lim sup xn = +∞, must lim xn = +∞, too? If lim sup xn = −∞,
must lim xn = −∞, too?
Lim sups, lim infs, and subsequences. The lim sup and the lim inf of a se-
quence {xn} are closely connected to subsequences of {xn}, as the following
proposition suggests.
Proposition 2.34. Let {xn} be a sequence.
(a) If {xn} is unbounded above (so lim sup xn = ∞), then some subsequence
{xnk} diverges to inﬁnity.
(b) If {xn} is bounded above, with lim sup xn = L, then some subsequence
{xnk} converges to L.

148
2. Sequences and Series
Proof: Claim (a) is essentially Lemma 2.14, page 110.
To prove claim (b), let’s construct a subsequence {xnk} such that, for all k,
L −1
k ≤xnk ≤vk = sup{xk, xk+1, . . . ,
where {vk} is the usual sup-sequence. Now the sequences at left and right both
clearly converge to L, so our subsequence {xnk} is “squeezed” to the same limit.
To construct the desired subsequence, observe ﬁrst that L −1 < L ≤v1.
Thus L −1 is not an upper bound for {x1, x2, x3, . . . }, so we can ﬁnd xn1
with L −1 < xn1 ≤v1, as desired.
Similarly, L −1/2 is not an upper
bound for {xn1+1, xn1+2, xn1+3, . . . }, so there is some xn2 with n2 > n1 and
L −1/2 < xn2 ≤vn2 ≤v2, as desired. Continuing this process produces the
desired subsequence {xn1, xn2, xn3, . . . }.
□
Use these ideas in the following problems.
1. Show that if lim sup xn = 5, then there is a subsequence {xnk} that con-
verges to 5. Could some other subsequence converge to 6? To 4? Explain
your answers.
2. Show that if {xn} has a subsequence {xnk} that converges to 5, then
lim inf xn ≤5 ≤lim sup xn.
3. Show that if lim sup xn = ∞, then there is a subsequence {xnk} with
xnk →∞.
More on the “sup-sequence.” The following problems explore further the cor-
respondence between the original sequence {xn} and the “sup-sequence” {vn}.
We can ask, for instance, about “inverting” this correspondence.
1. For each of the following sequences {vn}, ﬁnd (if possible) two different
sequences {xn} that give the same sup-sequence {vn}.
(a) {vn} =

(c) {vn} = {2, 1.1, 1.01, 1.001, 1.0001, . . .}
2. For which sequences {vn} can there be more than one associated sequence
{xn}? State and prove a claim.

CHAPTER 3
Limits and Continuity
3.1
Limits of Functions
This chapter is about continuous functions and their properties. As a foretaste,
consider this reasonable-sounding claim about a function f:
If f(−1) = −2 and f(1) = 5, then f(a) = 0 for some a ∈(−1, 1).
Is this true? If a graph passes through the points (−1, −2) and (1, 5), must it
also cross the x-axis somewhere in between? Must there also be an input b with
f(b) = π?
Both answers turn out to be “yes”—if the function f is continuous every-
where along the input interval [−1, 1]. In this case, answers follow from the
famous intermediate value theorem, which we will carefully state and prove later
in this chapter. To prove such results we’ll draw on earlier work with complete-

ness, suprema and inﬁma, limits, the Bolzano–Weierstrass theorem, and more.
Our work starts, as usual, with clear deﬁnitions of words like “limit” (as applied
to functions) and “continuous.”
Deﬁning Limits of Functions
Most of us emerge from elementary calculus courses with a rough and ready view
of function limits. To say that limx→3 f(x) = 5, for example, means something
like
f(x) approaches 5 as x approaches 3, or f(x) ≈5 when x ≈3.
These views are not incorrect, but they are too vague to be useful for building
theory or proving theorems. What exactly does “approaches” mean? How close
to 3 must x be for x ≈3 to hold? We need a precise deﬁnition.
Deﬁnition 3.1 (Limit of a function). Let f be a function whose domain includes
an open interval I containing a, except perhaps for x = a. Let L be a number.
We write limx→a f(x) = L if, for every ǫ > 0, there exists δ > 0 such that
|f(x) −L| < ǫ
whenever x ∈I and 0 < |x −a| < δ.

3. Limits and Continuity
Observe, right away, two important subtleties about domains:
• At x = a: The value f(a) itself need not be deﬁned for the limit to exist at
x = a. Indeed, the whole point of ﬁnding such a limit is often to do with a
“missing” or mysterious function value. If f(a) is deﬁned, that’s ﬁne, but
it’s irrelevant to the deﬁnition, which avoids all mention of f(a).
• Near x = a: For the key ǫ–δ condition to make good sense—let alone hold
true—f(x) must be deﬁned for all x (other than a) that are within δ of
a. We will sometimes summarize these conditions by requiring that the
domain of f include some set of the form I \ {a}, where I is any open
interval containing a.
EXAMPLE 1.
Let f(x) = (3x2 −3)/(x −1). Use Deﬁnition 3.1 to show that
limx→1 f(x) = 6.
SOLUTION.
Note ﬁrst that all is well with domains: f(1) is undeﬁned, but f(x)
makes good sense for all other x. Next, for x ̸= 1 we have
f(x) = 3x2 −3
x −1
= 3(x −1)(x + 1)
x −1
= 3x + 3,
and so
|f(x) −6| = |3x + 3 −6| = |3x −3| = 3 |x −1| .
Thus,
3 |x −1| < ǫ
⇐⇒
|x −1| < ǫ
3.
This shows that δ = ǫ/3 “works” for any given ǫ, and we’re ready for the brief
formal proof.
Let ǫ > 0 be given, and set δ = ǫ/3. This δ works, because if 0 < |x−1| < δ,
then
|f(x) −6| =

3x2 −3
x −1
−6
 = 3 |x −1| < 3δ = ǫ,
where we used factoring in the second equality.
Note that the preceding paragraph stands on its own as a proof—the discussion
beforehand is there “only” for motivation.
♦
EXAMPLE 2.
Let a and k be any constants. It is no surprise that
lim
x→a x = a
and
lim
x→a k = k,
but how do these facts follow from Deﬁnition 3.1?

SOLUTION.
With f(x) = x for the ﬁrst limit f(x) = k for the second, verifying
Deﬁnition 3.1 is an easy exercise.
♦
Picturing limits. Function limits can be understood graphically. For any given ǫ
and δ, we can look at the tiny rectangular “window” in the xy-plane, centered at
(a, L), in which L −ǫ < y < L + ǫ and a −δ < x < a + δ. This window has
“half-height” ǫ and “half-width” δ; two possibilities are shown in Figure 3.1.
From this viewpoint, the ǫ–δ condition is satisﬁed if the graph of f stays
inside this rectangle all the way from left to right, as in Figure 3.1(a). If the graph
“escapes” at top or bottom, as in Figure 3.1(b), the chosen δ does not work for the
given ǫ. The limit is L if, for any choice of ǫ (the half-height), there exists some
good half-width δ.
EXAMPLE 3.
The function
f(x) =
(
1
if x ∈Q
0
if x /∈Q
is called the characteristic function of the set Q. Does limx→0 f(x) exist?
It is useful in illustrating “bad”
behavior; we’ll see it again. Can
you picture the graph?
SOLUTION.
The (unsurprising) answer is no. To prove this formally, suppose
toward contradiction that L is a limit, and set ǫ = 0.001. By our assumption,
there must be some δ > 0 with
|f(x) −L| < 0.001
whenever
x ∈(−δ, δ).
But (as we’ve shown) every interval (−δ, δ) contains both rational and irrational
numbers. If s is such a rational and t an irrational, then both
|f(s) −L| = |1 −L| < 0.001
and
|f(t) −L| = |0 −L| < 0.001,

152
3. Limits and Continuity
which is clearly absurd.
♦
The next example illustrates what can—and cannot—be inferred from the ex-
istence of a limit.
EXAMPLE 4.
Let f be a function for which limx→a f(x) > 0. Must f(x) > 0
also hold for x near a? What can be said about another continuous function g if
limx→a g(x) = 0?
SOLUTION.
Concerning f, the answer is yes—except at x = a, where we know
nothing. To see why, suppose limx→a f(x) = L > 0, and set ǫ = L/2. By
deﬁnition of the limit, there is some δ > 0 that “works” for this ǫ in the sense that
|f(x) −L| < L
2
whenever
0 < |x −a| < δ.
Rewriting these inequalities gives
f(x) > L
2 > 0
whenever
x ∈(a −δ, a + δ)
and
x ̸= a,
as desired.
Concerning g, the answer is “not much.” Near x = a the function g could be
positive (if, say, g(x) = (x −a)2) or negative (if, say, g(x) = −(x −a)2). Or
perhaps g(x) = x −a, which changes sign at x = a.

Basic Properties of Limits
Limits of functions have a lot in common with limits of sequences. This is hardly
surprising—sequences are functions, after all—but it’s a good thing, because
most of our hard work with sequence limits will transfer readily to function limits.
It is easy to prove, for instance, that function limits have the same nice algebraic
properties that sequence limits enjoy. The following technical lemma helps clarify
Limits respect sums, products,
quotients, etc.
the connection.
Lemma 3.2. Let f(x) be deﬁned on I \ {a}, where I is an open interval contain-
ing a, and let L be a number. The following are equivalent:
(i) limn→∞f(xn) = L for every sequence {xn} ⊂I \ {a} with xn →a.
(ii) limx→a f(x) = L
Proof: To show that (i) implies (ii), let’s assume that (ii) fails and construct a
sequence {xn} that violates (i).
Let’s prove the contrapositive, in
other words.

3.1. Limits of Functions
153
For (ii) to fail means that there is some positive ǫ, say ǫ0, for which no δ > 0
works. In particular, δ = 1 fails, so there must be some x1 in I \ {a} such that
0 < |x1 −a| < 1
but
|f(x1) −L| ≥ǫ0.
Because δ = 1/2 also fails, there is some x2 with
0 < |x2 −a| < 1/2
but
|f(x2) −L| ≥ǫ0.
Continuing in this way, we construct a sequence {xn} of points in I \ {a} such
that, for each n,
0 < |xn −a| < 1
n
but
|f(xn) −L| ≥ǫ0.
In particular, {f(xn)} does not converge to L. On the other hand, {xn} converges
to a; the squeeze principle assures this because
a −1
n < xn < a + 1
n
for all n. Thus our sequence {xn} violates (i), as desired, and we’ve shown that
(i) =⇒(ii).
Showing (ii) =⇒(i) is easier; we’ll leave it as an exercise.
□
Lemma 3.2 lets us exploit earlier work with sequences to ﬁnd, without much
effort, a lot of function limits that would be tedious or difﬁcult to handle from
scratch.
EXAMPLE 5.
Let f(x) = (3x2 + 5x + 2)/(2x −7). Use Lemma 3.2 to prove
that limx→5 f(x) = 102
3 .
SOLUTION.
Proving such a thing straight from the ǫ–δ deﬁnition could get ugly.
With Lemma 3.2, it is easy.
To get started, let {xn} be any sequence with xn →5. By Lemma 3.2, it is
enough to show that
lim
n→∞f(xn) = lim
n→∞
3x2
n + 5xn + 2
2xn −7
= 102
3 .
This, in turn, follows from different parts of Theorem 2.5, page 96, which allows
algebraic combinations like the following for limits of sequences:
No worries here about zero
denominators.
lim
n→∞
3x2
n + 5xn + 2
2xn −7
= 3(lim xn)2 + 5(lim xn) + 2
2(lim xn) −7
= 3 · 52 + 5 · 5 + 2
2 · 5 −7
= 102
3 ,
as claimed.

3. Limits and Continuity
New function limits from old. The following theorem does for functions what
Theorem 2.5, page 96, does for sequences.
Theorem 3.3 (Algebra with limits). Let f(x) and g(x) be deﬁned for all inputs x
in I \ {a}, where I is any open interval containing a, and suppose that
lim
x→a f(x) = L
and
lim
x→a g(x) = M.
Then
lim
x→a (f(x) ± g(x)) = lim
x→a f(x) ± lim
x→a g(x) = L ± M;
lim
x→a (f(x) · g(x)) = lim
x→a f(x) · lim
x→a g(x) = L · M;
lim
x→a
f(x)
g(x) = limx→a f(x)
limx→a g(x)
if M ̸= 0.
Observe:
• Existence: Theorem 3.3 is more than a recipe for calculating new limits
from old; it is also a guarantee that various limits (those on the left of each
equation) actually exist. In the case of quotients, for existence, one might
reasonably worry about small or vanishing denominators; Theorem 3.3 as-
sures us that all is well if M ̸= 0.
• Something to combine: The how-to-combine-limits rules in Theorem 3.3
aren’t much good until we have some already-proved basic limits to com-
bine. The good news is that a few very, very basic limits, such as
lim
x→a x = a
and
lim
x→a k = k
go a long way. Applying Theorem 3.3, repeatedly as necessary, lets us cal-
We addressed these in
Example 2.
culate limits like these without too much effort:
lim
x→5
3x2 + 5x + 2
2x −7
= 3 · 52 + 5 · 5 + 2
2 · 5 −7
= 34;
lim
x→5
317x2 −5 x+2
x+3
42.075 −x5
=
317 · 52 −5 5+2
5+3
42.075 −55
≈0.5117.
(We calculated the ﬁrst limit, a bit differently, in Example 5.)
Proof: All parts of Theorem 3.3 follow easily when we combine the analogous
results for sequences (Theorem 2.5, page 96) with Lemma 3.2, above. Concerning
products, for instance, we consider any sequence {xn} in I \ {a}. By hypothesis,
the new sequences {f(xn)} and {g(xn)} converge to L and M, respectively.
By Theorem 2.5, the product sequence {f(xn)g(xn)} converges to LM, and
Lemma 3.2 assures us that limx→a f(x)g(x) = LM, too. The remaining parts
are similar.
□

3.1. Limits of Functions
155
Squeezing functions. A squeeze principle works for function limits. We’ve al-
ready proved the sequence version (Theorem 2.6, page 99):
Proposition 3.4 (The squeeze principle). Let f(x), g(x), and h(x) be deﬁned
for all inputs x in I \ {a}, where I is an open interval containing a, and suppose
that
f(x) ≤g(x) ≤h(x)
for all x ∈I \ {a}.
If limx→a f(x) = L and limx→a h(x) = L, then limx→a g(x) = L, too.
The proof, like that of Theorem 3.3, amounts to combining the sequence version
with Lemma 3.2. We’ll leave that to the exercises.
The limit-squeezing idea is simple. The tricky bit in practice is to ﬁnd helpful
squeezing inequalities.
EXAMPLE 6.
Squeeze something to ﬁnd limx→0 x sin(1/x) and limx→0 sin x
x .
Plotting these functions might
be useful.
SOLUTION.
The fact that |x sin(1/x)| ≤|x| for all x ̸= 0 suggests a simple
squeezing inequality:
−|x| ≤x sin
 1
x

≤|x|.
Clearly, ±|x| →0 as x →0, so the middle quantity tends to zero, too.
Finding a good squeezing inequality for the second limit takes more effort.
Here is one possibility:
cos x ≤sin x
x
≤
1
cos x
if x ∈(−1, 1)
and
x ̸= 0.
This does the job: Since cos x →1 as x →0, the left- and right-hand functions
tend to 1, and hence so does the middle function. The squeezing inequality needs
proof too, of course; we’ll leave that to the exercises to avoid distraction.
♦
Beyond Vanilla: More Limit Flavors
We’ll ﬁnd uses for several variations on the basic limit theme discussed above.
Here are some samples of limits at inﬁnity and inﬁnite limits:
lim
x→∞
4x + 3
2x + 1 = 2;
lim
x→0
1
x2 = ∞;
lim
x→−∞
 x2 −x3
= ∞.
Here are some one-sided limits:
lim
x→0+ ln x = −∞;
lim
x→0+
x
1 + √x = 0;
lim
x→3−
x −3
|3 −x| = −1.
Following are several formal deﬁnitions; we leave some others, all in the same
spirit, as exercises. As with Deﬁnition 3.1, each part here involves some technical
assumption about domains, needed to ensure that the key inequalities make sense.
Familiar functions from calculus
seldom cause trouble on this
score.

156
3. Limits and Continuity
Deﬁnition 3.5 (Variant limits).
Let f be a function and let a and L be real num-
bers.
• Right-hand limit: Let f(x) be deﬁned for all inputs x in some open interval
I = (a, b). We say limx→a+ f(x) = L if, for every ǫ > 0, there exists
δ > 0 such that
|f(x) −L| < ǫ
whenever x ∈I and a < x < a + δ.
• Left-hand inﬁnite limit: Let f(x) be deﬁned for all inputs x in some open
interval I = (b, a). We say limx→a−f(x) = −∞if, for every M > 0,
there exists δ > 0 such that
f(x) < −M
whenever x ∈I and a −δ < x < a.
• Limit at inﬁnity: Let f(x) be deﬁned for all inputs x in some open interval
I = (b, ∞). We say limx→∞f(x) = L if, for every ǫ > 0, there exists
N > 0 such that
|f(x) −L| < ǫ
whenever x ∈I and x > N.
• Inﬁnite (two-sided) limit: Let f(x) be deﬁned for all inputs x in an open
interval I containing a, except perhaps at x = a. We say limx→a f(x) = ∞
if, for every M > 0, there exists δ > 0 such that
f(x) > M
whenever x ∈I and 0 < |x −a| < δ.
• Inﬁnite limit at inﬁnity: Let f(x) be deﬁned for all inputs x in some open
interval I = (b, ∞). We say limx→∞f(x) = ∞if, for every M > 0, there
exists N > 0 such that
f(x) > M
whenever
x > N.
EXAMPLE 7.
Prove these limit claims:
(a) lim
x→∞
1
x = 0;
(b) lim
x→∞
3x + 2
x + 5 = 3;
(c)
lim
x→0+
2x
1 + √x = 0.
SOLUTION.
Note ﬁrst that the functions in all three limits are ﬁne as regards
domains. The ﬁrst is deﬁned for x > 0, the second for x > −5, and the third for
x ≥0.
Limits (a) and (b) have close analogues for sequences—limn→∞1
n = 0 and
limn→∞(3n + 2)/(n + 5) = 3—and the proofs for functions are almost identical
to those for sequences. For (b), for instance, we proved the sequence version in

3.1. Limits of Functions
157
Example 2, page 85, and the function version is almost the same. First, we see
that for any positive ǫ,

3x + 2
x + 5 −3
 =

3x + 2 −3(x + 5)
x + 5
 =
13
x + 5.
(It is OK to drop the absolute value because x + 5 > 0 certainly holds for the
large positive x in which we’re interested.) Now
13
x + 5 < ǫ ⇐⇒13
ǫ −5 < x,
and so for any given ǫ > 0 we can set M = 13/ǫ. This M works in the appropriate
deﬁnition, because if x > M, then (skipping some details from just above)

3x + 2
x + 5 −3
 =
13
x + 5 < 13
M = ǫ,
as desired. Limit (a) is left to you.
For (c), only positive x matter, and so

2x
1 + √x −0
 =
2x
1 + √x < 2x < ǫ
⇐⇒
x < ǫ
2.
Thus, for given ǫ > 0 the value δ = ǫ/2 works: if 0 < x < δ, then

2x
1 + √x −0
 =< 2x < 2δ = ǫ,
as the deﬁnition requires.
♦
All in the limit family. All of these limit variants are close kin to each other. Limits
at inﬁnity, for instance, are one-sided in the sense that ∞is approachable only
from below, and −∞only from above. The following proposition makes some of
Similar results apply to limits
that involve −∞.
this kinship explicit:
Proposition 3.6. Let a and L be ﬁnite numbers, and f a function.
(i) limx→a f(x) = L if and only if limx→a+ f(x) = limx→a−f(x) = L.
(ii) limx→∞f(x) = L if and only if limx→0+ f
  1
x

= L.
(iii) limx→∞f(x) = ∞if and only if limx→∞
1
f(x) = 0.
Observe, especially, what the proposition says about existence: if the limits on
either side of “if and only if” exist, then so must the limits on the other side.
We will leave formal proofs to the exercises, but illustrate the idea of (i) with an
example.

g(x) =
(
x/2
if x < 0,
2x sin(1/x)
if x > 0.
Show that limx→0 g(x) = 0.
SOLUTION.
Let ǫ > 0 be given; we need a δ > 0 that works for ǫ. Because of
g’s peculiar two-sided nature, we’ll ﬁrst ﬁnd positive numbers δleft and δright that
work for ǫ on the left and on the right of zero, respectively.
Here “right” and “left” mean
x > 0 and x < 0, respectively.
Matters are simplest on the left. There g(x) = x/2, and so
|g(x) −0| =
x
2
 < ǫ
⇐⇒
|x| < 2ǫ,
which means that δleft = 2ǫ works (and also that limx→0−g(x) = 0). On the
right, we have g(x) = 2x sin(1/x), and so
|g(x) −0| = |2x sin(1/x)| ≤|2x| < ǫ
⇐⇒
|x| < ǫ
2,
which means that δright = ǫ/2 works (and that limx→0+ g(x) = 0).
Combining these results means that |g(x) −0| < ǫ holds for all nonzero x in
the asymmetric interval
(−δleft, δright) = (−ǫ/2, 2ǫ).
Obviously, |g(x) −0| < ǫ also holds for nonzero x in the (smaller) symmetric
interval (−δleft, δleft). This means that δ = δleft = ǫ/2 works for ǫ in the desired
limit. We’re done.

More algebra.
These newfangled limits—if ﬁnite—enjoy all of our by-now-
familiar algebraic and squeezing properties. Inﬁnite limits, on the other hand,
need special care.
EXAMPLE 9.
Find and prove (or re-prove) these limits:
lim
x→∞
1
x + √x + 3;
lim
x→∞
3x + 2
x + 5 ;
lim
x→∞x2 −1000x;
lim
x→∞
p
x2 + 2x −x.
SOLUTION.
The ﬁrst limit yields to squeezing. For all x > 0, we have
0 <
1
x + √x + 3 < 1
x;
since limx→∞1
x = 0, we must have limx→∞1/(x + √x + 3) = 0, too.
We found the second limit from scratch in Example 7. With algebra we can
reduce the limit to something simpler (also handled in Example 7):
lim
x→∞
3x + 2
x + 5 = lim
x→∞
3 + 2/x
1 + 5/x = 3 + 2 lim 1/x
1 + 5 lim 1/x = 3 + 0
1 + 0.
The limit limx→∞x2 −1000x involves the difference of two quantities, each
tending to inﬁnity. Which tendency “wins”? It is easy to guess that x2 over-
whelms 1000x for large x, and so, presumably limx→∞x2 −1000x = ∞. Alge-
bra helps conﬁrm this. For any given M > 0, we have
x2 −1000x = x(x −1000) > M
if x > M and x ≥1001,
so we can use N = max{M, 1001} in the appropriate deﬁnition.
Check details for yourself.
The function

x2 + 2x−x is another difference of two quantities that diverge
to inﬁnity. Plotting the function or plugging in large values of x suggests that the

(We divided numerator and denominatorby x in the last equality.) This is progress:
to show that limx→∞

Continuous Functions
In everyday use the word “continuous” means something like “unbroken” or
“without gaps.” In elementary calculus, for instance, a continuous function may
be thought of as one whose graph can be drawn without lifting the pencil. Such
views can be useful, but they need sharpening for mathematical purposes. Pen-
cils are not mathematical objects; to get started we need to describe continuity in
Even sharp ones.
mathematical language. Function limits are the key.
Deﬁnition 3.7 (Continuity of a function at a point). Let the function f be deﬁned
for all inputs x in an open interval I containing a. We say f is continuous at x = a
if, for every ǫ > 0, there exists δ > 0 such that
|f(x) −f(a)| < ǫ
whenever x ∈I and
|x −a| < δ.

3.2. Continuous Functions
163
Otherwise, f is discontinuous at x = a.
Observe:
• In terms of limits: All those ǫ’s and δ’s suggest a lurking limit. Sure enough,
the deﬁnition boils down to this:
lim
x→a f(x) = f(a).
In words: The value f(a) is also the limit of f(x) as x approaches a.
• No domain gap allowed: For f to be continuous at a it is necessary—but
not sufﬁcient—that limx→a f(x) exist. Two additional requirements apply:
(i) the value f(a) must exist; (ii) f(a) must be the limit.
• What if a is an endpoint? Is the function f(x) = √x continuous at x = 0?
The answer will turn out to be yes—but note that the deﬁnition above
doesn’t say either way, because f is not deﬁned on any open interval con-
taining x = 0. Later we will treat the case where x = a is an endpoint of a
function’s domain; right now we will stick to the basic version.
• No surprises: Continuity of f at a means, roughly speaking, that f “springs
no surprises” at a: The value f(a) can be inferred from values f(x) for x
near a. In terms of ǫ and δ, the condition is that f(x) stays within ǫ of f(a)
as long as x stays within δ of a.
• Continuity along sequences: Continuous functions play well with sequences.
If f is a function and {xn} a sequence, both deﬁned on an interval I with
a ∈I, and f is continuous at x = a, then
xn →a =⇒f(xn) →f(a).
This fact should sound reasonable in light of the “no surprises” property
just discussed. A formal proof can be based on Lemma 3.2, page 152.
Let’s see some examples and non-examples.
EXAMPLE 1.
Where is the function f(x) = x2 −4x −5

continuous? Can any
discontinuities be “ﬁxed”?
SOLUTION.
The live question for any given a is whether
lim

= a2 −4a −5
a2 −25
= f(a).

a = ±5, where the denominator vanishes. So f is continuous at all a ̸= ±5.
What if a = ±5? The short answer is that f is discontinuous at both points,
because both f(5) and f(−5) are undeﬁned. On the other hand, factoring gives
f(x) = (x −5)(x + 1)
(x −5)(x + 5) = x + 1
x + 5
for x ̸= ±5, from which it is easy to see (or prove, but we won’t bother) that
lim
x→5 f(x) = 6
10,
but
lim
x→−5 f(x) does not exist.
This means, in turn, that we can make f continuous at a = 5 by deﬁning f(5) =
3/5, but that the discontinuity at a = −5 is there to stay. A look at the graph of f
suggests the same conclusion.

because limx→0 sign(x) does not exist. But the sign function is continuous at all
a ̸= 0, because (as the graph also suggests) limx→a sign(x) = ±1 = sign(a).
Formal proofs are straightforward; see the exercises.

3.2. Continuous Functions
165
The function g is stranger, and its graph is much weirder than Figure 3.3
suggests. For example, neither “line” contains any unbroken segment, but each
“line” contains inﬁnitely many points, so densely packed that between any two
points lie inﬁnitely many more.
Bizarre as g seems, it is not hard to show that g is continuous at a = 0 but
discontinuous elsewhere. To show continuity at a = 0, we need to check that
limx→0 g(x) = g(0) = 0. This follows from the squeezing inequality
−|x| ≤g(x) ≤|x|.
Since the left- and right-hand quantities clearly tend to zero, so must g(x).
For a ̸= 0, on the other hand, limx→a g(x) does not exist. One way to prove
this is to consider two sequences {rn} and {pn}, each converging to a, with
rn ∈Q and pn /∈Q for all n. Then we have
Such sequences do exist.
g(rn) = rn →a
while
g(pn) = 0 →0;
thus, limx→a g(x) does not exist, and so g is discontinuous.
♦
Continuity at domain endpoints: use one-sided limits. The domain of f(x) =
√x includes the point 0, but nothing to the left of 0, and so the basic deﬁnition
can’t apply. Still, it seems reasonable to call f continuous at 0, because f(x) =
√x ≈f(0) = 0 for all positive x near 0. The following deﬁnition offers a natural
way out of this mild impasse.
Deﬁnition 3.8 (Continuity at a left endpoint). Suppose that f is deﬁned on an in-
terval I = [a, b), but not on any open interval containing a. We say f is continu-
ous at x = a if, for every ǫ > 0, there exists a number δ > 0 such that
|f(x) −f(a)| < ǫ
whenever x ∈I and
a ≤x < a + δ.
Equivalently, f is continuous at x = a if limx→a+ f(x) = f(a).
The idea for continuity at a right endpoint is essentially the same. In practice,
We leave it to you.
endpoint continuity comes up less often than the standard version—after all, an
interval has only two endpoints, but inﬁnitely many points in between.
EXAMPLE 3.
Check that the function f(x) = √x is continuous at x = 0.
SOLUTION.
We only need to show that limx→0+ √x =

straightforward. For any ǫ > 0, the choice δ = ǫ2 works:

as desired.

3. Limits and Continuity
Continuity on a set. As Examples 1 and 2 illustrate, a function may be con-
tinuous at some points of its domain, and discontinuous elsewhere. Here is the
pertinent deﬁnition:
Deﬁnition 3.9 (Continuity on a set). A function f is continuous on a set S if f is
continuous at each point a ∈S.
We showed in Example 2, for instance, that the strange function g is contin-
uous on the set {0}, but not on any larger set. The sign function, by contrast, is
continuous on the complementary set R \ {0}, and the function f in Example 1
is continuous on R \ {−5, 5}. The function f(x) = √x in Example 3 is continu-
ous on [0, ∞). It is possible to concoct terribly-behaved functions, continuous on
small or strange sets, but continuity is the rule for the familiar functions studied
in calculus.
New Continuous Functions from Old
As we’ve already done with limits, sequences, and other objects, we can combine
“old” functions in various ways to produce new ones. We will show, next, that
combining continuous ingredients usually produces continuous results.
Elementary functions. The standard functions of calculus have formulas, such as
exp(x2 + 5x + sin x),
sin
cos x
x

,
and
arctan

ln
 cos x
3x + 1

.
Such functions—even the nasty ones—are called elementary, because they’re
built up, using composition and algebra, from simpler basic “elements,” like x2,
sin x, and ln x.
Elementary functions come in families. Here are several:
• polynomials: functions of the form p(x) = a0 + a1x+ a2x2 + · · ·+ anxn,
where n is any positive integer and the ai are constants;
• rational functions: functions of the form r(x) = p(x)/q(x), where p and
q are polynomials;
• exponential and trigonometric functions: exp x, sin x, cos x, tan x, sec x,
csc x, cot x.
• inverse functions: logs, inverse trigonometric functions, roots, etc., such as
ln x, arctanx, √x;
• hybrids: functions formed from those above by composition and algebraic
combinations.

3.2. Continuous Functions
167
Are elementary functions continuous? The short answer is yes—but only at
points a where their formulas make good sense. (If a happens to be a domain
endpoint, then continuity is understood in the sense of Deﬁnition 3.8.) In other
words, an elementary function is continuous throughout its natural domain. This
domain condition is often clear at a glance. The middle function above, for in-
stance, is obviously undeﬁned at x = 0, so there’s no hope of continuity there.
The right-hand function, by contrast, has an uglier natural domain—both the arc-
tangent and the log might cause trouble.
Showing continuity of elementary functions, even ugly ones, on their natural
domains is easy once we know that the basic functions (x2, 1/x, sin x, ex, ln x,
etc.) are all continuous on their domains. We address this problem brieﬂy below—
but only brieﬂy to keep focus on our main concerns.
Proposition 3.10. Each of the functions
c(x) = k (any constant),
i(x) = x,
sin x,
arctan x,
ex,
ln x
is continuous on its natural domain.
Continuity of c and i at any input a amounts to nothing more than that limx→a c =
c and limx→a x = a; both claims are very easy to show. Proving continuity of
the remaining functions rigorously takes more effort—starting with clear deﬁni-
tions of these functions. We omit details here, but see the exercises for further
discussion.
Continuous combinations. Now that we have some continuous functions to com-
bine, let’s combine some, both algebraically and with composition.
Proposition 3.11 (Algebraic combinations are continuous). Suppose that func-
tions f and g are continuous at a point a. Then the functions
f ± g,
fg,
and
f
g
are all continuous at a (for f/g we require g(a) ̸= 0).
Proposition 3.12 (Composites are continuous). Suppose g is continuous at a
and f is continuous at b = g(a). Then the composite function f ◦g(x) = f(g(x))
is continuous at x = a.
Proof (s): Proving Proposition 3.11 boils down to verifying algebraic properties
of limits. We’ve done that already; see Theorem 3.3 (page 154) and its proof.
We’ll prove Proposition 3.12 in good ǫ–δ style. For simplicity we’ll assume
The proof involves two δ’s,
chosen one after the other.
that f and g are deﬁned on open intervals about b and a, respectively. To this end,
In other words, a and b are not
domain endpoints.

168
3. Limits and Continuity
let ǫ > 0 be given. Since f is continuous at b, there exists δ1 > 0 such that
|f(y) −f(b)| < ǫ
whenever
|y −b| < δ1.
Similarly, since g is continuous at a and δ1 > 0 there exists a δ2 > 0 so that
|g(x) −b| < δ1
whenever
|x −a| < δ2.
To ﬁnish the proof, note that this δ2 works for the original ǫ > 0:
|x −a| < δ2 =⇒|g(x) −g(a)| < δ1
=⇒|f(g(x)) −f(g(a))| < ǫ,
as desired.
□
We will explore another proof,
using sequences, in the
exercises.
Now we can put the pieces together.
Proposition 3.13 (Elementary functions are continuous). The elementary func-
tions are continuous at all points of their natural domains.
About proofs. The general point is that elementary functions are combinations,
of the types treated in Propositions 3.11 and 3.12, of the continuous functions
discussed in Proposition 3.10. For instance, writing the polynomial p(x) = 3x2+
πx −7 in the form
3x2 + πx −7 = 3 · x · x + π · x −7
shows explicitly that p is built by multiplication and addition from constant func-
tions and the function i(x), both of which are continuous according to Proposi-
tion 3.10.
Continuity of all six basic trigonometric functions on their domains follows
from continuity of the sine function and such identities as
cos x = sin (x + π/2) ;
tan x = sin x
cos x;
sec x =
1
cos x.
In a similar way, the functions
r(x) = 3x2 + 5x −7
x2 −1
and
g(x) = arctan

ln
 cos x
3x + 1

are built up from functions shown (or claimed) to be continuous in Proposi-
tion 3.10. A full proof for all cases would require rigorous deﬁnitions and proofs
of continuity for logarithmic, inverse trigonometric, and other such functions.

Why Continuity Matters: Value Theorems
In the preceding section we deﬁned continuity of functions, and investigated many
examples and a few non-examples. In this section we explore some good-behavior
properties of continuous functions. Most notable are two famous theorems on
“intermediate” and “extreme” values of continuous functions.
Questions of values. Continuity is a form of good behavior, so it’s natural to
wonder what other pleasant properties continuous functions might have. Some
such properties concern output values of a function f. We might reasonably hope,
for instance, that if f(1) = −7 and f(2) = 42, then for any number v between
−7 and 42 (the value v is “intermediate” between f(1) and f(2)) there should
be some input c between 1 and 2 with f(c) = v. The famous intermediate value
theorem (Theorem 3.16 in this section) guarantees that this happy outcome does
indeed occur, provided that f is continuous on the entire interval [1, 2]. In short, a
continuous function f “assumes all intermediate values” between f(1) and f(2).
Put graphically, the claim sounds reasonable: If the graph of f starts at height −7
and ends at height 42, then it must pass through all “intermediate” heights along
the way. A rigorous proof is another matter.
Another value-related question concerns extremes: Must the function f above
achieve smallest and largest values somewhere on the interval [1, 2]? If f happens
to be increasing, there is no question: f(1) = −7 and f(2) = 42 are clearly
the desired “extreme values.” But arbitrary continuous functions can be much
choppier; must every one achieve maximum and minimum values? The famous
extreme value theorem (Theorem 3.17 in this section) says yes—again provided
that f is continuous on the entire interval [1, 2].
Properties of Continuous Functions
Our proofs of the big “value theorems” depend on some basic properties of contin-
uous functions. These properties are of independent interest, offering new insight
into what continuity means.
Sticky inequalities. Our ﬁrst such property says, roughly, that if a continuous
function satisﬁes a strict inequality at a point, then the same inequality holds
(“persists”) for inputs near that point.
We made up the fancy name.
Proposition 3.14 (The Principle of Persistent Inequalities (PoPI)). Let f be con-
tinuous at c and deﬁned on an interval I containing c; let K be any constant. If
f(c) < K then there is some δ > 0 such that
f(x) < K
for all
x ∈(c −δ, c + δ) .
(A similar PoPI holds if f(c) > K.)

Proof: For simplicity, we handle the case where c is not an endpoint of I. The
case where c is an endpoint is similar.
Supposing, then, that f(c) < K, we set ǫ = K −f(c) > 0, and choose δ > 0
according to the deﬁnition of continuity of f at c. This δ satisﬁes our present
claim, because if |x −c| < δ, then
|f(x) −f(c)| < ǫ = K −f(c).
In particular, we have
f(x) −f(c) < K −f(c) =⇒f(x) < K,

Boundedness. What, if anything, does continuity have to do with boundedness
of a function f on an interval I? It is clear from easy examples that a continuous
function f need not be bounded on I, even if I itself is bounded. For instance, the
functions
f(x) = 1
x,
g(x) = 1
x +
1
x −1,
and
h(x) = sin (1/x)
x
are all continuous on I = (0, 1), but f is unbounded above on I, g is unbounded
above and below, and h behaves even worse. As Figure 3.4 suggests, h is un-
bounded both above and below on every interval (0, ǫ). But there’s good news
about continuous functions on closed intervals, and the proof involves an old
friend.
Proposition 3.15. Let f be continuous on the closed and bounded interval [a, b].
Then f is bounded on [a, b]; that is, there exist numbers m and M such that
m ≤f(x) ≤M
for all x ∈[a, b].

174
3. Limits and Continuity
Proof: We will show that any function f with the given properties is bounded
above; the proof for lower bounds is similar. Suppose, toward contradiction, that
f is unbounded above. Because 1 is not an upper bound, there must be some
x1 ∈[a, b] with f(x1) > 1. Because two is also not an upper bound, there is
x2 ∈[a, b] with f(x2) > 2. Continuing this process, we can construct a sequence
x1, x2, x3, . . .
with
f(xn) > n
for all n.
Now the sequence {xn} is bounded and so, by the Bolzano–Weierstrass theorem,
Below by a and above by b.
has a subsequence {xnk} that converges to some limit x0 ∈[a, b].
Here comes our contradiction. Because f is continuous at x0 and xnk →x0,
we must have f (xnk) →f(x0), too. This is impossible: For all k we have
f (xnk) > nk ≥k.
This means that the sequence {f (xnk)} is unbounded, and hence divergent.
□
Proposition 3.15 applies, by the way, to the three functions f, g, and h discussed
above—as long as we restrict domains to closed intervals, such as [0.002, 0.9998],
on which all three functions are continuous. (On this interval, −500 < h(x) <
500, for instance.)
Two Big Theorems
With Propositions 3.14 and 3.15 at the ready we can prove our two main theorems.
Theorem 3.16 (Intermediate value theorem (IVT)). Let f be continuous on [a, b],
with f(a) ̸= f(b); let v be any number between f(a) and f(b) (i.e., f(a) < v <
f(b) or f(b) < v < f(a)). Then there exists c in (a, b) with f(c) = v.
Proof: We discuss the case f(a) < v < f(b); the argument for the case f(b) <
v < f(a) is similar.
Consider the set S = {x ∈[a, b] | f(x) < v}. Because S is nonempty and
a ∈S, for instance.
bounded above, it has a least upper bound—say, c—somewhere in [a, b]. We’ll
By b, for instance.
show that c has all the properties claimed in the theorem.
Our ﬁrst claim is that f(c) ≤v. This is trivial if c ∈S. If c /∈S, then there is
a sequence {sn} of members of S with sn →c. Because f is continuous at c we
must have f(sn) →f(c), and since f(sn) < v for all n it follows that f(c) ≤v.
We see, too, that c ̸= b, since we know f(b) > v.
To complete the proof, we show that f(c) < v is impossible; the PoPI is the
That’s Proposition 3.14,
page 172.
key. Indeed, if f(c) < v holds, then the PoPI says that f(x) < v must also hold
for x in some small interval (c −δ, c + δ). This is absurd—we chose c so that
f(x) ≥v for all x > c. Thus f(c) = v, as desired.
□

3.3. Why Continuity Matters: Value Theorems
175
Theorem 3.17 (Extreme value theorem (EVT)). If f is continuous on [a, b], then
f assumes both a maximum and a minimum value on [a, b]. That is, there exist
xmin and xmax in [a, b] such that
f (xmin) ≤f(x) ≤f (xmax)
for all x ∈[a, b].
Notice especially the important words “assumes,” “maximum,” and “minimum”:
The theorem guarantees that f achieves, not just approaches, biggest and smallest
values on [a, b].
Proof: Consider the output set
We deﬁned “range” in
Section 1.4.
R = range(f) = {f(x) | x ∈[a, b]} .
Proposition 3.15 says that R is a bounded set of real numbers. Since R is also
nonempty, the completeness axiom guarantees the existence of an inﬁmum α and
a supremum β. To ﬁnish the proof, we need only show that α and β are members
of the range. With help—again—from Bolzano and Weierstrass we’ll handle the
case for β.
The case for α is almost
identical.
Recall ﬁrst that, since β = sup(R), there is a sequence {yn} contained in
R with yn →β. (If β ∈R, there is no harm done—we can just take yn = β
for all n.) Now for each yn there is at least one xn in [a, b] with f(xn) = yn.
Choosing any one of these for each n produces a new sequence {xn} such that,
for all n,
a ≤xn ≤b
and
f(xn) = yn.
The sequence {xn} itself need not converge, but the Bolzano–Weierstrass theo-
rem guarantees that some subsequence {xnk} converges, to a limit we’ll call xmax;
clearly, xmax ∈[a, b]. Since f is continuous at xmax and xnk →xmax, we must
have
f (xmax) = lim
k→∞f (xnk) = lim
k→∞ynk = lim
n→∞yn = β,
as claimed.

Bad values. Both the IVT and the EVT may fail, of course, if important hy-
potheses are violated. For example, the function f(x) = 1/x is continuous on the
open interval I = (0, 1), but assumes neither a maximum nor a minimum value
(for different reasons) on I. And the sign function, deﬁned but discontinuous
See Example 2, page 164.
on the closed interval [−10, 10], assumes only one intermediate value between
Which one?
f(−10) = −1 and f(10) = 1. (On the other hand, the sign function does assume
maximum and minimum values.)
Using the Value Theorems
The intermediate and extreme value theorems (IVT and EVT) are essential and
versatile tools for studying continuous functions. We illustrate with several brief
examples.

176
3. Limits and Continuity
Continuous functions map intervals to intervals. If f : I →R is any function
whose domain is an interval, then the range of f can be almost any subset of R.
For a constant function, for example, the range is just one point, while the sine
function has range [−1, 1], and the range of the sign function is the three-point set
Don’t confuse the sine and sign
functions.
{−1, 0, 1}. For continuous functions, the picture is simpler.
Proposition 3.18. If I is an interval and f : I →R is continuous, then the range
of f is either a single point (if f is constant) or an interval.
The range might be an inﬁnite
interval, like R.
Proof: Let J denote the range. Recall what it means to be an interval: if u ∈J
and w ∈J (we might as well assume u < w) and v is any number such that
u < v < w, then we need to show that v ∈J, too. This follows immediately
from the IVT. We know that u = f(a) and w = f(b) for some a and b in I, that f
is continuous on [a, b], and that v is “intermediate” between u and w, and so the
IVT assures that f(c) = v for some c between a and b, as we needed to show. □

function f if f(r) = 0. Thus, p(x) = x2 −1 has roots ±1, q(x) = x2 + 1 has no
real roots, and
s(x) = x5 −15x4 + 85x3 −225x2 + 274x −120
= (x −1)(x −2)(x −3)(x −4)(x −5)
has roots 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. Deciding whether an arbitrary function has any roots, let
alone ﬁnding them, can be challenging, but the IVT offers some encouragement
for a large class of polynomials.
Proposition 3.19. Every polynomial function
p(x) = anxn + an−1xn−1 + · · · + a1x + a0
of odd degree (an ̸= 0 and n is odd) has at least one real root.
About the proof. Every polynomial function is continuous everywhere. If we can
ﬁnd any a and b with p(a) < 0 and p(b) > 0, then the IVT will guarantee that
p(r) = 0 for some root r between a and b. Finding such a and b for an odd-degree
polynomial p(x) is indeed possible, because
lim
x→∞p(x) = ±∞,
while
lim
x→−∞p(x) = ∓∞,
and so p(x) must assume both positive and negative values. If, say, p(x) = x3 −
7x2 + 5x + 3, then p(0) = 3 while p(−1) = −13, so p must have a root in the
interval (−1, 0). We leave a more formal proof to the exercises.

Fixed points. A number a is a ﬁxed point of a function f if f(a) = a. (Equiva-
lently, a is a root of the new function f(x) −x.) As with roots, the IVT can help
assure that ﬁxed points exist.
EXAMPLE 1.
Show that if f : [0, 1] →[0, 1] is continuous on [0, 1], then f has

square window [0, 1] × [0, 1] in the xy-plane. Our problem amounts to showing
that this graph touches or crosses the line y = x at least once. This may seem

obvious, but we want proof, and the IVT will help.
The trick is to look at the new function g(x) = f(x) −x; note that g is also
continuous on [0, 1]. Note also that
(i)
g(0) = f(0) ≥0;
(ii)
g(1) = f(1) −1 ≤0.
If either g(0) = 0 or g(1) = 0, we’re done already, so we may as well assume
that both (i) and (ii) are strict inequalities. In this case, the IVT guarantees that
g(x) = 0 holds for some x ∈(0, 1), as we aimed to show.

Maximum-minimum problems. Many hoary old problems of elementary calculus—
enclose as much area as possible in a rectangular pigpen, one side up against the
barn, with 100 yards of fence—depend implicitly on the EVT. The functions to
be maximized or minimized are typically continuous and deﬁned on closed inter-
vals, and so the EVT guarantees that the desired maximum or minimum exists.
Sometimes the functions and intervals in question are lightly disguised.
EXAMPLE 2.
Suppose a and b are nonnegative numbers with a+b = 3. Is there
a maximum possible value of ab2? Of b/a? If so, what are these values? How is
the EVT involved?
SOLUTION.
If we write b = 3 −a, then it is natural to consider the functions
p(a) = ab2 = a(3 −a)2
and
q(a) = b

and all EVT bets are off. The polynomial function p, by contrast, is continuous
on [0, 3], and so the EVT guarantees that a maximum exists—but gives no clue
how to ﬁnd it. With calculus methods (taboo for now, as we haven’t gotten to

non-calculus strategy.
derivatives) it is easy to show that the maximum value, four, is attained when
a = 1.
♦

178
3. Limits and Continuity
Continuous inverses. Important calculus functions often come in “inverse pairs,”
like
f(x) = ex
and
g(x) = ln x;
f(x) = x2
and
g(x) = √x;
f(x) = tan x
and
g(x) = arctanx.
With due care taken for domains, the inverse relationship means that f(a) = b if
and only if g(b) = a. For the last pair, for instance, we have f(1.2) = tan 1.2 ≈
2.57215, while g(2.57215) = arctan(2.57215) ≈1.2.
It is natural to hope in this situation that if either of f and g is continuous,
then so is its “partner.” (Knowing this might be practically useful—sometimes
it is easier to show directly that one rather than the other is continuous.) The
following proposition addresses this situation.
Proposition 3.20. Let f : I →J and g : J →I be inverse functions, where I
and J are open intervals. If f is continuous on I, then g is continuous on J.
Proof: Since f has an inverse, it must be one-to-one on I, and this leads to a
useful claim:
If f is one-to-one and continuous on an interval I, then f is strictly
monotone on I.
The claim should seem plausible; we’ll leave its proof as an exercise. Assuming
Using the IVT.
the claim, we will handle the case where f is strictly increasing; the case for
decreasing f is similar.
Let b ∈J be given. Then g(b) = a for some a ∈I; note that also f(a) = b.
To see that g is continuous at b, let ǫ > 0 be given. Since I is an open interval
and a ∈I, we may as well assume that the small closed interval [a −ǫ, a + ǫ] is
contained in I. Because f is increasing, we know that f(a −ǫ) < f(a) = b <
If necessary, we can always
take ǫ smaller.
f(a + ǫ). To complete the proof, we now choose any δ > 0 so that
f (a −ǫ) < b −δ < b + δ < f (a + ǫ) .
To see that this δ works for the original ǫ, consider any y in J with
f (a −ǫ) < b −δ < y < b + δ < f (a + ǫ) .
Applying the strictly increasing function g to all parts of this inequality, we get
(a −ǫ) < g (y) < g (b + δ) < (a + ǫ) ,
which is another way of saying that |g(y) −a| < ǫ.

14. The Principle of Persistent Inequalities (Proposition 3.14, page 172), de-
scribes a nice property of continuous functions. Here we investigate two
“one-sided” versions of the PoPI.
A function f satisﬁes the PoPILTV (the “less-than” version of the PoPI) at
x = c if, for every number K with f(c) < K, there exists δ > 0 such that
f(x) < K whenever x ∈(c −δ, c + δ). The PoPIGTV (the “greater-than”
version) is the same, except that the condition f(x) < K is replaced by
f(x) > K.

f satisﬁes both the PoPIGTV and the PoPILTV at x = c.

some open interval centered at c.)

3. Limits and Continuity
3.4
Uniform Continuity
Here’s a deﬁnition with many familiar ingredients—but a new adjective:
Deﬁnition 3.21 (Uniform continuity). Let I ⊆R be an interval and f a function
deﬁned on S. We say f is uniformly continuous on I if for each ǫ > 0 there exists
δ > 0 such that
|f(x) −f(y)| < ǫ
whenever x, y ∈I and
|x −y| < δ.
What’s new here? What’s wrong with ordinary continuity, over which we’ve
worked hard? We’ll address these good questions right after some basic examples.
EXAMPLE 1.
Both f(x) = 3x + 5 and g(x) = x2 are continuous on I = R.
Are they also uniformly continuous on R? Why or why not?
SOLUTION.
The function f is uniformly continuous. For any inputs x and y, we
have
|f(x) −f(y)| = |3x + 5 −3y −5| = 3 |x −y| .
Thus, for any ǫ > 0, the value δ = ǫ/3 does what Deﬁnition 3.21 asks:
|f(x) −f(y)| < ǫ
whenever x, y ∈R and
|x −y| < δ = ǫ
3.
The function g is not uniformly continuous. Showing this takes a little doing,
but it is worthwhile to illustrate key ideas. We’ll do it by setting ǫ = 1 and
showing that no positive δ works. Indeed, let any ﬁxed δ > 0 be given. First
we choose an integer n with 1/n < δ, and set x = n + 1/n and y = n. Then
We showed long ago that this is
possible.
|x −y| = 1/n < δ, but
|g(x) −g(y)| =

−n2 = 2 + 1

Thus, our attempted δ failed, and so would any other.
♦
Uniform vs. ordinary continuity. As Example 1 suggests, uniform continuity is
a strictly stronger property than ordinary continuity. A function that is uniformly
continuous on I is also continuous on I in the ordinary sense, but the converse
is false: A function (like g(x) = x2 on R) may be continuous but not uniformly
continuous on I. Here are two ways to view the difference:
• One δ-size ﬁts all: Ordinary continuity of f on I means that, having ﬁrst
speciﬁed a ∈I and ǫ > 0, we can then choose δ > 0 so that |f(x) −f(a)|
< ǫ whenever x ∈I and |x −a| < δ. In particular, δ may depend both on
ǫ and on a.

In uniform continuity, by contrast, δ may depend on ǫ but not on a. In this
case, |f(x) −f(y)| < ǫ holds for any pair of inputs x and y in I. For
given ǫ, in other words, a single choice of δ works “uniformly” across the
interval I.

f(a). In Section 3.1 we described this condition graphically: For any given

ǫ > 0 we can choose δ > 0 so that the graph of f stays inside the rectangu-
lar “window”
[a −δ, a + δ] × [f(a) −ǫ, f(a) + ǫ]
all the way from left to right, never escaping out the top or bottom. (This
window has dimensions 2δ × 2ǫ.) A function f : I →R is continuous
on I if, at every point of the graph, such a window can be found for every
“half-height” ǫ, no matter how small.
To say that f : I →R is uniformly continuous means, in this language, that
for given ǫ > 0 we can choose some δ > 0 so that a 2δ × 2ǫ window works
at every point of the graph. This perspective suggests what went wrong
with g(x) = x2 in Example 1: as g rises more and more steeply over its
domain, its graph tends more and more to escape from the top or bottom of
a given window. Figure 3.5 gives some idea of the problem.
A function may be uniformly continuous on one set but not on another.
EXAMPLE 2.
The function f(x) = x2 is not uniformly continuous on R. Is f
uniformly continuous on I = [−3, 42]? Is f uniformly continuous on (−2, 17)?

184
3. Limits and Continuity
SOLUTION.
Yes, and yes—and the second yes follows immediately from the
ﬁrst. If any f is uniformly continuous on a set S, then f is automatically uni-
formly continuous on any smaller set S′ ⊂S.
Informally speaking, the ﬁrst “yes” applies because f is “steeper” at x = 42
than anywhere else on I = [−3, 42]. Therefore, any δ that “works” for a given ǫ
at x = 42 will also work elsewhere in I, where the graph is less steep.
Before starting the formal proof, note that for any x and y we have
|f(x) −f(y)| =
x2 −y2 = |x −y| |x + y| .
Now consider the last factor, |x + y|: For x and y in [−3, 42] I we have
|x + y| ≤|x| + |y| ≤42 + 42 = 84.
Putting the pieces together produces a key inequality: |f(x) −f(y)| ≤84 |x −y|
for all x and y in I. This done, we’re ready for our (very short!) formal proof.
Let ǫ > 0 be given. Set δ = ǫ/84. This δ works, since if x, y ∈I and
|x −y| < δ, then
|f(x) −f(y)| = |x −y| |x + y| ≤84 |x −y| < 84δ = ǫ,
as desired.
♦
This section’s main theorem covers several of the preceding examples.
Theorem 3.22. If f is continuous on a closed and bounded interval [a, b], then f
is uniformly continuous on [a, b].
Proof: Let ǫ > 0 be given, and assume, toward contradiction, that no δ > 0
works in the sense of Deﬁnition 3.21. Then δ = 1/n must fail for every positive
integer n. This means that, for each n, there must exist xn and yn in [a, b] such
that
|xn −yn| < 1
n
but
|f(xn) −f(yn)| ≥ǫ.
The two sequences {xn} and {yn} so constructed are obviously bounded; apply-
ing the Bolzano–Weierstrass theorem to {xn} produces a subsequence {xnk} that
converges to some limit x0 ∈[a, b]. Now we extract the same subsequence {ynk}
from {yn}; because
|xnk −ynk| < 1
nk
≤1
k
for all k, we must have both xnk →x0 and ynk →x0.
Now a contradiction looms. Since f is continuous at x0, we must have both
f (xnk) →f(x0)
and
f (ynk) →f(x0).
This is incompatible with our original arrangement that
|f (xnk) −f (ynk)| > ǫ
for all k, and so the proof is done.

3.4. Uniform Continuity
185
Staying close. If uniform continuity seems forbiddingly technical or obscure,
that’s because we worked our way up to it gradually, via ordinary continuity at
points and on sets. In another sense, however, uniform continuity of a function f
on a set S is the cleanest and simplest version possible:
f(x) and f(y) are within ǫ whenever x and y are within δ.
We will exploit this view later, when we study integrals. This basic idea—that
f “preserves closeness”—translates naturally to Cauchy sequences, which are all
about closeness.
Proposition 3.23. If f is uniformly continuous on I and {xn} ⊂I is a Cauchy
sequence, then {f(xn)} is a Cauchy sequence, too.
Proof: Let ǫ > 0 be given. By hypothesis there is some δ > 0 that works in the
sense of uniform continuity of f on I. Because {xn} is a Cauchy sequence, we
can choose N so that
Yes, we mean δ, not ǫ.
|xn −xm| < δ
whenever n > m > N.
Because xn, xm ∈I for all n, our choice of δ implies that
|f(xn) −f(xm)| < ǫ
whenever n > m > N,
as required.
□
EXAMPLE 3.
Let f(x) = 1/x. Use Proposition 3.23 to show that f is not
uniformly continuous on I = (0, ∞). Is f uniformly continuous on [1, ∞)?
SOLUTION.
We could use the deﬁnition to show directly that f is not uniformly
continuous (see the exercises), but using Proposition 3.23 is shorter. We can sim-
ply observe that the sequence {1/n} is contained in I and Cauchy, while the
output sequence {f(xn)} = {n} is surely not Cauchy.
On the interval [1, ∞), by contrast, f is uniformly continuous. To see this,
note that for x, y ∈[1, ∞) we have
|f(x) −f(y)| =

1
x −1
y
 =

y −x
xy
 ≤|y −x| .
This implies that, for any ǫ > 0, the choice δ = ǫ works in the deﬁnition of
uniform continuity.

3. Limits and Continuity
Staying bounded. Let f : I →R be continuous on a bounded interval I. If
I = [a, b] is closed, then the EVT guarantees (among other things) that f is
bounded on I. On an open interval I = (a, b), by contrast, a continuous function
may well be unbounded—as is f(x) = 1/x on (0, 1). But uniformly continuous
functions behave better, as the following proposition shows. The proof involves
ingredients that are familiar by now.
Proposition 3.24. Let I be any bounded interval I, open or closed. If f is uni-
formly continuous on I, then f is bounded on I.
Proof: Suppose toward contradiction that f is unbounded above. (A similar ar-
gument applies if f is unbounded below.) Then we can choose x1, x2, x3, . . . , all
in I, such that
f(x1) > 1,
f(x2) > 2,
f(x3) > 3,
. . . .
By the Bolzano–Weierstrass theorem, some subsequence {xnk} is convergent—
and therefore Cauchy. Now Proposition 3.23 says that the image subsequence
{f (xnk)} is also Cauchy—and therefore bounded. This is impossible, because
we chose the xn such that f (xnk) > nk > k for all k.

(b) Show that the function h(x) = |f(x)| is uniformly continuous on I.
7. Throughout this problem, let f(x) = x2 and ǫ = 1. Since f is continuous

proof.)

R.
11. Let f(x) = x3.

on [−3, 42). (Hint: a3 −b3 = (a −b)(a2 + ab + b2).)
(b) Use Theorem 3.22 and the claim in Problem 8 to show (again) that f
is uniformly continuous on [−3, 42).
12. Show that if f is uniformly continuous on an interval I, then it is also
continuous in the ordinary sense.
13. Assume in both parts that both f and g are uniformly continuous on an
interval I.
(a) Show that f + g is uniformly continuous on I.
(b) Give an example to show that fg need not be uniformly continuous
on I (even though fg is continuous in the ordinary sense).
14. Assume in both parts that both f and g are uniformly continuous on an
interval I.
(a) Show that if I = [a, b] is closed and bounded, then fg is uniformly
continuous on I.
(b) Show that if both f and g are bounded on I, then fg is uniformly
continuous on I. (This is a little harder.)
15. A function f : I →R is called Lipschitz continuous (after a nineteenth-
century German mathematician) on I if, for some constant K, |f(x) −f(y)|
≤K |x −y| holds for all x and y in I. Lipschitz and uniform continuity
are both ‘stronger” versions of ordinary continuity.

continuous on [0, 1]. Show that g is not Lipschitz continuous on [0, 1].
Hint: Let x > 0 and ﬁx y = 0. Show that the ratio in the preceding
part is not bounded in the desired sense.

3.4. Uniform Continuity
189
16. In each part, either use Deﬁnition 3.21 or cite appropriate theorems or
propositions.
(a) f(x) = x3 is not uniformly continuous on R.
(b) g(x) = √x is uniformly continuous on [1, ∞).
(c) h(x) = cos(1/x) is not uniformly continuous on (0, 1).
(d) k(x) = x sin(1/x) is uniformly continuous on (0, 1). (Hint: If we set
k(0) = 0, then k is continuous on [0, 1].)
17. Let f : R →R be a function. The condition
∀ǫ > 0
∃δ > 0
such that
|x −y| < δ =⇒|f(x) −f(y)| < ǫ
deﬁnes uniform continuity of f on R. What does each of the following
conditions say about f on R? Must such an f also be uniformly continuous
on R? If not, give an example.
(a) ∀ǫ > 0 and ∀δ > 0, |x −y| < δ =⇒|f(x) −f(y)| < ǫ.
(b) ∃ǫ > 0 such that ∀δ > 0, |x −y| < δ =⇒|f(x) −f(y)| < ǫ.
(c) ∀ǫ > 0 ∃δ > 1 such that |x −y| < δ =⇒|f(x) −f(y)| < ǫ.
(d) ∀ǫ > 1 ∃δ > 0 such that |x −y| < δ =⇒|f(x) −f(y)| < ǫ.
18. Claim: Suppose f is uniformly continuous on the half-open interval (0, 1].
Then we can “extend f” (i.e., deﬁne f(0)) to be uniformly continuous on
the closed interval [0, 1].
Prove this in two steps:
(a) Set f(0) = limn→∞f (1/n). Explain why this makes sense—i.e.,
explain why the limit exists. (Hint: The sequence 1, 1/2, 1/3, . . . is
Cauchy; apply Proposition 3.23, page 185.)
(b) (This is a little harder.) To show that f is uniformly continuous on
all of [0, 1], let ǫ > 0. Set ǫ′ = ǫ/2, and choose δ > 0 that “works”
for ǫ′ in the deﬁnition of uniform continuity of f on (0, 1]. Show
that this δ works for ǫ in the deﬁnition of uniform continuity of f
on [0, 1]. (Hint: It is enough to show that |f(x) −f(0)| < ǫ when
|x −0| < δ. To do this, choose any n0 such that 0 < 1/n0 < x
and |f(1/n0) −f(0)| < ǫ/2. (Why is this possible?) Then use the
triangle inequality.)

Topology of the Real Numbers
Topology is the mathematical study of objects and properties that stay unchanged
after “continuous” transformations, like stretching and twisting, but may change
after other operations, like cutting or puncturing. Topology might be said, more
picturesquely, to be about pliable, rubber things; geometry, by contrast, is about
rigid, steel things. A topologist, says an old joke, can’t tell a coffee cup from
a bagel, since either shape can be moulded from the other without cutting or
puncturing.
These amusing metaphors only hint at the many mathematical faces of topol-
ogy, some quite abstract. In real analysis, fortunately, topology focuses on con-
crete and familiar objects: individual real numbers (called points), various sets of
real numbers, and relations between sets and points. Seen this way the subject is
called point-set topology; here and in the next section we sample some highlights.
No coffee—but plenty of points and sets. Coffee cups and bagels aren’t seen
in real analysis. As rough analogues, however, consider two open intervals, say
I = (0, 1) and J = (−13, 42). In obvious ways I can be stretched (“dilated”)
and slid (“translated”), without tearing or cutting, to coincide with J, and vice
versa. In this sense I and J are topologically “the same”. The closed interval
K = [0, 1], by contrast, is genuinely “different” from I and J: It contains left and
right endpoints that can’t be created or destroyed by stretching and sliding.
We’ve already seen that closed and open intervals like [0, 1] and (0, 1) have
quite different properties in real analysis. The extreme value theorem, for in-
That’s Theorem 3.17, page 175.
stance, says that every continuous function assumes maximum and minimum val-
ues on [0, 1]. No such guarantee holds on the interval (0, 1); a function continuous
there need not even be bounded. In this sense the sets [0, 1] and (0, 1) are topo-
Consider f(x) = 1/x, for
instance.
logically different.
Individual points can also have differing topological properties with respect
to sets. The points x1 = 0.5 and x2 = 0.6 are both interior to the set [0, 1], and
in this sense “the same”. The point x3 = 1, by contrast, is on the boundary of the
set [0, 1]: every open interval, say (0.999, 1.001) contains points both inside and
outside [0, 1].
Open and closed sets Open and closed sets are the most important objects in
topology. Among open sets, the most familiar are open interval, like (0, 1). We’ve
used open intervals freely throughout this book, and they’re the basis for two more
The word “basis” is used more
formally in a theoretical
development of topology.
general deﬁnitions:
Deﬁnition 3.25. A set U ⊆R is called open if U is the union of any collection of
open intervals. A set A ⊆R is called closed if its complement R \ A is open.
. To begin, some comments and examples.

3.5. Topology of the Real Numbers
191
• R and ∅, open and closed: In these deﬁnitions the cases U = ∅, A = ∅,
U = R, and A = R are all allowable, and the union in the ﬁrst deﬁnition is
allowed to involve any collection—empty, ﬁnite, or inﬁnite—of open inter-
vals. Indeed, the set U = ∅is both open—it’s the union of no intervals at
all—and closed—its complement is one giant interval, R. Taking comple-
ments shows that A = R is also both closed and open.
In one unlovely word, R and ∅
are “clopen”.
• Neighborhoods: An interval (x−ǫ, x+ǫ), with center x and positive radius
ǫ, is called an ǫ-neighborhood of x. The notation Nǫ(x) is convenient when
we want to emphasize the center and radius of such an interval.
• Elbow room: Sets like (0, 1), (0, 1)∪(2, 3), and (0, 1)∪(1, 2)∪(2, 3)∪. . .
are written explicitly as unions of open intervals, and therefore obviously
open by deﬁnition. Whether or not other sets are open may be less obvious,
and the following alternative condition can be useful.
A set U ⊆R is open if and only if for each x ∈U there is some
ǫ > 0 such that Nǫ(x) ⊆U.
We can think of the interval Nǫ(x) as “elbow room.” For each element x,
U holds not just x itself but also tiny left and right “ǫ-elbows” on either
side of x. We see, for instance, that S = (0, 1] is not open: 1 ∈S but
no “right ǫ-elbow” of 1 ﬁts into S. As another example, we see that the
set R \ Z is open: every non-integer, say x = 2.93, has some integer-free
ǫ-neighborhood, say (2.92, 2.94). We see, too, that the set Z is closed.
Here ǫ = 0.01.
• Not open, not closed: Many familiar subsets of R are neither open nor closed.
The sets Q and R \ Q are good examples. We’ve seen that every open in-
terval contains both rationals and irrationals. Equivalently, neither Q nor
R \ Q contains any intervals; clearly, neither can be open.
Some examples will expand on these deﬁnitions and suggest new deﬁnitions,
some of which we pursue in exercises.
EXAMPLE 1.
Can or must a nonempty ﬁnite set S = {s1, s2, s3, . . . , sn} of
numbers be open or closed? What if S = {s1, s2, s3, . . . } is countably inﬁnite?
SOLUTION.
Every ﬁnite set is closed. To see why, suppose without loss of gen-
erality that s1 < s2 < · · · < sn. Now we can write
If not, we can reorder and
rename the elements.
R \ S = (−∞, s1) ∪(s1, s2) ∪(s2, s3) ∪· · · ∪(sn, ∞),
which shows that R \ S is open.
No nonempty ﬁnite or even countably inﬁnite set is open: Open sets are unions
of open intervals, and intervals are uncountable sets.
♦
See Section 1.6 for more on
countability.

192
3. Limits and Continuity
We see in the next example that a countably inﬁnite set may or may not be
closed.
EXAMPLE 2.
Let
S =

and

.
Is either S or T open or closed?
SOLUTION.
Neither S nor T includes any ǫ-neighborhoods at all, so neither S
nor T is open.
In the preceding example we
gave another reason why S and
T can’t be open.
What about complements? Notice ﬁrst that we can write R \ T explicitly as
an (inﬁnite) union of intervals:
R \ T = (−∞, 0) ∪(1, ∞) ∪(1/2, 1) ∪(1/3, 1/2) ∪. . . .
Thus R \ T is open and so T is closed. The set R \ S differs from R \ T in only
one element, 0. But that makes all the difference: No neighborhood Nǫ(0) misses
all points of S, and so R \ S is not open. We conclude that S is neither open nor
closed, and that T is closed but not open.
♦
EXAMPLE 3.
Let U1 and U2 be open sets, and A1 and A2 closed sets. What can
be said about unions and intersections?
SOLUTION.
We’ll see that both U1 ∪U2 and U1 ∩U2 are open; it follows that
Do you see why? De Morgan
can help.
both A1 ∪A2 and A1 ∩A2 are closed.
To see why U1 ∪U2 is open recall that U1 and U2 are themselves unions of
intervals. Thus U1 ∪U2 is itself a union—the union of all the open intervals that
make up either U1 or U2.
To see why U1 ∩U2 is open we use ǫ-neighborhoods. Suppose x ∈U1 ∩U2.
Since x ∈U1 there is some ǫ1 > 0 with x ∈Nǫ1(x) ⊆U1. Similarly, there is
ǫ2 > 0 with x ∈Nǫ2(x) ⊆U2. Then, for ǫ = min{ǫ1, ǫ2} we have Nǫ(x) ⊆
U1 ∩U2.
♦
Example 3 points to more general results:
Proposition 3.26. Unions and intersections of open and closed sets behave topo-
logically as follows:
(a) The union of any collection of open sets is open. The intersection of any ﬁnite
collection of open sets is open.
(b) The intersection of any collection of closed sets is closed. The union of any
ﬁnite collection of closed sets is closed.

3.5. Topology of the Real Numbers
193
Proof: The ﬁrst assertion in (a) can be proved exactly as for unions of two open
sets. We proved the second part in the preceding example. Part (a) implies (b) via
De Morgan’s laws.
□
Topology and sequences. Topology words and ideas are useful in studying se-
quences.
EXAMPLE 4.
Let {an} be any sequence that converges to a, and U any open set
with a ∈U. Then an ∈U for all but ﬁnitely many n.
SOLUTION.
By hypothesis, there is some ǫ > 0 with Nǫ(a) ⊆U. Since an →
a, we can choose N such that an ∈Nǫ(a) for all n > N. So U contains all the
an with at most ﬁnitely many exceptions: a1, a2, . . . , aN.
♦
The preceding example suggests a more general property of closed sets.
We’ve already seen that this
holds for closed intervals.
Fact 3.27. Suppose the set A ⊆R is closed, and that {an} is a sequence with
an ∈A for all n. If an →a, then a ∈A.
Proof: If not, then a ∈R \ A, an open set. Hence, for some ǫ > 0 we have
a ∈Nǫ(a) ⊆R \ A. This means that Nǫ(a) contains none of the an, which
contradicts the claim in Example 4.
□
Limits and limit points. A point a is deﬁned to be a limit point of a set A if every
open neighborhood Nǫ(a) contains at least one element of A other than a.
EXAMPLE 5.
Speciﬁc examples illustrate some of the possibilities.
(a) Let A = (0, 1]. All points of A are limit points. The point a = 0 is also a
limit point of A, even though 0 /∈A. No other point in R is a limit point. For
the point a = 1.001, for example, the neighborhood N0.0001(a) misses the
set A entirely.
(b) Let S =



, as in Example 2. No point of S is a limit point:
every point of S has a (perhaps tiny) ǫ-neighborhood that contains no other
point of S. The point 0, although not in S, is a limit point of S, since every
set Nǫ(0) contains inﬁnitely points of S.
(c) For the set Q of rational numbers, every real number is a limit point.
Some of these points are pursued further in exercises.
♦
As the parts of Example 5 suggest, limit points of a set A, whether or not in A,
can be approximated closely by other points from within A. The analogy with
limits of sequences is no accident:

194
3. Limits and Continuity
Proposition 3.28. A point a is limit point of a set A if and only if a = lim{an}
for some sequence {an} with an ∈A and an ̸= a for all n.
Proofs are left as exercises.
Topology, functions, and continuity. Topological language is also convenient in
describing behavior of functions.
EXAMPLE 6.
Suppose the function f : R →R is continuous everywhere, and b
is any constant. Show that the set U = {x | f(x) < b} is open.
SOLUTION.
If U = ∅we’re done already. If U ̸= ∅we can invoke the Principle
of Persistent Inequalities (PoPI). Suppose, then, that c ∈U, which means f(c) <
The PoPI is Proposition 3.14,
page 172.
b. By the PoPI, there exists δ > 0 such that f(x) < b for x ∈(c −δ, c + δ). But
this is another way of saying that Nδ(c) ⊆U, so indeed U is open.
♦
Inverse images and continuity. Continuity is fundamental in topology, just as in
real analysis. Topological language offers a convenient and general description
based on “inverse images”: For any function f : A →B and any set U ⊆B, the
set
f −1(U) = {a ∈A | f(a) ∈U}
is the inverse image of U.
The notation f−1 has nothing
to do with a reciprocal.
EXAMPLE 7.
Suppose that f : R →R is continuous everywhere, and let U =
(a, b). Explain why f −1(U) is open.
SOLUTION.
We did half the work just above. Unpacking the notation a bit gives
f −1(U) = f −1( (a, b) ) = {x | f(x) < b} ∩{x | f(x) > a}.
Of the last two sets on the right, the ﬁrst is open by Example 6; the second is open
by essentially the same argument. As the intersection of two open sets, f −1(U)
is open, too.
♦
EXAMPLE 8.
Deﬁne f : R →R by f(x) = x2.
(a) If U = (4, 9) then
f −1(U) =

x ∈R | 4 < x2 < 9
	
= (−3, −2) ∪(2, 3),
a union of two open intervals.
(b) If U = (−42, −3) then f −1(U) = ∅, since f(x) ≥0 for all x.

♦
The pattern suggested above—inverse images of open sets are open, and simi-
larly for closed sets—is no accident. Proposition 3.29 gives a brief but general
description of continuity in topological language.
Proposition 3.29 can be used to
deﬁne continuity.
Proposition 3.29. A function f : R →R is continuous on R if and only if f −1(U)
is open whenever U ⊆R is open.
Proof: For the “if” part, ﬁx a ∈R. Indeed, for any ǫ > 0, we can let U be
the open interval (f(a) −ǫ, f(a) + ǫ). Then a ∈f −1(U)—an open set by our
hypothesis—and so there is δ > 0 such that (a−δ, a+δ) ⊆f −1(U). Unraveling
these notations shows that this is just another way of saying that |f(x) −f(a)| <
ǫ when |x −a| < δ. This is precisely the ǫ–δ condition for continuity of f at
x = a, so the “if” part is proved.
Proving the “only if” part is similar. Here’s a sketch: Suppose U ⊆R is open.
Further details are left as an
exercise.
If f −1(U) = ∅, we’re done already. If not, and a ∈f −1(U), then f(a) ∈U, and
since U is open we can choose ǫ > 0 with Nǫ( f(a) ) ⊆U. By continuity of f at
x = a we can choose δ > 0 with Nδ(a) ⊆f −1(U). Hence f −1(U) is open as
claimed.
□
Open intervals are good enough. The condition in Proposition 3.29 can be re-
laxed a little: f is continuous if and only if f −1(I) is open for every open interval
I = (a, b). This is because, roughly speaking, inverse images “play well” with
unions: the inverse image of a union is the corresponding union of inverse images.
See the exercises for more on
this.
R is a “metric space”. A metric space is a set X equipped with a reasonable
notion of distance, known more formally as a metric. In real analysis the absolute
value plays this role: For any numbers x and a, |x −a| is the distance from x to
a, and the inequality |x −a| < ǫ means that x is “within distance ǫ” of a.
The following abstract deﬁnition makes more general sense.
Deﬁnition 3.30. Let X be any set and d : X × X →R a function. We say d is a
metric on X if the following conditions hold for all x, y, and z in X:
(i) d(x, y) ≥0, and d(x, y) = 0 only when x = y (aka, positivity)
(ii) d(x, y) = d(y, x) (aka, symmetry)
(iii) d(x, z) ≤d(x, y) + d(y, z) (aka, triangle inequality)
All parts of the deﬁnition are easy to check in our most familiar case, X = R and
d(x, y) = |x −y|; the metric triangle inequality, in particular, is a long-familiar
property of the absolute value.

196
3. Limits and Continuity
Open balls, open neighborhoods. If d is a metric on a set X, a ∈X and ǫ > 0,
it makes sense to describe the set
Bǫ(a) = {x ∈X | d(x, a) < ǫ}
as the open ball of radius ǫ about x = a. When d(x, y) = |x −y|, this “ball”
is really just an interval of radius ǫ, the set we’ve called an ǫ-neighborhood, and
denoted Nǫ(a). If X is a higher-dimensional set, like R2 or R3, with appropriate
metrics, a “ball” might resemble a disk or a child’s notion of a ball.
Building a metric space. Given any set X and any metric d, we can can create
a useful topology on X—called a metric space topology—by deﬁning open sets
to be unions of open balls. Indeed, we did exactly that earlier in this section: real
open intervals are actually open balls, and so our earlier deﬁnition is in fact the
metric deﬁnition. Metric spaces are in some sense “nice,” and this happy state is
sometimes summarized by saying that R with its “usual” topology is is a metric
space. We explore this idea further in exercises.

Compactness
Compactness is a “nice” topological property enjoyed by certain subsets of R—
e.g., ﬁnite sets, closed and bounded intervals, and convergent sequences—but not
others. We’ve seen, for instance, that a function deﬁned and continuous on a
closed and bounded interval [a, b] assumes maximum and minimum values, while
a function deﬁned and continuous on an open interval need not even be bounded.
Formal deﬁnitions follow soon; here’s a preview.
Almost ﬁnite.
Compact sets need not be ﬁnite. We’ll see, for instance, that the
Finite sets are compact, though.
unit interval [0, 1]—an uncountably inﬁnite set—is compact. On the other hand,
[0, 1] is both bounded and closed, and these properties turn out to be almost as
good as ﬁniteness for some purposes.
EXAMPLE 1.
Following are some properties enjoyed both by ﬁnite sets F ⊂R
and compact sets S ⊂R.
Proofs are given below or are
left to exercises.
(a) If F1 and F2 are ﬁnite, then so are F1 ∪F2 and F1 ∩F2. If S1 and S2 are
compact, then so are S1 ∪S2 and S1 ∩S2.

mum elements.
(c) Every ﬁnite set F is bounded. Every compact set S is bounded.
(d) Every ﬁnite set F is closed. Every compact set S is closed.
(e) Let f : R →R be a continuous function. If F ⊂R is ﬁnite and nonempty,
then f achieves maximum and minimum values on F. If S ⊂R is compact
and nonempty, then f achieves maximum and minimum values on S.
♦
Deﬁnitions. The “open cover” deﬁnition we’ll soon give for compactness looks
awkward at ﬁrst glance. Indeed, other possible deﬁnitions of compactness (we’ll
see one soon) turn out to be equivalent for subsets of R. But the open cover
deﬁnition makes sense in any topological space, and turns out to be useful in and
beyond real analysis.
First, an auxiliary deﬁnition and some basic examples:
Deﬁnition 3.31. Let S ⊆R be any set of real numbers. An open cover of S is
any collection U of open sets that “covers” S—i.e., for each s ∈S there is some
U ∈U with s ∈U. A subcover is any subcollection U′ ⊆U that still covers all
of S; U′ is “proper” if U′ ⊊U.
EXAMPLE 2.
Let S = (0, 2). The open sets
U1 = (1, 2),
U2 = (1/2, 2),
. . . ,
Un = (1/n, 2),
. . .
form an (inﬁnite) open cover of S; we can write U = {U1, U2, . . . }. We don’t
really need all the sets in U to cover S. For instance, the proper but still inﬁnite
subcover
U′ = {U1, U3, U5, . . . }
does the job.
♦
EXAMPLE 3.
Let S be any set of real numbers, and ﬁx ǫ > 0. The collection
U = {Nǫ(s) | s ∈S} completely covers S.
Each point of S gets its own
ǫ-neighborhood.
Whether any proper subcover exists depends on S, and perhaps on ǫ. If, say,
S = Z and ǫ = 0.1, then none of the Nǫ(s) can be omitted. If S = R, on the
other hand, the proper (but still inﬁnite) subcover U′ = {Nǫ(q) | q ∈Q} works.
If S = [0, 1000] and ǫ = 0.1, then we can ﬁnd a ﬁnite subcover, like this one:
It has about 10,000 members.
U′ = {N0.1(x) | x = 0, 0.1, 0.2, . . ., 999.9, 1000}.

3.6. Compactness
201
The same idea works for any bounded set S ⊂R and any ﬁxed ǫ > 0.
♦
We’re ready for that awkward deﬁnition, and some basic examples.
Deﬁnition 3.32. A set S ⊂R is compact if every open cover of S has a ﬁnite
subcover.
EXAMPLE 4.
The empty set ∅is compact. So is every ﬁnite set F ⊂R. The full
set R is not compact.
♦
Proofs are left as exercises.
EXAMPLE 5.
The open interval (0, 2) is not compact. Why?
SOLUTION.
The nested open intervals
U = {(1, 2) , (1/2, 2), (1/3, 2), . . . , (1/n, 2), . . . }
from Example 2 cover (0, 1), but no ﬁnite subcollection sufﬁces: If we stop with
(1/N, 2), then the set (0, 1/N] is left uncovered.
♦
EXAMPLE 6.
Let {an} be any convergent sequence of real numbers, with limit
a. Then the set S = {a, a1, a2, a3, . . . } is compact. The set S′ = {a1, a2, a3, . . . }
need not be compact.
SOLUTION.
Let U be any open cover of S. Since a ∈S there is some open set
Ua in U with a ∈Ua. As we showed in Example 4, page 193, Ua contains all but
(at most) ﬁnitely many of the an. We can cover these outliers, if any, with ﬁnitely
many members of U, say U1, U2, . . . UN. Thus U′ = {Ua, U1, U2, . . . , UN}
works as a ﬁnite subcover. We leave the claim about S′ as an exercise.
♦
Properties of compact sets. Compact subsets of R have various nice properties,
some analogous to those of ﬁnite sets; see Example 1 above. Here are some
proofs.
Proposition 3.33. If S ⊂R is compact then S is (i) closed; and (ii) bounded.
Proof: To prove (i) we check that R \ S is open: For any p ∈R \ S we’ll ﬁnd
a neighborhood of p that’s disjoint from S. To wit, for each ǫ > 0 we deﬁne
Uǫ = {x ∈R | |x −p| > ǫ}. The sets Uǫ form an open cover U of S. By
compactness, some ﬁnite collection Uǫ1, Uǫ2, Uǫ3, . . . , UǫN covers S. If we take
ǫ0 to be the smallest of these ǫ’s, then we see that S ⊆Uǫ0. Thus, the open
There is a smallest one since
our set of ǫ’s is ﬁnite.
interval (p −ǫ0, p + ǫ0) is disjoint from S, as desired.
Proving (ii) is easier. The nested collection
U = {(−1, 1), (−2, 2), (−3, 3), . . . }

202
3. Limits and Continuity
is an open cover of R, and hence also of S. Because S is compact some ﬁnite
subcollection {(−1, 1), (−2, 2), (−3, 3), . . . , (−N, N)} covers S. This means
that −N < s < N for all s ∈S, and so S is bounded.
□
A big theorem. Theorem 3.35 below is a famous result, dating from around 1900.
It fully describes the compact subsets of R in down-to-earth language. We need

just one more technical fact.
Lemma 3.34. Let S ⊂R be compact and A a closed subset of S. Then A is
compact.
Proof: Let U be any open cover of A. Tossing one more open set, R \ A, into U
produces an open cover V of S. By compactness of S, some ﬁnite subcover V′
covers S. Ejecting R \ A from V′ gives the desired ﬁnite subcover of U.
□
Theorem 3.35. (Heine–Borel) A subset S of R is compact if and only if S is
closed and bounded.
Proof: The “only if” part is Proposition 3.33, above.
Now for the “if” part. Although S itself need not be an interval, boundedness

tread carefully.
of S implies that S ⊆[a, b] for some closed interval [a, b]. By Lemma 3.34, it’s
good enough to show that every closed interval [a, b] is compact. We do this for
the closed interval [0, 1]; the case for general [a, b] follows easily. To do this we’ll
And see the exercises.
use the the nested intervals property of the real numbers.
It has to do with completeness;
see Theorem 1.31, page 76.
Suppose then, toward contradiction, that some open cover U of I1 = [0, 1] has
no ﬁnite subcover. Then one or both of [0, 1/2] or [1/2, 1] has no ﬁnite subcover.
Call such an interval I2. Similarly, either the left half or the right half (or both) of
I2 has no ﬁnite subcover; let I3 be such an interval. Continuing this process gives
a nested sequence of closed intervals I1 ⊃I2 ⊃I3 ⊃. . . , with length(In) =
1/2n.
The nested interval property says that the intersection I1 ∩I2 ∩I3 ∩. . . is a
single point, say p. Since p ∈[0, 1] we have p ∈U0 for some U0 ∈U. Since U0
is open, we know p ∈Nǫ(p) ⊆U0 for some ǫ > 0.
Now for any N large enough so 1/2N < ǫ, we have IN ⊆U0. Here comes
our contradiction: IN, which supposedly lacks any ﬁnite subcover from U, is
actually covered by just one set, U0.
□
Compactness revisited: the sequence view. A close cousin of compactness as
deﬁned above is as follows:
Deﬁnition 3.36. A set A ⊆R is called sequentially compact if every inﬁnite
sequence {an} contained in A has a convergent subsequence whose limit is also
in A.

3.6. Compactness
203
The Bolzano–Weierstrass theorem asserts that every closed and bounded interval
Theorem 2.16, page 111
A = [a, b] is sequentially compact. In fact, A need not be an interval:
Proposition 3.37. Every closed and bounded set A ⊂R is sequentially compact.
Proof: Let A be closed and bounded, and {an} a sequence with an ∈A for
all n. The sequence {an} is bounded, so Bolzano–Weierstrass says there’s a
convergent subsequence {ank}; call its limit a. Since A is closed, Fact 3.27,
page 193, guarantees that a ∈A, as desired.
□
The converse holds, too:
Proofs are in exercises.
Proposition 3.38. A sequentially compact set A ⊂R is closed and bounded.
Now we have all the pieces for the big-picture result:
Theorem 3.39. A set A ⊂R is compact if and only if A is sequentially compact.
EXAMPLE 7.
Use sequential compactness to show that if A and B are compact
subsets of R, then A ∩B is compact, too.
SOLUTION.
Let {cn} be any sequence contained in A ∩B. Compactness of
A means that some subsequence {dn} of {cn} converges to a point d ∈A. It
remains to show that d ∈B. Compactness of B implies that some subsequence
of {dn} converges to some point e ∈B. But {dn} is a convergent sequence, so
all subsequences converge to the same limit, d. Thus d = e and we’re done.
♦
Using Compactness
Compact sets have, as claimed earlier, several pleasant properties that “play well”
with continuous functions. Following are three (now) simple but important exam-
ples.
Proposition 3.40. A nonempty compact set K ⊂R has maximum and minimum
elements.
Proof: Since K is bounded, there exist α = inf(K) and β = sup(K). By
Lemma 2.9, page 100, there are sequences {an} and {bn} in K with limits α
and β, respectively. Since K is closed, Fact 3.27, page 193, guarantees that both
α ∈K and β ∈K, as desired.
□
Proposition 3.41. Let f : R →R be a continuous function, and K ⊂R a
compact set. The image set f(K) = {f(x) | x ∈K} is also compact.

Proof: Let’s show that f(K) is sequentially compact. To this end, let {yn} be

f(K).
Since {yn} ⊆f(K), there are x1, x2, x3, ..., all in K, with f(xn) = yn
for all n. By compactness of K the sequence {xn} has a convergent subsequence
{xnk}, with limit x0 ∈K. Setting ynk = f(xnk) for all k, and y0 = f(x0)
produces the sought-after subsequence of {yn}. Continuity of f guarantees that

f(xnk) →f(x0),
as desired.
□
Proposition 3.42. Let f : R →R be continuous, and K ⊂R a nonempty com-
pact set. Then f achieves maximum and minimum values on K.
The extreme value theorem
says the same thing for
compact intervals.
Proof: There is almost nothing to do. By Proposition 3.40, f(K) includes maxi-
mum and minimum values.
□

Suppose K ⊆R is compact and p /∈K. Some point x0 ∈K is
“closest” to p.
SOLUTION.
The function f(x) = |x −p| is everywhere continuous; note that
f(x) > 0 for all x ∈K. Proposition 3.42 says that f achieves a minimum

(a) It’s enough to show R \ S is open. Let p ∈R \ S. We’re done if
Nǫ(p) ⊆R\ S for some ǫ > 0. If not, then (why?) there’s a sequence
{sn} in S with
|s1 −p| < 1,

etc. The sequence {sn} has no convergent subsequence (why?).
5. We said in this section that if [0, 1] is compact, then so is every closed
interval [a, b]. Prove this using Proposition 3.31.

tinuous and K ⊂R is compact, then f is bounded on K—i.e., the set
{f(x) | x ∈K} is bounded.
Prove this by considering the open cover U consisting of sets Ui = {x | f(x) < |i|}
is bounded.
Why are the Ui open? Why do they cover K? How does compactness
help?

4.1
Deﬁning the Derivative
Calculus at last. We’ve worked hard to develop important calculus ingredients:
functions, limits, continuity, etc. At last we are ready to put them together; we’ll
treat derivatives in this chapter and integrals in the next. Many derivative and
integral formulas and calculations are, of course, already familiar from elementary
calculus. The new twist is to derive such “known” facts rigorously, and to put
them in theoretical context.
First comes the key deﬁnition:

exists.
Let’s test it on some familiar well- and ill-behaved functions.
EXAMPLE 1.
Find, if possible, derivatives at a = 3 for the functions
c(x) = 5,
ℓ(x) = 2x + 7,
q(x) = x2,
and
a(x) = |x −3| .
What general facts do the calculations suggest?
SOLUTION.
The limit calculation for c(x) is easy:
c′(3) = lim
x→3
c(x) −c(3)
x −3
= lim
x→3
5 −5
x −3 = 0.
Thus, c′(3) = 0. Since the value x = 3 played no important role in the calcula-
tion, we’d guess (correctly) that c′(a) = 0 for all a.
Finding ℓ′(3) is easy, too:
ℓ′(3) = lim
x→3
ℓ(x) −ℓ(3)
x −3
= lim
x→3
2x + 7 −13
x −3
= lim
x→3
2x −6
x −3 = 2.

4. Derivatives
Thus, ℓ′(3) = 2, and (almost) the same calculation shows that ℓ′(a) = 2 for all
inputs a.
See the exercises.
For q, we need another limit calculation:
Watch for a factoring trick.
q′(3) = lim
x→3
q(x) −q(3)
x −3
= lim
x→3
x2 −9
x −3 = lim
x→3(x + 3) = 6
Thus, q′(3) = 6. This time the calculation looks a bit different away from x = 3,
so we defer (just brieﬂy) ﬁnding q′(x) for other inputs.
The derivative a′(3), if it exists, is the value of
lim
x→3
a(x) −a(3)
x −3

x→3
|x −3|
x −3 = lim
x→3

if x > 3,
−1
if x < 3.
From the last form, we see that a′(3) does not exist.

Left- and right-hand limits do
exist at x = 3, but they are
unequal.

Different Views of the Derivative
The derivative is deﬁned formally as a limit, but it has several familiar and useful
interpretations. We review several brieﬂy.

4.1. Deﬁning the Derivative
209
Average and instantaneous rates. The expression
f(x) −f(a)
x −a
,
known as a difference quotient, can be thought of as the average rate of change of
f(x) with respect to x over the input interval between a and x. The derivative is
the limit of such rates as x approaches a, and so can be seen as the instantaneous
rate of change of f when x = a.
We won’t dwell now on the connection between derivatives and rates. But we
should acknowledge that the idea is among the best and most useful ever had—by
anybody. The power of calculus to describe and predict real-world change, from
falling apples to celestial mechanics, is hard to overstate. As Isaac Newton and
others discovered, calculus is the right “language” in which to express physical
laws and to deduce their consequences.
Slopes. In elementary calculus, f ′(a) is sometimes described simply as the “slope
of the graph” of f at x = a. To be a bit more precise, note that the difference
quotient
f(x) −f(a)
x −a
is the slope of a certain secant line, which passes through the points (x, f(x))
and (a, f(a)) on the graph of f. If the derivative exists, then the limiting value
f ′(a) can also be thought of as a slope, this time of the tangent line to the graph at
x = a. Observe, too, that slope is itself a rate (of ascent, in this case), and hence
a special case of the rate-of-change interpretation discussed above.
Linear approximation. Thinking of derivatives as slopes is simple and helpful,
especially for well-behaved functions. But subtleties can arise. What is really
And deservedly popular in
elementary calculus courses.
meant, for example, by the slope of a curve at a point? What if the graph of f is
not a smooth curve at all, but ragged or broken? To skirt such problems, we can
consider linear functions, for which no such troubles arise.
Deﬁnition 4.2 (Linear approximation). Let f be a function and a a domain point
for which f ′(a) exists. The linear approximation to f at a (also known as the
ﬁrst-order approximation) is the linear function ℓa deﬁned by
ℓa(x) = f(a) + f ′(a)(x −a).
Observe some basic properties of the linear approximation:
• Simplest examples: If f(x) = x2 and a = 2, then
ℓ2(x) = f(2) + f ′(2)(x −2) = 4 + 4(x −2) = −4 + 4x.
If f(x) = x2 and a = 0, then
ℓ0(x) = f(0) + f ′(0)(x −0) = 0 + 0(x −0) = 0.

(b) A stranger tangent line
Figure 4.1. Two views of linear approximation.
• Shared values—up to a point: The functions f and ℓa “agree to ﬁrst order”
at x = a:
f(a) = ℓa(x)
and
f ′(a) = ℓ′
a(a).
(The second fact holds because ℓa, being linear, has constant derivative.)
Away from x = a, anything can happen. In the case of f(x) = x2 and
l3(x) = 9+6(x−3), for example, we have f(−42) = 1764 and f ′(−42) =
−84, while ℓ3(−42) = −261 and ℓ′
3(−42) = 6.
• Graphical views: The close connections between f and ℓa are reﬂected in
their respective graphs. Indeed, the graph of ℓa is in a natural sense the
line that “best ﬁts” the f-graph at x = a. In elementary calculus parlance,
this line is called the tangent line at x = a. The word “tangent” suggests
“touching,” and in many cases this line does indeed “touch but not cross”
the graph of f at the point (a, f(a)), as illustrated in Figure 4.1(a). But in
other cases the graphs of f and ℓa are seriously intertwined, as Figure 4.1(b)
and the following example illustrate. With such possibilities in mind we
will usually refer to “linear approximation” rather than “tangent lines.”
EXAMPLE 3.
Show that the function f : R →R, shown in Figure 4.1(b) and
deﬁned by
f(x) =
(
x2 sin(1/x)
if x ̸= 0,
0
if x = 0,
is differentiable at a = 0. What is the linear approximation there?
SOLUTION.
The limit in question is
f ′(0) = lim
x→0
f(x) −f(0)
x −0
= lim
x→0
x2 sin(1/x)
x −0
= lim
x→0 x sin(1/x),

4.1. Deﬁning the Derivative
211
which we’ve already shown (by squeezing; see Example 6, page 155) to be zero.
Thus f ′(0) = 0, and so the corresponding linear approximation—also visible in
Figure 4.1(b)—is just
ℓ0(x) = f(0) + f ′(0)(x −0) = 0.
The calculation was easy, but the situation is still undeniably strange: The graph
of f crosses its tangent line inﬁnitely often in every open interval (−δ, δ) around
a = 0. In the interval (−.001, .001), for instance, we have f (1/(kπ)) = 0 for all
integers k with |kπ| > 1000.
♦
Magniﬁcation. A useful geometric alternative to the derivative-as-slope view in-
volves magniﬁcation factors. If f ′(a) = m (for magniﬁcation), then for x near a
we have
f(x) −f(a)
x −a
≈m,
or
f(x) −f(a) ≈m(x −a),
which implies, in turn, that
|f(x) −f(a)| ≈|m| |x −a| .
Interpreting absolute values as distances, we see that the distance between outputs
f(x) and f(a) is about |m| times the distance between inputs x and a.
If f(x) = x2, for instance, we have f ′(3) = 6, and f maps the small input
interval (2.95, 3.05) to the output interval (.7025, 9.3025), which is six times as
long.
Derivatives as Functions
For a given function f the derivative f ′(a) depends on a. If, say, f(x) = x2, then,
as we have seen, f ′(a) = 2a holds for every input a, and we might simply write
f ′(x) = 2x. It is natural, in other words, to think of f ′ as a function in its own
right, derived in a special way from f.
Hence the term derivative
function.
To avoid “symbol-creep” it is convenient to use the same input symbol, often
x, for both f and f ′. Thus we might write something like
f ′(x) = lim
t→x
f(t) −f(x)
t −x
when we want to think of both f and f ′ as functions of x. The difference with
earlier versions of the derivative limit is entirely notational—no new mathematics
is involved.
EXAMPLE 4.
If f(x) = √x, what’s f ′(x)? How are the domains of f and f ′
related to each other?

212

SOLUTION.
Let’s calculate. For x > 0, we have

as we learned back in elementary calculus.
No derivative f ′(0) exists in this case. One problem is that f is not deﬁned
on any open interval containing 0, as the deﬁnition requires. Thus f ′ has domain
(0, ∞)—a proper subset of [0, ∞), the domain of f.
♦
Increase, decrease, and derivatives. As elementary calculus experience sug-
gests, properties of the derivative function f ′ reﬂect corresponding properties of
f. Where f ′ is positive, for instance, we expect f to be increasing, and where f ′
takes large positive values, we expect f to be rapidly increasing. These expecta-
tions will turn out to be well-founded, but giving precise proofs is a little trickier
than one might expect. We’ll return to such matters later in this chapter.
Higher Derivatives
The function f ′ may be differentiable in its own right, to produce a new function
f ′′, the second derivative of f. Repeating the process produces higher-order
derivatives f ′′′, f (4), f (5), and so on. If f(x) = x2, for example, then we have
f ′(x) = 2x,
f ′′(x) = 2,
f ′′′(x) = 0 = f (4)(x) = f (5)(x) = . . . .
Higher derivatives, better approximation. The linear (or ﬁrst-order) approxima-
tion ℓa(x) = f(a) + f ′(a)(x −a) “matches” f at x = a in the sense that
f(a) = ℓa(a)
and
f ′(a) = ℓ′
a(a).
Using second derivatives we can go a step further. The quadratic (aka second-
order) approximation to f at x = a is a quadratic function that ﬁts f even more
closely than does ℓa:
f(a) = qa(a)
and
f ′(a) = q′
a(a)
and
f ′′(a) = q′′
a(a).
If, say, f(x) = cos x and a = 0, then we have (as you know from calculus)
f(0) = cos 0 = 1;
f ′(0) = −sin 0 = 0;
f ′′(0) = −cos 0 = −1.
Thus, ℓ0(x) = 1 + 0x = 1, and basic calculus shows that q0(x) = 1 −x2/2
“agrees” with f in the desired sense:
q(0) = 1;
q′
0(0) = 1;
f ′′(0) = −1.

ℓ0. Figure 4.2 doesn’t disappoint.
Properties of Differentiable Functions
Any function f for which f ′(a) exists must be in some sense “nice” at x = a.
The next theorem describes the most basic such form of good behavior.
Differentiability and continuity. A function continuous at a point need not be dif-
ferentiable there. The function h(x) = |x|, for instance, is continuous but not
differentiable at a = 0. (At all other inputs h is both continuous and differen-

similar in Example 1.
tiable.) But the converse assertion is true:
Theorem 4.3 (Differentiability implies continuity). If f is differentiable at a, then
f is also continuous at a.
About the proof. To illustrate the idea, suppose f(3) = 42 and f ′(3) = 7. To
show continuity of f at x = 3, we need to show that limx→3 f(x) = 42, or,
equivalently, that limx→3 ( f(x) −42 ) = 0. The calculation involves a little
trick:
lim
x→3 (f(x) −42 ) = lim
x→3

(x −3) = lim
x→3
f(x) −42

x→3 (x −3)

as desired. The general proof is similar, and left as an exercise.
Digging deeper. The following lemma delves a little further into good-behavior
implications of differentiability.

214
4. Derivatives
Lemma 4.4. Let f be a function deﬁned in an open interval containing x = a,
and suppose f ′(a) exists.
(i) If f ′(a) ̸= 0, then f(x) ̸= f(a) for all x ̸= a in some interval (a−δ, a+ δ).
(ii) If f ′(a) = 0, then—for every ǫ > 0, no matter how small—there exists δ > 0
such that
|f(x) −f(a)| ≤ǫ |x −a|
whenever |x −a| < δ.
(iii) If f has a local minimum or local maximum at x = a, then f ′(a) = 0.
(iv) If f ′(a) > 0, then there exists δ > 0 such that (i) f(x) < f(a) when
a −δ < x < a; and (ii) f(x) > f(a) when a < x < a + δ.
Proof: All parts follow from closer looks at the deﬁning limit:
f ′(a) = lim
x→a
f(x) −f(a)
x −a
.
To prove (i), suppose f ′(a) ̸= 0 and set ǫ = |f ′(a)| > 0. Because the preceding
limit exists, we can choose δ > 0 so that

f(x) −f(a)
x −a
−f ′(a)
 < ǫ = |f ′(a)|
whenever |x −a| < δ. In particular, we must have f(x) ̸= f(a) for all such x;
otherwise the inequality above fails.
See for yourself.
Claim (ii) essentially just restates the existence of the key limit. Because
f ′(a) = 0, we have
0 = lim
x→a
f(x) −f(a)
x −a
= lim
x→a

f(x) −f(a)

By deﬁnition of the limit, for given ǫ > 0 there exists δ > 0 such that, whenever
|x −a| < δ, we have

f(x) −f(a)
x −a
 < ǫ,
or, equivalently,
|f(x) −f(a)| < ǫ |x −a| ,
as claimed.
We’ll sketch a proof of (iii) assuming that f has a local minimum at x = a;
the proof for a local maximum is similar. In this case there is an open interval
Polishing the proof is an
exercise.

EXAMPLE 5.
If f(x) = sin x and g(x) = x −sin x, then f ′(0) = 1 and
g′(0) = 0. What does Lemma 4.4 say about f and g at a = 0?
We’ll prove these things in the
next section.
SOLUTION.
Claim (i), applied to f, says that sin x ̸= sin 0 = 0 for x in
some interval (−δ, δ). This is no surprise—even the big interval (−π, π) works.
Claim (ii), applied to g, says something more interesting. If, say, ǫ = 0.01, then
(ii) says that for x in some interval (−δ, δ),
|x −sin x| ≤0.01 |x| .
Figure 4.3 illustrates graphically what this means—especially about how closely
x approximates sin x near x = 0. The function g shows, ﬁnally, that the converse
to claim (c) is false: Even though g′(0) = 0, g attains neither a maximum nor a
minimum at 0.

Calculus veterans know well how to apply derivative rules (product, quotient,
chain, etc.) in calculations like this one:
Or even worse.

′ = 3x2 cos (3x) + 2x sin (3x) + 4
x.
Our interest here is less in applying the rules—you’ve suffered enough—than
in stating them precisely and proving them rigorously. After all, derivatives are
limits, so algebraic properties of limits—like those in Theorem 3.3—will be key.
Algebraic combinations. We have seen several ways to combine “old” functions
f and g to form new ones. The combinations f + g, f −g, f · g, and f/g are
constructed algebraically, while f ◦g, g ◦f, and f ◦g ◦f ◦g involve composition.
Propositions 3.11 and 3.12 say that if f and g are continuous at the domain points
See page 167.
in question, then so are all the combinations just mentioned.
We do need to avoid division by
zero in combinations like f / g.
We want to show now that similar properties hold for derivatives: if f and
g are differentiable, and due care is taken with domains, then combinations are
differentiable, too. We also expect that derivatives of combinations will be built,
somehow, from derivatives of f and g.
Theorem 4.5 (Derivatives of algebraic combinations). Suppose that f and g are
functions differentiable at a; let C and D be constants. Then the functions
f ± g,
Cf + Dg,
fg,
and
f
g
are all differentiable at a (for f/g we need g(a) ̸= 0), with derivatives as follows:
• Linear combinations: (Cf + Dg)′ (a) = Cf ′(a) + Dg′(a).
• Products: (fg)′ (a) = f ′(a)g(a) + f(a)g′(a).
• Quotients:

.
Notes on the theorem. Proofs follow or are left to the exercises. First, some
informal observations:
• Useful formulas—and more: The theorem not only justiﬁes some well-
loved techniques from elementary calculus but also guarantees that, under
the given hypotheses, all indicated derivatives exist. This existence follows,
as we will see, from corresponding properties of limits.

4. Derivatives
• Sums and constant multiples: Both the sum rule and the constant multiple
rule for derivatives are (easy) special cases of the result for linear combina-
tions. Setting C = D = 1, for instance, gives one of these old favorites.
• Linear combinations and linear transformations: The rule for linear com-
binations can be phrased succinctly in the language of linear algebra: Dif-
ferentiation is a linear transformation from one vector space to another.
(Vectors, in this case, are functions.)
• Approximate thinking: One view of the theorem concerns linear approxi-
mation. By hypothesis, both f and g have linear approximations ℓf,a and
ℓg,a at x = a:
f(x) ≈ℓf,a(x) = f(a) + f ′(a)(x −a);
g(x) ≈ℓg,a(x) = g(a) + g′(a)(x −a).
The theorem tells, in effect, how to combine ℓf,a and ℓg,a to create new
linear approximations to functions like f + g, fg, and f/g. For example,
the linear combination rule says that for x near a we have
Following minor
re-arrangement.
3f(x) + 2g(x) ≈3ℓf,a(x) + 2ℓg,a(x)
= (3f ′(a) + 2g′(a)) (x −a) + 3f(a) + 2g(a),
which should seem reasonable. Still more succinctly, we have ℓ3f+2g,a =
3ℓf,a + 2ℓg,a. The situation for products and quotients is a little more com-
plicated; see the exercises.
Proof: All parts follow from manipulating the limits that deﬁne the derivatives in
question. We treat one part in detail and leave the rest to the exercises.
For products, the theorem claims that
lim
x→a
f(x)g(x) −f(a)g(a)
x −a
= f(a)g′(a) + f ′(a)g(a);
implicit, of course, is the claim that the limit exists. To see why, we manipulate
the difference quotient limit, starting with a clever trick:
add and subtract the same thing
algebra with limits
more limit algebra
lim
x→a
f(x)g(x) −f(a)g(a)
x −a
= lim
x→a
f(x)g(x) −f(a)g(x) + f(a)g(x) −f(a)g(a)
x −a
= lim

= g(a) f ′(a) + f(a)g′(a).

4.2. Calculating Derivatives
221
Note especially the last step, in which we evaluated four limits, of which only one
(the third) is completely trivial. The second and fourth limits deﬁne f ′(a) and
g′(a), which we’ve assumed to exist, and the ﬁrst, limx→a g(x) = g(a), holds
because g is continuous at x = a.

Why? See Theorem 4.3,
page 213.
EXAMPLE 1.
Finding derivatives of polynomials and rational functions, like
p(x) = 3x7 −5x + 2
and
q(x) = 3x7 −5x + 2
x3 −x
,
is easy for calculus veterans. How is Theorem 4.5 involved?
SOLUTION.
Theorem 4.5 guarantees, ﬁrst, that the derivative functions p′(x)
and q′(x) exist. To prove that p(x)—or any polynomial function—is differen-
tiable for all x, we only need to observe that f(x) = x is differentiable, with
Or prove . . . it’s easy.
f ′(x) = 1 for all x. Now Theorem 4.5 implies that power functions like
x · x = x2,
x2 · x = x3,
. . . ,
x41 · x = x42,
. . .
are all differentiable in their own right, and that the familiar derivative formulas
hold for all positive integer powers:
 x2 ′ = 2x,
 x3 ′ = 3x2,
. . .
 x42 ′ = 42x41,
. . . .
(In the exercises, we will discuss two proofs, one by induction.)
We notice, too, that all polynomials are linear combinations of power func-
tions, and so the theorem guarantees that all polynomials have derivatives. The
function q(x)—like every rational function—is a quotient of differentiable func-
tions, and so Theorem 4.5 guarantees differentiability except at roots of the de-
nominator. For q there are three such roots; we will explore this function in more
detail in the exercises.
♦
EXAMPLE 2.
What does Theorem 4.5 say about derivatives of f(x) = (x2+1)15
and g(x) = sin x/ex?
SOLUTION.
The product rule in Theorem 4.5 can help with f(x) if—but only
if—we’re willing to multiply out the 15th power. That is tedious for a human but
no big deal for, say, Mathematica:
(x2+1)15 = x30+15x28+105x26+455x24+1365x22+3003x20+· · ·+15x2+1.
The result is easy, if laborious, to differentiate term by term. A wiser plan involves
the chain rule; see below.

222
4. Derivatives
Differentiating g requires the quotient rule, of course, but ﬁrst we need deriva-
tives of the numerator and the denominator. Although familiar from elementary
calculus, the formulas
( sin x )′ = cos x
and
( ex )′ = ex
are far from obvious, and we’ll defend them below. Assuming them for the mo-
ment, the rest is easy. Since numerator and denominator are differentiable, and the
denominator never vanishes, the quotient function is differentiable, with deriva-
tive

.
♦
Composition and the chain rule. Theorem 4.5 says nothing about functions like
h(x) = sin(x2) and k(x) = sin(sin(sin(ex))), built by composition of differen-
tiable functions. Theorem 4.6 assures us that such composites are indeed differ-
entiable, and describes how the respective derivatives are combined.
As always, due care for
domains is necessary.
Theorem 4.6 (The chain rule). Suppose that g is differentiable at a and f is dif-
ferentiable at b = g(a). Then f ◦g is differentiable at a, and
(f ◦g)′ (a) = f ′(g(a)) · g′(a).
EXAMPLE 3.
The functions f(x) = sin x and g(x) = x2 are differentiable for
all x. Use the chain rule to differentiate
f ◦g(x) = sin(x2)
and
f ◦f ◦g(x) = sin
 sin
 x2
.
SOLUTION.
The chain rule applies directly to f ◦g:
We could substitute x for a, but
why bother?
(f ◦g)′ (a) = f ′(g(a)) · g′(a) = cos(a2) · 2a.
For f ◦f ◦g we have to dig deeper:
(f ◦f ◦g)′ (a) = f ′ (f ◦g(a)) · (f ◦g)′ (a)
= f ′ (f ◦g(a)) · f ′(g(a)) · g′(a);
we used the earlier calculation in the last step. Substituting the formulas for f and
g gives the ﬁnal answer:
(f ◦f ◦g)′ (a) = cos
 sin a2
· cos(a2) · 2a;
the three-fold product represents two uses of the chain rule.
♦
Here, before the proof, are some comments on the chain rule and why it is
plausible.

4.2. Calculating Derivatives
223
• Why multiply? The chain rule says that the derivative of a composition is
a certain product of derivatives. Thinking of derivatives as magniﬁcation
factors suggests why multiplication is the right thing to do. Suppose, say,
We discussed the magniﬁcation
view in the preceding section.
that g′(a) = 2 and f ′(b) = 3. Then “lens” g and “lens” f magnify distances
by factors of 2 and 3, respectively, and so we expect six-fold magniﬁcation
on inputs sent ﬁrst through g and then through f.
Microscopes use the same
principle.
• It works for linear functions: We can just calculate, without fancy proofs,
that the chain rule holds for linear functions f and g. If f(x) = Ax + B
and g(x) = Cx + D, then f ′(x) = A and g′(x) = C for all x, and
f ◦g(x) = Ag(x) + B = A (Cx + D) = ACx + (AD + B) ,
and so
(f ◦g)′ (x) = AC,
as expected.
• It works for nonlinear functions, too: Differentiable functions are closely
approximated by linear functions, and so it is reasonable to hope that dif-
ferentiable functions might satisfy the same chain rule. This turns out to be
true; the formal proof explains why.
Notes on a proof. We’re given that both limits
lim
x→a
g(x) −g(a)
x −a
= g′(a)
and
lim
y→b
f(y) −f(b)
y −b
= f ′(b)
exist, where b = g(a), and we need to prove the related claim
lim
x→b
f(g(x)) −f(g(a))
x −a
= f ′(b) · g′(a) = f ′(g(a)) · g′(a).
First we apply some clever algebra:
f(g(x)) −f(g(a))
x −a
= f(g(x)) −f(g(a))
g(x) −g(a)
· g(x) −g(a)
x −a
= f(y) −f(b)
y −b
· g(x) −g(a)
x −a
,
where y = g(x) and b = g(a). This looks promising. If x →a, then y →b
(because g is continuous at a), and so
lim
x→a
f(g(x)) −f(g(a))
x −a
= lim
y→b
f(y) −f(b)
y −b
· lim
x→a
g(x) −g(a)
x −a
= f ′(b) · g′(a),

224
4. Derivatives
just as we were hoping to show.
This argument works just ﬁne—and shows that the chain rule holds—for most
functions f and g. But one technical ﬂaw needs attention: The key factorization
Look at the ﬁrst denominator on
the right.
lim
x→a
f(g(x)) −f(g(a))
x −a
= lim
x→a
f(g(x)) −f(g(a))
g(x) −g(a)
· lim
x→a
g(x) −g(a)
x −a
makes good sense if, but only if, g(x) ̸= g(a) for all x ̸= a in some interval
containing a. For most functions g, this is the case, but there are exceptions. If g
is constant, for instance, then our factorization is nonsense for all inputs x. But
all is not lost: if g is constant, then f ◦g is also constant, and so, clearly, both
g′(a) = 0
and
(f ◦g)′ (a) = 0,
and the chain rule still holds!
We’re ready for the formal proof. As often happens, a special case takes some
extra effort.
Proof (of the chain rule): We treat two cases separately.
Case 1: g′(a) ̸= 0. In this case, g(x) ̸= g(a) for all x ̸= a in some interval
containing a. We can therefore argue as above to obtain the chain rule.
See Lemma 4.4, page 214.
Case 2: g′(a) = 0. In this special case, we’ll show that (f ◦g)′ (a) = 0—again,
as the chain rule claims. For notational simplicity, let’s assume that a = f(a) = 0.
It makes no difference
mathematically.
Our claim then is that, for any ǫ > 0, we can ﬁnd δ > 0 with

f(g(x))
x
 ≤ǫ
or, equivalently,
|f(g(x))| ≤ǫ |x|
whenever x ∈(−δ, δ).
To see this, let ǫ > 0 be given; we can assume WLOG that ǫ < 1. Note ﬁrst
Challenging values of ǫ are near
zero.
that, because the limit
f ′(0) = lim
x→0
f(x)
x
exists, the function f(x)
x
is bounded for x in some open interval (−δ1, δ1). In
other words, for some M > 0 we have

f(x)
x
 ≤M,
or, equivalently,
|f(x)| ≤M |x|
whenever x ∈(−δ1, δ1). We’ll assume, again WLOG, that M ≥1.
Next, because g′(0) = 0, we can choose δ2 > 0 so that

g(x)
x
 ≤ǫ
M
or, equivalently,
|g(x)| ≤ǫ
M |x|

whenever x ∈(−δ2, δ2). Finally, let δ be the smallest of δ1, δ2, and 1. This δ
“works,” because if |x| < δ, then
|g(x)| < ǫ
M |x| ≤ǫ |x| < ǫδ < δ ≤δ2,
and so
|f (g(x))| < M |g(x)| < M ǫ
M |x| = ǫ |x| .
This proves the chain rule.

Derivatives of Elementary Functions
In Section 3.2, we discussed the “elementary functions” of calculus, built by com-
bining basic function “elements”: power functions, trigonometric functions, ex-
ponential functions, and their inverses. Proposition 3.10, page 167, says that every
such elementary function is continuous throughout its natural domain. A similar
We didn’t prove every detail
rigorously.
claim holds for differentiability:
Proposition 4.7 (Elementary functions are differentiable). Let f be an elemen-
tary function deﬁned on an open interval I containing a. Then f is differentiable
at a.
We’ve already done most of the work. Theorems 4.5 and 4.6 guarantee that a
built-up function like
f(x) = sin
 cos x + ex
ln (2 + x2)

is indeed differentiable (except perhaps at endpoints of its domain), provided
that its basic building blocks—including the sine, cosine, exponential, and log
functions—are all themselves differentiable functions. Proving this rigorously
for every basic elementary function takes some work. That isn’t our top priority,
so we give only some brief samples here.
More details are in the
exercises.
EXAMPLE 4. (Trigonometric derivatives). All six standard trigonometric deriva-
tive formulas follow from two basic limits:

4. Derivatives
SOLUTION.
All the remaining derivative formulas follow from the one formula
(sin x)′ = cos x and from algebraic properties of sines and cosines. For example,
we have
( cos x )′ =

= −sin x;
notice the chain rule implicit in the second equality, and two formulas relating
sines and cosines. Here is another, this time thanks to the quotient rule:
( tan x )′ =
 sin x
cos x
′
= cos2 x + sin2 x
cos2 x
= sec2 x.
To prove that ( sin x )′ = cos x, we’ll use the well-known addition formula
for sines:
sin(x + h) = sin(x) cos(h) + cos(x) sin(h).
This will come in handy as we wrestle with the difference quotient:
( sin(x) )′ = lim
h→0
sin(x + h) −sin(x)
h
= lim
h→0
sin(x) cos(h) + cos(x) sin(h) −sin(x)

Figure 4.4. Derivatives of inverse functions f and g.
Derivatives of inverse functions. One loose end remains untied concerning dif-
ferentiability of elementary functions: handling inverses of differentiable func-
tions. (Logarithmic and exponential functions are inverses, for instance, as are
f(x) = x3 and g(x) =
3√x.) It turns out that inverses of differentiable functions
are indeed differentiable—if the usual care is taken with domains of deﬁnition
and to avoid division by zero. Here is the key result:
Proposition 4.8 (Derivatives of inverse functions). Let f : I →J and g : J →
I be inverse functions, where I and J are open intervals. Suppose f is differen-
tiable at a ∈I and f ′(a) ̸= 0. Then g is differentiable at f(a), and
g′(f(a)) =
1
f ′(a).
Figure 4.4 illustrates the idea.
Notes on a proof. If we assume for the moment that g is differentiable at f(a),
the rest is easy, thanks to the chain rule. By deﬁnition of inverse functions, we
have g(f(x)) = x for all x ∈I. Differentiating both sides gives
g(f(x)) = x =⇒g′(f(x)) · f ′(x) = 1 =⇒g′(f(a)) =
1
f ′(a)
whenever f ′(a) ̸= 0.

228
4. Derivatives
The harder part turns out to be showing what we assumed above: that g′(f(a))
exists. Figure 4.4 makes that assumption look reasonable, but proving it rigor-
ously takes us a bit off our main course. We omit the detour.
EXAMPLE 6. (Differentiating the natural log). Use Proposition 4.8 to differentiate
ln x.
SOLUTION.
If f(x) = ex and g(x) = ln x, then we know f and g are inverses,
and f ′(x) = ex. From Proposition 4.8, we have
g′(f(a)) =

f ′(a),
or
g′(ea)) = 1

Writing b = ea gives the familiar formula g′(b) = ( ln b )′ = 1

The Mean Value Theorem
The mean value theorem (MVT) is a marquee result of real analysis. As the inter-
mediate value theorem (IVT) and the extreme value theorem (EVT) do for con-
tinuous functions, the mean value theorem addresses a natural and fundamental
property of differentiable functions.
Theorem 4.9 (The mean value theorem). Suppose f : [a, b] →R is continuous
on [a, b] and differentiable on (a, b). Then there exists c ∈(a, b) such that
f ′(c) = f(b) −f(a)
b −a
.
Like the IVT and the EVT, the MVT says that a certain function—f ′, this
time—assumes a certain “mean” (or “average”) value. Unexciting as this might
seem, it turns out to be a big deal, with surprisingly broad and deep implications.
We explore several before proving the theorem.
The graphical view. The MVT equation says something about slopes on the
graph of f: At some point c between a and b, the tangent line is parallel to the
secant line joining (a, f(a)) and (b, f(b)). Figure 4.5 illustrates this. The (linear)
secant line function, labeled L(x) in the picture, will play a role in the proof.

4.3. The Mean Value Theorem
231
The horizontal case: Rolle’s theorem. If we add to the other hypotheses the
requirement that f(a) = f(b), then the conclusion takes a slightly simpler form:
Theorem 4.10 (Rolle’s theorem). Suppose f : [a, b] →R is continuous on [a, b]
and differentiable on (a, b), and that f(a) = f(b). Then f ′(c) = 0 for some
c ∈(a, b).

is the car’s average velocity over the time interval [a, b], and f ′(t) is the car’s
instantaneous velocity at time t. At some intermediate time c, says the MVT (and
common sense), these two velocities must be equal. Rolle’s version sounds even
more intuitive: if a car starts and ends at the same position, then it must be stopped
at some instant in between.
When is a function constant? It is obvious, and easy to prove, that a constant
function has zero derivative. The converse—a function with constant zero deriva-
tive is constant—is less obvious than it might seem. For example, the function
s(x) =
(

if x > 0
−1
if x < 0
is nonconstant, but s′(x) = 0 for all x ̸= 0. If we rule out such “disconnected”
domains, the converse is true—but the proof requires the MVT. Here are the de-
tails.

Proposition 4.11. Let I be an open interval and f : I →R a function. If f ′(x) =
0 for all x ∈I, then f is constant on I.
Proof: Let s and t be any two points in I. By the MVT, there is a point c between
s and t for which
f ′(c) = f(s) −f(t)
s −t

Since the left side is zero, so is the right, which means f(s) = f(t), as desired.□
Proving the Mean Value Theorem
Proving the MVT takes some effort—not unexpectedly, given the theorem’s im-
portance and usefulness. Fortunately, we’ve already done most of the hard work.
We’ll argue in three short steps:
• Step 1: Show that if f : [a, b] →R is as hypothesized, and f has a local
maximum or local minimum at c ∈(a, b), then f ′(c) = 0.
• Step 2: Use Step 1—and another famous “value theorem”—to prove Rolle’s
theorem.
• Step 3: Apply Rolle’s theorem in a clever way to deduce the MVT.
About Step 1. Our Step 1 claim should be familiar, for at least two reasons.
First, it lurks behind most of those classic maximum–minimum problems of ele-
mentary calculus. Second, we’ve already proved it (and a bit more), as part (c) of

c ∈(a, b).
To apply Step 1, we invoke the EVT: Because g is continuous on [a, b], it as-

sumes both maximum and minimum values somewhere on that closed interval. If
both the maximum and the minimum are assumed at endpoints, then the maxi-
mum and minimum values are equal, and so g is constant. In this case, g′(c) = 0
for all c ∈(a, b), and we’re done already. The alternative is that at least one of the
maximum and the minimum is attained somewhere in (a, b). In this case Step 1
applies, and again we’re done.
About Step 3. Rolle’s theorem is more than a junior-grade version of the MVT.
With a little ingenuity, the latter can be deduced from the former. The trick is

to apply Rolle’s theorem not to the function f given in the MVT, but to another
function g, cleverly contrived from f. We sketch the argument, leaving details to
the exercises.
1. Let L(x) be the linear function whose graph joins the points (a, f(a)) and
(b, f(b)); see Figure 4.5. Notice some properties of L:
(i) L(a) = f(a); (ii) L(b) = f(b); (iii) L′(x) = f(b) −f(a)
b −a
for all x.
2. If we set g(x) = f(x) −L(x), then g(a) = 0 = g(b). By Rolle’s theorem,
there exists c ∈(a, b) with g′(c) = 0. This c satisﬁes the conclusion of the
MVT, and the proof is complete.
Calculus Friends Revisited: Using the MVT
Standard ideas of elementary calculus link properties of a function f to those of its
derivatives f ′ and f ′′. Using the MVT, we can prove many such facts—and some
but not all of their converses. The following proposition offers some samples.
Proposition 4.12. Suppose that f : I →R is differentiable at all points of an
open interval I.
(i) f ′(x) ≥0 for all x ∈I if and only if f is increasing on I.
f need not be strictly increasing.
(ii) If f ′(x) > 0 for all x ∈I, then f is strictly increasing on I.
(iii) If f ′(x) ̸= 0 for all x ∈I, then f is monotone on I.
Proof (s): For the “only if” part of (i), suppose that f ′(x) ≥0 for all x ∈I. To
show f is increasing, let s and t be in I, with s < t. By the MVT, we have, for
some c between s and t,
f(t) −f(s)
t −s
= f ′(c)
or, equivalently,
f(t) −f(s) = f ′(c)(t −s).

234
4. Derivatives
By hypothesis, the rightmost quantity is nonnegative. This implies that f(t) ≥
f(s), which means that f is increasing, as claimed.
For the “if” part of (i), suppose that f is increasing on I. For any x ∈I, we
have
f ′(x) = lim
t→x
f(t) −f(x)
t −x
= lim
t→x+
f(t) −f(x)

,
where the ﬁrst equality holds by deﬁnition of f ′(x) and the second by a familiar
property of limits. Because f is increasing, we have
See Proposition 3.6, page 157.
f(t) −f(x)
t −x
≥0
for all t ∈I with t > x. Thus f ′(x) is the limit of a nonnegative expression, and
so must itself be nonnegative.
This completes the proof of (i); we leave remaining parts to the exercises. □
Onward and Upward with the MVT
The mean value theorem has many and varied uses. Here we’ll brieﬂy glimpse
two of them.
Darboux’s theorem: derivatives and intermediate values. The intermediate value
says that a continuous function f : I →R deﬁned on an interval I has the “inter-
mediate value property”:
If s and t are in I and f(s) < v < f(t), then f(c) = v for some v
between s and t.
It was widely believed in the nineteenth century that functions with the interme-
diate value property must be continuous.
This is false. In the late 1800s, Jean Gaston Darboux proved (essentially) the
following theorem (a proof, based on the mean value theorem, is outlined in the
exercises):
Theorem 4.13 (Darboux’s theorem). Suppose f : I →R is continuous on [a, b]
and differentiable on (a, b). Then f ′ has the intermediate value property.
Another well-known fact—also proved in exercises—is that a derivative func-
tion (f ′ in the notation above) need not be continuous.
EXAMPLE 1.
Consider the function f(x) = x2 sin(1/x); set f(0) = 0. Discuss
the derivative f ′.

4.3. The Mean Value Theorem
235
SOLUTION.
For x ̸= 0 the function is clearly differentiable; standard derivative
rules apply. At x = 0, the function f is also differentiable, but the derivative f ′ is
discontinuous. Details are explored in the exercises.
♦
Taylor’s theorem: the MVT generalized. The mean value theorem equation can
be rewritten to say that, under the appropriate hypotheses, we have
f(b) = f(a) + f ′(c)(b −a)
for some number c between a and b. This equation can be thought of as saying that
f(b) approximates f(a) with error no larger than the last term. Taylor’s theorem,
dating from around 1700 and named for the Scottish mathematician Brook Taylor,
offers a more powerful version of such an approximation. Here is a special case:
Theorem 4.14 (Taylor’s theorem, n = 3). Suppose f, f ′, f ′′, and f ′′′ all exist
and are continuous on [a, b]. Then, for some input c in [a, b], we have
f(b) = f(a) + f ′(a)(b −a) + f ′′(a)
2
(b −a)2 + f ′′′(c)
6
(b −a)3.
A proof is outlined in the exercises. Here is an application.
EXAMPLE 2.
What does Taylor’s theorem say about f(x) = cos x for a = 0
and b = 1?
SOLUTION.
Applying Taylor’s formula gives
cos 1 = cos(0) −sin(0) · 1 −cos(0)
2
· 12 + sin(c)
6
· 13 = 1 −1
2 + sin(c)
6
.
Now, for c ∈[0, 1] we have sin c ≤sin 1 ≈0.84, so the last summand above
can’t exceed 0.14. This means that cos 1 differs from 0.5 by less than 0.14, which
is easily checked to be true. (In fact, cos 1 ≈0.54.) So Taylor’s theorem might
help us calculate cosines in an emergency.

“shrinks distances.”)

with g′(t1) = 0.
(c) Show that g′(0) = 0 = g′(t1), so there exists t2 in (0, t1) with
g′′(t2) = 0.

Sequences and Series of Functions
In Chapter 2, we studied convergence for a sequence {an} of numbers—under
appropriate conditions, we say that the numbers an converge to another number a.
A sequence {fn} of functions may also converge or diverge to a limit function.
We explore some basic examples before giving formal deﬁnitions.
EXAMPLE 1.
Consider the functions f1(x) = x, f2(x) = x2, f3(x) = x3,
..., fn(x) = xn. Figure 4.7(a) shows graphs of several fn on the interval [0, 1];
Figure 4.7(b) shows one typical function, f20. Does the sequence {fn} converge
to some limit function?

240
4. Derivatives
SOLUTION.
As Figure 4.7(a) hints, the behavior of a sequence {fn} depends
strongly on the domain we specify. Viewed on the interval (0, 0.8), for instance,
the graphs of fn appear to become ﬂatter and ﬂatter, approaching the function
f(x) = 0. At x = 1, on the other hand, we have fn(1) = 1 for all n; graphs of
all the fn pass through the point (1, 1). On the domain interval [0, 1], therefore,
the fn appear to converge—in some sense yet to be deﬁned—to the function
f(x) =
(
0
if 0 ≤x < 1,
1
if x = 1.
We also observe that, although each fn is continuous on [0, 1], the limit function
f is discontinuous at x = 1.

Figure 4.8(a) shows several gn on the domain [−5, 5]; Figure 4.8(b) shows only g20.
Does the sequence {gn} converge to a limit function?
SOLUTION.
The graphs suggest—correctly—that the gn, although wavy for
large n, approach the linear function g(x) = x. The formulas agree—for each
n, the inequality
|gn(x) −g(x)| =

n
holds for all inputs x in [−5, 5], the domain interval shown. By contrast with
the situation in Example 1, moreover, the pictures suggest that the same sort of
convergence occurs on every domain interval.

What the examples show. The examples illustrate that a sequence of functions
may behave quite differently on one domain than on another. On the domain
[0, 1/2], for example, the functions {fn} in Example 1 converge to the zero func-
tion. On the domain [0, 1], too, these functions appear to converge, but to a limit
function that is discontinous at x = 1. On the domain [2, 3], by contrast, the same

easily visualized.
functions become larger and larger with n, and so have no sensible limit func-
tion. The functions {gn} in Example 1, on the other hand, appear to converge to
g(x) = x on every domain interval.
Two Deﬁnitions
Let f1, f2, f3, . . . be a sequence of real-valued functions, all deﬁned on a ﬁxed
interval I. To sort out similarities and differences in the behaviors illustrated in
Examples 1 and 2, we’ll deﬁne two senses in which {fn} might converge to a
limit function f, also deﬁned on I.
Deﬁnition 4.15 (Pointwise convergence). The sequence {fn} converges point-
wise to f on I if, for every ﬁxed x ∈I, we have fn(x) →f(x) as n →∞.
Deﬁnition 4.16 (Uniform convergence). The sequence {fn} converges uniformly
to f on I if for each ǫ > 0 there exists N such that for every n > N the inequality
|fn(x) −f(x)| < ǫ holds for all x ∈I.
How do the sequences in Examples 1 and 2 stack up against these deﬁnitions?
• Both sequences converge pointwise: Both {fn} and {gn} converge point-
wise to their limits, at least on the domain intervals shown. For {fn} we
have
lim
n→∞fn(x) = lim
n→∞xn = 0 = f(x)

242
4. Derivatives
for all x ∈[0, 1). If x = 1, by contrast, then
lim
n→∞fn(1) = lim
n→∞1n = 1 = f(1).
Thus {fn} converges pointwise to f on [0, 1], as claimed.
For {gn}, the squeezing inequality
x −1
n ≤x + sin(nx)
n
≤x + 1
n,
which holds for all n and every ﬁxed x, implies that
lim
n→∞gn(x) = lim


= x = g(x)
for all x ∈[−5, 5]. Thus {gn}, too, converges pointwise to a limit function
We could have used any
domain interval.
g, this time on the domain [−5, 5].
• Only one sequence converges uniformly: Both {fn} and {gn} converge
pointwise to their limit functions; {gn} also converges uniformly. Show-
ing this is straightforward. For given ǫ > 0, the number N = 1/ǫ works: if
n > N, then we have
|gn(x) −g(x)| =

sin(nx)
n
 ≤1
n < 1
N = ǫ,
and the inequality holds for all x in [−5, 5], as the deﬁnition requires.
The sequence {fn} does not converge uniformly to f on [0, 1]. The prob-
lem, roughly speaking, is that the limit function f “jumps” abruptly at
x = 1, while all the fn increase smoothly. We explore this idea more
carefully in the next example.
EXAMPLE 3.
The functions fn(x) = xn converge pointwise on [0, 1] to the limit
function f, with f(x) = 0 for x ̸= 1 and f(1) = 1. Show that {fn} does not
converge uniformly to f on [0, 1].
SOLUTION.
Suppose toward contradiction that {fn} does converge uniformly.
Set ǫ = 0.1, choose N as in Deﬁnition 4.16, and consider the function fN+1.
Then, by design,
|fN+1(x) −f(x)| < 0.1
holds for all x ∈[0, 1]. Because f(1) = 1 and f(x) = 0 for x ̸= 1, the preceding
inequality boils down to two conditions:
(i)
|fN+1(x)| < 0.1
if x ̸= 1;
(ii)
|fN+1(1) −1| < 0.1.

4.4. Sequences and Series of Functions

In particular, we must have either fN+1(x) < 0.1 or fN+1(x) > 0.9 for all
x ∈[0, 1]. This is clearly absurd—the continuous function fN+1(x) = xN+1
must assume every value between zero and one. We’ve shown that uniform con-
vergence fails.

On the other hand ...
EXAMPLE 4.
Show that the same sequence {fn} does converge uniformly on
[0, 0.99], with limit f(x) = 0.
This is the same limit function
as before, but chopped off at x
= 0.99.
SOLUTION.
Let ǫ > 0 be given. Choose a number N such that 0.99N < ǫ. Any
Why can this be done? How big
is N if ǫ = 0.001?
such N works, because for all n > N and all x ∈[0, 0.99], we have
|fn(x) −f(x)| = |xn −0| = xn ≤0.99n < 0.99N < ǫ,
as desired.
♦
Basic properties. Proposition 4.17 collects, as samples, some basic properties of
pointwise and uniform convergence. Proofs and additional properties are left as
exercises.
Proposition 4.17. Let I be an interval, and let {fn} and {gn} be sequences of
real-valued functions, all deﬁned on I.
• Uniform convergence is stronger: If fn →f uniformly, then fn →f point-
wise, too. The converse is false.
• Algebraic combinations: Suppose fn →f and gn →g pointwise on I,
where f and g are functions. Then
fn ± gn →f ± g
and
fngn →fg,
pointwise on I in each case.
• Patching it together: Let I1 and I2 be intervals with I = I1 ∪I2. If fn →f
uniformly (or pointwise) both on I1 and on I2, then fn →f uniformly (or
pointwise) on I.
Properties of Limit Functions
Must the limit of a sequence “inherit” properties from members of the sequence?
For a sequence {xn} of numbers, for instance, we know that if xn ≥0 for all n
and xn →L, then L ≥0, too. On the other hand, the limit of a strictly positive
sequence need not be positive. Similar questions arise for sequences of functions.
Consider {1/n}, for instance.

EXAMPLE 5.
Let {fn} be a sequence of functions deﬁned on an interval I, and
suppose fn →f pointwise on I. If fn(x) ≥0 for all x ∈I and for all n > 0,
must f(x) ≥0 for all x ∈I? If all the fn are continuous on I, must f be
continuous on I, too?
SOLUTION.
The answers are respectively yes and no. If we ﬁx any x in I,
then {fn(x)} is a sequence of nonnegative numbers, and so its limit, f(x), is
also nonnegative, as claimed. As for continuity, we saw in Example 1 that the
continuous functions fn(x) = xn converge pointwise on [0, 1] to a discontinuous

matter.
limit—the function f deﬁned f(x) = 0 if x ̸= 0 and f(1) = 1.
♦
So the pointwise limit of continuous functions need not be continuous. The
situation is different for uniform limits:
Proposition 4.18. Let {fn} be a sequence of functions, converging uniformly on
an interval I to a function f. If all the fn are continuous on I, then f is continuous
on I, too.
The proof idea. The formal proof is clever and slightly technical, but the basic
idea is straightforward. Continuity of f at x = a means, roughly, that if x ≈a,
then f(x) ≈f(a). This holds in the present case because we know (i) fn(x) ≈
f(x) for large n and for all x in I; (ii) fn(x) ≈fn(a) when x ≈a because fn is
continuous at x = a. Putting these conditions together gives, for x ≈a,
f(x) ≈fn(x) ≈fn(a) ≈f(a).
We make this three-step approximation precise in the formal proof.
Watch for three ǫ/ 3’s.
Proof: Let a be any point of I. To show that f is continuous at a, let ǫ > 0 be
given. To ﬁnd a δ > 0 that “works” for ǫ in the deﬁnition of continuity, we argue
in three steps.
First, we choose any particular integer N such that
|f(x) −fN(x)| < ǫ
3
for all x in I;
this is possible because {fn} converges uniformly to f. Second, because fN is
continuous at x = a, we can choose δ > 0 such that
|fN(x) −fN(a)| < ǫ
3
whenever
|x −a| < δ.
Third, we note that, since a ∈I, our choice of N guarantees
|fN(a) −f(a)| < ǫ

□
Derivatives and limits. The uniform limit of a sequence of continuous functions
is continuous, as just shown. Can anything be similar be said about differentiable
functions?
As Example 1 illustrates, the pointwise limit of differentiable functions need
not even be continuous, let alone differentiable. The following example shows
that the uniform limit of differentiable functions need not be differentiable, either.
EXAMPLE 6.
For each positive integer n, deﬁne fn(x) = |x|1+1/n. Figure 4.9
shows several of the fn; the sequence appears to approach the absolute value
function. What is happening with derivatives?
SOLUTION.
The functions fn behave as Figure 4.9 suggests. Writing f(x) =
|x|, we can readily show:
• Each fn is differentiable at all real x. This is clear for x ̸= 0, and not hard
to prove if x = 0.
See the exercises.
• fn →f uniformly on [−1, 1]. This follows from the fact, readily shown,
that
|f(x) −fn(x)| < 1
n
for all x ∈[−1, 1].
Again, see the exercises.

246
4. Derivatives
The point is that, although all the fn are differentiable everywhere, their limit f is
not differentiable at the origin. Thus, differentiability—unlike continuity—is not
preserved by uniform limits.

Convergence or divergence of the series P ak now reduces to the same questions
for the sequence {An}. Per Deﬁnition 2.22, page 122, the series P ak converges
to the sum A if and only if the sequence {An} of partial sums converges to A.
Exactly the same approach works for series of functions.

The topic of function series in general, and power series in particular, is vast.
We take just a quick glance to suggest the topic’s contours. The next example
concerns the simplest and arguably most useful power series; note the close con-
nection to geometric series already studied.

Does the power series converge to some function g on some interval I? Is the

SOLUTION.
In the notation of Deﬁnition 4.19 we have gn(x) = xn for n ≥0,
and the partial sum functions are
f0(x) = 1;
f1(x) = 1+x;
f2(x) = 1+x+x2; f3(x) = 1+x+x2+x3;
. . . .
Here’s the key point: For each x, 1 + x + x2 + x3 + . . . is a geometric series
in powers of x, and and therefore converges if (but only if) |x| < 1. (Review
geometric series around page 125, if necessary.) We even know the limit:

power series converges pointwise for x ∈I = (−1, 1) to the function g(x) =
1/(1 −x).
Convergence in this case is not uniform on all of I = (−1, 1), but it is uni-

let ǫ > 0 be given. Because P 0.8n converges, we can choose N such that

More on power series. We saw above and will see again below that the limits
of convergent function sequences and series may be functions that are less well-

A function of Weierstrass: everywhere continuous, nowhere differentiable.
One use of function limits is in exploring how “good” and “bad” behaviors can
coexist in the same function. In Example 6, for instance, we obtained the absolute
value function—continuouseverywhere but not differentiable at one point—as the
uniform limit of a sequence of differentiable functions.
Using similar but more sophisticated methods, the mathematician Weierstrass
constructed around 1872 a much stranger limit function: one that is continuous
everywhere but differentiable nowhere on R. Weierstrass’s construction starts
with a function sequence of the following form:
f0(x) = cos(πx)
f1(x) = cos(πx) + a cos (bπx)
f2(x) = cos(πx) + a cos (bπx) + a2 cos

Here a is a constant with 0 < a < 1, small enough to assure that the fn converge
uniformly; b is a positive integer, large enough to create rapid oscillation in the
cosines. We omit computational details, but here are the main points:
• The fn converge uniformly on R to some function f.
• All the fn are differentiable (and therefore continuous).
• The limit function f is continuous everywhere, as Proposition 4.18 guaran-
tees.
• Thanks to rapid oscillation in the summands, the limit function is differen-
tiable nowhere.
Figure 4.10 shows the ﬁrst few fn, with a = 0.5 and b = 13.

Taylor Series and Taylor’s Theorem: A Guided
Discovery
This brief section, designed as an outline for self-study, explores an important

mean value theorem. Here is a slightly modiﬁed form of the version from Sec-
tion 4.3:
Theorem 4.21 (Taylor’s theorem, n = 3). Suppose f, f ′, f ′′, and f ′′′ all exist
and are continuous on [a, b]. Then, for some input c in [a, b], we have

(b −a)2.

Taylor polynomials: good approximations. The expression f(a) + f ′(a)(b −

(b −a)2 in the preceding theorem points to a natural deﬁnition:
Deﬁnition 4.22 (Taylor polynomials). Let f be a function deﬁned on an interval
containing x = a, such that the values and derivatives f(a), f ′(a), f ′′(a), ...,
f (n)(a) all exist. Then the polynomial function

makes sense, and is called the Taylor polynomial of order n for f based at x = a.
If a = 0 we refer to Maclaurin polynomials.
Let’s work out some basic examples.

4. Derivatives
As the examples show, the function f and the polynomial Pn have the same
value and ﬁrst n derivatives at x = a. In this sense Pn could reasonably be
described as the “best polynomial approximation” to f at x = a. The version
of Taylor’s theorem above says something about how closely P2(b) approximates
f(b) when calculations are based at x = a.
An inequality form of Taylor’s theorem. The version of Taylor’s theorem above
pertains speciﬁcally to the second-order Taylor polynomial P2, and involves an
equality, though with an unknown value c. The following more general version,
which involves an inequality, works well for our purposes. We state it for a = 0
for simplicity:
Theorem 4.23 (Taylor’s theorem, inequality version). Suppose f, f ′, f ′′, ...,
f (n+1) all exist for x in some interval I = [−b, b], and that for some constant
K,

|f(x) −Pn(x)| ≤K |x|n+1
(n + 1)! ≤K |b|n+1
(n + 1)!
for x ∈[−b, b].
Again, some examples.
1. What does the theorem say for f(x) = ex, n = 4, and b = 2? Use plotting
technology to check that the claimed inequality does indeed hold.
2. What does the theorem say for f(x) = x4, n = 4, and I = [−2, 2]? What
if f(x) = x5?
Toward a proof. Complete the following ingredients of a proof of Theorem 4.23
for the case 0 ≤x ≤b. (The case −b ≤x ≤0 is similar.)
1. Let g(x) = f(x) −Pn(x) for x ∈[−b, b]. Show that 0 = g(0) = g′(0) =
g′′(0) = . . . g(n)(0), and g(n+1)(x) = f (n + 1)(x).
2. Suppose h and k are functions on [−b, b] with (i) h(0) = k(0), and (ii)
h′(x) ≤k′(x) for 0 ≤x ≤b. Then h(x) ≤k(x) for 0 ≤x ≤b. Hint: The
mean value theorem or a corollary may be useful.
3. Our hypothesis is that
−K ≤g(n + 1)(x) ≤K
for x ∈[0, b].
By the preceding fact, we can antidifferentiate:
−Kx ≤g(n)(x) ≤Kx
for x ∈[0, b].

Like any power series, S(x) may or may not converge for particular x. Even
if S(x) does converge, there’s no automatic guarantee that it converges to f(x),
as we’d hope. But under good conditions, Taylor’s theorem can assure us that all
is well.
Let’s explore one poster-child example.
1. Write the Taylor (i.e., Maclaurin) series for f(x) = ex centered at a = 0.
2. Use the ratio test to show that the Maclaurin series for f(x) = ex converges
for all x.

ferent variable names, but these choices are arbitrary—all four expressions have
the same numerical value. For simplicity and economy, we’ll often drop the vari-
able name entirely, and use the last form. We’ll use the other forms when we want
to emphasize a variable name or, as in the third form, when no speciﬁc function
name is given.
Riemann’s and other integrals. In this book (and in elementary calculus) “inte-
gral” means “Riemann integral,” after the German mathematician G. F. B. Rie-
mann (1826–1866), who ﬁrst deﬁned integrability rigorously. Riemann’s mathe-
matical accomplishments, despite his short life, ranged across the discipline. One
of his conjectures in number theory, now known as the Riemann hypothesis, re-
mains after 150 years among mathematics’ most important unsolved problems.
And not for lack of trying: A $1 million prize for its solution, offered by the Clay
Mathematics Institute, lies unclaimed.

5. Integrals
The phrase “Riemann integral” honors a person, but it also distinguishes one
particular approach to integration from several others, each with its own features
and (depending on one’s viewpoint) bugs. Among important alternatives to Rie-
mann’s integral are the Lebesgue and the Henstock integrals, developed around
1900 and 1950, respectively. These integrals “agree with” the Riemann integral
for all the standard functions of calculus, but they are more general in the sense
that they handle larger classes of functions. More advanced courses in analysis
treat such integrals carefully, but we will stick with Riemann’s version.
Areas and integrals. The most familiar view of integrals from elementary calcu-
lus involves area: If f(x) ≥0 for x ∈[a, b], then
R b
a f(x) dx measures the area
above the x-axis, below the curve y = f(x), and between the vertical lines x = a
and x = b. If f(x) < 0 for some inputs, then area below the x-axis is involved,
and counts as negative.
Draw your own pictures to
illustrate the possibilities.
Thinking of integrals as areas will often be helpful for us, too. This view
suggests—correctly—that

result and elementary calculus intuition suggest that f(x) is in some sense more
negative than positive for x in the interval [a, b]. But in what sense is the answer
exactly −7?
Resolving all these questions asks a lot of the integral, and so it is no surprise
that the recipe is complicated. Here, ﬁrst, we assemble the ingredients:
• Integrand and interval: The deﬁnition requires an integrand—a real-valued
function f : [a, b] →R deﬁned for all inputs x in a closed and bounded
interval [a, b]. Note, in particular, that although integral equations like

of the type considered here.
• Partitions, subintervals, and norms: A partition P of an interval [a, b] is
any choice of n + 1 points {x0, x1, . . . , xn}, arranged in increasing order
from a to b:
a = x0 < x1 < x2 < · · · < xn−1 < xn = b.
We’ll often just write P = {x0, x1, x2, . . . , xn} to emphasize that P is a
set; the smallest-to-biggest ordering is understood.
The object of choosing P is to chop [a, b] into n smaller closed intervals,
“Partition” is the polite term.
meeting only at their endpoints:
[a, b] = [x0, x1] ∪[x1, x2] ∪· · · ∪[xi−1, xi] ∪· · · ∪[xn−1, xn].
We’ll call [xi−1, xi] the i-th subinterval; its length is the positive number
∆xi = xi −xi−1. If the points of P happen to be regularly spaced, then
the partition is called regular, and ∆xi = (b −a)/n for all i. For any
partition, regular or not, we have
∆x1 + ∆x2 + · · · + ∆xn = xn −x0 = b −a.
The norm of a partition P, denoted ∥P∥, is the largest of the ∆xi. Requir-
Also known as the mesh.
ing that ∥P∥< δ, as we will in the deﬁnition, ensures that every subinterval
is narrow.
• Sampling points: Given any partition P = {x0, x1, x2, . . . , xn} of an in-
terval [a, b], we can choose sampling points
s1 ∈[x0, x1],
s2 ∈[x1, x2],
. . . ,
sn ∈[xn−1, xn],
one from each subinterval of P, to form a full set S = {s1, s2, . . . , sn} of
sampling points from P.
There are many, many ways to choose a sample S from any given parti-
tion P. We could choose each subinterval’s left endpoint, its right endpoint,
or its midpoint, or any combination. Or we could throw an imaginary dart
into each subinterval to choose a sampling point at random. A partition
endpoint, say x42, might even serve twice as a sample point, representing
both [x41, x42] and [x42, x43].
• Riemann sums: Given all the data (a function f, an interval [a, b], a parti-
tion P, and samples S) just described, a Riemann sum is an expression of
the form

f(si)∆xi = f(s1)∆x1 + f(s2)∆x2 + · · · + f(sn)∆xn.

As a shorthand we’ll sometimes use the notation RS(f, P, S) to denote a

Even the shorthand is slightly
cumbersome.
RS(f, P, S) reduces to a number. Under good conditions—as speciﬁed in
the coming deﬁnition—we expect this number to approximate an integral.
A Riemann sum is a sort of “representative sample” of the function f on
[a, b]: We chop [a, b] into smaller pieces, evaluate f at one point of each
piece, and add up the results, “weighting” each value f(si) with the “size”
of the subinterval it represents. Figure 5.1 illustrates the familiar idea.

We don’t know “ofﬁcially” yet
that the integral exists. But it
does.
SOLUTION.
The integral involves the integrand f(x) = sin x and the interval
[0, 2]. The simplest and least interesting partition of [0, 2] involves no chopping:
P = {x0, x1} = {0, 2} has just one subinterval, and ∥P∥= 2. Here we need

is simply
f(s1)∆x1 = sin(1.3657) · 2 ≈1.9581.
With so little work or thought invested, we can’t expect much return from the
answer.
Let’s work (just) a little harder. With
P = {0, 0.8, 1.0, 1.7, 2}
and
S = {0, 0.81, 1.69, 1.73},

we have ∥P∥= 0.8 and the Riemann sum RS(f, P, S) becomes

X
i=1
f(si)∆xi = sin(0) · 0.8 + sin(0.81) · 0.2 + sin(1.69) · 0.7 + sin(1.73) · 0.3
≈1.57.
With the same partition, but new samples S = {0.8, 0.8, 1.7, 1.7}, the Riemann
sum becomes
sin(0.8) · 0.8 + sin(0.8) · 0.2 + sin(1.7) · 0.7 + sin(1.7) · 0.3 ≈2.14,
which isn’t all that close to earlier estimates.
Now let’s get serious. With a regular, 20-piece partition (so ∥P∥= 0.1) and
midpoint samples, we have
P = {0, 0.1, 0.2, . . ., 1.9, 2}
and
S = {0.05, 0.15, . . ., 1.95},
and the Riemann sum works out to
Thanks, Mathematica.
sin(0.05) · 0.1 + sin(0.15) · 0.1 + · · · + sin(1.95) · 0.1 ≈1.42.
With right endpoint samples S = {0.01, 0.02, . . ., 2.0} from the same partition
the result is not much different; Mathematica gives about 1.421. These numbers,
and all the extra work, deserve more credibility.
♦
Rightly so. The exact value, as
we will be able to prove soon, is
1 – cos 2 ≈1.41615.
We are ready at last for the formal deﬁnition.
Deﬁnition 5.1. Let [a, b] be a closed interval, f : [a, b] →R a function, and I a
real number. Then f is integrable on [a, b], and we write R b
a f = I, if for every
given ǫ > 0 there exists δ > 0 such that
|RS (f, P, S) −I| < ǫ
whenever P = {x0, x1, . . . , xn} is a partition of [a, b] with ∥P∥< δ and S =
{s1, . . . , sn} is any set of samples from P.
Illustrating the Deﬁnition
The deﬁnition is undeniably complicated, but simple examples will help us un-
pack it, and reveal some pleasant surprises.

Let f(x) = 3 for all x and [a, b] = [1, 7]. Thinking of area

which is exactly the desired answer. Thus, for a given ǫ > 0 we can choose any
positive δ, say δ = 42, and the deﬁnition is satisﬁed.
♦
There’s nothing special, of course, about the data in the preceding example.

f is integrable on [a, b], and

erty of integrals that follows directly from the deﬁnition.
Proposition 5.3. Suppose f(x) ≥0 for all x ∈[a, b]. If
R b
a f exists,
R b
a f ≥0.
Proof: The idea is simple: since all Riemann sums for I =
R b
a f are nonnegative,
I itself must be nonnegative, too. The formal proof takes some care.
Let ǫ > 0 be given. Choose δ > 0 that works for this ǫ in the sense of
Deﬁnition 5.1. If we choose any Riemann sum RS (f, P, S) with ∥P∥< δ, then
we must have |RS (f, P, S) −I| < ǫ. Because f(x) ≥0 for all x ∈[a, b], it
is clear that RS (f, P, S) ≥0, too, and so we must have I ≥−ǫ. Since this
inequality holds for all positive ǫ, we must have I ≥0.
□
Stranger integrands. In Proposition 5.3 we assumed that the integral exists. De-
ciding which integrals exist takes some work, and we start slowly. The following
integrand is discontinuous, but only at one point. Does it matter?

Proving this is not difﬁcult. Let ǫ > 0 be given, set δ = ǫ/2, and let P =
{x0, x1, . . . , xn} be any partition with ∥P∥< δ. We need to show that if S =
{s1, s2, . . . , sn} is any set of sampling points for P, then the associated Riemann
sum satisﬁes
−ǫ < f(s1)∆x1 + · · · + f(sn)∆xn < ǫ.
Since all of the f(si)∆xi are nonnegative, it is enough to prove the right-hand
inequality.
The left-hand inequality is
obvious.
Now f(si) = 0 unless si = 1, in which case f(si) = 1. Thus, each summand
f(si)∆xi is either 0 or ∆xi. Because the “offender point” x = 1 can lie in at
most two subintervals, say [xi−1, xi] and [xi, xi+1], our Riemann sum can have at
most two nonzero summands. Adding everything up gives
Very likely, all summands are

No. The problem, roughly speaking, is that for every partition P =

irrational numbers inside every subinterval [xi−1, xi]. If all of the sample points

We know already from the discussion in Example 2 that f is inte-

1 f = 10. We need now to show that f has the same
integral over a larger interval. This should seem reasonable if we think in terms
of area; the (slightly laborious) proof makes this intuition precise.
Suppose, then, that ǫ > 0 is given. We’ll show that δ = ǫ/10 works in the

sense of Deﬁnition 5.1. To see this, let P = {x0, . . . , xn} be any partition of
[0, 4] with ∥P∥< δ, let S = {s1, . . . , sn} be any choice of sampling points
within P, and let RS (f, P, S) be the corresponding Riemann sum. To prove our
claim, we need to show that
10 −ǫ < RS (f, P, S) < 10 + ǫ.
We’ll tackle the left-hand inequality and leave the right-hand one as an exercise.
Because P is a partition of [0, 4], we can choose among the partition points
the ﬁrst xi with xi ≥1 and the last xi with xi ≤3. If, say, these points are x42

and x237, then we have
· · · < x41 < 1 ≤x42 < x43 < · · · < x236 < x237 ≤3 < x238 < . . . .
This implies that 1 ≤si ≤3 for i = 43, 44, . . ., 237, and so f(si) = 5 for all
these i. Moreover, because ∥P∥< δ, we know that
x42 < 1 + δ
and
3 −δ < x237,
and so x237 −x42 > 2 −2δ. Now we can calculate:
all terms are nonnegative
the ∆xi “collapse”
RS (f, P, S) = f(s1)∆x1 + · · · + f(sn)∆xn

= 5 (x237 −x42)
> 5 (2 −2δ) = 10 −10δ = 10 −ǫ,
as we aimed to show.
♦
Lessons from the examples. The examples illustrate one pleasant and one less
pleasant property of integrals. The good news is that the Riemann integral is rel-
atively forgiving of minor misbehavior, such as occasional discontinuities, in an
integrand. Less convenient is the fact that proofs and calculations using the def-
inition, even for quite simple integrands, can be messy and technical. The moral
As we just saw in Example 5.
is that we’d like to have both simpler tests for integrability and more efﬁcient
methods of calculating integrals. We’ll ﬁnd some in the following sections.
Which Functions are Riemann Integrable?
Deciding precisely which functions have integrals and which don’t turns out to be
a very hard problem; we won’t tackle it in full generality. Partial answers, how-
ever, are interesting and accessible—and sometimes surprising. We will show,
for instance, that every continuous function (and hence every differentiable func-
tion) on an interval [a, b] is indeed integrable. We’ll see, too, that every monotone
function f : [a, b] →R is also integrable—even though such an f might have
inﬁnitely many discontinuities on [a, b].
Try drawing a
monotone-but-nasty function.
We will study the question of integrability more carefully in Section 5.3.
Meanwhile, here’s one useful criterion.
Proposition 5.4. If f is integrable on [a, b], then f is bounded on [a, b].

266
5. Integrals
About the proof. We sketch the proof of a special case, leaving generalities
to the exercises.
Suppose, say, that
R 3
0 f = 42.
Now let ǫ = 1.
Choose
δ > 0 that works for this ǫ in the sense described in Deﬁnition 5.1, and let
P = {x0, x1, x2, . . . , xn} be any partition of [1, 3] with ∥P∥< δ. If we can
show that f is bounded on each of the n subintervals [xi−1, xi], we can conclude
that f is bounded on all of [1, 3].
To see why f is bounded on, say, [x6, x7], consider the expression
t is the only variable; all the xi
are constants.
S(t) = f(x1)∆x1 +· · ·+f(x6)∆x6 +f(t)∆x7 +f(x8)∆x8 +· · ·+f(xn)∆xn.
Here is the key idea: For each t ∈[x6, x7], S(t) is a Riemann sum, based on the
partition P, for the integral
R 3
0 f, and so Deﬁnition 5.1 guarantees that
41 < S(t) < 43,
which means that S(t) is bounded for t ∈[x6, x7]. This implies, as desired, that
f(t) is bounded for t ∈[x6, x7].

two partitions of [a, b] with ∥P1∥< δ and ∥P2∥< δ, and S1 and S2 are
corresponding sample sets, then |RS(f, P1, S1) −RS(f, P2, S2)| < ǫ.

integrable on [a, b]; here are some steps in that direction.
(a) Explain why the following condition holds: for any given ǫ > 0, there
exists some δ > 0 such that if s and t are in [0, 1] and |s −t| < δ,
then |f(s) −f(t)| < ǫ.
(b) Let ǫ and δ be as in the preceding part, let P = {x0, x1, x2, . . . , xn}
be any partition with ∥P∥< δ, and let S = {s1, s2, . . . , sn} and
T = {t1, t2, . . . , tn} be two different sample sets for P. Show that
|RS(f, P, S) −RS(f, P, T )| < ǫ(b −a).

elements are the midpoints of their respective subdivisions. (For ex-
ample, m7 = (x7 + x6)/2.) Show that RS(f, P, M) = 1/2.
(b) Let ǫ > 0 be given. Show that δ = ǫ works in Deﬁnition 5.1 to
show that I =

0 f = 1/2. (Use the preceding fact and part (b) of
Problem 11.)
13. Generalize ideas in Problem 12 to show that f(x) = x is integrable on
every interval [a, b], and that R b
a x dx = (b2 −a2)/2.
14. Let f(x) = 1/x if x ̸= 0 and f(0) = 0. Proposition 5.4 says that f is
not integrable on [0, 1]. To illustrate this, show that, for any partition P =
{0, x1, . . . , xn−1, 1}, there is some sample set P = {s1, s2, . . . , sn}
such that RS(f, P2, S2) > 1000.

Properties of the Integral
Basic properties of the deﬁnite integral are familiar from elementary calculus—
where they may be taken for granted. Using the formal deﬁnition, we can readily
give rigorous proofs.

Algebra with Integrals
It is standard operating procedure in calculus to break complicated integrands
apart, integrate the pieces separately, and then reassemble the results. For exam-
ple, we can write

assuming (for now) that all three integrals in question exist. In elementary calcu-
lus we may skip over some theoretical niceties, but now we can do things right.
The next theorem guarantees that integrable functions (like differentiable func-
tions, continuous functions, and other objects we have studied) “behave well”
with respect to addition and scalar multiplication.
Theorem 5.5. Suppose that functions f and g are integrable on [a, b], and let k
be any number. Then the new functions kf and f + g are also integrable on [a, b],
with

kf = k

and

Integration is linear. Before proving the theorem we observe that we can apply
it repeatedly to handle more complicated linear combinations. If, say, f, g, and
h are all integrable on [2, 5], then the following equation makes good sense—and
it’s true:

A fancier way to state these ideas uses the language of linear algebra. The set
V of integrable functions on [a, b] is a vector space, and integration on [a, b] is a
linear transformation from V to R (another vector space!).
Proving Theorem 5.5. We’ll sketch the proof for sums and leave the rest to the
exercises. For brevity we write If for
R b
a f and Ig for
R b
a g.
Let ǫ > 0 be given. Since If and Ig exist, there are positive numbers δf and
δg such that, for any sampling points s1, . . . , sn,
∥P∥< δf

Now let δ = min{δf, δg}; we’ll show that this δ “works” in the sense of Def-
inition 5.1 for the sum function f + g. To do so, consider any partition P =
{x0, x1, x2, . . . xn} with ∥P∥< δ, and let S = {s1, s2, . . . sn} be any corre-
sponding choice of sampling points. Now we calculate:

This shows what we claimed: f + g is integrable on [a, b], with integral If + Ig.
Bigger integrands, bigger integrals. Theorem 5.5 has a simple and natural corol-
lary; we leave the proof to the exercises.

g(x) = f(x) for all but ﬁnitely many x in [a, b]. What can be said about

In this case,

Here is another way to express the result: If R b

♦
Joinery
Another way to build new integrals from old is to stick “pieces” of various func-
tions together. Interestingly, the pieces need not ﬁt together continuously. In this
sense, the integral is more forgiving than the derivative, which requires smoother
joinery.

¯f(si)∆xi = ¯f(s1)∆x1 + ¯f(s2)∆x2 + · · · + ¯f(sn)∆xn.
We need to show that S lies within ǫ of I. To do so, let xi0 be the largest member
of P that does not exceed b; that is, xi0 ≤b < xi0+1. Now for i > i0 + 1 we
know ¯f(si) = 0, while for i ≤i0 we have ¯f(si) = f(si). With these facts in
mind, we can rewrite S:
S = f(s1)∆x1 + f(s2)∆x2 + · · · + f(si0)∆xi0 + ¯f(si0+1)∆xi0+1.
This form reveals that S is almost a Riemann sum for
R b
a f. Indeed, the similar
sum
S′ = f(s1)∆x1 + f(s2)∆x2 + · · · + f(si0)∆xi0 + f(b) (b −xi0)
is a Riemann sum for
R b
a f, correspondingto the new partition P′ = {a, x1, x2, . . . , xi0, b};
note that ∥P′∥< δ. (If xi0 = b then the last summand in S′ vanishes.)
To ﬁnish the proof, we observe that, by our hypothesis,

Theorem 5.8 needs an important caveat: The add-up-the-pieces strategy is
guaranteed to work only if we know in advance that the “smaller” integrals
R c
a f
and
R b
c f exist. (We do know this in Example 3, in which f is constant on each
smaller subinterval.) In particular, we have not proved the tempting (and true) fact
that if f is integrable on [a, b], then it is also integrable on any smaller interval
[a, c]. We will prove this in the next section, where we consider more carefully
the question of which functions are integrable.
Antiderivatives and Integrals: Toward a Fundamental
Theorem
Elementary calculus experience suggests, almost irresistibly, that integrals and
antiderivatives are closely connected. So they are, and the following result, a
junior-grade version of the familiar fundamental theorem of calculus, begins the
connection.
But there’s more to say: a stronger version (Theorem 5.19, page 293) appears
in the next section.

5.2. Properties of the Integral
275
Theorem 5.9 (Fundamental theorem of calculus, version 0). Let f : [a, b] →R
be a function, and suppose
(i) f is integrable on [a, b];
(ii) there is a function F : [a, b] →R, continuous on [a, b] and differentiable on
(a, b), such that F ′(x) = f(x) for all x ∈(a, b).
Then
R b
a f = F(b) −F(a).
Proof: By our hypotheses, both of the numbers I =
R b
a f and F(b) −F(a) exist;
we need to show they’re equal. We’ll do so by proving that
|F(b) −F(a) −I| < ǫ
for every positive ǫ, no matter how small.
Let ǫ > 0 be given. Because I satisﬁes Deﬁnition 5.1, we can choose δ > 0
as described there. Now let
P = {x0 = a, x1, x2, . . . xn = b}
be any partition with ∥P∥< δ.
Finding such a P is easy. One
is to chop [a,b ] into n equal
pieces, where [a,b ] / n < δ.
The proof uses a clever idea: If we choose the sampling points s1, s2, . . . , sn
just right, the associated Riemann sum adds up, after some fancy telescoping, to
none other than F(b) −F(a). Once this is done, Deﬁnition 5.1 guarantees that
F(b)−F(a), like every Riemann sum associated with P, lies within ǫ of I. Since
ǫ is arbitrary, we must have F(b) −F(a) = I, as claimed.
To choose these special sampling points, we apply the mean value theorem
(MVT) to our antiderivative function F, once on each of the n partition subin-
tervals.
Hypothesis (ii) assures that the MVT applies.
For each subinterval
[xi−1, xi], the MVT says that for some si in (xi−1, xi),
F(xi) −F(xi−1) = F ′(si)(xi −xi−1) = f(si)∆xi.
Adding all n of these results gives the desired Riemann sum:

This completes the proof.

Good news—and some cautions. Theorem 5.9 should look familiar. It allows
many standard integral calculations of elementary calculus, like this one:

Avoiding all that fuss over partitions, norms, and Riemann sums seems—and is—
a big advantage in calculating a lot of integrals. But some sticky questions remain:
• Can we ﬁnd an antiderivative? In the preceding calculation, with f(x) =
x2, it was easy to ﬁnd (or just to know) that F(x) = x3/3 is a suitable
antiderivative. For other functions it can be much harder, or even impossi-
ble, to ﬁnd antiderivative formulas. For instance, neither of the harmless-
looking functions
f(x) = cos(x2)
and
g(x) = cos(x) ln(x)
has an “elementary antiderivative”—a function built from standard function
“elements”: polynomials, trigonometric functions, logarithms, etc. Without

notice the strange ingredients in
the answer.
a suitable antiderivative F, Theorem 5.9 is useless for calculation.
• Is f integrable? We assumed in the theorem—and used crucially in the
proof—that
R b
a f exists. Elementary calculus courses often skirt the ques-
tion of integrability, perhaps forgivably both because the matter is subtle
and because the basic functions of elementary calculus turn to be integrable
on intervals within their domains.
Theorem 5.9 dodges the tough questions above by simply assuming, as hy-
potheses, that all is well. Doing so simpliﬁes the proof, but it weakens the theo-
rem. In the next section, we’ll grapple more seriously with the question of which
functions are integrable. A key result (which applies to all basic functions of ele-
mentary calculus) is that every function f continuous on a closed interval [a, b] is
also integrable there.
Using the Fundamental Theorem
Among the drawbacks to using the (complicated!) basic deﬁnition to prove that
Deﬁnition 5.1, page 261
an integral I exists is the need to know (or guess) a speciﬁc numerical value for
I. This number may not be obvious, but Theorem 5.9 sometimes helps.
EXAMPLE 4.
Does
R π
0 (2x + sin(x)) dx exist? If so, how big is it?
SOLUTION.
The function f(x) = 2x + sin(x) has antiderivative F(x) = x2 −
cos(x), and so F(π) −F(0) = π2 + 2 ≈11.87. Theorem 5.9 does not guarantee
We will see later that f , being
continuous, is integrable.
that the integral exists, but it does say that π2 + 2 is the only possible value.
♦

5.2. Properties of the Integral
277
EXAMPLE 5.
Show that
R 1
0 2x dx = 1; use Theorem 5.9 and Deﬁnition 5.1.
SOLUTION.
The easy part is ﬁnding a value for the integral. Since the integrand
f(x) = 2x has antiderivative F(x) = x2, and F(1) −F(0) = 1, Theorem 5.9
says that one is the only possible value.
We could have thought about
areas, too.
The tricky bit is showing that the integral exists. We have, for now, only
Deﬁnition 5.1 to work with, so we start as usual with a given positive ǫ. Let
δ = ǫ; we’ll use some clever algebra and a nice collapsing sum to show that this
δ “works.”
Let P = {x0, x1, x2, . . . xn} be any partition of [0, 1] with ∥P∥< δ. We

It sufﬁces, therefore, to show that the right-hand sum above can’t exceed 1 + ǫ.

for each i, then substitution and a little algebra give

Integrability
How can we decide whether a given function f : [a, b] →R is integrable on
[a, b]? The question is obviously important: a useful integral should apply to
many functions. The question is also difﬁcult: deciding which functions satisfy a
complicated deﬁnition naturally takes some work.
So far we’ve seen only piecemeal results:
• If f is integrable, then f is bounded.
See Proposition 5.4, page 265.
• A discontinuous function f may or may not be integrable.
See Example 3, page 262, and
Example 4, page 263.
• We’ve also said—but not proved—that every continuous function is inte-
grable.
See Example 4, page 276.
In this section we approach these matters rigorously, and identify some im-
portant classes of integrable functions. Our main tool, detailed in Theorem 5.14,
is the box sum, a useful and practically usable criterion for integrability.
Criteria for Integrability
Our deﬁnition of the Riemann integral is relatively technical, so we expect that
detecting integrability (or its absence) will be challenging, too. An immediate
hurdle is the fact the deﬁnition requires a “candidate” I for the value of a given
integral. It turns out that we can skirt this problem with a “Cauchy criterion” for
Riemann sums.
We did something similar—for
similar reasons—for sequences.

5.3. Integrability
281
Lemma 5.10. Let f[a, b] →R be a bounded function. Suppose that for every
ǫ > 0 there exists δ > 0 such that
|RS(f, P1, S1) −RS(f, P2, S2)| < ǫ
whenever P1 and P2 are partitions of [a, b] such that both ∥P1∥< δ and ∥P2∥<
δ, and samples S1 and S2 come from P1 and P2. Then the integral
R b
a f exists.
Proof: The idea is to concoct a certain Cauchy sequence {In} of numbers, whose
limit I will turn out to be the desired integral.
Every Cauchy sequence has
one.
To get started, for each n ∈N we use the hypothesis to choose a positive
number δn such that
|RS(f, P1, S1) −RS(f, P2, S2)| < 1
n
for all Riemann sums based on partitions P1 and P2 with both ∥P1∥< δn and
∥P2∥< δn. For technical reasons we choose the δn to be decreasing: δ1 ≥δ2 ≥

possible.
δ3 ≥. . . .
Next, for each n we choose any particular partition Pn with ∥Pn∥< δn
A regular partition works ﬁne.
and any particular set Sn of samples from Pn. The associated Riemann sum
RS(f, Pn, Sn) is then a number; let’s call it In for short. This process produces
a numerical sequence {In}, which is readily shown to be Cauchy—and hence
converges to some limit I. (The proof that {In} is Cauchy uses the fact that the
δn decrease; see the exercises.)
Last, we use Deﬁnition 5.1, page 261, to show that I is the sought-after inte-
gral. For given ǫ > 0, we ﬁrst choose any positive integer N for which both
|IN −I| < ǫ
2
and
1
N < ǫ
2,
and we set δ = δN as chosen above. This δ does what Deﬁnition 5.1 asks. If P
is any partition with ∥P∥< δN, S is any set of samples, and RS(f, P, S) is the
corresponding Riemann sum, then the triangle inequality and our choices give
|RS(f, P, S) −I| ≤|RS(f, P, S) −IN| + |IN −I|
≤ǫ
2 + ǫ
2 = ǫ,
as Deﬁnition 5.1 requires.

Not quite there. Lemma 5.10 will prove useful, but it has a serious practical
drawback: showing that the hypothesized inequality holds for all suitable parti-

Integrability and Box Sums
Figure 5.4 shows (shaded) the lower sum, the upper sum, and the correspond-
ing box sum—the difference between upper and lower sums—for a well-behaved
integrand f and a ﬁve-piece partition of [a, b].
The picture suggests the appropriate deﬁnitions, but some extra care is needed
for discontinuous integrands. The ﬁne print follows.
Upper and lower sums. For any given partition P of an interval [a, b], there
are inﬁnitely many ways of choosing samples S compatible with P, and hence
inﬁnitely many possible Riemann sums associated to P. To get upper and lower
bounds on the values of all these Riemann sums, it is helpful to consider upper
sums and lower sums.
If the integrand f is continuous on [a, b], as in Figure 5.4, then upper and lower
sums are ordinary Riemann sums, with sampling points chosen to maximize or
minimize f over each separate subinterval. (A continuous function has maximum
and minimum values on each subinterval, by the extreme value theorem.) In this
case, therefore, upper and lower sums are simply the largest and smallest possible

5.3. Integrability

Riemann sums for a given partition.
A discontinuous integrand f, on the other hand, need not attain maximum and
minimum values on a given subinterval. If f is bounded on [a, b], however, then
both
mi = inf{ f(x) | x ∈[xi−1, xi] }
and
Mi = sup{ f(x) | x ∈[xi−1, xi] }
exist for each i, and so the following deﬁnitions make sense.
The completeness axiom
guarantees this.
Deﬁnition 5.11. Let f : [a, b] →R be a bounded function, and P = {x0, x1, . . . ,
xn} a partition of [a, b]. With mi and Mi as above, we deﬁne upper and lower
sums as follows:

nections to Riemann sums and to the integrals they approximate. We collect two
such facts in the following proposition, using RS, US, and LS to denote Riemann,
upper, and lower sums.
Upper and lower sums don’t
depend on samples, and so
their notations don’t involve
an S.
Proposition 5.12. Let f : [a, b] →R be a bounded function, and P any partition
of [a, b].
(i) If S is set of samples from P, then
LS (f, P) ≤RS (f, P, S) ≤US (f, P) .
(ii) If f is integrable, with
R b
a f = I, then
LS (f, P) ≤I ≤US (f, P) .
About proofs. The inequality in (i) follows immediately from the deﬁnitions of
upper and lower sums. Part (ii) is slightly subtler; see the exercises for both parts.
Clamping down: box sums. Proposition 5.12 suggests that it is a good thing for
integrability when upper and lower sums are close together. Box sums measure
this closeness.
Deﬁnition 5.13 (The box sum). Let f : [a, b] →R be a bounded function and
P = {x0, x1, . . . xn} a partition of [a, b]. The associated box sum is the difference
US (f, P) −RS (f, P) = (M1 −m1)∆x1 + · · · + (Mn −mn)∆xn.

Figure 5.5. Two more box sums.
Box sums have a nice geometric interpretation, as seen already in Figure 5.4(c).
Figure 5.5(a) shows another box sum for the same integrand as before, but here
with a ﬁner partition. Figure 5.5(b) shows another ten-element box sum, this time
for a discontinuous integrand.
Here is the key point: For both integrands in Figure 5.5, the total shaded
area—the box sum—can be made as small as we wish by requiring that the par-
tition have small norm. This seems clear enough for the smooth integrand in
Figure 5.5(a): For a partition with tiny norm, the shaded area becomes smaller
and smaller, approaching a skinny “tube” around the graph of f.
Less obvious, but equally important, is the fact that the total shaded area can
also be made small for the discontinuous integrand in Figure 5.5(b). Figure 5.6
suggests why. Any partition P may generate one or two tall box sum elements,
but if P has small norm, then all boxes are narrow and their areas don’t amount
to much. We formalize these ideas in a theorem.
Theorem 5.14 (The box-sum criterion). A function f : [a, b] →R is integrable
on [a, b] if and only if for each ǫ > 0 there exists some partition P of [a, b] with
box sum less than ǫ.
Many uses. We outline the rather technical proof at the end of this section; it
involves some meticulous bookkeeping. First we illustrate the theorem’s uses and
advantages—including the fact that for a given ǫ we need only one suitable par-
tition to prove integrability. Observe also that the box-sum criterion works both
ways: it detects both integrability and non-integrability. Example 1 illustrates
both of these uses.

5.3. Integrability
285
We have shown by other methods that f is integrable on [0, 1] but g is not. What
do box sums say?
SOLUTION.
For f, consider the three-piece partition
P = {0, 0.499, 0.501, 1},
which “isolates” the jump discontinuity at x = 0.5 in the skinny interval [0.499,
0.501]. The box sum—only 0.002 in this case—can be made even smaller nar-
rowing the middle interval even further. Thus f is indeed integrable.
With integral 0.5.
For g the conclusion is negative: for any partition P of [0, 1], every box ele-
ment has height one, and so the box sum is one.
♦
Draw your own picture.
The box-sum criterion is exactly what we need to prove some familiar and
important—but otherwise elusive—results.
Theorem 5.15. If f is continuous on [a, b], then f is integrable, too.
The proof idea. Continuity means that f cannot rise or fall very much over a
small domain interval. Thus, for a partition with small norm, all box sum elements
must be short. Since the total width of boxes is only (b −a), their total area must
also be small.
Proof: Let ǫ > 0 be given. Because f is continuous on [a, b], it is also uni-
formly continuous there, according to Theorem 3.22, page 184. This means we
can choose δ > 0 such that

More on integrability. We can use the box-sum criterion to prove other familiar,
reasonable-seeming properties of the integral. Proposition 5.16 gives two sam-
ples.

Proof (sketch): The main proof challenge for both (i) and (ii) turns out to be inte-
grability: We need to show that if f is integrable on [a, b], then it is also integrable
on the smaller intervals [a, c] and on [c, b], and that |f| is also integrable on [a, b].
Once all the integrals in question are known to exist, the rest is easy. The equa-
tion in (i) is essentially Theorem 5.8, page 274. See Problem 7, page 279, for the
inequality in (ii).
Proving our integrability claims directly from the deﬁnition of integrability
would be difﬁcult. With the box-sum criterion, the proof is routine.
We don’t even have candidates
for the values of the integrals.
Let ǫ > 0 be given. By Theorem 5.14, applied to the integral

Let’s show ﬁrst that
R c
a f and

c f exist. We may as well assume that c ∈P;
if not, we can add c to P without increasing the box sum. Thus, P has the form
Sketch the situation to convince
yourself.
P = {a = x0, x1, . . . , xm = c, xm+1, . . . , xn = b},
and therefore
P1 = {a = x0, x1, . . . , xm = c}
and
P2 = {c = xm, xm+1, . . . , xn = b}
are, respectively, partitions of [a, c] and [b, c]. Because P1 and P2 are subsets of
P, and all box summands are nonnegative, the box sums for P1 and P2 are clearly
smaller than that for P. By Theorem 5.14, f is indeed integrable on each smaller
interval.
To show that |f| is also integrable on [a, b], we compare box sums for f and
|f|. Figure 5.7 illustrates the nice answer: For any partition P of [a, b],
box sum for |f| ≤box sum for f.
In Figure 5.7(a), box-sum elements that “straddle” the x-axis become smaller for
|f|, as shown in Figure 5.7(b). Thus any partition for f with box sum less than ǫ
works for |f|, too.

with m and M as lower and upper bounds.
If P is a regular partition with norm δ, then the box sum elements can be
“stacked” vertically as shown, to give total area less than (M −m)δ. By choosing
δ small, we can keep the box sum as small as we like.

the given integrand is monotone.
♦
Proving the Box-Sum Criterion
Theorem 5.14 has both an “if” and an “only if” part. We start with the latter—
easier—assertion.
Why the box-sum criterion is necessary. Suppose f is integrable on [a, b]; let
I =

for every Riemann sum RS (f, P, S) based on a partition P with ∥P∥< δ and
samples S drawn from P. Now let P be any such partition; this P will do what
A regular partition will do.
we want.
To see why, note ﬁrst that the upper sum US (f, P), although perhaps not a
Riemann sum itself, is the supremum of all possible Riemann sums based on P.
In particular, we can choose a set of samples S from P so that
RS (f, P, S) > US (f, P) −ǫ
4,
and so we have
US (f, P) < RS (f, P, S) + ǫ
4 < I + ǫ
4 + ǫ
4 = I + ǫ
2.
A similar argument shows that
LS (f, P) > I −ǫ
2,
and so
box sum = US (f, P) −LS (f, P) < ǫ,
as we wanted to show.
Why the box-sum criterion is sufﬁcient. The plan of the proof is to use the box-
sum condition to obtain the “Cauchy criterion” of Lemma 5.10, page 281, which
in turn implies integrability. We show, in fact, that if for given ǫ > 0 we can ﬁnd
some partition P0 with small box sum, then there exists some (very small!) δ > 0
such that every partition P with ∥P∥< δ must also have small box sum, and this
does the trick.
One picky technical lemma will prove useful. We leave its straightforward

started.
proof as an exercise.
Lemma 5.18. Let f : [a, b] →R be a bounded function, with m ≤f(x) ≤M
for x ∈[a, b]. Let P be a partition of [a, b] with ∥P∥< δ, and let US = US (f, P)
and LS = LS (f, P) be the corresponding upper and lower sums.
Adding one more point to P produces new upper and lower sums, USnew and
LSnew, such that
(i) USnew ≤US
and
LSnew ≥LS;
(ii) US −USnew < (M −m)δ
and
LSnew −LS < (M −m)δ.

290
5. Integrals
In words: Adding one point to P decreases upper sums and increases lower
sums—but by no more than (M −m)δ.
Now we can prove that the box-sum condition implies integrability. For given
ǫ > 0, we ﬁrst choose any particular partition
P0 = {w0, w1, . . . , wN} ,
of [a, b] with N partition points and box sum less than ǫ/2; that is,
US (f, P0) −LS (f, P0) < ǫ
2.
Next we set
δ =
ǫ
4(N −1)(M −m),
where M and m are, respectively, upper and lower bounds for f on [a, b]. This δ
will turn out to work in Lemma 5.10.
Unlikely as that may seem in
advance.
Now let P be any partition of [a, b] with ∥P∥< δ. Consider the new partition
P′ formed from P by adding in the N −1 partition points w1, w2, ..., wN−1.
(Since w0 = a and wN = b, adding them to P has no effect.)
Now Lemma 5.18(i) implies that
US (f, P′) ≤US (f, P0) ,
because P′ “reﬁnes” P0. Because P′ has at most N −1 more points than P,
Lemma 5.18(ii) says that
US (f, P′) > US (f, P) −(N −1) · (M −m) · δ
= US (f, P) −ǫ
4.
Putting these inequalities together gives
US (f, P) < US (f, P′) + ǫ
4 ≤US (f, P0) + ǫ
4.
A similar argument shows that
LS (f, P) < LS (f, P0) + ǫ
4.
All these inequalities boil down saying that, for any partition P with ∥P∥< δ,
both the upper and lower sums LS (f, P) and US (f, P) lie in the interval

which has length less than ǫ. In particular, every Riemann sum RS(f, P, S) is
between LS (f, P) and US (f, P), and therefore lies in the same interval.
Finally, we observe that if both P1 and P2 are partitions of [a, b] with both
∥P1∥< δ and ∥P2∥< δ, and if samples S1 and S2 come from P1 and P2,
respectively, then both RS(f, P1, S1) and RS(f, P2, S2) lie in the same interval
of length less than ǫ, and are thus within ǫ of each other. Thus the hypothesis of

11. Show that if f : [a, b] →R is a bounded function, P is a partition of [a, b],
and S is any sampling set from P, then
LS (f, P) ≤RS (f, P, S) ≤US (f, P) .
Note: This is (i) of Proposition 5.12; it says that for any partition P, the cor-
responding upper and lower sums are upper and lower bounds, respectively,
for the set of all Riemann sums associated with P.
12. Give a “picture proof” of Lemma 5.18, page 289. (Hint: Adding one more
point to a partition changes only one box sum element. Convince yourself
that this change is no more than the claimed amount.)
13. Show that if R b
a f = I exists, and P is any partition of [a, b], then
LS (f, P) ≤I ≤US (f, P) .
Note: This is (ii) of Proposition 5.12; it says that, for any partition P, the
corresponding upper and lower sums “trap” the exact value of I from above
and below.

Some Fundamental Theorems
We met a useful but preliminary version of the fundamental theorem of calculus
(Theorem 5.9, page 275) in Section 5.2. Using Theorem 5.15, page 285, we can
now tie up a serious loose end—existence of the integral—in connecting integrals
and derivatives. Here is a new, improved version:

5.4. Some Fundamental Theorems
293
Theorem 5.19 (Fundamental theorem of calculus, version 1). Let f : [a, b] →
R be continuous, and suppose F ′(x) = f(x) for all x ∈[a, b]. Then f is inte-
grable on [a, b], and
Z b
a
f = F(b) −F(a).
Proof: We’ve already done all the hard work. By Theorem 5.15, the integral
R b
a f exists, and Theorem 5.9 guarantees that the integral’s value is indeed F(b)−
F(a).
□
Elementary calculus revisited. Theorem 5.19 makes precise a sense in which
integration and differentiation are inverse processes. Now that we know it, we
can assert standard calculations of elementary calculus, like this one—
Z 1
0
x2 dx = x3
3
1
0
= 1
3 −0,
with perfect conﬁdence.
EXAMPLE 1.
Find
R π
0 sin x dx exactly.
SOLUTION.
Nothing could be easier. If f(x) = sin x, then F(x) = −cos(x) is
an antiderivative, and so
Z π
0
sin x dx = −cos(π) + cos(0) = 2.
Having worked very hard to build the machine, we now only need to turn the
crank.
♦
EXAMPLE 2.
Find
R π
0 sin(x2) dx.
SOLUTION.
The problem superﬁcially resembles the one in Example 1, and it
would be nice to proceed in the same way. But there is a problem: f(x) = sin(x2)
has no nice antiderivative formula F(x) into which we can plug endpoints. We
can always estimate the answer numerically, but that is less satisfying.
♦
It’s about 0.773.
Antiderivatives do exist. The difﬁculty in Example 2 notwithstanding, the inte-
grand f(x) = sin(x2) there does have an antiderivative—it just doesn’t happen
to be expressible in simple symbolic form. Indeed, every continuous function has
antiderivatives, and another version of the fundamental theorem of calculus says
why.

294
5. Integrals
Theorem 5.20 (Fundamental theorem of calculus, version 2). Let f : [a, b] →
R be continuous. Deﬁne a new function F by
F(x) =
Z x
a
f
for all x ∈[a, b].
Then F ′(c) = f(c) for all c ∈(a, b).
Proof: Note ﬁrst that F(x) is deﬁned for all x ∈[a, b]. Part (i) of Proposi-
tion 5.16, page 286. says so, as does the fact that f is continuous on all subinter-
vals [a, x].
Fix c ∈(a, b); we’ll show F ′(c) = f(c). By deﬁnition,
F ′(c) = lim
h→0
F(c + h) −F(c)
h
.
if the limit exists. We’ll show that
lim
h→0+
F(c + h) −F(c)
h
= f(c);
the proof for the left-hand limit (where h →0−) is similar.
For any h > 0, we have, from basic properties of the integral,
F(c + h) −F(c)
h
=
R c+h
a
f −
R c
a f
h
=
R c+h
c
f
h
.
Since f is continuous on [c, c + h], it assumes maximum and minimum values,
say Mh and mh, on this interval. Because mh ≤f(x) ≤Mh for x ∈[c, c + h],
it follows that
mh · h =
Z c+h
c
mh dx ≤
Z c+h
c
f(x) dx ≤
Z c+h
c
Mh dx = Mh · h,
and therefore
mh ≤
R c+h
c
f
h
≤Mh.
This means, in turn, that the middle quantity is “intermediate” between mh and
Mh for the continuous function f. Thus, by the intermediate value theorem, there
exists some input xh with c < xh < c + h and
R c+h
c
f
h
= f(xh).
As h →0+, we have xh →c, and since f is continuous at c, we have
lim
h→0+
R c+h
c
f
h
= lim
h→0+ f(xh) = f(c),
as desired.

is automatically differentiable and hence also continuous.) This is nice to know in
the abstract—but not helpful for calculating integrals like the one in Example 2.
Indeed, many useful and harmless-looking calculus functions, including
cos(x2),

and

Average values, and another mean value theorem. Integration has a natural
connection to averaging.
Deﬁnition 5.21. If f is integrable on [a, b], then the average value of f on [a, b] is
given by
average value =
R b
a f
b −a.
Embedded in the proof of Theorem 5.20 is another theorem (and its proof) of
independent interest.
Theorem 5.22 (Mean value theorem for integrals). If f is continuous on [a, b],
then there exists c in (a, b) for which
Z b
a
f = f(c) · (b −a).
In words: a continuous function on [a, b] assumes its average value.
We explore some implications in the exercises.
Exercises
1. Show that if

R b
a h = 0. Use Theorem 5.20 to show that h(x) = 0 for
all x ∈[a, b]. (Hint: Use properties of the function H(x) = R x
a h to derive
the result.)
7. Let f be continuous on [a, b]. Suppose that the average value and the maxi-
mum value of f on [a, b] are equal. Show that f is constant. Must the same

any interval [a, b] is f(m), where m is the midpoint of [a, b].
11. Find an interval [a, b] such that the average value of f(x) = x2 occurs at

9. Assume toward contradiction that
√
3 = a/b for integers a and b, where a/b is in
reduced form. Then squaring both sides gives 3b2 = a2. This implies (essentially
as in the proof of Theorem 1.2) that 3 divides both a and b, which contradicts the
assumption that a/b is in reduced form.
11. Parts (i) and (ii) follow from the fact that 1 < a/b < 2. For part (iii), note that
a′2
b′2 = (2b −a)2
(a −b)2 = 4b2 −4ab + a2
a2 −2ab + b2 ,
and substituting a2 = 2b2 shows that the last fraction is 2.
This all shows that if
√
2 = a/b holds for any positive integers a and b, then we can
ﬁnd a new fraction a′/b′ with
√
2 = a′/b′ and b′ < b, which is absurd.
13. Matrix addition in M2×2 is commutative, but multiplication is not; examples are
easy to ﬁnd. Every matrix A in M2×2 has an additive inverse −A, but multiplicative
inverses exist only for some nonzero matrices (those with nonzero determinant);
again, examples are easy to ﬁnd. Distributivity does indeed hold in M2×2.
15. Since ln ln ln n tends to inﬁnity, it must exceed two for large n. The well-ordering
property guarantees that a smallest such n0 exists. (Using a calculator we can see
that n0 has about 703 decimal digits.)

(e) R \ A = {0}
5. To say that a is in R \ (R \ A) means that a is not in R \ A; this means, in turn that
a ∈A.
7. We know R \ A1 = (−∞, 1] ∪[3, ∞) and R \ A2 = (−∞, 2] ∪[5, ∞). Also,
R \ (A1 ∩A2) = (−∞, 2] ∪[3, ∞) and R \ (A1 ∪A2) = (−∞, 1] ∪[5, ∞).
It’s easy to see that, as claimed, R \ (A1 ∩A2) = (−∞, 2] ∪[3, ∞) = (−∞, 1] ∪
[3, ∞) ∪(−∞, 2] ∪[5, ∞) = (R \ A1) ∪(R \ A2). Similarly, R \ (A1 ∪A2) =

13. It’s easy for I and R \ I to be intervals. For instance, if I = (−∞, 0), then
R \ I = [0, ∞) is another interval. I and R \ I cannot both be bounded intervals;

q ∈I ⊆. But I ⊆Q is impossible.
(d) If (0, 1] were open there would be an open interval I with 1 ∈I ⊆(0, 1].
That’s impossible—every such I includes points “to the right” of x = 1. A
similar argument with 0 ∈R\(0, 1] shows that R\(0, 1] isn’t open, so (0, 1]

same mother. The function is not surjective, either, since some women are
not mothers.
(b) Let A be the set of all mothers of sons, and B the set of all male humans.
Then FIRSTBORNSON : A →B is one-to-one but not onto.
(c) Let A be the set of all humans and B the set of all colors. Then EYECOLOR :
A →B is neither one-to-one nor onto, since several people have blue eyes,
and nobody has silver eyes.
(d) Let A be the set of all US citizens and B = {January 1, January 2, . . . , December 31}.
Then BIRTHDAY : A →B is onto (every day is someone’s birthday) but not

(d) Here f(1/

9. It’s reasonable to use f : (0, ∞) →(−∞, ∞) and g : (−∞, ∞) →(0, ∞).
Graphs of f and g are mirror images across the line y = x. We have f(g(x)) = x

(b) f is one-to-one because no two elements of G have the same second coor-
dinate. f is onto because every element of B is the second coordinate of an

(d) We might call these functions VOWELNUMBER and NUMBEROFVOWL, or

(a) One approach is to look at the graph. Or note that L(x) = L(y) means that

Also, for any b ∈R we can set a = (b −2)/3, and see that f(a) = b. Thus
L is onto.

(a) That MOD5 is reﬂexive and symmetric is obvious. To see it’s transitive, sup-

xMOD5z.
(b) The equivalence class [0] is the set {. . . , −10, −5, 0, 5, 10, . . . } of multiples

(d) False; p = 11 is a counterexample.
(e) False; x = 0 and y = 1/2 is a counterexample.
3. The claim is obvious for n = 1. Given F = {x1, x2, . . . , xn}, consider F ′ =
{x1, x2, . . . , xn−1}. By the inductive hypothesis F ′ has a largest member, say
xn−1. The largest member of F is then xn if xn > xn−1, and xn−1 otherwise.
5.
(a) If n = 1, then both sides have value 1; if n = 10, then both sides are 100.
(b) The base case, P(1), holds as indicated in (a).
For the inductive step we assume P(n) and try to prove P(n + 1), which is
the claim that 1 + 2 + · · · + (n + 1) = (n + 1)(n + 2)/2. We start by adding
(n + 1) to both sides of P(n), and then do algebra:
1 + 2 + 3 + · · · + n + (n + 1) = n(n + 1)

7. Prove this by induction. The base case n = 1 is clear. For the inductive step,
suppose that (1 + x)k ≥1 + kx for a particular k. Multiplying both sides by
(1 + x) and doing a little algebra shows that (1 + x)k+1 ≥1 + (k + 1)x, as
desired.

(a) Rewrite f1f2f3 as (f1f2)f3 and use the ordinary product rule twice.

ductive step, we write f1f2f3 · · · fn+1 = (f1f2f3 · · · fn)fn+1 and apply the
ordinary product rule.

13. Note ﬁrst that P(n) is obviously true for the base case n = 4; just check both sides.
To complete the inductive proof, we assume P(n) (for n ≥4) and show P(n + 1).
By P(n), we have 2n < n!. We know also that 2 < (n + 1). Multiplying these
inequalities gives
2n < n! =⇒2n+1 < n!(n + 1) = (n + 1)!.
This shows that P(n + 1) holds, and we’re done.
15. The base case is an assumption. (We’ll prove it later in the course.) The inductive
step follows readily from the product rule.
17. Among small amounts, it’s clear we can pay out $3, $5, $6, $8, $9. In fact, we can
pay all numbers greater than $9, too. Here’s an informal inductive proof. Note ﬁrst
that the base case $10 is clearly possible. Suppose we can pay out all amounts from
$10 to $k. To show $k + 1 is also possible, note that k + 1 −3 = k −2 ≥8, so
$k −2 is payable. Adding one more $3 bill brings the total to $k.

Sets 103: Finite and Inﬁnite Sets; Cardinality
1. Here’s a sketch: The base case is given. For the inductive step, write F1 ∪F2 ∪
· · · ∪Fn = (F1 ∪F2 ∪· · · ∪Fn−1) ∪Fn and use the inductive hypothesis.
3.
(a) f(x) = 7x −2 is one-to-one: If f(a) = f(b), then 7a −2 = 7b −2, which
implies a = b. g(x) = x/(1 + x) is also one-to-one: if g(a) = g(b), then
a/(1 + a) = b/(1 + b). A little algebra (do it—keep in mind that a and b are
positive) shows that a = b.
(b) For any b ∈R we can set a = (b+2)/7 and see that f(a) = b. If b ∈(−2, 5)
then b + 2 ∈(0, 7) and (b + 2)/7 ∈(0, 1) as desired.
(c) We know that both f and g are one-to-one and onto; it follows (from one of
our theorems) that f ◦g is one-to-one and onto. This means (among other
things) that all of the sets under consideration here have the same cardinality.
5. f can be one-to-one but g cannot. The latter holds by the pigeonhole principle,
since g tries, in effect, to put 43 pigeons into 42 holes.
7.
(a) The function f : N →N given by f(n) = n + 1 works.
(b) The function g : R →R given by g(x) = arctan x works.
(c) Deﬁne h : R →R by h(x) = x if x /∈N and h(x) = x + 1 if x ∈N.
9. Proof by contradiction. If the hypotheses hold and A \ B is ﬁnite, then A = (A \
B) ∪B is the union of two ﬁnite sets, and hence ﬁnite itself. This is absurd.
11.
(a) Members of Q3 correspond to (some of the) points (p, q) with integer coordi-
nates inside the circle p2 + q2 = 3—there are nine such points (p, q). Since
we’re interested in fractions p/q, we may as well require q > 0. This reduces
the eligible points to just three: (−1, 1), (0, 1), and (1, 1), all of which give
different reduced fractions p/q.

Note that Q4 is the same set as Q3.
For Q10, similar reasoning ﬁnds 11 points (p, q) with q > 0 and p2+q2 < 10.
These 11 points correspond to 7 different rational numbers: ±2, ±1, ±0.5,
and 0.
(b) If p/q ∈Qi, then clearly both |p| < i and |q| < i. There are at most 2i −1
choices for each of p and q, and so no more that (2i −1)2 choices for both
p and q. (In fact, the number of choices is less, but that’s OK for present
purposes.) An even rougher (but simpler-looking) upper bound is that Qi has
fewer than 4i2 elements.
(c) All parts are straightforward implications of the deﬁnitions.
13. As one possible bijection f : [0, ∞) →(0, ∞) we can deﬁne f(x) = x + 1 if
x ∈Z and f(x) = x otherwise.
15. The set B is countably inﬁnite. The set Bn of n-character books is clearly ﬁnite for
each n, and B is the union of the (countably many) Bn.
17. Different approaches are possible. In the case discussed, it’s fun to see that, in bi-
nary digit notation, h(0.1stuff) = 0.01stuff, h(0.01stuff) = 0.1stuff, h(0.001stuff)
= 0.0001stuff, h(0.0001stuff) = 0.001stuff, etc.

(c) Yes. A famous trigonometric identity says that sin(x)2 + cos(x)2 = 1 for all

2.93 = 2.11 = K.

1. Following are sketches.
(a) Say m ≤t ≤M for all t ∈T . If s ∈S, then s ∈T , too, so m ≤s ≤M.
Thus S is bounded.
(c) If |S| is bounded, then |s| < K for all s ∈S and some K > 0. But then
−K < s < K for all s ∈S, so S is bounded. The converse is similar.

5.
(a) We have 1 = e0 ≤f(x) = ex ≤e10 and −1 ≤g(x) = sin(x) ≤1 for

is unbounded above on R, and (ii) g(x) = sin(x) is bounded below by −1
and above by 1 on all of R.
(b) For f ◦g: When x ∈[0, 10] we have 0.37 ≈e−1 ≤esin(x) ≤e1 ≈2.72.
For g ◦f: When x ∈[0, 10] we have −1 ≤sin(ex) ≤1.
7. Since A is bounded we know that −M ≤x ≤M for some M > 0 and all x ∈A.
But then also −3M + 5 ≤3x + 5 = f(x) ≤3M + 5 for all x ∈A, as desired.

(a) The shortest English words have one letter, so 1 is a lower bound for f on EW.

(a) All subsets S ⊆R have this property
(b) The given property means that S is bounded.
(c) For all s ∈S, |s| ≥1.
15.
(a) The maximum value is f(0) = 1; the minimum is f(±K) = 1/(K + 1).
(b) The graph is a parabola with vertex at x = −1/3, so the maximum occurs
at the r ight endpoint; g(K) = 3K2 + 2K −7. If K ≥1/3, then −2/3 ∈
[−K, K], and so the minimum value is g(−1/3) = −22/3. If K < 1/3 then
the minimum occurs at x = −K, and the value is g(−K) = 3K2 −2K −7.
(c) Note that h(x) = 1 + x, so the function is largest at the right endpoint
(h(K) = 1 + K) and smallest at the left (h(−K) = 1 −K).
17.
(a) S = (1, ∞) is one possibility; there are many.

δ , so T is bounded. The
proof of the converse is similar.
(c) If S is bounded away from 0 then—by deﬁnition—S has no points in common
with the interval (−δ, δ), which is of the desired form. If, conversely, S has
nothing in common with (a, b), where a < 0 < b, then we can take δ to be
the smaller of −a and b.

(a) If a /∈I, then either a < 0 or a > 1. In the former case, we can take
δ = −a/2; in the latter, δ = (a −1)/2 works.
(b) The points 2 and 3 are not in J, but J is not bounded away from either 2 or 3.
(c) N does indeed have the property in question: if a /∈N. then we can take δ to
be the distance to the nearest integer.

Now use property (ii) of h.

less than 2. This contradicts the supremum property of β.

3. Suppose toward contradiction that L > b. Set ǫ = b −L and choose N as in the

11. Here’s a sketch. Let ǫ > 0 be given, and set ǫ′ = ǫ/17. Since ǫ′ > 0 we can choose

13. Suppose {an} is decreasing. Since {an} is bounded, this set has an inﬁmum; call
it L. To see L is also the limit, let ǫ > 0 be given. Because L is the inﬁmum,
L + ǫ is not a lower bound for {an}, and so there is some aN with L + ǫ > aN.
This N “works”: If n > N, then an ≤aN (because {an} is decreasing) and so
L ≤aN < L + ǫ, as desired.
15. Suppose xn →5. To show yn →0, let ǫ > 0 be given. Since xn →5 we can

|can −ca| = |c| |an −a| < ǫ ⇐⇒|an −a| < ǫ
|c|.
Now for any given ǫ > 0, we can choose N so that |an −a| < ǫ/|c| for n > N.

{can}. (Assemble the pieces into an efﬁcient proof.)

{hn} is unbounded. Since h1 = 1, the inequality means that h2 ≥1.5, h4 ≥2.0,
h8 ≥2.5, h21000 > 501, etc.
13.
(a) Let M > 0 be given. Since xn →∞, we can choose N so xn > M
whenever n > N. But then also −xn < −M when n > N. Thus −xn →
−∞.
(b) Suppose xn →∞. Let ǫ > 0 be given; we need to ﬁnd N so n > N implies
 1
xn
 =
1
xn < ǫ. Well, if we set M = 1/ǫ then (since xn →∞) we can
choose N so n > N implies xn > M = 1/ǫ. But this implies 1/xn < ǫ, as
desired.
(c) Suppose xn < 0 for all n. Then xn →−∞if and only if 1/xn →0. This
follows from parts (a) and (b): xn →−∞⇐⇒−xn →∞⇐⇒−1
xn →
0 ⇐⇒
1
xn →0.
15.
(a) The limit is 2/5.
(b) The sequence diverges to ∞.
(c) The sequence converges to 1/2.
(d) The sequence diverges to ∞. One strategy is to observe that n2+arctan n
n+2

n2−4
n+2 = n −2.
17.
(a) One possibility is to let an = (−1)n and bn = (−1)n+1 for all n.
(b) We’ll show that cn →max{a, b}.
One approach is to use the curious fact (which appears in a later section) that
for any numbers an and bn,
cn = max{an, bn} = an + bn + |an −bn|
2
.
Invoking Theorem 2.5 (on algebra with convergent sequences) and Proposi-
tion 2.7.b (on how absolute values play nicely with limits) we see that
cn = an + bn + |an −bn|
2
converges to c = a + b + |a −b|
2
= max{a, b},
as desired.
Here is another approach. We assume WLOG that a ≤b and show that
cn →b.
Suppose ﬁrst that a = b. Then for given ǫ > 0 we can choose Na and Nb
such that n > Na implies |an −b| < ǫ, and n > Nb implies |bn −b| < ǫ.

Selected Solutions
Let N = max{ Na, Nb }. If n > N, then we have both |an −b| < ǫ and
|bn −b| < ǫ. Now recall that, for all n, either cn = an or cn = bn. Thus
|cn −b| < ǫ for all n > N, and we’re done.
The other possibility is that a < b. Set ǫ = b−a
2
and choose N (as above) so
that both |an −a| < ǫ and |bn −b| < ǫ hold whenever n > N. This means
(draw a picture if this isn’t clear) that an < bn for all n > N. In other words
cn = bn for all n > N, and so surely {cn} and {bn} converge to the same
limit, b.
19.
(a) We have x1 = 1, x2 = 2, x3 = 3/2, x4 = 5/3, x5 = 8/5, x6 = 13/8,
x7 = 21/13, x8 = 34/21. Note the connection to the Fibonacci sequence
1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, . . . . The sequence is not monotone, but has the pattern
x1 < x2 > x3 < x4 > x5 < . . . .
(b) We know xn+1 = 1 + 1
xn . Since {xn} converges to L we can take limits on
both sides to get L = 1 + 1/L. Solving for L gives L2 −L −1 = 0. The
quadratic formula says L = (1 ±
√
5)/2; from context it’s clear we want the
positive root L ≈1.61803.
21.
(a) Check ﬁrst that since x1 = 3, we have 1 < xn < 4 for all n. Also, xn+1 =
(x2
n + 4)/5 < xn ⇐⇒x2
n −5xn + 4 < 0, and it’s easy to see that this
holds when 1 < xn < 4.
(b) The sequence {xn} converges because it’s monotone and bounded.
(c) Because the sequence converges, we must have L = (L2 + 4)/5, so L = 1
or L = 4. In context it’s clear that L = 1.
23. We’ll show |xn/yn| →0. (Why is this enough?) First choose M > 0 such that
|xn| < M for all n. (Why can we do this?) Now choose ǫ > 0. Since yn →∞
we can ﬁnd N so that n > N implies |yn| > M
ǫ . (Why can we do this?) This N
works for the sequence {|xn/yn|}: If n > N, then

xn
yn
 < M
yn <

M/ǫ = ǫ.
2.3
Subsequences
1.
(a) The sequence 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, . . . works.
(b) The sequence 1, −1, 1/2, −1/2, 1/3, −1/3, . . . works.
(c) The sequence 0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 3, . . . works.
(d) The sequence 1, 1, 1/2, 2, 1/3, 3, . . . works.
(e) The sequence 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 4, . . . works.
3.
(a) Given a sequence that lists the rationals, we can just form the subsequence of
nonnegative rationals.
(b) Look at any two successive terms, say p1 and p2. Between these two rational
numbers like other rationals. If the sequence were monotone, these other
rationals would lie between p1 and p2 in the sequence.

(c) We can choose n1 so that pn1 = 1. Then we choose n2 with n2 > n1 and
pn2 ≥2. Continuing this process completes the proof; details are left to the
reader.
5. In general it’s possible for a subsequence to behave differently from its parent.
The point here is that this particular kind of subsequence—the “tail” of a given
sequence—behaves in a more special way.
Here’s the idea: Let ǫ > 0 be given, and suppose that some N1, say N1 = 1000,
works for the subsequence. Note that the 1001th term of the subsequence is x5242,
and we know that from then on, all terms of the subsequence are within ǫ of L. But
this is just another way of saying that all terms past x5242 in the original sequence
are within ǫ of L; that is N = 5242 works for the given ǫ in the parent sequence.
In general, if N1 works for the subsequence, then N = 4242 + N1 works in the
parent sequence. Clean this up a little to get an impeccable proof.
7. Statements (a), (c), (e), and (f) are all equivalent to each other. Statements (b) and
(d) are also equivalent.
9.
(a) The sequence 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 3, . . . is one example.
(b) The statement xn →3 means that, for every ǫ > 0, all but ﬁnitely many
xn are within ǫ of 3. Negating this condition means that, for some ǫ > 0,
inﬁnitely many xn are at leastǫ away from 3. These {xn} can be taken in
order to give the desired subsequence.
11.
(a) For M > 0, choose N such that xn > M whenever n > N. The same N
works for the subsequence {xnk}, since if k > N, then nk ≥k > N, and
so xnk > M, as desired.
(b) The contrapositive of Theorem 2.12(a) says that if some subsequence {xnk}
does not converge to L, then the original sequence {xn} doesn’t converge to
L either. This implies Theorem 2.12(c), because if L is any number, then at
least one subsequence fails to converge to L, and so L can’t be the limit.
13. The sequence {x11, x101, x1001, . . . } does the job. For this sequence we have
nk = 10k + 1.
15. Notice ﬁrst that zn = bn/2 for even n and zn = a(n+1)/2 for odd n. In particular,
both sequences {an} and {bn} are subsequences of {zn}, so if zn →L we must
have an →L and bn →L, too.
For the converse, we suppose that both an →L and bn →L. Let ǫ > 0 be
given. We can choose N1 and N2 such that n > N1
=⇒
|an −L| < ǫ, and
n > N2
=⇒|bn −L| < ǫ. Now let N = 2 max{N1, N2}. This N “works”
for {zn}, because if n > N and n is even, then n/2 > N ≥N2, so |zn −L| =
|bn/2 −L| < ǫ. Similarly, if n > N and n is odd, then (n + 1)/2 > N ≥N1, so
|zn −L| = |a(n+1)/2 −L| < ǫ.
2.4
Cauchy Sequences
1.
(a) For given ǫ > 0 we can choose N = 2/ǫ. This N works because if m, n > N
then |xn −xm| ≤|xn| + |xm| = 1
n + 1
m < ǫ
2 + ǫ
2 = ǫ.

316
Selected Solutions
(b) The sequence is not Cauchy. If we choose, say ǫ = 0.001, then no N works,
since if N is any positive number, no matter how big, then with m = N + 1
and n = N + 2 we have |yn −ym| = 2/1234 > 0.001.
(c) The sequence is Cauchy.
Note that if n > m, we have |zn −zm| =

n
n + 1
m
m + 1
 =
n −m
(n + 1)(m + 1) < n −m
nm
<
n
nm = 1
m. It follows
that for ǫ > 0 we can choose N = 1/ǫ.
(d) The sequence is Cauchy. If n > m, we have |wn −wm| =

sin n
n2 + 1−
sin m
m2 + 1
 ≤

sin n
n2 + 1

m2 + 1 <
2
m2 , and
2
m2 < ǫ if
m >
p
2/ǫ. Thus, N =
p
2/ǫ works in the deﬁnition.
3. For ǫ > 0 choose N that works for ǫ in the sense of Deﬁnition 2.17. This same N
works in the deﬁnition of convergence to zero. To see why, let m > N be given.
Then choose any n of the form n = 10k, with n > m (n = 10m is one possibility).
Then we have n > m > N, and so |xm −xn| = |xm −0| < ǫ, as desired.
5.
(a) Any sequence of rationals tending to an irrational will do.
(b) Yes. The only Cauchy sequences of integers are eventually constant.
(c) [0, 1] is complete because if {xn} is any Cauchy sequence in [0, 1], then {xn}
tends to some limit L. Because 0 ≤xn ≤1 for all n, the limit L is in [0, 1],
too.
(0, 1] is not complete because {1/n} is a Cauchy sequence in (0, 1], but its
limit lies outside (0, 1].
7. Let ǫ > 0 be given and set ǫ′ = ǫ/42. Because {an} is Cauchy sequence there
is some N such that |an −am| < ǫ′ whenever n > N. This N works for the
sequence {xn}; details left to you.
9. Use the fact that two numbers with the same ﬁrst n decimal places can differ by no
more than 10−n.

Series 101: Basic Ideas
1.
(a) Sn = 0 for all n, and so the series converges to 0.
(b) Sn = 42n for all n; this diverges (to ∞).
(c) The partial sum sequence {Sn} has the form −1, 0, −1, 0, . . . ; this di-
verges.
(d) Sn = n(n + 1)
2
for all n; this diverges (to ∞).

(e) The series is geometric, with r = 0.99, so Sn = 1 −rn
1 −r = 100−100·0.99n,
and Sn →100.
(f) One shows by induction that Sn =
n
n + 1. Thus Sn →1.
3.
(a) Since H2n > n
2 for all n and the right-had sequence diverges to inﬁnity, we
must have H2n →∞, too. Since {Hn} has a divergent subsequence, {Hn}
must diverge, too.
(b) Suppose toward contradiction that Hn →H for some ﬁnite number H. Since
{H2n} is a subsequence, we’d have H2n →H, too. But we also have H2n >
1
2 + Hn; taking limits of both sides gives H ≥1
2 + H, which is absurd.

7. Let P ak and P bk be series, and let P ck be the “sum series,” deﬁned by ck =
ak + bk for all k. Let An, Bn, and Cn denote the partial sums for these series.
The key point is that—thanks to the commutative law for addition of ﬁnitely many
numbers—Cn = An + Bn for all n. It follows that if An →A and Bn →B, then
we must also have Cn →A + B, which is what we wanted to prove.
9.
(a) It’s enough to show (i) if n > 1000 then Sn ≥S1000; (ii) if n > 1000 then
Sn ≤S1001. Claim (i) amounts to observing that every string of the form
1
1001 −
1
1002 +
1
1003 −· · · ±

1000 + n adds up to a positive result; group

1003 −

1000 + n has negative sum; again,
group summands in pairs to see why.
(b) For given ǫ > 0 we can take any integer N ≥1/ǫ. Then |SN −SN+1| =
1
N + 1 < ǫ.
(c) For given ǫ > 0 choose N as in the preceding part. Then for n > m > N
we have both Sn and Sm between SN and SN+1, and thus within ǫ of each
other.
11.
(a) Let An and Bn be the partial sums for P ak and P bk. The hypothesis boils
down to the fact that for n > 42 we have Bn = An −A42 + B42. Thus, the
sequences {An} and {Bn} differ (for large n) by an additive constant, and
so both converge or both diverge.

(b) We know (see the preceding part) that Bn = An −A42 + B42. Because
bk −ak = k2, we must have B42 −A42 =

Bn = An + 25585, and since An →100 we must have Bn →25685.

3.1
Limits of Functions
1. Both parts are easy exercises with the deﬁnition. In (a) we can choose any δ for
given ǫ. In (b) we can choose δ = ǫ.
3.
(a) lim
x→1(2x + 3) = 5. Note that |f(x) −5| = 2, |x −1|. It follows that for
given ǫ > 0 we can set δ = ǫ/2.
(b) Factoring the numerator gives lim
x→−1
x2 −1
x + 1 =
lim
x→−1(x −1) = −2. (For
given ǫ > 0 we can set δ = ǫ.)
5.
(a) For f(x) = x2, we have lim
x→42 f(x) =
lim
x→42 x2 = 422 = f(42), so the
condition does hold at a = 42.
(b) For f(x) = x2 and any input a, we have lim
x→a f(x) = lim
x→a x2 = a2 = f(a),
so the condition holds at every a.
(c) Since the function f(x) = x2−4
x−2 is not deﬁned at a = 2, the condition can’t
possibly hold.
(d) We have lim
x→3 f(x) = lim
x→3
x2 −4
x −2 = 32 −4
3 −1 = f(3), as desired.
7. Let {xn} be any sequence with xn →a and xn ̸= a for all n. Then {f(xn)},
{g(xn)}, and {h(xn)} are all sequences, and the hypotheses imply that (i) f(xn) ≤

version of the squeezing theorem implies that g(xn) →L, too. Since this applies

to any sequence {xn} of the given type, Lemma 3.2 implies that lim
x→a g(x) = L, as
desired.
9.
(a) We say
lim
x→−∞f(x) = L if for all ǫ > 0 there exists M < 0 such that
|f(x) −L| < ǫ whenever x < M.
(b) We say
lim
x→0−g(x) = L if for all ǫ > 0 there exists δ > 0 such that
|g(x) −L| < ǫ whenever −δ < x < 0.
(c) Here’s the idea of a proof that
lim
x→−∞f(x) = L implies that lim
x→0−f(1/x) =
L. The converse is proved similarly.
Let ǫ > 0 be given. We want to show that |f(1/x) −L| < ǫ for x in some
interval (δ, 0). By hypothesis, there is some M < 0 so that |f(t) −L| < ǫ
when t < M. Writing t = 1/x, this means that |f(1/x) −L| < ǫ when
1/x < M < 0, or, equivalently, when 0 > x > 1/M. (The inequality
algebra is a bit tricky because both M and x are negative.) This implies that
we can take −δ = 1/M, or δ = −1/M.
11.
(a) We can use δ ≈0.0024 (or less). Note δ ≈ǫ/4.
(b) We can use δ ≈0.00005 (or less). Note δ ≈ǫ/200.
(c) With ǫ = 0.01, the value δ = 0.001 does not quite work at a = 10. (The
value δ = 0.0005 does work.)
13. First suppose a ∈Z0. Let ǫ > 0 be given. Set δ = 1. This δ works, since if
0 < |x −0| < δ, then x /∈Z, and so |f(x) −0| = 0 < ǫ, as desired.
If a /∈Z, then we can take δ to be the (positive!) distance from a to the nearest
integer.
15. The key idea is that, because S is a ﬁnite set, there is a smallest distance, say d,
between any two points in S. Therefore, to show that limx→a j(x) = 0 when
a ∈S, we can use δ = d works for any ǫ > 0.
To show that limx→a j(x) = 0 when a /∈S, we can choose any ǫ > 0 and let δ be
the smallest distance from a to any point of S. Such a δ exists because S is ﬁnite.

(a) The point is that all three quantities in the claimed inequality are even func-

wedge with angle θ at the origin.
3.2
Continuous Functions
1. For given ǫ > 0, δ = ǫ works.
3. Give details as needed.

(c) δ = ǫ/345 works regardless of the value of a.

(a) The idea: If f + g is continuous, then (f + g) −f = g is continuous, too.
Give details.
(b) There are many possiblities.
7. Suppose ﬁrst that A ̸= 0. Let ǫ > 0 be given. Set δ =
ǫ
|A|; note that δ > 0. If
|x−c| < δ, then |f(x)−f(c)| = |Ax+B −(Ac+B)| = |A||x−c| < |A|δ = ǫ,
as desired.
If A = 0 then f is a constant function. In this case any number δ > 0 works for a
given ǫ > 0.
9.
(a) Let ǫ > 0. Since f is continuous at 42 we can choose δ > 0 so |x −
42| < δ
=⇒
|f(x) −f(42)| < ǫ. The same δ works for g, because
|g(x) −g(42)| < |f(x) −f(42)|.
(b) For given ǫ > 0 the same δ works for f and for h.
(c) For given ǫ > 0 the same δ works for f and for k.
11. The composite function cos(sin(x)) is continuous; see the relevant fact on page 163.
13. By the continuity hypothesis, f(0) = limn→∞f(1/n). Since all terms of the
sequence f(1/n) are positive, the limit can’t be negative. (One can argue this more
formally using general properties of sequences. Or see Problem 3, page 91.)
15. Note that limx→3 f(x) = f(3). Let ǫ = f(3) −5. If we choose any δ > 0 that
works for this ǫ, we’re done.
17.
(a) The discontinuity of f(x) = 1/x at a = 0 is not removable; lim
x→0 f(x) does
not exist.
(b) The discontinuity is removed if we set f(−2) = −4 = lim
x→−2 f(x).
(c) The discontinuity is removed if we set f(0) = 0 = lim
x→0 f(x).
19. We need to show that f(c) = 0 if c is any irrational number. Recall (why?) that
there is a sequence {rn} of rationals such that rn →c; note that f(rn) = 0 for
all n. Continuity of f at c requires that f(rn) →f(c). In other words, f(c) =
lim
n→∞f(rn) = lim
n→∞0 = 0.
3.3
Why Continuity Matters: Value Theorems
1.
(a) There are many possibilities; one has the tent-shaped graph through (0, 0),
(1, 1) and (2, 0).
(b) If f(0) = f(1), f(2) = f(1), or f(0) = f(2) we’re done. We might as well
assume, then, that either f(0) < f(2) < f(1) or f(2) < f(0) < f(1). In
the former case, by the IVT, there exists c with 0 < c < 1 and f(c) = f(2),
so indeed f is not one-to-one. The remaining case is similar.

Now as x →∞the quantity in parentheses tends to 1 and so the product
tends to ∞.
(b) Let M = 0. Then there exists N so that f(x) > M = 0 whenever x > N.
Thus if b is any number with b > N, we have f(b) > 0.
(c) Numerical experiments reveal that q(−1) < 0, q(0) = 1, q(1) = 0, q(1.5) <
0, and q(2) > 0. This means, by the IVT, that there must be a root between
−1 and 0 and another between 1.5 and 2. Factoring gives q(x) = (x −
1)(x2 + x + 1)(x2 −x −1), from which we can ﬁnd the real roots exactly.
5.
(a) The minimum value of p on [0, 3] is p(0) = 0. The EVT guarantees that p
must assume such a minimum value.
(b) The minimum value of q on (0, 3] is q(3) = 0. The EVT doesn’t apply here,
since (0, 3] is not a closed interval.
(c) Factoring gives p(a) −4 = a(3 −a)2 −4 = (a −4)(a −1)2. This shows
that p(1) = 4 and p(a) −4 ≤0 when 0 ≤a ≤3. In other words, p(1) is the
maximum value.

(a) f(x) = |2x −1| is one possibility
(b) f(x) = sin(2πx) + 1

is one possibility.
(c) No such function exists. A continuous function on [0, 1] must achieve a min-
imum value.
9
(a) f(x) = −(x −0.5)2 is one possibility.
(b) No such function g can exist. Note that we have f(a) = e < 3 < π = f(b)
for some a and b in [0, 1]. Thus 3 is an “intermediate value” and so must be
attained for some c ∈[0, 1].
(c) p(x) = −3 + x2 is one possibility.
(d) No such function q can exist. If q has odd degree then q is unbounded above
and below. If q has even degree then q may be bounded below, but in this case
q achieves a minimum value rather than just approaching a minimum.
(e) f(x) = ex −3 is one possibility.
11. Suppose f attains a maximum value at some c ∈(a, b). If f(c) = f(a) or f(c) =
f(b) then we’re done already, so assume that f(c) > f(a) and f(c) > f(b).
Let v be any number less than f(c) but greater than both f(a) and f(b). (There
are inﬁnitely many possibilities.) By the IVT, f(d) = v for some d ∈(a, c), and
f(e) = v for some e ∈(c, b). Thus f(d) = f(e), so f is not one-to-one.

13. Suppose toward contradiction f(2) ≤f(1). If f(2) = f(1) or f(2) = f(0), then
f is not one-to-one, a contradiction. Thus we have either f(0) < f(2) < f(1) or
f(2) < f(0) < f(1). In the former case, by the intermediate value theorem there
exists c with 0 < c < 1 and f(c) = 2, which again contradicts the one-to-one
property. The remaining case, f(2) < f(0) < f(1) is similar.
Alternatively, just note that Problem 12 says that f is strictly monotone, and there-
fore strictly increasing.
15. If f is not constant then the range of f is an interval. But every interval contains
both rational and irrational numbers.

Uniform Continuity
1
(a) For given ǫ > 0 we can use any positive δ, such as δ = 1.
(b) For any s and t, we have |g(s) −g(t)| = |2s + 7 −2t −7| = 2 |s −t|.
This implies that for any given ǫ > 0 the value δ = ǫ/2 works.
3.
(a) Let ǫ > 0. The value δ = ǫ “works” because if |x−y| < δ then |f(x) −f(y)| ≤
|x −y| < δ = ǫ.
(b) We have |f(x) −f(y)| =

1
x2 + 1 −
1
y2 + 1

nominator inside the absolute value to complete the proof.
5. Show ﬁrst that for x and y in [1/4, 10], |f(x) −f(y)| = 5|x −y|
xy
≤90|x −y|.
Then, for given ǫ > 0 we can set δ = ǫ/90.
7. In part (c), values of δ that work for f at c = 1, c = 10, c = 100, and c = 1000 are
δ ≈0.414, δ ≈0.05, δ ≈0.005, and δ ≈0.0005, respectively. The fact that these
δ’s decrease to zero means they can’t be chosen “uniformly” in R. On the other
hand, δ = 0.0005 works for ǫ = 1 on the entire interval [1, 1000].
The difference for g is that δ = 0.1 works for all of c = 1, c = 10, c = 100, and
c = 1000, and would work for all c. This is what uniform continuity on R means.
9.
(a) Start by squaring both sides of the desired inequality.
(b) For given ǫ > 0 it works to set δ = ǫ2. If 0 < x−y < δ then |f(x) −f(y)| =
√x −√y ≤√x −y <
√
ǫ2 = ǫ.
11.
(a) Note that if a and b are in [−3, 42), then
a2 + ab + b2 ≤3 · 422 = 5292.
The hint implies, therefore, that |f(s) −f(t)| =
s3 −t3 = 5292 |s −t|.
This implies that for any ǫ > 0 the value δ = ǫ/5292 works in the deﬁnition
of uniform convergence on [−3, 42).
(b) The function f(x) = x3 is continuous on the closed and bounded interval
[−3, 42], and is therefore also uniformly continuous on the same interval, by
Theorem 3.22. Since [−3, 42) ⊂[−3, 42], f is also uniformly continuous on
the smaller interval.

uous) on R.
(c) The function f must be constant (and hence uniformly continuous) on R.
(d) For some δ, values of f can’t rise or fall value by more than 1 on intervals
of length δ. Such a function could have jumps, and so need not even be
continuous.

of two open sets.

(b) Let Ai = [−1 + 1/i, 1 −1/i].
5.
(a) The value ǫ = 0.0042 works.
(b) The value ǫ = p works.
(c) Suppose U is open and p ∈U. Since U is a union of open intervals, we must
have p ∈(a, b) ⊆U for some open interval (a, b). Since a < p < b we can
take ǫ to be the smaller of p −a and b −p.
7. Let ǫ > 0 be given, and consider the open interval U = (a −ǫ, a + ǫ). Our
assumption means that there is a largest N for which aN /∈U. This N works in the
usual deﬁnition of sequence convergence.

(b) Suppose f : RtoR is continuous, and A ⊆R is closed. Then U = R \ A

(b) The set S is not dense in R. The interval (0, .0005), for instance, has empty

Compactness
1.
(a) Each xi is in some Ui, so it takes at most n such Ui to cover F.
(b) We can cover R with open sets Ui = (−i, i) for i ∈N. A ﬁnite subcollection
covers only a bounded subset of R.
(c) It takes zero open sets to cover ∅; that’s certainly ﬁnite!
3.
(a) Cover each term 1/k with a small open interval that contains no other term of

(b) The set {an} is compact in this case, because it contains its own limit.
(c) Many sequences are possible. One is 0, 1, 0, 1, . . . .
5. Find a linear (therefore certainly continuous) function f : R →R that maps [0, 1]
onto [a, b].
7. The Ui are open because they are inverse images of the open intervals (−i, i). The
Ui cover all of R, and so all of K. Compactness of K means that we need only
ﬁnitely many Ui to cover K. This amounts to boundedness of f on K.
9. Proposition 3.41 says that the image of a compact set is compact.

3.
(a) Draw your own picture.
(b) The difference quotient calculations are straightforward.
(c) The graphs of f and g are reﬂections of each other in the line y = x. The

must be nonnegative.
(b) We have −1 ≤f(x) −f(0)
x −0
≤1 for all x, and so −1 ≤f ′(0) ≤1.

factor of 4. Note that the g-graph is formed by vertical stretching of the f-graph.
13.
(a) It’s easy to show that both
lim
x→0−f(x) = 0 and
lim
x→0+ f(x) = 0; thus
lim
x→0 f(x) = 0 = f(0), which means that f is continuous at 0.
(b) Yes, f is differentiable at x = 0. Again, we have

x→0+
f(x) −f(0)

15. Note ﬁrst that f(0) = 0. Thus, f ′(0) = lim
x→0
f(x)
x
. This limit exists, and is zero,
by squeezing: |f(x)| ≤x2 implies −|x| ≤f(x)
x
≤|x|. Since the right and left
quantities tend to zero, so must the middle.
17. We need to show that lim
x→0 x sin(1/x) = 0. Exactly this limit is discussed in Exam-
ple 6, page 155.

(a) This is essentially the Principle of Persistent Inequalities. Assume toward
contradiction that f(0) < 42. Then, says the PoPI, for some δ > 0 we have

(b) Clearly h(0) = 0. Now h′(0) = lim
x→0
h(x)

x→0 g(x) = 42. (The last
equality holds because g is continuous.)
21.
(a) Claim (iv) of Lemma 2 says that since f ′(0) = 100 > 0, we must have
f(x) < 0 on (−δ, 0) and f(x) > 0 on (0, δ) for suitable small δ.

(a) The chain rule says that if h(x) = 1/g(x), then h′(a) = −g′(a)/g(a)2.
(b) Applying the product rule to f(x)/g(x) = f(x) · h(x) gives the derivative
f ′(a) · h(a) + f(a)h′(a) = f ′(a)/g(a) −f(a)g′(a)/g(a)2, which is (after
a bit of algebra) seen to be the desired expression.
7. All parts are straightforward—but perhaps messy—calculations.
9. Clearly, g(a) = f(a)2 = 0. Also the chain rule gives g′(a) = 2f(a)f ′(a) = 0.
11.
(a) Notice ﬁrst that f is continuous at x = 17, by Theorem 4.3, page 213. We
also know, or can easily prove, that h(x) = |x| is continuous everywhere.
Since g(x) is the composition h(f(x)), we know that g(x) must also be con-
tinuous.
(b) If f(x) = x −17, then g(x) = |x −17|, which is clearly not differentiable
at x = 17.
(c) Note that g(x)2 is really the same thing as f(x)2, which is the product of two
differentiable functions, and therefore differentiable.

The Mean Value Theorem
1. If a and b are any two roots of f, then Rolle’s theorem implies that f ′(c) = 0 for
some c between a and b. Our claim follows.
If f(x) = 2+sin x, then f has no real roots, but f ′(x) = cos x has inﬁnitely many
roots.
3.
(a) Every odd-degree polynomial has at least one root; we’ve shown this using
the intermediate value theorem.
(b) There are many possibilities. The functions f1(x) = x3 (with a = b = 0),
f2(x) = x3 −3x + 2 (with a = −3 and b = 2), and f3(x) = x3 −3x + 1
(with a = −3 and b = 1) have one, two, and three roots, respectively.
(c) Rolle’s theorem implies that between any two distinct roots of f lies a root of
f ′. If f had at least 4 roots, f ′ (a quadratic polynomial) would have at least 3
roots, which is impossible.

328

(d) We know f has at least one root. If a > 0 then f ′(x) = 3x2+a, so f ′(x) > 0
for all x. Thus f ′ has no roots, and so f can have at most one root.
5.
(a) Rolle’s theorem gives x1 between a and c and x2 between c and b.
(b) Rolle’s theorem applied to f ′ on the interval [x1, x2] gives the desired x0.
(c) If f : [a, c] →R has continuous derivatives f ′, f ′′, . . . , f (42) on [a, c], and
there are inputs x1, x2, . . . , x43 with f(x1) = f(x2) = · · · = f(x43), then
the desired x0 exists.
7. Rolle’s theorem implies that f ′ has a root in each interval (0, a), (a, 2a), (2a, 3a),
. . . . Since f ′ is also periodic with period a, (f ′)′ = f ′′ also has roots in each of
these intervals, and similarly for higher-order derivatives.

(a) Every number c in (1, 7) works.
(b) The only solution is c = 4.
(c) In this case the MVT equation f ′(c) = f(b) −f(a)

1001/99 ≈0.955.
(d) In this case the equation f ′(c) = f(b) −f(a)
b −a
reduces to 6c + 5 = 3a +
3b + 5, which gives c = (a + b)/2, the midpoint of (a, b).
(e) If q(x) = Ax2 + Bx + C and [a, b] is any interval, then the mean value
equation holds if and only if c = (a + b)/2. To see why, note that in this case
the equation f ′(c) = f(b) −f(a)
b −a
reduces to B + 2Ac = B + A(a + b).
11. If a car has the same velocity at times a and b, then there must be some intermediate

(a) Consider h(x) = f(x) −g(x). By hypothesis, h′(x) = 0 for all x ∈(a, b).
By Proposition 4.11, h is constant, as desired.
(b) Let h(x) = f(x) −g(x) −5x. Then h′(x) = 0 for all x ∈(a, b), and so
h(x) = C for some constant C. It follows that f(x) = g(x) + 5x + C.
15. If we write m = f(b) −f(a)

(a) This should be straightforward.
(b) The proof of (i) can be essentially rerun with strict inequalities.
(c) If f were not monotone, then we’d have f(a) = f(b) for some a and b in I.
Rolle’s theorem now says there is c ∈I with f ′(c) = 0, which contradicts
the hypothesis.
19. Suppose f(b) ≥b for some b > 0.
Then the MVT implies that f ′(c) =

≥1 for some c between 0 and b; this contradicts our as-
sumption.

(a) The function f is continuous, and so must attain a minimum on the interval

(a) All parts follow by plugging t = 0 into f and p2.
(b) That g(0) = 0 = g(1) is an easy calculation. The t1 in question exists by

Sequences of Functions
1.
(a) For any real number x and ǫ > 0, let N = 1/ǫ. If n > N then |fn(x) −f(x)| =
fn(x) = 1
n < ǫ. Thus fn →f pointwise on R. Because the same inequality
holds for all x, the convergence is also uniform.
(b) For any ﬁxed real number x we have fn(x) =
x
n →0 as n →∞, so
fn →f pointwise on R. The convergence is not uniform on R. For ǫ = 1,
for instance, no N works: for every n we have |fn(x) −f(x)| = |x/n| > 1
whenever |x| > n.
(c) For any ﬁxed real number x we have fn(x) = sin x
n
→0 as n →∞. Thus
fn →f pointwise on R. The convergence is also uniform; the proof is similar
to that in (a).
3.
(a) Fix a ∈R and let an = a + 1/n. Note that an →a and that f(an) = fn(a)
for all n. Since f is continuous at a, fn(a) = f(an) →f(a), as desired.
(c) Let ǫ > 0 be given. Choose δ > 0 that works for ǫ in the deﬁnition of uniform
continuity, and choose an integer N with 1/N < δ. This N works for ǫ in the
deﬁnition of uniform convergence: if n > N then—for all real x—we have
|fn(x) −f(x)| = |f(x + 1/n) −f(x)| < ǫ.
(The last inequality holds because |(x + 1/n) −x| < δ.)
5. The result is just a restatement of the analogous fact for Cauchy sequences of num-
bers.
7.
(a) The statement is true. A convergent sequence of integers must eventually be

such that |h(s) −h(t)| < ǫ whenever |s −t| < δ. Because fn →f uniformly on
I we can choose N such that |fn(x) −f(x)| < δ holds for all x ∈I whenever
n > N. By our choice of δ, this guarantees that |h (fn(x)) −h (f(x))| < ǫ for all
x ∈I, as desired.

(a) The ratio calculation is slightly messy, but it works.

3} gives RS(f, P, S) = 3 · 3 = 9.
3. The fact that f(x) ≥3 for all x ∈[0, 2] implies that RS(f, P, S) ≥6 for every
partition P and sample points S. This implies, as in the proof of Proposition 5.3,
that the integral itself cannot be less than 6.
7. Notice ﬁrst that the inequality 0 ≤f(x) ≤g(x) implies that 0 ≤RS(f, P, S) ≤
RS(g, P, S) holds for all suitable partitions P and sample sets S. To show f is
integrable on [a, b], let ǫ > 0 be given. Since g is integrable, there is some δ > 0
that works for g (and the value I = 0) in Deﬁnition 5.1. The preceding inequality
shows that the same δ > 0 works for f.
9. Let ǫ > 0 be given. Since I1 satisﬁes the deﬁnition, can choose δ1 > 0 that works
for I1 and ǫ. Since I2 satisﬁes the deﬁnition, we can choose δ2 > 0 that works
for I2 and ǫ. Let δ be the smaller of δ1 and δ2, and calculate any Riemann sum
RS(f, P, S) for ∥P∥< δ. Then both I1 and I2 are within ǫ of RS(f, P, S), and so
within 2ǫ of each other. Since this holds for all positive ǫ, we must have I1 = I2.
11.
(a) The condition holds by uniform continuity of f on [a, b].

Properties of the Integral
1.
(a) The function h is integrable because it is the difference of two integrable
functions.
(b) In the situation of Corollary 5.6, we can set h(x) = f(x)−g(x). Theorem 5.5
says that h is integrable and that
R b
a f −
R b
a g =
R b
a h. By (a) the last quantity
is nonnegative, which is what we wanted to show.
3. The result of Problem 2 implies that the integral lies between −6 and 12.
5.
(a) By the extreme value theorem, f assumes a minimum value, say f(c) = m,
for some c ∈[a, b]. By hypothesis, m > 0. Now f(x) ≥m for all x ∈[a, b],
and so Corollary 5.6 gives
Z b
a
f ≥
Z b
a
m = m (b −a) > 0,
as claimed.
(b) Part (a) implies that f(c) ≤0 must hold for some c ∈[a, b]. For similar
reasons, f(d) ≥0 must hold for some d ∈[a, b]. If either f(c) = 0 or
f(d) = 0, we’re done; otherwise, the intermediate value theorem says that
f(e) = 0 for some e between c and d.
(c) Let f(x) = 1 for x ≥0 and f(x) = 1 for x < 0. Then
R 1
−1 f = 0, but
f(c) ̸= 0 for all c.
7. The claim amounts to saying that −
R b
a |f| ≤
R b
a f ≤
R b
a |f|. This follows from
Corollary 5.6, and from the fact that −|f(x)| ≤f(x) ≤|f(x)| for all x ∈[a, b].
9.
(a) The function f is integrable on every interval [a, b] because it is built up from
integrable functions as allowed by Theorem 5.8, page 274.
(b) A look at the graph shows
R 1
−1 f = −1.
(c) A look at the graph shows
R n
−n f = −n.
11. All parts are basic elementary calculus calculations.
13. Suppose f(x) ≤g(x) holds except at some ﬁnite list x1, x2, . . . xn of points in
[a, b]. If we redeﬁne f at these points (we could set f(xi) = g(xi), for instance,
without changing the integral) then f(x) ≤g(x) holds throughout [a, b], and so
Corollary 5.6 gives the desired result.

Integrability
1. All of the concocted functions are continuous.
3. Here is one possibility: Set h = ǫ/100 and use P = {0, h, 1−h, 1+h, . . . , 10−
h, 10}.
7. Given any box sum for
R 2
0 f with value less than ǫ, add (if necessary) one more
point at x = 1 to get another box sum with value less than ǫ. This same box sum
works for
R 1
0 f; just ignore boxes to the right of x = 1.
11. Let mi and Mi be the inf and sup of f on [xi−1, xi]. For each i, it is clear that
mi ≤f(si) ≤Mi, and hence that mi∆xi ≤f(si)∆xi ≤Mi∆xi. Summing
over i gives the desired result.
13. The function fbig is constant on each partition subinterval, and is therefore integrable
on [a, b] by Theorem 5.8, page 274. By construction, moreover, the integral
R b
a fbig
has the same value as the upper sum US (f, P).
It is also clear that fbig(x) ≥f(x) for all x ∈[a, b], and so (by Corollary 5.6,
page 270) we have
US (f, P) =
Z b
a
fbig ≥
Z b

f = I,
The proof that LS (f, P) underestimates I is almost identical.

Some Fundamental Theorems
1. The ﬁrst claim follows immediately from the mean value theorem for integrals.
Finding examples for the second part is easy.
3. The new average value is 5 · 3 + 7 = 22; the average value behaves “linearly.”
5.
(a) b = 9/4.
(b) b = 2.
(c) b =
√
3 ≈1.732.
(d) b ≈1.094.
7. Let M be the maximum value of f. Then h(x) = M −f(x) ≥0 for all x ∈[a, b].
The hypotheses imply that
R b
a h = 0; hence h(x) = 0 for all x ∈[a, b].
The result need not hold if f is not continuous. Consider the function f given by
f(0) = 1 and f(x) = 0 on [0, 1].
9. The hypothesis means that F(b) =
R b
0 f = b2/2 for all x. Thus f(b) = F ′(b) = b
all b.
11. The interval [0, 8/3] is one possibility.
13.
(a) Note that hn(0) = 0 for all n, so clearly hn(0) →h(0) = 0. If x > 0,
then hn(x) = 0 for all x with x < 1/n, so again hn(x) →h(x) = 0.
Show that the sequence {hn} converges pointwise to h on [0, 1]. By contrast,
R 1
0 hn = 1 for all n, while
R 1
0 h = 0.

(b) The sequence {hn} converges uniformly to h on [0.1, 1], because hn(x) = 0
for all x ∈[0.1, 1] whenever n > 10. Similarly,
R 1
0.1 hn = 0 for all n > 10,
so the integrals converge as well.
15.
(a) The uniform limit function f is continuous on [0, 1] and hence is also inte-
grable there.
(b) For given ǫ > 0, choose N such that |fn(x)−f(x)| < ǫ for all n > N. Now
