Preface
Preface
These exercises have been developed to fit the content of the text book Drilling Fluid Engineering at  
www.bookboone.dk. The understanding of the physics and mathematics of the processes has been in 
focus of both the textbook and the exercises book. Many practical applications have also been created and 
entered into the collection of exercises. Most of the exercises have been solved and corrected by students 
in the corresponding course at the Department of Petroleum Engineering and Applied Geophysics at 
NTNU in Trondheim. If the readers have any comments that could improve the exercises, please contact 
me at pal.skalle@ntnu.no. Any such comments will be worked into the next year’s issue of this book.

Fluid Properties
1	 Fluid Properties
We moved exercises 1.1–1.4 to other chapters.
1.5	
Rheology control
a)	 Will YP, PV and µeff be influenced by the addition of barite? 
b)	 Why is lye (NaOH) added to the drilling fluid?
c)	 Define polymers and the purpose of adding them to the drilling fluid.
d)	 Define pseudo plastic, thixotropic and rheopectic fluid behaviour.
e)	 Why does viscosity of water increase when Bentonite is added?
1.6	
Rheology control
a)	 Explain how dispersed Bentonite is able to contain up to 18 times its own volume of distilled 
water. Why is it that the water-holding effect will be reduced when salt is added to the water?
b)	 Explain the reason behind the non-Newtonian behavior of Bentonite suspensions.
Out on a drilling rig the questions asked are of practical nature: In the upper wellbore section seawater 
is often used as drilling fluid. If the viscosifying effect drilled-through clay does not produce the proper 
viscosity, the addition of Bentonite to the water has to be considered. Use Figure 1-6 and assuming that 
the quality of the drilled-out clay corresponds to Premium Drilling Clay. Assume that ROP is 35 m/hr 
while using a 26” bit. The pump rate is 3 000 l/min. The required mud viscosity must at least be 15 cP. 
c)	 Will the formation provide the required viscosity? 
d)	 What is the yield (m3 of mud/ton solids) of Wyoming Bentonite? (ρBentonite = 2.4 kg /l)
e)	 What is the water density (originally 1.0 kg/l) after addition of Bentonite, when an effective 
viscosity of 50 cP is the upper boundary?

Flocculation
Bentonite and polymers are the dominating viscosity agents. Bentonite is still widely used and we 
have to understand its behavior properly. Bentonite behaves different from other additives; it swells 
and flocculates.
a)	 Why does Bentonite flocculate (weak flocculation)?
b)	 What will happen if untreated water based mud is used while drilling through the cement in 
the casing shoe area? Explain what happens to the mud (strong flocculation) and the respective 
operational consequences. Sketch the flow curve of the mud before and after having drilled 
through the cement.
c)	 Name 3 factors which enhance flocculation of Bentonite.
d)	 Why does WBM behave shear thinning?
e)	 Why does WBM behave thixotropic? 
f)	 Explain the difference in flocculation tendency of pure edge-to-face and of cross-linking caused 
by external agents.

Mud contamination
a)	 What is a contaminated mud, and how are the drilling fluid parameters restored?
b)	 The geologist expected that layers of silty anhydrite would be penetrated at a vertical depth 
of 1600 m. The mud engineer was therefore told to make measurements every 15 min. of the 
returning mud as shown in the table below. After penetrating the anhydrite he observed that 
the viscosity of the mud, a dispersed WBM system, started to rise and became abnormally 
thick. Drilling continued and after a few hours of drilling/pumping, the viscosity fell back to 
a lower level than the original viscosity.

Together with the mud engineer you are responsible for the maintenance of the drilling fluid 
program. Explain changes in the recorded parameters observed at 0930 and at 1145. Suggest 
countermeasures against these changes.
c)	 Assume two clay suspensions are flocculating for two different reasons during drilling 
operations; 1. Edge-to-face. 2. Calcium attack. How do the two clay suspensions behave 
rheologically? Make a sketch of the in-situ shear stress vs. time; during drilling into the Ca++ 
containing layer. Assume you drill in the contaminated zone for 10 min. Then turn off the 
pump for 10 min. Continue drilling for 10 min till you are out of the contaminated zone. 
1.9	
Flocculation
a)	 Find necessary YP to keep a spherical particle suspended in a mud of UPXG = 1.1 kg/1. The 
particle has these characteristics:
	
dp = 5 mm
	
US = 2.3 kg/l
Similarly, find out what is the maximum size the particles can be kept suspended at when 
YP = 15 Pa.
b)	 At 12:00 the ROP became very low and it was decided to change the bit. A 15 min. stop in 
the operation was made before tripping-out from 2 100 mMD was initiated. When the first 
pipe was broken mud spilled out on the drill floor. Could this spill have been prevented? How 
high up can the string be hoisted before gravity pulls the mud down in the following situation:
 
τgel 15 min. = 30 lb/100 ft2 (14.4 Pa)
	
Inner diameter of the drill pipe = 4.127˝ (104.85 mm)

Rheological models
2	 Rheological models
To simplify the evaluation of drilling fluids out in the field, the simplified Bingham field method was 
developed. In this collection of exercises we distinguish between the simplified field and the standard 
method of determining rheological model constants. 
The simplified field method is applicable in conjunction with the Fann viscometer. 
For the standard method the Fann readings are converted to SI units and multiplied with the factor 
1.067 (see SPE’s Applied Drilling Engineering textbook Appendix A, eqn. A-6b). 
Note also that conversion factors are presented in Chapter 6 in present book.

Rheological models
A useful exercise is to plot the effective viscosity (apparent Newtonian viscosity) as a function 
of shear rate. The non-Newtonian and the shear thinning effect will then appear clearly. 
b)	 The mud is flowing in a 1000 m long pipe with inner diameter of 4 in, flow rate is 6 000 l/
min (two pumps) and density is 1.1 kg/l. Use the Power-Law to estimate µeff at this flow rate.
c)	 Determine the pressure loss in the pipe (Power-law).
d)	 Why are drilling fluids often so well suited to the Bingham model?

The flow rate is 2 500 lpm in a 1000 m long pipe with an inner diameter of 10 cm. Rheological data

Velocity profile. Continuity equation
The incompressible steady state flow between two parallel plates with breath b in Figure 3.1 is initially 
uniform at the entrance; v = Y  = 8 cm/s. Downstream the flow develops into the parabolic laminar profile 
v(z) = az (z0 – z), where a is constant and z0 the plate distance. If z0 = 4 cm, what is the value of vmax?
Figure 3-1: Flow data.
3.2	
Velocity profile. Momentum flux
a)	 The fully developed laminar pipe-flow velocity profile is expressed as: vz(r) = vmax (1 – r2 / R2), 
vθ = 0, vr = 0. z indicates here the axial direction: This is an exact solution to the cylindrical 
Navier-Stoke equation. Neglect gravity and compute the pressure distribution in the pipe; 
p(r,z), and the shear-stress distribution; τ(r,z), using R, vmax and µ as parameters. Why does 
the maximum shear occur at the wall? 
b)	 For flow between parallel plates, compute b1) wall shear stress and b2) the average velocity. 
From the Text book, Chapter 4, we find that vz (y) = – dp/dz . h2 /2 P  (1 – y2/h2). The most 
general definition of shear stress is given by: ߬ൌ߬௭ൌߤቀ

3.9	
Pressure loss. Use field data to evaluate model
Prior to a pre flush/cementing operation the driller performed pressure tests to verify theoretical 
pressure estimations. Previously comparisons between the actual pressure readings during drilling with 
theoretically estimated pressure loss resulted in large derivations. He was convinced that the derivations 
could be back-tracked to the pressure drop across the mud motor and the bit. These two losses can only 
be estimated by means of empirical models and are thus highly uncertain. Now he had the chance to 
record pressure loss without these two disturbing pieces of equipment installed. After lowering the 5˝ * 
4.127˝ DP (without the bit) down to the casing shoe he circulated for 45 min. to neutralize temperature 
effects. The casing, a 133⁄8˝, 68 lb/ft, (ID=12.40˝) had its casing shoe at 4 500 mMD. The pump was a 
relatively new (volumetric efficiency = 0.96) Garden-Denver PZ-11-1600 HP triplex mud pump, 6˝ liner. 
One complete pump stroke delivered 15.29 l. At the following pump speeds, with no drill string rotation, 
he read the average stand pipe pressures (SPP) which was the average of 3 tests:
5 spm – 13 (+/-2) bars
20 spm – 70 (+/-3) bars
50 spm – 100 (+/-5) bars
100 spm – 200 (+/-10) bars
Rheology of drilling fluid at this temperature is identified with the one in Task 2-1. Apply the Power -aw 
model. Mud density was 1.21 kg/l. The recorded pressure losses are presented in Figure 3-10. Estimate 
pressure losses and compare them with the recorded ones.
3.10	
Pressure loss. Effect of rotation
In this task you need to use your imagination. The driller made now an additional test: At the lowest 
and the highest pump speeds [5 and 100 SPM from Task 3.9 above] he rotated the drill string at 100 
RPM for a short time and saw that the average reading changed to 8 and 248 bars respectively at the 
two selected pump speeds. Determine the effect of rotation on the mud’s rheology for the given flow rate 
(the rheology is obviously dictating the annular pressure loss). Assume that the rotational movement is 
additive to the axial flow with respect to shearing effect on the fluid. When determining the shear effect, 
simply use the average rotational velocity across the annular gap. Assume also that the drilling fluid is 
the same as in task 3.9, a Power-law model with n = 0.5, K = 1.63.

After having drilled a 17.5˝ hole the 133⁄8˝ casing was set and cemented at 2 300 mMD. Finally a 12¼˝ 
hole was drilled down to the reservoir at 2 500 m.
The drill string consisted of a drill pipe (54.276˝) and 100 m of drill collars (6.25 · 3.1˝). The circulating 
rate was 800 GPM during drilling and the mud density was 12.9 PPG. A Fann-VG viscometer gave the 
following readings:
θ300 =	 50
θ 600 =	85

Swab pressure model
Assume you are tripping out while simultaneously pumping. Your task is to start the process of derivation, 
which later, will lead to an expression of surge pressure during laminar flow. When making a drawing 
of the process, use parameters like vp (pipe), qp (pump), Rw (wellbore), Rp (pipe), R0 (the point where the 
flow velocity is zero), etc, as required for your explanation.

The exercises which are related to the hydraulic program distinguish between two different approaches 
of preparing the hydraulic program: 
a)	 The standard method: Each liner represents the pump’s capability. The hydraulic program is 
planned for one well section at a time.
b)	 The extended method: All the piston sizes are treated as part of one process, and they are 
divided into two operating ranges. The hydraulic program is planned for all sections in one 
common operation.
Both the methods are based on maximizing the ROP, which (in this book) is expressed through the 
following equation:
ROP = A* (q / dnozzle)a8

filter cake?
b)	 If the fluid loss shows an increasing tendency during drilling, how is it detected and how is

Filtration control
We want to obtain a physical picture of how far the filtrate and the particles penetrate a porous formation 
and gradually stops due to a tight filter cake. A 15˝ hole with open hole length of 4 000 ft is being drilled. 
The bottom 10% of the borehole length is of porous formation (defining the filter area) with a porosity 
of 15%. Assume that this porosity corresponds to the porosity of the filter paper. The filter area A of the 
filter press is 45 cm2 (r = 3.9 cm.).
A laboratory test of the mud showed an API water loss of 25 ml/30 min. The cumulative loss is proportional 
to the square root of time. Assume therefore that the accumulative fluid loss Vf is expresses as:
9I  $ 
N  'S
P

W  $  &
W
We assume the parameters defined by C are constants.
a)	 To simplify the fluid loss estimation imagine that the time of drilling the well is negligible. 
Construct a plot of filtration loss vs. time. Estimate the fluid loss after 24 hours.
b)	 Calculate the radius of the invaded zone after 24 hours, assuming 100% displacement of the 
pore fluid.
c)	 We want to minimize the fluid loss to porous formation during overbalanced drilling, both 
with OBM and WBM.
	
How would you specify the drilling fluid (focus on the part related to filtrate loss)?
	
How would you follow up filtration control during the drilling phase?
	
Why is filtration control important?
	
The lab filtration showed an increasing tendency during drilling. Why?

b)	 At the surface, when the mud is entering the return flow line (= c3)
c)	 What determines the cuttings bed height in the horizontal section?
d)	 Why is cuttings accumulation in wellbore expansions (washouts) a problem during tripping?

Density control
a)	 Define a weighted mud system (as opposed to an un-weighted)? Explain how to clean 
weighted muds.
b)	 Derive a simple formula of necessary volume increase, ∆Vadd, involving weight material with 
density UDGG (4.3 kg/l) to increase the density from U to U Use this formula to estimate how 
much mass of barite must be added to increase mud density from 1.3 to 1.4 kg/l. Original mud 
volume was 60 m3.
c)	 1 m3 of mud has a density of 1.5 kg/l. Adjust the mud density to 1.72 by adding 100 l mud of 
density 1.8, 40 kg Bentonite (to adjust rheology) of density 2.3 kg/l and barite of density 4.2 
kg/l. Find how much Barite of density 4.3 kg/l is needed to obtain a mud density of 1.72 kg/l, 
all ingrediences added together simultaneously.
d)	 Different water based muds defined below are stored in three different mud pits. All 3 pits 
should be mixed into one tank and water added until the density becomes 1.55. How much 
volume of water must be added?
	
V1 = 10 m3, r1 = 1.5 kg/l
	
V2 = 20 m3, r2 = 1.6 kg/l
	
V3 = 3 m3, r3 = 1.9 kg/l
5.6	
Density control
Sometimes the mud viscosity increases unintentionally due to accumulation of fines in the mud. These 
fines are referred to as Low Gravity Solids Content (LGSC). The fines are too fine to be removed by the 
cleaning equipment. Typical density of LGS is 2.4 kg/l. They are inert, but builds viscosity since particle 
size is small (< 5 µ). Their unwanted effect can be reduced by diluting the mud with water. Here follows 
3 examples:
a)	 The mud volume is 100 m3 with a density 1.8 kg/l. The fraction of low gravity solids is too 
high, 5 weight %, and has to be decreased to 3% by water addition. Calculate the mud volume 
to be discarded and the amounts of fresh water and Barite that should be added. The original 
volume and density has to be unchanged.
b)	 A tank containing 90 m3 of mud has a density of 1.6 kg/l and should be increased to 1.7 kg/l. 
The volume fraction of low-gravity solids must first be reduced from 0.055 to 0.030 by water 
dilution. It is required that you first discard a part of the original mud volume, so that after 
adding of water the volume of the mud is 90 m3 before the barite is added. How much barite 
must be added, and what exactly is the new LGSC?
c)	 Calculate the volumes of old mud (< 10 m3) and barite that has to be mixed in order to fill a 
10 m3 large pit with mud which must balance a pore pressure of 410 bar in a depth of 3000 m. 
Barite has a density of 4.3 kg/l. The density of the old mud is 1.2 kg/l.

ECD. Barite
Explain the reasons behind and suggest potential solution to the following problem:
This well was drilled with WBM, weighted by Barite to 15 PPG. While POOH to change the 12¼˝ bit, 
the driller experienced no problems. When GIH with the new bit some weight reductions (took weight) 
were experienced in the build-up zone. It took around 5 h from the bit left the bottom of the well till it 
returned. After the bit reached the bottom, the well was circulated for some time, and the returning mud 
behaved strangely. The mud weight, which originally was 15 PPG displayed an initial sharp decrease, 
then increased again as shown in Figure 5-3, before finally stabilizing at 15 PPG.

a)	 Prior to drilling, the hole was circulated at 3 500 l/min. What is the annular pressure loss, and 
what is the corresponding ECD?
b)	 The drilling commenced from 2 100 m. The same rheology and flow rate was applied. At 2 
300 m the average drilling rate was 50 m/hr. Formation bulk density was 2.4 kg/liter. What 
is the ECD in this situation? Transport ratio is 0.75. At the casing shoe at 1 800 m TVD the 
formation fracture pressure was 228 bar. Check if everything is OK.
c)	 A new mud was being prepared for the 8½˝ section. The 133⁄8˝ csg shoe was located at 15 000 
ft vertical depth. While drilling at 16 500 ft the well started losing mud and it was decided 
to lower the MW from 15 to 14 PPG. The well had very narrow pressure window, and the 
equivalent pore pressure gradient at this depth was 13.5 PPG. The mud was mixed to 14 PPG 
with an effective viscosity of 40 and 30 cP at 600 and 300 RPM respectively, at an average surface 
mud temperature of 40°C. After the new mud was circulated, the pump was shut off, and a 
flow-check indicated that the well was dead (no influx). While repairing the power swivel the 
well started to flow by itself, and soon afterwards the kicking well had to be shut in to avoid 
a complete unloading.
How would you go about to estimate the pressure profile of an initially cold, static fluid column 
as a function of time. You are asked to present the governing equations of heat transfer in a 
well on differential form, and work out a flow sheet of how to numerically solve this task.

water in shale?
b)	 Explain why water activity is a function of water salinity? 
c)	 Explain why high water activity causes clay swelling problems? 
d)	 How do you prevent clay swelling problem? 
e)	 How does water activity of the water phase in OBM influence wellbore stability?

Shale stability
In order to avoid that water enters and causes the shale to swell, the activity of the water in the mud 
(including the water phase in oil based mud) and in the shale must be equal.
The activity of the water in the water phase in shale cuttings is measured in the field using an electro 
hygrometer. The probe of the electro hygrometer is placed in the vapor above the sample being tested. 
The electrical resistance of the probe is sensitive to the amount of water vapor present. Since the test 
always is conducted at atmospheric pressure, the water vapor pressure is directly proportional to the 
volume fraction of water in the air/water vapor mixture. The instrument is normally calibrated with 
saturated solutions of known activity shown in Table 5-6.

Table 5-6: Saturated solutions of different salts and its vapor’s water activity
Sodium chloride and calcium chloride are the salts mostly used to alter the activity of the water in the 
mud. Calcium chloride is quite soluble, allowing the activity to be varied over a wide range. In addition, 
it is relatively inexpensive. The resulting water activity for various concentrations of NaCl and CaCl2 are 
shown in Fig. 5-6.
a)	 The activity of a sample of shale cuttings drilled with OBM (no foreign fluid invasion) is 
determined to be 0.69 by an electro hygrometer. Determine the concentration of calcium 
chloride needed in the water phase of the mud in order to have the activity of the mud equal 
to the activity of the shale.

Shale stability
a)	 When drilling into swelling clay, problems like sloughing (soft) shale and stuck pipe may occur. 
Explain how/why this can be avoided by means of the proper oil based drilling fluid and specify 
the ingredients in the drilling fluid.
b)	 Why is KOH preferred over NaOH?
c)	 What significance does the K+ concentration have for the shale?
d)	 Can wate flow through shale be controlled?
e)	 Explain the principal function of the two different surface active additives that are always 
added to Oil based mud.
f)	 How is the salt concentration in the water phase, which is added to Oil Based Mud, determined?
While drilling in the 8½˝ section, at a depth of 1 500 mTVD / 6 000 mMD, in overbalance, the ECD 
will fluctuate and at times be high in this long well. Previous experience from that area indicates that 
instable, swellable shale will be penetrated. Your task now is the following:
g)	 Define what wellbore stability-related processes may take place in the shale while drilling 
through it with WBM.
h)	 Which type of inhibitive mud will you suggest in order to maximize wellbore stability? Explain 
how this mud type will affect the wellbore.
i)	 Does fluctuating ECD have any implications for the stability of the wellbore?

Rheology control
a)	 The mean size of Barite is typically 20 mm. They will be uniformly dispersed in the drilling 
fluid and they will lead to increased viscosity. PV and µeff will increase. YP will be unaffected 
or decrease, since the smallest Barite particles will behave as physical dispersants.
b)	 In order to:
	
Suppress Ca++ from dissolving. 
	
Keep anionic colloidal particles dispersed. 
	
Suppress corrosion, H2S- and CO2 – attack.
c)	 Polymers are polymerized monomers. They can be of organic origin or be manufactured 
synthetically. Polymers have high molecular weight and come mostly as charged particles → 
they will bind water molecules → increase the hydrodynamic volume → influence viscosity 
and filter behaviour. Some types of polymers can attract or bind charged particles (clay), and 
therefore influence the swelling process and contribute to selective flocculation (clear water 
drilling). The purpose of polymers are mainly to:
•	 increase fluid viscosity
•	 reduce fluid viscosity in turbulent flow (drag reducer)
•	 control flocculation 
•	 improve both the filter cake itself and the fluid loss through the filter cake
d)	 The description of the three expressions are:
•	 Pseudo plastic fluids exhibit altered apparent viscosity whenever the shear rate is changed. 
•	 The fluid displays a reduction in viscosity over time at constant shear rate as indicated 
in Figure 1-5. 
•	 Rheopectic fluids are rare. They exhibit increased shear stress at increasing shear time 
(at constant shear rate).

Figure 1-5: Behavior of thixotropic fluids after stillstand (left) and at constant shear rates.
e)	 Clay particles have a static, negative surface charge localized on the particle edges, but with 
weakly positively sites on the surface of the platelets. This triggers water! When studying the 
repulsive – attractive forces, it is experienced that at low salt concentration or high colloidal 
concentration, a very slow flocculation will take place. When edges come sufficiently close to 
the surfaces of other Montmorilonite particles, they join.
1.2	
Rheology control 
a)	 Bentonite particles attract water molecules (dipoles) in hundreds of layers onto each of its 
charged surface. Swelled Na-Bentonite sheets separate readily when exposed to shear forces. 
Salt will reduce the charges on the Bentonite surfaces. In addition the salt (ions) will bind much 
of the water (reduce the water activity).

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

b)	 At still-stand many layers of water molecules are attached to the Bentonite surface, and particles 
flocculate slowly  viscosity increases. When the dispersion is stirred or pumped, the resulting 
shear stress will remove attached water layers and break up the flocks. Dispersed Bentonite 
with many free water molecules, torn off due to high shear stress, has lower viscosity than at 
still stand.
c)	 Drilling in sediments of high yield (premium) clay produces the following clay concentration:

Drilled clay contributes to a weight increase of 15.4% and produces a viscosity of 42 cP, which 
is above the required viscosity of 15cP.
d)	 The yield of Bentonite is how many m3 of mud of 15 cP which the amount of one ton Bentonite 
is able to produce. From Figure 1-6 one ton of Bentonite will produce 6 weigth% = 16.666 m3 
of 15 cP mud.
e)	 From Figure 1-6 we see that a viscosity of max. 50 cP will correspond to 7.5 w% of Bentonite.

This shows that mud density cannot be increased much higher than 1 047 kg/m3 by the addition 
of Bentonite.
1.3	
Flocculation
a)	 When two Bentonite flakes are sufficiently near each other they are electrostatically attracted 
and will join edge to surface.
b)	 The cement is not by far hardened and contains a high concentration of lime (CaOH). Lime 
dissociates and one Ca++ ion can crosslink two charged clay platelets. This binding cannot be 
broken by hydraulic means (shear stress), and the flocculated mud has to be dumped after 
having been circulated to the surface.

c)	 The factors which enhance flocculation:
•	 High concentration of charged colloids (Bentonite or anionic polymer) 
•	 High concentration of Ca++ions (from dissolved salt and carbonates) 
•	 High Temperature (Brownian movements of the water molecules contribute to 
bringing the colloidal particles more frequently in contact with each other)
d)	 WBM behaves shear thinning:
•	 Amount of water dipoles attached to each charged colloidal is a function of the shear 
force. High flow rate highe shear rate  water molecules are sheared off and become 
free  lower viscosity of the suspension
•	 Weak flocculation occurs, especially at low sehar. At high shear the floccs break up  
lower yeld point
This behavior was presented during lectures.
e)	 The shearing action explained in e) above also is time dependent. Layer by layer are sheared 
off in concedutive order (presented in lectures).
f)	 The surface of caly colloids are positively charged by the loosely bonded Na-ions and represents 
therefore a weak bond compared to the electrostatic bond of double valence cations, mainly 
Ca++, to the strolngly negative charged colloids at their edges.
1.4	
Mud contamination
a)	 Contaminations are dissolved salt and chalk; drilled through cement etc. all produce Ca++ 
ions which lead to flocculation. Also fines are pollutant. At the surface the mud can be treated 
with thinners. Low gravity (2.4 kg/l) solids content (LGSC) is reduced by running the mud 
through centrifuges.
b)	 Rheology monitoring. First we plot the evolution of the rheology vs. time, as shown in 
Figure 1-8a.

Then to evaluate the mentioned changes of the Bingham field rheology-model is perfect. We estimate 
the Bingham constants:
µpl 	
= 42 – 28 	
= 14 cP
	
= 41 – 27	
= 14 cP
	
= 68 – 54 	
= 14 cP
	
= 31 – 17 	
= 14 cP
We observe that the mud is dispersed at first. Salt will dissolve and Ca++ contaminates the mud. We now 
see that the viscosity is constant, while the yield point (YP) has changed like this:
YP	
 = 28 – 14 	
= 14
 	
= 27 – 14 	
= 13
 	
= 54 – 14 	
= 40
 	
= 17 – 14

The PV is constant (constant inner friction means solids content is constant). ∆ YP is caused by higher 
attractive forces, caused by drilling into a salty formation. Initially, low concentration of Ca++ ions leads 
to strong cross binding (flocculation). Later, when the Ca++ concentration has been high for a while the 
Ca++ ions have exchanged the Na+-ions in the Bentonite plates, leading to aggregation of clay platelets. 
A high concentration of Ca ions will over time lead to lower shear stress than originally due to cation 
exchange. The development is seen in Figure 1-8b.

Countermeasures: Add dispersants or use Gyp mud or use a high pH level in the mud when 
contaminations are expected. This is how to avoid flocculation and aggregation.
c)	 The edge-to-face flocculation is weak electrostatic forces and is easily broken when sheared. 
The Ca++ ion binds two clay platelets in a much stronger grip, and is not easily broken as 
indicated in Figure 1-8c.

b)	 The gel structure inside the drill string could have broken either by just pumping, by hitting the

b)	 A drag reducer consists of long-chained, neutral polymers added in small amounts to the 
viscous fluid. In a turbulent flow regime, the fluid molecules move in a random manner, causing 
much of the energy applied to them to be wasted as eddy currents (and corresponding high 
pressure loss). Due to shear stress the polymers are stretched out where the shear is high (close 
to the wall). In outstretched state the diffusion is higher due to lower effective surface area 
and thus lower resistance to movements. The polymers diffuse more in the direction of the 
pipe centre since the wall hinders diffusion in the opposite direction. The concentration will 
therefore become low after some flowing distance. The small concentration of stretched out 
long polymers along the wall will tend to turn the turbulent flow into laminar or streamlined. 
c)	 The higher concentration, the more K+ is exchanged with Na+ shale, the less shale swelling is 
seen. K+ is geometrically suitable and leads to high platelet attraction.

d)	 Figure 5-10 shows both how a Ca attacks is changing the dispersed mud, but also how Gyp 
mud is made. Bentonite is composed mainly of the mineral called Montmorilonite. It is an 
aluminium silicate in which the silicon-oxygen sandwich is a layer of aluminium hydroxide. 
Some of the aluminium in the lattice structure is, during creation, replaced with ions of a lower 
charge (electron valence) such as magnesium (from 3 to 2). The substitution, without any other 
change of structure, creates surface negative charges in the lattice.
The negative charge sites created in the clay sheet are partly balanced by close association of 
positively charged ions (cation), normally Na+. The creation of these charged ions and charged 
clay surfaces creates very strong attractive forces for polar water molecules that readily force 
themselves in between the unit layers.
Gypsum is added to prevent shale swelling. When lime or gypsum is added to Bentonite-treated 
mud, sodium Montmorilonite will convert to calcium Montmorilonite, which first produces 
flocculation and eventually aggregation of the Montmorilonite (see Figure 5-10). Caustic soda 
is added for pH control to suppress further dissolution of Ca++. Lignosulphate is added for 
deflocculating. CMC may be added for fluid control. Then we get gyp mud.
If a lot of swellable clays have to be drilled through, apply gypsum mud; Pre-hydrate Na+- 
Bentonite Add gypsum to the mud. Gypsum (Ca SO4) dissolves and Ca++ ions are formed. 
First reaction causes flocculation. Over time Ca++ replaces Na+ in Bentonite platelets, to make 
Ca++ – Bentonite and they aggregate and viscosity goes down. But from now on, there is an 
access of Ca++ in the mud (and in filtrate). No new flocculation will occur, and swellable clay 
does not swell much.

The pH value of WBM are held at 9–11 to increase the solubility of anionic compounds.
a)	 The change in OH- concentration required to increase the pH from a particular value to another 
is given by:
	
∆ [OH-] = ∆ [OH-] final – ∆ [OH-] initial
	
∆ [OH-] = 10(11-14) – 10(7.5-14) = 0.001 – 0.000000316 = 0.00099 mol/l 
b)	 Mass of NaOH in g/l = concentration molecular weight (of Caustic Soda)
	
= 0.00099 moles/l (23 + 16+1) g/moles = 0.0198 g /l
c)	 K+ is geometrically suiting in between the Na-Montmorilonite platelets, and leads to higher 
platelet attraction (low swelling) than for Na-Montmorilonite. Recall in your chemistry or 
periodic table (Group 1) that potassium (atom # 20) is more reactive than sodium (atom 
# 11). Why? The atomic radius of potassium is larger than that of sodium. Therefore, the single 
valence electron that exists for all alkali metal is located further away from the nucleus for 
potassium than sodium. This results in less energy required to remove that valence electron 
from potassium than from sodium, leading to increased reactivity. This trend continues as you 
move down Group 1 on the periodic table; i.e. Rubidium is more reactive than K.
d)	 The mud must have sufficient viscosity & velocity to exceed the settling velocity of the cuttings.
e)	 The mud must be thixotropic, i.e. must have the ability to gel when stationary or at low laminar 
flow, but becomes less viscous during circulation or when rigorously shaken by the shale shaker.
f)	 A large proportion of the mechanical energy (in the form of WOB and rotation) and hydraulic 
energy will generate friction and is dissipated as heat. Drilling fluid, which has a high heat 
capacity, is voluminous (typically 100 m3) and absorbs this heat and allows the drill bit and 
the rest of the drill string not to be intensely heated.
g)	 The drilling fluid prevents blowouts by providing a hydrostatic pressure at least greater than 
the formation pressure.

b)	 100 PPM = 100 · 1.703 = 170 s-1
At a shear rate of 170 s-1 the shear stress is seen in Table 2-1 to be 21.5 Pa. To answer the 
question please estimate the shear stress at this shear rate and compare.
 
τB-H,170 = 27.4 Pa
 
τP-L,170 = 21.5 Pa
P-L is obviously best.
c)	 To answer the question we need to know at which shear rate to compare the two models. Given

Bingham/Power-law
a)	 The flow curve (τ vs. γ) data show obviously closer nearness to the Power-low model, especially 
for low shear rates. The Bingham model reads about 12 Pa higher than the measured data. To 
verify we need model constants:

We observe that the Bingham over predict as expected, while P-L fits well.
b)	 This is a time-effect which occurs while performing rheological readings in the lab. The 
time being spent while performing the test at low speed gives the colloidal clay particles the 
possibility to flocculate (edge to face). The flocculation process is much more pronounced at 
low shear rates.

100 rpm (already measured)
	
	
	
	
	
800 rpm = 36.5 Pa (extrapolated)
From this we see that the Bingham model suits the mud is flow curve best at 50 s-1, since τ50B-M is 
much closer to the real data than τ50 P-L, while at higher shear rates Power law is the better one.
b)	 Plug flow will occur at any laminar flow since shear stress is low in the middle of the pipe. The 
Bingham model predicts an YP = 9.1 Pa. This is a theoretical value, but given time at steady-state 
laminar flow, gel strength will develop, in fact approaching the level of the YP. Shear stresses 
below this level will lead to gel (flocculation) as shown in Figure 2-3.2

To solve equation (10) we suggest iteration. Start with n = 0,5, and we get:
	
	
	
	
1.976 (22.6 – 18.4) 	
= 32.0 – 22.6
	
	
	
	
8.3	
	
	
= 9.4	
	
-1.1
Now try n = 0.52:
	
	
	
	
1.976 (25.6 – 20,7)	
= 36.7 – 2536
	
	
	
	
9.6	
	
	
= 11,1	 =	
-1.5
We are moving away. Try n = 0.48:
	
	
	
	
1.976 (20.0 -16,4)	
=27.8 – 20
	
	
	
	
7.01	
	
	
= -7.8	 =	
-0.7
Further iteration with decreasing n to 0.35 gives a deviation cloe to 0  n = 0.35. When n is 
found, the other constants can be found easily. Now K = 3.4, resulting in ߬௬ = – 13 På.
c2) Non-linear regression. Please refer to textbook Chapter 10.6 of how to step-wise go about in 
Excel to determine the constants.

Herschel-Bulkley is determined through the field method: iteration and elimination, based on the three 
upper readings;

Now we test the models at ߛൌͳͲݏିଵ
߬௉௅ൌͲǤͷʹ ή ͳͲ଴Ǥହହ଺

߬ு஻ൌʹ ൅ͲǤͷʹ ή ߛ଴Ǥହହ଺	
= 3.1 Pa
Since the solution is 3.0 Pa the H-B is closest. The Bingham model is relatively far away, as expected, 
since theoretical model is based only on the two upper readings, which is far from the tested shear rate. 
Therefore it is, as stated in the text book, recommended to apply the data points closest to the actual 
shear rate of the model. Since these specifics are not always known ahead of time, the next best is to use 
all the data points (regressi9on), not only the two upper ones or a few selected ones.

For the Newtonian model we determine the viscosity at the estimated shear rate γ = 8v/d =  
8 . 2.12 /0.1 = 169.6 s-1. Here the viscosity is:

Laminar pressure loss equations give these results:
	
Newton: 	
∆pN = 32 µ L v / d2 = 32 . 0.0507 .1000 . 2.12 / 0.10 = 
3.4 .105 Pa
	
Power-law:	
∆pPL = 4K(8v/d . (3n+1)/4n)n . 1/d . L 
	
	
	
= 4. 0.52 (8. 2.12 /0.1 . 2.68/2.24)0.56 . 1/0.1 . 1 000 = 
4.1. 105 Pa 
	
Bingham: 	
∆pBH = 32 . 0.016 . 1 000 . 2.12 /0.12 + 16 . 1 000 . 9 / 3 . 0.1 =5.9 .105 Pa 
We observe that Bingham “aims” high at low shear rates, and will always produce higher results 
than the Power-law model at low shear rates. 
b)	 Calculated shear rate for all models:
	
γNewt = 8v/d = 8 . 2.12 / 0.1 = 170 s-1 
	
γPL = 8v/d .(3n + 1)/ 4n = 170 . (3 . 0.56 + 1 )/ 4 . 0.56 = 203 s-1
	
γBH = 8v/d +t0 / (3mpl) = 8·2.12 / 0.1 + 9 / (3·0.016) =170 + 188 = 358 s-1
We read from Figure 3-4 for all the models; 
 
tΝ = 8.5 Pa at 170 s-1: 
 
tPL = 10 Pa at 203 s-1: 
 
τBH = 14 Pa at 358 s-1: 
And the resulting pressure loss becomes:
	
ΔpN = 8.5 . 1000 / 0.1 . 4 =	
	
	
3.4 . 105 Pa
	
ΔpP-L = 10 . 1000 / 0.1 . 4 = 	
	
	
4.0 . 105 Pa
	
ΔpBH = 14 . 1000 / 0.1 . 4 =	
	
	
5.6 . 105 Pa

One conclusion is that the two non-Newtonian ordinary and universal models give similar

Bingham model gives the best answers. This is natural since the mud has a typical Binghamian 
characteristic at laminar flow. We could also have compared the two by using the normal pressure loss 
models. We must then first determine the specific viscosity, just like for the universal. See also Exercise 3.4 
in this regard.

NRe increases for Newtonian fluids when di increases, while for Power law fluids it 
is reversed.
The physical explanation for this behavior is the forced streamlining of the flow in narrow 
gaps. Out in the ocean, on the other hand, ocean water turns turbulent at very low shear rates.

Pressure loss. Field data
Check first the solution for 5 spm. Then repeat for the remaining speeds. Here a check is made only 
for the 5 spm case. Here we think the flow is laminar. Pressure reading at 5 spm = 13 bars. To check 
theoretical ∆p at 5 spm we go through these steps:

The task was to evaluate and compare the estimated pressure with the recorded pump pressure. As 
exemplified at 5 spm flow, the theory compared to reality, 11.8 vs. 13, differed by -9%. One possible 
explanation for this difference is that the theoretical Power law underestimates the real shear rate. Other 
error sources exist; selecting the correct rheology model; fluid is very Binghamian. When does flow turn 
from laminar to turbulence? In real wells it turns turbulent earlier than theoretically predicted, due to 
roughness and uneven flow path. Turbulent pressure loss is highly empirical.
3.10	
Pressure loss. Effects of rotation
During rotation of the pipe, external energy is added to the fluid (from the top drive). If the pipe is 
exposed to strict, controlled rotation the mud will be stirred (like in a viscometer). The mud is non-
Newtonian and shear-thinning (n < 1.0) during laminar flow. For laminar flow at SPM = 5, the friction 
loss will be reduced from 13 at pure flow to 8 bars at added rotation. 
To check this fact we will try to estimate the reduction in effective viscosity. Assume the fluid behaves 
according to the Power-Law.
Step 1:	 Find ݒҧ௥௢௧ = peripherical velocity of pipe. One rotation corresponds to the length 2πr. The outer 
wall velocity is zero. Divide by 2 to obtain the average of the two extreme velocities:

s-1 (the two were assumed to be additive). We compare the effect of rotation in terms of changes 
in the Newtonian viscosity: Use the flow curve in Figure 3-10. Here we are left to assume the 
shear stress at these low shear rate values. From the rheological data in Task 2-2 we select the 
smallest recordable one, 3 Pa.
 
µ5 spm = τ / γ = 1 / 1.5 = 0.67 Pas 
 
µ5 spm+rotation at 100 rpm = τ / γ = 8 / (1.5 + 30) = 0.25 Pas
We see that the effective viscosity has reduced to less than half of its original at that flow rate. 
Note also that the shear stress seen from the pump (SPP) is not increased, it is “for free”, only 
the effective viscosity is decreased, as shown in Figure 3-10.

Figure 3-10: Effect of rotations on the rheology results in new ECD for instance at the low shear stress of 10 Pa.
If the pipe is exposed to vigorous rotation and possibly vibrations, which often is the case in a real well, 
then additional turbulence will introduce higher pressure loss, not a lower one. However, at the highest 
pump speed (100 spm) flow is already turbulent and the complex motion of the drill string will only 
negligibly influence the pressure.

Swab pressure. Clinging factor 
a)	 Make a detailed drawing. The clinging fluid is defined by Rcling in Figure 3-12, causing a certain 
volume to accompany the string upwards.
b)	 Identify an expression of the velocity profile with the correct boundary condition;
	
v(r)r=R0 = 0 
	
v(r)r=Rcling = 0 
	
v(r)r=Ri = vp
From the velocity profile we can obtain the cling volume pr. unit time:

Effect pump
Smallest liner
q
Figure 4-1: Maximum pump pressure for each liner (left) and maximum effect for the same (right) 
Power or effect = E = p · q, is expressed in Horse Power (HP) or in watt (W). As shown in 
Figure 4-1 (to the right) the maximum effect is constant for all liners.
Volumetric efficiency = 0.96 for new pumps. When it has reduced to 0.93 the pump has to be 
upgraded (replace valves and / or piston / liner).
b)	 Parallel → higher q, used for upper wellbore sections. Series → higher p (only for very special 
application, not done for mud pumps).
c)	 Centrifugal pumps can deliver high flow rate but limited pressure (max 3 bars) since there is 
an open slot between statot and rotor.
d)	 Knocking is a result of high acceleration. At the highest acceleration the water is not able to 
fully follow the high accelleration, and the following takes place: -> vacuum effect -> vapor 
pressure is surpassed and water starts boiling (vapor bubbles are formed on the steel surface) 
-> implosion of vapor bubbles during retardation of piston movement  repeated shock vaves 
weakenes the steel.

b)	 In order to cover the complete range of possible flow rates, we see from the data and the pump 
characteristics that the 6¾˝ liner has a qmax of 0.0422. Only this liner is large enough to supply 
the qmax of 0.04 m3/s if necessary. Intuitively we would select the smallest liner possible, the 
5½˝, since it has the highest available pressure. This is what we also recommend. Alternatively 
we could check what optimal flow rate each liner produced at this depth:

We observe that the optimal flow rate is outside the boundaries for 5.5, 5.75 and 6. We could 
claim that the 6.25˝ liner is the smallest liner with its optimm within the rang and therefore 
select that one.
An expression of optimal bit pressure is found from the same optimal solution as above.

b)	 Only the case of vertical wells is presented here. The horizontal case is solved identically, only 
the flow rate has higher importance / higher upper boundaries. Within the narrow flow rate 
interval for vertical wells, the 6¼˝ liner covers the maximum flow rate. First check what is the 
optimum flow rate for each of the liners, from 6¼˝ and downwards at 1 950 mMD. Since the 
boundary conditions do not change with depth, intuitively we would suggest that the smallest 
liner possible should be selected, which we do; the 5½˝ liner. Just for the interest we also check 
the optimal flow rate at the two depths:

We observe that when drilling at 4 000 m the hydraulic program is inside the theoretical limits, 
but not while drilling at 1 950 m. Our suggestion is therefore to use the qmax, 0.028, until a 
depth at which qopt is reached:

Then use qopt till TD. If change of liner is allowed with inclreasing depth, then a better solution 
is to select the liner corresponding to optimum flow rate.

d)	 From Table 4-6 in the Task section we can see that between 1 500 and 3 000 m there are two 
potential options. However, from Figure 4-6 above we already know that at 1 852 m we are 
inside pump range I, and applying the 5½˝ liner. We also see that the maximum flow rate of 
the 5½˝ liner is the optimum one for most of its operational time. This has already been shown

a)	 Find first what working area prevails in the boundary zone between pump are II and I, which

Wellbore challenges
5	 Wellbore challenges
5.1	
Filtration control 
a)	 Fluid loss can be optimized in three ways: 
1.	 Ensure a good filter in the wellbore wall by including a wide range of particles in the 
mud (Bentonite, Barite and cuttings are already there. It may be enough)
2.	 Ensure a good filter cake by making sure the mud is dispersed
3.	 Losses through the filter cake in WBM are treated by increasing the viscosity of the 
fluid phase (starch, CMC and sodium polyacrylate). OBM rarely requires such additives
b)	 Increased fluid loss is detected through the filter press test. Depending on the fluid loss, its 
rheology and other test results you normally find out which of the 3 qualities in question a) 
above are the problem. See more details in textbook Chapter 2.
c)	 Filtrate will lead to approximately the same invasion depth (typically 3 feet). Particles will invade 
both sands typically 1 ft, assuming the particle size distribution of the added or the existing 
particles in the mud covers at least the range of 1/7th to 1/3rd of the pore size distribution. 
That assumption is normally fulfilled through the presence of Bentonite / polymers + Barite 
+ cuttings.

c)	 Obtain knowledge of the sandstone’s pore size distribution. Apply 
•	 Particles in the mud with a mean size = ⅓ of pore size.
•	 Colloidal particles must be dispersed
•	 Base fluid viscosity can be increased.
For OBM the particle distribution is manly taken care of by emulsified water droplets, with a 
wide droplet distribution.
Follow up by making a filter press test every 30 min. In case filter loss increases, every bullet point 
above must be evaluated through more tests, viscosity especially and specific countermeasures 
are set in motion.
Filter test is important mainly to obtain a thin and tight filter cake to avoid stuck. Secondly, 
while drilling in the reservoir, to minimize fm-damage.
Filter loss is increasing because we are drilling trough contaminants like salt, chalk, etc., which are 
causing flocculation; resulting in thick filter cake and perhaps in stuck pipe.
Solution/explanation: Add thinners/-dispersants/deflocculators.
If massive attack; dump the returning mud.

been established which is in equilibrium between erosional and depositional forces. The bed 
height is a result of the steady state process. Settling and lifting of cuttings is a function of 
flow rate, ROP, etc. The bed height can be estimated theoretically. We select not to do that, but 
rather assume that a certain % of the generated cuttings are left behind in the wellbore. E.g. 
10% of the wellbore cross sectional area is in average filled with cuttings. This means 10% of 
what is drilled out is left in the well. The initial concentration is accordingly reduced by 10%;
	
c2 = c1 . (1 – 0.1) = 0.2 . 0.9 = 0.018

b)	 In the vertical section the concentration will increase due to the slipping of cuttings, expressed 
through the transport ratio Rt. This could have been estimated through Stokes Law. We select 
here just to assume a typical value of Rt, which is 0.75. We then have:
	
c3 = c2 / Rt = 0.018 / 0.75 = 0.024
c)	 The cuttings removal forces are opposed by gravity and cohesive forces. Gravitational forces 
are given by Stokes law. Removal forces are given by drag and lift forces. The drag force is a 
function of particle Reynolds number and spherisity. The drag and lift forces can be developed 
info the critical lift velocity or rolling velocity. String RPM will induce a drag force onto the 
cuttings, referred to as the viscous coupling. At a given cuttings feed rate, a stationary bed 
height will form as a function of the equilibrium state between all involved input variables, 
some eroding, some building.
d)	 Here the bed height will be higher due to higher cross sectional area and thus lower fluid 
velocity, assuming the entrance effects do not ruin this assumption. Settling rate will increase, 
but first after the entrance effects are passed. When BHA during tripping is shoveling much 
cuttings into a narrower wellbore it is easy to imagine that the BHA may become jammed.

e)	 At least five issues are related to poor solids control: 
•	 Building of solids bed → Mechanical stuck pipe
•	 Building of viscosity / high gel → high pressure losses → high ECD → fracture
•	 High cuttings concentration in annulus → higher mud density in annulus → high 
ECD → lower ROP
•	 Higher mechanical friction → loss of WOB → reduced ROP
•	 Loss of filter control → thicker mud cake → differential sticking

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

ECD. Barite
Start by converting to SI units. When 
PXG
U
> ~ 1.8 kg/l, the barite concentration is high. At stillstand, 
most mud types quickly develop a yield point, and barite is suspended in the gelled mud. During 
pumping of mud in laminar mode, any existing gel is broken, and barite will not be held in suspension as 
during stillstand with gelled mud. However, the mud will under these conditions exhibit a high effective 
viscosity but barite will, nevertheless, slip slowly downwards due to gravity. Agglomeration may also 
affect the settling rate. Barite has a specific density of 4.2, and an average particle size of approximately 
20 μm. In accordance with Stokes’s law of settling, barite particles will settle, but as indicated above, 
very slowly. However, wellbore inclination will shorten the settling distance to only a few centimetres, 
and a stratified bed of barite and cuttings will form. The stratified layers of solids will, when the angle 
of repose is surpassed, slide downwards. The critical angle of repose in found mainly in the build-up 
section of the well, and here sliding takes place. After the first “landslide”, the barite concentration in the 
mud has become lower and accordingly, also the viscosity. Barite settling will now be a fraction faster, 
and the process continues at accelerated speed. The self-preserving dynamics may lead to separation of 
almost all the barite in the fluid in the build-up section, especially during still stand after tripping-out 
of the hole. The pile of Barite at the bottom of the build-up section may cause pipe sticking. Worse is 
the reduction of mud weight. It may disrupt the safety.
The following summary of guidelines to obtain efficient hole-cleaning is based on field experiences and 
on many laboratory investigations:
a)	 Apply micro barite or equivalent. Such material systems have an average particle size of 2 μm
b)	 Use of top-drive to allow for pipe rotation and redistribution of the settling barite and cuttings 
while tripping and drilling
c)	 Maximize fluid velocity during drilling and reaming by increasing pumping output and/or use 
large diameter drill string. This improves hydraulic and agitation of cuttings. Use in addition 
downhole flow enhancers
d)	 Design mud rheology so that it enhances turbulence in the annulus (if ECD allows). Turbulent 
flow will bring the cuttings and barite back into the flow stream if point 3 above “failed”
e)	 Perform frequent wiper trips
5.8	
ECD. Flow rate & fluid consistency
a)	 In order to determine the ECD we need to estimate the pressure loss in the annulus. The mud 
has some gel, so we assume the Bingham model will suit well.

We assume slip; Rt = 0.75
	
ccuttings = 0.038 / 0.75 = 0.051

Water solution: Distilled water thus has a water activity of 1.00. All water molecules are 
freely moving around, not electrostatically bound to salt ions. Aw will diminish at increasing 
salt content.
Pore water: Find the Aw of clay through its in situ weight and then by comparing with clays 
with known Aw. Thus Aw of water phase is determined, and type of salt.
b)	 Salt ions attract polar water and make it in-active. Distilled water has a water activity 1.0 
whereas for saline water it is less than 1.0.
c)	 Clay swelling leads to increased pressure according to this equation:

Vw = Molar volume of water vapor; 
Most shale formations contain water since shale is (water wet). Water sensitive clay materials, 
such as smectite, illite and mixed – layer clays, will adsorb water and swell. This leads to an 
elevated localized pressure around the wellbore. The pressure may surpass the material strength; 
the material will disintegrate and collapse. Water is transported into the shale through different 
mechanisms (hydraulic pressure, osmosis, diffusion etc.).
d)	 Adding K-salt to WBM. Dissolved salt will bind water and hinder it to evaporate; the water vapor 
pressure will declines and so also the measured Aw. The Aw is inversely proportional to salinity.
e)	 If Aw, OBM ≥ Aw, pore, will be drawn from the OBM and into the formation, making the shale 
swell brittle.
If Aw, 	 OBM ≤ Aw, pore, the shale will become brittle. 
Yes, it can be reduced by creating a filter in the shale. This can be done by adding particles to 
the water phase where the average particle size distribution െ෥ 1/3 of the average pore throat 
size distribution.

Shale stability
a)	 Using Figure 5-6 in the task section a calcium chloride concentration of 28.2% by weight is 
needed to give an activity of 0.69.
b)	 Take an “in-situ” cut of the core, crush it and place it in a desiccator (completely air tight), 
expose it to different humilities (vapour pressure) through designed brines. When weight of the 
exposed sample has been converted to typical weight evolution of this type of shale. Through 
this comparison the water activity in the core can be determined. Since this is the water activity 
of the shale’s pore water, the water activity on the mud should be identical to avoid swelling 
or shrinking of the shale.

This depends on the wettability (which governs the θ). For oil to be the wetting phase against 
the formation/cuttings/steel a wetting agent must be added to the base oil. If water is emulsified 
into the oil, the water activity of the water phase must be controlled properly.
Emulsifier is used to reduce the surface tension between oil and water, enabling smaller droplets, 
enhancing stability. Wetting agents make sure that oil is wetting the shale.

Shale stability
a)	 By adding salt to the mud’s water phase corresponding to Aw of pore water. No osmotic force 
between mud and clay, and thus no water driven swelling. There are 5 ingredients in OBM, 
the Aw and the salt type should be as close to pore water’s as possible.
1.	 Base oil
2.	 Water
3.	 Emulsifier (surface active additive I)
4.	 Surface wetting (surface active additive II)
5.	 Salt
a)	 K+ is geometrically suitable in between Montmorilonite platelets and leads to high platelet 
attraction (low swelling).
b)	 The higher concentration, the more Na++ is exchanged.
c)	 Yes, it can be reduced by creating a filter in the shale. This can be done by adding particles to 
the water phase where the average particle size distribution െ෥ 1/3 of the average pore throat 
size distribution.

Wellbore problems 
a)	 Lots of material (cuttings, cavings, sloughing shale) combined with small and large washouts 
where material tends to accumulate. During tripping, material is scraped and squeezed. 
Figure 5-7. Differential sticking mechanism.
Differential sticking: Once the drill string touches the wellbore wall, the mud pressure, which is 
higher than the formation fluid pressure, holds the string in place. As mud cake builds around 
the string, a pressure seal is formed and sticking occurs as shown in Figure 5-7.

Wellbore challenges
b)	 The consequences of a stuck pipe are very costly. They include:
•	 Lost drilling time spent on freeing the pipe, and on fishing if not ask to jar out string.
•	 Abandon tools in the hole because fishing was given up.
Rules of Thumb
1.	 Begin working the string immediately. Jar in the opposite direction to the pipe movement 
prior to becoming stuck.
2.	 Work the pipe to the limits.
3.	 If getting movement down, concentrate on expanding downward movement – and 
vice versa.
4.	 In cases of hole bridging/packing off, concentrate on downward working. Increase 
applied working force in gradual increments up to the maximum.
c)	 Salt tends to “flow” at high temperature and pressure. Use high mud weight and a mud that 
tend to dissolve salt (to keep the wellbore diameter as large as possible).
WBM can be used with some additives. Halite has little creep tendency.
d)	 Dominating mechanisms at lost circulation are:
--
low pressure window
--
high ECD (for many reasons)
Counter measures are:
--
improved hole cleaning
--
improved ECD – control

Wellbore breathing (ballooning) (any two sentence is enough for get full marks) 
•	 The onset of wellbore breathing, often referred to as wellbore ballooning, is typically an indicator 
of imminent lost circulation. 
•	 Wellbore breathing is associated with fractures that open when annular pressure is applied to 
the Wellbore and close when the pressure is reduced. 
•	 These fractures fill with drilling fluid when open and subsequently return the fluid is observed 
as a flow out of the Wellbore when the pumps are off.
•	 One of the more severe consequences of wellbore breathing is the misinterpretation of the 
observed flow as a kick when the pumps are shut down. 
•	 Implementing well-control procedures and increasing the mud weight is often enough to 
propagate the existing fractures leading to severe loss of circulation, a situation that is much 
more difficult to manage.
