Prelude
The torchlight seemed such a meager thing against the unrelenting dark-
ness of the dwarven caves. The smoky air drifted around Delly Curtie,
irritating her eyes and throat, much as the continual grumbling and
complaining of the other humans in the large common room irritated her
sensibilities. Steward Regis had graciously given over a considerable suite of
rooms to those seemingly ungrateful people, refugees all from the many
settlements sacked by brutish King Obould and his orcs in their southern trek.
Delly reminded herself not to be too judgmental of the folk. All of them had
suffered grievous losses, with many being the only remaining member of a
murdered family, with three being the only remaining citizens of an entirely
sacked community! And the conditions, as decent as Regis and Bruenor tried
to make them, were not fitting for a human.
That thought struck hard at Delly's sensibilities, and she glanced back over
her shoulder at her toddler, Colson, asleep—finally!—in a small crib. Cottie
Cooperson, a spindly-armed woman with thin straw hair and eyes that
drooped under the weight of a great loss, sat beside the sleeping toddler, her
arms crossed tightly over her chest as she rocked back and forth, back and
forth.
Remembering her own murdered baby, Delly knew.
That horrific thought sobered Delly, to be sure. Colson wasn't really Delly's
child, not by birth. But she had adopted the baby girl, as Wulfgar had adopted
Colson and in turn had taken on Delly as his traveling companion and wife.
Delly had followed him to Mithral Hall willingly, eagerly even, and had thought
herself a good and generous person in granting him his adventurous spirit, in
standing beside him through what he had needed without regard for her own
desires.
Delly's smile was more sad than joyous. It was perhaps the first time the
young woman had ever thought of herself as good and generous.
But the dwarven walls were closing in on her.
Never had Delly Curtie imagined that she could harbor wistful memories of
her street life in Luskan, living wild and on the edge, half-drunk most of the
time and in the arms of a different man night after night. She thought of clever
Morik, a wonderful lover, and of Arumn Gardpeck, the tavern-keeper who had
been as a father to her. She thought of Josi Puddles, too, and found in those
recollections of his undeniably stupid grin some measure of comfort.
"Nah, ye're being silly," the woman muttered under her breath.
She shook her head to throw those memories aside. This was her life now,
with Wulfgar and the others. The dwarves of Clan Battlehammer were goodly
folk, she told herself. Often eccentric, always kind and many times simply and
playfully absurd, they were a lovable lot beneath their typically gruff exteriors.
Some wore outrageous clothing or armor, others carried strange and
ridiculous names, and most wild and absurd beards, but the clan showed
Delly a measure of heart that she had never before seen, other than from
Arumn perhaps. They treated her as kin, or tried to, for the differences
remained.
Undeniably so.
Differences of preference, human to dwarf, like the stifling air of the
caves—air that would grow even more stagnant, no doubt, since both exterior

doors of Mithral Hall had been closed and barricaded.
"Ah, but to feel the wind and sun on my face once more!" a woman from
across the common room shouted, lifting a flagon of mead in toast, as if she
had read Delly's every thought.
From all across the room, mugs came up in response and clanged
together. The group, almost all of them, were well on their way to
drunkenness yet again, Delly realized. They had no place to fit in, and their
drinking was as much to alleviate their helpless frustration as to dull the
horrible memories of Obould's march through their respective communities.
Delly checked on Colson again and filtered about the tables. She had
agreed to tend to the group, calling upon her experiences as a serving wench
in Luskan. She caught bits of conversation wherever she passed, and every
thought found a hold on her, and bit at what little contentment remained within
her heart.
"I'm going to set up a smithy in Silverymoon," one man proclaimed.
"Bah, Silverymoon!" another argued, sounding very much like a dwarf with
his rough dialect. "Silverymoon's nothing but a bunch of dancing elves.
Get ye to Sundabar. Ye're sure to find a better livelihood in a town of folk
who know proper business."
"Silverymoon's more accepting," a woman from another table argued. "And
more beautiful, by all tellings."
Those were almost the very same words that Delly had once heard to
describe Mithral Hall. In many ways, the Hall had lived up to its reputation.
Certainly the reception Bruenor and his kin had given her had been nothing
short of wonderful, in their unique, dwarven way. And Mithral Hall was as
amazing a sight as Luskan's harbor, to be sure. Yet it was a sight that quickly
melted into sameness, Delly had come to know.
She made her way across the room, veering back toward Colson, who was
still sleeping but had begun that same scratchy cough that Delly had been
hearing from all the humans in the smoky tunnels.
"I'm right grateful enough to Steward Regis and King Bruenor," she heard
one woman say, again as if reading her very thoughts, "but here's no place for
a person!" The woman lifted her flagon. "Silverymoon or Sundabar, then!" she
toasted, to many cheers. "Or anywhere else ye might be seeing the sun and
the stars!"
"Everlund!" another man cried.
In the stark crib on the cold stone floor beside Delly Curtie, Colson coughed
again.
Beside the baby girl, Cottie Cooperson swayed.

PART ONE
ORC AMBITIONS
I look upon the hillside, quiet now except for the birds. That's all there is.
The birds, cawing and cackling and poking their beaks into unseeing eyeballs.
Crows do not circle before they alight on a field strewn with the dead. They fly
as the bee to a flower, straight for their goal, with so great a feast before
them. They are the cleaners, along with the crawling insects, the rain, and the
unending wind.
And the passage of time. There is always that. The turn of the day, of the
season, of the year.
When it is done, all that is left are the bones and the stones. The screams
are gone, the smell is gone. The blood is washed away. The fattened birds
take with them in their departing flights all that identified these fallen warriors
as individuals.
Leaving the bones and stones, to mingle and mix. As the wind or the rain
break apart the skeletons and filter them together, as the passage of time
buries some, what is left becomes indistinguishable, perhaps, to all but the
most careful of observers. Who will remember those who died here, and what
have they gained to compensate for all that they, on both sides, lost?
The look upon a dwarf's face when battle is upon him would argue, surely,
that the price is worth the effort, that warfare, when it comes to a dwarven
nation, is a noble cause. Nothing to a dwarf is more revered than fighting to
help a friend; theirs is a community bound tightly by loyalty, by blood shared
and blood spilled.
And so, in the life of an individual, perhaps this is a good way to die, a
worthy end to a life lived honorably, or even to a life made worthy by this last
ultimate sacrifice.
I cannot help but wonder, though, in the larger context, what of the overall?
What of the price, the worth, and the gain? Will Obould accomplish anything
worth the hundreds, perhaps thousands of his dead? Will he gain anything
long-lasting? Will the dwarven stand made out here on this high cliff bring
Bruenor's people anything worthwhile? Could they not have slipped into
Mithral Hall, to tunnels so much more easily defended?
And a hundred years from now, when there remains only dust, will anyone
care?
I wonder what fuels the fires that burn images of glorious battle into the
hearts of so many of the sentient races, my own paramount among them. I
look at the carnage on the slope and I see the inevitable sight of emptiness. I
imagine the cries of pain. I hear in my head the calls for loved ones when the
dying warrior knows his last moment is upon him. I see a tower fall with my
dearest friend atop it. Surely the tangible remnants, the rubble and the bones,
are hardly worth the moment of battle, but is there, I wonder, something less
tangible here, something of a greater place? Or is there, perhaps—and this is
my fear—something of a delusion to it all that drives us to war, again and
again?
Along that latter line of thought, is it within us all, when the memories of war
have faded, to so want to be a part of something great that we throw aside the
quiet, the calm, the mundane, the peace itself? Do we collectively come to
equate peace with boredom and complacency? Perhaps we hold these

embers of war within us, dulled only by sharp memories of the pain and the
loss, and when that smothering blanket dissipates with the passage of healing
time, those fires flare again to life. I saw this within myself, to a smaller extent,
when I realized and admitted to myself that I was not a being of comfort and
complacency, that only by the wind on my face, the trails beneath my feet,
and the adventure along the road could I truly be happy.
I'll walk those trails indeed, but it seems to me that it is another thing all
together to carry an army along beside me, as Obould has done. For there is
the consideration of a larger morality here, shown so starkly in the bones
among the stones. We rush to the call of arms, to the rally, to the glory, but
what of those caught in the path of this thirst for greatness?
Who will remember those who died here, and what have they gained to
compensate for all that they, on both sides, lost?
Whenever we lose a loved one, we resolve, inevitably, to never forget, to
remember that dear person for all our living days. But we the living contend
with the present, and the present often commands all of our attention. And so
as the years pass, we do not remember those who have gone before us every
day, or even every tenday. Then comes the guilt, for if I am not remembering
Zaknafein my father, my mentor, who sacrificed himself for me, then who is?
And if no one is, then perhaps he really is gone. As the years pass, the guilt
will lessen, because we forget more consistently and the pendulum turns in
our self-serving thoughts to applaud ourselves on those increasingly rare
occasions when we do remember! There is always the guilt, perhaps,
because we are self-centered creatures to the last. It is the truth of
individuality that cannot be denied. In the end, we, all of us, see the world
through our own, personal eyes.
I have heard parents express their fears of their own mortality soon after
the birth of a child. It is a fear that stays with a parent, to a great extent,
through the first dozen years of a child's life. It is not for the child that they
fear, should they die-though surely there is that worry, as well-but rather for
themselves. What father would accept his death before his child was truly old
enough to remember him?
For who better to put a face to the bones among the stones? Who better to
remember the sparkle in an eye before the crow comes a'calling?
I wish the crows would circle and the wind would carry them away, and the
faces would remain forever to remind us of the pain. When the clarion call to
glory sounds, before the armies anew trample the bones among the stones,
let the faces of the dead remind us of the cost.
It is a sobering sight before me, the red-splashed stones.
It is a striking warning in my ears, the cawing of the crows.

FOR THE LOVE OF ME SON
"We must be quicker!" the human commented, for the hundredth time that
morning, it seemed to the more than two-score dwarves moving in a line all
around him. Galen Firth appeared quite out of place in the torchlit, smoky
tunnels. Tall even for a human, he stood more than head and shoulders
above the short and sturdy bearded folk.
"I got me scouts up ahead, working as fast as scouts can work," replied
General Dagna, a venerable warrior of many battles.
The old dwarf stretched and straightened his still-broad shoulders, and
tucked his dirty yellow beard into his thick leather girdle, then considered
Galen with eyes still sharp, a scrutinizing gaze that had kept the dwarves of
Clan Battlehammer ducking defensively out of sight for many, many decades.
Dagna had been a well-respected warcommander for as long as anyone
could remember, longer than Bruenor had been king, and before
Shimmergloom the shadow dragon and his duergar minions had conquered
Mithral Hall. Dagna had climbed to power through deed, as a warrior and field
commander, and no one questioned his prowess in leading dwarves through
difficult conflicts. Many had expected Dagna to lead the defense of the cliff
face above Keeper's Dale, even ahead of venerable Banak Brawn-anvil.
When that had not come to pass, it was assumed Dagna would be named as
Steward of the Hall while Bruenor lay near death.
Indeed, both of those opportunities had been presented to Dagna, and by
those in a position to make either happen. But he had refused.
"Ye wouldn't have me tell me scouts to run along swifter and maybe give
themselves away to trolls and the like, now would ye?" Dagna asked.
Galen Firth rocked back on his heels a bit at that, but he didn't blink and he
didn't stand down. "I would have you move this column as swiftly as is
possible," he replied. "My town is sorely pressed, perhaps overrun, and in the
south, out of these infernal tunnels, many people may now be in dire
jeopardy. I would hope that such would prove an impetus to the dwarves who
claim to be our neighbors."
"I claim nothing," Dagna was fast to reply. "I do what me steward and me
king're telling me to do."
"And you care not at all for the fallen?"
Galen's blunt question caused several of the nearby dwarves to suck in
their breath, aimed as it was at Dagna, the proud dwarf who had lost his only
son only a few tendays earlier. Dagna stared long and hard at the man, bury-
ing the sting that prompted him to an angry response, remembering his place
and his duty.
"We're going as fast as we're going, and if ye're wanting to be going faster,
then ye're welcome to run up ahead. I'll tell me scouts to let ye pass without
hindrance. Might even be that I'll keep me march going over your dead body
when we find yerself troll-eaten in the corridors ahead. Might even be that yer
Nesme kin, if any're still about, will get rescued without ye." Dagna paused
and let his glare linger a moment longer, a silent assurance to Galen Firth that
he was hardly bluffing. "Then again, might not be."
That seemed to take some of the steam from Galen, and the man gave a
great "harrumph" and turned back to the tunnel ahead, stomping forward

deliberately.
Dagna was beside him in an instant, grabbing him hard by the arm.
"Pout if ye want to pout," the dwarf agreed, "but ye be doing it quietly."
Galen pulled himself away from the dwarf's vicelike grasp, and matched
Dagna's stare with his own glower.
Several nearby dwarves rolled their eyes at that and wondered if Dagna
would leave the fool squirming on the floor with a busted nose. Galen hadn't
been like that until very recently. The fifty dwarves had accompanied him out
of Mithral Hall many days before, with orders from Steward Regis to do what
they could to aid the beleaguered folk of Nesme. Their journey had been
steady and straightforward until they had been attacked in the tunnels by a
group of trolls. That fight had sent them running, a long way to the south and
out into the open air on the edges of the great swamp, the Trollmoors, but too
far to the east, by Galen Firth's reckoning. So they had started west, and had
found more tunnels. Against Galen's protests, Dagna had decided that his
group would be better served under cover of the westward-leading
underground corridors. More dirt than stone, with roots from trees and brush
dangling over their heads and with crawly things wriggling in the black dirt all
around them, the tunnels weren't like those they'd used to come south from
Mithral Hall. That only made Galen all the more miserable. The tunnels were
tighter, lower, and not as wide, which the dwarves thought a good thing,
particularly with huge and ugly trolls chasing them, but which only made
Galen spend half his time walking bent over.
"Ye're pushing the old one hard," a young dwarf, Fender Stouthammer by
name, remarked when they took their next break and meal. He and Galen
were off to the side of the main group, in a wider and higher area that allowed
Galen to stretch his legs a bit, though that had done little to improve his sour
mood.
"My cause is—"
"Known to us, and felt by us, every one," Fender assured him. "We're all
feeling for Mithral Hall in much the same way as ye're feeling for Nesme, don't
ye doubt."
The calming intent of Fender didn't find a hold on Galen, though, and he
wagged his long finger right in the dwarf's face, so close that Fender had to
hold himself back from just biting the digit off at the knuckle.
"What do you know of my feelings?" Galen growled at him. "Do you know
my son, huddled in the cold, perhaps? Slain, perhaps, or with trolls all about
him? Do you know the fate of my neighbors? Do you—"
"General Dagna just lost his boy," Fender interrupted, and that set Galen
back a bit.
"Dagnabbit was his name," Fender went on. "A mighty warrior and loyal
fellow, as are all his kin. He fell to the orc horde at Shallows, defending his
king and kin to the bitter end. He was Dagna's only boy, and with a career as
promising as that of his father. Long will dwarf bards sing the name of
Dagnabbit. But I'm guessing that thought's hardly cooling the boil in old
Dagna's blood, or hardly plastering the crack in his old heart. And now here ye
come, ye short-livin', cloud-sniffin' dolt, demanding this and demanding that,
as if yer own needs're more important than any we dwarves might be
knowing. Bah, I tried to take ye in stride. I tried to see yer side of the fear. But
ye know, ye're a pushy one, and one that's more likely to get boot-trampled

into the stone than to ever see yer home again if ye don't learn to shut yer
stupid mouth."
The obviously flabbergasted Galen Firth just sat there for a moment,
stuttering.
"Are you threatening me, a Rider of Nesme?" he finally managed to blurt.
"I'm telling ye, as a friend or as an enemy—choice is yer own to make—
that ye're not helping yerself or yer people by fighting with Dagna at every turn
in the tunnel."
"The tunnel...." the stubborn man spat back. "We should be out in the open
air, where we might hear the calls of my people, or see the light of their fires!"
"Or find ourselves surrounded by an army o' trolls, and wouldn't that smell
wonderful?"
Galen Firth gave a snort and held up his hand dismissively. Fender took
the cue, rose, and started away.
He did pause long enough to look back and offer, "Ye keep acting as if
ye're among enemies, or lessers. If all the folk o' Nesme are as stupid as
yerself—too dumb to know a friend when one's ready to help—then who's to
doubt that the trolls might be doing all the world a favor?"
Galen Firth trembled, and for a moment Fender half expected the man to
leap up and try to throttle him.
"I came to you, to Mithral Hall, in friendship!" he argued, loudly enough to
gain the attention of those dwarves crowded around Dagna in the main
chamber down the tunnel.
"Yerself came to Mithral Hall in need, offerin' nothing but complaints and
asking for more than we could give ye," Fender corrected. "And still Steward
Regis, and all the clan, accepted the responsibility of friendship—not the
burden, but the responsibility, ye dolt! We ain't here because we're owing
Nesme a damned thing, and we ain't here asking Nesme for a damned thing,
and in the end, even yerself should be smart enough to know that we're all
hopin' for the same thing here. And that thing's finding yer boy, and all the
others of yer town, alive and well."
The blunt assessment did give Galen pause and in that moment, before he
could decide whether to scream or to punch out, Fender rolled up to his feet,
offered a dismissive, "Bah!" and waved his calloused hands the man's way.
"Ye might be thinking to make a bit less noise, yeah?" came a voice from
the other direction, that of General Dagna, who glared at the two.
"Get along with ye, then," Fender said to Galen, and he waved at him
again. "Think on what I said or don't—it's yer own to choose."
Galen Firth slowly moved back from the dwarf, and toward the larger
gathering in the middle of the wider chamber. He walked more sidelong than
in any straightforward manner, though, as if warding his back from the pursuit
of words that had surely stung him.
Fender was glad of that, for the sake of Galen Firth and Nesme Town, if for
nothing else.

Tos'un Armgo, lithe and graceful, moved silently along the low corridor, a
dart clenched in his teeth and a serrated knife in his hand. The dark elf was
glad that the dwarves had gone back underground. He felt vulnerable and
exposed in the open air. A noise made him pause and huddle closer to the
rocky wall, his limber form melting into the jags and depressions. He pulled

his piwafwi, his enchanted drow cloak that could hide him from the most
scrutinizing of gazes, a bit tighter around him and turned his face to the stone,
peering out of the corner of only one eye.
A few moments passed. Tos'un relaxed as he heard the dwarves back at
their normal routines, eating and chatting. They thought they were safe back
in the tunnels, since they believed they had left the trolls far behind. What troll
could have tracked them over the last couple days since the skirmish, after
all?
No troll, Tos'un knew, and he smiled at the thought. For the dwarves hadn't
counted on their crude and beastlike enemies being accompanied by a pair of
dark elves. Tracking them, leading the two-headed troll named Prof-fit and his
smelly band back into this second stretch of tunnel, had been no difficult task
for Tos'un.
The drow glanced back the other way, where his companion, the priestess
Kaer'lic Suun Wett waited, crouched atop a boulder against the wall. Even
Tos'un would not have seen her there, buried under her piwafwi, except that
she shifted as he turned, lifting one arm out toward him.
Take down the sentry, her fingers flashed to him in the intricate sign
language of the drow elves. A prisoner is desirable.
Tos'un took a deep breath and instinctively reached for the dart he held
clenched in his teeth. Its tip was coated with drow poison, a paralyzing con-
coction of tremendous power that few could resist. How often had Tos'un
heard that command from Kaer'lic and his other two drow companions over
the last few years, for he among all the group had become the most adept at
gathering creatures for interrogation, especially when the target was part of a
larger group.
Tos'un paused and moved his free hand out where Kaer'lic could see, then
answered, Do we need bother? They are alert, and they are many.
Kaer'lic's fingers flashed back immediately, I would know if this is a remote
group or the forward scouts of Mithral Hall's army!
Tos'un's hand went right back to the dart. He didn't dare argue with Kaer'lic
on such matters. They were drow, and in the realm of the drow, even for a
group who was so far removed from the conventions of the great Under-dark
cities, females ranked higher than males, and priestesses of the Spider
Queen Lolth, like Kaer'lic, ranked highest of all.
The scout turned and slid down lower toward the floor, then began to half
walk, half crawl toward his target. He paused when he heard the dwarf raise
his voice, arguing with the single human among the troop. The drow moved to
a properly hidden vantage point and bided his time.
Soon enough, several of the dwarves farther along told the two to be quiet,
and the dwarf near to Tos'un grumbled something and waved the human
away.
Tos'un glanced back just once, then paused and listened until his sensitive
ears picked out the rumble of Proffit's closing war party.
Tos'un slithered in. His left arm struck first, jabbing the dart into the dwarf's
shoulder as his right hand came across, the serrated knife cutting a very
precise line on the dwarf's throat. It could easily have been a killing blow, but
Tos'un angled the blade so as not to cut the main veins, the same technique
he had recently used on a dwarf in a tower near the Surbrin. Eventually his
cut would prove mortal, but not for a long time, not until Kaer'lic could

intervene and with but a few minor spells granted by the Spider Queen save
the wretched creature's life.
Though, Tos'un thought, the prisoner would surely wish he had been
allowed to die.
The dwarf shifted fast and tried to cry out, but the drow had taken its vocal
chords. Then the dwarf tried to punch and lash out, but the poison was
already there. Blood streaming from the mortal wound, the dwarf crumbled
down to the stone, and Tos'un slithered back.
"Bah, ye're still a bigmouth!" came a quiet call from the main group. "Keep
still, will ya, Fender?"
Tos'un continued to retreat.
"Fender?" The call sounded more insistent.
Tos'un flattened against the corner of the wall and the floor, making himself
very small and all but invisible under his enchanted cloak.
"Fender!" a dwarf ahead of him cried, and Tos'un smiled at his cleverness,
knowing the stupid dwarves would surely think their poisoned companion
dead.
The camp began to stir, dwarves leaping up and grabbing their weapons,
and it occurred to Tos'un that Kaer'lic's decision to go for a captive might cost
Proffit and his trolls dearly. The price of the drow's initial assault had been the
element of surprise.
Of course, for the dark elf, that only made the attack all the more sweet.
*
*
*
* *
Some dwarves cried out for Fender, but the shout that rose above them all
came from Bonnerbas Ironcap, the dwarf closest to their fallen companion.
"Trolls!" he yelled, and even as the word registered with his companions,
so did the smell of the wretched brutes.
"Fall back to the fire!" General Dagna shouted.
Bonnerbas hesitated, for he was but one stride from poor Fender. He went
forward instead of back, and grabbed his friend by the collar. Fender flopped
over and Bonnerbas sucked in his breath, seeing clearly the line of bright
blood. The dwarf was limp, unfeeling.
Fender was dead, Bonnerbas believed, or soon would be.
He heard the charge of the trolls then, looked up, and realized that he
would soon join Fender in the halls of Moradin.
Bonnerbas fell back one step and took up his axe, swiping across viciously
and cutting a deep line across the arms of the nearest, low-bending troll. That
one fell back, stumbling to the side and toppling, but before it even hit the floor
it came flying ahead, bowled over by a pair of trolls charging forward at
Bonnerbas.
The dwarf swung again, and turned to flee, but a clawed troll hand hooked
his shoulder. Bonnerbas understood then the frightful strength of the brutes,
for suddenly he was flying backward, spinning and bouncing off legs as solid
as the trunks of tall trees. He stumbled and fell, winding up on his back. Still,
the furious dwarf flailed with his axe, and he scored a couple of hits. But the
trolls were all around him, were between him and Dagna and the others, and
poor Bonnerbas had nowhere to run.
One troll reached for him and he managed to swat the arm with enough
force to take it off at the elbow. That troll howled and fell back, but then, even
as the dwarf tried to roll to his side and stand the biggest and ugliest troll Bon-

nerbas had ever seen towered over him, a gruesome two-headed brute
staring at him with a wide smile on both of its twisted faces. It started to reach
down, and Bonnerbas started to swing.
As his axe flew past without hitting anything, the dwarf recognized the
dupe, and before he could bring the axe back over him, a huge foot appeared
above him and crashed down hard, stomping him into the stone.
Bonnerbas tried to struggle, but there was nothing he could do. He tried to
breathe, but the press was too great.
*

As the trolls pushed past the two fallen dwarves, General Dagna could only
growl and silently curse himself for allowing his force to be caught so
unawares. Questions and curses roiled in his mind. How could stupid, smelly
trolls have possibly followed them back into the tunnels? How could the brutes
have scouted and navigated the difficult approach to where Dagna had
thought it safe to break for a meal?
That jumble quickly calmed in the thoughts of the seasoned commander,
though, and he began barking orders to put his command in line. His first
thought was to move back into the lower tunnels, to get the trolls bent over
even more, but the dwarf's instincts told him to stay put, with a ready fire at
hand. He ordered his boys to form up a defensive hold on the far side of the
cooking fire. Dagna himself led the countercharge and the push, centering the
front line of five dwarves abreast and refusing to retreat against the troll press.
"Hold 'em fast!" he cried repeatedly as he smashed away with his war-
hammer. "Go to crushing!" he told the axe-wielding dwarf beside him. "Don't
yet cut through 'em if that's giving them a single step forward!"
The other dwarf, apparently catching on to the reasoning that they had to
hold the far side of the fire at all costs, flipped his axe over in his hand and
began pounding away at the closest troll, smashing it with the flat back of the
weapon to keep it at bay.
All the five dwarves did likewise, and Galen Firth ran up behind Dagna and
began slashing away with his fine long sword. They knew they would not be
able to hold for long, though, for more trolls crowded behind the front ranks,
the sheer weight of them driving the force forward.
Thinking that all of them were doomed, Dagna screamed in rage and
whacked so hard at the troll reaching for him that his nasty hammer tore the
creature's arm off at the elbow.
The troll didn't seem to even notice as it came forward, and Dagna realized
his error. He had over-swung the mark and was vulnerable.
But the troll backed suddenly, and Dagna ducked and cried out in surprise,
as the first of the torches, compliments of Galen Firth, entered the fray. The
man reached over and past the ducking Dagna and thrust the flaming torch at
the troll, and how the creature scrambled to get back from the fire!
Trolls were mighty opponents indeed, and it was said—and it was true—
that if you cut a troll into a hundred pieces, the result would be a hundred new
trolls, with every piece regenerating into an entirely new creature. They had a
weakness, though, one that every person in all the Realms knew well: fire
stopped that regeneration process.
Trolls didn't like fire.
More torches were quickly passed up to Dagna and the four others and the
trolls fell back, but only a step.

"Forward, then, for Fender and Bonnerbas!" Dagna cried, and all the
dwarves cheered.
But then came a shout from the other side of "Trolls in the tunnels!" and
another warning shout from directly behind Dagna.
All the tunnels were blocked. Dagna knew at once that his dwarves were
surrounded and had nowhere to run.
"How deep're we?" the general shouted.
"Roots in the ceiling," one dwarf answered. "Ain't too deep."
"Then get us through!" the old dwarf ordered
Immediately, those dwarves near to the center of the tightening ring went
into action. Two braced a third and lifted him high with his pickaxe, and he
began tearing away at the ground.
"Wet one down!" Dagna yelled, and he knew that it was all he had to say to
get his full meaning across to his trusted comrades.
"And tie him off!" came the appropriate addition, from more than one dwarf.
"Galen Firth, ye brace the hole!" Dagna roared at the human.
"What are you doing?" the man demanded. "Fight on, good dwarf, for we've
nowhere to run!"
Dagna thrust his torch forward and the troll facing him hopped back. The
dwarf turned fast and shoved at Galen.
"Turn about, ye dolt, and get us out o' here!"
A confused Galen did reluctantly turn from the fight just as daylight
appeared above the area to the left of the cooking fire. The two dwarves sup-
porting the miner gave a great heave, sending him up, where he caught on
and scrambled onto the surface.
"Clear!" he reported.
Galen understood the plan then, and rushed to the hole, where he imme-
diately began hoisting dwarves. After every one he had to pause, though, for
the dwarves up above began handing down more wood for the fire.
Dagna nodded and urged his line on, and the five fought furiously and
brilliantly, coordinating their movements so that the trolls could not advance.
But neither did the dwarves gain any ground, and Dagna knew in his heart
that his two companions, Fender and Bonnerbas, were surely dead.
The tough old dwarf pushed the grim thoughts from his mind, and didn't
even begin to let them lead him back down the road of grief for his lost boy.
He focused on his anger and on the desperate need, and he forged ahead,
warhammer and torch flailing. Behind him, he felt the heat increasing as his
boys began to strengthen the fire. They'd need it blazing indeed if they meant
to get the last of the group clear of the tunnels and up into the open air.
"Down in front!" came a call aimed at Dagna and his line.
As one the five dwarves sprang ahead and attacked ferociously, forcing the
trolls to retreat a step. Then again as one they leaped back and dropped to
the ground.
Flaming brush and logs flew over their heads, bouncing into the trolls and
sending them into a frenzied scramble to get out of the way.
Dagna's heart fell as he watched the effective barrage, though, for beyond
that line of confusion lay two of his kin, down and dead, he was sure. He and
the other four fell back, then, moving right to the base of the hole, just behind
Galen, who continued to ferry dwarves up.
The tunnel grew smokier and smokier with every passing second as more

brush and logs came down the chute. A dwarven brigade carried the timber to
the fire. The brush—branches of pine, mostly—flared up fast and furious to be
rushed across to drive back whatever trolls were closest, while the logs were
dropped onto the pile, replacing already flaring logs that were scooped up and
hurled into the enemy ranks. Gradually, the dwarves were building walls of
fire, sealing off every approach.
Their ranks thinned as more scrambled up to the surface, as Galen tire-
lessly lifted them into the arms of their waiting kin. Then the scramble became
more frantic as the dwarves' numbers dwindled to only a few.
The dwarf beside Dagna urged him to go, but the crusty old graybeard
slapped that notion aside by slapping the other dwarf aside—shoving him into
Galen Firth's waiting arms. Up and out he went, and one by one, Dagna's line
diminished.
Up came a huge flaming brand—Galen passing it to Dagna—and the old
dwarf took the heavy log, handing back his hammer in exchange. He
presented the log horizontally out before him and charged with a roar,
barreling right into the trolls, the flames biting his hands but biting the trolls
worse. The creatures fell all over each other trying to get back from the wild
dwarf. With a great heave, Dagna sent the flaming log into them. Then he
turned and fled back to where Galen was waiting. The human crouched, with
his hands set in a clasp before him. Dagna hopped onto those waiting hands,
and Galen turned, guiding him directly under the hole, then heaved him up.
Even as Dagna cleared the hole, and Galen instinctively turned to meet the
troll charge he knew must be coming, dwarf hands reached into the opening
and clasped tightly onto Galen's forearms.
The man went into the air, to shouts of, "Pull him out!"
His head and shoulders came out into the open air, and for a moment,
Galen thought he was clear.
Until he felt clawed hands grab him by the legs.
"Pull, ye dolts!" General Dagna demanded, and he rushed over and
grabbed Galen by the collar, digging in his heels and tugging hard.
The man cried out in pain. He lifted a bit out of the hole, then went back in
some, serving as the line in a game of tug-of-war.
"Get me a torch!" Dagna cried, and when he saw a dwarf rushing over with
a flaming brand he let go of Galen, who, for a moment, nearly disappeared
into the hole.
"Grab me feet!" Dagna ordered as he went around Galen.
The moment a pair of dwarves had him securely about the ankles, the
general dived face first into the hole behind the struggling Galen, his torch
leading—and drawing a yelp from Galen as it brushed down behind him.
Galen frantically shouted some more as the torch burned him about the
legs, but then he was free. The dwarves yanked both Galen and Dagna from
the hole. Dagna held his ground as a troll stood up, reaching for the opening.
The old dwarf whacked away with the torch, holding the creature at bay until
his boys could get more substantial fire to the hole and dump it down.
Heavier logs were ferried into position and similarly forced down, blocking
the opening, and Dagna and the others fell back to catch their collective
breath.
A shout had them up and moving again, though, for the trolls had not been
stopped by the clogged and fiery exit. Clawed hands rent the ground as the

trolls began to dig escape tunnels of their own.
"Gather 'em up and get on the move!" Dagna roared, and the dwarves set
off at a great pace across the open ground.
Many had to be helped, two carried even, but a count showed that they had
lost only two: Fender and Bonnerbas. Still, not a one of them wanted to call
that encounter a victory.

BONES AND STONES
Decay and rot had won the day, creeping around the stones and boulders
of the bloody mountainside. Bloated corpses steamed in the cool morning air,
their last wisps of heat flowing away to insubstantiality, life energy lost on the
endless mitigating mourn of the uncaring wind.
Drizzt Do'Urden walked among the lower reaches of the killing field, a cloth
tied across his black-skinned face to ward the stench. Almost all of the bodies
on the lower ground were orcs, many killed in the monumental blast that had
upended the mountain ridge to the side of the main area of battle. That
explosion had turned night into day, had sent flames leaping a thousand feet
into the air, and had launched tons and tons of debris across the swarm of
monsters, mowing them flat under its press.
"One less weapon I will have to replace," said Innovindil.
Drizzt turned to regard his surface elf companion. The fair elf had her face
covered too, though that did little to diminish her beauty. Above her scarf,
bright blue eyes peered out at Drizzt and the same wind that carried the
stench of death blew her long golden tresses out wildly behind her. Lithe and
graceful, Innovindil's every step seemed like a dance to Drizzt Do'Urden, and
even the burden of mourning, for she had lost her partner and lover, Tarathiel,
could not hold her feet glumly to the stone.
Drizzt watched as she reached down to a familiar corpse, that of Urlgen,
son of Obould Many-Arrows, the orc beast who had started the awful war.
Innovindil had killed Urlgen, or rather, he had inadvertently killed himself by
slamming his head at hers and impaling it upon a dagger the elf had snapped
up before her. Innovindil put a foot on the bloated face of the dead orc leader,
grasped the dagger hilt firmly in hand, and yanked it free. With hardly a flinch,
she bent further and wiped the blade on the dead orc's shirt, then flipped it
over in her hand and replaced it in the sheath belted around her ankle.
"They have not bothered to loot the field, from dead dwarves or from their
own," Innovindil remarked.
That much had been obvious to Drizzt and Innovindil before their pegasus,
Sunset, had even set them down on the rocky mountain slope. The place was
deserted, fully so, even though the orcs were not far away. The couple could
hear them in the valley beyond the slope's crest, the region called Keeper's
Dale, which marked the western entrance to Mithral Hall. The dwarves had
not won there, Drizzt knew, despite the fact that orc bodies outnumbered
those of his bearded friends many times over. In the end, the orcs had pushed
them from the cliff and into Keeper's Dale, and back into their hole in Mithral
Hall. The orcs had paid dearly for that piece of ground, but it was theirs. Given
the sheer size of the orc force assembled outside the closed door of Clan
Battlehammer's stronghold, Drizzt simply couldn't see how the dwarves might
ever win the ground back.
"They have not looted only because the battle is not yet over," Drizzt
replied. "There has been no pause until now for the orcs, first in pushing the
dwarves back into Mithral Hall, then in preparing the area around the western
gates to their liking. They will return here soon enough, I expect."
He glanced over at Innovindil to see her distracted and standing before the
remains of a particularly nasty fight, staring down at a clump of bodies. Drizzt

understood her surprise before he even went over and confirmed that she
was standing where he had watched the battleragers, the famed Gutbuster
Brigade, make a valiant stand. He walked up beside the elf, wincing at the
gruesome sight of shredded bodies—never had there been anything subtle
about Thibbledorf Pwent's boys—and wincing even more when he caught
sight of more than a dozen dead dwarves, all tightly packed together. They
had died, one and all, protecting each other, a fitting end indeed for the brave
warriors.
"Their armor .. ." Innovindil began, shaking her head, her expression
caught somewhere between surprise, awe, and disgust.
She didn't have to say anything more for Drizzt to perfectly understand, for
the armor of the Gutbusters often elicited such confusion. Ridged and
overlapping with sharpened plates, and sprouting an abundance of deadly
spikes, Gutbuster armor made a dwarf's body into a devastating weapon.
Where other dwarves charged with pickaxes, battle-axes, warhammers, and
swords held high, Gutbusters just charged.
Drizzt thought to inspect the area a bit more closely, to see if his old friend
Thibbledorf might be among the dead, but he decided against that course.
Better for him, he thought, to just continue on his way. Counting the dead was
an exercise for after the war.
Of course, that same attitude allowed Drizzt to justify his inability to return
to Clan Battlehammer and truly face the realization that his friends were all
gone, killed at the town of Shallows.
"Let us get to the ridge," he said. "We should learn the source of that
explosion before Obould's minions return here to pick the bodies clean."
Innovindil readily agreed and started toward the blasted line of stone.
Had she and Drizzt moved only twenty more paces up toward the lip of
Keeper's Dale, they would have found another telltale formation of bodies:
orcs, some lying three in a row, dead and showing only a single burned hole
for injuries.
Drizzt Do'Urden knew of a weapon, a bow named Taulmaril, that inflicted
such wounds, a bow held by his friend Catti-brie, whom he thought dead at
Shallows.

The dwarf Nikwillig sat on the east-facing side of a mountain, slumped
against the stone and fighting against such desperation and despair that he
feared he would be frozen him in place until starvation or some wayward orc
took him. He took comfort in knowing that he had done his duty well, and that
his expedition to the peaks east of the battlefield had helped to turn the tide of
the raging conflict—at least enough so that Banak Brawnanvil had managed
to get the great majority of dwarves down the cliff face and safely into Mithral
Hall ahead of the advancing orc horde.
That moment of triumph played over and over in the weary dwarf's mind, a
litany against the pressing fears of his current predicament. He had climbed
the slopes higher than the combatants while the field of battle remained blan-
keted in pre-dawn darkness, had turned his attention, and the mirror he car-
ried, to the rising sun. He had angled a reflected ray from that mirror back
against the slope of the ridge across the way, until he had located the second
mirror placed there, brilliantly illuminating the target for Catti-brie and her
enchanted bow.

Then Nikwillig had watched darkness turn to sudden light, a flare of fire that
had risen a thousand feet over the battlefield. Like a ripple in a pond or a burst
of wind bending a field of grass, the waves of hot wind and debris had rolled
out from that monumental explosion, sweeping the northern reaches of the
battlefield where the majority of orcs were beginning their charge. They had
gone down in rows, many never to rise again. Their charge had been all but
stopped, exactly as the dwarves had hoped.
So Nikwillig had done his job, but even when he'd left, hoping for exactly
that outcome, the Felbarran dwarf had known his chances of returning were
not good. Banak and the others certainly couldn't wait for him to scramble
back down—even if they had wanted to, how would Nikwillig have ever gotten
through the swarm of orcs between him and the dwarves?
Nikwillig had left the dwarven ranks on a suicide mission that day, and he
held no regrets, but that didn't dismiss the very real fears that huddled around
him as the time of his death seemed near at hand.
He thought of Tred, then, his comrade from Felbarr. They, along with
several companions, had started out on a bright day from the Citadel of King
Emerus Warcrown not so long ago in a typical merchant caravan. While their
route was somewhat different than the norm, as they tried to secure a new
trading line for both King Emerus and their own pockets, they hadn't expected
any real trouble. Certainly, they never expected to walk into the front scouts of
the greatest orc assault the region had seen in memory! Nikwillig wondered
what might have happened to Tred. Had he fallen in the vicious fight? Or had
he gotten down into Keeper's Dale and into Mithral Hall?
The forlorn dwarf gave a helpless little laugh as he considered that Tred
had previously decided to walk out of Mithral Hall and return home with the
news to Citadel Felbarr. Toughened, war-hardened, and battle-eager Tred
had thought to serve as emissary between the two fortresses and in the
ultimate irony, Nikwillig had dissuaded him.
"Ah, ye're such the fool, Nikwillig," the dwarf said into the mournful wind.
He didn't really believe the words even as he spoke them. He had stayed,
Tred had stayed, because they had decided they were indebted to King
Bruenor and his kin, because they had decided that the war was about the
solidarity of the Delzoun dwarves, about standing together, shoulder-to-
shoulder, in common cause.
No, he hadn't been a fool for staying, and hadn't been a fool for volunteer-
ing, insisting even, that he be the one to go out with the mirror and grab those
first rays of dawn. He wasn't a warrior, after all. He had walked willingly and
rightly into this predicament, but he knew that the road ahead was likely to
come to a fast and vicious ending.
The dwarf pulled himself to his feet. He glanced back over his shoulder
toward Keeper's Dale, and again dismissed any thoughts of going that way.
Certainly that was the closest entrance to Mithral Hall and safety, but to get to
it meant crossing a massive orc encampment. Even if he somehow managed
that feat, the dwarves were in their hole and those doors were closed, and
weren't likely to open anytime soon.
So east it was, Nikwillig decided. To the River Surbrin and hopefully,
against all odds, beyond.
He thought he heard a sound nearby and imagined that an orc patrol was
likely watching him even then, ready to spring upon him and batter him to

death. He took a deep breath. He put one foot in front of the other.
He started his dark journey.

Drizzt and Innovindil veered to the south as they headed for the blasted
ridge, angling their march so that they came in sight of Keeper's Dale right
near to the spot where the line of metal tubes had been placed by the
dwarves. That line ran up from the ground to the entrance of the tunnels that
wound beneath what was once a ridgeline. Of course neither of them
understood what that pipeline was all about. Neither had any idea that the
dwarves, at the instructions of Nanfoodle the gnome, had brought natural
gasses up from their underground entrapment, filling the tunnels beneath the
unwitting giants and their catapults.
Perhaps if the pair had been granted more time to ponder the pipeline, to
climb down the cliff and inspect it more closely, Drizzt and Innovindil would
have begun to decipher the mystery of the gigantic fireball. At that moment,
however, the fireball seemed the least of their issues. For below them
swarmed the largest army of orcs either had ever seen, a virtual sea of dark
forms milling around the obelisks that marked Keeper's Dale. Thousands, tens
of thousands, moved down there, their indistinct mass occasionally marked by
the larger form of a hulking frost giant.
As he scanned across the throng, Drizzt Do'Urden picked out more and
more of those larger monsters, and he sucked in his breath as he came to
realize the scope of the army. Hundreds of giants were down there, as if the
entire population of behemoths from all the Spine of the World had emptied
out to the call of King Obould.
"Have the Silver Marches known a darker day?" Innovindil asked.
Drizzt turned to regard her, though he wasn't sure if she was actually
asking him or simply making a remark.
Innovindil swung her head to meet his lavender-eyed gaze. "I remember
when Obould managed to rout the dwarves from Citadel Felbarr," she
explained. "And what a dark day that was! But still, the orc king seemed to
have traded one hole for another. While his conquest had played terribly on
King Emerus Warcrown and the other Felbarran dwarves, never was it viewed
as any threat to the wider region. The orc king had seized upon an
unexpected opportunity, and so he had prevailed in a victory that we all
expected would be short-lived, as it was. But now this...." Her voice trailed off
and she shook her head helplessly as she looked back to the dale and the
massive orc army.
"We can guess that most of the dwarves of Clan Battlehammer managed to
get back into their tunnels," Drizzt reasoned. "They'll not be easily routed, I
assure you. In their chambers, Clan Battlehammer once repulsed an attack by
Menzoberranzan. I doubt there are enough orcs in all the world to take the
hall."
"You may be right, but does that even matter?"
Drizzt looked at the elf curiously. He started to ask how it might not matter,
but as he came to fully understand Innovindil's fears, he held the question in
check.
"No," he agreed, "this force Obould has assembled will not be easily
pushed back into their mountain holes. It will take Silverymoon and Everlund,
and perhaps even Sundabar... Citadels Felbarr and Adbar, and Mithral Hall. It

will take the Moonwood elves and the army of Marchion Elastul of Mirabar. All
the north must rally to the call of Mithral Hall in this, their hour of need."
"And even in that case, the cost will prove enormous," Innovindil replied.
"Horrific." She glanced back to the bloody, carcass-ridden battlefield. "This
fight here on the ridge will seem a minor skirmish and fat will the crows of the
Silver Marches be."
Drizzt continued his scan as she spoke, and he noted movement down to
the west, quickly discerning it as a force of orcs circling up and out of Keeper's
Dale.
"The orc scavengers will soon arrive," he said. "Let us be on our way."
Innovindil stared down at Keeper's Dale a bit longer.
"No sign of Sunrise," she remarked, referring to the pegasus companion of
Sunset, and once the mount of Tarathiel, her companion.
"Obould still has him, and alive, I am sure," Drizzt replied. "Even an orc
would not destroy so magnificent a creature."
Innovindil continued to stare and managed a little hunch of her shoulders,
then turned to face Drizzt directly again. "Let us hope."
Drizzt rose, took her hand, and together they walked down toward the
north, along the ridge of blasted and broken stones. The explosion had lifted
the roof of the ridge away, leaving a scarred ravine behind. Every now and
again, the couple came upon the remains of a charred giant. In one place,
they found a burned out catapult, somehow still retaining its shape despite the
tremendous blast.
Their discoveries prompted more questions than they answered, however,
leaving the pair no clue whatsoever as to what might have caused such a
cataclysm.
"When we at last find our way into Mithral Hall, you can ask the dwarves
about it," Innovindil said when they were far from the field, on an open plateau
awaiting the return of the winged Sunset.
Drizzt didn't respond to the elf's direct implication that he would indeed
soon return to the dwarven stronghold—where he would have no choice but
to face his fears—other than to offer a quiet nod.
"Some trick of the gods, perhaps," the elf went on.
"Or the Harpells," Drizzt added, referring to a family of eccentric and
powerful wizards—too powerful for their own good, or for the good of those
around them, in most cases!— from the small community of Longsaddle many
miles to the west. The Harpells had come to the aid of Mithral Hall before, and
had a long-standing friendship with Bruenor and his kin. Drizzt knew enough
about them to realize that if anyone might have inadvertently caused such a
catastrophe as befell the ridge, it would be that strange clan of confused
humans.
"Harpells?"
"You do not want to know," Drizzt said in all seriousness. "Suffice it to say
that Bruenor Battlehammer has made some unconventional friends."
As soon as he had spoken the words, Drizzt recognized the irony of them,
and he managed a smile to match Innovindil's own widening grin as he
glanced at her.
"We will know soon enough on all counts," she said. "For now, we have
duties of our own to attend."
"For Sunrise," Drizzt agreed and he shook Innovindil's offered hand. "And

for vengeance. Tarathiel will rest easier when Obould Many-Arrows is dead."
"Dead at the tip of a sword?" Innovindil asked, putting a hand to the hilt of
her own weapon. "Or at the curve of a scimitar?"
"A scimitar, I think," Drizzt answered without the slightest hesitation, and he
looked back to the south. "I do intend to kill that one."
"For Tarathiel, and for Bruenor, then," said Innovindil. "For those who have
died and for the good of the North."
"Or simply because I want to kill him," said Drizzt in a tone so cold and
even that it sent a shiver along Innovindil's spine.
She could not find the voice to answer.

PASSION
With a growl that seemed more anger than passion, Tsinka Shinriil rolled
Obould over and scrambled atop him.
"You have put them in their dark hole!" the female shaman cried, her eyes
wide—so wide that the yellow-white of her eyes showed clearly all around her
dark pupils, giving her an expression that seemed more a caricature of
insanity than anything else. "Now we dig into that hole!"
King Obould Many-Arrows easily held the excited shaman at bay as she
tried to engulf him with her trembling body, his thick, muscular arms lifting her
from the straw bed.
"Mithral Hall will fall to the might of Obould-who-is-Gruumsh," Tsinka went
on. "And Citadel Felbarr will be yours once more, soon after. We will have
them all! We will slay the minions of Bruenor and Emerus! We will bathe in
their blood!"
Obould gave a slight shrug and moved the shaman off to the side, off the
cot itself. She hit the floor nimbly, and came right back, drool showing at the
edges of her tusky mouth.
"Is there anything Obould-who-is-Gruumsh cannot conquer?" she asked,
squirming atop him again. "Mithral Hall, Felbarr . . . Adbar! Yes, Adbar! They
will all fall before us. Every dwarven stronghold in the North! We will send
them fleeing, those few who we do not devour. We will rid the North of the
dwarven curse."
Obould managed a smile, but it was more to mock the priestess than to
agree with her. He'd heard her litany before—over and over again, actually.
Ever since the western door of Mithral Hall had banged closed, sealing Clan
Battlehammer into their hole, Tsinka and the other shamans had been
spouting preposterous hopes for massive conquests all throughout the Silver
Marches and beyond.
And Obould shared that hope. He wanted nothing more than to reclaim the
Citadel of Many Arrows, which the dwarves had named Citadel Felbarr once
more. But Obould saw the folly in that course. The entire region had been
alerted to them. Crossing the Surbrin would mean engaging the armies of
Silverymoon and Everlund, certainly, along with the elves of the Moonwood
and the combined forces of the Delzoun dwarves east of the deep, cold river.
"You are Gruumsh!" Tsinka said. She grabbed Obould's face and kissed
him roughly. "You are a god among orcs!" She kissed him again. "Gerti
Orelsdottr fears you!" Tsinka shrieked and kissed him yet again.
Obould grinned, rekindling the memory of his last encounter with the frost
giant princess. Gerti did indeed fear him, or she certainly should, for Obould
had bested her in their short battle, had tossed her to the ground and sent her
slinking away. It was a feat previously unheard of, and only served to illustrate
to all who had seen it, and to all who heard about it, that King Obould was
much more than a mere orc. He was in the favor of Gruumsh One-Eye, the
god of orcs. He had been blessed with strength and speed, with uncanny
agility, and he believed, with more insight than ever before.
Or perhaps that new insight wasn't new at all. Perhaps Obould, in his
current position, unexpectedly gaining all the ground between the Spine of the
World, the Fell Pass, the River Surbrin, and the Trollmoors with such ease

and overwhelming power, was simply viewing the world from a different, and
much superior, position.
".. . into Mithral Hall..." Tsinka was saying when Obould turned his attention
back to the babbling shaman. Apparently noting his sudden attention, she
paused and rewound the thought. "We must go into Mithral Hall before the
winter. We must rout Clan Battlehammer so the word of their defeat and
humiliation will spread before the snows block the passes. We will work the
dwarven forges throughout the winter to strengthen our armor and weapons.
We will emerge in the spring an unstoppable force, rolling across the
northland and laying waste to all who foolishly stand before us!"
"We lost many orcs driving the dwarves underground," Obould said, trying
to steal some of her momentum. "The stones are colored with orc blood."
"Blood well spilled!" Tsinka shrieked. "And more will die! More must die!
Our first great victory is at hand!"
"Our first great victory is achieved," Obould corrected.
"Then our second is before us!" Tsinka shouted right back at him. "And the
victory worthy of He-who-is-Gruumsh. We have taken stones and empty
ground. The prize is yet to be had."
Obould pushed her back out to arms' length and turned his head a bit to
better regard her. She was shaking again, though be it from passion or anger,
he could not tell. Her naked body shone in the torchlight with layers of sweat.
Her muscles stood on edge, corded and trembling, like a spring too tightly
twisted.
"Mithral Hall must fall before the winter," Tsinka said, more calmly than
before. "Gruumsh has shown this to me. It was Bruenor Battlehammer who
stood upon that stone, breaking the tide of orcs and denying us a greater
victory."
Obould growled at the name.
"Word has spread throughout the land that he lives. The King of Mithral Hall
has risen from the dead, it would seem. That is Moradin's challenge to
Gruumsh, do you not see? You are Gruumsh's champion, of that there is no
doubt, and King Bruenor Battlehammer champions Moradin. Settle this and
settle it quickly, you must, before the dwarves rally to Moradin's call as the
orcs have rallied to Obould!"
The words hit Obould hard, for they made more sense than he wanted to
admit. He wasn't keen on going into Mithral Hall. He knew that his army would
suffer difficult obstacles every inch of the way. Could he sustain such horrific
losses and still hope to secure the land he meant to be his kingdom?
But indeed, word had spread through the deep orc ranks like a windswept
fire across dry grass. There was no denying the identity of the dwarf who had
centered the defensive line in the retreat to the hall. It was Bruenor, thought
dead at Shallows. It was Bruenor, returned from the grave.
Obould was not so stupid as to underestimate the importance of that
development. He understood how greatly his presence spurred on his own
warriors—could Bruenor be any less inspiring to the dwarves? Obould hated
dwarves above all other races, even elves, but his bitter experiences at
Citadel Felbarr had given him a grudging respect for the stout bearded folk.
He had taken Felbarr at an opportune moment, and with a great deal of the
element of surprise on his side, but now, if Tsinka had her way, he would be
taking his forces into a defended and prepared dwarven fortress.

Was any race in all of Toril better at defending their homes than the
dwarves?
The drow, perhaps, he thought, and the notion sent his contemplations
flowing to events in the south, where two dark elves were supposedly helping
ugly Proffit and his trolls press Mithral Hall from the south. Obould realized
that that would be the key to victory if he decided to crash into Mithral Hall. If
Proffit and his smelly beasts could siphon off a fair number of Bruenor's
warriors, and any amount of Bruenor's attention, a bold strike straight though
Mithral Hall's closed western door might gain Obould a foothold within.
The orc king looked back at Tsinka and realized that he was wearing his
thoughts on his face, so to speak. For she was grinning in her toothy way, her
dark eyes roiling with eagerness—for conquest, and for Obould. The great orc
king lowered his arms, bringing Tsinka down atop him, and let his plans slip
from his thoughts. He held onto the image of dead dwarves and crumbling
dwarven doors, though, for Obould found those sights perfectly intoxicating.
*

The cold wind made every jolt hurt just a little bit more, but Obould gritted
his teeth and clamped his legs more tightly against the bucking pegasus. The
white equine creature had its wings strapped tightly back. Obould wasn't
about to let it get him up off the ground, for the pegasus was not broken at all
as far as the orcs were concerned. Obould had seen the elf riding the
creature, so easily, but every orc who'd climbed atop the pegasus had been
thrown far away, and more than one had subsequently been trampled by the
beast before the handlers could get the creature under control.
Every orc thus far had been thrown, except for Obould, whose legs
clamped so powerfully at the pegasus's sides that the creature had not yet
dislodged him.
Up came the horse's rump, and Obould's body rolled back, his neck pain-
fully whipping and his head turning so far over that he actually saw, upside
down, the pegasus's rear hooves snap up in the air at the end of the buck! His
hand grabbed tighter at the thick rope and he growled and clamped his legs
against the mount's flanks, so tightly that he figured he would crush the
creature's ribs.
But the pegasus kept on bucking; leaping, twisting, and kicking wildly.
Obould found a rhythm in the frenzy, though, and gradually began to snap
and jerk just a little less fiercely.
The pegasus began to slow in its gyrations and the orc king grinned at his
realization that the beast was finally tiring. He took that moment to relax, just a
bit, and smiled even more widely as he compared the pegasus's wild
gyrations to those of Tsinka the night before. A fitting comparison, he lewdly
thought.
Then he was flying, free of the pegasus's back, as the creature went into a
sudden and violent frenzy. Obould hit the ground hard, face down and twisted,
but he grunted it away and forced himself into a roll that allowed him to quickly
regain some of his dignity, if not his feet. He looked around in alarm for just a
moment, thinking that his grand exit might have lessened his image in the
eyes of those nearby orcs. Indeed, they all stared at him incredulously—or
stupidly, he could not tell the difference—and with such surprise that the
handlers didn't even move for the pegasus.
And the equine beast came for the fallen orc king.

Obould put a wide grin on his face and leaped to his feet, arms wide, and
gave a great roar, inviting the pegasus to battle.
The steed stopped short, and snorted and pawed the ground.
Obould began to laugh, shattering the tension, and he stalked right at the
pegasus as if daring it to strike at him. The pegasus put its ears back and
tensed up.
"Perhaps I should eat you," Obould said calmly, walking right up to the
beast and staring it directly in the eye, which of course only set the pegasus
even more on edge. "Yes, your flesh will taste tender, I am sure."
The orc king stared down the pegasus for a few moments longer, then
swung around and gave a great laugh, and all the orcs nearby took up the
cheer.
As soon as he was confident that he had restored any lost dignity, Obould
turned back to the pegasus and thought again of Tsinka. He laughed all the
louder as he mentally superimposed the equine face over that of the fierce
and eager shaman, but while the snout and larger features greatly changed, it
seemed to him that, other than the white about the edges of Tsinka's iris, their
eyes were very much the same. Same intensity, same tension. Same wild and
uncontrollable emotions.
No, not the same, Obould came to recognize, for while Tsinka's gyrations
and sparkling eyes were wrought of passion and ecstasy, the winged horse's
frenzy came from fear.
No, not fear—the notion hit Obould suddenly—not fear. It was no wild
animal, just captured and in need of breaking. The mount had been ridden for
years, and by elves, riders whose legs were too spindly to begin to hold if the
pegasus didn't want them to stay on.
The pegasus's intensity came not from fear, but from sheer hatred.
"O, smart beast," Obould said softly, and the pegasus's ears came up and
flattened again, as if it understood every word. "You hold loyalty to your
master and hatred for me, who killed him. You will fight me forever if I try to
climb onto your back, will you not?"
The orc king nodded and narrowed his eyes to closely scrutinize the
pegasus.
"Or will you?" he asked, and his mind went in a different direction, as if he
was seeing things from the pegasus's point of view.
The creature had purposefully lulled him into complacency up there on its
back. It had seemingly calmed, and just when Obould had relaxed, it had
gone wild again.
"You are not as clever as you believe," Obould said to the pegasus. "You
should have waited until you had me up into the clouds before throwing me
from your back. You should have made me believe that I was your master."
The orc snorted, and wondered what pegasus flesh would taste like.
The handlers got the winged horse into complete control soon after, and
the leader of the group turned to Obould and asked, "Will you be riding again
this day, my god?"
Obould snickered at the ridiculous title, though he wouldn't openly dis-
courage its use, and shook his head. "Much I have to do," he said.
He noted one of the orcs roughly tying the pegasus's back legs together.
"Enough!" he ordered, and the orc gang froze in place. "Treat the beast
gently now, with due respect."

That brought a few incredulous expressions.
"Find new handlers!" Obould barked at the gang leader. "A soft touch for
the mount now. No beatings!"
Even as he spoke the words, Obould saw the error of distracting the crew,
for the pegasus lurched suddenly, shrugging a pair of orcs aside, then kicked
out hard, scoring a solid hit on the forehead of the unfortunate orc who had
been tying its hind legs. That orc flew away and began squirming on the
ground and wailing piteously.
The other orcs instinctively moved to punish the beast, but Obould over-
ruled that with a great shout of, "Enough!"
He stared directly at the pegasus, then again at the orc leader. "Any mark I
find on this beast will be replicated on your own hide," he promised.
When the gang leader shrank down, visibly trembling, Obould knew his
work was done. With a sidelong look of contempt at the badly injured fool still
squirming on the ground, Obould walked away.

The surprise on the face of the frost giant sentries—fifteen feet tall,
handsome, shapely behemoths—was no less than Obould had left behind
with his orc companions when he'd informed them, to the shrill protests of
Tsinka Shinriil among others, that he would visit Gerti Orelsdottr alone. There
was no doubt about the bad blood between Gerti and Obould. In their last
encounter, Obould had knocked the giantess to the ground, embarrassing and
outraging her.
Obould kept his head high and his eyes straight ahead—and he wasn't
even wearing the marvelously protective helmet that the shamans had
somehow fashioned for him. Giants loomed all around him, many carrying
swords that were taller than the orc king. As he neared the entrance to the
huge cave Gerti had taken as temporary residence far south of her mountain
home, the giant guards shifted to form a gauntlet before him. Two lines of
sneering, imposing brutes glared down at him from every angle. As he passed
them, the giants behind him turned in and followed, closing any possible
escape route.
Obould let his greatsword rest easily on his back, kept his chin high, and
even managed a grin to convey his confidence. He knew that he was
surrendering the high ground, physically, but he knew, too, that he had to do
just that to gain the high ground emotionally.
He noted a flurry of commotion just inside the cave, with huge shapes
moving this way and that. And when he entered, his eyes adjusting to the
sudden change of light as daylight diminished to the glow of just a few
torches, he found that he didn't have to search far to gain his intended
audience. Gerti Orelsdottr, beautiful and terrible by frost giant standards,
stood at the back, eyeing him with something that seemed a cross of
suspicion and contempt.
"It would seem that you have forgotten your entourage, King Obould," she
said, and it seemed to Obould that she had weighted her voice with a hint of a
threat.
He remained confident that she wouldn't act against him, though. He had
defeated her in single combat, had, in effect, shamed her, and greater would
her shame be among her people if she set others upon him in retribution.
Obould didn't completely understand the frost giants, of course—his

experiences with them were fairly limited—but he knew them to be legitimate
warriors, and warriors almost always shared certain codes of honor.
Gerti's words had many of the giants in the room chuckling and whispering.
"I speak for all the thousands," the orc king replied. "As Dame Orelsdottr
speaks for the frost giants of the Spine of the World."
Gerti straightened and narrowed her huge blue eyes—orbs that seemed all
the richer in hue because of the bluish tint to the giantess's skin. "Then speak,
King Obould. I have many preparations before me and little time to waste."
Obould let his posture relax, wanting to seem perfectly at ease. From the
murmurs around him, he took satisfaction that he had hit just the right physical
timbre. "We have achieved a great victory here, Dame Orelsdottr. We have
taken the northland in as great a sweep as has ever been known."
"Our enemies have barely begun to rise against us," Gerti pointed out.
Obould conceded the point with a nod. "Do not deny our progress, I pray
you," he said. "We have closed both doors of Mithral Hall. Nesme is likely
destroyed and the Surbrin secured. This is not the time for us to allow our
alliance to ..." He paused and slowly swiveled his head so that he spent a
moment looking every giant in the room directly in the eye.
"Dame Orelsdottr, I speak for the orcs. Tens of thousands of orcs." He put
added weight into that last, impressive, estimate. "You speak for the giants.
Let us go to parlay in private."
Gerti assumed a pose that Obould had seen many times before, one both
obstinate and pensive. She put one hand on her hip and turned, just enough
to let her shapely legs escape the slit in her white dress, and she let her lips
form into a pucker that might have been a pout and might have been that last
moment of teasing before she reached out and throttled an enemy.
Obould answered that with a bow of respect.
"Come along," Gerti bade him, and when the giant nearest her started to
protest, she silenced him with one of the fiercest scowls Obould had ever
seen.
Yes, it was going splendidly, the orc king thought.
At Gerti's bidding, Obould followed her down a short corridor. The orc took
a moment to study the walls that had been widened by the giants, obviously,
with new cuts in the stone clearly showing. The ceiling, too, was much more
than a natural formation, with all the low points chipped out so that the tallest
of Gerti's minions could walk the length of the corridor without stooping.
Impressive work, Obould thought, especially given the efficiency and speed
with which it had been accomplished. He hadn't realized that the giants were
so good at shaping the stone quickly, a revelation that he figured might be
useful if he did indeed crash the gates into Mithral Hall.
The chamber at the end of the hall was obviously Gerti's own, for it was
blocked by a heavy wooden door and appointed with many thick and lush
bearskins. Gerti pointedly kicked several aside, leaving a spot of bare stone
floor, and indicated that to be Obould's seat.
The orc king didn't question or complain, and was smiling still when he
melted down to sit cross-legged, drawing out his greatsword as he
descended. Its impressive length would not allow him to sit in that position
with it still on his back. He lay the blade across his crossed legs, in easy
reach, but he relaxed back and kept his hands far from it, offering not the
slightest bit of a threat.

Gerti watched his every move closely, he recognized, though she was
trying to feign indifference as she moved to close the door. She strode across
the room to the thickest pile of furs and demurely sat herself down, which still
had her towering over the lower-seated and much smaller orc king.
"What do you want of me, Obould?" Gerti bluntly asked, her tone short and
crisp, her eyes unblinking.
"We were angered, both of us, at the return of King Bruenor and the loss of
a great opportunity," Obould replied.
"At the loss of frost giants."
"And orcs for me—more than a thousand of my kin, my own son among
them."
"Are not worth a single of my kin to me," Gerti replied.
Obould accepted the insult quietly, reminding himself to think long-term and
not jump up and slaughter the witch.
"The dwarves value their kin no less than do we, Dame Orelsdottr," he
said. "They claim no victory here."
"Many escaped."
"To a hole that has become a prison. To tunnels that perhaps already reek
with the stench of troll."
"If Donnia Soldou and Ad'non Kareese were not dead, perhaps we could
better sort out information concerning Proffit and his wretches," said Gerti,
referring to two of the four drow elves who had been serving as advisors and
scouts to her and to Obould, both of whom had been found dead north of their
current position.
"Do you lament their deaths?"
The question gave Gerti pause, and she even betrayed her surprise with a
temporary lift of her evenly trimmed eyebrows.
"They were using us for their own enjoyment and nothing more, you know
that of course," Obould remarked.
Again, Gerti cocked her eyebrow, but held it there longer.
"Surprised?" the orc king added.
"They are drow," Gerti said. "They serve only themselves and their own
desires. Of course I knew. Only a fool would have ever suspected differently."
But you are surprised that I knew, Obould thought, but did not say.
"And if the other two die with Proffit in the south, then so much the better,"
said Gerti.
"After we are done with them," said Obould. "The remaining drow will prove
important if we intend to break through the defenses of Mithral Hall."
"Break through the defenses?"
Obould could hardly miss the incredulity in her voice, or the obvious doubt.
"I would take the hall."
"Your orcs will be slaughtered by the thousands."
"Whatever price we must pay will be worth the gain," Obould said, and he
had to work hard to keep the very real doubts out of his voice. "We must
continue to press our enemies before they can organize and coordinate their
attacks. We have them on their heels, and I do not mean to allow them firm
footing. And I will have Bruenor Battlehammer's head, at long last."
"You will crawl over the bodies of orcs to get to him, then, but not the
bodies of frost giants."
Obould accepted that with a nod, confident that if he managed to take the

upper tunnels of Mithral Hall, Gerti would fall into line.
"I need your kin only to break through the outer shell," he said.
"There are ways to dislodge the greatest of doors," an obviously and sud-
denly intrigued Gerti remarked.
"The sooner you crack the shell, the sooner I will have King Bruenor's
head."
Gerti chuckled and nodded her agreement. Obould realized, of course, that
she was likely more intrigued by the prospect of ten thousand dead orcs than
of any defeat to the dwarves.
Obould used the great strength in his legs to lift him up from his seated
position, to stand straight, as he swept his sword back over his shoulder and
into its sheath. He returned Gerti's nod and walked out, holding fast to his
cocky swagger as he passed through the waiting lines of giant guards.
Despite that calm and confident demeanor, though, Obould's insides
churned. Gerti would swing into swift action, of course, and Obould had little
doubt that she would deliver him and his army into the hall, but even as he
pondered the execution of his request, the thought of it gnawed at him. Once
again, Obould envisioned orc fortresses dotting every hilltop of the region,
with defensible walls forcing any attackers to scramble for every inch of
ground. How many dwarves and elves and humans would have to lie dead
among those hilltops before the wretched triumvirate gave up their thoughts of
dislodging him and accepted his conquest as final? How many dwarves and
elves and humans would Obould have to kill before his orcs were allowed
their kingdom and their share of the bounty of the wider world?
Many, he hoped, for he so enjoyed killing dwarves, elves, and humans.
As he exited the cave and was afforded a fairly wide view of the northern
expanses, Obould let his gaze meander over each stony mountain and wind-
blown slope. His mind's eye built those castles, all flying the pennants of the
One-Eyed God and of King Many-Arrows. In the shadows below them, in the
sheltered dells, he envisioned towns—towns like Shallows, sturdy and secure,
only inhabited by orcs and not smelly humans. He began to draw connections,
trade routes and responsibilities, riches and power, respect and influence.
It would work, Obould believed. He could carve out his kingdom and secure
it beyond any hopes the dwarves, elves, and humans might ever hold of
dislodging him.
The orc king glanced back at Gerti's cave, and considered for a fleeting
moment the possibility of going in and telling her. He even half-turned and
started to take a step that way.
He stopped, though, thinking that Gerti would not appreciate the weight of
his vision, nor care much for the end result. And even if she did, Obould
realized, how might Tsinka and the shamans react? Tsinka was calling for
conquest and not settlement, and she claimed to hold in her ears the voice of
Gruumsh himself.
Obould's upper lip curled in frustration, and he let his clenched fist rise up
beside him. He hadn't lied to Gerti. He wanted nothing more than to hold
Bruenor Battlehammer's heart in his hands.
But was it possible, and was the prize, as he had claimed, really worth the
no-doubt horrific cost?

4
A KING'S EYE VIEW
To all in the chamber, the torchlight did not seem so bright, its flickering
flames did not dance so joyously. Perhaps it was the realization that the doors
were closed and that the meager light was all that separated the whole of the
great dwarven complex of Mithral Hall from absolute darkness. The dwarves
and others could get out, of course. They had tunnels that led to the south
and the edge of the Trollmoors, though there had reportedly been some
fighting down there already. They had tunnels that would take them as far
west as Mirabar, and right under the River Surbrin to the east, to places like
Citadel Felbarr. None of those were easy routes, though, and all involved
breaking into that vast labyrinth known as the Underdark, the place of dark
denizens and untold horrors.
So Mithral Hall seemed a darker place, and the torches less inviting, and
less frequent. King Bruenor had already ordered conservation, preparing
himself for what surely seemed to be a long, long siege.
Bruenor sat on a throne of stone, thickly padded with rich green and purple
cloth. His great and wild beard seemed more orange than red under the arti-
ficial lighting, perhaps because those long hairs had become noticeably more
infested with strands of gray since the dwarf king's ordeal. For many days,
Bruenor had lain close to death. Even the greatest clerics of Mithral Hall had
only thought him alive through their nearly continual healing spells, cast upon
a body, they believed, whose host had forsaken it. Bruenor, the essence of
the dwarf, his very soul, had gone to his just reward in the Halls of Moradin,
by the reckoning of the priests. And there, so it was supposed, Regis the
halfling steward had found him, using the magic of his enchanted ruby
pendant. Regis had caught what little flicker of life remaining in Bruenor's eyes
and somehow used the magic to send his thoughts and his pleas for Bruenor
to return to the land of the living.
For no king would lie so still if he knew that his people were in such dire
need.
Thus had Bruenor returned, and the dwarves had found their way home,
albeit over the bodies of many fallen comrades.
Those gray hairs seemed to all who knew him well to be the only overt sign
of Bruenor's ordeal. His dark eyes still sparkled with energy and his square
shoulders promised to carry the whole of Mithral Hall upon them, if need be.
He was bandaged in a dozen places, for in the last retreat into the hall, he had
suffered terrible wounds—injuries that would have felled a lesser dwarf—but if
any of those wounds caused him the slightest discomfort, he did not show it.
He was dressed in his battle-worn armor, creased and torn and scratched,
and had his prized shield, emblazoned with the foaming mug standard of his
clan, resting against the side of his throne, his battle-axe leaning atop it and
showing the notches of its seasons, chips from stone, armor, and ogre skulls
alike.
"All who seen yer blast just shake their heads when they try to describe it,"
Bruenor said to Nanfoodle Buswilligan, the gnome alchemist from Mirabar.
Nanfoodle stepped nervously from foot to foot, and that only made the stout
dwarf lean closer to him.
"Come on now, little one," Bruenor coaxed. "We got no time for humility nor

nervousness. Ye done great, by all accounts, and all in the hall're bowing to
ye in respect. Ye stand tall among us, don't ye know?"
Nanfoodle did seem to straighten a bit at that, tilting his head back slightly
so that he looked up at the imposing dwarf upon the dais. Nanfoodle twitched
again as his long, crooked, pointy nose actually brushed Bruenor's similarly
imposing proboscis.
"What'd ye do?" Bruenor asked him again. "They're saying ye brought hot
air up from under Keeper's Dale."
"I... we ..." Nanfoodle corrected, and he turned to regard some of the
others, including Pikel Bouldershoulder, the most unusual dwarf who had
come from Carradoon on the shores of faraway Impresk Lake.
Nanfoodle nodded as Pikel smiled widely and punched his one fist up into
the air, mouthing a silent, "Oo oi!"
The gnome cleared his throat and turned back squarely upon Bruenor, who
settled back in his chair. "We used metal tubing to bring the hot air up from
below, yes," the gnome confirmed. "Torgar Hammerstriker and his boys
cleared the tunnels under the ridge of orcs and painted it tight with pitch. We
just directed the hot air into those tunnels, and when Catti-brie's arrow ignited
it all..."
"Boom!" shouted Pikel Bouldershoulder, and all eyes turned to him in
surprise.
"Hee hee hee," the green-bearded Pikel said with a shy shrug, and all the
grim folk in the room joined in on the much-needed laugh.
It proved a short respite, though, the weight of their situation quickly
pressing back upon them.
"Well, ye done good, gnome," Bruenor said. "Ye saved many o' me kin, and
that's from the mouth o' Banak Brawnanvil himself. And he's not one to throw
praise undeserved."
"We—Shoudra and I—felt the need to prove ourselves, King Bruenor," said
Nanfoodle. "And we wanted to help, any way we could. Your people have
shown such generosity to Torgar and Shingles, and all the other Mirabarran—
"
"Mirabarran, no more," came a voice, Torgar's voice, from the side. "We
are Battlehammer now, one and all. We name not Marchion Elastul as our
enemy, unless an enemy he makes of us, but neither are we loyal to the
throne of Mirabar. Nay, our hearts, our souls, our fists, our hammers, for King
Bruenor!"
A great cheer went up in the hall, started by the dozen or so formerly
Mirabarran dwarves in attendance, and taken up by all standing around the
room.
Bruenor basked in that communal glow for a bit, welcoming it as a needed
ray of light on that dark day. And indeed, the day was dark in Mithral Hall, as
dark as the corridors of the Underdark, as dark as a drow priestess's heart.
Despite the efforts, the sacrifice, the gallantry of all the dwarves, of Catti-brie
and Wulfgar, despite the wise choices of Regis in his time as steward, they
had been put in their hole, sealed in their tunnels, by a foe that Mithral Hall
could not hope to overcome on an open field of battle. Hundreds of Bruenor's
kin were dead, and more than a third of the Mirabarran refugees had fallen.
Bruenor had entertained a line of important figures that day, from Tred
McKnuckles of Felbarr, stung by the loss of his dear friend Nikwillig, to the

Bouldershoulder brothers, Ivan and the indomitable Pikel, giggling always and
full of cheer despite the loss of his arm. Bruenor had gone to see Banak
Brawnanvil, the warcommander who had so brilliantly held the high ground
north of Keeper's Dale for days on end against impossible odds. For Banak
could not come to him. Sorely wounded in the final escape, insisting on being
the last off the cliff, Banak no longer had any use of his legs. An orc spear had
severed his backbone, so said the priests, and there was nothing their healing
spells could do to fix it. He was in his bed that day, awaiting the completion of
a comfortable chair on wheels that would allow him a bit of mobility.
Bruenor had found Banak in a dour mood, but with his fighting spirit intact.
He had been more concerned about those who had fallen than with his own
wounds, as Bruenor expected. Banak was a Brawnanvil, after all, of a line as
sturdy as Battlehammer's own, strong of arm and of spirit, and with loyalty
unmatched. Banak had been physically crippled, no doubt, but Bruenor knew
that the warcommander was hardly out of the fight, wherever that fight may
be.
Nanfoodle's audience marked the end of the announced procession that
day, and so Bruenor dismissed the gnome and excused himself. He had one
more meeting in mind, one, he knew, that was better made in private.
Leaving his escort—Thibbledorf Pwent had insisted that a pair of Gut-
busters accompany the dwarf king wherever he went—at the end of one dimly
lit corridor, Bruenor moved to a door, gently knocked, then pushed it open.
He found Regis sitting at his desk, chin in one hand the other holding a quill
above an open parchment that was trying to curl against the press of mug-
shaped paperweights. Bruenor nodded and entered, taking a seat on the
edge of the halfling's soft bed.
"Ye don't seem to be eatin' much, Rumblebelly," he remarked with a grin.
Bruenor reached under his tunic and pulled forth a thick piece of cake. He
casually tossed it to Regis, who caught it and set it down without taking a bite.
"Bah, but ye keep that up and I'm to call ye Rumblebones!" Bruenor blustered.
"Go on, then!" he demanded, motioning to the cake.
"I'm writing it all down," Regis assured him, and he brushed aside one of
the paperweights and lifted the edge of the parchment, which caused a bit of
the recently placed ink to streak. Noting this, Regis quickly flattened the
parchment and began to frantically blow upon it.
"Ain't nothing there that ye can't be telling me yerself," Bruenor said.
Finally, the halfling turned back to him.
"What's yer grief then, Rumblebelly?" asked the dwarf. "Ye done good—
damn good, by what me generals been telling me."
"So many died," Regis replied, his voice barely a whisper.
"Aye, that's the pain o' war."
"But I kept them out there," the halfling explained, leaping up from his chair,
his short, stocky arms waving all around. He began to pace back and forth,
muttering with every step as if trying to find some way to blurt out all of his
pain in one burst. "Up on the cliff. I could have ordered Banak back in, long
before the final fight. How many would still be alive?"
"Bah, ye're asking questions that ain't got no answers!" Bruenor roared at
him. "Anyone can lead the fight the day after it's done. It's leading the fight
during the fight that's marking yer worth."
"I could have brought them in," the halfling stated. "I should have brought

them in."
"Ah, but ye knew the truth of the orc force, did ye? Ye knew that ten
thousand would add to their ranks and sweep into the dale from the west, did
ye?"
Regis blinked repeatedly, but did not answer.
"Ye knew nothing more than anyone else, Banak included," Bruenor
insisted. "And Banak wasn't keen on coming down that cliff. In the end, when
we learned the truth of our enemy, we salvaged what we could, and that's
plenty, but not as much as we wanted to hold. We gived them the whole of the
northland don't ye see? And that's nothing any Battlehammer's proud to
admit."
"There were too many ..." Regis started, eliciting another loud "Bah!" from
Bruenor.
"We ran away, Rumblebelly! Clan Battlehammer retreated from orcs!"
"There were too many!"
Bruenor smiled and nodded, showing Regis that he had just been played
like a dwarven fiddle. "Course there were, and so we took what we could get,
but don't ye ever think that running from orcs was something meself'd order
unless no other choice was afore me. No other choice! I'd've kept Banak out
there, Rumblebelly. I'd've been out there with him, don't ye doubt!"
Regis looked up at Bruenor and gave a nod of appreciation.
"Questions for us now are, what next?" said Bruenor. "Do we go back out
and fight them again? Out to the east, mayhaps, to open a line across the
Surbrin? Out to the south, so we can sweep back around?"
"The south," Regis muttered. "I sent fifty to the south, accompanying Galen
Firth of Nesme."
"Catti-brie telled me all about it, and in that, too, ye did well, by me own
reckoning. I got no love for them Nesme boys after the way they treated us
them years ago and after the way they ignored Settlestone. Bunch o' stone-
heads, if e'er I seen a bunch o' stoneheads! But a neighbor's a neighbor, and
ye got to help do what ye can do, and from where I'm seeing it, ye did all that
ye could do."
"But we can do more now," Regis offered.
Bruenor scratched his red beard and thought on that a moment. "Might that
we can," he agreed. "A few hundred more moving south might open new
possibilities, too. Good thinking." He looked to Regis as he finished, and noted
happily that the halfling seemed to have shaken off his burden then, an eager
gleam coming back into his soft brown eyes.
"Send Torgar and the boys from Mirabar," Regis suggested. "They're a fine
bunch, and they know how to fight aboveground as well as below."
Bruenor wasn't sure if he agreed with that assessment. Perhaps Torgar,
Shingles, and all the dwarves of Mirabar had seen enough fighting and had
taken on enough special and difficult assignments already. Maybe it was time
for them to take some rest inside Mithral Hall proper, mingling with the
dwarves who had lived in those corridors and chambers since the complex
had been reclaimed from Shimmergloom the shadow dragon and his duergar
minions years before.
Bruenor gave no indication to Regis that he was doubting the wisdom of
the suggestion, though. The halfling had proven himself many times over in
the last tendays, by all accounts, and his insight and understanding was a

resource Bruenor had no intention of squashing.
"Come along, Rumblebelly," he said with a toothy grin. "Let's go see how
Ivan and Pikel are getting on. Might be that they know allies we haven't yet
considered."
"Cadderly?"
"Was thinking more of the elves of the Moonwood," Bruenor explained.
"Seems them two came through there on their way to Mithral Hall. I'm thinking
it'd be a good thing to get them elves putting arrows and magic across the
Surbrin to soften our enemy's entrenchment."
"How would we get word to them?" Regis asked. "The elves, I mean. Do
we have tunnels that go that far east and north?"
"How'd Pikel get him and Ivan there in the first place?" Bruenor replied with
an exaggerated wink. "By Ivan's telling, it's got something to do with trees and
roots. We ain't got no trees, but we got plenty o' roots, I'm thinking."
Regis put on his best Pikel voice when he replied, "Hee hee hee."

Tred McKnuckles emphatically raised a finger to his pursed lips, reminding
the dwarven catapult team that silence was essential.
Bellan Brawnanvil mimicked the movement back to Tred in agreement and
tapped his sideslinger pull crew to ease up on their movements as they
worked to set the basket. Mounted on the side of the jamb of a hallway door,
the sideslinger catapult served as the staple war engine of the outer defenses
of Mithral Hall. Its adjustable arm length made it the perfect war engine to fit
any situation, and in the east, so close to the great flowing river that the
stones continually hummed with the reverberations of its currents, the
catapults were front-line and primary. For just beyond the group's present
position in the eastern reaches of the complex, the tunnels dived down into
the wilds of the Underdark. Even in times of peace, the eastern sideslingers
were often put to use, chasing back umber hulks or displacer beasts, or any of
the other dark denizens of those lightless corridors.
By his own request, Tred had come down for duty right after the door to
Keeper's Dale had been sealed, for the position oversaw those tunnels that
connected Mithral Hall, through the upper Underdark, to Citadel Felbarr,
Tred's home. From that very spot, a location where an ironbound door that
could be quickly and tightly sealed, emissaries from Steward Regis had gone
out to gain audience with King Emerus Warcrown of Citadel Felbarr, to tell
Emerus the tale of Tred and Nikwillig, and his missing caravan.
Tred had remained there for many hours, taking double shifts, and staying
even when he was not on watch. The only time he'd gone back to the main
halls of Clan Battlehammer's complex had been that very day, for he had
been summoned to meet with King Bruenor. He had just returned from that
meeting, to find his companions all astir at reports of movement in the east.
Tred stood with them anxiously and thought, Is this the front end of yet
another attack by Obould's masses? Some monstrous Underdark creature
coming forth in search of a meal? The return of the emissaries, perhaps?
Beyond the door, the tunnel sloped down into a roughly circular natural
chamber that branched off in several directions. Ready to turn that chamber
into a killing ground, the dwarves opposite the sideslinger readied several
kegs of highly flammable oil. At the first sign of trouble, the dwarves would
lead, rolling the barrels down into the lower room, contents spilling on the

floor, then the sideslinger would let fly a wad of burning pitch.
Bellan Brawnanvil signaled Tred and the barrel-rollers that the catapult was
ready, and all the dwarves hushed, more than one falling to the floor and
putting an ear to the stone.
They heard a sound below, from one of the tunnels off the circular
chamber.
A barrel was silently brought into place at the top of the ramp and an eager
young dwarf put his shoulder behind it, ready to send it bouncing down.
Tred peered anxiously around the door jamb above that barrel, straining his
eyes in the darkness. He caught the flicker of torchlight.
So did the dwarf behind the barrel, and he gave a little yelp and started to
shove.
But Tred stopped him before he ever began, waggling a finger at him and
fixing him with a scowl. A moment later, all were glad that he did, for they
heard, "Bah, ye great snorter of pig-sweat, ye turned us all about again!"
"Did not, yer mother's worst mistake! This ain't no chamber we been
through."
"Been through and been out four times, ye dolt!"
"Ain't not!"
Tred and the dwarves around him grinned widely.
"Well, if ye been through four times, then ye been through with a lot less
racket than ye're making now, ye fat-bellied bearded bunch o' archery
targets!" Tred hollered.
Below him, the chamber went silent, and the light quickly flickered out.
"Oh, so now ye're the sneaky things?" Tred asked. "Step up and be
recognized, be ye Warcrown or Battlehammer!"
"Warcrown!" came a shout from below, a voice that sparked some
recognition in Tred.
"Battlehammer!" said another, and the dwarves in the room recognized it
as Sindel Muffinhead, one of the emissaries sent out by Steward Regis, a
young acolyte, and expert pie baker, who named the now famous Cordio as
his older brother.
Torches flared to life below and several figures moved into sight, then
began stomping up the ramp. As they neared, Tred noted an old friend.
"Jackonray Broadbelt!" he called. "Been a halfling's meal and more since I
last seen ye!"
"Tred, me friend!" replied Jackonray, leading the way into the room for his
seven companions, including Sindel, but not the other emissary.
Jackonray wore heavy armor with dark gray metal plates set on thick
leather. His helm was bowl-shaped and ridged, and topped a shock of gray
hair that reached out wildly from beneath its metal hem. Jackonray's beard
was not so unkempt, though, and was streaked with hair the color of gold and
lines the color of silver, braided together to give the dwarf a very distinctive
and distinguished appearance. In accord with his surname, his girdle was
wide and decorated with sparkling jewels. He rested the elbow of his weapon
arm on it as he continued, "Sorry I am to hear o' yer brother." He patted Tred
hard on the shoulder with a hand that seemed as hard as stone.
"Aye, Duggan was a good friend."
"And a loyal companion. A tribute to yer family."
Tred reached up and solemnly squeezed Jackonray's thick and strong arm.

"Ye come from King Emerus, then, and with good news, I'm thinking," Tred
remarked a moment later. "Let's get ye to King Bruenor."
"Aye, straightaways."
The pair and Sindel moved off at a swift pace, the other Felbarran dwarves
falling in line behind them. As they wound through the more populated
reaches of Mithral Hall, more than a few Battlehammer dwarves took up the
march, as well, so that by the time they crossed through the great Undercity
and climbed along the main tunnels leading to Bruenor's chamber, nearly fifty
dwarves formed the procession, many of them chatting amongst themselves,
exchanging information about their respective strongholds. Other runners
went far ahead to announce them to Bruenor long before they arrived.
"Where's Nikwillig, then?" asked Jackonray, rolling along at Tred's side.
"Still out there in the North," Tred explained, and there was no mistaking
the sudden graveness to his tone. "Nikwillig went out to the mountains in the
east to send back a signal, and he knew in doing it that he'd not easily get
back into Mithral Hall. Felt he—we, owed it to Bruenor, since he done so
much to help us avenge our lost kin."
"Seems proper," said Jackonray. "But if he's not in now, he's likely dead."
"Aye, but he died a hero," said Tred. "And no dwarf's ever asking more
than that."
"What more than that might ye ask?" asked Jackonray.
"Here, here," added Sindel.
When the troupe arrived at Bruenor's audience chamber door, they found it
wide open, with the dwarf king inside on his throne, awaiting their arrival.
"King Bruenor, I give ye Jackonray Broadbelt," Tred said with a bow. "Of
the Hornriver Broadbelts, first cousins to King Emerus Warcrown himself.
Jackonray here's King Warcrown's own nephew, and a favored one at that.
Sixth in line for the throne, by last count, behind King Emerus's five sons."
"Sixth or twenty-fifth, depending upon King Warcrown's disposition,"
Jackonray said with a wink. "He's one for keeping us guessing."
"Aye, and a smart choice that's always been," said Bruenor.
"Yer ambassadors're telling me King Emerus that ye've come against
Obould Many-Arrows," Jackonray said.
"One and the same, by all I'm hearing."
"Well, King Bruenor, know that Obould's a smart one, as orcs go. Ye take
great care in handling this snortsnout."
"He sealed me and me kin inside the hall," Bruenor explained. "Shut the
east door by the Surbrin."
"Felbarr scouts have seen as much," Jackonray said. "And them giants and
orcs're building defenses all along the river's western bank."
"And they drove me kin in from the western door, in Keeper's Dale,"
Bruenor admitted. "I'd not thinked that Clan Battlehammer could be put
underground by a bunch o' stinkin' orcs, but what a bunch it is. Thousands
and thousands."
"And led by one that knows how to fight," said Jackonray. "Know in yer
heart, King Bruenor, that if Obould's got ye in here, then Obould's thinking to
come in after ye."
"That'll cost him."
"Dearly, I'm sure, good King Bruenor."
"They been fighting in the south tunnels a bit already," Bruenor reported.

"With smelly trolls and not orcs, but the battling's not so heavy."
Jackonray stroked his silver and gold beard. "Lady Alustriel of Silvery-
moon's been sending out the word of a wide push from the Trollmoors. One
that's threatened all the lands south of here. It's as big a fight as we thinked
we'd ever be seeing, don't ye doubt. But know that Obould's not to let it sit,
and not to let you sit. By all me experience in fighting that dog, and I've had
more than ye know, if there's fighting in the south, then prepare for something
bigger from the north, east, or west. Obould's got you in a hole, but he's not to
let you stay, even if it costs him every orc, goblin, and giant he can find."
"Stupid orcs," Tred muttered.
"Aye, and that's just why they're so dangerous," Bruenor said. He looked
from the two dwarves to his own advisors, then back at Jackonray directly.
"Well, then, what's coming from Felbarr?"
"I appreciate yer bluntness," Jackonray said with another low bow. "And I'm
here to tell ye not to doubt us. Felbarr's behind ye to the last, King Bruenor.
All our gold and all our dwarves. Right now we got hundreds working the
tunnels under the Surbrin, securing the line all the way from Mithral Hall to
Felbarr. We'll have them open and secure, don't ye doubt."
Bruenor nodded his gratitude, but at the same time motioned with his hand
that he wanted to hear more.
"We'll set it as a trade and supply route," Jackonray went on. "King Emerus
telled me to tell yerself that we'll work as agents for Mithral Hall in yer time o'
need, no commission taken."
That brought a concerned look to Bruenor's face, and it was a look mirrored
on all the Battlehammers in attendance.
"Ye're to need to get yer goods to market, and so we'll be yer market,"
Jackonray stated.
"Ye're sounding like we're to give Obould all that he's got and let him keep
it," Bruenor voiced.
For the first time since the meeting commenced, Jackonray seemed a bit
less than sure of himself.
"No, we're not for that, but King Emerus is thinking that it's to take some
time to push the orcs back," Jackonray explained.
"And when time's come to do the pushing?"
"If it comes to fighting, then we'll shore up yer ranks, shoulder to shoulder,"
Jackonray insisted. "Know in yer Delzoun heart, King Bruenor, that Felbarr's
with ye, dwarf to dwarf. When the fighting's starting, we'll be with ye. And not
just Felbarr, don't ye doubt, though it'll take Citadel Adbar longer to mobilize
her thousands."
The show of solidarity touched Bruenor deeply, to be sure, but he didn't
miss the equivocation to Jackonray's remark. The other leaders of the region
had taken note of the orc march, indeed, but there was apparently some
discussion going on about what they should, or even could, do about it.
"In the meanwhile, we'll get those tunnels opened and safe for ye to move
yer goods through to Felbarr and out to market," Jackonray offered, and
Bruenor, who hadn't even entertained such a thought, who hadn't even begun
to resign himself to that grim possibility, merely nodded.

"That orc was something ... beyond any orc," Wulfgar remarked. With a
frame closer to seven feet than six, and hardened in the wilderness of the

tundra of Icewind Dale, the barbarian was as strong as any man, and so he
thought, stronger than any orc. But the brutish creature who had cut Shoudra
Stargleam in half had taught Wulfgar better, tossing the barbarian aside with a
shrug. "It was as if I was pushing against a falling mountainside."
Catti-brie understood his shock and distress. It wasn't often that Wulfgar,
son of Beornegar, had been bested in a test of sheer strength. Even giants
had not thrown him aside with such seeming ease. "They're saying it was
Obould Many-Arrows, himself," she replied.
"He and I will meet again," Wulfgar vowed, his crystalline blue eyes
sparkling at the thought.
Catti-brie limped up beside him and gently brushed his long blond hair from
the side of his face, forcing him to turn and look at her directly.
"You don't be doing anything foolhardy," she said softly. "We'll get Obould,
don't you doubt, but we'll get him in the proper order of business. We'll get him
as we'll get all of them, and there's no room for personal vengeance here.
Bigger stakes than pride."
Wulfgar snickered and smiled. "True enough," he replied, "and yet, you're
not believing the words any more than you're expecting me to believe them.
You want that ugly one in your bow-sight again, as much as I want him now
that I understand what to expect from him."
Catti-brie tried hard not to smile back at the barbarian, but she knew that
her rich blue eyes were shining as brightly as Wulfgar's. "Oh, I'm wanting
him," she admitted. "But not so much with me bow."
She led his gaze with her own down to the fabulous sword sheathed on her
left hip. Khazid'hea, "Cutter," as it was called, a name that surely fit. Catti-brie
had put that blade through solid stone. Could any armor, even the wondrous
suit encasing Obould Many-Arrows, turn its keen edge?
Both of them seemed to realize then that they were but inches apart, close
enough to feel the warmth of each other's breath.
Catti-brie broke the tension first, reaching up and playfully tousling
Wulfgar's wild shock of hair, then hopping up to her tip-toes and giving him a
kiss on the cheek—the kiss of a friend, and nothing more.
In its own way, that was a defining moment for her.
Wulfgar's reciprocating grin, though, seemed a bit less than certain.
"So we're thinking we should be getting scouts out through the chimneys,"
came a voice from behind Catti-brie, and she turned around to see her adop-
tive father Bruenor entering the room, Regis in tow. "We got to know what our
enemies are thinking if we're to counter them properly."
"They're orcs," Wulfgar said. "Betting would say that they're not thinking
much."
His attempt at humor would have been more successful if that last
maneuver of the orc army had not been so fresh in all their minds, the
deceptive swing behind the mountain spurs to the west that brought the bulk
of their force in behind Banak's charges, nearly spelling disaster for the
dwarves.
"We can't be knowing a thing about them orcs unless we're seeing it
ourselfs," Bruenor remarked. "I'm not for underestimating this one again."
Regis shifted uncomfortably.
"I'm thinking that we scored a bigger victory than we realized," Catti-brie
was quick to remark. "We won the day out there, though our losses surely

hurt."
"Seems to me like we're the ones in our hole," Bruenor replied.
"But it's seeming to me that we could not've done better," reasoned the
woman, and she looked directly at the halfling, her expression showing her
approval. "If we'd've come right in, then we'd not now know what's come
against us. What straights might we soon find ourselves in if you had acted
otherwise, if we had run from the ridge straightaway? Would we truly under-
stand the size and ferocity of the force that's arrayed against us? Would we
have delivered so powerful a blow against our enemy? They've come to fight
us, and so we'll be fighting, don't you doubt, and better that we understand
what we're fighting, and better that we've laid so many low already. Thanks to
Nanfoodle and the others, we've killed them as overwhelmingly as we could
ever have hoped thus far, even if all the fighting had been in our own
defended tunnels."
"Ye got the right way o' seeing things, girl," Bruenor agreed after a pause to
digest the reasoning. "If they're thinking to come in against us, at least now
we're knowing what they got to throw our way."
"So hold our heads high and hold our weapons all the tighter," Wulfgar
chimed in.
"Oo oi!" said Regis, and everyone looked at him curiously.
"What's that meaning, anyway?" asked Catti-brie.
Regis shrugged. "Just sounded right," he explained, and no one disagreed.

5
TOO HIGH A CEILING
Galen Firth paced furiously, every stride showing his mounting impatience.
He muttered under his breath, taking care to keep his curses quiet enough so
that they wouldn't disturb the dwarves, who were huddled together in a great
circle, each with his arms over the shoulders of those beside him. Heads
down, the bearded folk offered prayers to Moradin for the souls of Fender and
Bonnerbas. They had run a long way from the hole they had cut out of the
tunnels to escape the troll ambush, but they were still outdoors, sheltered
within a copse of fir trees from a heavy rain that had come up.
When the dwarves had finished—finally finished, to Galen's thinking—
General Dagna wasted no time in marching over to the human.
"We'll be considering our course this night," the dwarf informed him.
"More'n a few're thinking it's past time we got back into tunnels."
"We just got chased out of tunnels," Galen reminded him.
"Aye, but not them kind o' tunnels. We're looking for tunnels deep, tunnels
o' worked stone—tunnels to give a dwarf something worth holding onto. No
trolls're gonna push Battlehammer dwarves out of stone tunnels, don't ye
doubt!"
"You're forgetting our course and our reason for being here."
"Them trolls're onto us," Dagna replied. "They'll catch up to us soon
enough, and ye know it."
"Indeed, if we continue to stop and pray every .. ." Galen's voice trailed off
as he considered Dagna's expression and realized that he was going over the
line.
"I'll forgive ye that, but just this once," the dwarf warned. "I'm knowin' that
ye're hurting for yer losses. We're all knowin' that. But we're running out o'
time. If we're staying here much longer, then don't ye be thinking we'll find our
way back to our home anytime soon."
"What do you mean to do?"
Dagna turned around slowly, surveying the landscape. "We'll head west, to
that high ridge there," he said, pointing to a line of elevated ground some
miles distant. "From there we'll take us the best look we can find. Might be
that we'll see yer people. Might be that we won't."
"And if we don't, then you intend to turn back for Mithral Hall."
"No other choice's afore me."
"And where for Galen, then?" the man asked.
"Wherever Galen's choosing to go," Dagna answered. "Ye've proven
yerself in a fight, to me and me boys. They'll keep ye along, and not a one's to
complain. But it might be that ye cannot do that. Might be that Galen's got to
stay and look, and die, if that's to be. Might be that Galen's doing better by his
folk if he goes off to Silverymoon or some other town that's not being pressed
by orcs and can spare more of an army. Choice is yer own."
Galen rubbed a hand over his face, feeling stubble that was fast turning
into a thick beard. He wanted to yell and scream at Dagna, truly he did, but he
knew that the dwarf was offering him all that he could under the present
conditions. Somehow, the trolls were dogging them, and would find them
again. How many times could Dagna and his small force hope to escape?
"We begin our march to the ridge this very night?"

"See no reason to be waiting," Dagna replied.
Galen nodded and let it go at that. He got his gear collected and his boots
tightened as the dwarves formed up for their march. He tried to focus on the
present, on the duty before him, for he knew that if he tried to think ahead, his
resolve would likely crumble. For every question in Galen Firth's life at that
point seemed to begin with, "What if?"
*
*
*
*
*
"I will not tolerate a retreat into the tunnels until we have discovered the
disposition of my people!" Galen Firth grumbled as he pulled himself over the
last rise of rock to the top of the windswept ridgeline. The man brushed
himself off and stared at Dagna, looking for some reaction to his insistence,
but found the dwarf strangely distracted, and looking off toward the southwest.
"Wha—?" Galen asked, the word catching in his throat as he turned to
follow the dwarf's line of sight, to see the light of fires—campfires, perhaps—in
the distance.
"Might be we done just that," Dagna said.
More dwarves came up around them, all hopping and pointing excitedly to
the distant lights.
"Durn fools to be lighting so bright a burn with trolls all about," one dwarf
remarked, and others nodded their agreement, or started to, until Dagna,
noting the erratic movements of the flames, cut them short.
"Them fires're against the trolls!" the general realized. "They got them-
selves a fight down there!"
"We must go to them!" cried Galen.
"A mile...." a dwarf observed.
"Of tough ground," another added.
"Mark the stars and run on, then!" General Dagna ordered.
The dwarves lined up the fires with the celestial constants, and began to
stream fast down the back side of the ridge. Galen Firth sprinted off ahead of
the pack, foolishly so, for his human eyes weren't very good in the darkness.
Before he'd gone half a dozen strides, the man tripped and stumbled, then ran
face long into a tree branch and staggered backward. He would have fallen to
the ground had not Dagna arrived with open arms to catch him.
"Ye stay right beside me, long legs," the dwarf ordered. "We'll get ye there!"
With their short, muscled legs, dwarves were not the fastest runners in the
Realms, but no race could match their stamina and determination. The force
rolled past and over rocks and logs, and when one tripped, others caught him,
up righted him, and kept him moving swiftly along his way.
They charged along some lower ground, splashed through some unseen
puddles and scrambled through a tangle of birch trees and brush, a snarl that
got so thick at one point that several dwarves brought forth their axes and
began chopping with abandon. As they came through that last major obstacle,
the lights of the fires clearly visible directly ahead, Galen Firth began to hear
the cries of battle. Shouts for support and calls of pain and rage split the night,
and Galen's heart sank as he realized that many of those calls were not
coming from warriors, but from women, children, and elderly folk.
He didn't know what to expect when he and Dagna crashed through the
last line of brush and onto the battlefield, though he surely expected the worst
scenario, a helter skelter slaughter ground with his people trapped into small
groups that could offer only meager resistance. He began to urge Dagna to

form up a defensive ring, a shell of dwarves to protect his people, but when
they came in sight of the actual fighting, Galen's words caught in his throat,
and his heart soared with renewed hope.
His people, the hearty folk of Nesme, were fighting hard and fighting well.
"They're in a double ellipse," one dwarf coming in behind remarked, refer-
ring to a very intricate defensive formation, and one, Galen knew, that the
riders of Nesme had often employed along the broken, tree-speckled ground
north of the Trollmoors. In the double ellipse, two elongated rings of warriors
formed end-to-end with a single joining point between them. Worked
harmoniously, the formation was one of complete support, with every angle of
battle offering a striking zone to more defenders than attackers. But it was
also a risky formation, for if it failed at any point, the aggressors would have
the means to isolate and utterly destroy entire sections of the defending force.
So far, it seemed to be holding, but barely, and only because the defenders
employed many, many flaming torches, waving them wildly to fend off the
trolls and their even more stupid partners, the treelike bog blokes.
"Dead trees must fall!" Galen shouted when he realized that the common
allies of the wretched trolls were among the attackers. For bog blokes
resembled nothing more than a small and skeletal dead tree, with twisted
arms appearing as stubby limbs.
As he spoke, the man noted one part of the Nesme line in serious jeopardy,
as a pair of young men, boys really, fell back before the snarling and
devastating charge of a particularly large and nasty troll. Galen broke away
from the dwarves and veered straight for the troll's back, his sword leading.
He hit the unwitting creature at a full run, driving his sword right through the
beast and making it lurch forward wildly. To their credit, the two young men
didn't break ranks and flee, but just dodged aside of the lurching troll, then
came right back in beside its swiping arms, smacking at it with their torches,
the fires bubbling the troll's mottled green and gray skin.
Galen pulled his blade free and spun just in time to fend off the clawing
hands of another troll, and another that came in beside it. Hard-pressed, and
with the troll he had skewered behind him hardly out of the fighting, Galen
feared that he would meet an abrupt end. He breathed a bit easier when the
troll before him and to his left lurched over suddenly and tumbled away. As it
fell, a heavy dwarven axe came up over its bending head and drove it down
more forcefully. That dwarf pressed on, right past Galen to take on the
wounded beast behind the man, while another dwarf leaped into view atop the
fallen troll, using it as a springboard to launch him headlong into the other troll
standing in front of Galen. His flying tackle took the beast around the waist,
and as he swung about, the dwarf twisted his body to give him some leverage
across the troll's lower half. The dwarf tugged mightily with his short, muscled
arms, his momentum taking him right past the surprised troll. When the
diminutive bearded warrior used that momentum, combined with his powerful
arms, he compelled the troll to follow, the creature rolling right over him as he
fell.
"Give me yer torch!" Galen heard the first dwarf cry to someone in the
defensive line.
Galen turned and glanced over his shoulder to consider that scene, then
fell back with a yelp as a torch flew right past his face. He followed the line of
the fiery weapon, left to right, to the waiting hand of the complimenting dwarf,

who caught it deftly and quickly inverted it. As the troll below that dwarf rolled
around to counter the attack, the dwarf put that flame into its eye, and stuffed
it right into the troll's mouth as the creature opened its jaws wide to let out an
agonized roar. The troll flailed wildly and the dwarf went flying away, but he
landed nimbly on his steady feet and brought a warhammer up before him in a
single fluid movement.
Other enemies moved to engulf the dwarf and Galen, but Dagna and his
boys were there first, fiercely supporting their comrades. They formed into a
tight fighting diamond quickly to Galen's right, and to the man's left, the
remaining dwarves similarly formed up. The two groups quickly pivoted to
bring their lines together.
"Yer folks ain't no strangers to battle, I'm thinking!" General Dagna
remarked to Galen. "Go on, then," Dagna offered, "join with yer folk. Me and
me boys're here for ye, don't ye doubt!"
Galen Firth spun around and smashed the stubborn troll behind him yet
again, then rushed past the falling beast to find a place in the human
defensive line. He knew that at least some of the Riders must be among the
group, for its coordination was too great for untrained warriors alone.
He spotted the central figure of the defenders even as that young man
noted him, and Galen's gaze grew more stern. The young warrior seemed to
melt back under that glare. Galen sprinted past his townsfolk, moving to the
joint between the two coordinated defensive formations.
"I will assume the pivot," he said to the apparent leader.
"I have it secured, Captain Firth," the man, Rannek by name, replied.
"Move aside!" Galen demanded, and Rannek fell back.
"Tighten the ranks!" Galen called across the Nesme position. "Bring it in
closer so our dwarven allies can facilitate our retreat!"
*

"Good choice," muttered General Dagna, who had watched the curious
exchange between the two men. Even with the arrival of two score dwarf war-
riors, the group of humans could not hope to win out against the monstrous
attackers. Already the fires were dying low in several spots along the line, and
wherever that happened, the fearsome trolls were fast to the spot, clawed
hands striking hard and with impunity. For trolls did not fear conventional
weapons. Cutting a troll to pieces, after all, only increased the size of its
family.
"Form up, boys!" Dagna called. "Double ranks! Three sides o' chopping!"
With a communal roar, the disciplined dwarves spun, jumped, tumbled, and
hopped into proper formation, forming a triangle whose each tip was tightly
packed with the fiercest warriors. Clan Battlehammer called that particular
formation the "splitting wedge" because of its ability to maneuver easily
against weak spots in their enemy's line, shifting the focus of its offensive
push. Dagna stayed in the middle of the formation, directing, rolling the
dwarves like a great killing machine along the perimeter in support of the
human line. They did an almost complete circuit, driving back the trolls with
torches and splitting bog blokes like firewood with great chops of heavy axes.
On Dagna's sudden order, and with stunning precision, one tip broke away
and rushed past the human line to the north, back toward the higher ground,
pummeling the few trolls blocking that particular escape route.
"To the north!" Galen Firth cried to his charges, seeing the plan unfolding.

He shoved those people nearest him that direction, urging them on.
Across from him, Rannek did likewise, and between the two, they had the
bulk of the human force moving in short order.
Dagna watched the haphazard movements, trying hard to time his own
pivots to properly cover the rear of the retreat. He noted the two men working
frantically, one seeming a younger version of the other, but with the calm one
would expect of a trained and veteran soldier. He also noted that Galen Firth
pointedly did not glance at his counterpart, did not acknowledge the man's
efforts at all.
Dagna shook his head and focused again on his own efforts.
"Damn humans," he muttered. "Stubborn lot."

"The rescue mission succeeds," Tos'un Armgo remarked as he and Kaer'lic
watched the continuing battle from afar.
"For now, perhaps," the priestess replied.
Tos'un read the nonchalance clearly in her tone, and indeed, why should
Kaer'lic, and why should he, really care whether or not a group of humans
escaped the clutches of Proffit's monstrous forces?
"The dwarves will turn for home now, likely," the male drow said. As he
finished, he glanced over his shoulder to the bound and gagged Fender. With
a sly grin, the drow kicked the dwarf hard in the side, and Fender curled up
and groaned.
"That is but a small number of Nesme's scattered refugees, by all reports,"
Kaer'lic countered. "And these frightened humans know that they have kin in
similar straights all across the region. Perhaps the dwarves will link with this
force in an effort to widen the rescue mission. Would that not be the sweetest
irony of all, to have our enemies gather together for their ultimate demise?"
"Our enemies?"
The simple question gave Kaer'lic pause, obviously.
"In a choice between humans and trolls, even dwarves and trolls, I believe
that I would side against the trolls," the male drow admitted. "Though now, the
promise of finding a vulnerable wayward human is a tempting one that I fear I
will not be able to resist."
"Nor should you," the priestess said. "Take your pleasures where you may,
my friend, for soon enough, striking at the enemy will likely mean crossing
lines of wary and battle-ready dwarves."
"Perhaps that pleasure might involve a few vulnerable orcs, as well."
Kaer'lic gave a little laugh at the thought. "I would wish them all, orc, troll,
dwarf, human, and giant alike, a horrible death and be done with it."
"Even better," Tos'un agreed. "I do hope that the dwarves decide to remain
in the southland openly and with a widening force. Their presence will make it
easier for us to persuade Proffit to remain here."
The words silenced Tos'un even as he spoke them, and seemed to have a
sobering effect upon Kaer'lic, as well. For that was the gist of it, the unspoken
agreement between the two dark elves that they really did not want to wander
the tunnels leading back to the north and the main defenses of Mithral Hall.
They had been sent south by Obould to guide Proffit through that very course,
to urge the trolls on as the monsters pressured the dwarves in the southern
reaches of the complex. But the thought of going against fortified dwarven
positions and into a dwarven hall accompanied by a horde of stupid brutes

was not really an appealing one, after all.
"Proffit will turn his eyes to the north, as Obould bade him," Tos'un added a
moment later.
"Then you and I must convince him that the situation here is more impor-
tant," Kaer'lic replied without hesitation.
"Obould will not be pleased."
"Then perhaps Obould will slay Proffit, or even better, perhaps they will
slaughter each other."
Tos'un smiled and let it go at that, perfectly comfortable with the role that
he and his three drow companions had made for themselves. Prodding
Obould and Gerti Orelsdottr to war from the beginning, the drow had never
really concerned themselves with the outcome. In truth, they hadn't a care as
to which side emerged victorious, dwarf or orc, as long as the drow found
some excitement, and some profit, in the process. And if that process inflicted
horrific pain and loss to the minions of Obould, Gerti, and Bruenor Battleham-
mer alike, then all the better!
Of course, neither Kaer'lic nor Tos'un knew then that their two missing
companions, Donnia Soldou and Ad'non Kareese, lay dead in the north, killed
by a rogue drow.

They found their first break in a shallow cave tucked into a rocky cliff
behind a small pond more than an hour later, and there, too, their first oppor-
tunity to bandage wounds and determine who was even still among their
continually thinning ranks. Nesme had been an important town in the region
for many generations, strong and solid behind fortified walls, the vanguard of
the Silver Marches against intrusions from the monsters of the wild
Trollmoors. That continual strife and diligence had bred a closeness among
the community of Nesmians so that they felt every loss keenly.
The day had brought more than a dozen deaths, and had left several more
people missing—a difficult loss for but one band of less than a hundred
refugees. And given the seriousness of the wounds that many resting in that
shallow cave had suffered, that number of dead seemed sure to rise through
the remaining hours of the night.
"Daylight ain't no friend o' trolls, even in tracking," Dagna said to Galen
Firth when he met the man at the cave entrance a short while later. "Me
boys're covering the tracks and killing any trolls and blokes wandering too
close, but we're not to sit here for long without them beasties coming against
us in force."
"Then we move, again and again," Galen Firth said.
Dagna considered the man's tone—determination and resignation mingled
into one—as much as his agreement.
"We'll cross shadow to shadow," Galen went on. "We'll find their every
weakness and hit them hard. We'll find all the remaining bands of my towns-
folk and meld them into a singular and devastating force."
"We'll find tunnels, deep and straight, and run headlong for Mithral Hall,"
General Dagna corrected, and Galen Firth's eyes flashed with anger.
"More of my people are out there. I will not forsake them in their time of
desperation."
"Well, that's for yerself to decide," said Dagna. "I come here to see how I
might be helping, and so me and me boys did. I left six more dead back there.

That's eight o' fifty, almost one in six."
"And your efforts saved ten times the number of your dead. Are not ten of
Nesme's folk worth a single dwarf's life?"
"Bah, don't ye be putting it like that," Dagna said, and he gave a great
snort. "I'm thinking that we're all to be slaughtered in one great fight if we
make a single mistake. More than two score o' me boys and closer to a hun-
nerd o' yer own folk."
"Then we won't make a mistake," Galen Firth said in a low and even tone.
Dagna snorted again and moved past the man, knowing that he wouldn't be
getting anything settled that night. Nor did he have to, for in truth, he had no
idea of where the force might even find any tunnels that would take them back
to Mithral Hall. Dagna knew, and so did Galen, that this band would be
moving out of necessity and not choice over the next hours, and even days,
likely, so arguing about courses that might not ever even become an option
seemed a rather silly thing to do.
Dagna crossed by the folk of Nesme, accepting their kind words and
gratitude, and offering his own praise for their commendable efforts. He also
found his own clerics hard at work tending the wounded, and he offered a
solid pat on each dwarf shoulder as he passed. Mostly, though, Dagna
studied the humans. They were indeed a good and sturdy folk, in the tough
general's estimation, if a bit orc-headed.
Well, he supposed, orc-headed only if Galen Firth is an accurate repre-
sentative of the community.
That notion had Dagna moving more purposefully among the ranks, seek-
ing out a particular man whose actions had stood above the norm back on the
battlefield. He found that man at the very back of the shallow cave, reclining
on a smooth, rounded stone. As he approached, Dagna noted the man's
many wounds, including three fingers on his left hand twisted at an angle that
showed them to certainly be broken, and a garish tear on his left ear that
looked as if the ear might fall right off.
"Ye might want to be seeing the priests about them fingers and that ear,"
Dagna said, moving up before the man.
Obviously startled, the warrior quickly sat up and straightened his battered
chain and leather tunic.
"Dagna's me name," the dwarf said, extending his calloused hand.
"General Dagna o' Mithral Hall, Warcommander to King Bruenor Battle-
hammer."
"Well met, General Dagna," the man said. "I am Rannek of Nesme."
"One o' them Riders?"
The man nodded. "I was, at least."
"Bah, ye'll get yer town back soon enough!"
The dwarf noted that his optimism didn't seem to lift the man's expression,
though he suspected, given the reception Galen Firth had offered Rannek
back at the battlefield, that the dourness wasn't precipitated by the wider
prospects for the town.
"Ye done well back there," Dagna offered, eliciting a less-than-resounding
shrug.
"We fight for our very existence, good dwarf. Our options are few. If we err,
we die."
"Ain't that the way of it?" asked the dwarf. "In me many years, I've come to

see the truth in the notion that war's the time for determining the character of
a dwarf. Or a man."
"Indeed."
Dagna's eyes narrowed under his bushy and prominent eyebrows. "Ye got
nearly a hunnerd o' yer kin in here looking to ye. Ye're knowing that? And
here ye be with a face showing defeat, yet ye got most o' yer folk out o' what
them trolls suren thought to be the end o' yer road."
"They'll be looking to Galen Firth, now that he has returned," said Rannek.
"Bah, that's not a good enough answer."
"It is the only answer I have," said Rannek.
He slid off the rounded stone, offered a polite and unenthusiastic bow, and
moved away.
General Dagna heaved a resigned sigh. He didn't have time for this. Not
now. Not with trolls pressing in on them.
"Humans.. .." he muttered under his breath, giving a shake of his hairy
head.

"They are helpless and they are scattered," Kaer'lic Suun Wett said to the
giant two-headed Proffit soon after the human band had temporarily escaped
from the troll and bog bloke pursuit. "The hour of complete domination over all
the region is at hand for you. If you strike at them now, hard and relentlessly,
you will utterly destroy all remnants of Nesme and any foothold the humans
can dare hope to hold in your lands."
"King Obould wants us in the tunnels," one of Proffit's heads replied.
"Now!" the other head emphatically added.
"To help with Obould's victory in the north?" Kaer'lic said. "In lands that
mean nothing to Proffit and his people?"
"Obould helped us," Proffit said.
"Obould showed Proffit the way out, with all the trolls behind him," the other
head added.
Kaer'lic knew well enough what Proffit was referring to. It had been none
other than Donnia Soldou, in fact, who had orchestrated the rise of Proffit,
through the proxies of King Obould. All that Donnia had hoped was that Proffit
and his force of brutish trolls would cause enough of a distraction closer to the
major human settlements to keep the bigger players of the region, primarily
Lady Alustriel of Silverymoon, from turning her eyes and her formidable
armies upon Obould.
Of course at that time, Kaer'lic and the other dark elves had no idea of how
fast or how high King Obould would rise. The game had changed.
"And Proffit helped Obould close the back door of Mithral Hall," Kaer'lic
reminded.
"Tit," said one head.
"For tat," the other added with a rumbling chuckle.
"But dwarves are left," said the first.
"To," said the other.
"Kill!" they both shouted together.
"Dwarves of Mithral Hall to kill, yes," agreed Kaer'lic. "Dwarves who are
stuck in a hole and going nowhere. Dwarves who will still be there waiting to
be killed when Proffit has done his work here."
The troll's heads looked at each other and nodded in unison.

"But the humans of Nesme are not so trapped," Tos'un Armgo put in, right
on cue, as he and Kaer'lic had previously decided and practiced. "They will
run far away, out of Proffit's reach. Or they will bring in many, many friends,
and when Proffit comes back out of the tunnels, he may find a huge army
waiting for him."
"More."
"To."
"Kill!" the troll said, both heads grinning stupidly.
"Or too many to kill," Tos'un argued after a quick, concerned glance at
Kaer'lic.
"The human friends of Nesme will bring wizards with great magical fires,"
Kaer'lic ominously warned.
That took the stupid and eager smile from Proffit's faces.
"What to do?" one head asked.
"Fight them now," said Kaer'lic. "We will help you locate each human band
and to position your forces to utterly destroy them. It will not take long, and
you can go into the tunnels to fight the dwarves confident that no force will
mobilize against you and await your return."
Proffit's two heads bobbed, one chewing its lip, the other holding its mouth
open, and both obviously trying to digest the big words and intricate concepts.
"Kill the humans, then kill the dwarves," Kaer'lic said simply. "Then the land
is yours. No one will bother to rebuild Nesme if everyone from Nesme is
dead."
"Proffit likes that."
"Kill the humans," said the other head.
"Kill the dwarves," the first added.
"Kill them all!" the second head cheered.
"And eat them!" yelled the first.
"Eat them all," Kaer'lic cheered, and she motioned to Tos'un, who added,
"Taste good!"
Tos'un offered a shrug back at Kaer'lic, showing her that he really had no
idea what to add to the ridiculous conversation. It didn't really matter anyway,
because both dark elves realized soon enough that their little ploy had
worked, and so very easily.
"I remember when Obould was as readily manipulated as that," Kaer'lic
said almost wistfully as she and Tos'un left Proffit's encampment.
Tos'un didn't disagree with the sentiment. Indeed, the world had seemed so
much simpler a place not so very long ago.

6
FORWARD THINKING ORC
"All the anger of the day," Tsinka Shinriil said as she ran her fingers over
Obould's massive shoulder. "Let it lead you now." Then she bit the orc on the
back of his neck and began to wrap her sinewy arms and legs around him.
Feeling the tautness of her muscles against him, Obould was again
reminded of the wild pegasus. Amusing images floated through his mind, but
he pushed them away as he easily moved the amorous shaman aside,
stepping out into the center of his tent.
"It is much more than a stupid creature," he remarked, as much to himself
as to Tsinka. He turned to see the shaman staring at him, her bewildered
expression so much in contrast to her trembling and naked form.
"The winged horse," Obould explained. Tsinka slumped down on a pile of
furs. "More than a horse ... more than the wings ..." He turned away, nodding,
and began to pace. "Yes... that was my mistake."
"Mistake? You are Gruumsh. You are perfect."
Obould's grin became an open snicker as he turned back to her and said, "I
underestimated the creature. A pegasus, so it would seem, is much more than
a horse with wings."
Tsinka's jaw drooped. Obould laughed at her.
"A horse might be clever, but this creature is more," said Obould. "It is wise.
Yes! And if I know that..."
"Come to me," Tsinka bade him, and she extended her arm and struck a
pose so exaggerated, so intentionally alluring, that Obould found it simply
amusing.
He went to her anyway, but remained quite distracted as he thought
through the implications of his insight. He knew the disposition of the
pegasus; he knew that the creature was much more than a stupid horse with
wings, for he had come to recognize its stubbornness as loyalty. If he knew
that, then the pegasus's former masters surely knew it, and if they knew it,
then there was certainly no way that they would let the imprisonment stand.
That thought reverberated through Obould, overshadowing every move-
ment of Tsinka, every bite, every caress, every purr. Rather than diminish in
the fog of lust, the images of elves sweeping down to rescue the pegasus only
gained momentum and clarity. Obould understood the true value of the
creature his minions had captured.
The orc king gave a great shout, startling Tsinka. She froze and stared at
him, her eyes at first wild and showing confusion.
Obould tossed her off to the side and leaped up, grabbing a simple fur to
wrap around himself as he pushed through the tent flap and out into the
encampment.
"Where are you going?" Tsinka shrieked at him. "You cannot go!"
Obould disappeared behind the tent flap as it fell back in place.
"You must not go out without your armor!" cried Tsinka. "You are Gruumsh!
You are the god! You must be protected."
Obould's head poked back in, his eyes and toothy grin wide.
"If I am a god ..." he started to say, but he left the question there, letting
Tsinka reason it out for herself. If he was a god, after all, then why would he
need armor?

"Sunrise," Innovindil said breathlessly when at long last she saw the
marvelous winged horse.
Behind her, over the rocky bluff and down the back slope of the mountain
spur, Sunset pawed the ground and snorted, obviously aware that her brother
and companion was down there in the grassy vale.
Innovindil hardly heard the pegasus behind her, and hardly noticed her
dark elf companion stirring at her side. Her eyes remained locked on the
pegasus below, legs bound as it grazed in the tall brown grass. The elf
couldn't block out recollections of the last time she had seen Sunrise, caught
under a net, nor those images that had accompanied that troubling scene.
The death of her lover Tarathiel played out so clearly in her mind again. She
saw his desperate war dance against Obould and that sudden and stunning
end.
She stared at Sunrise and blinked back tears.
Drizzt Do'Urden put a hand on her shoulder, and when Innovindil finally
managed to glance over at him, she recognized that he understood very
clearly the tumult within her.
"I know," the drow confirmed. "I see him, too."
Innovindil silently nodded.
"Let us find a way to take a giant stride toward avenging Tarathiel," Drizzt
said. "Above all else, he would demand that we free Sunrise from the orcs.
Let us give his spirit some rest."
Another silent nod, and Innovindil looked back down at the grassy vale.
She didn't focus on the pegasus, but rather on the approach routes that would
bring them near to the poor creature. She considered the orc guards milling
about, counting half a dozen.
"We could swoop in fast and hard upon Sunset," she offered. "I drop you
down right behind Sunrise and cover your movements as you free our
captured friend."
Drizzt was shaking his head before she ever finished. He knew that the
large enemy encampment was just over the low ridge on the other side of the
vale.
"Our time will be too short," he replied. "If we alert them before we even
arrive on the scene, our time to free Sunrise and be away will be shorter still.
Frost giants can throw boulders a long, long way, and their aim is usually
true."
Innovindil didn't argue the point. Her own thinking, in fact, had been moving
along those same lines even as she was offering her suggestion. When she
looked back at Drizzt, she rested more easily, for she could see the dark elf's
eyes searching out every approach and weighing every movement. Innovindil
had already gained tremendous respect for the dark elf. If anyone could pull
off the rescue, it was Drizzt Do'Urden.
"Tell Sunset to be ready to come to your whistle," the drow said a few
moments later. "Just as when we ... when you, killed Obould's murderous
son."
Innovindil slid back from the ridge, belly-crawling over the far side to
Sunset. When she returned a few moments later, she was greeted by a smil-
ing Drizzt, who was waving his hand for her to follow. He slithered over the
stones as easily as a snake, Innovindil close behind.

It took the pair nearly half an hour to traverse the mostly open ground of the
mountain's eastern slope. They moved from shadow to shadow, from nook to
jag to cranny. Drizzt's path got them to the valley floor just north of the field
where Sunrise grazed, but still with fifty yards of open ground between them
and the pegasus. From that better vantage point, they noted two more orc
guards, bringing the number to eight.
Drizzt pointed to himself, to Innovindil, then to the tall grass, and moved his
hand in a slithering, snakelike fashion. When the elf nodded her under-
standing and began to crouch, the drow held up his hand to stop her. He
started to work his fingers in the silent drow code, but stopped short in
frustration, wishing that she could understand it.
Instead, Drizzt twisted his face and pushed his nose up, trying to look very
orclike. Then he indicated the tall grass again and gave an uncertain shrug.
Innovindil winked in reply, to show that she had taken his meaning, and as
she went back into her crouch, she produced a dagger from her boot and
brought it up to her mouth. Holding it between clenched teeth, the elf went
down to her belly and moved out of the trees and to the edge of the grass.
She glanced back at Drizzt, indicating with her hand that she'd go out to the
right, moving west of Sunrise's position.
The drow went into the grass to her left, similarly on his belly, and the two
moved along.
Drizzt took his movements in bursts of ten elbow-steps, slowly and
methodically creeping through the grass, then pausing and daring to lift his
head enough to take note of the closest orc guard. He wanted to veer off and
go right to that one, to leave it dead in the grass, but that was not the point of
their mission. Drizzt fought aside his instinctive rage, against the Hunter within
him that demanded continual retribution for the death of Bruenor and the
others. He controlled those angry instincts and reminded himself silently that
Sunrise was depending on him, that the ghost of Tarathiel, another fallen
friend, demanded it of him.
He veered away from the orc guard, swerving wide enough to avoid
detection and putting himself back in line to approach Sunrise from the east.
Soon he was inside the orc guard perimeter. He could hear them all around,
chattering in their guttural language, or kicking at the dirt. He heard Sunrise
paw the ground and was able to guess that he was still about twenty-five feet
from the steed. That distance would likely take him longer than the hundred-
plus feet he had come from the trees, he knew, for every movement had to be
silent and carefully made so as to not disturb the grass.
Many minutes passed Drizzt by as he lay perfectly still, then he dared to
place one elbow out in front of him and propel himself a foot forward. He
moved slightly back to the west as he made his way, closing the ground, he
hoped, between himself and Innovindil.
A footstep right before him froze him in place. A moment later, through the
grass, he saw a strong, thick orc leg, wrapped in leather and furs.
He didn't dare draw breath.
The brutish creature called to its friends—something in its native language
spoken too quickly for Drizzt to decipher. The drow did relax just a bit, though,
when he heard other orcs respond with a laugh.
The orc walked along to the west, moving out of Drizzt's way.
The dark elf paused a bit longer, giving the creature time to completely

clear and also making sure that it did not take note of Innovindil.
Satisfied, he started to move along once more, but then stopped in surprise
at a sudden whinny from Sunrise. The pegasus reared and snorted, front
hooves thumping the ground hard. The winged horse neighed again, loudly
and wildly, and bucked, kicking the air so forcefully that Drizzt clearly heard
the crack of hooves cutting the air.
The drow dared lift his head—and quickly realized his mistake.
Behind him, up in the trees from which he and Innovindil had just come, he
heard the shout of an orc lookout. Before him, the eight guards began to close
ranks, and one called out.
A noise to the side turned the drow that way—to see more orcs charging
over the distant ridgeline.
"A trap," he whispered under his breath, hardly believing it possible.
To his other side, he caught a burst of movement as Innovindil came up
fast behind an orc guard. Her hand, so deceptively delicate, flashed around
the surprised creature's face and pulled its head back, while her other hand
came around the other way, the knife's edge drawing a red line on the
creature's exposed neck.
The next nearest orc gave a shout and charged as its companion tumbled
down, clutching its mortal wound.
Innovindil's hand snapped forward, launching the already bloody dagger at
the incoming orc. With wild gyrations, hands flailing, the orc managed to avoid
the missile, but the clever elf was really just looking for a distraction. In a fluid
movement, she drew forth her sword and dived into a forward roll, closing the
ground between herself and the dodging orc. She came up to her feet
gracefully, still moving forward, sword leading and scoring a solid strike into
the orc's chest.
But three others charged in at her.
Drizzt called upon his innate drow abilities and put a globe of magical
darkness in their path, then leaped up and raced to intercept. One of the orcs
managed to stop short of the enchanted area, while another simply roared
and charged in headlong, and the third veered off to the side.
"Coming through!" the drow warned his companion, and even as he fin-
ished, the charging orc burst out the other side of the darkness globe, barely
two strides from the elf.
But Drizzt's warning was enough for Innovindil, and she had her sword
angled up before her. As the orc came in hard, spear leading, she parried the
tip aside.
The orc barreled on, trying to bury her beneath its larger frame, but at the
last moment, Innovindil fell to all fours, turning sidelong to the brute. Despite
all its efforts, the orc couldn't slow and couldn't turn, and it tripped against her
and tumbled into a somersault over her.
Innovindil couldn't get back to her feet in time, though, and had to block the
sword strike from the next incoming brute from one knee. The orc pressed in
harder, chopping viciously at her from varying angles with the sword. The elf
had to work her blade frantically to deflect each strike.
She gave a shout as another form rushed past her, and it took her a long
moment to even realize that it was Drizzt Do'Urden, and another moment to
take a measure of the orc that had been pressing her. It was back a few steps
suddenly, holding its sword in trembling fingers. As Innovindil watched, red

lines of blood thickened on its face and neck.
"They were in wait for us!" Drizzt called to her, rushing past her again,
moving behind her to meet the orc she had tripped up as it stood straight.
The orc thrust its spear at his new foe, and hit nothing but air. The
perfectly-balanced, quick-moving drow easily slid back and to the side. Then
Drizzt came ahead behind that stab, faster than the orc could begin to expect.
The orc had never battled the likes of Drizzt Do'Urden before, nor had it ever
seen a drow move in battle, let alone a drow wearing enchanted anklets that
magically enhanced his foot-speed.
Rolling scimitars descended over the helpless creature, slashing line after
line across its face and chest. It dropped its spear and tucked its arms in tight,
trying somehow to fend off the attacks, but the drow's fine blades methodically
continued their deadly work.
Drizzt had hit the retreating orc perhaps two dozen times, then he jumped
up and kicked the creature in the chest for good measure, and also to use that
movement to reverse his momentum and direction.
All thoughts of that orc flew from his mind as he turned around to see
Innovindil backing from the remaining four guards. Many, many more orcs
were closing ground left, right, and center across the field. Shouts from the
trees told Drizzt that the humanoids were behind him as well, and there were
louder shouts from not so far away.
"Get to Sunrise!" Innovindil shouted at Drizzt as he rushed up beside her,
contacting her right arm with his left. He offered her an assuring look. He had
seen Innovindil and Tarathiel fighting like that, and he and the elf had
practiced the technique over the past few days.
Innovindil's doubting expression betrayed her.
"We have no choice," Drizzt pointed out.
He rolled ahead of the elf to meet the charge of the nearest orc. His scimi-
tars worked furiously, batting at the creature's weapon, then cutting below its
attempted parry, but at a shortened angle that could not reach the orc. The
orc didn't realize that, however, as the drow spun past. In fact, the orc never
began to understand the drow's intent, never began to recognize that the drow
had worked his routine and sidelong retreat for no better reason that to set the
orc up for the elf who was rolling in behind.
All the orc ever figured out was that an elven sword through the ribs hurt.
Already engaged with another orc, Drizzt hardly noted the grunt and fall of
the first. He held complete confidence in Innovindil, though, and understood
that if there was a weak link in the fighting chain that he and the elf had
become, it was he. And so Drizzt fought with even more ferocity, scimitars
working in a blur, batting away weapons and forcing awkward dodges, setting
up the victims for Innovindil as she came in fast and hard behind him just as
he was fast in behind her, going with all speed at those orcs Innovindil had left
vulnerable for him.
Across the field the dancing duo went, moving in tight circles, rolling one
upon the other and inexorably toward the trapped pegasus. But with every
turn, every different angle coming clearly into his view, Drizzt understood that
they would not rescue Sunrise that day. They had underestimated their
enemy, had taken the scene of the pegasus grazing beside its handlers at
face value.
Three more orcs were down. A fourth fell to Drizzt's double slash, a fifth to

Innovindil's fast turn and stab at a creature that was still watching Drizzt
turning aside.
When he came around the next time, Drizzt went down to his knees,
avoiding an awkward cut from an orc sword. Rather than seizing the oppor-
tunity to strike at that overbalanced orc, the drow used the moment of respite
to bring forth his onyx figurine. Guenhwyvar had not been gone from his side
for long enough, he knew, but he had no choice and so he summoned the
panther from her Astral home.
He went back to his feet immediately, blades working furiously to regain the
edge against increasingly organized attacks. Behind him and Innovindil as
they turned on their way, a gray mist began to take shape and solidify.
One orc noted that distinctive feline shape and slashed at the mist, its
sword crossing through without finding a hold. The frustrated orc growled and
reversed its cut, but the mist became more corporeal and a powerful cat's paw
batted the sword aside before it could gain any momentum. Back legs
twitching easily, the panther flew into the orc's face, laying it low, and a quick
rake left the brute howling and squirming on the field while mighty
Guenhwyvar sprang away to find her next victim.
Even the panther would not be nearly enough, though, Drizzt knew, as
many more orcs came into view, swarming the field from ...
"Every angle," he said to his companion. "No clear route."
"Every angle but one," Innovindil corrected, and gave a shrill whistle.
Drizzt nodded his understanding at once, and as Innovindil went for the thin
rope she kept hooked on her belt, the drow increased his tempo, fighting
furiously beside her, forcing the orcs to fall back. He called for his panther to
coordinate with him, to keep one flank clear while he assaulted the other.
Innovindil had a lasso up spinning hard a moment later, building momen-
tum. Then Sunset appeared in a powerful stoop, coming over the rocky ridge
from which Innovindil and Drizzt had first observed the captive Sunrise. The
pegasus came down in a rush—a giant-thrown boulder hummed in the air,
narrowly missing the equine beast—and leveled out fifteen feet above the
grass, soaring past the surprised orcs too quickly for their clumsily thrown
spears to catch up.
The well-trained pegasus lowered her head as she crossed above Inno-
vindil, who launched her lasso perfectly, then held on, hooking her foot into a
loop at the bottom of the twenty-foot length of rope. The pegasus immediately
turned upward as she soared along, dragging the elf.
Innovindil took a stinging hit as she barreled through the nearest orcs, for
one spear was angled just right to slice her hip. Fortunately for the elf, though,
that was the only weapon that came to bear as she crashed among the
scrambling brutes. Then she was up above them, spinning along as Sunset's
mighty wings beat furiously to gain speed and height.
Dazed from slamming against so many, and with her hip bleeding, Inno-
vindil kept the presence of mind to hold fast and begin her climb.
Drizzt was too engaged to follow her movements, and he winced more than
once as more boulders cut the air above him. Rage propelling him, the drow
went into a sudden charge, bursting through the orc ranks and finally getting
beside Sunrise.
The pegasus's front hooves were firmly staked. There was no way Drizzt
was going to easily free him. And no way for him to get away, it seemed, for

the orcs had him fully ringed, shoulder to shoulder in an unbroken line. From
somewhere behind those ranks, the drow heard Guenhwyvar cry out in pain,
a call so plaintive that he quickly dismissed the panther.
He scrambled across the area around Sunrise, charging for the orc ranks,
then reversing direction to come back to the pegasus. It all seemed too eerily
familiar to him, even more so when the orcs began to chant, "Obould! Obould!
Obould!"
The drow remembered Tarathiel's last fight, remembered the brutish
warrior who had slain his elf friend. He had vowed to avenge that death. But
he knew beyond all doubt that it was not the time nor the place. He saw the
orcs parting at one point and caught a glimpse of the bone-white helm of his
adversary.
Drizzt's knuckles whitened with eagerness as he clenched his scimitars.
How he longed to put those fine blades to use on the skull of King Obould
Many-Arrows!
But there were shamans among the orc ranks, he noted—if he gained
advantage on Obould, could he hope to inflict a mortal wound that would not
be quickly healed? If he drove the orc king back to disadvantage, would not
the orc horde fall over him?
He didn't want to look up and tip his hand for his one hope, but his lavender
eyes did glance upward more than once. He noted Innovindil, like a kite string
as she and Sunset disappeared behind some trees, and knew beyond doubt
that when he saw her again, she would be astride the pegasus.
The bone white helmet bobbed behind the front ranks, closer, and the
volume and tempo of the chanting steadily increased.
Drizzt snapped his head around, as if nervously, but really so that he could
cover another quick glance upward.
He caught the movement, the shadow. Again he tightened his hands on his
scimitars, wanting nothing more than to sink one of those fine blades deep
into Obould's chest.
He turned suddenly and leaped upon Sunrise's strong back, and the pega-
sus bristled and tried to stamp and turn.
"Will you kill me, Obould?" the drow cried as he stood tall upon the
pegasus's back, and from that vantage point, he could see the orc king's head
and upper body clearly, the bone helmet with its elongated eyes, the last
vestiges of daylight glinting off the translucent lenses. He saw the orc's
magnificent black armor, all ridged, and that amazing greatsword, which
Drizzt knew the orc king could cause to burst into flame with but a thought.
He saw the foe and Drizzt had to wonder if he could hope to beat Obould
even in a different circumstance, even if he and the brute faced each other on
neutral ground and without allies to be found.
"Are you mighty enough to defeat me, Obould?" he called in defiance
anyway, for he knew that he had to make himself the focus, had to keep all
eyes upon him and had to convince the orc king not to order its orcs to simply
swarm him. "Come along, then," the drow boasted, and he flipped one of his
scimitars in the air, deftly catching it by the hilt as it came around. "Long have
I desired to see my blades stained red with your flowing blood!"
The last ranks of orcs parted then, leaving the line between Drizzt and
Obould clear, and the drow had to consciously force himself to draw breath
and to hold steady on his high perch. For the sheer presence of Obould

assaulted him, the weight and balance of the creature, the solidity of form and
the easy manner with which the king slowly moved his heavy sword with only
one hand as if it was as light as an elven walking stick.
"I need you, Sunrise," the drow muttered quietly. "Lift me high, I beg, that I
might find my way back to you."
A quick glance skyward showed Drizzt the return and dive of Innovindil and
Sunset, but coming in much higher, the fine rope flowing below.
"Not now, Obould!" Drizzt screamed, startling many orcs, and he quick-
stepped back to Sunrise's broad rump and kicked the pegasus.
Sunrise bucked on cue and Drizzt sprang away, using the lift to launch him
high into the air. He snapped his scimitars away as he rose, twisting and
turning to line himself up with the approaching rope.
"Another time, Obould!" he cried as he caught the rope with one hand
some twenty feet from the ground. "You and I, another time!"
The orc king roared and his minions launched spears, stones, and axes up
into the air.
But again they could not properly lead the swift-moving target, and Drizzt
secured his hold, the wind snapping in his ears.
From his high vantage point he saw the giants, as did Innovindil and
Sunset, obviously, for the pegasus veered as the boulders came sailing out.
They climbed higher into the fast-darkening sky, and avoided the barrage
enough to get up over the ridge and to safety, both Drizzt and his elf
companion having gained new respect for their cunning adversary.
*
*
*
*
*
Down on the field, Obould watched them disappear with as much amuse-
ment as disappointment.
Another time, indeed, he knew, and he was not the least bit afraid.
Around him, the orcs cheered and hooted.
Before him, Sunrise continued to buck and to whinny, and the pegasus's
handlers moved in fast, whips in hand to control the beast.
Obould roared at them to steal their momentum.
"With ease and soft hands!" he demanded.
*
*
*
*
*
The next day, barely after the sun had cleared the eastern horizon, those
handlers came to Obould.
"The beast was not hurt, god-king," the lead handler assured him. "The
beast is ready to be ridden."
With Tsinka Shinriil on his arm, nibbling at his ear, Obould grinned widely at
the handler.
"And if the beast throws me again, I will cut off your head," he promised,
and Tsinka snickered.
The handler paled and shrank back.
Obould let him squirm uncomfortably for a few moments. The orc king had
no intention of going to the captured pegasus that day, or ever again. He
knew that he could never ride the beast safely, and knew, too, that he would
never again be able to use the pegasus to lure his enemies in close. In short,
the winged horse had outlived its usefulness to him—almost.
It occurred to the orc king that there might be one last service the captured
pegasus could perform.

AS GRUUMSH WILLS
"They won't come on, I tell ye, for them trolls in the south've run off," said
Cordio, who was fast being recognized as one of Mithral Hall's leading priests,
and leading voices in their difficult struggle.
"Moradin tell ye that, did he?" Bruenor came right back.
"Bah! Got nothing to do with that," Cordio answered. "I'm using me own
thinking here, and not needin' more'n that. Why'd them trolls back out o' the
tunnels if them orcs're meaning to press in? Even orcs ain't that stupid. And
this one, Obould, been showing himself smarter than most."
Bruenor looked from the priest to Cordio's patient, Banak Brawnanvil, still
unable to walk or even stand after taking an orc spear in the back on his
retreat from the ridge north of Keeper's Dale.
"I ain't so sure," the wise old warrior dwarf answered. "Trolls could come
back at any time, of course, and ye're guessing that Obould even knows them
trolls've left. We got no eyes out there, King Bruenor, and without them eyes, I
ain't for putting the safety o' Mithral Hall on a guess."
Bruenor scratched his hairy head and tugged on his red beard. His gray
eyes went from Banak to Cordio, then back to Banak.
"He's coming in," Bruenor decided. "Obould's not to let this stand. He took
Felbarr once, and he's wanting nothing more than to do it again. And he's
knowing that he ain't to get there unless he comes through Mithral Hall.
Sooner or later, he's coming in."
"I'm guessing sooner," said Banak, and he and Bruenor both turned to
Cordio.
The dwarf priest held up his hands in surrender. "I'll argue all the day long
on how ye might be bandaging a wound, but ye're the warcommanders.
Cordio's just one to clean up after yer messes."
"Well, let's make this mess one for Obould's shamans to clean," said
Bruenor.
"The boys're already making them top halls ready for defense," Banak
assured him.
"I got an idea of how we might give Obould's shamans some extra work,"
the dwarf king remarked, heading for the corridor. He pulled Banak's door
open wide, then looked back, grinning. "All the clan's owing to ye, Banak
Brawnanvil. Them boys from Mirabar're thinking yerself to be a demigod."
Banak stared at his king stoically, though a bit of moisture was indeed
beginning to glisten at the corners of his dark eyes.
Bruenor kept staring hard at the wounded warcommander. He reached
down and snapped open his thick belt, and with one quick motion, pulled it off.
He wrapped the leather around his hand locking the buckle, a thick, carved
mithral clasp adorned with the foaming mug standard of the clan, across his
knuckle. Still looking Banak in the eye, Bruenor grabbed and secured the door
with his free hand then hit it with a solid left cross. He pulled the door open a
bit wider, so that Banak and Cordio could see his work: the indent of the
Battlehammer foaming mug.
"We're gonna fill that with silver and gold," Bruenor promised, which was
the highest honor a king of Mithral Hall could bestow upon any of his subjects.
With that, Bruenor nodded and left, closing the door behind him.

"I'm thinking that yer king's a bit fond of ye, Banak Brawnanvil," said
Cordio.
Banak slumped back, resting flat on his back. "Or he's thinking I'm all done
for."
"Bah!"
"Ye get me fixed then, ye durned fool," Banak demanded.
Cordio exhaled and took a long pause, then muttered, "By Moradin's
blessing," under his breath.
And truly the priest hoped that Moradin was paying attention and would
grant him the power to alleviate some of Banak's paralysis, at least. A dwarf
as honored and respected as Banak should not be made to suffer such
indignity.

Obould stood up high on the rocky bluff, overlooking the work. Orcs
scrambled all around Keeper's Dale, sharpening weapons and practicing tight
and fast strike formation, but the majority of the important work was being
done not by orcs, but by Gerti's giants. Obould watched a procession of more
than a dozen behemoths enter the western end of the dale, dragging a huge
log with ropes as thick as an orc's chest. Other giants worked on the stone
wall around the closed western doors, tossing aside debris and checking the
strength of the mountain above the portal. Still other giants tied off and
hammered logs on tall towers set on either side of the doors, and a third that
rose up a hundred feet, which was located straight back from the iron-bound
western gates of Clan Battlehammer's hall.
Obould scanned higher up on the mountain above the doors, at his many
scouts scrambling over the stones. Foremost in his mind was the element of
surprise. He didn't want any dwarf eyes peering out at the preparations in the
dale. Tsinka and the other shamans had assured him that the dwarves would
never expect the assault. The bearded folk were tied up in the south with
Proffit's trolls, they presumed, and like those dwarves in Citadel Felbarr years
before, they held too much confidence in the strength of their iron portals.
The orc king moved down the rocky slope, seeing Gerti standing among
some of her giantkin, poring over parchments spread on a tall wooden table.
The giantess looked from the parchments to the work on the towers and the
huge log sliding across the stone floor of the dale, and grinned. The giant
beside her pointed down to the parchment, nodding.
They were good at this, Obould knew, and he gained confidence with every
stride.
"Mighty doors," he said to Gerti as he approached.
Gerti shot him a look that seemed somewhere between incredulity and
disgust. "Anything a dwarf can build, a giant can knock down," she replied.
"So we shall soon see," the orc king responded with a low and respectful
bow. He moved closer and those giants near to Gerti stepped aside, granting
them some privacy.
"How far into Mithral Hall will your giants travel?" Obould asked her.
"Into Mithral Hall?" came her scoffing reply. "We are not built for dirty,
cramped dwarven tunnels, Obould."
"The ceiling of the entry hall is high, by all that I have heard."
"I told you that we would knock down the door, and so we shall. Once the
portal falls, let your orcs run into the killing chambers of King Bruenor."

"The treasures of Mithral Hall are considerable, so it is said," Obould
teased.
"Treasures that I have already earned."
Obould bowed again, not as low, and not as respectfully. "Your giants will
be of great help to my warriors in that entry hall," he said. "Help us to secure
our foothold. From there, my warriors will spread like thick smoke throughout
the tunnels, routing the dwarves."
Gerti's sly smile showed that she wasn't so sure of that.
"Then you and your kin can go to the Surbrin, as we agreed," said Obould.
"I will go to the Surbrin as I determine," Gerti retorted. "Or I will not. Or I will
go back to Shining White, or to Silverymoon, if I feel so inclined to take the
city of Lady Alustriel. I am bound by no agreements to Obould."
"We are not enemies, Dame Orelsdottr."
"Keep it that way, for your own sake."
Obould's red-streaked yellow eyes narrowed for just an instant, tipping off
the giantess to the simmering rage within him.
"I wish for your giants to accompany the lead ranks through the entry hall,"
said Obould.
"Of course you do. You have no warriors who can approach their strength
and skill."
"I do not ask this without recompense."
"You offer me the treasures of Mithral Hall?" asked Gerti. "The head of King
Battlehammer, whom you already claimed dead?"
"The pegasus," Obould blurted, and for a brief moment, he saw a telltale
flash of intrigue in Gerti's blue eyes.
"What of it?"
"I am not so foolish as to try to ride the creature, for it is not an unthinking
beast, but a loyal friend to the elf I destroyed," Obould admitted. "I could eat it,
of course, but would not any horse do as well? But you believe it to be a
beautiful creature, do you not, Dame Orelsdottr? A fitting trophy for Shining
White?"
"If you have no use for it—"
"I did not say that," Obould interrupted.
"You play a dangerous game."
"I make an honest offer. Send your giants in beside my orcs to crush the
initial defenses of Mithral Hall. Once we have pushed the dwarves to the
tighter tunnels, then leave the hall to me and go your own way, to the Surbrin
or wherever you choose. And take with you the winged horse."
Gerti held a defiant pose, but the sparkle in her eyes betrayed her interest.
"You covet that creature," Obould said bluntly.
"Not as much as you believe."
"But your giants will charge into the hall beside my orcs."
"Only because they do so enjoy killing dwarves."
Obould bowed low once again and let it go at that. He didn't really care why
Gerti sent her forces in there, as long as she did.

"Hee hee hee."
Ivan couldn't help but smile at his brother's continuing glee. Pikel hopped
all about the upper western chambers of Mithral Hall, chasing behind Nan-
foodle mostly. King Bruenor had come to the pair immediately following his

discussion with Cordio and Banak. Convinced that the orcs would try to break
into the hall, Bruenor had commissioned the two unconventional characters,
the dwarf "doo-dad" as Pikel described himself, and the gnome alchemist, to
help in setting unconventional and unpleasant surprises for the invaders. Of
course, Nanfoodle had immediately set the best brewers of Mithral Hall to
work in concocting specific formulas of various volatile liquids. All of the rarest
and most expensive ingredients were even then being poured into vats and
beakers. On Bruenor's instructions, Nanfoodle's team was holding nothing
back.
Ivan followed behind the pair, carefully and gently carrying one such large
pail of a clear liquid. He tried very hard not to let the volatile fluid slosh about,
for in that pail was the same liquid that was held in a small vial in each of his
hand crossbow darts. "Oil of Impact," it was commonly called, an exotic potion
that exploded under the weight of concussion. Ivan's crossbow darts had
been designed to collapse in upon themselves on impact, compressing the
chamber and vial, and resulting in an explosion that would then drive the tip
through whatever barrier it had struck. Given the force of those explosions
using only a few drops of the oil of impact, the dwarf couldn't even begin to
guess what clever Nanfoodle had in mind for so much of the potent mix.
"Right there," Nanfoodle instructed a pair of other dwarves who had been
put in his charge. He pointed to a flat wall in the western entry chamber, to the
side of the doors that led into the main upper level corridors. He motioned for
Ivan to bring the pail up, which Ivan did, to the continuing "hee hee hee" of his
brother Pikel.
"Would you be so kind as to go and inquire of Candles how he fares in his
work?" Nanfoodle asked, referring to a thin, squint-eyed dwarf named
Bedhongee Waxfingers, nicknamed Candles because of his family's line of
work.
Ivan gently set the bucket on the floor before the wall and glanced back at
the other two helpers, both of who were carrying brushes. "Aye, I'll go," he
said, looking back at the gnome. "But only because I'm wanting to be far from
here when one o' them dolts kicks the bucket."
"Boom!" said Pikel.
"Yeah, boom, and ye're not knowing the half of it," Ivan added, and he
started away.
"What were the dimensions again?" Nanfoodle asked him before he had
taken two strides.
"For Candles? Two dwarves abreast and one atop another," Ivan replied,
which meant five feet wide and eight high.
He watched Nanfoodle motion to the pair with the brushes.
"Durned gnome," he muttered, and he left the chamber.
Barely in the hallway, he heard Nanfoodle lift his voice in explanation:
"Bomblets, Pikel. No big explosions in here, of course—not like what we did
outside."
"Boom!" Pikel replied.
Ivan closed his eyes and shook his head, then moved along more swiftly,
thinking it prudent to put as much ground between himself and Nanfoodle as
possible. Like most dwarves, Ivan applauded clever engines of war. The
Battlehammer sideslinger catapults and "juicer," a rolling cart designed to
flatten and crush opponents, were particularly impressive. But Nanfoodle's

work assaulted Ivan's pragmatic dwarven sensibilities. Outside, in the battle
for the ridge, the gnome had brought trapped subterranean gasses up under a
ridgeline held by frost giants, and had blown the entire mountain spur to
pieces.
It occurred to Ivan that while Nanfoodle's efforts might help secure Mithral
Hall, it was also quite possible that he would destroy the whole complex in the
process.
"Not yer business," the dwarf grumbled to himself. "Ye're the warrior, not
the warcommander."
He heard his brother laughing behind him. More often than not, Ivan knew
all too well, that laugh didn't lead to good things. Images of flames leaping a
thousand feet into the air and the rubble of a mountain ridge flying wide filled
his thoughts.
"Not the warcommander," he muttered again, shaking his head.

"Ye're doing great, Rumblebelly," Bruenor prompted.
Regis shifted at the unexpected sound, sending a small avalanche of soot
tumbling back on his friend, who was climbing the narrow chimney behind
him. Bruenor grumbled and coughed, but offered no overt griping.
"You're certain this will get us out?" Regis asked between his own coughs.
"Used it meself after ye all left me in here with the stinking duergar,"
Bruenor assured him. "And I didn't have the climbing tools, either! And carried
a bunch o' wounds upon me battle-weary body! And ..."
He rambled on with a string of complaints, and Regis just let them float by
him without landing. Somehow having Bruenor below him, ranting and raving,
brought the halfling quite a bit of comfort, a clear reminder that he was home.
But that didn't make the climb any easier, given Regis's still-aching arm. The
wolf that had bitten him had ground its teeth right into his bone, and even
though tendays had passed, and even though Cordio and Stumpet had cast
healing spells upon him, he was a battered halfling indeed.
He knew the honor Bruenor had placed upon him in asking him to lead the
way up the chimney, though, and he wasn't about to slow down. He let the
cadence of Bruenor's grumbling guide him and he reached up, hooked his
fingers on a jag in the rough stone and hauled himself up another foot. Over
and over, he repeated the process, not looking up for many minutes.
When he finally did tilt his head back, he saw at last the lighter glow of the
nighttime sky, not twenty feet above him.
Regis's smile faded almost immediately, though, as he considered that
there could be an orc guard out there, standing ready to plunge a spear down
atop his head. The halfling froze in place, and held there for a long while.
A finger flicked against the bottom of his foot, and Regis managed to look
down into Bruenor's eyes—shining whiter, it seemed, for the dwarf's face was
completely blackened by soot. Bruenor motioned emphatically for Regis to
continue up.
Regis gathered his nerve, his eyes slowly moving up to the starlight. Then,
with a burst of speed, he scrambled hand over hand, not letting himself slow
until he was within reach of the iron grate, one bar missing from Bruenor's
climb those years ago. With a determined grunt, his courage mounting as he
considered the feat of his dwarf friend in escaping the duergar, Regis moved
swiftly, not pausing until his upper half was right out of the chimney. He

paused there, half in and half out, and closed his eyes, waiting for the killing
blow to fall.
The only sound was the moan of the wind on the high mountain, and the
occasional scraping from Bruenor down below.
Regis pulled himself out and climbed to his knees, glancing all around.
An amazing view greeted him from up on the mountain called Fourth-peak.
The wind was freezing cold and snow clung to the ground all around him,
except in the immediate area around the chimney, where warm air continued
to pour forth from the heat of the great dwarven Undercity.
Regis rose to his feet, his eyes transfixed on the panoramic view around
him. He looked to the west, to Keeper's Dale, and the thousands of campfires
of Obould's great army. He turned around and considered the eastern
stretches below him, the dark snaking line of the great River Surbrin and the
line of fires on its western bank.
"By Moradin, Rumblebelly," Bruenor muttered when he finally got out of the
hole and stood up to survey the magnitude of the scene, of the campfires of
the forces arrayed against the goodly folk of the Silver Marches. "Not in all me
days have I seen such a mob of foes."
"Is there any hope?" Regis asked.
"Bah!" snorted the toughened old king. "Orcs're all! Ten to one, me
dwarves'll kill 'em."
"Might need more than that," the halfling said, but wisely under his breath
so that his friend could not hear.
"Well, if they come, they're coming from the west," Bruenor observed, for
that was obviously the region of the most densely packed opposition.
Regis moved up beside him, and stayed silent. They had an hour to go
before the first light of dawn. They couldn't really go far, for they needed the
warmth of the chimney air to help ward the brutal cold—they hadn't worn too
many layers of clothes for their tight climb, after all.
So they waited, side by side and patiently. They each knew the stakes, and
the bite of the wind was a small price to pay.
But the howls began soon after, a lone wolf, at first, but then answered
again and again all around the pair.
"We have to go," Regis said after a long while, a chorus of howls growing
closer by the second.
Bruenor seemed as if made of stone. He did move enough to glance back
to the east.
"Come on, then," the dwarf prodded, speaking to the sky, calling for the
dawn's light.
"Bruenor, they're getting close."
"Get yerself in the hole," the dwarf ordered.
Regis tugged his arm, but he did not move.
"You don't even have your axe."
"I'll get in behind ye, don't ye doubt, but I'm wanting a look at Obould's army
in the daylight."
A howl split the air, so close that Regis imagined the wolf's hot breath on
his neck. His arm ached from memory alone, and he had no desire to face the
gleaming white fangs of a wolf ever again. He tugged more insistently on
Bruenor's arm, and when the dwarf half-turned, as if moving toward the
chimney, the halfling scrambled belly down to the ground and over the lip.

"Go on, then," Bruenor prompted, and he turned and squinted again to the
west.
The air had grown a bit lighter, but Bruenor could still make out very little in
the dark vale. He strained his eyes and prayed to Moradin, and eventually
made out what looked like two great obelisks.
The dwarf scratched his head. Were the orcs building statues? Watch
towers?
Bruenor heard the padded footsteps of a canine creature not far away, and
still staring down into the dale, he bent low, scooped up a loose stone, and
pegged it in the general direction of the noise.
"Go on, then, ye stupid puppy. Dog meat ain't to me liking, to yer own
good!"
"Bruenor!" came Regis's cry from the chimney. "What are you doing?"
"I ain't running from a few skinny wolves, to be sure!"
"Bruenor. . .."
"Bah!" the dwarf snorted. He kicked at the snow, then turned around and
started for the chimney, to Regis's obvious relief. The dwarf paused and
looked back one more time, though, concentrating on the tall, dark shapes.
"Towers," he muttered, and shook his hairy head. He hopped into the hole,
catching the remainder of the grate to break his fall.
And it hit him.
"Towers?" he said. He lifted himself up and glanced to the side at a
movement, to see the glowing eyes of a wolf not ten strides away. "O, ye
clever pig-face!"
Bruenor dropped from sight.
He prodded Regis to hurry along all the way down the chimney, realizing
then that his precious Mithral Hall was in more danger than he had imagined.
He had wondered whether Obould would try to come in through lower tunnels,
or perhaps make one of his own, or whether he would try to crash through the
great iron doors.
"Towers...." he muttered all the way down, for now he knew.

The next morning, a tree appeared atop the mountain called Fourthpeak,
except that it wasn't really a tree, but a dwarf disguised as a tree by the
druidic magic of the strange Pikel Bouldershoulder. A second tree appeared
soon after, farther down the mountain slope to the west, and a third in line
after that. The line of "new growth" stretched down, dwarf after dwarf, until the
leading tree had a clear vantage point of the goings-on in Keeper's Dale.
When reports began filtering back to Mithral Hall about the near-readiness
of the giant towers and the ghastly, ram-headed battering pole that would be
suspended and swung between those obelisks, the work inside the hall
moved up to a frenetic pace.
There were two balconies lining the large, oval entry hall of the western
reaches of the dwarven complex. Both had crawl tunnels connecting them
back to corridors deeper within the complex, and both provided fine kill areas
for archers and hammer-throwers. On the westernmost side of one of these
balconies, the dwarves constructed a secret chamber, large enough to hold a
single dwarf. From out its top, they ran some of the same metal pipes that
Nanfoodle had used to bring the hot air up on the northern ridgeline, securing
them tight against the ceiling and carrying the line out to the center of the

large oval chamber. A heavy rope was then threaded through the piping,
secured on a crank within the small secret chamber and dangling out the
other end of the pipe, nearly to the floor, some thirty to forty feet below.
All across the reaches of that chamber, the dwarves built defensive posi-
tions, low walls over which they could fend off attackers, and which afforded
them a continual line of retreat back into the main corridor in the east. They
coordinated those junctures in the many walls with drop-points along the
ledge above. Under the watchful eye of none other than Banak Brawnanvil,
the teams practiced their timing continually, for those below knew that their
brethren above would likely be their only chance of getting out of the chamber
alive. To further hinder their enemies, the industrious Battlehammer gang
placed hundreds of caltrops just inside the great doors, some fashioned
purposely and many others nothing more than sharp pieces of scrap metal—
waste brought up from the forges of the Undercity.
Outside that expected battlefield, the work was no less intense. Forges
glowed, great spoons in brew barrels constantly stirred, sharpening stones
whirred, smithy hammers pounded away, and the many pottery wheels spun
and spun and spun.
The crowning moment came late one afternoon, when a procession of
dwarves carried a large, layered circular bowl into the chamber. More than
fifteen feet across, the contraption was all of beaten metal, layered in fans and
hooked together on a center pole that rose up just a couple of feet and ended
in a sturdy eyelet. Through this, the dwarves tied off the dangling rope.
Nanfoodle nervously checked the trip-spring mechanism on the center pole
several times. The tension had to be just right—not so loose that the weight of
the bowl's contents could spring it, and not so tight that the drop wouldn't
trigger it. He and Ivan Bouldershoulder had done the calculations more than a
dozen times, and their confidence had been high.
Had been.
In looking around at all the curious dwarves, Nanfoodle realized just how
much was at stake, and the thought had his little knees clicking together.
"It'll work," Ivan promised him, the dwarf bending in low and whispering in
his ear. He gently took Nanfoodle's shoulder and ushered the gnome back,
then motioned to the helpers who had come in behind the pair, gently pushing
a wide cart full of ceramic balls.
The dwarves began placing the delicate orbs inside the bowl of the
contraption, along set ridges, all of which ended with a curled lip of varying
angles.
When that work was done, the dwarves up above shoved a long handle
into the crank in the secret cubby and began lifting the contraption from the
floor, drawing the rope slowly and evenly. Other dwarves climbed ladders
beside the bowl as it rose, slowly rotating it through its climb.
"Get a ladder and smooth the edges," Ivan ordered as the whole disk was
locked into place up near the ceiling, for though the bottom of the bowl had
been painted to make it look like the stone of the ceiling, once it was in place,
he could see where improvements might be made.
"It'll work," the yellow-bearded Bouldershoulder said again to Nanfoodle,
who was staring up nervously.
The gnome looked to Ivan and managed a meager smile.

Up on the ledge, Bruenor, Regis, Catti-brie, and Wulfgar watched the work
with a mixture of hope and sheer terror. The two humans had already
witnessed one of Nanfoodle's surprises, and both figured that one incident
had made enough of an impression to foster grandiose stories for a lifetime.
"I'm not for liking yer choice," Bruenor said to Regis. "But I'm respecting yer
decision, and respecting yerself more and more, little one."
"I'm not for liking my choice, either," Regis admitted. "But I'm no warrior,
and this is my way of helping."
"And how are you to get out of there if we don't retake the hall?" Catti-brie
asked.
"Would that question be any different if a dwarf was accepting the duty?"
the halfling shot right back.
Catti-brie thought on that for a moment, then just said, "Maybe we can
catch an orc and trick it into pulling the pin."
"Yeah, that'd work," Bruenor said. Beneath his sarcastic quip, the other
three caught the slightest of quivering in his voice, a clear sign that he, like the
others, realized that this might be the last time they saw their halfling friend.
But then, if they failed in this, they would all likely die.
"I'm wanting you two up on the other ledge," Bruenor said to his two human
children. "Right near the escape corridor."
"I was thinking to fight on the floor," Wulfgar argued.
"The walls're too short for ye, and what a fine target ye'll be making for our
enemies, standing twice a dwarf's height down there," Bruenor answered.
"No, ye fight on the ledge, the two o' ye together, for that's when ye're at yer
best. Hold all yer shots, bow and hammer, for any giants, should they come
in, and keep yerselves at the escape tunnel."
"So that we might be the first to leave?" Catti-brie asked.
"Aye," the dwarf admitted. "First out and not bottlenecking the low crawl for
me kin."
"If that's the reasoning, then shouldn't we be last?" Wulfgar asked, tossing
a wink at Catti-brie as he did.
"No, ye go first and ye go early, and that's the end of it," said Bruenor. "Ye
got to be near the tunnel, as ye'll both be needing that tunnel to fall back from
sight, for ye can't get as low as me boys that'll be up there with ye. Now stop
yer arguing with me and start sorting out yer tactics."
The dwarf turned to Regis and asked, "Ye got enough food and water?"
"Does he ever?" Catti-brie asked.
Regis grinned widely, his dimpled cheeks climbing high. He patted his
bulging backpack.
"Should be today," Bruenor told him. "But ye might have a bit of a wait."
"I will be fine, and I will be ready."
"Ye know the signal?"
The halfling nodded.
Bruenor patted him on the shoulder and moved away, and with a grin and
helpless shrug to his friend, Regis moved inside the secret cubby, pulled the
stone-shaped door closed and bolted it on the inside. A pair of dwarves
moved right up to the closed portal and began working its edges with mud and
small stones, sealing the portal and also blending it in to the surrounding wall
so perfectly that a trained elf thief would have a hard time spotting the door if
he'd been told exactly where to find it.

"And you'll be on the floor, of course?" Catti-brie asked Bruenor.
"Right in the middle of the line's me place." He noted Catti-brie's scowl and
added, "Ye might want to dip yer bow every now and then to clear the way if
ye see that I'm attracting a bit too much orc attention."
That brought a light to the woman's face, a clear reminder that whether up
on the ledge or down on the floor, they were in it together.

"We're gonna make 'em pay for every inch o' ground," Bruenor told his
charges when word came down the chimneys that the towers were completed
in Keeper's Dale, and that great lengths of rope were being strung. It took
quite a while for that word to run up the dwarven "tree" line, down the chimney
to the Undercity, then back up the corridors to the entry hall, though, and so
the words had just left Bruenor's mouth when the first thunderous smash hit
the great iron doors. All the chambers shook under the tremendous weight of
that blow, and more than one dwarf staggered.
Those closest to the doors immediately moved to inspect the damage, and
with just that one blow, cracks appeared in the stone supporting the massive
portals.
"Won't take many," the lead engineer closest the doors called.
He and his group moved back fast, expecting the second report—which
shook the chamber even more. The doors cracked open under the great
weight. More than one set of eyes went up nervously to the ceiling and the
delicate bowl contraption.
"It'll hold," Bruenor shouted from the front rank in the center of the dwarven
line, directly across the hall from the doors. "Don't ye be looking up! Our
enemies're coming in through the doors in the next hit or two.
"Girl!" he called up to Catti-brie. "Ye set yer sights on that center line in the
doors and if it opens and an ugly orc puts its ugly face against it, ye take it
down hard! All of ye!"
The great ram swung in again, slamming the iron, and the doors creaked in
some more, leaving a crack wide enough to admit an orc, if not a giant. Just
as Bruenor had predicted, enemies did come against the portals, hooting,
shouting, and pressing. One started through, then began to jerk in place as a
barrage of arrows and crossbow bolts met it.
The orcs behind the unfortunate point pushed it in and to the floor, and
hungrily crowded against the open slot.
More arrows and bolts met them, including a silver-streaking arrow that
sliced right through the closest creature and several behind it, lessening the
press for a moment.
Then the ram hit again, and the right-hand door busted off its giant top
hinge and rolled inward, creaking and groaning as the metal of the bottom
hinge twisted. Chunks of stone fell from above, smashing the first ranks of
orcs, but hardly slowing the flood that followed.
The orcs poured in, and the dwarves howled and set themselves against
the charge. The broken door twisted and settled back the other way, crashing
down upon many of the unfortunate orcs and somewhat slowing the charge.
Missiles rained down from on high. A heavy warhammer went spinning
among the throng, splitting the skull of one orc. As the charge neared the first
of the newly-constructed low walls, dwarves sprang up from behind it, all of
them leveling crossbows and blasting the closest rank of enemies. Bows fell

aside, the dwarves taking up long spears and leveling them at the charging
throng. Those orcs in front, pressed by the rolling wave behind, couldn't hope
to slow or turn aside.
As one, Banak's well-drilled team let go of their spears and took up their
close-combat weapons. Sword, axe, and hammer chopped away wildly as the
orc wave came on. From above, a concentrated volley devastated the second
rank of enemies, allowing the dwarves a chance to retreat back beyond the
second wall.
The scene would repeat itself in ten-foot sections, wall to wall, all the way
back to Bruenor's position.
"Wulfgar! Girl!" Bruenor cried when a larger form appeared in the broken
doorway. Even as he spoke, a magical arrow from Catti-brie's Taulmaril
zipped out for the hulking giant form, followed closely by a spinning
warhammer.
The orcs made the second wall, where many more died.
But the monstrous wave rolled on.
*
*

Regis curled up and blocked his ears against the screaming and shouting
that reverberated across the stones. He had seen many battles—far too
many, by his estimation—and he knew well the terrible sounds. And it always
sounded the same. From the street fights in Calimport to the wild battles he
had seen in Icewind Dale, both against the barbarians of the tundra and the
goblinkin, to the battles to retake and hold onto the coveted mines of Mithral
Hall, Regis had been assailed by those same sounds over and over again. It
didn't matter if the wails came from orcs or dwarves or even from giants. As
one, they split the air, carrying waves of agony on their shrill notes.
The halfling was glad to be in his sealed compartment where he did not
have to witness the flowing blood and torn bodies. He took faith that his role
was an important one for the success of the dwarves' plan, that he was
contributing in a great way.
For the time being, though, he wanted to put all those thoughts out of his
head, wanted to put everything out of his mind and just lay in the near-
absolute blackness of the sealed cubby. He closed his eyes and blocked his
ears, and wished that it was all far, far away.
*
*
*
*

"Giant!" Wulfgar said to Catti-brie, who was kneeling on the balcony beside
him. As he spoke, the huge form crossed over the lighter area of the fallen
door and into the chamber, spurring orcs on before it. With a roar to his god of
war, Wulfgar brought his warhammer up over his shoulder, then rolled his
arms around to straighten them, putting the hammer directly in line behind his
back.
"Tempus!" he cried again, and he leaned his tall frame back, then began a
rolling movement that seemed to start as his knees, his back arcing and
swaying forward, huge shoulders snapping ahead as his arms came up over
his head, launching mighty Aegis-fang into an end-over-end flight across the
room.
Catti-brie targeted quickly upon Wulfgar's call and let fly, her arrow easily
outdistancing the warhammer to strike the giant first, right in the upper arm.
The behemoth cried out and straightened, squaring up to the pair on the ledge
right as the warhammer slammed in, taking it squarely in the face with a

tremendous slapping sound.
The giant staggered. Another arrow hit it in the torso, then a third, and
Wulfgar, the enchanted warhammer magically returned to his grasp, yelled
out for Tempus again and launched the missile.
The giant turned and stumbled back toward the door.
The hammer pounded in right against its bending back, launching it forward
and to the floor, where it crushed an unfortunate orc beneath its tumbling bulk.
"More of 'em," Catti-brie remarked as another, then another huge form
crossed the leaning door.
"Just keep a line of arrows then," Wulfgar offered, and again his hammer
appeared magically in his grasp. He started to take aim at one of the new
adversaries, but then saw the wounded giant stubbornly trying to rise again.
Wulfgar adjusted his angle, roared to his war god, and let fly. The hammer hit
the giant right on the back of the skull as it tried to rise, with a crack that
sounded like splitting stone. The behemoth went down fast and hard and lay
very still.
Two other giants were in the foyer, though, the lead one accepting a hit
from Catti-brie's devastating bow, and dodging fast as a second arrow sped
by, the enchanted missile slicing right into the stone wall. Another behemoth
appeared at the doorway and held there, and a moment later, the
bombardiers on the balcony understood the tactic. For that giant turned fast
and tossed something to the farthest one in the hall, who caught it and
swiveled about, tossing it to the leading brute.
Another arrow from Catti-brie stung that behemoth but did not drop it, and
when it turned around to face the ledge, its arms went up high, holding a huge
boulder, and it let fly.
"Run away!" cried the dwarf to Wulfgar's left, and he grabbed the barbarian
by the belt and tugged him aside.
Wulfgar twisted, off-balance, and tumbled to the balcony behind the dwarf.
Only as he landed hard and managed to glance back did Wulfgar come to
realize that the dwarf had saved his life. The giant-thrown boulder smashed
hard against the front of the balcony and skipped upward, slamming into the
wall at the side of the exit tunnel.
It rebounded from there back to the balcony, and Wulfgar could only look
on in horror as it crushed down upon his dear friend.
*
*
*
*

"Clear the hall!" came a voice above the tumult of battle, the voice of
Bruenor Battlehammer who centered the line of dwarves on the floor,
ushering his retreating kin out. "Give us time, archers!"
"Special arrows!" cried dwarves all along both balconies.
As one the crossbowmen reached for their best quarrels, tipped with a
metal that burned like a flaring star when touched to flame. Torchbearers ran
the length of the archer lines, while cries went out to concentrate the killing
area.
Flaring quarrel after quarrel soared down to the center rear of the entry hall,
to the region just before the unmoving Bruenor Battlehammer and his elite
warriors, the Gutbuster Brigade, as they held the last line of retreat.
"Now go!" Bruenor cried as the orc ranks shook apart under the glare of the
magnesium bolts and the shrieks of unbelievable agony from those who had
been struck.

"Block it!" Bruenor cried.
Up on the ledge above him, a dwarf tugged hard at Wulfgar, pulling him
away from the boulder that had fallen on Catti-brie.
"We need ye now!" the dwarf cried.
Wulfgar spun away, his blue eyes wet with tears. He was part of a team
who were supposed to definitively finish the retreat, one of four assigned to lift
the vat of molten metal and pour it down before the escape corridor, buying
the fleeing Bruenor and the Gutbusters some time.
Wulfgar, full of rage, changed that plan. He pushed the dwarves aside and
wrapped his arms around the vat, then hoisted it and quick-stepped to the
edge of the balcony, roaring with every step.
"He can't be doing that," one dwarf muttered.
But he was.
At the edge, the barbarian dropped the vat and tipped it, glowing molten
metal pouring down upon the orcs.
A boulder slammed the ledge right below him and the force of the blow
threw him aside, stumbling, as pieces of stone broke away below him.
With one last look back to Catti-brie, Wulfgar fell from the ledge, tumbling
right after the heavy metal vat.

8
GALEN'S STAND
General Dagna exhaled deeply, his whole body finally seeming to relax.
Good news at last, he thought, for one of his scouts had returned with word
that tunnels had been found leading straight and deep to the north, back to
Mithral Hall, in all likelihood.
For more than a tenday, Dagna, his forty remaining dwarves, and Galen
Firth and his human refugees had been moving fast across the muddy,
scraggly terrain, collecting remnants of the scattered folk of Nesme. They had
more than four hundred Nesmians in tow, but less than half were battle-
capable, and many were wounded.
Worse, their enemies had been dogging their every step, nipping at them in
scattered attacks. The skirmishes had diminished to nothing over the past
couple of days, but the nagging thought remained with Dagna that those fights
had not been so haphazard, that perhaps they were a coordinated effort
toward a larger goal. In fact, it occurred to Dagna, though he did not mention it
to Galen Firth, that the last couple of bands of refugees, mostly women,
children, and very old folk, had been left alone by the trolls purposely. The
apparently cunning trolls seemed to recognize that Dagna and Galen would
absorb the refugees, and that those less able would surely slow them all down
and drain their resources. Dagna recognized that he and his comrades were,
in effect, being herded. The wise old dwarf warcommander understood the
ways of battle enough to realize that time was working against him and his
impromptu army. Tough as the humans were showing themselves to be, and
determined as Galen Firth might be, Dagna believed in his heart that if they
couldn't find their way out of there, they would all soon be dead.
Finally on that cold and rainy day had come the welcomed news of a
potential escape route, and one through tunnels, where Dagna knew that he
and his boys could be much more effective in slowing the powerful trolls. He
found Galen Firth a short while later, and was surprised to see that the man
was as excited as he.
"Me scouts're back," Dagna said in greeting.
"As are my own," Galen replied with equal enthusiasm.
Dagna started to explain about the tunnel, thinking that perhaps Galen had
heard a similar tale, but the man wasn't listening, he realized, and indeed,
Galen soon began talking right over him.
"Our enemies are weak between here and Nesme," Galen explained. "A
thin line, with no support to be found anywhere around the town."
"The ruins of Nesme, ye mean," Dagna corrected.
"Not so ruined. Battered yes, but still defensible."
The dwarf paused for a moment and let those words digest. "Defensible?"
"Behind our walls, we are formidable, good dwarf."
"I'm not for doubting that, but are ye forgetting that yer enemy already
chased ye out from behind those walls once?"
"We weren't properly prepared for them."
"Yer forces were many times yer present number!"
"We can hold the town," Galen insisted. "Word has gone out to Everlund,
Mirabar, and Silverymoon. Surely help will soon arrive."
"To bury yer bones?" Dagna said, and Galen scowled at him. "Ye can't be

thinking to move closer to the Trollmoors with an army o' bog blokes and trolls
on yer heels."
"Army? The fighting has lessened since our escape from the trolls," Galen
argued. "We have reason to believe that many of our enemies have gone into
tunnels heading for Mithral Hall."
"Aye, tunnels to Mithral Hall," said Dagna. "Which is why I come to ye this
day. We found the way back, deep and quiet. We can make the tunnels afore
the morrow and be well on our way."
"Have you not listened to a word I've said?"
"Have ye yerself heared them words?" Dagna replied. "Ye're for walking
out from the protection o' the mountains onto open ground where yer enemies
can sweep upon ye. Ye're to get yer people slaughtered."
"I am to save Nesme."
"Nesme's gone!"
"And would you so quickly abandon Mithral Hall, General Dagna?"
"Mithral Hall's not gone."
It was Galen Firth's turn to pause and take a deep breath against the
unrelenting pragmatism of General Dagna. "I am of the Riders of Nesme," he
explained slowly and calmly, as if reciting a vow he had made many times
before. "My life has been given to the protection of the town, wholly so. We
see a way back to our homes. If we get back behind our city wall—"
"The damned trolls'll catch ye there and kill ye."
"Not if many have turned their eyes to the north, as we believe."
"And ye'd be willing to risk all yer kinfolk on that belief?"
"Help will come," Galen declared. "Nesme will rise again."
Dagna locked stares with the man. "Me and me boys're heading for the
tunnels and back to Mithral Hall. Ye're welcomed to join us—Steward Regis's
offered his hand. Ye'd be wise to take it."
"If we go home—to our homes, good dwarf!—will Mithral Hall not offer us
the support we need?"
"Ye're asking me to follow ye on a fool's errand!"
"I am asking you to stand beside your neighbors as they defend their
homes from a common enemy."
"You cannot be serious," came another voice, and both Dagna and Galen
Firth turned to see Rannek moving to join them. The young man's stride was
purposeful and determined. "We have a way to the north, underground where
our allies can better protect us."
"You would abandon Nesme?"
Rannek shook his head vigorously. "I would secure the wounded and those
who cannot fight, first and foremost. They are the cause of the Riders, not
empty buildings and walls that can be rebuilt."
"Rannek now determines the course of the Riders? Rannek the
watchman?"
Dagna watched the exchange carefully, and noted how the younger man
seemed to lose all momentum so suddenly.
"I speak for the Riders and I speak for all the folk of Nesme," Galen Firth
went on, turning back to the dwarf. "We see an opportunity to return to our
homes, and we shall seize it."
"A fool's errand," said Dagna.
"Can you say with certainty that these tunnels you have found will be any

less filled with enemies? Can you be so certain that they will even usher us to
Mithral Hall? Or might it be that we go underground, flee from the region, only
to have the armies of Mirabar, Silverymoon, and Everlund arrive? What then,
General Dagna? They will find no one to rescue and no town to help secure.
They will believe they are too late and turn for home."
"Or turn north to the bigger fight that's facing Clan Battlehammer."
"That would be your hope, wouldn't it?"
"Don't ye be talking stupid," Dagna warned. "We come all the way down
here, I put ten of me boys in the Halls o' Moradin, and all for yer own sake."
Galen Firth backed off just a bit, and even dipped the slightest of bows.
"We are not unappreciative of your help," he said. "But you must under-
stand that we are as loyal to our home as Clan Battlehammer is to Mithral
Hall. By all reports, the way is nearly clear. We can fight our way to Nesme
with little risk and it is unlikely that our enemies will be able to organize
against us anytime soon to try to expel us once more. By that time, help will
arrive."
The dwarf, hardly convinced, crossed his hairy arms over his chest, his
muscles tense and bulging around the heavy leather bracers adorning each
wrist.
"And what of the remaining refugees who are still out there?" Galen Firth
went on. "Would you have us abandon them? Shall we run and hide," he
asked, turning quickly to Rannek, "while our kin cower in the shadows with no
hope of finding sanctuary?"
"We do not know that more are out there," Rannek offered, though his
voice seemed less than sure.
"We know not if there are none," Galen Firth retorted. "Is my life worth that
chance? Is your own?" The fierce veteran turned back on Dagna. "It is,"
Galen answered his own question. "Come with us if you will, or run and
hide in Mithral Hall if that is your choice. Nesme is not yet lost, and I'll not see
her lost!"
With that, Galen turned and stormed away.
Dagna tightened the cross of his arms over his chest and stared at Galen
as he departed for a long while before finally turning back to Rannek.
"A fool's errand" he said. "Ye're not for knowing where them trolls're
hiding."
Rannek didn't offer any answers, but Dagna understood that the man knew
that it wasn't his place to answer. When Galen Firth declared that he spoke for
the folk of Nesme, he was speaking truthfully. Rannek had been given his
say, short though it had been, but it was settled.
The young warrior's expression revealed his doubts, but he offered only a
bow, then turned and followed Galen Firth, his commander.
A short while later, as twilight began its descent over the land, Dagna and
his forty dwarves stood high on the side of a hillock, watching the departing
march of Galen Firth and his four hundred Nesmians. Every bit of common
sense in the old dwarf told him to let them go and be done with it. Turn about
and head into the tunnels, he told himself over and over.
But he didn't give that command as the minutes passed and the black mass
of walking humans receded into the foggy shadows of the marshland north of
Nesme.
"I'm not for liking it," Dagna offered to those dwarves around him. "The

whole thing's not looking right to me."
"Ye might be thinking a bit too much favor on the cunning of trolls," a dwarf
near the old veteran remarked, and Dagna certainly didn't dismiss the
comment.
Was he giving the trolls too much credit? The patterns of the escape thus
far and the disposition of those refugees they had acquired had led him to
consider the trap he might be laying if he was the one chasing the fleeing
humans. But he was a dwarf, a veteran of many campaigns, and his enemies
were trolls, hulking, stupid, and never strong on tactics.
Maybe Galen Firth was right.
But still the doubts remained.
"Let's follow 'em just a bit, for me own peace o' mind," Dagna told his
fellows. "Put a scout left, put a scout right, and we'll all come up behind, but
not close enough so that the durned fool Galen can see us."
Several dwarves grumbled at that, but not loudly.
*

"They coming, little dwarfie," an ugly troll, gruesome even by troll stan-
dards, said to the battered dwarf who lay on the ground below it. "Just like
them drow elves said they would."
Another troll giggled, which sounded like a group of drunken dwarves
forcing spit up from their lungs, and the pair leaned in close against the
muddy bank, peering out through the scraggly brush that further camouflaged
their position.
Below them, one heavy foot on his chest, poor Fender Stouthammer could
hardly draw breath, let alone do anything to help. He wasn't gagged, but
couldn't make any sounds other than a wet wheeze, the result of the male
drow's clever work with his blade.
But neither could Fender just lie there. He had heard the drow telling the
trolls that they would soon have all the refugees and the stubborn dwarves in
their grasp. Fender had lain helpless throughout the last days watching those
two dark elves orchestrate the movements of the trolls and the bog blokes. A
clever pair, the dark elves had assured the biggest and ugliest of the trolls, a
two-headed monstrosity named Proffit, that the stupid humans would walk
right into their trap.
And there they were, not so far from the abandoned city of Nesme, cleverly
hidden in a long trench to the north of the west-marching humans, while on
the right, their comrades, the treelike bog blokes, lay in wait.
The troll pinning Fender started laughing even harder and began jumping
up and down, each descent crunching the dwarf a little deeper into the muck.
Reacting purely on instinct, thinking he would be crushed to death, Fender
quickly reached out and grabbed an exposed tree root, then rolled back, pull-
ing the soft wood out with him. As the troll came down the next time, its foot
settled on the root instead of the dwarf, and to Fender's relief, the troll seemed
not to notice—the root had about the same give, he figured.
Not pausing to savor in his minor victory, Fender bent the root so that it
would remain sticking out far enough to accommodate the troll, then rolled
back the other way, coming up to all fours as he wound about. He crept off
quietly behind a line of equally distracted trolls, but couldn't begin to imagine
how he might escape.
Because he could not, Fender Stouthammer admitted to himself. There

was no way for him, battered as he was, to hold any hope of getting free of
the wretched trolls.
"Next best thing, then," the dwarf silently mouthed and he moved into
position at the base of the most gently sloping region of the trench, and near
to a series of roots that climbed all the way to the crest, some eight feet from
the muddy bottom. With a deep breath and a moment of regret for all those
hearty friends and family he'd not ever see again, Fender exploded into
motion, running up the root line, hand over hand.
He counted on surprise, and so he had it as he crossed out of the pit and
away from the nearest, startled troll. Back behind him, he heard the hoots of
his guards, and the growing rumble of outrage.
Fender sprinted for all his life, and more importantly for the lives of all those
humans unwittingly approaching the designated kill zone. He tried to scream
out to warn them off the trolls, but of course he could not, and he waved all
the more frantically when several of the leading men began rushing his way.
Fender did not have to look behind him to know that the trolls had come out
in pursuit, for he saw the humans blanch and skid to a stop as one. He saw
their eyes go wide with shock and horror. He saw them start to backpedal,
then turn and run off shouting in terror.
"Run on," Fender gasped. "Run far and run free."
He felt as if he had been punched hard in the back then, his breath blasted
away. He didn't go flying away, though, and strangely felt no pain. When he
looked down to his own chest, he understood, for the thick and sharpened
end of a heavy branch protruded from between his breasts.
"Oh," Fender remarked, probably the loudest vocalization he had managed
since his throat had been cut.
Then he fell over, hardly free, but satisfied that he had properly executed
the next best thing.

Stupid trolls, Tos'un Armgo's fingers flashed to Kaer'lic in the silent hand
code of the dark elves. They cannot be trusted to guard a single wounded
prisoner!
Equally disgusted, Kaer'lic held her tongue and watched the unfolding
events. Already, the humans were in full and furious retreat, running back to
the east. From her high vantage point in the north, Kaer'lic began to nod with
renewed hope as the human line predictably began to veer south, away from
the charging trolls.
"Is he dead?" Kaer'lic asked, motioning toward the dwarf.
As she spoke, though, Fender squirmed.
"Run for the cover of the trees," the drow priestess said. The copse was
comprised of three bog blokes—which very much resembled dead, wintry
trees—for every real tree. "Yes, there you will find wood with which to burn the
trolls!"
Kaer'lic's wide smile met a similarly knowing one from her partner, for he
too recognized the certain doom looming before the ragtag bunch.
But Tos'un's growl stole her mirth, and she followed his scowl back to the
east-northeast, where a second force appeared, sweeping down a rocky
slope, whooping for war, rattling weapons, and calling out to the dwarf gods
Moradin, Clangeddin, and Dumathoin.
Then, amazingly, the dwarves all joined voice in song, a single refrain

repeated over and over again, "Along our wake ye people flee. We'll hold 'em
back and get ye free!"
Over and over again they sang it out, more emphatically at every juncture
when it seemed as if the folk of Nesme wouldn't veer back to the northeast.
"They've seen the truth of the bog blokes," Kaer'lic observed.
Tos'un gave a derisive laugh and replied, "Of all the races on and under
Toril, are any less adept at holding a simple trap than smelly trolls?"
"Any that were less adept than trolls likely were exterminated eons ago."
"What now?"
"Watch the fun," the priestess replied. "And go fetch that fallen dwarf.
Perhaps Lady Lolth will grant me the power I need to keep him alive, so
that we might find more enjoyment from him before we kill him."

Dagna's scouts had picked the perfect route for intercepting the chase. The
dwarves came down from on high, their short, strong legs gaining momentum
as they rambled down the slope. They rushed past the fleeing Nesmians to
the left, to a dwarf hollering angrily at those few human warriors who seemed
ready to turn and join in the dwarves' charge.
Dagna led his boys right around the humans, hardly slowing as they met
the charge of the trolls. Axes, swords, and hammers chopping, they slashed
through the front ranks. Those leading trolls who were still standing turned
around to fight their new, closer enemies.
Thus, by their own tactics, the dwarves found themselves surrounded
almost immediately. There was no despair at that realization, however, for
that was exactly as they, to a dwarf, had planned. They had stopped the troll
charge in its tracks, and had given the Nesmians a free run.
They knew the cost.
And accepted it with a song of battle on their lips.
Not one of Dagna's boys came off that field alive.

"Look how easily Proffit's fools are distracted!" Kaer'lic said. "They turn on a
force of two score, while twenty times that number run away!"
"They'll not escape," replied Tos'un, who had climbed a tree above Kaer'lic
and the panting Fender, which afforded him a wider range of view. "The bog
blokes outpace them from the south. Already the humans see that they will be
caught. Many of their males are forming a defense."
Kaer'lic looked up to her companion, but her smile became a curious frown,
for high above Tos'un, the priestess saw a line of fire streaking across the sky
west to east, descending as it went. As the fiery object crossed over Tos'un,
Kaer'lic began to make out its shape. It was some kind of a cart, a chariot
perhaps, pulled by a team of fiery horses.
Tos'un glanced up, too, as did everyone on the field.
Down the chariot swooped, cutting low over the humans, many of whom fell
to the ground in fear, but with others suddenly cheering.
Then, just south of the cluster of humans, great fireballs erupted, flames
leaping into the night sky.
"The bog blokes!" Tos'un cried out.
East of his position, the humans started on their run once more.
*

Her long silvery hair flying out behind her, Lady Alustriel of Silverymoon

held the reigns of her magically-created chariot of fire in one hand and waved
the other hand in a series of movements that brought another tiny pill of
glowing flame to her grasp. She veered the chariot for a run over the largest
remaining cluster of bog blokes and tossed the pill upon them as she passed.
The fireball erupted in their midst, the hungry flames biting at the bark-like
skin of the creatures.
Alustriel banked to get a view of the scene below, and saw that the humans
were well on their way again, and that the remaining bog blokes seemed too
busy getting away from burning kin to offer any more pursuit. Alustriel's heart
sank more than a little when she glanced back to the west, for the battle was
all but over, with the trolls overwhelming the dwarves.
Her admiration for Clan Battlehammer only grew that dark night, not only
for the actions of that particular brave force, but for even sending any warriors
south at such a dark time. Word had come to Silverymoon from Nesme of the
rise of the Trollmoors, and further information had filtered down through King
Emerus Warcrown of Citadel Felbarr detailing the march of Obould Many-
Arrows. Alustriel had set off at once to survey the situation.
She knew that Mithral Hall was under terrible duress. She knew that the
North had been swept by the ferocious orc king and his swarm of minions,
and that the western bank of the Surbrin had been heavily fortified.
She knew that she had done little to help that situation, but in looking at the
fleeing, desperate Nesmians, she took comfort that she had helped a bit at
least.

DISPUTING DIVINE INTERVENTION
Wulfgar flailed his arms and tried to twist as he fell from above, hoping to
get away from the area of confusion, where orcs screamed in agony and ran
all around, where molten metal glowed angrily, and where the vat bounced
down hard. He couldn't change his angle of descent, but was fortunate to
have instinctively pushed out when first he fell. He came down hard atop a
group of unsuspecting orcs, burying them beneath his bulk.
They only partially broke the fall of nearly two dozen feet, though, and
Wulfgar hit hard, twisting and slamming painfully as he and the orcs below
him went down to the floor. Burning pain assailed him from many places—he
figured that more than one bone had cracked in that fall—but he knew he had
no time to even wince. Screaming indecipherably, the barbarian put his feet
under him and forced himself up, flailing wildly with fist and hammer, trying to
keep the closest orcs at bay.
He stumbled for the exit corridor where he knew Bruenor and the others
were making their last stand in the great hall, but many orcs stood between
him and that door. Any hopes he had that the confusion caused by the molten
metal and the heavy vat would allow him to break free dissipated quickly as
the orcs reacted to him, prodding at him from every direction. He felt a stab in
his shoulder and twisted fast, snapping a flimsy spear's head right off. Aegis-
fang swung around hard, cracking an orc in the side with a blow heavy
enough to send it flying into a second, and to send both of them tumbling over
a third.
A spear hit Wulfgar in the buttocks, and one of the orcs lying on the floor
near to him bit him hard on the ankle. He kicked and thrashed, he swung his
hammer and shouldered his way forward, but against increasing resistance.
He couldn't make it, nor could the dwarves hope to get to him.
*
*
*
*
*
To the side of Wulfgar's position, a group of orcs moved cautiously toward
a single door, not knowing whether it blocked yet another corridor or a second
room. Fearing that enemies were waiting just beyond the closed portal, the
orcs called to one of the frost giants, inviting it to crash through.
The giant wore a frown at first, lamenting that it could not get to the fallen
human—the one, it knew, who had killed its friend with that terrible
warhammer—in time to claim the kill. But when it noted the orcs pointing
excitedly at the door, the behemoth curled up its lips and launched into a short
run, bending low. The giant slammed into the door that was not a door,
shouldering it, thinking to smash it into the room.
Except that there was no room, and it was no door.
It was wax, mostly, formed into the shape of a door and set not against a
corridor or room opening, but against solid stone—a section of wall that had
been thoroughly soaked with explosive oil of impact.
The fake door crashed in hard and the wax disintegrated under the force of
the sudden and devastating explosion. The many pieces of sharpened metal
concealed within the wax blew free, blasting outward in a line across the
room.
The giant bounced back, what was left of its face wearing an expression of
absolute incredulity. The behemoth held its arms wide and looked down at its

shredded body, at the heavy clothing and flaps of skin wagging freely from
head to toe, at the lines of blood dripping everywhere.
The giant looked back helplessly, and fell dead.
And all around it in that line of devastating shrapnel, orcs tumbled,
shrieked, and died.
*
*
*
*
*
Across the eastern end of the great hall, the fighting stopped, dwarves and
orcs alike turning back to gawk at the swath of death the exploding door cut
through the line of orcs and another pair of unfortunate giants. Alone in the
crowd, one warrior kept on fighting, though. Too blinded by pain and anger to
even hear the blast and the screams, Wulfgar gained momentum, swatting
with abandon, growling like an animal because he had not the sensibility
remaining to even form the name of his god.
He stumbled as much as he intentionally moved forward, crashing through
the lines of distracted orcs. He hardly heard the next loud report, though the
sudden vibration nearly knocked him from his feet as a large rock crashed
down behind him, clipping one orc and smashing a second. Had he turned
back, had his sensibilities not been shattered by the pain, emotional and
physical, Wulfgar would have recognized that particular boulder.
But he didn't look back, just drove forward. With the help of the distraction
from the door blast, he managed to plow through to Bruenor's ranks. Dwarves
surged out all around him, swarming behind him like a mother's loving arms
and gathering him into the tunnel before them.
"Aw, get him to the priests," Bruenor Battlehammer said when he finally got
the chance to take a good look at his adopted son.
Spear tips and orc arrows protruded from the barbarian in several places,
and those represented only a fraction of the battered man's visible wounds.
Bruenor knew well that Wulfgar likely had many more injuries he could not
see.
The dwarf king had to move past his fear for his boy, and quickly, for the
organized retreat reached a critical juncture that required absolute coordina-
tion. Bruenor and his warriors kept up the stubborn fight, but at the same time
began to flow backward from the wider chamber, tightening the line
appropriately as they melted into the single escape corridor.
Those in the first few ranks held tight their formations, but those farther
back from the fighting broke and ran, clearing the way for the flight that would
soon follow.
Farther back, in hidden side rooms, engineers held their positions at peg-
and-crank mechanisms.
Bruenor stayed in the center of the trailing line of flight, face to face with the
pursuing orcs. His axe added more than a few notches that day, creasing orc
skulls. With every step he took backward, the dwarf king had to battle against
his outrage that the filthy beasts had come into his sacred halls, and had to
remind himself that he would fall back on them before the turn of day.
When his line passed the assigned point, Bruenor called out and his voice
was joined by the shouts of all those around him.
The engineers pulled their pegs, literally dropping the ceiling of the corridor
back toward the great entry hall. Two huge blocks of stone slid down, filling
the corridor, crushing flat the unfortunate orcs beneath them and sealing off a
score of their comrades, those closest to Bruenor's boys, from their swarming

kin in the foyer.
The outraged dwarves made fast work of the trapped orcs.
Any joy that Bruenor had at the successful evacuation and upon learning
that Wulfgar's injuries were not too serious, was short-lived, though. A few
moments later, Bruenor's retreat route intersected with that of the dwarves
fleeing the ledge, dwarves who carried Catti-brie tenderly in their arms.

Tucked into the secret cubby, Regis rubbed his chubby hands over his
face, as if trying to brush away his mounting fear. He glanced up often to the
light streaming in through a neatly-blown hole in the solid stone wall of his
hiding place. Regis had heard the blast, and knew it to be the trapped wax
door. Apparently, one of the projectiles had been deflected—off an orc skull,
he hoped—and had rocketed up high, cracking through the outer stone wall of
the cubby and splitting the air barely an inch in front of the poor halfling's face.
Every so often, Regis glanced across at the other, far more substantial stone
wall, where the projectile, a metal sling bullet, could be seen embedded in the
rock.
The halfling fought hard to keep his breathing steady, realizing that the last
thing he could afford was for orcs to discover him. And they had come up to
the ledge, he knew, for he could hear their grunting and their large feet
slapping on the stone behind him.
"Five hours," he silently mouthed, for that was the planned pause before
the counterattack. He knew that he should try to get some sleep, then, but he
could smell the orcs nearby and simply couldn't relax enough to keep his eyes
closed for any length of time.
*
*
*
*
*
The dwarves gathered around Bruenor could hear the tentativeness in his
every word.
"But will it keep on rolling?" the dwarf king asked the engineers standing
beside a modified version of a "juicer," a heavy rolling ram designed to squish
the blood out of orcs and the like by pressing them against a wall. Unlike the
typical Battlehammer juicers, which were really no more than a cylinder of
stone on a thick axle with poles behind so the dwarves could rush it along, the
new contraption had been given a distinct personality. Carved wooden like-
ness of dwarves upon battle boars, the handiwork of Pikel Bouldershoulder,
stood out in front of the main body of the one-ton battering ram, and below
them was a skirt of metal, fanning out like a ship's prow. An "orc-catcher,"
Nanfoodle had named it, designed to wedge through the throng of enemies
like a spear tip, throwing them aside.
The whole of the thing was set upon well-greased metal wheels, lined in a
thin, sharpened ridge that would simply cut through any bodies the catcher
missed. Handles had been set for twenty dwarves to push, and as an added
bonus, Nanfoodle had geared the boar-riding statues to an offset on the axle,
so that the six wooden dwarf "riders" would seem to be charging, leaping over
each other in a rolling motion.
"They'll stop it eventually," Nanfoodle reasoned. "More by the pile of their
dead, I would guess, than by any concerted effort to halt the thing. Once the
dwarves get this contraption rolling, it would take a team of giants to slow it!"
Bruenor nodded and kept moving, studying the device from every con-
ceivable angle.

He had to keep moving, he knew. He had to keep studying and thinking of
the present crisis.
His two children had been hurt.
*
*
*
*
*
Wincing with every movement, Wulfgar swung his wolf-hide cloak across
his shoulders and managed to bring his right arm back far enough to get
behind the mantle and wrap it around him, covering his strong chain shirt of
interlocking mithral links.
"What're ye doing?" Delly Curtie asked him, coming back into the room
after settling Colson in her bed.
Wulfgar looked back at her as if the answer should be obvious.
"Cordio said ye wasn't to be going back today," Delly reminded him. "He
said ye're too hurt."
Wulfgar shook his head and clasped the wolf-hide surcoat closed. Before
he finished, Delly was at his side, tugging at one arm.
"Don't go," she pleaded.
Wulfgar stared down at her incredulously. "Orcs are in Mithral Hall. That
cannot hold."
"Let Bruenor drive them out. Or better, let us thicken the walls before them,
and leave them in empty chambers."
Wulfgar's expression did not straighten.
"We can go out the tunnels to Felbarr," Delly went on. "All of the clan.
They'll be welcomed there. I heard Jackonray Broadbelt say as much when he
was talking to the folk chased down from the northland."
"Perhaps many of those folk would be wise to go," Wulfgar admitted.
"Not one's intending to make Felbarr a home. They're all for Silverymoon
and Everlund and Sundabar. Ye've been to Silverymoon?"
"Once."
"Is it as beautiful as they say?" Delly asked, and the sparkle in her eyes
betrayed her innermost desire, showing it clearly to Wulfgar, whose own blue
eyes widened at the recognition.
"We will visit it," he promised, and he knew, somehow, that "visiting" wasn't
what Delly had in mind, and wouldn't be nearly enough to assuage her.
"What are you saying?" he demanded suddenly.
Delly fell back from the blunt statement. "Just want to see it, is all," she
said, lowering her gaze to the floor.
"Is something wrong?"
"Orcs're in the hall. Ye said so yerself."
"But if no orcs were in the hall, you would still wish to go to Silverymoon, or
Sundabar?"
Delly kicked at the stone, her hesitance seeming so completely out of
character that the hair on the back of Wulfgar's strong neck began to bristle.
"What kind of life is a child to get if all she's seeing are her parents and
dwarves?" Delly dared to ask.
Wulfgar's eyes flared. "Catti-brie had such an upbringing."
Delly looked up, her expression hardly complimentary.
"I have no time to argue about this," Wulfgar said. "They are bringing the
juicer into position, and I will hold my place behind it."
"Cordio said ye shouldn't go."
"Cordio is a priest, and always erring on the side of caution regarding those

he tends."
"Cordio is a dwarf, and wanting all who're able up there killing orcs," Delly
countered, and Wulfgar managed a smile. He figured that if it were not for
Colson, Delly would be marching out beside him to battle.
Or maybe not, he realized as he looked at her more closely, at the pro-
found frown that was hidden just below the surface of her almost-impassive
expression. He had hardly seen her since the conflict had begun, since they
had separated on the road from Icewind Dale back to Mithral Hall. Only then
did he realize how lonely she likely was, down there with dwarves too
distracted by pressing issues to hold her and comfort her.
"We will go see Silverymoon when this is over. And Sundabar," he offered.
Delly looked back down, but gave a slight nod.
Wulfgar winced again, and it was from more than physical pain. He
believed his own words and had no time for petty arguments. He walked over
and bent low, stiffly, from the pain, to give Delly a kiss. She offered only her
cheek for the peck.
By the time he had crossed out of the room, though, Wulfgar the warrior,
son of Beornegar, son of Bruenor, a champion of Mithral Hall, had put Delly
and her concerns out of his mind.

"We have breached the hall!" Tsinka shrieked.
Obould smirked at her, thinking that the shaman had forgotten how to
speak without raising her voice several octaves. All around them, orcs
cheered and hopped about, punching their fists in defiance. The grand entry
hall was theirs, as well as a complex of rooms both north and south of that
huge foyer. The eastern corridor had been sealed by heavy blocks, but if they
had been able to breach the magnificent western doors of Mithral Hall, could
any of them believe the impromptu barriers would pose any substantial
obstacle?
Lines of orcs marched past, dragging dead companions out into Keeper's
Dale where they were tossing them onto a gigantic pyre for burning. The line
seemed endless! In the few minutes of battle in the hall, the rain of death from
above and the stubborn defensive stance of the dwarves, more than three
hundred orcs had died. Traps, including that devastating explosion, the
source of which Obould was still to discern, had taken more than a score.
What other tricks might Bruenor Battlehammer have in store, the orc king
wondered. Was this entire section of Mithral Hall rigged to explode, like the
mountain ridge up the northern cliff beyond Keeper's Dale?
Had they even killed any dwarves in the fight? Obould was certain they had
taken down a few, at least, but so coordinated was the dwarves' retreat that
not a body had been left behind.
Beside him, Tsinka rambled on in her shrill tone, replaying the events with
a heroic spin. She spoke of the glory of Gruumsh and the coming sweep of
Clan Battlehammer from their ancient homeland, and all the orcs near to her
screamed with equal glee and enthusiasm.
Obould wanted to throttle the shaman.
The voice of Gerti Orelsdottr, obviously not happy with events, distracted
him from the maniacal cheering. Four giants had died in the fight, with two
others seriously wounded and scarred, and Gerti never took well to losing one
of her precious kin. While he was growing tired of Gerti's continual whining,

Obould knew that he would need the giantess and her forces if they were to
prod farther into the hall, and even if they were to continue to hold their
position along the River Surbrin. As much as he hated to admit it, Obould's
current vision of his kingdom included Gerti Orelsdottr.
The orc king looked back to Tsinka. Could she even grasp the trials ahead
of them? Did she even understand that they could not lose orcs by the
hundreds for every room's gain into Mithral Hall? Or that even if they
managed to chase the Battlehammers out at such a horrendous cost, Citadels
Felbarr and Adbar and the cities of Silverymoon and Everlund would certainly
come back at them?
"Gruumsh! Gruumsh! Gruumsh!" Tsinka began to chant, and the orcs near
to her took it up at the top of their lungs.
"Gruumsh! Gruumsh! Gruumsh!"
*
*
*
*
*
The sound poured in through the hole in the cubby and reverberated off the
stones, filling the space and flooding poor Regis's ears. The whole orc nation
seemed to be sitting on the halfling's shoulders, screaming in victory, and
Regis reflexively curled and brought his hands up to cover his ears. The
volume only seemed to increase despite his cover, though, as the orcs began
to stamp their feet, the whole of the great hall shaking under their collective
exultation.
Regis curled tighter to try to block it out. He almost expected Gruumsh to
walk into the hall and reach through the small hole to pull him out. His jaw
chattered so badly that his teeth hurt and his ears throbbed under the assault.
"Gruumsh! Gruumsh! Gruumsh!"
To his horror, Regis found himself yelling to counter the awful sound. His
frightened reaction proved most fortunate for the defenders of Mithral Hall, for
the halfling snapped his hands from his ears to his mouth just in time to hear a
different sound behind the chanting.
Dwarven horns, low and throaty, winded from somewhere deeper in the
complex.
It took Regis a long moment to even register them, and another moment to
recognize the signal.
He grabbed the peg lever with both hands and yanked it back, releasing
the crank. He held it back for a count of two, then shoved it forward.
The wheel spun for those two seconds, the rope winding out, through the
top of the cubby and the metal piping set along the ceiling. Outside in the
great entry hall, the umbrellalike contraption dropped, then stopped suddenly
with an abrupt jerk as the halfling's movement re-pegged the crank. The jolt
cracked the hinges holding the various layers of the bowl-shaped hopper,
inverting them one after another even as the whole of the contraption,
reacting to the untwisting of the heavy rope, began to turn.
Ceramic balls rolled out from the center, down prescribed tracks of metal
that ended in upward curls of varying elevations. With the turning movement
and the differing angles of release, the rolling balls leaped from the
contraption in a manner well-calculated to spread the "bombing" out across
the maximum area.
Each of the ceramic balls was filled with one of two potions. Some were
filled with bits of sharpened metal and the same oil of impact that had blown
apart the wax door, while others held a more straightforward concoction of

volatile liquid that exploded upon contact with air.
Bursts of shrapnel and mini-fireballs erupted all across the orc throng.
Chants of "Gruumsh!" became muffled grunts as bits of metal tore through
porcine lungs, and were surpassed by shrieks of agony as flames bit at other
orcs.
*
*
*
*
*
"A thousand wounds and a few deaths." That was how Ivan Bouldershoul-
der and Nanfoodle the gnome had aptly explained the effects of the umbrella
contraption to Bruenor and the others.
And that was exactly what Bruenor wanted. The dwarves of Clan
Battlehammer knew orcs well enough to understand the level of confusion
and terror they'd created. Farther back in the complex, great levers, larger
versions of the one Regis had used, were yanked back, releasing massive
counterweights chained to the blocks that had been dropped to seal the tun-
nels into the entry hall.
The first movement came far to the back of the dwarven line. Lowering their
shoulders, the dwarves grunted and shoved, starting the massive juicer on its
roll. How greatly their efforts increased when Wulfgar appeared among their
ranks, taking his place on the higher handles that had been put in just to
accommodate him.
"Go! Go! Go!" the warcommanders yelled to the leading line of dwarves as
the rolling juicer came into view, rumbling down the hall. The lead unit, cavalry
on fierce war pigs, swept out in front of the juicer and charged down the hall
even as the blocks began to rise. Beside them, Pikel Bouldershoulder
waggled the fingers of his one hand and waved dramatically, conjuring a mist
that seemed to rise from the very stones, obscuring the air at the end of the
corridor and in the closest areas of the great foyer.
Beyond the block, confusion dominated the hall, with dozens of small fires
keeping the orcs rushing every which way. Others thrashed wildly in fear and
pain. Some saw the coming charge, though, and shouted for a defensive
stand.
The dwarves on the war pigs howled to Moradin and kicked their mounts
into a swifter run, but then, as they neared the opening, they slowed suddenly,
tugging back their reins. They turned aside as one, skidding into the many
alcoves that lined the hall.
The orcs closest the corridor still saw cavalry charging, though, or thought
they did, for in the mist they couldn't really discern the difference between real
pigs and the carved figures on the front of the juicer. So they set their spears
and grouped in tight formation against the charge ...
... and were swept aside by the rolling tonnage of the dwarven war engine.
Into the hall went Wulfgar and the dwarves, plowing ahead and tossing
orcs aside with abandon. Behind them came the war pig cavalry, fanning out
with precision and to great effect against the supporting orcs, those that did
not have the long spears to counter such a charge.
Up above, as similar blocking stones were lifted by counterweights,
Bruenor and other dwarves roared out onto the ledges, finding, as they had
anticipated, more orcs staring back dumbfounded into the chaos of the foyer
than orcs ready to defend. Bruenor, and Pwent and his Gutbusters, gained a
foothold on the main ledge. With sheer ferocity they dislodged the orcs one
after another. Within moments, the balcony was clear, but Pwent and his boys

had prepared for that foregone conclusion well. Some of the Gutbusters had
come out onto the ledge already in harnesses, roped back to weighted
cranks.
As soon as the ledge began to clear, the lead-liners, as Pwent had called
them, simply leaped off, the counterbalanced cranks slowing their descent.
But not slowing them too much. They wanted to make an impression, after
all.
The rest of the Gutbusters sprang upon the ropes to get down to the real
action, and Bruenor did as well, turning the captured balconies over to lines of
crossbow-armed dwarves pouring out through the small tunnels.
Confusion won those early moments, and it was something that Bruenor
and his boys were determined to push through to the very end. More and
more dwarves rolled in or came down from above, thickening and widening
the line of slaughter.
Crossbowdwarves picked their targets carefully back by the entryway from
Keeper's Dale, looking for any orcs barking orders.
"Leader!" one dwarf cried, pointing out to one orc who seemed to be
standing taller than his fellows, perhaps up on a stone block so that he could
better direct the fighting.
Twenty dwarves turned their crossbows upon the target, and on the order
of "Fire!" let fly.
The unfortunate orc commander, shouting for a turn for defense, was
suddenly silenced—silenced and shattered as a barrage of bolts, many of
them packed with oil of impact, shredded his body.
The orcs around him howled and fled.
As Bruenor, Wulfgar, and all the floor fighters made their way across the
foyer, out of the corridor came the most important dwarves of all. Engineers
rambled out, bearing heavy metal sheets that could be quickly assembled into
a killing pocket, a funnel-shaped pair of walls to be constructed inside the
foyer near the broken doors. Lined on top with spear tips and cut with dozens
of murder holes, the killing pocket would cost their enemies dearly if the orcs
launched a counter charge.
But the work had to be done fast and it had to be done with perfect timing.
The first pieces, those farthest back from Keeper's Dale, were set in place
behind the leading edge of the dwarves' charge. If the orcs had countered
quickly enough, perhaps with giant support, the dwarves caught in front of
those huge metal wall sections would have been in a sorry position indeed.
It didn't happen, though. The orc retreat was a flight of sheer terror, taking
all the surviving orcs right out of Mithral Hall, surrendering ground readily.
In the span of just a few minutes, scores of orcs lay dead and the foyer was
back in Bruenor's hands.

"Turn them back! Lead them back!" Tsinka Shinriil pleaded with Obould.
"Quickly! Charge! Before the dwarves fortify!"
"Your orcs must lead the way," Gerti Orelsdottr added, for she wasn't about
to send her giants charging in to set off the no-doubt cunning traps the
dwarves still had in place.
Obould stood outside of Mithral Hall's broken doors and watched his
greatest fears come to fruition.
"Dwarves in their tunnels," he whispered under his breath, shaking his

head with every word.
Tsinka kept shouting at him to attack, and he almost did it.
The visions of his kingdom seemed to wash away under rivers of orc blood.
The orc king understood that he could counter the attack, that the sheer
weight of his numbers would likely reclaim the entry hall. He even suspected
that the dwarves were ready for such an eventuality, and would retreat again
in a well-coordinated, pre-determined fashion.
Twenty orcs would die for every dwarf that fell, much like the first assault.
A glance to the side showed Obould the massive, still-smoldering mound of
dead from the initial break-in.
Tsinka yelled at him some more.
The orc king shook his head. "Form defensive lines out here!" he shouted
to his commanders and gang leaders. "Build walls of stone and hide behind
them. If the dwarves try to come forth from their halls, slaughter them!"
Many of the commanders seemed surprised by the orders, but not a one
had the courage to even begin to question King Obould Many-Arrows, and
few of them wanted to charge back into the dwarven tunnels anyway.
"What are you doing?" Tsinka shrieked at him. "Kill them all! Charge into
Mithral Hall and kill them all! Gruumsh demands—"
Her voice cut off suddenly as Obould's hand clamped hard around her
throat. With just that one arm, the orc king lifted the shaman from the ground
and brought her up very close to his scowling face.
"I grow weary of Tsinka telling me the will of Gruumsh. I am Gruumsh, so
you say. We do not go back into Mithral Hall!"
He looked around at Gerti and the others, who were staring at him
skeptically.
"Seal the doors!" Obould ordered. "Put the smelly dwarves in their smelly
hole, and let us keep them there!" He turned back to Tsinka. "I will not throw
orcs onto dwarven spears for the sake of your orgy. Mithral Hall is an
inconvenience and nothing more—if we choose to make it that way. King
Bruenor is soon to be insignificant, a dwarf in a covered hole who cannot
strike out at me."
Tsinka's mouth moved as she tried to argue, but Obould clamped just a bit
tighter, turning her whispers into a gasp.
"There are better ways," Obould assured her.
He tossed her down and she stumbled back a few steps and fell onto her
behind.
"If you wish to live to see those ways, then choose your words and your
tone more wisely," Obould warned.
He turned on his heel and moved away.

PART TWO
DWARF AMBITIONS
From a high ridge east of Keeper's Dale, I watched the giants construct
their massive battering ram. I watched the orcs practice their tactics-tight lines
and sudden charges. I heard the awful cheering, the bloodthirsty calls for
dwarf blood and dwarf heads, the feral screams of battle lust.
From that same ridge, I watched the huge ram pulled back by a line of
giants, then let loose to swing hard and fast at the base of the mountain on
which I stood, at the metal doorway shell of Mithral Hall. The ground beneath
my feet shuddered. The booming sound vibrated in the air.
They pulled it back and let fly again and again.
Then the shouts filled the air, and the wild charge was on.
I stood there on that ridge, Innovindil beside me, and I knew that my
friends, Bruenor's kin, were battling for their homeland and for their very lives
right below me. And I could do nothing.
I realized then, in that awful moment, that I should be in there with the
dwarves, killing orcs until at last I, too, was cut down. I realized then, in that
awful moment, that my decisions of the last few tendays, formed in anger and
even more in fear, betrayed the trust of the friendship that Bruenor and I had
always held.
Soon after—too soon!—the mountainside quieted. The battle ended.
To my horror, I came to see that the orcs had won the day, that they had
gained a foothold inside Mithral Hall. They had driven the dwarves from the
entry hall at least. I took some comfort in the fact that the bulk of the orc force
remained outside the broken door, continuing their work in Keeper's Dale. Nor
had many giants gone in.
Bruenor's kin were not being swept away; likely, they had surrendered the
wider entry halls for the more defensible areas in the tighter tunnels.
That sense of hope did not wash away my guilt, however. In my heart I
understood that I should have gone back to Mithral Hall, to stand with the
dwarves who for so long had treated me as one of their own.
Innovindil would hear nothing of it, though. She reminded me that I had not,
had never, fled the battle for Mithral Hall. Obould's son was dead because of
my decision, and many orcs had been turned back to their holes in the Spine
of the World because of my—of our, Innovindil, Tarathiel and myself—work in
the north.
It is difficult to realize that you cannot win every battle for every friend. It is
difficult to understand and accept your own limitations, and with them, the
recognition that while you try to do the best you can, it will often prove
inadequate.
And so it was then and there, on that mountainside watching the battle, in
that moment when all seemed darkest, that I began to accept the loss of
Bruenor and the others. Oh, the hole in my heart did not close. It never will. I
know and accept that. But what I let go then was my own guilt at witnessing
the fall of a friend, my own guilt at not having been there to help him, or there
to hold his hand in the end.
Most of us will know loss in our lives. For an elf, drow or moon, wild or
avariel, who will see centuries of life, this is unavoidable—a parent, a friend, a
brother, a lover, a child even. Profound pain is often the unavoidable reality of

conscious existence. How less tolerable that loss will be if we compound it
internally with a sense of guilt.
Guilt.
It is the easiest of feelings to conjure, and the most insidious. It is rooted in
the selfishness of individuality, though for goodly folks, it usually finds its
source in the suffering of others.
What I understand now, as never before, is that guilt is not the driving force
behind responsibility. If we act in a goodly way because we are afraid of how
we will feel if we do not, then we have not truly come to separate the concept
of right and wrong. For there is a level above that, an understanding of
community, friendship, and loyalty. I do not choose to stand beside Bruenor or
any other friend to alleviate guilt. I do so because in that, and in their
reciprocal friendship, we are both the stronger and the better. Our lives
become worth so much more.
I learned that one awful day, standing on a cold mountain stone watching
monsters crash through the door of a place that had long been my home.
I miss Bruenor and Wulfgar and Regis and Catti-brie. My heart bleeds for
them and yearns for them every minute of every day. But I accept the loss
and bear no personal burden for it beyond my own emptiness. I did not turn
from my friends in their hour of need, though I could not be as close to them
as I would desire. From across that ravine when Withegroo's tower fell, when
Bruenor Battlehammer tumbled from on high, I offered to him all that I could:
my love and my heart.
And now I will go on, Innovindil at my side, and continue our battle against
our common enemy. We fight for Mithral Hall, for Bruenor, for Wulfgar, for
Regis, for Catti-brie, for Tarathiel, and for all the goodly folk. We fight the
monstrous scourge of Obould and his evil minions.
At the end, I offered to my falling friends my love and my heart. Now I
pledge to them my enduring friendship and my determination to live on in a
manner that would make the dwarf king stare at me, his head tilted, his
expression typically skeptical about some action or another of mine.
Durned elf,
he will say often, as he looks down on me from Moradin's
halls.
And I will hear him, and all the others, for they are with me always, no small
part of Drizzt Do'Urden.
For as I begin to let go, I find that I hold them all the tighter, but in a way
that will make me look up to the imagined halls of Moradin, to the whispered
grumbling of a lost friend, and smile.
—Drizzt Do'Urden

10
THE UNEXPECTED TURN
He heard a horn blow somewhere far back in the recesses of his mind, and
the ground beneath him began to tremble. Shaken from Reverie, the elves'
dreamlike, meditative state, Drizzt Do'Urden's lavender eyes popped open
wide. In a movement that seemed as easy as that blink, the drow leaped up to
his feet, hands instinctively going to the scimitars belted on each hip.
Around a boulder that served as a windbreak in their outdoor, ceilingless
camp came Innovindil, quick-stepping.
Beneath their feet, the mountain itself trembled. Off to the side, Sunset
pawed at the stone and snorted.
"The dwarves?" Innovindil asked.
"Let us hope it is the dwarves," Drizzt replied, for he didn't want to imagine
the hellish destruction that rumbling might be causing to Clan Battlehammer if
Obould's minions were the cause.
The two sprinted away, full speed down the side of the rocky slope. No
other race could have matched the pace of the fleet and balanced elves, drow
and moon. They ran side by side, leaping atop boulders and skipping over
narrow cracks deep beyond sight. Arm-in-arm they overcame any natural
barriers, with Drizzt hoisting Innovindil over one short stone wall, and she
turning back to offer him a complimentary hand up.
Down they ran, helping each other every step. They came to one smooth
and steeply declining slope that ended in a sheer drop, but rather than slow
their swift run as they approached that cliff, they put their heads down and
sped on. For at the base of that slope, overlooking the cliff, was a small tree,
and the pair came upon it in turn. Drizzt leaped and turned, his torso hori-
zontal. He caught the tree with outstretched arms and swung around it, using
its strength to veer his run to the side.
Innovindil came right behind with a similar movement and the two ran on
along the ledge. They moved to the same vantage point they had taken to
witness Obould's break-in to Mithral Hall, a high, flat stone on a westward jut
that afforded them a view of most of the dale, excepting only the area right
near the great doors of the hall.
Soon the pair could hear screams from below, and Drizzt's heart leaped
when he came to recognize that they were the cries of orcs alone.
By the time Drizzt and Innovindil got to their lookout spot, orcs were
pouring from the broken doors, running back out into Keeper's Dale in full
flight. Flames sprouted on some, flickering orange in the diminishing daylight,
and others staggered, obviously wounded.
"The dwarves fight back," Innovindil observed.
Drizzt's hands went to his scimitar hilts and he even started away, but
Innovindil grabbed him by the shoulder and held him steady.
"As you did for me when Tarathiel was slain," she explained into his scowl
when he turned to regard her. "There is nothing we can do down there."
Looking back, Drizzt knew she was right. The area of the dale closest the
doors was a swaying sea of orc warriors, shouting and shoving, some running
for the broken doors, others running away. Giants dotted that sea, like tall
masts of an armada, closing cautiously. Echoing from the entry hall came the
unmistakable sounds of battle, a cacophony of screams and shouts, the clang

of metal, and the rumble of stonework.
A giant staggered out, scattering orcs before it.
Up on the stone, Drizzt punched his fist in victory, for it quickly became
apparent that the dwarves were winning the day, that Obould's minions were
being rudely evicted from Mithral Hall.
"They are giving ground," Innovindil called to him. He turned to see that she
had moved far to the side, even climbing down over the lip of the flat stone
perch to gain an even better vantage point. "The dwarves have gained the
door!" she called.
Drizzt punched his fist again and silently congratulated the kin of King
Bruenor. He had seen their mettle so many times up in the cold and harsh
terrain of Icewind Dale, and in the war against his kin from Menzoberranzan.
Thus, when he considered his former companions, he realized that he should
not be surprised at the sudden turn of events. Still, it boggled even Drizzt to
think that such an army as Obould's had been turned back in so efficient a
manner.
Innovindil came up beside him a short while later, when the fighting had
died down somewhat. She took his arm in her own and leaned in against him.
"It would seem that the orc king underestimated the strength of King
Bruenor's kin," she remarked.
"I am surprised that they turned back against the orcs in this manner,"
Drizzt admitted. "The tunnels beyond the entry halls are tighter and more
easily held."
"They do not want the stench of orcs in their halls."
Drizzt merely smiled.
For a long time, the pair stood there, and when they at last settled in for the
remainder of the night, they did so right there on that flat stone, both eager to
see what the orcs might do to counter the dwarves' charge.
As the slanting rays of the rising sun fell over them and past them to illu-
minate the dale below a couple of hours later, both elves were a bit surprised
to see that the orcs had moved back from the doors, and seemed in no hurry
to close in again. Indeed, from everything Drizzt and Innovindil could tell, it
appeared as if the orcs and giants were taking up their own defensive posi-
tions. The elves watched curiously as gangs of orcs carted heavy stones in
from the mountainsides, piling them near other teams who were fast at work
in constructing walls.
Every now and then a giant would take one of those stones, give a roar of
defiance, and launch it at the door area, but that, it seemed, was the extent of
the monstrous counterattack.
"When have you ever known orcs to so willingly surrender ground, except
in full retreat?" Drizzt asked, as much to himself as to his companion.
Innovindil narrowed her blue eyes and more closely studied the dale below,
looking for some clue that there was something going on beneath the
seemingly unconventional behavior by the brutish and aggressive monsters.
For all she could tell, though, the orcs were not gathering for another charge,
nor were they breaking ranks and running away, as so often happened. They
were digging in.

Delly Curtie crept up to the slightly opened door. She held her boots in her
hand for she did not want them to clack against the hard stone floor. She

crouched and peered in and wasn't surprised, but was surely disappointed, to
see Wulfgar sitting beside the bed, leaning over Catti-brie.
"We drove them back," he said.
"I hope more got killed than got away," the woman replied in a voice still
weak. She had to swallow hard a couple of times to get through that single
sentence, but there was little doubt that she was steadily and greatly improv-
ing. When they had first taken Catti-brie down from the ledge, the clerics had
feared that her injuries could prove fatal, but instead they had all they could
handle in keeping the woman in her bed and away from the fighting.
"I hit a few for you," Wulfgar assured her.
Delly couldn't see his face, but she was certain that the smile flashed on
Catti-brie's face was mirroring Wulfgar's own.
"Bet ye did," Catti-brie replied.
Delly Curtie wanted to run in and punch her. It was that simple. The pretty
face, the bright smile, the sparkle in her rich blue eyes, even in light of her
injuries, just grated on the woman from Luskan.
"Talking like a dwarf again, pretty one?" Delly said under her breath, noting
that Catti-brie's accent, in her stark time of vulnerability, seemed more akin to
the tunnels of Mithral Hall than the more proper speech she had been using of
late. In effect, Catti-brie was talking more like Delly.
Delly shook her head at her own pettiness and tried to let it go.
Wulfgar said something then that she did not catch, and he began to laugh,
and so did Catti-brie. When was the last time Delly and Wulfgar had laughed
like that? Had they ever?
"We'll pay them back in full and more," Wulfgar said, and Catti-brie nodded
and smiled again. "There is talk of breaking out through the eastern door,
back toward the Surbrin. Our enemies are stronger in the west, but even there
their ranks are diminishing."
"Swinging to the east?" Catti-brie asked.
Delly saw Wulfgar's shoulders hunch up in a shrug.
"Even so, they do not believe that they can get in that way, and they cannot
expect that we can break out," Wulfgar explained. "But the engineers insist
that we can, and quickly. They'll probably use one of Nanfoodle's concoctions
and blow up half the mountain."
That brought another shared laugh, but Delly ignored that one, too intrigued
by the possibilities of what Wulfgar was saying.
"Citadel Felbarr will support us across the Surbrin," he went on. "Their army
now marches for the town of Winter Edge, just across the river and to the
north. If we can establish a foothold from the eastern door to the river and
establish a line of new warriors and supplies from across the river, Obould will
not push us into the hall again."
And all those people from the north will get their wish and be gone from
Mithral Hall, Delly silently added.
She watched as Catti-brie managed to prop herself up, wincing just a bit
with the movement. She flashed that perfect smile again, the light of it searing
Delly's heart.
For she knew that Wulfgar was similarly grinning.
She knew that the two of them shared a bond far beyond any she could
ever hope to achieve with the man who called himself her husband.

"They will not break out without great cost," Obould told those gathered
around him, the leading shamans and gang bosses, and Gerti Orelsdottr and
a few of her elite frost giants. "They are in their hole, and there they will stay.
We will not relent our efforts to fortify this dale. As the dwarves built their inner
sanctum to cost an invader dearly, so this dale will become our first line of
slaughter."
"But you will not go back in?" Gerti asked.
Across from her, Tsinka Shinriil and some of the other shamans growled at
the thought, and King Obould gave them a sidelong glance.
"Let them have their hole," he said to Gerti. "I... we, have all this." He swept
his muscular arm out wide, encompassing all the mountains and wide lands to
the north.
"What about Proffit?" Tsinka dared to ask. "We put him into the southern
tunnels to fight the dwarves. The trolls await our victory."
"May he find success, then," said Obould, "but we will not go in."
"You abandon an ally?"
Obould's scowl told everyone present that Tsinka was approximately one
word from death at that moment.
"Proffit has found more gain that he could ever have hoped to achieve,"
said the orc king. "Because of Obould! He will fight and win some tunnels, or
he will be pushed back to the Trollmoors where his strength has never been
greater." Obould's red-streaked yellow eyes narrowed dangerously and a low
growl escaped his torn lips as he added, "Have you anything more to say on
this?"
Tsinka shrank back.
"You will end it here, then?" Gerti asked.
Obould turned to her and said, "For now. We must secure that which we
have gained before we move further against our enemies. The danger now
lies mostly in the east, the Surbrin."
"Or the south," Gerti said. "There are no great rivers protecting us from the
armies of Everlund and Silverymoon in the south."
"If they come at us from the south, Proffit will give us the time we need,"
Obould explained. "The enemies we must expect are Adbar and Felbarr.
Dwarf to dwarf. If they can breach the Surbrin, they will try to cut our lines in
two."
"Do not forget the tunnels," one of Gerti's giant aides added. "The dwarves
know the upper layers of the Underdark. We may find them climbing out of
holes in our midst!"
All eyes went to the confident Obould, who seemed to accept and appre-
ciate the warning.
"I will build a watchtower on every hill and a wall across every pass. No
kingdom will be better fortified and better prepared against attack, for no
kingdom is so surrounded by enemies. Every day that passes will bring new
strength to Obould's domain, the Kingdom of Dark Arrow." He stood up tall
and stalked about the gathering. "We will not rest our guard. We will not turn
our eyes aside, nor turn our weapons upon each other. More will join our
ranks. From every hole in the Spine of the World and beyond, they will come
to the power of Gruumsh and the glory of Obould!"
Gerti stood up as well, if for no better reason than to tower over the
pompous orc.

"I will have the foothills to the Trollmoors, and you will have the Spine of the
World," Obould assured her. "Treasure will flow north as payment for your
alliance."
The ugly orc gave a toothy grin and clapped his hands together hard. A
group of orcs soon approached from the side of the gathering, leading the
hobbled pegasus.
"It is not a fitting mount," Obould said to Gerti. "An unreliable and stupid
beast. A griffon, perhaps, for King Obould, or a dragon—yes, I would like that.
But not a soft and delicate creature such as this." He looked around. "I had
thought to eat it," he joked, and all the orcs began to chuckle. "But I see the
intrigue in your eyes, Gerti Orelsdottr. Our perceptions of ugliness and beauty
are not alike. I suspect that you consider the beast quite pretty."
Gerti stared at him skeptically, as if she expected him to then walk over and
cut the pegasus in half.
"Whether you think it ugly or pretty, the beast is yours," Obould said,
surprising all those orcs around him. "Take it as a trophy or a meal, as you
will, and accept it with my gratitude for all that you have done here."
No one in attendance, not even Gerti's close frost giant friends, had ever
seen the giantess so perfectly unnerved, excepting that one occasion when
Obould had bested her in combat. At every turn, the orc king seemed to have
Dame Orelsdottr off-balance.
"You think it ugly so you offer it to me?" Gerti balked, stumbling through the
convoluted rebuttal, and without much heart, obviously.
Obould didn't bother to answer. He just stood there holding his smile.
"The winter winds are beginning to blow high up in the mountains," Gerti
said clumsily. "Our time here is short, if we are to see Shining White again
before the spring."
Obould nodded and said, "I would ask that you leave some of your kin at
my disposal along the Surbrin through the season and the next. We will
continue to build as the winter snows protect our flank. By next summer, the
river will be impervious to attack and your giants can return home."
Gerti looked from Obould to the pegasus several times before agreeing.

The mountainside south of Mithral Hall's retaken western door was more
broken and less sheer than the cliffs north of that door or those marking the
northern edge of Keeper's Dale, so it was that approach Drizzt and Innovindil
chose as their descent. Under cover of night, moving silently as only elves
could, the pair picked their careful path along the treacherous way, inching
toward Mithral Hall. They knew the dwarves had the door secured once more,
for every now and then a ballista bolt or a missile of flaming pitch soared out
to smash against the defenses of Obould's hunkering force.
Confident that they could get into the hall, Drizzt realized that he was out of
excuses. It was time to go home and face the demons of sorrow. He knew in
his heart that his hopes would be dashed, that he would learn what he already
knew to be true. His friends were lost to him, and a few hundred yards away
as he picked his path among the stones, lay the stark truth.
But he continued along, Innovindil at his side.
They had left Sunset up on the mountaintop, untethered and free to run
and fly. The pegasus would wait, or would flee if necessary, and Innovindil
held all confidence that she would find her again when she called.

About a hundred and fifty feet above the floor of Keeper's Dale, the pair ran
into a bit of a problem. Leading the way, Drizzt found that he was out of easy
routes to the bottom, and could see no way at all for him and Innovindil to get
down there under cover.
"They've got a fair number of sentries set and alert," Innovindil whispered
as she moved down in a crouch beside him. "More orcs and more alert than
I'd have expected."
"This commander is cunning," Drizzt agreed. "He'll not be caught
unawares."
"We cannot get down this way," Innovindil surmised.
They both knew where they had gone wrong. Some distance back, they
had come to a fork in the ravinelike descent. One path had gone almost
straight down to the ridge above the doors, while the one they had opted to
take had veered to the south. Looking at the doors, the pair could see that
other trail, and it seemed as if it could indeed take them low enough for a final,
desperate run to the dwarven complex.
Of course, they came to see the truth of it: if they went in, they wouldn't
have an easy time getting out.
"We cannot backtrack and come back down the other way before the
dawns light finds us," Drizzt explained. "Tomorrow, then?"
He turned to see a very serious Innovindil staring back at him.
"If I go in, I am abandoning my people," she replied, her voice even more
quiet than the whispers of their conversation.
"How so?"
"How will we get back out when there seems no concealed trail to the
valley floor?"
"I will get us out, if we have to climb the chimneys of Bruenor's furnaces,"
Drizzt promised, but Innovindil was shaking her head with every word.
"You go tomorrow. You must return to them."
"Alone?" Drizzt asked. "No."
"You must," said Innovindil. "We'll not get to Sunrise anytime soon. The
pegasus's best chance might well be a parlay from Mithral Hall to Obould."
She put her hand on Drizzt's shoulder, moved it up to gently stroke his face,
then let it slip back down to the base of his neck. "I will continue to watch from
out here. From afar, on my word. I know that you will return, and perhaps then
we will have a means to retrieve lost Tarathiel's mount and friend. I cannot
allow Obould to hold so beautiful a creature any longer."
Again her delicate hand went up to gently brush Drizzt's face.
"You must do this," she said. "For me and for you. And for Tarathiel."
Drizzt nodded. He knew that she was right.
They started back up the trail, thinking to return to a hidden camp, then
take the alternate route when the sun began to dip below the western horizon
once more.
The night was full of the sound of hammers and rolling stones, both inside
the hall and outside in Keeper's Dale, but it was an uneventful night for the
couple, lying side by side under the stars in the cool autumn wind.
To his surprise, Drizzt did not spend the hours in fear of what the following
night might bring.
At least, not concerning his friends, for his acceptance was already there.
He did fear for Innovindil, and he looked over at her many times that night,

silently vowing that he would come back out as soon as he could to rejoin her
in her quest.
Their plans did not come to fruition, though, for under the bright sun of the
following morning, a commotion in Keeper's Dale brought the two elves to
their lookout post. They watched curiously as a large caravan comprised
mostly of giants—almost all of the giants—rolled out to the west away from
them, moving to the exit of Keeper's Dale. Some orcs traveled along with
them, most pulling carts of supplies.
And one other creature paced in that caravan, as well. Even from a dis-
tance, the sharp eyes of Innovindil could not miss the glistening white coat of
poor Sunrise.
"They break ranks?" she asked. "A full retreat?"
Drizzt studied the scene below, watching the movements of the orcs who
were not traveling beside the giants. The vast bulk of the monstrous army that
had come to Keeper's Dale was not on the move. Far from it, construction on
defensive barriers, walls low and high, continued in full.
"Obould is not surrendering the ground," the drow observed. "But it would
seem that the giants have had enough of the fight, or there is somewhere else
where they're more urgently needed."
"In either case, they have something that does not belong to them," said
Innovindil.
"And we will get him back," Drizzt vowed.
He looked down at the path that would likely get him to the western doors
of Mithral Hall, the path that he had decided to walk that very night so that he
could settle the past and be on with the future.
He looked back to the west and the procession, and he knew that he would
not take that path to the doors that night.
He didn't need to.
He looked to his companion and offered her a smile of assurance that he
was all right, that he was ready to move along.
That he was ready to bring Sunrise home.

STUMBLING
Dizzy and weak with hunger, his extremities numb, his fingers scraped and
twisted from a dozen falls as he tried to make his way down the difficult
mountain terrain, Nikwillig stubbornly put one foot in front of the other and
staggered forward. He wasn't even sure where he was going anymore—just
forward. A part of him wanted to simply lie down and expire, to be rid of the
pain and the emptiness, both in his belly and in his thoughts.
The past few days had not been kind to the poor dwarf from Citadel Fel-
barr. His food was gone, though there was plenty of water to be found. His
clothing was torn in many places from various falls, including one that had him
bouncing thirty feet down a rocky slope. That fall had left him senseless for
nearly an hour, and had also left him weaponless. Somewhere in the descent,
Nikwillig had dropped his short sword, and as luck would have it, the weapon
had bounced into a narrow ravine, a deep crack really, between two huge
slabs of solid stone. After he'd gathered his sensibilities, the dwarf retraced
his steps and had actually found the weapon, but alas, it lay beyond his short
reach.
He had fetched a small branch and tried again, using the stick to try to
maneuver the sword at a better angle for grabbing. But the sword slipped from
its unexpectedly precarious perch, clanking down to the deeper recesses of
the cavity.
With a helpless shrug, Nikwillig, who had never been much of a fighter
anyway, had let it go at that. He didn't much care for the idea of being
unarmed in hostile territory, with ugly orcs all around him, but he knew there
was nothing more he could do.
So as he had done after watching Nanfoodle's explosion and the dwarves'
retreat, Nikwillig of Felbarr just shrugged with resignation. He continued on his
way, moving generally east, though the trails were taking him more north than
he had hoped.
A few days later, the dwarf just stumbled along almost blindly. He kept
repeating "Surbrin" over and over as a reminder, but most of the time, he
didn't even know what the word meant. A dwarf's stubbornness alone kept
him in motion.
One foot in front of the other.
He was on flatter ground, though he hardly knew it, and his progress was
steady if not swift. Early in his journey, he had moved mostly at night, hiding in
shallow caves during the daylight hours, but eventually it all seemed the
same.
It didn't matter. Nothing mattered, except putting one foot in front of the
other and repeating the word, "Surbrin."
Suddenly, though, something else did matter.
It came to Nikwillig on the breeze. Not a sight, nor a sound, but a smell.
Something was cooking.
The dwarf's stomach growled in response and he stopped his march, a
moment of clarity falling over him. In mere seconds, his feet were moving
again, of their own accord, it seemed. He veered to the side—he knew not
whether it was left or right, or what direction. The aroma of cooking meat
pulled him inexorably forward, and he leaned as he walked, and began licking

his cracked, dirty lips.
His sensibilities clarified further when he came in sight of the cooking fire,
and of the chef, with its sickly dull orange skin, shock of wild black hair, and
protruding lower jaw.
Nothing could sober a dwarf like the sight of a goblin.
The creature seemed oblivious to him. It hunched over the spit, pouring
some gravy from a stone bowl.
Nikwillig licked his lips again as he watched the thick liquid splatter over the
juicy dark meat.
Leg of lamb, Nikwillig thought and it took every ounce of control the
battered dwarf could muster to not groan aloud, and not rush ahead blindly.
He held his ground long enough to glance left and right. Seeing no other
monsters about, the dwarf launched into a charge, lowering his head and run-
ning straight for the unwitting goblin chef.
The goblin straightened, then turned around curiously just in time to catch a
flying dwarf in the shoulder. Over the pair flew, upsetting the spit and scat-
tering bits of the fire. They crashed down hard, the hot gravy flying wildly,
most of it splashing the goblin in the face. The creature howled from the burns
and tried to cover up, but Nikwillig grabbed it by its skinny throat with both
hands. He lifted up and slammed down several times, then scrambled away,
leaving the goblin whimpering and curling in the dirt.
The leg of lamb, too, had landed on the ground and rolled in the dirt, but
the dwarf didn't even stop to brush it clean. He grabbed it up in both hands
and tore at it eagerly, ripping off large chunks of juicy meat and swallowing
them with hardly a chew.
A few bites in, Nikwillig paused long enough to catch his breath and to
savor the taste.
Shouts erupted all around him.
The dwarf staggered up from his knees and began to run. A spear clipped
his shoulder, but it skipped past without digging in. Good sense would have
told Nikwillig to throw aside the meat and run full out, but in his famishment,
the dwarf was far from good sense. Clutching the leg of lamb to his chest as
dearly as if it was his only child, he charged along, weaving in and out of
boulders and trees, trying to keep as much cover between him and the
pursuing monsters as possible.
He came out the side of a small copse and skidded to a stop, for he found
himself on the edge of a low but steep descent. Below him, barely fifty feet
away, the broad, shining River Surbrin rolled along its unstoppable way.
"The river..." Nikwillig muttered, and he remembered then his goal when he
had left his perch high on the mountain ridge north of Mithral Hall. If only he
could get across the river!
A shout behind him sent him running again, stumbling down the slope—
one step, two. Then he went down hard, face first, and tucked himself just
enough to launch himself in a roll. He gathered momentum, but did not let go
of his precious cargo, rolling and bouncing all the way down until he splashed
into the cold water.
He pulled himself to his feet and staggered to the bank and tried to run
along.
Something punched him hard in the back, but he only yelled and continued
his run.

If only he could find a log. He'd drag it into the river, and freezing water be
damned, he'd grab onto it and push himself out from the bank.
Some trees ahead looked promising, but the shouts were sounding closer
and Nikwillig feared he would not make it.
And for some reason he did not immediately comprehend, his legs were
moving more slowly, and were tingling as if they were going numb.
The dwarf stopped and looked down, and saw blood—his own blood—
dripping down to the ground between his widespread feet. He reached around
and only then did he understand that the punch he'd felt had been no punch at
all, for his hand closed over the shaft of a goblin spear.
"O Moradin, ye're teasing me," Nikwillig said as he dropped to his knees.
Behind him, he heard the hoots and shouts of charging goblins.
He looked down at his hands, to the leg of lamb he still held, and with a
shrug, he brought it up and tore off another chunk of meat.
He didn't swallow as fast, though, but chewed that bite and rolled it around
in his mouth, savoring its sweetness, its texture, and the warmth of it. It
occurred to him that if he had a mug of mead in his other hand that would be
a good way for a dwarf to die.
He knew the goblins were close, but was surprised when a club smacked
him off the back of the head, launching him face down in the dirt.
Nikwillig of Citadel Felbarr tried to concentrate on the taste of the lamb,
tried to block out the pain.
He hoped that death would take him quickly.
Then he knew no more.

FOOL ME ONCE, SHAME ON ME, FOOL ME TWICE . . .
"You cannot even think of continuing back toward Nesme," Rannek scolded
after he had taken Galen Firth off to the side of the main encampment.
They had run for many hours after the heroic intervention of General Dagna
and his dwarves, going back to the foothills in the north near where the
dwarves had found the tunnels that would take them to Mithral Hall.
"Would you make the sacrifice of those fifty dwarves irrelevant for the sake
of your pride?" Rannek pressed.
"You are one to be speaking of pride," Galen Firth replied, and his adver-
sary did back down at that.
But only for a moment, then Rannek squared his shoulders and puffed out
his broad chest. "I will never forget my error, Galen Firth," he admitted. "But I
will not complicate that error now by throwing our entire force into the jaws of
the trolls and bog blokes."
"They were routed!" Galen yelled, and both he and Rannek glanced back to
the main group to note several curious expressions coming back at them.
"They were routed," he said again, more quietly. "Between the dwarves'
valiant stand and Alustriel's firestorm, the enemy forces were sliced apart. Did
they even offer any pursuit? No? Then is it not also possible that the monsters
have gone home to their dung-filled moor? Are you so ready to run away?"
"And are you truly stupid enough to walk back into them? Care you not for
those who cannot fight? Should our children die on your gamble, Galen
Firth?"
"We do not even know where the caves are," Galen argued. "We cannot
simply wander the countryside blindly and hope we find the right hole in the
ground."
"Then let us march to Silverymoon," offered Rannek.
"Silverymoon will march to us," Galen insisted. "Did you not see Alustriel?
Rannek chewed his lip and it took all of his control not to just spit on the
man. "Are you that much the fool?" he asked. "The ungrateful fool?"
"I am not the fool who put us out here, far from our homes," Galen
answered without hesitation, and in the same calm tone that Rannek had just
used on him. "That man stands before me now, errantly thinking he has the
credibility to question me."
Rannek didn't blink and didn't back down, but in truth, he knew that he had
no practical answer to that. He was not in command. The beleaguered folk of
Nesme would not listen to him over the assurances and orders of the proven
Galen Firth.
He stared at the man a while longer, then just shook his head and turned
away. He didn't allow his grimace to stop the smooth flow of his departure
when he heard Galen Firth's derisive snort behind him.
*
*
*
*
*
The next dawn made the argument to Galen Firth that Rannek had been
unable to make, for the scouts from the refugee band returned with news that
a host of trolls was fast closing from the south.
Watching Galen Firth as he heard that grim report, Rannek almost
expected the man to order the warriors to close ranks and launch an attack,
but even the stern and stubborn Galen was not that foolhardy.

"Gather up and prepare to march, and quickly," he called to those around
him. He turned to the scouts. "Some of you monitor the approach of our
enemies. Others take swift flight to the northeast. Find our scouts who are
searching for the tunnels to Mithral Hall and secure our escape route."
As he finished, the man turned a glare over Rannek, who nodded in silent
approval. Galen Firth's face grew very tight at that, as if he took the expres-
sion as a smarmy insult.
"We will lure our enemies into a long run, and circumvent them so that we
might reclaim our home," Galen stubbornly told his soldiers, and Rannek's jaw
dropped open.
Having grown adept at running, the Nesme band was on the move in
minutes, and in proper formation so that the weakest were well supported
near the center of the march. Few said anything. They knew that trolls were in
close pursuit, and that that day could mark the end of all their lives.
They came to higher and more broken ground by mid-morning, and from an
open vantage point, Galen, Rannek, and some others got their first look at the
pursuing force. It seemed to be trolls exclusively, for nowhere among the
approaching mob did they see the treelike appendages of bog blokes. Still,
there were more than a few trolls down there, including several very large
specimens and some of those sporting more than one head.
Rannek knew that they had done right in retreating, as he had suggested
many hours before. Any satisfaction he took from that was lost, though, in his
fears that they would not be able to outrun that monstrous force.
"Keep them moving as fast as possible," Galen Firth ordered, his voice
grave and full of similar fears, Rannek knew, whether Galen would admit them
or not—even to himself. "Have we found those tunnels yet?"
"We've found some tunnels," one of the other men explained. "We do not
know how deep they run."
Galen Firth pinched his lip between his thumb and index finger.
"And if we run in before we know for certain, and run into a dead end...."
the man went on.
"Hurry, then," Galen ordered. "Stretch lines of scouts into the tunnel. We
seek one that will loop around and bring us out behind our pursuing enemies.
We will have to either run by or run in—there will be no time to dally!"
The man nodded and rushed away.
Galen turned to regard Rannek.
"And so you believe that you were right," he said.
"For what that's worth," Rannek replied. "It does not matter." He looked
back at the pursuing force, drawing Galen's eyes with his own. "Never could
we have anticipated such dogged pursuit from an enemy as chaotic and
undisciplined as trolls! In all my years..."
"Your years are not all that long," Galen reminded him. "Thus were you
fooled that night you headed the watch."
"As you were fooled now into thinking the pursuit would not come," Rannek
shot back, but the words sounded feeble even to him, and certainly Galen's
smug expression did little to give him any thought that he had stung the man.
"I welcome their pursuit," Galen said. "If I'm surprised, it is pleasantly so.
We run them off, farther from Nesme. When we get behind our walls once
more, we will find the time we need to fortify our defenses."
"Unless there are more trolls waiting for us there."

"Your failure has led you to a place where you overestimate our enemy,
Rannek. They are trolls. Stupid and vicious, and little more. They have shown
perseverance beyond expectation, but it will not hold."
Galen gave a snort and started away, but Rannek grabbed him by the arm.
The Rider turned on him angrily.
"You would gamble the lives of all these people on that proposition?"
Rannek asked.
"Our entire existence in Nesme has been a gamble—for centuries," Galen
replied. "It is what we do. It is the way we live."
"Or the way we die?"
"So be it."
Galen yanked himself free of Rannek's grasp. He stared at the man a while
longer, then turned around and started shouting orders to those around him.
He was cut short, though, almost immediately, for somewhere among the
lines of refugees, a man shouted, "The Axe! The Axe of Mirabar is come!"
"All praise Mirabar!" another shouted, and the cheer was taken up across
the gathering.
Rannek and Galen Firth charged through the throng, crossing the crowd to
get a view of the source of the commotion.
Dwarves, dozens and dozens of dwarves, marched toward them, many of
them bearing the black axe of Mirabar on their shields. They moved in tight
and disciplined formation, their ranks holding steady as they crossed the
broken ground in their determined advance.
"Not of Mirabar," one scout explained to Galen, huffing and puffing with
every word, for he had run all the way back to precede the newcomers. "More
of Clan Battlehammer, they claim to be."
"They wear the emblem of Mirabar's famed Axe," said Galen.
"And so they once were," the scout explained. He stopped and stepped
aside, watching with the others as the dwarves closed.
A pair of battle-worn dwarves approached, one with a thick black beard and
the other ancient and one of the ugliest dwarves either man had ever seen.
He was shorter and wider than his companion, with half his black beard torn
away and one eye missing. His ruddy, weathered face had seen the birth and
death of centuries, the humans easily surmised. The pair approached Galen's
position, guided by yet another of the scouts the Nesmians had sent forth.
They walked up before the man and the younger dwarf dropped the head of
his heavy warhammer on the stone before him, then leaned on it heavily.
"Torgar Delzoun Hammerstriker of Clan Battlehammer at yer service," he
said. "And me friend Shingles."
"You wear the symbol of Mirabar, good Torgar," said Galen. "And glad we
are to have your service."
"We were of Mirabar," Shingles offered. "We left to serve a king of more
generous heart. And so ye see the end of that, for here we are, to support ye
and support General Dagna, who came out here with ye."
Several of the nearby humans looked to each other with concern, expres-
sions that were not lost on the dwarves.
"I will tell you of Dagna's fall when the time permits a tale that would do him
justice," Galen Firth said, straightening his shoulders. "For now, our enemies
close fast from behind. Trolls—many trolls."
Most of the dwarves mumbled to each other about "Dagna's fall," but

Torgar and Shingles kept their expressions stoic.
"Then let's get to the tunnels," Torgar decided. "Me and me boys'll do better
against the gangly brutes when they're bending low so as not to bump their
ugly heads on the ceiling."
"We fight them there and push them back," Galen agreed. "Perhaps we can
break them and gain a path through their lines."
"Through?" asked Torgar. "Mithral Hall's at the other end of them tunnels,
and that's where we're for."
"We have word that Silverymoon will soon join in the fight," Galen
explained, and no one around him dared point out that he was stretching the
truth quite a bit. "Now is the day of our victory, when Nesme will be restored
and the region secured!"
The dwarves both looked at him curiously for a moment, then looked to
each other and just shrugged.
"Not to matter," Shingles said to Torgar. "Either choice we're to make, we're
to make it from the tunnels."
"So to the tunnels we go," the other dwarf agreed.
*
*
*
*
*
"Side run's open!" came a relayed shout along the dwarven line.
"Torch 'em!" Shingles cried.
Twenty dwarves from the second rank rushed forward, flaming torches in
hand, and as one they threw the fiery brands over Shingles and the first line of
fighters, who were engaged heavily with the leading lines of troll pursuit.
They had run down a long tunnel that spread into a wider chamber, and
had made their stand at the funnel-like opening, allowing a score of dwarves
to stand abreast, where only a few trolls could come through to battle them.
The torchbearers aimed their flaming missiles at the narrower tunnel
entrance, where several pieces of seasoned kindling, soaked with lamp oil,
had been strategically placed.
The fires roared to life.
Trolls weren't afraid of much, but fire, which defeated their incredible
regenerative powers, ranked foremost among that short list.
The torches loosened the pursuit considerably, and Shingles put his line,
and those who had come behind, into a sudden, devastating charge, driving
back those few trolls that had been caught on the near side of the conflagra-
tion. A couple were forced back into the flames, while others were chopped
down and stabbed where they stood.
The dwarves broke and ran in perfect formation. The side passage had
been declared open, and the refugees were already well on their way.
Yet again, for the third time that afternoon, Torgar's boys had fended off the
stubborn troll pursuit.
The monsters would come on again, though, they all knew, and so those
dwarves leading the line of retreat were busy inspecting every intersection
and every chamber to see if they could find a suitable location for their next
inevitable stand.
From the rear defensive ranks of the human contingent, Rannek watched it
all with admiration and gratitude. He knew that Galen Firth was stewing about
it all, for they had already eschewed a route that likely would have put them
back outside ahead of the trolls, possibly with open ground to Nesme.
But it was Torgar, not Galen, who was in control. Rannek and all the folk of

Nesme understood that much. For after hearing the details of Dagna's fall,
Torgar had explained in no uncertain terms that the humans could run away
from the dwarven escort if they so chose, but they would do so at their own
risk.
"All glory to Dagna and Mithral Hall," Torgar had said to Galen and the
others after hearing the sad story. "He goes to join his son in the Halls of
Moradin, where a place of honor awaits."
"He tried to help us reclaim our home," Galen put in, and those words had
drawn a look from Torgar that dwarves often reserved for orcs alone.
"He saved yer foolish arse," Torgar retorted. "And if ye're choosing to try to
make that run again, then 'twas his mistake. But know ye this, Galen Firth o'
Nesme, Torgar and his boys ain't about to make that same mistake. Any
ground we're holding, we're holding with tunnels to Mithral Hall at our back,
don't ye doubt."
And that had been the end of it, and even overly proud Galen hadn't
argued beyond that, and hadn't said a word of rebuttal to the other Nesmian
warriors, either. Thus, Torgar had taken complete control, and had led them
on their desperate chase. They ran until pursuit forced a stand then they
shaped every encounter to be a quick-hitting deflection rather than a head on
battle.
Rannek was glad of that.

DIVERGING ROADS
"Are we to follow the commands of an orc?" a large, broad-shouldered frost
giant named Urulha asked Gerti as the procession of nearly a hundred of the
behemoths made its way around the northern slopes of Fourthpeak, heading
east for the Surbrin.
"Commands?" Gerti asked. "I heard no commands. Only a request."
"Are they not one and the same, if you adhere to the request?"
Gerti laughed, a surprisingly delicate sound coming from a giantess, and
she put her slender hand on Urulha's massive shoulder. She knew that she
had to walk gently with him. Urulha had been one of her father's closest
advisors and most trusted guards. And Gerti's father, the renowned Orel the
Grayhand still cast a long shadow, though the imposing jarl hadn't been seen
among the frost giants in many months, and few thought he would ever leave
his private chambers. By all reports, Orel was certainly on his deathbed, and
as his sole heir, Gerti stood to inherit Shining White and all his treasures, and
the allegiance of his formidable giant forces.
That last benefit of Orel's death would prove the most important and the
most tentative, Princess Gerti had known for some time. If a coup rose
against her, led by one of the many opportunistic giants who had climbed
Orel's hierarchical ladder, then the result, at best, would be a split of the
nearly unified forces. That was something Gerti most certainly did not want.
She was a formidable force all her own, skilled with her sword and with her
arcane magic. Gerti could bring the power of the elements down upon any
who dared stand against her, could blast them with lightning, fire, and storms
of pelting ice. But just putting her hand on Urulha's massive shoulder
reminded her pointedly that sometimes magic simply would not be enough.
"It is in our interest, at present at least, that Obould succeed," she
explained. "If his army were to shatter now, who would stop the forces of
Mithral Hall, Felbarr, Adbar, Silverymoon, Everlund, Sundabar, perhaps
Mirabar, and who knows what other nation, from pressing the war right to our
doorstep at Shining White? No, my good Urulha, Obould is the buffer we need
against the pesky dwarves and humans. Let his thousands swarm and die,
but slowly."
"I have grown weary of this campaign," Urulha admitted. "I have seen a
score and more of my kin killed, and we know not the disposition of our
brethren along the Surbrin. Might the dwarves of Felbarr have already
crossed? Might another twenty of our kin lay dead at the smelly feet of the
bearded creatures?"
"That has not happened," Gerti assured him.
"You do not know that."
Gerti conceded that point with a nod and a shrug. "We will go and see.
Some of us, at least."
That surprising caveat got Urulha's attention and he turned his huge head,
with its light blue skin and brighter blue eyes, to regard Gerti more directly.
Gerti returned his curious look with a coy one of her own, noticing then that
Urulha was quite a handsome creature for an older giant. His hair was long,
pulled back into a ponytail that left him a fairly sharp peak up high on his
forehead, his hairline receding. His features were still strong, though, with

high cheekbones and a very sharp and definitive nose. It occurred to Gerti
that if her verbal persuasion did not prove sufficient to keep Urulha in line, she
could employ her other ample charms to gain the same effect, and that, best
of all, it would not be such an unpleasant thing.
"Some, my friend," she said quietly, letting her fingers trace up closer to the
base of the large giant's thick neck, even moving her fingertips to brush the
bare skin above his chain mail tunic. "We will send a patrol to the river—half
our number—to look in on our missing friends, and to begin collecting them.
Slowly, we will rotate the force north and back home. Slowly, I say, so that
Obould will not think our movement an outright desertion. He expects that he
will need to secure the river on his own, anyway, and with his numbers, it
should be of little effort to convince him that he does not need a few giants.
"I wish to hold the alliance, you see," she went on. "I do not know what the
response from the communities of our enemies will yet be, but I do not wish to
do battle with twenty thousand orcs. Twenty thousand?" she asked with a
snicker. "Or is his number twice or thrice that by now?"
"The orcs breed like vermin, like the mice in the field or the centipedes that
infest our homes," said Urulha.
"Similar intelligence, one might surmise," said Gerti as her fingers
continued to play along her companion's neck, and she was glad to feel the
tenseness ease from Urulha's taut muscles, and to see the first hints of a
smile widen on his handsome face.
"It is even possible that our usual enemies will come to see a potential
alliance with us," Gerti added.
Urulha scowled at the notion. "Dwarves? You believe the dwarves of
Mithral Hall, Citadel Felbarr, or Citadel Adbar will agree to work in concert with
us? Do you believe that Bruenor Battlehammer and his friends will forget the
bombardment that tumbled a tower upon them? They know who swung the
ram that breached their western door. They know that no orc could have
brought such force to bear."
"And they know they might soon be out of options," said Gerti. "Obould will
dig in and fortify throughout the winter, and I doubt that our enemies will find a
way to strike at him before the snows have melted. By then...."
"You do not believe that Silverymoon, Everlund, and the three dwarven
kingdoms can dislodge orcs?"
Gerti took his incredulity in stride. "Twenty thousand orcs?" she whispered.
"Forty thousand? Sixty thousand? And behind fortified walls on the high
ground?"
"And so Gerti will offer to aid the countering forces of peoples long our
enemies?" Urulha asked.
Gerti was quick to offer a pose that showed she was far from making any
such judgment.
"I hold open the possibility of gain for my people," she explained. "Obould is
no ally to us. He never was. We tolerated him because he was amusing."
"Perhaps he feels the same way toward us."
Again the disciplined Gerti managed to let the too-accurate-for-comfort
comment slide off her large shoulders. She knew that she had to walk a fine
line with all of her people as they made their way back to Shining White. Her
giants and Obould had achieved victory in their press to the south, but for the
frost giants had there been any real gain? Obould had achieved all he had

apparently desired. He had gained a strong foothold in the lands of the
humans and dwarves. Even more important and impressive, his call to war
had brought forth and united many orc tribes, which he had brought into his
powerful grasp. But the army, for all its gains, had found no tangible, transfer-
able plunder. They had not captured Mithral Hall and its treasuries.
Gerti's giants were not like the minions of Obould. Frost giants were not
stupid orcs. Winning the field was enough for the orcs, even if they lost five
times the number of enemies killed. Gerti's people would demand of her that
she show them why their march south had been worth the price of dozens of
giants' lives.
Gerti looked at the line ahead, to the pegasus. Yes, there was a trophy
worthy of Shining White! She would parade the equine creature before her
people often, she decided. She would remind them of the benefits of removing
the pesky Withegroo and the folk of Shallows. She would explain to them how
much more secure their comfortable homeland was now that the dwarves and
humans had been pushed so far south.
It was, the giantess realized, a start.

He was surprised by the softness as his consciousness began to creep
forth from the darkness, for the dwarf had always expected the Halls of
Moradin to be warm with fires but as hard as stone. Nikwillig stirred and
shifted, and felt his shoulder sink into the thick blanket. He heard the crackle
of leaves and twigs beneath him.
The dwarf's eyes popped open, then he squeezed them shut immediately
against the blinding sting of daylight.
In that instant of sight, that snapshot of his surroundings, Nikwillig realized
that he was in a thick deciduous forest and as he considered that, the poor
dwarf became even more confused. For there were no forests near where he
fell, and the last thing he ever expected in the Halls of Moradin were trees and
open sky.
"En tu il be-inway," he heard, a soft melodic voice that he knew to be an
elf's.
Nikwillig kept his eyes closed as he played the words over and over in his
jumbled thoughts. A merchant of Felbarr, Nikwillig often dealt with folk of other
races, including elves.
"Be-inway?" he mouthed, then, "Awake. En tu il bi-inway . . . he is awake."
An elf was talking about him, he knew, and he slowly let his eyelids rise,
acclimating himself to the light as he went. He stretched a bit and a groan
escaped him as he tried to turn in the direction of the voice.
The dwarf closed his eyes again and settled back, took a deep breath to let
the pain flow out of him, then opened his eyes once more—and was surprised
to find himself completely surrounded by elves, pale of skin and stern of face.
"You are awake?" one asked him, speaking the common language of trade.
"A bit of a surprise if I be," Nikwillig answered, his voice cracking repeatedly
as it crossed through his parched throat. "Goblins got poor old Nikwillig good."
"The goblins are all dead," the elf on his right explained. That elf, appar-
ently the leader, waved all but one of the others away, then bent low so that
Nikwillig could better view him. He had straight black hair and dark blue eyes,
which seemed very close together to the dwarf. The elf's angular eyebrows
pinched together almost as one, like a dark V above his narrow nose.

"And we have tended your wounds," he went on in a voice that seemed
strangely calm and reassuring, given his visage. "You will recover, good
dwarf."
"Ye pulled me out o' there?" Nikwillig asked. "Them goblins had me caught
at the river and . . ."
"We shot them dead to a goblin," the elf assured him.
"And who ye be?" asked Nikwillig. "And who be 'we'?"
"I am Hyaline of the Moonwood, and this is Althelennia. We crossed the
river in search of two of our own. Perhaps you of Mithral Hall have seen
them?"
"I ain't of Mithral Hall, but of Citadel Felbarr," Nikwillig informed them, and
he took Hralien's offered hand and allowed the elf to help him up gingerly into
a sitting position. "Got whacked by that Obould beast, and was Bruenor that
rescued me and me friend Tred. Seen nothing of yer friends, sorry to say."
The two elves exchanged glances.
"They would be upon great flying horses," Althelennia added. "Perhaps you
have seen them from afar, high in the sky."
"Ah, them two," said Nikwillig, and both elves leaned in eagerly. "Nope,
ain't seen them, but I heard of them from the Bouldershoulder brothers who
came through yer wood on the way to Mithral Hall."
The crestfallen elves swayed back.
"And the hall remains in Bruenor's hands?" asked Hralien at the very same
time that Althelennia inquired about "a great fire that we saw leap into the
western sky."
"Aye and aye," said the dwarf. "Gnomish fire, and one to make a dragon
proud."
"You have much to tell us, good dwarf," said Hralien.
"Seems I'm owin' ye that much at least," Nikwillig agreed.
He stretched a bit more, cracked his knuckles, his neck, and his shoulders
a few times, and settled in, putting his back to a nearby tree. Then he told
them his tale, from his march with the caravan out of Citadel Felbarr those
tendays before, to the disastrous ambush, and his aimless wandering, injured
and hungry, with Tred. He told them of the generosity of the humans and the
kindness of Bruenor Battlehammer, who found the pair as he was returning
home to be crowned King of Mithral Hall once more.
He told them of Shallows and the daring rescue, and of the unexpected
help from Mirabarran dwarves, moving to join their Battlehammer kin. He
described the standoff above Keeper's Dale, going into great detail in painting
a mental image of the piled orc bodies.
Through it all, the elves remained completely attentive, expressions
impassive, absorbing every word. They showed no emotion, even when
Nikwillig jumped suddenly as he described the explosion Nanfoodle had
brought about, a blast so complete that it had utterly decapitated a mountain
spur.
"And that's where it stands, last I noted," Nikwillig finished. "Obould put
Bruenor in his hole in the west, and trolls, orcs, and giants put Bruenor in his
hole in the east. Mithral Hall's a lone jewel in a pile o' leaden critters."
The two elves looked at each other.
Their expressions did not comfort the battered dwarf.

After more than a tenday, Drizzt and Innovindil found themselves along the
higher foothills of the Spine of the World. Gerti and her nearly three-score
giants had taken a meandering path back to the higher ground, but they had
moved swiftly along that winding road. The journey had given the two elves a
good view of the work along the Surbrin, and what they had seen had not
been reassuring. All along the bank, particularly at every known ford and
every other area that seemed possible for crossing, fortifications had been
built and were being improved on a continual basis.
The pair tried to focus on their present mission to rescue Sunrise, but it was
no easy task, especially for Innovindil, who wondered aloud and often if she
should divert her course and cross the river from on high to warn her kinfolk.
But of course, the elves of the Moonwood carefully monitored the Surbrin,
and they already knew what was afoot, she had to believe.
So she had kept to the course with Drizzt, the two of them holding close
watch on Gerti's progress and looking for some opening where they could get
to Sunrise. In all that time, though, no such chance had presented itself.
Once they were in the mountains, in more broken terrain, keeping up with
the giants grew more difficult. On several occasions, Drizzt had brought in
Guenhwyvar to run fast ahead and locate the band just to ensure that he and
Innovindil were keeping some pace, at least.
"It is folly, I fear," Innovindil said to Drizzt as they camped one night in the
shadows of a shallow overhang, with just enough cover for Drizzt to chance a
small fire. Normally, he would not have done so, but though autumn had
barely begun down in the south near Mithral Hall, up there, at so high an
elevation, the wind was already carrying its wintry bite. "And while we run the
fool's errand my people and your dwarves are under siege."
"You will not desert Sunrise while a hope remains," Drizzt replied with a wry
grin, his expression as much as his words acting as a rather uncomplimentary
mirror to the elf lass.
"You are just frustrated," Drizzt added.
"And you are not?"
"Of course I am. I am frustrated, I am angry, I am sad, and I want nothing
more than to take Obould's ugly head from his shoulders."
"And how do you fight past such emotions, Drizzt Do'Urden?"
Drizzt paused before he answered, for he saw a shift in Innovindil's eyes as
she asked that question, and noted a distinct shift in her tone. She was asking
him as much for his own sake as for hers, he realized. So many times in their
tendays together, Innovindil had turned to Drizzt and said something along the
lines of, "Do you know what it is to be an elf, Drizzt Do'Urden?" Clearly, she
expected to be a bit of a mentor to him concerning the elf experience, and
they were lessons he was glad to learn. He noticed too, for the first time with
her last question, that whenever Innovindil began her subtle tutoring, she
finished the question by referring to him with his full name.
"In moments of reflection," he answered. "At sunrise, mostly, I talk to myself
aloud. No doubt anyone listening would think me insane, but there is
something about saying the words, about speaking my fears and pain and
guilt aloud that helps me to work through these often irrational emotions."
"Irrational?"
"My racist beliefs about my own kind," Drizzt replied. "My dedication to
what I know is right. My pain at the loss of a friend, or even of one enemy."

"Ellifain."
"Yes."
"You were not to blame."
"I know that. Of course I do. Had I known it was Ellifain, I would have tried
to dissuade her, or to defeat her in a non-lethal manner. I know that she
brought her death upon herself. But it is still sad, and still a painful thing to
me."
"And you feel guilt?"
"Some," Drizzt admitted.
Innovindil stood up across the way and walked around the campfire, then
knelt before the seated Drizzt. She brought a hand up and gently touched his
face.
"You feel guilt because you are possessed of a gentle nature, Drizzt
Do'Urden. As am I, as was Tarathiel, as are most of elvenkind, though we do
well to hide those traits from others. Our conscience is our salvation. Our
questioning of everything, of right and wrong, of action and consequence, is
what defines our purpose. And do not be fooled, in a lifetime that will last
centuries, some sense of purpose is often all you have."
How well Drizzt had known that truth.
"You speak your thoughts after the fact?" Innovindil asked. "You take your
experiences and play them out before you, that you might consider your own
actions and feelings in the glaring and revealing light of hindsight?"
"Sometimes."
"And through this process, does Drizzt internalize the lessons he has
learned? Do you, in reaffirming your actions, gain some confidence should a
similar situation arise?"
The question had Drizzt leaning back for a minute. He had to believe that
Innovindil had hit upon something. Drizzt had resolved many of his internal
struggles through his personal discussions, had come almost full circle, so he
believed—until the disaster at Shallows.
He looked back at Innovindil, and noticed that she had moved very close to
him. He could feel the warmth of her breath. Her golden hair seemed so soft
in that moment, backlit by the fire, almost as if she was aglow. Her eyes
seemed so dark and mysterious, but so full of intensity.
She reached up and stroked his face gently, and Drizzt felt his blood rush-
ing. He tried hard to control his trembling.
"I think you a gentle and beautiful soul, Drizzt Do'Urden," she said. "I
understand better this difficult road you have traveled, and admire your
dedication."
"So you believe now that I know what it is to be an elf?" Drizzt asked, more
to alleviate the sudden tension he was feeling, to lighten the mood, than
anything else.
But Innovindil didn't let him go so easily.
"No," she said. "You have half the equation, the half that takes care to
anticipate the long-term course of things. You reflect and worry, ask yourself
to examine your actions honestly, and demand of yourself honest answers,
and that is no small thing. Young elves react and examine, and along that
honest road of self-evaluation, you will one day come to react to whatever is
found before you in full confidence that you are doing right."
Drizzt leaned back just a bit as Innovindil continued to press forward, so

that her face was barely an inch from his own.
"And the half I have not learned?" he asked, afraid his voice would crack
with each word.
In response, Innovindil pressed in closer and kissed him.
Drizzt didn't know how to respond. He sat there passively for a long while,
feeling the softness of her lips and tongue, her hand brushing his neck, and
her lithe body as she pressed in closer to him. Blood rushed through him and
the world seemed as if it was spinning, and Drizzt stopped even trying to think
and just... felt.
He began to kiss Innovindil back and his hands started to move around her.
He heard a soft moan escape his own lips and was hardly even conscious of
it.
Innovindil broke the kiss suddenly and fell back, her arms coming out to
hold Drizzt from pursuing. She looked at Drizzt curiously for just a moment,
then asked, "What if she is alive?"
Drizzt tried to question the sudden shift, but as her inquiry hit him, his
response was more stutter than words.
"If you knew that Catti-brie was alive, then would you wish to continue
this?" Innovindil asked, and she might as well have added, "Drizzt Do'Urden,"
to the end of the question.
Drizzt's mind spun in circles. He managed to stammer, "B-but..."
"Ah, Drizzt Do'Urden," Innovindil said. She twirled, rising gracefully to her
feet. "You spend far too much time in complete control. You consider the
future with every move."
"Is that what it is to be an elf?" Drizzt asked, his voice dripping with
sarcasm.
"It might be," Innovindil answered. She came forward again and bent low,
looking at Drizzt mischievously, but directly. "In your experience, stoicism is
what it is to be an elf. But letting go sometimes, my friend, that is what it is to
be alive."
She turned with a giggle and stepped away.
"You pulled back, not I," Drizzt reminded, and Innovindil turned on him
sharply.
"You didn't answer my question."
She was right and Drizzt knew it. He could only begin to imagine his torn
emotions had they gone through with the act.
"I have seen you reckless in battle," Innovindil went on. "But in love? In life?
With your scimitars, you will take a chance against a giant or ten! But with
your heart, are you nearly as brave? You will cry out in anger against
goblinkind, but will you dare cry out in passion?"
Drizzt didn't answer, because he didn't have an answer. He looked down
and gave a self-deprecating chuckle, and was surprised when Innovindil sat
down again beside him and comfortably put her arm around his shoulders.
"I am alone," the female elf said. "My lover is gone and my heart is empty.
What I need now is a friend. Are you that friend?"
Drizzt leaned over and kissed her, but on the cheek.
"Happily so," he answered. "But am I your friend or your student, when you
so freely play with my emotions?"
Innovindil assumed a pensive posture and a moment later answered, "I
hope you will learn from my experiences, as I hope to learn from yours. I know

that my life is enriched because of your companionship these last tendays. I
hope that you can say the same."
Drizzt knew he didn't even have to answer that question. He put his arm
around Innovindil and pulled her close. They sat there under the stars and let
the Reverie calm them.

REGROUPING
A pall hung over the audience chamber at Mithral Hall. The orcs had been
pushed out, the western entry seemingly secured. And because of their
cleverness and the explosive potions of Nanfoodle, few dwarves had fallen in
either the initial assault that had brought the orcs into the hall or the
counterattack that had pushed them out.
But word had come from the south, both hopeful and tragic.
Bruenor Battlehammer stood tall in front of his throne then, commanding
the attention of all, from the guards lining the room to the many citizens and
refugees standing by the doors awaiting their audience with the king.
To the side of Bruenor stood Cordio and Stumpet, the two principle clerics
of the clan. Bruenor motioned to them, and Cordio quickly dipped a large mug
in the barrel of dwarven holy water, a very sweet honey mead. Attendants all
over the hall scrambled to disseminate the drink, so that everyone in
attendance, even the three non-dwarves—Regis, Wulfgar, and Nanfoodle—
had mug in hand when Bruenor raised his in toast.
"And so does General Dagna Waybeard of Adbar and Mithral Hall join his
son in the Halls of Moradin," Bruenor proclaimed. "To Dagna and to all who
served well with him. They gave their lives in defense of neighbors and in
battle with smelly trolls." He paused, then raised his voice to a shout as he
finished, "A good way to die!"
"A good way to die!" came the thunderous response.
Bruenor drained his entire mug in one great gulp, then tossed it back to
Cordio and fell back into his seat.
"The news was not all bad," said Banak Brawnanvil, sitting at his side in a
specially constructed chair to accommodate legs that would no longer support
him.
"Yeah?" said Bruenor.
"Alustriel was seen at the fight," said Banak. "No small thing, that."
Bruenor looked to the young courier who had brought the news from the
south. When Bruenor had sent out the Mirabarran dwarves, he had stretched
a line of communication all the way from Mithral Hall, a relay team of couriers
so that news would flow back quickly. With the orcs back out of Mithral Hall,
the dwarf king expected a very fluid situation and had no intention of being
caught by surprise from any direction.
"Alustriel was there?" he pressed the courier. "Or we're thinking she was
there?"
"Oh, they seen her, me king," said the dwarf, "come in on a flaming chariot,
down from the sky in a ball of fire!"
"Then how did they know it to be her, through the veil of flames?" Nan-
foodle dared to ask. He blanched and fell back, showing everyone that he was
merely thinking aloud.
"Aye, that's Alustriel," Bruenor assured the gnome and everyone else. "I'm
knowing a thing or two about the Lady of Silverymoon's fiery chariot."
That brought chuckles from the others around Bruenor, especially from the
normally quiet Wulfgar, who had witnessed first-hand Bruenor's piloting of
Alustriel's magical cart. Far to the south and out on the sea, Bruenor had
brought Alustriel's conjured chariot of flame streaking across the deck of a

pirate ship, to ultimate disaster—for the pirates, of course.
"So she's knowing that a fight's afoot," Bruenor said, and he looked to the
emissary from another outside kingdom.
"Citadel Felbarr would surely've telled her," Jackonray Broadbelt agreed.
"We've got a good flow o' runners to Silverymoon and to Sundabar. Alustriel's
knowing what's afoot, to be sure, if she joined in the fight in the south."
"But will she come on to the north with her forces, as she did when the
drow marched against Mithral Hall?" asked Wulfgar.
"Might be that we should send Rumblebelly to her to find out," Bruenor
said, throwing a wink at the barbarian as they both turned their looks over
Regis.
The halfling didn't catch it, obviously, for he sat very still and very quiet,
head down.
Bruenor studied him for just a moment, and recognized the source of his
apparent dismay. "What'd'ye think, Rumblebelly?" he bellowed. "Ye think ye
might use yer ruby there on Alustriel and get all o' Silverymoon marching to
help us?"
Regis looked up at him and shrugged, and his eyes widened as he appar-
ently only then registered the absurd question.
"Bah, sit yerself back," Bruenor said with a laugh. "Ye won't go using that
magical pendant o' yers on the likes of Alustriel!"
Everyone around the dwarf king joined in the laughter, but Bruenor's
expression took on a more serious look as soon as he had the cover of the
mirth.
"But we'll be needin' to talk about Silverymoon, and yerself and me girl're
the two who're best knowing the place. Ye go and sit with her, Rumblebelly. I'll
get by to talk with ye two as soon as I'm done here."
Regis's relief at being dismissed from the large gathering was evident to
anyone who bothered to glance his way. He nodded and hopped up, then
swiftly walked out of the room, even breaking into a trot as he reached the
doorway.
*

*
*
Regis found Catti-brie sitting up in bed, a sizable plate of food set out
before her. Her smile at him as he entered was among the sweetest sights he
had ever known, for it was full of eagerness and acceptance. It was a smile
that promised better days and another fight—something that Regis had feared
Catti-brie would never be able to hope for again.
"Stumpet and Cordio have been hard at work, I see," he remarked as he
moved into the room and pulled up a small chair to sit beside the woman's
bed.
"And Moradin's been good enough to hear their call, for healing the likes of
me. Do ye ... you think perhaps I have more dwarf in me than either of us are
knowing?"
The halfling found her answer somewhat ironic, given her own mid-
sentence correction of her dwarven dialect.
"When do you think you'll be out of here?"
"I'll be out of bed in less than a tenday," Catti-brie answered. "I'll be fighting
again in two—sooner if I find I'm needed, don't you doubt."
Regis looked at her skeptically. "Is that your guess or Cordio's?"
Catti-brie waved the question away and went back to eating, and so Regis

understood that the priests had likely given estimates of at least a month.
As she finished with one piece of fruit, Catti-brie leaned over the opposite
side of the bed, where a pail sat for the refuse. When she did, the movement
caused the blanket to ride up on the side closest Regis, affording him a clear
view of her torn hip and upper leg.
The woman settled back before the halfling could replace his pained
expression.
"The rock hit you good," Regis said, knowing there was no way to avoid it.
Catti-brie tucked the blanket back down under her side. "I'm fortunate that it
bounced off the ledge and the wall first," she admitted.
"How serious was the damage?"
Catti-brie's face went blank.
Regis met that stare and pressed on, "How far will you recover, do they
say? That hip was crushed, the muscles torn through. Will you walk again?"
"Yes."
"Will you run?"
The woman paused a bit longer, her face growing tight. "Yes."
It was an answer more of determination than expectation, Regis knew. He
let it go and stiffened his resolve against the wave of pity that wanted to flood
out of him. He knew very well that Catti-brie would hear none of that.
"Word has come from the south," Regis said. "Lady Alustriel has joined the
fight, albeit briefly."
"But Dagna has fallen," Catti-brie replied, surprising Regis.
"Word of such things passes quickly through a dwarven community," she
explained.
Regis quieted for a few moments so that they could both offer a silent
prayer for the soul of the fallen dwarf.
"Do you think it will ever be the same?" he asked.
"I don't," replied Catti-brie, and the halfling's head snapped up, for that was
not precisely the answer he had expected and wanted from the normally
optimistic woman. "As it was not the same when we drove the dark elves back
underground. This fight's sure to leave a scar, my friend."
Regis considered that for a moment, then nodded his agreement. "Obould
stuck it in deep, and stuck it hard," he said. "Bruenor will be glad when he has
that one's head piked out beyond the western door."
"It is not all bad, these changes .. ." said Catti-brie.
"Torgar's here with his boys," Regis was quick to put in. "And we're talking
with Felbarr as never before!"
"Aye," said the woman. "And sometimes tragedy is the catalyst for those
who are left behind, to change in ways they knew they should, but never
found the courage to grasp."
Something about her tone and the faraway look in her eye told the halfling
that many things were stirring behind the blue eyes of Catti-brie, and not all of
them in accordance to that which he and the others would normally expect of
her.
"We're trying to get some scouts out and about, up through the chimneys,"
he said. "We're hoping for word from Drizzt."
Catti-brie's face twitched a bit at the mention of the drow. Not a grimace,
but enough of a movement to tell Regis that he had hit a sensitive subject.
Again Regis quickly changed the topic. What use in speculating about

Drizzt, after all, when none of them knew anything definite, though all of them
held the same hopes? Instead Regis talked of better days to come, of the
inevitable defeat of Obould and his stupid orcs and the good times they'd
have with the brave dwarves of Mirabar, the newest members of the clan. He
talked of Tred and Citadel Felbarr, and promises of allegiance that ran deep
on both sides of the Underdark tunnels. He talked of Ivan and Pikel, and of
the Spirit Soaring, their cathedral home set high in the Snowflake Mountains
above the town of Carradoon on Impresk Lake. He would go and see that
wondrous place, he prompted repeatedly, drawing smiles from Catti-brie, and
finally coaxing her into talking about it, for she and Drizzt had once visited
Cadderly and Danica.
After an hour or so, there came a sharp knock on the door, and Bruenor
came bounding in.
"Word's in from Felbarr," he announced before he even bothered to say
hello. "Jackonray's runners come back with the news that Emerus Warcrown's
marching!"
"They will arrive through the eastern tunnels?" Regis asked. "We must set
a proper feast for a visiting king."
"Ain't about food this time, Rumblebelly," said Bruenor. "And not through
any tunnels. King Emerus's got his boys spilling out aboveground. A great
force, marching to the River Surbrin. Already their front runners are setting up
camp at Winter Edge, just across the river. Townsfolk there ain't never had
such company as they're seeing today!"
"You're breaking out the eastern door," Catti-brie said.
"We're crossing Garumn's Gorge with everything we've got," Bruenor
replied, referring to the cavern and ravine that separated the eastern end of
Mithral Hall from the rest of the complex. "We'll blow the side o' the mountain
away before us, and come out in such a rush that them stupid orcs'll be
jumping into the river to get away from us!"
"And we'll wave at each other across the river?" Regis remarked.
Bruenor scowled at him and said, "We're gonna set a hold on our side, and
smash those orcs back to the north. Emerus is coming across—they're build-
ing the boats as they march. From the eastern doors to the river will become a
part of Mithral Hall, walled and strong, and with a bridge that'll cross over and
give our growing allies a clean route to join in the fight."
The bold plan stole any quips from Regis, and had both he and Catti-brie
sitting quietly attentive.
"How long?" the halfling finally managed to ask.
"Three days," said Bruenor, and Regis's jaw dropped open.
"I'll be ready to go," Catti-brie remarked, and both dwarf and halfling turned
to her in surprise.
"No ye won't," said her father. "Already been talking to Cordio and Stumpet.
This is one ye're missing, girl. Ye get yerself healthy and ready to fight. We'll
be needing ye, don't ye doubt, when we've got the hold and're trying to get the
damn bridge built. Yer bow on a tower's worth a legion of ground fighters to
me."
"Ye're not keeping me out o' the fight!" Catti-brie argued.
Regis nearly giggled at how dwarflike the woman suddenly seemed when
her ire went up.
"No, I'm not," Bruenor agreed. "It's yer wound that's doing that. Ye can't

even stand, ye unbearded girl gnome."
"I will stand!"
"And ye'll hobble," said Bruenor. "And ye'll have me and me boy Wulfgar,
and Rumblebelly there, looking back for ye as often as we're looking ahead at
the damned orcs!"
Catti-brie, sitting so bolt upright then that she was leaning forward at
Bruenor, started to argue, but her words dissipated as she seemed to melt
beck into her pillows. The intensity didn't leave her eyes—she so dearly
wanted to fight—but it was clear that Bruenor's appeal to her on the grounds
of how her stubbornness would affect those she loved had done the trick.
"Ye get well," Bruenor said quietly. "I promise ye girl that there'll be plenty
more orcs looking for an arrow when ye're ready to come back in."
"What do you need me to do?" Regis asked.
"Ye stick with Jackonray," the dwarf king instructed. "Ye're me eyes and
ears for Felbarr's worries. And I might be needing ye to look in on Nanfoodle
and them Bouldershoulders, to tell me straight and without the gnome's wind-
ing words and Pikel's 'Boom!' what's really what in their progress on opening
up that durned door. Them giants've put a hunnerd tons o' rock over them
doors when we closed them, and we're needing to break through fast and
strong to drive right to the Surbrin."
Regis nodded and hopped up, starting out of the room. He skidded to an
abrupt halt even as he began, though, and turned back to regard Catti-brie.
"Better days are coming," he said to her, and she smiled.
It was the smile of a friend, but one who, Regis understood, was beginning
to see the world through a different set of eyes.

15
DWARVEN FORTITUDE
The mob of trolls receded down the hill, sliding back into the bog and mist
to lick their wounds, and a great cheer went up along the line of warriors both
dwarf and human. They had held their ground again, for the third time that
day, stubbornly refusing to be pushed back into the tunnels that loomed as
black holes on the hillside behind them.
Torgar Hammerstriker watched the retreat with less excitement than his
fellows, and certainly with less enthusiasm than the almost-giddy humans.
Galen Firth ran along the human lines, proclaiming yet another victory in the
name of Nesme.
That was true, Torgar supposed, but could victory really be measured in
terms of temporary advances and retreats? They had held, all three fights,
because they had washed the leading trolls with a barrage of fiery logs.
Looking back at their supply of kindling, Torgar hoped they had enough fuel to
hold a fourth time. Victory? They were surrounded, with only the tunnels
offering them any chance of retreat. They couldn't get any more fuel for their
fires, and couldn't hope to break out through the ranks and ranks of powerful
trolls.
"They're grabbing at every reason to scream and punch their fists in the
air," Shingles McRuff remarked, coming up to stand beside his friend. "Can't
say I blame 'em, but I'm not seeing how many victory punches we got left."
"Without the fires, we can no hold," Torgar agreed quietly, so that only
Shingles could hear.
"A stubborn bunch o' trolls we got here," the old dwarf added. "They're
taking their time. They know we got nowhere to run except the holes."
"Any scouts come back dragging logs?" Torgar asked, for he had sent
several runners out along side tunnels, hoping to find an out of the way exit in
an area not patrolled by their enemies, in the hope that they might be able to
sneak in some more wood.
"Most're back, but none with any word that we've got trees to drag through.
We got what we got now, and nothing more."
"We'll hold them as long as we can," Torgar said, "but if we don't break
them in the next fight it'll be our last battle out here in the open."
"The boys're already practicing their retreat formations," Shingles assured
him.
Torgar looked across his defensive line, to their partners in the struggle. He
watched Galen Firth rousing his men once more, the tall man's seemingly
endless supply of energy flowing out in one prompting cheer after another.
"I'm not thinking our boys to be the trouble," Torgar said.
"That Galen's no less stubborn than the trolls," Shingles agreed. "Might be
a bit harder in convincing."
"So Dagna learned."
The two watched Galen's antics a bit longer, then Torgar added, "When we
get the last line o' fires out at the trolls, and they're not breaking, then we're
breaking ourselves, back into the tunnels. Galen and his boys can come if
they want, or they can stay out here and get swallowed. No arguing on this.
I'm not giving another o' Bruenor's war bands to Moradin to defend a human
too stubborn or too stupid to see what's plain afore him. He runs with us or he

stands alone."
It was a sobering order, and one that Torgar issued in a raised voice. There
was no compromise to be found, all those dwarves around him understood.
They would not make a gallant and futile last stand for the sake of Galen Firth
and the Nesmians.
"Ye telled that all to Galen, did ye?"
"Three times," said Torgar.
"He hearing ye?"
"Dumathoin knows," Torgar answered, invoking to the dwarf god known as
the Keeper of Secrets under the Mountains. "And Dumathoin ain't for telling.
But don't ye misunderstand our place here in the least. We're Bruenor's
southern line, and we're holding for Mithral Hall, not for Nesme. Them folks
want to come, we'll get them home to the halls or die trying. Them folks
choose to stay, and they're dying alone."
It couldn't be more clear than that. But neither Torgar nor Shingles believed
for a moment that even such a definitive stand would ring clearly enough in
the thick head of Galen Firth.
The trolls wasted little time in regrouping and coming on once more as
soon as the fires from the previous battle had died away. Their eagerness
only confirmed to Torgar that which he had suspected: they were not a stupid
bunch. They knew they had the dwarves on the edge of defeat, and knew well
that the fiery barrage could not continue indefinitely.
They charged up the hill, their long legs propelling them swiftly across the
sloping ground. They kept their lines loose and scattered—an obvious attempt
to present less of an opportunity for targeting fiery missiles.
"Ready yer throws!" Shingles ordered, and torches were put to brands
across the dwarven line.
"Not yet," Torgar whispered to his friend. "That's what they're expecting."
"And that's all we're giving."
But Torgar shook his head. "Not this time," he said. "Not yet."
The trolls closed ground. Down at the human end of the defensive line,
fiery brands went flying out.
But Torgar held his missiles. The trolls closed.
"Running wedge!" Torgar shouted, surprising all those around him, even
Shingles, who had fought so many times beside his fellow Mirabarran.
"Running wedge?" he asked.
"Send 'em out! All of 'em!" Torgar shouted. He lifted his warhammer high
and yelled, "With me, boys!"
Torgar leaped out from behind the stony barricade, Shingles at his side.
Without even bothering to look left or right, the dwarf charged down the hill,
confident that his boys would not let him down.
And that confidence was well placed. The dwarves poured out like water,
tumbling and rolling right back to their feet. In a few short strides, they were
already forming their running wedge and by the time they hit the leading trolls,
their formations were tight and well supported.
Torgar was, fittingly, first to engage. He led with a great sweep of his
hammer, and the troll standing before him hopped back out of range, then
came in fast behind the swipe. Apparently thinking it had the aggressive little
creature vulnerable, the troll opened wide its mouth and lunged forward to bite
at the dwarf.

Just as Torgar had hoped, for as his hammer cut the air before the beast,
the dwarf, who hadn't put half the weight behind that swing as he had made it
appear, yanked against the momentum and reversed the flow of the weapon,
bringing it in close. He slid one hand up the shaft of the hammer as he moved
one foot forward, turning almost sidelong to the troll, then thrust weapon's
head straight out into the diving mouth of the troll. Teeth splintered and Torgar
heard the crack of the troll's jawbone.
Not one to sit on his laurels, the dwarf yanked his hammer back, snapping
it into a roll over his trailing right shoulder and letting go with his left hand. He
caught the weapon down low with his left hand again as it came spinning up
over his head, then chopped down with all his strength, every muscle in his
body snapping, driving the hammerhead into the troll's brain.
The creature fell straight to the ground, squirming wildly, and Torgar just
kicked it in the face as he barreled by.

"Clever dwarves," Kaer'lic Suun Wett remarked.
With Tos'un beside her, the drow priestess stood on a high, tree-covered
bluff off to the side of the main action.
"They saw that the trolls were coming up widespread and gradually, trying
to draw out their flaming brands," Tos'un agreed.
"And now they've sent those leading decoys running or to the ground, and
not a brand have they thrown," said Kaer'lic.
The contrast between the dwarves' tactics and those of the humans stand-
ing beside them came crystal clear. While the dwarves had come out in a wild
charge, the humans held their ground, and had indeed launched many of their
fiery brands against the leading troll line.
"Proffit will exploit the human line and drive around to flank the dwarves,"
Kaer'lic said, pointing up that way.
Lower on the field, the disciplined dwarves had already turned around,
having scattered the leading trolls. Their wedge retreated without a pivot, so
that the dwarves at the trailing, widespread edges were the first back over the
wall, and those dwarves wasted no time in stoking the fires and readying the
barrage.
Kaer'lic growled and punched her fist into her open palm when she noted
Proffit's forces closing in on the dwarves' retreat. The trolls had been clearly
enraged by the brash charge of the bearded folk, and were rolling up the hill
behind the retreating point of the wedge, grouped tightly.
Before those running dwarves even got over the wall, the barrage began,
with dozens and dozens of burning logs spinning over the wall and out over
the dwarves. So closely grouped, the trolls took hit after hit, and when the
flames stuck on one, sending it up in a burst of fire, its close-standing
comrades, too, felt the fiery bite.
"Fools," Kaer'lic grunted, and the priestess began muttering the words of a
spell.
A moment later, a small geyser of water appeared among the trolls, dous-
ing fires and buying them some freedom from the dwarves' volley. Kaer'lic
finished her spell, muttered under her breath, and began to conjure some
more water. How much easier it all would have been, she thought, had Proffit
not allowed the pursuit and had instead sent the bulk of his minions at the
western, human end of the defensive line....

Even with the magical interference of an unexpected burst of water, the
firestorm proved considerable and highly effective, sending troll after troll up in
a blaze. But Torgar saw the truth of the situation before him. They had stung
their enemies again, but their time of advantage was over. Their fuel was
exhausted.
Torgar looked past the flames and flaming trolls, to the horde of enemies
behind, lurking down the hill, patiently waiting for the fires to diminish.
"Ye hold 'em here as long as ye can, but not a moment longer," Torgar
instructed Shingles.
"Where're ye going, then?" the old dwarf asked.
"Galen Firth's needing to hear this from me again, so that there's no
misunderstanding. We're going when we're going, and if they're not going,
then they're on their own."
"Tell him, and let him see yer eyes when ye tell him," Shingles said. "He's a
stubborn one."
"He'll be a dead one, then, and so be it."
Torgar patted his old friend on the shoulder and trotted along to the west,
moving behind his boys and encouraging them with every step. He soon
came to the human warriors, all readying their weapons, for their fires were
burning low out on the hill before them. The dwarf had little trouble finding
Galen Firth, for the man was up on a stone, shouting encouragement and
pumping his fist.
"Well fought!" he said to Torgar when he spotted the approaching dwarf. "A
brilliant move to go out and attack."
"Aye, and a smarter move's coming soon," Torgar replied. "The one that's
putting us back in the tunnels, not to come out again."
Galen's smile remained as he digested those words, coming down from the
stone. By the time he was standing before Torgar, that smile had been
replaced by a frown.
"They have not breached our line, nor shall they!"
"Strong words, well spoken," said Torgar. "And true in the first and hopeful
in the second. But if we're waiting to see if ye're right or wrong on what's to
come, and ye're wrong, then we're all dead."
"I long ago pledged my life to the defense of Nesme."
"Then stand yer ground if that's yer choice. I'm here to tell ye that me and
me boys're heading into the tunnels, and there we're to stay." Torgar was well
aware of the many frightened looks coming in at him from all around at that
proclamation.
"Ye'll want to tighten yer line, then," said Torgar. "If ye're that stubborn. Me
thinking's that ye should be going into the tunnels with us—yer old ones and
young afore us, and yer fighters beside us. That's me thinking, Galen Firth.
Take it as ye will."
The dwarf bowed and turned to leave.
"I beg you to stay," Galen surprised him by saying. "As General Dagna
decided to fight for Nesme."
Torgar turned on him sharply, his heavy eyebrows furrowing and shadow-
ing his dark eyes. "Dagna gave his life and his boys gave theirs because ye
were too stubborn to know when to run," he corrected. "It's not a mistake I'm
planning on making. Ye been told that we're going. Ye been invited to come.

Choice is yer own, and not mine."
The dwarf was quick in moving off, and when Galen called to him again, he
just continued on his way, muttering, "Durn fool," under his breath with every
step.
"Wait! Wait!" came a cry from behind, one that did turn Torgar around. He
saw another of the Nesme warriors, Rannek, running along the line toward
Galen Firth and pointing up at the sky. "Good dwarf, wait! It is Alustriel!
Alustriel has come again!"
Torgar followed his finger skyward, and there in the dark sky the dwarf saw
the streaking chariot of fire, coming in hard and fast.
At the same time, drumbeats filled the air, booming in from the southeast,
and horns began to blow.
"The Silver Guard!" one man cried. "The Silver Guard of Silverymoon is
come!"
Torgar looked at Galen Firth, who seemed as surprised as any, though he
had been saying that such help would arrive from the beginning.
"Our salvation is at hand, good dwarf," Galen said to him. "Stay, then, and
join in our great victory this night!"

"Lady Lolth, she's back," Tos'un groaned when he saw the telltale flash of
fire sweeping out of the night sky.
"Obould's worst nightmare," Kaer'lic replied. "Alustriel of Silverymoon. A
most formidable foe, so we have been told."
Tos'un glanced at Kaer'lic, the tone of her words showing him that she had
taken that reputation as a challenge. She was staring up at the chariot, eyes
sparkling, mouthing the words of a spell, her fingers tracing runes in the
empty air.
She timed her delivery perfectly, casting just as Alustriel soared past, not
so far overhead. The very air seemed to distort and crack around the flying
cart, a resonating, thunderous boom that shook the ground beneath Tos'un's
feet. Alustriel's disorientation manifested itself to the watching drow through
the erratic movements of the chariot, banking left and right, back and forth,
even veering sharply so that it seemed as if it might skid out of control in the
empty air.
Kaer'lic quickly cast a second spell, and a burst of conjured water inter-
cepted Alustriel's shaky path.
The chariot dipped, its flight disturbed. For a moment, the flames on the
magical horse team winked out, and down they all went.
"To the glory of Lolth," Tos'un said with a grin as the chariot plummeted.
The two anticipated a glorious wreckage, the enjoyable screams of horses
and driver alike, and indeed, when the flying carriage first hit, they realized
more disaster than even they could imagine.
But not in the manner they had expected.
The flames came alive again when Alustriel's chariot touched down,
bursting from the carriage and horses alike, and leaping out in a fireball that
swept out to the sides, then rolled up over the chariot as it charged along.
Both drow had their mouths hanging open as they watched the driver
regain control, as her chariot—rolling along instead of flying—cut a swath of
destruction and death through Proffit's ranks. Alustriel banked to the south, a
wide sweep that both drow understood was intended to turn her around so

that she could find her magical attackers.
"She should be dead," Kaer'lic said, and she licked her suddenly dry lips.
"But she's not," said Tos'un.
The chariot went up in the air, then continued its turn, completing a circuit.
The dark elves heard the sound of a larger battle to the east, and the sound of
horns and drums.
"She brought friends," said Kaer'lic.
"Many friends," Tos'un presumed. "We should leave."
The dark elves looked at each other and nodded.
"Get the prisoner," Kaer'lic instructed, and she didn't even wait as Tos'un
moved off toward the small hole where they had concealed poor Fender.
The two dark elves and their captive started away quickly to the west,
wanting to put as much ground as possible between themselves and the
fierce woman in the flying chariot.
From the joyous cries among the line of dwarves and humans in the north,
to the gathering sounds of a great battle erupting in the east, to the sheer
power and control of the woman in the chariot up above, they knew that the
end had come for Proffit.
Lady Alustriel and Silverymoon had come.
*
*
*
* *
The Silver Guard of Silverymoon charged into the troll ranks in tight
formation, spears leveled, bows firing flaming arrows from behind their ranks.
Watching from the higher ground, Torgar could only think of the initial engage-
ment as a wave washing over a beach, so fully did the Silver Guard seem to
engulf the eastern end of the troll ranks.
But then that wave seemed to break apart on many large rocks. They were
trolls, after all, strong and powerful and more physically resilient than any
creature in all the world. The roar of the charge became the screams of the
dying. The tight formations became a dance of smaller groups, pockets of
warriors working hard to fend off the huge, ugly trolls.
Fireballs erupted beyond the leading edge of the Silver Guard, as Silvery-
moon's battle wizards joined in the fray.
But the trolls did not break and run. They met the attack with savagery,
plowing into the human ranks, crushing warriors to the ground and stomping
them flat.
"Now, boys!" Torgar yelled to his dwarves. "They came to help us, and it's
our turn to repay the favor!"
From on high came the dwarven charge, down the barren, rocky slope at
full run. To their right, the west, came Galen and the humans, sweeping in
behind the trolls as the monsters pressed eastward to do battle with the new
threat.
Blood ran—troll, dwarf, and human. Troll roars, human screams, and
dwarven grunts mingled in the air in a symphony of horror and pain. The
drama played out, minute by minute, a hundred personal struggles within the
greater overall conflict.
It was the end for so many that day, lives cut short on a bloody, rocky slope
under a pre-dawn sky.
As the lines tightened, the wizards became less effective and it became a
contest of steel against claw, of troll savagery against dwarf stubbornness.
In the end, it wasn't the weapons or the superior tactics that won the day for

the dwarves and humans. It was the care for each other and the sense that
those around each warrior would stand there in support, the confidence of
community and sacrifice. The willingness to stand and die before abandoning
a friend. The dwarves had it most of all, but so did the humans of Nesme and
Silverymoon, while the trolls fought singly, self-preservation or bloodlust alone
keeping them in battle.
Dawn broke an hour later to reveal a field of blood and body parts, of dead
men, dead dwarves, and burned trolls, of troll body pieces squirming and
writhing until the finishing crews could put them to the torch.
Battered and torn, half his face gouged by filthy troll claws, Torgar
Hammerstriker walked the lines of his wounded, patting each dwarf on the
shoulder as he passed. His companions had come out from Mirabar behind
him, and had known nothing but battle after vicious battle by the end of the
first tenday. Yet not a dwarf was complaining, and not one had muttered a
single thought about going back. They were Battlehammers now, one and all,
loyal to kin and king.
The fights, to a dwarf, were worth it.
As he moved past the line of his fighters, Torgar spotted Shingles talking
excitedly to several of the Silverymoon militia.
"What do ye know?" Torgar asked when he came up beside his old friend.
"I know that Alustriel's not thinking to move north against Obould," came
the surprising answer.
Torgar snapped his gaze over the two soldiers, who remained unshaken
and impassive, and seemed in no hurry to explain the surprising news.
"She here?" Torgar asked.
"Lady Alustriel is with Galen Firth of Nesme," one of the soldiers asked.
"Then ye best be taking us there."
The soldier nodded and led them on through the encampment, past the
piled bodies of Silverymoon dead, past the lines of horribly wounded men,
where priests were hard at work in tending the many garish wounds. In a tent
near the middle of the camp, they found Alustriel and Galen Firth, and the
man from Nesme seemed in as fine spirits as Torgar had known.
The two dwarves allowed the soldiers to announce them, then walked up to
the table where Lady Alustriel and Galen stood. The sight of Alustriel did give
stubborn Torgar pause, for all that he had heard of the impressive woman
surely paled in comparison to the reality of her presence. Tall and shapely,
she stood with an air of dignity and competence beyond anything Torgar had
ever seen. She wore a flowing gown of the finest materials, white and trimmed
in purple, and upon her head was a circlet of gold and diamonds that could
not shine with enough intensity to match her eyes. Torgar could hardly believe
the thought, but it seemed to him that next to Alustriel, even Shoudra
Stargleam would be diminished.
"L-lady," the dwarf stuttered, bowing so low his black beard brushed the
ground.
"Well met, Torgar Hammerstriker," Alustriel said in a voice that was like a
cool north wind. "I was hoping to speak with you, here or in the inevitable
meetings I will have with King Bruenor of Mithral Hall. Your actions in Mirabar
have sent quite an unsettling ripple throughout the region, you must know."
"If that ripple slaps Marchion Elastul upside his thick skull, then it's more
than worth it," the dwarf answered, regaining his composure and taciturn

facade.
"Fair enough," Alustriel conceded.
"What am I hearing now, Lady?" Torgar asked. "Some nonsense that ye're
thinking the battle done?"
"The land is full of orcs and giants, good dwarf," said Alustriel. "The battle is
far from finished, I am certain."
"I was just told ye weren't marching north to Mithral Hall."
"That is true."
"But ye just said—"
"This is not the time to take the fight to King Obould," Alustriel explained.
"Winter will fast come on. There is little we can do."
"Bah, ye can have yer army—armies, for where's Everlund and
Sundabar?—to Keeper's Dale in a tenday's time!"
"The other cities are watching, from afar," said Alustriel. "You do not
understand the scope of what has befallen the region, I fear."
"Don't understand it?" Torgar said, eyes wide. "I been fighting in the middle
of it for tendays now! I was on the ridge with Banak Brawnanvil, holding back
the hordes. Was me and me boys that stole back the tunnels so that damned
fool gnome could blow the top off the mountain spur!"
"Yes, I wish to hear all of that tale, in full, but another time," Alustriel said.
"So how can ye be saying I'm not knowing? I'm knowing better than
anyone!"
"You saw the front waves of an ocean of enemies," Alustriel said. "Tens of
thousands of orcs have crawled out of their holes to Obould's call. I have seen
this. I have flown the length and breadth of the battlefield. There is nothing the
combined armies can do at this time to be rid of the vermin. We cannot send
thousands to die in such an effort, when it is better to secure a defensive line
that will hold back the orc ocean."
"Ye came out to help Galen here!"
"Yes, against a manageable enemy—and one that still tore deeply into my
ranks. The trolls have been pushed back, and we will drive them into the
moors where they belong. Nesme,"—she indicated the map on the table—"will
be raised and fortified, because that alone is our best defense against the
creatures of the Trollmoors."
"So ye come to the aid of Nesme, but not of Mithral Hall?" said Torgar,
never one to hold his thoughts private.
"We aid where we can," Alustriel answered, remaining calm and relaxed. "If
the orcs begin to loosen their grip, if an opportunity presents itself, then
Silverymoon will march to Mithral Hall and beyond, gladly beside King
Bruenor Battlehammer and his fine clan. I suspect that Everlund will march
with us, and surely Citadels Felbarr and Adbar will not forsake their Delzoun
kin."
"But not now?"
Alustriel held her hands out wide.
"Nothing ye can do?"
"Emissaries will connect with King Battlehammer," the woman replied. "We
will do what we can."
Torgar felt himself trembling, felt his fists clenching at his sides, and it was
all he could do to not launch himself at Alustriel, or at Galen, standing smugly
beside her, the man seeming as if all the world had been set aright, since

Nesme would soon be reclaimed.
"There is nothing more, good dwarf," Alustriel added. "I can not march my
armies into the coming snow against so formidable an enemy as has brought
war against Mithral Hall."
"It's just orcs," said Torgar.
No answer came back at him, and he knew he would get none.
"Will you march with us to Nesme?" Galen Firth asked, and Torgar felt
himself trembling anew. "Will you celebrate in the glory of our victory as
Nesme is freed?"
The dwarf stared hard at the man.
Then Torgar turned and walked out of the tent. He soon made it back to his
kinfolk, Shingles at his side. Within an hour, they were gone, into the tunnels
and marching at double-pace back to King Bruenor.

SHIFTING SANDS AND SOLID STONE
"The boys from Felbarr're in sight across the river," Jackonray Broadbelt
excitedly reported to King Bruenor.
For several days, the dwarf representative from Citadel Felbarr had been
watching intently for the reports filtering down the chimneys for just such
word. He knew that his kin were on the march, that Emerus Warcrown had
agreed upon a Surbrin crossing to crash a hole in the defensive ring the orcs
were preparing and link up aboveground with Mithral Hall.
"Three thousand warriors," Jackonray went on. "And with boats to get
across."
"We're ready to knock out the hole in the east," Bruenor replied. "We got all
me boys bunched at Garumn's Gorge, ready to charge out and chase the
stinkin' orcs from the riverbank."
The two dwarves clapped each other on the shoulder, and throughout the
audience hall other dwarves cheered. Sitting near to Bruenor's dais, two
others seemed less than enthusiastic, however.
"You'll get them out fast?" Regis asked Nanfoodle.
The gnome nodded. "Mithral Hall will come out in a rush," he assured the
halfling. "But fast enough to destroy the river defenses?"
The same question echoed in Regis's thoughts. They had won over and
over again, and even when they'd lost ground, the cost had been heavier for
their enemies. But all that had been achieved through defensive actions.
What they planned was something quite different.
"What do ye know, Rumblebelly?" Bruenor asked a moment later, and
Regis realized that he wasn't doing a very good job of keeping his fears off of
his face.
"There are a lot of orcs," he said.
"Lot o' dead orcs soon enough!" declared Jackonray, and the cheering
grew even louder.
"We have the hall back, and they're not coming in," Regis said quietly. The
words sounded incredibly inane to him as he heard them come from his
mouth, and he had no idea what positive effect stating the obvious might
bring. It was simply a subconscious delaying tactic, he understood, a way to
move the conversation in another, less excitable direction.
"And they're soon to be running away!" Bruenor shot back at him, and the
cheering grew even louder.
There was no way to go against it, Regis recognized. The emotions were
too high, the anger bubbling over into the ecstasy of revenge.
"We should take no chances," Regis said, but no one was listening. "We
should move with care," he said, but no one was listening. "We have them
held now," he tried to explain. "How long will their forces hold together out
there in the cold and snow when they know that there is nowhere left for them
to march? Without the hunger of conquest, the orc momentum will stall, and
so will their hearts for battle."
Nanfoodle's hand on his arm broke the halfling's gaining momentum, for it
made Regis understand that Nanfoodle was the only one who even realized
he was talking, that the dwarves, cheering wildly and leaping about, couldn't
even hear his whispered words.

"We'll get out fast," the gnome assured him. "These engineers are mag-
nificent. They will make wide tunnels, do not fear. The Battlehammer dwarves
will come against the orcs before the orcs know they are being attacked."
Regis nodded, not doubting any of those specifics, but still very uneasy
about the whole plan.
A clap on his other shoulder turned him around, to see Wulfgar crouching
beside him.
"It is time to turn the orcs back to the north," the big man said. "It is time to
put the vermin back in their mountain holes, or in the cold ground."
"I just.. ." Regis started.
"It is the loss of Dagna," said Wulfgar.
Regis glanced up at him.
"You struck out forcefully and the cost was heavy," the barbarian explained.
"Is it so surprising that you would be less eager to strike out again?"
"You think it was my fault?"
"I think you did the right thing, and everyone here agreed and agrees still,"
Wulfgar answered with a reassuring smile. "If Dagna could reach out from the
Halls of Moradin, he would pick you up by the collar and send you running to
lead the charge out the eastern doors." Wulfgar put his hand on the halfling's
shoulder—and from shoulder to neck, Regis disappeared under that gigantic
paw.
The halfling tuned back in to the wider conversation then, in time to hear
Bruenor shouting orders to send signalers up the chimneys to the mountain-
top, to tell the Felbarr boys across the river that it was time to send Obould
running.
The cheering drowned out everything, and even Regis and Nanfoodle were
swept up in it.
It was time to send Obould running!
*

"Before winter!" came the shout, and the roar that was heard in the
common room of the human refugees was as loud as that of the dwarves
above vowing vengeance on King Obould. Word had filtered down the
corridors of Mithral Hall that Citadel Felbarr had come, and that King Bruenor
and his dwarves were preparing to burst out of their imprisonment.
The River Surbrin would be secured—that much seemed certain—and the
dwarves had promised to set up passage over the river to the lands still
tamed. They would cross the Surbrin before winter.
"Never again will I be crawling into any tunnels!" one man shouted.
"But huzzah to King Bruenor and his clan for their hospitality!" shouted
another and a great cheer went up.
"Silverymoon before the snow!" one shouted.
"Everlund!" argued another.
"There's word that Nesme's looking for hearty souls," added another, "to
rebuild what the trolls tore down."
Each city mentioned drew a louder cheer.
Each one stung Delly as acutely as the bite of a wasp. She moved through
the crowd nodding, smiling, and trying to be happy for them. They had been
through so much turmoil, had seen loved ones die and houses burned to the
ground. They had trekked across miles of rocky ground, had suffered the ele-
ments and the fear of orcs nipping at their heels all the way to Mithral Hall.

Delly wanted to be happy for them, for they deserved a good turn of for-
tune. But when the news had come down that the dwarves were preparing the
breakout in earnest, and that they expected to open the way for the refugees
to leave, all Delly could think about was that soon she would again be alone.
She had Colson of course, and Wulfgar when he was not up fighting—
which was rarely of late. She had the dwarves, and she cared for them
greatly.
But how she wanted to see the stars again. And bask in the sun. And feel
the wind upon her face. A wistful smile crossed her face as she thought of
Arumn and Josi at the Cutlass.
Delly shook the nostalgia and the self-pity away quickly as she approached
a solitary figure in the corner of the large room. Cottie Cooperson didn't join in
the cheers that night, and seemed hardly aware of them at all. She sat upon a
chair, rocking slowly back and forth, staring down at the small child in her
arms.
Delly knelt beside her and gently put her hand on Cottie's shoulder.
"Ye put her to sleep again, did ye, Cottie?" Delly quietly asked.
"She likes me."
"Who would not?" Delly asked, and she just knelt there for a long time,
rubbing Cottie's shoulder, looking down at the peaceful Colson.
The sounds of eager anticipation continued to echo around her, the shouts
and the cheers, the grand plans unveiled by man after man declaring that he
would begin a new and better life. Their resilience touched Delly, to be sure,
as did the sense of community that she felt there. All those refugees from
various small towns, thrown together in the tunnels of dwarves, had bonded in
common cause and in simple human friendship.
Delly held her smile throughout, but when she considered the source of the
cheering, she felt more like crying.
She left the room a short while later, Colson in her arms. To her surprise,
she found Wulfgar waiting for her in their room.
"I hear ye're readying to break free of the hall and march to the Surbrin,"
she greeted.
The bluntness and tone set Wulfgar back in his chair, and Delly felt him
watching her closely, every step, as she carried Colson to her small crib. She
set the baby down and let her finger trace gently across her face, then stood
straight and took a deep breath before turning to Wulfgar and adding, "I hear
ye're meaning to go soon."
"The army is already gathering at Garumn's Gorge," the big man confirmed.
"The army of Citadel Felbarr is in sight above, approaching the Surbrin from
the east."
"And Wulfgar will be there with the dwarves when they charge forth from
their halls, will he?"
"It is my place."
"Yer own and Catti-brie's," Delly remarked.
Wulfgar shook his head, apparently missing the dryness of her tone. "She
cannot go, and it is difficult for her. Cordio will hear nothing of it, for her
wounds have not yet mended."
"Ye seem to know much about it."
"I just came from her bedside," said Wulfgar as he moved toward Colson's
crib—and as Delly moved aside, so that he did not see her wince at that

admission.
Bedside, or bed? the woman thought, but she quickly shook the preposter-
ous notion from her mind.
"How badly she wishes that she could join in the battle," Wulfgar went on.
So engaged was he with Colson then, leaning over the side of the crib and
waggling his finger before the child's face so that she had a challenge in
grabbing at it, that he did not notice Delly's profound frown. "She's all fight,
that one. I think her hatred of the orcs rivals that of a Gutbuster."
He finally looked up at Delly and his smile disappeared the moment he
regarded the stone-faced woman, her arms crossed over her chest.
"They're all leaving," she answered his confused expression. "For
Silverymoon and Everlund, or wherever their road might take them."
"Bruenor has promised that the way will be clear," Wulfgar answered.
"Clear for all of us," Delly heard herself saying, and she could hardly
believe the words. "I'd dearly love to see Silverymoon. Can ye take me
there?"
"We have already discussed this."
"I'm needing to go," Delly said. "It's been too long in the tunnels. Just a
foray, a visit, a chance to hear the tavern talk of people like meself."
"We will break through and scatter the orcs," Wulfgar promised. He came
up beside her and hugged her close in his muscular arms. "We will have them
on the run before winter and put them in their holes before midsummer. Their
day is past and Bruenor will reclaim the land for the goodly folk. Then we will
go to Silverymoon, and on to Sundabar if you wish!"
He couldn't see Delly's face as he held her so closely.
He wouldn't have understood anything he saw there, anyway, for the
woman was just numb. She had no answers for him, had not even any ques-
tions to ask.
Resignation smacked hard against impatience, and the woman couldn't find
the heart to start counting the many, many days.

Feeling refreshed and confident that he would rouse Citadel Felbarr to
Mithral Hall's aid, Nikwillig walked out of the Moonwood to the south, escorted
by Hralien. They would strike southwest, toward the Surbrin, to gather needed
information, and Hralien planned to return to the Moonwood after seeing
Nikwillig safely on his way back to his dwarven home.
When the pair reached the Surbrin, they saw their enemies across the way,
still building on the already formidable defenses. Picket walls of huge
sharpened logs lined the western bank and piles of stones could be seen,
ready to be thrown by the few giants they saw milling about, or by the many
catapults that had been constructed and set in place.
"They're thinking to hold it all," Nikwillig remarked.
Hralien had no response.
The two moved back to the east soon after, marching long into the night
and far from the riverbank. The next morning, they set off early, and at a swift
pace. At noon, they came to the crossroads.
"Farewell, good dwarf," Hralien offered. "Your enemy is our enemy, of
course, and so I expect that we might well meet again."
"Well met the first time," Nikwillig replied. "And well met the second, by
Moradin's blessing."

"Yes, there is that," Hralien said with a grin. He clapped the dwarf on the
shoulder and turned back to the north and home.
Nikwillig moved with a spring in his step. He had never expected to survive
the battle north of Keeper's Dale, had thought his signaling mission to be
suicidal. But, at long last, he was going home.
Or so he thought.
He came upon a high bluff as twilight settled on the hilly landscape, and
from that vantage point, Nikwillig saw the vast encampment of an army far to
the south.
An army he knew.
Citadel Felbarr was already on the march!
Nikwillig punched his fist in the air and let out a growl of support for his
warrior kinfolk. He considered the ground between him and the encampment.
He wanted to run right out and join them, but he knew that his weary legs
wouldn't carry him any farther that night. So he settled down, thinking to get a
short rest.
He closed his eyes.
And awoke late the next morning, with the sun nearing its apex. The dwarf
leaped up and rushed to the southern end of the bluff. The army was gone—
marching east, he knew. East to the river and the mighty defenses that had
been set in place there.
The dwarf glanced all around, studying the ground, looking for some sign of
his kin. Could he catch them?
He didn't know, but did he dare try it?
Nikwillig hopped in circles for many minutes, his mind spinning faster than
his body ever could. One name kept coming back to him: Hralien.
He ran off the bluff soon after, heading north and not south.

OVEREAGER
Bruenor Battlehammer stood on the eastern gatehouse of the bridge at
Garumn's Gorge, overseeing the preparations for the coming assault. The
couriers scrambled, relaying messages and information from the engineers
and the many scouts working the eastern slopes of the mountain, who
shouted the information down the cooled chimneys to the great Undercity.
The dwarf king was arrayed in full battle regalia, his shield emblazoned with
the foaming mug standard of his clan and his well-worn, often chipped battle-
axe slung casually over one shoulder—but without his signature helmet, with
its one horn remaining.
Regis and Wulfgar were there by his side, as was Banak Brawnanvil,
seated and strapped into a carriage set upon two sturdy poles. Four strong
dwarves attended Banak, ready to carry him out onto the battlefield and into
position where he could help direct the movements of the various dwarven
regiments.
"Girl's gonna miss the fun this day," Bruenor remarked, referring to the
notably absent Catti-brie. She had argued and argued to be a part of the
battle, but Cordio and the other priests would hear none of it, and in the end,
Wulfgar and Bruenor had quietly pointed out that her presence would more
likely jeopardize those attending her than anything else.
"Fun?" Regis echoed.
He continued to stare to the east, where three high platforms had been
built, each holding a train of ore carts, cranked up and locked in place at the
top of a high rail ramp. The rails swept down across the remaining distance of
the gorge ledge, then into the exit tunnels. The doors to those tunnels had
been reopened, but the orcs, trolls, and giants had done a fair job of bringing
down that side of the mountain, leaving the dwarves trapped in their hole. And
so while the engineers had constructed the rails, miners had dug extensions
on the escape tunnels, scraping right to the very outer edge of the landslide,
so close to the open air that they often had to pause in their work and let noisy
orc guards wander by.
"Fun in a Pwent kind o' way," Bruenor remarked with a snicker. "Durned
crazy dwarf's arguing to sit atop the middle train instead of inside!" Bruenor
offered a wink at Banak.
"He'd lead with his helmet spike, and probably take half the mountain with
him," Banak added. "And he'd love every tumble and every rock that fell upon
his too-hard head."
"Not to doubt," said Bruenor.
"The middle tunnel will prove the widest," Wulfgar said more seriously.
"Me and yerself'll lead the charge right behind the carts out that one, then,"
said Bruenor.
"I was thinking to go on the left," said Wulfgar. "The scouts report that the
watchtower is well defended by our enemies. Taking that, and quickly, will be
crucial."
"To the left, then. The both of us."
"You'll be needed in the center, directing," Regis said.
"Bah!" Bruenor snorted. "Pwent's starting the fight there, and Pwent don't
take no directions. These boys'll get Banak out fast enough, and he'll call the

orders to the river."
All three, dwarf, human, and halfling, looked to the injured Banak as
Bruenor spoke, and none of them missed the expression of sincere gratitude
the old warrior wore. He wanted to see the fight through, wanted to complete
what he had started on the high ridge north of Keeper's Dale. As they all had
learned with Pikel Bouldershoulder after the green-bearded dwarf had lost an
arm, the physical infirmity would be minimized if the wounded could still
contribute to the cause.
The conversation rambled along for some time, the four really talking about
nothing important, but merely trying to pass away the tense minutes until the
final words came up from the Undercity. Everyone at Garumn's Gorge wanted
to just go, to burst out and be on with the battle. Seasoned veterans all, the
Battlehammer dwarves knew well that those moments before a battle were
usually the most trying.
And so it was with hopeful eyes that the four turned to see the courier
running to them from the depths of Mithral Hall.
"King Bruenor," the dwarf gasped, "the scouts're saying that Felbarr's ready
to cross and that most o' the damned orcs've gone down to the river."
"That's it, then," Bruenor told them all.
He gave a shrill whistle, commanding the attention of all nearby dwarves,
then lifted his battle-axe into the air and shook it about.
Cheering started near him and rolled out to the edges of the gorge like a
wave on a pond. Up above, warriors scrambled into the ore carts, packing in
tightly, and pulled the thick metal covers over them, and just below them,
engineers moved to the locking pins.
Wulfgar bounded off toward the left-hand tunnel, nearly running over
Nanfoodle as the gnome rushed to join Bruenor, who was offering last-minute
instructions to Banak.
"I wish we had some of that oil of impact remaining," the gnome moaned.
"Bah, the dwarves'll knock them walls out!" said Regis, using his best
Bruenor imitation, and when Bruenor turned to regard him curiously, the
halfling tossed him a reassuring wink.
It seemed that Regis had put his doubts aside, or at least had suppressed
them since they were moot in any case, but before Bruenor could begin to
discern which it might be, the pins were yanked free and the three large trains
began to rumble down the tracks.
They came down from a height of more than fifty feet, picking up speed and
momentum as they shot along the oiled rails into the low, narrow tunnels. So
perfectly timed was the release, and so minimal the tolerance of each set of
rails, that they rolled along side-by-side into their respective tunnels and all hit
the outer shell of the mountain blockade within a blink of each other.
The screech of metal grinding on metal and stone, and the thunder of
tumbling boulders, echoed back into the main chambers, eliciting a great war
whoop from the gathered forces, who took up the charge.
Wulfgar led the way on the left, though he had to stoop nearly double to
pass through the tight corridor. Before him lay bright daylight, for the train had
blasted right through and had gone skidding and tumbling down beyond the
exit. Already dwarves were scrambling out of that wreckage, weapons ready.
The barbarian came out into the open air and saw immediately that their
surprise was complete. Few orcs were in the area, and those that were

seemed more frightened than ready to do battle. Wulfgar ignored his instincts
to go to the seemingly vulnerable train-riders, and instead cut a fast left and
sprinted up a rocky slope toward the watchtower. The door was partially ajar,
an orc moving behind it just as Wulfgar lowered his shoulder and barreled into
it.
The orc grunted and flew across the room, arms and legs flailing. Its three
companions in the room watched its flight, their expressions confused. They
seemed hardly aware that an enemy had burst in, even when Aegis-fang
swept down from on high, smashing the skull of the closest.
Wulfgar pivoted around that dead orc as it fell, and in his turn, sent his
warhammer sweeping out wide. The targeted orc leaped and turned, trying to
twist out of the way, but the warhammer clipped it hard enough to launch it
into a spin, around and around, into the air, its flight ending abruptly at the
tower's stone wall. Wulfgar strode forward, chopping at the third orc, who
rushed away and out of reach. But the barbarian just turned the momentum of
the hammer, launching it out left to right so that it cracked into the back of the
orc who was pressed face-up against the wall, crushing its ribs and splitting its
sides. The creature gasped and blood fountained from its mouth.
Wulfgar wasn't watching, though, certain that his hit had been fatal. He let
go of Aegis-fang, confident it would return to his call, and charged ahead,
swatting aside the spear of the remaining orc as it clumsily tried to bring the
weapon to bear.
The huge barbarian stepped close and got his hand around the orc's neck,
then pressed ahead and down, bending the creature over backward and
choking the life out of it.
"Above ye!" a dwarf called in a raspy voice from the doorway.
Wulfgar glanced back to see Bill HuskenNugget, the lookout who had been
in there when the tower had been taken. Bill had been downed with a
poisoned dart, and simultaneously, his throat had been expertly cut, taking his
voice, which was only beginning to heal. The retreating dwarves had thought
Bill dead, but they'd dragged him along anyway, as was their custom—and a
good thing they had, for he had awakened cursing in a whisper soon after.
Wulfgar's gaze went up fast, in time to see an orc in the loft above him
launching a spear his way. The orc jerked as it threw, Bill's crossbow bolt
buried in its side.
Wulfgar couldn't dive out of the way, so he reacted with a twist and a jerk,
throwing his arm, still holding the dying orc by the throat, coming up to block.
The dying orc took the spear in the back, and Wulfgar tossed the creature
aside. He glanced back to Bill, who offered a wink, then he ran to the ladder
and leaped, reaching up high enough to catch the lip of the loft. With his
tremendous strength, the barbarian easily pulled himself up.
"Aegis-fang!" he cried, summoning the magical hammer into his hands.
Roaring and swinging, he had orcs flying from the loft in short order. Down
below, the dwarves, including Bill and Bruenor, finished them up even as they
hit the ground.
Wulfgar ran for the ladder to the roof, and nearly tripped as a small form
came rushing past him. He wasn't even surprised to see Regis go out the
loft's small window, nor was he surprised when he charged up the ladder and
shouldered through the trapdoor—a trapdoor that had been weighted down
with several bags of supplies—to see Regis peeking at him over the lip of the

tower.
As soon as Wulfgar got the attention of all three orcs on the tower top, the
halfling came over and sat on the crenellation. Regis picked out a target and
let fly his little mace, the weapon spinning end-over-end to smack the orc in
the face. The creature staggered backward, nearly tumbling over the parapet,
and as it finally straightened, the halfling hit it with a flying body block. The orc
went over the edge, to be followed by a second, thrown out by Wulfgar, and a
third, leaping of its own volition in the face of the raging barbarian.
"Good place to direct!" Bruenor yelled, coming through the trapdoor. He ran
to the southern edge of the tower top, overlooking the battlefield.
The wide smile on the fierce dwarf's face lasted until he looked to the east,
to the river.

The jolt when they hit the stone wall rattled their teeth and compressed all
eight of the dwarves in the ore cart into an area that two had fully occupied
just a moment before. They weathered it, though, to a dwarf. And not just in
that cart and in the other nine in the same train, but in the twenty carts of the
other two trains as well.
Ivan and Pikel Bouldershoulder stretched and shoved with all their might,
trying to keep the dwarves in their cart from crushing each other. The jolts
continued, though, the iron carts twisting and straining. Rocks bounced down
as the train rumbled about.
When it finally settled, Ivan was first to put his feet under him and strain his
back against the dented cover of the cart. He pushed it open a bit, enough so
that he could poke his head out.
"By Moradin!" he cried to his companions. "All of ye boys, push now and
push hard!"
For Ivan saw that the plan had not worked quite so well, at least with their
particular train. They had hardly cracked through the mountain wall, instead
beginning an avalanche over them that had left the train half buried, twisted,
and still blocking the tunnel exit so that the soldiers running behind could not
easily get out.
Ivan grabbed at the twisted metal cart cover and shoved with all his
strength. When that did nothing, he reached out over it and tried to pry away
some of the heavy stones holding it down.
"Come on, lads!" he shouted. "Afore the damned orcs catch us in a box!"
They all began shoving and shouldering the metal cover, and it creaked
open a bit more. Ivan wasted no time in squeezing out.
The view from that vantage point proved no more encouraging. Only two of
the other nine carts were open, and the dwarves coming out were bleeding
and dazed. Half the mountainside had come down upon them, it seemed, and
they were stuck.
And to the east, Ivan saw and heard the charge of the orcs.
The yellow-bearded dwarf scrambled atop his damaged cart and pushed
aside several stones, then reached back and tugged the cover with all his
strength.
Out popped Pikel, then another and another, with Ivan shouting encour-
agement all the while.
The orcs closed.
But then a second roar came down from just north of their position, and

Ivan managed to get a peek over a pile of rubble to see the countering charge
of the Battlehammer dwarves. The center train and the northern one had
pounded right through, exactly as planned, and the army was pouring out of
Mithral Hall in full force, sweeping east and fanning south to form a perimeter
around the catastrophe of the southernmost train. The fierce dwarves met the
orc charge head on, axe against spear, sword against sword, in such a violent
and headlong explosion that half the orcs and dwarves leading their
respective charges were down in the first seconds of engagement.
Ivan leaped from the rubble and led the charge of those few among the
dwarves of the southern train who could follow. Of the eighty in the carts of
that southern train, less than a score came forth, the others out of the fight
either because of serious injury or because they simply could not force open
their twisted and buried carts.
By the time Ivan, Pikel, and the others joined in the fray, that particular orc
charge had been stopped in its tracks. More and more dwarves poured forth;
formations gathered and marched with precision to support the flanks and to
disrupt the in-flow of orc warriors.
"To the river, boys!" came a shout from the front of the dwarven line, and
Ivan recognized the voice of Tred. "The boys of Felbarr have come and
they're needing us now!"
That, of course, was all the ferocious Battlehammers needed to hear, and
they pressed all the harder, driving back the orcs and raising their cheers in
the common refrain of, "To the river!"

The progress in the center and south proved remarkable, the dwarves
crushing the resistance and making good speed, but from the tower top in the
north, Bruenor, Wulfgar, and Regis were granted a different perspective on it
all.
Regis winced and looked away as a giant boulder crashed into a raft laden
with Felbarr dwarves, sending several sprawling into the icy waters and
driving the side of the craft right under, swamping it.
The boats were putting in upstream, obviously, the Felbarr dwarves trying
to ride the current with their own rowing to get them to the bank at the point of
conflict. But the orcs and giants had some tricks to play. Sharpened logs met
the dwarven rafts in the swift river current, catching against the sides of the
craft and disrupting the rowing. And the barrage of boulders, giant thrown and
catapult launched, increased with every passing second. Rocks hit the water
with tremendous whumps! and sent up fountains of spray, or crashed into and
through the dwarven boats.
Dozens of boats were in the water, each carrying scores of dwarves, and
the three observers on the tower had to wonder if any of them would even get
across.
Bruenor shouted down to his commanders on the ground, "Get to the
durned river and turn to the north! We got to clear the bank along the north.
Take 'em over the ridge," the dwarf king instructed Wulfgar. "We got to stop
those giants!"
Wulfgar nodded and started down the ladder, but Regis just shook his head
and said, "Too many," echoing all their fears.
Within minutes, the main thrust of the dwarven army had split the orc forces
in half, spearheading right to the bank of the Surbrin. But as more and more

dwarves rushed out to support the lines, so too were the orcs reinforced from
the north. A great swarming mass rushed down over the mountain spur to join
in the fight.
Bruenor and Regis could only look on helplessly. They would take the
riverbank and hold it south of that spur, Bruenor could see, but they'd never
get up north enough to slow the giant barrage and help the poor dwarves of
Citadel Felbarr and their ill-advised crossing.
Another boulder smashed a raft, and half the dwarves atop it tumbled into
the water, their heavy armor tugging them down to the icy depths.
Regis rubbed his plump hands over his face.
"By the gods," he muttered.
Bruenor punched his fist against the stone, then turned to the ladder and
leaped down to the loft. In moments, he was outside with Wulfgar, calling
every dwarf around him to his side, and he and the barbarian led the charge
straight north, up the side of the mountain spur and beyond.
Regis screamed down to him, but futilely. The halfling could see the force
over that ridge, and he knew that Bruenor and Wulfgar were surely doomed.
Out in the water, another boat capsized.

18
THE SKIN OF A DWARF'S TOOTH
Nikwillig groaned and shouted as another of the rafts overturned, dumping
brave dwarves to a watery death. He looked to his companion for some sign
of hope.
Hralien, as frustrated as the dwarf, looked away, back to his warriors as
they sprinted along the stones. They had located the sight of the most devas-
tating volleys, where a trio of giants were having a grand time of it, throwing
boulder after boulder as the defenseless dwarven crafts floated past.
Many times did the elf leader wave at his warriors for patience, but all of
them, even Hralien, were anxious and angry, watching good dwarves so
easily slaughtered. Hralien held them together in tight formation, though, and
had them holding their shots until the giant trio was right below them.
The elf nodded and all his charges, three-score of the Moonwood's finest
warriors, bent back their bows. Silent nods and hand signals had the groups
split evenly among the respective targets, and a shout from Hralien set them
in motion.
A score of arrows reached out for each of the unsuspecting giants, and
before that devastating volley struck home, the skilled elves had put the next
arrows to their bowstrings.
Sixty more streaked out, the hum of elven bows drowned out by the howls
of screaming giants.
One of the three went down hard under that second volley, grasping at the
shafts sticking from its thick neck. The other two staggered, but not toward
their attackers. The behemoths had seen enough of the elven war party
already. One ran flat out, back to the west, while the other, hit many times in
the legs, struggled to keep up. The straggler caught the full force of the next
volley, three-score arrows reaching out to sting it hard and send it tumbling to
the stones.
All around the western riverbank, where there had been only glee at the
easy slaughter of dwarves, came tumult and confusion. Giants howled and
orcs, dozens and dozens of the creatures, scrambled to and fro, caught
completely unawares.
"Press forward!" Hralien called down his line. "None get close enough that
we must draw swords!"
Grim-faced to an elf, each adorned with identical silver helmets that had
flared sides resembling the wings of a bird, and silver-trimmed forest green
capes flapping in the breeze behind them, the moon elf brigade marched in a
perfect line. As one they set arrows to bowstrings, as one they lifted and
leveled the bows, with permission to seek out the best targets of opportunity.
Few orcs seemed interested in coming their way, however, and so those
targets grew fewer and fewer.
The elves marched south, clouds of arrows leading their way.
*

Wulfgar led the charge over the mountain spur, where he and the dwarves
were met immediately by a host of orcs rushing south to reinforce their line.
With Aegis-fang in hand the mighty barbarian scattered the closest mon-
sters. A great one-armed swing of the warhammer, and he clipped a pair of
orcs and sent them flying, then stepped ahead and punched out, launching a

third into the air. Beside him, the dwarves came on in a wild rush, weapons
thrusting and slashing, shouldering orcs aside when their weapons didn't
score a hit.
"The high ground!" Wulfgar kept shouting, demanding of his forces that
they secure the ridgeline in short order.
Up went Wulfgar, stone by stone. Down went the orcs who tried to stand
before him, crushed to the ground or tossed aside. The barbarian was the first
to the ridge top, and there he stood unmovable, a giant among the dwarves
and orcs.
He called for the dwarves to rally around him, and so they did, coming up in
scattered pockets, but falling into perfect position around him, the first arrivals
supporting the barbarian's flanks, and those dwarves following supporting the
flanks of their kin. Lines of dwarves came on to join, but the orcs were not
similarly bolstered, for those monsters farther down the northern face of the
mountain spur veered east or west in an effort to avoid this point of conflict, to
avoid the towering and imposing barbarian and his mighty warhammer.
From that high vantage point, Wulfgar saw almost certain disaster brewing,
for farther to the east, down at the riverbank, such a throng of orcs had
gathered and were streaming south that it seemed impossible for the dwarves
to hold their hard-fought gains. The dwarves, too, were at the river then, south
of the spur, trying hard to fortify their tentative position.
If they lost at the riverbank, the brave Felbarrans in the river would have
nowhere to land their rafts.
Looking out at the river, at the splashes of giant boulders and the flailing
dwarves in the water, at the battered craft and the line of missiles reaching out
at them, Wulfgar honestly wondered if holding the riverbank would mean
anything at all. Would a single Felbarran dwarf get across?
Yet the Battlehammers had to try. For the sake of the Felbarrans, for the
sake of the whole dwarven community, they had to try.
Wulfgar glanced back behind him, and saw Bruenor leading another force
straight east along the base of the mountain spur, driving fast for the river.
"Turn east!" Wulfgar commanded his troops. "We'll make a stand on the
high ground and make the orcs pay for every inch of stone!"
The dwarves around him cheered and followed, rushing down the rocky
arm toward where it, too, spilled into the river. With only a hundred warriors
total in that group, there was no doubt that they would lose, that they would be
overwhelmed and slaughtered in short order. They all knew it. They all
charged on eagerly.
They made their stand on a narrow strip of high, rocky ground, between the
battleground south, where Bruenor had joined in the fighting and the dwarves
were gaining a strong upper hand and the approaching swarm from the north.
"Bruenor will protect our backs!" Wulfgar shouted. "Set a defense against
the north alone!"
The dwarves scrambled, finding all of the best positions which offered them
some cover to the north, and trusting in King Bruenor and their kin to protect
them from those orcs fighting in the south.
"Every moment of time we give those behind us is a moment more the
Felbarrans have to land on our shore!" Wulfgar shouted, and he had to yell
loudly to be heard, for the orc swarm was closing, screaming and hooting with
every running stride.

The orcs came to the base of that narrow ridge in full run and began
scrambling up, and Wulfgar and the dwarves rained rocks, crossbow bolts,
and Aegis-fang upon them, battering them back. Those who did reach the
fortified position met, most of all, Wulfgar the son of Beornegar. Like an
ancient oak, the tall and powerful barbarian did not bend.
Wulfgar, who had survived the harshness of Icewind Dale, refused to
move.
Wulfgar, who had suffered the torment of the demon Errtu, denied his
fears, and ignored the sting of orc spears.
The dwarves rallied around him, screaming with every swing of axe or
hammer, with every stab of finely-crafted sword. They yelled to deny the pain
of wounds, the broken knuckles, the gashes, and the stabs. They yelled to
deny the obvious truth that soon the orc sea would wash them from that place
and to the Halls of Moradin.
They screamed, and their calls became louder soon after, as more dwarves
came up to reinforce the line, dwarves who fought with King Bruenor—and
King Bruenor himself, determined to die beside his heroic human son.
Behind them, a Felbarran raft made the shore, the dwarves charging off
and swinging north immediately. Then a second slid in, and more
approached.
But it wouldn't be enough, Bruenor and Wulfgar knew, glancing back and
ahead. There were simply too many enemies.
"Back to the hall?" Wulfgar asked in the face of that reality.
"We got nowhere to run, boy," Bruenor replied.
Wulfgar grimaced at the hopelessness in the dwarf's voice. Their daring
breakout was doomed, it seemed, to complete ruin.
"Then fight on!" Wulfgar said to Bruenor, and he yelled it out again so that
all could hear. "Fight on! For Mithral Hall and Citadel Felbarr! Fight on for your
very lives!"
Orcs died by the score on the northern face of that ridge, but still they came
on, two replacing every one who had fallen.
Wulfgar continued to center the line, though his arms grew weary and his
hammer swings slowed. He bled from a dozen wounds, one hand swelled to
twice its normal size when Aegis-fang connected against an orc club too far
down the handle. But he willed that hand closed on the hammer shaft.
He willed his shaky legs to hold steady.
He growled and he shouted and he chopped down another orc.
He ignored the thousands still moving down from the north, focusing
instead on the ones within his deadly range.
So focused was he and the dwarves that none of them saw the sudden
thinning of the orc line up in the north. None noted orcs sprinting away sud-
denly to the west, or groups of others simply and suddenly falling to the stone,
many writhing, some already dead as they hit the ground.
None of the defenders heard the hum of elven bowstrings.
They just fought and fought, and grew confused as much as relieved when
fewer and fewer orcs streamed their way.
The swarm, faced with a stubborn foe in the south and a new and devas-
tating enemy in the north, scattered.
*
*
*
*
*
The battle south of the mountain spur continued for a long while, but when

Wulfgar's group managed to turn their attention in that direction and support
the main force of Battlehammers, and when the elves of the Moon-wood,
Nikwillig among them, came over the ridge and began offering their deadly
accurate volleys at the most concentrated and stubborn orc defensive
formations, the outcome became apparent and the end came swiftly.
Bruenor Battlehammer stood on the riverbank just south of the mountain
spur, staring out at the rolling water, the grave for hundreds of Felbarran
dwarves that dark day. They had won their way from Mithral Hall to the river,
had re-opened the halls and established a beachhead from which they could
begin their push to the north.
But the cost....
The horrible cost.
"We'll send forces out to the south and find a better place for landing," Tred
said to the dwarf king, his voice muted by the sobering reality of the battle.
Bruenor regarded the tough dwarf and Jackonray beside him.
"If we can clear the bank to the south, our boats can come across far from
the giant-throwers," Jackonray explained.
Bruenor nodded grimly.
Tred reached up and dared pat the weary king on the shoulder. "Ye'd have
done the same for us, we're knowing. If Citadel Felbarr was set upon, King
Bruenor'd've thrown all his boys into fire to help us."
It was true enough, Bruenor knew, but then, why did the water look so
blood red to him?

PART THREE
A WINTER RESPITE
Do you know what it is to be an elf, Drizzt Do'Urden?"
I hear this question all the time from my companion, who seems
determined to help me begin to understand the implications of a life that could
span centuries-implications good and bad when one considers that so many
of those with whom I come into contact will not live half that time.
It has always seemed curious to me that, while elves may live near a
millennium and humans less than a century, human wizards often achieve
levels of understanding and power to rival those of the greatest elf mages.
This is not a matter of intelligence, but of focus, it seems clear. Always before,
I gave the credit for this to the humans, for their sense of urgency in knowing
that their lives will not roll on and on and on.
Now I have come to see that part of the credit for this balance is the elven
viewpoint of life, and that viewpoint is not one rooted in falsehood or
weakness. Rather, this quieter flow of life is the ingredient that brings sanity to
an existence that will see the birth and death of centuries. Or, if preferable, it
is a segmented flow of life, a series of bursts.
I see it now, to my surprise, and it was Innovindil's recounting of her most
personal relationships with partners both human and elf that presented the
notion clearly in my mind. When Innovindil asks me now, "Do you know what
it is to be an elf, Drizzt Do'Urden'" I can honestly and calmly smile with self-
assurance. For the first time in my life, yes, I think I do know.
To be an elf is to find your distances of time. To be an elf is to live several
shorter life spans. It is not to abandon forward-looking sensibility, but it is also
to find emotionally comfortable segments of time, smaller life spans in which
to exist. In light of that realization, for me the more pertinent question thus
becomes, "Where is the range of comfort for such existences?"
There are many realities that dictate such decisions—decisions that, in
truth, remain more subconscious than purposeful. To be an elf is to outlive
your companions if they are not elves; even if they are, rare is the relationship
that will survive centuries. To be an elf is to revel in the precious moments of
your children—should they be of only half-elf blood, and even if they are of full
blood—and to know that they may not outlive you. In that instance, there is
only comfort in the profound and ingrained belief that having these children
and these little pockets of joyful time was indeed a blessing, and that such a
blessing outweighs the profound loss that any compassionate being would
surely feel at the death of an offspring. If the very real possibility that one will
outlive a child, even if the child sees the end of its expected lifespan, will
prevent that person from having children, then the loss is doubly sad.
In that context, there is only one answer: to be an elf is to celebrate life.
To be an elf is to revel in the moments, in the sunrise and the sunset, in the
sudden and brief episodes of love and adventure, in the hours of
companionship. It is, most of all, to never be paralyzed by your fears of a
future that no one can foretell, even if predictions lead you to the seemingly
obvious, and often disparaging, conclusions.
That is what it is to be an elf.
The elves of the surface, contrary to the ways of the drow, often dance and
sing. With this, they force themselves into the present, into the moment, and

though they may be singing of heroes and deeds long past or of prophecies
yet to come, they are, in their song, in the moment, in the present, grasping
an instant of joy or reflection and holding it as tightly as any human might.
A human may set out to make a "great life," to become a mighty leader or
sage, but for elves, the passage of time is too slow for such pointed and
definitive ambitions. The memories of humans are short, so 'tis said, but that
holds true for elves as well. The long dead human heroes of song no doubt
bore little resemblance to the perceptions of the current bards and their
audience, but that is true of elves, too, even though those elf bards likely
knew the principals of their songs!
The centuries dull and shift the memories, and the lens of time alters
images.
A great life for an elf, then, results either of a historical moment seized
correctly or, more often, it is a series of connected smaller events that will
eventually add up to something beyond the parts. It is a continuing process of
growth, perhaps, but only because of piling experiential understanding.
Most of all, I know now, to be an elf is not to be paralyzed by a future one
cannot control. I know that I am going to die. I know that those I love will one
day die, and in many cases—I suspect, but do not know!—they will die long
before I. Certitude is strength and suspicion is worthless, and worry over
suspicion is something less than that.
I know, now, and so I am free of the bonds of the future.
I know that every moment is to be treasured, to be enjoyed, to be
heightened as much as possible in the best possible way.
I know, now, the failing of the bonds of worthless worry.
I am free.

QUIET TENDAYS
Winter had already settled in far to the north, on the higher foothills of the
Spine of the World. Cold winds brought stinging sheets of snow, often moving
horizontally more than vertically. Drizzt and Innovindil kept their cowls pulled
low and tight, but still the crisp snow stung their faces, and the brilliance of the
snowcap had Drizzt squinting his sensitive eyes even when the sun was not
brightly shining. The drow would have preferred to move after dark, but it was
simply too cold, and he, Innovindil, and Sunset had to spend the dark hours
huddled closely near a fire night after night. He couldn't believe how
dramatically the shift in the weather had come, considering that it was still
autumn back in the region of Mithral Hall.
The going was slow—no more than a few miles a day at most, and that
only if they were not trying to climb higher along the icy passes. On a few
occasions, they had dared to use Sunset to fly them up over a particularly
difficult ridge, but the wind was dangerously strong for even the pegasus's
powerful wings. Beyond that, the last thing the pair wanted was to be spotted
by Gerti and her army of behemoths!
"How many days have passed?" Drizzt asked Innovindil as they sat for a
break and a midday meal one gray afternoon.
"A tenday and six?" the elf answered, obviously as unsure of the actual
time they had spent chasing Gerti as was Drizzt.
"And it seems as if we have walked across the seasons," said the drow.
"Summer never comes to the mountains, and up here, autumn and spring
are what we in the lower lands would call winter, to be sure."
Drizzt looked back to the south as Innovindil responded, and that view
reminded him of just how high up they had come. The landscape opened wide
before him, sloping down and spreading so completely that it appeared to flat-
ten out below him. In viewing that, it occurred to Drizzt that if the ground was
bare and less broken, he could start a round stone rolling there and it would
bounce all the way to Mithral Hall.
"They're getting far ahead of us," Drizzt remarked. "Perhaps we should be
on our way."
"They're bound for Shining White, to be sure," Innovindil replied. "We will
find it, do not doubt. I have seen the giant lair many times from Sunset's
back." She motioned to the northwest, higher up in the mountains.
"Will we even be able to get through the passes?" Drizzt asked, looking
back up at the steel gray sky, clouds heavy with the promise of even more
snow.
"One way or another," she said. The drow took comfort in Innovindil's clear
determination, in her scowl that seemed every bit as forceful and stoic as his
own. "They treat Sunrise lovingly."
"Frost giants appreciate beauty."
As do I, Drizzt thought but did not say. Beauty, strength, and heart
combined.
He considered all of that as he looked at Innovindil, but the thought itself
sent his mind rushing back to an image of another female companion he had
once known. There were many similarities, Drizzt knew, but he needn't look
farther than Innovindil's pointy ears and sharply angled eyebrows to

remember that there were great differences, as well.
Innovindil pulled herself up from beside the low-burning fire and began
collecting her pack and supplies.
"Perhaps we can put some distance behind us before the snow begins,"
she said as she strapped on her sword and dagger. "With this wind, we'll not
move through the storm."
Drizzt didn't reply other than a slight nod, which Innovindil was too busy to
even notice. The drow just watched her going about her tasks, enjoying the
flow of her body and the sweep of her long golden hair as gusts of wind blew
through.
He thought of his days immediately following the fall of Shallows, when he
had hidden in a cave, rolling the one-horned helm of his dead friend in his
hands. The emptiness of that time assailed him again, reminding him of how
far he'd come. Drizzt had given in to the anger and the pain, had accepted a
sense of complete hopelessness for perhaps the first time in all his life.
Innovindil and Tarathiel had brought him from that dark place, with patience
and calm words and simple friendship. They had tolerated his instinctive
defenses, which he'd thrown up to rebuff their every advance. They had
accepted his explanation of Ellifain's death without suspicion.
Drizzt Do'Urden knew that he could never replace Bruenor, Catti-brie,
Regis, and Wulfgar; those four were as much a part of who he was as any
friend could ever hope. But maybe he didn't have to replace them. Maybe he
could satisfy his emotional needs around the holes, if not filling in the holes
themselves.
That was the promise of Innovindil, he knew.
And he was glad.

"Move swifter," Kaer'lic instructed in her broken command of the Dwarvish
tongue. She had gleaned a few words of the language in her years on the
surface, and with its many hard consonant sounds, the language bore some
similarities to the drow's own, and even more to the tongue of the svirfneblin,
which Kaer'lic spoke fluently. To get her point across, even if her words were
not correct, the drow priestess kicked poor Fender on the back, sending him
stumbling ahead.
He nearly fell, but battered though he was, he was too stubborn for that. He
straightened and looked back, narrowing his gray eyes under his bushy brows
in a threatening scowl.
Kaer'lic jammed the handle of her mace into his face.
Fender hit the ground hard, coughing blood, and he spat out a tooth. He
tried to scream at the priestess, but all that came through his expertly slashed
throat was a wheezing and fluttering sound like a burst of wind through a row
of hanging parchments.
"With all care," Tos'un said to his companion. "The more you injure him, the
longer it will take for us to be away." As he finished, the male drow glanced
back to the south, as if expecting a fiery chariot or a host of warriors to rush
over him. "We should have left the wretch with Proffit. The trolls would have
eaten him and that would have been the end of it."
"Or Lady Alustriel and her army would have rescued him as they overran
Proffit, and wouldn't he be quick in telling them all about a pair of dark elves
roaming the land?"

"Then we should have just killed him and been done with it."
Kaer'lic paused and spent a moment scrutinizing her companion. She
allowed her expression to show her disappointment in him, for truly, after all
those years, she expected more from the warrior of House Barrison
Del'Armgo.
"Obould will get nothing more from him than we have already gleaned,"
Tos'un said, his tone uncertain and revealing that he knew he was trying an
awkward dodge. "And we will need no barter with the orc king—he will be glad
that we have returned to him, even though the news we bear will hardly be to
his liking."
"The news of Proffit's downfall and the reclamation of Nesme will outrage
him."
"But he is smart enough to separate the message from the messenger."
"Agreed," said Kaer'lic. "But you presume that King Obould is still alive, and
that his forces have not been scattered and overrun. Has it occurred to you
that perhaps we are returning to a northland where Bruenor Battlehammer is
king once more?"
That unsettling thought had occurred to Tos'un, obviously, and he glanced
past Kaer'lic and kicked poor Fender as the dwarf tried to rise.
"When I see Donnia again, I will slap her for leading us down this horrid
road."
"If we see Donnia and Ad'non again, we will all need to find a new road to
travel, I fear," Kaer'lic replied, emphasizing that important first word. "Or
perhaps Obould continues to press and to conquer. Perhaps this is all going
better than any of us ever dared hope, despite the setback along the northern
banks of the Trollmoors. If Obould has secured Mithral Hall, will even Lady
Alustriel find the forces to drive him out?"
"Is that event more desirable?"
The question seemed ridiculous on the surface, of course, but before
Kaer'lic snapped off a retort, she remembered her last encounter with the orc
king. Confident, dangerously so, and imperious, he hadn't asked her and
Tos'un to go south with Proffit. He had ordered them.
"We shall see what we shall see," was all the priestess replied.
She turned her attention back to Fender and jerked him upright from his
crouch, then sent him on his way with a rough shove.
To the northeast, they could see the shining top of Fourthpeak, seeming no
more than a day's march.
There lay their answers.

With pieces of orc still hanging from the ridges of his plate mail armor, it
seemed hard to take Thibbledorf Pwent very seriously. But in a confusing time
of regret and despair, Bruenor Battlehammer could have found no better
friend.
"If we hold the riverbank all the way down to the south, then them Felbar-
rans and other allies might be getting across out o' the durned giants' range,"
Pwent calmly explained to Bruenor.
The two stood on the riverbank watching the work across the way on the
eastern side, where the Felbarrans were already laying the foundation for a
bridge.
"But will we be able to stretch our line?" Bruenor asked.

"Bah! Won't take much," came the enthusiastic reply. "Ain't seen no stupid
orcs south o' here at all, and they can't be coming in from the west cause o'
the mountain. Only way for them dogs to get down here is the north."
The words prompted both dwarves to turn and look up that way, to the
mountain spur, the line of rocks sloping down to the river's edge. Many
dwarves were up there, constructing a wall from the steep mountainside to the
tower Wulfgar and Bruenor had taken. Their goal was to tighten the potential
area of approach as much as possible so that the orc force couldn't simply
swarm over them. Once that wall was set and fortified, the tower would serve
as an anchor and the wall would be extended all the way to the river.
For the time being, the ridgeline east of the tower was dotted by lookouts,
and held by the Moonwood elves, their deadly bows ready.
"Never thinked I'd be happy to see a bunch o' durned fairies," Pwent
grumbled, and a much-needed grin creased Bruenor's face, a grin all the
wider because of the truth of those words. Had not Nikwillig led the
Moonwood elves south in force, Bruenor doubted that the dwarves would
have won the day. At best, they would have been able to somehow get back
inside Mithral Hall and secure the tunnels. At worst, all would have been lost.
The scope of the risk they had taken in coming out had never truly
registered to King Bruenor until that moment when he had been battling at the
riverbank at the southern base of the mountain arm, centering the three
groupings of dwarven forces. With Wulfgar north and Pwent and the main
force south, Bruenor had been struck by how tentative their position truly had
been, and only then had the dwarf king come to realize how much they had
gambled in coming out.
Everything.
"How're the ferry plans coming along?" he asked, needing to move on, to
look forward. It had been a victory, after all.
"Them Felbarrans're planning to string the raft so it's not free floating,"
Pwent explained. "Too much rough water south o' here to chance one getting
away. We should be getting it up in two or three days. Then we can get them
humans out o' the hall, and start bringing the proper stones across to start
building this side o' the bridge."
"And bring King Emerus across," came another voice, and the two turned
to see the approach of Jackonray Broadbelt, one arm in a sling from a spear
stab he'd suffered in the fighting.
"Emerus's coming?" Bruenor asked.
"He lost near to a thousand boys," Jackonray said grimly. "No dwarf king'd
let that pass without consecrating the ground."
"Me own priests've already done it, and the river, too," Bruenor assured
him. "And the blessings of yer own and of Emerus himself will only make the
road to Moradin's Halls all the easier for them brave boys that went down."
"Ye been there, so they're saying," said Jackonray. "Moradin's Halls, I
mean. A palace as grand as the tales, then?"
Bruenor swallowed hard.
"Aye, me king looked Moradin in the eye and said, 'Ye send me back to kill
them stinkin' orcs!' " Pwent roared.
Jackonray nodded and grinned wide, and Bruenor let it go at that. The tales
of his afterlife were flying wildly, he knew, with Cordio and the other priests
shouting them and embellishing them loudest of all. But for Bruenor, there

was nothing more.
Just the tales. Just the suppositions and the grand descriptions.
Had he been at Moradin's side?
The dwarf king honestly did not know. He remembered the fight at Shal-
lows. He remembered hearing Catti-brie's voice, as if from far, far away. He
remembered a feeling of warmth and comfort, but all of it was so vague to
him. The first clear image he could conjure after the disaster at Shallows had
been the face of Regis, as if the halfling and his magical ruby pendant had
reached right into his soul to stir him from his deep slumber.
"Who'd be missing that kind o' fun?" Pwent was asking when Bruenor
tuned back into the conversation.
He realized that Jackonray was hardly listening, and was instead just
standing and staring at Bruenor.
"We'll be honored to see yer great King Emerus," Bruenor assured him,
and he saw the Felbarran relax. "He can say his farewells to his boys and give
his honor to Nikwillig o' Felbarr, right after I'm giving him the honor of Mithral
Hall. 'Twas Nikwillig who won the day, not to doubt."
"It's a meeting long overdue, yerself and King Emerus," Jackonray agreed.
"And we'll get King Harbromm from Adbar down here soon enough. Let's see
them stupid orcs stand against the three kingdoms!"
"Kill 'em all!" Pwent roared, startling his two companions and drawing the
attention of everyone nearby, and being dwarves, they of course took up the
cheer.
*
*
*
*
*
They were all cheering again, except for Cottie Cooperson, of course, who
never even smiled anymore, let alone cheered. Word had come down the
tunnels that the eastern gate was open and the way would soon be clear to
ferry the refugees across the Surbrin and to the tamer lands southeast. Before
winter, they would all be in Silverymoon. And from there, in the spring, they
could go out, free of the dark stones of Mithral Hall.
Those cheers followed Delly Curtie as she carried Colson along the cor-
ridor from the gathering hall. Inside, she had been all smiles, offering support
and shoulder pats, assuring Cottie that she'd rebuild her life and maybe even
have more children. She had gotten only a broken and somewhat sour look in
response, for the brief moment that Cottie had lifted her teary-eyed gaze from
the floor.
Out there, Delly found it hard to break any kind of a smile. In there, she
supported the cheers, but outside they cut at her heart. They would all be
going across the Surbrin soon, leaving her as one of only four humans in
Mithral Hall.
She managed to keep her expression stoic when she entered her private
chambers to find Wulfgar inside, pulling a blood-stained tunic over his head.
"Is it yer own?" Delly asked, rushing to his side.
She held Colson tight against her hip with one arm, while her other hand
played over the barbarian's muscular frame, examining him for any serious
wounds.
"The blood of orcs," Wulfgar said, and he reached across and gently lifted
Colson from the woman's grasp. His face lit up as he brought the toddler up
high to stare into her eyes, and Colson responded with a giggle and a wriggle,
and a face beaming with happiness.

Despite her dour mood, Delly couldn't hold back her warm smile.
"It's secured to the river, they're saying," she said.
"Aye, from the mountain to the river and all along to the south. Pwent and
his gang are finishing up any pockets of orcs even now. There won't likely be
any living by morning."
"And they'll be floating the ferry then?"
Wulfgar glanced away from Colson just long enough to show his curiosity
at the woman's tone, and Delly knew that her voice had been a bit too eager.
"They will begin stringing the guide ropes tomorrow, yes, but I know not
how long the process will take. Are the folk of the razed lands anxious to be
on their way?"
"Wouldn't ye be, yerself, if Bruenor wasn't yer own father?"
Again Wulfgar turned to show her his perplexed expression. He started to
nod, but just shrugged instead.
"You are no child of Bruenor," he remarked.
"But I am the wife of Wulfgar."
Wulfgar brought Colson down to his hip, and when the toddler whined and
wriggled, he set her down to the floor and let her go. He came up straight
before Delly, facing her directly, and placed his huge hands on her slender
shoulders.
"You wish to cross the river," he stated.
"My place is with Wulfgar."
"But I cannot leave," Wulfgar said. "We have only begun to break free of
Obould's grasp, and now that we have a way beyond Mithral Hall's doors, I
must learn the fate of my friend."
Delly didn't interrupt him, for she knew all of it, of course, and Wulfgar was
merely reaffirming the truth of the situation.
"When the Surbrin east of Mithral Hall is more secure, have King Bruenor
find you a place working out there, in the sun. I agree that we are not built as
dwarves."
"The walls're closing in tight on me."
"I know," Wulfgar assured her, and he pulled her close. "I know. When this
is done—by summer, we hope—you and I will journey to all the cities you long
to see. You will come to love Mithral Hall all the more if it is your home and
not your prison." As he finished, he pulled her closer, wrapping his strong
arms around her. He kissed her on top of her head and whispered promises
that things would get better.
Delly appreciated the words and the gestures, though in her mind, they
hardly diminished the echoes of the cheers of the people who would soon be
leaving the smoky dark tunnels of King Bruenor's domain.
She couldn't tell that to Wulfgar, though, she knew. He was trying to
understand and she appreciated that. But in the end, he couldn't. His life was
in Mithral Hall. His beloved friends were there. His cause was there.
Not in Silverymoon, where Delly wanted to be.

20
A FRIENDLY DOSE OF REALITY
Two thousand mugs raised in toast, the dwarven holy water foaming over
the sides. Two thousand Battlehammer dwarves, every dwarf that could be
spared from the work out in the east or from the tunnels, cheered, "To the
Mirabarran Battlehammers!" Then as one, they drained their mugs, and
invariably splashed foam on beards yellow and red and white and orange and
black and brown and silver and even green.
"Oo oi!" came the shout from Pikel Bouldershoulder as soon as the toast
was finished.
That a non-Battlehammer and non-Mirabarran like Pikel had so perfectly
accentuated the celebration of Bruenor's clan for the immigrants from Mirabar
was a point not lost on Catti-brie. Sitting beside her father's dais, propped with
fluffy pillows—of which there were very few in all the halls—the woman
considered the unlikely collection represented in the gathering before her.
Most of the group were Bruenor's kinfolk, of course, some dwarves who
had lived in Mithral Hall before the coming of Shimmergloom the shadow
dragon, and others who had been raised as Battlehammers under the shadow
of Kelvin's Cairn in Icewind Dale. Others were Felbarran, coming in from the
east and seeming as much at home as the Battlehammers themselves.
Torgar and his boys were all there, even the many who had been wounded in
the fighting on the ridge north of Keeper's Dale or more recently in the fighting
in the south. Ivan and Pikel Bouldershoulder were there, and though they
weren't Battlehammers, every dwarf in the complex wanted them to become
of the clan. Nanfoodle the gnome was there, along with Regis, Wulfgar, and
Catti-brie.
So they were not all joined by blood, Catti-brie understood, but they were
certainly all joined by cause and by common resolve. She glanced over at her
father, sitting on his throne and draining another mug of mead, blessed as
holy water by the priests. His toasts and his appreciation were genuine, she
knew. He couldn't be happier or more full of gratitude concerning the arrival of
Torgar, Shingles, and the boys from Mirabar. They had saved the day over
and over again, from the northern stretches of the mountainous terrain to,
apparently, the work in the south. They had fought brilliantly with Banak
Brawnanvil north of Keeper's Dale, had pushed the entrenched orcs from the
tunnels so that Nanfoodle could work his magic on the ridge. They had
suffered terrible losses, but had done so with typical dwarven stoicism. The
losses would be worth the victory, and nothing short of victory was
acceptable.
It was all a reflection of her father, Catti-brie realized. Everything from
Torgar's decision to leave Mirabar to Citadel Felbarr's bold, if ill-advised,
attempt to cross the river was due in part to the character of Bruenor
Battlehammer.
Catti-brie could only smile as she looked upon her dear father.
Eventually, her gaze went across the dais to Banak, lying more than sitting,
propped in a carriage the woman feared would soon become his prison. He
had given his body for the cause—even the optimistic Cordio doubted that the
dwarf would ever walk again—and yet there he was, cheering and drinking
and with a bright smile gleaming out from between the whiskers of his hairy

old face.
It was a good day to be a Battlehammer, Catti-brie decided. Despite the
tragedy in the eastern breakout and their precarious position between Mithral
Hall and the Surbrin, despite the horde of orcs pressing in on them from every
side and the terrible losses they all had suffered, friends and kin forever lost, it
was a good day to be a Battlehammer.
She believed that with all her heart, and yet was not surprised at the feel of
a teardrop running down her soft cheek.
For Catti-brie had come to doubt.
She had lost Drizzt, she believed, and only in that realization did the
woman finally admit it all to herself. That she had loved him above all others.
That he alone had made her whole and made her happy. So many problems
had come between them, issues of longevity and children, and of the
perceptions of others—there it was, all before her and hopelessly lost. All
those imagined ills seemed so foolish, seemed the petty workings of
confusion and self-destruction. When Catti-brie had been down on the ground
and surrounded by goblins, when she had thought her life at its end, she had
found an emptiness beyond anything she had ever imagined possible. The
realization of her mortality had sent her thoughts careening along the notions
of things that should have been. Lost in that jumble, she had pushed Drizzt
away. Lost in that jumble, Catti-brie had forgotten that the future isn't a
straight road purposely designed by the traveler. The future is made of the
actions of the present, each and every one, the choices of the moment
inadvertently strung together to produce the desired trail. To live each and
every day in the best possible manner would afford her a life without regret,
and a life without regret was the key to an acceptance of inevitable death.
And now Drizzt was lost to her.
In all her life, would Catti-brie ever heal that wound?
"Are you all right?"
Wulfgar's voice was soft and full of concern, and she looked up to see his
blue eyes staring back at her.
"It's been a difficult time," she admitted.
"So many dead."
"Or missing."
The look on Wulfgar's face told her that he understood the reference. "We
are able to go out again," he said, "and so we must hope that Drizzt will be
able to come in."
She didn't blink.
"And if not, then we will go find him. You and I, Bruenor and Regis," the big
man declared. "Perhaps we will even convince Ivan and Pikel to join in the
hunt—the strange one talks to birds, you know. And birds can see all the
land."
She still didn't blink.
"We will find him," Wulfgar promised.
Another cheer rose up in the hall, and Bruenor called upon Torgar to come
forth and give a proper speech about it all. "Tell us what bringed ye here," the
dwarf king prompted. "Tell us all yer journeys."
Wulfgar's grin disappeared as soon as he looked back at Catti-brie, for her
expression was no less distant and detached, and no less full of pain.
"Do you need to leave?" he asked.

"I'm weary to the bone," she answered.
With great effort, the woman pulled herself out of her chair and leaned
heavily on the crutch Cordio had made for her. She began to take a shuffling
step forward, but Wulfgar caught hold of her. With a simple and effortless
movement, the large man swept her into his arms.
"Where're ye going, then?" Bruenor asked from the dais. Before him,
Torgar was giving his account to a thoroughly engaged audience.
"I'm needing a bit of rest, is all," said Catti-brie.
Bruenor held a concerned look for a few moments, then nodded and turned
back to Torgar.
Catti-brie rested her crutch across her body and put her head on Wulfgar's
strong shoulder. She closed her eyes and let him carry her from the
celebration.
*
*
*
*

Delly Curtie approached the audience chamber with good intent, deter-
mined to try to fit in, in the place that Wulfgar would always call home. She
told herself with every step that she had followed Wulfgar out of Luskan of her
own accord, with her eyes wide open. She reminded herself that her
responsibilities went far beyond the issues surrounding her relationship with a
man who seemed more at home beside the dwarves than with his own race.
She reminded herself of Colson, and the girl's well-being.
She would have to strike a middle ground, she decided. She would take
Wulfgar out of Mithral Hall as often as possible, and would stay with the folk of
the neighboring and predominantly human communities for extended periods.
She caught a quick glimpse of someone coming the other way through the
maze of anterooms, and from the size alone, she knew it had to be Wulfgar.
Her step lightened. She would make the seemingly untenable situation work.
As she came through a half-door and moved around one of the huge vats
the clerics used for their brewing, Delly caught sight of him again, more
clearly.
He didn't see her, she knew, because he was looking at the woman he was
carrying.
Delly's eyes widened and she threw herself behind the brew barrel, putting
her back to it and closing her eyes tightly against the sudden sting. She heard
Wulfgar and Catti-brie pass by on the other side, and watched them exit the
small room and continue on their way.
The woman exhaled and felt as if she was simply melting into the floor.

Lady Alustriel did not need to wait for the ferries to be running in order to
cross the Surbrin. The tall and beautiful woman, as accomplished in the magic
arts and in the arena of politics as anyone in all the world, brought her fiery
conjured chariot down on a flat stretch of ground just outside the opened
eastern door of Mithral Hall, sending dwarves scrambling for cover and
bringing a chorus of cheers and salutes from the Moonwood elves who held
firm in their position on the mountain spur.
Alustriel stepped from the chariot and dismissed it into a puff of smoke with
a wave of her hand. She straightened her dark robe and brushed her long
silver hair into place, at the same time fixing a properly somber expression
onto her delicate but determined features. It would be no easy visit, she knew,
but it was one she owed to her friend Bruenor.

With purpose in every stride, Alustriel moved to the door. The dwarf guards
fell aside, gladly admitting her, while one ran ahead to announce her to
Bruenor.
She found the dwarf king with two other dwarves and an elf, drawing up
plans for King Emerus Warcrown's arrival. The four stood up at her entrance,
even Bruenor dipping into a low and polite bow.
"Good King Bruenor," Alustriel greeted. "It is uplifting to see you well. We
had heard rumors of your demise, and truly a pall had befallen the lands of
goodly folk."
"Bah, got to tease 'em a bit, ye know," Bruenor replied with a wink. "Makes
my arrival all the more stunning and inspiring."
"I doubt that Bruenor Battlehammer needs aid in that manner."
"Always the kind one, ain't ye?"
Alustriel offered a quiet nod.
"I give ye Jackonray and Tred of Felbarr," Bruenor explained, pointing out
the dwarves, who both nearly fell over themselves trying to bow before the
great Lady of Silverymoon. "And this one's Hralien of the Moonwood. Never
thought me and me boys'd be so grateful to see a bunch o' elves!"
"We stand together," Hralien answered. "Or surely we shall all of us fall
before the darkness that is Obould."
"Aye, and glad I am that ye decided to come, good lady," Bruenor told
Alustriel. "Torgar o' Mirabar just returned from yer victory over them stinking
trolls, and he's telling a tale that yerself and Sundabar've decided to stay
back."
"His words are true, I fear," Alustriel admitted.
"Aye, ye're thinking to wait out the winter, and I'm not for arguing that,"
Bruenor said. "But we'd be smart to set our plans for the spring soon as we
can. We'll have a gnome's puzzling of it to get five armies working right." He
paused when he noticed that Alustriel was shaking her head with his every
word.
"What're ye thinking?" Bruenor asked her.
"I have come to confirm what Torgar has already told to you, my friend,"
said Alustriel. "We will hold Obould where he is, but it is not the decision of
Silverymoon, Everlund, and Sundabar to wage war against him at this time."
Bruenor was certain that his chin had hit the floor, so wide did his mouth fall
open.
"I have over flown the region you intend as a battlefield, and I tell you that
this orc king is a wise one. He is fortifying even now, digging in his warriors on
every mountaintop and preparing every inch of ground for a stubborn
defense."
"All the more reason we got to get rid of him here and now," Bruenor
argued, but again Alustriel shook her head.
"The cost will be too great, I fear," she said.
"But ye ran to Nesme's aid, didn't ye?" Bruenor couldn't completely
eliminate the sarcastic tone from his voice.
"We put the trolls back in the moor, yes. But they were not nearly as
formidable as the force that has arrayed against Mithral Hall from the north.
Tens of thousands of orcs have flocked to Obould's call."
"Tens of thousands who'll turn their weapons against yerself and yer
precious Silverymoon!"

"Perhaps," said Alustriel. "And in that event, they will face a stubborn and
determined defense. Should Obould press on, he will fight in ground of our
choosing and not his own. We will fight him from behind our walls, not assail
him behind his."
"And ye're to leave me and me kin out here alone?"
"Not so," Alustriel insisted. "You have opened the way to the river—I wish
that Silverymoon could have arrived in force to aid in that."
"A few hunnerd less Felbarrans'd be lying at the bottom of the river if ye
had," Tred dared to say, and his tone made it clear to all that he was no more
happy with Alustriel's surprising stance than was Bruenor.
"These are trying times," Alustriel offered. "I do not pretend to make them
seem better than they are. I come to you now to deliver a suggestion and a
promise from Silverymoon and from Sundabar. We will help you build the
bridge across the Surbrin, and we will help you to defend it and to hold open
the eastern door of Mithral Hall. I see that you are constructing fortifications
on the mountain spur north of the door—I will send batteries of archers and
catapults to aid in that defense. I will rotate wizards up there to stand shoulder
to shoulder with your warriors, offering fireballs against any who dare come
against you."
Bruenor's scowl did diminish a bit at that, but just a bit.
"You know me well, Bruenor Battlehammer," the Lady of Silverymoon said.
"When the drow marched upon Mithral Hall, my city came to your side. How
many of the Silver Guard fell in Keeper's Dale in that battle?"
Bruenor twitched, his expression softening.
"I wish as you wish, that Obould and his scourge of orcs could be wiped
from the lands for all time. But I have seen them. You cannot imagine the
enemy allied against you. If all the dwarves of Felbarr and Adbar, and all the
warriors of Silverymoon, Everlund, and Sundabar were to come to your side,
we would still have to kill our enemies five for every one of our own to begin to
claim a victory. And even then Obould's forces swell daily, with more orcs
pouring out of every hole in the Spine of the World."
"And even with that, ye're not thinking that he's meaning to stop where he
is?" Bruenor asked. "If his forces are swellin', the longer we... the longer you
wait, the bigger they swell."
"We have not abandoned you, my friend, nor would we ever," Alustriel said,
and she took a step toward Bruenor and gently reached up to place her hand
on his shoulder. "Every wound to Mithral Hall cuts deeply into the hearts of the
goodly folk of all the region. You will be the spur, the one shining light in a
region fallen to darkness. We will not let that light dim. On our lives, King
Bruenor, my friend, we will fight beside you."
It was not what he wanted to hear from Lady Alustriel, but it seemed as if it
was all he was going to get—and truly, it was a lot more than he had
expected, given Torgar's sour account of Alustriel's intentions.
"Let us weather the winter," Alustriel finished. "And let us see what promise
the spring brings."

21
GERTI'S DOORBELL
Snow whipped all around them, forcing both Drizzt and Innovindil to bend
low and lean into the wind to stop from being blown right over. The drow led
the way, moving as swiftly as he could manage, for the trail of the giants
remained clear to see, but would not last for long, he knew. Drizzt continually
worked his fingers in his sleeve, clenching and unclenching his fist in a futile
attempt to hold off the freezing. Innovindil had assured him that Shining
White, the home of Gerti, was not far away. The drow hoped that was true, for
he wasn't sure how long he and Innovindil could continue in such a blizzard.
By mid-morning the trail was all but overblown and Drizzt kept moving as
much on instinct as through his tracking abilities. He soldiered along as
straight as he could manage, and veered from the course only when he came
upon boulder tumbles or ravines that would have likely forced the giants'
caravan aside.
Around one such boulder tumble, the drow saw that he was guessing right,
for there in the middle of a shallow dell was a pile of manure, half-covered and
still steaming in the new-fallen snow. Drizzt made for it and bent low over it.
He brought a gloved hand down and separated the pieces, inspecting each.
"No blood in the stool," he told Innovindil when she crouched near him.
"Sunrise is eating well, despite the onset of deep winter," the elf agreed.
"Gerti is treating him as she would a valued pet," said the drow. "It bodes
well."
"Except that we can be certain now that she will not easily give up the
pegasus."
"Never was there any doubt of that," said Drizzt. "We came here to fight for
our friend, and so we shall." He looked up at Innovindil's fair face as he spoke
the pledge, and saw that she appreciated his words. "Come along," he bade
her, and started on his way.
Innovindil gave a tug on Sunset's reins to prompt the pegasus along, and
followed with a renewed spring in her step.
It didn't last long, though. The storm intensified, snow blowing across so
fiercely that Innovindil and Drizzt could hardly see each other if they moved
more than a few feet apart.
They got a bit of a reprieve when they passed around an eastern spur, for
the wind was from the northwest and suddenly both of those directions were
blocked by mountain walls. Drizzt put his back against the bare stone and
exhaled.
"If we can find a suitable overhang, perhaps we should put up for the day
until the storm blows over," he offered, and he was glad that he was able to
lower his voice without the wind to intercept and dissipate it.
He took another deep breath and pulled the frozen cowl back from his face.
He wiped the snow from his brow, chuckling helplessly when he realized that
his eyebrows were iced over, and he looked at his companion to see that she
was paying him no heed.
"Innovindil?" he asked.
"No need," the elf answered. "To camp, I mean."
She met Drizzt's gaze then motioned for him to look across the way.
The rock wall ran north for some distance, then bent back to the east.

Along that facing, a few hundred yards from them, Drizzt saw a gaping dark-
ness, a cave face in the stone.
"Shining White?"
"Yes," Innovindil answered. "An unremarkable entrance to a place rumored
to be anything but."
The two stood there a while, catching their breath.
"A plan?" Innovindil finally asked.
"Sunrise is in there," Drizzt answered. "So we go in."
"Just walk in?"
"Swords drawn, of course." He turned to his companion and offered a grin.
He made it sound so simple, which of course it was. They had come for
Sunrise, and Sunrise was inside Shining White, and so they collected them-
selves and moved along, staying close to the mountain wall where the snow
had not piled.
A dozen feet or so before the closest edge of the cave entrance, Drizzt
motioned for Innovindil to stay back and crept ahead. He came up straight at
the edge of the cave, then slowly bent and turned and peeked in.
He slipped around the edge, inching into a tunnel that widened almost
immediately to nearly twenty feet across. The drow froze, hearing deep and
steady breathing from across the way. He quick-stepped across the tunnel to
the other wall, then crept along to an alcove.
Inside, a seated giant leaned back against the wall, its hands tucked behind
its head, lips flapping with every snore. A massive maul lay across its
outstretched legs, the business end worked brilliantly into the design of an
eagle's head, with the sharp, hooked beak comprising the back side of the
head.
Drizzt crept in. He could tell that the behemoth was sleeping soundly, and
recognized that he could move right up and open wide its throat before it ever
knew he was there. To his surprise, though, he found himself sliding his
scimitars away. Gently, but with great effort, he lifted the maul from the giant's
lap, and the beast snorted and grumbled, bringing one hand down and turning
sideways.
Drizzt moved out of the alcove and back to the cave entrance, where
Innovindil and Sunset stood waiting.
"Fine weapon," he whispered, though it seemed as if he could hardly hold
the maul.
"You killed its wielder?" asked the elf.
"Fast asleep, and no threat to us."
Innovindil's curious expression reminded Drizzt of his strange choice.
Why hadn't he simply killed the giant; would that not be one less enemy to
battle?
His answer was just a shrug, though, and he put a finger to pursed lips and
bade the elf to quietly follow.
The three moved past the alcove on the opposite side of the corridor. Many
feet farther along, the tunnel turned sharply to the right, and there the roof
climbed much higher as well. A short way from the trio beamed a natural
skylight, some fifty feet or more from the floor, the gray light of the stormy day
streaming in. The floor became slick and some areas lay covered in snow.
Farther down, a pair of large doors loomed before them.
"Let us hope that they are not locked, and that they are well greased,"

Innovindil quietly remarked.
The three inched along, Sunset clip-clopping with every stride, the sharp
echoes making the other two more than a little nervous. Both the drow and
the elf entertained thoughts of leaving the pegasus outside, and would have
had it not been for the brutal storm.
Drizzt put his ear to the door and listened carefully for a long while before
daring the handle—or almost daring the handle. For as he reached up, the
ring being more than two feet above his head, he noted that its inner edge
was not smooth, with one particularly sharp lip to it. He retracted his hand
quickly.
"Trapped?" Innovindil asked.
Drizzt motioned that he did not know. He pulled off his cloak, then loosened
his enchanted, armored shirt so that he could pull one sleeve down over his
hand. He reached up again and slowly grasped the handle. He could feel the
sharp edge through the shirt, and he gingerly altered the angle of his grasp so
that the trap, if that's what it was, would not press on his palm.
"Ready to fight?" he mouthed to his companion, and he drew out Icing-
death in his left hand. When Innovindil nodded, Drizzt took a deep breath and
pulled the door ajar, immediately snapping his hand down across his body to
Twinkle, sheathed on his left hip.
But the sight that greeted the two had their hands relaxing almost imme-
diately. A warm glow washed out of the open door. Beyond the portal, that
light reflected brilliantly off of a myriad of walls and partitions, all made of
shining ice—not opaque and snowy, but clear and highly reflective. Images of
a drow, an elf, and a pegasus came back at the companions from every
conceivable angle.
Drizzt stepped in and found himself lost in a sea of reflected Drizzts. The
partitions were barely wide enough to admit a giant and sorted in a mazelike
manner that set off alarm bells in the wary drow's mind as soon as he
recovered from the initial shock of it all. He motioned to Innovindil to quickly
follow and rushed ahead.
"What is it?" the elf finally asked when she caught up to Drizzt as he
paused at a four-way intersection of shiny ice walls.
"This is a defense," Drizzt replied.
He looked around, soaking it in, confirming his fears. He noted the bare
stone floor, in such a sharp contrast to the walls, which seemed to have no
stone in them. He looked up to the many holes in the high ceiling, set
strategically from east to west along the southern reaches of the chamber,
designed, he realized, to catch the sunlight from dawn to twilight. Then he
sorted through his images, following the line across the breadth of the huge
chamber. A single sentry at any point along the wall would easily know of the
intruders.
Magic had created that hall of mirrors, Drizzt knew, and for a specific
purpose.
"Move quickly," the drow said even as he started off.
He dipped and darted his way through the maze, trying to find side aisles
that would reflect him in a confusing manner to any sentries. He had to hope
that any guards who might be posted to watch over the hall were, like the one
in the previous tunnel, less than alert.
No alarm horns had blown and no roars had come at him from afar. That

was a good sign at least, he had to believe.
Around one sharp bend, the drow pulled up short, and Innovindil, leading
Sunset right behind him, nearly knocked him forward onto his face.
Still Drizzt managed to hold back, absorbing the energy of the bump and
skittering to the side instead of forward, for he did not want to take another
step, did not want to step out onto the open, twenty-foot border of the eastern
end of the cavern. That border was a river, and though it was iced over, Drizzt
could clearly see the water rushing below the frozen surface.
Across the way and down to his left, the drow spotted another tunnel.
He motioned for Innovindil to carefully follow, then inched down the bank,
stopping directly across from the exit tunnel. Up above him, he saw a large
rope dangling—high enough for a giant to reach, perhaps, so that it might
swing across.
He heard Sunset clip-clopping back away from him and turned to see
Innovindil astride the pegasus, angling to line him up for a straight run to the
exit tunnel. With a grin, Drizzt sprinted back to her and clambered up behind
her, and the elf wasted no time in putting Sunset into a quick run and a short
leap, wings going out and beating hard. With grace more akin to a deer than a
horse, Sunset alighted across the frozen river in the tunnel and Innovindil
quickly pulled him up to a stop.
Drizzt was down in a flash, Innovindil following.
"Do you think they know we're here?" the moon elf asked.
"Does it matter?"
Now the corridors became more conventional, wide, high, and winding,
maze-like, with many turns and side passages. The enormity of Shining White
surprised Drizzt, and the enormity of their task became more than a little
daunting.
"Guenhwyvar will smell Sunrise out," he said as he pulled out the figurine.
"More likely to smell your blood, I suspect," came an answer from a voice
that was not Innovindil's, that was far too deep and resonant to belong to an
elf.
Drizzt turned slowly, as did his companion, and Sunset pawed the stone.
A pair of frost giants stood calmly some twenty feet or so behind them, one
with hands on her hips, the other holding a massive hammer in his right hand
patting it onto his left.
"You bring a second pegasus for Dame Gerti," the female remarked. "She
will be pleased—perhaps enough so to allow you a quick death."
Drizzt nodded and said, "Aye, we have come to please Gerti, of course.
That is our greatest desire."
He slapped Sunset on the rump as he finished, and Innovindil went up
astride the pegasus even as it leaped away.
Drizzt turned to follow, took a few steps, then, hearing the giants charging
in behind, he cut a quick turn and charged at them, howling with fury.
"Drizzt!" Innovindil shouted, and he knew by her tone that she had con-
cluded that he meant to engage the behemoths.
Nothing could have been farther from his thoughts.
He rushed at the one holding the hammer, and as it started to swing at him
he cut to the right, toward the second giant.
The first was too clever to continue its attack—an attack that likely would
have struck its companion. But as the female behemoth reached for Drizzt he

turned anyway again, back toward the first, his feet, their speed enhanced by
magical anklets, moving in a blur. He dived into a roll, turning sidelong as he
went so that he came up short and cut back to his right, which sent him
rushing right between the giants. Both of them lurched in to grab at him, and
the female might have had him, except that the pair knocked heads halfway
down.
Both grunted and straightened, and Drizzt ran free.
Barely ten strides down the next corridor, though, the drow heard the
shouts of more giants, and he had to turn into yet another perpendicular cor-
ridor so that he didn't run headlong into a behemoth.
"No dead ends," the drow whispered—a prayer if he ever heard one—with
every blind turn.
He soon came into a wider corridor lined on both sides with statues of
various shapes and size. Most were of ice, though a few of stone. Some were
giant-sized, but most reflected the stature of a human or an elf. The detailing
and craftsmanship was as finely worked as dwarven stone, and the elegance
of the artwork was not lost on the drow—the statues would not have seemed
out of place in Menzoberranzan or in an elven village. He had little time to
pause and admire the pieces, though, for he heard the giants behind him and
in front, and horns blowing from deeper in the seemingly endless complex.
He pulled his cloak from his shoulders and cut to the side, toward a cluster
of several elf-sized statues.

Innovindil could only hope that the floor stayed stone and was not glazed
over with ice, for she could ill afford to allow Sunset to slow the run with giants
scrambling all around her. She came upon corridor after corridor, turning
sometimes and running straight at others, meaning to turn at some others and
yet finding a group of enemies coming at her from that direction.... A blind run
was the best the elf could manage. Or a blind flight, for every now and then
she put the pegasus up into the air to gain speed. She had to take care,
though, for airborne, Sunset could not navigate the sharp, right-angled turns.
Innovindil watched ahead and behind, and looked up repeatedly. She kept
hoping that the ceiling would open up before her so that she could lift Sunset
into a short flight, perhaps one that would get them both out through a natural
chimney or a worked skylight.
At one corner, the elf and her pegasus nearly slammed into the stone wall,
for the angle of the turn proved to be more than ninety degrees. Sunset
skidded to a rough stop, brushing the stone as Innovindil brought the pegasus
about.
Innovindil sucked in her breath as they realigned and she prompted the
pegasus to run again, for that moment of stillness left her vulnerable, she
knew.
And so she was only a little surprised when she saw a gigantic spear of
ice—a long, shaped icicle—soaring at her from down the previous corridor.
She ducked instinctively, and if she had not, she would have been skewered.
Even with the near miss, the elf was almost dislodged, for the spear shattered
on the stone above her and a barrage of ice chips showered over her.
Stubbornly holding her seat, Innovindil kicked her heels into Sunset's flank
and bade him to run on. She heard a shout behind her and to the side, from
whence the spear had come, and she understood enough of the frost giant

language, which was somewhat akin to Elvish, to understand that a giantess
was berating the spear thrower.
"Do you want to hurt Gerti's new pet?"
"The pegasus or the elf?" the giant answered, his booming voice echoing
off the stone behind Innovindil.
"Both, then!" the giantess laughed.
For some reason, their tone made Innovindil think that catching the spear in
her chest would have been preferable.
*
*
*
*
*
Two giants charged down the corridor, only occasionally glancing to either
side until one suddenly lurched to the left and gave a victorious shout.
The other yelled, "Clever!" when it, too, noticed the cloak on the statue—a
cloak not carved of stone, but flowing as only fabric could.
With a single stride to the side, the first giant brought a heavy club to bear,
crushing down on the cloak. The ice statue beneath it exploded into a shower
of shards and splinters.
"Oh, you broke Mardalade's work!" the other shouted.
"T-the drow?" the first stammered and dropped its club.
"Finds you quite amusing," came an answer from behind, and both giants
spun around.
Drizzt, skipping down the other way, paused long enough to offer a salute,
then a smile as he pointed back behind the behemoths.
Neither turned—until they heard the low growl of a giant panther.
The two giants spun and ducked as six hundred pounds of black-furred
muscle leaped over them, cutting close enough so that both threw up their
hands and ducked even lower, one falling to the stone.
Drizzt sprinted away. He used the moment of reprieve to try to sort out the
maze of crisscrossing corridors. He listened carefully to the sounds all around
him, too, trying to make some sense of them. Shouts from unrelated areas
told him that Innovindil was still running, and gave him a fairly good idea of
her general direction.
He sprinted away, back to the west, then north, then west again. He heard
the clip-clop of the running pegasus as he approached the next four-way
intersection, and ran harder, thinking to catch hold of his friend as she passed
through, and leap up behind her.
But he slowed, quickly abandoning that notion. Better that the giants had
two targets, he realized.
Innovindil and Sunset crossed in front of him, head down and flying fast,
with the pegasus a few feet off the ground. Though he could not help but
pause and admire the elf's handling of the winged horse, Drizzt clearly heard
the approach of giants not far behind. He picked up his pace again, and as a
pair of giants ran through the intersection in fast pursuit of the elf, Drizzt
rushed out right behind them, and managed to slash one in the back of the leg
as he passed, drawing a howl of pain.
That one stopped and the other slowed, both turning to regard the running
dark elf.
The wounded one then fell flat to his face, as a great panther sprang
against the back of his neck, then leaped away. Three more giants poured
into the intersection, and all five shouted wildly.
"Left!"

"Right!"
"Straight ahead!"
"The elf, you fools!"
"The drow!"
And all of that, of course, only gave Drizzt and Innovindil a bit more
breathing room.
Around and around they went, and Drizzt crossed corridors he recognized.
At another intersection, he heard the clip-clop of Sunset's hooves again, and
he got there first. Again he thought of jumping up astride the pegasus, and
again he abandoned the notion, for still more giants bobbed along behind his
fleeing companion.
Drizzt stood at the corner, leaning out enough so that Innovindil noticed
him. He pointed across the way, to the tunnel on the approaching Innovindil's
left. She responded by bringing Sunset over to the right, near Drizzt, in a
wider banking turn.
"Right, left, second right, and straight to the river!" the drow shouted as she
thundered past.
Drizzt ducked back behind the corner. He heard giants approaching from
behind him, as well as the ones coming in pursuit of Innovindil; he glanced
both ways repeatedly and nervously, hoping that Innovindil's pursuit would
arrive first.
His relief was sincere and deep when he saw that they would. Still focusing
on the pegasus-riding elf, the giants came on at full speed, and were caught
by complete surprise when Drizzt leaped around the corner beside them and
shouted at them.
They stopped and fell all over themselves trying to get at him, and he ran
off back the way they had come, and the confusion of all the giants increased
many times over when the group previously chasing Drizzt also scrambled
into the intersection in a wild tangle.
Drizzt's smile widened; he couldn't deny that he was enjoying himself!
But then he was in a storm of pelting sleet, a small black cloud roiling at the
ceiling high overhead and stinging him with hailstones as big around as his
feet. The stone below him grew almost instantly slick and he went into a
controlled slide, holding his precarious balance.
Of course, as soon as he hit a drier spot, his foot kicked out behind him and
he had to fall into a roll. He looked back as he did, and noted one of the
giantesses in the tumult of the intersection staring down his way and waggling
her huge fingers once more.
"Oh, lovely," the drow said. He put his feet under him and ran off as fast as
he could manage on the slippery floor.
He sensed the lightning bolt an instant before it flashed, and he dived down
and to the side. His fall sped along as the bolt clipped him. He had to ignore
the burning and numbness in his arm, though, for the giants—both groups—
came on in fast pursuit.
Drizzt ran for his life, with all speed, hoping his guess of the layout was
correct. He had sent Innovindil on a roundabout course that he hoped would
get him to a specific intersection at the same time as the swifter pegasus.
With the ice storm and the lightning bolt, that wouldn't happen even if his
quick calculations had been correct.
He saw her cross the intersection before him, in a straight run for the frozen

river and the escape tunnels. She looked back as he came out right behind
her, following her course.
"Run on!" he cried, for he knew that she had no time to pause and wait.
Giants were on his heels, including that nasty spellcaster—and wouldn't she
love to have all the intruders in a line before her in a long, straight tunnel.
"Leap it! Fly across!" Drizzt implored Innovindil as she neared the frozen
river, and she did, bringing Sunset into a quick flight that carried her to solid
ground on the other side. No fool, she, the elf pulled up on the reins, then
turned the pegasus aside and moved down the bank, just a few feet out of the
tunnel's line of sight.
Drizzt came up on the river right behind her, the giants closing fast. Not
even slowing in the least, the drow dived headlong, thinking to slide across
and begin his run once more. He saw Innovindil as he hit the ice on his belly,
the elf calling to him.
He heard a loud grunt from the other side, to his right and up above, and
rolled onto his side just in time to see a huge rock soaring down at him,
thrown by a giant who was perched upon a ledge.
"Drizzt!" Innovindil yelled.
The drow tucked and turned, and caught a handhold, for he could see that
the rock's aim had been true. Slowing his progress, he avoided being
crushed, but the rock hit the ice right in front of him and crashed through. The
drow, helpless in his slide, went into the icy waters.
"Drizzt!" Innovindil yelled again.
Hanging by a finger, the cold current pulling at him relentlessly, Drizzt
managed to offer her a single shrug.
Then he was gone.

INNER VOICES
Ye must do this, Delly Curtie told herself over and over again, every step of
the way through the dwarven complex. As sure as she was that what she was
doing was for the best—for everyone involved—Delly needed constant
reminders and assurances, even from herself.
Ye cannot stay here, not a minute longer.
Bah, but she's not yer child anyway, ye silly woman!
It's for his own good more'n yer own, and she's a better woman than ye'd
ever be!
Over and over, the woman played out all the rationalizations, a litany that
kept her putting one foot in front of the other as she neared the closed door to
Catti-brie's private room. Colson stirred and gave a little cry, and Delly hugged
the girl tighter against her and offered a comforting coo.
She came up to the door and pressed her ear, then hearing nothing,
pushed it open just a bit, paused, and listened again. She heard Catti-brie's
rhythmic breathing. The woman had returned exhausted a short while before
from the audience chamber, announcing that she needed some sleep.
Delly moved into the room. Her first emotions upon seeing Catti-brie
swirled within her, a combination of anger and jealousy, and a desperate feel-
ing of inferiority that gnawed at her belly.
No, ye put it all aside! Delly silently determined, and she forced herself
closer to the bed.
She felt the doubts crawling up within her with every step, a cacophony of
voices telling her to hold on to Colson and never let go. She looked down on
Catti-brie as the woman lay there on her back, her thick auburn hair framing
her face in such a manner as to make her appear small, almost childlike. Delly
couldn't deny her beauty, the softness of her skin, the richness of her every
feature. Catti-brie had lived a good life, but a difficult one, and yet, she
seemed somehow physically untouched by the hardships—except for her
current injury, of course. For all her battles and swordfights, not a blemish was
to be found on the woman's face. For a brief moment, Delly wanted to claw
her.
A very brief moment, and Delly drew a deep breath and reminded herself
that her own nastiness was more a negative measure of herself than any
measure of Catti-brie.
"The woman's not ever shown ye an angry look nor offered ye a harsh
word," Delly quietly reminded herself.
Delly looked to Colson, then back to Catti-brie.
"She'll make ye a fine mother," she whispered to the baby.
She bent low, or started to, then straightened and hugged Colson close
and kissed her atop the head.
Ye got to do this, Delly Curtie! Ye cannot be stealing Wulfgar's child!
But that was the thing of it, she realized. Wulfgar's child? Why was Colson
anymore Wulfgar's child than Delly Curtie's? Wulfgar had taken the babe from
Meralda of Auckney at Meralda's desperate request, but since Delly had
joined up with him and Colson in Luskan, she, not Wulfgar, had been more
the parent by far. Wulfgar had been off in search of Aegis-fang, and in search
of himself. Wulfgar had been out for days at a time battling orcs. And all the

while, Delly had held Colson close, had fed her and rocked her to sleep, had
taught her to play and even to stand.
Another thought came to her then, bolstering her maternal uprising. Even
with Colson in his care and Delly gone, would Wulfgar stop fighting? Of
course not. And would Catti-brie abandon her warrior ways after her wounds
healed?
Of course not.
Where did that leave Colson?
Delly nearly cried out at the desperate thought. She spun away from the
bed and staggered a step toward the door.
You are entitled to the child, and to a life of your own making, said the
voice in her head.
Delly kissed Colson again and stepped boldly across the room, thinking to
walk away without looking back.
Should everything good happen to her? the voice asked, and the reference
to Catti-brie was as clear to Delly as if it was her own inner voice speaking.
You give and give of yourself, but your own good intentions bring to you
desperation, said the voice.
Aye, and empty tunnels o' dark stone, and not a one to share me thoughts,
Delly answered, not even aware that she was having a conversation with
another sentient being.
She reached the door then, but paused, compelled to look to the side.
Catti-brie's gear was piled on a small bench, her armor and weapons covered
by her worn traveling cloak. One thing in particular caught Delly's eye and
held it. Peeking out from under the cloak was a sword hilt, fabulous in design
and gleaming beyond anything Delly had ever seen. More beautiful than the
shiniest dwarf-cut gem, more precious than a dragon's mound of gold. Before
she even knew what she was doing, Delly Curtie slipped Colson down to the
side, balancing her on one hip, and took a fast step over and with her free
hand drew the sword out from under the cloak and out of its scabbard at the
same time.
She instantly knew that the blade was hers and no one else's. She instantly
realized that with such a weapon, she and Colson could make their way in a
troubled world and that all would be right.
Khazid'hea, the sentient and hungry sword, was always promising such
things.

She opened her eyes to see a comforting face staring back at her, crystal
blue orbs full of softness and concern. Before she even fully registered who it
was and where she was, Catti-brie lifted her hand to stroke Wulfgar's cheek.
"You will sleep your life away," the big man said.
Catti-brie rubbed her eyes and yawned, then allowed him to help her sit up
in her bed.
"Might as well be sleeping," she said. "I'm not doing much good to anyone."
"You're healing so that you can join in the fight. That's no small thing."
Catti-brie accepted the rationale without argument. Of course she was frus-
trated by her infirmity. She hated the thought of Wulfgar and Bruenor, and
even Regis, standing out there on the battle line while she slumbered in
safety.
"How goes it in the east?" she asked.

"The weather has held and the ferry is functional. Dwarves have come
across from Felbarr, bearing supplies and material for the wall. The orcs strike
at us every day, of course, but with the help of the Moonwood elves, they
have been easily repelled. They have not come on in force, yet, though we do
not know why."
"Because they know we'll slaughter them all across the mountains."
Wulfgar's nod showed that he did not disagree. "We hold good ground, and
each passing hour strengthens our defenses. The scouts do not report a
massing of orcs. We believe that they too are digging in along the ground they
have gained."
"It'll be a winter of hard work, then, and not much fighting."
"Readying for a spring of blood, no doubt."
Catti-brie nodded, confident that she'd be more than ready to go back out
into the fighting when the weather turned warm.
"The refugees from the northern settlements are leaving even now,"
Wulfgar went on.
"The way out is safe enough to risk that?"
"We've got the riverbank for a mile and more to the south, and we've put
the ferry out of throwing range of any giants. They'll be safe enough—likely
the first of them are already across."
"How clear is it up there?" Catti-brie asked, not even trying to hold the
concern out of her voice.
"Very. Perhaps too much so," Wulfgar answered, misreading her concern,
and he paused, apparently catching on. "You wonder if Drizzt will find his way
to us," he said.
"Or if we can find our way to him."
Wulfgar sat on the edge of the bed and stared at Catti-brie for a long, long
while.
"Not so long ago you told me he wasn't dead," he reminded. "You have to
hold onto that."
"And if I cannot?" the woman admitted, lowering her eyes for even voicing
such a fear.
Wulfgar cupped her chin with his huge hand and tilted her head back so
that she had to look him in the eye. "Then hold on to your memories of him,
though I do not believe he is dead," he insisted. "Better to have loved . .."
Catti-brie looked away.
After a moment of confusion, Wulfgar turned her back yet again. "It is better
to have loved him and lost him than never to have known him at all," he
stated, reciting one of the oldest litanies in all corners of the Realms. "You
were lovers; there is nothing more special than that."
Telltale tears welled in Catti-brie's deep blue eyes.
"You ... you told me ..." Wulfgar stammered. "You said that in your years on
the boat with Captain Deudermont.. ."
"I didn't tell you anything," she replied. "I let you assume."
"But. . ."
Wulfgar paused, replaying that conversation he and Catti-brie had shared
during their trials out on the battle line with Banak. He had asked her pointedly
about whether or not she and Drizzt had become more than friends, and
indeed she had not answered directly, other than to refer to the fact that they
had been traveling as companions for six long years.

"Why?" Wulfgar finally asked.
"Because I'm thinking myself the fool for not," Catti-brie said. "Oh, but we
came close. We just never .. . I'm not wanting to talk about this."
"You wanted to see how I would react if I believed that you and Drizzt were
lovers," Wulfgar said, and it was a statement not a question, indicating that he
had it all figured out.
"I'll not deny that."
"To see if Wulfgar had healed from his torment in the Abyss? To see if I
had overcome the demons of my upbringing?"
"Don't you get all angry," Catti-brie said to him. "Maybe it was to see if
Wulfgar was deserving of a wife like Delly."
"You think I still love you?"
"As a brother would love a sister."
"Or more?"
"I had to know."
"Why?"
The simple question had Catti-brie rocking back in her bed. "Because I
know it's farther along with me and Drizzt," she said after only a brief pause.
"Because I know how I feel now, and nothing's to change that, and I wanted to
know how it would affect yourself, above all."
"Why?"
"Because I'd not break up our group," Catti-brie answered. "Because we
five have forged something here I'm not wanting to lose, however I'm feeling
about Drizzt."
Wulfgar spent a long while staring at her, and the woman began to squirm
under that scrutiny.
"Well, what're you thinking?"
"I'm thinking that you sound less like a dwarf every day," he answered with
a wry grin. "In accent, I mean, but you sound more like a dwarf every day in
spirit. It's Bruenor who's cursed us both, I see. Perhaps we are both too
pragmatic for our own good."
"How can you say that?"
"Six years beside a man you love and you're not lovers?"
"He's not a man, and there's the rub."
"Only if your dwarven practicality makes it a rub."
Catti-brie couldn't deny his tone or his smile, and it infected her soon
enough. The two shared a laugh, then, self-deprecating for both.
"We've got to find him," Wulfgar said at length. "For all our sakes, Drizzt
must come back to us."
"I'll be up and about soon enough, and out we'll go," Catti-brie agreed, and
as she spoke, she glanced across the way at her belongings, at the
weathered traveling cloak and the dark wood of Taulmaril peeking our from
under it.
At the scabbard that once held Khazid'hea.
"What is it?" Wulfgar asked, noticing the sudden frown that crossed the
woman's face.
Catti-brie led his gaze with a pointing finger. "My sword," she whispered.
Wulfgar rose and crossed to the pile, pulling off the cloak and quickly
confirming that, indeed, the sword was gone,
"Who could have taken it?" he asked. "Who would have?"

While Wulfgar's look was one of confusion and curiosity, Catti-brie's
expression was much more grave. For she understood the power of the
sentient sword, and she knew that the person who pulled Khazid'hea free of
its scabbard had gotten more than he'd bargained for.
Much more.
"We have to find it, and we have to find it quickly," she said.

It is not for you, came the voice in Delly's head as she moved toward the
waiting ferry. All around her dwarves worked the stone, smoothing the path
from the door to the river and building their defenses up on the mountain spur.
Most of the human refugees were already aboard the ferry, though the dwarf
pilot had made it quite clear that the raft wouldn't put out for another few
minutes.
Delly didn't know how to answer that voice in her head, a voice she thought
her own.
"Not for me?" she asked aloud, quietly enough to not draw too much
attention. She masked the ridiculous conversation even more by turning to
Colson and acting as if she was speaking to the toddler.
Are ye daft enough to think ye should go back into the mines and live yer
life with the dwarfs, then? Delly asked herself.
The world is wider than Mithral Hall and the lands across the Surbrin, came
an unexpected answer.
Delly moved off to the side, behind the screen of a lean-to one of the
dwarves had put together for the workers to take breaks out of the cold wind.
She set Colson on a chair and started to set her pack down—when she real-
ized that the second voice wasn't coming from in her head at all, but from the
pack. Gingerly, Delly unwrapped Khazid'hea and once the bare metal of the
hilt was in her hand that voice rang all the more clearly.
We are not crossing the river. We go north.
"So the sword's got a mind of its own, does it?" Delly asked, seeming more
amused than concerned. "Oh, but ye'll bring me a pretty bit o' coin in
Silverymoon, won't ye?"
Her smile went away as her arm came out, drifting slowly and inexorably
forward so that Khazid'hea's tip slid toward Colson.
Delly tried to scream, but found that she could not, found that her throat
had suddenly constricted. Her horror melted almost immediately, however,
and she began to see the beauty of it all. Yes, with a flick of her hand she
could take the life from Colson. With a mere movement, she could play as a
god might.
A wicked smile crossed Delly's face. Colson looked at her curiously, then
reached up for the blade.
The girl nicked her finger on that wickedly sharp tip, and began to cry, but
Delly hardly heard her.
Neither did Delly strike, though she had more than a little notion to do just
that. But an image before her, the bit of Colson's bright red blood on the
sword, on her sword, held her in place.
It would be so easy to kill the girl. You cannot deny me.
"Cursed blade," Delly breathed.
Speak aloud again and the girl loses her throat, the sentient sword
promised. We go north.

"You—" Delly started to say, but she bit the word off in horror. You would
have me try to get out of here to the north with a child in tow? she silently
asked. We'd not get past the perimeter.
Leave the child.
Delly gasped.
Move! the sword demanded, and never in all her life had Delly Curtie heard
such a dominating command. Rationally, she knew that she could just throw
the sword to the ground and run away, and yet, she couldn't do it. She didn't
know why, she just could not do it.
She found her breathing hard to come by. A multitude of pleas swirled
through her thoughts, but they wound in on themselves, for she had no real
answer to the commands of Khazid'hea. She was shaking her head in denial,
but she was indeed stepping away from Colson.
A nearby voice broke her from her torment momentarily, and Delly surely
recognized that particular wail. She spun to see Cottie Cooperson moving
toward the ferry, where the pilot was barking for everyone to hurry aboard.
We cannot leave her, Delly pleaded with the sword.
Her throat... so tender... Khazid'hea teased.
They will find the child and come for us. They will know that I did not cross
the Surbrin.
When no rebuttal came back at her, Delly knew she had the evil sword's
attention. She didn't really form any cogent sentences then, just rambled
through a series of images and thoughts so that the weapon would get the
general idea.
A moment later, Khazid'hea wrapped and tucked under her arm, Delly ran
for the ferry. She didn't explain much to Cottie when she arrived and handed
Colson to the troubled woman, but then she really didn't have to explain
anything to Cottie, who was too wrapped up in the feel and smell of Colson to
hear her anyway.
Delly waited right there, until the pilot finally shouted down at her, "Away we
go, woman. Get yerself aboard!"
"What're ye about?" asked one of the other passengers, a man who often
sat beside Cottie.
Delly looked at Colson, tears welling in her eyes.
She had a fleeting thought to tear out the toddler's throat.
She looked up at the pilot and shook her head, and as the dwarf tossed the
ferry ropes aside, freeing the craft into the river, Delly stumbled off the other
way, glancing back often.
But ten steps away, she didn't bother to even look back again, for her eyes
were forward, to the north and the promises that Khazid'hea silently imparted,
promises that had no shape and no definition, just a general feeling of elation.
So caught was Delly Curtie by the power of Khazid'hea that she gave
Colson not another thought as she worked her way through the workers and
the guards, stone by stone, until she was running free north along the
riverbank.

"Halt!" cried an elf, and a dwarf sentry beside him echoed the shout. "Stop
yer running and be counted!" the dwarf cried.
More than one elf lifted a bow toward the fleeing figure, and dwarven
crossbows went up as well. More shouts ensued, but the figure was out of

range by then, and gradually the bows began to lower.
"What do ye know?" Ivan Bouldershoulder asked the dwarf sentry who had
shouted out. Behind him, Pikel lifted his hand to the sky and began to chatter
excitedly. The dwarf sentry pointed far to the north along the riverbank, where
the figure continued to run away.
"Someone run out, or might that it was an orc scout," the dwarf replied.
"That was no orc," said the elf bowman beside them. "A human, I believe,
and female."
"Elfie eyes," the dwarf sentry whispered to Ivan, and he gave an exag-
gerated wink.
"Or might be half-orc," Ivan reasoned. "Half-orc scout might've wandered in
with the others from the northern towns. Ye best be tightening the watch."
The elf nodded, as did the dwarf, but when Ivan started to continue his line
of thought, he got grabbed by the shoulder and roughly tugged back.
"What're ye about?" he asked Pikel, and he stopped and stared at his
brother.
Pikel held tight to Ivan's shoulder, but he was not looking at his brother. He
stared off blankly, and had Ivan not seen that druidic trick before, he would
have thought his brother had completely lost his mind.
"Ye're looking through a bird's eyes again, ain't ye?" Ivan asked and put his
hands on his hips. "Ye durned doo-dad, ye know that's always making ye
dizzier than usual."
As if on cue, Pikel swayed, and Ivan reached out and steadied him. Pikel's
eyes popped open wide, and turned and stare at his brother.
"Ye back?" Ivan asked.
"Uh-oh," said Pikel.
"Uh-oh? Ye durned fool, what'd ye see?"
Pikel stepped up and pressed his face against the side of Ivan's head, then
whispered excitedly in Ivan's ear.
And Ivan's eyes went wider than those of his brother. For Pikel had been
watching through the eyes of a bird, and that bird, on his bidding, had taken a
closer look at the fleeing figure.
"Ye're sure?" Ivan asked.
"Uh huh."
"Wulfgar's Delly?"
"Uh huh!"
Ivan grabbed Pikel and tugged him forward, shoving him out toward the
north. "Get a bird watching for us, then. We gotta go!"
"What're ye about?" the dwarf sentry asked.
"Where are you going?" echoed the elf archer.
"Go send the word to Bruenor," Ivan shouted. "Catch that ferry and search
the tunnels, and find Wulfgar!"
"What?" dwarf and elf asked together.
"Me and me brother'll be back soon enough. No time for arguing. Go tell
Bruenor!"
The dwarf sentry sprinted off to the south, and the Bouldershoulder
brothers ran to the north, heedless of the shouts that followed them from the
many surprised sentries.

MUTUAL BENEFIT
The storm had greatly abated, but the day seemed all the darker to Inno-
vindil as she sat on Sunset staring back at the cave entrance to Shining
White. From what she could tell the giants had pursued her as far as the inner
door, and the sentry out in the corridor was still contentedly snoring when she
and Sunset had galloped past.
The elf knew that she should be on her way and should not linger out there.
She knew that giants could be creeping out of secret passageways onto
ledges along the mountain wall, perhaps very near to her and up above. She
feared that if she glanced right or left at any time, she might see a boulder
soaring down at her.
But Innovindil didn't look to the sides, and did not prompt Sunset to move
off at all. She just sat and stared, hoping against all logic that Drizzt Do'Urden
would soon come running out of that cavern.
She chewed her lip as the minutes passed. She knew it could not be so.
She had seen him go into the rushing river, swept away below a sheet of ice
through which he could not escape. The river didn't flow out aboveground
anywhere in the area, from what she could see and hear, so there was
nothing she could do.
Nothing at all.
Drizzt was lost to her.
"Watch over him, Tarathiel," the elf whispered into the wind. "Greet him in
fair Arvandor, for his heart was more for the Seldarine than ever for his dark
demon queen." Innovindil nodded as she spoke those words, believing them
in her heart. Despite the black hue of his skin, Drizzt Do'Urden was no drow,
she knew, and had not lived his life as one. Perhaps he was not an elf in
manner and thought, either, though Innovindil believed that she could have
led him in that direction. But her gods would not reject him, she was certain,
and if they did, then what use might she have for them?
"Farewell my friend," she said. "I will not forget your sacrifice, nor that you
entered that lair for the sake of Sunrise, and for no gain of your own."
She straightened and started to twist, moving to tug the reins to the right so
she could be on her way, but again she paused. She had to get back to the
Moonwood—she should have done that all along, even before Tarathiel had
fallen to Obould's mighty sword. If she could rally her people, perhaps they
could get back to Shining White and properly rescue Sunrise.
Yes, that was the course before her, the only course, and the sooner Inno-
vindil began that journey, the better off they would all be.
Still, a long, long time passed before Innovindil found the strength to turn
Sunset aside and take that first step away.

He scrambled and clawed, kicked wildly, and flailed his arms as he tried
desperately to keep his face in the narrow pocket of air between the ice and
the cold, cold water. Instinct alone kept Drizzt moving as the current rushed
him along, for if he paused to consider the pain and the futility, he likely would
have simply surrendered.
It didn't really seem to matter, anyway, for his movements gradually slowed
as the icy cold radiated into his limbs, dulling his muscles and weakening his

push. With every passing foot and every passing second, Drizzt slowed and
lowered, and he found himself gasping water almost constantly.
He slammed into something hard, and the current drove him atop it so that
he was granted a reprieve for a few moments, at least. Holding his perch on
the rock, the drow could keep his mouth in an air pocket. He tried to punch up
and break through the ice, but his hand slammed against an unyielding
barrier. He thought of his scimitars and reached down with one hand to draw
out Twinkle. Surely that blade could cut through—
But his numb fingers couldn't grasp the hilt tightly enough and as soon as
he pulled the scimitar free of its sheath, the current took it from his grasp. And
as he lurched instinctively for the drifting and falling blade, Drizzt was swept
away once more, turning as he went so that his head dipped far under the icy
water.
He fought and he scrambled, but it was all for naught, he knew. The cold
was taking him, permeating his bones and inviting him to a place of a deeper
darkness than Drizzt had ever known. He wasn't seeing anything anymore in
the black swirl of water, and even if there had been light, Drizzt would not
have seen, for his eyes were closed, his thoughts turning inward, his limbs
and sensibilities dying.
Distantly, the drow felt himself jostled about as the underground river
turned and dipped. He crashed though a rocky area, but hardly felt anything
as he bounced from one stone to the next.
Then the river dropped again, more steeply, as if plunging over a waterfall.
Drizzt fell hard and landed harder and felt as if he had wedged up against the
ice, his neck bent at an awkward angle. The cold sting knifed at his cheek and
pressed inward.

Innovindil moved east from Shining White, keeping the higher mountains
on her left and staying within the shadow of those peaks. For she knew she
would need them to shelter her from the icy wind when night fell, and to shield
the light of the campfire she would have to make.
She didn't dare bid Sunset to take to the air, for the gusts of wind could
bring catastrophe. It occurred to her that perhaps she should turn south, run-
ning to the better weather and to the dwarves of Clan Battlehammer. Would
they help her? Would they march beside her all the way to Shining White to
rescue a pegasus?
Probably not, Innovindil knew. But she understood, though it surely pained
her to admit it, that she would not likely get back to Shining White before the
spring thaw.
She could only hope that Sunrise would last that long.

Drizzt's misperception surprised him when he realized he was not pressed
up against the underside of the ice sheet, but was, rather, lying atop it. With a
groan that came right from his aching bones, the drow opened his eyes and
propped himself up on his elbows. He heard the rush of the waterfall behind
him and glanced back that way.
The river had thrown him free when he'd come over that drop, and he had
gone out far enough, just barely, to land upon the ice sheet where it resumed
beyond the thrashing water.
The drow coughed out some water, his lungs cold and aching. He rolled

over and sat on the ice, but spread right back out again when he heard it
crackling beneath him. Slowly and gingerly, he crept toward the stone wall at
the side of the river, and there he found a jag where he could sit and consider
his predicament.
He really hadn't gone that far in his watery journey, he realized—probably
not more than fifty feet or so from where he'd fallen through, not counting the
two large steps downward.
Drizzt snapped his hands to his belt to feel Icingdeath, but not Twinkle, and
he grimaced as he recalled losing the scimitar. He glanced back up at the
waterfall wistfully, wondering how in the world he might retrieve the blade.
Then he realized almost immediately that it didn't really matter. He was
soaking wet and the cold was going to kill him before any giants ever could.
With that thought in mind, the drow forced himself up on unsteady feet and
began inching along the wall, keeping as much of his weight as possible
against the stone, and stepping from rock to rock wherever he found the
opportunity. He traveled only a few hundred feet, the sound of the waterfall
still echoing behind him, when he noted a side passage across the way,
fronted by a landing that included a rack of huge fishing poles.
He didn't really want to move back into Shining White, but he saw no
choice. He lay down on his belly on the ice, maneuvering himself so that he
was clear of all the rocks poking up through it. Then he pushed off, sliding out
across the frozen river. He scraped and crawled and managed to get across
then he went up to the landing and beyond, moving along an upward-sloping
tunnel.
A short while later, he went back on his guard, for the tunnels became
wider and more worked, with ornate columns supporting their ceilings, many
of which were frescoed with various designs and artwork. At one point, he
ducked back just in time as a pair of giants ambled across an intersection not
far ahead.
He waited for them to clear the way, and ...
What? he wondered. Where was he to go?
The giants had crossed left to right, so Drizzt went to the left, moving as
swiftly as his still numb and sorely aching legs would allow, knowing that he
needed to get to a fire soon. He fought to keep his teeth from chattering, and
his eyelids felt so very heavy.
A series of turns and corridors had him moving into the more populated
reaches of the complex, but if the giants were at all bothered by the continuing
cold, they certainly didn't show it, for Drizzt saw no sign of any fires anywhere.
He kept going—what choice did he have?—though he knew not where, and
knew not why.
A cry from behind alerted him that he had been seen, and the chase was
on once more.
Drizzt darted around a corner, sprinted some thirty feet, then ducked fast
around another turn. He ran on, down a corridor lined with statues, and one
that he recognized! On the floor lay a broken statue, along with the drow's
own traveling cloak. He scooped it as he passed, wrapped it tight around him,
and sprinted on as more and more giants took up the chase. He had his
bearings, and he looked to make every turn one that would take him closer to
the exit.
But every turn was blocked to him, as giants paralleled him along tunnels

running closer to the exit. He found every route of escape purposefully
blocked. He was being herded. Drizzt couldn't stop, though, unless he
planned to fight, for a pair of giants chased him every stride, closing whenever
he slowed. He had to turn left instead of right, and so he did, cutting a tight
angle around the next corner and running on for all his life. He turned the next
left, thinking that perhaps he could double back on the pair chasing him.
That way, too, was blocked.
Drizzt turned right and rushed through some open doors. He crossed a
large chamber, and the two giants within howled and joined in the chase.
Through another set of doors, he came to the end of the hallway, though it
turned both left and right. Thinking one way as good as the other, the drow
banked left and ran on—right into another large room, one sporting a huge
round table where a group of frost giants sat and played, rolling bones for
piles of silver coins.
The table went over, coins and bones flying everywhere, as the behemoths
jumped up to leap after the drow.
"Not good," Drizzt whispered through his blue lips and chattering teeth.
The next door in line was closed, and the drow hardly slowed, leaping hard
against it, shouldering it in. He stumbled and squinted, for he had come into
the brightest-lit room in the complex. He tried to reorient himself quickly, to put
his feet under him and continue on his way.
Whichever way that might be.
For he had come into a large oval chamber, decorated with statues and
tapestries. Heads of various monsters—umber hulks, displacer beasts, and
even a small dragon among them — lined the walls as trophies. Drizzt knew
he wasn't alone, but it wasn't until he noted the dais at the far end of the room
that he truly appreciated his predicament. For there sat a giantess of
extraordinary beauty, decorated with fabulous clothing and many bracelets,
necklaces and rings of great value, and wearing a white gown of fabulous
texture and fabric. She leaned back in her seat and crossed her bare and
shapely legs.
"I do so love it when the prey delivers itself," she said in the common
tongue, her command of it as perfect as Drizzt's own.
The drow heard the doors bang closed behind him, and one of the pursuing
giants graced him with an announcement. "Here is the drow you wanted,
Dame Orelsdottr," the giant said. "Drizzt Do'Urden is his name, I believe."
Drizzt shook his head and brought a hand up to rub his freezing face. He
reached low with the other one, pulling forth Icingdeath—and as he did, he
heard giant sentries to either side of him bristle and draw weapons. He looked
left and right, noting a line of spears and swords all pointing his way.
With a shrug, the drow dropped his scimitar to the floor, put his foot atop it
and slid it out toward Gerti.
"Not even a fight from the famed Drizzt Do'Urden?" the giantess asked.
Drizzt didn't answer.
"I would have expected more of you," Gerti went on. "To surrender before
dazzling us with your blade work? Or do you believe that you spare your life
by giving yourself up to me? Indeed you are a fool if you do, Drizzt Do'Urden.
Gather your scimitar if you will. Take up arms and at least try to fight before
my soldiers crush the life out of you."
Drizzt eyed her hatefully, and thought to do as she asked. Before he could

begin to calculate his chances of getting the blade and quick-stepping ahead
to at least score a hit or two upon Gerti's pretty face, however, a low and feral
growl from the side of the giantess caught his, and her attention.
Gerti turned and Drizzt leveled his gaze, and every giant in the chamber
followed suit, to see Guenhwyvar perched on a ledge barely fifteen feet from
Gerti, level with her pretty face.
The giantess didn't blink and didn't move. Drizzt could see her tightening
her grip on the white stone arms of her great throne. She knew the panther
could get to her before she could even raise her hands in defense. She knew
Guenhwyvar's claws would tear at her blue and tender skin.
Gerti swallowed hard.
"Perhaps now you are more in the mood for a bargain," Drizzt dared to say.
Gerti flicked a hateful glance his way then her gaze snapped back to the
threatening cat.
"She probably won't be able to kill you," Drizzt said, his freezing jaw hurting
with every word. "But oh, will anyone ever look upon Dame Gerti Orelsdottr
again and marvel at her beauty? Take out her pretty eye, too, Guenhwyvar,"
Drizzt added. "But only one, for she must see the expressions on the faces of
those who look upon her scarred visage."
"Silence!" Gerti growled at him. "Your cat might wound me, but I can have
you killed in an instant."
"And so we must bargain," Drizzt said without the slightest hesitation. "For
we both have much to lose."
"You wish to leave."
"I wish to sit by a fire first, that I might dry and warm myself. Drow are not
so comfortable in the cold, particularly when we are wet."
Gerti snorted derisively. "My people bathe in that river, winter and
summer," she boasted.
"Good! Then one of your warriors can retrieve my other scimitar. I seem to
have dropped it under the ice."
"Your blade, your fire, your life, and your freedom," Gerti said. "You ask for
four concessions in your bargain."
"And I offer back your eye, your ear, your lips, and your beauty," Drizzt
countered.
Guenhwyvar growled, showing Gerti that the mighty panther understood
every word, and was ready to strike at any time.
"Four to four," Drizzt went on. "Come now, Gerti, what have you to gain by
killing me?"
"You invaded my home, drow."
"After you led the charge against mine."
"So I free you and you find your elf companion, and again you invade my
home?" Gerti asked.
Drizzt nearly fell over with relief upon learning that Innovindil had indeed
gotten away.
"We will come back at you only if you continue to hold that which belongs to
us," said the drow.
"The winged horse."
"Does not belong as a pet in the caves of frost giants."
Gerti snorted at him again, and Guenhwyvar roared and tamped down her
hind legs.

"Surrender the pegasus to me and I will be on my way," said Drizzt. "And
Guenhwyvar will disappear and none of us will ever bother you again. But
keep the pegasus, kill me if you will, and Guenhwyvar will have your face. And
I warn you, Gerti Orelsdottr, that the elves of the Moonwood will come back
for the winged horse, and the dwarves of Mithral Hall will join them. You will
find no rest with your stolen pet."
"Enough!" Gerti shouted at him, and to Drizzt's surprise, the giantess
started to laugh.
"Enough, Drizzt Do'Urden," she bade him in quieter tones. "But you have
asked me for something more; you have upped my end of the bargain."
"In return—" Drizzt started to reply, but Gerti stopped him with an upraised
hand.
"Tell me not of any more body parts your cat will allow me to keep," she
said. "No, I have a better bargain in mind. I will get your blade for you and let
you warm before a great fire, all the while feasting on as much food as you
could possibly eat. And I will allow you to walk out of Shining White—nay, to
ride out on your precious winged horse, though it pains me to allow so
beautiful a creature to wander away from me. I will do all this for you, and I will
do more, Drizzt Do'Urden."
The drow could hardly believe what he was hearing, and that sentiment
seemed common in that chamber, where many giants stood with their mouths
drooping open in amazement.
"I am not your enemy," said Gerti. "I never was."
"I watched your people bombard a tower with great boulders. My friends
were in that tower."
Gerti shrugged as if it did not matter and said, "I, we, did not begin this war.
We followed an orc of great stature."
"Obould Many-Arrows."
"Yes, curse his name."
That raised Drizzt's eyebrows.
"You wish to kill him?" Gerti asked.
Drizzt didn't answer. He knew he didn't have to.
"I wish to witness such a battle," Gerti said with a vicious little grin.
"Perhaps I can deliver King Obould to you, Drizzt Do'Urden. Would that
interest you?"
Drizzt swallowed hard. "Now it would seem that you have upped your own
end of the bargain even more," he reasoned.
"Indeed I have, so accept it with two promises. First, you will kill Obould.
Then you will broker a truce between Shining White and the surrounding
kingdoms. King Bruenor's dwarves will not seek retribution upon my people,
nor will Lady Alustriel, nor any other allies of Clan Battlehammer. It will be as
if the giants of Shining White never partook in Obould's war."
It took Drizzt a long time to digest the startling words. Why was Gerti doing
this? To save her beauty, perhaps, but there was so much more going on
than Drizzt could begin to understand. Gerti hated Obould, that much was
obvious—could it be that she had come to fear him, as well? Or did she
believe that the orc king would falter in the end, with or without her treason,
and the result would prove disastrous for her people? Yes, if the dwarves of
the three kingdoms joined with the folk of the three human kingdoms, would
they stop with the orcs, or would they press on to exact revenge upon the

giants as well?
Drizzt glanced around and noted that many of the giants were nodding and
grinning, and those whispering amongst themselves all seemed in complete
accord with Gerti's proposal. He heard naysayers, but they were not loud and
dominant.
It began to make sense to Drizzt as he stood there shivering. If he won,
then Gerti would be rid of a rival she surely despised, and if he lost, then Gerti
would be no worse off.
"Orchestrate it," Drizzt said to her.
"Pick up your fallen scimitar, then, and dismiss your panther."
Alarms went off in Drizzt's head, suspicion twisting his black face. But Gerti
seemed even more relaxed.
"Before all my people, I give you my word, Drizzt Do'Urden. Among the
giants of the Spine of the World, our word is the most precious thing we own.
If I deceive you now, would any of my people ever believe that I would not do
the same to them?"
"I am no frost giant, so I am inferior in your eyes," Drizzt argued.
"Of course you are," Gerti said with a chuckle. "But that changes nothing.
Besides, it will amuse me greatly to watch you battle King Obould. Speed
against strength, a fighter's tactics against a savage fury. Yes, I will enjoy that.
Greatly so." She finished and motioned toward the scimitar again.
Drizzt stared her in the eye for a long moment.
"Be gone, Guenhwyvar," he instructed.
The panther's ears flicked up and she turned to regard Drizzt curiously.
"If she betrays me, the next time you come to the material plane, seek her
out and steal her beauty," Drizzt said.
"My word is not to be broken," said Gerti.
"Be gone, Guenhwyvar," Drizzt said again, and he stepped forward and
retrieved Icingdeath. "Go home and find your rest, and rest assured that I will
call upon you again."

AT THE BEHEST OF OTHERS
Drizzt led Sunrise out of Shining White the next morning, well aware that
Gerti's giants were watching his every step. The air was calm and warmer, the
sun shining brilliantly against the new-fallen snow.
The drow stretched and adjusted his clothing and cloak, and the belt that
held both his scimitars once more. Not twenty steps from the front, he turned
and looked back at Shining White, still amazed that Gerti had stayed true to
her word, and that she had cut the deal with him in the first place. He took that
as a hopeful sign regarding the future of the region, for Gerti Orelsdottr and
her frost giant army apparently held no heart for continuing the war, and
perhaps equally important, apparently held no bond of friendship with Obould
Many-Arrows. Gerti wanted the orc king dead almost as much as Drizzt did, it
seemed, and if that was true of the giantess, might it also be true of some of
Obould's rival orc chieftains? Would attrition play on the massive army,
defeating it where the dwarves could not?
That hopeful thought was quickly replaced by another, for Drizzt realized
that if Gerti really could arrange for him to meet Obould, he could accelerate
that disintegration of the invading force. Without the orc king as figurehead,
the chaotic creatures would turn on each other, day after day and tenday after
tenday.
Drizzt clenched his hands and rolled his fingers, flexing the muscles in his
forearms, chasing the last vestiges of the river's cold bite from his bones. As
Innovindil had killed Obould's son, so he would strike an even greater blow.
The thought of his elf companion had him shielding his eyes with one hand
and scanning the sky, hoping to spot a flying horse. He wanted to spring upon
Sunrise's back and put the pegasus up high to gain a wider view of the region,
but Gerti had strictly forbidden that. In fact, Sunrise was wearing a harness
that would prevent the pegasus from spreading wide his wings.
Gerti was offering a bargain, but she was doing it on her terms and with her
guarantees.
Drizzt accepted that with a nod, and continued to scan the skies. He had
the pegasus with him. He had his scimitar back from the cold waters, and he
had his life. After the disaster of his foray into Shining White, those things
were more than he had imagined possible.
And he might get a fight with the hated Obould. Yes, Drizzt realized, things
had worked out quite well.
So far.

Gerti sat on her great throne eyeing the giants milling around in the audi-
ence chamber. She had surprised them all, she knew, and the looks that
came her way reflected suspicion as much as curiosity. Gerti knew that she
was gambling. Her father, the great Jarl Orel who had united the many
families of giants in the Spine of the World under his iron-fisted rule, lingered
near death, leaving Gerti as the heir apparent. But it would be the first transfer
of power since the unification, and that, Gerti knew, was no small thing.
She had followed the advice of Ad'non Kareese and Donnia Soldou and
had joined with Obould's grand ambitions, leading her people out of their
mountain homes in forays that were initially intended to be low-risk and short-

lived, quick strikes using orc fodder to bear the losses, and frost giants to
collect the gains. Ironically, Obould's successes had upped the ante for Gerti,
and dangerously so, she had come to understand as Obould had gained more
and more power in their relationship. Obould was making her look small and
insignificant to her minions, and that was something Gerti knew she could ill
afford. And so she had orchestrated her abandonment of Obould. But even
that, she knew, had been a risk. For if the orc king had continued his
conquering ways, or even if he could simply solidify and hold onto his already
considerable gains, Gerti's people would have paid an exaggerated price—
more than thirty frost giants had died in the campaign—for relatively minor
gains in loot. The price Gerti herself would also pay in terms of stature could
not be ignored.
A lone drow had given her an opening to change the equation, and she
considered her bargain with Drizzt to be less of a gamble than those around
her understood. The price had been nothing more than relinquishing the
pegasus—true, the winged horse seemed a shiny bauble, but it was hardly of
practical use to her. The gain?
That was the one variable, and the only part of any of it that seemed a
gamble to Gerti. For if Drizzt killed Obould, then Gerti's abandonment of the
orc's cause would seem prudent and wise, and even more so if Drizzt then
followed through with his promise to relay the giantess's desire for a truce to
the formidable enemies that would no doubt rush in to expel the leaderless
orcs from their conquered lands. Might Gerti then salvage some practical
gains from that ill-advised campaign, perhaps even the opening of trading
routes with the dwarves of Mithral Hall?
The danger lay in the very real possibility that Obould would slay Drizzt,
and thus gain even more stature among his subjects, if that was possible. Of
course, in that eventuality, Gerti could claim to the orc king that she had
delivered Drizzt to him for just that purpose. Perhaps she could even spin it to
make it seem as if she, and not Obould, was truly the puppet-master.
"The winged horse was more trouble than it was worth," Gerti said to a
nearby giantess who flashed her one of those suspicious and curious looks.
"It was beautiful," the giantess replied.
"And its beauty would bring an unending string of elves to Shining White,
seeking to free it."
More curious looks came at her, for when had Gerti ever been afraid of the
lesser races entering Shining White?
"Do you really wish to have the elves with their stinging bows sneaking into
our home? Or the cunning dwarves digging new tunnels to connect to our
lesser-used ways, insinuating themselves among us, popping up by surprise
and smashing their ugly little hammers into our kneecaps?"
She saw a few nods among the giants as she explained, and Gerti weighed
the various looks carefully. She had to play it just right, to make her maneu-
vering seem clever without reminding them all that her initial blunder had
brought all of the risk and trouble to them in the first place. It was all about the
message, Gerti Orelsdottr had learned well from her wise old father, and that
was a message she meant to tightly control over the next few tendays, until
the pain of losses faded.
If Drizzt Do'Urden managed to kill Obould, that message would be easier to
shape to her advantage.

The same storm that had dumped heavy snows on the mountains near
Shining White swirled to the southeast, bringing high winds and driving, cold
rain, and whipping the waters of the Surbrin so forcefully that the Felbarran
dwarves tied the ferry up on the eastern bank and retreated into sheltering
caves. As anxious as they were to be on their way to Silverymoon, the human
refugees did not dare to try their luck in the terrible weather, and so they, too,
put up in those caves.
Cottie Cooperson made herself as inconspicuous as possible, staying in
the back and at the very edges of the firelight, with Colson fully wrapped in a
blanket. The others soon learned of the child, of course, and questioned
Cottie.
"What'd ye do to its mother?" one man asked, and he bent low and forced
Cottie to look at him squarely, demanding an honest answer.
"I seen Delly handing the child to Cottie of her own accord," another
woman answered for the poor and lost Cooperson lass. "Right at the dock,
and she run off."
"Run off? Or just missed the ferry?" the suspicious man demanded.
"Run off," the woman insisted. "Of her own choosing."
"She wanted the child out of Mithral Hall while they're fighting," Cottie lied.
"Then the dwarves should know they've got an adopted granddaughter of
King Bruenor among their passengers," the man reasoned.
"No!" shouted Cottie.
"No," added the supportive woman. "Delly's not wanting that stubborn fool
Wulfgar to know of it, as he'd be wanting the child back."
It made no sense, of course, and the man stood and turned his glare over
the other woman.
"Bah! What business is it o' yer own, anyway?" she asked.
"None," another man answered. "And no one's a better mother than Cottie
Cooperson."
Others seconded that remark.
"Then it's our own secret, and no business to them grumpy dwarves," the
woman declared.
"Ye think Wulfgar's to be seeing it that way?" the doubting man argued. "Ye
want the likes o' that one and his fierce father chasing us across all the
lands?"
"Chasing us to what end?" the woman beside Cottie replied. "To get his
child back? Well then we'll give him the little girl back, and no one's to argue."
"He'll come with rage in his eyes," the man argued.
"And it'll be rage he'll have to put on his wife, from where I'm sitting," said
another man. "She give the child to Cottie to care for, and so Cottie's to care
for the girl. Wulfgar and Bruenor got no right to anything but appreciation in
that!"
"Aye!" several others loudly agreed.
The doubting man stared at Cottie's allies long and hard, then turned back
to Cottie herself, who was hugging Colson as warmly as any mother ever
could hold her own child.
He could not deny that the sight of Cottie with the child warmed his heart.
Cottie, who had been through so very much pain, seemed content for perhaps
the first time in all their trials. Even with his fears for the vengeance of

Wulfgar, the man could not argue against that simple truth. He gave an
accepting smile and a nod.

All construction of defenses along the mountain spur slowed during those
hours of the storm, and the rain and sleet pelted the elves and dwarves who
walked their patrols. They even dared to lessen those watches, for no
enemies would come against them in the gale—or so they believed.
Similarly, Ivan and Pikel Bouldershoulder found their progress slowed to a
crawl. Pikel's animal friends, who had guided them far north of the dwarves'
position in pursuit of Delly Curtie, were still hunting at the behest of the doo-
dad, but with lower and shorter flights and with very limited visibility.
"Durned fool woman," Ivan grumbled over and over again. "What's she
thinking in running out o' Mithral Hall?"
Pikel squeaked to show his own confusion.
Ivan kicked at a stone, silently questioning his own decision to chase her
out. They were more than a day's march from the mountain spur, and likely
well behind the orc lines, though they hadn't seen any of the wretches in their
march.
The dwarf truly hoped that they would not have to resort to Pikel's "root-
walking" tricks to get back to Bruenor's boys.
"Durned fool woman," he grumbled and kicked another stone.

Compelled by the ever-hungry Khazid'hea, Delly Curtie was among the
very few creatures wandering around outside in the cold storm. Exhausted,
soaking wet, cold and miserable, the woman never entertained a single
thought of finding shelter and stopping her march, because the sword would
not let such a notion filter through her mind.
Khazid'hea held her, fully so. Delly Curtie had become an extension of the
sword. Her entire existence was focused upon pleasing Khazid'hea.
The sword was not appreciative.
For though Delly was a willing slave, she was not what Khazid'hea coveted
most of all: a worthy wielder. And so as darkness fell over the land and Delly's
eyes conveyed to the sword the image of a distant campfire, the weapon
compelled her to move toward it with all speed.
For hours she walked, often falling and skinning her legs, one time slipping
on an icy rock so that she slammed her head and nearly knocked herself
unconscious.
What am I doing out here, anyway? I meant to go to Silverymoon, or
Sundabar, and yet here I am, walking wild lands!
That flicker of cogent thought only made Khazid'hea reinforce its com-
pulsion over her, dominating her and making her trudge along, one foot in
front of the other.
Khazid'hea felt her fear some time later, when they heard the guttural
voices of the encamped creatures, the language of orcs. But the vicious
sword took that fear and transformed it, bombarding poor Delly with images of
her child being massacred by those same orcs, turning her terror into red rage
so completely that she was soon running headlong for the camp. Khazid'hea
in hand she burst into the firelight, killing the nearest surprised orc with a
single thrust of the fabulous blade, that drove its tip right through a blocking
forearm and deep into the orc's chest.

Delly yanked the blade free and swiped wildly at the next orc in line,
slashing a deep cut through the trunk of a hardwood tree as the creature
ducked aside. She pursued wildly, stabbing and slashing, and the orc
managed one block, which took the end off its simple spear, before falling
back in fear.
Something hit Delly in the side, but she hardly felt it, so consumed was she,
and she pressed forward and stuck the retreating creature in its ugly face
again and again, slashing and beating it, sending lines of bright blood flying
into the air. She tasted that blood and was too outraged and too consumed to
be revolted.
Again something hit her in the side, and she whirled that way, thinking that
an orc was punching at her. A moment of clarity led to a moment of confusion
as the woman regarded her attacker, standing across the campfire from her,
bow in hand.
Delly glanced down to her side, to see two arrows deeply embedded, then
looked back in time to watch the orc pull back its bowstring once more.
Khazid'hea overwhelmed her with an image of that very orc biting out
Colson's throat, and the woman shrieked and charged.
And staggered back from the weight of an arrow driving into her chest.
With a growl, Delly held her feet, glaring at the archer, stubbornly taking a
step toward the orc. She never heard its companion creeping up behind her,
never heard the sword rushing for her back.
She arched, eyes going to the night sky, and a moment of peace came
over her.
She noticed Selune then, gliding overhead, trailed by her glittering tears,
through a patch of broken clouds, and she thought it a beautiful thing.
Khazid'hea fell from her grasp, its sharp tip digging into the ground so that it
stayed upright, waiting for a more worthy wielder to take it in its grasp.
The sword felt its connection with Delly Curtie break completely and knew
itself to be an orphan.
But not for long.

GERTI'S AMUSEMENT
Drizzt watched the approach of two of Gerti's messengers from a sheltered
dell a mile to the east of Shining White's entrance. The drow had quickly
learned the limits of Gerti's trust, for he had been told explicitly that he could
not remove Sunrise's harness, and he knew well that his every move was
being carefully monitored. If he tried to run away, the giants would rain
boulders upon him and the pegasus.
The drow believed that Gerti trusted him, though, for why would she not?
Certainly his desire to do battle with Obould was honestly placed and stated!
No, all the "precautions" Gerti was taking were more a show for her own
people, he understood—or at least, he had to believe. He had been around a
wise leader all his life, a dwarf who knew what to do and how to present it—
two very different things—and he understood the politics of his current
situation.
Of course, Gerti might just be using him to get a chance at killing Obould,
with no intention of ever letting Drizzt and Sunrise go after the battle,
whatever the outcome. So be it, Drizzt had to accept, for he had really found
no options in that chamber in Shining White. All had been lost, then she'd
offered at least a glimmer of hope.
The two giants entered Drizzt's dell and tossed a bag of food and a
waterskin at his feet.
"A substantial force of orcs is moving east of here, along the border of the
mountains to a high pass," said one, a giantess of no small beauty.
"Sent by King Obould to aid in the construction of a large city he plans in
that defensible place," the other added. Muscular and wide-shouldered even
by the standards of his huge race, the male's face was no less handsome
than that of his female companion, with light blue skin and silvery eyebrows
that turned into a V whenever he furrowed his brow.
"Dark Arrow Keep," said the giantess. "You would do well to remember that
name and relay it to your allies should you escape all of this."
The implications of the report were not really surprising to Drizzt. On his
journey north to Shining White, he had seen clear signs that the orc king
intended to dig in and hold his conquered ground. The construction of a major
city, and one in the defensible high ground of the Spine of the World—from
which more and more orcs continued to rally to his cause—seemed a logical
course to that end.
"Obould is not with the caravan, though," the giantess explained. "He is
moving from mountain to mountain, overseeing the work on many lesser
keeps, and reminding the orcs who they serve."
"With his shamans," added the other. "And likely a pair of dark elves serve
as his wider eyes—are they known to you?"
Drizzt's expression was all the answer the giants needed.
"You killed a pair of those drow, we know," the giant went on. "These two
are, or were, their companions. They were sent to the south with the troll
army, but they will return. They will hold a grievance toward Drizzt Do'Urden,
no doubt."
"Murder and warfare are so common among my people that they just as
likely won't," Drizzt replied, and he shrugged as if it didn't matter, for of course

it did not. If the two drow were with Obould, then they were already his
enemies.
"We will move in the morning," the giantess said. "Gerti hopes to meet up
with Obould within three days."
She wants him dead before his grand designs can take real shape, Drizzt
thought, but did not reply.
Every added bit of information about Obould's movements reinforced
Gerti's deal with him. The giantess saw a war coming beyond anything in her
power to influence. Or, in the absence of that war, she saw her own position
greatly diminishing before the rise of King Obould Many-Arrows.
Delivering Drizzt to Obould might prove a gamble to Gerti, Drizzt under-
stood, for it was likely that Obould's stature would only climb if he proved
victorious. The fact that Gerti was willing to take that chance showed Drizzt
just how desperate she was becoming.
Obould was taking full control, so Gerti believed that she had nothing to
lose.
The drow thought it odd that his victory over Obould would so greatly
benefit Gerti Orelsdottr, a giantess he would hardly claim as an ally in any
cause. He remembered the bombardment of Shallows, the callous disregard
Gerti's warriors had shown for the poor besieged people of the village as they
had launched boulder after boulder their way.
Yet, if he proved victorious and killed Obould, and the orc forces began to
scatter and turn on themselves in the absence of a strong leader, Drizzt was
then bound to parlay on behalf of those same giants for a truce.
The drow nodded grimly and accepted the notion then in his heart, as he
had previously accepted it in his thoughts when his very life had been at
stake. Better for everyone if the war could simply end, if the dark swarm of
orcs could be pushed back into their holes and the land reclaimed for the
goodly folk. What gain would there be in then pursuing an attack upon Shining
White, in which hundreds of dwarves and their allies would be slain?
"Are you ready to fight him?" the giantess asked, and when Drizzt looked at
her, he realized he'd been so wrapped up in his thoughts that he'd missed the
question the first few times she'd asked it.
"Three days," he agreed. "Obould will die in three days."
The giant and giantess looked to each other and grinned, then walked off.
Drizzt replayed his pledge many times, letting it permeate his bones and
his heart, letting it become a litany against all the pain and loss.
"Obould will die in three days," he repeated aloud, and his lips curled
hungrily.
*
*
*
* *
The two giants down the trail to his right kept Sunrise under close guard,
but they were not holding Drizzt's attention that cold and clear morning. Up to
his left, on a barren and rocky hilltop, Gerti Orelsdottr and King Obould stood
in the sunlight, talking and arguing.
She had orchestrated all of it, had set Drizzt in place within an easy and
swift climb to the appointed spot, then had brought Obould out here alone for
a parlay.
The orc didn't seem suspicious at all to Drizzt, he appeared at ease and
supremely confident. Obould had been a bit on his guard when he and Gerti
first arrived at the hilltop, but after a few minutes of pointing and talking, the

orc visibly relaxed.
They were discussing the construction of defenses, Drizzt knew. All the
way out there, a full four days of marching south from Shining White, Drizzt
had witnessed the unveiling of King Obould's grand designs. Many hilltops
and mountainsides were under construction in the north, with rock walls taking
shape and the bases of large keeps already set in place. On an adjoining
mound to the one where the two principals stood, a hundred orcs toiled at the
stone, preparing strong defenses.
Those sights only heightened Drizzt's sense of urgency. He wanted to kill
Obould for what the orc had done to his friends and to the innocents of the
North; he needed to kill Obould for the sake of those remaining. It was not the
behavior that Drizzt had come to expect from an orc. Many times, even back
in Menzoberranzan, he had heard others remark that the only thing truly
subjugating goblinkind to the other races was the lack of cohesion on their
part. Even the superior minded matron mothers of Menzoberranzan had
remained leery of their goblin and orc slaves, knowing that a unified force of
the monsters, weak as they might be individually, could prove to be an
overwhelming catastrophe.
If Obould truly was that unifying force, at least in the Spine of the World, he
had to die.
Many minutes passed, and Drizzt subconsciously grasped at his scimitar
hilts. He glanced nervously at the adjoining hilltop, where several other orcs—
shamans, they appeared—kept a watch on their leader, often moving to the
closest edge and peering across at the two figures. Their interest had faltered
over the past few minutes, but Drizzt knew that would likely be a temporary
thing.
"Hurry up, Gerti," he whispered.
The drow stepped back into the shadows, startled, for almost as if she had
heard his plea, Gerti turned away from Obould and stormed off, moving down
the mountainside with swift, long strides.
So surprised was he that Drizzt nearly missed the moment. Obould,
apparently caught off his guard by Gerti's sudden retreat, stood there gaping
at her, hands on his hips, eyes staring out from behind that curious skull-like
helm with its oversized, glassy goggles.
The drow shook himself from his hesitation and bounded up the slope,
moving fast and silently. He came atop the hillock just a few strides from the
orc, and thought for a moment to rush in and stab his enemy before Obould
even knew he was there.
But the orc king spun on him, and Drizzt had skidded to a stop anyway.
"I had thought you would never dare to stand without an ally," the drow
said, and his scimitars appeared in his hands—almost magically, it seemed,
so fast and fluid was his movement.
A low growl escaped Obould's lips as he regarded the drow.
"Drizzt Do'Urden?" he asked, the growling rumble continuing through every
syllable.
"It is good that you know my name," Drizzt answered, and he began to
stalk to the side, Obould turning to keep him squarely in line. "I want you to
know. I want you to understand why you die this morning."
So sinister was Obould's chuckle that it hardly deviated from the continuing
growl. He reached his right hand up slowly and deliberately over his left

shoulder, grasped the large hilt of his greatsword, and slowly drew it up. The
top edge of his scabbard was cut halfway up its length, so as soon as the
sword tip broke free of the sheath, Obould snapped the sword straight up then
down and across before him.
Drizzt heard a shout from the other hillock, but it didn't matter. Not to him,
and not to Obould. Drizzt heard a larger commotion, and glanced to see
several orcs running his way, and several others lifting bows, but Obould
raised his hand out toward them and they skidded to a stop and lowered their
weapons. The orc king wanted the fight as much as he did.
"For Bruenor, then," Drizzt said, and he didn't piece together the
implications of the scowl that showed in Obould's bloodshot yellow eyes.
"For Shallows and all who died there."
He kept circling and Obould kept turning.
"For the Kingdom of Dark Arrows," Obould countered. "For the rise of the
orcs and the glory of Gruumsh. For our turn in the sunlight that the dwarves,
elves, and humans have too long claimed as their own!"
The words sent an instinctual shiver down Drizzt's spine, but the drow was
too wrapped up in his anger to fully appreciate the orc's sentiment.
Drizzt was trying to take a complete measure of his enemy, trying to look
over the orc's fabulous armor to find some weakness. But the drow found him-
self locked by the almost hypnotic stare of Obould, by the sheer intensity of
the great leader's gaze. So held was he, that he was hardly aware that
Obould had started to move. So frozen was Drizzt by those bloodshot eyes,
that he only moved at the very last second, throwing his hips back to avoid
being cut in half by the sidelong swipe of the monstrous sword.
Obould pressed forward, whipping a backhand slash, then pulling up short
and stabbing once, twice, thrice, at the retreating drow.
Drizzt turned and dodged, his feet quick-stepping, keeping him in balance
as he backed. He resisted the urge to intercept the stabbing and slashing
sword with one of his own blades, realizing that Obould's strokes were too
powerful to be parried with one hand. The drow was using the moments as
Obould pressed his attack to fall into his own rhythm. As he sorted out his
methods, he realized it would be better to hold complete separation. So he
kept his scimitars out to the side, his arms out wide, his agility and feet alone
keeping Obould's strikes from hitting home.
The orc king roared and pressed on even more furiously, almost recklessly.
He stabbed and stepped ahead, whipped his sword out one way then rushed
ahead in a short burst as he slashed across. But Drizzt was quicker moving
backward than Obould was in coming forward, and the orc got nowhere close
to connecting. And the seasoned drow warrior, his balance perfect as always,
let the blade go by and reversed his momentum in the blink of a bloodshot
eye.
He ran right past Obould, veering slightly as the orc tried to shoulder-block
him. A double-stab drove both his scimitars against Obould's side, and when
the armor stopped them, Drizzt went into a sudden half-turn, then back again,
slashing higher, one blade after the other, both raking across the orc king's
eye plate.
Obould came around with a howl, his greatsword cutting the air—but only
the air, for Drizzt was well out of range.
The drow's smile was short-lived, however, when he saw that his strikes,

four solid hits, had done nothing, had not even scratched the translucent eye
plate of the skull-like helm.
And Obould was on him in a flash, forcing him to dive and dodge, and even
to parry once. The sheer force of Obould's strike sent a numbing vibration
humming through the drow's arm. Another opening presented itself and Drizzt
charged in, Twinkle cutting hard at the grayish wrap Obould wore around his
throat.
And Drizzt, scoring nothing substantial at all, nearly lost some of his hair as
he dived forward, just under the tremendous cut of the heavy greatsword. It
occurred to Drizzt as he came around to face yet another brutal assault that
his openings had been purposefully offered, that Obould was baiting him in.
It made no sense to him, and as he threw his hips left and right and back,
and even launched himself into a sidelong somersault at one point, he kept
studying the brute and his armor, searching desperately for some opening.
But even Obould's legs seemed fully entombed in the magnificent armor.
Drizzt leaped up high as the greatsword cut across below him. He landed
lightly and charged forward at his foe, and Obould instinctively reacted by
throwing his sword across in front of him.
The greatsword burst into flame, but the startled Drizzt reacted perfectly,
slapping Icingdeath across it.
The magic of the scimitar overruled the fires of the greatsword, extin-
guishing them in a puff of angry gray smoke, and it was Obould, suddenly,
who was caught by surprise, just as he had started forward to overwhelm the
drow. His hesitation gave Drizzt yet another opening, and the drow took a dif-
ferent tact, diving low and wedging himself between the orc's legs, thinking to
spin and twist and send Obould tumbling away.
How might the armored turtle fight while lying on its back?
That clever thought met with the treelike solidity of King Obould's legs, for
though Drizzt hit the orc full force, Obould's foot did not slip back a single inch.
Though dazed, the drow knew he had to move at once, before Obould
could bring the sword around and skewer him where he crouched. He started
to go, and realized he was quick enough to escape that blade.
But so did Obould, and so the orc did not focus on his sword, but rather
kicked out hard. His armored foot crunched into the drow's chest and sent
Drizzt flying back ten feet to land hard on his back. Gasping for breath that
would not come, Drizzt rolled aside just as Obould's sword came down,
smashing the stone where he'd just been lying.
The drow moved with all speed, twisting and turning, putting his feet under
him, and throwing himself aside to barely avoid another great slash.
He couldn't fully avoid a second kick as the orc went completely on the
offensive. The clip, glancing at it was, sent him tumbling once more. The drow
finally straightened out enough to throw himself into a backward roll that put
him on his feet once more, squarely facing the charging orc.
Drizzt yelled and charged, but only a single step before he burst out to the
side.
He couldn't win, so he ran.
Down the side of the stony hill he went, the shouts of the orcs form the
other hill and the taunts of Obould chasing him every step. He cut a fast turn
around a jag in the stone, wanting to get out of sight of the archers, then cut
again onto a straight descending path. His heart leaped when he saw Sunrise

waiting for him, pawing the ground. As he neared, he realized that the
pegasus was no longer wearing the harness.
Sunrise started running even as Drizzt leaped astride, and only a few steps
off, the horse leaped into the air and spread his great wings, taking flight.
*

Gerti led the barrage, launching a stone that soared high into the air, not far
behind the flying horse and drow rider. Her dozen escorting giants let fly as
well, filling the air with boulders.
Not one scored a hit on the drow, though, for Gerti's instructions had been
quite clear. As the pegasus banked, the giantess managed to catch the drow's
attention, and his slight nod confirmed everything between them.
"He failed us, so why not kill him?" the giant beside Gerti asked.
"His hatred for Obould will only grow," the giantess explained. "He will try
again. His role in this drama is not yet done."
She looked back to the hillock as she spoke, to see Obould standing
imperiously, his greatsword raised in defiance, and behind him, the shamans
and other orcs howled for him, and for Gruumsh.
Gerti looked back to Drizzt and hoped her prediction would prove correct.
"Find a way to kill him, Drizzt Do'Urden," she whispered, and she rec-
ognized the desperation in her own voice and was not pleased.

PART FOUR
THE BALANCE OF POWER
There is a balance to be found in life between the self and the community,
between the present and the future. The world has seen too much of tyrants
interested in the former, selfish men and women who revel in the present at
the expense of the future. In theoretical terms, we applaud the one who
places community first, and looks to the betterment of the future.
After my experiences in the Underdark, alone and so involved in simple
survival that the future meant nothing more than the next day, I have tried to
move myself toward that latter, seemingly desirable goal. As I gained friends
and learned what friendship truly was, I came to view and appreciate the
strength of community over the needs of the self. And as I came to learn of
cultures that have progressed in strength, character, and community, I came
to try to view all of my choices as an historian might centuries from now. The
long-term goal was placed above the short-term gain, and that goal was
based always on the needs of the community over the needs of the self.
After my experiences with Innovindil, after seeing the truth of friends lost
and love never realized, I understand that I have only been half right.
"To be an elf is to find your distances of time. To be an elf is to live several
shorter life spans." I have learned this to be true, but there is something more.
To be an elf is to be alive, to experience the joy of the moment within the
context of long-term desires. There must be more than distant hopes to
sustain the joy of life.
Seize the moment and seize the day. Revel in the joy and fight all the
harder against despair.
I had something so wonderful for the last years of my life. I had with me a
woman whom I loved, and who was my best of friends. Someone who
understood my every mood, and who accepted the bad with the good.
Someone who did not judge, except in encouraging me to find my own
answers. I found a safe place for my face in her thick hair. I found a reflection
of my own soul in the light in her blue eyes. I found the last piece of this
puzzle that is Drizzt Do'Urden in the fit of our bodies.
Then I lost her, lost it all.
And only in losing Catti-brie did I come to see the foolishness of my
hesitance. I feared rejection. I feared disrupting that which we had. I feared
the reactions of Bruenor and later, when he returned from the Abyss, of
Wulfgar.
I feared and I feared and I feared, and that fear held back my actions, time
and again.
How often do we all do this? How often do we allow often irrational fears to
paralyze us in our movements. Not in battle, for me, for never have I shied
from locking swords with a foe. But in love and in friendship, where, I know,
the wounds can cut deeper than any blade.
Innovindil escaped the frost giant lair, and now I, too, am free. I will find her.
I will find her and I will hold onto this new friendship we have forged, and if it
becomes something more, I will not be paralyzed by fear.
Because when it is gone, when I lay at death's door or when she is taken
from me by circumstance or by a monster, I will have no regrets.
That is the lesson of Shallows.

When first I saw Bruenor fall, when first I learned of the loss of my friends, I
retreated into the shell of the Hunter, into the instinctual fury that denied pain.
Innovindil and Tarathiel moved me past that destructive, self-destructive state,
and now I understand that for me, the greatest tragedy of Shallows lies in the
lost years that came before the fall.
I will not make that mistake again. The community remains above the self;
the good of the future outweighs the immediate desires. But not so much,
perhaps. There is a balance to be found, I know now, for utter selflessness
can be as great a fault as utter selfishness, and a life of complete sacrifice,
without joy, is, at the end, a lonely and empty existence.
—Drizzt Do'Urden

26
INTO THE BREACH ONCE MORE
He knew that Innovindil had escaped, of course, but Drizzt could not deny
his soaring heart one clear and calm afternoon, when he first spotted the large
creature in the distance flying above the rocky plain. He put Sunrise into swift
pursuit, and the pegasus, seeming no less excited than he, flew off after the
target with all speed. Just a few seconds later, Drizzt knew that he, too, had
been spotted, for his counterparts turned his way and Sunset's wings beat the
air with no less fervor than those of Sunrise.
Soon after, both Drizzt and Innovindil confirmed that it was indeed the
other. The two winged horses swooped by each other, circled, and came
back. Neither rider controlled the mounts then, as Sunrise and Sunset flew
through an aerial ballet, a dance of joy, weaving and diving side by side,
separating with sudden swerving swoops and coming back together in a rush
that left both Drizzt and Innovindil breathless.
Finally, they put down upon the stone, and the elf and the drow leaped from
their seats and charged into each other's arms.
"I thought you lost to me!" Innovindil cried, burying her face in Drizzt's thick
white hair.
Drizzt didn't answer, other than to hug her all the tighter. He never wanted
to let go.
Innovindil put him out to arms' length, stared at him, shaking her head in
disbelief, then crushed him back in her hug.
Beside them, Sunrise and Sunset pawed the ground and tossed their
heads near to each other, then galloped off, leaping and bucking.
"And you rescued Sunrise," Innovindil breathed, again moving back from
the drow—and when she did, Drizzt saw that her cheeks were streaked with
tears.
"That's one way to explain it," he answered, deadpan.
Innovindil looked at him curiously.
"I have a tale to tell," Drizzt promised. "I have battled with King Obould."
"Then he is dead."
Drizzt's somber silence was all the answer he needed to give.
"I am surprised to find you out here," he said a moment later. "I would have
thought that you would return to the Moonwood."
"I did, only to find that most of my people have marched across the river to
the aid of Mithral Hall. The dwarves have broken out of the eastern gate, and
have joined with Citadel Felbarr. Even now, they strengthen their defenses
and have begun construction of a bridge across the River Surbrin to
reconnect Mithral Hall to the other kingdoms of the Silver Marches."
"Good news," the drow remarked.
"Obould will not be easily expelled," Innovindil reminded him, and the drow
nodded.
"You were flying south, then, to the eastern gate?" Drizzt asked.
"Not yet," Innovindil replied. "I have been scouting the lands. When I go
before the assembly at Mithral Hall, I wish to give a complete accounting of
Obould's movements here."
"And what you have seen is not promising."
"Obould will not be easily expelled," the elf said again.

"I have seen as much," said Drizzt. "Gerti Orelsdottr informed me that King
Obould has sent a large contingent of orcs northeast along the Spine of the
World to begin construction of a vast orc city that he will name Dark Arrow
Keep."
"Gerti Orelsdottr?" Innovindil's jaw drooped open with disbelief as she
spoke the name.
Drizzt grinned at her. "I told you I had a tale to tell."
The two moved to a quiet and sheltered spot and Drizzt did just that,
detailing his good fortune in escaping the underground river and the surprising
decisions of Gerti Orelsdottr.
"Guenhwyvar saved your life," Innovindil concluded, and Drizzt didn't
disagree.
"And the frost giants showed surprising foresight," he added.
"This is good news for all the land," said Innovindil. "If the frost giants are
abandoning Obould's cause, then he is far weaker."
Drizzt wasn't so certain of that estimation, given the level of construction on
defensive fortifications he had witnessed in flying over the region. And he
wasn't even certain that Gerti was truly abandoning Obould's cause.
Abandoning Obould, yes, but the greater cause?
"Surely my people, the dwarves, and the humans will fare better against
orcs alone than against orc ranks bolstered by frost giants," Innovindil said to
the drow's doubting expression.
"True enough," Drizzt had to admit. "And perhaps this is but the beginning
of the greater erosion of the invading army that we all believe will occur. Orc
tribes, too, have rarely remained loyal to a single leader. Perhaps their nature
will reveal itself in the form of battles across the mountaintops, orc fortress
against orc fortress."
"We should increase the pressure on the pig-faced creatures," Innovindil
said, a sly grin creasing her face. "Now is the time to remind them that
perhaps they were not wise in choosing to follow the ill-fated excursion of
Obould Many-Arrows."
Drizzt's lavender eyes sparkled. "There is no reason that we have to do all
of our scouting from high above. We should come down, now and again, and
test the mettle of our enemies."
"And perhaps weaken that resolve?" Innovindil asked, her grin widening.
Drizzt rubbed his fingers together. Fresh from his defeat at the hands of
Obould, he was quite anxious to get back into battle.
Before the sun set that very same day, a pair of winged horses bore their
riders above a small encampment of orc soldiers. They came down
powerfully, side by side, and both drow and moon elf rolled off the back of
their respective mounts, hit the ground running and in balance and followed
the thundering steeds right through the heart of the camp, scattering orcs as
they went.
Both Drizzt and Innovindil managed a few strikes in that initial confusion,
but neither slowed long enough to focus on any particular enemy. By the time
Sunset and Sunrise had gone out the other side of the small camp, the two
elves were joined, forearm to forearm, blades working in perfect and deadly
harmony.
They didn't kill all twenty-three orcs in that particular camp, though so
confused and terrified were the brutes at the onset of battle, more intent in

getting out of the way than in offering any defense, that the devastating pair
likely could have. The fight was as much about sending a message to their
enemies as it was to kill orcs. Through all the wild moments of fighting, Sunset
and Sunrise played their role to perfection, swooping in and kicking at orc
heads, and at one point, crashing down atop a cluster of orcs that seemed to
be forming a coherent defensive posture.
Soon enough, Drizzt and Innovindil were on their mounts again and
thundering away, not taking wing for twilight was upon them, but running off
across the stony, snowy ground.
Their message had been delivered.
*
*
*
*
*
The orc stared down the end of its bloody blade, to its latest victim
squirming on the ground. Three swipes had brought it down, had taken its
arm, and had left long, deep gashes running nearly the length of the dying
orc's torso. So much blood soaked the fallen orc's leather tunic that anyone
viewing the creature would be certain that it had been cut more than three
times.
That was the beauty of Khazid'hea, though, for the wicked sword did not
snag on leather ties or bone, or even thin metal clasps. Cutter was its nick-
name, and the name the sentient sword was using when communicating with
its current wielder. And Cutter was a name that newest wielder understood to
be quite apropos.
Several orcs had challenged the sword-wielder for the blade. All of them,
even a pair who attacked the sword-wielder together, and another orc thought
to be the best fighter in the region, lay dead.
Is there anything that we cannot accomplish? the sword asked the orc, and
the creature responded with a toothy smile. Is there any foe we cannot
defeat?
In truth, Khazid'hea thought the orc a rather pitiful specimen, and the sword
knew that almost all of the orcs it had killed in its hands might have won their
battle had the sword-wielder been holding a lesser weapon. At one point
against the most formidable of the foes, Khazid'hea, who was telepathically
directing its wielder through the combat, had considered turning the orc the
wrong way so that its opponent would win and claim the sword.
But for the moment, Khazid'hea didn't want to take those risks. It had an
orc that was capable in combat, though minimally so, but was a wielder
Khazid'hea could easily dominate. Through that orc, the sentient sword
intended to find a truly worthy companion, and until one presented itself, the
orc would suffice.
The sword imagined itself in the hands of mighty Obould Many-Arrows.
With that pleasant thought in mind, Khazid'hea contented itself with its
current wielder.
The last fight, this last dead orc, marked the end of any immediate pro-
spective challengers, for all the other orcs working at the defensive
fortification had made it quite clear that they wanted nothing to do with the
sword-wielder and his new and deadly toy. With that, Khazid'hea went back
into its sheath, its work done but its hunger far from sated.
That hunger could never be sated. That hunger had made the sword reach
out to Delly Curtie so that it could be free of Catti-brie, a once-capable wielder
who would not see battle again anytime soon, though a war waged outside

her door. That hunger had made Khazid'hea force Delly into the wild North, for
the region beyond the great river was mired in peace.
Khazid'hea hated peace.
And so the sword became quite agitated over the next few days, when no
orcs stepped forth to challenge the sword's current wielder. Khazid'hea thus
began to execute its plan, whispering in the thoughts of the orc, teasing it with
promises of supplanting Obould.
Is there anything we cannot do? the sword kept asking.
But Khazid'hea felt a wall of surprisingly stubborn resistance every time it
hinted about Obould. The orc, all the orcs, thought of their leader in terms
beyond the norm. It took some time for Khazid'hea to truly appreciate that in
compelling the orc to supplant Obould, it was asking the orc to assume the
mantle of a god. When that reality sank in, the sentient sword backed away its
demands, biding its time, hoping to learn more of the orc army's structure so
that it could choose an alternative target.
In those days of mundane labor and boring peace, Khazid'hea heard the
whisper of a name it knew well.
"They're saying that the drow elf is Drizzt Do'Urden, friend of King Brue-
nor," another orc told a group that including the sword's current wielder.
The sentient sword soaked it all in. Apparently, Drizzt and a companion
were striking at orc camps in the region, and many had died.
As soon as the sword-wielder left that discussion, Khazid'hea entered its
mind.
How great will you be if you bring Drizzt Do'Urden's head to King Obould?
the devilish sword asked, and it accompanied the question with a series of
images of glory and accolades, of a hacked drow elf lying dead at the orc
champion's feet. Of shamans dancing and throwing their praise, and orc
females swooning at the mere sight of the conquering champion.
We can kill him, the sword promised when it sensed doubt. You and I
together can defeat Drizzt Do'Urden. I know him well, and know his failings.
That night, the sword-wielder began to ask more pointed questions of the
orc who had relayed the rumors of the murderous dark elf. Where had the
attacks occurred? Were they certain that the drow had been involved?
The next day, Khazid'hea in its hand and in its thoughts, the sword-wielder
slipped away from its companions and started off across the stony ground,
seeking its victim and its glory.
But for Khazid'hea, the search was for a new and very worthy wielder.

GROUSING
The audience chamber of Mithral Hall was emptier than it had been in
many months, but there could not have been more weight in the room. Four
players sat around a circular table, equidistant to each other and all on the
diagonal of the room, so that no one would be closer to the raised dais and
the symbolic throne.
When the doors banged closed, the last of the escorts departing, King
Bruenor spent a moment scrutinizing his peers—or at least, the two he con-
sidered to be his peers, and the third, seated directly across from him, whom
he realized he had to tolerate. To his left sat the other dwarf, King Emerus
Warcrown, his face scrunched in a scowl, his beard neatly trimmed and
groomed, but showing a bit more gray, by all accounts. How could Bruenor
blame him for that, since Emerus had lost nearly as many dwarves as had
Clan Battlehammer, and in an even more sudden and devastating manner?
To Bruenor's right sat another ally, and one he respected greatly. Lady
Alustriel of Silverymoon had been a friend to Bruenor and to Mithral Hall for
many years. When the dark elves invaded the dwarves' homeland Alustriel
had stood strong beside Bruenor and his kin, and at great loss to the people
of her city. Many of Alustriel's warriors had died fighting the drow in Keeper's
Dale. Alustriel seemed as regal and beautiful as ever. She was dressed in a
long gown of rich, deep green, and a silver circlet accentuated her sculpted
features and her silvery hair. By all measures, the woman was beautiful, but
there was something more about her, a strength and gravity. How many fool-
ish men had underestimated Alustriel, Bruenor wondered, thinking her pretty
face the extent of her powers?
Across from the dwarf sat Galen Firth of Nesme. Dirty and disheveled,
carrying several recent scars and scabs, the man had just come from a battle-
field, obviously, and had repeatedly expressed his desire to get right back to
the fighting. Bruenor could respect that, certainly, but still the dwarf had a hard
time in offering too much respect to that man. Bruenor still hadn't forgotten the
treatment he and his friends had found in Nesme, nor the negative reaction of
Nesme to Settlestone, a community of Wulfgar's folk that Bruenor had
sponsored.
There was Galen, though, sitting in Mithral Hall as a representative of the
town, and brought in by Alustriel as, so she said, a peer.
"Be it known and agreed that I speak not only for Silverymoon, but for
Everlund and Sundabar, as well?" Alustriel asked.
"Aye," the other three all answered without debate, for Alustriel had
informed them from the beginning that she had been asked to serve as proxy
for the other two important cities, and none would doubt the honorable lady's
word.
"Then we are all represented," Galen Firth remarked.
"Not all," said Emerus Warcrown, his voice as deep as a boulder's rumble
within a mountain cave. "Harbromm's got no voice here."
"Two other dwarves sit at the table," Galen Firth argued. "Two humans for
four human kingdoms, but two dwarves do not suffice for only three dwarven
mines?"
Bruenor snorted. "Alustriel's getting three votes, and rightly so, since them

other two asked her to do their voting here. Why yerself's even getting a voice
is something I'm still wondering."
Galen narrowed his eyes, and Bruenor snorted again.
"Not I nor King Bruenor would deign to speak for King Harbromm of Citadel
Adbar," Emerus Warcrown added. "King Harbromm has been advised of the
situation, and will make his decisions known in time."
"Now is the time to speak!" Galen Firth replied. "Nesme remains under
assault. We have driven the trolls and bog blokes from the town and pushed
most back into the Trollmoors, but their leader, a great brute named Proffit,
has eluded us. While he lives, Nesme will not be safe."
"Well, I'll be sending ye all me warriors then, and right off," Bruenor
answered. "I'll just tell Obould to hold back his tens of thousands until we're
properly ready for greeting him."
The sarcasm made Galen Firth narrow his eyes all the more.
"We will settle nothing about our enemies if we cannot come to civil
agreement among ourselves," the ever-diplomatic Alustriel put in. "Bury old
grievances, King Bruenor and Galen Firth, I beg of you both. Our enemies
press us—press your two peoples most of all—and that must be our
paramount concern."
Emerus Warcrown leaned back in his thick wooden chair and crossed his
burly arms over his barrel-like chest.
Bruenor regarded his counterpart, and offered an appreciate wink. Emerus
was dwarf first, Bruenor understood clearly. The hierarchy of his loyalty
placed Bruenor and Harbromm, and their respective clans, at the top of
Emerus's concerns.
As it should be.
"All right then, them grievances are buried," Bruenor answered Alustriel.
"And know that I lost more than a few good Battlehammers in helping Galen
Firth there and his troubled town. And not a thing have we asked in kind."
Galen started to say something, again in that petulant and negative tone of
his, but Alustriel interrupted with a sudden and harsh, "Enough!" aimed
directly at him.
"We understand the plight of Nesme," Alustriel went on. "Are not the
Knights in Silver doing battle there even now, securing the region so that the
tradesmen can rebuild the houses and strengthen the wall? Are not my
wizards patrolling those walls, the words of the fireball ready at their lips?"
" 'Tis true, my good lady," Galen admitted, and he settled back in his chair.
"The trolls are on the run, and will be put back in the Trollmoors," Alustriel
promised all three of them. "Silverymoon and Everlund will help Nesme see to
this need."
"Good enough, and what's yer timetable?" asked Bruenor. "Will ye have
them back afore winter settles in too deep?"
The question seemed all the more urgent since the first snows had begun
to accumulate that very day outside of Mithral Hall's eastern door.
"That is our hope, so that the people of Nesme can return to their homes
before the trails grow deep with snow," Alustriel answered.
"And so that yer armies will be ready to fight beside me own when the
winter lets go of the land?" Bruenor asked.
Alustriel's face grew very tight. "If King Obould presses his attack on Mithral
Hall, he will find Clan Battlehammer bolstered by the forces of Silverymoon,

Everlund, and Sundabar, yes."
Bruenor let a long and uncomfortable moment of silence pass before press-
ing the point: "And if King Obould decides that his advance is done?"
"We have spoken of this before," Alustriel reminded him.
"Speak of it again," Bruenor demanded.
"By the time winter passes, Obould's army will be powerfully entrenched,"
said Alustriel. "That army was formidable enough when it was marching
against defended positions. Your own people know that better than any."
"Bah, but ye're giving up!" King Emerus interrupted. "Ye're all thinking to
leave the orc to his gains!"
"The cost in dislodging him will be terrible," Alustriel explained, not
disagreeing. "Perhaps too great a price."
"Bah!" Emerus growled. He slammed a fist onto the heavy wooden table—
and it was fortunate that the table was built so sturdily, else Emerus's smash
would have splintered it to kindling. "Ye're going to fight for Nesme, but Mithral
Hall's not worthy of yer sacrifice?"
"You know me better than to say that, King Emerus."
Alustriel's statement did calm the dwarf, who was far more on his edge than
normal after the catastrophe at the river. Earlier that same day, King Emerus
had presided over the consecration of the River Surbrin, saying farewell to
nearly a thousand good dwarves.
He fell back in his seat, crossed his burly arms again, and gave a great,
"Harrumph."
"King Bruenor . .. Bruenor, my friend, you must understand our thinking in
this," Alustriel said. "Our desire from Silverymoon to Everlund to Sundabar to
rid the land of Obould and his thousands is no less than your own. But I have
flown over the occupied lands. I have seen the swarms and their preparations.
To go against them would invite disaster on a scale heretofore unknown in the
Silver Marches. Mithral Hall is open once more—your path across the Surbrin
will be assured. You are now the lone outpost, the last bastion for the goodly
folk in all the lands between the Trollmoors and the Spine of the World, the
Surbrin and Fell Pass. You are not without friends or support. If Obould
comes against you again, he will find the Knights in Silver standing shoulder
to shoulder with Clan Battlehammer."
"Waist to shoulder, perhaps," Galen Firth quipped, but the scowls of the
two dwarves showed him clearly that his feeble attempt at humor was not
appreciated, and Alustriel went on without interruption.
"This piece of ground between your eastern door and the Surbrin will not
fall, if all of it is to be covered in layers of the dead from the three cities I
represent at this meeting," she said. "We are all agreed on this. Winter's Edge
will be expanded as a military encampment, and supplies and soldiers will
flow through Silverymoon to that town unabated. We will relieve King
Emerus's dwarves here, so that they can return to their work in securing the
Underdark route between Felbarr and Mithral Hall. We will offer great wagons
and drivers to King Harbromm, so that Citadel Adbar can easily enter the
conflicted region as they see fit. We will spare no expense."
"But you will spare yer warriors," Bruenor remarked.
"We will not throw thousands against defended mountains for the sake of
nearly barren ground," Alustriel bluntly answered.
Bruenor, wearing the same expression and seated in the same posture as

his dwarf counterpart, offered a grim nod in response. He wasn't thrilled with
Alustriel's decision; he wanted nothing more than to sweep ugly Obould back
to his mountain hole. But Bruenor's people had done battle with the orc king
and his legions, and so Bruenor surely understood the reasoning.
"Strengthen Winter's Edge, then," he said. "Work your soldiers in concert.
Drill them and practice them. I wish that the Moonwood had chosen to attend
this meeting. Hralien, who speaks for them, has promised his support, but
from afar. Surely they fear that Obould is as likely to turn against their forest
as against Mithral Hall, since they chose to enter the fray. I expect the same
loyalty to them, from all o' ye, as ye're offering to Mithral Hall."
"Of course," said Alustriel.
"They saved me a thousand dwarves," Emerus agreed.
Galen Firth sat quietly, but not still, Bruenor noted, the man obviously
growing agitated that the discussion had so shifted from the fate of his
beloved Nesme.
"Ye go get yer town put back together," Bruenor said to him. "Ye make it
stronger than ever before—I'll be sending caravans full o' the best weapons
me smithies can forge. Ye keep them damned trolls in their smelly moor and
off o' me back."
The man visibly relaxed, even uncrossing his arms and coming forward as
he replied, "Nesme will not forget the aid that Mithral Hall offered, though
Mithral Hall was terribly pressed at the time."
Bruenor responded with a nod, and noted out of the corner of his eye that
Alustriel was smiling with approval for his generous offering and words. The
King of Mithral Hall wasn't thrilled with the decisions made that day, but he
well understood that they all had to stand together.
For if they chose to stand alone, they would fall, one by one, to the swarms
of Obould.

"You don't know that," Catti-brie said, trying to be comforting.
"Delly is gone, Colson is gone, and Khazid'hea is gone," Wulfgar replied,
and he seemed as if he could hardly stand up while uttering those dreaded
words.
He and Catti-brie had sent the news throughout Mithral Hall that Khazid'hea
was missing, and had made it quite clear that the sword was not to be
handled casually, that it was a weapon of great and dangerous power.
It was obvious that someone had taken it, and few dwarves would be put
under the spell of any sentient weapon. That left Delly, or one of the other
human refugees who had set out across the river.
It had to be Delly, Catti-brie silently agreed. She had come to Catti-brie's
room before, the woman knew. Half-asleep, she had once or twice seen Delly
staring at her from the doorway, though out of concern or jealousy, she did
not know. Was it possible that Delly had come in to speak with her and had
been intercepted by the machinations of a bored and hungry Khazid'hea?
For where had Delly gone? How dare she leave Mithral Hall with Colson,
and without ever speaking to Wulfgar?
The mystery had Wulfgar on the very edge of outrage. The man, battered
as he had been, should have been resting, but he hadn't gone to his bed in
more than a day, ever since the troubling report of Ivan and Pikel
Bouldershoulder chasing after a lone figure running off to the north. The

dwarves were betting it to be Cottie Cooperson, who was quite out of her
mind with grief, but both Catti-brie and Wulfgar held a nagging feeling that
someone else might be out of her mind, or at least that someone might have
inadvertently let a malignant spirit into her mind.
"Or is it that we have been infiltrated by stealthy allies of Obould?" Wulfgar
asked. "Have spies come into Mithral Hall? Have they stolen your sword, and
my wife and child?"
"We will sort through all of this," Catti-brie assured him. "We will find Delly's
trail soon enough. The storms have lessened and the ferry will soon be
running again. Or Alustriel and King Emerus will aid us in our search. When
they come out from their meeting with Bruenor, bid them to find the refugees
who went across the river. There we will find answers, I'm sure."
Wulfgar's expression showed that perhaps he was afraid of finding those
answers.
But there was nothing else to be done. Dozens of dwarves were searching
the halls, for the sword, the woman, and the toddler. Cordio and some of his
fellow priests were even using divining spells to try to help the search.
So far, there were only questions.
Wulfgar slumped against the wall.

"Obould will be dead in three days," Stormsinger the giant growled. "That
was your promise, Princess Gerti, yet Obould is alive and more powerful than
ever, and our prizes—pegasus, dark elf, and that magical panther he
carries—have flown from our grasp."
"We are better off having Drizzt Do'Urden working toward the same goal as
we," Gerti argued, and she had to raise her voice to lift it above the tumult of
protest that was rising all around her. Once again the weight of events
pressed down on the giantess. It had all seemed so simple just a few tendays
past: She would lend a few giants here and a few giants there to throw
boulders from afar at settlements the orcs had surrounded, softening up the
defenses so that Obould could overrun the towns. She would gain spoils of
war for the cost of a few rocks.
So she had thought. The explosion at the ridge, where twenty of her giants
had been immolated, had irrevocably changed all of that. The assault into
Mithral Hall, where several more had fallen to tricks and traps, had irrevocably
changed all of that. The ceremony of Gruumsh, where Obould had seemingly
taken on godlike proportions, had irrevocably changed all of that.
Gerti was left just trying to bail out of it all, to let Obould and the dwarves
battle it out to the last and leave herself and her kin playing on both sides of
the equation so that, whoever proved victorious, the battle would not come to
Shining White.
The grumbling around her showed her clearly that her kin weren't holding
much faith in her or her curious choices.
If only Drizzt Do'Urden had slaughtered the wretched Obould!
"Drizzt is a formidable opponent," Gerti said, following that notion. "He will
find a way to strike hard at Obould."
"And at Shining White?"
Gerti narrowed her eyes and scowled at the petulant Stormsinger. Clearly
the large warrior was positioning himself as an alternative to her when the
great Jarl Orel finally let go of life. And just as clearly, many of the other giants

were beginning to look favorably on that positioning.
"Drizzt will not, by his word, and he will dissuade others from coming
against us, should Bruenor defeat Obould."
"It is all a waste," Stormsinger groused. "We have lost friends, all of us, and
for what gain? Have we more slaves to serve our needs? Have we more
wealth than we knew before we followed King Obould of the orcs? Have we
more territory, rich mines or wondrous cities? Have we even a single winged
horse, one handed over to us and now handed away?"
"We have ..." Gerti started to say, but a chorus of complaining rose up in
the room. "We have ..." she said more loudly, and repeated it over and over
until at last the din lessened. "We have gained position," she explained. "We
could not have avoided this war. If we had not joined with Obould initially, then
we would likely find him as an enemy soon enough, if not already. Now that
will not happen, for he is indebted to us. And now King Bruenor and all of his
allies are indebted to us, despite our waging war on them, because of Drizzt
Do'Urden. We have gained position, and in a time as conflicted and confusing
as this, that is no small thing!"
She spoke her words with conviction and with the weight of her royal
position behind her, and the room did quiet.
But they would stir again, Gerti feared, and Stormsinger, though he did not
respond at that time, would not let the matter drop there.
Far from it.

THE WAVE OF EMOTION
"Well, that's that, then," Ivan Bouldershoulder said.
He and his brother stood over the woman's body. She was lying on her
belly, but with one arm reaching up above her and shoulders turned so that
they could clearly see her face.
A couple of inches of snow had gathered around the still form. Pikel bent
over and gently brushed some from Delly's cold face, and he tried unsuccess-
fully to close her eyes.
"Poor Wulfgar," said Ivan.
"Oooo," Pikel agreed.
"But I'm not for seeing her little one anywhere near," said Ivan. "Ye think
them damned orcs might've taken the kid?"
Pikel shrugged.
Both dwarves scanned the area. It had been a small camp, obviously, for
the remnants of a campfire could be seen in the snow, and a collection of
branches that had likely served as a lean-to. Delly's body hadn't been there
long—no more than a couple of days, Pikel confirmed for his brother.
Ivan moved around the area, kicking at the snow and poking about every
rock or log for some sign of Colson. After many minutes, he finally turned
back to his brother, who was standing on the highest ground not so far away,
his back to Ivan and looking up at the sky, shielding his eyes with one hand.
"Well, that's that, then," Ivan said again. "Delly Curtie's lost to us, and the
little kid's not anywhere to be found. Let's get her wrapped up and take her
back to Mithral Hall so Wulfgar can properly say farewell."
Pikel didn't turn around, but began hopping up and down excitedly.
"Come on, then," Ivan called to him, but the green-bearded Pikel only grew
more agitated.
"Well, what're ye seein?" Ivan asked, finally catching on. He walked toward
his brother. "Sign o' where them stupid orcs might've gone? Are ye thinking
that we should go and see if the little kid's a prisoner?"
"Oo oi!" Pikel shouted, hopping anxiously then and pointing off to the north.
"What?" Ivan demanded, and he broke into a trot, coming up beside Pikel.
"Drizzit Dudden!" Pikel squealed.
"What?"
"Drizzit Dudden! Drizzit Dudden!" Pikel shouted, hopping even higher and
jabbing his stubby finger out toward the north sky. Ivan squinted, shielded his
eyes from the glare, and saw a large flying form. After a few moments, he
made it out as a flying horse.
"Pegasus," he muttered. "Might be them elfs from the Moonwood."
"Drizzit Dudden!" Pikel corrected, and Ivan looked at him curiously. He
guessed that Pikel was once again using those magical abilities that could
grant him attributes of various animals. Ivan had seen Pikel imbue himself
with the eyes of an eagle before, eyes that could pick out a field mouse
running across a meadow from hundreds of yards away.
"Ye got them bird eyes on, don't ye?" Ivan asked.
"Hee hee hee."
"And ye're telling me that's Drizzt up on that flying horse?"
"Drizzit Dudden!" Pikel confirmed.

Ivan looked back at the far distant pegasus, and shook his hairy head. He
glanced back at Delly Curtie. If they left her there, the next snow would bury
her, perhaps until the spring thaw.
"Nah, we got to find Drizzt," Ivan said after a moment of weighing the
options. "Poor Delly and poor Wulfgar, but many've been left out for the birds
since Obould come charging down. Stupid orc."
"Stupit orc," Pikel echoed.
"Drizzt?" Ivan asked.
"Drizzit Dudden," his green-bearded brother answered.
"Well, lead on, ye durned fool doo-dad! If we find them orcs and them orcs
got Wulfgar's little one, then who better'n Drizzt Do'Urden to take the kid away
from them?"
"Hee hee hee."
*
*
*
*
*
The sentient sword had worked its way through five wielders since Delly
Curtie. Using its insidious telepathic magic, Khazid'hea invaded the thoughts
of each successive owner, prying from it the identity of the nearest orc it
feared the most. After that, with a more worthy wielder identified, Khazid'hea
had little trouble in instigating a fight among the volatile creatures, and in
shaping that fight so that the more worthy warrior proved victorious.
Then news had come that the dark elf friend of Bruenor Battlehammer was
working in the area once more, slaughtering orcs, and Khazid'hea found its
most lofty goal within apparent reach. Ever since the companions had come
to possess the sword, Khazid'hea had longed to be wielded by Drizzt
Do'Urden. Catti-brie was worthy enough, but Drizzt, the sword knew, was a
warrior quite different. In Drizzt's hands, Khazid'hea would find the promise of
victory after victory, and would not be hidden away in a scabbard while the
drow warrior fired from afar with a bow.
A bow was a cowardly weapon, to Khazid'hea's thinking.
How great will your glory be, how wonderful the riches, when you bring
King Obould the head of Drizzt Do'Urden, the sword told its current wielder, a
slender and smallish orc who relied on finesse and speed instead of brute
strength, as was usually so with his brutish race.
"The drow is death," the orc said aloud, drawing curious stares from some
nearby orcs.
Not when I am in your hands, Khazid'hea promised. I know this one. I know
his movements and his technique. I know how to defeat him.
Even as the orc started away, heading northwest toward the last reported
encounter with the drow and his elf companion, Khazid'hea began to wonder
the wisdom of his course. For the ease with which the sentient sword had
convinced the orc, had convinced every orc that had picked it up, was no
small thing. Drizzt Do'Urden was not a weak-willed orc, Khazid'hea knew. The
drow would battle against Khazid'hea's intrusions.
Unless those intrusions only reinforced that which Drizzt already had in
mind, and from everything Khazid'hea had learned, the drow was on a killing
rampage.
It seemed a perfect fit.
*
*
*
*
*
Drizzt rolled off the back of Sunrise as the pegasus set down in a fast trot.
Landing nimbly, Drizzt ran along right behind the mount as Sunrise charged

through the orc encampment, bowling monsters aside.
In the center of the camp, Drizzt broke out from behind, rushing ahead
suddenly to cut down one orc still staggering out of the pegasus's path. Two
short strokes sent that orc flying to the ground, and the efficiency of the kill
allowed Drizzt to reposition his feet immediately, spinning to meet the charge
of a second creature. A right-handed, backhanded downward parry lopped the
tip off that second orc's thrusting spear, and while he made the block, Drizzt
brought his left arm across his chest. The orc overbalanced when it felt only
minimal resistance to its thrust, and Drizzt slashed right to left with that
cocked blade, tearing out the creature's throat.
A thud behind the drow had him leaping about, but the threat from there
was already ended, the creeping orc cut down by a well-placed elven arrow.
With a quick salute to Innovindil and Sunset soaring over the camp, Drizzt
moved on in search of his next kill.
He spotted a form in the lower boughs of a thick pine and rushed to the
trunk. Without slowing, he leaped against it, planting his foot, then pushed off
to the side, climbing higher in the air and landing atop one of the lower
branches. Three quick springs brought him near to the cowering orc, and a
few quick slashes had the humanoid tumbling to the ground.
Drizzt sprang down to the lowest branch again and did a quick survey. He
picked a lone orc at the far end of the camp, then a trio closer and to his left.
With a grin, he started for the trio, but stopped almost immediately, his gaze
suddenly drawn back to the lone figure approaching from across the way.
His heart went into his throat; he wanted to scream out in denial and rage.
He knew the sword that orc carried.
Drizzt came out of the tree in a wild rush. He held all respect for the
devastating weapon set in the orc's grasp, but it didn't matter. He didn't slow
and didn't try to measure his opponent. He just rushed in, his scimitars work-
ing in a blur of motion, spinning circles over his shoulder, slashing across and
stabbing ahead. He cut, he leaped, and he thrust, over and over. Sometimes
he heard the ring of metal as he struck the fine blade of Khazid'hea, other
times the rush of air cracking over his blades, and other times the softer
sound of a blade striking leather or flesh.
He went into a spin around the orc, blades flying wide and level, turning
their angle constantly to avoid any feeble parries, though the orc was already
past any semblance of defense. The drow stopped in mid-turn and rushed
back the other way, right near the orc, blades stabbing, smashing, and
slashing. Technique no longer mattered. All that mattered was striking at the
orc. All that mattered was cutting that creature who was holding Catti-brie's
sword.
Blood flew everywhere, but Drizzt didn't even notice. The orc dropped the
blade from its torn arm, but Drizzt didn't even notice. The light went out of the
creature's eyes, the strength left it legs, and the only thing holding it upright
was the constant barrage of Drizzt's hits.
But Drizzt didn't notice.
The orc finally fell to the dirt and the drow moved over it, smashing away
with his deadly blades.
Sunset set down behind him, Innovindil leaping from her seat to rush to his
side.
Drizzt didn't even notice.

He slashed and chopped. He hit the orc a dozen times, a score of times, a
hundred times, until his sleeves were heavy with orc blood.
"Drizzt!" he finally heard, and from the tone, it registered to him that
Innovindil must have been calling him for some time.
He fell to his knees and dropped his bloody blades to the dirt, then grabbed
up Khazid'hea, holding it across his open, bloody palms.
"Drizzt?" Innovindil said again, and she crouched beside him.
The drow began to sob.
"What is it?" Innovindil asked, and she gathered him close.
Drizzt stared at Khazid'hea, tears running from his lavender eyes.
*
*
*
*
*
"There are other possible explanations," Innovindil said to Drizzt a short
while later. They made camp down near the Surbrin, off to the side of a quiet
pool that hadn't quite iced over yet so that Drizzt could clean the blood from
his hands, his face, his whole body.
Drizzt looked back at her, and at Khazid'hea, lying on a stone on the
ground before the elf. Innovindil, too, stared at the sword.
"It was not unexpected," Drizzt said.
"But that didn't lessen the shock."
The drow stared at her for a moment, then looked down. "No," he admitted.
"The orc was paid back in full," Innovindil reminded him. "Catti-brie has
been avenged."
"It seems a small comfort."
The elf's smile comforted him somewhat. She started to rise, but stopped
and glanced to the side, her expression drawing Drizzt's eyes that way as
well, to a small bird sitting on a stone, chattering at them. As they watched,
the bird hopped from its perch and fluttered away.
"Curious," said the elf.
"What is it?"
Innovindil looked at him, but did not reply. Her expression remained
somewhat confused, though.
Drizzt looked back to the stone, then scanned the sky for any sign of the
bird, which was long gone. With a shrug, he went back to his cleaning.
The mystery didn't take long to unfold, for within an hour, as Drizzt and
Innovindil brushed Sunrise and Sunset, they heard a curious voice.
"Drizzit Dudden, hee hee hee."
The two turned to see Ivan and Pikel Bouldershoulder coming into view,
and they both knew at once that the bird had been one of Pikel's spies.
"Well, ain't yerself the fine sight for a tired dwarf's eyes," Ivan greeted,
smiling wide as he moved into the camp.
"Well met, yourself," Drizzt replied, stepping forward to clasp the dwarf's
offered hand. "And curiously met!"
"Are you not far from the dwarven lines?" Innovindil asked, coming over to
similarly greet the brothers. "Or are you, like we two, trapped outside of
Mithral Hall?"
"Bah, just come from there," said Ivan. "Ain't no one trapped here—Bruenor
busted out to the east and we're holding the ground to the Surbrin."
"Bruenor?" Innovindil asked before Drizzt could.
"Red-bearded dwarf, grumbles a lot?" said Ivan.
"Bruenor fell at Shallows," Drizzt said. "I saw it myself."

"Yeah, he fell, but he bounced," said Ivan. "Priests prayed over him for
days and days, but it was Regis that finally woke him up."
"Regis?" Drizzt gasped, and he found it hard to breathe.
"Little one?" Ivan said. "Some call him Rumblebelly."
"Hee hee hee," said Pikel.
"What're ye gone daft, Drizzt?" asked Ivan. "I'm thinking ye're knowing
Bruenor and Regis."
Drizzt looked at Innovindil. "This cannot be."
The elf wore a wide smile.
"Ye thought 'em dead, didn't ye?" Ivan asked. "Bah, but where's yer faith
then? Nothing dead about them two, I tell ye! Just left them a few days ago."
Ivan's face grew suddenly more somber. "But I got some bad news for ye, elf."
He looked to the sword and Drizzt's heart sank once more.
"Wulfgar's girl, she took that blade and come out on her own," Ivan
explained. "Me and me brother—"
"Me brudder!" Pike! proudly interrupted.
"Me and me brother come out after her, but we found her too late."
"Catti-brie—" Drizzt gasped.
"Nah, not her. Wulfgar's girl. Delly. We found her dead a couple o' days
back. Then we spotted yerself flying about on that durned winged horse and
so we came to find ye. Bruenor and Regis, Catti-brie and Wulfgar been wor-
rying about ye terribly, ye got to know."
Drizzt stood there transfixed as the weight of the words washed over him.
"Wulfgar and Catti-brie, too?" he asked in a whisper.
Innovindil rushed up beside him and hugged him, and he truly needed the
support.
"Ye been out here thinking yer friends all dead?" Ivan asked.
"Shallows was overrun," Drizzt said.
"Well, course it was, but me brother—"
"Me brudder!" Pikel cried on cue.
Ivan snickered. "Me brother there built us a statue to fool them orcs, and
with Thibbledorf Pwent beside us, we give them the what's-for! We got 'em all
out o' Shallows and run back to Mithral Hall. Been killing orcs ever since.
Hunnerds o' the dogs."
"We saw the battlefield north of Keeper's Dale," Innovindil remarked. "And
the blasted ridgeline."
"Boom!" cried Pikel.
Drizzt stood there shaking his head, overwhelmed by it all. Could it be true?
Could his friends be alive? Bruenor, Wulfgar, and Regis? And Catti-brie?
Could it be true? He looked to his partner, to find Innovindil smiling warmly
back at him.
"I know not what to say," he admitted.
"Just be happy," she said. "For I am happy for you."
Drizzt crushed her in a hug.
"And they'll be happy to see ye, don't ye doubt," Ivan said to Drizzt. "But
there's a few tears to be shed for poor Delly. I don't know what possessed the
girl to run off like that."
The words hit Drizzt hard, and he jumped back from Innovindil and turned
an angry glower over the sentient sword.
"I do," he said and he cursed Khazid'hea under his breath.

"The sword can dominate its wielder?" Innovindil asked.
Drizzt walked over and grabbed the blade, lifting it before his eyes. He sent
his questions telepathically to Khazid'hea, feeling the life there and
demanding answers.
But then something else occurred to him.
"Get yer flying horses tacked up then," said Ivan. "The sooner we get ye
back to Mithral Hall, the better for everyone. Yer friends are missing ye sorely,
Drizzt Do'Urden, and I'm thinking that ye're missing them just as much."
The drow wasn't about to argue that, but as he stood there holding the
magnificent sword, the sword that cut through just about anything, his
thoughts began cascading down a different avenue.
"I can defeat him," he said.
"What's that?" asked Ivan.
"What do you mean?" Innovindil asked.
Drizzt turned to them and said, "I outfought Obould."
"Ye fought him?" an incredulous Ivan spouted.
"I fought him, not so long ago, on a hillock not so far from here," Drizzt
explained. "I fought him and I scored hit after hit, but my blades could not
penetrate his armor." He brought Khazid'hea up and sent it slashing across in
a powerful stroke. "Do you know the well-earned nickname of this blade?" he
asked.
"Cutter," he answered when the other three just stared at him. "With this
sword, I can defeat Obould."
"It is a fight for another day," Innovindil said to him. "After you are reunited
with those who love you and fear you are lost to them."
Drizzt shook his head. "Obould is moving now, hilltop to hilltop. He is
confident and so his entourage is small. I can get to him, and with this blade, I
can defeat him."
"Your friends deserve to see you, and your friendship demands you attend
to that," said Innovindil.
"My service to Bruenor is a service to all the land," Drizzt replied. "The folk
of the North deserve to be free of the hold of Obould. I am given that chance
now. To avenge Shallows and all the other towns, to avenge the dwarves who
fell before the invaders. To avenge Tarathiel—we'll not get this chance again,
perhaps."
The mention of Tarathiel seemed to take all the argument out of the elf.
"Ye're going after him now?" Ivan asked.
"I cannot think of a better time."
Ivan considered things for a bit, then began to nod.
"Hee hee hee," Pikel agreed.
"Ye hit the dog for meself, too," Ivan remarked, and his smile erupted with
sudden inspiration. He pulled out his hand crossbow, of near-perfect drow
design, and tossed it to Drizzt, then pulled the bandolier of explosive darts
from over his shoulder and handed them to the drow.
"Pop a couple o' these into the beast and watch him hop!" Ivan declared.
"Hee hee hee."
"Me and me brother ..." Ivan started to say, then he paused and looked at
Pikel, expecting an interruption. Pikel stared back at him in confusion.
Ivan sighed. "Me and me brother—" he started again.
"Me brudder!"

"Yeah, us two'll get back to Mithral Hall and tell yer friends that ye're out
here," Ivan offered. "We'll be expecting ye soon enough."
Drizzt turned to his elf friend. "Go with them," he bade her. "Watch over
them from above and make sure they arrive safely."
"I am to allow you to go off alone after King Obould?"
Drizzt held up the vicious sword, and the bandolier and crossbow.
"I can defeat him," he promised.
"If you can even get him alone," Innovindil argued. "I can aid in that."
Drizzt shook his head. "I will find him and watch him from afar," he
promised. "I will find an opportunity and I will seize it. Obould will fall to this
sword in my hand."
"Bah, it's not a job for yerself alone," Ivan argued.
"With Sunrise, I can move swiftly. He'll not catch me unless I choose to be
caught. In that event, King Obould will die."
The drow's tone was perfectly even and balanced.
"I will not stay at Mithral Hall," said Innovindil. "I will see the dwarves there,
and I will come right back out for you."
"And I will be waiting," Drizzt promised. "Obould's head in hand."
It seemed as if there was nothing more to say, but of course Pikel added,
"Hee hee hee."

29
A DEEP BREATH
"I will grow weary of this travel soon enough," Tos'un Armgo said to his
drow companion.
They had been on the move for days and days, finally catching up to
Obould many miles north of where they had expected to find him, the western
door of Mithral Hall. There too, the fight had not gone well, apparently, and the
orc king seemed in little mood for any discussion of it. It was fast becoming
apparent that the travels had just begun for the two drow if they meant to
remain with Obould. The orc king would not set stakes anywhere, it seemed,
even in the increasingly inclement weather.
One bright morning, Tos'un and Kaer'lic awaited his arrival on some flat
stones outside of the foundation of a small keep atop a steep-sided hill, their
first real chance to speak with Obould since their return. Obould would
entertain guests only at the pleasure of Obould. All around the two drow, orcs
were hard at work clear-cutting the few trees that grew among the gray stone
and dirt of the hillsides, and clearing any boulder tumbles that could offer
cover to an approaching enemy.
"He is building his kingdom," Kaer'lic remarked. "He has been hinting at this
for so long now, and none of us bothered to listen."
"A few castles hardly make a kingdom," said Tos'un. "Particularly when we
are speaking of orcs, who will soon turn their garrisons upon one another."
"You would enjoy that, no doubt," a gruff voice responded.
The two dark elves turned to see the approach of Obould, and that
annoying shaman Tsinka. Kaer'lic noted that the female did not seem at all
pleased.
"A prediction based upon past behavior," Tos'un said, and he offered a
bow. "No insult meant to you, of course."
Obould scowled at him. "Behavior before the coming of Obould-who-is-
Gruumsh," he replied. "You continue to lack the vision of my kingdom, drow,
to your own detriment."
Kaer'lic found herself taking a slight step back from the imposing and
unpredictable orc.
"I had figured that you two had followed your two kin to the side of your
Spider Queen," the orc said, and it took a moment for the words to register.
"Donnia and Ad'non?" Kaer'lic asked.
"Slain by yet another drow elf," Obould replied, and if he was bothered in
the least by that news, he did not show it.
Kaer'lic looked at Tos'un, and the two just accepted the loss with a shrug.
"I believe that one of the shamans collected Ad'non's head as a trophy,"
Obould said callously. "I can retrieve it for you, if you would like."
The insincerity of his offer stung Kaer'lic more than she would have
expected, but she did well to keep her anger out of her face as she regarded
the orc king.
"You kept your army together through a defeat at Mithral Hall," she said,
thinking it better to let the other line of conversation fall away. "That is a good
sign."
"Defeat?" Tsinka Shinriil shrieked. "What do you know of it?"
"I know that you are not inside Mithral Hall."

"The price was not worth the gain," Obould explained. "We fought them to a
standstill in the outer halls. We could have pressed in, but it became apparent
to us that our allies had not arrived." He narrowed his eyes, glared at Kaer'lic,
and added, "As we had planned."
"The unpredictability and unreliability of trolls. . . ." the drow priestess said
with a shrug.
Obould continued to glower, and Kaer'lic knew that he at least suspected
that she and Tos'un had played a role in keeping Proffit's trolls from joining in
the fight.
"We warned Proffit that his delays could pose problems in the north,"
Tos'un added. "But he and his wretched trolls smelled human blood, the blood
of Nesmians, their hated enemies for so many years. He would not be
persuaded to march north to Mithral Hall."
Obould hardly looked convinced.
"And Silverymoon marched upon them," Kaer'lic said, needing to divert
attention. "You can expect nothing more from Proffit and his band. Those few
who survive."
A low growl issued from between Obould's fangs.
"You knew that Lady Alustriel would come forth," Kaer'lic said. "Take heart
that many of her prized warriors now lay dead on those southern bogs. She
will not gladly turn her eyes to the north."
"Let her come," Obould growled. "We are preparing, on every mountain
and in every pass. Let Silverymoon march forth to the Kingdom of Dark
Arrows. Here, they will find only death."
"The Kingdom of Dark Arrows?" Tos'un silently mouthed.
Kaer'lic continued to scrutinize not only Obould, but Tsinka, and she noted
that the shaman grimaced at the mention of the supposed kingdom.
A divisive opening, perhaps?
"Proffit is defeated, then," the orc king said. "Is he dead?"
"We know not," Kaer'lic admitted. "In the confusion of the battle, we
departed, for it was obvious that the trolls would be forced back into the
Trollmoors, and there, I did not wish to go."
"Wish to go?" Obould said. "Did I not instruct you to remain with Proffit?"
"There, I would not go," said Kaer'lic. "Not with Proffit, and not for Obould."
Her brazen attitude brought another fierce scowl, but the orc king made no
movement toward her.
"You have accomplished much, King Obould," Kaer'lic offered. "More than I
believed possible in so short a time. In honor of your great victories, I have
brought you a gift." She nodded to Tos'un as she ended, and the male drow
leaped away, skipping down the hillside to the one remaining boulder tumble.
He disappeared from sight, then came back out a moment later, pulling along
a battered dwarf.
"Our gift to you," said Kaer'lic.
Obould tried to look surprised, but Kaer'lic saw through the facade. He had
spies and lookouts everywhere, and had known of the dwarf before he had
ever come out to meet the dark elves.
"Flay his skin and eat him," Tsinka said, her eyes suddenly wild and
hungry. "I will prepare the spit!"
"You will shut your mouth," Obould corrected. "He is of Clan Battle-
hammer?"

"He is," the drow priestess answered.
Obould nodded his approval, then turned to Tsinka and said, "Secure him
in the supply wagon. We will keep him close. And do not injure him, on pain of
death!"
That elicited a most profound scowl from the shaman, a look Kaer'lic did
not miss.
"He will prove valuable to us, perhaps," said Obould. "I expect to be in
parlay with the dwarves before the turn of spring."
"Parlay?" Tsinka echoed, her voice rising to a shriek once more.
Obould turned his scowl upon her and she shrank back.
"Take him now and secure him," the orc king said to her, his voice even
and threatening.
Tsinka rushed past him to the dwarf, then roughly tugged poor Fender
along.
"And injure him not at all!" Obould commanded.
"I had expected you to press into Mithral Hall," Kaer'lic said to the orc king
when Tsinka was gone. "In truth, when we returned to Keeper's Dale, we
expected to find the orc army scattering back for the Spine of the World."
"Your confidence is inspiring."
"That confidence grows, King Obould," Kaer'lic assured him. "You have
shown great restraint and wisdom, I believe."
Obould dismissed the compliment with a snort. "Is there anything else you
wish?" he asked. "I have much to do this day."
"Before you move along to the next construction?"
"That is the plan, yes," said Obould.
Kaer'lic bowed low. "Farewell, King of Dark Arrows."
Obould paused just a moment to consider the title, then turned on his heel
and marched away.
"One surprise after another," Tos'un remarked when he was gone.
"I am not so surprised anymore," said Kaer'lic. "It was our mistake in
underestimating Obould. It will not happen again."
"Let us just go back into the tunnels of the upper Underdark, or find another
region in need of our playful cunning."
Kaer'lic's expression did not shift in the least. Eyes narrowed, as if throwing
darts at the departing Obould, the priestess mulled over all the information.
She thought of her lost companions, then simply let go of them, as was the
drow way. She considered Obould's attitude, however, so disrespectful toward
the dead drow and toward the Spider Queen. It was not so easy to let go of
some things.
"I would speak with Tsinka before we leave," Kaer'lic remarked.
"Tsinka?" came Tos'un's skeptical response. "She is a fool even by orc
standards."
"That is how I like my orcs," Kaer'lic answered. "Predictable and stupid."
*

*
*
Later that same day, after casting many spells of creation and imbuing a
certain item with a particular dweomer, Kaer'lic sat on a stone opposite the orc
priestess. Tsinka regarded her carefully and suspiciously, which she had
expected, of course.
"You were not pleased by King Obould's decision to abandon Mithral Hall
to the dwarves," Kaer'lic bluntly stated.

"It is not my place to question He-who-is-Gruumsh."
"Is he? Is it the will of Gruumsh to leave dwarves in peace? I am surprised
by this."
Tsinka's face twisted in silent frustration and Kaer'lic knew she had hit a
nerve here.
"It is often true that when a conqueror makes great gains, he becomes
afraid," Kaer'lic explained. "He suddenly has so much more to lose, after all."
"He-who-is-Gruumsh fears nothing!" shrieked the volatile shaman.
Kaer'lic conceded that with a nod. "But likely, King Obould will need more
than the prodding of Tsinka to fulfill the will of Gruumsh," the drow said.
The shaman eyed Kaer'lic curiously.
Smiling wickedly, Kaer'lic reached into her belt pouch and pulled forth a
small spider-shaped fastener, holding it up before the orc.
"For the straps of a warrior's armor," she explained.
Tsinka seemed both intrigued and afraid.
"Take it," Kaer'lic offered. "Fasten your cloak with it. Or just press it against
your skin. You will understand."
Tsinka took the fastener and held it close, and Kaer'lic secretly mouthed a
word to release the spells she had placed in contingency upon the fastener.
Tsinka's eyes widened as she felt an infusion of courage and power. She
closed her eyes and basked in the warmth of the item, and Kaer'lic used that
opportunity to cast another spell upon the orc, an enchantment of friendship
that put Tsinka fully at ease.
"The blessing of Lady Lolth," Kaer'lic explained. "She who would see the
dwarves routed from Mithral Hall."
Tsinka moved the fastener back out and stared at it curiously. "This will
drive He-who-is-Gruumsh back to the dwarven halls to complete the
conquest?"
"That alone? Of course not. But I have many of them. And you and I will
prod him, for we know that King Obould's greatest glories lay yet before him."
The shaman continued to stare glassy-eyed at the brooch for some time.
Then she looked at her new best friend, her smile wide.
Kaer'lic tried hard to make her smile seem reciprocal rather than superior.
The drow didn't worry about it too much, though, for Tsinka considered her
trustworthy, thought Kaer'lic to be her new best friend.
The drow priestess wondered how Obould might view that friendship.
The walls of Mithral Hall seemed to press in on him as never before. Ivan
and Pikel had returned that morning with the news of Delly and of Drizzt,
bringing a conflicted spin of emotions to the big man. Wulfgar sat in the
candlelight, his back against the stone wall, his eyes unblinking but unseeing
as his mind forced him through the memories of the previous months.
He replayed his last conversations with Delly, and saw them in the light of
the woman's desperation. How had he missed the clues, the overt cry for
help?
He couldn't help but grimace as he considered his responses to Deity's
plea that they go to Silverymoon or one of the other great cities. He had so
diminished her feelings, brushing them away with a promise of a holiday.
"You cannot blame yourself for this," Catti-brie said from across the room,
drawing Wulfgar out of his contemplation.
"She did not wish to stay here," he answered.

Catti-brie walked over and sat on the bed beside him. "Nor did she want to
run off into the wild orc lands. It was the sword, and I think myself the fool for
leaving it out in the open, where it could catch anyone walking by."
"Delly was leaving," Wulfgar insisted. "She could not tolerate the dark
tunnels of dwarves. She came here full of hope for a better life, and found ..."
His voice trailed off in a great sigh.
"So she decided to cross the river with the other folk. And she took your
child with her."
"Colson was as much Delly's as my own. Her claim was no less. She took
Colson because she thought it would be best for the girl—of that, I have no
doubt."
Catti-brie put her hand on Wulfgar's forearm. He appreciated the touch.
"And Drizzt is alive," he said, looking into her eyes and managing a smile.
"There is good news, too, this day."
Catti-brie squeezed his forearm and matched his smile.
She didn't know how to respond, Wulfgar realized. She didn't know what to
say or what to do. He had lost Delly and she had found Drizzt in a dwarf's
single sentence! Sorrow, sympathy, hope, and relief so obviously swirled
inside her as they swirled inside him, and she feared that if the balance tilted
too positively, she would be minimizing his loss and showing disrespect.
Her concern about his feelings reminded Wulfgar of how great a friend she
truly was to him. He put his other hand atop hers and squeezed back, then
smiled more sincerely and nodded.
"Drizzt will find Obould and kill him," he said, strength returning to his voice.
"Then he will return to us, where he belongs."
"And we're going to find Colson," Catti-brie replied.
Wulfgar took a deep breath, needing it to settle himself before he just
melted down hopelessly.
All of Mithral Hall was searching for the toddler in the hopes that Delly had
not taken her out. Dwarves had gone down to the Surbrin, despite the
freezing rain that was falling in torrents, trying to get a message across the
way to the ferry pilots to see if any of them had noted the child.
"The weather will break soon," Catti-brie said. "Then we will go and find
your daughter."
"And Drizzt," Wulfgar replied.
Catti-brie grinned and gave a little shrug. "He'll find us long before that, if
I'm knowing Drizzt."
"With Obould's head in hand," Wulfgar added.
It was a little bit of hope, at least, on as dark a day as Wulfgar, son of
Beornegar, had ever known.

"... orc-brained, goblin-sniffing son of an ogre and a rock!" Bruenor fumed.
He stalked about his audience hall, kicking anything within reach.
"Hee hee hee," said Pikel.
Ivan shot his brother a look and motioned for him to be silent.
"Someone get me armor!" Bruenor roared. "And me axe! Got me a few
hunnerd smelly orcs to kill!"
"Hee hee hee."
Ivan cleared his throat to cover his brother's impertinence. They had just
informed King Bruenor of Drizzt's intentions, how the drow had taken the

magical sword and Ivan's hand crossbow and had gone off after Obould.
Bruenor hadn't taken the news well.
Thrilled as he was that his dear friend was alive, Bruenor couldn't stand his
current state of inaction. A storm was whipping up outside, with driving and
freezing rain, and heavy snow at the higher elevations, and there was simply
no way for Bruenor or anyone else to get out of Mithral Hall. Even if the
weather had been clear, Bruenor realized that there would be little he could
do to help Drizzt. The drow was astride a flying horse—how could he possibly
hope to catch him?
"Durned stupid elf," he muttered and he kicked the edge of his stone dais,
then grumbled some more as he limped away.
"Hee hee hee," Pikel snickered.
"You'll only break your foot, and you won't be able to even go out to the
walls," said Regis, rushing into the hall to see what was the matter. For word
was passing through the complex that Drizzt had been found alive and well,
and that King Bruenor was out of sorts.
"Ye heared?"
Regis nodded. "I knew he was alive. It will take more than orcs and frost
giants to kill Drizzt."
"He's going after Obould. All by himself," Bruenor growled.
"I would not want to be Obould, then," the halfling said with a grin.
"Bah!" snorted the dwarf. "Durned stupid elf's taking all the fun again!"
"Hee hee hee," said Pikel, and Ivan elbowed him.
Pikel turned fiercely on his brother, his eyes going wild, and he began to
waggle his fingers menacingly, all the while uttering birdlike sounds.
Ivan just shook his head.
"Boo," said Pikel, then "hee hee hee," again.
"Will ye just shut up?" Ivan said and he shook his head and turned away,
crossing his burly arms over his chest.
He found Regis staring at him and chuckling.
"What?"
King Bruenor stopped, then, and similarly regarded Ivan, and he, too,
began to chuckle.
Ivan stared at them both curiously, for unlike the pair, he couldn't see that
his brother had just turned his beard as green as Pikel's own.
"They're thinking yerself to be amusing," Ivan said to Pikel.
"Hee hee hee."

Head down, cowl pulled low, Drizzt Do'Urden did not remain under shelter
against the storm. North of Mithral Hall, it was all snow, blowing and
deepening all around him, but with Sunrise in tow, the drow made his way
across the uneven, rocky terrain, moving in the general direction of where he
had last seen Obould. As the daylight waned, the drow ranger found a shel-
tered overhang and settled in, lying right along Sunrise's back to share some
of the steed's body heat.
The storm finally broke after sunset, but the wind kicked up even more
furiously. Drizzt went out and watched the clouds whip across the sky, stars
blinking in and out with their passing. He climbed up over the jag of stone he
had used for shelter and scanned the area. Several clusters of campfires
were visible from up there, for the region was thick with the remnants of

Obould's army. He marked the direction of the largest such cluster, then went
back down and forced himself to get some much-needed rest.
He was up and out before the dawn, though, riding Sunrise, and even
putting the pegasus up into a series of short, low flights.
A smile spread on the drow's face as he neared the region of the previous
night's campfires, for the pennant of Obould soon came into view—the same
flag he had seen flying with the orc king's personal caravan. He found a good
vantage point and settled in, and soon enough, that same caravan was on the
move once more.
Drizzt studied them closely. He spotted Obould among the ranks, growling
orders.
The drow nodded and took a wide scan of the region, picking his path so
that he could shadow the caravan.
He'd bide his time and await the opportunity.
We will kill them all, the vicious Khazid'hea whispered in his mind.
Drizzt focused his will and simply shut the telepathic intrusion off, then sent
his own warning to the sword. Bother me again and I will feed you to a
dragon. You will sit in its treasure piles for a thousand years and more.
The sword went silent once again.
Drizzt knew that Khazid'hea had sought him out purposely, and knew that
the sword had desired him as its wielder for some time. He considered that
perhaps he should be more amenable to the sentient blade, should accept its
intrusions and even let it believe that it was somewhat in charge.
It didn't matter, he decided, and he kept up his wall of mental defense.
Khazid'hea could dominate most people, had even taken Catti-brie by surprise
initially and had bent her actions to its will.
But against a warrior as seasoned and disciplined as Drizzt Do'Urden, a
warrior who knew well the intrusive nature of the sentient sword, Khazid'hea's
willpower seemed no more than a minor inconvenience. Drizzt considered
that for a moment, and realized that he must take no chances. Obould would
prove enough of a foe.
"We will kill them all," Drizzt said, and he lifted the blade up before his
intense eyes.
He felt Khazid'hea's approval.

30
WHEN GODS ROAR
Kaer'lic Suun Wett nearly fell over when she saw the distinctive form of the
winged horse sweeping in from the south. Orcs readied their bows, and
Kaer'lic considered a spell, but Obould moved first and fast, and with little
ambiguity.
"Hold your shots!" he bellowed, rushing and turning about so that there
could be no mistaking him.
As he turned Kaer'lic's way, the drow priestess saw such fires raging in his
eyes that they washed away any thoughts she entertained of ignoring his
command and throwing some Lolth-granted spell at the pegasus rider.
That only infuriated her more as the winged horse closed and she recog-
nized the black-skinned rider astride the magnificent creature.
"Drizzt Do'Urden," she mouthed.
"He dares approach?" asked Tos'un, who was standing at her side.
The pegasus banked and reared up, stopping its approach and seeming to
hover in the air through a few great wing beats.
"Obould!" Drizzt cried, and as he had maneuvered himself upwind, his
words were carried to the orcs. "I would speak with you! Alone! We have an
unfinished conversation, you and I!"
"He has lost all sensibility," Kaer'lic whispered.
"Or is he in parlay with Obould?" asked Tos'un. "As an emissary of Mithral
Hall, perhaps?"
"Destroy him!" Kaer'lic called to Obould. "Send your archers and cut him
down or I will do it my—"
"You will hold your spells, or you will discuss this matter with Ad'non and
Donnia in short order," Obould replied.
"Kill the ugly beast," Tos'un whispered to her, and Kaer'lic almost launched
a magical assault upon the orc king—until good sense overruled her
instinctive hatred. She looked from Obould over to Drizzt, who was taking the
pegasus down lower onto an adjoining high point, a huge flat rock wedged
against the steep hillside, its far end propped by several tall natural stone
columns.
Kaer'lic did well to hide her grin as she looked back at the orc king, all
adorned in his fine plate mail fastened by spider-shaped buckles. Though she
hadn't planned on getting anywhere near to Drizzt Do'Urden, in effect, the
scene was playing out exactly as she had hoped. Better than she had hoped,
she thought, since she had not expected that Drizzt Do'Urden himself would
prove to be the first formidable foe King Obould faced in his "improved" armor.
If Drizzt was half as good as Kaer'lic had come to believe, then Obould was in
for a very bad surprise.
"You intend to speak with this infidel?" she asked.
"If he speaks for Mithral Hall and they have anything to say that I wish to
hear," Obould answered.
"And if not?"
"Then he has come to kill me, no doubt."
"And you will walk out to him?"
"And slaughter him." Obould's look was one of perfect confidence. He
seemed almost bored by it all, as if Drizzt was no serious issue.

"You cannot do this," Tsinka said, moving fast behind her god-figure.
"There is no reason. Let us destroy him from afar and continue on our way. Or
send an emissary—send Kaer'lic, who knows the way of the drow elves!"
The sudden widening of Kaer'lic's red eyes betrayed her terror at that
prospect, but she recovered quickly and flashed Tsinka a hateful look. When
Tsinka's responding expression became concerned, even deeply wounded,
Kaer'lic remembered the enchantment, remembered that she was "best
friends" with the pitiful shaman. She managed a smile at the fool orc, then
lifted her index finger and waggled it back and forth, bidding Tsinka not to
interfere.
Tsinka continued to look at her dear, dear dark elf friend curiously for a
moment longer, then happily smiled to indicate that she understood.
"This one is formidable, so I have heard," Kaer'lic said, but only because
she knew she would hardly dissuade Obould from his intended course.
"I have battled him before," Obould assured her with a shrug.
"Perhaps it is a trap," Tsinka said, her voice falling away to ineffectiveness
as she sheepishly looked at Kaer'lic.
Obould snickered and started to walk away, but stopped and glanced back,
his yellow teeth showing behind the mouth slit in his bone-white helmet. Two
strides put him past Kaer'lic, and he reached over and grabbed poor Fender
by the scruff of his neck, and easily hoisted the dwarf under one arm.
"Never parlay without a counteroffer prepared," he remarked, and he
stormed away.
*

Drizzt was not surprised to see Obould stalking from the far hilltop, though
the sight of the dwarf prisoner did catch him off his guard. Other than that
squirming prisoner, though, Obould was moving out alone. As he had
shadowed Obould looking for the proper terrain, Drizzt had concocted
elaborate ambushes, where he and Sunrise might swoop down from behind a
shielding high bluff in a fast and deadly attack on Obould. But Drizzt had
known those plans to be unnecessary. He had taken a good measure of the
orc king in their fight, in more ways than physical. Obould would not run from
his challenge, fairly offered.
But what of the dwarf? Drizzt had to find a way to make sure that Obould
would not kill the poor fellow. He would refuse the fight unless the orc king
guaranteed the prisoner's safety, perhaps. As he watched the approach, the
drow became more convinced that he would be able to do just that, that
Obould would not kill the dwarf. There was something about Obould, Drizzt
was just beginning to see. In a strange way, the orc reminded Drizzt of
Artemis Entreri. Single-minded and overly proud, always needing to prove
himself—but to whom? To himself, perhaps.
Drizzt had known beyond the slightest bit of doubt that Obould would come
out to meet him. He watched the orc king's long strides, noted the other orcs
and a pair of drow creeping about in a widening arc behind the solitary figure
of the great king. He had his left hand on Icingdeath, and he drew Khazid'hea
from a scabbard strapped on Sunrise's side, but put the blade low
immediately so as not to offer any overt threat.
We will cut out his heart, the sword started to promise.
You will be silent and remain out of my thoughts, Drizzt answered tele-
pathically. Distract me but once and I will throw you down the mountainside

and rain an avalanche of snow and cold stones upon you.
So forceful and dominant was the focused drow that the sentient sword
went silent.
*
*
*
*
*
"He will win, yes? With the magic you put on his armor, Obould will win,
yes?" Tsinka babbled as she moved to a closer vantage point beside the two
drow.
Kaer'lic ignored her for most of the way, which only made the foolish
shaman more insistent and demanding.
Finally the drow priestess turned on her and said, "He is Gruumsh, yes?"
Tsinka stopped short—stopped both walking and babbling.
"Drizzt is a mere drow warrior," said Kaer'lic. "Obould is Gruumsh. Do you
fear for Gruumsh?"
Tsinka blanked, her doubts spinning around to reflect a lack of faith.
"So be silent and enjoy the show," said Kaer'lic, and so overpowering was
her tone, particularly given the enchantment she still maintained regarding
Tsinka, that her effect over the babbling shaman proved no less than Drizzt's
dominance over Khazid'hea.
*

*
*
"Say what you must, and be quick," Obould said as he mounted the high
flat stone directly across from the drow. Sunrise took a few quick strides and
flew off the other way, as Drizzt had instructed.
"Say?" the drow asked.
Obould dropped poor Fender down onto the stone, the dwarf grunting as
he hit face first. "You have come with parlay from Mithral Hall?"
"I have not been to Mithral Hall."
A smile widened on Obould's face, barely visible behind that awful skull-like
helmet.
"You believe that the dwarves will parlay with you?" Drizzt asked.
"Have they a choice?"
"They will speak with their axes and their bows. They will answer with fury,
and nothing more."
"You said that you have not been to Mithral Hall."
"Need I return to a place and people I know so well to anticipate the course
of Clan Battlehammer?"
"This is beyond Clan Battlehammer," said Obould, and Drizzt could see
that his smile had disappeared. With a growl, the orc king kicked the
squirming Fender, sending the dwarf flying off the back side of the stone and
bouncing down a short descending path.
The sudden surge of anger caught the drow off guard.
"You wish for a parlay with Mithral Hall?" Drizzt stated as much as asked,
and he didn't even try to keep the surprise out of his voice.
Obould stared at him hatefully through the glassy eye-plates.
Questions came at Drizzt from every corner of his mind. If Obould desired a
parlay, could it be that the war was at its end? If Drizzt battled the orc king,
would he be showing disloyalty to Bruenor and his people, given that he might
have just witnessed a sliver of hope that the war could be ended?
"You will return to your mountain homes?" Drizzt blurted, even as the
question formulated in his thoughts.
Obould scoffed at him. "Look around you, drow," he said. "This is my home

now. My kingdom! When you fly on your pet, you see the greatness of
Obould. You see the Kingdom of Dark Arrows. Remember that name for the
last minutes of your life. You die in Dark Arrows, Drizzt Do'Urden, and will be
eaten by birds on a mountainside in the home of King Obould." He ended with
a snarl and lifted his greatsword up before him, beginning a determined
approach.
"Who is your second?" Drizzt asked, the unexpected words halting
Obould. "For when you are dead, I will need to know. Perhaps that orc will
be wiser than Obould and will see that he has no place here, among the
dwarves, the elves, and the humans. Or if not, I will kill him, too, and speak
with his second."
Drizzt saw Obould's eyes widen behind the glassy plates, and with a roar
that shook the stones, Obould leaped ahead, stabbing ferociously with his
powerful sword, the blade bursting into flame as he thrust.
Out snapped Icingdeath, in the blink of a drow eye, the enchanted weapon
slapping across the greatsword, extinguishing the fires in an angry puff of
smoke as Drizzt hopped to the side. He could have struck with Khazid'hea, for
Obould, in his supreme confidence, had abandoned all semblance of defense
in the assault. But Drizzt held the attack.
The greatsword came slashing across, predictably, forcing the drow into a
fast retreat. Had he taken that first opening and struck with his newfound
sword, Drizzt would have scored a hit, but nothing substantial.
And in that instance, Obould would have recognized his unanticipated
vulnerability.
Obould pressed the attack wildly, slashing and stabbing, rushing ahead,
and on the high ground behind and to the side of the flat stone, orcs cheered
and shouted in glee.
Drizzt measured every turn and retreat, letting the fury play out, using less
energy than his outraged opponent. He wasn't trying to tire Obould, but rather
to gain better insight into the orc's turns and movements, that he could better
anticipate.
The greatsword flamed to life again with one feinted stab that became a
sudden reversal into a downward chop, and had Drizzt not seen a similar
distraction tactic used against the elf Tarathiel, he might have found himself
caught by surprise. As it was, the descending greatsword met only the slap of
Icingdeath, extinguishing the larger weapon's fires.
Obould came on suddenly and wildly, charging straight for the drow, who
stepped left, then leaped back right, going into a roll as Obould started one
way then threw himself back the other, slashing his sword across. That sword
flamed to life again, and the rolling Drizzt felt the heat of those magical fires
as the blade cut above him.
Drizzt came up to his feet and spun, then back-stepped and slid off to the
side once more as Obould continued to press. Around and around they went,
the orcs cheering and howling with every slash of Obould's sword, though he
got nowhere close to hitting the elusive drow.
Neither did he show any signs of tiring, though.
Finally, Obould stopped his charge and stood glaring at Drizzt from behind
the flames of the upraised greatsword.
"Are you going to fight me?" he asked.
"I thought I was."

Obould growled. "Run away, if that is your course. Cross blades if you are
not afraid."
"You grow tired?"
"I grow bored!" Obould roared.
Drizzt smiled and faked a sudden rush, then stopped abruptly and caught
everyone by surprise when he simply tossed Icingdeath up into the air.
Obould's eyes followed the ascent of the sword.
Drizzt reached his free hand behind his back and brought out the loaded
hand crossbow, and as Obould snapped his gaze back upon him—yes, he
wanted the orc king to see it coming!—the drow gave a shrug and let fly.
The dart hit Obould's helmet in the left eye then collapsed in on itself and
exploded with a burst of angry flame and black smoke. Obould's head
snapped back viciously, and the orc king went flying down to the stone, flat on
his back, as surely as if a mountain had fallen atop him. He lay very still.
Gasps and silence replaced the wild cheering of all those looking on.
*
*
*
*

"Impressive," Tos'un quietly remarked.
Beside him, Kaer'lic stood with her jaw hanging open, and beside her,
Tsinka whimpered and gasped.
They watched Drizzt snap the hand crossbow back behind him, then
casually catch the falling scimitar.
Kaer'lic noticed the approach of the pegasus, and suddenly feared that
Drizzt would escape once more—and that, she could not allow.
She began casting a powerful spell, aiming for the flying horse and not the
too-lucky drow, when she was interrupted by Tsinka, who grabbed her arm,
and screamed, "He moves!"
The drow priestess looked back at Obould, who rocked up onto his shoul-
ders, arching his back and bending his legs, then snapped back the other
way, leaping up to his feet.
The orcs screamed in glee.
*
*
*
*

Drizzt hid his surprise well when Obould was suddenly standing before him
once more. He noted the tip of the dart, embedded in the glassteel plate of the
helmet, and the black scorch marks showing over the rest of that plate, and
partially over the other one as well.
He hadn't expected to kill Obould with the dart, after all, and it was a fortu-
nate thing that the orc king's fall had caught him more by surprise than his
sudden return, for Obould howled and attacked once more, slashing with
abandon.
But...
He couldn't see! Drizzt realized as he stepped aside and Obould continued
to press the attack at the empty air before him.
Kill him now! the hungry Khazid'hea implored, and the drow, in complete
agreement, didn't even scold the sentient sword.
He stepped in suddenly and drove Khazid'hea at a seam in the orc king's
fabulous armor, and the fine blade bit through and slid into Obould's side.
How the great orc howled and leaped, tearing the sword right from Drizzt's
grasp. Obould staggered back several steps, blood leaking out beside the
sticking blade.
"Treachery!" Obould yelled, and he reached up and yanked the ruined

helmet from his head, throwing it over the cliff face. "You cannot beat me
fairly, and you cannot beat me unfairly!"
To Drizzt's amazement, he came on again.
*
*
*
*
*
"Unbelievable," whispered Tos'un.
"Stubborn," Kaer'lic corrected with a snarl.
"Gruumsh!" howled the gleeful and crying Tsinka, and all the orcs cheered,
for if that sword protruding from Obould's side would prove a mortal wound, it
did not show at all in the great orc's pressing attacks.
"He doesn't even know when he's dead," Kaer'lic grumbled, and she
launched into a spell, then, a calling to magical items she had fastened by the
grace of Lady Lolth.
It was time to end the travesty.
*
*
*
*
*
Drizzt tried to battle past his incredulity and properly respond to Obould's
renewed attacks. It took him several parries and a few last-second dodges to
even realize that he should draw out Twinkle to replace his lost sword.
"And what have you gained for all of your treachery, drow?" Obould
demanded, pressing forward and slashing away.
"You are without a helmet, and that is no small thing," Drizzt shouted back.
"The turtle has come out of its shell."
"Only so that I can look down upon you in the last moments of your life,
fool!" Obould assured him. "That you might see the pleasure on my face as
your body grows cold!" He ended with a devastating charge, and turned in
anticipation even as Drizzt started to jump aside.
The move caught Drizzt off guard, for it was truly an all-or-nothing, victory-
or-defeat maneuver. If Obould guessed wrong, turning opposite Drizzt's
sudden dodge, then Drizzt would have little trouble in slamming one or both of
his scimitars down upon the back of the orc's skull.
But Obould guessed right.
On his heels, corralled and running out of retreating room, Drizzt parried
desperately. So fast was Obould's sword-work that Drizzt couldn't even think
of launching an effective counter. So furious was the orc king's attack that
Drizzt didn't even entertain any thoughts of swinging for his exposed head.
Drizzt understood the power behind Obould's swings, and he knew that he
could not fend that greatsword. Not the shirt he had taken from the dead dark
elf, not even the finest suit of Bruenor's best mithral stock would save him
from being cloven in half.
Very simply, Obould had guessed right in his turn and Drizzt understood
that he was beaten.
Both his blades slapped against the slashing greatsword, Icingdeath extin-
guishing the stubborn fires yet again. But the shock of the block sent waves of
numbness up the drow's arm, and even with a two-bladed parry, he could not
fully deflect the swing. He fell down—that, or he would have been cut in half—
and scrambled into a forward roll, but he could not get fully past Obould
without taking a hit, a kick at least. He braced himself for the blow.
But it did not fall.
Drizzt came around as he got back to his feet, to see Obould squirming and
jerking wildly.
"What?" the orc king growled, and he jolted left then right.

It took Drizzt several seconds to sort it out, to notice that the spider clasps
on Obould's armor were animating. Eight-legged creatures scrambled all over
the orc, and by Obould's roars and jerking movements, it seemed as if more
than a few were stopping to bite him.
As the orc thrashed, pieces of that fabulous armor suit went flying. One
vambrace fell to the stone, and he kicked his legs to free himself of the tangle
of flapping jambs. His great breastplate fell away, as well as one pauldron and
the backplate. The remaining pauldron flapped outward, held in place only by
the embedded sword—and how Obould howled whenever that vicious blade
moved.
Not understanding, not even caring, Drizzt leaped in for the kill.
And promptly leaped back out, as Obould found his focus and countered
with a sudden and well-timed sword thrust. Drizzt winced as he back-stepped,
blood staining his enchanted shirt on the side. He stared at his opponent
through every inch of his retreat, stunned that Obould had found the clarity to
so counter.
Separated and with a moment's respite, Obould straightened. His face
twisted into a grimace and he slapped one hand across to splatter a spider
that had found a soft spot in his toughened orc hide. He brought his hand
across, throwing the arachnid carcass to the ground, then reached over,
growled and grimacing, and pulled Khazid'hea free of his side, taking the
pauldron with it.
Wield me as your own! the sword screamed at him.
With a feral and explosive roar, Obould threw the annoying sword over the
cliff.
"Treachery again!" he roared at Drizzt. "You live up to the sinister reputa-
tion of your heritage, drow."
"That was not my doing," Drizzt yelled back. "Speak not to me of treachery,
Obould, when you encase yourself in an armor my blades cannot penetrate."
That retort seemed to quiet and calm the orc, who stood more upright and
assumed a pensive posture. He even offered a nod of concession to Drizzt on
that point, ending with a smile and an invitation: "I wear none now."
Obould held his arms out wide, and brought his greatsword flaming to life,
inviting the drow to continue.
Drizzt straightened against the sting in his side, returned the nod, and
leaped ahead.
Those watching the fight, drow and orc alike, did not cheer, hoot, or groan
over the next few moments. They stood, one and all, transfixed by the sudden
fury of the engagement, by the hum of swords, and the dives and leaps of the
principals. Blade rang against blade too many times to be heard as
distinguishable sounds. Blades missed a killing mark by so narrow a margin,
again and again, that the onlookers continually gasped.
The confusion of the battle challenged Drizzt at every level. One moment,
he felt as if he was fighting Artemis Entreri, so fluid, fast, and devious were
Obould's movements. And the next moment, he was painfully reminded by a
shocking wave of reverberating energy flowing up his arm that he might well
be battling a mighty giant.
He let go of all his thoughts then, and fell into the Hunter, allowing his rage
to rise within him, allowing for perfect focus and fury.
He knew in an instant that the creature he faced was no less intense.

Any traces of her charm spell was gone then, Kaer'lic knew, as Tsinka
Shinriil, finding herself deceived by the drow's work on Obould's armor,
leaped up beside Kaer'lic and began shrieking at her.
"You cannot defeat him! Even your treachery pales against the power of
Obould!" she screamed. "You chose to betray a god, and now you will learn
the folly of your ways!"
Truly it seemed a moment of absolute glee for the idiot Tsinka, and that,
Kaer'lic could not allow. The drow's hand shot up as she mouthed the last
words of a spell, creating a sudden disturbance in the air, a crackling jolt of
energy that sent Tsinka flying away and to the ground.
"Kill her," Kaer'lic instructed Tos'un, who moved immediately to see to the
enjoyable task.
"Wait," Kaer'lic said. "Let her live a bit longer. Let her witness the death of
her god."
"We should just be gone from this place," said Tos'un, clearly intimidated
by the spectacle of King Obould, who was matching the skilled drow cut for
cut.
Kaer'lic flashed her companion a warning look, then turned her focus back
upon that high stone. Her eyes went wild and she began to chant to Lady
Lolth, reaching within herself for every ounce of magical strength she could
muster for her powerful spell. The very air seemed to gather about her as she
moved through the incantation. Her hair bristled and waved, though there was
no wind. She grasped at the air with her outstretched hand then brought it in
close and reached with the other one. Then she repeated the movements
again and again as if she was taking all of the energy around her and bringing
it into her torso.
The ground began to tremble beneath them. Kaer'lic began a low growl that
increased in tempo and volume, slowly at first, but then more forcefully and
quickly as the drow priestess began to reach out toward Drizzt and Obould
with both hands.
Thunder rolled all around them. The orcs began to cower, shout, or run
away. And the ground began to shake, quick and darting movements at first
that grew into great rolling waves of stone. Rock split and crumbled. A crevice
appeared before Kaer'lic and charged out toward the unfazed combatants.
And the high rock split apart under the force of Kaer'lic's earthquake. And
stones tumbled down in an avalanche. And Obould fell away, roaring in
protest.
And Drizzt went right behind him.

31
TO BE AN ELF
Her nose was no more than a misshapen lump of torn flesh, with blood and
grime caked all around it and over her left eye. Kaer'lic's spell had broken
most of the bones in Tsinka's face, the shaman knew, and Tsinka was glad
indeed when she had awakened to find the two drow long gone. Everyone
was long gone, it seemed, for the orcs had run away from that terrible
earthquake.
For many minutes, Tsinka Shinriil sat and stared at the broken rock across
the way, plumes of dust still hanging in the air from the weight of the
avalanche. What had Kaer'lic done? Why had Lady Lolth gone against He-
Who-Was-Gruumsh? It made no sense to the poor, broken shaman.
Moving against hope, Tsinka pulled herself to her feet and staggered
toward the area of disaster. She followed the same path Obould had taken on
his approach to the renegade drow. She could still see some of her god's
footprints in the snow and dirt before her. Half-blinded by drying blood and
streams of tears, Tsinka stumbled along, falling more than once, crying out to
her god.
"How did you let this happen?"
She nearly tripped over a form half-buried in the snow and rubble, then
recoiled and kicked out at it when she saw it was that ugly little dwarf. He
grunted, so she kicked him again and moved along. She pulled herself up on
the remains of the flat rock that had served as the battleground. The
earthquake had split it in half, and the far half, where both Obould and Drizzt
had been standing, had fallen away.
Tsinka wiped her arm across her face and forced herself to stagger
forward. She fell to her knees and peered into the area of ruin, into the dust.
And there, only a dozen feet below her, she saw the form of a battered but
very much alive dark elf.
"You!" she howled, and she spat at him.
Drizzt looked up at her. Filthy and bruised, bloody on one side and holding
one arm in close, the drow had not escaped unharmed. But he had escaped,
landing on a small ledge, perched on the very edge of oblivion.
"Where will you run now?" Tsinka shouted at him.
She glanced all around then scrambled to the side, returning a moment
later with a rock in each hand. She pegged one down at him and missed, then
took more careful aim with the second and whipped it off his upraised,
blocking arm.
"Your flying horse is nowhere about, drow!" she shouted, and she hopped
around in search of more ammo.
Again she pelted Drizzt with rocks, and there was nothing he could do but
lift his arm to block and accept the stinging hits. He had no room to maneuver,
and try as he may, he could not find any handholds that would propel him
back up to the flat rock.
Every time she threw a stone, Tsinka scanned the skies. The pegasus
wouldn't catch her by surprise, she vowed. The drow had played a role in
destroying He-Who-Was-Gruumsh, and so the drow would have to die.
* *
*
*
*
He was out of options. There was nothing Drizzt could do against the

assault. He still had his scimitars and Ivan's crossbow, but the remaining darts
he'd left on Sunrise, who was nowhere to be seen. Sitting on the tiny ledge,
Drizzt had hoped that the pegasus would find him before the inevitable return
of his enemies.
No such luck, and so all he could do was deflect the stinging stones with
his upraised arms.
The orc shaman disappeared for a longer period of time, then, and Drizzt
desperately looked around. No pegasus came into view—and in his rational
thoughts, he knew that it would be some time before Sunrise would come
back to the unstable, devastated area.
"At least Obould is gone," he whispered, and he glanced out over the
ledge, where the shifting stones continued to rumble. "Bruenor will win the
day."
Whatever hope that notion inspired disappeared in the realization of his
mortality, as Drizzt looked back up to see the orc hoist a huge rock over her
head in both hands. He glanced to the sides quickly, looking for some place
he might leap.
But there was nothing.
The orc snarled at him and moved to throw.
And she lurched and went flying, both her and the rock tumbling out too far,
past the surprised drow and down the broken mountainside. On the rock
above, hanging over the edge, loomed a hairy and battered face.
"Well met, Drizzt Do'Urden," said Fender. "Think ye might be taking me
home?"
*
*
*
*
*
"We will go to Gerti and determine what she is about," said Kaer'lic.
"The dwarf is gone and Tsinka is likely plotting our demise," Tos'un replied.
"If the pig-faced shaman even lives," Kaer'lic retorted. "I hope she does,
that I might make her death even more unpleasant. Too much have I seen of
these wretched and foul-smelling orcs. Too many tendays have we spent in
their filthy company, listening to their foolish gibbering, and pretending that
anything they might have to say would be of the least bit of interest to us.
Gruumsh take Obould, and Lady Lolth take Drizzt, and may they both be
tortured until eternity's end!"
So caught up was she in her ranting, that Kaer'lic didn't even notice
Tos'un's eyes go so wide that they seemed as if they might just roll out of his
face. So full of spit and anger was she that it took her some time to even real-
ize that Tos'un wasn't looking at her, but rather past her.
Kaer'lic froze in place.
Tos'un squealed, turned, and ran away.
Kaer'lic realized she should just follow, without question, but before her
mind could command her feet to run, a powerful hand grabbed her by the
back of her hair and jerked her head back so violently and forcefully that she
felt as if her entire body had been suddenly compacted.
"Do you recognize the foul smell?" Obould Many-Arrows whispered into her
ear. He tugged harder with that one hand pulling her down and back, but not
letting her fall. "Does my gibbering offend you now?"
Kaer'lic could hardly move, so forceful was that grasp. She saw Obould's
greatsword sticking past her, off to the side. She felt his breath, hot against
her neck, and stinking as only an orc's breath could. She had to tug back and

stretch her jaw muscles so that they could even move against that incredible
pull, and she tried futilely to form some words, any words.
"Casting a spell, witch?" Obould asked her. "Sorry, but that I cannot allow."
His face came forward suddenly, his jaw clamping on Kaer'lic's exposed
throat. She reached up and grabbed at him and squirmed and thrashed des-
perately, with all her might.
Obould tore his face away, taking her throat with it. He yanked Kaer'lic back
and put his bloody and battered face right before her, then spat her own flesh
into her face.
"I am imbued with the blessing of Gruumsh," he said. "Did you truly believe
that you could kill me?"
Kaer'lic gasped, her arms flailing wildly and uncontrollably, blood pouring
from her torn throat, and bubbling from the air escaping her lungs.
Obould threw her to the ground and let her die slowly.
He scanned the region, and noted some movement on a distant ridge. It
wasn't Tsinka, he knew, for he had seen her broken body on the stones as he
climbed back up the mountainside.
He'd need to find a new shaman, a new consort who treated him as a god.
He'd need to move quickly to reconsolidate his power, to cut short the rumors
of his demise. The orcs would be fast to flee, he knew, and only he, imbued
with the power of Gruumsh, could stop the retreat.
"Dark Arrows," he said with determination. "My home."
*

The weather broke, leaving the air fresh and clean, and with a warm south
wind blowing. Bruenor and his friends would not stay inside, spending their
days along the northern mountain spur, staring off into the north.
Pikel Bouldershoulder's bird scouts were the first to report a pair of winged
horses, making all speed for Mithral Hall, and so it was not a surprise, but
such a tremendous relief nonetheless, when the distinctive forms finally came
into view.
Bruenor and Wulfgar moved a couple of paces out in front of the others,
Regis, the Bouldershoulders, Cordio, Stumpet, and Pwent behind them, and
Catti-brie in back, leaning heavily on a wooden cane and on the side of the
tower.
Sunset set down on the stone before the dwarf king, Innovindil lifted her leg
over before her and dropping quickly, turning as she went to support poor
Fender through the move. Without that support, the dwarf would surely have
tumbled off.
Wulfgar stepped forward and gently hoisted the dwarf from the pegasus,
then handed him to Cordio and Stumpet, who hustled him away.
"Obould is gone," Innovindil reported. "The orcs will not hold, and all the
northland will be free again."
As she finished, Sunrise landed on the stone.
"A sight for an old dwarf's sore eyes," Bruenor said.
Drizzt slipped down to the ground. He glanced at Bruenor, but his stare
remained straight ahead, cutting through the ranks, which parted as surely as
if he had shouldered his way through, leaving the line of sight open between
the drow and Catti-brie.
"Welcome home," Regis said.
"We never doubted your return," offered Wulfgar.

Drizzt nodded at each, though he never stopped staring ahead. He patted
Bruenor as he walked past. He tousled Regis's hair and he grabbed and
squeezed Wulfgar's strong forearm.
But he never stopped moving and never stopped staring.
He hit Catti-brie with a great hug, pressing up against her, kissing her and
crushing her, lifting her right from the ground.
And he kept walking, carrying her along.
"That is what it is to be an elf, Drizzt Do'Urden," Innovindil whispered as the
two moved to, and through, Mithral Hall's new eastern door.
"Well I'll be a bearded gnome," said Bruenor.
"Hee hee hee," said Pikel, and Regis giggled, embarrassed.
They all were fairly amused, it seemed, but Bruenor's mirth disappeared
when he glanced across at Wulfgar.
The big man stared at the path Drizzt and Catti-brie had taken, and there
was a wince of profound pain to be found behind his mask of stoicism.

EPILOGUE
"She will understand," Drizzt said to Catti-brie, the two of them sitting on
the edge of their bed early one morning, nearly two tendays after the drow's
return to Mithral Hall.
"She won't, because she'll not have to," Catti-brie argued. "You told her that
you would go, and so you shall. On your word."
"Innovindil will understand..." Drizzt started to argue, but his voice trailed off
under Catti-brie's wilting stare. They had been over it several times already.
"You need to close that chapter of your life," Catti-brie said to him quietly,
taking his hands in her own and lifting them up to her lips to kiss them. "Your
scimitar cut into your own heart as deeply as it cut into Ellifain. You do not
return to her for Innovindil. You owe Innovindil and her people nothing, so yes,
they will understand. It's yourself that you owe. You need to return. To put
Ellifain to rest and to put Drizzt at peace."
"How can I leave you now?"
"How can you not?" Catti-brie grinned at him. "I do not doubt that you'll
return to me, even if your companion on your journey is a beautiful elf.
"Besides," the woman went on, "I'll not be here in any case. I have
promised Wulfgar that I will journey with him to Silverymoon and beyond, if
necessary."
Drizzt nodded his agreement with that last part. According to the dwarf ferry
pilot, Delly Curtie did come near his craft before it set off for the eastern bank
with the refugees from the north, and he did recall seeing the woman hand
something, perhaps a baby, over to one of the other human women. He
couldn't be certain who—they all looked alike to him, so he declared.
Wulfgar wasn't about to wait until spring to set off in pursuit of Colson, and
Catti-brie wasn't about to let him go alone.
"You cannot go with us," Catti-brie said. "Your presence will cause too
much a stir in those gossiping towns, and will tell whoever has the child that
we're in pursuit. So you've your task to perform, and I've mine."
Drizzt didn't argue any longer.
"Regis is staying with Bruenor?" Drizzt asked.
"Someone's got to. He's all out of sorts since word that Obould, or an orc
acting in Obould's stead, continues to hold our enemies in cohesion. Bruenor
thought they would have begun their retreat by now, but all reports from the
north show them continuing their work unabated."
"The Kingdom of Dark Arrows...." Drizzt mouthed, shaking his head. "And
Alustriel and all the others will not go against it."
Catti-brie squeezed his hand tighter. "We'll find a way."
Sitting so close to her, Drizzt couldn't believe anything else, couldn't believe
that every problem could not be solved.
Drizzt found Bruenor in his audience hall a short while later, Regis sitting
beside him and the Bouldershoulder brothers, packed for the road, standing
before him.
"Well met again, ye dark one," Ivan greeted the drow. "Me and me brother
..." Ivan paused.
"Me brudder!" said Pikel.
"Yeah, we're off for home to see if Cadderly can do something about me ...
about Pikel's arm. Won't be much fighting to be found up here for a few

tendays, at least. We're thinking to come back and kill a few more orcs." Ivan
turned to Bruenor. "If ye'll have us, King Bruenor."
"Would any ruler be so foolish as to refuse the help of the Bouldershoul-
ders?" Bruenor asked graciously, though Drizzt could hear the simmering
anger behind Bruenor's every sound.
"Boom!" shouted Pikel.
"Yeah, boom," said Ivan. "Come on, ye green-bearded cousin o' Cadderly's
pet squirrel. Get me home—and no small roots, ye hear?"
"Hee hee hee."
Drizzt watched the pair depart the hall, then turned to Bruenor and asked,
"Will your kingdom ever be the same?"
"Good enough folk, them two," said Bruenor. "Green-bearded one scares
me, though."
"Boom!" said Regis.
Bruenor eyed him threateningly. "First time ye say 'hee hee hee,' I'm pulling
yer eyebrows out."
"The folk o' the towns're going to let them stay, elf," the dwarf said, turning
back to Drizzt. "Durned fools're to let the stinking orcs have what they took."
"They see no way around it, and no reason to find one."
"And that's their folly. Obould, or whatever smelly pig-face that's taking his
place, ain't to sit there and argue trade routes."
"I do not disagree."
"Can't let them stay."
"Nor can we hope to dislodge them without allies," Drizzt reminded the
dwarf.
"And so we're to find them!" Bruenor declared. "Ye heading off with Invo ...
Inno . .. that durned elf?"
"I promised to take her to Ellifain's body, that Ellifain might be properly
returned to the Moonwood."
"Good enough then."
"You know that I will return to you."
Bruenor nodded. "Gauntlgrym," he said, and both Drizzt and Regis were
caught off guard.
"Gauntlgrym," Bruenor said again. "We three. Me girl if she's ready and me
boy if he's back from finding his little girl. We're to find our answers at
Gauntlgrym."
"How do you know that?" Regis asked.
"I know that Moradin didn't let me come back to sign a treaty with any
stinking, smelly, pig-faced orc," Bruenor replied. "I know that I can't fight him
alone and that I ain't yet convinced enough to fight beside me."
"And you believe that you will find answers to your dilemma in a long-buried
dwarven kingdom?" asked Drizzt.
"I know it's as good a place to start looking as any. Banak's ready to take
control o' the hall in me absence. Already put it in place. Gauntlgrym in the
spring, elf."
Drizzt eyed him curiously, not certain whether Bruenor was on to
something, or if the dwarf was just typically responding to sitting still by finding
a way to get back on the road to adventure. As he considered that, however,
Drizzt realized that it didn't much matter which it might be. For he was no less
determined than Bruenor to find again the wind on his face.

"Gauntlgrym in the spring," he agreed.
"We'll show them orcs what's what," Bruenor promised.
Beside him, Regis just sighed.

Tos'un Armgo had not been so alone and out of sorts since he had aban-
doned the Menzoberranzan army after their retreat from Mithral Hall. His three
companions were all dead and he knew that if he stayed anywhere in the
North, Obould would send him to join them soon enough.
He had found Kaer'lic's body earlier that morning, but it was stripped of
anything that might be of use to him. Where was he to go?
He thought of the Underdark's winding ways, and realized that he couldn't
likely go back to Menzoberranzan, even if that had been his choice. But
neither could he stay on the surface among the orcs.
"Gerti," he decided after considering his course for much of that day, sitting
on the same stone where Obould and Drizzt had battled. If he could get to
Shining White, he might find allies, and perhaps a refuge.
But that was only if he could get there. He slipped down from the rock and
started moving down the trail to lower ground, sheltered from the wind and
from the eyes of any of Obould's many spies. He found a lower trail and
moved along, making his way generally north.
Do not abandon me! he heard, and he stopped.
No, he hadn't actually heard the call, Tos'un realized, but rather he had felt
it, deep in his thoughts. Curious, the drow moved around, attuning his senses
to his surroundings.
Here! Left of you. Near the stone.
Following the instructions, Tos'un soon came upon the source, and he was
grinning for the first time in many days when he lifted a fabulous sword in his
hands.
Well met, imparted Khazid'hea.
"Indeed," said Tos'un, as he felt the weapon's extraordinary balance and
noted its incredibly sharp blade.
He looked back to where he had found the sword and noted that he had
just pulled it from a seam in Obould's supposedly impenetrable armor.
"Indeed. ..." he said again, thinking that perhaps not all of his adventure
had been in vain.
Nor was Khazid'hea complaining, for it didn't take the sentient sword long
to understand that it had at last found a wielder not only worthy, but of like
mind.

On a clear and crisp winter's morning, Drizzt and Innovindil set out from
Mithral Hall, moving southwest. They planned to pass near to Nesme to see
how progress was going on fortifying the city, and cross north of the
Trollmoors to the town of Longsaddle, home of the famed wizard family the
Harpells. Long allies of King Bruenor, the Harpells would join in the fight, no
doubt, when battle finally resumed. And so desperate was Bruenor to find
allies—any allies—that he would gladly accept even the help of eccentric
wizards who blew each other up nearly as often as they dispatched their
enemies.
Drizzt and Innovindil planned to stay along a generally southwesterly route
all the way to the sea, hoping for days when they could put their winged

mounts up into the sky. Then they'd turn north, hopefully just as winter was
loosening its icy grip, and travel back to the ravine and harbor where Ellifain
had been laid to rest.
That same morning, the ferry made the difficult journey across the icy
Surbrin, bearing Wulfgar and Catti-brie, two friends determined to find
Wulfgar's lost girl.
Bruenor and Regis had seen both pairs off, then had returned to the dwarf
king's private quarters to begin drawing up plans for their springtime journey.
"Gauntlgrym, Rumblebelly," Bruenor kept reciting, and Regis came to know
that as the dwarf's litany against the awful truth of the orc invasion. The mere
thought of the Kingdom of Dark Arrows covering the land to his very doorstep
had Bruenor in a terrible tizzy.
It was his way of escaping that reality, Regis knew, his way of doing
something, anything, to try to fight back.
Regis hadn't seen Bruenor so animated and eager for the road since the
journey that had taken them out of Icewind Dale to find Mithral Hall, those
many years ago.
They'd all be there, all five—six, counting Guenhwyvar. Perhaps Ivan and
Pikel would return before the spring and adventure with them.
Bruenor was too busy with his maps and his lists of supplies to be paying
any attention, and so he missed the sound completely when Regis mumbled,
"Hee hee hee."
