This series publishes advanced monographs giving well-written presentations of the 
“state-of-the-art” in fields of mathematical research that have acquired the maturity 
needed for such a treatment. They are sufficiently self-contained to be accessible to 
more than just the intimate specialists of the subject, and sufficiently comprehensive 
to remain valuable references for many years. Besides the current state of knowledge 
in its field, an SMM volume should ideally describe its relevance to and interaction 
with neighbouring fields of mathematics, and give pointers to future directions of 
research.

Preface
This book is concerned with a certain circle of questions from classical real analysis 
and measure theory. First, we would like to stress that the choice of topics presented 
in the text is completely dictated by our research interests and preferences. Neverthe­
less, we hope that this material will be of interest to a (more or less) wide audience 
of mathematicians, especially to those working in various branches of modern math­
ematical analysis, probability theory, the theory of stochastic processes, and general 
topology. We also touch upon set-theoretical aspects of themes discussed in the book. 
Perhaps, some of these ideas will be interesting for set-theorists and will help them 
to find new applications of their methods to various problems of real analysis and 
measure theory.
It should be noted that several questions considered in this book are closely related 
to topics covered in the author’s monograph:
(*) Topics in Measure Theory and Real Analysis. Atlantis Press, Paris (2009).
In some respects, the present book may be treated as a continuation of (*), at least 
in the sense of their common ideology and methods. However, the material given 
below is substantially self-contained, so potential readers can study it independently 
of (*). We only suppose that a potential reader is somewhat familiar with the basic 
concepts of set theory, real analysis and measure theory, general topology and group 
theory. All concepts from the above-mentioned fields of mathematics that are used 
in the text can be found in standard textbooks and monographs. In this context, it 
makes sense to recall several well-known books which will probably be useful for 
potential readers of the present manuscript.

Of course, the above texts cover much more extensive material about set theory, real 
analysis and measure theory, general topology and group theory.
For the convenience of the reader, we would like to describe (briefly and schemat­
ically) the themes which are discussed in this book.
In Chapter 1 general properties of semicontinuous real-valued functions are con­
sidered which are useful for the study of various topics in mathematical analysis. 
Some typical theorems and facts concerning semicontinuous functions are presented 
(including a separation principle for such functions).
Chapter 2 is devoted to the oscillations of real-valued functions. If is a topo­
logical space and R denotes the usual real line, then, for any function f : E ^ R 
which is locally bounded on , it makes sense to introduce its oscillation function 
О f : E ^ R defined as follows:
Оf (x) = lims'ip,. .. f (y) - liminfy ...f (y) 
(x e E).
It turns out (and it is not hard to show) that Оf is always a non-negative and 
upper semicontinuous function. So the natural question arises whether every non­
negative and upper semicontinuous real-valued function on E can be treated as an 
oscillation function. The answer to this question depends on structural properties of 
the initial space E . We study the question for certain classes of topological spaces. 
In particular, it is demonstrated that the answer is positive for many standard spaces 
of mathematical analysis (e.g., for E = R).
In Chapter 3 we deal with those restrictions of a real-valued function f which have 
relatively nice properties, e.g., are continuous or measurable on a non-small subset 
of the domain of f (of course, here the notion of “smallness” may be interpreted in 
different ways). Typical results in this direction are, for example, Luzin’s theorem 
on the -property of Lebesgue measurable functions, Blumberg’s theorem on the 
existence of a continuous restriction to an everywhere dense subset of the domain, 
and the theorem on the existence of a monotone restriction to a nonempty perfect 
subset of the domain. We present some counterexamples to theorems of the above­
mentioned kind. For instance, it is shown that there exists a continuous real-valued 
function on the interval [0, 1] which does not admit a monotone restriction to a 
Lebesgue measurable subset of [0, 1] having strictly positive measure. Besides, it is 
indicated that no Suslin line satisfies the analog of Blumberg’s theorem [14]. In the 
same chapter the notion of a so-called magic set is also considered and it is proved, 
by using some additional set-theoretical assumptions, that magic sets exist. In this 
context, it should be noted that in certain models of ZFC theory such sets are absent 
(see [26]).

Preface

Chapter 4 is devoted to the behavior of certain kinds of small sets (Luzin sets, 
Sierpinski sets, universal measure zero sets, etc.) under bijective continuous map­
pings. It is demonstrated that, in general, the image ofa small set under a mapping of 
the above-mentioned type can be of a pathological nature. For example, among such 
images one may encounter a Bernstein set, which is absolutely nonmeasurable with 
respect to the class of the completions of all nonzero ^-finite diffuse Borel measures 
on uncountable Polish topological spaces. Some other pathologies related to the just 
described sets are also discussed in the same chapter.
Chapter 5 is concerned with descriptive properties of real-valued functions. The 
central question raised in this chapter can be formulated as follows: is it possible 
to obtain (at least, in certain models of ZFC theory) an absolutely nonmeasurable 
function ф : R ^ R whose descriptive structure is relatively good. For instance, one 
may require that the graph of ф must belong to the projective hierarchy of Luzin and 
Sierpinski. The answer to this question turns out to be positive. Indeed, we show that 
if the real line R admits a projective well-ordering isomorphic to the least uncountable 
ordinal ы1, then there exists an absolutely nonmeasurable function ф : R ^ R whose 
graph is a projective subset of the Euclidean plane R2. Here a central role is played by 
Luzin sets and the characterization of absolutely nonmeasurable functions in terms 
of universal measure zero sets and pre-images of points. It should be especially noted 
that an analogous result can also be obtained under Martin’s Axiom (MA), which is 
much weaker than the Continuum Hypothesis (CH).
It is well known from classical descriptive set theory that any two Borel subsets 
of a Polish topological space are Borel isomorphic if and only if they have the same 
cardinality (see, e.g., [111]). After Borel sets, the so-called analytic (or Suslin) sets 
are of great importance in the projective hierarchy of Luzin and Sierpinski, and the 
natural question arises whether a result analogous to the one formulated above holds 
true for analytic subsets of a Polish space. In Chapter 6 we present a remarkable 
theorem of A. Maitra and Cz. Ryll-Nardzewski [121] stating that in certain models 
of ZFC theory there are two uncountable analytic subsets of the real line R which 
are not Borel isomorphic. In particular, if Godel’s Constructibility Axiom (V = L) 
holds, then one can assert that there exist two proper analytic sets in R which are 
not Borel isomorphic. To establish this profound result, one needs several delicate 
auxiliary facts from descriptive set theory, concerning the structure of constituents 
of co-analytic subsets of R.
The material of Chapter 7 is focused on iterated integrals of real-valued functions 
of two real variables. After the classical example of Sierpinski (see [155, 157]), 
which was constructed with the aid of the Continuum Hypothesis, it became known 
that, for a function f : [0,1]2 ^ [0,1], both iterated integrals of f may exist, but 
their values may differ from each other. So, the equality of these iterated integrals 
needs additional regularity assumptions on f. In this connection, it makes sense 
to study the vector space F of those real-valued functions f on [0,1]2 for which 
both iterated integrals exist and coincide. Following the old and less known work of 
Pkhakadze [142], we consider some properties of this vector space. In particular, we 
show that if CH holds, then F is not an algebra, i.e., there are two functions f1 --F

Preface
and f2 eF such that f1 • f2 t F, and we also show that F is not a lattice, i.e., there 
exist two functions g1 e F and g2 e F such that max(g1, g2) t F. Several related 
results are discussed in the same chapter and in accompanying exercises.
In Chapter 8, motivated by a well-known theorem of Steinhaus [163], we consider 
several versions of the Steinhaus property for an invariant measure p, from the point 
of view of density points of ^-measurable sets (in the standard measure-theoretical 
sense). Here some statements are proved which indicate close connections between 
the concepts of ergodicity, the Steinhaus property, and 1/2-density points. The 
chapter culminates with a theorem stating the existence of an ergodic translation­
invariant measure on R which extends the Lebesgue measure on R and for which 
there is a v-measurable set X with v (X) > 0 whose difference set
X - X = {x - x ’ : x e X, x ’ e X}
is totally imperfect in R and at ^-almost all points of X the density of X is greater 
than or equal to 1/2.
Chapter 9 covers several questions closely related to the measurability problem 
of selectors associated with subgroups of the classical additive group (R, +) . Here 
two cases should be distinguished: the case of a countable subgroup of (R, +) and 
the case of an uncountable subgroup of (R, +) . Our primary focus is on the case 
of an infinite countable group G c R and, in addition, we consider the problem of 
measurability not only for G-selectors but also for partial G-selectors. It turns out 
that the situations with G-selectors and partial G-selectors are essentially different. 
In the same chapter we give a positive answer to a problem of G. Lazou concerning 
Vitali-Bernstein selectors and partial Vitali-Bernstein selectors.
In Chapter 10, we primarily investigate the class of so-called negligible subsets of 
a given ground space E equipped with a transformation group G. Briefly speaking, a 
negligible subset of E (with respect to G) is any set X c E which is of measure zero 
for some nonzero ^-finite G-invariant (G-quasi-invariant) measure on E, and also 
is of measure zero with respect to every ^-finite G-invariant (G-quasi-invariant) 
measure p on E for which X e dom(p). The main result formulated and proved in 
this chapter is the theorem stating that an arbitrary uncountable solvable group (G, •) 
admits a decomposition {X, Y, Z} into three disjoint negligible sets with respect to 
the group of all left translations of G .Asa trivial consequence of this fact, we obtain 
that, for any nonzero ^-finite G-quasi-invariant measure v on (G, •), there exist at 
least two sets from {X, Y, Z} which are nonmeasurable with respect to v. Note that, 
to obtain these results a certain geometric form of CH, stated by Sierpinski [155], 
turned out to be very helpful.
Chapter 11 is devoted to some relationships between negligible sets and absolutely 
nonmeasurable sets in uncountable commutative (more generally, in uncountable 
solvable) groups. In particular, it is demonstrated that, for any uncountable solvable 
group (G, •), there exist two G-negligible subsets A and В of G such that A U В 
is a G-absolutely nonmeasurable subset of G. This result shows, in particular, that

the union of two negligible sets can be extremely bad from the measure-theoretical 
viewpoint.
Chapter 12 is concerned with measurability properties of Mazurkiewicz sets. 
Recall that X c R2 is a Mazurkiewicz set if card(X П I) = 2 for every straight line 
I of R2. Such a paradoxical set X was first constructed by S. Mazurkiewicz [125] in 
1914, with the aid of the method of transfinite recursion. Descriptive properties of 
Mazurkiewicz type subsets of the plane may be absolutely different. For instance, 
the following facts are well-known:
(i) there exists a nowhere dense Mazurkiewicz set which is of Lebesgue measure 
zero;
(ii) there exists a Mazurkiewicz set which intersects each Borel subset of R2 with 
strictly positive Lebesgue measure;
(iii) if a Mazurkiewicz set is an analytic subset of R2 , then it is a Borel subset of R2 .
Also, as has recently been proved, in Godel’s model L of ZFC theory there exists a 
co-analytic Mazurkiewicz subset ofR2 (see [127, 128]). On the other hand, it is still 
unknown whether there exists a Mazurkiewicz set which is a Borel subset of R2 . In 
this chapter we consider the behavior of Mazurkiewicz sets with respect to the class 
M'(R2) of all nonzero ^-finite translation-invariant measures on R2. In particular, 
we show that every Mazurkiewicz set is negligible with respect to M'(R2) and that 
there are Mazurkiewicz sets which are absolutely negligible with respect to M ' (R2). 
Moreover, it is proved in the same chapter that there exist Mazurkiewicz sets which 
are not absolutely negligible with respect to M'(R2).
In Chapter 13 we use Marczewski’s method of extending nonzero ^-finite in­
variant (quasi-invariant) measures and evaluate the number of possible extensions 
of such measures in the special case when the role of a ground set is played by 
the real line R and the role of a transformation group G is played by the group of all 
translations of R. We also touch upon some nonseparable extensions of measures on 
R.
Appendix A is of a purely set-theoretical flavor. According to the classical defini­
tion of Bolzano and Dedekind, a set is infinite (more precisely, -infinite) if there 
exists a bijective mapping of onto its proper subset. In other words, is -infinite 
if and only if is equinumerous with some proper subset of . Throughout the 
book, we are dealing with uncountable ground (base) sets equipped with various 
transformation groups. Motivated by this circumstance, we discuss in this appendix 
an analogous abstract characterization of uncountable sets in terms of their self­
mappings. In particular, it is proved that a set is uncountable if and only if, for any 
mapping f : E ^ E, there exists a proper subset Z of E such that card(Z) = card(E) 
and f (Z) c Z. Several related questions concerning the fundamental mathemati­
cal concepts of finiteness (countability) and infiniteness (uncountability) are also 
touched upon.

Preface
Appendix B is devoted to Peano type functions, their existence, and their helpful 
properties. In particular, we give proofs of the following well-known facts:
(1) Alexandrov’s theorem on the existence of a continuous surjection of Cantor’s 
set = {0, 1}N onto any nonempty compact metric space;
(2) Suslin’s theorem on the existence of a proper analytic set in any uncountable 
Polish space;
(3) Luzin’s theorem on the existence of a universal analytic set in the plane R2;
(4) Lebesgue’s theorem stating the existence of real-valued functions on R of Baire 
order a, where a is an arbitrary ordinal number strictly less than ш1.
All these statements play an essential role in different sections of the book.
In Appendix C we consider some kinds of mathematical structures which are 
rigid, almost rigid, or almost rigid in the strong sense. The rigidity of a structure 5 
given on an infinite ground (base) set E means that only the identity mapping Id^ 
of E is an automorphism of (E, .S'). The almost rigidity of a structure 5 on E means 
that every automorphism f : E ^ E of 5 is such that almost all points of E remain 
fixed under f, i.e.,
card({x e E : f (x) + x}) < card(E).
Similarly to the latter definition, the notion of a rigid structure in the strong sense can 
be introduced. Following some fruitful ideas from classical descriptive set theory, we 
consider typical examples of structures which are, respectively, rigid, almost rigid, 
and almost rigid in the strong sense. Moreover, several results on the existence of 
such structures are established. To obtain these results, an important role is played 
by an appropriate analog of Lavrentiev’s celebrated theorem on extensions of Borel 
mappings (see, e.g., [111]).
Appendix D contains a short list of several unsolved problems in measure theory 
with corresponding remarks, examples, and comments. These problems are closely 
connected with topics discussed in the main text of the book.
In general, we have tried to present the material in a self-contained form com­
pletely accessible to graduate and post-graduate students. Finally, we would like 
to stress that all chapters and the three appendices end with exercises which give 
additional information concerning the topics under discussion. While some of the 
exercises are quite easy, others are closely related to profound mathematical facts and 
their solution will require intensive effort. The more difficult exercises are marked 
by asterisks and, in many cases, necessary hints are provided. Also, several unsolved 
problems are formulated in connection with topics considered in the book.
The Bibliography consists of 173 titles. Of course, it is far from being complete 
and primarily serves to stimulate the reader’s interest in various questions of real 
analysis and classical measure theory.

Chapter 1
Real-Valued Semicontinuous Functions

Let E be a topological space, xo be a point of E, and let f : E ^ R be a function.
According to the well-known definition (see, e.g., [37,51,74,111,112]), f is said 
to be lower semicontinuous at 0 if, for any real > 0, there exists a neighborhood 
U (xo) such that
(Vx e U(xo))( f (x) > f (xo) - e).
In a similar manner, one says that f is upper semicontinuous at x0 if, for any real 
e > 0, there exists a neighborhood U(xo) such that
(Vx e U(xo))(f (x) < f (xo) + e).
Remark 1.1 In the above definitions one can replace, respectively, the symbol > by 
>, and the symbol < by <. Clearly, after this replacement we get the same notions 
of the lower semicontinuity and upper semicontinuity of a function f : E ^ R 
at a point xo e E. Also, it is easy to check that the lower semicontinuity of f 
at xo can equivalently be expressed by the formula liminfv^Vof (x) = f (xo), and 
the upper semicontinuity of f at xo can equivalently be expressed by the formula 
limisup, ,s f (x) = f (xo).
Naturally, there is a close connection between the lower semicontinuous functions 
at xo and upper semicontinuous functions at xo (cf. Theorem 1.3 below).
A function f : E ^ R is called semicontinuous at xo e E if f is either lower 
semicontinuous at xo or is upper semicontinuous at xo .
Remark 1.2 It directly follows from the above definitions that, for a function 
g : E ^ R, these two statements are equivalent:
(a) 
g is continuous at a point xo e E;
(b) 
g is simultaneously lower and upper semicontinuous at xo e E.

1 Real-Valued Semicontinuous Functions
Theorem 1.3 The following four assertions hold:
(1) a function f : E ^ R is lower (upper) semicontinuous at x0 e E if and only if 
the function - f is upper (lower) semicontinuous at x0;
(2) if two functions f : E ^ R and g : E ^ R are lower (respectively, upper) 
semicontinuous at x0 e E, then the functions f + g, sup( f, g), and inf (f, g) are 
lower (respectively, upper) semicontinuous at x0;
(3) if f : E ^ R is lower (upper) semicontinuous at x0 e E and a real number t is 
non-negative, then the function tf is lower (upper) semicontinuous at x0;
(4) if f : E ^ R and g : E ^ R are both non-negative and lower (upper) 
semicontinuous at x0 e E, then f • g is also lower (upper) semicontinuous at x0.
Proof Assertion (1) immediately follows from the definitions of lower semicontin­
uous and upper semicontinuous functions at x0 e E.
To show the validity of (2), it suffices (in view of (1)) to consider the case when 
f : E ^ R and g : E ^ R are lower semicontinuous at a point x0 e E. Fix a real 
£ > 0. For £/2, there exists a neighborhood U(x0) such that (Vx e U(x0))(f (x) > 
f (x0) - £/2). Similarly, for the same £/2, there exists a neighborhood V(x0) such 
that (Vx e V(x0))(g(x) > g(x0) -£/2). Let W(x0) = U(x0) П V(x0). Then, for each 
point x e W(x0), we have
f(x) + g(x) > (f (x0) - £/2) + (g(x0) - £/2) = f (x0) + g(x0) - £, 
which establishes the lower semicontinuity of f + g at x0 .An analogous argument 
works for the functions sup( f, g) and inf (f, g).
The easy proof of assertion (3) is left to the reader.
In order to prove (4), suppose first that non-negative f and g are upper semi­
continuous at x0 and take a real £ > 0. There exist a neighborhood U(x0) and a 
neighborhood V(x0) such that
(Vx e U(x0))( f (x) < f (x0) + £), (Vx e V(x0))(g(x) < g(x0) + £).
Again defining W(x0) = U(x0) П V(x0) and keeping in mind the non-negativity of 
f and g, we may write
f (x)g(x) < (f(x0) + £)(g(x0) + £) = f (x0)g(x0) + £(f (x0) + g(x0>) + £2
for all points x e W(x0), whence it readily follows that f • g is upper semicontinuous 
at x0 .
Finally, let both non-negative functions f and g be lower semicontinuous at 
x0. If f (x0) = 0 or g(x0) = 0, then (f • g)(x0) = 0 and f • g is automatically 
lower semicontinuous at x0 (cf. Exercise 1.1). It remains to consider the case when 
f (x0) > 0 and g(x0) > 0. Let a real £ > 0 be arbitrarily small. In particular, we may 
assume that f (x0) - £ > 0 and g(x0) - £ > 0. There exist neighborhoods U(x0) and 
V(x0) such that
(Vx e U(x0))(f (x) > f (x0) - £), (Vx e V(x0))(g(x) > g(x0) - £).

Defining once again W(xo) = U (xo) П V(xo), we may write
f (x)g(x) > (f (xo) - £)(g(xo) - £) = f (xo)g(xo) - £(f (xo) + g(xo)) + £2
for all points x e W(xo), which implies the lower semicontinuity of f • g at the point 
xo.
Theorem 1.3 has thus been proved. 
□
Exercise 1.3 shows that the assumption of the non-negativity of both functions f 
and g in assertion (4) of Theorem 1.3 is essential for the validity of (4).
Remark 1.4 Let be a vector (linear) space over R and let o stand for the neutral 
element of L. Recall that a nonempty set С c L is a cone in L (whose vertex is o) if 
the following condition is fulfilled:
For any x e С and for each real number t > o, one has tx e С.
In the geometric language this means that ifx e С \ {o}, then the ray which passes 
through x and whose endpoint coincides with o is entirely contained in С.
A cone С is called convex if, for any two points x e С and e С, one has 
x+ e С.
This definition of a convex cone is compatible with the standard definition of 
convex sets in real vector spaces (a subset of L is called convex if, for any two 
points x e and e , the line segment [x, ] is entirely contained in ). Indeed, 
it can readily be verified that a cone С is convex in the usual sense if and only if 
it is convex in the sense of the above-mentioned definition. It should be noted that 
convex cones play an important role in various topics of modern functional analysis. 
In particular, these cones are useful in those questions which are concerned with 
some extension theorems in analysis.
Now, consider the real vector space R£ consisting of all functions acting from 
a topological space E into R. Actually, assertions (2) and (3) of Theorem 1.3 state 
that the functions on E which are lower (respectively, upper) semicontinuous at a 
fixed point xo e E form a convex cone С (respectively, the convex cone -С) in 
R£, and С П (-С) coincides with the vector subspace of R£ consisting of all those 
real-valued functions on E which are continuous at xo. Moreover, assertion (2) of 
the same theorem shows us that С (respectively, -С) is a lattice with respect to the 
standard operations
(f, g) ^ inf(f, g), 
(f, g) ^ sup( f, g).
One important property of this lattice - its so-called conditional completeness - 
is formulated in the following theorem.
Theorem 1.5 Let E be a topological space, xo be a point of E, and let {ft : i e I} 
be a family of real-valued functions on E such that there exists sup{ ft (x) : i e I} 
for each x e E (respectively, there exists inf {fi (x) : i e I} for each x e E).
If all functions fi (i e I) are lower (respectively, upper) semicontinuous at xo, 
then the function sup{ fi : i e I} is lower semicontinuous at xo (respectively, the 
function inf {fi : i e I} is upper semicontinuous at xo).

1 Real-Valued Semicontinuous Functions
Proof It suffices to consider the case when all ft (i e I) are lower semicontinuous 
at x0. Let f = sup{ fi : i e I} and take an arbitrary real s > 0. Since we have 
f (x0) = sup{ fi (x0) : i e I}, there is an index j e I such that f (x0) < f ,■ (x0) + s/2. 
Since the function f,• is lower semicontinuous at x0, there exists a neighborhood 
U(x0) such that
(Vx e U(xq))( f,■ (x) >ff (xq)- s/2).
Consequently, for any point x e U(x0), we have
f (x) > f i (x) > f ,■ (xq) - s/2 > f (xq) - s/2 - s/2 = f (xq) - s,
which shows us that the function f is lower semicontinuous at x0. 
□
Remark 1.6 Let (I, <) be a partially ordered set, E be a topological space, x0 
be a point in E, and let {fi : i e I} be an increasing (respectively, decreasing) 
family of real-valued functions on E such that there exists sup{ fi (x) : i e I} 
for each x e E (respectively, there exists inf{fi (x) : i e I} for each x e E). 
Then {fi : i e I} converges pointwise on E to the function f : E ^ R defined 
by the formula f (x) = sup{fi (x) : i e I} (respectively, defined by the formula 
f (x) = inf{fi (x) : i e I}).
Furthermore, if all functions fi (i e I) are lower (respectively, upper) semi­
continuous at x0, then f is lower semicontinuous at x0 (respectively, f is upper 
semicontinuous at x0). In the special case, when (I, <) = (N, <), we obtain the 
following assertion:
If {fn : n e N} is an increasing (respectively, decreasing) sequence of real-valued 
functions on E, all of which are lower (respectively, upper) semicontinuous at x0 e E, 
then the function f = limn^TC fn is lower (respectively, upper) semicontinuous at the 
same x0.
This fact is immediately implied by Theorem 1.5.
For any ground set E and for any function f : E ^ R, we introduce the notation
П f) = {(x,t)e E x R : f (x) < t},
Г,(f) = {(x,t)e E x R : f (x) > t}.
Evidently, the set Г*( f) П Г, (f) coincides with the graph of f. It is also easy to see 
that the equivalence (x, t) e Г*( f) « (x, -t) e ГД-f) holds true.
Theorem 1.7 Let E be a topological space, x0 be a point of E, and let f : E ^ R 
be a function. These two assertions hold:
(1) if f is lower semicontinuous at x0 and (xq, t0) is an adherent point of Г*( f) in 
the product space E x R, then (xq, t0) belongs to Г* (f);
(2) if f is upper semicontinuous at x0 and (x0, t0) is an adherent point of Г,( f) in 
the product space E x R, then (xq, t0) belongs to Г (f).

Proof It suffices to demonstrate the validity of (1). Suppose that the given f is lower 
semicontinuous at x0 and (x0, t0) is an adherent point of Г*( f). We must show that 
f (x0) < t0. Suppose otherwise, i.e., f (x0) > t0. Then there exists a real £ > 0 such 
that f (x0) > t0 + 2£. For the same £, there exists a neighborhood U(x0) such that
(Vx 6 U(X0))( f (x) > f (X0) - £>t0 + £).
In the topological space E x R consider the set U(x0) x ] t0 - s,t0 + £ [. Clearly, 
this set is a neighborhood of the point (x0, t0) and it can easily be verified that 
(U(x0) x ]r0 - £,t0 + £[) П Г*(f) = 0. But the last formula contradicts the 
condition that (x0,t0) is an adherent point of Г*( f). The obtained contradiction 
finishes the proof. 
□
The converse to Theorem 1.7 is also true (in this connection, see Exercise 1.9).
Suppose we are given a topological space E and a function f : E ^ R. In 
the beginning of the present chapter we introduced the lower (respectively, upper) 
semicontinuity of f at a fixed point x0 6 E.
In accordance with this local definition, it is natural to say that f is lower (upper) 
semicontinuous on E if f is lower (upper) semicontinuous at all points of E.
Remark 1.8 Observe that a function g : E ^ R is continuous on E if and only if g 
is simultaneously lower and upper semicontinuous on E.
Example 1.9 Denoting by |_xJ the greatest integer not exceeding a real number x, it 
can easily be shown that the so-called floor function
x ^ LxJ 
(x 6 R)
is upper semicontinuous on R. Consequently, the function
x ^ x - LxJ 
(x 6 R)
is lower semicontinuous on R. Evidently, both these functions are discontinuous.
Example 1.10 If E is a topological space and U is an open set in E, then the 
characteristic function of U is lower semicontinuous on E (but, in general, is not 
upper semicontinuous). Consequently, if F is a closed set in E, then the charac­
teristic function of F is upper semicontinuous on E (but, in general, is not lower 
semicontinuous).
Remark 1.11 It immediately follows from Theorem 1.7 that if a function f : E ^ R 
is lower (respectively, upper) semicontinuous on E, then the set Г*( f) (respectively, 
the set Г,( f)) is closed in the product space E x R. The converse assertion is also 
true (see Exercise 1.12).

1 Real-Valued Semicontinuous Functions
Theorem 1.12 For a function f : E ^ R, the following three assertions are equiv­
alent:
(1) f is lower semicontinuous on E;
(2) for any real t, the set {x e E : f (x) > t} is open in E;
(3) for any real t, the set {x e E : f (x) < t} is closed in E.
Proof The equivalence of (2) and (3) is trivial. Let us prove the equivalence of (1) 
and (2).
Assuming (1), take t e R and consider the set {x e E : f (x) > t}. If x0 is any 
point from this set, then f (x0) > t. Choose a real £ > 0 so small that f (x0) > t + £. 
Since f is lower semicontinuous at x0, there exists a neighborhood U(x0) such that 
f (x0) < f (x) + £ for all points x e U(x0). This implies that f (x) > t for all 
x e U(x0). Therefore,
U(x0) c {x e E : f (x) > t},
which shows us that {x e E : f (x) > t} is open in E, i.e., (2) holds true.
Conversely, suppose (2) and let x0 be any point of E. Take a real £ > 0 and put 
t = f (x0) - £. According to (2), the set {x e E : f (x) > t} is open in E. Since x0 
belongs to {x e E : f (x) > t}, there exists a neighborhood U(x0) entirely contained 
in {x e E : f (x) > t}. Clearly, we have f (x) > f (x0) - £ for all x e U(x0), so f is 
lower semicontinuous at x0, i.e., (1) holds true.
This completes the proof of Theorem 1.12. 
□
Remark 1.13 It directly follows from the above theorem that, for a function f : E ^ 
R, the following three assertions are equivalent:
(1) f is upper semicontinuous on E;
(2) for any real t, the set {x e E : f (x) < t} is open in E;
(3) for any real t, the set {x e E : f (x) > t} is closed in E.
Consequently, every upper (lower) semicontinuous real-valued function on E is a 
Borel mapping from E into R.
Theorem 1.14 Let E be an arbitrary nonempty quasi-compact topological space 
and let f : E ^ R be a lower semicontinuous function on E.
Then there exists a point z e E such that f (z) = inf {f (x) : x e E}. In other 
words, f attains its infimum on E.
Proof Let r = inf(ran( f)) = inf{f (x) : x e E}. In view of the definition of 
the infimum of a set of reals, for any nonzero natural number n, the set En = 
{x e E : f (x) < r + 1/n} is not empty. According to Theorem 1.12, the same 
set is also closed. Therefore, we have the decreasing (by inclusion) sequence 
{En : n e N \ {0}} of nonempty closed sets in the quasi-compact space E. This fact 
implies that n{E„ : n e N \ {0}} + 0. Taking any point z e n{E„ : n e N \ {0}}, 
we easily conclude that f (z) = r, which finishes the proof.

Remark 1.15 Obviously, we have a statement dual to Theorem 1.14, which is for­
mulated in terms of upper semicontinuous functions. Namely, if E is a nonempty 
quasi-compact topological space and f : E . R is an upper semicontinuous func­
tion on E, then there exists a point z e E such that f (z) = sup{ f (x) : x e E}. In 
other words, f attains its supremum on E .Asa consequence of the above-mentioned 
fact and of Theorem 1.14, we obtain that any real-valued continuous function defined 
on a nonempty quasi-compact topological space attains its infimum and attains its 
supremum, so is bounded (in this connection, see also Exercise 1.17).
Theorem 1.16 Let E be an arbitrary quasi-compact topological space and let 
{fn : n e N} be an increasing sequence of real-valued functions on E such that 
these two conditions are satisfied:
(1) all fn (n e N) are lower semicontinuous;
(2) for each x e E, there exists limn.. fn (x).
Let f : E . R be defined as follows:
f (x) = Ini), ....fn(x) 
(x e E).
If the function f is upper semicontinuous on E, then the given sequence {fn : n e N} 
converges to f uniformly.
Proof Suppose that f is upper semicontinuous at all points of E. Fix a real e > 
0. For any x e E, there exists an open neighborhood U(x, e) such that (Vy e 
U(x, s))( f (y) < f (x) + e/3). Also, there exists a natural number n(x, e) such that 
f (x) < fn(X,«)(x) + s/3.
Further, since the function /„(X,E) is lower semicontinuous, there exists an open 
neighborhood V(x, e) such that
(Vy e V (x,s))( Jn( ,,/''■' < fn ( !,.- ' У) + e/3) .
Let W(x, e) = U(x, e) П V(x, e). Then, for the neighborhood W(x, e), we have
(Vy e W(x, e))(f (y) < /„(x,e)(y) + e).
Using the quasi-compactness of E, we can find a finite family of open neighborhoods 
W(xi, e), W(x2, e),..., W(x*, e) which collectively cover E. Simultaneously, we 
get the corresponding finite family of natural numbers n (x1, e), n(x2, e),..., n(x *, e). 
Defining
n(e) = max{n(x1, e), n(x2, e),..., n(x*, e)},
we see that, for every point y e E, the relation f (y) < fn(e) (y) + e holds true. Since 
the sequence {fn : n e N} is increasing, we deduce that
(Vy e E)(Vn > n(e))(fn(y) < f(y) < fn(y) + e),
which trivially gives us the uniform convergence of {fn : n e N}, and the proof is 
finished.

1 Real-Valued Semicontinuous Functions
Naturally, we have a direct analog of the previous theorem in terms of a decreasing 
sequence of upper semicontinuous real-valued functions on E.
Theorem 1.17 Let E be an arbitrary quasi-compact topological space and let 
{fn : n e N} be a decreasing sequence of real-valued functions on E such that 
these two conditions are satisfied:
(1) all fn (n e N) are upper semicontinuous;
(2) for each x e E, there exists limn.. fn (x).
Let f : E . R be defined as follows:
f (x) = Inri, .... fn(x) 
(x e E).
If the function f is lower semicontinuous on E, then the given sequence {fn : n e N} 
converges to f uniformly.
Proof It suffices to consider the increasing sequence {-fn : n e N} of lower 
semicontinuous real-valued functions on E and to apply Theorem 1.16. 
□
The last two theorems enable us to prove a classical result of mathematical 
analysis, which is due to Dini (cf. [33, 37, 75]).
Theorem 1.18 Let E be an arbitrary quasi-compact topological space and let 
{fn : n e N} be a monotone sequence of real-valued functions on E such that:
(1) all fn (n e N) are continuous;
(2) for each x e E, there exists limn.. fn (x).
Let f : E . R be defined as follows:
f (x) = limn.. fn (x) 
(x e E).
Then these two assertions are equivalent:
(a) the sequence {fn : n e N} converges uniformly to f;
(b) the function f is continuous on E.
Proof The implication (a) ^ (b) is trivial in view of condition (1).
Suppose now that (b) is valid.
First, consider the case of an increasing sequence {fn : n e N}. In this case, 
all fn (n e N) are continuous (hence lower semicontinuous) functions and f is 
simultaneously lower and upper semicontinuous. By virtue of Theorem 1.16, the 
sequence {fn : n e N} converges uniformly to f, i.e., (a) holds true.
At the end, consider the case of a decreasing sequence {fn : n e N}. In this 
case, all fn (n e N) are continuous (hence upper semicontinuous) functions and f 
is simultaneously lower and upper semicontinuous. By virtue of Theorem 1.17, the 
sequence {fn : n e N} converges uniformly to f, i.e., (a) again holds true.
This completes the proof of Dini’s theorem.

Lemma 1.19 Let (E1, T) and (E2, T) be two topological spaces, let B1 be a base 
of (E1, T) and let B2 be a base of (E2, T).
Then the family B = {U x V : U e B1, V e B2} is a base of the topological 
product space E1 x E2.
In particular, card(B) = card(B1) • card(B2).
This lemma easily follows from the definition of the product of two topological 
spaces.
Example 1.20 Let E1 be a topological space having a base of infinite cardinality a 
and let E2 be a nonempty topological space with a countable base. According to 
Lemma 1.19, the space E1 x E2 has a base of cardinality a.
Lemma 1.21 Let (E, T) be a topological space and let B be a base of (E, T). 
Suppose that U = U{^,- : i e I}, where {Ui : i e I} is some family of open subsets 
of E.
Then there exists a set J с I such that:
(1) card( J) < card(B);
(2) U = U{Uj : j e J}.
Proof Define a family B' с B as follows:
B’ = {V e B : (Bi e I)(V с Ut)}.
For each V e B', choose an index j(V) e I satisfying V с Uj(v) and put
J = {j(V) : V e B'}.
A straightforward verification shows that the set J is as required. 
□
Example 1.22 Let (E, T) be a topological space and let B be a base of (E, T). 
Suppose that F = n{F{ : i e I}, where {F{ : i e I} is some family of closed subsets 
of E. By virtue of Lemma 1.21, there exists a set J с I such that card(J) < card(B) 
and F = n{F, : j e J}.
Recall that a Hausdorff topological space E is completely regular if, for each point 
x0 e E and for any closed set X с E not containing x0, there exists a continuous 
function f0 : E ^ [0,1] satisfying the conditions /01X = 0 and /0(x0) = 1.
It can readily be seen that the above definition is equivalent to the following:
A Hausdorff topological space E is completely regular if, for each point x0 e E 
and for every closed set X с E not containing x0, there exists a continuous function 
f0: E ^ [a, b] such that f01X = a and f0(x0) = b (here a and b are any two given 
real numbers satisfying < ).
It is well known that all metric spaces are completely regular (and even perfectly 
normal). Moreover, the Hausdorff completely regular spaces can be characterized as 
subspaces of normal spaces or as subspaces of compact spaces (see, e.g., [37, 75, 
111]).

1 Real-Valued Semicontinuous Functions
Recall that, for a topological space E, its (topological) weight is defined as the 
minimum of the cardinalities of all bases of E. The weight of E is usually denoted 
by the symbol w (E).
Obviously, w(E) is one of the main topological invariants, i.e., if E1 and E2 are 
any two homeomorphic topological spaces, then w(E1) = w(E2).
Lemma 1.23 Let E be a completely regular topological space, let U be an open 
subset of E, and let xu denote the characteristic function of U.
Then xu = sup{ fi : i e I} for some family {fi : i e I} of continuous functions 
on E such that ran( fi) c [0,1] for each index i e I.
Proof Take an arbitrary point x e U and consider the closed set E \ U. Since E is 
completely regular, there exists a function fx : E ^ [0,1] such that fx (x) = 1 and 
f |(E \ U) = 0. Clearly, we have
fVy e E)(fx(у) < xu(y)), 
fx(x) = Xu(x) = t
whence it immediately follows that xu = sup{ fx : x e U}.
Lemma 1.23 has thus been proved. 
□
Lemma 1.24 Let E be a topological space and let f : E ^ R be a non-negative 
lower semicontinuous function.
Then there exists a family {fi : i e I} of real-valued non-negative functions on E 
satisfying the following conditions:
(1) f = sup{ fi : i e I};
(2) for each index i e I, the function fi is representable in the form fi = tt xu,, where 
ti > 0 and Ui is an open subset of E.
Proof It suffices to prove that if x e E and f (x) > 0, then, for any real s from 
the interval ] 0, f (x)[, there exists an open set UE,x c E such that x e UE,x and 
(f (x) — s)Xus x < f. Since the given function f is lower semicontinuous at x, there 
is an open neighborhood V(x) satisfying (Vy e V(x))(f (у) > f (x) - s).
So we may put U£,x = V(x), which completes the proof. 
□
Theorem 1.25 Let E be a completely regular space with w(E) > card(N) and let 
f : E ^ R be a lower semicontinuous function such that, for some a e R, one has 
(Vx e E)(f (x) > a).
Then there exists a family {f,• : j e J} of real-valued continuous functions on E 
satisfying the following conditions:
(1) card( J) < w(E);
(2) f = sup{ ff : j e J};
(3) (Vj e J)(Vx e E)(ff (x) > a).
Proof Without loss of generality, we may assume that a = 0. Lemmas 1.23 and 
1.24 readily imply that f = sup{ fi : i e I}, where {fi : i e I} is some family of 
real-valued non-negative continuous functions on E.

1 Real-Valued Semicontinuous Functions
11
Now, consider the topological product space E xR. According to Lemma 1.19, the 
topological weight of E x R does not exceed w(E), because Rpossesses a countable 
base (cf. Example 1.20). We also have the equality
nf) = п{Г*(/;■) : i 61}.
Since all the sets Г*( f) and Г*( ft) (i 6 I) are closed in E x R, we can apply to 
them the result formulated in Example 1.22. Consequently, there exists a set J с I 
such that:
(a) card( J) < w(E);
(b) Г*(f) = П{Г*(f,•) : j 6 J}.
Finally, taking into account Exercise 1.13, we conclude that the equality f = 
sup{ f ,■ : j 6 J} holds true.
This ends the proof of Theorem 1.25. 
□
Remark 1.26 The dual version of the previous theorem is formulated as follows. 
Again let E be a completely regular space with w (E) > card(N) and let g : E — R 
be an upper semicontinuous function such that, for some b 6 R, one has (Vx 6 
E)(g(x) < b).
Then there exists a family {g, : j 6 J} of real-valued continuous functions on E 
satisfying the following conditions:
(1) card(J) < w(E);
(2) 
g = inf{g : 6 J};
(3) (Vj 6 J)(Vx 6 E)(gy (x) < b).
Remark 1.27 Suppose in Theorem 1.25 that w(E) = card(N). Then, for a lower 
semicontinuous function f : E — [a, +to[, we may assert that there exists a 
countable family of functions {fn : n 6 N} such that every fn acts from E into 
[a, +to[, is continuous on E, and f = sup{fn : n 6 N}. Moreover, introducing for 
each n 6 N the function
фп = sup{ fk : 0 < к < n},
we come to the increasing sequence of continuous functions {фп : n 6 N} such that 
f = limn ——to фп.
Analogously, under the same assumption w(E) = card(N), for an upper semi­
continuous function g : E — ] - to, b], we may assert that there exists a countable 
family of functions {gn : n 6 N} such that every gn acts from E into ] - to, b], is 
continuous on E, and g = inf{gn : n 6 N}. Moreover, introducing for each n 6 N 
the function
= inf{g : 0 < к < n},
we come to the decreasing sequence of continuous functions { 
: n 6 N} such that
g = lim—to .
These facts are often used in various applications of lower (upper) semicontinuous 
functions.

1 Real-Valued Semicontinuous Functions
Recall that, for a function ф : E — R, the symbol ф+ denotes the real-valued 
function on E defined as follows:
, / л _ IФ (x) if Ф(х) > 0 
гЛ -| о if ф(х) < о.
Lemma 1.28 The following two assertions hold:
(1) if ф < ф, then ф+ < ф+;
(2) ifФ — limn ——отфп, then Ф+ — limn—OT((фп)+).
The proof of Lemma 1.28 is easy and is left to the reader.
We now present a simplified version of the so-called separation theorem for two 
functions, one of which is upper semicontinuous and the other is lower semicontin- 
uous.
Theorem 1.29 Let E be any topological space, let {fn : n e N} be an increasing 
sequence of real-valued continuous functions on E, and let {gn : n e N} be a 
decreasing sequence of real-valued continuous functions on E, such that there exist 
two pointwise limits
f — limn—от Уп, 
g — limn—OTgn,
which satisfy the inequality g < f.
Then there exists a continuous function h : E — R that separates f and g, i.e., 
the relation g < h < f holds true.
Proof For any n e N, it will be convenient to introduce the notation
Фп — (gn — fn) + , 
Фп — (gn — fn.+1)+•
Since all the functions fn and gn are continuous, the produced functions фп and фп 
are also continuous. Using this notation and keeping in mind Lemma 1.28, it is easy 
to check that:
(a) 
фп > фп > фп+1 > 0 for each n e N;
(b) limn—отфп — limn—отфп — 0.
Now, for any point x e E, let us define
h (x) — fo (x) + фо (x) - фо (x) + Ф1 (x) - ф1 (x) + Ф2 (x) - ф2 (x) + • • • .
In view of (a) and (b), the above alternating series converges and the value h (x) is 
well-defined. So we come to the function h : E — R.
From the representation of h one easily infers that h is a pointwise limit of an 
increasing sequence of real-valued continuous functions on E and, simultaneously, 
h is a pointwise limit of a decreasing sequence of real-valued continuous functions 
on E .By virtue of Remark 1.6, the same h is continuous on E .It remains to verify 
that g (x) < h (x) < f (x) whenever x e E.
For this purpose, consider the two possible cases.

1 Real-Valued Semicontinuous Functions
13
1. 
x e E is such that g(x) = f (x).
In this case, we have gn (x) > fm (x) for all n, m e N, and h (x) is equal to
fo(x) + (go (x) - fo(x)) - (go (x) - fi (x)) + (gi (x) - fi (x)) - (gi (x) - f2(x)) + • • • , 
which immediately gives us
h(x) = l im, ....fn = lim, ....gn = f(x) = g(x).
2. 
x e E is such that g(x) < f (x).
In this case, for all sufficiently large m e N, we have gm (x) < fm (x), so in the above 
series only finitely many terms differ from zero. In other words, there is a least n e N 
such that either фп (x) = 0 or фп (x) = 0.
Let n satisfy
фо (x) > 0, фо (x) > 0,..., фп-1 (x) > 0, фп (x) = 0.
Then we may write
h(x) = /0(x) + (g0(x) - /0(x))--------(gn-i (x) - fn(x)) = fn(x),
whence it follows that g(x) < gn(x) < fn(x) = h(x) < f (x).
Let now n satisfy
Ф0 (x) > 0, Ф0 (x) > 0, . . . , Фп (x) > 0, Фп (x) = 0.
Then we may write
h(x) = /0(x) + (g0(x) - /0(x))----- + (gn(x) - fn(x)) = gn(x),
whence it follows that g(x) < gn(x) = h(x) < fn+i(x) < f (x).
This finishes the proof of Theorem 1.29. 
□
Remark 1.30 Theorem 1.29 directly implies the following result.
Let E be a separable metric space and let f and g be two real-valued functions 
on E such that:
(a) 
g < f;
(b) f is a lower semicontinuous function;
(c) 
g is an upper semicontinuous function.
Then there exists a continuous function h : E . R which separates f and g, i.e., 
g < h < f.
The result just presented admits a generalization to the case of a much more general 
topological space E on which two real-valued semicontinuous functions f and g are 
given (in this connection, see e.g. [37, 75]). Actually, Theorem 1.29 belongs to a 
group of results concerning the existence of various kinds of selectors with prescribed 
“good” properties. We mean here theorems on the existence of continuous selectors,

measurable selectors, and selectors having certain algebraic properties. This topic is 
very important for many branches of contemporary mathematics, because results of 
the above-mentioned type have found numerous practical and theoretical applications 
(see, for instance, [15, 29, 37, 43, 74, 112, 119, 130, 133]).
Exercises
1.1 Let E be a topological space and let f : E ^ R be a function. Suppose that f 
has a local minimum (respectively, a local maximum) at x0 e E.
Check that f is lower semicontinuous (respectively, upper semicontinuous) at x0.
Infer from this fact that if E = R, then a function f : R ^ R can be semicontin- 
uous at 0 e R, but without the one-sided limits at 0 .
1.2 Give a detailed proof of the fact that if E is a topological space, x0 is a point of E, 
and f : E ^ R and g : E ^ R are two functions upper (lower) semicontinuous at 
x0, then the functions sup( f, g) and inf (f, g) are also upper (lower) semicontinuous 
at the same point x0 .
1.3 Let f : R ^ R and g : R ^ R be defined as follows:
f (0) = 1 and f (x) = 0 for all nonzero x e R;
g(0) = -1 and g(x) = -2 for all nonzero x e R.
Verify that:
(a) both functions f and g are upper semicontinuous at 0;
(b) the function f • g is lower semicontinuous at 0, but is not upper semicontinuous 
at 0.
Conclude that the assumption of the non-negativity of both functions f and g in 
assertion (4) of Theorem 1.3 is essential for the validity of (4).
1.4 Check that the definition of a convex cone in a real vector space , which was 
formulated in Remark
, is compatible with the standard definition ofa convex set 
in .

1.5 Give an example of a monotone function f acting from R into R such that f is 
not lower semicontinuous at 0 and is not upper semicontinuous at the same 0.
1.6 Let f : R ^ R and g : R ^ R be defined as follows:
f = the characteristic function of {0};
g = the characteristic function of {1}.
Check that:

15
(a) both f and g are upper semicontinuous at all points of R;
(b) the composition f ◦ g is not upper semicontinuous at 1;
(c) the composition f ◦ g is lower semicontinuous at 1.
1.7 
* Let E be a topological space, x0 be a point of E, and let two functions f : R ^ R 
and g : E ^ R satisfy the following conditions:
(a) f is increasing and upper semicontinuous at g (x0);
(b) 
g is upper semicontinuous at x0.
Prove that the composition f ◦ g is upper semicontinuous at x0.
For this purpose, argue as follows.
Since f is upper semicontinuous at g(x0), for any real s > 0, there exists a real 
6 > 0 such that
(i) (Vy)(g(x0) - 6 < у < g(X0) + 6 ^ f(y) < f (g(X0)) + s).
Further, since g is upper semicontinuous at x0, for the same 6 > 0, there exists a 
neighborhood U (x0) such that
(ii) 
(Vx)(x e U(X0) ^ g(x) < g(X0) + S).
Let now x be an arbitrary point from U (x0). If one has
g(x0) - S < g(x) < g(x0) + S,
then f (g(x)) < f (g(x0))+ £ in view of (i). If g(x) g ] g(x0) - 6,g(x0)+ 8 [, then, in 
view of (ii), one has g(x) < g(x0) - 6 < g(x0). Remembering that f is an increasing 
function, one obtains
f (g(x)) < f (g(x0)) < f (g(x0))+ s,
which establishes the upper semicontinuity of f ◦ g at x0.
1.8 Let E be a ground set and let f : E ^ R be a function.
Prove that:
(a) each of the two sets Г*( f) and Г,( f) completely determines the function f;
(b) each of the two sets
{(x,t) e E x R : f (x) < t}, {(x,t) e E x R : f (x) > t}
also completely determines the function f.
1.9 Let E be a topological space, x0 be a point of E, and let f : E ^ R be a function. 
Show that these two assertions hold true:
(a) if any adherent point of Г*( f) с E x R, having the form (x0,t), belongs to 
Г*(f), then f is lower semicontinuous at x0;
(b) if any adherent point of Г,( f) с E x R, having the form (x0,f), belongs to Г,( f), 
then f is upper semicontinuous at x0.

For this purpose, argue similarly to the proof of Theorem 1.7.
1.10 Denoting by |_xj the greatest integer not exceeding a real number x, check that 
the floor function x ^ LxJ is upper semicontinuous on R, and deduce from this fact 
that the function
x ^ x - |xj 
(x e R)
(the fractional part of x) is lower semicontinuous on R.
1.11 Let E be a topological space and let X and Y be subsets of E.
Prove that X is an open set in E if and only if the characteristic function of X is 
lower semicontinuous on E (equivalently, Y is a closed set in E if and only if the 
characteristic function of Y is upper semicontinuous on E).
Also, show that the following three assertions are equivalent:
(a) 
E is a completely regular topological space;
(b) for any open set U с E, the characteristic function xu is the supremum of a 
family of real-valued non-negative continuous functions on E;
(c) every real-valued non-negative lower semicontinuous function on E is the supre­
mum of a family of real-valued non-negative continuous functions on E.
1.12 Let E be a topological space and let f : E ^ R be a function.
Prove that the following assertions hold:
(a) f is lower semicontinuous on E if and only if the set Г*( f) is closed in the 
product space E x R;
(b) f is upper semicontinuous on E if and only if the set Г*( f) is closed in the 
product space E x R.
For this purpose, use Theorem 1.7 and Exercise 1.9.
1.13 Let E be a ground set and let {fi : i e I} be a family of real-valued functions 
on E.
Show that:
(a) if there exists f = sup{ fi : i e I}, then Г*( f) = П{Г*( ft) : i e I};
(b) if, for some f : E ^ R, one has Г*(f) = 
П{Г*( ft) : 
i e I}, then f =
sup{ fi : i e I};
(c) if there exists g = inf{fi : i e I}, then E.(g) = П{Г*( fi) : i e I};
(d) if, for some g : E ^ R, one has r,(g) = 
П{Г,(fi) : 
i e I}, then g =
inf{fi : i e I}.
1.14 Let E be a topological space and let {fi : i e I} be a family of real-valued 
functions on E.
Verify that:
(a) if all functions fi (i e I) are lower semicontinuous and there exists f = 
sup{ fi : i e I}, then f is also lower semicontinuous;
(b) if all functions fi (i e I) are upper semicontinuous and there exists g = 
inf{fi : i e I}, then g is also upper semicontinuous.

1.15 A topological space E is called countably quasi-compact if every countable 
open covering of E contains a finite subcovering (equivalently, every countable 
centered family of closed sets in E has a nonempty intersection).
Check that any quasi-compact space is countably quasi-compact and give an 
example of a countably quasi-compact space which is not quasi-compact.
Also, verify the validity of the following statements:
(a) any closed subspace of a countably quasi-compact space is countably quasi­
compact;
(b) any continuous image of a countably quasi-compact space is countably quasi­
compact.

* For a topological space E, prove that the following two assertions are equiva­
lent:
(a) E is countably quasi-compact;
(b) every countably infinite subset of E has at least one accumulation point in E.
In order to show the implication (a) ^ (b), suppose (a) and consider any countably 
infinite set X = {xn : n e N} in E. For each к e N, define
Fk = cl({x„ : n e N & n > к}).
Then all sets Fk are closed, nonempty, and F0 d F1 d • • • d Fk d • • • .In view of 
(a), there exists a point x e n{Fk : к e N}. Verify that this x is an accumulation 
point of X .
In order to show the implication (b) ^ (a), suppose (b) and take any countable 
centered family { Fn : n e N} of closed sets in E. Assume, without loss of generality, 
that
Fo d Fi d • • • d Fn d • •• , 
(Vn e N)( Fn \ Fn+i + 0).
Further, for each n e N, choose a point xn e Fn \ Fn+1 and consider the countably 
infinite set X = {xn : n e N}. In view of (b), there exists an accumulation point x of 
X. Verify that x e n{Fn : n e N}.
Remark 1.31 Let E be a topological space and let X be a subset of E .A point x e E 
is called a complete accumulation point of X if, for any neighborhood U(x), the 
cardinality of U(x) П X is equal to the cardinality of X.
The following two assertions are equivalent for E:
(a) E is quasi-compact;
(b) for every infinite subset X of E, there exists a complete accumulation point of X.
The proof of this equivalence is based on the idea presented in Exercise 1.16 (how­
ever, the argument essentially uses the method of transfinite induction; more details 
can be found in [37], [75] or [112]). For Exercise 1.16, a countable form of the 
Axiom of Choice is sufficient. To prove the above equivalence of (a) and (b), an 
uncountable form of AC is necessary.

* A normal topological space E is called perfectly normal if, for every nonempty 
closed subset X of E, there exists a continuous function f acting from E into R such 
that f (X) = {0} and f (x) > 0 for all x e E \ X.
Verify that every metric space is perfectly normal and give an example of a 
perfectly normal space which is not metrizable. Also, give an example of a normal 
space which is not perfectly normal.
In addition, show that, for a Hausdorff topological space E, the following two 
assertions are equivalent:
(a) E is perfectly normal;
(b) E is normal and every closed set in E can be represented as the intersection of a 
countable family of open subsets of E.
In order to show that every perfectly normal space is normal, argue as follows. Let 
A and В be two nonempty disjoint closed sets in a perfectly normal space E.
Let f : E ^ R and g : E ^ R be continuous functions such that
f (A) = {0}, f (E \ A) c ]0, +~[, g (В) = {0}, g (E \ В) c ] 0, +~[.
Consider the continuous function f - g and observe that
A c (f - g)-1 (] -~, 0[), 
В c (f - g)-1 (]0, +~[),
which shows that A and В are separated by two disjoint open sets in E.

equipped with the Hausdorff metric d, i.e.,
d(X,Y) = inf{e > 0 : Y c V£(X) & X c V£(Y)},
where X and Y are any two members of К[0,1] (here V£ (X) stands for the e­
neighborhood of X and Ve (Y) stands for the E-neighborhood of Y).
Let A : К [0,1] ^ [0,1] denote the restriction of the standard Lebesgue measure 
on R to К [0,1].
Verify that A is an upper semicontinuous function and is not lower semicontinuous.
1.23 Prove that, for a metric space E, these three assertions are equivalent:
(a) 
E is compact;
(b) every real-valued continuous function on E attains its supremum;
(c) every real-valued continuous function on E is bounded from above.
Remark 1.32 There are many non-metrizable non-compact topological spaces E 
such that both assertions (b) and (c) are true for E. In particular, one such space is the 
set [0, 1 [ of all at most countable ordinals, equipped with its order topology. Notice 
by the way that [0, 1 [ is countably quasi-compact. As is known, the topological 
product of any family of quasi-compact spaces is also quasi-compact (in ZF set 
theory this statement is equivalent to the Axiom of Choice). On the other hand, there 
are even two countably quasi-compact spaces X and Y such that their topological 
product X x Y is not countably quasi-compact (for more details, see e.g. [37]).

Let E be an arbitrary topological space. In this chapter, we will be dealing with 
various real-valued functions defined on some subsets of E (i.e., partial real-valued 
functions on E).
A partial function f : E ^ R is called locally bounded from above (from below) 
at a point x e E if there exists a neighborhood U(x) of this point such that the set 
f (U(x)) is bounded from above (from below) in R.
In this definition we do not assume that x e dom( f), and we mean in the sequel 
that the empty subset of R is bounded (because 0 is contained in any bounded 
subinterval of R).
Accordingly, we shall say that a partial function f : E ^ R is locally bounded at 
x e E if there exists a neighborhood U(x) of x such that the set f (U(x)) is bounded 
in R.
Theorem 2.1 Let E be a quasi-compact space and let f : E ^ R be a partial 
function locally bounded from above (from below) at all points of E.
Then f is bounded from above (from below) on E.
Consequently, if f : E ^ R is locally bounded at all points of E, then f is 
bounded on E.
Proof It suffices to consider the case when f is locally bounded from above at each 
point of E. For any x e E, there exist a neighborhood U(x) and a real constant 
t (x) > 0 such that
(Vy)(у e U(x) ^ f (y) < t(x)).
We thus come to the open covering {U(x) : x e E} of E and, by virtue of the 
quasi-compactness of E, there exist finitely many points x1, x2, ..., xn in E such 
that E c U(x1) U U(x2) U ... U U(xn). Now, defining
t = max(f (xi), t(x2),..., t(xn)),
we easily conclude that f (x) < t for every point x e E, which completes the proofs

2 The Oscillations of Real-Valued Functions
It immediately follows from Theorem 2.1 that if f : E . R is a partial function 
locally bounded from above (from below) at all points of E, then the restriction 
of f to any quasi-compact subspace of E is bounded from above (from below). 
Consequently, if f is locally bounded at all points of E, then its restriction to any 
quasi-compact subspace of E is bounded.
Let us consider more thoroughly the behavior of a given partial function f : E . 
R at a fixed point x0 e E which belongs to the closure of dom(f).
In any case, there exist two values associated with f and x0:
li'misup, ,s f (x), 
liminfs .sf (x).
Here we do not exclude the cases when
limsiiix ,s f (x) = +“, 
liminfs ,sf (x) = -“.
Obviously, one has the inequality
liminfx^xo f (x) < limsupx- .s f (x).
Notice also that if x0 e dom( f), then
liminfx^xo f (x) < f (xo) < limsupx.xo f (x),
so in this situation one cannot have
limsupx^x0 f (x) = —“ V liminfs ,s f (x) = +“.
Obviously, f is not locally bounded from above at x0 if and only if limsupx.xo f (x) 
= +“, and f is not locally bounded from below at x0 if and only if liminfx.xo f (x) = 
-“.
Thus, the two values limsupx.xo f (x) and liminfx.xo f (x) yield a certain char­
acterization of the behavior of f at x0.
One may introduce the following third value:
О f (xo) = limsupx^xo f (x) — liminfx.xo f (x).
This value is called the oscillation of f at x0. Note that the above formula makes 
sense if at least one of the values limsupx.xo f (x) and liminfx.xo f (x) is finite. If 
both of them are infinite, then by definition О f (x0) = +“.
Some simple properties of О f (x0) are presented in the following theorem.
Theorem 2. 2 These four assertions hold:
(1) Оf (xo) > 0;
(2) 
О f (xo) is finite if and only if both values
limsupx.... f(x), liminfs .s f(x)

are finite;
(3) for any t e R, one has Оtf (xq) = It |0f (x0); in particular,
О - f (xq) = О f (xq);
(4) if xq e dom( f), then the equality О f (xq) = 0 is equivalent to the continuity of f 
at xq.
The proof of Theorem 2.2 directly follows from the definition of О f (x0) and is 
left to the reader.
Sometimes, it is useful to consider a more general situation when a partial function 
f : E . M is given, where (M, d) is a metric space.
In this case, for a fixed point x0 belonging to the closure of dom( f), the values 
limsupx.Xof(x) and liminfx^X0f(x) are, in general, meaningless. However, the 
oscillation of f at x0 can be defined by the following formula:
Оf (xq) = limir(x ... di.im' f (U(xq))).
Here U(xq) is any neighborhood of xq, the symbol diam( f (U(xq))) denotes the 
diameter of f (U(xq)), and the limit is understood with respect to the filter U(xq) of 
all neighborhoods of xq . Equivalently, we may write
Оf (xq) = inf{diam(f (^)) : U e U(xq)}.
As earlier, we do not exclude the infinite limit in the above formula, so the equality 
О f (xq) = +c» can take place.
If a point xq e E does not belong to the set cl(dom(f)), then it is convenient to 
define Оf (xq) = 0.
Fortunately, for the real line R, which is treated as a metric space (with respect 
to the standard metric of R), the two definitions of the oscillation of f at xq are 
completely compatible.
Theorem 2. 3 For E = R, both definitions of the oscillation of a partial function 
f : E . R at a point xq e E are equivalent, i.e., they give the same value.
Proof To prove this equivalence, let us introduce the notation:
Оf (xq) = limsiip, ., f (x) - liminfs ... f (x);
О 'f (xq) = limu (xo).xodiam( f (U (xq))) .
Our goal is to show that О f (xq) = О(xq). First of all, it is easy to verify that
О f (xq) = +с» « О 'f (xq ) = +<x>.
So we may restrict our further argument to the case when Оf (xq ) < +c» and 
О(xq) < +<x>.

2 The Oscillations of Real-Valued Functions
Take a real £ > 0. By the definitions of the values limsup...o f (x) and 
liminf v.Vo f (x), there exists a neighborhood U(xo) such that
(Vz e U(xo))(f (z) < limisups ,s f (x) + £/2),
and there exists a neighborhood V(xo) such that
(Vy e V(xo))( f (y) > liminf. ... f (x) - e/2) .
Consider the neighborhood W(xo) = U(xo) П V(x0). Then, for any two points y and 
z from W (xo), we have
If (У) — f (z)| < (limisups .. f (x) + £/2) - (liminf.. ... f (x) - £/2)
= О f (xo) + £.
Consequently, we may write
diam(f (W(xo))) = sup{| f (y) - f (z)| : {y,z} c W(xo)} < Оf (xo) + £,
О'f (xo) < diam(f (W(xo))) < Оf (xo) + £.
Since £ > o was taken arbitrarily small, we deduce that О(xo) < Оf (xo).
To show the validity of the reverse inequality, take again a real £ > o and consider 
an arbitrary neighborhood G(xo) of xo. Again, by the definitions of limsup...o f (x) 
and of liminf...o f (x), there exists a point y e G(xo) such that
f (y) > limsup...o f (x) - £/2,
and there exists a point z e G(xo) such that
f (z) < liminf...o f (x) + s/2.
Consequently, we have
diam(f (G(xo))) > | f (y) - f (z)| > f (y) - f (z) > Оf (xo) - £, 
whence it follows that
О'f (xo) = limG(.o)..odiam( f (G(xo))) > Оf (xo) - £.
Finally, keeping in mind the arbitrary smallness of £ > o, we conclude that О(xo) > 
О f (xo) and so obtain the desired equality О f (xo) = О(xo).
Theorem 
has thus been proved. 
□
2. 3 
The next theorem reveals the finite subadditivity of Оf (xo), which is a much 
deeper property than those presented in Theorem 2.2.

2 The Oscillations of Real-Valued Functions
25
Theorem 2. 4 Let E be a topological space, {fn : 1 < n < к} be a finite family of 
real-valued partial functions on E, and let x0 be a point of E. Suppose also that the 
partial function f = £{ fn : 1 < n < к} is such that x0 belongs to cl(dom( f)).
Then the inequality Оf (x0) < ^{Ofn(x0) : 1 < n < к} holds true.
Proof It suffices to restrict the argument to the case when
^{Ofn (xo) : 1 < n < к} < +TO.
In this case, we use the second definition of О f (x0). According to it, we may write
Оf (x0) = limy(, 
-, dio.mi' f (UO0))).
Fix a real s > 0. Then consider any neighborhood U(x0) and choose two points x 
and у from U(x0) П dom( f) such that
I f (x) — f (у)| > diam( f (U(x0))) - £.
Since we have
/(x) = ^{ fn(x) : 1 < n < к}, 
f (у) = ^{ fn(у) : 1 < n < к},
the inequality
I/(x) — f (у)| < £{|f„(x) - fn(у)| : 1 < n < к}
holds, whence it follows that
diam(f (U(x0))) - e < ^{diam(fn(U(x0))) : 1 < n < к}
and, taking the limits of both sides of the last inequality (with respect to the filter 
U(x0)), we get
Оf (x0) — £ < ^{Ofn(x0) : 1 < n < к}.
Finally, in view of the arbitrary smallness of £ > 0, we come to the required finite 
subadditivity of О f (x0). 
□
As a simple corollary of Theorem 2.4, we obtain the next useful result.
Theorem 2. 5 For any two functions f : E ^ R and g : E ^ R and for a point 
x0 e E, the following two assertions are true:
(1) Оf+g (x0) < Оf (x0) + Og (x0);
(2) Оf-g(x0) > |Of (x0) - Оg(x0)|.
Consequently, the three non-negative real values
^ f (x0), ^g (x0), О f+g (x0)
may be considered as the side lengths of a certain (possibly, degenerate) triangle.

2 The Oscillations of Real-Valued Functions
Here we would like to make one remark. Suppose that E is a topological space, 
(M, d) is a metric space, and f : E . M is a partial function locally bounded at 
all points of the closure of dom(f). Then the value О f (x) is finite for any point 
belonging to cl(dom( f)). Thus, we may introduce a non-negative function
Оf : cl(dom(f)) . R
which provides some information about the behavior of f.
Naturally, О f is called the oscillation function associated with f.
Let E be a topological space and let f : E . R be a function. Suppose that this 
f is locally bounded from above at a point x0 e E. Then one can consider the real 
value f*(xo) = liiiisipp ,s f (x).
Moreover, if f is locally bounded from above at all points x e E, then we come 
to the corresponding function f * : E . R defined by the formula
f * (x) = limsipp. . s f (y) 
(x e E).
The following statement is readily obtained from the above definition.
Theorem 2.6 The real-valued function f * is upper semicontinuous on the entire 
space E.
Proof Take any point x0 e E and consider the value f * (x0). By definition of f * (x0), 
for every real s > 0, there exists an open neighborhood U(x0) such that
(Vx e U(xo))(f (x) < f*(xo) + e).
This formula trivially implies
(Vx e U(xo))(f *(x) < f *(xo) + z),
which shows us that the function f * is upper semicontinuous at x0. Since x0 was 
taken arbitrarily in E, we come to the desired result.
Theorem 
 has thus been proved. 
□
2. 6
Similarly, if a function g : E . R is locally bounded from below at x0 e E, then 
one can consider the real value * (xo) = liminf . o(x).
Moreover, if g is locally bounded from below at all points x e E, then we come 
to the corresponding function g* : E . R defined by the formula
g*(x) = liminfy.xg (y) 
(x e E).
The next result is completely analogous to Theorem 2.6.
Theorem 2. 7 The real-valued function g* is lower semicontinuous on the entire 
space E.

2 The Oscillations of Real-Valued Functions
27
Proof Consider the function -g, which is locally bounded from above on E. Ac­
cording to Theorem 2.6, the function (-g)* is upper semicontinuous on E. Now, 
since we have the equality -((-g)*) = g*, the required result immediately follows.□
Let h : E ^ R be a function which is locally bounded at all points of the topo­
logical space E. Then we may simultaneously introduce two real-valued functions 
h* and h* canonically associated with h by the formulas
h*(x) = lirnsupv^v h (y), 
h*(x) = liminf v^v h (y),
where x e E. As has already been mentioned, h* is upper semicontinuous on E and 
h* is lower semicontinuous on E. We also have the real-valued function Оh = h*- h*, 
which is called the oscillation function of h.
Theorem 2. 8 The following three assertions are valid:
(1) the function h is continuous at x0 e E if and only if О h (x0) = 0;
(2) the function О h is non-negative and upper semicontinuous on E;
(3) if t e R and x e E, then Oth(x) = It|Oh(x) (consequently, one has O-h(x) = 
О h (x)).
Proof A straightforward verification of (1) and (3) is left to the reader. Let us check 
the validity of assertion (2). The non-negativity of Оh is trivial. Further, we may 
write
О h = h* + (-(h*)).
By virtue of Theorem 2.7, the function h* is lower semicontinuous, so the function 
-(h*) is upper semicontinuous. As is known, the sum of any two upper semicontinu- 
ous functions on E is upper semicontinuous on E (see Theorem 1.3). Consequently, 
Оh is an upper semicontinuous function on E, and the proof is complete. □
Now, our goal is to prove that, for any non-negative upper semicontinuous function 
О : R ^ R, there exists a function h : R ^ R such that О = Оh.
For this purpose, we need one useful notion from classical point set theory.
Let be a subset of the plane R2 and let be a point of R2 .
This is called a condensation point of if every neighborhood of contains 
uncountably many points of .
More generally, suppose that E is an arbitrary topological space and x is a point in 
E. Then x is called a condensation point of E if any neighborhood of x is uncountable 
(see, for instance, [37, 75, 111]).
Lemma 2.9 If a set Z c R2 is uncountable, then Z can be represented in the form
Z = Zo U Zi 
(Zo О Zi = 0),
where Z0 is at most countable and Z1 coincides with the set of all those condensation 
points of Z which belong to Z.

28
2 The Oscillations of Real-Valued Functions
The proof of Lemma 2.9 is left to the reader. Actually, this lemma follows from 
the fact that the subspace of R2 has a countable base (cf. Exercise 2.13).
As an immediate corollary of Lemma 2.9, we get the next lemma.
Lemma 2.10 Let f : R ^ R be a partial function whose domain is an uncountable 
subset of R.
Then one has the equality dom( f) = X U Y, where
(1) 
X П Y = 0;
(2) for any x e X, the point (x, f (x) ) is not a condensation point of the graph of f;
(3) for any у e Y, the point (y, f (y)) is a condensation point of the graph of f.
In particular, card(X) < card(N) and card(Y) > card(N).
We now are ready to formulate and prove the following theorem.
Theorem 2.11 For every non-negative upper semicontinuous function О : R ^ R, 
there exists a Borel function f : R ^ R such that О = О f.
Proof According to Lemma 2.10, we may write R = X U Y, where:
(a) 
X П Y = 0;
(b) for each x e X, the point (x, О (x)) is not a condensation point of the graph of 
O;
(c) for each у e Y, the point (у, О(у)) is a condensation point of the graph of О;
(d) card(X) < card (N) and card(Y) = c.
Let A be a countable everywhere dense subset of R not intersecting the set X. The 
existence of such an A is evident, because of the countability of X. We define a 
function f : R ^ R as follows:
(i) f (x) = 0 for all x e A;
(ii) f (x) = О (x) for all x e R \ A.
Our goal is to show that the non-negative Borel function f satisfies the equality 
О f = o.
Fix arbitrarily a point x e R and consider the two possible cases.
1. 
x e X .
Since A is everywhere dense in R and f (a) = 0 for each a e A, we have
liminfy ... f (y) = 0.
At the same time, using the upper semicontinuity of О at x and keeping in mind the 
relations А П X = 0 and О (x) = f (x), we infer
li'misupy ,s f (y) = f (x) = О (x).
Therefore, we get the equalities
Оf (x) = f (x) - 0 = О (x) - 0 = О (x).

2 The Oscillations of Real-Valued Functions
29
2. 
x e R \ X.
Again, in view of the everywhere density of A in R, we have
liminfy ... f (y) = 0.
At the same time, since (x, О (x)) is a condensation point of the graph of O, the set 
A is countable, and О is upper semicontinuous at x, it is not hard to see that, as in 
the previous case,
limisupy ,s f (y) = О (x).
Therefore, we again obtain the equalities
Оf (x) = О(x) - 0 = О(x),
which completes the proof of Theorem 2.11.

For any point x e E, consider an arbitrary open neighborhood U (x) of x and check 
that

|Of (x)- Оfn (x)| < 2s
for all x e E and for all n > m. This yields the required uniform convergence of the 
sequence {Ofn : n e N} to Оf.
Deduce from the above result the following well-known theorem of classical 
mathematical analysis:
If a sequence {fn : n e N} of real-valued continuous functions on E converges 
uniformly to a function f, then f is also continuous on E.

* Let g be a non-negative upper semicontinuous real-valued function on a 
topological space E such that the equality g (x) = 0 holds true for all isolated points 
x in E. Denote by E' the closure of the set of all isolated points in E. Further, put 
U = E \ E' and observe that the open set U does not contain isolated points. Denote 
by g | U the restriction of g to U. Assume that there exists a function ф : U ^ R such 
that Оф = g\U and the relation 0 < ф < g\U holds true.
Prove that there exists a function f : E ^ [0, +s» [ such that О f = g. Moreover, 
if ф is Borel, then f can be chosen to be Borel, too.
Argue as follows. Define the required f by the formula:
f (x) = g (x) if x belongs to E', and f (x) = ф (x) if x belongs to U.
Verify that О f (x) = g (x) for each point x e E.
For this purpose, consider the two possible cases.
1. 
x e E'. In this case, it is easy to see that /.(x) = 0 and /*(x) > g(x). At the same 
time, keeping in mind the relation 0 < ф < g\U and the upper semicontinuity of 
g, infer that f *(x) < g(x), which implies
f *(x) = g(x), 
Оf (x) = f *(x) - f.(x) = g(x) - 0 = g(x).
2. 
x e U. In this case, using the equality Оф = g\U and taking into account that U 
is an open set, conclude that О f (x) = g (x), which yields the desired result.
2.17 Let E be a topological space, let g : E ^ R be a non-negative upper semicon­
tinuous function, and let {Ui : i e I} be a disjoint family of nonempty open subsets 
of E such that the union u{^- : i e I} is everywhere dense in E. Suppose also 
that, for each index i e I, there exists a function ф1 : Ui ^ R satisfying these two 
conditions:
(1) 0 < ф^ < g\Uj and the set {x e Ut : ф{(x) = 0} is everywhere dense in Ut;
(2) 
g\Ui = Оф1.
Let a function f : E ^ R be defined by the formula:
f (x) = ф((x) if x e Ui, and f (x) = g(x) if x e E \ u{^,- : i e I}.
Show that the equality g = О f holds true.
For this purpose, use an argument similar to the one given in Exercise 2.16.
2.18 Let E be a locally separable metric Baire space and let g : E ^ R be a non­
negative upper semicontinuous function such that g (x) = 0 for any isolated point x 
of E.
Prove that there exists a Borel function f : E ^ R for which g = О f.
2.19 Let b be an infinite cardinal number and let E be a topological space.
A point x e E is called a b-point in E if there exists a neighborhood U(x) of x 
whose cardinality does not exceed b.
Prove that if E is a topological space with a base whose cardinality does not 
exceed b, then the cardinality of the set of all b-points in E also does not exceed b.

2.20 Let E be a topological space satisfying the following condition:
There exists an infinite base B of E such that the cardinality of any nonempty set 
U e B is strictly greater than card(B).

there exists a function f : E ^ R such that О f = g.
2.21 Let E be a metric space satisfying the condition of Exercise 
.
2.20
Show that, for every non-negative upper semicontinuous function g : E ^ R, 
there exists a Borel function f : E ^ R such that О f = g.
For this purpose, use the following fact:
If X с E has cardinality strictly less than card(E), then there exists an everywhere 
dense set Y с E of type F^ in E such that X П Y = @ and card(Y) < card( E).
2.22 
* Let E be a non-discrete locally compact <r-compact topological group and let 
g : E ^ R be a non-negative upper semicontinuous function.
Prove that there exists a function f : E ^ R such that О f = g.
For this purpose, use the following important equality:
card( E) = 2W (E),
where w(E) denotes the topological weight of E (see, e.g., [62]).
2.23 
* Recall that a topological space E is resolvable (in the sense of E. Hewitt) if 
there exists a partition {A, B} of E such that both sets A and В are everywhere dense 
in E (see [61]). Otherwise, E is called an irresolvable space.
Check that the following assertions are valid:
(a) any nonempty open subspace of a resolvable space is resolvable;
(b) the topological product of a family {Е,- : i e I} of nonempty topological spaces 
is resolvable whenever at least one Е,- is resolvable;
(c) the nonempty topological sum of a family {Е,- : i e I} of nonempty topological 
spaces is resolvable if and only if all Е,- (i e I) are resolvable;
(d) if nonempty E possesses a pseudo-base all members of which are resolvable, 
then E itself is resolvable;
(e) any nonempty locally compact space without isolated points is resolvable;
(f) any nonempty metric space without isolated points is resolvable;
(g) if E is resolvable, then for each F,r-subset X of E there exists a function 
f : E ^ R such that X coincides with the set of all points of discontinuity 
of f.
To prove (e) and (f), use an appropriate transfinite construction of Bernstein type.
2.24 Verify that:
(a) the topological product of a family of irresolvable spaces can be resolvable;
(b) a closed subspace of a resolvable space can be irresolvable;
(c) a bijective continuous image of a resolvable space is resolvable.

2.25 Let E be a topological space and let g : E ^ R be a real-valued non-negative 
upper semicontinuous function. Suppose that the graph of is a resolvable subspace 
of the product space E x R.
Check that there exists a function f : E ^ R such that О f = g.
In particular, if E is a resolvable space, then for any real-valued non-negative 
constant function g : E ^ R, there exists a function f : E ^ R such that О f = g.
2.26 
* Let E be a metric space and let g : E ^ R be a real-valued non-negative upper 
semicontinuous function.
Show that if the graph of g, considered as a subspace of E x R, does not contain 
isolated points, then there exists a Borel function f : E ^ R such that Оf = g.
For this purpose, use the following fact: if M is a nonempty metric space without 
isolated points, then M admits a partition into two everywhere dense subsets one of 
which is a-discrete and of type F<r.
2.27 Let E be an infinite set, let J be a <x-ideal of subsets of E, and let F = 
{X с E : E \ X e J} be the dual filter of J. Suppose that these two conditions are 
fulfilled:
(*) card(X) = card(E) for each set X e F;
(** ) there exists a base B of J with card(B) < card(E).
Defining T = {0} u F, prove that the topology T on E satisfies the following three 
properties:
(i) the space (E, T) is resolvable;
(ii) for a function g : E ^ {1}, there exists a function f : E ^ R satisfying 
0 f = g;
(iii) for the same function g : E ^ {1}, there exists no Borel function h : E ^ R 
satisfying Оh = g.
To prove (i), use some Bernstein type transfinite construction.
2.28 Take an infinite set E equipped with a nontrivial ш1 -complete ultrafilter Ф of 
subsets of E (this condition is equivalent to the existence of a two-valued measurable 
cardinal number). Equip E with the topology
T = {0}u Ф.
Check that the obtained topological space (E, T) is without isolated points and 
has the following property:
For any function f : E ^ R, there exists a set X e Ф such that the restriction 
f | X is constant.
Therefore, for every function f : E ^ R, there are points x in E such that f is 
continuous at x and, consequently, О f (x) = 0.
Deduce from the above that if g is a real-valued strictly positive constant function 
on (E, T), then there is no f : E ^ R such that О f = g.

2 The Oscillations of Real-Valued Functions
35
Remark 2.13 Let E be a topological space, (M, d) be a bounded metric space, and 
let f : E ^ M be a function. As was mentioned in the present chapter, for each 
point x e E, one can define
Оf (x) = inf{diam(f (U(x))) : U(x) e U(x)},
where U(x) is the filter of all neighborhoods of x and diam( f (U(x))) denotes the 
diameter of the set f (U(x)).
The obtained function О f : E ^ R is also called the oscillation of f. It is 
non-negative and upper semicontinuous.
A question analogous to the one considered in this chapter can be formulated in 
terms of the pair (E,M). Namely, one can ask to find a characterization of all those 
pairs (E, M) for which any non-negative upper semicontinuous function g : E ^ R 
admits a (Borel) function f : E ^ M such that О f = g.
This question seems tobe of interest from the viewpoint of mathematical analysis 
and general topology.

Real-Valued Functions
In this chapter we consider those restrictions of real-valued functions which have nice 
analytical properties, e.g., continuity or monotonicity. We prove the non-existence 
of restrictions of such a kind in concrete situations and show close connections of 
this topic with some classical examples of sets and functions in real analysis (Luzin 
sets, Sierpinski sets, continuous nowhere approximately differentiable functions, 
Sierpinski-Zygmund functions, etc.).
In various works devoted to the behavior of real-valued functions, the restrictions 
to certain subsets of their domains are often considered, taking into account that 
such restrictions may have much better descriptive properties in comparison with 
the properties of the original functions (see, for instance, [14, 19, 20, 69, 99, 151]).
We will present several results connected with restrictions of real-valued func­
tions, which have varying degrees of ‘good structure’ from the viewpoint of real 
analysis. Among these properties the continuity or monotonicity of an appropriate 
restriction will be of prime interest to us. On the other hand, some exotic (patho­
logical) functions will also be pointed out, for which no continuous or monotone 
restriction to a non-small subset of a base (ground) set can exist.
It is well known that the set D (f) of all discontinuity points of a monotone 
function f : R ^ R is always (at most) countable and, conversely, if X is an 
arbitrary countable subset of R, then there exists a monotone function g : R ^ R 
such that D () = X.
The latter fact enables one to construct many examples of a monotone function 
h : R ^ R whose D(h) is everywhere dense in R.
Also, it directly follows from the result stated above that any monotone function 
f : R ^ R is continuous at all points of a co-countable subset of R, so f turns out 
to be continuous on a large subset of R.
The analogous statement for an arbitrary partial monotone function f : R ^ R 
also holds true. In this more general case, the set D (f) is again at most countable, 
so f is continuous at all points of a co-countable subset of dom(f).
In view of this observation, it makes sense to consider a somewhat dual problem. 
Namely, given a continuous function f : R ^ R, one can ask whether f is monotone 
on a certain large subset of R. In general, the answer to this question is trivially

3 Monotone and Continuous Restrictions of Real-Valued Functions
negative. Indeed, if f : R ^ R is continuous but nowhere differentiable, then 
f cannot be monotone on a subset of R which is dense in some non-degenerate 
subinterval of R (indeed, it suffices to apply the classical Lebesgue theorem on 
the differentiability 2-almost everywhere of any monotone function). So the posed 
question should be replaced by its substantially weakened form. For instance, one 
may try to study the following variant of this question:
Does there exist a non-small subset of R on which f is monotone?
It is well known that, given a function with a nice descriptive structure, one can 
always obtain a monotone restriction of it to certain non-empty perfect subsets of R. 
For the sake of completeness, we give a proof of this result.
Theorem 3.1 Let f : R ^ R be a Lebesgue measurable function (or let f : R ^ R 
have the Baire property).
Then there exists a nonempty perfect set P c R such that the restriction f |P is 
monotone on P.
Proof The argument presented below is fairly standard and is usually applied in 
many similar situations (cf., for instance, [13]). First of all, there exists a nonempty 
perfect subset T of R such that the restriction f IT is continuous (this is true for all 
Lebesgue measurable functions f and for all those functions f which possess the 
Baire property). Of course, we may assume that diam(T) < 1, where the symbol 
diam(T) stands for the diameter of T. Let g = f |T and suppose that, for every 
nonempty perfect set c T, the restriction | is not decreasing. Then, by using 
ordinary induction, we can construct a dyadic system
(Tiii2...ik)fie{0,1 },i2e{0,1},...,^e{0,1} 
(к < Ш)
of nonempty perfect subsets of T satisfying the following five conditions:
(a) 
T0 = T;
(b) 
7i'ii2...ifcik+i c Tiii2...ik ;
(c) 
Tiii2...ik0 ^ Tiii2...ik 1 = 0;
(d) diam(7U..fe) < 1/2fc;
(e) if к < ы and (i1,i2,. ..,ik) < (j1, j2,..., j к), then we have x < у and g (x) < 
g(у) for all points x e Tf1,-2...ik and у e T,-1 j2...jk (here < denotes the standard 
lexicographical ordering in the set of all к -sequences whose terms belong to 
{0, 1}).
As soon as the above-mentioned dyadic system of sets is determined, we may put
P = p| (u{Tr-1 i2...ik : (t132, ...iк) e {0,1}к}). 
к<^
Clearly, P is a nonempty perfect subset of R and it follows from the construction of 
P that g | P = f | P is an increasing function on P.
This finishes the proof of Theorem 3.1.

3 Monotone and Continuous Restrictions of Real-Valued Functions

The natural question arises whether the preceding theorem admits further gen­
eralizations. In particular, one can ask whether it is possible to choose a nonempty 
perfect set P such that f \P is monotone and the inequality A(P) > 0 is fulfilled.
Let us show that the answer to the posed question is negative. For our purpose, 
we need the existence of a continuous function f : R ^ R which is nowhere 
approximately differentiable. Recall that this fact was first established by Jarnik in 
[67]. It is much deeper than the existence of a continuous nowhere differentiable 
function. In this context, we refer the reader to [149] where many useful facts about 
approximate derivatives of real-valued functions on R are presented.
Let us give the precise formulation of Jarnik’s result (see [67]).
Lemma 3.2 There exist continuous bounded functions acting from R into R which 
are nowhere approximately differentiable.
Remark 3.3 Actually, Jarnik proved that almost all (in the sense of Baire category) 
functions from the Banach space C [0,1] are nowhere approximately differentiable. 
This result significantly strengthens the earlier result of Banach and Mazurkiewicz 
for the usual differentiability (see [37, 111, 136]). Further investigations showed that 
analogous statements hold true for many other kinds of derivatives.
Lemma 3.4 There exists a continuous function f : R ^ R such that, for every 
closed set P c R with A (P) > 0, the restriction f | P is not monotone on P.
Proof Let f : R ^ R be a continuous, bounded and nowhere approximately differ­
entiable function (see Lemma 3.2 above). We are going to show that f is as required. 
Take any closed set P c R whose Lebesgue measure is strictly positive. We assert 
that f |P cannot be monotone. Suppose otherwise, i.e., f |P is either increasing or 
decreasing. Without loss of generality, we may assume that f |P is increasing. Denote 
by f * : R ^ R some increasing function extending f |P (the existence of f * is more 
or less obvious). According to the classical theorem of Lebesgue, f * is differentiable 
2-almost everywhere in R. Consequently, there exists an x e P such that x is a 
density point of P and f * is differentiable at x. By virtue of the relation
f *\P = f\P,
this immediately implies the fact that the original function f is approximately dif­
ferentiable at x. But the latter contradicts the definition of f.
The obtained contradiction completes the proof. 
□
Now, we are ready to establish the following theorem, which essentially strength­
ens Lemma 3.4.
Theorem 3.5 There exists a continuous function f : R ^ R such that, for every set 
X c R with A*(X) > 0, the restriction f |X is not monotone on X.
Proof Take the same continuous, bounded and nowhere approximately differentiable 
function f : R ^ R. Let X be any subset of R satisfying A*(X) > 0. We must 
show that the restriction f \X cannot be monotone. Suppose otherwise, i.e., f \X is 

40
3 Monotone and Continuous Restrictions of Real-Valued Functions
monotone. Denote by the closure of . Obviously, the set is Lebesgue measurable 
and, by virtue of the assumption A*(X) > 0, we immediately get A(Y) > 0. Since f 
is continuous, we conclude that f |Y is monotone, too, but this contradicts Lemma 
3.4.
Theorem 3.5 has thus been proved. 
□
In view of Theorems 3.1 and 3.5, it makes sense to introduce the following 
definitions.
Let f : R ^ R be a partial function and let L be a family of subsets of R.
We say that f is relatively monotone (relatively continuous) with respect to L if 
there exists at least one set X e L n P(dom(f)) for which the restriction f |X is 
monotone (continuous).
We say that f is absolutely non-monotone (absolutely discontinuous) with respect 
to L if f is not relatively monotone (relatively continuous) with respect to L, i.e., 
there exists no set X e Ln P(dom( f)) for which f | X is monotone (continuous).
According to this terminology, Theorem 3.1 states that every Lebesgue measur­
able function f : R ^ R (and every function f : R ^ R having the Baire property) 
is relatively monotone with respect to the family of all nonempty perfect subsets of 
R.
On the other hand, Theorem 3.5 states that there exists a continuous function 
f : R ^ R which is absolutely non-monotone with respect to the family of all 
subsets of R having strictly positive outer Lebesgue measure.
Let us give some other examples illustrating the introduced notions.
Example 3.6 Every function g : R ^ R is relatively monotone with respect to the 
class of all countably infinite subsets of R. This fact can easily be deduced from an 
infinite version of the well-known combinatorial theorem due to Ramsey and also 
admits a direct simple proof. Actually, if (E, and (F, are any two linearly 
ordered sets, E is infinite and ф : E ^ F is a mapping, then there exists an infinite 
set X c E for which the restriction ф | X is monotone. However, even in the case 
E = F = R, one cannot assert that among such sets X there is an everywhere dense 
subset of R.
Example 3.7 In view of the Lebesgue theorem on the differentiability 2-almost 
everywhere of monotone functions acting from R into itself, any continuous nowhere 
differentiable function f : R ^ R is absolutely non-monotone with respect to the 
family of all nonempty open intervals in R. Moreover, it is known that there exists 
an everywhere differentiable function h : R ^ R which is absolutely non-monotone 
with respect to the same family of intervals (see, e.g., [73, 99]).
Example 3.8 Every function ф : R ^ R is relatively continuous with respect to 
the family of all countable everywhere dense subsets of R. This classical result 
is due to Blumberg [14]. It inspired many other restriction theorems in real anal­
ysis and general topology (cf. [19, 20, 69]). In some sense, the above-mentioned 
result cannot be strengthened. Indeed, it immediately follows from the definition 

3 Monotone and Continuous Restrictions of Real-Valued Functions
41
of Sierpinski-Zygmund functions that every Sierpinski-Zygmund function is abso­
lutely discontinuous (hence absolutely non-monotone) with respect to the family of 
all those subsets of R whose cardinalities are equal to c. So, under the Continuum Hy­
pothesis (CH), any Sierpinski-Zygmund function is absolutely discontinuous (hence 
absolutely non-monotone) with respect to the class of all uncountable subsets of R.
By definition, a topological space is a Blumberg space (or has Blumberg’s 
property) if, for any function f : E ^ R, there exists an everywhere dense subset D 
of E such that the restriction f | D is continuous. According to [14], the real line R isa 
Blumberg space. It can easily be checked that any Blumberg space is simultaneously 
a Baire space. The converse assertion does not hold (cf. Exercise 3.17). However, 
J. C. Bradford and C. Goffman were able to prove that a metrizable Baire space 
always possesses Blumberg’s property (for more details about Blumberg spaces, see 
[19, 20, 69]).
In the classical construction of Sierpinski and Zygmund [156], their function f is 
defined by the method of transfinite recursion in such a manner that the graph of f 
almost avoids the graphs of all real-valued continuous functions whose domains are 
uncountable Gs-subsets of R (this construction is an ingenious variant of Cantor’s 
celebrated diagonal argument).
Actually, the Sierpinski-Zygmund construction admits a significant generalization 
to the case when a certain family of topologies on R is given instead of the single 
Euclidean topology of R.
Remark 3.9 As shown by Roslanowski and Shelah [147], there are models of set 
theory in which the following phenomenon occurs:
For any function f acting from R into R, there exists a set X c R such that 
Л*(X) > 0 and the restriction f |X is continuous.
A similar result was proved by Shelah [151] in terms of Baire category.
In the sequel, we will need the notion of a Luzin subset of R and the dual notion 
of a Sierpinski subset of R.
Recall that L c R is a Luzin set if L is uncountable and, for every first category 
set X c R, the relation card(X n L) < ы holds true.
Recall also that 5 c R is a Sierpinski set if 5 is uncountable and, for every 
2-measure zero set X c R, the relation card( X n 5) < ы holds true.
It is well known that the Continuum Hypothesis implies the existence of Luzin 
and Sierpinski subsets ofR (see, for instance, [7, 29, 99, 107, 111, 119, 129, 136]).
In connection with Example 3.8, the following theorem seems to be of interest.
Theorem 3.10 Assuming the Continuum Hypothesis, there exists a function g : R ^ 
R which is not a Sierpinski-Zygmund function, but is absolutely non-monotone with 
respect to the family of all uncountable subsets ofR.

42
3 Monotone and Continuous Restrictions of Real-Valued Functions
g (x) = I
Proof Take an arbitrary continuous nowhere differentiable function
gi : R ^ R
and an arbitrary Sierpinski-Zygmund function g2 : R ^ R. Let L be a Luzin subset 
of R. Define the function g : R ^ R as follows:
gi (x) if x e L
g2(x) if x e R \ L.
Let us check that this g is as required.
First of all, g is not a Sierpinski-Zygmund function, because the restriction 
g|L = g11L is continuous. Let now X be an uncountable subset of R. Only two cases 
are possible.
1. card(X П L) < ш.
In this case we obviously have the inequality
card(X П (R \ L)') > ы.
Since g2 is a Sierpinski-Zygmund function, the restriction
g|(X П (R \ L)) = g2|(X П (R \ L))
is not monotone, whence it follows that g|X is not monotone.
2. card(X П L) > ш.
In this case suppose for now that the restriction
g|(X П L) = gi|(X П L)
is monotone. Then the continuous function gi should be monotone on the closure of 
X П L. Further, since g1 is nowhere differentiable, the set cl(X П L) is necessarily 
nowhere dense in R. Taking into account the fact that L is a Luzin set, the nowhere 
density of cl(X П L) implies the inequality
card(L П cl(X П L)') < u,
which contradicts the relations
X П L c cl(X П L) П L, 
card(X П L) > ш.
The obtained contradiction completes the proof. 
□
Let f be an arbitrary partial function acting from R into itself.
We say that f is countably continuous if dom( f) can be represented in the form
dom( f) = U{Xn : n < ш}, 

3 Monotone and Continuous Restrictions of Real-Valued Functions
43
where all restrictions f |Xn (n < щ) are continuous.
In connection with this definition, it should be mentioned that there are semicon- 
tinuous functions acting from R into R which are not countably continuous (see, for 
instance, [1]).
We say that f is countably monotone if dom( f) can be represented in the form
dom( f) = U{Yn : n < ш},
where all restrictions f |Y„ (n < w) are monotone.
Example 3.11 It is easy to check that every countably monotone partial function 
f : R ^ R is also countably continuous. On the other hand, let g : R ^ R be an 
arbitrary continuous nowhere differentiable function. Then it is not difficult to verify 
that g is not countably monotone.
The characteristic function of any subset of R is countably monotone (hence 
countably continuous). This shows us that there exist many countably monotone 
functions which are not Lebesgue measurable and do not possess the Baire property.
Example 3.12 A Sierpinski-Zygmund function is not countably continuous and, 
therefore, is not countably monotone.
In order to present some further results about absolutely non-monotone functions, 
let us recall two important notions.
We say that a set X c R is categorically thick in R if, for every second category 
set Y c R possessing the Baire property, we have X n Y + 0.
We say that a set X c R is A-thick in R if, for every set Y e dom(2) with A(Y) > 0, 
we have X n Y + 0.
Evidently, a set X c R is 2-thick in R if and only if
2.(R \ X) = 0.
Theorem 3.1 implies that every continuous function / : R ^ R is monotone on 
some set of cardinality continuum.
At the same time, the following theorem holds.
Theorem 3.13 Under the Continuum Hypothesis, there exists a partial function 
f : R ^ R such that:
(1) dom( f) is categorically thick in R;
(2) f is a restriction of some continuous function acting from R into itself;
(3) f is absolutely non-monotone with respect to the family of all uncountable subsets 
of R (consequently, f is not countably monotone).
Proof Let L be a Luzin subset of R categorically thick in R. The existence of such 
a subset can be obtained by a slight modification of the standard Luzin construction 
(cf. [29,99]). Let g : R ^ R be a continuous nowhere differentiable function and let 
f = g|L. We assert that f is the required function. Indeed, take any uncountable set 
X c dom( f) = L and suppose that f |X is monotone. Only two cases are possible.

44
3 Monotone and Continuous Restrictions of Real-Valued Functions
(a) 
is of first category in R.
Then, by virtue of the definition of L, we must have
ы > card(X П L) = card(X) > ы,
which yields a contradiction. We thus conclude that this case is impossible.
(b) 
X is of second category in R.
Let Y denote the closure of X. Since g|X = f |X is monotone and g is continuous, 
we get that | is also monotone. Further, is a second category closed set in R, 
whence it follows that Y contains a nonempty open subinterval of R on which the 
function g must be monotone, too. But this contradicts the definition of g .
Theorem 3.13 has thus been proved. 
□
Remark 3.14 Condition (2) in the formulation of Theorem 3.13 can be strengthened 
to the following condition:
(2') f is a restriction of some everywhere differentiable function acting from R into 
itself.
Indeed, in the proof of Theorem 3.13 we could start with an everywhere differentiable 
function g : R ^ R which is absolutely non-monotone with respect to the family of 
all nonempty open intervals in R (cf. Example 3.7).
By utilizing a similar argument, one can obtain the following dual statement.
Theorem 3.15 Under the Continuum Hypothesis, there exists a partial function 
f : R ^ R such that:
(1) dom( f) is Л-thick in R;
(2) f is a restriction of some continuous function acting from R into itself;
(3) f is absolutely non-monotone with respect to the family of all uncountable subsets 
of R (consequently, f is not countably monotone).
Proof The argument is analogous to the proof of Theorem 3.13. Let 5 be a Л- 
thick Sierpinski subset of R. The existence of such a subset can be obtained by a 
slight modification of the standard Sierpinski construction (cf. again [29, 99]). Let 
g : R ^ R be a continuous nowhere approximately differentiable function. Let us 
put f = g15. Then f trivially satisfies conditions (1), (2) and, similarly to the proof 
of Theorem 3.13, we obtain that f satisfies condition (3) as well. 
□
Let f : R ^ R be a partial function. Consider the set C (f) of all continuity 
points of f and the set D (f) of all discontinuity points of f. The first of them is 
always of type G s in dom( f) and the second one is always of type F,r in dom( f).
Conversely, if a set Z c R is of type F,r in R, then Z = D (f) for some function 
f : R ^ R (see, e.g., [136]).

3 Monotone and Continuous Restrictions of Real-Valued Functions
45
We have already mentioned that there are extremely discontinuous functions 
acting from R into R. Among them, Sierpinski-Zygmund functions are of special 
interest and quite often are applied in constructions of various counterexamples 
(cf. the proof of Theorem 3.10).
However, given any partial function f : R ^ R with
card(dom( f)) > ы,
one may assert that there is a restriction of / such that the set of all continuity points 
of this restriction is infinite. To formulate a more precise result in this direction, we 
need the following notion.
Let / : R ^ R be a partial function with card(dom(/)) > ы.
We shall say that x e dom(/) is a strong continuity point for f if x is a conden­
sation point of dom( f) and f is continuous at x.
The set of all strong continuity points for f will be denoted by C0 (f).
Theorem 3.16 Let f : R ^ R be a partial function whose domain is uncountable.
Then there exists an uncountable set X contained in dom(f) and such that 
card(Co(f |X)) > ш.
The proof of this theorem is not difficult and is omitted here. We only offer to the 
reader the hint that, in the process of proving Theorem 3.16, he/she should take into 
account the fact that the graph of / is an uncountable subset of the plane R2, hence 
this graph contains uncountably many condensation points of itself.
Remark 3.17 It is not hard to see that Theorem 3.16 can be extended to more general 
situations, for example, to the case of a partial function g : E ^ F, where E and F 
are two separable metric spaces and dom() is uncountable.
The existence of Sierpinski-Zygmund functions shows us that, under the Contin­
uum Hypothesis, the inequality in Theorem 3.16 cannot be replaced by the stronger 
inequality
card(Co(f |X)) > ш.
In this context, the next simple example is also relevant.
Example 3.18 Let {qn : n < ш} be an injective enumeration of all rational numbers. 
Define a function f : Q ^ R by putting
f (qn) = n 
(n < ш).
Let X be an infinite subset of Q. It is easy to verify that if x e C (f |X), then x is 
an isolated point of X. In other words, one can assert that no restriction of f to any 
infinite subset X of dom( f) can be continuous at an accumulation point of X.
Many interesting results concerning the restrictions of real-valued functions on R 
to various kinds of non-small subsets of R can be found in [14, 19, 20, 69, 99, 147, 
151].

Argue by using the method of transfinite induction. Let {f g : с < ш\} be an 
injective enumeration of all functions from F.
Suppose that for an ordinal number ^ < m1, the two families
{x с,п : F F < и). {у 
: ^<i^ <%}
of points of R are defined in such a way that for ^ < £ < £,
Уe ft (W)\ fn(W)
holds, where
W = {x£,n : £ < %,n < u}.
Further, let
W' = {у

and put
U = U{ft (W) : < < £},
V = (U{ft1 (U) : { < £}) U (u{ft1 (W') : < < £}).
Observe that the sets U and W' are countable and the set V is of first category in R. 
Then represent the family {Д : £ < £} in the form of an w-sequence {gn : n < ш} 
and construct by ordinary recursion an injective w-sequence {xg,n : n < ш} of 
points in R satisfying the following properties:
(a) 
xg,n t V for all n < m;
(b) ff (x£,n) ^ gn(x£,m) for all n < w and m < w.
Define an appropriate family {ул,% : ^ < f} of points in R.
Finally, put
X = {xg,n : £ < ш1, n < ш}
and verify that X is a magic set for the family F.
Obtain the same result under Martin’s Axiom (instead of the Continuum Hypoth­
esis).
Remark 3.19 A similar statement on the existence of a magic set, for the family of 
all those real-valued Л-measurable functions which are not constant on subsets of R 
of strictly positive Л-measure, can be found in [21]. In connection with Exercise 3.9, 
the result of Ciesielski and Shelah should also be mentioned, which states that there 
exists a model of ZFC theory where there are no magic sets for the family F (see 
[26]).

* Assuming Martin’s Axiom, prove that there exists a partial continuous function 
f : R ^ R satisfying the following two conditions:
(a) the set dom( f) is Л-thick in R;

For this purpose, consider a suitable restriction of a real-valued continuous nowhere 
approximately differentiable function on R.

3 Monotone and Continuous Restrictions of Real-Valued Functions
3.11 Let (E, <) be an infinite, Dedekind complete, dense, linearly ordered set en­
dowed with its order topology and let f : E ^ R be a function having the Baire 
property.
Formulate and prove for f the analog of Theorem 3.1.
Apply the obtained result to the special case where (E, <) is a Suslin line or the 
long line of Alexandrov.
3.12 
* Let (5, <) be a Suslin line and let p be the completion of a ^-finite Borel 
measure on 5.
Verify that if f : 5 ^ R is any p-measurable function, then there exists a 
nonempty perfect set P c S such that the function f | P is monotone.
For this purpose, use the fact that there exists a closed separable set F c S such 
that p (5 \ F) = 0 (in other words, p has a separable support).
The proof of the above-mentioned fact is given in Exercise 4.18.
3.13 
* Let (S, <) be again a Suslin line.
Show that there exists at least one Sierpinski-Zygmund type function h : 5 ^ R 
(i.e., h is such that h |X is discontinuous for each subset X of 5 with card(X) = c).
For this purpose, take into account that the cardinality of the Borel ^-algebra of 5 
is equal to c and apply to 5 Lavrentiev’s theorem on extensions of partial real-valued 
continuous functions.
Assuming the Continuum Hypothesis, infer from the above result that no restric­
tion of h to an everywhere dense subset of 5 is continuous (consequently, 5 is not a 
Blumberg topological space).
Remark 3.20 The fact that a Suslin line is not a Blumberg space can be proved 
within ZFC set theory (see [35, 36]).
3.14 Check that any uncountable subset of the real line R (of a Suslin line 5) contains 
a strictly decreasing infinite sequence of its elements.
Using this fact, show that if a function f : R ^ R is such that, for every nonempty 
countable set X c R, the restricted function f |X attains its infimum on X, then the 
range of f is a countable well-ordered subset of R.
Formulate and prove the analogous result for 5.
Remark 3.21 We do not know whether there exists a model of ZFC theory in which 
the class of all absolutely non-monotone functions acting from R into itself (with 
respect to the subsets of R of cardinality continuum) coincides with the class of all 
Sierpinski-Zygmund functions acting from R into itself.
3.15 Let Ts denote Sorgenfrey’s topology on R.
Show that (R, Ts) is a Blumberg space.
3.16 Let b be an infinite cardinal number.
Recall that a topological space E is b-Lindelof if every open covering of E 
contains a subcovering whose cardinality is strictly less than b.
For example, if b = w, then b-Lindelof spaces are precisely quasi-compact spaces; 
if b = ы1, then b-Lindelof spaces are precisely Lindelof spaces in the usual sense.

A topological space is called b-Baire if no nonempty open subset of can be 
represented as the union of a family of nowhere dense sets in , whose cardinality 
is strictly less than b.
For example, if b = ш1, then b-Baire spaces are precisely Baire spaces in the 
usual sense.
Recall that a topological space is isodyne if card() = card() for any 
nonempty open subset of .
Suppose that b be an infinite regular cardinal and let (,T) be a hereditarily 
b-Lindelof topological space with card(E) = b.
Verify that the family of sets
T* = {U \ D : U is open, D c E, card(D) < b}
is a topology on E extending T and (E, T*) is also a hereditarily b-Lindelof space.
In addition, if (E, T) is a b-Baire 1-space without isolated points (respectively, 
an isodyne b-Baire space), then (E, T*) is also a b-Baire space without isolated 
points (respectively, an isodyne b-Baire space).
3.17 Let (E, T) be an uncountable isodyne Polish space. If c is a regular cardinal, 
then one may consider the topology T* described in Exercise
.
 3.16
Assuming Martin’s Axiom, prove that the isodyne c-Lindelof c-Baire space 
(E , T*) is not a Blumberg space.
Under the same axiom, show that there exists a generalized Luzin set in (E, T) 
which is a Blumberg space.

Chapter 4
Bijective Continuous Images of Absolute Null 
Sets
In modern mathematics there are various notions of so-called small sets (small 
spaces). In classical real analysis, Lebesgue measure theory, and general topology 
typical examples of such spaces are Luzin subsets and Sierpinski subsets of the real 
line R (see, e.g., [29, 99, 111, 126, 129, 136]).
Here we would like to discuss a concept of ‘small space’ which is motivated by 
topological measure theory.
All topological spaces E considered below are assumed to have the following 
natural property:
for any point x e E, the singleton {x} is a Borel set in E.
In particular, every 1 -space (hence every Hausdorff space) possesses this prop­
erty.
Recall that a measure ^ defined on some ^-algebra S of subsets of a topological 
space E is said to be diffuse (or continuous) if {x} e S and ^({x}) = 0 for each 
point x e E.
A topological space E is said to be an absolute null space (or universal measure 
zero space) if every Borel ^-finite diffuse measure on E is identically equal to zero.
Example 4.1 Every Luzin subset of R (and, under Martin’s Axiom, every generalized 
Luzin subset of R) is an absolute null space. Also, without assuming additional set- 
theoretical hypotheses, there exist uncountable absolute null subspaces of R (see, 
for instance, [56, 111, 119, 126, 173]). Moreover, any nonempty perfect subset ofR 
contains an uncountable absolute null space.
Example 4.2 Let E be an infinite set equipped with the discrete topology and let E* 
denote Alexandrov’s one-point compactification of E.
Then these two assertions are equivalent:
(a) E* is an absolute null space;
(b) the cardinal number card(E*) is nonmeasurable in the Ulam sense (i.e., is not 
real-valued measurable).
We thus see that there exist compact absolute null spaces whose cardinalities are as 
large as possible within ZFC set theory.

4 Bijective Continuous Images of Absolute Null Sets
Some other examples of non-discrete Hausdorff absolute null spaces with suffi­
ciently large cardinalities can be found in [141].
It readily follows from the definition of absolute null spaces that:
(i) the topological product of finitely many absolute null spaces is also an absolute 
null space;
(ii) if E is a topological space, E ' is an absolute null space, and
ф : E ^ E'
is a Borel mapping such that ф- (у) is at most countable for each point у e E', 
then E is an absolute null space (in particular, any subspace of an absolute null 
space is also an absolute null space);
(iii) if {E j : j e J} is a family of absolute null spaces such that the cardinal number 
card( J) is nonmeasurable in the Ulam sense, then the topological sum of this 
family is an absolute null space;
(iv) if {Ek : k e К} is a countable family of absolute null subspaces of a topological 
space E, then u{Ek : k e К} is also an absolute null subspace of E;
(v) if X is a Hausdorff absolute null space and Y is a Radon space, then the 
topological product X x Y is a Radon space;
(vi) every absolute null subspace of R is zero-dimensional.
In connection with (i), let us remark that the topological product of countably many 
absolute null spaces is not, in general, an absolute null space.
One can readily deduce from (ii) that if X is an absolute null space and ф : X ^ Y 
is a Borel isomorphism, then Y is an absolute null space. In particular, the class of 
absolute null spaces is closed under the operation of taking homeomorphic images.
Example 4.3 If X is a Luzin subset of R and Y c R is a homeomorphic image of X, 
then one cannot assert that Y is a Luzin set. Moreover, such a Y can be a nowhere 
dense subset of R. Analogously, if X' is a Sierpinski subset of R and Y' c R is 
a homeomorphic image of X', then one cannot assert that Y' is a Sierpinski set. 
Moreover, such a Y' can be a 2-measure zero subset of R, where A stands for the 
ordinary Lebesgue measure on R. The assertions just formulated follow from the 
fact that Cantor’s set on R contains a topological copy of the canonical Baire space 
NN and the latter space is homeomorphic to the set of all irrational numbers in R.
On the other hand, it is easy to see that if g : R ^ R is a bijection such that both 
g and g-1 preserve the <r-ideal of all first category sets in R, then g transforms the 
class of all Luzin subsets of R onto itself. Similarly to this fact, if f : R ^ R is a 
bijection such that both f and f-1 preserve the <r-ideal of all 2-measure zero sets, 
then f transforms the class of all Sierpinski subsets of R onto itself.
Example 4.4 If X is a Luzin set and g : X ^ R is a mapping having the Baire 
property, then g (X) is an absolute null space and hence g (X) is totally imperfect as 
well. Analogously, if Y is a Sierpinski set and a mapping f : Y ^ R is measurable 
with respect to the measure on Y induced by A, then f (Y) does not contain any 
uncountable absolute null space and hence f (Y) is totally imperfect as well.

Theorem 4.5 Let E be a compact absolute null space, E ’ be a Hausdorff space, and 
let ф : E ^ E' be a mapping such that the ф-pre-image of any open subset of E ' is 
of type G s in E (or, equivalently, the ф-pre-image of any closed subset of E ' is of 
type Frr in E).
Then either ф(E) is an absolute null space or ф(E) is not a Radon space.
Proof We may assume, without loss of generality that ф is a surjection, i.e., E' = 
ф(E). If E ' is an absolute null space, then there is nothing to prove. Suppose now that 
E' is not an absolute null space, so there exists a Borel probability diffuse measure 
^ on E '. If this ^ is not a Radon measure, then E' is not a Radon space, and we are 
done. So, it remains to consider the case when is a Radon measure. In this case, 
let us put
S = {ф—(Y) : Y eB(E')}.
The introduced class S of subsets of E is a ^-subalgebra of the Borel ^-algebra 
B( E), and we can define a probability measure v on S by putting
v(ф—1 (Y)) = ц(Y) 
(Y eB(E')).
Let us check that this v is a Radon probability measure on S . For this purpose, take 
any set Y e B(E'). Since ^ is a Radon measure, we may write
Д(Y) = sup{д(K7-) : j e J},
where J is a countable set of indices and, for each j e J, the set Kj c Y is compact. 
It follows from the above equality that
v(ф—1 (Y)) = sup{v(ф—1 (Kj)) : j e J},
where all sets ф—1 (Kj) (j e J) are of type F,r in E, all of them belong to S and are 
contained in ф—1 (Y). Taking into account the compactness of E and the assumption 
on ф, all sets ф—1 (Kj) (j e J) are ^-compact in E. This directly implies that v is a 
Radon measure on S .
Now, according to Henry’s well-known theorem (see Exercise 4.6), there exists a 
Radon probability measure v' extending v and defined on the entire Borel <x-algebra 
B(E). Clearly, the measure v' is diffuse. So we come to a contradiction with the fact 
that E is an absolute null space.
The obtained contradiction finishes the proof.

Example 4.6 Let E = X U {x} be Alexandrov’s one-point compactification of a 
discrete topological space X of cardinality w1, where x ф X, and let the closed 
interval E ’ = [0, w1] of ordinal numbers be equipped with its order topology. As is 
known, E’ carries a Borel probability diffuse measure v (the so-called Dieudonne 
measure) and this v is not Radon. Also, by virtue of Ulam’s classical theorem (see 
[168]), E is an absolute null space. Consider a mapping ф : E ^ E’ such that 
ф(x) = ш1 and the restriction ф|X is a bijection between X and [0, ш1 [. Then ф 
satisfies the assumption of Theorem 4.5 and the space E’ = ф(E) is not Radon.

4 Bijective Continuous Images of Absolute Null Sets
Remark 4.7 Theorem 4.5 and Example 4.6 show us that the images of absolute null 
spaces may lack natural measure-theoretical regularity properties even under nice 
mappings from the topological viewpoint.
In what follows, we are going to demonstrate that, similarly to Remark 4.7 made 
above, among the bijective continuous images of absolute null subspaces of R, 
one may encounter sets which possess very bad properties from the standpoint 
of topological measure theory. For this purpose, we need the notion of absolutely 
nonmeasurable sets.
Let E be a base (ground) set and let M be a class of measures on E (in general, 
the domains of measures from M are diverse ^-algebras of subsets of E).
We say that a function f : E ^ R is absolutely nonmeasurable with respect to 
M if there exists no measure ^ e M such that f is ^-measurable.
Accordingly, we say that a set Z с E is absolutely nonmeasurable with respect to 
M if the characteristic function xz of Z is absolutely nonmeasurable with respect 
to M .
Example 4.8 Any Bernstein subset of R is absolutely nonmeasurable with respect 
to the class of completions of all nonzero <x-finite diffuse Borel measures on R. 
Moreover, it can be proved that there exists a Bernstein set in R which is abso­
lutely nonmeasurable with respect to the class of all nonzero ^-finite translation- 
quasi-invariant measures on R (see [97]). Many other interesting and extraordinary 
properties of Bernstein sets are considered in [9, 99, 111, 126, 129, 136].
To proceed, we need four auxiliary lemmas. The first of them is due to Erdos, 
Kunen, and Mauldin [40].
Lemma 4.9 Under Martin’s Axiom, there exist two generalized Luzin sets 1 and 
2 satisfying the following two conditions:
(1) both 1 and 2 are vector spaces over the field Q of all rational numbers;
(2) the real line R considered as a vector space over Q is a direct sum of 1 and 2.
The proof of Lemma 4.9 may be found in [40] (see also Exercises 4.8 and 4.9).
The next lemma demonstrates a certain connection between Hamel bases of R 
and generalized Luzin subsets of R.
Lemma 4.10 Under Martin’s Axiom, there exists a Hamel basis of R which simul­
taneously is a generalized Luzin set.
Proof We follow the original idea of Sierpinski [153]. Let L1 and L2 be as in Lemma 
4.9. Then the set L = L1 U L2 is a generalized Luzin set in R. Consider a maximal 
(with respect to the inclusion relation) linearly independent (over Q) subset of L. 
The existence of H immediately follows from the widely known Kuratowski-Zorn 
lemma. We assert that is a Hamel basis of R. Suppose otherwise, i.e., there is an 
element x e R such that x £ linQ(H). Since R is a direct sum of L1 and L2, we may 
write x = 11 +12 for some elements 11 e L1 and 12 e L2.

55
Since x £ linQ (H), we have either 11 <f. linQ (H) or 12 <f. linQ (H). We may assume, 
without loss of generality, that /1 £ linQ(H). Then the set {/1} U H is linearly 
independent over Q, is contained in and properly contains H. But this contradicts 
the maximality of H.
The obtained contradiction completes the proof. 
□
Lemma 4.11 Assume Martin’s Axiom and let E be a separable metric space 
equipped with the completion of some nonzero a -finite diffuse Borel measure on 
E.
Then there exists a set A с E such that card( A) = c and no subset of A having 
the same cardinality c is an absolute null space.
Proof The argument is very similar to the classical Sierpinski construction produc­
ing Sierpinski subsets of R (cf. [99,111,136]), so we omit it here (see Exercise 4.10 
for more details). 
□
Lemma 4.12 Assume Martin’s Axiom and let E be an arbitrary metric space whose 
cardinality does not exceed c.
Then there exists a subset В of E which is absolutely nonmeasurable with respect 
to the class M of the completions of all nonzero a -finite diffuse Borel measures on 
E.
Proof If E is an absolute null space, then there is nothing to prove. So, we may 
suppose that M + 0. In this case, the cardinality of E is equal to c, and all subsets 
of E whose cardinalities are strictly less than c are absolute null subspaces of E. 
Now, we may apply Bernstein’s classical transfinite construction (cf. [111]) to the 
family of all closed separable subsets of E having cardinality c. By virtue of this 
construction, there exists a set В с E such that, for any closed separable subset E of 
E with card( E) = c, the equalities
card(E П В) = card(E П (E \ В)) = c
are fulfilled. Then it is not difficult to show that the set В is absolutely nonmeasurable 
with respect to the class M .
Lemma 4.12 has thus been proved. 
□
Remark 4.13 Let us underline that in the above proof the completeness of E is not 
needed at all. However, in the literature the existence of Bernstein sets is usually 
established for an uncountable Polish topological space E and, in particular, for R 
(see, e.g., [111, 136]).
Theorem 4.14 Under Martin’s Axiom, there exist an absolute null subspace ofR 
with card(Z) = c and a continuous injection ф : Z ^ R such that no subset of ф(Z) 
having cardinality c is absolute null.
Proof Let 1 and 2 be as in Lemma 4.9, i.e., both 1 and 2 are generalized Luzin 
sets, are also vector spaces over the field Q, and the real line R considered as a

56
4 Bijective Continuous Images of Absolute Null Sets
vector space over Q is a direct sum of 1 and 2 . Let us introduce the product set 
L = L1 x L2 c R2 and define a mapping ф : L > R by the formula
Ф(Z) = РГ1 (z) + pr2 (Z) (Z € Li x L2).
According to (i), the product set L is an absolute null subspace of R2 . Moreover, L, 
being the product of two zero-dimensional spaces, is a zero-dimensional subspace 
of R2 (see (vi)). Since R is a direct sum of L1 and L2, the additive mapping ф is 
a continuous bijection of L onto R. Keeping in mind that R is equipped with the 
nonzero <r-finite diffuse Lebesgue measure 2, we may apply Lemma 4.11 to E = R. 
Consequently, there exists a set A c R with card(A) = c such that no subset of A 
having the same cardinality c is an absolute null space. Actually, the role of A can 
be played by a generalized Sierpinski subset of R.
Now, put Z = ф-1 (A) and observe that card(Z) = c. The set Z, being a subset of 
L , is a zero-dimensional subspace of R2 . Finally, identifying with its topological 
copy in R, we obtain the required result. 
□
In a similar manner, we are able to prove the following theorem.
Theorem 4.15 Under Martin’s Axiom, there exist an absolute null subset of R 
with card(Y) = c and a continuous injection ф : Y > R such that the set ф(Y) is 
absolutely nonmeasurable with respect to the class of the completions of all nonzero 
a -finite diffuse Borel measures on R.
Proof The argument is analogous to the previous one. We preserve the notation of 
the proof of Theorem 4.14. Let L and ф be as earlier. According to Lemma 4.12, 
there exists a set c R absolutely nonmeasurable with respect to the class of the 
completions of all nonzero <r-finite diffuse Borel measures on R (actually, В is a 
Bernstein subset of R). Let us put Y = ф-1 (В). Then card(Y) = c and Y c L is a 
zero-dimensional absolute null subspace of R2 . Identifying Y with its topological 
copy in R, we obtain the required result. 
□
Remark 4.16 As is known, the existence of an absolute null subspace of R of 
cardinality c cannot be proved within the framework of ZFC set theory. Moreover, 
there is a model of ZFC in which 1 < c and the cardinalities of all absolute null 
subspaces of R do not exceed 1 (see, e.g., [116, 126], and references therein). 
Therefore, additional set-theoretical assumptions are necessary in the formulations 
of Theorems 4.14 and 4.15.
Remark 4.17 Equip the segment [0, 1] of ordinal numbers with its usual order 
topology. Working in ZFC set theory, it is not difficult to show that there exists a 
function
f : [0,^1 ] > |0,1}
which is absolutely nonmeasurable with respect to the class of the completions of 
all nonzero ^-finite diffuse Borel measures on [0, w1].
On the other hand, the same result is not provable in ZF & DC & AD theory, 
where DC denotes the Axiom of Dependent Choice and AD denotes the Axiom of

4 Bijective Continuous Images of Absolute Null Sets
57
Determinacy (see [68]). There exists a model of this theory in which all subsets of 
[0, w1] turn out to be measurable with respect to the completion of Dieudonne’s 
measure on [0, 1] .

4.2 Verify the validity of the following six assertions:
(i) the topological product of finitely many absolute null spaces is also an absolute 
null space;
(ii) if E is a topological space, E ' is an absolute null space, and
ф : E ^ E'
is a Borel mapping such that ф- (у) is at most countable for each point у e E', 
then E is an absolute null space (in particular, any subspace of an absolute null 
space is also an absolute null space);
(iii) if {Ej : j e J} is a family of absolute null spaces such that the cardinal number 
card(J) is nonmeasurable in the Ulam sense, then the topological sum of this 
family is an absolute null space;
(iv) if {Ek : к e К} is a countable family of absolute null subspaces of E, then 
u{Ek : к e К} is also an absolute null subspace of E;
(v) if X is a Hausdorff absolute null space and Y is a Radon space, then the 
topological product X x Y is a Radon space;
(vi) every absolute null subspace of R is zero-dimensional.
4.3 Give an example of a countable family of absolute null spaces whose topological 
product is not an absolute null space.
For this purpose, consider countably many spaces homeomorphic to the two- 
element discrete space {0, 1}.
4.4 Prove that if E is an absolute null space and ф : E ^ E' is a Borel isomorphism, 
then E' is an absolute null space.
Conclude from this fact that the class of absolute null spaces is closed under the 
operation of taking homeomorphic images.
4.5 Let E be an uncountable Polish topological space.
Show that if X is a Luzin set in E and / : X ^ R is a mapping having the Baire 
property, then /(X) is an absolute null space (hence /(X) is totally imperfect as 
well).
Analogously, show that if Y is a Sierpinski set in E with respect to the completion 
^ of some nonzero ^-finite diffuse Borel measure on E and a mapping g : Y ^ R 
is measurable with respect to the measure on Y induced by , then (Y) does not 
contain an uncountable absolute null space (hence g (Y) is totally imperfect as well).

* Prove Henry’s theorem stating that every ^-finite Radon measure v on a Haus- 
dorff topological space E can be extended to a measure v' on E which also is Radon 
and contains in its domain the family of all Borel subsets of E.
Argue as follows. First of all, reduce the argument to the case where a Radon 
probability measure v is given on E. Then consider the family of all finitely additive 
non-negative functionals ^ which are defined on algebras of subsets of E, possess 
the Radon property, and extend v. Verify that:
(a) this family has a maximal element v' with respect to the inclusion relation;
(b) v' is a Radon probability measure on E;
(c) all closed subsets of E belong to dom(v'), so all Borel subsets of E belong to 
dom(v').
To prove (a), use the Kuratowski-Zorn lemma.
To establish (b), use A. D. Alexandrov’s well-known theorem stating that every 
^-finite finitely additive Radon measure is countably additive.
To establish (c), assume that some closed set F с E does not belong to dom(v') 
and extend v' to a Radon probability measure v" such that
F e dom(v").
This leads to a contradiction with the maximality of v', so yields the required result.

* Under Martin’s Axiom (MA), demonstrate that there exist two generalized Luzin 
sets 1 and 2 in R such that:
(1) both 1 and 2 are vector spaces over Q;
(2) R = 1 + 2;
(3) card(L1 П L2) = c.
Argue as follows. As usual, identify c with the least ordinal number having the same 
cardinality (recall that in contemporary set theory such an identification is implied 
by von Neumann’s definition of infinite cardinal numbers; cf. [68, 108, 113]).
Let {tg : £ < c} be a transfinite sequence consisting of all points of R and let 
{F^ : £ < c} be a transfinite sequence consisting of all nowhere dense closed subsets 
of R. Construct three c-sequences
{X^ : £< c}, {Y^ : £< c}, {Z^ : £< c}
satisfying these five conditions:
(a) if £ < £ < c, then X% с Xg, Y^ с Y^, and Z^ с Z;
(b) for every ordinal £ < c, the sets X%, Y^, and Z^ are vector subspaces of R over 
Q;
(c) for every ordinal < c, one has the inequalities
card(X%) < card(^) + ш, card(Y^) < card(^) + ш, card(Z^) < card(£) + ш;

4 Bijective Continuous Images of Absolute Null Sets
59
(d) if £ < £ < c, then
(X € + Y^) П F€ = (X£ + Y£) П F€,
(Y^ + Zg) П F^ = (Y^ + Zg) П F^;
(e) 
t ^ e X^ + Yg + Zg.
To obtain the required three c-sequences, use the method of transfinite recursion.
First of all, put Xq = Y0 = Z0 = {0}.
Further, suppose that, for an ordinal £ < c, the partial £-sequences
{Хл : л<£}, ih, : л<£}, {Z„ : л<£}
of the required vector subspaces of R (over Q) have already been constructed, and 
stipulate
X ^ = u{ X „ : л<£}, Y' = u{Y^ : л<£}, Z \ = U{ Z „ : л<£}.
Observe that X£, И-, and Z^ are vector spaces over Q, and
card(X£ + Y^ + Z^) < card(£) + ш < c.
By virtue of Martin’s Axiom, the set
z-'-' + Y-'-' + Z\ + Q(u{Fn : Л < £})
is of first category in R, so there exists an element у g e R such that
уg <£ X£ + Y’^+ Z'^ + Q(u{F£ : л < £}).
Consequently, one has у ^ £ Y£ and
((Q \ {0})уg + Y£) П (Q(U{F^ : л < £})) = 0.
Now, let и ^ = t g - у ^ and check that both sets
z £ +Y£ +°у £+Q (u{ F,/ : л < £}),
Y^ + Оу^ + Z^ + Q(u{F^ : л < £})
are of first category in R. Therefore, there exist two elements x^ e R and z^ e R 
satisfying
x ^ + z ^ = и ^, 
x^ ^ X+ Y^ + °у^ + Q(u{Fn : л < £}), 
z^ ^ Y^ + Оу^ + Z^ + Q(u{F£ : Л < £}).
Taking this into account, define the following three vector spaces over Q:

60
4 Bijective Continuous Images of Absolute Null Sets
X£. - X£ + Qx^, Y^ - Y'^ + Qy£., Zg - Z+ Qz£.
Proceeding in this manner, obtain the desired c-sequences
{Xt : £< c}, {Y^ : £< c}, {Z^ : £< c}.
Finally, define L1 - U{Xg + Y^ : £ < c} and L2 - U{Y^ + Z^ : £ < c}.
It remains to check that L1 and L2 are as required.
Indeed, conditions (a), (b), (c) are fulfilled by virtue of the construction, and 
condition (d) can be verified by transfinite induction. Actually, it suffices to show the 
validity of the equalities
(Yv + Y^) C F^ - (X^+i + Y^+x) Cl F^, 
(Yv + Zv) П F^ - (Y^+i + Z^+1) C F^
for any ordinal ^ e [£, c[. These equalities easily follow from the construction of 
Xg, Y^, and Z^. So both L1 and L2 turn out to be generalized Luzin sets in R.
Further, condition (1) trivially holds and condition (2) is implied by the fact that
tg - x^ + y^ + zg - (xg + y^/2) + (y€/2 + zg),
x€ + y^/2 e Li, y^/2 + z^ e L2
for every ordinal £ < c.
Condition (3) is a straightforward consequence of the injectivity of the c-sequence 
{y ^ : £ < c} and of the inclusion {y ^ : £ < c} c L1 C L2.
This completes the argument and yields the desired result.
4.9 
* Give a proof of Lemma 
, i.e., assuming again Martin’s Axiom, show that 
there exist two generalized Luzin sets K1 and K2 in R such that:
4.9
(1) both K1 and K2 are vector spaces over Q;
(2) the additive group (R, +) is a direct sum of K1 and K2; in other words, the 
relations
R - K1 + K2, K1 C K2 - {0}
hold true.
For this purpose, start with the two generalized Luzin sets L1 c R and L2 c R such 
as in Exercise 4.8 and let L - L1 C L2. Observe that L is a generalized Luzin set, too. 
In addition, since L is a vector subspace of L1, there exists in L1 a complementary 
vector space L ’ for L:
L + L' - L1, L C L' - {0}.
Now, it is clear that R is a direct sum of L' and L2. Since L2 is a generalized Luzin 
set and L' + L2 - R, one may assert (under Martin’s Axiom) that L' is necessarily of 
cardinality continuum and, being a subset of L1, this L' turns out to be a generalized 
Luzin set as well. Thus, one may take K1 - L' and K2 - L2.

For this purpose, denote by p the completion of a nonzero ^-finite diffuse Borel 
measure on E. Since E is separable and card(E) = c, it is possible to represent the 
family of all Borel p-measure zero subsets of E in the form {Вg : % < a}, where a is 
the least ordinal number such that card (a) = c. Then define, by using the method of 
transfinite recursion, an injective а-sequence {x^ : % < a} of points of E satisfying 
the following condition:
for each ordinal number % < a, the point x ^ does not belong to the union of the 
partial family {Bg : £ < %}.
Finally, stipulate A = {x^ : % < a} and verify that the set A is as required.

4.12 Let E be a ground set and let M denote some class of measures on E.
A set X с E is called absolutely measurable (or universally measurable) with 
respect to M if X is p-measurable for every measure p e M.
Check that the family of all absolutely measurable sets with respect to M forms 
a <x-algebra of subsets of E.
4.13 Let E and E' be two topological spaces and let / : E ^ E' be a Borel mapping. 
Suppose that Y с E' is a set absolutely measurable with respect to the class of the 
completions of all nonzero ^-finite Borel measures on E'.
Show that the set X = f-1 (Y) is absolutely measurable with respect to the class 
of the completions of all nonzero ^-finite Borel measures on E.
4.14 Let E be a ground set and let M denote some class of measures on E.
Recall that a function f : E ^ R is absolutely measurable (or universally 
measurable) with respect to M if, for any Borel set В с R, the set f-1 (B) is 
absolutely measurable with respect to M .
Verify that:
(a) the family of all absolutely measurable functions on E is closed under the standard 
algebraic operations, i.e., if f and g are absolutely measurable with respect to 
M, then the functions f + g, if (t e R), f • g are also absolutely measurable with 
respect to M ;
(b) if all functions fn (n e N) are absolutely measurable with respect to M and there 
exists a pointwise limit limn^TC fn = f, then f is also absolutely measurable with 
respect to M ;
(c) if a function f : E ^ R is absolutely measurable with respect to M and a 
function g : R ^ R is Borel, then the composition g ◦ f is absolutely measurable 
with respect to M .
4.15 Let f : R ^ R and g : R ^ R be two functions absolutely measurable 
with respect to the class M of the completions of all nonzero ^-finite diffuse Borel 
measures on R.
Can one assert that the composition f ◦ g is absolutely measurable with respect 
to the same class M?

4.16 * Assume that every uncountable co-analytic subset of R contains a topological 
copy of the Cantor space {0, 1}N. This set-theoretical assumption does not contradict 
ZFC theory and follows from the Axiom of Projective Determinacy (see [7, 74, 130]).
Let M denote the class of the completions of all nonzero ^-finite Borel measures 
on R.
Show that the ^-algebra generated by the Borel ^-algebra of R and the <r-ideal of 
all absolute null subsets of R is properly contained in the ^-algebra of all absolutely 
measurable sets with respect to M .
Argue as follows. First, verify that the ^-algebra generated by the Borel ^-algebra 
of R and the <r-ideal of all absolute null subsets of R is contained in the ^-algebra 
of all absolutely measurable sets with respect to M .
Then consider any analytic set A in R which is not Borel and use the fact from 
descriptive set theory that A is absolutely measurable with respect to M (see, e.g., 
[29,111,119]). Supposing for a moment that A = ВлX, where В is a Borel subset of 
R, X is an absolute null set in R, and д denotes the operation of symmetric difference, 
infer that АЛВ = X. Consequently, card(A \ В) < ы and card(В \ A) < ш. The latter 
two relations imply that A is a Borel set in R, which is impossible.
4.17 Prove that the canonical Baire space NN is universal in the class of all zero­
dimensional separable metric spaces, i.e., NN belongs to this class and contains a 
topological copy of any zero-dimensional separable metric space.
For this purpose, take an arbitrary zero-dimensional separable metric space E 
and recursively construct an appropriate sequence {Dn : n e N} of countable 
decompositions of E into closed-open subsets of E such that Dn+1 is inscribed in 
Dn for each natural index n.
Conclude from the above-mentioned result that R contains a topological copy of 
any zero-dimensional separable metric space.
Moreover, show that Cantor’s set С c R is also universal in the class of all 
zero-dimensional separable metric spaces.
Remark 4.18 A more general result can be found in [37] and [75]. It states that, 
for any infinite cardinal number a, there exists a universal space in the class of all 
those completely regular zero-dimensional topological spaces whose weights do not 
exceed a.

of 5 such that p (5 \ F) = 0.
Conclude from this result that:
(i) 5 is a Radon topological space;
(ii) any ^-finite Borel measure on 5 is concentrated on a first category subset of 5.
Argue as follows. First, reduce the argument to the case when a given measure p is 
diffuse. Then, applying the Suslin condition for 5, show that there exists a maximal 
(by inclusion) open subset U of 5 such that p(U) = 0. Observe that if an open

subinterval Д of 5 has a nonempty intersection with 5 \ U, then Д is of strictly 
positive '-measure. Further, let F = S \ U and verify that F is a separable subspace 
of 5. To do this, suppose on the contrary that F is not separable and define by 
transfinite recursion three families
{xg : C < wi}, 
{у^ : C < wi}, 
{z€ : C < wi }
of elements of 5 satisfying the following:
(a) 
{xg ,y g ,z z } c F and xg < у g < z z;
(b) ]x^, у^ [ П F + 0 and ]у^, z^ [ П F + 0;
(c) the open interval ] x%, zg [ does not have common points with the closure of the 
set {yc : C < C}.
To carry out an appropriate transfinite construction, suppose that, for an ordinal 
C < wi, the three partial C-sequences
{xc : C<F}, {уc : ^<C}, {zc : ^ < C}
of points of F are already defined satisfying the above conditions. Since F is non- 
separable, there exists a point t e F not belonging to the closure of {у: £ < C}• 
Hence there exists an open interval ] a,b [ c 5 such that
t e]a,b[, ]a,b[ncl({уc : £<C}) = 0.
Infer from the relations t e F and t e ]a, b [ that card(] a, b [ П F) > w. 
Consequently, there are some five points ti, t2, t3, t4, and t5 in F such that
a < ti < t2 < t3 < /4 < ts < b.
Now, put xg = ti, уg = t3, z% = t5, and verify that (a), (b), and (c) remain valid for 
the extended partial families
{xc : £ < C}, {уc : t < C}, {zc : 
^ C}.
Proceeding in this manner, get the required families
{X£ : C < w1}, 
{у ^ : C < wi}, 
{z^ : C < wi}
and show that the family of open rectangles
{]x^,у^[ x ]у^,z^[ : C < wi}
is disjoint. Finally, consider the product space 5 x 5 and the product measure ^ ® ^ 
on 5 x 5. Keeping in mind the fact that
(F ® /'"I' zz ,у €[x] у ё ,z z[) > 0 
(C<wi),
come to a contradiction with the ^-finiteness of ' ® '.

4 Bijective Continuous Images of Absolute Null Sets
The obtained contradiction yields the desired result.
Remark 4.19 An argument quite similar to the one presented above shows that the 
product space 5 x 5 does not satisfy Suslin’s condition (this classical result is due to 
D. Kurepa). As is known, in Godel’s Constructible Universe L there exists a Suslin 
line (see [7, 68, 108]). Thus, inL there is a topological space (even compact space) 
X such that X satisfies the Suslin condition, but its topological square X x X does 
not. Respectively, in the same L there is a partially ordered set (P, <) such that 
(P, <) satisfies the countable chain condition, but whose square (P, <) x (P, <) 
does not. Also, it is appropriate to mention here that, assuming CH, it is possible 
to establish the existence of two partially ordered sets (P1, <1) and (P2, <2) each 
of which satisfies the countable chain condition, but whose product set P1 x P2 
endowed with the product partial ordering <1 x <2 does not.
4.19* Assume CH and let (5, <) be again a Suslin line.
Show that there exists a set L c 5 possessing the following two properties:
(a) L is everywhere dense in 5 (hence L is of cardinality continuum);
(b) for each first category subset X of 5, the set X n L is at most countable.
In other words, this L may be treated as a Luzin type set in the Suslin line 5.
Deduce from the properties (a) and (b) that L is a nonseparable universal measure 
zero topological space.
To demonstrate the existence of such a set L, argue similarly to Luzin’s classical 
construction of Luzin sets on the real line R, and then take into account the result of 
Exercise 4.18.

Chapter 5
Projective Absolutely Nonmeasurable Functions
To begin this chapter, we remind the reader that the general measure extension 
problem is formulated as follows:
Let E be an uncountable base (ground) set and let p be a nonzero a -finite diffuse 
(i.e., vanishing at the singletons) measure p given on some a-algebra of subsets of 
E. One is required to extend this p to a maximally big class of subsets of E.
It turns out that the posed problem does not admit a satisfactory solution, because 
in many cases there is no maximal extension of (see, e.g., [4, 168]). Actually, for 
each set X с E, there exists a measure p ' on E extending p and such that X becomes 
measurable with respect to p' (see, for instance, Exercise 5.1).
By using ordinary induction, it trivially follows from the above fact that, for an 
arbitrary ^-finite diffuse measure p on E and for any finite family {X1,X2,... ,Xn} 
of subsets of E, there exists a measure p' on E extending p and satisfying the relation
{Xi,X2,...,Xn} с dom(p').
Thus, one may say that there is no subset of E which is absolutely nonmeasurable 
with respect to the class of all nonzero ^-finite diffuse measures on E.
Remark 5.1 If {Xj : j e J} is an arbitrary (in particular, uncountable) disjoint 
family of subsets of a base set E and p is any ^-finite measure on E, then there 
always exists a measure p ’ on E extending p and such that
{Xj : j e J} с dom(p').
For a proof of this important result, see [2] or Exercise 5.2. The disjointness of the 
family {Xj : j e J} is essential, because omitting this assumption it can be proved 
that there is even a countable family F of subsets of E = u1 which does not admit 
any nonzero ^-finite diffuse measure defined for all members of F (a more detailed 
explanation will be given below).

5 Projective Absolutely Nonmeasurable Functions
In various works related aspects of the measure extension problem have been 
considered for those cases when some additional mathematical structures enter the 
scene and are compatible with the measure structure (e.g., certain topological and 
algebraic structures; cf. [172]).
For real-valued functions defined on E the situation is somewhat different. Indeed, 
denoting by R the real line, taking E = R and assuming Martin’s Axiom, it can be 
shown that there are functions f : E ^ R which are absolutely nonmeasurable 
with respect to the class M(R) of all nonzero ^-finite diffuse measures on R (see, 
for instance, [99]). Recall that the latter phrase means that f is nonmeasurable with 
respect to every measure p e M(R). Such an f may be treated as an extremely 
nonmeasurable function, so f seems to be of a much more pathological nature than 
Lebesgue nonmeasurable real-valued functions or those real-valued functions which 
are nonmeasurable with respect to a concrete nonzero ^-finite diffuse measure on 
R.
In order to characterize absolutely nonmeasurable functions acting from a ground 
set E into R, we need the notion of an absolute null subset of R.
Recall that a set X c R is absolute null (or universal measure zero) if, for every 
^-finite diffuse Borel measure p on R, one has p*(X) = 0, where p* denotes the 
outer measure canonically associated with p.
Some properties of absolute null sets were pointed out in Chapter 4. In particular, 
it was mentioned therein that the existence of uncountable absolute null subsets of 
R can be proved within ZFC set theory. In the literature there are several interesting 
constructions of such subsets, which essentially differ from one another (see, e.g., 
[111, 119, 126, 144, 173]).
Let M(E) stand for the class of all nonzero ^-finite diffuse measures on a ground 
set E.
We have a characterization of absolutely nonmeasurable real-valued functions on 
E in terms of absolute null subsets of R. It is as follows.
Lemma 5.2 Let E be a ground set and let f : E ^ R be a function.
Then these two assertions are equivalent:
(a) f is absolutely nonmeasurable with respect to the class M(E);
(b) the range ran( f) of f is an absolute null subset of R and the sets f-1 (t) are at 
most countable for all points t e R.
For a proof of Lemma 5.2 (which is not difficult), see Exercise 5.5.
It turns out that the absolute nonmeasurability of a given function f : E ^ R 
is intimately connected with the existence of absolutely nonmeasurable countable 
families of subsets of a ground set E. Let us give the precise definition of such 
families.
We shall say that a family {Zn : n < ш} of subsets of a base set E is absolutely 
nonmeasurable with respect to the class M(E) if the following two conditions are 
fulfilled:
(i) all singletons in E belong to the ^-algebra a({Zn : n < ш}) generated by 
{Zn : n < ш};

5 Projective Absolutely Nonmeasurable Functions
67
(ii) there exists no measure from M (E) whose domain coincides with the ^-algebra 
a({Z„ : n < w}).
It is easy to see that condition (i) is equivalent to the following condition:
(i') the family {Zn : n < w} separates the points of E, i.e., for any two distinct 
points x e E and у e E, there exists an n < w such that
card({x, у} П Zn) = 1.
Notice also that condition (i) (or, equivalently, condition (i')) trivially implies the 
inequality card(E) < c.
Theorem 5.3 For any ground set E, these two assertions are valid:
(1) if there exists a function f : E > R which is absolutely nonmeasurable with 
respect to the class M(E), then there exists a countable family {Xk : к e К} of 
subsets of E which is absolutely nonmeasurable with respect to M(E);
(2) if there exists a countable family {Xk : к e К} of subsets of E which is ab­
solutely nonmeasurable with respect to the class M(E), then there exists an 
injective function g : E > R that is measurable with respect to the a-algebra 
a({Xk : к e К}) and, simultaneously, is absolutely nonmeasurable with respect 
to M(E).
Proof In order to establish the validity of (1), consider an arbitrary function 
f : E > R which is absolutely nonmeasurable with respect to the class M(E). 
By virtue of (b) of Lemma 5.2, we have the inequality
card(E) < c,
so E can be identified with some subset of R. Take any countable family {дп : n < w} 
of nonempty open intervals in R which collectively form a base of the standard 
Euclidean topology of R. Clearly, {дп : n < w} separates the points of R. It directly 
follows from this observation that there exists a countable family {Yn : n < w} of 
subsets of E which separates the points of E. Let us put
{Xk : к e К} = {f-1 (д„) : n < w} U {Yn : n < w}.
Then it is not hard to check that the family {Хк : к e К} turns out to be absolutely 
nonmeasurable with respect to the class M(E), i.e., assertion (1) holds true.
In order to establish the validity of (2), consider an arbitrary countable family 
{Xk : к < w} of subsets of E, which is absolutely nonmeasurable with respect to 
the class M(E). Denoting by {0,1}" the standard Cantor space, we may define a 
mapping
ф : E > {0,1}"
by the following formula:
ф(x) = {iк(x) : к < w} 
(x e E), 

68
5 Projective Absolutely Nonmeasurable Functions
where ik (x) = 1 if x e Xk, and ik (x) = 0 if x £ Xk.
It is easy to verify that the mapping ф introduced in this manner is injective and 
a({Xk : к < w})-measurable. Further, denote by ф some Borel isomorphism acting 
from {0,1}" onto R. Then the composition of ф and ф, i.e., the function g = ф ◦ ф is 
injective, a({Xk : к < w})-measurable and absolutely nonmeasurable with respect 
to the class M(E), i.e., assertion (2) holds true.
Theorem 5.3 has thus been proved. 
□
It is natural to ask whether there exist definable (in some natural sense) functions 
f : R ^ R which are absolutely nonmeasurable with respect to the class M(R).
According to Theorem 5.3, this question is equivalent to the question whether 
there exists a definable countable family {Zn : n < w} of subsets of R which is 
absolutely nonmeasurable with respect to the same class M (R) .
Since the notion of “definability” admits variations within the framework of 
formal logic and the foundations of mathematics, we will restrict our further consid­
erations to a more concrete version of definable sets and functions. Namely, we will 
be dealing below with those functions whose graphs are projective subsets of the 
plane R2. Here the term “projective set” is understood in the classical sense of Luzin 
and Sierpinski (see, e.g., [111, 119]). In this context, recall that a partial function 
f : R ^ R is projective if the graph of f is a projective subset of R2.
According to well-known set-theoretical results, there exist models of ZFC the­
ory in which all projective subsets of R have a good descriptive structure and, in 
particular, turn out to be Lebesgue measurable. For instance, the so-called Axiom of 
Projective Determinacy (PD) implies all important regularity properties of the pro­
jective sets, including their measurability in the Lebesgue sense (see, e.g., [7, 68]). 
This indicates that the existence of definable absolutely nonmeasurable functions 
on R can be detected only in special models of ZFC theory. The main goal of this 
chapter is to demonstrate the existence of such functions with the aid of some (more 
or less natural) additional set-theoretical hypotheses.
For this purpose, we need several auxiliary notions and facts from classical 
measure theory and real analysis. First, let us recall the fairly standard notation.
As usual, sets belonging to the Luzin-Sierpinski projective hierarchy are denoted 
by the symbols Y1n and П',, according to the projective levels of those sets. The 
standard monographs and textbooks of classical descriptive set theory are [74, 111, 
119, 130]. Needless to say, projective sets are regarded as one of possible realizations 
of the notion of definability for point sets lying in Euclidean spaces or, more generally, 
in Polish topological spaces. However, it is well known that among those sets one 
can encounter some kind of pathology from the measure-theoretical and topological 
viewpoints.
Example 5.4 Recall that a Vitali set is an arbitrary selector of the quotient set R/Q, 
where Q stands for the additive group of all rational numbers. As was shown by Vitali 
[169], every Vitali set is nonmeasurable with respect to any translation-invariant 
measure on R extending the Lebesgue measure Л. Also, no Vitali set possesses the 
Baire property (see, e.g., [99, 129]). Assuming that there exists a well-ordering of 
R whose graph is a ^2-subset of the plane R2, it can readily be demonstrated that 

5 Projective Absolutely Nonmeasurable Functions
69
there exists a Vitali set V in R which is a E2-subset of R. Consequently, under the 
above assumption, there exist projective sets which are Lebesgue nonmeasurable and 
do not have the Baire property. In particular, this assumption holds true in certain 
models of ZFC theory, e.g., in Godel’s Constructible Universe L (see [68]). So, 
the characteristic function xv of V turns out to be absolutely nonmeasurable with 
respect to the class of all those measures on R which extend A and are invariant 
under the group (Q, +) of rational translations ofR.
Our goal is to generalize Example 5.4 to the class M(R) of all nonzero ^-finite 
diffuse measures on R.
Lemma 5.5 Suppose that there exists a well-ordering < of R (or, equivalently, of 
[0, 1]) whose graph is a projective subset ofR2 (of [0, 1]2).
Then every projective set in R2 (in [0, 1]2) admits a uniformization by a projective 
set.
Proof The argument is easy and can be carried out in the standard manner. Take any 
projective set Z c [0,1]2 and consider its projection pr1 (Z) on the axis of abscissae. 
For each point x e pr1 (Z), the corresponding section
Z (x) = {у e[0,1] : (x,y)e Z}
is nonempty. Let us put
у(x) = inf {у e [0,1] : (х,у) e Z}.
A straightforward verification shows that the set
{(х,у(x)) : X e pri(Z)} c Z
is a projective subset of [0, 1]2 and, simultaneously, is the graph ofa certain function 
acting from pr1(Z) into [0, 1] . The details are left to the reader. 
□
Recall that c R is a Luzin set in R if is uncountable and its intersection with 
every first category subset of R is at most countable.
Various properties of Luzin sets are discussed in [7, 29, 99, 107, 111, 126, 129]. 
One such property is formulated in the next lemma.
Lemma 5.6 Every Luzin set in R is an absolute null space.
Proof Any ^-finite diffuse Borel measure on L is concentrated on some first category 
subset X of L. Since card(X) < w, the required result immediately follows. □
We now are ready to formulate and prove the main result of this chapter, con­
cerning the existence of projective absolutely nonmeasurable functions acting from 
R into R (equivalently, acting from [0, 1] into [0, 1]).

5 Projective Absolutely Nonmeasurable Functions
Theorem 5.7 Suppose that there exists a well-ordering < of [0,1] for which the 
following two conditions are fulfilled:
(*) < is isomorphic to the natural well-ordering of ш1;
(** ) the graph of < is a projective subset of [0,1]2.
Then there exists a function ф : [0,1] ^ [0,1] whose graph is a projective subset of 
[0, 1]2 and which is absolutely nonmeasurable with respect to the class M([0, 1]) 
of all nonzero a -finite diffuse measures on [0,1].
Proof We argue step by step as follows.
(a) First, denote by E the compact metric space of all nonempty closed subsets 
of [0,1], and consider its subspace E' consisting of all nonempty nowhere dense 
closed subsets of [0,1]. It can readily be checked that E' is of type G s in E, so E' 
can be treated as a Polish topological space (notice, by the way, that E' is everywhere 
dense in E).
(b) 
Further, identify the Baire canonical space шш with the set
I= [0, 1] \Q
of all irrational numbers in [0, 1] and introduce a continuous surjection
Ф : I ^ E
Such a surjection exists, because every nonempty Polish topological space is a 
continuous image of the Baire canonical space ш" (see, for instance, [37] or [111]). 
Then, for each point x e [0,1], consider the set
Z(x) = {у : x < у & у ф и{Ф(г) : i e I & i < x}}
and define the subset of the plane R2 by putting
Z = u{{x}x Z(x) : x e [0,1]}.
A straightforward verification shows that Z is a projective subset of the square [0, 1]2 
and the equality pr1(Z) = [0, 1] holds true. Indeed, the set Z can be written in the 
form
(x, у) e Z « (x x у & у ф и{Ф(г) : i e I & i < x})
and the formula of the right-hand side of this equivalence describes a certain pro­
jective set in [0, 1]2.
(c) 
Taking into account Lemma
, we deduce the existence of a function
 5.5
Ф : [0,1] ^ [0,1]
whose graph is a projective subset of [0, 1]2 and is contained in Z. Then we verify 
that the range ran(ф) of ф is a Luzin set in [0,1] which simultaneously is a projective 
subset of [0, 1], and
card(ф 1 (t)) < ш

5 Projective Absolutely Nonmeasurable Functions
71
for every point t e [0,1]. Finally, keeping in mind Lemmas 5.2 and 5.6, we may 
conclude that ф is absolutely nonmeasurable with respect to the class M([0,1]) of 
all nonzero ^-finite diffuse measures on [0,1].
This completes the proof of Theorem 5.7. 
□
Example 5.8 Taking into account Theorem 5.3, it follows from Theorem 5.7 (under 
the same assumption) that there is a countable family {Tj : j e J} of projective 
subsets of [0,1] such that no nonzero ^-finite diffuse measure p on [0,1] satisfies 
the relation
{Tj : j e J} c dom(p).
Indeed, for this purpose it suffices to take a countable base {Un : n < ш} of open sets 
in [0,1] and a countable base {Vn : n < ш} of open sets in the space ran(^) c [0,1]. 
Defining
{Tj : j e J} = {Un : n < ш} U {ф-1 (Vn) : n < ш},
we see that the family {Tj : j e J} is as required. In other words, this family is 
absolutely nonmeasurable with respect to the class M([0, 1]).
Remark 5.9 Since the real line R and the unit segment [0, 1] are Borel isomorphic 
spaces, we obtain that, under the assumptions of Theorem 5.7, there exists a function 
ф : R ^ R whose graph is a projective subset of R2 and which is absolutely 
nonmeasurable with respect to the class M (R) .
Remark 5.10 The situation described by the conditions (*) and (**) of Theorem 5.7 
is realizable in certain models of ZFC theory, for instance, in Godel’s Constructible 
Universe L.
Remark 5.11 In one of his letters to Godel, Ulam announced that it is impossible 
(at least, in some models of set theory) to introduce a diffuse probability measure 
defined for all projective subsets of the unit interval [0, 1]. In this connection, Ulam 
refers to his (ш x w1)-matrix (see [168]) and especially underlines the fact that all 
members of that matrix can be taken to be projective subsets of [0, 1]. Theorem 5.7 
shows that a certain projective Luzin subset of [0, 1] also enables us to obtain the 
same result. Moreover, it follows from the proof of Theorem 5.7 that an absolutely 
nonmeasurable countable family of projective subsets of [0, 1] can be assumed to 
have the property that all members of the family belong to a concrete projective class 
X1. Of course, this T1n essentially depends on the projective class corresponding to 
an initial well-ordering <.
Exercises
5.1 Marczewski’s well-known method of extending measures can be described as 
follows (cf. [164, 165]).
Let E be a ground set, p be a measure defined on some ^-algebra of subsets of 
E, and let I be a <r-ideal of subsets of E such that p,(F) = 0 for each Y e I, where 

72
5 Projective Absolutely Nonmeasurable Functions
л* denotes the inner measure associated with л. Consider the family L of all sets 
representable in the form (Z и Z') \ Z”, where Z e dom(л) and {Z’, Z"} с I.
Show that:
(a) L is a ^-algebra of subsets of E containing dom(л);
(b) the formula v((Z и Z') \ Z") = л(Z) correctly defines some measure v with 
dom() = L;
(c) 
v extends л;
(d) for each set e I, one has v ( ) = 0.
Verify that the usual completion of л can be obtained by a special application of 
Marczewski’s method.
Show that if л is a ^-finite measure, then for each set X с E, there exists a 
measure л' on E extending л and such that X becomes measurable with respect to 
л'.
For this purpose, reduce the task to the case when л*(X) = 0 and apply Mar­
czewski’s method to л and to the <r-ideal I = {Y : Y с X} of subsets of E.
Conclude from the above result that there is no subset of E absolutely nonmea- 
surable with respect to the class M(E) of all nonzero <r-finite diffuse measures on 
E.
By using induction on n e N, infer from the above fact that, for any ^-finite 
measure v on E and for any finite family {X1,X2, ...,Xn} of subsets of E, there 
exists a measure v' on E which extends v and for which the relation
{Xi,X2,...,Xn} с dom(v')
is satisfied.
Remark 5.12 Let E be a ground set and let G be a group of transformations of 
E. A measure л defined on some G-invariant ^-algebra of subsets of E is called 
quasi-invariant with respect to G (in short, G-quasi-invariant) if
(VX e dom(л))№ e G)(л(X) = 0 « л(g(X)) = 0).
Moreover, if the stronger statement
(VX e dom(л))(Vg e G)(л(X) = л(g(X)))
holds true, then л is called invariant with respect to G (in short, G-invariant).
Obviously, Marczewski’s method of extending measures works for any G-quasi- 
invariant (respectively, G-invariant) measure л and for any G-invariant <r-ideal I 
of subsets of E such that p*(Y) = 0 for each Y e I .In this case, the extension v of 
л obtained by Marczewski’s method turns out to be G-quasi-invariant (respectively, 
G-invariant).

5.2 
* Let p be a ^-finite measure on a ground set E and let {Xj : j e J} be a disjoint 
family of subsets of E.
Strengthening the result presented in Exercise 5.1, show that there exists a measure 
v on E extending p and such that
{Xj : j e J} c dom( v).
For this purpose, suppose (without loss of generality) that the given family 
{Xj : j e J} is a partition of E and consider two possible cases.
(1) The partition {Xj : j e J} is at most countable, i.e., one has
card(J) < card(N) = ш.
Let {t j : j e J} be an injective family of real numbers and let
f : E ^ R
be a step function such that ran( f |Xj) = {tj} for any j e J.
Clearly, it suffices to show that there exists a measure on E extending p for which 
f becomes measurable.
Since card(J) < ш, one may assume that either J = {1,2,..., m} or J = N = ш.
Under this assumption, introduce the following notation:
X'n = a p-measurable hull of Xn, where n e J;
Yn = X„\ (U{X'k : к < n}), where n e J.
Observe that the family of sets {Yn : n e J} is a disjoint covering of E and define 
a new function
/о : E ^ R
by putting: f0(x) = tn if and only if x e Yn.
Since all sets Yn (n e I) are p-measurable, it immediately follows from the 
definition of f0 that f0 is a p-measurable function. Further, check the equality
p.({x e E : f (x) + fo(x)}) = 0,
where p, denotes, as usual, the inner measure associated with p. To verify the above 
equality, suppose otherwise, i.e., suppose that
p,({x e E : f (x) + /0(x)}) > 0.
Then there exists an index n e J such that
p,(Y„ П {x e E : f (x) + /0(x)}) > 0.
On the other hand, it is easy to verify the following inclusion:
Yn П {x e E : f (x) + fa (x)} c X' \ X„, 

74
5 Projective Absolutely Nonmeasurable Functions
which gives a contradiction with the definition of the measurable hull X'n of Xn. The 
contradiction obtained establishes the validity of the required relation
J»({x e E : f (x) + fo (x)}) = 0.
Now, by virtue of Marczewski’s method of extending measures, the set
X = {x e E : f (x) + fo (x)}
can be made measurable with respect to some measure v on E extending j and, 
moreover, v can be chosen so that v(X) = 0. Consequently, f becomes measurable 
with respect to this v.
(2) The partition {Xj : j e J} of E is uncountable, i.e., card(J) > ш.
Using the ^-finiteness of j, which implies the validity of the so-called countable 
chain condition, it is not difficult to show that there exists a set I c J satisfying the 
following two properties:
(a) card(J \ I) < ш;
(b) for any countable set Io c I, the equality
J*(u{Xj : j e Io}) = 0
holds true.
Starting with (b) and applying again Marczewski’s method, first make all the sets 
Xj (j e I) be measurable with respect to some measure j' on E extending j. Notice, 
by the way, that j'(Xj) = 0 for all indices j e I. Finally, apply the previous case (1) 
to the countable disjoint family {Xj : j e J \ I} and extend j' to a measure j" on 
E such that
{Xj : j e J \ I}c dom(j").
Conclude from the above that the measure v = j" turns out to be an extension 
of j and satisfies the inclusion {Xj : j e J} c dom( v), which yields the required 
result.
5.3 Let E be a ground set with card(E) = ш1.
Show that there exists a countably generated ^-algebra S of subsets of E satisfying 
the following conditions:
(a) all singletons in E belong to S;
(b) there is no nonzero ^-finite diffuse measure j with dom(j) = S.
For this purpose, consider an arbitrary absolute null subset X of R with card(X) = ш1 
and identify E with X by some bijective mapping.
5.4 
* Show, by assuming Martin’s Axiom, that there are injective functions g : R ^ R 
which are additive and absolutely nonmeasurable with respect to the class M (R).
For this purpose, take a generalized Luzin subset X of R which is a vector space 
over the field Q and, keeping in mind the equality card(X) = c, consider an arbitrary 
isomorphism g between the two commutative groups (R, +) and (X, +).

5.5 
* Let E be a ground set and let f : E ^ R be a function.
Prove that these two assertions are equivalent:
(a) f is absolutely nonmeasurable with respect to the class M(E);
(b) the range of f is an absolute null subset of R and the sets f -1 (t) are at most 
countable for all points t e R.
Argue as follows. Assume (a) and first check that if, for some point t0 e R, the 
set f -1 (t0) is uncountable, then f becomes measurable with respect to a certain 
probability diffuse measure on E. Consequently, one must have
card(f -1 (t)) < ш 
(t e R).
Further, supposing for a moment that ran( f) is not an absolute null subset of R, 
consider a Borel probability diffuse measure p on ran (f) and introduce the a- 
algebra
S = {f -1 (T) : T e dom(p)}.
Define a functional v : S ^ R by putting
v(f -1 (T)) = p(T) 
(T e dom(p))
and check that v is a probability measure on E such that f is a measurable function 
with respect to the completion of v which, in its turn, is a probability diffuse measure 
on E. This contradicts (a) and shows that the implication (a) ^ (b) holds true.
The converse implication (b) ^ (a) can be established by arguing in a similar 
manner.
5.6 Verify that the two conditions (i) and (i') formulated before Theorem
are 
equivalent to each other.
 5.3 
5.7 
* Prove Sierpinski’s theorem stating that there exists no well-ordering of R which 
is an analytic (or co-analytic) subset of the plane R2 .
For this purpose, take into account the absolute measurability of any analytic 
subset of R (of R2) with respect to the family of the completions of all nonzero 
^■finite Borel measures on R (on R2).
5.8 Let n > 2 be a natural number.
Assuming that there exists a well-ordering of R belonging to the class X*, show 
that there exists a Vitali subset of R which also belongs to the class X*.
5.9 Using the notation of the proof of Theorem 5.7, check that the family E' of all 
nonempty closed nowhere dense sets in [0,1] is an uncountable G s-subset of the 
family E of all nonempty closed sets in [0,1] (as usual, E is equipped with the 
standard Hausdorff metric or, equivalently, is equipped with the Vietoris topology).
Conclude that E' is an uncountable Polish topological space, so there exists a 
continuous surjection Ф : I ^ E' (see, e.g., [37] or [111]).
5.10 Try to generalize Theorem 5.7 replacing in its formulation the Continuum 
Hypothesis (CH) by Martin’s Axiom (MA).

According to the commonly used terminology, a topological space is Polish if 
is homeomorphic to some complete separable metric space.
Recall that the term “Polish space” was first introduced by Bourbaki.
Modern descriptive set theory has primarily developed within the framework of 
Polish spaces, and is focused on properties of those subsets of such spaces which are 
definable either in ZF theory or in ZF & DC theory.
The following is one of the main results in classical descriptive set theory:
If A and В are any uncountable Borel subsets of Polish spaces, then they are 
Borel isomorphic, i.e., there exists a Borel isomorphism f : A ^ В.
For a proof, see e.g. [29, 74, 111, 130]. Note that the above statement is provable 
within ZF & DC theory, so does not need an uncountable form of the Axiom of 
Choice (AC).
Thus, one can see that the problem of the existence of a Borel isomorphism be­
tween two given Borel subsets and of Polish spaces is reduced to the cardinalities 
of and . Namely, and are Borel isomorphic if and only if card() = card( ).
On the other hand, it should be observed that:
(*) if Z is an analytic set in a Polish space and f is a Borel mapping from Z into a 
Polish space E, then the set f (Z) is an analytic set in E;
(** 
) if Z is a proper (i.e., non-Borel) analytic set in a Polish space, then Z cannot 
be Borel isomorphic to a Borel subset of a Polish space.
In this context, it is natural to ask whether any two proper analytic subsets of Polish 
spaces are Borel isomorphic.
The main goal of the present chapter is to show that it is impossible to establish, 
within ZFC theory, the statement for analytic sets in Polish spaces analogous to 
the result mentioned above. More precisely, in certain models of ZFC there exist 
two proper analytic sets which are not Borel isomorphic (see [121]). Some further 
comments will be made in connection with this interesting phenomenon.
We begin with an important extension theorem which is due to M. A. Lavrentiev 
(see [37, 111]).

6 Borel Isomorphisms of Analytic Sets
Lemma 6.1 Let X be a metric space, Y be a complete metric space, and let f : X ^ Y 
be a partial continuous mapping (i.e., f is continuous on dom( f)).
Then there exists a partial continuous mapping f * : X ^ Y which extends f and 
is defined on a G g -subset of X.
Proof We shall say that x e X is a point of zero oscillation of f if, for any real 
£ > 0, there exists a neighborhood U(x) such that the diameter of the set f (U(x)) is 
less than s (here and below we mean that the diameter of 0 is equal to zero).
The symbol Qq (f) will denote the set of all points of zero oscillation of f. Notice 
that if x e X does not belong to the closure of dom( f), then x e Qq(f).
It is not difficult to see that Qq (f) can be represented as the intersection of a 
countable family of open subsets of X, so Qq (f) itself is a Borel subset of X. By 
virtue of the continuity of f, we have the inclusion
dom( f) c Qq (f).
Further, if {xn : n e N} c dom( f) is a sequence of points convergent to some point 
x e Qq (f), then the corresponding sequence {f (x„) : n e N} is fundamental in Y 
and, in view of the completeness of Y, this sequence converges to some e Y. Clearly, 
the point у does not depend on the choice of {x„ : n e N} and depends only on x. So 
we can define у = f *(x) for any point x belonging to the set Qq(f) n cl(dom(f)). 
We leave to the reader a detailed verification of the fact that the extended mapping 
f * is continuous and that its domain is a G g-set in X. 
□
From Lemma 6.1 the next auxiliary lemma (also due to Lavrentiev) can be 
deduced.
Lemma 6.2 Let X be a metric space, Y be a Polish space, and let f : X ^ Y be a 
partial Borel mapping (i.e., f is Borel on its domain).
Then there exists a partial Borel mapping f * : X ^ Y which extends f and is 
defined on a Borel subset of X.
We would like to remind the reader that, under the assumptions of Lemma 6.2, 
the given mapping f belongs to the family of partial Baire mappings acting from X 
into Y. So it is natural to try to prove Lemma 6.2 by using the method of transfinite 
induction on the Baire order of f (for more details, see Exercise 6.2).
In many topics of classical descriptive set theory Lavrentiev’s theorem on ex­
tensions of partial Borel isomorphisms plays a key role (see, e.g., [74, 111]). For 
instance, this theorem will play an essential role in our further considerations. Let 
us formulate and prove it.
Theorem 6.3 Let E and F be two Polish spaces and let f : X ^ Y be a Borel 
isomorphism, where X c and Y c .
Then there exists a Borel isomorphism f * : X* ^ Y* such that:

6 Borel Isomorphisms of Analytic Sets
79
(1) 
X с X* and Y c Y*;
(2) f * is an extension of f;
(3) X* is a Borel subset of and Y* is a Borel subset of.
Proof By virtue of Lemma 6.2, for f there exists a partial Borel mapping g : E ^ F 
which extends f and is defined on some Borel subset of E. According to the same 
lemma, for f-1 there exists a partial Borel mapping h : F ^ E which extends f-1 
and is defined on some Borel subset of F. Take the topological product E x F and 
consider in it the intersection (g,h) of the graph ofg and the reversed graph of h. 
It is not hard to check that:
(a) (g, h) is a Borel set in E x F;
(b) (g, h) is the graph ofan injective partial function acting from E into F.
It immediately follows from (a) and (b) that (g, h) is the graph ofa Borel isomor­
phism f * : X* ^ Y*, where
X* = pr1((g,h)), Y* = pr2((g, h)).
Being a bijective continuous image of (g, h), the set X* is Borel in E and, analo­
gously, being a bijective continuous image of (g, h), the set Y* is Borel in F (see 
[74, 111]). It is also clear that f * extends the original Borel isomorphism f.
This completes the proof of Lavrentiev’s theorem. 
□
The analog of Theorem 6.3 for partial homeomorphisms between Polish spaces 
is presented in Exercise 6.1.
In the sequel, the following example will be useful.
Example 6.4 Consider the standard Cantor space = {0, 1}{1,2,...,,...} with its 
countable subspace defined by the formula
t e D « (Bn e N \ {0})(tn = 1 & (Vm > n)(tm = 0)),
where = (1,2,...,,...). If is regarded as a linearly ordered set with respect 
to its lexicographical order <lex or with respect to the reverse order >lex, then D 
turns out to be everywhere dense in (and dense in itself). Simultaneously, D has 
neither least nor greatest elements. This implies that D (similarly to Q) is universal 
for the class of all countable linearly ordered sets. Obviously, we may write D as a 
fixed injective sequence
D = {r (1),r (2),...,r (k),...} 
(k e N \ {0}).
Further, for any nonzero natural number , we define
Cr(к) = {t e C : tk = 1}.
Each Cr (k) is a closed-open subset of the compact topological space C and the 
algebra of sets generated by the family {Cr (k) : k e N \ {0}} contains the canonical 
base of C. The above-mentioned family

80
6 Borel Isomorphisms of Analytic Sets
{Cr(k) : к е N \{0}} = {Ct : t е D}
will play a crucial role in our further considerations.
As is well known, the analytic sets in Polish spaces can be defined in two different 
manners.
The first way to introduce them uses the important notion of an A-operation. 
Namely, any analytic set is treated as the result of applying the А-operation to some 
А-system of nonempty closed subsets of a Polish space (see, e.g., [29, 74, 111, 119, 
130]).
The second definition says that any nonempty analytic set is a subset of a Polish 
space representable as some continuous image of the canonical Baire space NN (see 
again [29, 74, 111, 119, 130]).
However, in the sequel it will be helpful to use the third way of introducing the 
analytic sets, suggested by Luzin many years ago (see [119]).
Suppose that E is a Polish space and, for every element t е D, the set Wt с E is 
given.
The family {Wt : t е D} is usually called Luzin’s sieve in E.
For any point x е E, this sieve uniquely determines the following set:
Dx = {t е D : x е Wt} с D.
It is evident that the entire space E admits a decomposition
E = U{Ef : i е I},
where I denotes the family of all ordinal types of at most countable linearly ordered 
sets and Ei (i е I) is the set of all those points x е E whose corresponding set Dx 
has type i with respect to >lex, i.e., ot(Dx) = i.
Remark 6.5 Quite often the role of the sets Wt (t е D) is played by certain Borel 
(closed, open) subsets of E . Also, in many cases it is convenient to additionally 
suppose that the family {Wt : t е D} separates points in E, i.e., for any two distinct 
points x and у from E, there exists a t е D such that card({x, у} П Wt) = 1. In 
particular, the Cantor space C is endowed with its sieve {Ct : t е D } (see Example 
6.4), which trivially separates points in C. We shall say that {Ct : t е D } is a 
canonical sieve in C.
Let E be a Polish space and let {Wt : t е D} be a Luzin sieve in E.
A set А с E is called sifted by {Wt : t е D } if A is defined by the formula:
x е A « there exists a strictly increasing (with respect to <lex) infinite sequence 
{r(к 1), r(к2),..., r(кn),...} с D such that
x е n{Wt : t е {r(ki),r(к2), ...,r(кn),...}}.
From this formula we immediately obtain that the complementary set E \ A admits 
a canonical decomposition

6 Borel Isomorphisms of Analytic Sets
81
Е \ А = U{Uа : а < Ш1},
where Ua denotes the set of all those points x of Е whose corresponding set Dx = 
{t e D : x e Wt} equipped with the order >lex is isomorphic to an ordinal number 
a < Ш1.
According to the standard terminology, the sets Ua (a < ш1) are called the 
constituents of Е \ A.
If x e Е \ A, then the symbol о(x) will stand for the unique ordinal a < w1 such 
that x e Ua. Thus, we have by definition x e Uo(x).
Example 6.6 Consider the special case when
Е = C, 
{Wt : t e D} = {Ct : t e D}.
In this case, define a set 5 c C by the formula:
x e 5 if and only if the set Dx is well-ordered with respect to >lex.
As stated above, the set 5 produces its canonical decomposition into constituents 
5 = u{5a : a < ы1}, where 5a (a < ш1) denotes the set of all those x e 5 whose 
corresponding set Dx is isomorphic to a.
Lemma 6.7 The following two assertions are valid:
(1) the set C \ S is analytic in C;
(2) every Sa (a < ш1) is a nonempty Borel subset of C.
Proof To check the validity of assertion (1), let us express the relation x e C \ 5 in 
the form:
x e C \ S «
(3z e CN)(Vn e N)(z„ <fa zn+i & (3t e D)(Zn = t & x e Ct)).
The latter formula shows us that C \ 5 is the projection of some Borel subset of the 
product space C x CN, so C \ 5 is indeed an analytic set.
To establish the validity of assertion (2), a more delicate argument is needed. The 
fact that, for any ordinal a < w1, the set 5a is nonempty readily follows from the 
universality of D in the class of all at most countable linearly ordered sets. Further, 
we have the trivial equality
5a = {x e 5 : о(x) = a}.
So, we must show that 5a is Borel in C. This can be done by using the method 
of transfinite induction on a. All necessary details of the inductive reasoning are 
contained in Exercise 6.4. 
□
Remark 6.8 As we already know, the Cantor space Е = C equipped with its canon­
ical sieve {Ct : t e D } can be written in the form
Е = и{Е,- : t e I}, 

82
6 Borel Isomorphisms of Analytic Sets
where I denotes the family of all ordinal types of at most countable linearly ordered 
sets and, for each i e I, the set Ef consists of all those points x e E whose 
corresponding set Dx is of order type i. If i e I coincides with some ordinal number 
a < ш1, then we have Ef = 5a and, according to Lemma 6.7, Ef turns out to be a 
nonempty Borel subset of E. In this connection, it has been established by D. Scott 
that all sets Ef (i e I) are Borel in E, too (cf. [111]). Of course, Scott’s result 
essentially strengthens assertion (2) of Lemma 6.7, but we do not need it in our 
further considerations.
Lemma 6.9 For a Polish space E, the following two statements hold true:
(1) every analytic set A c E is sifted by an appropriate Luzin sieve {Wt : t e D}, 
where all Wt (t e D) are closed subsets of E;
(2) if {Wt : t e D } is a Luzin sieve, all members of which are closed sets in E, then 
the set sifted by {Wt : t e D } is analytic in E.
The proof of this lemma is outlined in Exercise 6.5 of the present chapter.
Lemma 6.10 Let E be a Polish space, let {Wt : t e D} be a Luzin sieve in E, all 
elements of which are closed subsets of E, and let S and S a (a < u1) be the subsets 
of described in Example 6.6.
Define a function ф : E ^ C as follows:
for any point x e E, consider the set Dx = {t e D : x e Wt} and put
ф (x) = {ti,t2,...,t к,...},
where tk = 1 if x e Wr(к) and ф(х) = 0 if x ф Wr(k).
If A denotes the set in E sifted by {Wt : t e D} and {Ua : a < u1} is the 
decomposition of E \ A into constituents, then:
(1) 
ф is a Borel function;
(2) for each ordinal a < ш1, the equality Ua = ф- (Sa) holds;
(3) A = ф~1 (C \ 5) and E \ A = ф- (5).
The proof of Lemma 6.10 is not difficult and is left to the reader.
Lemma 6.11 S is a proper co-analytic subset of the Cantor space C.
Proof In Lemma 6.10 take E = C. As is known (see, e.g., [29, 74, 111, 119, 130] 
or Appendix B of this book), there exists a proper analytic subset A of E, i.e., the 
set E \ A is not analytic and, consequently, is not Borel. In accordance with (3) of 
Lemma 6.10, we have the equality
E \ A = Ф-(5).
Suppose for now that 5 is an analytic set in E. Then, keeping in mind the fact that 
ф is a Borel mapping (see (1) of Lemma 6.10), we get that E \ A is an analytic 
set, too, which yields a contradiction. So 5 is not analytic and, simultaneously, is 

6 Borel Isomorphisms of Analytic Sets
83
the complement of the analytic set C \ S (in view of Lemma 6.7). Therefore, 5 is a 
proper co-analytic set.
This completes the proof of Lemma 6.11. 
□
Obviously, Lemma 6.11 can be reformulated in another (equivalent) form. 
Namely, we may say that the co-analytic set 5 = {x e C : о (x) < ш1} is not 
analytic in the Cantor space C.
The next lemma is due to Luzin and reveals a deep property of constituents of 
co-analytic subsets of Polish spaces. This property found various applications in 
descriptive set theory (see, e.g., [111]).
Lemma 6.12 Let E be a Polish space and let A and A' be two analytic subsets ofE 
such that А П A' = 9.
Then, for the canonical decomposition E \ A = U{Ua : a < ш1} into constituents, 
there exists an ordinal fl < ш1 such that A' c U{Ua : a < fl}.
Proof Suppose otherwise, i.e., А’ П Це + 0 for arbitrarily large fl < Ш1. Then we 
may write the equivalence
a < Ы1 « (3у e A')(a < о(у)),
whence it follows that
S = {x e C : о(x) < wi} = {x e C : (3у e А')(о(x) < о(у))}.
The latter formula enables us to infer that 5 is an analytic subset of C (see Exercise 
6.7), which contradicts Lemma 6.11.
The obtained contradiction finishes the proof. 
□
Remark 6.13 As is known, in the Euclidean plane R2 there exists a universal analytic 
set A (see Appendix B). More precisely, this A is analytic in R2 and, for every analytic 
set A0 c R, a point x0 e R can be found such that
Ao = {у e R : (хо,у) e A}.
In particular, all Borel subsets of R can be realized as appropriate vertical sections 
of A. From this we immediately obtain that A contains in itself linear (vertical) 
Borel subsets of arbitrarily high Baire orders. Note that the set R2 \ A also possesses 
the last property, namely, R2 \ A contains in itself linear (vertical) Borel subsets 
of arbitrarily high Baire orders. From this fact it is not hard to deduce that in the 
canonical decomposition
R2 \ A = U{Ua : a < ш1}
there are uncountably many uncountable constituents. Actually, this conclusion is 
implied by Luzin’s Lemma 6.12 (for more details, see Exercises 6.8 and 6.9).

84
6 Borel Isomorphisms of Analytic Sets
It is time to remind the reader that in Godel’s Constructible Universe L there 
exists an analytic subset A of R whose complement is uncountable, but contains no 
nonempty perfect set (equivalently, R\A is uncountable, but contains no uncountable 
Borel set).
We thus infer that the co-analytic set R \ A is absolute null (universal measure 
zero) and all of its constituents are at most countable.
This enables us to give a proof of the following result first obtained by A. Maitra 
and Cz. Ryll-Nardzewski [121].
Theorem 6.14 Let A1 be an analytic subset of R2 universal for all analytic sets in 
R, and let A2 be an analytic subset of R whose complement is uncountable but does 
not contain an uncountable Borel set in R.
Then there exists no Borel isomorphism between A1 and A2.
Proof Suppose otherwise, i.e., there exists at least one Borel isomorphism f : A1 ^ 
A2. According to Lavrentiev’s theorem, there is a Borel isomorphism
f * : Zi ^ Z2
which extends f and for which Z1 is a Borel subset of R2 containing A1 and Z2 is 
a Borel subset of R containing A2. Clearly, the restriction of this /* to Z1 \ A1 is a 
Borel isomorphism between the two sets Z1 \ A1 and Z2 \ A2.
Consider now the co-analytic set R2 \ A1 with its canonical representation via 
constituents:
R2 \ A1 = U{Ua : a < ш1}.
Keeping in mind the obvious inclusion
R2 \ Z1 c R2 \ A1
and the fact that R2 \ Z1 is a Borel subset of R2 , we deduce by virtue of Lemma 6.12 
that there exists an ordinal /3 < ш1 satisfying the relation
R2 \ Zi c U{Ua : a < 3}.
At the same time, we know that among the constituents Ua (a < Ш1) there are 
uncountably many uncountable members. The latter implies at once that there exists 
an ordinal > 3 for which the set U is uncountable. Taking into account the trivial 
inclusion Uv c Z1 \ A1, we get
f *(U„)c Z2 \ A2 c R \ A2.
Remembering that f* is a Borel isomorphism, we conclude that f*(U^) is an 
uncountable Borel subset of R \ A2, which contradicts the definition of the analytic 
set A2.
The obtained contradiction ends the proof of Theorem 6.14. 
□

6 Borel Isomorphisms of Analytic Sets
85
Remark 6.15 The argument presented above shows us that the same result remains 
true in a more general situation. Namely, if A1 c R2 is an analytic set such that there 
are uncountably many uncountable constituents of the set R2 \ A1, and if A2 is as in 
Theorem 6.14, then there exists no Borel isomorphism between A1 and A2.
Summarizing, we may say that in certain models of ZFC set theory there are 
uncountable analytic subsets of Polish topological spaces which are not Borel iso­
morphic.
Recall that a Borel mapping from a Borel subset of a Polish space 
into a
Borel subset of a Polish space can be described as a mapping from 
into
whose graph is a Borel subset of the product space E x F.
Analogously, a projective mapping from a projective subset of a Polish space 
E into a projective subset of a Polish space F can be defined as a mapping from 
into whose graph is a projective subset of the product space E x F .
Problems similar to the question considered in the present chapter have been stud­
ied for other kinds of proper projective subsets of Polish spaces, and the existence of 
projective isomorphisms between such subsets has been established under appropri­
ate hypotheses concerning large cardinals. For more details, see e.g. [123, 124], and 
Exercise 6.13. Note also that if there exists a two-valued measurable cardinal, then 
all uncountable analytic sets in R turn out to be Borel isomorphic (see [7, 161]).
Exercises
6.1 Let E and F be two complete metric spaces and let h : X . Y be a homeomor­
phism, where c E and c F .
Show that there exists a homeomorphism h* : X* . Y* such that:
(a) 
X c X* and Y c Y*;
(b) 
h* is an extension of f;
(c) 
X* is a G s-subset of E and Y* is a G $-subset of F.
For this purpose, argue analogously to the proof of Theorem 6.3.
The result formulated above is widely known as Lavrentiev’s theorem on exten­
sions of homeomorphisms.
6.2 Let X be a metric space, Y be a Polish topological space, and let f : X . Y be 
a partial Borel mapping.
Show that there exists a partial Borel mapping f * : X . Y which extends f and 
whose domain is a Borel subset of X.
For this purpose, first take into account the fact that in this situation the given f is 
a Baire measurable partial function. Then argue by transfinite induction with respect 
to the Baire order of f. In particular, if the Baire order of f is equal to 0, then f is 
continuous, so Lemma 6.1 implies the desired result. Further, if one has
f (x) = Hm, .....fn(x) 
(x e dom( f)), 

86

where the Baire orders of all partial functions fn (n e N) are strictly less than the 
Baire order of f, then use the inductive assumption for each fn and define a Borel 
extension of f whose domain is a Borel set in X.

* Take the Cantor space C = {0,1}N\{0} and, for every natural number i > 0, 
define a function h(i) : C ^ C by the following formula:
if n e N \ {0} and x e C, then
(h(i)(x))n = 1 ^ (x„ = 1 & r(i) <iex r(n)).
Check that:
(a) all h (i) are continuous functions (hence, all of them are Borel functions);
(b) for any i e N \ {0} and for each element x e C, the equality
Dh(i) (x) = Dx ^ {t e D : Г (i) <lex t}
holds true.
Deduce from the above equality that if the set Dx is well-ordered with respect to 
>lex, then the sequence
о(h(1)(x)), о(h(2)(x)),..., о(h(г)(х)), ...
consists of all those ordinal numbers which are strictly less than о (x).
Finally, keeping in mind the preceding facts and using the method of transfinite

be an А-system in E such that:
(a) all sets P(s(1),s(2),...,s <„)) are closed in E;
(b) P(s(1),s(2),...,*(n),s(n+1)) c P(S(1),s(2),...,s(„)) for any x e (N \ {0})N\{0} and for 
each natural number n > 0.
For every element t e D , there is a uniquely determined finite sequence of nonzero 
natural numbers (m(1), m(2),..., m(n)) having the following property: if i e N\{0}, 
then

tj = 1 « i 6 {m(1), m(1) + m(2),..., m(1) + m(2) + • • • + m(и)}.
Define the set Wt by the equality
Wt = P(m(1),m(2),...,m(n)).
So the family of sets {Wt : t 6 D} forms a Luzin sieve in E. Further, introduce the 
notation:
X = the set in E obtained by the А-operation applied to the given A-system;
Y = the set in E sifted by the sieve {Wt : t 6 D}.
For these sets X and Y, establish the equality X = Y.
Argue as follows. By definition of X, one has
X = и{Л(1) n P(s(1),s(2)) П ... n P(s(1),s(2),...,s(„)) П ... : 5 6 (N \ {0})N\{0}}.
This means that, for any element x 6 X, there exists an 5 6 (N \ {0})N\{0} such that
X 6 Ps(1) n P(s(1),s(2)) n ... n P(s(1),s(2),...,s(n)) n ....
Starting with this 5, construct a strictly increasing (with respect to <lex) infinite 
sequence
{r(k1), r(к2),..., r(кn),...} c D
for which the relation x 6 n{W(t) : t 6 {r(кi),r(к2), ...,r(кn),...}} is satisfied. 
This implies the inclusion X c Y.
On the other hand, take any element у 6 Y. Since Y is sifted by {Wt : t 6 D}, 
there exists a strictly increasing (with respect to the same <lex) infinite sequence
{r(к 1), r(к2),..., r(кn),...} c D
such that у 6 n{Wt : t 6 {r(к 1), r(к2),..., r(кn),...}}. Since C is compact, there 
is an accumulation point t 6 C of {r(к1), r (к2),..., r(кn),...}. By using this t, try 
to find 5 6 (N \ {0})N\{0} for which
у 6 Ps(1) n P(s(1),s(2)) n ... n P(s(1),s(2),...,s(n)) n ....
Proceeding in this manner, obtain the inclusion Y c X and, therefore, the required 
equality X = Y.

equipped with the linear order >lex. Let ot (x) denote the order type of Dx and let 
ot() denote the order type of . According to the standard definition, the relation 
ot(x) < ot(y) means that there exists a strictly increasing mapping from Dx into Dy 
(so < turns out to be a certain pre-order in the family of all at most countable linear 
order types).
Show that the set
К = {(x, y) e E x F : ot(x) < ot(y)}
is analytic in the Polish product space E x F.
For this purpose, verify that the relation (x, y) e К is expressible by the formula
(Ba e CN)(3b e CN)((Vr)(r e Dx ^ (3n e N)(a„ = r)) &
(Vk e N)(bk e Dy) & (Vi e N)(Vj e N)(a,- >iex aj ^ bi >iex bj)).
Analyzing the logical structure of the above formula, conclude that it describes a 
concrete analytic subset of E x F.
6.8 Let E be a metric space and let X c E be a Borel set whose Baire (Borel) order 
does not exceed a, where a < ш1.
By using the method of transfinite induction, show that the Baire order of the set 
E \ X does not exceed a + 1.
6.9 Let A be a set in R2 such that its vertical sections give linear Borel sets of 
arbitrarily large Baire orders, and let В c R2 \ A be a Borel set in R2.
Check that the set R2 \ (А и В) has the same property, i.e., its vertical sections 
give linear Borel sets of arbitrarily large Baire orders.
For this purpose, use the result of Exercise 6.8.
Infer that if A is a universal analytic subset of R2, then there are constituents of 
R2 \ A of arbitrarily large Baire order (hence there are uncountably many uncountable 
constituents of R2 \ A).
6.10 Let E be a Polish topological space and let X be a nonempty subset of E which 
effectively (i.e., within ZF theory) is representable as the intersection ofa countable 
family of open sets in E .
Show that some point x e X can be effectively indicated.
Deduce from this fact that, within the framework of ZF theory, there exists a partial 
choice function defined on the family of all nonempty sets X of the above-mentioned 
type.
Conclude that the domain of such a partial choice function contains the family of 
all nonempty closed subsets of E .
6.11 Consider the canonical Baire space NN , which is linearly ordered with respect 
to the standard lexicographical order <lex.
Verify that in every nonempty closed subset of NN there is a <lex-least element 
(cf. Exercise 6.10).

* Prove the following result due to S. Mazurkiewicz:
Any analytic subset of a Polish topological space is a bijective continuous image 
of some co-analytic subset of the Baire space NN.
For this purpose, argue as follows. Let A be a nonempty analytic set in a Pol­
ish space and let f : NN ^ A be a continuous surjection. Consider the family 
{f -1 (a) : a e A} of nonempty closed sets in NN. For each a e A, denote by xa the 
<lex-least element of f—1 (a) (see Exercise 6.11).
Verify that the set X = {xa : a e A} is given in NN by the formula
x e X ^ (Vy)( f (x) = f (y) ^ x <iex y).
Finally, check that the above formula describes a certain co-analytic subset of NN 
and the restriction f |X is a bijection between X and A.
6.13 
* Let X and be two projective subsets of R.
Recall that a mapping f : X ^ Y is projective if the graph of f is a projective 
set in the plane R2 .
Suppose that X contains a topological copy of the Cantor space and Y also 
contains a topological copy of .
Show that there exists a projective bijection g : X ^ Y and conclude that g is a 
projective isomorphism between X and Y.
For this purpose, use an argument similar to the standard proof of the Cantor- 
Bernstein theorem.
Remark 6.17 We would like to recall here that the Axiom of Projective Determinacy 
(PD) implies the following fact:
Every uncountable projective set in R contains a homeomorphic image of.
Therefore, by assuming PD and referring to Exercise 6.13, one obtains that all un­
countable projective subsets of R are pairwise projectively isomorphic (cf. Theorem 
6.14).
6.14 
* Let E and F be two Polish spaces, A be an analytic subset of E, and let 
g : A ^ F be an injective Borel mapping.
Prove that g is a Borel isomorphism between A and g(A).
Use the following argument. First, observe that g(A) is an analytic set in F. It 
suffices to verify that, for every Borel subset В of E, the image g(В П A) is a Borel 
set in g(A). Define
A1 = g(В П A), 
A2 = g((E \ В)П A).
Then both sets A1 and A2 are analytic in F and do not have common points. By virtue 
of Luzin’s separation principle for disjoint analytic sets (see [29, 74, 111, 130]), there 
are two disjoint Borel subsets В1 and В2 of F such that А1 с В1 and A2 с В2. Check 
the equalities
A1 = В1 П g(A), A2 = В2 П g(A), 
from which the required result immediately follows.

6 Borel Isomorphisms of Analytic Sets
Remark 6.18 It is useful to compare the result of Exercise 6.14 with Mazurkiewicz’s 
theorem stating that any analytic set A in a Polish space is a bijective continuous 
image of some co-analytic set in the Baire space NN (see Exercise 6.12). Note 
that if A is uncountable, then X is uncountable, too, and X necessarily contains 
a nonempty perfect subset (so we have card() = c). On the other hand, we have 
already mentioned that the existence of an uncountable co-analytic set Y c R without 
any uncountable compact subset is consistent with ZFC theory (see [7, 68]). Clearly, 
for such a Y the equality card(Y) = ш1 holds true and Y is an absolute null space. 
In this context, we point out a result of [120], according to which if in ZF & DC 
theory there exists a Lebesgue nonmeasurable set belonging to the class E^ (R), then 
there exists an uncountable co-analytic set in R without any uncountable compact 
subsets. Shelah proved in [150] that ifin ZF & DC theory there exists a subset ofR 
with cardinality w1, then in the same theory there exists a Lebesgue nonmeasurable 
subset of R. The proof of the last implication is rather difficult (see also [91, 146]).
6.15 Verify that no proper co-analytic set in a Polish space can be a Borel image 
of a Bernstein subset of .
For this purpose, use Exercise 6.2.
6.16 Show that if {X^ : k e К} is a countable family of Luzin sets in R and, for 
every index k e К, a mapping fk : Xk ^ R possesses the Baire property, then the 
set u{ fk (Xk) : k e К} is absolute null in R.
6.17 * Two topological spaces 1 and 2 are called Borel comparable if either 
there exists a Borel isomorphism of 1 onto a subset of 2 or there exists a Borel 
isomorphism of 2 onto a subset of 1 .
If none of the above-mentioned Borel isomorphisms exist, then 1 and 2 are 
called Borel incomparable or, equivalently, the Borel types of 1 and 2 are called 
incomparable.
Assume the Continuum Hypothesis and let {X : e } be a family of Luzin 
subsets of R such that card(J) < c.
Prove that there exists a Luzin set X having the property that, for each index e , 
the sets X and X are Borel incomparable.
Argue as follows. Since c = ш1, one may identify J with ы1 and express the given 
family {Xj : j e J} in the form {X^ : % < ы1}.
Let {f ^ : % < ы1} denote the family of all Borel isomorphisms between the 
uncountable Borel sets in R and let {Pg : % < ы1} be the family of all nowhere 
dense closed subsets of R.
By using the method of transfinite recursion, define a certain injective 
ш1 -sequence {x^ : % < ы1} of points of R.
Suppose that the partial £-sequence {x: £ < £} of points of R has already been 
determined for an ordinal number % <ы1. Consider the set
Z^ = (u{f( (X^) : ^<^,1]<^}) u (u{f-(X„) : ^<^,1]<^}) 
u(u{PC : {<£})u({xc : ^<^}).

6 Borel Isomorphisms of Analytic Sets
91
Keeping in mind Exercise 6.16, deduce that Z^ + R, so there exists a point x e R\Zp. 
Then put xp = x.
Proceeding in this manner, obtain the required injective ш1 -sequence of points 
{xp : % < ы1} and then define X = {xp : % <ы1}.
Now, it follows from the construction of that:
(*) 
X is a Luzin subset of R;
(** ) for any two ordinal numbers a < ы1 and ft < ы1, the relations
card(/(Xg) n X) < ш, 
card(/a(X) n Xp) < ш
hold; in particular, the set X is Borel incomparable with each member of the 
family {Xg : % < ы1}.
6.18 Assuming that CH holds true, show that there exists a family {X : i e I} of 
Luzin subsets of R such that:
(a) card(I) > c;
(b) the sets X,- (i e I) are pairwise Borel incomparable.
For this purpose, use Exercise 6.17.
Try to extend this result to generalized Luzin subsets of R.
6.19 Let {Yk : к e К} be a countable family of Sierpinski subsets of R and let, for 
each к e К, a Borel mapping gk : Yk ^ R be given.
Show that the set u{gk (Yk) : к e К} does not contain an uncountable absolute 
null subset of R.
6.20 
* Assume CH and let {Y : e } be a family of Sierpinski subsets of R such 
that card() < c.
Prove that there exists a Sierpinski set Y having the property that, for each index 
e , the sets Y and Y are Borel incomparable.
To obtain the required result, take into account Exercise 6.19 and use an argument 
similar to the one presented in Exercise 6.17.
6.21 Assuming that CH holds true, show that there exists a family {X : i e I} of 
Sierpinski subsets of R such that:
(a) card(I) > c;
(b) the sets X,- (i e I) are pairwise Borel incomparable.
For this purpose, use Exercise 6.20.
Try to extend this result to generalized Sierpinski subsets of R.
Remark 6.19 Suppose that u1 < c and consider the <r-ideal I of all those subsets 
of R whose cardinalities do not exceed u1. It is clear that the members of I can be 
treated as small subsets of R. A question arises: what is the cardinality of the family 
of all Borel types corresponding to members of I ? In different models of ZFC set 
theory, we have different situations. For instance, if

92
6 Borel Isomorphisms of Analytic Sets
c = 2'
2"1
then the cardinality of the above-mentioned family is equal to c, so is strictly less 
than c+ . Moreover, as was shown by Martin and Solovay, there is a model of ZFC 
theory in which all subsets of R with cardinality w1 are co-analytic. In this model 
the equality c = 2"1 trivially holds true. In addition, according to a result of Laver, 
there is a model of ZFC in which there are at most c many absolute null subsets of 
R (hence at most c many Luzin subsets of R). In Laver’s model the above equality 
is trivially valid. Several deep consistency results concerning properties of absolute 
null subsets of R and of absolutely measurable subsets of R, under the negation of 
CH, may be found in [116] and [126] (see also references therein).

Chapter 7
Iterated Integrals of Real-Valued Functions of 
Two Real Variables
In this chapter, following the old work of Sh. Pkhakadze [142], we consider some 
real-valued functions of two real variables. These functions are not assumed to 
be measurable with respect to the two-dimensional Lebesgue measure A2 on the 
plane R2 , but they have the property that their corresponding iterated integrals exist 
and are equal to each other. Close connections of this property with certain purely 
set-theoretical aspects are highlighted.
We begin with the trivial remark that, according to the classical Fubini theorem, 
if a given function
f : [0,1]2 ^ R
of two real variables is bounded and Lebesgue measurable, then there exist both 
corresponding iterated integrals
[ ([ f (x,y)dx) dy, 
f ([ f (x,y)dy) dx,
00 
00
and the equality
[ ( [ f (x, y)dx^ dy = [ (f f (x, y)dy] dx 
00 
00
holds true. In fact, both sides of this equality are identical to the double Lebesgue 
integral, i.e., one has
1 1 if 1

f(x,y)dy dx = / 
/ f(x,y)dxdy.

On the other hand, it is also known that, for the existence of these iterated integrals 
and for their coincidence, the Lebesgue measurability of f is not necessary.

7 Iterated Integrals of Real-Valued Functions of Two Real Variables
Indeed, recall that many years ago Sierpinski was able to construct, by using the 
method of transfinite recursion, an injective function
ф : [0,1] ^ [0,1]
whose graph is thick (i.e., massive) in [0, 1]2 with respect to the Lebesgue measure 
22. This means that the graph of ф meets every Borel subset of [0,1]2 with strictly 
positive 22-measure (similar constructions are considered, for example, in [7], [51], 
[99] and [111]; cf. also Exercise 7.1). Now, treating the graph of ф as a subset 
of [0,1]2 and denoting by g its characteristic function, we see that g is not 22- 
measurable, but its iterated integrals do exist and both of them are equal to zero 
(consequently, they are equal to each other).
At the same time, assuming the Continuum Hypothesis, Sierpinski indicated a 
subset 5 of [0,1]2 satisfying the following properties:
(i) for every x e [0,1], the set 5 n ({x} x [0,1]) is at most countable;
(ii) for every y e [0,1], the set ([0,1]2 \ S) n ([0,1] x {y}) is at most countable.
Moreover, Sierpinski had established that the existence of a set 5 with the properties 
(i) and (ii) implies the Continuum Hypothesis (see, e.g., [155, 158]).
Thus, the Continuum Hypothesis is equivalent to the possibility of decomposing 
the unit square [0,1] 2 into two sets 5 and 5' = [0,1]2 \ 5 such that 5 meets each 
vertical line of the plane in countably many points and 5' meets every horizontal 
line of the plane in countably many points.
This remarkable decomposition of the square [0, 1]2 implies numerous nontrivial 
consequences and applications. For example, an analogous decomposition of the 
product set 1 x 1 , where 1 stands for the least uncountable cardinal, is possible 
within ZFC theory and yields, as a by-product, the classical result of Ulam [168] 
stating the non-real-valued measurability of 1 (cf. Exercise 7.13).
Remark 7.1 In a certain sense, one can say that the sets 5 and S' of Sierpinski’s 
decomposition are absolutely nonmeasurable with respect to the class of all those 
nonzero ^-finite diffuse measures on [0,1]2 for which the assertion of Fubini’s 
theorem is valid (see Exercise 7.3).
Now, denoting by h the characteristic function of 5 c [0,1] 2, we can readily 
verify that h admits both iterated integrals, but one of them is equal to 0 and the 
other is equal to 1. This fact shows that, in general, the existence of the iterated 
integrals does not imply their coincidence.
In view of the above circumstances, it makes sense to consider the class F of 
all those functions f : [0,1]2 ^ R for which the iterated integrals exist and are 
equal to each other. Clearly, F is a vector space over the field R of all real numbers. 
The study of F can be essentially reduced to the investigation of those subsets Z 
of [0,1]2 whose characteristic functions xz belong to F, i.e., for xz we have the 
equality
Yz(x,y)dx dy = 
yz(x,y)dy dx.

As far as we know, the first deep study of sets Z c [0,1]2 possessing the above­
mentioned property (*) was carried out in the work of Pkhakadze [142]. Namely, 
he extensively investigated the descriptive structure of such sets Z, in terms of their 
intersections with the vertical and horizontal straight lines of the plane R2 .
Let us denote by L the class of all those sets Z c [0,1]2 which have the property 
(*). It was pointed out in [142] that:
(a) L is a monotone class of sets, i.e., L is closed under unions of increasing se­
quences of its members and is closed under intersections of decreasing sequences 
of its members;
(b) L is closed under unions of disjoint countable families of its members;
(c) if {Zi,Z2} c L and Zi c Z2> then (Z2 \ Zi) e L;
(d) if all intersections of Z c [0,1]2 with the vertical and horizontal straight lines 
of R2 are open (respectively, closed) in those lines, then Z e L.
Moreover, it was established in [142] that, under the Continuum Hypothesis, there 
exists a set Z0 c [0,1]2 such that all vertical sections of Z0 are open, all horizontal 
sections of Zq are of type G $ and the iterated integrals for xz0 exist, but are not 
equal to each other (hence Z0 does not belong to L).
It follows from (a) and (d) that the set Z0, being of type G $ with respect to all 
vertical and horizontal straight lines in R2 , is not representable as the intersection of 
a sequence of sets which are open with respect to all vertical and horizontal lines.
In this context, one may treat the equality between the iterated integrals, corre­
sponding to the characteristic function of a subset Z of [0,1]2, as a certain invariant 
of descriptive properties of Z.
The work [142] also contains several other interesting results which still deserve 
to be examined and discussed from various points of view and, first of all, from the 
point of view of set-theoretical approaches to qualitative problems of mathematical 
analysis (cf., for instance, [51]). In particular, the following natural question arises:
Is it true that A U В e L whenever A e L and В e L ?
Surprisingly, this question was not considered in [142]. Nevertheless, the approach 
suggested and elaborated in [142] can be successfully applied in order to give a 
(partial) answer to the question. Namely, we are going to show below that, under 
the same Continuum Hypothesis (CH) or under the much weaker Martin’s Axiom 
(MA), this question can be answered negatively.
Our starting point is again Sierpinski’s above-mentioned decomposition of the 
square [0,1]2. Let A (= A1) denote the one-dimensional Lebesgue measure on the 
real line R. We will need two simple lemmas.
Lemma 7.2 Assume the Continuum Hypothesis.
Then, for any real number e [0, 1/2 [, there exist two subsets 1 and 2 of 
[0, 1]2 such that:
(1) the set C1 (x) = {у e [0,1] : (x, y) e C1} is at most countable for every
x e [0,1];
(2) the set C2 (x) = {у e [0,1] : (x, y) e C2} is at most countable for every
x e [0,1];

96
7 Iterated Integrals of Real-Valued Functions of Two Real Variables
(3) the set C^(y) = {x e [0,1] : (x, y) e C1} is closed in R for any у e [0,1] and 
Л (C*( y)) = r;
(4) the set C2 (y) = {x e [0,1] : (x, y) e C2} is closed in R for any у e [0,1] and 
Л (C2( y)) = r ;
(5) 
C1*(y) П C2*(y) = 0 for each y e [0,1].
Proof Consider the set 5 c [0,1]2 of the above-mentioned decomposition {5,5'} 
of [0,1]2. According to the definition of 5, for every point y e [0,1], the set 
5 П ([0,1] x {y}) is co-countable in the segment [0,1] x {y}, so
2(5 n([0,1]x{y})) = 1.
Consequently, there exist two closed sets
C1*(y)c pr1 (5 П([0,1]x{y})),
C2(y)c pr1 (5 n([0,1]x{y}))
satisfying the relations
C1*(y)n C2(y) = 0,
2 (C2( y)) = 2 (C2( y)) = r.
Now, let us define
C1 = U{q*(y)x{y} : y e [0,1]},
C2 = U{C2(y)x{y} : y e [0,1]}.
Then it is obvious that conditions (3), (4), and (5) are satisfied. Besides, from the 
definition of the sets C1 and C2, we have C1 c 5 and C2 c 5, whence it immediately 
follows that conditions (1) and (2) are also fulfilled.
The last remark completes the proof. 
□
Lemma 7.3 Assume again the Continuum Hypothesis.
Then, for any real number r e [0, 1 [, there exists a subset of [0, 1]2 such that:
(1) the set D*(y) = {x e [0,1] : (x, y) e D} is at most countable for every 
ye [0, 1];
(2) the set D (x) = {y e [0,1] : (x, y) e D} is closed in R for every x e [0,1] and 
A (D (x)) = r.
The proof of this proposition is very similar to the proof of Lemma 7.2, so is 
omitted here (start with the set 5' instead of 5 and argue analogously).
Theorem 7.4 Under the Continuum Hypothesis, there exist two subsets A and В of 
the square [0,1]2 both belonging to L and such that their union A U В does not 
belong to L.
Proof Fix a real number r e ] 0, 1/2 [. Let C1 and C2 be as in Lemma 7.2, and let D 
be as in Lemma 7.3. We put

A = C1 U D, В = C2 U D,
and we intend to show that A and В are the required sets. 
Indeed, for each point x e [0,1], we have
card(Ci (x)) < ш, 
card(C2(x)) < ш,
the set D(x) is closed, and A(D (x)) = r. These relations imply that
[ {[ Xa(x,y)dy)dx = f (f xb(x,y)dy)dx = r.

At the same time, for each point y e [0,1], we have
card(D*(y)) < ш,
the sets C1* (y) and C2 (y) are closed, and the equalities
A (C*( y)) = A (C2( y)) = r
are satisfied. Obviously, these relations imply that
[ ([ Xa(x,y)dx) dy = f (f Xb(v,y)dx) dy = r

and, consequently, both sets A and В belong to the class L.
Now, consider the set A U В. For any point x e [0,1], we may write
(A U В)(х) = C1 (x) U C2(x) U D(x).
Since C1 (x) and C2(x) are at most countable, D(x) is closed and A(D(x)) = r, we 
readily deduce
I / Xaub(v,y)dy dx = r. 
oo
Further, for each point y e [0,1], we may write
(A U В)*(y) = C2(y)U C2(y)U D*(y),
C2(y)n C2(y) = 0.
Since D*(y) is at most countable, C1*(y) and C2(y) are closed, and
A (C2( y)) = A (C2( y)) = r,
we easily infer that
A((A U В)*(y)) = A(C2(y) U C2(y)) = A(Q*(y)) + A(C2(y)) = 2r,

Theorem 7.4 has thus been proved.

Recall that F denotes the class of all those functions / : [0,1]1 2 ^ R which 
satisfy the equality
(1) h1 • h2 does not belong to F;
(2) inf(h1, h2) does not belong to F.
Proof Let A and В be as in Theorem 7.4. Consider the following two sets:
A' = [0,1]2 \ А, В' = [0,1]2 \ В.
It can easily be verified that
A'eL, B'eL, A’ n В' ^ L.
Indeed, to see this, it suffices to apply relation (c) indicated at the beginning of the 
chapter.
Now, let us put:
h1 = the characteristic function of A';
h2 = the characteristic function of В'.
Then we have the equalities
hi • h2 = inf(hi, h2) = XA'nB', 
which yield at once the desired result.

As mentioned earlier, F is a vector space over R, i.e., if f e F, g e F, and t e R, 
then
f + g eF, tf eF.
In this context, the next theorem is of some interest.
Theorem 7.5 Under the Continuum Hypothesis, there exist two functions hi and h2 
belonging to F such that:

Remark 7.6 As has already been mentioned, Theorems 7.4 and 7.5 are also valid 
under Martin’s Axiom (MA), which is significantly weaker than the Continuum 
Hypothesis (CH). Assuming MA instead of CH, the proofs of Theorems 7.4 and 
7.5 do not essentially change (actually, the argument remains almost the same). In 
addition, it should be noted that neither of these two theorems can be proved within 
ZFC set theory. This is an important corollary of a result of H. Friedman, which 
states that there is a model of ZFC in which, for every function
f : [0,1]2 ^ [0,1],
the existence of both iterated integrals for f necessarily implies the equality between 
them. Clearly, in such a model the negation of the Continuum Hypothesis holds 
true. In this context, see also [46], where certain axioms of symmetry are discussed 
which turn out to be closely connected with the negation ofCH and with the iterated 
integrals of real-valued functions of two real variables.
Exercises
7.1 Prove that there exists a function f : [0,1] ^ [0,1] whose graph intersects 
every Borel subset of [0, 1]2 satisfying the condition
card(pr1 ()) = c,
where c denotes, as usual, the cardinality of the continuum.
For this purpose, use the method of transfinite induction.
Deduce from the above result that the graph of f is 22-thick in the unit square 
[0,1]2 and, therefore, f is not measurable with respect to A1.
Using an analogous argument, prove that there exists an injective function 
ф : [0,1] ^ [0,1] whose graph is 22-thick in [0,1]2.
7.2 Prove that the existence of a Sierpinski partition of [0,1]2 implies the Continuum 
Hypothesis (CH).
7.3 Assuming CH, let M denote the family of the completions of all product mea­
sures j ® j, where j ranges over the class M([0,1]).
Verify that both members 5 and 5' of Sierpinski’s decomposition of [0,1]2 are 
absolutely nonmeasurable with respect to M .

* Check in detail the properties (a), (b), (c), and (d) of the class L introduced in 
this chapter.
7.5 Prove that, under CH, there exists a set Z0 c [0,1]2 having the following

(a) all vertical sections of Z0 are open in R;
(b) all horizontal sections of Z0 are of type G s in R;

(c) both iterated integrals of the characteristic function xz0 exist, but are not equal 
to each other.
Conclude that the set Z0 does not belong to the class L.
Remark 7.7 In connection with the previous exercise, let us underline once again 
the following. The set Z0, being of type G $ with respect to all vertical and horizontal 
lines in R2, is not representable as the intersection of a sequence of sets which are 
open with respect to all vertical and horizontal lines. So the equality between the 
iterated integrals, corresponding to the characteristic function of a set V c [0,1]2, 
may be treated as an invariant of descriptive properties of V.
7.6 Give a proof of Lemma 7.3.
7.7 Let a e [0,1] .A set Z c [0,1]2 is called a-homogeneous if, for any point 
x e [0,1], one has
A(Z n({x}x [0,1]) = a
and, for any point e [0, 1], one has
A(Z n([0,1] x{у}) = a.
Work within ZF &DC set theory and present a construction ofan a-homogeneous 
Borel (hence A2-measurable) subset of the unit square [0,1]2.
7.8 With the aid of AC show that, for any real number a e [0, 1], there exists an 
a-homogeneous set c [0, 1]2 which is nonmeasurable with respect to the 
Lebesgue measure Z2.
Conclude that the iterated integrals of the characteristic function xw exist and 
are equal to each other.
7.9 Define a function h : [-1,1]2 ^ R as follows:
h / 
I ху/((х'2 + у2)2) if (х,у) + (0,0)
h (х,у) =1 
0 
if (x, у) = (0,0).
Verify the following three assertions about h:
(a) 
h is of first Baire class, so is Borel (hence Lebesgue) measurable;
(b) 
h is not integrable in the Lebesgue sense;
_1 (/_1 h (х,у^^у = /_1 (/_1 h (xj^dx = 0.
Remark 7.8 In connection with the simple fact of Exercise 7.9, the classical example 
of G. Fichtengolz should be recalled. Namely, he proved that there exists a Lebesgue 
measurable non-integrable function ф : [-1,1]2 ^ R such that the equality
f b If ^ 
\ f ^ / f b 
\
ф (x, у)ёу dx = 
ф (х,у)ёх dу
holds, whenever -1 < a < b < 1 and -1 < c < d < 1.

7.10 Give an example of a Borel measurable non-integrable (in the Lebesgue sense) 
real-valued function on [0, 1]2 whose iterated integrals differ from each other.
7.11 
* Recall that a function f : R2 ^ R satisfies Caratheodory’s conditions if the 
following hold:
(1) for any x e R, the partial function f (x, •) of one variable is continuous;
(2) for any у e R, the partial function f (•, у) of one variable is Lebesgue measurable 
(i.e., 2-measurable).
Prove that:
(a) if f satisfies Caratheodory’s conditions, then f is Lebesgue measurable as a 
function of two variables (i.e., f is 22-measurable);
(b) if f satisfies Caratheodory’s conditions and g : R ^ R is Lebesgue measurable, 
then the superposition
x ^ f (x,g(x)) 
(x e R)
is also Lebesgue measurable;
(c) if f satisfies Caratheodory’s conditions and, for each point x e R, the symbol 
x(x) stands for the finite value sup{ f (x, у) : у e R}, then
x ^ s(x) 
(x e R)
is a Lebesgue measurable function (analogously, if f satisfies Caratheodory’s 
conditions and, for each point x e R, the symbol i (x) stands for the finite value 
inf{f (x, у) : у e R}, then
x ^ i (x) 
(x e R)
is a Lebesgue measurable function).
Argue as follows. The assertions (a) and (b) are not difficult to prove. To establish 
the validity of (c), fix any real number t and check that the set {x : s(x) < t} is 
Lebesgue measurable. Indeed, it is easy to see that
{x : s(x) < t} = {x : f (x, у) < t for all points у e R}.
On the other hand, one may write
{x : f (x, у) < t for all у} = {x : f (x, у) < t for all rational points у e R}
in view of the continuity of f with respect to the second variable у. Consequently, 
one gets
{x : f (x, у) < t for all rational points у e R} = n{{x : f (x, q) < t} : q e Q},
where Q denotes, as usual, the set of all rational numbers.

7 Iterated Integrals of Real-Valued Functions of Two Real Variables
Since f is Lebesgue measurable with respect to x, each set of the form 
{x : f (x,q) < t} is Lebesgue measurable. Further, since the intersection of countably 
many measurable sets is again measurable, one immediately obtains the Lebesgue 
measurability of the set {x : л(x) < t} and, simultaneously, the Lebesgue measura­
bility of the function
x ^ s (x) 
(x e R).
Finally, the case of the function
x ^ i (x) 
(x e R)
can readily be reduced to the previous case.
Remark 7.9 Needless to say, functions satisfying Caratheodory’s conditions play an 
important role in many branches of contemporary mathematics: functional analysis, 
differential equations, optimization theory, probability theory, etc.
7.12 Let f be a real-valued Lebesgue measurable function defined on the unit square 
[0,1]2. Suppose that, for any point x e [0,1], there exists
s(x) = sup{ f (x, y) : у e [0,1]}
and this supremum is attained by some e [0, 1].
Check that, in general, one cannot assert that the function
x ^ s(x) 
(x e [0,1])
is Lebesgue measurable.
For this purpose, take any Lebesgue nonmeasurable strictly positive function 
g : [0,1] ^ R and define f : [0,1]2 ^ R as follows:
f ( 
) _ f 0 
if (x, y) e [0,1]2 and у + 0
((x,yf |g(x) if (x, y) e [0,1]2 and у = 0.
This f is A2-measurable, because it is almost equal to zero on [0,1]2. Further, for 
each point x e [0,1], one has
s(x) = sup{ f (x, y) : у e [0,1]} = g (x) > 0.
Thus, the two functions
x ^ s(x), 
x ^ g(x) 
(x e R)
are identical and, consequently, s(x) is a Lebesgue nonmeasurable function.
Remark 7.10 The above example of f is interesting in view of the following. The 
function f just described satisfies these two conditions:
(i) for any x e [0,1], the partial function f (x, •) is continuous everywhere except 
at the single point = 0;

7 Iterated Integrals of Real-Valued Functions of Two Real Variables
103
(ii) for any nonzero у e [0,1], the partial function f (•, y) is constant, so is continu­
ous.
7.13 
* Deduce Ulam’s result on the non-real-valued measurability of1 as a conse­
quence of the existence of Sierpinski’s type partition {5,5'} of w1 x w1.
For this purpose, first show that the set 5 of such a partition belongs to the product 
^-algebra
A = P(wi) ®P(wi).
Then suppose that there exists a nonzero <r-finite diffuse measure p whose domain 
is P(a>1), consider the product measure p ® p on A and, applying Fubini’s theorem 
to p ® p and 5, obtain a contradiction.
7.14 Show that if a Lebesgue measurable function f : [0,1]2 ^ R is not assumed 
to be Lebesgue integrable, then all of the following possibilities are realizable:
(a) none of the iterated integrals for f exist;
(b) one and only one of the iterated integrals exists;
(c) both iterated integrals exist, but differ from each other;
(d) both iterated integrals exist and are equal to each other.
Remark 7.11 In this context, it should be noted that if f : [0,1]2 ^ R is a bounded 
function (not necessarily Lebesgue measurable) and both its iterated integrals exist 
in the Riemann sense, then they are equal to each other (see, for instance, [99]).
7.15 Let F denote again the family of all those functions f : [0,1]2 ^ R for which 
both iterated integrals exist and are equal to each other.
Check that if one has a pointwise convergent sequence {fn : n e N} of functions 
from F and
(V« e N)(|/„| < ф)
for some fixed non-negative Lebesgue integrable function ф : [0,1]2 ^ R, then the 
function f = limn^TC fn also belongs to F.
7.16 Give an example of a function f e F such that f2 ф F.
For this purpose, keep in mind the proof of Theorem 7.5 and take any two 
functions h1 and h2 satisfying the relations
h1 e F, h2 e F, h^ = h1, 
h2 = h2, h1 • h2 ф F.
Further, put f = h1 + h2 and show that f is as required.

The Steinhaus Property, Ergodicity, and Density 
Points
According to the classical Steinhaus theorem [163], if A is the Lebesgue measure on 
R and X is a 2-measurable set in R of strictly positive 2-measure, then the difference 
set
X - X = {x - x' : x e X, x' e X}
is a neighborhood of zero in R, so X - X has a nonempty interior. At present, it 
is known that there are certain analogs of the Steinhaus theorem in the much more 
general settings of locally compact groups equipped with the Haar measure (see, 
for instance, [58, 62]) and of the so-called standard groups. In the latter case, the 
fundamental Mackey-Weil theorem concerning a characterization of ^-finite quasi­
invariant Borel measures on standard groups should be mentioned (see, e.g., [137, 
Chapter 10] or [90]). Also, it has been proved that if, for a regular Borel measure 
on a ^-compact locally compact topological group (G, •), an analog of the Steinhaus 
theorem holds true, then is absolutely continuous with respect to the Haar measure 
on G (see [58]). In addition, a number of nontrivial applications of the Steinhaus 
theorem to the theory of functional equations and functional inequalities can be 
found in [107]. Many facts and statements closely connected with the Steinhaus 
theorem are discussed in the recent extensive survey by A. Ostaszewski [135].
Here we are going to show that there are some translation-invariant extensions of 
the Lebesgue measure on R for which the natural analog of the Steinhaus theorem 
fails very strongly. More precisely, our goal is to show that there exists a measure 
on R which extends A, is invariant under the group of all translations of R, and for 
which there is a -measurable set X with (X) > 0 such that both sets X - X and 
X + X are totally imperfect in R. Needless to say, the construction of is heavily 
based on an uncountable form of the Axiom of Choice (AC), because in the domain 
of there are many non-Lebesgue measurable subsets of R.
Nowadays, there exist several methods for constructing translation-invariant mea­
sures on R that extend A. In this connection, see [24, 25, 27, 63, 64, 71, 76, 78, 82, 
87, 91, 94, 102, 103, 106, 139, 140, 143, 164, 165, 171] and especially [172], where 
an extensive list of references is also presented. Perhaps the best known works in this 
direction are [71] and [103], in which nonseparable translation-invariant extensions

of Л are constructed (cf. [47], where a certain nonseparable extension of Л is treated 
as “definable”).
In this chapter it will be shown how the Steinhaus property and ergodicity of 
a translation-invariant extension v of Л depend on points of the measure-theoretic 
density of -measurable sets. Further, a connection of the Steinhaus property with 
almost convex sets will be considered and a translation-invariant extension of Л will 
be presented, for which the generalized Steinhaus property together with mid-point 
convexity do not imply almost convexity.
Recall that a set Z c R is said to be totally imperfect in R if Z contains no 
nonempty perfect subset of R. Recall also that a set В c R is a Bernstein subset of 
R if both and R \ are totally imperfect in R.
Let E be a ground set and let G be a group of transformations of E.
A G-quasi-invariant measure v on E is called metrically transitive with respect 
to G (or ergodic with respect to G) if, for any -measurable set with () > 0, 
there exists a countable family {gf : i e I} c G such that
V(E \^{gi(X) : i e I}) = 0.
For example, the Lebesgue measure Л on R is ergodic with respect to any every­
where dense subgroup of (R, +) (for a more general result, see Exercise 8.1).
Let (G, +) be a commutative group (as a rule, G will be identified with the group 
of all its translations).
Recall that a central symmetry of G is a transformation sh of the form
sh(g) = 2h - g (g e G),
where h is a fixed element of G (the center of the symmetry sh).
If h = 0, then we have the central symmetry s0 with respect to the neutral element 
(= 0) of G.
The symbol SG denotes the group generated by s0 and all translations of G .In 
fact, SG is generated by any single central symmetry of G and all translations of G.
We shall say that a measure V on a commutative topological group (G, +) 
possesses the classical Steinhaus property if, for each V-measurable set X with 
V ( X) > 0, the difference set X - X has a nonempty interior.
So, by virtue of the Steinhaus theorem [163], Л possesses the classical Steinhaus 
property, and this remarkable fact admits an appropriate analog for the Haar measure 
on a <r-compact locally compact group.
Let us recall a well-known (and more general) result which is similar to the 
classical Steinhaus property of Л:
If X and Y are any two Л-measurable subsets of R such that Л(X) > 0 and 
Л(Y) > 0, then the set
X + Y = {x + у : x e X, у e Y}
has a nonempty interior.

8 The Steinhaus Property, Ergodicity, and Density Points
107
Motivated by the above result, we shall say that a measure on a commutative 
topological group (, +) possesses the generalized Steinhaus property if, for any 
two -measurable sets and with () > 0 and ( ) > 0, the set + has a 
nonempty interior.
It turns out that, for a large family of measures on (, +), the classical Steinhaus 
property and the generalized Steinhaus property are equivalent.
Theorem 8.1 Let (, +) be a commutative topological group and let be a measure 
on (G, +) quasi-invariant with respect to Sg and ergodic with respect to the group 
of all translations of .
Then the following two assertions are equivalent:
(1) possesses the generalized Steinhaus property;
(2) possesses the classical Steinhaus property.
Proof Suppose (1) and let be a -measurable subset of G with () > 0. Then, 
by virtue of the Sg-quasi-invariance of p, we may write p (-X) > 0. Putting Y = -X 
and applying (1) to and , we obtain that the set
X -X = X+ (-X) = x+y
has a nonempty interior, so (2) is fulfilled. In fact, the quasi-invariance of with 
respect to 0 and the generalized Steinhaus property of imply the classical Steinhaus 
property of .
Now, suppose (2) and take any two -measurable sets X and Y with (X) > 0 
and p(Y) > 0. Again, in view of the Sg-quasi-invariance of p, we get p(-X) > 0. 
Further, using the ergodicity of with respect to the group of all translations of G , 
we can find an element g e G such that
p((-X)n(Y + g)) > 0.
Defining Z = (-X) П (Y + g) and applying to Z the classical Steinhaus property, we 
deduce that - has a nonempty interior. Finally, keeping in mind the relation
Z - Z = ((-X) П (Y + g)) + (X П (-Y - g)) c (Y + g) + X = (X + Y) + g,
we conclude that the set (X + Y) + g (hence the set X + Y) has a nonempty interior, 
so (1) is satisfied.
This yields the required result and completes the proof of Theorem 8.1. 
□
Remark 8.2 We would like to emphasize that the above argument does not rely on 
any specific features of the topology of G or on any regularity topological properties 
of p. Actually, the argument is purely algebraic. Consequently, Theorem 8.1 admits a 
straightforward extension to certain measures given on commutative groups which, 
in general, are not endowed with a topology (or, if one prefers, are endowed with the 
discrete topology). We present such a generalization here.

108
8 The Steinhaus Property, Ergodicity, and Density Points
Let (, +) be a commutative group and let F be a translation-invariant family of 
nonempty subsets of . We shall say that a measure on possesses the classical 
Steinhaus property with respect to F if, for every p-measurable set Z c G with 
() > 0, the difference set - contains a member of F. Also, we shall say that 
a measure on G possesses the generalized Steinhaus property with respect to F 
if, for any two -measurable sets and with () > 0 and ( ) > 0, the sum 
set + contains a member of F. Let now be a measure on G quasi-invariant 
with respect to the group Sg and metrically transitive with respect to the group of 
all translations of G . Then the classical Steinhaus property of with respect to F is 
equivalent to the generalized Steinhaus property of with respect to F. The proof of 
this slightly more abstract fact remains essentially the same as the proof of Theorem 
8.1. Moreover, the commutativity of the original group (G, +) is not essential and 
the generalized version of Theorem 8.1 remains true for non-commutative groups, 
too (of course, under an appropriate reformulation of Theorem 8.1). Other results 
similar to Theorem 8.1 or closely connected with it are considered, for example, in 
[12, 65, 93, 131, 135]. Note that in these works some topological concepts are used 
and corresponding regularity properties of invariant measures are supposed.
To continue, let us recall several definitions which are needed to formulate the 
main results of this chapter.
Let p be a measure on R" extending the standard Lebesgue measure An, let 
X e dom(p), and let d e [0,1].
It is natural to say that X has upper p-density d at a point x e R" if
limsup,. ...p(X П C6(x))/p(C6(x)) = d,
where C$ (x) stands for the n-dimensional cube in R" with center x and diameter 5.
If the stronger condition
lim6.op(X П Cs (x))/p(Cг (x)) = d
holds, then we say that X has p-density d at x.
In the latter case, for d = 1, we get the ordinary p-density point x of X.
The classical Lebesgue theorem states that if Y is an arbitrary Immeasurable set 
in R", then An-almost all points of Y are its An-density points (see, e.g., [99]).
According to the Steinhaus theorem [163], if Z is a An-measurable set in R" of 
strictly positive An-measure, then the difference set
Z - Z = {x - у : x e Z, у e Z}
is a neighborhood of zero in R", so Z - Z has a nonempty interior.
As mentioned earlier, various aspects of the Steinhaus theorem and its general­
izations have been considered in many works. Actually, this theorem can easily be 
deduced from the Lebesgue theorem on Zn-density points (cf. [99]).
The following theorem illustrates a slightly more general fact.

8 The Steinhaus Property, Ergodicity, and Density Points
109
Theorem 8.3 Let p be a measure on R" extending An and invariant under the group 
of all translations of R", and let X be a p-measurable set having upper p-density 
d > 1/2 at some point x e R".
Then the difference set X - X is a neighborhood of zero of R".
Proof Since d > 1/2, there is a real s > 0 such that d > 1/2 + s/2. Since X has 
upper p-density d at x, we may choose a cube C(x) with center x which satisfies the 
inequality
p(X П C(x)) > (1/2 + £/2)p(C(x)).
Further, let 5 > 0 be so small that
p(C(x) U (C(x) + h)) < (1 + s)p(C(x))
whenever h e R" and ||h|| < 5. Clearly, for all these h we may write
(X П C(x)) П ((X + h) П (C(x) + h)) с (X П (X + h)).
Assuming for a moment that (X П C(x)) П ((X + h) П (C(x) + h)) = 0 and keeping 
in mind the translation invariance of p, we get
p(C(x) U (C(x) + h)) > p(X П C(x)) + p((X + h) П (C(x) + h))
> 2(1/2 + s/2)p(C(x)) = (1 + s)p(C(x)),
which is impossible. Therefore, X П (X + h) + 0, and we conclude that X - X 
contains the ^-neighborhood of zero of R".
This completes the proof of Theorem 8.3. 
□
Remark 8.4 Actually, the assertion of Theorem 8.3 remains valid if there exist a 
point x e R" and a cube C (x) such that
p(X П C(x)) > (1/2)p(C(x)).
The proof of this fact is essentially the same.
A certain analog of Theorem 8.3 holds true for translation-invariant extensions 
of An in the context of their ergodicity.
Theorem 8.5 Let p be a translation-invariant extension of An such that any p - 
measurable set Z with p (Z) > 0 has p-density strictly greater than 1/2 at some 
point of R" (depending on Z).
Then the measure p is necessarily ergodic.
Proof The argument is quite similar to the proof of Theorem 8.3. Suppose to the 
contrary that p satisfies the condition of Theorem 8.5, but is not ergodic. This means 
that there exists a p-measurable set Z with p (Z) > 0 such that
p(Rn \ J{hу + Z : j e J}) > 0

110
8 The Steinhaus Property, Ergodicity, and Density Points
for any countable family {hj : j e J} c R". The latter implies that there is a 
countable family {g,- : i e I} c R" such that the set
X = J{gf + Z : i e I}
has the following two properties:
p (R" \ X) > 0,
(Vh e R”)(p(Xд(h + X)) = 0),
where Д denotes the operation of symmetric difference of two sets. Putting Y = 
R" \ X, we come to the partition {X, Y} of R" into two p-measurable sets such that
p (X) > 0, p (Y) > 0,
(Vh e R”)(p((h + X)дX) = 0), 
(Vh e R")(p((h + Y>Y) = 0).
Let x e R" be a point at which the set X has p-density strictly greater than 1/2 
and let у e R" be a point at which the set Y has p-density strictly greater than 1/2. 
There exists a cube С(x) with center x such that p(С(x) П X) > (1/2)p(С(x)) 
and there exists a cube С(у) with center у such that p(С(у) П Y) > (1/2)p(С(у)). 
Obviously, we may assume without loss of generality that С (у) is a translate of C (x), 
i.e., С(у) = h + С(x) for some h e R". Consequently, we get
p(С(у) П X) = p((h + С(x)) П (h + X)) = p(С(x) П X)
> (1/2)p(С(x)) = (1/2)p(С(у)),
whence it immediately follows that
p(С(у)) = p(С(у) П X)+ p(С(у) П Y)
> (1/2)p(С(у)) + (1/2)p(С(у)) = p(С(у)),
which yields a contradiction.
The obtained contradiction finishes the proof of Theorem 8.5. 
□
Now, we would like to present two examples of translation-invariant extensions 
of An which illustrate the fact that the constant 1/2 is precise in the formulations of 
both theorems proved above.
For this purpose, we need several auxiliary lemmas.
According to an old theorem of Sierpinski (see, e.g., [111, 113, 155]), if a given 
family {Xj : j e J} of subsets of an infinite ground set E is such that
card(J) < card(E), (Vj e J)(card(Xj) = card(E)),
then there exists a disjoint family of sets {Yj : j e J} such that
Yj c Xj, card(Yj) = card(E) 

8 The Steinhaus Property, Ergodicity, and Density Points
111
for all indices j e J.
Actually, this theorem of Sierpinski is a generalization of the well-known equality 
a2 = a, where a is any infinite cardinal number.
The following lemma can be treated as a certain algebraic variant of Sierpinski’s 
theorem for E = R", where R" is endowed with the structure of a vector space over 
the field Q of all rational numbers.
Lemma 8.6 Let n > 1 be a natural number and let {X,- : i e I} be a family of subsets 
of R" such that
card(I) < c, 
(V e I)(card(X,-) = c).
Then there exists a disjoint family {Yf : i e I} of subsets of R" satisfying:
(1) 
Yi c Xi for any index i e I;
(2) card(Yf) = c for any i e I;
(3) the set |J{Y,- : i e I} is linearly independent over the field Q of all rational 
numbers.
Proof The argument, using the method of double transfinite induction, is fairly 
standard, so we only sketch it for the case when I is of cardinality c.
We may assume that I is identified with the least ordinal a whose cardinality 
equals c, so the original family {X,- : i e I} can be written as {X^ : f < a}. Then 
we construct a double family of sets
{Y^ : f<!<a}
satisfying the following conditions:
(a) Yg^ c X% whenever f < । < a;
(b) if f < | < |' < a, then Y^ is a proper subset of Y^,л>;
(c) if f < f ’ < i] < a, then YП Y^>,л = 0;
(d) the set u{Y^ : f < |} is linearly independent over the field Q whenever । < a;
(e) card(Y^,v) < card(i) + ы whenever f < । < a.
The construction of {Y^ : f < । < a} is not difficult: for a fixed । < a, we first 
define a family {Y^ : f < £ < |} satisfying (a)-(e), then expand this family to 
{Y^ : f < £ < |}, preserving (a)-(e), and finally we use induction on |. Lastly, 
we put
Y^ = A Ls,/ : f < | < a} 
(f < a)
and obtain the desired result. 
□
From Lemma 8.6 one easily gets the following.
Lemma 8.7 There exists a disjoint family {Y,- : i e I} of subsets of R" satisfying the 
following conditions:
(1) card(I) = c;
(2) card(Y,-) = c for each index i e I;
(3) the set U{Y,- : i e I} is linearly independent over Q;

112

(4) for any nonempty perfect set P c R", there is an index i e I such that У с P.
Proof Let I be a set of cardinality c and let {Р,- : i e I} denote the family of all 
nonempty perfect subsets of R". Putting
{Xi : i e I} = {Pi : i e I}
and applying Lemma 8.6 to this {X : i e I}, we immediately obtain the required 
result. 
□
Let (T, +) stand for the ordinary circle group, i.e.,
T = Si = {(x, y) e R2 : x2 + y2 = 1},
and let T be identified with the commutative group of all rotations of S1 about the 
origin (0, 0) ofR2. We also assume that Tis endowed with the Haar probability mea­
sure (in fact, this coincides with the normalized translation-invariant Lebesgue 
measure on (T, +)).
According to the terminology adopted in [58], we shall say that a set Z c R" x T is 
(Л„ ® в)-thick if, for any closed set F c R" x T of strictly positive (Л„ ® 0)-measure, 
we have F n Z + 0.
Lemma 8.8 If n > 1, then there exists a group homomorphism
ф : (Rn, +) > (T, +)
satisfying the following two conditions:
(1) the graph of ф is a (An ® 0)-thick subset of R" x T;
(2) for every nonempty perfect set P c R", the equality ф (P) = T holds true.
Proof Consider the family {У,- : i e I} of Lemma 8.7. We may assume that 0 ф I. 
For each index i e I, the set Yt is of cardinality c and is linearly independent over the 
field Q. Let {У!-,1, Yt,2} be a partition of Yt into two sets, each of cardinality c, and let
Ф1 : Yi,i > T
be any bijection. Now, we apply the method of Kodaira and Kakutani [103] for 
defining a mapping
Фо : Jfe : i e I i > T
such that the graph of ф0 is a (An ® 0)-thick subset of R" x T. In fact, the argument 
in [103], based on the method of transfinite induction, yields that if a subset У of R" 
has a nonempty intersection with every nonempty perfect set in R", then there exists 
a mapping from У into T whose graph is (An ® 0)-thick in R" x T.
Since the family {У,- : i e I} is disjoint, we have a minimal common extension ф 
of all ф1 (i e I) and ф0, so dom(ф) = и{У : i e I}. Further, since и{У : i e I} 
is linearly independent over Q and (T, +) is a divisible commutative group, there 
exists a group homomorphism from (R, +) into (T, +) which extends ф (see, e.g., 

8 The Steinhaus Property, Ergodicity, and Density Points
113
[48, 62, 115]). Preserving the same notation ф for such a group homomorphism, we 
easily conclude that ф is as desired.
Lemma 8.8 has thus been proved. 
□
Now, take ф as above. Let us recall how starting with this ф, a certain translation­
invariant extension of the Lebesgue measure An can be constructed (cf. [103]).
For each set Z belonging to dom(2n ® в), we put
Z’ = {x e R" : (x, ф(x)) e Z}.
In fact, Z' is equal to the first projection of the intersection of the graph of ф and Z. 
Then we define
S = {Z' : Z e dom(An ® в)}.
A straightforward verification shows that the family S is a ^-algebra of subsets of 
R", invariant under the central symmetry and all translations of R". Moreover, we 
have the inclusion dom(2n) c S. Putting
j(Z') = (An ® в)(Z) (Z e dom(2„ ® в)),
it is not difficult to prove that this formula determines a well-defined measure on 
S which strictly extends the Lebesgue measure An and is invariant with respect to 
the central symmetry л0 of R" and with respect to all translations of R". Actually, 
this coincides with the image measure, under pr1, of the measure induced on the 
graph of ф by An ® в.
Before formulating the next theorem, let us recall once more that a subset of a 
topological space E is totally imperfect if there exists no nonempty perfect set in E 
which is entirely contained in .
Theorem 8.9 The measure constructed above is ergodic and there is a 
j-measurable set Z’ c R" such that:
(1) j (Z') = +c» and both sets Z’ - Z’ and Z’ + Z' are totally imperfect in R" (in 
particular, the classical Steinhaus property fails to be true for Z ’);
(2) at each point x e R", the j-density of Z’ at x is equal to 1/2.
Proof The ergodicity of j easily follows from the ergodicity of the product measure 
An ® в.
Identifying for a moment the circle group (T, +) with the interval ] - n,n\ of the 
real line R, consider the following two sets:
Z = R" x ] - я/2, я/2[, 
Z’ = {x e R : (x, ф(x)) e Z}.
We assert that the second set Z' is as required. For this purpose first observe that, by 
virtue of the definition of j, the relation
j (Z') = (An ® 0)(R" x ]- я/2, n/2 [) = +c» 

114
8 The Steinhaus Property, Ergodicity, and Density Points
holds. Further, since the set Z is symmetric in R" x T, the set Z’ is symmetric in 
R". Therefore, we have Z' - Z' = Z' + Z', and it suffices to demonstrate that the 
algebraic sum Z' + Z' is totally imperfect in R.
Suppose for now that Z' + Z' contains a nonempty perfect subset of R". Then, 
according to Lemma 8.8, there exists a z0 e Z' + Z' such that ф(z0) = я. It can 
readily be seen that, for each point z e R", the implication
z e Z' + Z' =x (z, ф(z)) e Z + Z
holds true. Consequently, we must have (z0, я) e Z + Z. But from the definition of 
Z it easily follows that no point of the form (z, я), where z e R", belongs to Z + Z. 
The obtained contradiction shows that the set Z' + Z' is totally imperfect in R".
Finally, take any point x e R" and any cube C (x) with center x. We may write
д(C(x) n Z') = (An ® в)((C(x) x T) n (R”x] - я/2,я/2[))
= (Лп ® в)(C(x) x ] - я/2,я/2[) = (1/2)2„(C(x)),
so the ^-density of Z' at each point of R" is equal to 1/2.
Theorem 8.9 has thus been proved. 
□
Remark 8.10 For the above measure , the following assertions hold:
(i) the homomorphism ф is a ^-measurable mapping;
(ii) there exists a -measurable set with exactly one -density point with respect 
to the standard Vitali system in R" (which consists of all closed n-dimensional 
cubes in R").
In connection with assertions (i) and (ii), see also [90, Chapter 8].
Remark 8.11 A result somewhat weaker than Theorem 8.9 can be obtained by 
applying the technique of Hamel bases in R". For the sake of simplicity, we restrict 
our consideration to the case n = 1, so in this case R" = R.
Recall that a Hamel basis in R is any maximal linearly independent (over Q) 
family of elements of R. By using a standard argument, it can be shown that there 
exists a set В c R satisfying the following three properties:
(a) 
1 e ;
(b) 
В is a Bernstein subset of R;
(c) 
В is a Hamel basis of R.
Denote by the vector space (over Q) generated by the family В \ {1} and observe 
that W is also a Bernstein set in R. Let S be the <x-algebra of subsets of R generated 
by {W} U dom(Z), and let {Wj : j e J} stand for the countable R-invariant partition 
of R canonically associated with W (actually, {W : e } = R/W). It is easy to 
check that
S = {U{Wj n Xj : j e J} : (Vj e J)(Xj e dom(2))}.

8 The Steinhaus Property, Ergodicity, and Density Points
115
Now, fix a family {rj : j e J} of strictly positive real numbers such that 
£{rj : j e J} = 1 and, for every element U{Wj n Xj : j e J} of S, put
v(U{Wj n Xj : j e J}) = £{r72(Xj) : j e J}.
A straightforward verification shows that the functional is a measure on R with 
dom(v) = S such that:
(1) v extends A;
(2) 
v is quasi-invariant under the group of all isometric transformations of R;
(3) 
v is ergodic with respect to the group of all translations of R;
(4) 
W e dom(v) and v(W) = +c»;
(5) 
W = W + W = W - W, so both W - W and W + W are totally imperfect in R.
In particular, the last item indicates that for v the classical Steinhaus property fails 
very strongly.
Remark 8.12 There is a wide class of measures on R" which are translation-invariant 
extensions of An and which still possess the Steinhaus property. Such measures can 
be obtained, for example, by using Marczewski’s method (see [82, 90, 164, 165]).
The next lemma is due to Sierpinski and is well known.
Lemma 8.13 If n > 1, then there exists a partition {A, B'} of R" such that:
(1) for any closed set F c R" with An (F) > 0, both sets F n A and F n B are of 
cardinality continuum (in particular, both of them are An-thick in R");
(2) for each vector h e R", one has
card((h + А)дA) < c, 
card((h + В)дВ) < c,
i.e., the sets A and В are almost invariant under the group of all translations of 
Rn.
For a proof of Lemma 8.13, see, e.g., [82] or Exercise 8.10.
Theorem 8.14 If n > 1, then there exists a translation-invariant measure /j. on R" 
extending An and satisfying the following three conditions:
(1) is not ergodic;
(2) for any -measurable set with () > 0, the -density of at -almost all 
points of is greater than or equal to 1/2;
(3) there exists a ц-measurable set A with /j. (A) = +c» such that the /j. -density of A 
at all points of R" is equal to 1/2.
Proof Consider the ^-algebra S generated by the family
{A, B} U dom(An),
where {A, B} is a partition of R" with the properties indicated in Lemma 8.13. Any 
element Z of this <r-algebra is representable in the form

116
8 The Steinhaus Property, Ergodicity, and Density Points
Z = (A П X) U (В П Y),
where X and Y are some An -measurable sets in R". Putting
в (Z) = (1/2)(2„ (X)+ An (Y)),
we get a well-defined measure в on S which properly extends An.
Denoting by T the family of all those subsets of R" whose cardinalities are strictly 
less than c, we can uniquely extend to a translation-invariant measure defined on 
the ^-algebra generated by the family
{А, B} U dom(Zn) и T.
Actually, we simply enlarge the <x-ideal of all в-measure zero sets by adding to it 
all the members of Ti. For the sake of brevity, we denote the measure extended in 
this way by the same symbol . Clearly, this is not ergodic because the partition 
{А,В} of R" consists of two в-measurable and в-almost translation-invariant sets 
such that
в(A) = в(B) = +“.
Further, if Z is a в-measurable set of the form Z = (A n X) U (В n Y), where 
X e dom(Zn) and Y e dom(Z„), then, applying to X and Y the Lebesgue theorem 
on An-density points, it is not difficult to check that the в-density of Z at в-almost 
all points of Z is greater than or equal to 1/2. This gives us (2).
Finally, an analogous straightforward verification shows us that the в-density of 
A (and the в-density of B) at all points of R" is equal to 1/2. 
□
Remark 8.15 For n > 1, a measure v on R" can be constructed which satisfies the 
following four conditions:
(1) 
v extends An and is invariant under the central symmetry and all translations of 
R";
(2) 
v is ergodic;
(3) for any v-measurable set X with v(X) > 0, the v-density of X at v-almost all 
points of X is greater than or equal to 1/2;
(4) there exists a v-measurable set Y with v (Y) = +c» such that the v-density of Y at 
all points of R" is equal to 1/2.
A subset Z of the Euclidean space R" is called mid-point convex (or convex in 
the sense of Jensen) if, for any two points x and у from Z, the point (x + у)/2 also 
belongs to Z .
The notion of mid-point convexity has found numerous applications in the theory 
of functional equations and functional inequalities (see, e.g., [107]).
Every convex (in the usual sense) subset of R" is mid-point convex, but the 
converse assertion is false, as very simple examples show. However, if a mid-point 
convex set Z c R" satisfies some additional regularity assumptions, then it becomes 
possible to establish a certain property of Z which may be regarded as an ‘almost 
convexity’ of Z .

8 The Steinhaus Property, Ergodicity, and Density Points
117
We shall say that a set Z c R" is almost convex if Z can be represented in the 
form Z = V U Y, where V is an open convex set in R" and Y is some subset of the 
boundary of .
To give a simple example of a two-dimensional almost convex set which is mid- 
convex but is not convex, consider the unit square [0, 1]2 and remove from it the set 
([0,1] \ Q) x {0}. The set obtained after this operation is as required. Let us also 
remark that not every almost convex subset of R" is mid-point convex. For instance, 
the union of the open unit cube in R" (n > 2) with the set of all its vertices is almost 
convex but is not mid-convex.
Lemma 8.16 Let Z be a mid-point convex subset of the real line R satisfying these 
two conditions:
(1) some open interval ], [, where < , is entirely contained in Z;
(2) there is a point z e Z such that b < z.
Then the half-open interval ], ] is also contained in Z.
Proof Let = sup{ : 
< , ], [ c Z}. It suffices to show that > z. Suppose
to the contrary that < z and consider the line segment [, z] . Keeping in mind the 
mid-point convexity of Z, it can easily be seen that Z is everywhere dense in [, z] . 
Let z' e Z be such that
т < z', 
(a + z')/2 < т.
Then, using again the mid-point convexity of Z, we infer that the open interval
]a, (т + z')/2[ = ]а,т[ U ](a + z')/2, (т + z')/2[
is entirely contained in Z, which contradicts the definition of т.
The obtained contradiction ends the proof. 
□
Recall that a measure ^ on R" possesses the generalized Steinhaus property if, 
for any two -measurable sets and Y with () > 0 and (Y) > 0, their sum set
X + Y = {x + у : x e X, у e Y}
has nonempty interior.
It is known that the classical Steinhaus property of An implies the generalized 
Steinhaus property of An. For translation-invariant extensions of An, the analogous 
assertion is not true in general (see Remark 8.19 below).
Theorem 8.17 Let /j. be a measure on R" possessing the generalized Steinhaus 
property and let Z be a ц-measurable mid-point convex set in R" with /j. (Z) > 0.
Then the set Z is almost convex.
Proof The mid-point convexity of Z means that Z = (Z + Z)/2. Since possesses 
the generalized Steinhaus property, the set Z must have nonempty interior, i.e., Z 
contains some n-dimensional open ball (which is a nonempty convex set). Consider 
the family of all open convex subsets of Z partially ordered by the standard inclusion 

118
8 The Steinhaus Property, Ergodicity, and Density Points
relation. Applying to this family the Kuratowski-Zorn lemma, we get a maximal 
open convex set U contained in Z.
We now assert that the closure cl(^) of U contains Z. Suppose to the contrary 
that Z \ cl(U) + 0 and take any point z e Z \ cl(U). Using Lemma 8.16, we readily 
deduce that all line segments of the form [u,z], where и e U, are contained in Z. 
This shows us that the convex hull of the set U U {z} is also contained in Z, which 
contradicts the maximality of U.
Theorem 8.17 has thus been proved. 
□
Remark 8.18 Similarly to the above argument, it can be proved that if a second 
category set X c R" is mid-point convex and possesses the Baire property, then X 
is almost convex.
Remark 8.19 For n > 1, there exists a measure p on R" which satisfies these four 
conditions:
(a) 
p is an extension of An;
(b) 
p is invariant and ergodic with respect to the group of all translations of R";
(c) if Z e dom( ) , then -almost all points of Z are its -density points (conse­
quently, possesses the classical Steinhaus property);
(d) there exists a An-thick set A c R" such that
A e dom(p), p(R" \ A) = 0, (Vh e R")(card((h + А)дA) < c),
A U (—A) = R", A n(-A) = {0}, A + A = A = 2A.
The detailed construction of p is given in [82, Section 7] (see also Exercise 8.11 
below). It follows from (d) that p(-A) = 0, so p is not invariant with respect to the 
central symmetry л0 of R". Since - A is An-thick in R" and
(A + А) П (-A) = А П (-A) = {0},
the mid-point convex set A has empty interior, so p does not possess the generalized 
Steinhaus property. Further examples of translation-invariant measures for which the 
classical Steinhaus property is valid, but the generalized Steinhaus property fails to 
be true, may be found in [5, 104, 122].

* Prove that any partial homomorphism from a commutative group (G, +) into 
a divisible commutative group (, +) can be extended to a homomorphism from 
(G, +) into (, +).
For this purpose, argue as follows.
First, consider any partial homomorphism ф' : G ^ H extending ф. Let g be an 
arbitrary element of G \ dom(ф').
Show that ф' can be extended to a partial homomorphism ф” : G ^ H such that 
g e dom(0").
Only two cases are possible.
(a) 
kg e dom(ф') for some natural number к > 0.
In this case, one may assume, without loss of generality, that is the least natural 
number with property (a). Since H is divisible, there exists an element h e H 
satisfying the equality kh = ф’(kg). Put ф”(g) = h and prove that the latter equality 
determines a well-defined partial homomorphism ф” : G ^ H whose domain 
coincides with the group generated by dom(0') и {g}.
(b) 
kg ф dom(ф’) for all natural numbers к > 0.
In this case, pick an arbitrary element h e H and put ф”(g) = h. Then verify that 
this equality determines a well-defined partial homomorphism ф” : G ^ H whose 
domain coincides with the group generated by dom(0') и {g}.
Finally, apply the Kuratowski-Zorn lemma to obtain the required homomorphism
ф* : G ^ H
extending the initial partial homomorphism ф.

* Prove that, for every commutative group (G, +) , there exists a divisible com­
mutative group (G*, +) containing an isomorphic copy of (G, +).
For this purpose, consider the family {ф[ : i e I} of all homomorphisms of G 
into the commutative divisible circle group S1 and, using the result of Exercise 8.5, 
check that this family separates elements of G , i.e., for any two distinct elements 
g e G and h e G, there is an index i e I such that
Ф( (g) + Ф((h).
Then infer that the mapping ф = {ф{ : i e I} defined by
Ф(g) = {Фг (g) : i e 1}

conditions:
 8.6
(a) (G*, +) contains an isomorphic copy of (G, +) ;
(b) card(G*) < card(G) + w.
Argue as follows. According to the result of Exercise 8.6, there exists a divisible 
commutative group (, +) containing (G, +) as a subgroup. Construct by recursion 
an increasing (with respect to the standard inclusion relation) countable family 
{Gn : n < ш} of subgroups of H. First of all, put G0 = G. Suppose that, for a natural 
number n, the group Gn c H has already been defined. For any nonzero natural 
number k and for each element g e Gn, consider the equation kx = g in the group 
H. Since H is divisible, one has a solution x(k,g) of this equation in H. Take as 
G n+i the subgroup of H generated by the set
Gn u{x(k,g) : k e N \ {0}, g e Gn}.
Then verify that
card(G„+i) < card(Gn) + ы 
(n < ш).
Finally, let
G* = U{Gn : n<u}
and show that (G*, +) is a divisible commutative group, as desired.

such that /j.((t + X) П X) > 0 whenever t e U.

For this purpose, argue similarly to the Bernstein argument that yields the exis­

an enumeration of all vectors in R" and let {Fg : % < a} be an enumeration of all 
closed subsets of R" of strictly positive 2n-measure. Further, for any % < a, let H^ 
stand for the additive group generated by the family {h^ : £ < %}.

Measurability Properties of Я-Selectors and 
Partial Я-Selectors
Let be a ground set, be an uncountable group of transformations of , and 
let H be a countable subgroup of G. Suppose also that p is a nonzero ^-finite 
G-quasi-invariant measure defined on some G-invariant ^-algebra of subsets of
. In the present chapter we discuss two questions concerning the existence of 
-nonmeasurable H-selectors and the existence of -nonmeasurable partial H- 
selectors. In this context, the reader will be able to see below that there is an essential 
difference between the case of H-selectors and the case of partial H-selectors. We 
also solve a problem about Vitali-Bernstein selectors and partial Vitali-Bernstein 
selectors at the end of the chapter.
Consider the partition of canonically associated with the action of H in . As 
is known, this partition is formed by the family of all H-orbits of the points of .
We say that a subset X of E is an H-selector if X is a selector of the above­
mentioned partition.
Accordingly, we say that a subset of E is a partial H-selector if is a selector 
of some subfamily of this partition.
Clearly, assuming the Axiom of Choice (AC), every partial H-selector can be 
extended to an H-selector.
The question of the measurability of H-selectors (of partial H-selectors), with 
respect to a given nonzero ^-finite G-quasi-invariant measure p, arises naturally in 
many topics of mathematical analysis. In this context, we recall that the first result 
concerning the nonmeasurability of all H-selectors was obtained by Vitali in his 
work [169]. He considered the following special case:
E = the set of all real numbers (i.e., E = R);
G = the additive group of reals (R, +);
H = the additive group (Q, +) of rational numbers (as a countably infinite subgroup 
of (R, +)).
Vitali demonstrated that each Q-selector is nonmeasurable with respect to the stan­
dard Lebesgue measure A on R and, moreover, any such selector turns out to be 
nonmeasurable with respect to every measure on R which extends A and is invariant 
under the group (Q, +).

9 Measurability Properties of H-Selectors and Partial H-Selectors
This classical result of Vitali was generalized in various directions. In particular, 
some theorems and facts concerning measurability properties of -selectors, with 
respect to a nonzero ^-finite G-invariant (or G-quasi-invariant) measure j, were 
obtained in the works [28, 78, 84, 85, 90, 91, 159, 160, 172]. Note that the case 
where is an uncountable subgroup of the given group G was discussed in those 
works, too. However, in this chapter we only consider the case when card(H) < w.
First of all, let us remark that, even in the above-mentioned classical situation, we 
cannot assert the nonmeasurability of any Q-selector with respect to all nonzero a- 
finite translation-invariant measures on R. Indeed, in [91] a measure is constructed 
such that:
(1) v is defined on some ^-algebra of subsets of R;
(2) 
v is a nonzero non-atomic ^-finite measure;
(3) v is invariant under the group of all isometric transformations of R;
(4) dom(v) contains the family of all Lebesgue measurable subsets ofR;
(5) there exists a Vitali set (i.e., a Q-selector) belonging to dom(v) .
We thus conclude that, for the measure v and for the countably infinite group (Q, +), 
there exists a v-measurable Q-selector.
In connection with the above-mentioned result, it is reasonable to formulate the 
following general problem:
Let be a set and let G be an uncountable group of transformations of . Let 
j be a nonzero a -finite G-quasi-invariant measure defined on some G-invariant 
a-algebra of subsets of E, and let H be an arbitrary countable subgroup of the 
group G. Denote by {H (x) : x e E} the partition of E into H-orbits of points of 
E. Does there exist a subfamily of {H(x) : x e E} such that all selectors of the 
subfamily are nonmeasurable with respect to j?
Our goal is to show that, under some natural assumptions on E, G, and j, the 
answer to this question is positive.
We shall say that the group G acts almost freely on E with respect to a given 
measure j on E if, for any two distinct transformations g and h from G, the equality
j*({x e E : g(x) = h(x)}) = 0
holds true, where j* denotes, as usual, the outer measure associated with j.
Obviously, if a group G acts freely on E , then G acts almost freely on E with 
respect to any measure j on E.
Example 9.1 If E is a finite-dimensional Euclidean space, G is a group of affine 
transformations of E, and j is a measure defined on some <x-algebra of subsets of 
E and vanishing on all affine hyperplanes of E , then G acts almost freely on E with 
respect to j.
Our further considerations are essentially based on the following theorem, which 
generalizes a result obtained in [76].

9 Measurability Properties of H-Selectors and Partial H-Selectors
125
Theorem 9.2 Let E be a set, G be a group of transformations of E, and let p be 
a nonzero a -finite G-quasi-invariant measure on E. Suppose that G contains an 
uncountable subgroup Г acting almost freely on E with respect to p. Let H be a 
countable subgroup of Г and let {H (x) : x e E} be a partition of E into H-orbits.
Then there exists a subfamily of {H(x) : x e E} such that its union is a 
p-nonmeasurable set in E.
Proof We may assume, without loss of generality, that:
(a) 
p is a probability measure;
(b) the group Г coincides with the original group G ;
(c) card(G) = w1.
Denote by {gg : f < ш1} a family of elements of G such that
g^H П gcH = 0 
(f<ui,^<ui,f + f,),
U{g^H : f < ^i} = G.
The existence of such a family is obvious, because we have the relations
card(G) = w1, card(H) < w.
Since H is a countable group, we can express it in the form
H = {hn : n < ш}.
Let F be a subset of E for which the family {G(у) : у e F} is injective and 
consists of all G-orbits in E (in other words, F is a G-selector). Consider the family 
{H(у) : у e F} and put
Y = U{H(у) : у e F}.
If the set Y is nonmeasurable with respect to p, then there is nothing to prove. 
Suppose now that Y e dom(p). Then it is not hard to check that, for any two distinct 
ordinals f < w1 and ^ < w1, the inclusion
g^(Y) n g((Y) c gg (U{hn(Xnm) : n < ш, m < w})
holds true, where the set Xnm is defined by the formula
Xnm = {-Г e E : gГ hn C^) = gg hm (^)}.
But p* (Xnm) = 0, because G acts almost freely on E with respect to p and
gГ hn ^ g£ hm.
Taking into account the fact that p is a G-quasi-invariant measure, we obtain
p(gf(Y) n gC (Y)) = 0 

126
9 Measurability Properties of H-Selectors and Partial H-Selectors
for all % < ш1, £ < ш1, % + £. The latter relation implies the equality p (Y) = 0, 
since p (being a ^-finite measure) satisfies the countable chain condition, i.e., the 
Suslin condition.
Further, keeping this in mind and repeating the above construction ш1 many times, 
we can represent in the form
E = U{Y(, : a < Ш1},
where a family {Ya : a < w1} satisfies the following three conditions:
(1) the sets Ya (a < Ы1) are pairwise disjoint;
(2) for each a < ы1, the set Ya is the union of a family of H-orbits in E;
(3) for each a < ы1, the equality p(Ya) = 0 holds true.
According to the classical theorem of Ulam [168], there exists a subset A of ш1 
such that the set U{Ya : a e A} does not belong to dom(p). But it is clear that 
U{Ya : a e A} can be regarded as the union of a certain family of H-orbits in E, 
and so we obtain the required result.
Theorem 9.2 is thus proved. 
□
Now, we can easily deduce the following from Theorem 9.2.
Theorem 9.3 Let E be a set and let be an uncountable group of transformations 
of E. Let p be a nonzero a -finite G-quasi-invariant measure on E such that G acts 
almost freely on E with respect to p. Fix a countable subgroup H of and denote 
by {H (x) : x e E } the partition of E consisting of all H-orbits.
Then there exists a subfamily of {H(x) : x e E} such that all its selectors are 
nonmeasurable with respect to p.
Proof According to Theorem 9.2, there exists a subset of E such that the family 
{H(x) : x e D} is injective and the set U{H(x) : x e D} is nonmeasurable with 
respect to p.
We intend to demonstrate that all selectors of the family {H(x) : x e D} are 
p-nonmeasurable, too. Denote by Z any selector of {H(x) : x e D}. Obviously, we 
have the equality
U{H(x) : x e D} = U{h(Z) : h e H}.
Suppose for now that Z e dom(p). Then, taking into account the fact that H is a 
countable group and p is a G-quasi-invariant measure, we obtain
U{h(Z) : h e H} e dom(p)
and, consequently,
U{H(x) : x e D} e dom(p),
which contradicts the definition of {H(x) : x e D}.
This contradiction finishes the proof of Theorem 9.3. 
□

9 Measurability Properties of H-Selectors and Partial H-Selectors
127
Remark 9.4 It is essential for the validity of Theorem 9.3 that the partition 
{H(x) : x e E} of the ground set E consists of all H-orbits, where H is a countable 
subgroup of the original transformation group . In order to demonstrate this, let 
us take an arbitrary group G such that card(G) = ш1 and put E = G. Clearly, we 
can identify with the group of all left translations of E , which acts freely on E . 
Further, we can represent G in the form
G = U{G^ : % < ш1},
where the family {G^ : % < w1} satisfies the following three properties:
(1) for each % < ы1, we have card(G^) = w;
(2) for each % < w1, the set G ^ is a subgroup of the group G;
(3) for each % < ы1, the set U{G: £ < %} is a proper subset of G^.
Now, let us fix a point e e E and define
E ^ = G ^ (e) \ U{G c (e) : <<%}
for any ordinal % < Ш1. Then we obtain a partition {E^ : % <ш1} of E such that
card(E^) = ш 
(% < ш1).
We assert that the analog of Theorem 9.3 is not true for the above-mentioned partition. 
In other words, we claim that there exists a probability diffuse G-invariant measure 
p' on E such that, for an arbitrary subfamily {E^ : % e H} of {E^ : % < ш1}, at 
least one selector of {E^ : % e H} turns out to be p'-measurable.
Indeed, let p be a probability diffuse measure defined on the ^-algebra of subsets 
ofE generated by the family of all countable subsets ofE, and let be some selector 
of {E^ : % < ш1}. Denote by J the G-invariant <r-ideal of subsets of E generated by 
the one-element family {Z}. It is easy to check that, for any set X e J, we have the 
equality p,(X) = 0, where p, stands, as usual, for the inner measure associated with 
. Starting with this property ofJ and using Marczewski’s method (see [164, 165]), 
we can extend the measure p to a measure p' such that:
(a) dom(p') coincides with the <r-algebra of subsets of E generated by dom(p) U J; 
(b) p'(X) = 0 for all sets X e J (in particular, p'(Z) = 0);
(c) p ' is a G-invariant measure.
It is clear now that, for any subset H of ы1, there exists a p'-measurable selector of 
the family {E^ : % e H}.
Remark 9.5 A similar argument shows us that if H is an uncountable normal sub­
group ofa group G and g/h is a partition ofG into H-orbits, then for every selector 
Z of g/h there exists a measure satisfying the following conditions:

128
9 Measurability Properties of H-Selectors and Partial H-Selectors
(1) 
is a complete probability diffuse -invariant measure defined on some 
G-invariant <r-algebra of subsets of E;
(2) 
belongs to dom() and () = 0.
In particular, we immediately obtain from (2) that each subfamily of G/ admits a 
selector belonging to dom() .
The next result is an easy consequence of Theorem 9.3.
Theorem 9.6 Let the assumptions of Theorem 9.3 be satisfied and let, in addition, a 
countable subgroup H of G be such that card(H(x)) > 2 for each point x e E.
Then there exists an -selector nonmeasurable with respect to .
Proof It immediately follows from Theorem 9.3 that there exists a partial H-selector 
nonmeasurable with respect to . Evidently, we can find two H-selectors 1 and 
2 in E which both extend and satisfy the equality
Z = Zi О Z2.
Now, since the set is -nonmeasurable, at least one of the sets 1 and 2 must be 
-nonmeasurable.
Thus, we see that there exists a -nonmeasurable H-selector in E , and the proof 
is complete. 
□
Remark 9.7 In fact, the preceding argument yields that, for a measure defined 
on some ^-algebra of subsets of an infinite set E, the following two assertions are 
equivalent:
(a) there exists a subset of E nonmeasurable with respect to ;
(b) if {Ei : i e I} is a partition of E such that 2 < card(Ef) < ы for all i e I, then 
there exists a selector of {E,- : i e I} nonmeasurable with respect to p.
Remark 9.8 Let E be a set and let G be an uncountable group of transformations 
of E, acting almost freely on E with respect to a given nonzero ^-finite G-invariant 
measure on E . It has been proved that there always exists a countable subgroup H 
of G such that all H-selectors are nonmeasurable with respect to every G-invariant 
measure on E extending (see [159, 160]). In other words, the group H may be 
treated as a certain analog, for G and , of the additive group (Q, +) in the classical 
Vitali construction for (R, +) and 1. In connection with this result, we note that the 
method of [159] and [160] is essentially based on the assumption of G-invariance of 
an original measure p and, therefore, it does not work for nonzero ^-finite G-quasi- 
invariant measures. So, the following problem naturally arises:
Let E be a set and let G be an uncountable group of transformations ofE, acting 
almost freely on E with respect to a nonzero a -finite G-quasi-invariant measure p 
on E. Does there exist a countable subgroup H of G such that all H -selectors are 
nonmeasurable with respect to every G -quasi-invariant measure on E extending p?
This question still remains open.

9 Measurability Properties of H-Selectors and Partial H-Selectors
129
Remark 9.9 Let (, +) be an uncountable commutative group equipped with a 
nonzero <r-finite G-quasi-invariant measure p. It was shown in [91] that there always 
exists a -nonmeasurable subgroup of. Starting with this result, itis not difficult to 
prove that if is an arbitrary countable subgroup of G, then there exists a family of 
-orbits whose union is a p-nonmeasurable subgroup of G . Note that the analogous 
assertion is not true, in general, for uncountable noncommutative groups (see [91]).
Remark 9.10 Let (, G) be again a space equipped with a transformation group. It 
is easy to see that the results presented above can be formulated and proved in a more 
general form, namely, in terms of a pair (S, J ) for which the following properties 
hold:
(1) S is a G-invariant ^-algebra of subsets of E;
(2) J is a G-invariant <r-ideal of subsets of E;
(3) J is contained in S;
(4) (S, J) satisfies the countable chain condition, i.e., any disjoint subfamily of 
S \ J is at most countable.
In particular, we have the respective analogs of Theorems 9.2, 9.3, and 9.6 in terms 
of the Baire property.
Now, we wish to consider more concrete types of selectors and partial selectors 
which are naturally motivated by certain topics of real analysis and Lebesgue measure 
theory. In this context, we recall once more that in classical point set theory special 
types of subsets of the real line R play a prominent role. Among them the best known 
are Vitali sets, Bernstein sets, Hamel bases, Luzin sets, Sierpinski sets, universal 
measure zero sets, strong measure zero sets, etc. Extensive information about these 
sets, their structural properties, and their applications in real analysis, measure theory 
and general topology is presented in many monographs, surveys and textbooks (see, 
e.g., [29, 68, 99, 111, 126, 129, 136]).
Below, we will be dealing with some properties of those Vitali sets in R which are, 
at the same time, Bernstein subsets of R. More precisely, we will study a question 
posed by Lazou (in MathOverflow) in connection with Vitali-Bernstein selectors 
and partial Vitali-Bernstein selectors.
Recall that a set X c R is a Bernstein subset of R if, for every nonempty perfect 
set P c R, the relations
X n P + to, 
(R \ X) n P + 0
hold true.
The existence of a Bernstein set in R was first proved by Bernstein in [9], who 
at the time was studying some deep problems concerning trigonometric series. His 
construction of such a set was heavily based on an uncountable form of the Axiom 
of Choice and on the method of transfinite recursion.
Example 9.11 As was shown in [91], there exists a subset X of R which is simulta­
neously a Vitali set and a Bernstein set. Let us specify some details of the transfinite 
construction of such an X. Briefly, the construction is carried out as follows.

130
9 Measurability Properties of H-Selectors and Partial H-Selectors
Let c denote the cardinality of the continuum and let a be the least ordinal 
number such that card(a) = c. Consider the family {Pg : % < a} consisting of all 
nonempty perfect subsets of R. By using the method of transfinite recursion, define 
an a-sequence {у g : % < a} of points of R. For this purpose, suppose that, for an 
ordinal % < a, the partial family {у: £ < %} has already been defined. Since the 
inequalities
card(u{y+ Q : £ < %}) < card(%) • ы < c
hold, we have
P ^ \ (u{ у c + Q : £<%}) + V.
So we may pick a point
У£ e P€ \ (u{у( + Q : < < %}).
Proceeding in this manner, the desired a-sequence {у ^ : % < a} of points in R will 
be completely determined. It directly follows from the above construction that the 
set
Y = {у£ : % < a}
is a partial selector of the quotient set R/Q and meets every nonempty perfect 
subset of R. We may extend this Y to a selector X of R/Q (in general, there are many 
possibilities for such an extension). Taking an arbitrary nonzero number q e Q, we 
see that
X n(X + q) = V
and X + q also meets every nonempty perfect subset of R. This readily implies that 
the Q-selector X is simultaneously a Vitali set and a Bernstein set.
As has already been indicated, Lazou raised a question about the descriptive 
structure of the difference set X \ Y .In particular, he asked whether it is possible to 
have the equality A(X \ Y) = 0. One may also ask about the topological properties 
of the set X \ Y. For instance, the similar question arises whether X \ Y can be of 
first Baire category.
In what follows, we give answers to these questions and obtain some related 
results.
The main trick here is to use Hamel bases. As has been underlined earlier, the 
existence of a Hamel basis implies the existence of a Lebesgue nonmeasurable subset 
of R. However, a Hamel basis itself can possess rather nice descriptive properties. 
For instance, it was demonstrated by Sierpinski [153] that there exist Hamel bases of 
R which are of Lebesgue measure zero and of first Baire category (in this connection, 
see also Exercise 9.6). At the same time, there exist Hamel bases of R that are bad 
from the standpoint of Lebesgue measure and Baire category.
We need the following lemma.

9 Measurability Properties of H-Selectors and Partial H-Selectors
131
Lemma 9.12 There exists a Hamel basis of R such that:
(1) 1 € H;
(2) is a Bernstein set (consequently, is nonmeasurable in the Lebesgue sense 
and does not possess the Baire property).
We omit the proof of this lemma here (see Exercise 9.7 for more details). The 
argument is very similar to Bernstein’s classical construction (cf. [9, 99, 111, 136]).
Now, fix H as in Lemma 9.12 and consider the real line R as the direct sum
R = Q + V 
(Q П V = {0}),
where V denotes the linear hull (over Q) of the set H \ {1}. Clearly, V may be treated 
as a very special case of a Vitali set, because
card((x + Q) П V) = 1
for each point x e R. Moreover, for every v € V, we have
(v + Q) П V = {v}.
Since H is a Bernstein set in R, we easily infer that H \ {1} is a Bernstein set, too. 
Consequently, V is a Bernstein set and a Vitali set simultaneously. In particular, for 
any nonempty perfect subset P of R, we get the equality
card(P П V) = c.
For our further considerations, we need the next lemma.
Lemma 9.13 Let be a set in R intersecting every nonempty perfect subset of R 
and let be a subset of .
Then there exists a set Z' c Z such that card(Z') = card(Z) and В \ Z' also 
intersects every nonempty perfect subset of R.
Proof First of all, observe that if P is any nonempty perfect set in R, then 
card(P П B) = c. This fact immediately implies that if card(Z) < c, then we 
may put Z' = Z because В \ Z' has common points with every nonempty perfect set 
in R.
Suppose now that card( Z) = c. Let a denote the least ordinal number of cardinality 
c and let {Pg : % < a} be an enumeration of all nonempty perfect subsets of R. We 
define by transfinite recursion two injective disjoint a-sequences
{z^ : % <a} c B, {z^ : % <a} c Z
of points in R. Assume that, for an ordinal % < a, the partial %-sequences
{z c : {<%} c B, {z: ^<%} c Z
have already been defined. Since card(Pg П B) = c, we can choose a point 

132
9 Measurability Properties of H-Selectors and Partial H-Selectors
z ^ e (P g n B) \ ({Z£ : {<£} и {z'£ : < < £}).
Further, since card(Z) = c, we can choose a point
z'^ e Z \({z c : < < £ } u {z^ : {<£}).
Proceeding in this manner, we finally come to the desired two a-sequences 
{z^ : £ < a} and {z^ : £ < a} of points in R. It directly follows from the 
described construction that these а-sequences are injective and disjoint. We now put
Z’ = {z^ : £ < a}
and observe that
card(Z') = c, 
{z^ : £ < a} c B \ Z'.
The above construction of the а-sequence {z^ : £ < a} yields that the set 
{z^ : £< a} meets every nonempty perfect subset of R. Therefore, the set B \ Z’ 
possesses the same property.
Lemma 9.13 has thus been proved. 
□
Let V be as before (i.e., V = linQ(H \ {1})) and let C denote the Cantor set in 
[0,1]. As is commonly known, A(C) = 0 and C is nowhere dense in R. At the same 
time, the set
Z = C n V
is of cardinality continuum. Putting B = V, we may apply Lemma 9.13 to B and Z. 
Let Z’ c Z be as in Lemma 9.13. Obviously, A(Z') = 0 and Z’ is nowhere dense in 
R.
We may express the set B \ Z’ in the form of an injective а-sequence of points, 
i.e.,
B \ Z' = {tv : ^ < a}.
Now, let us return to the transfinite construction of a partial selector Y of R/Q, which 
was described in Example 9.11. We repeat the same construction modifying it in the 
following manner. Again, {Pg : £ < a} stands for the family of all nonempty perfect 
subsets of R. Suppose that £ < a and the partial £-sequence {у: £ < £} of points 
of R has already been defined so that
{у c : <<£ }c B \ Z'.
Consider the set Pg. Since the relations
card(P^ n (B \ Z')) = c,
(u{ у c + Q : <<£ })n B = {у c : <<£}
hold, we may put у ^ = tv, where ^ is the least ordinal number for which
t „ e (P ^ n( B \ Z')) \ {у c : ^ <£}.

9 Measurability Properties of H-Selectors and Partial H-Selectors 
133
Proceeding in this manner, we will get the partial selector {у g : % < a} of R/Q.
The following lemma is crucial for our further considerations.
Lemma 9.14 The equality {у^ : % < a} = В \ Z' holds.
Proof Take any tл, where q < a. It suffices to demonstrate that tл coincides with 
some у^, where % is an ordinal number strictly less than a. Suppose otherwise, 
i.e., for each % < a, the element tл differs from у^. Observe that there exists a set 
S c [0, a [ such that
card(S) = c, 
(V% e S)(t^ e p^).
From this we obtain that if % e S, then у^ is chosen so that у ^ = t, where £ < q. 
But all points у ^ (% e S) differ from one another and
card({у^ : % < S}) = c.
At the same time, we obviously have the inequalities
card({t: £ < q}) < card(q) < c,
whence a contradiction follows.
This contradiction finishes the proof. 
□
Lemmas 9.12, 9.13, and 9.14 enable us to formulate the following theorem.
Theorem 9.15 The difference Z' between the Vitali-Bernstein set V and V \ Z' is of 
Lebesgue measure zero and nowhere dense in R.
Taking the empty set 0 instead of C, we see that an analogous argument yields 
the next theorem.
Theorem 9.16 The choice of points у g (% < a) can be modified so that the partial 
selector Y = {у ^ : % < a} is equal to the Vitali-Bernstein selector V.
Example 9.17 The transfinite construction of partial Vitali selectors admits many 
essentially different variations and the obtained partial selectors can possess diverse 
descriptive properties. For instance, it is not difficult to give a construction of Y and 
X such that the following two properties are satisfied:
(a) 
X is simultaneously a Vitali set and a Bernstein set;
(b) the partial selector Y c X is a Bernstein set and the difference X \Y is a Bernstein 
set, too.
For more details, see Exercise 9.8.
Remark 9.18 As demonstrated above, there exists a subset ofR which is at the same 
time a Vitali set and a Bernstein set. Also, there exists a subset of R which is a 
Bernstein set and a Hamel basis (see, e.g., Lemma 9.12). On the other hand, it is 

134
9 Measurability Properties of H-Selectors and Partial H-Selectors
not hard to verify that no Vitali set can coincide with a Hamel basis of R. In this 
connection, let us point out that any Hamel basis of R is an R-absolutely negligible 
set in R (for the definition and properties of absolutely negligible sets, see [90] or 
[91]). Since there are countably many translates of a Vitali set which form a covering 
of R, it immediately follows that no Vitali set can be R-negligible in R, so no Vitali 
set can be a Hamel basis.
Remark 9.19 We have already mentioned several times that Luzin sets and Sier- 
pinski sets play an important role in various topics of real analysis, measure theory, 
and general topology (see, e.g., [99,111,126,129,136]). Observe that if X c R is a 
Luzin set (respectively, a Sierpinski set), then X cannot be a Vitali set or a Bernstein 
set. On the other hand, the following two assertions hold:
(a) under the Continuum Hypothesis, there exists a subset of R which is simultane­
ously a Luzin set and a Hamel basis;
(b) under the Continuum Hypothesis, there exists a subset of R which is simultane­
ously a Sierpinski set and a Hamel basis.
The proof of (a) and (b) can be carried out by using an argument similar to that of 
Sierpinski (cf. Exercises 9.11 and 9.12). Assuming Martin’s Axiom (MA) instead 
of the Continuum Hypothesis (CH), the direct analogs of (a) and (b) are also true in 
terms of generalized Luzin sets and generalized Sierpinski sets (see again Exercises 
9.11 and 9.12).

* Show that there exists a set X c R such that:
(a) 
X is of first category;
(b) 
X is of Lebesgue measure zero;
(c) 
X + X = {x + x' : x e X, x' e X} = R.
Starting with this X and applying the Kuratowski-Zorn lemma, deduce that there 
exists a Hamel basis Ho in R which is a subset of X.
Finally, conclude that 0 is of first category and of Lebesgue measure zero.
9.7 
* Prove that there exists a Hamel basis H of R satisfying the following two 
conditions:
(a) 
1 e H;
(b) 
H n P + 0 for each nonempty perfect subset P of R.
For this purpose, denote by a the least ordinal number with card(a) = c, and let 
{Pg : 0 < £ < a} be the family of all nonempty perfect subsets of R. Construct, by 
using the method of transfinite recursion, an a-sequence {h g : £< a} of rationally 
independent real numbers such that
ho = 1, h^ e Pg 
(0 < ^ < a).
Then expand {h ^ : £< a} to some Hamel basis H of R and verify that this H is 
necessarily a Bernstein subset of R.
Conclude that there are Hamel bases in R which simultaneously are Bernstein 
subsets of R.
9.8 
* By using the method of transfinite recursion, give a construction of two sets X 
and satisfying these three properties:
(a) 
X is simultaneously a Vitali set and a Bernstein set;
(b) 
Y is a partial Vitali selector, Y c X and Y is a Bernstein set;
(c) 
X \ Y is a Bernstein set.
For this purpose, slightly modify the argument presented in Example 9.11.
9.9 Verify that any Hamel basis in R is an R-absolutely negligible subset of R.
Infer from this fact that there exists no subset of R which is simultaneously a 
Hamel basis and Vitali set.
Remark 9.20 A number of facts and statements about properties of absolutely neg­
ligible sets may be found in [82, 90, 91].
9.10 Show that:
(a) no Luzin set can be a Vitali set or a Bernstein set;
(b) no Sierpinski set can be a Vitali set or a Bernstein set.
Formulate and prove the corresponding analogs of (a) and (b) for generalized Luzin 
sets and for generalized Sierpinski sets.

* Assuming the Continuum Hypothesis, prove that there exists a subset of R 
which is simultaneously a Luzin set and a Hamel basis.
Analogously, assuming Martin’s Axiom, prove that there exists a subset of R 
which is simultaneously a generalized Luzin set and a Hamel basis.
For this purpose, take into account the fact that, under CH (respectively, under 
MA), there exist two Luzin sets L1 and L2 (respectively, two generalized Luzin sets 
L1 and L'2) such that the real line R admits a representation in the form
R = L1 + L2 = {x + у : x e L1, у e L2}
(respectively, in the form R = L1 + L'2). More detailed information on such repre­
sentations of R can be found in Exercise 4.8).
9.12 
* Assuming the Continuum Hypothesis, prove that there exists a subset of R 
which is simultaneously a Sierpinski set and a Hamel basis.
Analogously, assuming Martin’s Axiom, prove that there exists a subset of R 
which is simultaneously a generalized Sierpinski set and a Hamel basis.
For this purpose, take into account the fact that, under CH (respectively, un­
der MA), there exist two Sierpinski sets 51 and S2 (respectively, two generalized 
Sierpinski sets S'1 and S’2) such that the real line R admits a representation in the 
form
R = 5i + 52 = {x + у : x e Si, у e S2}
(respectively, in the form R = 51 + 52). Such representations of R can be obtained 
by using a method similar to the method described in Exercise 4.8.
9.13 Work in ZF set theory and show that the existence of a Hamel basis of R implies 
the existence of a Vitali set in R which simultaneously is a vector space over Q.
9.14 Verify that the following two assertions are equivalent:
(a) the cardinal c is not measurable in the Ulam sense;
(b) for every nonzero ^-finite diffuse measure p on R, there exists a Vitali set in R 
nonmeasurable with respect to .
9.15 
* Prove that there exists a partition {X,- : i e I} of R such that:
(a) 
(yi e I)(2 < card(X,-) < щ);
(b) any selector of {X,- : i e I} is a Bernstein subset of R.
For this purpose, take a set I with card(I) = c and consider the family {Р,- : i e I} 
of all nonempty perfect subsets of R. Check that there is a disjoint family of sets 
{Y,- : i e I} such that
Yi c Pi, 2 < card(Y,-) < ш
for each index i e I. Using the family {Y, : i e I}, produce the required partition 
{Xi : i e I}.

9.16 Verify that the following two assertions are equivalent:
(a) the cardinal c is not measurable in the Ulam sense;
(b) for every nonzero ^-finite diffuse measure p on R, there exists a Bernstein set in 
R nonmeasurable with respect to .
For this purpose, keep in mind Exercise 9.15.
9.17 
* Let n be a nonzero natural number and let {V,- : 1 < i < n} be a family of
Vitali subsets of R. Also, let p be a Q-invariant measure on R extending 2.
Prove that:
(a) the set u{Vf : 1 < i < n} is not p-measurable;
(b) the same set does not have the Baire property.
For this purpose, use the existence of an appropriate universal Q-invariant finitely 
additive measure on R.
9.18 Give an example of a set X c R satisfying the following conditions:
(a) the intersection of X with any member of R/Q is finite;
(b) there exists a Q-invariant finitely additive measure v on R extending A and such 
that v (R \ X) = 0.
9.19 Let X be a linearly independent (over Q) subset of R.
Prove that there are two Hamel bases 1 and 2 of R such that
Н1 П H2 = X.
Deduce from this fact that, under CH, for any nonzero ^-finite diffuse measure p on 
R, there exists a Hamel basis of R nonmeasurable with respect to p.
9.20 Assuming that the negation of the Continuum Hypothesis holds true, show that 
there exists a measure v on R satisfying the following conditions:
(a) 
v is nonzero, ^-finite, diffuse, and translation invariant;
(b) the domain of v contains all Hamel bases of R.
For this purpose, use Marczewski’s method of extending invariant measures.
9.21 
* Under CH, prove that there exists a countable family {Н,- : i e I} of Hamel 
bases of R such that U{H : i e I} = R \ {0}.
For this purpose, it suffices to show that, under CH, there exists a family 
{Xn : n < ш} of linearly independent (over Q) sets in R such that
U{Xn : n < ш} = R \ {0}.
Let {e g : ^<w1} be some Hamel basis of R. Every nonzero x e R admits a unique 
representation in the form
x = qi e й + q2e ^2 + • • • + qm e ^m, 

138
9 Measurability Properties of H-Selectors and Partial H-Selectors
where m is a nonzero natural number, ^1, q2,..., qm are nonzero rational numbers 
and £1 < £2 < • • • < £m < ш1. Define m(x) = m and £(x) = £m.
Further, for every ordinal number £ < w1, put
Zg = {x e R \ {0} : £(x) = £}
and verify that card(Z^) < w. So, Z^ admits a representation in the form of an 
injective at most countable family of points
Zk = {%0,^, %1,£, ■ ■ ■ , -G,k, ■ ■ ■}■
Finally, for each n < w, define Xn = [xn,k : £ < ы1} and show that:
(a) all Xn (n < ш) are linearly independent over Q;
(b) 
R \ {0} = U{Xn : n < w}.
Remark 9.21 Actually, the same argument shows that if E is a vector space over Q 
and card(E) = w1, then the set E \ {0} is representable as the union of countably 
many bases of E .
9.22 
* Prove that if an uncountable set E is such that
[E]2 = U{Gk : к<ш},
where no set Gk contains nontrivial cycles, then card(E) = ш1.
Argue step by step as follows. Without loss of generality, assume that E is 
represented in the form of an injective family:
E = {ea : a < в},
where в denotes some uncountable ordinal. Also, assume that the family 
{Gk : к < to} is disjoint and all Gk are nonempty. For each к < ш, let {Gk>!- : i e Ik} 
be a partition of G k into its connected components, and let {e k,i : i e Ik } beaselector 
of {Gk,i : i e Ik}.
For a two-element set {ea, e$} e Gk>!-, say that this set is of type (0,1) if
a < fi, ea = ek,i,
and say that this set is of type (0,2) if
a<fi, e $ = e k,i ■
For a natural number m, suppose that the elements of Gk>!- of types (n, 1) and 
(n, 2) are defined for all natural numbers n <m, and introduce the elements of Gk>!- 
of types (m, 1) and (m, 2) in a similar manner as described below.
An edge {ea, e$} e Gk>!- not belonging to the types (n, 1) or (n, 2), where n < m, 
is of type (m, 1) if a < fi and ea is one of the end-points of some edge of type 
(m - 1,1) or of type (m - 1,2).

9 Measurability Properties of H-Selectors and Partial H-Selectors
139
An edge {ea, ep} e Gk,i not belonging to the types (n, 1) or (n, 2), where n < m, 
is of type (m, 2) if a < ft and ep is one of the end-points of some edge of type 
(m - 1,1) or of type (m - 1,2).
Since Gk,i is connected, any edge {ea, ep} e Gk,t belongs to a certain (uniquely 
determined) type (m, 1) or (m, 2), where m < w.
Further, denote by Gk f m the set of all those edges of Gk>!- which belong to the 
type (m, 1), and denote by G£ f m the set of all those edges of Gk,i which belong to 
the type (m, 2). Then introduce the notation
Hk,1 = U( U Gl,t,2m),
Hk,3 = U ( U G2£,t,2m),
H' = U (H£,1 U H£,2), 
k<cu
Hk,2 = U( U Gk,t,2m+1),
Hk,4 = U ( U Glp^+1),
H" = U (Hk,3 U Hk,4). 
k<w
Verify that:
(a) for each a < в and for each j e {1,2}, there is at most one ft < a such that 
{ea, ep} e Hk,j;
(b) for each a < в and for each j e {3,4}, there is at most one ft > a such that 
{ea,€p } e Hk,j ;
(c) H' U H" = [E]2 and H' П H" = 0;
(d) for any a < в, one has card({ft < a : {ea, ep} e H'}) < ы;
(e) for any a < в, one has card({ft > a : {ea, ep} e H"}) < ы.
Taking % < w1, define
X p = {e c : ^>% & {e p ,e c }e H"},
and infer from (e) that card(Xp) < w.
Show that E c (U{Xp : % < w1}) U {ep : % < w1}.
For this purpose, take arbitrarily e a e E .If a < w1, then everything is clear. So 
suppose that a > w1. According to (a), there exists a ^ < w1 such that {e ,e a} ^ H'. 
Consequently, in view of (c), {e, ea} e H". So ea e X^ by definition of the set 
.
Since all sets Xp (^ < u1) are at most countable, the inclusion
E c (U{x% : % < ^1}) U {«^ : % < ^1}
immediately implies the required equality card(E) = w1.

9.23 
* Assuming that the set R \ {0} is representable as the union of countably many 
Hamel bases of R, prove that
[R]2 = U{G* : п<ш},
where no set G*n (п < ш) contains nontrivial cycles (consequently, in view of 
Exercise 9.22, CH holds true).
Argue as follows. Let R \ {0} = U{Xn : п < ш}, where all Xn are linearly 
independent over Q. Without loss of generality, one may assume that
card( X0) = card (R) = c.
For any two numbers и and v from X0, where и < v, put {u, v} e Gn if and only if 
v - u e Xn. It is clear that
[Xo]2 = U{Gn : п < ш}.
It remains to check that no set Gn contains nontrivial cycles. Suppose otherwise, 
i.e., some Gn contains a nontrivial cycle
{{U1, U2}, {U2, из},..., {um-i, um}, {um, ui}},
where {u1, u2,..., um-1, um} c Xo, all uk (1 < к < m) are pairwise different, and
{|ui — U21, |U2 — U3 |, . . ., |um-1 — Um |, |um - Ui |} C Xn.
This implies that
0 = £1 |u1 — u2 | + £2 |u2 — u3 | + • • • + £m-i |um-i — um | + £m |um — U1 |,
where
{£1, £2, . . . , £m—i, £m} C { — 1, 1}.
Keeping in mind the fact that X0 is linearly independent over Q, infer that all numbers
|U1 — U2 |, |U2 — U3 | ,..., |um—i — Um |, \um — Ui |
are pairwise different and conclude that the last equality contradicts the linear inde­
pendence (over Q) of the set Xn.
The obtained contradiction yields the required result.
9.24 Prove that if a ground set E is of cardinality w1, then
[ E ]2 = G1 U G 2 U • • • U G n U • • • ,
where none of the graphs G1, G2, ... , Gn, ... contains nontrivial cycles.
For this purpose, consider E as a vector subspace (over Q) of R and take into 
account the preceding exercises.

Remark 9.22 The results presented in Exercises 9.21-9.24 are all due to Erdos 
and Kakutani (see their joint paper [39]). Note also that, assuming CH, the result 
of Exercise 9.22 can easily be deduced from a special version of the Erdos-Rado 
combinatorial theorem [42], which was proved by Kurepa [114] much earlier than 
the Erdos-Rado theorem. Indeed, if card() > c and one has a representation
[E]2 = U{Gn : n<u},
then there exist an index к < ы and an uncountable set X c E such that [X]2 c Gk. 
So necessarily contains cycles of arbitrarily long finite lengths.
9.25 Show that CH is equivalent to the following statement: for every nonzero a- 
finite diffuse measure on R2 , either there exists a -nonmeasurable subset of R2 
uniform in direction R x {0} or there exists a p-nonmeasurable subset of R2 uniform 
in direction {0} x R.
9.26 * Assuming MA, prove that:
(a) there exists a countable family {V,- : i e I} of Vitali sets in R such that, for any 
nonzero ^-finite diffuse measure p on R, at least one set V,- is nonmeasurable 
with respect to ;
(b) there exists a countable family {В,- : i e I} of Bernstein sets in R such that, for 
any nonzero ^-finite diffuse measure p on R, at least one set В,- is nonmeasurable 
with respect to p.
For this purpose, use some generalized Luzin subset of R.

A Decomposition of an Uncountable Solvable 
Group into Three Negligible Sets
It is well known that if a group (G, •) has a complicated algebraic structure, then G 
admits various kinds of paradoxical finite decompositions. For instance, if contains 
a subgroup isomorphic to 2 (= the group generated by two independent generators), 
then paradoxical finite decompositions are realizable for G . Actually, this old result 
goes back to von Neumann (in this connection, see e.g. [167]). On the other hand, it 
is also widely known that any solvable (and, in particular, any commutative) group 
(G, •) does not admit such decompositions, because it is amenable, i.e., there exists 
a normalized finitely additive left (right) invariant measure whose domain coincides 
with the family P(G) of all subsets of G (see again [167]).
The present chapter is devoted to a finite decomposition (partition) ofan uncount­
able solvable group (G, •), which is of interest in the context of nonzero ^-finite 
countably additive invariant (quasi-invariant) measures on G. In some sense, the 
decomposition constructed below may also be regarded as paradoxical for G .
So, we will be dealing with those nonzero ^-finite measures on an uncountable 
solvable group (G, •) which are invariant (or, more generally, quasi-invariant) under 
the group of all left translations ofG. For the class of such measures, certain “small” 
subsets of G will be specified and it will be demonstrated that G can be partitioned 
into three “small” subsets.
Let E be a base (ground) set and let Г be some group of transformations of E. 
In this case, the pair (E, Г) is usually called a space equipped with a transformation 
group.
We shall say that a set X с E is Г-negligible (in E) if the following two conditions 
are fulfilled for :
(a) there exists a nonzero <r-finite Г-invariant (Г-quasi-invariant) measure p on E 
such that X e dom(p);
(b) for every ^-finite Г-quasi-invariant measure v on E such that X belongs to 
dom(), the equality (X) = 0 holds true.
If (G, •) is a group, then we may consider G as a ground set E and we also may take 
the group of all left translations of G as a group of transformations of E. Obviously, 
identifying (G, •) with the group of all left translations of G, we can speak of left

10 A Decomposition of an Uncountable Solvable Group into Three Negligible Sets
G-invariant (left G-quasi-invariant) measures on E (= G) and, respectively, we may 
consider -negligible subsets of .
For our further purposes, we need several lemmas.
Lemma 10.1 Let (G, +) be a commutative group satisfying the following condition:
There are three subgroups G1, G2, G3 of G such that
card(G 1) = card(G 2) = card(G 3) = w1
and G is a direct sum of G1, G2, G3, which means that
G=G1+G2+G3
and the equalities
G 1 n(G 2 + G 3) = {0},
G2 n(G 1 + G3) = {0}, 
G3 n(G 1 + G2) = {0}
hold true.
Then there exist three pairwise disjoint subsets , and of G such that 
G = X U Y U Z and
(a) for each g e G, the set X n (G 1 + g) is finite;
(b) for each g e G, the set Y n (G2 + g) is finite;
(c) for each g e G, the set Z n (G3 + g) is finite.
In fact, Lemma 10.1 is due to Sierpinski (see, for instance, his classical monograph 
[155]). Note that in this monograph Sierpinski formulates a certain analog of Lemma 
10.1 in terms of a logical equivalent of the Continuum Hypothesis (CH). However, 
in the sequel we will apply Sierpinski’s result in the form given above. For more 
details about Lemma 10.1, see Exercise 10.3.
Lemma 10.2 Let (G, +) be a commutative group and let be an uncountable 
subgroup of G. Suppose also that a set X c G satisfies
(Vg e G)(card(X n (g + H)) < щ).
Then X is a G -negligible subset ofG.
Proof It is not difficult to check that, for an arbitrary countable family {g,- : i e I} 
of elements of G, the inequality
card(G \ U{g,- + X : i e I}) > ы1
holds true. This implies that {X} generates the G-invariant <r-ideal I(X) in the 
power set P(G) of G. Denote by S(X) the ^-algebra of subsets of G, generated by 

Ц (Z) =
10 A Decomposition of an Uncountable Solvable Group into Three Negligible Sets 
145
I(X). Obviously, S(X) is G-invariant, too. Let us define a functional ц on S(X) by 
putting:
0 if Z eI(X);
1 if Z eS(X)\I(X).
A direct verification shows that ц is a probability G -invariant measure on G, for 
which X e dom(ц) and ц (X) = 0 hold.
Let now v be an arbitrary ^-finite G-quasi-invariant measure on G such that 
X e dom(v). We have to demonstrate that v(X) = 0. Suppose otherwise, i.e., 
v(X) > 0. By virtue of the ^-finiteness and H-quasi-invariance of v, there exists a 
countable subgroup H0 of H such that
(Vh e H)(v((h + Hq + X)a(Hq + X)) = 0).
In this connection, see Exercise 10.5, where a more general result is formulated. It 
follows from the above that
v(n{hj + H0 + X : j e J}) > 0
for every countable family {h j : j e J} of elements of H. On the other hand, keeping 
in mind the inequality
card(H/H0) > w,
let us take any partial countably infinite selector {hj : j e J} of H/H0 and let us 
check that
n{hj + Hq + X : j e J} = 0.
Indeed, assuming for a moment that
z e Ci{hj + Hq + X : j e J},
we infer that there are two countable families
{hQ : j e J} c Hq, 
{xj : j e J} с X
such that
z - hi = h] + xJ 
(J e J).
Since there are only finitely many elements of X in the orbit H + z, there exist two 
distinct indices j e J and к e J for which we have xj = xk and, consequently,
z - hj - hQ = z - hk - hk, 
hk - hj = hQ - hk e H0,
contradicting the choice of {h, : j e J}.
The obtained contradiction finishes the proof.

10 A Decomposition of an Uncountable Solvable Group into Three Negligible Sets
Remark 10.3 Let (, +) be a commutative group and let be an uncountable 
subgroup of G. Suppose also that a set X c G satisfies
(Vg e G)(card(X n (g + H)) < ы).
Then, in general, we cannot assert that X is a G-negligible subset of G . The corre­
sponding examples may be found in [78] (see also Exercise 10.6).
Lemma 10.4 Let (G, •) and (H, •) be two groups and let ф be a surjective homo­
morphism of (G, •) onto (H, •). Suppose also that X is an H-negligible subset of 
H.
Then ф— (X) is a G-negligible subset of G.
Proof Since X is H-negligible in H, there exists a nonzero ^-finite left H-invariant 
(H-quasi-invariant) measure on H such that X e dom() and (X) = 0. For the 
group (G, •) , consider the family of its subsets
Si = {ф-(Z) : Z e dom(д)}.
Clearly, S1 is a left G-invariant <r-algebra in G and ф~1 (X) e S1. We put
V1(Ф-1 (Z)) = д(Z) 
(Z e dom(д)).
A straightforward verification shows that:
(a) 
л1 is well-defined;
(b) p1 is a nonzero ^-finite left G-invariant (G-quasi-invariant) measure on the 
^-algebra S1;
(c) vi (^-1 (X)) = 0.
Let now v be an arbitrary ^-finite left G-quasi-invariant measure on G such that 
ф-1 (X) e dom(v). Without loss of generality, we may assume that v is a probability 
measure. For this v , we must prove that
v (^-1 (X)) = 0.
Suppose otherwise, i.e., v(ф-1 (X)) > 0.
For the group (H, •), consider the family of sets
S2 = {Y c H : <^-1 (Y) e dom(v)}.
Clearly, S2 is a left H-invariant ^-algebra of subsets of H and X e S2. We now put
№(Y) = v(^-1 (Y)) (Y eS2).
A straightforward verification shows that л2 is a probability left H-quasi-invariant 
measure on the <r-algebra S2 and
№(X) = v(ф-1 (X)) > 0,

which contradicts the fact that is an -negligible subset of .
The obtained contradiction completes the proof of Lemma 10.4. 
□
The next two auxiliary lemmas are purely algebraic and can be deduced from some 
well-known theorems of the general theory of commutative groups (cf. [48, 115]).
Lemma 10.5 If (, +) is an arbitrary uncountable commutative group, then there 
exist three subgroups 1, 2, 3 of such that
card(G 1) = card(G 2) = card(G 3) = ш1
and the equalities
G 1 П (G 2 + G 3) = {0},
G2 n(G 1 + G3) = {0},
G3 n(G 1 + G2) = {0}
hold true (in other words, G1 + G2 + G3 is a direct sum of the groups G1, G2, and 
G3).
For a proof of Lemma 10.5, see the hint in Exercise 10.7 (cf. also Remark 10.13 
after Exercise 10.7).
Lemma 10.6 If (G, +) is an uncountable commutative group, then there exist three 
pairwise disjoint subsets , , of G satisfying these two properties:
(1) 
G = X U Y U Z;
(2) all the sets , , and are G-negligible in G.
Proof By virtue of Lemma 10.5, the group (G, +) contains three subgroups G1, G2 
and G3 such that
card(G 1) = card(G 2) = card(G 3) = w1,
G 1 П (G2 + G3) = G2 П (G3 + G1) = G3 П (G 1 + G2) = {0}.
Let us introduce the notation
G0 = G1 + G2 + G3.
Obviously, card(Go) = w1 and Gо is a direct sum of the groups G 1, G2, G3. 
So Lemma 10.1 can be applied to G0. According to this lemma, there exist three 
pairwise disjoint subsets X0 , Y0, and Z0 of G0 such that
G0 = X0 U Y0 U Z0
and the following conditions are fulfilled:

148
10 A Decomposition of an Uncountable Solvable Group into Three Negligible Sets
(a) for each g e Go, the set Xo n (G1 + g) is finite;
(b) for each g e Go, the set Yo n (G2 + g) is finite;
(c) for each g e Go, the set Zo n (G3 + g) is finite.
Fix any selector {g,- : i e I} of the quotient set G/G0 and put
X = u{gf + Xo : i e I}, 
Y = u{g,- + Yo: i e I}, 
Z = u{gt + Zo : i e 1}.
Then, for X , Y and Z , one readily gets the relations
G = X U Y U Z,
X n Y = Y П Z = Z П X = 0.
Further, it follows from the conditions (a), (b), and (c) that:
(a') for each g e G, the set X n (G 1 + g) is finite;
(b') for each g e G, the set Y n (G2 + g) is finite;
(c') for each g e G, the set Z n (G3 + g) is finite.
Therefore, by virtue of Lemma 10.2, the sets X, Y and Z are G-negligible in the
group (G, +).
Lemma 10.6 has thus been proved.

Lemma 10.7 Let (G, •) be a group, H be a normal subgroup of G such that 
card(G/H) < ш, and let X bean H-negligible subset of H. Suppose that {g,- : i e I} 
is some selector of G/H.
Then the set X' defined by the formula X' = U{g,- • X : i e I} is a G-negligible 
subset of G.
Proof According to our assumption, X is H-negligible in H. Consequently, there 
exists a nonzero ^-finite left H-invariant (H-quasi-invariant) measure p on H such 
that X e dom(p) and p (X) = o.
In the group (G, •) consider the family of sets
S' = {u{g,- • Tt : i e I} : (Vi e I)(7- e dom(p))}.
It can readily be checked that S' is a left G-invariant ^-algebra of subsets of G. 
If T = u{gf • Tt : i e I}, where all Tt (i e I) belong to dom(p), then we put
p'(T) = £{p(Ti) : i e I}.
The functional p' defined in this manner turns out to be a nonzero ^-finite left 
G-invariant (G-quasi-invariant) measure on S'. It also follows from the definition 
of p' that X' e S' and p'(X') = o.

Let now v be any ^-finite left G-quasi-invariant measure on G such that X’ e 
dom(v). We must demonstrate that v(X') = 0. Suppose otherwise, i.e., v(X') > 0. 
Then, taking into account the equality
X’ = u{gf • X : i e I}
and the G-quasi-invariance of v, we get v*(X) > 0, where the symbol v* denotes, as 
usual, the outer measure associated with v. In view of the inclusion X с H, we also 
have v*(H) > 0. Let H* be a v-measurable hull of H. It can easily be shown that
v(X' П H*) > 0.
Since H is a group, the set H* is almost left H-invariant with respect to v, i.e.,
(Vh e H)(v(hH*AH*) = 0).
Further, in H consider the family of sets
S" = {H П U : U e dom(v) & U с H*}.
Obviously, S" is a left H-invariant ^-algebra of subsets of H. Moreover, putting
/'(H П U) = v(U) (U e dom(v), U с H*),
we are able to define a ^-finite left H-quasi-invariant measure p" on the <r-algebra 
S". Finally, take the index i0 e I such that g,-0 e H. Then we may write
gi0 • X = H П (X' П H*) e S",
Д"(gr-0 • X) > 0, /'(X) > 0,
which contradicts the assumption that X is H-negligible in H.
This ends the proof of Lemma 10.7. 
□
Theorem 10.8 If (G, •) is an uncountable solvable group, then G can be represented 
in the form G = X u Y u Z, where the sets X, Y, and Z are pairwise disjoint and 
G-negligible in G.
Proof Let e denote the neutral element of G. Since the group (G, •) is solvable, 
there exists a finite sequence
{e} = G0 с Gi с G2 с ••• с G„_i с Gn = G
of subgroups of G satisfying these two properties:
(i) for each natural index к e [1, n], the group Gk-1 is normal in the group Gk; 
(ii) for each natural index к e [1, n], the quotient group Gk/Gk-1 is commutative.
To demonstrate the validity of the assertion formulated in Theorem 10.8, we argue 
by induction on n.

150 
10 A Decomposition of an Uncountable Solvable Group into Three Negligible Sets
If n = 1, then the uncountable group G = Gn is commutative, and we may directly 
apply Lemma 10.6 to this G.
Suppose now that the assertion holds true for a natural number n - 1 > 1 and let 
us establish its validity for n.
For this purpose, consider the commutative quotient group
H = G n/G n-i,
where, as above, Gn = G. Here only two cases are possible.
(a) the group H = Gn/Gn-1 is uncountable.
In this case, we take the canonical surjective homomorphism
Ф : (Gn, •) ^ (H, +)•
By virtue of Lemma 10.6, there exist three pairwise disjoint H-negligible subsets 
Xo, Y0 and Zo of H such that
H = Xq U Yo U Zo .
We now put
X = Ф-1 ( Xo), Y = Ф-1 (Yo), Z = ф-1 ( Zq).
Then, keeping in mind Lemma 10.4, we see that the sets X, Y, and Z are pairwise 
disjoint, G-negligible in G, and
G = 0-1 (H) = 0-1 (xo u yo u zo) = x u y u z,
which yields the required result.
(b) the group H = G n/G n-1 is countable.
In this case, in view of the uncountability of Gn = G , the group Gn-1 is necessarily 
uncountable and we can apply the inductive assumption to this Gn-1. So, there exist 
three pairwise disjoint Gn-1-negligible subsets Xo, Yo, and Zo of Gn-1 such that
Gn-1 = Xq U Yq U Zq .
Let {gi : i e I} be any selector of Gn/Gn-1. We put
X = U{gf • Xq : i e I}, 
Y = U{gf • Yq : i e I}, 
Z = U{gf • Zo : i e I}.
In view of Lemma 10.7, the sets X, Y, and Z are G-negligible in G. It is also clear 
that
G = x u y u z,
x n Y = Y П Z = Z П X = 0.

10 A Decomposition of an Uncountable Solvable Group into Three Negligible Sets 
151
Theorem 10.8 has thus been proved. 
□
Remark 10.9 Let (G, •) be an arbitrary uncountable group. It can easily be shown 
that there exist no disjoint G-negligible sets X and Y in G such that G = X U Y.
Theorem 10.10 If (G, •) is an uncountable solvable group, then there are three 
pairwise disjoint G-negligible subsets X, Y, Z of G such that, for any nonzero a - 
finite left G-quasi-invariant measure on G, at least two of the sets X, Y, are 
nonmeasurable with respect to .
Theorem 10.10 is an immediate consequence of Theorem 10.8.
Remark 10.11 Analogs of Theorems 10.8 and 10.10 can be established for many 
other uncountable groups which are not assumed to be solvable. Nevertheless, the 
following problem remains open:
Let (G, •) be an arbitrary uncountable group. Does there exist a finite decompo­
sition of G into its G -negligible subsets?
Exercises
10.1 Let (G, +) be a commutative group and let G 1 and G2 be two subgroups of G 
such that G = G 1 + G2 and G1 О G2 = {0}, where 0 denotes the neutral element of 
G. Let Z be an arbitrary at most countable subset of G .
Show that there exists a representation of Z in the form
Z = Z1 U Z2, 
(Z1 О Z2 = 0),
where
(Vg e G)(card((Gi + g) О Z1)) < ы,
(Vg e G)(card((G2 + g) ° Z2)) < w.
For this purpose, consider the sets pr1(Z) and pr2 (Z) in G1 and in G2 respectively. 
Since Z is at most countable, one can write
pri (Z) = {go,gi,...gm,...},
pr2(Z) = {ho, hi,..., hn,...},
where m (respectively, n) ranges over a certain subset of ы and the families
{go,gi,...,gm,...} c G1, 
{ho,hi,...,hn,...} c G2
are injective. Then put
Zi = {gm + hn e Z : m < n},

152 
10 A Decomposition of an Uncountable Solvable Group into Three Negligible Sets
Z2 = {gm + hn e Z : m > n},
and check that Z1 and Z2 are as required.
10.2 
* Let (G, +) be a commutative group and let Gi and G2 be two subgroups of G 
such that
G = Gi + G2, Gi n G2 = {0},
card(G1) = card(G 2) = ш1.
Show that there exist two subsets X and Y of G satisfying the following properties:
(a) 
X U Y = G, X n Y = 0;
(b) card(X n (G 1 + g)) < ш for any g e G;
(c) card(Y n (G2 + g)) < ш for any g e G.
For this purpose, first represent G 1 and G2 in the form of two injective wi -sequences
G1 = {g£ : £ < 6'U}, 
G2 = {hp : £ < Mi}.
Then the group G can be written as
G = {g^ + h.. : £ < ^i, < < mi }.
Now, putting
X = {g^ + hc : £ < < < wi},
Y = {g£ + hc : wi > £ > <},
verify that X and Y are as required.
10.3 
* Let (G, +) be a commutative group such that there are three subgroups G i, 
G2, G3 of G satisfying the following two conditions:
(*) card(Gi) = card(G2) = card(G3) = wi;
(** ) G is a direct sum of G i, G2, and G3.
Prove that there exist three pairwise disjoint subsets X, Y and Z of G such that:
(a) 
G = X U Y U Z;
(b) for each g e G, the set X n (Gi + g) is finite;
(c) for each g e G, the set Y n (G2 + g) is finite;
(d) for each g e G, the set Z n (G3 + g) is finite.
Argue as follows. The subgroups Gi, G2, G3 of G can be expressed in the form of 
three injective wi -sequences:
Gi = {xa : a < wi}, G2 = {yp : /t < ^1}, G3 = {zy : у < wi}.
So, any element g of G admits a unique representation in the form
g = X a + y p + Z у,

10 A Decomposition of an Uncountable Solvable Group into Three Negligible Sets
153
wherexa e G1, уp e G2, and zy e G3. Introduce the three auxiliary sets
A = {xa + уp + Zy e G : a > fi, a > у},
В = {xa + yp + Zy e G : a < fi, fi > у},
C = {xa + yp + Zy e G : a < у, fi < у}.
Check the validity of the following
А П В = В П C = C П A = 0,
A U В U C = G 1 + G2 + G3 = G,
(Vx e Gi)(card(А П (x + G2 + G3)) < to),
(Vy e G2)(card(В П (G1 + у + G3)) < w), 
(Vz e G3)(card(C П (G1 + G2 + z)) < w).
Then apply the result of Exercise 10.1, according to which one has:
(i) for every element x of G 1, the equality
А П (x + G 2 + G 3) = U^ U U^
holds true, where U; П U3 = 0 and
(Vz e G3)(card(u| П (x + G2 + z)) < to),
(Vy e G2)(card(u| П (x + у + G3)) < w);
(ii) for every element y of G2 , the equality
В П (G 1 + у + G3) = Vy1 U Vy3
holds true, where Vy П Vy3 = 0 and
(Vz e G3)(card(vy П (G1 + у + z)) < w),
(Vx e G1)(card(V,3 П (x + у + G3)) < w);
(iii) for every element z of G3, the equality
C П (G 1 + G2 + z) = wy U Wf
holds true, where Wy1 П Wf = 0 and
(Уу e G2)(card(W.1 П (G1 + у + z)) < w),
(Vx e G 1)(card(W'| П (x + G2 + z)) < w).

154 
10 A Decomposition of an Uncountable Solvable Group into Three Negligible Sets
Finally, define
X = (u{Vy1 : y e G2}) u (u{W3 : z e G3}),
Y = (u{u2 : x e G1}) u (u{wf : z e G3}),
Z = (u{U3 : x e G1}) u (u{Vy3 : у e G2}), 
and verify that
X n Y = Y n Z = Z n X = 0,
X u Y u Z = A u В u C = G,
card(X n (G 1 + y + z)) < ш
(y e G2, z e G3),
card(Y n (x + G2 + z)) < ш
(x e G1, z e G3),
card(Z n (x + y + G3)) < ы
(x e G1, y e G2).
This yields the required result.
10.4* Suppose that there exist three pairwise disjoint subsets X, Y, and Z of the 
Euclidean space R3 such that:
(a) 
X u Y u Z = R3;
(b) 
X is finite in direction R x {0} x {0};
(c) 
Y is finite in direction {0} x R x {0};
(d) 
Z is finite in direction {0} x {0} x R.
Show that in this case the Continuum Hypothesis (CH) holds.
Argue as follows. Suppose to the contrary that ш1 < c and take a set T c R with 
card(T) = ш1. Then
card(T x T) = w^ = ш1 < c.
Further, introduce the set
Z * = {(x,y,z) e Z : (x,y) e T x T}.
Since Z is finite in direction {0} x {0} x R, one has
card(Z*) < ш • w1 = w1 < c.
Consequently, there exists a point t1 e R such that the plane
P = {(x, y, t1) : (x,y) e R x R}
does not intersect the set Z*. This gives the implication
(x, y) e T x T ^ (x, y, ti) e (R3 \ Z) = X u Y.
Let now К be a countably infinite subset of T. Since Y is finite in direction 
{0} x R x {0}, the set
{(x,y,t1) e Y : (x,y) e К x T} 

10 A Decomposition of an Uncountable Solvable Group into Three Negligible Sets 
155
is at most countable. Therefore, there exists a point t2 e T such that the straight line
L = {(x,t2,ti) : x e R}
does not intersect the set {(x,y,t1) e Y : (x, y) e К x T}. The latter means that
x e К ^ (x, t2, ti) e (R3 \ (Y U Z)) = X,
which contradicts the fact that is finite in direction R x {0} x {0} (see (b)). 
The obtained contradiction implies the desired result.
Remark 10.12 The statements presented in Exercises 10.3 and 10.4 are essentially 
due to Sierpinski (in this connection, see his monograph [155]).
10.5 
* Let E be a base (ground) set, G be a group of transformations of E, and let 
p be a G-quasi-invariant measure defined on some G-invariant ^-algebra of subsets 
of E and satisfying the countable chain condition (Suslin condition), which means 
that every disjoint family of -measurable sets of strictly positive -measure is at 
most countable.
Let X be an arbitrary p-measurable set in E.
Prove that there exists a countable family {g,- : i e I} of elements of G such that 
the set
X* = U{g,- (X) : i e I}
is almost G-invariant with respect to p, i.e., for each transformation g e G, the 
equality p(g(X*)дX*) = 0 holds true.
For this purpose, use the method of transfinite induction up to w1. Namely, 
supposing otherwise, i.e., that the above assertion is false, construct by transfinite 
recursion an increasing (by inclusion) family {X^ : £ < ш1} of p-measurable subsets 
of E which satisfy the following three properties:
(a) 
X0 = X ;
(b) for any ordinal % < ы1, the set X^ is representable in the form
X^ = U{htj(X) : j e J(£)},
where {hgj : j e J(£)} is some (depending on £) countable family of transfor­
mations from G ;
(c) for each ordinal £ < Ы1, the set X^+1 \ X^ is of strictly positive p-measure.
Finally, consider the family of sets {X^+1 \ X^ : % < ы1} and conclude that this 
family contradicts the Suslin condition for p.
10.6 Assume the Continuum Hypothesis and let G0 be a countably infinite non- 
collinear subgroup of the group of all translations of the Euclidean plane R2 .
Show that there exists a partial function ф : R ^ R such that:

156
10 A Decomposition of an Uncountable Solvable Group into Three Negligible Sets
(a) the graph Ф of ф is 22-thick in the plane R2;
(b) the set G0 + Ф c R2 is almost invariant under the group of all translations of R2, 
i.e., the inequality
card((h + G0 + Ф)д(60 + Ф)) < c
holds true for each h e R2.
Infer from (a) and (b) that:
(c) the set Ф is negligible in R2 with respect to the group of all translations of R2;
(d) the set G0 + Ф is not negligible in R2 with respect to the same group;
(e) every vertical straight line in R2 has at most countably many common points with 
G 0 + Ф.
Finally, putting
G = R2, 
H = {0} x R, 
X = G0 + Ф,
verify the validity of the assertion formulated in Remark 10.3.
10.7 Let (G, +) be an arbitrary uncountable commutative group.
Prove that there exist three subgroups G1, G2, and G3 of G such that
card(G 1) = card(G 2) = card(G 3) = ш1,
and the equalities
G 1 n(G 2 + G 3) = {0},
G2 n(G3 + G 1) = {0},
G3 n(G 1 + G2) = {0}
hold true (in other words, G1 + G2 + G3 is a direct sum of the groups G1, G2 and 
G3).
For this purpose, construct the required subgroups G1, G2, and G3 by using the 
method of transfinite recursion (up to w1).
Remark 10.13 Recall Kulikov’s deep theorem concerning the algebraic structure of 
commutative groups. (see [48] or [115]). According to this theorem, every commu­
tative group (H, +) admits a representation in the form
H = U{Hn : n < ш},
where {Hn : n < ш} is an increasing (by inclusion) family of subgroups of H, and 
each Hn (n < w) is a direct sum of cyclic groups.
It can easily be seen that the result of Exercise 10.7 is an almost straightforward 
consequence of Kulikov’s theorem. However, the same result can be obtained by a 
direct argument, without referring to Kulikov’s profound theorem.
10.8 Verify the validity of the assertion formulated in Remark 10.9.

onto H.
Show that the group (G, •) admits a decomposition into a many subsets, all of

In this chapter we will again be dealing with measures invariant (or, more generally, 
quasi-invariant) under various transformation groups. We will be interested in the 
behavior of certain kinds of sets with respect to such measures. Actually, we will be 
concerned below with some unexpected relationships between so-called negligible 
subsets and absolutely nonmeasurable subsets of uncountable solvable groups.
Let E be a ground set and let G be a group of transformations of E. So, the pair 
(E, G) is a space equipped with a transformation group.
Recall that a set X с E is G-negligible (in E) if the following two conditions are 
fulfilled for X:
(a) there exists a nonzero ^-finite G-invariant (G-quasi-invariant) measure p on E 
such that X e dom(p);
(b) for every ^-finite G-quasi-invariant measure v on E such that X is in dom( v), 
the equality v (X) = 0 holds true.
Also, recall that a set Y с E is G-absolutely nonmeasurable (in E) if Y £ dom(e) 
for all nonzero ^-finite G-quasi-invariant measures в on E.
If (G, •) is a group, then we may consider G as a ground set E and we may also 
take the group of all left (right) translations of G as a group of transformations of E.
Obviously, identifying G with the group of all left translations ofG, we can speak 
of left G-invariant (left G-quasi-invariant) measures on E (= G) and, respectively, 
we can consider G-negligible and G-absolutely nonmeasurable subsets of G.
Example 11.1 If (G, •) is an arbitrary uncountable solvable group, then there exists 
a G-absolutely nonmeasurable subset ofG (in this connection, see e.g. [91]). At the 
same time, it is still unknown whether there exists a Г-absolutely nonmeasurable set 
in any uncountable group (Г, •).
The main goal of this chapter is to show, for a certain class of spaces (E, G), that 
there exist two G-negligible sets in E, the union of which turns out to be G-absolutely 
nonmeasurable in E.

11 Negligible Sets Versus Absolutely Nonmeasurable Sets
In particular, it will be proved below that if E itself is an uncountable solv­
able group and G coincides with the group of all left translations of E, then the 
above-mentioned fact holds for (E, G). Clearly, this result is a generalization of the 
statement formulated in Example 11.1. It should be noted that the basic technical 
tools which provide the required result are motivated by the method of surjective 
homomorphisms (cf. [90, 91, 102]).
For our further purposes, we need several lemmas.
The first of them (i.e., Lemma 11.2 below) is a strengthened version of a result 
obtained in [78].
Lemma 11.2 Let a space (E, G) satisfy the following two properties:
(1) card( E) = ш1 and the group G acts freely and transitively in E;
(2) there are two subgroups G0 and G 1 of G such that
card(G0) = ш, card(G 1) = ы1, G0 n G 1 = {Id^},
where hl/.- is the identity transformation of E.
Then there exist two disjoint G-negligible subsets T1 and T2 of E such that the set 
T1 U T2 is G-absolutely nonmeasurable in E.
Proof We slightly modify a construction of a G-absolutely nonmeasurable subset 
of E (see [91, Chapter 11, Lemma 3]). First, let us observe that (1) immediately 
implies the equality card(G) = ш1. So, we may take an ш1 -sequence {Г^ : % < ы1} 
of subgroups of G , such that:
(a) Г0 = G0 ;
(b) for all ordinals % < ы1, we have card(r^) = w;
(c) for each ordinal % < ы1, the set U{Q : £ < %} is a proper subset of Г^ 
(in particular, this ш1 -sequence of subgroups of G is strictly increasing by 
inclusion);
(d) U{Q : %<ш1} = G.
Further, fix a point у e E and, for any ordinal number % < ы1, put
Y€ = Г%(У) \ U{Q(У) : < < %}.
A straightforward verification shows that the family of sets {Y^ : % < ы1} forms 
a partition of E and each Y^ is a Г^. -invariant subset of E, where the group Г^. is 
defined by the formula
Г^ = U{Q : < < %}.
According to (c), the group Г^ is a proper subgroup of Г^. Also, by virtue of the 
free action of G in E, it is not hard to see that
card(Y^) = ы (% < ш1).
Now, for each ordinal number % < ш1, introduce the group

11 Negligible Sets Versus Absolutely Nonmeasurable Sets
161
Gi,^ = Gi П Г^.
Obviously, the ш1 -sequence {G 1,^ : % < ы1} of groups is increasing by inclusion 
and
U{G 1,^ : ^<u1} = Gi.
Fix for now an ordinal % < ы1 and consider the two partitions of Y> associated with 
the groups Gо and G 1,^, respectively. In other words, we will be dealing with the 
partition of Y^ into G0-orbits and with the partition of Y^ into G 1,^-orbits. Taking 
into account the free action of G on E and the relation
Gо П Gi = {Id^},
we infer that the above-mentioned two partitions of Y> are transversal to each other. 
The latter phrase means that any equivalence class of the first partition has at most 
one common point with any equivalence class of the second partition. Starting with 
this fact, we can define by recursion an ^-sequence {x^,0, xg,1, ..., xg,k, ...} of 
points from Y^ such that:
(i) Gо({x^,к : к < w}) = Y^;
(ii) for any two distinct natural numbers к and m, the point x^,k does not belong to 
the orbit G 1,^(x^,m).
Indeed, let {Z^,k : к < ш} denote an injective family of all those G0-orbits which 
are contained in Y>. Take Z^,0 and choose a point x^,0 in Z^,0. Suppose that, for a 
natural number к > 1, the elements
x^,0 e Z^,0, x^,1 e Z^,1,..., x^,k-1 e Z^,k-1
have already been defined and that they lie in pairwise distinct G 1,^-orbits. Consider 
the set
Pk = G 1,^(x^,0) U G 1,^(x^,1) U • • • U G1,^(x^,k-1).
Clearly, we have the relations
card(Pk П Z^,k) < k, card(Z^,k) = w.
Consequently, there exists an element x e Z^,k \ Pk. So, we can put
x %,k = x.
Therefore, for each ordinal £ < ш1, we get the corresponding ^-sequence 
{x^,k : к < ш} of points from Y>, fulfilling conditions (i) and (ii).
Now, we define
X = {xg,k : £ < ^1, к < ш}
and we are going to verify that the set X is G-absolutely nonmeasurable in E.

162
11 Negligible Sets Versus Absolutely Nonmeasurable Sets
Indeed, on the one hand, we may write
Gо(X) = U{Gо({x^,k : к < w}) : f < wi} = U{F^ : f < wi} = E,
and the above relation implies that if X is measurable with respect to some nonzero 
^-finite G-quasi-invariant measure ц on E, then the inequality ц (X) > 0 must hold.
On the other hand, let us take an arbitrary element g e G 1 \ 'Id/,-}. Then there 
exists an ordinal f0 < ш1 for which g e G 1,^0. Further, for any f < ш1, define 
X^ = {x^,k : к < ш}. Evidently, we have
(Vf < ш1)(card(Xg) = ш).
Also, the equality X = U{Xg : f < w1} holds true and the inclusion
g(X) П X c U{g(X() П Хл : 
<Ш1, т] < Ш1}
is trivially fulfilled.
If £ < ы1 and т < M satisfy the relations f0 < g and f0 < т, then
g (Xc )П Xv = 0.
In addition to this, if g < f0 and т > f0, or, respectively, g > f0 and т < f0, then
g(XC) П Хл = g(XC П g-1 (Хл)) c g(Y^ П Y,) = 0,
or, respectively,
g(Xc)П Xл c Yc П Y^ = 0.
We thus get the inclusion
g(X) П X c (U{g(XC) : < < f0}) U (U{X„ : т < ft})
and, therefore,
card(g(X) П X) < ш.
Finally, suppose that g and h are any two distinct elements of G 1. Then
h-1 ° g + Id/,-, 
h-1 ° g e Gi,
and, according to the fact established above, we may write
card((h-1 ° g)(X) П X) < ш,
which implies at once that
card(g(X) П h(X)) < ш.
The last inequality shows us that if the set X were measurable with respect to some 
^-finite G-quasi-invariant measure ц on E, then ц (X) = 0.

163
So, we simultaneously obtain p (X) > 0 and p (X) = 0. Obviously, this yields a 
contradiction and hence X is a G-absolutely nonmeasurable subset of E.
Now, let us return to the partition {Y^ : f < ы1} of our ground set E and introduce 
the following two sets:
71 = U{X П Y^ : £ < w1, £ is an odd ordinal number},
T2 = U{X П Y^ : £ < m1, £ is an even ordinal number}.
Clearly, we may write
X = 71 U T2, 
Т1 П T2 = 9.
Further, if {g{ : i e I} is an arbitrary countable family of elements of G, then
E \ U{gi (71) : i e I} + 9,
E \u{gi (72) : i e I} + 9.
It is not hard to infer from this property of the sets 71 and 72 that there exist two 
probability G-invariant measures p1 and e2 on E such that
71 e dom(pf), 72 e dom(Ц2), Е1 (71) = Ц2(72) = 0.
Finally, keeping in mind the relations 71 с X and 72 с X, we immediately deduce 
that
card(g(71) П h(T1)) < ы,
card(g(72) П h(72)) < ы
for any two distinct transformations g and h from the uncountable group G1.
So, we can conclude that both 71 and 72 are G-negligible sets in E, and Lemma 
11.2 has thus been proved.

Lemma 11.3 Let (G, •) and (H, •) be two groups and let ф be a surjective homomor­
phism of (G, •) onto (H, •).
The following assertions hold for any two sets X с H and Y с H :
(1) if X is an H-negligible subset of H, then ф— (X) is a G-negligible subset of G;
(2) if Y is an H-absolutely nonmeasurable subset of H, then ф~1 (Y) is a G-absolutely 
nonmeasurable subset of G.
Proof The validity of assertion (1) was established in the proof of Lemma 10.4.
So, it remains to show the validity of assertion (2). Suppose to the contrary 
that Y is an H-absolutely nonmeasurable set in H, but its pre-image ф~1 (Y) is not 
G-absolutely nonmeasurable in G. Then we may take some nonzero ^-finite left 
G-quasi-invariant measure v on G such that ф~1 (Y) e dom(v). Without loss of 
generality, we may assume that v is a probability measure. For the group (H, •), 
consider the family of sets
S = {Z с H : Ф-1 (Z) e dom(v)}.

164
11 Negligible Sets Versus Absolutely Nonmeasurable Sets
Clearly, S is a left H-invariant ^-algebra of subsets of H and Y e S. We now put
V(Z) = v(ф- (Z)) 
(Z eS).
A direct verification shows that is a probability left H-quasi-invariant measure on 
S and
V (Y) = v (ф-1 (Y)),
which contradicts the fact that Y is an H-absolutely nonmeasurable subset of H.
The obtained contradiction completes the proof of Lemma 11.3. 
□
The next two propositions are purely algebraic and can be deduced from well- 
known theorems of the general theory of commutative groups (cf. [48, 115]).
Lemma 11.4 If (H, +) is an uncountable commutative group, then there exist two 
subgroups H0 and H1 of (H, +) such that:
(1) card(H0) = ы and card(H1) = u1 ;
(2) 
H0 П H1 = {0}, where 0 stands for the neutral element of H.
The proof of Lemma 11.4 can easily be deduced from Exercise 10.7.
Lemma 11.5 If (, +) is an uncountable commutative group, then there exists a 
surjective homomorphism
ф : (G, +)^(H, +),
where (H, +) is some commutative group of cardinality ш1.
Proof Since (G, +) is uncountable, there exists a subgroup G0 ofG whose cardinality 
is equal to Ш1. At the same time, there exists a divisible commutative group (H0, +) 
containing G0 as a subgroup and having the same cardinality ш1 (for more details, 
see Exercise 8.7). Let ф0 denote the identical embedding of G0 into H0. In view of 
Exercise 8.5, this embedding can be extended to a homomorphism ф of G into H0.
Defining H = ф(G), we see that H is as required, which completes the proof. □
Lemma 11.6 Let (G, •) be a group and let H be a normal subgroup of G such that 
card(G/H) < ы.
The following two assertions hold:
(1) if a set X is H-absolutely nonmeasurable in H, then X is also G-absolutely 
nonmeasurable in G;
(2) ifa set Y is H-negligible in H, then Y is also G -negligible in G.
The proof of Lemma 11.6 readily follows from the definitions of negligible sets 
and absolutely nonmeasurable sets.
Theorem 11.7 If (G, +) is an uncountable commutative group, then there exist two 
disjoint G-negligible subsets Y1 and Y2 in G such that their union Y1 U Y2 is G- 
absolutely nonmeasurable in G.

11 Negligible Sets Versus Absolutely Nonmeasurable Sets
165
Proof According to Lemma 11.5, there exists a surjective homomorphism
ф : (G, +)^(Н, +)
for some commutative group (Н, +) of cardinality w1. Applying Lemmas 11.2 and 
11.4 to (Н, +), we obtain two disjoint Н-negligible subsets X1 and X2 of Н such that 
the set X1 U X2 is Н-absolutely nonmeasurable in Н. Further, let
Yi = ^-i (Xi), 
Y2 = ^-i (X2).
By virtue of Lemma 11.3, both sets 1 and 2 are G-negligible in G. Also, in view 
of the same lemma, the set
Yi U Y2 = ^-i (Xi) U ^-i (X2) = ^-i (Xi U X2)
turns out to be G-absolutely nonmeasurable in G .
This finishes the proof of Theorem 11.7. 
□
Theorem 11.8 If (G, •) is an uncountable solvable group, then there exist two dis­
joint G -negligible sets Yi and Y2 in G such that the set Yi U Y2 is G -absolutely 
nonmeasurable in G.
Proof Since (G, •) is solvable, there exists a finite sequence
{e} = G0 c Gi c G2 c ••• c Gn-i c Gn = G
of subgroups of G satisfying these two properties:
(i) for each natural index к e [i, n], the group Gk-i is normal in the group Gk;
(ii) for each natural index к e [i, n], the quotient group Gk/Gk-i is commutative.
To demonstrate the validity of the assertion of Theorem 11.8, we argue by induction 
on n.
Ifn = i, then the uncountable group G = G is commutative, and we may directly 
apply Theorem 11.7 to this G .
Suppose now that the assertion holds true for a natural number n - i > i and let 
us establish its validity for n.
For this purpose, consider the commutative quotient group
Н = G/G-i,
where, as before, G = G . Here only two cases are possible.
(a) the group Н = G/G-i is uncountable.
In this case, we take the canonical surjective homomorphism
Ф : (Gn, •) ^ (Н,+).
By virtue of Theorem 11.7, there are two disjoint Н-negligible subsets Xi and X2 in 
Н such that their union Xi U X2 is Н-absolutely nonmeasurable in Н. We put

166
11 Negligible Sets Versus Absolutely Nonmeasurable Sets
Yi = ф-1 (Xi), 
Y2 = ф-1 (X2).
Then, keeping in mind Lemma 11.3, we see that both sets 1 and 2 are disjoint and 
-negligible in . We also deduce that the set
Yi U Y2 = ^-1 (Xi ) U ^-1 (X2) = ^-1 (Xi U X2)
turns out to be -absolutely nonmeasurable in .
(b) the group = /-i is countable.
In this case, in view of the uncountability of = , the group -i is necessarily 
uncountable and we can apply the inductive assumption to this -i. So, there are 
two disjoint -i-negligible subsets Yi and Y2 of -i such that the set Yi U Y2 is
-i-absolutely nonmeasurable in -i. Now, Lemma 11.6 yields that Yi and Y2 are 
simultaneously -negligible subsets of and their union Yi U Y2 is a -absolutely 
nonmeasurable set in .
Theorem 11.8 has thus been proved. 
□
Example 11.9 Let (G, •) be an arbitrary uncountable solvable group. It directly 
follows from Theorem 11.8 that there are two disjoint -negligible sets Yi and Y2 in 
G possessing the following property:
For any nonzero ^-finite left G-quasi-invariant measure ^ on G, at least one of 
the sets Yi and Y2 is nonmeasurable with respect to .
In this connection, it is useful to compare the obtained result with the main 
result from Chapter 10, according to which every uncountable solvable group (G, •) 
admits a partition {i, 2, 3} such that all three sets i, 2, 3 are G-negligible in 
(G, •). As mentioned in Chapter 10, the members of this partition have the following 
property:
For any nonzero a -finite left G-quasi-invariant measure /j. on G, at least two of 
the sets i , 2, 3 are nonmeasurable with respect to .
Exercises
11.1 Let E be a ground set and let Gi and G2 be two groups of transformations of 
E such that Gi c G2.
Verify that if X is a G i-absolutely nonmeasurable subset of E, then X is also a 
G2-absolutely nonmeasurable subset of E.
Infer from this fact that there exists no subset of E which is G2-negligible and, 
simultaneously, Gi-absolutely nonmeasurable.
For concrete E, Gi and G2, give an example of a G2-absolutely nonmeasurable 
set in E which is G i-negligible.

Remark 11.10 As shown in [30], there exists a uniform (in direction {0} x R) set Z 
in R2 such that
u{g< (Z) : i e I} = R2
for a certain countable family {gf : i e I} of isometric transformations of R2. This 
property of Z trivially implies that Z is absolutely nonmeasurable with respect to 
the class of those nonzero ^-finite measures on R2 which are quasi-invariant under 
the group of all isometries of R2. On the other hand, the same Z is R2-negligible, so 
is not R2 -absolutely nonmeasurable.

Y is 1-negligible in R.

11 Negligible Sets Versus Absolutely Nonmeasurable Sets
Remark 11.12 Using the methods presented in this chapter, it can be proved that 
if (G, +) is an uncountable commutative group and X is a subset of G, then the 
following two assertions are equivalent:
(1) X contains at least one G-absolutely nonmeasurable set;
(2) there exists a countable family {g{ : i e I} of elements of G such that G = 
U{g,- + X : i e 1}.
In particular, taking (G, +) = (R, +) , we may conclude that any Vitali set in R 
contains an R-absolutely nonmeasurable subset. In this context, it is appropriate 
to mention once more that there exist Vitali sets in R which are not R-absolutely 
nonmeasurable.

Measurability Properties of Mazurkiewicz Sets
In this chapter we consider the family of Mazurkiewicz subsets of the Euclidean 
plane R2 from the measure-theoretical point of view. In particular, it is shown below 
that all Mazurkiewicz sets are R2-negligible and that there exists a Mazurkiewicz 
set which is R2 -absolutely negligible. On the other hand, it is also proved that there 
exists a Mazurkiewicz set which is not R2 -absolutely negligible.
We begin by recalling that in 1914 Mazurkiewicz [125] carried out a transfi- 
nite construction of a subset A of the Euclidean plane R2, having the following 
extraordinary property:
Every straight line in R2 meets A in exactly two points.
Later on, motivated by this result, the following definition was introduced:
A set В c R2 is called a Mazurkiewicz subset of R2 if card(В П I) = 2 for any 
straight line lying in R2 .
It turned out that the descriptive structure of Mazurkiewicz sets can be rather 
complicated. For instance, these three results are well known:
(1) if a Mazurkiewicz set is analytic in R2 , then it is also Borel in R2 ;
(2) there exists a Mazurkiewicz set which is of Lebesgue measure zero and of first 
Baire category;
(3) there exists a Mazurkiewicz set which is Lebesgue nonmeasurable and does not 
possess the Baire property.
Relatively recently it was established that in Godel’s Constructible Universe L there 
exists a Mazurkiewicz set which is co-analytic (cf. [127, 128]), but it is still unknown 
whether a Mazurkiewicz set can be Borel in R2 .
In the present chapter we would like to discuss measurability properties of 
Mazurkiewicz sets with respect to the class M'(R2) of all nonzero ^-finite 
translation-invariant measures on R2 .
Let us repeat some notions in terms of this class.
A set X c R2 is called negligible with respect to the class M'(R2) (briefly, 
R2 -negligible) if the following two conditions are satisfied:

12 Measurability Properties of Mazurkiewicz Sets
(*) there exists at least one measure v e M'(R2) such that X e dom(v);
(** ) for every measure p e M'(R2), the relation X e dom(p) implies the equality 
p (X) = 0.
A set Y c R2 is called absolutely negligible with respect to M'(R2) (briefly, R2- 
absolutely negligible) if, for every measure ц e M'(R2), there exists a measure 
p' e M'(R2) extending ц and such that Y e dom(p') and ц'(Y) = 0.
Let e be an arbitrary nonzero vector in the plane R2.
We say that a set Z c R2 is uniform in direction e if card(/ П Z) < 1 for any 
straight line I c R2 parallel to e (cf. [119]).
We say that a set Z c R2 is finite in direction e if card(/ П Z) < ш for any straight 
line I c R2 parallel to e (see [155]).
We say that a set Z c R2 is countable in direction e if card(/ П Z) < ш for any 
straight line I c R2 parallel to e (see again [155]).
Lemma 12.1 Ifa set Z c R2 is finite in some direction e e R2, then Z is negligible 
with respect to the class M'(R2).
In particular, every Mazurkiewicz set is negligible with respect to the same class 
of measures.
Actually, Lemma 12.1 is a very special case of Lemma 10.2. For this reason, the 
proof of Lemma 12.1 is omitted here.
Remark 12.2 It is not difficult to prove that there exists a measure on R2 which 
extends the standard two-dimensional Lebesgue measure Z2, is invariant under the 
group of all isometric transformations of R2 and contains in its domain the family 
of all Mazurkiewicz sets.
In connection with Lemma 12.1, it is natural to ask:
Is every Mazurkiewicz set absolutely negligible with respect to the class M '(R2) ?
We shall see that the answer to this question is negative, i.e., there exist 
Mazurkiewicz subsets of R2 which are not absolutely negligible with respect to 
M'(R2).
Nevertheless, it can be demonstrated that among Mazurkiewicz sets there are 
absolutely negligible ones.
Let n > 1 be a natural number and let R" denote, as usual, the Euclidean space 
of dimension . Recall that R can also be treated as a vector space over the field Q 
of all rational numbers. Any basis of the latter space is usually called a Hamel basis 
(cf. [59]).
Lemma 12.3 Every Hamel basis of the space R", where n > 1, is an absolutely 
negligible subset of R" with respect to the class M'(R").
For a proof of Lemma 12.3, see [79]. Note that in [79] only the case of n = 1 
is considered, but the same argument works for any natural number n > 1 (cf. also 
Exercise 12.21).

12 Measurability Properties of Mazurkiewicz Sets 
171
Lemma 12.4 There exists a Mazurkiewicz subset of R2 that is a Hamel basis of R2.
Proof For our further purposes, it is convenient to introduce the following notation:
a = the least ordinal number of cardinality c;
{Ig : £ < a} = an «'-sequence consisting of all straight lines in R2;
{zg : £ < a} = an «'-sequence consisting of all points of R2.
We may assume, without loss of generality, that the partial family
{Ig : £ < a & £ is an odd ordinal}
contains all straight lines of R2, and that the partial family
{z^ : £ < a & £ is an even ordinal}
contains all points of R2 .
In addition to the above, we will use the symbol (, z) to denote the straight line 
in R2 which passes through two distinct points у e R2 and z e R2.
We are going to construct by the method of transfinite recursion an increasing 
(by inclusion) «'-sequence {Zg : £ < a} of subsets of R2, for which the following 
conditions will be satisfied:
(a) card(Z^) < card(£) + ш for any ordinal £ < a;
(b) every set Z^ is linearly independent over the field Q of all rational numbers;
(c) every Z^ is a set of points in general position in R2;
(d) if an ordinal £ < a is odd, then
card(Z^ П Ig) = 2;
(e) if an ordinal £ < a is even, then the point z^ belongs to the linear hull (over Q) 
of the set Z^.
Suppose that, for an ordinal £ < a, the partial family {Z^ : £ < £} has already been 
constructed fulfilling the above conditions (a), (b), (c), (d), and (e). Let us put
Z(£) = U{ZC : £ < £}.
Observe that the set Z(£) is linearly independent over Q and, at the same time, Z(£) 
is a set of points in general position in R2 . Also, it is clear that
card(Z(£)) < card(£) + ш.
Now, consider the two possible cases.
1. The ordinal £ is odd.
In this case, we take the straight line Ig and claim that there exists a subset T of Ig 
such that:

172
12 Measurability Properties of Mazurkiewicz Sets
(i) Z(%) U T is linearly independent over Q and, simultaneously, is a set of points 
in general position in R2;
(ii) card((Z(%) U T) П I€) = 2.
Indeed, the validity of our assertion follows from the relation
card(Z(%)) < card(%) + ш < c
and from the fact that the line I g contains continuum many linearly independent 
points over Q.
So, we may define Z^ = Z (%) U T.
Notice that, by virtue of card(T) < 2, we also have
card(Z^) < card(%) + ш.
2. The ordinal % is even.
In this case, we take the point z%. If z% belongs to the linear hull (over Q) of the set
Z(%) = U{Zc : < < %},
then we define Z^ = Z(%).
It remains to consider the situation when z^ is linearly independent (again, over 
Q) of the set Z(%).
In such a situation, we introduce the notation
Ug = the vector space over Q generated by Z (%).
Evidently, z ^ £ U^ and we may write
card(U^) < card(%) + ш < c.
Further, we define the following three sets:
K1 = U{1 (z,z') : z 6 Z(%), z' e Z(%), z + z'},
K2 = z £ + ^1,
K3 = U{/^(z) : z e Z(%)},
where, for each point z 6 Z(%), the symbol Ig(z) denotes the straight line in R2 
passing through z and parallel to the nonzero vector z^.
According to the above definitions, the set
К = K1 U K2 U K3
is a union of straight lines in R2, the total number of which is strictly less than c. 
This immediately implies that
card(R2 \ К) = c

12 Measurability Properties of Mazurkiewicz Sets
173
and, consequently,
card(R2 \ (К U Ug U (Ug + z%))) = c.
Also, it can readily be checked that if z is an arbitrary point from R2 \ К, then
{z}u{z - z^ }u Z (£)
turns out to be a set of points in general position in R2 .
Our goal now is to choose a point z' e R2 \ К so that the set
{z'}u{z'- zg }u Z(£)
is linearly independent over Q. For this purpose, it suffices to find a point z' e R2 \ К 
having the property that, for any two rational numbers p and r, the relation
pz' + r(z' - z^) e U^
necessarily implies the equalities p = r = 0. To see the existence of such a z', let us 
take a family of points
{zt : i e I} c R2 \ (К U U^ U (U^ + z^)),
where card(I) = c and zi - zj t Ug for any two distinct indices i and j from the set 
I.
Supposing, contrary to our assertion, the non-existence of the desired z', we get
Pizi + rf (zi - z^) e U^ 
(i e I),
where rational numbers pi and rf are such that |pi | + |rf | > 0 for each index i e I. 
Since the set Q x Q is countable and the set I is uncountable, there are two distinct 
indices i e I and j e I and two rational numbers p and r satisfying
|P| + |r| > 0,
pzi + r(zi - z^) e U^, 
pzj + r (zj - z^) e U^.
The last two relations imply
(P + r)(zi - zj) e U^,
and we obtain a contradiction, because p + r + 0 and U^ is a vector space over Q. 
The obtained contradiction shows that we may put
Z^ = {z',z'- z^ }u Z (£)
for an appropriate point z' from the family {zt : i e I}. Since we trivially have
z^ = z’ - (z - z^),

174
12 Measurability Properties of Mazurkiewicz Sets
the point zg belongs to the linear hull (over Q) of the set Z^.
Proceeding in this manner, we will come to the family {Z^ : % < a} of subsets 
of R2 , for which all conditions (a), (b), (c), (d), and (e) hold true. Now, we define
Z = U{Z^ : % < a}.
Conditions (b) and (c) give us that the set Z is linearly independent over Q and, 
simultaneously, Z is a set of points in general position in R2 . By virtue of condition 
(d), the same Z is a Mazurkiewicz subset of R2 . Finally, in view of condition (e), the 
set Z is a Hamel basis of R2 .
Lemma 12.4 has thus been proved. 
□
The above lemmas immediately imply the following theorem.
Theorem 12.5 There exists a Mazurkiewicz subset X of R2 which is absolutely 
negligible with respect to the class M'(R2). Therefore, for any measure p e M'(R2), 
there exists a measure p' e M'(R2) extending p and such that X e dom(p') and 
p'( X) = 0.
Proof In view of Lemmas 12.3 and 12.4, it suffices to take as the required X any 
Mazurkiewicz set in R2 that is simultaneously a Hamel basis of R2 . 
□
Lemma 12.6 Let e be a nonzero vector in R2 and let Z be a subset of R2 countable 
in direction e.
Then there exist a set Z0 c R2 and a family {hn : n < ш} c R2 such that:
(1) 
Zo is uniform in direction e;
(2) 
Z c U{hn + Zo : n < ш}.
Proof We may assume, without loss of generality, that the vector e is parallel to the 
axis {0} x R. Since Z is countable in direction e, it suffices to show that, for any 
function ф : R ^ R and for any disjoint countable family {[a„,bn[ : n < ш} of 
half-open subintervals of R such that
^{b„ - an : n < ш} = +то,
there exist a family {hn : n < ш} c R2 and a partial function f : R ^ R having the 
property that:
(a) dom(^) = U{[a„,bn [ : n < ш};
(b) Ф c U{¥ + hn : n < ш}, where Ф and ¥ denote, respectively, the graph of ф 
and the graph of f.
Now, it is not hard to see that the existence of the required {hn : n < ш} and f is 
guaranteed by the assumption £{bn - an : n < ш} = +<x>. 
□
Remark 12.7 Another proof of Lemma 12.6 is presented in [78]. Notice, by the way, 
that in the above proof all vectors h (n < ш) can be taken to be parallel to the axis 
Rx {0}.

Lemma 12.8 Let G, A, and В satisfy the following conditions:
(1) G is a subgroup of the additive group (R2, +) and card(G) < c;
(2) A is a subset of R2 and card(A) < c;
(3) 
В is a Л2-measurable subset of R2 with Л2 (В) > 0.
Then there exists a point z е В such that:
(i) (G + z) П A = 0;
(ii) for any two distinct points а е A and a' е A, the line I (a, a') does not intersect 
the orbit G + z;
(iii) for any two distinct points x е G + z and у е G + z, the line I (x, у) does not 
intersect the set A.
Proof Let us define
Ai = U{/(x, y) : x е G + А, у е G + A, x + у},
^2 = U{1 x(y) : x е G, x + 0, у е A}, 
where the symbol Ix (y) stands for the straight line passing through a point у and 
parallel to a nonzero vector x. Further, consider the set
A3 = (G + A) U (G + A1) U (G + A2).
Obviously, this set is contained in the union of some family of lines in R2 whose 
cardinality is strictly less than c. Since A2(В) > 0, we must have В \ A3 + 0. Pick 
a point z е В \ A3. It is not hard to check that the properties (i), (ii), and (iii) of 
Lemma 12.8 are satisfied by G + z.
This completes the proof. 
□
Lemma 12.9 Let Г be any countably infinite non-collinear subgroup of (R2, +). 
There exists a Mazurkiewicz set Z such that Г + Z has the following property: 
For each countable family {hm : m < ш} c R2, the set
n{hm + Г + Z : m < ш}
is Л2-thick in R2 and the equality card(n{hm + Г + Z : m < ш}) = c holds true.
Proof Denote again by a the least ordinal number of cardinality c and let 
{Gg : £ < a} be an а-sequence of all those countable subgroups of (R2, +) which 
contain Г and satisfy the relation
card(G ^/Г) = ш.
For every group G from the above а-sequence, define the set
S(G) = {£<a : G€ = G}.
We may assume, without loss of generality, that card(H(G)) = c.

12 Measurability Properties of Mazurkiewicz Sets
Further, take a family {В g : % < a} of Borel subsets of R2 such that, for any 
ordinal % < a, the partial family {В^ : £ e S(Gg)} consists of all Borel subsets of 
R2 having strictly positive d2-measure. The existence of {В^ : % < a} is evident.
Finally, let {Ig : % < a} be an а-sequence of all straight lines lying in R2.
By using the method of transfinite recursion, let us construct a double family
{zk,^ : к < ш, % < a}
of points in R2 and a family {T^ : % < a} of subsets of R2 satisfying the following 
conditions:
(1) ({zk,^ : к < ш, % < a}) U (U{T^ : % < a}) is a set of points in general position 
in R2 ;
(2) card(T^) < 2 for each % < a;
(3) if % < a, then zo,^ e В^;
(4) for each % < a, the set Г + {zk, ^ : к < ш} coincides with Gg + zo,^;
(5) card(/^ П ((U{Tr : £ < %}) U {zk,{ : к < ш, £ < %})) = 2 for each % < a.
Suppose that, for an ordinal number % < a, the partial families
{zk,^ : к < ш, < < %}, {TC : < < %}
have already been constructed with the properties corresponding to the conditions 
(1)-(5), and put
G = G €, В = В €, 
A = ({zы : к < ш, < < %}) U (U{T : < < %}).
Observe that A is a set of points in general position in R2. Also,
card(A) < c, card(G) = ш < c, Л2(В) > 0.
So, Lemma 12.8 is applicable to G, A, and В. Let z e В be a point as in Lemma 
12.8 and let us consider the G-orbit G + z of this point. Since we have the relations
G = G g, card(G ^/Г) = ш,
the set G + z is the union of some pairwise disjoint Г-orbits {Zk : к < ш}. Clearly, 
an enumeration of these Г-orbits can be chosen so that z e Zo. Now, we put
zo,^ = z
and define a sequence of points {zk,z : к < ш} in R2 by ordinary recursion. Namely, 
assuming that the finite collection of points
zo,^ e Zo, zi,£ e Zi,..., zk,^ e Zk
has already been determined, consider the Г-orbit Zk+1. Keeping in mind the fact 
that Г is not a collinear subgroup of R2, we deduce that the set Zk+1 cannot be 

12 Measurability Properties of Mazurkiewicz Sets
177
covered by finitely many straight lines in R2. Therefore, there exists a point t e Zk+1 
which does not belong to any line passing through two distinct points from the finite 
set {zo,£,zi,g, ...,zk,^}. We then put
z k+1,£ = t.
Proceeding in this manner, we finally come to the desired sequence of points 
{zk,^ : к < ш}.
According to the above construction, the set
A* = ({zk,c : к < ш, < < %}) u (u{T^ : £<%})
is again in general position in R2. Consider now the straight line Ig and the set 
А* П Ig. Obviously, we have the inequalities
card(A*) < c, 
card(А* П Ig) < 2.
It is not hard to see that there exists a set T c R2 which satisfies the following 
properties:
(a) card(T) < 2;
(b) 
T u A* is a set of points in general position;
(c) card((T u А*) П Ig) = 2.
So, putting T^ = T, we obtain the family {T^ : £ < %}.
The transfinite process just described and continued up to the ordinal a yields the 
two families
{zk,^ : к < ш, % < a}, 
{Tf : % < a}.
A straightforward verification shows us that all conditions (1)-(5) are fulfilled for 
these families. In particular, conditions (1) and (5) immediately imply that
Z = iu,.' : к < ш, % < a} u (u{T^ : % < a})
is a Mazurkiewicz subset of R2. In addition to this, (3) and (4) imply that, for any 
countable family {hm : m < ш} c R2, the set
n{hm + Г + Z : m < ш}
is A2-thick in R2 and satisfies the equality
card(n{hm + Г + Z : m < ш}) = c.
Lemma 12.9 has thus been proved. 
□
Theorem 12.10 Let Z and Г be as in Lemma 12.9.
Then there exists a measure on R2 such that:
(1) 
v is an extension of Л2;
(2) is translation invariant, i.e., R2-invariant;

178
12 Measurability Properties of Mazurkiewicz Sets
(3) (Г + Z) е dom(v) and v(R2 \ (Г + Z)) = 0.
In particular, the Mazurkiewicz set is not R2 -absolutely negligible in R2.
Proof Denote by I the R2-invariant <r-ideal of subsets of R2 generated by the one- 
element family {R2\( Г+Z)}. By virtue of Lemma 12.8, the inner A2 -measure of every 
element of I is equal to zero. So, we may apply to I and Л2 Marczewski’s method 
of extending invariant measures. This method gives us the measure v satisfying (1), 
(2), and (3) of the theorem. Condition (3) trivially implies that Z is not R2-absolutely 
negligible. 
□
Remark 12.11 Let e be any nonzero vector in R2. It is easy to see that the set Г + Z is 
countable in direction e. By Lemma 12.6, there exist a set Z0 c R2 and a countable 
family {hn : n < ш} c R2 such that:
(a) 
Z0 is uniform in direction e;
(b) Г + Z c U{hn + Zq : n < ш}.
Consequently, Z0 is R2-negligible but is not R2-absolutely negligible.
Remark 12.12 In classical point set theory, there are many other interesting exam­
ples of subsets of finite-dimensional Euclidean spaces which possess extraordinary 
(pathological or paradoxical) properties. In this context, let us mention once again 
Vitali sets, Bernstein sets, Luzin sets, Sierpinski sets, etc. All such pathological 
sets can be considered from the point of view of their measurability with respect to 
various classes of measures. In particular, certain measurability properties of Vitali 
sets and of Bernstein sets are discussed in [91] and [97] (see also Chapter 9 of the 
present book).
Exercises
12. 1 Verify that:
(a) no Mazurkiewicz set can be a Vitali type subset of R2, with respect toa countably 
infinite subgroup of the additive group (R2, +);
(b) no Mazurkiewicz set can be a Bernstein set in R2 ;
(c) no Mazurkiewicz set can be a Luzin set in R2 ;
(d) no Mazurkiewicz set can be a Sierpinski set in R2 .
Argue as follows. The assertions (a) and (b) are verified without any difficulties.
For (c), take into account the fact that if the graph of a partial function acting 
from R into R is a Luzin set in R2 , then the first projection of this graph is a Luzin 
set in R.
For (d), keep in mind the analogous fact that if the graph of a partial function 
acting from R into R is a Sierpinski set in R2, then the first projection of this graph 
is a Sierpinski set in R.

12. 2 Assuming CH, prove that there exists a Luzin subset of R2 all points of which 
are in general position, and that there exists a Sierpinski subset of R2 all points of 
which are in general position.
Moreover, assuming MA, show that there exists a generalized Luzin subset of 
R2 all points of which are in general position, and that there exists a generalized 
Sierpinski subset of R2 all points of which are in general position.
12. 3* Let n > 2 be a natural number and let A be an analytic subset of the plane R2 
such that
card (A n I) = n
for every straight line I c R2 which is parallel to the line {0} x R and intersects the 
set pr1 (A).
For any point x e pr1 (A), denote by g(x) the point у e R such that
у = min{z : (x,z) e A}.
Prove that the set {(x, g(x)) : x e pr1 (A)} is analytic in R2.
For this purpose, argue as follows. Take any two rational numbers p and q such 
that p < q and denote by 5p,q the open strip in R2 which is determined by the two 
parallel straight lines у = p and у = q, i.e.,
SP,q = {(х,у) e R2 : p < у < q}.
Further, check that the relation у = g (x) is equivalent to the statement
(3(qi,q2, ...,qn) e Qn)((x, у) e A & (qi < q2 < • • • < qn) &
у < qi & (x e n{pri(A n Sqi,qi+1) : 1 < i < n - 1}).
Deduce from the above-mentioned equivalence that the last formula describes 
some analytic subset of R2, which implies at once that the set {(x,g (x)) : x e pr1 (A)} 
is analytic in R2 .
Using an analogous argument, conclude that A admits a representation
A = u{gf : 1 < i < n},
where each g,- is an analytic set in R2 and, simultaneously, is the graph of a function 
defined on pr1 (A).
12. 4* Let В be a Borel subset of the real line R and let f : В ^ R be a function 
whose graph is an analytic subset of the plane R2.
Prove that is a Borel mapping acting from В into R.
For this purpose, use the separation principle of Luzin (see, e.g., [29, 74, 111, 
119, 130]).
12. 5 Verify that if a Mazurkiewicz subset В of R2 is analytic in R2 , then В is a Borel 
set in R2 .
For this purpose, take into account the results of Exercises 12.3 and 12.4.

12. 6 Let Z be a subset of the plane R2 such that card(Z n I) = c for every straight 
line lying in R2 .
Show that there exists a Mazurkiewicz set A entirely contained in Z.
For this purpose, following Mazurkiewicz’s original argument construct the re­
quired A c Z with the aid of the method of transfinite recursion.
Infer from the above that if Z is a Bernstein set in R2 , then Z contains some 
Mazurkiewicz set.
12. 7 Prove that there exists a Mazurkiewicz set which is of Lebesgue measure zero 
and nowhere dense in R2 .
For this purpose, take the classical Cantor discontinuum on R and put
Z = (C x R)U(R x C).
Then apply to the set Z the result of Exercise 12.6.
12. 8* Show that there exists a Mazurkiewicz set in R2 which is Lebesgue nonmea- 
surable and does not possess the Baire property.
For this purpose, use the method of transfinite recursion and construct a 
Mazurkiewicz subset of R2 which is thick with respect to the Lebesgue measure 
A2 and, simultaneously, is thick in the sense of the Baire property.
12. 9 Verify that on the unit circle S1 of R2 there exists a nowhere dense perfect set 
P of points which cannot be extended to a Mazurkiewicz set in R2.
For this purpose, take as P a set in S1 homeomorphic to the Cantor discontinuum 
C and such that ^ (P) slightly differs from 2л-, where ^ denotes the standard linear 
Lebesgue measure on S1.
12.1 0 Starting with an absolutely negligible Mazurkiewicz set in R2 (see Theorem 
) and considering the canonical projection
12.5
pr1 : R2 ^ R x {0},
show that the image of an absolutely negligible subset of (R2, +), under the surjective 
homomorphism pr1, can coincide with (R, +).
12.1 1 Assume the Continuum Hypothesis and let G be a countably infinite non- 
collinear subgroup of R2 .
Prove that there are two subsets and of R2 satisfying these four conditions:
(1) 
T is a Mazurkiewicz set and Y c G + T;
(2) card ( ) = c;
(3) 
Y is 22-thick, i.e., Y n В + 0 for each Borel set В c R2 with Л2 (В) > 0;
(4) 
Y is almost translation invariant, i.e., for any vector e e R2, the inequality 
card((e + Y)aY) < c holds true.
For this purpose, argue similarly to the proof of Lemma 12.9.

12.1 2 A subset Z of the plane R2 is called poor in R2 if, for each straight line I c R2, 
one has card(Z n I) < c.
Show that there exists a measure on R2 such that:
(a) 
v is an extension of the Lebesgue measure A2;
(b) is invariant under the group of all isometries of R2 ;
(c) all poor subsets of R2 are in the domain of v.
Infer from (c) that every Mazurkiewicz set in R2 is measurable with respect to v and, 
moreover, is of v-measure zero.
12.1 3 Give a direct transfinite construction of a Mazurkiewicz set in R2 which is 
R2-absolutely negligible.
For this purpose, use a purely algebraic characterization of R2-absolutely negli­
gible subsets ofR2 (see, e.g., [91]).
12.1 4 Prove that there exists a subset Z of R2 such that:
(a) 
Z is 22-thick in R2;
(b) card( Z n 5) = 3 for every circumference 5 in R2.
For this purpose, argue similarly to the argument used in the standard construction 
of Mazurkiewicz sets (cf. [51, 125, 155]).
Finally, infer from (a) and (b) that the set Z is not Л2 -measurable.
12.1 5* Show that there exists a function f : R ^ R whose graph is a Hamel basis 
of R2 (consequently, the graph of is an R2 -absolutely negligible subset of R2).
For this purpose, use an argument analogous to the proof of Lemma 12.4.
12.1 6 Prove that there exists a totally imperfect Mazurkiewicz set in R2 .
12.1 7 Working in ZF & DC theory, show that if there is a totally imperfect 
Mazurkiewicz subset of R2, then there is a 22-nonmeasurable subset of R2.
12.1 8* Assuming MA, prove that there exists a universal measure zero set Z c R2 
possessing the following property:
For any straight line c R2, the equality card(Z n ) = c holds true.
In order to show the existence of Z, first try to construct the product set Z' = 
X x Y c R2, where X and Y are some generalized Luzin subsets of R such that every 
straight line
у = ax + b (a + 0)
in R2 has continuum many common points with Z ’.
12.1 9 Assuming MA and using Exercises
 and
, deduce that there exists a 
universal measure zero Mazurkiewicz set in R2 .

Also, verify that the existence of a universal measure zero Mazurkiewicz set in 
the plane cannot be established within ZFC set theory.

12.2 0* Prove that there is a Mazurkiewicz set in R2 which contains the graph of 
some Sierpinski-Zygmund function.
For this purpose, use once again Exercise 12.6.
12.2 1 Let E be an uncountable vector space over the field Q and let {e,- : i e I} be a 
Hamel basis of E. For every natural number n> 0, denote by Hn the set of all those 
vectors in E whose representation via {e,- : i e I} contains at most n many nonzero 
rational coefficients.
Prove that Hn is an absolutely negligible set with respect to the class M'(E) of 
all nonzero ^-finite translation-invariant (quasi-invariant) measures on E.
In particular {ef : i e I} is absolutely negligible with respect to the same class of 
measures.
12.2 2* A subset X of R" is called a set of strong measure zero if, for any sequence 
{sn : n e N} of strictly positive real numbers, there exists a covering {Bn : n e N} 
of X such that each B„ is a ball in R" with radius £n.
Verify that:
(a) the family of all strong measure zero subsets of R" is a <r-ideal invariant under 
the group of all isometries of R" ;
(b) if X is of strong measure zero in R", then X is of universal measure zero in R";
(c) if L is a Luzin set and f : L ^ R" is a continuous mapping, then f (L) is of 
strong measure zero;
(d) there exists no Mazurkiewicz set of strong measure zero (cf. Exercise
).
 12.19
For (d), take into account the simple fact that if is a set in R2 of strong measure 
zero, then pr1 ( ) is a set in R of strong measure zero.

In Chapter 8 we were concerned with examples of translation-invariant (translation- 
quasi-invariant) measures on the Euclidean space R", which are proper extensions 
of the standard n-dimensional Lebesgue measure An.
In this chapter, we would like to consider nonzero <r-finite translation-invariant 
(translation-quasi-invariant) measures on the real line R (= R1 ) that are not, in gen­
eral, extensions of the Lebesgue measure A (= 21). Clearly, the class of such measures 
is substantially wider than the class of all those translation-invariant measures on R 
which extend A.
Let us recall some notions about invariant (quasi-invariant) measures given on an 
abstract space endowed with some transformation group.
Let E be a base (ground) set and let G be a group of transformations of E.
Suppose that j is a nonzero ^-finite G-invariant (G-quasi-invariant) measure on 
E.
It has been proved within ZFC theory that if a group G is uncountable and acts 
freely on E, then there always exist subsets of E nonmeasurable with respect to j 
(see [76]; cf. also [41, 148]). So the domain of differs from the family of all subsets 
of E, i.e., we have the relation
dom( j) + P( E).
In this connection, the natural question arises whether there exists a G-invariant 
(G-quasi-invariant) measure j' on E strongly extending j. This question has been 
studied for various types of spaces (E, G, j).
Undoubtedly, the most interesting case for classical real analysis is when E 
coincides with the n-dimensional Euclidean space R", a group G is a subgroup of 
the group of all isometric transformations of R", and j is a G-invariant extension of 
the standard n-dimensional Lebesgue measure An on R" (see, for instance, [24, 25, 
27, 71, 77, 78, 82, 87, 88, 94, 103, 140, 164, 165, 171, 172]).

13 Extensions of Invariant Measures on R
Another important case is when E = Г, where Г is an uncountable ^-compact 
locally compact topological group, G coincides with the group of all left (right) 
translations of Г, and p is a G-invariant extension of the left (right) Haar measure 
on Г (cf. [62]).
A more general form of the question formulated above is as follows.
For a given space (E, G, p), denote by Mg (p) the family of all measures on E 
extending p and invariant (quasi-invariant) with respect to G.
Supposing that is not identically equal to zero, it is natural to try to evaluate the 
cardinality of Mg (p) in terms of card(G) and card(G).
In the present chapter, we will be dealing with this problem for the very special 
case when E coincides with the real line R and G is the group of all translations 
of R. The method applied in our further considerations is primarily taken from [77] 
and [82].
Treating the real line R as a vector space over the field Q of all rational numbers 
and keeping in mind the existence of a Hamel basis of R, it is not difficult to show 
that the additive group (R, +) admits a representation in the form
R = G + H (G П H = {0}),
where G and H are some subgroups of (R, +) and
card(G) = ш1, 
card(H) < c.
In fact, such a representation of R follows from the existence of a Hamel basis 
of R and from the widely known set-theoretical inequality ш1 < c (the proof of this 
inequality essentially relies on an uncountable form of the Axiom of Choice).
We denote by I the <r-ideal generated by all those subsets X of R which are 
representable in the form
X = Y + H,
where Y c G and card(Y) < w.
It can readily be seen that I is a translation-invariant <r-ideal of sets in R.
We begin with the following lemma.
Lemma 13.1 There exists a partition {Xg : £ < ш1} of R satisfying these two 
properties:
(1) for any ordinal £ < ш1, the set Xg belongs to the a-ideal I;
(2) for each subset S of ш1 and for any r e R, the relation
(u{Xg : £ e Н})д(г + u{Xt : £ e S}) e I
holds true, i.e., the set u{X^ : £ e S} is I-almost translation invariant in R.
The proof of this lemma is given in [77] and [82] (cf. also Exercise 13.1).

13 Extensions of Invariant Measures on R
185
By combining Lemma 13.1 with the well-known (ш x w1)-matrix of Ulam (see 
Exercise 13.2), the next lemma can be deduced.
Lemma 13.2 Let {Xg : % < u1} be a partition of R described in Lemma 13.1 and let 
p be a nonzero a -finite translation-invariant (translation-quasi-invariant) measure 
on R.
There exists a disjoint family {s j : j e J} of subsets of w1 such that:
(1) card(J) = ш1 ;
(2) for each index j e J, the set Zj = U{Xg : £ e Sj } is nonmeasurable with respect 
to ;
(3) pt.(U{Zj : j e J}) = 0, where the symbol pt. denotes, as usual, the inner measure 
associated with .
The proof of Lemma 13.2 is quite similar to the argument presented in [82] (see 
also Exercise 13.3).
Lemma 13.3 Let p be an arbitrary a -finite translation-invariant (translation-quasi- 
invariant) measure on R.
There exists a measure p' on R such that:
(1) p' is translation invariant (translation-quasi-invariant);
(2) p' extends p;
(3) I c dom(p') and p'(Z) = 0 for each Z e I.
Proof If X is any set belonging to I, then the equality
p.( X) = 0
is satisfied, because in R there are uncountably many pairwise disjoint translates of 
X. So we may apply to p and I Marczewski’s standard method for extending our 
measure p (cf. [164, 165]).
Namely, introduce the ^-algebra S' of all those subsets Z of R which admit a 
representation
Z = (Y U X') \ X” 
(Y e dom(p), X’ e I, X” e I)
and define on S' a functional p' by the formula
p'(Z) = p (Y) (Z eS').
It is not hard to verify that p’ is well defined (i.e., the value p’(Z) does not depend on 
a representation of Z in the above-mentioned form), and p’ satisfies the conditions 
(1), (2), and (3) of Lemma 13.3.
This completes the proof of the lemma. 
□
The preceding lemmas enable us to establish the following theorem.

186
13 Extensions of Invariant Measures on R
Theorem 13.4 Let д be a nonzero a -finite translation-invariant (translation-quasi- 
invariant) measure on R. Then the inequality
card(MR(д)) > 2'
holds true.
In particular, there are measures on R strictly extending д and invariant (quasi­
invariant) under the group of all translations of R.
Proof Taking into account Lemma 13.3, we may assume without loss of generality 
that the measure д is complete and I c dom(д).
Let {Zj : j e J} be the disjoint family of subsets of R described in Lemma 13.2. 
Recall that this family has the following properties:
(a) card( J) = w1 and the sets Zj (j e J) are pairwise disjoint;
(b) every set Z ( e J) is nonmeasurable with respect to д;
(c) for each set J0 c J and for every r e R, the equality
д((U{Zj : j e Jo})д(г + u{Z7 : j e Jo})) = 0
holds;
(d) д.(и{Z7- : j e J}) = 0.
Further, taking arbitrarily a subset J1 of J, associate to this J1 the set
Z(J1) = U{Z: eJ1}.
By virtue of (c) and (d), we get:
(e) for every r e R, the set Z(J1) is д-almost translation invariant, i.e.,
д (Z (Л)д(г + Z (Ji))) = 0;
(f) д.(Z(Ji)) = 0.
Consequently, applying Marczewski’s method of extending invariant and quasi­
invariant measures (see the proof of Lemma 13.3), we obtain the measure д j1 on R 
which extends д, is invariant (quasi-invariant) under the group of all translations of 
R, and satisfies the equality
д ji (Z (Ji)) = 0.
Now, let us establish that if J1 and J2 are any two distinct subsets of J, then the 
associated measures д^ and дj2 differ from each other. Indeed, if Ji + J2, then
Ji \ J2 + 0 v J2 \ Ji + 0.
We may suppose that Ji \ J2 + 0, so there is an index j e Ji \ J2. According to the 
definition of д ji, the set Zj turns out to be of д ji -measure zero. On the other hand, 
the same set Zj cannot be of дj2-measure zero. To see why this is, suppose to the 
contrary that

13 Extensions of Invariant Measures on R
187
дJ2 (Zj ) = 0.
Then, keeping in mind the construction of д j2, we must have the equality
Zj = (T и T') \ T”,
where
д(T) = 0, T' c Z(J2), T"c Z(J2).
However, it can easily be verified that the above relations imply the inclusion Zj c T 
and hence the equality (Z) = 0. In particular, we obtain that Z is a -measurable 
set, which contradicts (b).
Thus, we have an injective mapping from the power set P( w1) into the family of all 
those measures on R which extend and are translation-invariant (translation-quasi- 
invariant). The existence of such a mapping trivially yields the desired inequality
card (Mr (д)) > 2 Ш1,
and the proof of Theorem 13.4 is finished. 
□
Remark 13.5 Consider the n-dimensional Euclidean space R", where n > 1. Since 
there exists an isomorphism between the additive groups (R, +) and (R", +), the 
direct analog of Theorem 13.4 holds for the space R" (and, more generally, for any 
uncountable vector space over the field Q of all rational numbers).
Remark 13.6 As an immediate consequence of Theorem 13.4, we get the relation
card(MR(д)) > 2' > 2 = = c.
This relation is a statement of ZFC set theory. Assuming the Continuum Hypothesis 
(CH), we directly obtain that the much stronger inequality
card (MR (д)) > 2c
holds true.
Let д be a measure defined on some ^-algebra of subsets of a ground set E 
(here д is not assumed to be invariant or quasi-invariant under a nontrivial group of 
transformations of E).
The Hilbert space of all square д-integrable real-valued functions on E is usually 
denoted by the symbol L2(д).
If L2 (д) is a separable Hilbert space, then д is called a separable measure. 
Otherwise, д is called a nonseparable measure.
Let the symbol A (= 21) denote again the standard Lebesgue measure on the real 
line R. Kakutani and Oxtoby demonstrated in 1950 that there exist nonseparable 
measures on R belonging to the class MR(2) (see [71]; cf. also [62]). Obviously, all 
those measures are strict (proper) extensions of 2.

13 Extensions of Invariant Measures on R
A radically different approach to the problem of the existence of nonseparable 
measures belonging to MR (A) was given in the work of Kodaira and Kakutani (see 
[103]).
The method of Kakutani and Oxtoby allows one to conclude that there exist at 
least 22c nonseparable measures on R, all of which extend A and are translation 
invariant. Thus, for the Lebesgue measure A on R, the inequality of Theorem 13.4 
can be essentially strengthened and, in fact, we have the following relation:
card(MR (2)) = 22c.
In this context, the natural question arises whether the analogous relation
card(MR()) = 22c
holds for any nonzero ^-finite translation-invariant (translation-quasi-invariant) 
measure on R. We do not know the answer to this question. Nevertheless, as­
suming the Continuum Hypothesis (CH), for a sufficiently large class of nonzero 
^-finite translation-invariant measures p on R, it can be proved that the last equality 
holds true, too.
Let (E, G, p) be a space equipped with a ^-finite G-invariant (G-quasi-invariant) 
measure p.
Recall that p is metrically transitive (or ergodic) if, for any p-measurable set X 
with p (X) > 0, there exists a countable family {gk : к < ш} of transformations 
from G such that
p (E \U{gk(X) : к<ш}) = 0.
It is well known that metrically transitive (ergodic) measures play an important role 
in many topics of mathematical analysis (cf. Chapter 8).
Lemma 13.7 Let (E, G) be a space equipped with a transformation group satisfying 
these two conditions:
(1) card(E) = ш1;
(2) the group G acts freely and transitively on E.
If p is a nonzero a -finite ergodic G-invariant (G-quasi-invariant) measure on E, 
then there exists a partition {Xg : % < u1} of E such that:
(i) every set Xg (% < w1) is p-thick in E, i.e., p*(E \ Xg) = 0;
(ii) for any set S с ш1 and for each transformation g e G, the inequality
card((u{X€ : £ e S})A(g(U{X€ : % e S}))) < ы
is valid.
The proof of Lemma 13.7 is presented in [82] (see also Exercise 13.5).
Starting with the previous lemma and applying a modified version of the method 
of Kakutani and Oxtoby, one can prove the following theorem.

13 Extensions of Invariant Measures on R
189
Theorem 13.8 Assume CH and let (E, G) be a space equipped with a transformation 
group, satisfying the conditions (1) and (2) of Lemma 13.7.
Then,, for every nonzero a -finite ergodic G-invariant (G -quasi-invariant) measure 
p on E, the class Mq (p) contains 22 nonseparable measures.
As has already been pointed out, the proof of Theorem 13.8 is based on Lemma 
13.7 and on the argument of Kakutani and Oxtoby [71].
Remark 13.9 It is easy to see that Marczewski’s method of extending ^-finite in­
variant (quasi-invariant) measures does not substantially change the structure of an 
initial measure. On the other hand, the method of Kakutani and Oxtoby allows one 
to obtain nonseparable translation-invariant extensions of A on R, starting with the 
separable measure A (however, those extensions are not ergodic). Further modifica­
tions of this method were applied to the Haar measure on an uncountable ^-compact 
locally compact Polish topological group (see, for instance, [62]). Various proper­
ties of invariant and quasi-invariant measures given on general algebraic-topological 
structures are thoroughly discussed in [172].
Theorem 13.10 Assume CH and let (E, G) be again a space equipped with a trans­
formation group, satisfying the conditions (1) and (2) of Lemma 13.7.
Then,for every nonzero a -finite ergodic G-invariant (G -quasi-invariant) measure 
p on E, the class Mg (p) contains 22 ergodic measures.
The proof of Theorem 13.10 follows the method presented in [82] for a con­
crete space (E, G,p). Namely, in [82] the role of (E, G,p) is played by the triplet 
(R", Tn, A„), where n > 1 and Tn denotes the group of all translations of R". Under 
CH, the argument given in [82] for (Rn,Tn,An) also works for the more general 
spaces (E,G,p) of Theorem 13.10.
Remark 13.11 Both Theorems 13.8 and 13.10 show that, supposing CH, the car­
dinality of the class Mg(p) is equal to the cardinality of the class of all measures 
on E (where a space (E, G) satisfies (1) and (2) of Lemma 13.7 and p is a nonzero 
^-finite ergodic G-invariant or G-quasi-invariant measure on E). So far, the role of 
CH in these theorems remains unclear. In other words, we do not know whether the 
use of CH is substantial for the validity of Theorems 13.8 and 13.10.

* Let a be any ordinal and let E be a set of cardinality ы a+1.
Prove that there exists a family

of subsets of E, satisfying the following two conditions:
(a) for each £ < ыa, the partial family {E: £ < ыa+1} is disjoint;
(b) for each £ < ыa+1, the set E \ u{E: £ < ыa} has cardinality less than or 
equal to ш a.
Argue as follows. First, identify E with ыa+1. Then, for every £ < ыa+1, take some 
injective mapping
ft : [0, £] ^ ш a.
Define the sets E(% < ыa, 
< ыa+1) by the formula
E^,c = {< < v < шa+i : fn (<) = £}
and check that {E: £ < ыa,

In particular, consider the special case when card(E) = w1.
Remark 13.12 The family of subsets of E indicated above is usually called Ulam’s 
(wa x ыa+1)-matrix (corresponding to E). Taking into account the result of Exercise 
13.2, it is not difficult to prove Ulam’s classical theorem stating that there is no real­
valued measurable cardinal strictly less than the first weakly inaccessible cardinal. 
An analogous theorem holds for two-valued measurable cardinals in terms of the 
first strongly inaccessible cardinal. At present, a number of results are known which 
substantially generalize the above-mentioned theorems (cf. [7, 68, 113, 161]).

13.8 Assume that there exists a probability diffuse measure j whose domain is

not contradict ZFC set theory). Assume also that no cardinal strictly less than c is 
measurable in the same sense.
Show that card(L2(j)) > c (so j cannot be a separable measure).
For this purpose, first check that, for any set А с R with card(A) < c, one has 
j (A) = 0. Further, let {ft : i e I} be an almost disjoint family of functions, all acting 
from [o, 1] into [o, 1] , such that card() > c. The existence of this family follows 
from an old result of Sierpinski (see [155]). Verify that the j-measurable functions 
fi (i e I) are pairwise non-equivalent with respect to j. Consequently, one gets
card(L2(j)) > card(I) > c,

Appendix A
A Characterization of Uncountable Sets in 
Terms of their Self-Mappings
Undoubtedly, the notions of finite (finiteness) and infinite (infiniteness) are two of 
the most fundamental concepts in mathematics and also in analytic philosophy.
If finite sets are defined via natural numbers which are understood in the von 
Neumann sense (see, e.g. [7, 68, 108, 113]), then no serious problems arise, because 
in this case the concept of finiteness becomes absolute and remains invariant in all 
reasonable models of set theory. However, another approach is also widely known. 
According to this second approach, the concept of finiteness is treated as basic one, 
from which the concept of natural numbers is logically derived.
By virtue of the latter (clearly, more abstract) point of view, all natural numbers are 
defined in terms of finiteness or, in other words, the natural numbers are introduced 
as the cardinalities of finite sets.
More precisely, a set E is finite in the Bolzano-Dedekind sense (briefly, BD-finite) 
if there exists no injection from into a proper subset of .
Accordingly, a set E is infinite in the Bolzano-Dedekind sense (briefly, BD- 
infinite) if there exists an injection of E into a proper subset of E .
We would like to recall the reader that the above definitions of finite and infinite 
sets were first introduced by Bolzano and Dedekind (see [16] and [31]). This circum­
stance explains the respective abbreviations: -finite sets and -infinite sets (i.e., 
finite and infinite in the Bolzano-Dedekind sense). However, in the mathematical 
literature the abbreviations -finite sets and -infinite sets are systematically used 
instead of the terms -finite sets and -infinite sets.
The standard and commonly adopted definition of a finite set is as follows (see, 
for instance, [68, 108, 113, 155]).
A set is finite if there exists a natural number equinumerous with , i.e., 
card() = .
Consequently, the standard definition of an infinite set must be as follows:
A set Y is infinite if, for every natural number n, one has card(Y) + n.
Remark A.1 The above definition of an infinite set is effectively equivalent 
(i.e., equivalent within ZF set theory) to the following definition:
A set Y is infinite if, for every natural number n, one has card(Y) > n.

A A Characterization of Uncountable Sets in Terms of their Self-Mappings
Here the inequality card(Y) > n means that Y contains at leat n many pairwise 
different elements. Recall that, under some weak forms of the Axiom of Choice (AC), 
the standard definition of an infinite set is equivalent to the Bolzano-Dedekind 
definition of a -infinite set (cf. [60, 68, 113, 155]). Also, one can see that the 
Bolzano-Dedekind definition is “more abstract” than the standard definition, because 
the Bolzano-Dedekind definition is formulated only in terms of general sets and their 
self-mappings.
Remark A.2 In 1924 Tarski [166] presented another abstract definition ofa finite set 
(consequently, ofan infinite set). Namely, a set is finite in the sense of Tarski if any 
nonempty family of subsets of has a maximal element with respect to the inclusion 
relation (cf. [60]). This definition emphasizes the fact that the inclusion relation is a 
partial order in the power set P() of , possessing a certain maximality property. 
Obviously, the cardinalities of finite sets in the sense of Tarski can be treated as 
natural numbers.
Remark A.3 Note that before Tarski [166], in 1922, Sierpinski [154] specified an­
other definition of finite sets. Namely, he introduced the notion of an admissible 
class of sets as follows.
A class K of sets is called admissible if:
(a) the empty set belongs to K;
(b) any one-element set belongs to K ;
(c) if X eK and Y e K, then X и Y eK.
A set Z is called finite (in the sense of Sierpinski) if Z belongs to all admissible 
classes of sets.
However, this definition has some disadvantages, because it heavily relies on 
the concept of a class of sets, which is irrelevant for most traditional fields of 
mathematics.
The following theorem is well known and is easy to prove.
Theorem A.4 Let be a set. Then the following two assertions are effectively 
equivalent:
(1) is infinite;
(2) for any mapping f : E ^ E, there exists a nonempty proper subset X of E such 
that f (X) с X.
Clearly, assertion (2) of Theorem A.4 may be treated as one of the abstract 
definitions of an infinite set E in terms of its self-mappings.
In [154] Sierpinski presented an abstract definition of a countably infinite set. 
Namely, he proved the following theorem.

A A Characterization of Uncountable Sets in Terms of their Self-Mappings
195
Theorem A.5 Let be a set. Then the following two assertions are equivalent within 
ZF set theory:
(1) is countably infinite, i.e., is equinumerous with the set N of all natural 
numbers;
(2) there is an injection f : E ^ E such that f (E) + E and there exists no partition 
{X,Y} of E such that f (X) с X and f (Y) c Y.
So, in accordance with Theorem A.5, an infinite set E is uncountable if and only 
if, for every injective self-mapping f : E ^ E such that f (E) + E, a partition 
{X, Y} ofE can be found such that (X) с X and (Y) с Y.
The concept of an uncountable set had become fundamentally important for al­
most all branches of pure mathematics (and for mathematical analysis especially) 
after Cantor’s proof of the uncountability of the continuum (= R). The borderline 
separating the universe of countable sets and the universe of uncountable sets is 
significant in modern mathematical studies and highlights substantial and profound 
differences between these two phenomena within the basic formal ZFC theory. Out­
side formal theories, the above-mentioned difference becomes somehow conditional, 
because of Skolem’s famous paradox, according to which there are many countable 
models of ZFC. Moreover, during a certain period of his research work, Skolem was 
even inclined to suppose that there are no “absolutely uncountable” sets. The role 
of countable transitive models of ZFC was especially recognized after P. Cohen’s 
creation of the forcing method (see, for instance, [68, 108]). With the aid of this 
method and its further modifications, it became possible to demonstrate the logical 
independence of many statements in set theory itself, in general topology, universal 
algebra, functional analysis, and so on.
Remark A.6 Working within ZFC theory, Sierpinski was able to present an abstract 
definition of an uncountable set E in terms of certain partitions of the product set 
E x E. According to his result, a set E with card(E) > 1 is uncountable if and only 
if there exists no partition {A, B} of E x E satisfying the properties:
(a) for any element x e E, the set ({x} x E) n A is finite;
(b) for any element у e E, the set (E x {у}) n B is finite.
In this connection, see also Exercise A.3 (cf. also Exercise 10.1).
It makes sense to give an abstract definition of an uncountable set E in terms of 
general self-mappings of E (not necessarily injective). In this Appendix, we would 
like to discuss one such definition within the same ZFC theory.
As usual, we denote by the least infinite ordinal (cardinal) number.
Let E be a set and let f : E ^ E be a mapping.
A subset X of E is called an -cycle (in E) if
X = {x0, x1 , ..., x},
(x0) = x1, 
(x1) = x2, ..., 
(x-1) = x, 
(x) = x0

for some natural number (here it is assumed that all elements 0, 1,.. ., are 
pairwise distinct). In this case, the natural number + 1 is called the length of the 
above-mentioned -cycle.
An f -cycle X is called isolated (in E) if there exists no у e E \ X such that 
f (У) e X.
Example A.7 Let E be a set and let f : E ^ E be a mapping. Choose an element 
у e E and put Y = {fk(у) : к < ш}. We obviously have the inclusion f (Y) c Y. 
It is also clear that either all elements (у) ( < ) are pairwise distinct or 
contains an -cycle.
Example A.8 Let E be an infinite set, f : E ^ E be a mapping and let X c E be 
an isolated -cycle in E. Then the sets X0 = X and Y0 = E \ X satisfy the relations
f (Xo) c Xo, f (Yo) c Yo, Xo П Yo = 0.
In particular, we have Xo + Xo П Yo and Yo + Xo П Yo.
Example A.9 Let E be an uncountable set and let / : E ^ E be a mapping. Suppose 
that an element e E does not belong to the range of (so is not a surjection). 
Then the two sets
Xo = {() : к < ш}, 
Yo =E\{}
satisfy the relations
f (Xo) c Xo, f (Yo) c Yo, x e Xo, x t Yo.
In particular, we have Xo + Xo П Yo and Yo + Xo П Yo (the latter holds true in view 
of the circumstance that Xo is at most countable while Yo is uncountable).
Let E be a set and let / : E ^ E be a mapping. We shall say that (X, Y) is an 
admissible pair for if
X c E, Y c E, 
(X) c X, (Y) c Y.
We need the following lemma.
Lemma A.10 Let E be an uncountable set and let f : E ^ E be a mapping. 
Then there exists an admissible pair (Xo, Yo) for such that
Xo + Xo П Yo, Yo + Xo П Yo.
In particular, both Xo and Yo are nonempty proper subsets of E.
Proof Examples A.8 and A.9 show that the desired admissible pair (Xo, Yo) exists 
in the following two cases:

A A Characterization of Uncountable Sets in Terms of their Self-Mappings
197
(a) there is an isolated -cycle in ;
(b) is not surjective.
So, we may suppose in our further consideration that our mapping is a surjection 
and does not contain isolated -cycles.
Now, take any у e E and consider the sequence {fk (у) : к < ш}. Only two cases 
are possible.
1. All elements fk (у) (к < ш) are pairwise distinct.
In this case, keeping in mind the fact that is surjective, we can define a sequence 
{уk : к < ш} of elements of E such that
У0 = у, (Vfc<w)( f(у k+1) = у k ).
It is easy to see that {уk : к < ш} is an injective sequence. Since the initial set E is 
uncountable, there exists an element
x e E \ ({fk(у) : к < ш} U {уk : к < ш}).
It can readily be verified that the sets
Хо = {fk (x) : к < ш}, Yo = {fk (у) : к < ш} и {уk : к < ш}
provide us with the required admissible pair (0, 0) for .
2. The sequence {fk (у) : к < ш} is not injective.
In this case {fk (у) : к < ш} contains an f -cycle. This cycle will be denoted by 
. According to our assumption, is not isolated. Therefore, for some e , there 
exists a e E \ such that () = . Again, taking into account the fact that is 
surjective, we may define a sequence {уk : к < ш} of elements of E such that
уо = t, (Ук<ш)( f (у k+1) = у k).
Also, it can easily be checked that {уk : к < ш} is an injective sequence. Since the 
set E is uncountable, there exists an element
x e E \ (Z U {уk : к < ш}).
Now, we put Х0 = {fk(x) : к < ш} and Y0 = Z U {уk : к < ш}. A straightforward 
verification shows that (X0,Y0) is a desired admissible pair for f. This completes 
the proof of Lemma A.10. 
□
Example A.11 Let E = {о, 1, ..., 
, ...} be an infinite countable set. Define a
mapping f : E ^ E as follows:
(о) = о, 
() = -1 ( > о).
It can readily be verified that if Z c E is infinite and f (Z) c Z, then Z = E.

A A Characterization of Uncountable Sets in Terms of their Self-Mappings
Recall that a partially ordered set (E, <) is said to be inductive if every linearly 
ordered subset of is bounded from above in .
The following logical equivalent of the Axiom of Choice (AC) is well known. It 
was stated by Kuratowski and Zorn.
Lemma A.12 In an arbitrary inductive partially ordered set (E, <) there exists at 
least one maximal element.
For a proof of Lemma A.12, see e.g. [17, 37, 113]. Many other logical equivalents 
ofAC may be found in [60] and [113].
Now, we are ready to formulate and prove the main result of this Appendix, 
which yields a characterization of uncountable sets in terms of their self-mappings 
and proper “large” invariant subsets.
Theorem A.13 The following two conditions are equivalent for a set E:
(1) E is uncountable;
(2) for any mapping f : E ^ E, there exists a proper subset Z of E such that 
card(Z) = card(E) and f (Z) c Z.
Proof The implication (2) ^ (1) holds true by virtue of Example A.11. So, it remains 
to establish the validity of the implication (1) ^ (2).
Let E be an uncountable set and let f : E ^ E be a mapping. According to 
Lemma A.10, for this there exists at least one admissible pair (0, 0) such that
Xo + X, П Yo, Yo + X, П Yo.
Let us introduce a partially ordered set (P, <) as follows. The elements of P are all 
those admissible pairs (X, Y) for which satisfy the conditions
Xo c X, Yo c Y, X П Y = Xo П Yo.
Further, we write (X, Y) < (X', Y') if and only if X c X' and Y c Y'.
It is not difficult to verify that the partially ordered set (P, <) is inductive. So, by 
the Kuratowski-Zorn lemma (i.e., by Lemma A.12), there exists a maximal element 
(X*, Y*) in (P, <). Notice that, in view of the relations
X*n Y* = Xo П Yo, Xo + Xo П Yo, Yo + Xo П Yo,
we have X* + E and Y* + E; in other words, both X* and Y* are proper subsets of 
E . Let us show that
card(X*) = card(E) v card(Y*) = card(E).
Suppose otherwise, i.e., card(X*) < card(E) and card(Y *) < card(E). Then 
there exists an element z e E \ (X* и Y*). Further, let us introduce the set Z = 
{ ( ) : < } and consider the four possible cases.

A A Characterization of Uncountable Sets in Terms of their Self-Mappings
199
1. 
Z П (X* U Y*) = 0.
In this case both pairs (X* U Z, Y*) and (X*, Y* U Z) belong to P and
(X*, Y*) A (X* U Z, Y*), (X*, Y*) A (X*, Y* U Z),
which contradicts the maximality of (X*, Y*).
2. The least natural number k satisfying the relation fк(z) с X* U Y* is such that 
fк(z) с X* \ Y*.
In this case the pair (X* U Z, Y*) belongs to P and
(X*,Y*) A (X* U Z,Y*),
which contradicts the maximality of (X*, Y*).
3. The least natural number k satisfying the relation fк(z) с X* U Y* is such that 
fк(z) c Y*\ X*.
In this case the pair (X*, Y* U Z) belongs to P and
(X*,Y*) A (X*, Y* U Z),
which contradicts the maximality of (X*, Y*).
4. The least natural number k satisfying the relation fк (z) с X* U Y* is such that
fк (z) с X* П Y* = Xo П Yo.
In this case both pairs (X* U Z, Y*) and (X*, Y* U Z) belong to P and
(X*, Y*) A (X* U Z, Y*), (X*, Y*) A (X*, Y* U Z),
which again contradicts the maximality of (X*, Y*).
So, in all of the above-mentioned cases we come to a contradiction. The obtained 
contradiction allows us to conclude that one of the sets X* and Y* is equinumerous 
with E, and the proof of the formulated theorem has thus been completed. □
Remark A.14 Obviously, Theorem A.13 may be treated as a certain analog of The­
orem A.4.
Remark A.15 If we have some abstract definition of an infinite set, then we may use 
it to introduce the corresponding abstract definition of an uncountable set. Namely, 
it can easily be seen that the following two assertions are equivalent for a set E :
(a) 
E is uncountable;
(b) for any mapping f : E ^ E, there exists a nonempty set X c E such that 
f (X) c X and E \ X is infinite.
The advantage of Theorem A.13 is seen from its formulation, which is free of the 
notions of finite and infinite sets.

A A Characterization of Uncountable Sets in Terms of their Self-Mappings
Remark A.16 One more characterization of uncountable sets can be given in terms 
of self-mappings and “small” invariant sets with respect to those mappings. Namely, 
it is not difficult to verify that the following two assertions are equivalent for a set :
(a) 
is uncountable;
(b) 
for any mapping f : E ^ E, there exists a nonempty set X с E such that 
card(X) < card(E) and f (X) с X.
Combining Theorems A.4 and A.13, we also get the following.
Theorem A.17 If a set E contains at least two elements, then these two assertions 
are equivalent:
(1) E is infinite;
(2) for any cardinal number a < card( E) and for an arbitrary mapping f : E ^ E, 
there exists a proper subset X of E such that the relations card(X) > a and
(X) с X hold true.
Proof First, let us prove the implication (1) ^ (2).
Suppose that (1) holds. If E is uncountable, then (2) directly follows from The­
orem A.13. So, we may assume that E is countably infinite. In this case, we must 
demonstrate that, for any natural number n and for an arbitrary mapping f : E ^ E, 
there exists a proper subset X of E such that card(X) > and (X) с X. If there 
is an infinite proper subset of E such that ( ) с , then we are done. It remains 
to consider the situation where all proper subsets X of E satisfying the inclusion 
(X) с X are finite. In this situation, we argue by induction on n. Let a proper 
subset X of E be such that card(X) > n and (X) с X. Since X is finite, we may 
choose an element x e E \ X. It is easy to see that the set
Z = X U {fk (x) : к < ш}
is such that n + 1 < card(Z) < ш and f (Z) с Z. Thus, we have shown by induction 
that (2) holds true.
Now, let us verify the converse implication (2) ^ (1). Suppose (2) and suppose 
to the contrary that E is finite, i.e.,
E = {0, 1,..., k}
for some natural number к > 1. In this case, define a mapping f : E ^ E by the 
formulas:
(0) = 1, (1) = 2,..., (k-1) = (k), (k) = 0.
Obviously, no nonempty proper subset of E satisfies the inclusion relation ( ) с 
. Consequently, for к, there exists no proper subset X of E such that card(X) > к 
and ( X) с X . We thus see that (2) is not fulfilled for the cardinal number a = к < 
к + 1 = card(E) and for the just described mapping .
The obtained contradiction finishes the proof.

Appendix B
Some Applications of Peano Type Functions
Our starting point here is the classical Cantor set (Cantor’s discontinuum), i.e., the 
topological product space
с = {0,1}" = 2' ,
where the two-element set {0, 1} = 2 is endowed with the discrete topology.
Clearly, с is a compact metrizable space without isolated points. Moreover, с 
has a countable base consisting of closed-open (clopen) subsets of с.
Needless to say, Cantor’s discontinuum has numerous applications in various 
branches of mathematics, especially in general topology and mathematical analysis 
(see, for instance, [37, 75, 111]).
It immediately follows from the definition of с that, for any nonempty clopen set 
X с С and for any real £ > 0, there exists a finite partition of X consisting of clopen 
subsets of X, each of which has diameter strictly less than £.
Actually, every zero-dimensional compact metric space possesses the analogous 
property.
At the same time, if is an arbitrary compact metric space, then for any closed 
set X с E and for any real £ > 0, there exists a finite covering of X consisting of 
closed subsets of X, each of which has diameter strictly less than £.
These simple observations are realized in the following important theorem due 
to P. Alexandrov (see, e.g., [37]). Note that the proof of Alexandrov’s theorem can 
be carried out within ZF & DC theory (cf. [99]).
Theorem B.1 Let E be an arbitrary nonempty compact metric space.
Then there exists a continuous surjection acting from the Cantor space с onto E.
Proof Keeping in mind the preceding remarks, recursively define two sequences
{(Xn,k)i<k<m(n) : п<ш}, {(Yn,k)i<k<m(n) : п<ш},
satisfying the following three conditions:
(1) for any n < ш, the finite family (X„,k)1 <k<m(„) is a partition of С consisting of 
clopen subsets of с each of which has diameter strictly less than i/( + i);

B Some Applications of Peano Type Functions
(2) for any n < ш, the finite family (Yn,k)1 <k<m(n) is a covering of E by nonempty 
closed sets each of which has diameter strictly less than 1/( + 1);
(3) for any n < ш and for any к e [1,m(n)], there exists a subset I(n,k) of 
[1, m(n + 1)] such that
Xn,k = u{Xn+i,t : i e I(n, к)}, Yn,k = u{Yn+M : i e I(n, к)}.
Let now be an arbitrary point of . Then uniquely determines the two sequences 
{к (n) : n < ш} and {Xn,k(n) : n < ш} such that
(Vn < ш)(1 < к(n) < m(n) &x e Xn k(n)).
Consider the corresponding sequence of sets {Yn,k (n) : n < ш}. Obviously, we have 
(Vn < v)(Yn+1,k(n+1) c Yn,k(n)), П ..JwmY,,(n)) = 0.
Hence there exists one and only one point belonging to all the sets Yn,k (n) (n < ш). 
Let us put у = f (x). Consequently, we obtain the mapping f : C ^ E .By starting 
with the definition of , it is not hard to verify that is continuous and surjective.
Theorem B.1 has thus been proved. 
□
The above theorem immediately implies the existence of Peano type functions. 
Namely, we have the following theorem due to Peano [138].
Theorem B.2 There exists a Peano type function, i.e., there exists a continuous 
surjection acting from [0, 1] onto [0, 1]2.
Proof It directly follows from Theorem B.1 that there is a continuous surjection 
g : C ^ [0,1]2. Consider any open interval U that was removed from [0,1] in the 
process of Cantor’s classical construction of C (see, e.g., [37, 51, 99]). We may add 
U to the domain of g and extend g in such a way that the extended function is affine 
on U and coincides with g on the end-points of U. Carrying out this procedure for all 
removed intervals simultaneously, we come to the function g* defined on the entire 
segment [0,1]. The construction of g* implies that g* is continuous. In addition, 
since g* is an extension of g, we immediately conclude that g* is a surjection as well.
This completes the proof of Theorem B.2. 
□
Remark B.3 An analogous argument shows that there exists a continuous surjection 
from [0,1] onto the Hilbert cube [0,1]". Consequently, for every natural number 
n, there is a continuous surjection from [0, 1] onto the unit cube [0, 1]n. Also, the 
existence of a Peano type function from [0, 1] onto [0, 1]2 immediately implies the 
existence of a continuous surjection h : R ^ R2. Such a function h can be regarded 
as a Peano type function acting from R onto R2 . Several results presented in this 
Appendix are also closely connected with the existence of Peano type functions.
Remark B.4 As shown by Theorem B.1, any nonempty compact metric space is a 
continuous image of C or, equivalently, of 2" .A natural question arises concerning 
the description of all those Hausdorff topological spaces which are continuous images 

B Some Applications of Peano Type Functions
207
of . It turns out that only nonempty compact metrizable spaces are such images. 
Actually, the class of all Hausdorff continuous images of {0,1} " coincides with the 
class of all nonempty compact metric spaces (in this connection, see Exercises B.2 
and B.3).
In Chapter 6 we used the following profound fact from classical descriptive set 
theory:
There exists an analytic subset A of the plane R2 such that, for any analytic set 
A' c R, there is a point x e R satisfying the relation
A' = {у e R : (x, y) e A}.
In other words, the analytic set A c R2 turns out to be universal for the family of all 
analytic sets in R.
We would like to give a proof of the above important fact.
First of all, we recall the notion of the Hausdorff metric. Let (E,p) be an arbitrary 
metric space. Denote by the symbol F () the family of all nonempty closed bounded 
subsets ofE. For any two sets e F (E) and e F (E), we define
d(X,Y) = inf{e > 0 : X c V£(Y) & Y c V£(X)},
where Ve (X) (respectively, Ve (Y)) denotes the e-neighborhood of X (respectively, 
of Y). It is easy to see that d is a metric on F (E), so we get the metric space 
(F (E), d).
The metric d is usually called the Hausdorff metric associated with p. If the 
original metric space (E, p) has good properties, then, sometimes, those properties 
can be transferred to the space (F (E), d). For instance, the following assertions 
hold:
(*) if (E,p) is complete, then (F(E), d) is complete, too;
(** ) if (E,p) is compact, then (F(E), d) is compact, too.
Assertions (*) and (**) can be established without any difficulties. On the other 
hand, let us remark that if the original space (E,p) is separable, then, in general, 
(F(E), d) need not be separable. Moreover, it can easily be observed that if (E, p) 
is bounded but not totally bounded, then (F (E), d) is necessarily nonseparable.
The Hausdorff metric can be successfully applied in establishing the classical re­
sult of Suslin which states the existence of analytic non-Borel subsets of uncountable 
Polish spaces (see, for instance, [74, 111, 119, 130]).
For the sake of completeness, we shall give a short proof of this result, especially 
taking into account the fact that the proof is essentially based on Theorem B.1, which 
is a crucial tool for constructing various Peano type functions.
Theorem B.5 Let E be an arbitrary uncountable Polish topological space (or, more 
generally, an uncountable Borel subset of a Polish space).
Then there exists an analytic subset of E which is not Borel.

208
B Some Applications of Peano Type Functions
Proof Because all uncountable Borel subsets of Polish spaces are Borel isomorphic 
(see, e.g., [111]), it suffices to show that in the standard Cantor space
с = 2‘ = {0,1}"
there exists an analytic subset which is not Borel. In order to do this, let us take the 
product space W = 2" x [0,1] and observe that it is compact. Denote by F(W) 
the family of all nonempty closed subsets of and equip F( ) with the Hausdorff 
metric (or, equivalently, with the Vietoris topology, which is metrizable by this 
metric). It is easy to verify that, in such a way, F(W) becomes a compact metric 
space (see assertion (**) formulated above). According to Theorem B.1, there exists 
a surjective continuous mapping h : 2ы ^ F(W). Further, let Z denote the set of 
all irrational points of the segment [0, 1]. We recall that is homeomorphic to the 
canonical Baire space шш, where ш is equipped with the discrete topology. Now, we 
define a set-valued mapping Ф : 2" ^P(2"') by the following formula:
Ф(0 = pr1 ((2" x Z)n h(?)) 
(t e 2' ).
It is clear that (2" x Z) n h(t) ranges over the family of all closed subsets of the 
space 2" x Z as t ranges over 2". By starting with this fact, it is not difficult to infer 
that гап(Ф) = A(2"), where A(2") denotes the family of all analytic subsets of 
2". Let us put
X = {t e 2' : t t Ф(t)}.
We are going to establish that X is not analytic in 2". Suppose, for now, that X 
is analytic. Then, for some to e 2", we must have the equality X = Ф(t0). But, 
according to the definition of X , we get
t0 e X « t0 t X,
which obviously yields a contradiction. Consequently, X is not an analytic subset of 
the Cantor space. On the other hand, let us verify that
2‘ \ X = {t e 2' : t e Ф(/)}
is an analytic subset of C. Indeed, 2" \ X = pr1 (D) where the set D is defined by 
the formula
D = {(t, y) e W : (t,y) e h(t) & (t,y) e 2" x Z}.
Since h is continuous, the set D' = {(t, y) e W : (t, y) e h(t)} is closed in W and, 
therefore, is a -subset of W. Also, the set
D ” = {(t, y) e W : (t, y) e 2" x Z}
is a G s -subset of W. Hence the intersection D ’ n D " = D is a G s -subset of W, too, 
and pr1 (D) is an analytic set in the Cantor space 2". Finally, we easily infer that 

B Some Applications of Peano Type Functions
209
pr1 (D) is not Borel, because, as has been shown above, the set X = 2" \ pr1 (D) is 
not analytic.
This finishes the proof of Theorem B.5. 
□
Remark B.6 In connection with Theorem B.5, we point out that, in classical math­
ematical analysis, there are many interesting concrete sets of functions which are 
analytic, but non-Borel (in an appropriate Polish space). For instance, it was estab­
lished by R. D. Mauldin that the set of all real-valued continuous functions defined on 
the unit segment [0, 1] and differentiable at least at one point of [0, 1] is an analytic 
non-Borel subset of the separable Banach space [0, 1]. Other examples of proper 
analytic sets in various uncountable Polish spaces can be found in [74, 111, 130].
Theorem B.7 There exists a universal analytic subset of the Euclidean plane R2 .
Proof We preserve the notation of the proof of Theorem B.5. In particular, recall 
that the concrete mapping
Ф : 2" ^ P(2")
is such that гап(Ф) = A(2"). Now, it is not hard to see that the set
U = {(t,T) e 2' x 2' : т e Ф(/)}
is analytic in the product space 2" x 2" and is universal in this space.
Finally, let f :2W ^ R be some Borel isomorphism and let
/ * : 2" x 2" ^ R x R
denote the mapping defined by
f*(t,T) = (f (t),f (t)) 
((t,T)e 2" x 2 ).
One can easily verify that * is also a Borel isomorphism and the image *(U) is a 
universal analytic subset of the plane R2 .
Theorem B.7 has thus been proved. 
□
To give one more application of Peano type mappings, it will be convenient to 
consider the extended real line
[-to, +to| = {-^} U R U {+to}
which is assumed to be equipped with the standard linear ordering and topology.
So [-от, +от| becomes isomorphic (as a linearly ordered set) to the closed interval 
[-1, 1|.
Let us recall the definition of the Baire class Ba^ ([0,1], R) of functions, where 
is an ordinal strictly less than 1 (see, e.g., [111]).
If £ = 0, then Ba^ ([0,1], R) is the family of all continuous functions from [0,1] 
into R.

210
B Some Applications of Peano Type Functions
Assuming that the Baire classes Ba ([0, 1], R) have already been defined for all 
ordinals £ < %, one puts f e Ba^ ([0,1], R) if and only if there exists a sequence
{fn : n e N}cu{Ba^ ([0,1], R) : <<%}
pointwise converging to f on [0,1], i.e., limn.. fn = f. The union of the Baire 
classes Ba^([0,1],R), % < w1, is the class of all Baire functions [0,1] . R, 
denoted Ba( [0, 1], R). In fact, Ba( [0, 1], R) coincides with the family of all Borel 
functions acting from [0, 1] into R.
The next important theorem was obtained by H. Lebesgue (see [117]).
Theorem B.8 For every ordinal number < 1 , there exists a mapping
Ф^ : [0,1] x [0,1] . [-“, +.]
satisfying the following two conditions:
(i) Ф^ is Borel;
(ii) for each function f e Ba^ ([0,1], R), there is a point t from [0,1] such that 
ф <■ G,t) = f.
Proof In order to prove this basic theorem, consider a Peano type mapping
Ф = (Фк)к<ш : [0,1] . [0,1]".
Recall that this simply means that ф is a continuous surjection (cf. Remark B.3).
Let {к : 
< } denote the sequence of all polynomials on [0, 1] with rational
coefficients. We put
Ф0(x,t) = limsupk..Gк(x)фк(t) (x e [0,1], t e [0,1]).
Then we proceed by the method of transfinite recursion up to 1.
If % < wi and the mapping Ф^ is already defined, then we put
Ф^+1 (x,t) = limsupk. ....Ф^(х,фк(t)) 
(x e [0,1],t e [0,1]).
Further, if < 1 is a limit ordinal, then we can take a strictly increasing sequence 
{%k : к < w} of ordinals such that limk..%k = %, and put
Ф^(x,t) = limsiipk ..Ф&(x,^k(t)) 
(x e [0,1], t e [0,1]).
This procedure allows us to define the required mapping Ф ^ for any ordinal 
number % < w1 .
Let now : [0, 1] . R be an arbitrary continuous function. According to 
the classical theorem of Weierstrass (see, e.g., [33, 37, 75]), there exists a strictly 
increasing family {к (n) : n < w} of natural numbers such that
(x) = lim..Gk() (x) 
(x e [0, 1]).

B Some Applications of Peano Type Functions
211
We can take a point to e [0,1] so that:
, xfo if к < w does not belong to {к (n) : n < w}; 
Фк(to) - 11 if к < w belongs to {к(n) : n < w}.
Then it is clear that Ф0 (x, t0) - f (x) for all x e [0,1].
Let f < w1 and let the Borel function Ф^ satisfy condition (ii) of the theorem.
Take any function f e Ba^+1 ([0,1], R). By definition of f, we have
f (x) - lino ...-fk(x) 
(x e [0,1]),
where all functions fk belong to the Baire class Ba^ ([0,1], R). For each natural 
number к, there exists a point tk e [0,1] such that
Ф^(x,tk) - fk(x) 
(x e [0,1]).
Also, there is a point t e [0,1] such that фк (t) - tk whenever к < w. Therefore, for 
any x from [0,1], we get
Ф^+1 (x,t) - limsupk--ТОФ^ (x, фк(t)) - limk-«fk(x) - f (x).
Finally, let f < w1 be a nonzero limit ordinal. By definition, we have
Ф^(x,t) - limsupk--ТОФ&(x,fk(t)) (x e [0,1],t e [0,1]),
where {fk : к < w} is some fixed strictly increasing sequence of ordinals satisfying 
f - sup{fk : к < w}. Take any function f e Ba^([0,1], R). Clearly, there exists a 
sequence {fk : к < w} of functions such that
/к e Ba€k ([0,1], R) 
(к < w)
and f (x) - limk-TC fk (x) for each x e [0,1] .According to the inductive assumption, 
for any function fk, there is a tk e [0,1] such that
ф€k(x,tk) - fk(x) 
(x e [0,1]).
Choose t e [0,1] so that fk (t) - tk for all к < w. Then we may write
Ф^ (x,t) - limsupk.-«Ф& (x,tk) - limk-« fk (x) - f (x)
for each point x e [0,1].
Theorem B.8 has thus been proved. 
□
By starting with the existence of Ф^ for each f < w1, it becomes possible to 
deduce that
Ba^ ([0,1], R) \ u{Ba^ ([0,1], R) : < < f} + 0
and the analogous relation holds true for an uncountable Polish space E instead of 
[0,1]. This remarkable result is also due to Lebesgue [117].

212
B Some Applications of Peano Type Functions
Theorem B.9 For every at most countable ordinal number < 1, there are func­
tions belonging to the Baire class Ba^ ([0,1], R) and not belonging to 
u{Ba^([0,1],R) : <<£}.
Proof We argue in the following manner. Suppose on the contrary that
Ba ^ ([0,1], R) \ U{Ba^ ([0,1], R) : < < £} = 0.
It immediately follows from this assumption that
Ba([0,1], R) = Ba ^ ([0,1], R).
Then, using the mapping Ф^, we easily get a Borel mapping
Ф : [0,1] x [0,1] ^ [0,1]
such that, for any Borel function f : [0,1] ^ [0,1], there exists a point t e [0,1] 
satisfying Ф(-,0 = f.
Further, we define a Borel mapping T by the formula
T(x,t) = lim„^w ИФ(*/\ 
(x e [0,1],t e [0,1]).
1 + пФ(х, t)
It is not hard to check that:
(a) ran(T) = {0, 1};
(b) for any Borel function g : [0,1] ^ {0,1}, there exists a point t e [0,1] such 
that T(•, t) = g.
Finally, we put
h(x) = 1 - T(x,x) 
(x e [0,1]).
A straightforward verification gives us that:
(c) the function h is Borel;
(d) ran(h) c {0,1}.
Now, keeping in mind (b), pick a point t e [0,1] for which h = T(-, t). Then the 
equalities
h(t) = 1-T(t,t) = T(t, t), T(t, t) = 1/2
follow, which contradict (a).
Thus, the obtained contradiction yields the existence of Baire functions of any 
order < 1 and, consequently, the existence of Borel sets in [0, 1] of the same 
order .
Theorem B.9 has thus been proved. 
□
Remark B.10 Since every uncountable Polish topological space is Borel isomor­
phic to the unit segment [0, 1], one can easily deduce from Theorem B.9 that, for 
any ordinal < 1 , the relation

Ba^ (E, R) \ U{Ba^ (E, R) : < < £} + 0
holds true.
Remark B.11 One of the important features of a Peano type function is that the 
inequality
dim(dom( )) < dim(ran( ))
usually holds. More precisely, if X and Y are topological spaces and f : X ^ Y is a 
Peano type function, then one may have the inequality dim( ) < dim( ) . Actually, 
in the proof of Theorem B.8 we used the existence ofa Peano type function from the 
one-dimensional segment [0,1] onto the infinite-dimensional Hilbert cube [0,1]". 
In general, a Peano type function is not an open mapping, i.e., the -image of 
an open set in X is not necessarily an open set in Y. In this connection, one may 
conjecture that, for a surjective open continuous mapping g : X ^ Y, the dimension 
of X is always greater than or equal to the dimension of Y. However, this is not the 
case. According to one of the results of L. Keldysh, for every natural number , the 
standard unit cube [0,1]3 can be mapped onto the unit cube [0,1]n (n e N) by using 
an appropriate open continuous function.
Lemma B.12 For any metric space (X, ), there exists a Banach space E such that
(1) X can be isometrically embedded in E;
(2) the weight of E is equal to the weight of X (in particular, if X is separable, then 
E is separable, too).
Proof We may assume, without loss of generality, that X + 0. Let us fix a point 
t e X. Further, for an arbitrary point x e X, introduce a function f x : X ^ R by the 
formula
fx(y) = d(x,y)— d(t,y) 
(y e X).
Obviously, f x is continuous, and the relation
|fx(y)| < |d(x,y) - d(t,y)| < d(x,t)
directly indicates that f x is bounded. Now, let the symbol Сь (X) denote the Banach 
space (with respect to the standard sup-norm) of all real-valued bounded continuous 
functions defined on X. We also introduce a mapping ф : X ^ Сь (X) by the 
formula ф(x) = fx for all x e X. Let us check that this ф is an isometric embedding 
of X into Сь (X). Indeed, for any two elements x e X and x' e X, we may write
|| fx - fJ| = SUpy ex I fx (y) - fxf y)| = SUpy ex I d (x, y) - d (x ',y)|.
It can easily be seen that supy eX|d(x, y) - d(x', y)| = d(x,x'). Consequently, we get 
||ф(x) - ф(x')|| = ||fx - /x/|| = d(x,x'),
which shows that ф is an isometric embedding. Finally, define E as the closed vector 
subspace of Сь(X) generated by the set ф(X). Then E is obviously a Banach space

214
B Some Applications of Peano Type Functions
whose weight is equal to the weight of ф (X) or, equivalently, to the weight of X. 
We thus conclude that is the required Banach space, which completes the proof of 
Lemma B.12. 
□
Before formulating the next lemma, we need some auxiliary notions from the 
theory of topological vector spaces (below, we restrict ourselves to the class of 
topological vector spaces over the field R).
Let E and E ' be any two vector spaces over R. We say that these spaces are in a 
duality if a bilinear function ¥ : E x E ' ^ R is given such that
(a) for each x + 0 from E, the partial linear functional
у ^ ¥ (x,y) 
(у e E')
is not identically equal to zero;
(b) for each у + 0 from E', the partial linear functional
x ^ ¥(x, у) 
(x e E)
is not identically equal to zero.
In such a situation, it is usually said that ¥ establishes a duality between the given 
spaces E and E '.
In particular, let E be an arbitrary Banach space (or, more generally, normed 
vector space). Denote by E* the vector space of all continuous linear functionals on 
E. Evidently, a bilinear function Ф : E * x E ^ R defined by the formula
Ф(и,х) = и(x) 
(и e E*, x e E)
establishes a canonical duality between E* and E .
Let X be a subset of E .We equip E * with the weakest topology a (E *, X) for which 
all linear functionals from the family (Ф(-, x))^ex become continuous. Clearly, the 
pair (E*, a(E*, X)) is a topological vector space.
Lemma B.13 LetE be a separable normed vector space and let denote the closed 
unit ball in E*, i.e.,
В = {f e E* : Ц/Ц < 1}.
Then is a compact metric space with respect to the topology induced by 
a (E *,E).
Proof It is not difficult to check that the topology a(E*, E) restricted to В coincides 
with the topology a(E*, {xn : n e w}) restricted to В, where {xn : n e w} is any 
countable everywhere dense subset of E. Let us define a mapping h : В ^ R" by 
the formula h(u) = (u (xn))neы for all и from В. Actually, h maps В into the product 
space
П [-llx»ll, l|x„||], 
n e ^
which obviously is compact and metrizable.

B Some Applications of Peano Type Functions
215
Starting with the definition of a(E*, {xn : n e w}) and keeping in mind that 
h is an injective, continuous and closed mapping, it is not hard to show that В is 
homeomorphic to some closed subset of the above-mentioned product space and, 
consequently, В is compact and metrizable as well. Lemma B.13 has thus been 
proved. 
□
We are now ready to prove the following remarkable result of Banach and Mazur.
Theorem B.14 The space C [0,1] is universal for the class Ms of all separable 
metric spaces.
Proof Let be an arbitrary separable metric space. According to Lemma B.12, 
there exists a separable Banach space E containing an isometric copy of . Hence 
it suffices to show that E can be isometrically embedded in C[0, 1]. Let us denote 
by В the closed unit ball in E*. Because E is separable, the ball В equipped with 
the topology induced by a(E*,E) is compact and metrizable (see Lemma B.13). 
According to Theorem B.1, there exists a continuous surjection from the Cantor 
space C c [0,1] onto В. It is easy to see that g can be extended to a continuous 
mapping acting from [0, 1] onto В (cf. the proof of Theorem B.2). For the sake of 
simplicity, the extended mapping will be denoted by the same symbol g . Now, take 
any element x from E and define a function fx : [0,1] ^ R by the formula
fx(t) = g(t)(x) 
(t e [0,1]).
Because g is continuous, fx is continuous, too. Moreover, g(t) e В for each t e [0,1], 
and we get |fx(t)| < ||x|| whenever t e [0,1], i.e., fx is also bounded. If у is 
another element from E, then, for each t e [0,1], we may write | fx (t) - fy (t)| = 
|g(t)(x - у)| < ||x - у||. On the other hand, a simple consequence of the Hahn- 
Banach theorem says that if x + у, then there is a continuous linear functional 
и : E ^ R satisfying the following two relations:
|||| = 1, 
(x - у) = ||x - у||.
In particular, и e В and, since g is a surjection from [0, 1] onto В, there exists a 
point t0 e [0, 1] such that и = g(t0). Then we have
| fx(t0) — fy (t0)| = (x - у)| = ||x - у||,
which shows that || f x - /y || = ||x - у || and, consequently, the mapping x ^ f x 
(x e E) is an isometric embedding of E into C[0, 1]. This completes the proof of 
Theorem B.14. 
□
Remark B.15 Evidently, analogous questions about the existence of universal ob­
jects can be posed for various mathematical structures: for algebraic structures 
(e.g., groups), for certain types of binary relations, for topological spaces, and so 
on. There are some important results in this direction. For instance, let us recall the 
well-known theorem of Cantor stating that the set Q equipped with its standard order 
is universal in the class of all countable linearly ordered sets, i.e., every countable 

216
B Some Applications of Peano Type Functions
linearly ordered set can be isomorphically embedded into Q. The following fact 
partially describes the situation for linearly ordered sets whose cardinalities are less 
than or equal to c:
Assuming that the Continuum Hypothesis holds, there exists a linearly ordered 
set (X, <) with card(X) = c such that, for any linearly ordered set (Y, <) with 
card(Y) < c, there is a monomorphism from Y into X.
A proof of this fact may be found, for example, in [113, 155], where related results 
for other uncountable cardinals are also discussed.
Exercises
B.1 Prove that:
(a) if E is an arbitrary compact metric space, then for any closed set X с E and for 
any real £ > 0, there exists a finite covering of X consisting of closed subsets of 
X, each of which has diameter strictly less than s;
(b) if E is an arbitrary zero-dimensional compact metric space, then for any real 
£ > 0, there exists a finite partition of E consisting of closed-open subsets of E, 
each of which has diameter strictly less than £.

* Let (E, T) be a topological space.
A family N of subsets of E is called a net (in the sense of Archangelskii) if every 
open subset of E is representable as the union of some subfamily of N .
Check that:
(a) any base of E is simultaneously a net of E, but the converse assertion is not true 
in general;
(b) if E 'с E and N is a net in E, then the family {X П E ’ : X e N} is a net in the 
subspace E ' of E;
(c) if {E[ : i e I} is a family of subspaces of E such that
E = U{Ef : i e I}
and N is a net in Ef for each index i e I, then U{N : i e I} is a net in E (in 
particular, the family of all singletons in E is a net in E);
(d) if F is a topological space, g : E ^ F is a continuous surjection, and N is a net 
in E , then
g(N) = {g(X) : X eN}
is a net in the space F.
Prove Archangelskii’s theorem stating that if a compact topological space (E, T) has 
a net of infinite cardinality a, then E has a base whose cardinality does not exceed 
the same cardinality a.

Deduce from this result that if E1 and E2 are two compact spaces and g : E1 ^ E2 
is a continuous surjection, then the topological weight of 2 = (1) is less than or 
equal to the topological weight of E1 .
In particular, if E1 has a countable base, then E2 has a countable base, too.
To prove Arhangelskii’s above-mentioned theorem, argue as follows.
Let N be a net of the compact space (E,T) with card(N) = a.
A pair {X, Y} c N is called admissible if there exist two open sets U and V in E 
such that
X c U, Y c V, U П V = 0.
For any admissible pair {X, Y}, choose two open sets u(x) and v(y) satisfying
X c u(x), Y c v(y), 
u(x) П v(y) = 0,
and denote by K the family consisting of all u(x) and v(y). In addition, denote by 
B the family of all sets of the form
Wi П W2 П • • • П wn,
where n e N and {W1, W2,..., Wn} c K. Verify that card(B) < a and that B is a 
base of some Hausdorff topology T* on E.
Finally, taking into account that T* c T, check that the identity mapping from 
(E, T) onto (E, T*) is a homeomorphism, which yields the required result.
Remark B.16 For a topological space E, denote by nw (E) the least cardinality of 
a net of E . Since the family of all singletons in E forms a net of E , we have the 
inequality nw(E) < card(E). Also, since any base of E is simultaneously a net of 
E, we may write nw(E) < w(E). It is not difficult to give examples of E for which 
nw(E) < w(E). By virtue of Archangelskii’s theorem, the equality nw(E) = w(E) 
holds true for every compact space E .
B.3 
* Show that the class of all Hausdorff continuous images of the Cantor space

For this purpose, use the result of Exercise B.2 and Urysohn’s metrization theorem

e.g., [37, 75, 111]).

Appendix C
Almost Rigid Mathematical Structures
We briefly discuss the concept of an almost rigid mathematical structure in both 
the regular sense and in the strong sense. We compare these two notions with the 
usual notion of a rigid mathematical structure. We also consider an application of the 
introduced concepts to the theory of linearly ordered sets. It will be seen in the sequel 
that these concepts are closely connected with certain ideas of classical descriptive 
set theory, the appearance and further development of which were initiated by some 
principal and qualitative problems of real analysis.
Let X be a type of a mathematical structure in the sense of Bourbaki (see [17]). 
For example, X may be the type of a topological structure, or the type of a structure 
of a measurable space, or the type of a partial order structure, etc.
Suppose that the type X satisfies the following two conditions:
(1) for the class of all structures of this type, a class of morphisms (homomorphisms) 
is defined in such a way that one has a category in the usual algebraic sense;
(2) if E is a base (ground) set, 5 is a structure of type X defined on E, and X is an 
arbitrary subset of E, then there exists a structure Sx of the same type X such 
that Sx is defined on X and is induced by the original structure 5.
Condition (2) can be treated as the hereditary property of the given structure type X. 
Actually, (2) means that Sx is an initial structure on X for the canonical embedding 
jx : X ^ E, where jx(x) = x whenever x e X. Note that topologies, measurable 
spaces, and relation structures satisfy condition (2). Of course, there are also many 
other structures for which this condition is trivially fulfilled.
Let 5 be a structure of type X on a ground set E.
Recall that the structure 5 is rigid if the group of all automorphisms of 5 is a 
one-element set. In other words, the structure 5 is rigid if and only if the identity 
transformation Id£ of E is the unique automorphism of 5.
More generally, we say that a structure 5 on E is almost rigid if, for every 
automorphism f : (E, 5) ^ (E, 5) of this structure onto itself, the inequality 
card({x e E : f (x) + x}) < card(E) holds true.

C Almost Rigid Mathematical Structures
Further, we say that a structure 5 on E is almost rigid in the strong sense if, for 
every monomorphism g : (E, 5) ^ (E, 5) of this structure into itself, the inequality 
card({x e E : g(x) + x}) < card(E) holds true.
Remark C.1 If a base set E is finite, then the notion of an almost rigid structure on 
E may coincide with the notion of an almost rigid structure in the strong sense on 
E. For instance, suppose that X is the type of an algebraic structure and let 5 be a 
structure of type X defined on a finite base set E. Then it can easily be checked that 
5 is almost rigid if and only if 5 is almost rigid in the strong sense.
Of course, any rigid structure is almost rigid, but the converse assertion is not true. 
It is also clear that any almost rigid structure in the strong sense is almost rigid, too. 
The following simple example shows us that there exists a countable graph structure 
which is almost rigid in the strong sense but is not rigid.
Example C.2 Let x and be any two distinct elements not belonging to the set 
{1,2,..., n,...}. Put E = {x, y} U {1,2,..., n,...} and define the graph structure 5 on 
E by the following edges:
{1,x},{1,y},{1,2},{2,3},...,{n,n+ 1}, ....
Then it is not difficult to check that 5 is not a rigid structure. At the same time, 5 is 
almost rigid in the strong sense. Moreover, in this situation every monomorphism of 
the structure 5 into itself moves at most two elements of the base (ground) set E.
Let us observe, in connection with Example C.2, that an arbitrary infinite well- 
ordered set (E, <) without the greatest element gives us a simple example of a rigid 
structure which is not almost rigid in the strong sense.
Now, let E be an infinite base set and let 5 be a structure on E of type X. The 
following two questions naturally arise.
Question C.3 Does there exist a set X c E with card( X) = card( E) such that the 
structure Sx induced on X is rigid?
Question C.4 Does there exist a set X c E with card(X) = card(E) such that the 
structure Sx induced on X is almost rigid (or is almost rigid in the strong sense)?
Question C.3 has been thoroughly investigated by several authors for the topo­
logical structure and Question C.4 has been extensively studied for the measurable 
space structure (see, for example, the article of Shortt [152] and references given 
therein).
In connection with the first question, let us also remark that in the most interesting 
and important cases the answer to this question is negative. In particular, one such 
unpleasant situation is described in the next simple example.
Example C.5 Let us consider the type X ofa structure ofa measurable space with an 
additional axiom which says that all one-element subsets of a base set are measurable. 
This type of structure can frequently be met in various domains of mathematics, 

C Almost Rigid Mathematical Structures
221
especially in modern analysis and probability theory. Now, let be an infinite base 
set and let 5 be a structure on E of type X. Then it is not difficult to see that, for the 
pair (E, 5), the answer to Question C.3 is negative.
Another simple example of a similar situation can be obtained if we consider the 
structure of a complete graph defined on an infinite base set.
Thus, we see that it is more reasonable to investigate Question C.4 concerning the 
existence of almost rigid (respectively, almost rigid in the strong sense) substructures 
induced by the original structure 5. In this context, we wish to underline that it is 
possible to establish some general conditions which guarantee the affirmative solu­
tion of the above-mentioned question (see, for instance, Theorem C.6 below). Notice 
also that those general conditions are formulated in terms of partial isomorphisms 
or in terms of partial monomorphisms of the given structure 5.
Recall that a partial monomorphism is any injective homomorphism of the form 
f : (Y, Sy) ^ (E, 5), where Y is a subset of E and Sy is the structure on Y induced 
by the original structure 5.
Actually, one of those sufficient conditions represents an abstract version of 
the purely topological Lavrentiev’s theorem on extensions of homeomorphisms of 
subsets of Polish spaces to homeomorphisms of -subsets of such spaces. This 
classical theorem with its various generalizations and applications is thoroughly 
considered in the well-known monograph by Kuratowski [111] (cf. also [37, 74, 
130]).
In order to formulate Theorem C.6, we need a simple auxiliary notion concerning 
partial homomorphisms. Namely, let
f : (Y,Sy )^(E,S), 
g : (Z,Sz )^( E, 5)
be any two homomorphisms, where Y and are some subsets of E .
We shall say that the partial homomorphism majorizes the partial homomor­
phism g if is an extension of g.
Theorem C.6 Let S be a structure on an infinite base set E and suppose that, for 
each subset D of E with card(D) = card(E), there exists a structure Sd on D 
induced by S. Suppose also that there exists a family Ф of partial monomorphisms 
(acting from subsets of E into E) satisfying the following conditions:
(1) еагё(Ф) < card(E);
(2) for every monomorphism g : (Z, Sz) ^ (E, S), where Z c E, there is a partial 
monomorphism f e Ф such that f majorizes g.
Then there exists a subset of E satisfying these two properties:
(a) card() = card(E);
(b) for an arbitrary monomorphism h : (X, Sx) ^ (X, Sx), the cardinality of the 
set {x e X : h(x) + x} is strictly less than card(X).
Consequently, the structure Sx is almost rigid in the strong sense (in particular, Sx 
is almost rigid).

222
C Almost Rigid Mathematical Structures
Proof Let a be the least ordinal number of cardinality card(E). Obviously, we can 
represent the family Ф in the form Ф = {fg : £ < a}. Let us remark that the 
identity transformation of E belongs to the family Ф and, without loss of generality, 
we may assume that 0 coincides with this transformation. Now, let us define, using 
the method of transfinite recursion, an injective family {x^ : £ < a} of elements 
of the base set E. Suppose that 3 < a and that the partial family {x^ : £ < fi} of 
elements of E has already been defined. Consider the following two sets:
A = {ff (xc) : £ < 3, £ < 3}, 
В = {f-1 (xc) : £ < 3, £ < 3}.
Evidently, we have the relation
card(А и В) < 2(card(3))2 < card(E).
Consequently, the relation E \ (А U В) + 0 holds true. Let xp be an element of the 
set E \ (A U В).
Proceeding in such a manner, we are able to construct the required family 
{xp : £ < a} of elements of E. Further, put X = {xp : £ < a} and observe 
that the equality card() = card(E) is trivially fulfilled. From the assumptions of 
the theorem it follows that there exists a structure 5x on X induced by the original 
structure 5. Now, take an arbitrary monomorphism h : (X, Sx) ^ (X, Sx). This 
monomorphism can be considered as a monomorphism g : (X, 5x) ^ (E, 5).
According to condition (2), there exists a partial monomorphism f e Ф such that 
f majorizes g. Obviously, for some ordinal number £ < a, we must have f = fg. 
Taking into account the above construction of the set X, it is not difficult to check 
that the inequality
card({x e X : fg (x) + x}) < card(X)
holds. We also can write {x e X : /(x) + x} = {x e X : h(x) + x}. Hence, we 
obtain the inequality card({x e X : h(x) + x}) < card(X), which shows us that the 
structure Sx is almost rigid in the strong sense.
The proof of Theorem C.6 is thus finished. 
□
Let (E,S) be again a set equipped with a structure of type X.
We say that a mapping of the form f : (F, Sy ) ^ (Z, Sz) is a partial isomor­
phism (acting from (E, 5) into (E, 5)) if F and Z are subsets of E, the structures Sy 
and Sz on these subsets are induced by 5, and f is an isomorphism of Sy onto Sz.
The next result is quite similar to Theorem C.6.
Theorem C.7 Let S be a structure on an infinite base set E and suppose that, for each 
subset D of E with card(D) = card(E), there exists a structure Sd on D induced 
by S. Suppose also that there exists a family Ф of partial isomorphisms (acting from 
(E, S) into (E, S)) fulfilling these two conditions:
(1) card^) < card(E);
(2) for every partial isomorphism g acting from (E, S) into (E, S), there is a partial 
isomorphism f e Ф such that f majorizes g.

C Almost Rigid Mathematical Structures
223
Then there exists a subset of satisfying the following properties:
(a) card() = card();
(b) for an arbitrary automorphism h : (X, Sx) ^ (X, Sx) the cardinality of the set 
{x e X : h(x) + x} is strictly less than card(X).
In particular, the structure Sx is almost rigid.
The proof of Theorem C.7 is completely analogous to the proof of Theorem C.6, 
so is omitted here.
Remark C.8 The result of Theorem C.6 can sometimes be generalized to the case 
of partial morphisms which are not necessarily monomorphisms. For instance, a 
direct analog of Theorem C.6 holds for those partial morphisms which have small 
pre-images (in the sense of cardinality) of the one-element subsets of a base set . 
More precisely, if the cardinality of the set is regular and all partial morphisms 
f e Ф satisfy the inequality card( f -1 (x)) < card(E) for each element x e E, then 
the analog of Theorem C.6 is true for such partial morphisms, too.
Remark C.9 The assumption that, for each subset of E equinumerous with E , 
there exists the structure Sd on D induced by 5, is essential in the formulation of 
Theorem C.6. This can be shown for simple examples of algebraic structures. Indeed, 
let us consider as E the set of all integers equipped with the natural group operation 
- addition of numbers. It is not difficult to check that in such a case there exists a 
family Ф of partial monomorphisms satisfying conditions (1) and (2) of Theorem 
C.6. But there does not exist an infinite subgroup X ofE satisfying properties (a) and 
(b) of the same theorem. Moreover, in this case all infinite subgroups of the group E 
are isomorphic to E and the group structure of E is not an almost rigid structure in 
our sense.
Remark C.10 Let 5 be a structure on an infinite base set E. Suppose that, for every 
subset D of E, there exists a structure Sd on D induced by 5. Suppose also that there 
is a family K of subsets of E satisfying the following three conditions:
(1) card(K) < card(E);
(2) for each set belonging toK, the cardinality of the family of all monomorphisms 
from into E is less than or equal to card(E);
(3) for any monomorphism g : Y ^ E, where Y c E, there exists a monomorphism 
f : Z ^ E such that Z eK and f majorizes g (so Y c Z).
Then it is easy to see that there exists a family Ф of partial monomorphisms satisfying 
the assumptions of Theorem C.6. Consequently, we can assert the existence of a 
subset X of E such that card(X) = card(E) and the structure Sx on X induced by 5 
is almost rigid in the strong sense.
Note that the family K mentioned above is, as usual, an inner object for the 
given structure 5, i.e., an inner term for 5, according to the terminology of Bourbaki 
(see [17]). Note also that condition (3) may be considered as an abstract version of 
Lavrentiev’s theorem on extensions of homeomorphisms (cf. [37, 111]).

C Almost Rigid Mathematical Structures
Remark C.11 Let E be an infinite base set, let 5 be a structure on E, and let Ф be a 
family of partial morphisms from (E, 5) into (E, 5) satisfying these two conditions:
(1) еагё(Ф) < card(E);
(2) for every partial morphism g from (E, 5) into (E, 5), there is a partial morphism 
f e Ф such that f majorizes g.
Then there exists a mapping h : E ^ E having the property that, for each set X c E 
with card(X) = card(E), the restriction of h to X is not a morphism from X into E.
The proof of this fact is analogous to the proof of Theorem C.6. Indeed, applying 
the method of transfinite recursion, one can construct a mapping h : E ^ E so 
that the inequality card ( { e E : h() = ()}) < card(E) is true for all partial 
morphisms f e Ф.
Actually, this construction is due to Sierpinski. More precisely, Sierpinski applied 
the construction presented above in a particular situation where X is the type of a 
topological structure and the class of morphisms is the class of all continuous 
mappings. For the real line R, the corresponding result (due to Sierpinski and 
Zygmund [156]) is formulated as follows:
There exists a function h : R ^ R such that its restriction to any subset X of R 
with card(X) = card (R) is not a continuous mapping.
This result remains true after replacing R by an uncountable Polish topological 
space. The analogous result is also valid if we take the class of all Borel mappings 
as a class of morphisms (for more details, see e.g. [99]).
Remark C.12 Let E be an infinite ground set, let J be an ideal of subsets ofE, and 
let 5 be a structure on E.
We say that the structure 5 is J-rigid if, for every automorphism
f : (E,S)^(E,S),
the relation {x e E : f (x) + x} e J holds true.
We say that the structure 5 is J-rigid in the strong sense if, for every monomor­
phism
g : (E,S)^(E,S),
the relation {x e E : g (x) + x} e J holds true.
Obviously, the concept of a J -rigid structure and the concept of a J -rigid 
structure in the strong sense are far-reaching generalizations of the concepts of a 
rigid structure, of an almost rigid structure, and of an almost rigid structure in the 
strong sense. Indeed, in the definition of a rigid structure we have J = {0}, while in 
both definitions of almost rigid structures and of almost rigid structures in the strong 
sense we have
J = { c E : card() < card(E)}.
Also, it is easy to see that certain generalizations of Theorems C.6 and C.7 can 
be formulated and proved for J -rigid (J -rigid in the strong sense) mathematical 
structures. Moreover, if J satisfies some natural conditions, then a subset X of E 

C Almost Rigid Mathematical Structures
225
can be taken so that X t J and the induced structure Sx turns out to be J-rigid 
(respectively, J -rigid in the strong sense).
Let us return to almost rigid structures and to Question C.4 posed in the beginning 
of this Appendix. Namely, we wish to discuss here a natural application of Theorems 
C.6 and C.7 to the situation where X coincides with the type of a structure of a 
Dedekind complete linearly ordered set possessing some additional properties. In 
this situation we take the class of all increasing (in general, not strictly increasing) 
mappings as a class of morphisms for our type X. Consequently, in this case the 
class of all monomorphisms is the class of all strictly increasing mappings. A 
more detailed information on linearly ordered sets (and, in particular, on Dedekind 
complete linearly ordered sets) can be found, for example, in the extensive monograph 
by Sierpinski [155] (see also [113]).
First, let us consider a situation where we do not have infinite substructures almost 
rigid in the strong sense. Indeed, let X be the type of a structure of an infinite well- 
ordered set. Obviously, X is simultaneously the type of a structure of an infinite, 
Dedekind complete, linearly ordered set. Let be an arbitrary infinite set equipped 
with a structure 5 of type X. One can easily verify that there exists a monomorphism
f : (E,S')^(E,S')
such that the equality card({x e E : f (x) + x}) = card(E) is fulfilled. Similarly, 
for any infinite subset X of E, there exists a monomorphism g : (X, Sx) ^ (X, Sx) 
such that card({x e X : g(x) + x}) = card(X). Thus, the structure Sx induced on 
the set X is not almost rigid in the strong sense.
However, we shall see below that some additional assumptions on the type X of a 
structure of an infinite, Dedekind complete, linearly ordered set imply the existence 
of an infinite substructure almost rigid in the strong sense.
Our further consideration needs two simple lemmas concerning some properties 
of linearly ordered sets.
Lemma C.13 Let (E, <) be a Dedekind complete dense linearly ordered set and 
let X be a subset of E dense in E (i.e., every nonempty open subinterval of E has 
common elements with X).
Then, for each increasing mapping g : X ^ E, there exists an increasing mapping 
g* : E ^ E extending g. Moreover, if the original mapping g is strictly increasing, 
then the mapping g* is strictly increasing, too.
Proof The assertion of this lemma is well known and the argument is not difficult. 
Actually, the required extension g* can be directly defined by the formula
g* () = sup{g(x) : x e X and x < },
where is an arbitrary element of the base set E. Taking into account the fact that 
(E, <) is a dense linearly ordered set, we see that ifg is a strictly increasing mapping, 
then g* is a strictly increasing mapping, too (in general, g* is not a unique increasing 
extension of g).

C Almost Rigid Mathematical Structures
Lemma C.14 Let (E, <) be a Dedekind complete dense linearly ordered set and let 
the ground set contain at least two distinct elements.
Then card (E) > c, where c denotes the cardinality of the continuum.
This lemma is widely known, too, and can easily be proved by the standard 
method, namely, using a dyadic system of closed bounded subintervals of E. All 
details of the proof are left to the reader.
Let (E, <) be a linearly ordered set. We say that this set is isodyne if the cardinality 
of each nonempty open subinterval of E is equal to the cardinality of the ground set 
E. In other words, (E, <) is isodyne if and only if the topological space (E, T) is 
isodyne, where T stands for the order topology of (E, <).
For example, the real line (R, <) is an isodyne linearly ordered set.
Let us denote by the symbol Mon(E, E) the set of all strictly increasing mappings 
from a linearly ordered set E into itself.
Lemma C.15 Let (E, <) be an infinite isodyne linearly ordered set, let в be the least 
ordinal number of cardinality card(E), and suppose that
card(Mon(E,E)) < card(E) = card(0).
Then, introducing the notation Mon(E,E) = {ga : a < в}, there exists a subset 
X = {xa : a < в} of E satisfying the following three properties:
(1) the family {xa : a < в} is injective; in particular, the equality card(X) = 
card(E) holds true;
(2) 
X is dense everywhere in E;
(3) for each ordinal a < в and for any two ordinals ft < a and у < a, one has 
x a + gp (x7) and xa + g— (x7).
Proof The argument is very similar to the proof of Theorem C.6. Namely, we 
shall construct, by the method of transfinite recursion, some injective ^-sequence 
{xa : a < в} of elements of E.
For this purpose, denote by {Va : a < в} the family of all nonempty open 
subintervals of E . Without loss of generality, we can assume that in the family 
{ga : a < в} of all monomorphisms acting from E into E the mapping g0 is the 
identity transformation of E .
Suppose now that, for an ordinal number a < в, the partial a-sequence 
{xp : ft < a} has already been constructed. Let us define two sets:
A = {gp (Xy) : ft < а, у < a},
В = {g-(xy) : ft <a, у <a}.
Obviously, we have card( А и В) < card(E). Since E is an isodyne space, there exists 
an element x belonging to the set Va \ (А и В). Let us put xa = x.

C Almost Rigid Mathematical Structures
227
Thus, using the method of transfinite recursion, we are able to construct a certain 
в-sequence of elements of E. It is clear that this sequence is injective. Putting 
X = {xa : a < в}, it is not difficult to check that the set X is as required. Slightly 
modifying the above argument, one is able to prove that the required set can also 
satisfy the following property:
(4) card(X n V) = card(E), for each nonempty open subinterval V of E.
Clearly, property (4) is much stronger than property (2).
This ends the proof of Lemma C.15. 
□
Now, we are ready to formulate one of many results concerning the existence 
of almost rigid substructures of a mathematical structure. Keeping in mind the 
preceding lemmas, we shall restrict our consideration to the theory of Dedekind 
complete dense linearly ordered sets. The classical example of such a set is the 
real line (R, <) with its natural ordering. Another standard example is a Suslin line 
(cf. Example C.18 below).
Theorem C.16 Let (E, <) be an infinite, dense, isodyne, Dedekind complete linearly 
ordered set and let card(Mon(E, E)) < card(E). In other words, we suppose that 
Mon(E, E) = {ga : a < в}, where в is the least ordinal number corresponding to 
the cardinality of the base set E. Let X be a subset of E satisfying conditions (1), 
(2), and (3) of Lemma C.15.
Then the structure (X, <) is almost rigid in the strong sense.
Proof Let g be any monomorphism from X into X. By Lemma C.13, there exists a 
monomorphism g* which acts from E into E and extends g. Taking into account the 
properties of X , we have
card({x e X : g*(x) + x}) < card(X).
Consequently, we also have the relation
card({x e X : g(x) + x}) < card(X),
and the structure (X, <) is almost rigid in the strong sense. 
□
Example C.17 Let us put E = R and take as < the usual ordering of R. Then it is 
easy to see that Theorem C.16 can directly be applied in this special case. Hence, 
there exists an everywhere dense subset X of R such that card(X) is equal to the 
cardinality of the continuum and every strictly increasing mapping, acting from X 
into X , is an almost identity transformation of X . We can also assume that, for 
each nonempty open subinterval V of R, the intersection X n V is of cardinality c. 
Moreover, we can even assume that X is a Bernstein subset of R.
Also, we may consider a much more general situation. Namely, let к be an infinite 
cardinal number such that, for every cardinal в < к, we have the inequality 2в < к. 
Then there are dense, isodyne, Dedekind complete linearly ordered sets (E, <) 
satisfying the following conditions:

228
C Almost Rigid Mathematical Structures
(1) card(E) = 2K;
(2) E contains an everywhere dense subset D with card(D) = к.
For various examples of (E, <) with the above-mentioned properties, see, for exam­
ple, the monograph by Sierpinski [155].
Clearly, for such (E, <), the inequality card(Mon(E, E)) < card(E) holds. Thus, 
Theorem C.16 can be applied to (E, <). Using this theorem, we obtain that there 
exists a subset of E such that:
(a) card() = card(E);
(b) is dense everywhere in E;
(c) is isodyne with respect to its order topology;
(d) is almost rigid in the strong sense with respect to the induced order.
Example C.18 Let us recall that a Suslin line is a Dedekind complete dense linearly 
ordered set (E, <), without least and greatest elements, satisfying the Suslin condi­
tion (i.e., the countable chain condition, which means that every disjoint family of 
nonempty open subintervals of E is at most countable), and nonseparable in its order 
topology. It is well known that the existence of a Suslin line is consistent with ZFC 
set theory and is not provable within this theory (see, for instance, [7, 68, 108]). 
Let us briefly consider the question of the cardinality of a Suslin line E . On the one 
hand, by Lemma C.14, we have the inequality card(E) > c. On the other hand, we 
have the inequality card(E) < c. The latter fact can be deduced from each of the 
following two well-known results:
(1) the Erdos-Rado theorem from combinatorial set theory (see [
]);
42
(2) Arhangelskii’s theorem on the cardinality of a compact topological space satis­
fying the first countability axiom (see, e.g., [
]).
37
By a classical result of Kurepa [114], any Suslin line E contains an everywhere 
dense subset whose cardinality is equal to the first uncountable cardinal 1, so 
the relation card(E) < c follows immediately from Kurepa’s result and the trivial 
relation w" = 2" = c. We thus conclude that the equality card(E) = c holds true 
and that any Suslin line (E, <) is an isodyne linearly ordered set.
In addition, let us remark that, assuming Godel’s Axiom of Constructibility (V = 
L), Jensen showed the existence of a rigid Suslin line E (this axiom with its various 
consequences and applications is discussed in detail, for example, in [7, 68, 108]). 
Furthermore, Fukson proved in [49] that if the Axiom of Constructibility holds, then 
there exists a Suslin line E such that, for any continuous mapping f : E ^ E, at 
least one of the following two assertions is true:
(a) 
is a constant mapping;
(b) 
is the identity transformation of E .
Example C.19 Another interesting representative (even in ZFC theory) of Dedekind 
complete dense isodyne linearly ordered sets is the so-called long line of Alexan­
drov. This line is a nonseparable one-dimensional connected manifold containing an 
everywhere dense subset of cardinality w1 (for more details, see Exercise C.6).

C Almost Rigid Mathematical Structures
229
Example C.20 If the Continuum Hypothesis holds, then we have
c = 2" < 2"1
The Second Continuum Hypothesis is the following set-theoretical assertion:
2" = 2"1.
For this assertion, the abbreviation SCH is sometimes used. Actually, SCH was 
considered many years ago by Luzin [119], who expected that SCH is consistent 
with the usual axioms of set theory, like the classical Continuum Hypothesis (CH). 
Indeed, much later a number of models of ZFC were constructed in which the 
Second Continuum Hypothesis holds. In particular, there are models of set theory in 
which one has the equalities
2' = 2"1 = ш2.
Assume now that SCH holds true and let (E, <) be an arbitrary Dedekind com­
plete, dense, isodyne linearly ordered set containing an everywhere dense subset of 
cardinality 1 . Then we have
card(E) = 2 ‘ = 2' = c.
Also, it is not difficult to verify that
card(Mon(E,E)) < 2‘ = 2‘ = c.
Therefore, in this situation Theorem C.16 is again applicable, and we conclude that, 
within ZFC & SCH theory, any linearly ordered set (E, <) with the properties 
formulated above contains an everywhere dense subset satisfying the following:
(a) card() = card(E);
(b) is almost rigid in the strong sense (with respect to the induced order).
In addition, the required subset of E can be constructed so that, for an arbitrary 
nonempty open subinterval of E , the equality
card(X n V) = card(E)
holds. Moreover, one can even assume that is a Bernstein type subset of E, i.e., 
card(X n P) = card((E \ X) n P) = card(E) for every nonempty perfect subset P 
of E .
Example C.21 The preceding example admits a generalization to some situations 
where we have a Dedekind complete dense isodyne linearly ordered set (E, <) with 
card(E) > c. More precisely, let к and в be any two infinite cardinal numbers 
satisfying the equality 2в = к, and let (E, <) be a Dedekind complete dense isodyne 
linearly ordered set for which these two conditions are satisfied:

230
C Almost Rigid Mathematical Structures
(1) card(E) = к;
(2) 
E contains an everywhere dense subset D with card(D) = в.
Then there exists an everywhere dense subset of E such that:
(a) card() = card(E);
(b) is almost rigid in the strong sense (with respect to the induced order).
Moreover, one may assume that, for any nonempty open subinterval of E, the 
equality card(V П X) = card(E) holds true (in particular, X is an isodyne linearly 
ordered set).

Some Unsolved Problems in Measure Theory
There are many problems in real analysis and measure theory, which have not yet 
been solved and which are attractive for researchers working (more or less actively) in 
these classical fields of mathematics. Of course, the significance of these problems 
varies: some of them are interesting for a limited circle of specialists, some are 
topical or, at least, deserve to be discussed and investigated, while the others are 
of great importance and stimulate the further development of various branches of 
mathematical analysis.
Here we would like to present a short list of problems and questions in measure 
theory, which still remain unsolved, although most of them were posed many years 
ago and may be regarded as old (see, e.g., [90, 91]). In our opinion, these problems 
and questions are interesting from the purely measure-theoretical point of view. 
Also, they have nontrivial connections with certain topics of abstract set theory, 
group theory, and general topology.
For the reader’s convenience, in our further presentation we often recall the 
corresponding notions before formulating the problems. We also systematically 
provide comments and examples related to the discussed problems.
As usual, ZFC abbreviates the standard Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory (see [68, 
108, 113]).
The symbol denotes the least infinite ordinal (cardinal) number.
The symbol 1 denotes the least uncountable ordinal (cardinal) number.
R stands, as usual, for the set of all real numbers (i.e., R is the real line).
c denotes the cardinality of the continuum (i.e., c = card(R) = 2").
Q stands for the set of all rational numbers.
Let be a ground set and let be a group of transformations of . So we may 
consider the pair (,), which is usually called a space equipped (endowed) with a 
transformation group.
Suppose that a nonzero ^-finite measure p is defined on a ^-algebra of subsets of 
E. As a rule, this <x-algebra will be denoted by dom(p) (domain of p). The <x-ideal 
generated by the family of all p-measure zero sets will be denoted by I(p).
A measure p on E is called continuous (or diffuse) if {x} e dom(p) and p({x}) = 
0 for each x e E.

D Some Unsolved Problems in Measure Theory
A cardinal number a is called measurable in the Ulam sense (or, sometimes, 
real-valued measurable) if there exists a nonzero ^-finite diffuse measure p whose 
domain coincides with the family of all subsets of a (i.e., dom() = P(a)).
It is known that the existence of real-valued cardinal numbers cannot be estab­
lished within contemporary ZFC set theory (see [68, 108, 113]).
Given a nonzero ^-finite measure p on E, we can associate with p the Hilbert 
space L2 (p) consisting of all real-valued square integrable functions on E (and, 
of course, p-equivalent functions are identified). The topological weight of L2(p) 
is a certain cardinal characteristic (invariant) of p. In the sequel, we refer to this 
cardinal invariant as the weight of p. In the literature one usually encounters the 
terms “character of p” or “separability character of p” instead of the weight of p 
(see, for instance, [62]).
If the space L2 (p) is separable, then p is called a separable measure.
Accordingly, if L2 (p) is nonseparable, then p is called a nonseparable measure.
If for a given ^-finite measure p on E, the ^-algebra dom(p) is countably 
generated, then p turns out to be separable. The converse assertion is not true, in 
general, as simple examples show.
Let E be again a ground set, be a group of transformations of E , and let p be a 
^-finite measure defined on some ^-algebra of subsets of E.
p is called -quasi-invariant if both dom( p) and I(p) are -invariant classes 
of subsets of E .
A -quasi-invariant measure p is called -invariant if p (()) = p() for all 
transformations g e G and for all sets X e dom(p).
Example D.1 Let be a natural number and let R denote the Euclidean 
-dimensional space. This space is endowed with the following two classical groups 
of transformations:
= the group of all translations of R (usually identified with R);
= the group of all isometric transformations of R.
The standard Lebesgue measure on R is -invariant (consequently, also 
Tn -invariant). Note that if n > 1, then there exist many measures on R" which extend
, are -invariant but are not -invariant (see, e.g., [91]).
If n = 1, then R" = R and, for the sake of brevity, we shall write instead of 1.
Example D.2 Let (G, •) be a ^-compact locally compact topological group (identi­
fied with the group of all its left translations). As is well known, there exists a nonzero 
<T-finite G-invariant Borel measure p on G, the (left) Haar measure (see [32,58,62]). 
This measure is unique in the following sense: every ^-finite G-invariant Borel mea­
sure on G is proportional to p. In other words, the equality = •p holds for some 
real constant > 0 which depends on , i.e., = ().
Example D.3 Let (E, G) be a space endowed with a transformation group and let p 
be a nonzero ^-finite G-invariant measure on E. For every p-measurable function 
ф : E ^ ]0, +c» [, we may put
v(X) = 
ф(x)dp(x) 
(X e dom(p)).

233
So we get a nonzero ^-finite measure v which is defined on the ^-algebra dom(p). 
It can easily be seen that v is a ^-finite G-quasi-invariant measure. Actually, p and 
v are equivalent measures in the sense that I() = I(v).
Since the notion of a quasi-invariant measure and the notion of an invariant 
measure are closely connected with each other, some problems listed below will be 
formulated simultaneously for both kinds of measures.
The concept of metrical transitivity of a quasi-invariant measure is classical and 
well-known in the theory of dynamical systems and ergodic theory.
A ^-finite G-quasi-invariant measure p on E is called G-metrically transitive (or 
G-ergodic) if, for any -measurable set with () > 0, there exists a countable 
family {gi : i e I} of transformations from G such that
p(E \ u{g,-(X) : i e I}) = 0.
Example D.4 The (left) Haar measure p on a ^-compact locally compact topological 
group (G, •) is G-metrically transitive (in particular, the Lebesgue measure An, 
considered as a -invariant measure, is -metrically transitive). More generally, 
if is an everywhere dense subgroup of G, then p treated as a left -invariant 
measure is -metrically transitive as well.
Given an abstract space (E, G) equipped with a transformation group, we may 
introduce the following two natural classes of measures:
M1 (E,G) = the class of all those nonzero ^-finite measures on E which are 
G-invariant;
M2(E, G) = the class of all those nonzero ^-finite measures on E which are 
G-quasi-invariant.
Clearly, we have the inclusion M1 (E, G) c M2 (E, G). The first problem concerning 
these two classes of measures is on proper extensions of members of M1 (E, G) 
(respectively, of M2(E, G)). It is stated as follows.
Problem D.5 Find necessary and sufficient conditions, in terms of (E, G), under 
which for every measure p belonging to the class M1 (E, G) (respectively, to the 
class M2(E, G)) there exists a measure p' also belonging to M1 (E, G) (respectively, 
to M2(E, G)) and strictly extending p.
More or less trivial examples show that certain conditions on (E, G) are necessary 
for the existence of a required extension p'.
Actually, ifG is a small group of transformations ofE, then Problem D.5 becomes 
purely set-theoretical and its solution depends on additional hypotheses consistent 
with ZFC. To illustrate this, suppose for a moment that G contains only the identical 
transformation of E. In this case, if card(E) is nonmeasurable in the Ulam sense, 
then the required extension p' of a nonzero ^-finite diffuse measure p on E always 
exists. But if card(E) is measurable in the Ulam sense, then p' does not necessarily 
exist, because it may happen that dom(p) = P(E).

234
D Some Unsolved Problems in Measure Theory
Also, it is worth mentioning in connection with Problem D.5 that, given a - 
quasi-invariant (respectively, -invariant) measure and considering various - 
quasi-invariant (respectively, -invariant) extensions of , one should be aware of 
various “good” properties of . In other words, when extending , one may try to 
preserve “nice” properties of (e.g., its -metrical transitivity, its separability, etc).
A special and important case of Problem D.5 is when the ground set is itself a 
group and coincides with the group of all left translations of , so and can 
be identified by a canonical isomorphism. Even in this particular case the reduced 
version of Problem D.5 remains open.
Problem D.6 Let (G, •) be an uncountable group. Is it true that, for every measure p 
belonging to the class 1 (, ) (respectively, to the class 2 (, )), there exists 
a measure p' also belonging to M1 (G, G) (respectively, to М2(G, G)) and strictly 
extending ?
Let us make some remarks in connection with Problem D.6. If is an arbitrary 
measure from the class М2 (G,G), then the ^-algebra dom(p) differs from the family 
P(G). Moreover, a much stronger statement can be proved by using the fact that the 
least uncountable cardinal 1 is not measurable in the Ulam sense. Let us recall the 
formulation of this theorem.
Theorem D.7 Let (G, •) be an uncountable group, p be a measure from the class 
М2 (G, G) and let be a p-measurable set with p() > 0. Then there exists a set 
Y с X such that Y £ dom(p).
Theorem D.7 turned out to be useful for certain questions of measure theory. In 
particular, it was applied to the uniqueness property of ^-finite invariant measures 
(cf. [82]). In particular, Theorem D.7 indicates that proper G-quasi-invariant exten­
sions of p may exist. Indeed, as turns out, the answer to the question of Problem 
D.6 is positive if one assumes the non-existence of cardinal numbers measurable in 
the Ulam sense (cf. [63, 143, 172]). Nevertheless, Problem D.6 still remains open 
within ZFC set theory.
It is reasonable to consider two analogs of Problems D.5 and D.6 in terms of 
so-called absolutely negligible sets. First of all, we recall the precise definition of 
such sets.
Let ( , G) be an abstract space equipped with a transformation group.
A set X с is G-absolutely negligible if, for any measure p from the class 
M1 (E, G) (respectively, from the class М2(E, G)), there exists a measure p' from 
M1 (E, G) (respectively, from М2(E,G)) extending p and such that X e dom(p') 
and p’( X) = 0.
Various properties of absolutely negligible sets are discussed in [90, 91, 172]. 
A purely algebraic (or, if one prefers, purely geometric) characterization of G- 
absolutely negligible sets in terms of the pair (E, G) can also be found in those 
works. Namely, we have the following result.

Theorem D.8 Let be a space equipped with a transformation group and let 
be a subset of . These two assertions are equivalent:
(1) for any countable family {gt : i e I} c G, there exists a countable family 
{hj : j e J} c G such that
n{h7(u{g,-(X) : i e I}) : j e J} = 0;
(2) is G-absolutely negligible.
As one can see, condition (1) is purely geometric, because it does not appeal to 
the concept of an invariant (quasi-invariant) measure.
It directly follows from the above definition that the family of all G-absolutely 
negligible sets in forms a G-invariant ideal of subsets of which, in general, does 
not need to be a ^-ideal. Moreover, in certain situations it becomes possible to cover 
by countably many G-absolutely negligible sets. So the next problem naturally 
arises.
Problem D.9 Find necessary and sufficient conditions on a space (, G) under 
which there is a countable family {X,- : i e I} of subsets of E having the property 
that all Xi (i e I) are G-absolutely negligible and u{X,- : i e I} = E.
Observe that if for a space (E, G) the above-mentioned family {X,- : i e I} exists, 
then Problem D.5 is positively solvable for (E, G). Indeed, in such a case, given 
any measure from 2(E, G) (respectively, from 
1 (E, G)), we get that at least
one set Xi must be nonmeasurable with respect to p. So, by using this X,-, we may 
strictly extend p to a measure p' belonging to М2(E, G) (respectively, belonging to 
1(E, G)).
In light of this, the next special form of Problem D.9 is of interest, too.
Problem D.10 Let (G, •) be an uncountable group (identified with the group of all 
left translations of G). Does there exist a countable family {X,- : i e I} having the 
property that all sets X,- (i e I) are G-absolutely negligible and u{X,- : i e I} = G?
We point out that in some particular cases Problem D.10 admits a positive solution. 
To show this, let us recall the widely known notion of a solvable group.
A group (G, •) is said to be solvable if there exists a finite sequence
G0 D G1 D G2 D • • • D Gfc-1 d Gk
of subgroups of (G, •) such that:
(a) 
G0 = G and G = {}, where denotes the neutral element of G;
(b) for every natural index i e [1, k], the group Gf is a normal subgroup of Gf-1 
and the quotient-group Gi-1/Gi is commutative.
We have the following theorem (see, e.g., [90, 91]).
Theorem D.11 If (G, •) isan uncountable solvable group, then G admits a countable 
covering, all members of which are G-absolutely negligible sets in G.

236
D Some Unsolved Problems in Measure Theory
Moreover, the technique of absolutely negligible sets turned out to be useful even 
in those cases where a basic transformation group is not, in general, solvable. For 
example, it was demonstrated that if coincides with the Euclidean -dimensional 
space R", where n > 1, and G coincides with the group Isn of all isometric 
transformations of R, then there exists a countable covering of with -absolutely 
negligible sets. So, in this classical case, we have a positive solution of Problem D.5 
(for more details, see [25, 27, 77, 78, 139, 171, 172]).
Recall that, for n > 3, the group Is" is very far from being solvable. This fact im­
plies that, forn > 3, there are various paradoxical decompositions of bounded subsets 
of R" with nonempty interiors (see the extensive monograph [167] in which many 
themes related to the famous Banach-Tarski paradox are thoroughly discussed).
From the above-mentioned result on proper extensions of I s"-invariant (respec­
tively, I s"-quasi-invariant) measures it directly follows that if is any I s" -invariant 
extension of the standard Lebesgue measure " on R" , then there always exists an 
Is"-invariant measure p' on R" strictly extending p.
Furthermore, it turns out that, for n > 1, there are even nonseparable I s" -invariant 
measures on R" which extend " . Now, we would like to say a few words about such 
extensions.
As earlier, let " stand for the group of all translations of R" . Two methods of 
constructing nonseparable "-invariant extensions of " can be distinguished. The 
first of them is due to Kakutani and Oxtoby [71], while the second method is due to 
Kodaira and Kakutani [103].
The method of Kakutani and Oxtoby admits a natural generalization to a certain 
class of spaces (E, G), which includes some types of uncountable ^-compact locally 
compact topological groups (see [62], cf. also [94]). Besides, a nonseparable "­
invariant measure p on R" obtained by this method is such that its weight is equal 
to 2c , i.e., attains the maximum value. However, there is a weak side of the method, 
because p is not "-metrically transitive ("-ergodic).
The second method, due to Kodaira and Kakutani, has a certain advantage. 
Namely, the nonseparable "-invariant measure on R" obtained by their method 
preserves the property of "-metrical transitivity of " (surprisingly, this important 
fact is not stated in [103]). But the construction of only yields that the weight of 
is equal to c, i.e., is not maximal.
In this context, the following question arises.
Problem D.12 Let n > 1 be a natural number. Does there exist an I s" -invariant 
measure on R" which extends the Lebesgue measure ", is also I s" -metrically 
transitive, and whose weight is equal to 2c ?
By using the Continuum Hypothesis, a nonseparable complete measure on 
R can be constructed so that extends the Lebesgue measure , the weight of 
is equal to c and the <r-ideal I (v) of all v-measure zero sets coincides with the 
<T-ideal I (A) of all A-measure zero sets. In other words, the measure v being a 
nonseparable extension of the Lebesgue measure A does not expand the <r-ideal 
I (A) of all Lebesgue measure zero sets.
In this connection, the next problem seems to be of some interest.

D Some Unsolved Problems in Measure Theory
237
Problem D.13 Investigate (possibly, with the aid of additional set-theoretical as­
sumptions such as the Continuum Hypothesis or Martin’s Axiom) whether there 
exists a measure в on R satisfying the following properties:
(a) 
в extends A;
(b) the weight of в is equal to 2c;
(c) the <r-ideal I (в) of all 0-measure zero sets coincides with the <r-ideal I (A) of 
all A-measure zero sets.
As has been said earlier, -absolutely negligible sets in a space (, ) are very 
good from the point of view of the measure extension problem for ^-finite invariant 
(quasi-invariant) measures. But, in many cases, there are subsets of a ground space 
which are extremely bad from the measure-theoretical view-point. Recall the 
definition of the latter subsets of (see [90, 91]).
A set X с E is G-absolutely nonmeasurable if, for every measure ^ belonging 
to the class М2(E, G), we have X £ dom(ц).
In other words, X с E is G-absolutely nonmeasurable if X is simultaneously 
nonmeasurable with respect to all measures from М2 (E, G) .
Various properties of G-absolutely nonmeasurable sets are discussed in [90] and 
[91]. One of the simplest properties is indicated in the following example.
Example D.14 If X is a G-absolutely nonmeasurable subset of E, then there 
exists a countable family {g,- : i e I} of transformations from G such that 
u{gf (X) : i e I} = E.
However, the property described in the above example is very far from being 
sufficient for asserting that X is G-absolutely nonmeasurable in E. In this context, 
we would like to mention only one result.
Theorem D.15 Let (G, +) be an uncountable commutative group and let X be a 
subset of G. The following two statements are equivalent:
(1) there exists a countable family {gi : i e I} of elements of G such that 
u{gi + X : i e I} = G;
(2) 
X contains a G -absolutely nonmeasurable set in G.
Thus, Theorem D.15 yields a characterization of all those sets in (G, +) which 
contain at least one G-absolutely nonmeasurable subset. In this connection, the next 
problem can be posed.
Problem D.16 Does the above characterization remain true for more general classes 
of uncountable groups (e.g., for uncountable solvable groups (G, •))?
Example D.17 In [30] a function ф : R ^ R is constructed such that the graph Gr(ф) 
of ф has the following property: there exists a countable family {g,- : i e I} с Is2 
for which the equality
u{gt(Gr(фф) : i e I} = R2
holds true. It can easily be verified that:

238
D Some Unsolved Problems in Measure Theory
(a) Gr(ф) is an Is2-absolutely nonmeasurable subset of the plane R2;
(b) Gr(ф) is not a T2-absolutely nonmeasurable subset of R2.
The next problem remains open, too.
Problem D.18 In terms of (, ), find a precise characterization of -absolutely 
nonmeasurable subsets of .
Let us formulate one more problem concerning absolutely nonmeasurable sets, 
closely connected with the preceding ones.
Problem D.19 Find necessary and sufficient conditions on (, ) under which there 
exists at least one -absolutely nonmeasurable subset of .
The following question is a special important case of Problem D.19.
Problem D.20 Let (G, •) be an uncountable group (identified with the group of all 
left translations of ). Does there exist a -absolutely nonmeasurable subset of ?
Again, it should be indicated that, for some sufficiently wide classes of uncount­
able groups, the answer to this question turns out to be positive. In particular, we 
have the following result (cf. Chapter 11 of this book).
Theorem D.21 If (G, •) is an uncountable solvable group, then there are G- 
absolutely nonmeasurable sets in G.
As a corollary of Theorem D.21, we obtain that there are G-absolutely nonmea- 
surable sets in any uncountable commutative group (G, +) (this also immediately 
follows from Theorem D.15). So, if a natural number is strictly positive, then there 
exist -absolutely nonmeasurable sets in the Euclidean space R.
From the facts mentioned above one can conclude that, for a large class of 
uncountable groups (G, •), there are G-absolutely negligible sets and G-absolutely 
nonmeasurable sets in G.
Now, we would like to recall an old result of Sierpinski [153], according to which 
there exist two 2-measure zero sets X c R and Y c R such that their sum
X + Y = {x + у : x e X, у e Y}
is nonmeasurable with respect to .
Note that a somewhat similar result is also known for the sum of Borel subsets of 
R, namely, there exist two Borel sets X' c R and Y' c R whose sum
X’ + Y’ = {x’ + у’ : x’ e X, у’ e Y'}
is not Borel (see, e.g., [99] and references therein). Obviously, X’ + Y’ is an analytic, 
i.e., Suslin, subset of R.
Remarkably, Sierpinski’s result [153] initiated a series of further publications on 
this topic. The next problem is also motivated by the same result and is concerned 
with sums of absolutely negligible sets.

D Some Unsolved Problems in Measure Theory
239
Problem D.22 Let (, +) be an uncountable commutative group. Do there exist two 
G-absolutely negligible sets A c G and В c G such that their sum
A + В = {a + b : a 6 A, b e В}
is a G-absolutely nonmeasurable set in G?
In this direction, the following theorem has been established.
Theorem D.23 Let (, +) be a vector space over the field Q of all rational numbers 
and let card( E) > c.
Then there are two E-absolutely negligible sets A c E and В c E such that their 
sum A + В is an E-absolutely nonmeasurable set in E.
In particular, if > 1, then there are two R -absolutely negligible subsets of R 
whose sum is an R -absolutely nonmeasurable set in R.
One straightforward consequence of this theorem should be pointed out here. 
Namely, we have
Theorem D.24 Under the Continuum Hypothesis, every uncountable vector space 
E over Q contains two E-absolutely negligible sets A and В such that their sum 
A + В turns out to be E-absolutely nonmeasurable.
Problem D.25 Is it possible to obtain the above consequence within ZFC set theory?
A certain analog of Theorem D.23 in terms of topological measure theory is 
discussed in [92].
Naturally, properties of G-absolutely negligible subsets and of G-absolutely non- 
measurable subsets of E substantially depend on the structural properties of G . In 
particular, we should distinguish between the two classical cases where a ground 
space E coincides with the Euclidean -dimensional space R and G coincides either 
with the group of all translations of R or with the group of all isometric 
transformations of R.
Problem D.26 Let > 2 be a natural number. Does there exist a -absolutely 
negligible set in R which simultaneously is -absolutely nonmeasurable?
Even for = 2 the answer to this question remains unknown. Notice that for 
= 1 the class of all -absolutely negligible sets is identical with the class of all 
-absolutely negligible sets, so in this situation there does not exist a -absolutely 
negligible set which is -absolutely nonmeasurable.
As is widely known, many analogies have been observed between the two fun­
damental concepts of real analysis: Lebesgue measurability and Baire property. An 
excellent reference is Oxtoby’s small textbook [136] (see also Morgan’s much more 
extensive monograph [129] in which a unified approach to these two concepts is de­
veloped). Here are two simple facts concerning analogies between Lebesgue measure 
and the Baire property:

240
D Some Unsolved Problems in Measure Theory
(i) if n > 1, then there exists a 2„-measure zero subset of R" that does not possess 
the Baire property;
(ii) if n > 1, then there exists a first category subset of R" that is not "-measurable.
The assertions (i) and (ii) readily follow from the existence of a partition {, } 
of R" such that is of " -measure zero and is of first category in R" (see, e.g., 
[136]).
In connection with (ii), we formulate the next question.
Problem D.27 Let n > 1 be a natural number. Does there exist an 
" -absolutely
nonmeasurable subset of R" which has the Baire property?
Recall that a set X c R" is almost Isn-invariant with respect to the Lebesgue 
measure An if, for each transformation g e Isn, one has
An (g (X )д X) = 0.
By using the Continuum Hypothesis (or Martin’s Axiom), it can be demonstrated 
that if n > 1, then there exists a partition {X, } of R", where both sets X and 
are almost is" -invariant with respect to " and none of them is of "-measure zero 
(cf. [62, 71, 90, 91, 136, 164, 165, 172]). It is unknown whether the analogous result 
holds in ZFC set theory.
Problem D.28 Let n > 1 be a natural number. Does there exist (within ZFC theory) 
a partition {X, } of R" such that both sets X and are almost I S"-invariant with 
respect to " and none of them is of "-measure zero?
It may happen that this question cannot be resolved without the aid of additional 
set-theoretical hypotheses.
For now, let us return to the notion of a Sierpinski-Zygmund function (see 
[26, 99, 111, 156], and Chapter 3 of this book). Any function of this kind is extremely 
discontinuous, so is utterly bad from the purely topological point of view. The precise 
definition of such functions is as follows.
A mapping f : R ^ R is called a Sierpinski-Zygmund function if, for any set 
X c R with card(X) = c, the restriction of to X is not continuous.
Various interesting and unexpected properties of Sierpinski-Zygmund functions 
are discussed in the above-mentioned works.
Let MB (R) denote the class of the completions of all nonzero <r-finite continuous 
Borel measures on R. It is not hard to show that every Sierpinski-Zygmund function 
is absolutely nonmeasurable with respect to MB (R), i.e., is nonmeasurable with 
respect to every measure from MB (R) . Indeed, the graph of is a totally imperfect 
subset of R2, whence the required result follows taking into account Luzin’s - 
property. In particular, is nonmeasurable with respect to the Lebesgue measure 
(the latter fact implies that the existence of Sierpinski-Zygmund functions can be 
established only by using uncountable forms of the Axiom of Choice).
On the other hand, it was demonstrated in [93] that there exists a translation­
invariant measure on R which extends the Lebesgue measure and for which 

D Some Unsolved Problems in Measure Theory
241
some Sierpinski-Zygmund function : R ^ R turns out to be p-measurable. This 
function ф is not additive, i.e., is not an endomorphism of the additive group (R, +) 
into itself. So the following problem arises.
Problem D.29 Does there exist a Sierpinski-Zygmund function f : R ^ R satisfy­
ing these two conditions:
(1) is additive (in other words, is a solution of the classical Cauchy functional 
equation);
(2) is measurable with respect to some R-invariant measure on R which extends 
the Lebesgue measure ?
Observe that if in the formulation of Problem D.29 translation invariance is 
replaced by translation-quasi-invariance, then such a function does exist (for more 
details, see [93] and [99]).
Now, let us recall a notion somewhat similar to the concept of an absolutely 
negligible set (see Chapters 10 and 11 of the present book).
Let (, ) be again an abstract space equipped with a transformation group and 
let be a subset of .
We say that is -negligible in if these two properties hold:
(a) there exists a nonzero ^-finite G-invariant (G-quasi-invariant) measure p0 on E 
such that X e dom(p0) and p0(X) = 0;
(b) if p is an arbitrary ^-finite G-invariant (G-quasi-invariant) measure on E such 
that X e dom( ), then (X) = 0.
It can easily be seen that every G-absolutely negligible set is G-negligible as well. 
The converse assertion fails to be true, in general, as simple examples show.
Since we have a suitable characterization of G-absolutely negligible sets (see 
Theorem D.8), it makes sense to formulate the next problem.
Problem D.30 Let (E, G) bea space equipped with a transformation group. In terms 
of the pair (E, G), give a characterization of all G-negligible subsets ofE.
Let us consider the particular case where the base set E is a commutative group 
and G coincides with the group of all left translations of E (naturally, the latter is 
identified with E ).
Problem D.31 Give a characterization of all those groups (G, •) which admit a finite 
decomposition into G-negligible subsets.
In connection with Problem D.31, we should recall the main result of Chapter 
10, where it was demonstrated that every uncountable solvable group (G, •) can be 
decomposed into three G-negligible subsets.
Let now (G, +) be a commutative group and let X be a subset of G such that 
there exists an uncountable family {g,- : i e I} of elements of G for which the 
corresponding family of sets {g,- + X : i e I} is disjoint. Then we can assert that the 
set X is G-negligible. This fact is implied by the following auxiliary theorem, which 
is not difficult to prove and is sometimes useful.

242
D Some Unsolved Problems in Measure Theory
Theorem D.32 Let (, +) be a commutative group, be a subset of and suppose 
that these two conditions are satisfied:
(1) U{h j + Z : j e J} = G for some family {h j : j e J} of elements of G;
(2) there exists a family {gi : i e I} of elements of G such that the corresponding 
family of sets {g,- + Z : i e I} is disjoint.
Then the inequality card( J) > card(I) holds true.
It directly follows from Theorem D.32 that if a subset of a commutative group 
(G, +) is such that, for a certain uncountable family {gf : i e I} c G, the family of 
sets {gi + X : i e I} is disjoint, then
card(G \ U{h + 
: e J}) >
whenever {h : e J} is any countable family of elements of G.
Keeping this in mind, it is easy to define a probability G-invariant measure 0 on 
G such that X e dom(0) and 0(X) = 0. Also, in view of the disjointness of the 
uncountable family of sets {gt + X : i e I}, we infer that р(X) = 0 for every ^-finite 
G-quasi-invariant measure on G such that X e dom(). So, X is a G-negligible 
subset of G .
The following simple example serves as an illustration of the above.
Example D.33 Let 2 stand, as earlier, for the group of all translations of the plane 
R2, let f : R ^ R be a function, and let Gr( f) denote the graph of f. Then Gr( f) is 
a 2-negligible subset of R2, but the same Gr( ) does not need to be a 2-absolutely 
negligible set (cf. Chapter 12 of the present book).
Example D.34 It can be proved, by assuming the Continuum Hypothesis, that there 
exists a subset ofR ( > 1) satisfying the following two conditions:
(a) U{h + : e J} = R for some countable family {h : e J} of elements of
R;
(b) there exists an uncountable family {g,- : i e I} of elements of R" such that 
card((g,- + Y)n(gr + Y)) < ш
for any two distinct indices i e I and i ' e I.
For a proof, see Chapter 11, where the more general case of a certain commutative 
group (G, +) with card(G) = 1 is considered. Clearly, the above-mentioned set Y 
turns out to be " -absolutely nonmeasurable.
Let (, G) be a space endowed with a transformation group. For every ordinal 
number a, we introduce the class Ka of subsets of E. For this purpose, we first put:
X e Ko if and only if there exists an uncountable family {g,- : i e I} of elements 
from G such that the family {g,- (X) : i e I} is disjoint.
Suppose now that, for an ordinal a, all the classes Kp (/3 < a) have already been 
defined. Then we put:

D Some Unsolved Problems in Measure Theory
243
X e Ka if and only if there exists an uncountable family {g,- : i e I} of 
elements from G such that, for any two distinct indices i e I and i' e I, the relation 
gi (X) П gj'(X) e U{Kp : p < a} holds true.
By using the method of transfinite induction, it is not difficult to prove that, for 
any ordinal a, all sets X from the class Ka have the following property: if p is an 
arbitrary ^-finite G-quasi-invariant measure on E and X e dom(p), then p(X) = 0.
Example D.35 Let E = R" and let G = Tn, where n > 1. It can be shown that 
there exists a G-absolutely nonmeasurable subset of E belonging to the class K1 
(cf. Example D.34).
Some interesting problems arise in connection with absolutely nonmeasurable 
additive functions (i.e., absolutely nonmeasurable homomorphisms of commutative 
groups).
Let (G, +) be an uncountable commutative group and let (, +) be an uncountable 
commutative Polish group. We say that a homomorphism ф from G to H is absolutely 
nonmeasurable if, for every nonzero ^-finite G-quasi-invariant measure p on G, this 
ф is nonmeasurable with respect to p.
Let T denote the additive group of the one-dimensional unit torus (actually, T 
stands for the circle group). We have the following theorem.
Theorem D.36 Let (G, +) be a commutative group and let G0 be the torsion sub­
group of G.
These two conditions are equivalent:
(1) the quotient group g/g0 is uncountable;
(2) there exists a homomorphism ф from G into R (into T) which is absolutely 
nonmeasurable with respect to the class 
2(G, G), i.e., for any measure p e
М2(G, G), the mapping ф is nonmeasurable with respect to p.
In view of Theorem D.36, the next example is relevant.
Example D.37 Let C = {0,1}ы denote the Cantor space regarded as a commutative 
compact metrizable group with respect to the standard product topology and group 
operation modulo 2. By using the Continuum Hypothesis (Martin’s axiom), it can be 
demonstrated that C contains a Luzin subset (a generalized Luzin subset) L which 
simultaneously is a subgroup of C. So, under these additional axioms, there exist 
universal measure zero subgroups of C which are equinumerous with C. Let now 
(G, +) be an arbitrary 2-divisible commutative group (e.g., G = R or G = T). 
Then it is clear that any homomorphism ф : G ^ C is trivial and, consequently, 
there exist no absolutely nonmeasurable homomorphisms acting from G into C 
(although condition (1) in the formulation of Theorem D.36 may be satisfied for 
G). At the same time, one can see that the identical embedding of L into C is an 
absolutely nonmeasurable group monomorphism. Moreover, one can assert that the 
same identical embedding is absolutely nonmeasurable with respect to the class of 
all nonzero ^-finite diffuse measures on L.

In connection with Theorem D.36 and Example D.37, the following problem 
naturally arises.
Problem D.38 Let (, +) be an uncountable commutative group and let (, +) be 
an uncountable commutative Polish topological group. Find necessary and sufficient 
conditions for the existence of an absolutely nonmeasurable homomorphism from 
(, +) into (, +).
Obviously, an analogous problem can be formulated in terms of uncountable 
non-commutative groups.
