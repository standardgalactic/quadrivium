About the Authors
Bill Chiaravalle knows brands and how to build them. His experience
includes a decade-long stint as Design and Creative Director at the world-
renowned brand strategy and design firm Landor Associates, where he
worked on the branding programs for American Express, AT&T, Bacardi, Bell
Atlantic, Danone, Delta Airlines, FedEx, Gatorade, Hyatt, IBM, Microsoft, NEC,
P&G, Smucker’s, Sunkist, Sutter Home, and many others.
Since founding his own firm, Brand Navigation, in 1999, Bill’s role as Principal
and Creative Director has been to assist clients large and small in the devel-
opment of strategic positions and creative visions and expressions for their
brands. A short list of clients Brand Navigation has worked with include
Microsoft, Intel, The Miami Herald, Thomas Nelson Publishers, Krusteaz,
Canterbury Cuisine, John C. Maxwell, and Bubbies of San Francisco.
Bill was born in San Francisco and received his training at the Academy of Art
University in San Francisco. He has been honored with numerous branding,
design, and industry awards. Away from brands, he enjoys spending time
with his wife and four children, biking, swimming, fine dining, and jazz music.
He lives in Sisters, Oregon. To visit his company online, go to www.brand
navigation.com.
Barbara Findlay Schenck knows marketing and why brands are so important.
She’s a business strategist with more than 20 years of experience helping com-
panies and organizations shape their brands, messages, and marketing plans.
She’s worked internationally in community development, served as a college
admissions director and writing instructor in Hawaii, and cofounded an adver-
tising agency in Oregon that ranked as one of the Northwest’s Top 15 at the
time of its sale in 1995. Since then, she’s written Small Business Marketing 
For Dummies, Business Plans Kit For Dummies, 2nd Edition, and numerous
branding and marketing courses, presentations, and plans.
When not thinking about marketing issues, she’s likely traveling, golfing,
enjoying the Northwest with her husband, Peter, or trekking to the San
Francisco area to visit their son, Matthew. You can contact her via e-mail at
BFSchenck@aol.com.


Authors’ Acknowledgments
Where to begin?
We start by giving heartfelt thanks to the long list of businesses and organiza-
tions that have entrusted their brands and business hopes to each of us over
the years. Here’s to your continued success!
We also give huge thanks to Wiley Publishing, Inc. for allowing us this once-in-
a-lifetime opportunity to explain branding in the famous format of the world’s
most famous book brand. Acquisitions Director Joyce Pepple, Acquisitions
Editor Mike Lewis, Senior Project Editor Chrissy Guthrie, and Senior Copy
Editor Elizabeth Rea made the making of this book a pure pleasure and won
our highest regard and appreciation.
Special thanks also go to Bill Berenson, owner of Brand Architects, who
applied his widely regarded expertise and wisdom during the technical
review of this book. We’re fortunate for his talent.
Additionally, we each have personal lists of thanks.
From Bill: In addition to developing brands for over 20 years, I’ve been
involved in the design of more than a thousand book covers in my lifetime.
But I’d never considered writing one — until Barbara Schenck approached
me. Thank you Barbara and Peter, you have been kind advocates for almost
a decade. Thanks also to my staff at Brand Navigation: Ben, DeAnna, Russ,
Steve, Terra, Mark, and Brittany. Without you, designing brands wouldn’t be
near as much fun.
Special thanks to my children, Heidi, Wil, Michael, and Laura, who love me
regardless of my obsession with brands.
And, most of all, to my beautiful wife, who is not only my business partner
but my friend and the love of my life. You complete me.
From Barbara: Deep thanks to Bill for agreeing to coauthor this book and for
adding so significantly to its value. And immeasurable gratitude to those who
make all the joys and successes in my life possible: My husband, Peter, my
son, Matthew, my three sisters, and my parents.
Finally, thanks to you for selecting this book as your brand building guide.
As you enter or travel farther into the world of branding, please take all our
best wishes with you!

Introduction
C
ongratulations! You’re about to take control of your brand.
If you’re thinking, “I don’t even have a brand,” then this book is definitely for
you. It’s also for anyone who wants to build a better brand, repair a broken
brand, extend the power of a brand, or start from scratch and create a brand-
new brand.
Branding has always been a red-hot topic (pardon the pun, pardner), but
that’s even more the case in today’s competitive business world. When con-
sumers hear your organization’s name, memories pop up that influence what
they think and how they buy. Those memories are the basis of your brand. If
you have a name people know, then you have the basis of a brand. This book
is all about making sure that the brand you have is the brand you want.
Branding is the single biggest buzzword in marketing today for good reason:
Brands pave the way for marketing success. Count on this book to demystify
the topic and lead you to a better, stronger brand so that you can compete
successfully in the big, branded world around you.
About This Book
When the publisher of one of the world’s most recognized book brands asked
us to write a yellow-and-black book on branding, we knew we were looking at
a tall order and some pretty sky-high standards to live up to. We gulped. And
then we jumped at the chance.
Branding For Dummies is the first jargon-free, plain English, do-it-yourself
guide to branding we’ve seen, and we’ve looked high and low. True to the 
For Dummies philosophy, it deciphers the foreign language of branding with 
a lighthearted tone and easy-in, easy-out facts and tips. And it does all that
with a dose of humor, lots of examples, and a promise to enlighten anyone
interested in the topic without confounding or confusing the conversation.

Branding For Dummies 
Here’s our pledge: You don’t need an MBA or even a marketing or business
background to make sense of this book. All you need is an interest in the
topic of branding — a curiosity about what it is and how to do it. We take
care of the rest.
You probably already know that branding works. This book shows you how
to make it work for you.
Conventions Used in This Book
This book includes a few style conventions aimed at keeping the information
easy to read and understand. First, a few words on the language we use:
 When we say brand, we aren’t talking about side-of-the-steer ranch
brands. We’re talking about brands for businesses, organizations, con-
cepts, campaigns, and even individuals.
 Throughout this book we talk about brands and branding programs. To
synchronize our thinking with yours from the get-go, brand refers to the
set of characteristics that arise in a customer’s mind when that person
hears your name or sees your logo; branding program refers to the
process you follow to develop a clear brand image in your customer’s
mind. In other words, the brand is the destination you aim to arrive at;
the branding program is how you get there.
 To describe those who comprise your target market, we use the words
“customer” and “consumer.” They’re the people you’re seeking to influ-
ence with your branding program. For some readers, the audience is
comprised of retail clients. Others target online visitors, business
clients, wholesalers, or a combination of buyers. Those working to
brand nonprofit organizations or fundraising or political campaigns may
target voters, donors, subscribers, or members. Entrepreneurs gearing
up to start new businesses are probably seeking to build brands in the
minds of cutting-edge employees, venture capitalists, and early-adopter
customers. In this book, we use the words “customer” and “consumer”
to cover all bases.
To keep this book easy to scan and read (and to meet For Dummies branding
standards!), we incorporate the following style conventions:
 Anytime we introduce a new term you need to know, we italicize it.
 We bold key words and phrases in bulleted lists as well as the action
parts of numbered lists.
 Web site addresses appear in monofont to help you isolate the URL
quickly and easily from surrounding text.

What You’re Not to Read
If you have the time and inclination, by all means, read every precious word
in this book. We’d love nothing more!
However, if you’re a “Just the facts, ma’am” kind of person, you can skip the
gray-shaded sidebars, which contain information that complements but isn’t
essential to your understanding of the surrounding chapter content. The
sidebars are full of interesting approaches and examples that can help round
out your branding knowledge, but you can get by just fine without them.
Foolish Assumptions
First things first: Anyone smart enough to want to know more about branding
is no fool. Thanks for entrusting us with your interest. We’ve done back flips
to make sure that this book includes everything you need to know about
branding, all presented in plain English with easy-to-understand translations
for every technical term.
In writing this book, we made a few assumptions about you and the many
others we hope will use this book.
 You’re not a marketing professional — or if you are, you’re looking for a
branding refresher course that starts at ground level and builds topic
knowledge from there. To make this book useful to every reader, we gear
our explanations and advice to those who are charting new territory by
entering the branding arena.
 You’re interested in building or strengthening a brand — for your com-
pany, for a nonprofit organization, for your new business, for a campaign
(fundraising, political, social, you name it . . .), or for yourself by making
your name into a local personality or a small-scale celebrity. Regardless
of your branding objective, we’re guessing that you’re not expecting to
become the next Nike or Apple, but we think it’s a safe bet that you’d
like to acquire some of their branding strength. Who wouldn’t!
 You’re willing to invest effort to achieve the returns that result from a
good branding program. To help, we include worksheets, charts, and
sets of how-to instructions to guide the research, planning, positioning,
design, implementation, and management involved in fueling your suc-
cess with the power of a great brand.

Introduction

How This Book Is Organized
Each of the six parts of this book deals with a different phase of the branding
process: Getting familiar with the language and lay of the land, building your
brand from the ground up, launching your brand, putting your brand to work,
protecting your brand, and managing your brand with a little advice.
Part I: Everything You Ever Wanted 
to Know About Branding
Building a brand is a lot like building a house. You need to begin with a strong
foundation, and that’s what Part I delivers. Chapter 1 provides an overview of
how brands work and what it takes to build one. With Chapter 2, you move
into branding action, figuring out what kind of brand you want to build, how
your brand fits within your organization, when to start branding (the short
answer is, right now!), and what steps to follow. Chapter 3 helps you launch
your branding program by setting your branding goals, defining your brand
identity, earmarking the necessary funds, and assembling the team that will
turn your brand idea into reality.
Part II: Building a Brand, Step-by-Step
This part is your brand construction guide. It starts with Chapter 4, which
walks with you through the essential research phase of finding out who buys
your product and why, what competition you’re up against, how your offering
is different and better, and what distinguishing characteristics you should be
branding. Chapter 5 capitalizes on your research by helping you fill a unique
position in the marketplace — and in your consumers’ minds. In Chapter 6,
you get the formula for creating your brand definition and business promise,
and Chapter 7 helps you brainstorm, choose, adopt, and protect the name
for your brand. Finally, we wind this part up with an all-important chapter
(Chapter 8) that features Bill’s proven advice on developing your logo and
tagline — the face and slogan for your brand.
Part III: Launching Your New Brand
This part is all about putting your branding strategy to work. Here’s where
you get our best consulting advice. In Chapter 9, we help you craft, test, and
launch your brand marketing plan. Chapter 10 is all about spreading your
brand message through a public relations program, and Chapter 11 fuels your
4
Branding For Dummies 

program with ads that work, packaging that competes, and promotions that
drive results. Finally, Chapter 12 helps you move your brand online, with tips
on everything from building your Web site, integrating your image online and
offline, driving traffic to your site, and creating online relationships through
permission mailings and the marketing muscle of blogs and podcasts.
Part IV: The Care and Feeding 
of Your Brand
This part helps you reap the value of your brand. Chapter 13 tells you how to
build brand support from the inside-out, first by becoming your brand’s key
evangelist and then by creating a team of brand champions who take your
brand story on the road to business partners and customers. Chapter 14
offers the formula for keeping your brand true to its purpose and promise.
Chapter 15 helps you put a price on your brand and then leverage that value
through brand equity protection and development. Chapter 16 is a must-read
for anyone considering the opportunities (and seeking to avoid the land mines)
of subbranding, brand extensions, and brand partnerships. Chapter 17 winds
this part up with advice on how to monitor the strength of your brand, how
to fix a broken brand, and how to manage the brand revitalization or rebrand-
ing process.
Part V: Protecting Your Brand
This part contains only two chapters, but you can’t afford to skip either one.
Chapter 18 is all about protecting the legal right to your brand. Chapter 19 is
all about defending your brand from attacks, whether from innocent, zealous
designers who want to put their own marks on your image, from managers
with lofty but misguided ideas about brand-tainting “opportunities,” or from
natural or other disasters that shake the foundation of your brand and your
business.
Part VI: The Part of Tens
This final part sends you off with three ten-part lists of advice. Chapter 20
features ten laws of branding, Chapter 21 helps you avoid ten big branding
mistakes, and Chapter 22 presents snapshots of ten of the world’s most valu-
able brands.
And don’t miss the Appendix, which lists great branding resources to turn to
for additional information.

M
aybe you’re launching a new company or a new product, and you want
to establish a strong brand from the get-go. Or maybe you’ve been in
business for a while, and you’re getting ready to do some brand repair, brand
extensions, or rebranding.
Perhaps you’ve just joined the marketing team for an established business,
and you want to come up to speed — in a hurry — on the whole topic of
branding and how to do it best. Or, you may be among the many marketers
who aren’t quite sure whether or not you even have a brand, but you’re
pretty sure you need one, and you want to know which steps to take in order
to end up with the brand you set out to build.
No matter your starting point, if branding action is on your agenda, this 
chapter gets you going in the right direction. It provides an overview of the
reasons that brands matter, why you need one, and how building a brand
delivers value that far exceeds the time and effort you invest.
What Are Brands, Anyway?
Brands are promises that consumers believe in. Chapter 2 provides a com-
plete definition of brands and branding, but if you remember nothing more
than this three-word description — brands are promises — you’re well on
your way to branding success.

As you venture into the world of branding, keep these truths in mind:
 You establish your brand by building trust in a one-of-a-kind promise
about who you are, what you stand for, and what unique and mean-
ingful benefits you deliver.
 You build your brand by living up to your promise every single time
people come into contact with your name, your message, or your busi-
ness. It makes no difference whether that contact comes through adver-
tising, publicity, word of mouth, the buying experience, customer
service, billings, returns, or ongoing communication.
 You strengthen your brand by constantly reinforcing your brand
promise. If encounters with your brand are inconsistent or not in line
with what people expected they could count on, you essentially break
your promise, breaking your brand and risking your reputation and 
business as a result.
Building brands takes focus, passion, persistence, and diligence. Plus brand
building requires effort and money. The payoff, and it’s a big one, is that
strong brands build business and equity for their owners. The following sec-
tions shed light on what brands do and why they’re such a big deal.
What brands do
Brands create consumer trust and emotional attachments. As a result, they
foster relationships between consumers and products that withstand pricing
wars, transcend offers from new competitors, and even overcome rare lapses
in product or service excellence.
Great brands aren’t just known and trusted. They’re loved.
For examples of brands that enjoy strong bonds with customers, the next
time you’re stuck in traffic, look at the logos posted in the windows of the
cars around you. Each time you see a logo decal, try to think of that brand’s
chief competitor. Then ask yourself “What’s the chance that a buyer of the
competing brand would ‘wear’ the brand’s logo with such pride?” Only
brands that strike deep emotional chords with customers make their way
into hearts, minds, and car windows! Chapters 13 and 14 provide a playbook
on how to develop a contingent of brand enthusiasts inside and outside your
organization.
As you develop your brand and it gains strength and loyalty in your market
area, look forward to reaping the following benefits.

Part I: Everything You Ever Wanted to Know About Branding 

Brands make selling easier
Brands are a big business today because they make selling easier in person
and online. People prefer to buy from companies they feel they know and can
trust, and brands put forth that assurance.
Whether you’re selling products to consumers, investment opportunities to
stockholders, job opportunities to applicants, or ideas to constituents, a
brand paves the way for success by establishing awareness of your unique
and meaningful promise before you ever present your sales proposition.
When people are aware of your brand, they’re aware of the positive character-
istics you stand for. Long before they get ready to make a purchase, they feel
they know who you are and what unique value they can count on you to
deliver. As a result, when it comes time to make a sale, brand owners can con-
centrate on the wants and needs of the consumer rather than take up valuable
consumer time trying to explain themselves and their unique attributes.
Without a brand, you have to build a case for why you deserve the con-
sumer’s business every single time you get ready to make a sale. While brand
owners are closing the deal, those without strong brands are still introducing
themselves.
Imagine you’re setting out to buy a new laptop computer and you see one
emblazoned with a known logo — the face of a known brand. It’s likely that
your next step is to dive into a discussion with the salesperson of how much
memory the particular model you’re viewing contains, how the machine can
be customized to your needs, what software is included, and other details
that will move you to the purchase decision. On the other hand, if you see a
11
Chapter 1: Branding ABCs
Perception is everything
Many people think that the logo is the brand, but,
in fact, the logo is just one representation of the
brand. Your brand isn’t how you look or what you
say or even what you sell. Your brand is what
people believe you stand for. For example:
 Starbucks sells coffee. It stands for daily
inspiration.
 Apple sells computers. It stands for thinking
differently.
 Disney sells animated and amusement park
family entertainment. It stands for making
dreams come true.
Your brand lives in consumer minds, so branding
is the process of developing consumer beliefs
and perceptions that are accurate and in align-
ment with what you want your brand to be.

no-name model — even at a dramatically lower price — you’re likely to first
try to assess the quality of the manufacturer. You may ask the salesperson
where the computer was made, how long the manufacturer’s been in busi-
ness, whether the manufacturer is reliable, whether other customers have
been satisfied, and many other mind-calming questions about consumer sat-
isfaction levels, warranties, and return programs that you wouldn’t raise
when dealing with the known entity of an established brand.
Selling a no-name item takes time and patience. It’s a costly route to a sale in
a retail setting, and it’s nearly impossible online, where there’s no one stand-
ing by to offer explanations, inspire confidence, counter resistance, or break
down barriers for your consumers.
Brands trump commodities
In the marketplace, you have either a one-of-a-kind brand or a one-is-as-good-
as-any-other commodity. When it comes to creating a marketing success
story, there’s no question that brands fare better because
 Brands are products defined by and chosen for their unique distin-
guishing attributes. People buy brands because they relate to and trust
their distinctions and promises. Consumers are willing to spend extra
time and money in order to obtain the brands they believe in.
 Commodities are products that are easy to substitute and hard to dif-
ferentiate. Commodities are purchased simply because they serve a
purpose. Oil, coffee beans, wheat flour, and milk are all commodities.
Consumers buy commodities because they meet minimum standards
and are available when and where they’re needed and at the lowest
price.
Brands build equity
Brands that are preferred and valued by consumers deliver a long list of busi-
ness benefits that translate to higher sales, higher profit margins, and higher
owner value. Consider these brand advantages as proof:
 Consumers are willing to pay more to buy brands because they believe
that the brands deliver outstanding and desirable benefits.
 Consumers stay loyal to brands, buying them more often, in greater
volume, and without the need for promotional incentives.
 Retailers provide brands greater store visibility because they know that
brands drive sales and result in higher store revenues.
 Brand owners don’t need to launch new offerings from scratch. They can
grow their businesses by leveraging their brands into product and line
extensions.
12
Part I: Everything You Ever Wanted to Know About Branding 

 Brand owners find it easier to attract and retain good employees
because applicants believe in the quality of the workplace based on
advance knowledge of the caliber of the brand.
 Brand owners run more efficient operations because they align all deci-
sions with the mission, vision, and values that underpin the brand
promise.
 Brand owners benefit from increased market share, increased investor
support, and increased company value.
Why brands are a big deal
The list of reasons the word “branding” arises so often in today’s business 
conversations is long and growing. With more new businesses and products
than ever before, and with a competitive arena that — thanks to the Internet —
now stretches all the way around the world, brands are more necessary than
they’ve ever been before. Here are a few of the reasons why:
 Brands unlock profitability. Today’s marketplace is full of more prod-
ucts than ever before, and, overwhelmed by the selection, people
choose and pay premium prices only for products they’ve heard of,
trust, and believe deliver higher value than the others. If consumers
think all products in a category are virtually the same and no offering is
better or distinctly different from the others, they simply grab whichever
one is available at the lowest price. That’s a profit-squeezing reality that
brand marketers gratefully avoid.
 Brands prompt consumer selection. For the first time in shopping his-
tory, consumers can shop and buy without any geographic limitation.
The Internet and other at-home shopping options allow far-reaching
access to any product, anywhere. With a few clicks or keystrokes, con-
sumers find and select products with names they know and promises
they trust. In this boundless marketplace, brands rule and no-name
products barely survive.
 Brands build name awareness. For good reason, new businesses and
products increasingly go by invented names instead of by known words.
For one thing, more than three million U.S. trademarks are already regis-
tered, so any marketer who wants to protect a new name practically
needs to create a never-before seen word in order to succeed. For
another, 99 percent of all words in the English dictionary are already
reserved as Internet addresses and are therefore unavailable to new
marketers. As a result, most new offerings are launched under invented
names, and invented names require strong and diligent branding in
order to achieve consumer awareness, recall, and meaning. (Chapter 7
is full of advice for naming your brand.)
13
Chapter 1: Branding ABCs

 Brands increase the odds of business survival. New businesses and
new products are being launched at an unprecedented pace. According
to the UPC Database, nearly 100,000 new bar-coded products were intro-
duced in 2005 alone. Only those that ride into the market on the strength
of an established brand or those that are capable of building a brand
name in a hurry can seize consumer awareness, understanding, and
preference fast enough to survive.
Brands have been around for centuries, as the sidebar “The red-hot his-
tory of branding” explains. But they’ve never been more important — or
more essential to business success — than they are today.
Seeing the Big Branding Picture
Your brand is an image that makes its way into consumers’ minds to influ-
ence how they think and buy. It’s based on the promise people believe about
you and the reputation they link with your name as the result of all the times
and ways they’ve come into contact with you, your name, your logo, or any
aspect of your brand.
14
Part I: Everything You Ever Wanted to Know About Branding 
The red-hot history of branding
In spite of the fact that “branding” is the biggest
buzzword in today’s business world, most con-
sumers still link the concept back to the Old
West, where brand symbols were burned onto
the hides of steers and stallions in order to iden-
tify livestock that may have ventured off the
ranch or away from the herd.
In fact, the history of branding goes even farther
back in time.
In the medieval age, the marks of makers were
seared onto everything from loaves of bread to
gold and silver products in order to identify their
origins and integrity. Even ancient pottery bears
marks that resemble brands, causing archaeol-
ogists to believe that the concept of branding
goes back as far as 5,000 years.
In the 1800s, in addition to serving as identifica-
tion, brands began to take on a new and important
marketing role. It was during those days that man-
ufacturing breakthroughs led to mass production,
and with mass production came an unprece-
dented glut of products that vastly exceeded the
needs of any one local market area.
Manufacturers who were used to personally
presenting, explaining, and selling their goods
to friends and neighbors were suddenly ship-
ping their products off to fend for themselves in
distant locations. Realizing that their goods
were leaving home accompanied by little more
than their product labels, manufacturers began
efforts to build their names into brands that
stood for quality, distinction, and honesty.
In short order, the concepts of publicity and
advertising gained momentum as 19th-century
manufacturers worked to build name awareness,
product interest, trust, and purchase motivation.
Two centuries later, the purpose of branding
remains the same: To build, maintain, and pro-
tect a positive image, high awareness, and
product preference in consumers’ minds.

What’s involved?
Chapter 2 walks you through the steps involved to build a brand from the
essence of an idea to the esteem of a known and trusted offering. For a
glimpse of what’s involved and how branding is a never-ending cycle, look 
at Figure 1-1.
Branding is a circular process that involves these actions:
1. Product definition: You can brand products, services, businesses, even
people or personalities. But you can’t start the branding process with-
out first knowing what it is you’re trying to brand and whether your
brand will be a one-and-only or one of several in your organization.
Chapters 2 and 16 provide assistance with this beginning step.
2. Positioning: Each brand needs to fill a unique, meaningful, and available
spot in the marketplace and in the consumer’s mind. To determine your
product’s point of difference and the unique position it (and only it) fills
in the market, see Chapters 4 and 5.
3. Promise: The promise you make and keep is the backbone of your brand
and the basis of your reputation. Chapter 6 helps you put your promise
into words.

4. Presentation: How you present your brand can make or break your abil-
ity to develop consumer interest and credibility in your offering. Start
with a great name and logo (see Chapters 7 and 8), and then launch your
marketplace communications with professionally produced and com-
pelling packaging and communications. The chapters in Part III tell
when, where, and how to proceed as you send your brand message into
the marketplace.
5. Persistence: This is the point in the branding cycle where too many
brands lose steam. After brands are launched, brand owners often get
tired of their own looks and messages and begin to improvise with new
looks, new messages, and even new brand personalities and promises.
Just when consistency is most necessary in order to gain clarity and
confidence in the marketplace, brands that lack persistence go off track.
To save your brand from this pitfall, turn to Chapters 8 and 19 for help
writing and enforcing brand presentation and management rules.
6. Perception analysis: In a consumer’s mind — which is where brands live
and thrive — a brand is a set of beliefs about what a company offers,
promises, and stands for. Great brands continually monitor brand per-
ceptions to see that they’re in alignment with the brand owner’s aspira-
tions and in synch with consumer wants and needs. (Chapter 17
provides questionnaires and advice for conducting this assessment.)
Based on the results of perception analysis, brand owners begin their loop
around the branding cycle again, this time adjusting their products, fine-
tuning their positioning statements, strengthening their promises, updating
their presentations, rewriting their brand management rules, and once again
monitoring perceptions in order to guide ongoing brand realignments and
revitalizations.
Who’s involved?
Brands grow from the top down and from the inside out. What that means is
that your brand needs commitment from the highest levels of leadership and
support from employees in every department and at every point on the orga-
nizational chart.
Assembling your branding team
Whether you have a 1-person team or a 1,000-person team, every single
person in your organization has to be involved in building and maintaining
your brand. In order of who you bring on board first, here’s who to involve:
1. Organization leaders: Don’t try to build a brand without the leadership,
buy-in, and active participation of those whose names appear at the
very top of your organizational chart. Great brands are expressions of
the vision, mission, and core values established by leaders, and there-
fore leaders need to head up the branding effort.
16
Part I: Everything You Ever Wanted to Know About Branding 

2. Marketing and brand management team: This group takes on the day-
to-day responsibility for advancing, maintaining, protecting, and fine-
tuning the brand. As you name your team, name one person to serve as
your brand manager and chief brand protector. Be sure that this person
is a senior-level executive who has the authority and commands the
respect necessary to oversee what, in time, will become your organiza-
tion’s most valuable asset — your brand.
3. An organization-wide team of brand champions: Every person in your
organization serves as an expression and an ambassador of your brand.
If one person fails to uphold your brand promise — at any point from an
initial inquiry to a post-purchase product or service concern — the
strength of your brand is weakened. That’s why great brands begin with
internal launches that achieve team understanding and support (see
Chapter 9). They also include ongoing brand orientations and training
sessions to ensure flawless brand experiences (see Chapters 13 and 14).
Enlisting professional help
Brand development requires professional expertise and effort from those within
and outside your organization. One person — or even one outside firm —
can’t do it all. Pick and choose from the following professional resources:
 Brand consultants: These are firms that specialize in the soup-to-nuts
creation, building, and management of brands. They’re experienced in
everything from positioning to naming and trademarking to logo devel-
opment to launching brands internally and externally. If your organiza-
tion is seeking to build a brand that reaches into large markets or
competitive fields, the expertise of a brand consultant can be worth the
expense many times over.
 Public relations specialists: New brands are newsworthy if they’re pre-
sented with the right news hooks and angles. An experienced public
relations professional can help you get your story into circulation.
Depending on the size and ongoing nature of your needs, a public rela-
tions freelancer may be able to handle your task as a one-time assign-
ment. But if brand publicity is an ongoing objective, a public relations
firm with greater staff and media resources may be the way to go. (Flip
to Chapter 10 for more on public relations.)
 Logo designers: If you need help only with logo development or refinement,
hire a graphic designer with a great logo portfolio. Ask to see samples to be
sure that the caliber of design matches up with your expectations. Then use
the advice in Chapter 8 as you manage the logo-development process.
 Advertising agencies: Some ad agencies specialize in brand develop-
ment. Others focus on creation of print, broadcast, or interactive adver-
tising. Yet others are known for outstanding packaging development,
and even for their public relations departments. Whatever your needs,
be aware that professionally produced communications can make a big
difference in the strength of the brand image you transmit.

Chapter 1: Branding ABCs

Chapter 11 offers guidance as you determine your needs, locate the right
resources, conduct interviews, manage the selection process, and work with
the professionals you hire.
When interviewing professionals, ask to see case studies to determine whether
those you’re considering have the experience you seek. Many companies pre-
sent themselves as brand developers when, in fact, they handle only one aspect
of the branding process, such as logo development or brand advertising.
Gulp! How much does it cost?
Brand development budgets run the gamut depending on whether you’re
building a brand that will face only moderate competition in a small geo-
graphic region or a brand that aims to elbow out major competitors in
the global marketplace.
A glance at branding budgets
Table 1-1 shows a lineup of the major tasks involved in brand development
along with the range of price tags involved. Brace yourself: The high-end fig-
ures are apt to cause heart palpitations.

As Table 1-1 verifies, there’s a huge range between the low-end costs involved
to build a professional brand that competes on a local or regional basis and
the high-end costs involved in building a powerful brand that can flex its
muscle nationally or internationally.

Part I: Everything You Ever Wanted to Know About Branding 

As you reach for your calculator to start tallying up the costs to your busi-
ness, avoid the temptation to strike out certain line items that you think you
can handle on your own without incurring outside costs. Businesses that
start with do-it-yourself logos and presentation materials achieve false sav-
ings. They economize on the front end, for sure, but they also cost them-
selves the benefit of a strong, competitive, professional first impression.
If your goal is to build a brand that you can grow, leverage, and even sell in
the future, invest the money required to get off to a good start. By the time
you amortize your start-up expenses, the cost will be minimal in comparison
to the value received.
In lieu of big bucks . . .
In case you’re clinging to your billfold or balance sheet, shaking your head,
and wondering how you can build a brand on your kind of budget, remember
this truth: A well-defined and consistently delivered brand strategy can level
the playing field.
If you don’t have the budget to develop the most powerful brand identity,
triple or quadruple your efforts to design and deliver the most consistent
brand experience. Follow these suggestions:
 Spend extra time and effort to define your brand and what it stands
for so that you and all in your organization know exactly the promise
you’re making and keeping. Defining your brand involves creating your
mission and vision statements, defining your brand promise, developing
your brand definition and core brand message, and deciding on the
brand character or personality that you’ll put forth with every brand
communication. Chapter 6 covers these tasks.
 Develop a brand experience that never fails or fluctuates. If you can’t
have the most dazzling brand identity and presentation materials, aim
instead to have the most amazing and amazingly consistent brand
encounters. Chapter 14 helps you ensure brand contacts that never let
consumers down and never let them wonder what you stand for.
Pop Quiz: Are You Ready to Rev 
Up Your Branding Engine?
Is branding the right next step for your organization? If you answer “yes” to a
good many of the following questions, you have good reason to turn the page
and get started!
19
Chapter 1: Branding ABCs

 Are you launching a company or product that will benefit from a clear
identity and high awareness?
 Have you been in business for a while but feel you lack consumer aware-
ness and understanding about who you are and what you stand for?
 Do you sell your offerings online or over distances but feel that
prospects don’t know your name or the distinct benefits you offer?
 Do you feel that people in your own organization are unclear about how
to explain your offerings, your distinctions, your target market, and how
you excel over competitors?
 When you look at how your organization communicates through adver-
tising, marketing materials, personal presentations, and at each cus-
tomer contact point, do you see inconsistencies in the look, message,
and company personality being presented?
 Is the leader of your organization prepared to devote time, staff, energy,
and dollars to develop, launch, and grow a brand?
And the final question is “Can you think of even one reason why people
should choose your offering over competing solutions?” If your answer is a
resounding “yes,” ask yourself this follow-up question: “Do those in your
target market clearly understand the distinct benefits you provide?” If not,
turn the page and start building your brand!

When and How to Brand
In This Chapter
 Branding products, businesses, services, and even yourself
 Following the branding process, step-by-step
 Seizing the best moment to brand or rebrand
T
he short answer to the question of when and how to brand is this: Brand
when you’re ready to make a promise to customers, and brand by making
a promise that you’re absolutely, positively certain you can keep.
A brand, in essence, is a promise about who you are and what benefits you
deliver that gets reinforced every single time people come in contact with
any facet of you or your business.
Branding isn’t a veneer that you slap on (usually in the form of a new logo) to
mask or transform a product offering. Treating branding like some skin-deep
solution to your business’s problems is like putting lipstick on a pig: People
see through the makeup, no matter how thick the application. Branding has
to go all the way to the core of who you are and what you stand for.
Count on this chapter to lead you into the branding process, starting with a
good overview of branding definitions and terminology. Then we move into a
look at all the things you can brand and a lineup of the moments when brand-
ing is most essential and beneficial to your business and marketing success.
Branding Demystified
The $64,000 question among those breaking ground in the world of branding
is, “So what is branding, anyway?” In a sentence, branding is the process of
building a positive collection of perceptions in your customers’ minds.

22
Part I: Everything You Ever Wanted to Know About Branding 
When people encounter your business’s name, they automatically conjure up
impressions and memories that determine what they believe about you.
Their notions may be the result of communications you’ve had with cus-
tomers, or they may be the result of good or bad publicity or word-of-mouth.
Your customers may have a deep well of perceptions about you, or your slate
may be nearly clear of any impressions whatsoever.
Regardless of whether the beliefs a customer holds about you are many or
few, good or bad, or accurate or inaccurate, they comprise the image of your
brand in your customer’s mind — and they influence how your customer
thinks and buys.
Your brand image lives in your customers’ minds whether you intentionally
put it there or not. Branding is the route to making sure that the brand image
you have is the brand image you want.
Translating branding lingo
Branding terminology is a language unto itself. To get a feel for the complexi-
ties, just type “branding terms” into your favorite Internet search engine. We
did that recently and got a whopping 12 million results! Assuming that you’d
rather focus on key phrases instead of the full foreign language of branding,
check out this need-to-know list of terms:
 Brand: A promise about who you are and what benefits you deliver that
gets reinforced every time people come in contact with any facet of you
or your business
 Brand identity: The marks that visually present your brand, usually in
the form of a logo, symbol, or a unique typestyle
 Brand image: The set of beliefs about what your brand is and what it
stands for that exists in the customer’s mind as a result of associations
with you and your name
 Branding: The process of building a positive collection of perceptions in
your customer’s mind
 Brand position: How your brand fits in with and relates to various other
brands within your competitive market
 Brand management: Controlling the presentation of your brand identity
and brand message across your entire organization and through all
media and communication outlets
 Brand equity: The value of your brand as an asset, based on its quali-
ties, reputation, and recognition as well as the commitment and demand
it generates. A valuable brand results in customer relationships that
secure future earnings by developing brand passion and loyalty.

Don’t get overwhelmed when you hear people talk about brand message,
brand promise, brand mission, brand strategy, brand extension, brand revi-
talization, rebranding, and a mind-boggling array of other brand terms.
Armed with an understanding of the terms in this section, you can navigate
branding conversations just fine. Throughout this book, we introduce other
terms as you need to know them for specific branding situations.
Branding’s essential ingredient
Originally we titled this section “Branding’s Essential Ingredients.” Lucky for
you, we changed the plural to a singular. Brands are built around four funda-
mentals: product differentiation, relevance, esteem, and knowledge. But the
magic ingredient that converts those fundamentals into a branding success
story is consistency. If you bring consistency to your branding program, you
end up with a brand that stands head and shoulders (no branding pun
intended) above the others.
If you know what you stand for and project messages to your target market
that constantly reinforce how your offering is different and relevant, you
build knowledge and, eventually, esteem. As a result of your consistency, you
win out over businesses that shift with the wind, regardless of how beauti-
fully they’ve polished their identities or their marketing materials. In brand-
ing, consistency is more important than level of execution.
We’ve seen too many companies develop award-winning logos and impressive
brand launch materials only to have their brand images go sideways when the
customer has an actual brand experience. Remember the lipstick-on-a-pig anal-
ogy from this chapter’s introduction: False promises don’t work. Your brand
must honestly express who you are and who you aspire to be every time the
customer encounters you, your staff, your offices, your Web site, your customer
service, your product, your marketing communications, your news coverage,
and every other impression that you or others make on behalf of your brand.
Turn to Chapter 6 for assistance as you define your brand and put your
desired brand identity into words you can live up to. Then turn to Chapter 14
for help pledging allegiance to your brand through a brand management pro-
gram that ensures consistent presentation of your brand through every
single customer encounter.
To Brand or Not to Brand
That is the question. Well, that’s the question that hangs in the air until
people hear this truth: If you can think of even one reason why customers
should choose your offering over all the others, then you have at least one
reason to brand it.
23
Chapter 2: When and How to Brand

Whether you’re marketing a product, service business, large company or cor-
poration, or even yourself, the same branding process applies and the same
branding benefits accrue.
Products
Products are tangible, physical items that you can hold in your hands or see
with your own eyes before you make the purchase. Products fall into two 
categories:
 Commodities are products that customers can’t differentiate from one
another because they all seem to serve the same need, solve the same
problem, and deliver the same value.
If people can’t see a clear reason to buy one product over another — if they
think that all available products deliver the same value and quality — they
buy whatever’s available at the lowest price, which is hardly a formula
for business success.
 Branded products are the opposite of commodities. Commodity products
become branded products, usually known as consumer brands, when a
manufacturer wins awareness in the marketplace that its product has
compelling characteristics that make it different and better than others
in the product category. Branding is a powerful tool that differentiates
your offering in ways that create consumer preference and allow you to
command premium pricing.
Airline tickets, desktop computers, and strawberry jam are all commodities.
Until you read the name on the boarding pass, hard drive, or jelly jar, all com-
petitors serve basically the same need in the same way. Yet customers make
a conscious decision to choose one company’s offerings over the others
because of what they believe and trust to be true about their product of
choice. Maybe they’re won over by the frequent flyer club options, service or
warranty program, promise of organic ingredients, or any of a zillion other
distinguishing attributes.
The minute a marketer gets customers to believe “our product is different
and better, and here’s why,” the marketer turns a commodity into a brand —
and a better chance for sales success.
Want proof? Consider salt. Good old salt was the epitome of a commodity
until 1914, when Morton promised that its product would run freely even in
damp weather. With the slogan “When it rains, it pours,” Morton launched a
brand and a branding success story that spices up university marketing
course lectures to this day.

For more proof that you can brand and differentiate nearly any product, look
at the following examples of consumer brands that have distinguished them-
selves as leading choices in their product categories.

Consumer Brand
Soft drinks
Coca-Cola
Water
Evian
Sneakers
Nike
Computers

Always brand your product if you want it to be noticed, differentiated, and
viewed as more than a commodity.

Chapter 2: When and How to Brand
Product marketing success hangs on a brand
Consider this true commodity-to-brand success
story from a Miami, Florida-based manufacturer
that worked with coauthor Bill’s company,
Brand Navigation, and William Berenson Brand
Architects (which is owned by this book’s
invaluable technical editor) to help it brand
hangers. You read that right: Branded hangers.
The Great American Hanger Company turned
the functional, ubiquitous item that holds
clothes in a closet into a differentiated lifestyle
product of choice. Business publications took
note of the company’s success, and CEO Devon
Rifkin understated the effort when he said, “No
one has ever created a hanger brand.” But he
didn’t let that stop him.
By promising “hanger solutions of extraordinary
craftsmanship, unparalleled customer service,
and timeless innovations” — including logo-
emblazoned hangers, hangers covered in cus-
tomized fabrics, and even hangers sized to the
one-of-a-kind shoulder widths of guys like
Shaquille O’Neal — The Great American
Hanger Company carved a niche in a field pre-
viously crowded by dime-a-dozen hangers that
most people pick up for free at the dry-cleaners.
The result: 838 percent growth over three years;
2004 revenues in excess of $5 million; profiles in
dozens of business and fashion publications;
orders from hotels, cruise lines, restaurants, air-
lines, celebrities, and fashion designers; and the
delivery of 10,000 hangers — the largest order
ever received — to drape the wardrobe of pop
diva Jennifer Lopez.

When you turn your product into a consumer brand you build perceived
value, consumer trust, buyer preference, and the potential for higher profit
margins. See the sidebar “Product marketing success hangs on a brand” for a
great commodity-to-brand case study.
Service businesses
Services are products that people buy sight-unseen. Unlike tangible, three-
dimensional products that shoppers can see and feel and try out before
buying, people buy services purely based on their trust that the person or
business they’re buying from will deliver as promised.
When service is your offering, customers buy your brand. They buy into and
trust your promise of superb service.
If you sell a service or run a service business, you absolutely, positively need to
develop and manage a strong, positive brand image for the following reasons:
 People buy your service based entirely on their belief in your brand
promise. People need to have faith in you, your ability, and your reputa-
tion before they decide to commit their business.
 Before signing on the dotted line to purchase a service, customers
need to believe that their expectations will be met. If they know noth-
ing about you or lack confidence in the quality of your service, they take
their business elsewhere.
Examples of globally recognized service brands include Google, eBay, H&R
Block, Charles Schwab, Merrill Lynch, and FedEx. For examples of local-level
service brands, think of your region’s leading law firm, best hair salon, most
innovative homebuilder, or most trusted medical clinic. Each earned its repu-
tation by building a clear identity and consistently conveying a believable
promise that consumers trust in while they wait for the purchased service to
be performed and their high expectations to be met.
Business brands
Many larger companies and corporations brand their businesses in addition
to or instead of branding their products.
Procter & Gamble, for example, has built an overall corporate brand in addi-
tion to one of the largest portfolios of consumer brands in the world. Another
example — on a smaller level and closer-to-home — is a land developer that
builds brands for each new homeowner community in addition to a brand for
the land development company that holds the individual brands.

Amazon.com: Branding service with a smile
Amazon.com has trained e-shoppers to believe
that when they hit “proceed to checkout,” they
can count on consistently friendly and reliable
delivery, service, and customer support.
Amazon has built one of the world’s leading ser-
vice brands, identified by a visual symbol — the
Amazon logo, which we show here — that was
updated in 2000 to more fully reflect the com-
pany’s A-to-Z service commitment.
Founder and CEO Jeff Bezos explained the new
logo in a company news release: “To reflect
Amazon’s brand and its relationship with its more
than 16 million customers better; the familiar logo
was changed to communicate the company’s
mission of being the most customer-centric com-
pany in the world, most notably by depicting the
ultimate expression of customer satisfaction: a
smile.”
Some of the millions of Amazon.com devotees
add yet more symbolism to the logo: They say it
reflects the genial expression of the company’s
most visible personality, the always-smiling
company founder.

If you can only build one brand — and that’s the advice we give to any busi-
ness that’s short on marketing expertise or dollars — make it a business
brand because business brands
 Lead to corporate or company awareness, credibility, and good 
reputations
 Pave a smooth road for new product introductions
 Inspire employees
 Attract the interest of job applicants, investors, and business reporters
 Contribute to customer preference, which means that people not only
want to buy from your business but also often are willing to pay more
for the association with a leading company held in high esteem
Individuals (namely, yourself)
Individual brands come in two types: personal brands and personality
brands.
Personal brands
Personal brands reflect personal reputations. They differentiate individuals by
creating awareness of who they are, what they stand for, what they do best,
and how they contribute to the world around them.
Whether you know it or not, you have a personal brand. If people know your
name or recognize your face, they hold your brand image in their minds. As
proof, say the name of someone you know and pay attention to the thoughts
that pop into your mind. The set of memories that arise comprise your brand
image of that person. The person you’re thinking of may have some lofty title,
but if the first thing that comes to mind is “She’s always late,” then being late
is an important part of her brand. On the more positive side, if you think
“Everything she touches turns to gold,” then success is a major part of the
person’s brand.
By developing a personal brand, you can
 Establish yourself as an expert in your field
 Enhance your visibility and reputation within your community or industry
 Differentiate yourself from competitors based upon your unique style
and talents
 Gain influence in social or business arenas
28
Part I: Everything You Ever Wanted to Know About Branding 

Personality brands
Personality brands are personal brands gone big-time. They’re individual
brands that are so large and strong that they not only deliver wide-reaching
personal celebrity but also create significant value when associated with
products or services.
Oprah is a personality brand. So are Martha Stewart, Tiger Woods, Michael
Jordan, George Foreman, Paul Newman, Jennifer Lopez, and Donald Trump,
to name a few.
People who develop personality brands often use their visibility to present or
endorse products, quickly increasing product visibility, sales, and brand
equity as a result of association with the celebrity’s name. The connections
between personality brands and product brands break down as follows:
 Some personality brands grow out of product brands. For example, the
late Dave Thomas became a personality brand as a result of the Wendy’s
brand marketing campaign. He then leveraged his personality brand to
create attention for his Foundation for Adoption.
 Some product brands grow out of personality brands. For example,
Newman’s Own grew out of the personality brand of Paul Newman, the
George Foreman Grill gained product notoriety as a result of the person-
ality brand of George Foreman, and almost every celebrity sports brand
grew out of the strong personality brand of an athletic superstar.
 Some product brands spawn personality brands, which go on to
spawn product brands. For example, Walt Disney Studios and
Disneyland led to the globally recognized Walt Disney personality brand,
which is being brought back to shine over new lines of Disney products,
subbrands, and services.
Obviously, only the most visible personalities can turn their names into
megasized personality brands, but that doesn’t mean that personality brands
are exclusively for the big guys. Many community leaders become local per-
sonalities whose endorsements of projects or fundraising campaigns, for
example, turn otherwise obscure efforts into overnight successes.
If you aspire to become a leader in your community or industry, keep that
goal in mind as you build your personal brand. Develop a personal reputation
that you can leverage into a greater good by becoming a small-scale personal-
ity brand in your own backyard or business arena.

Chapter 2: When and How to Brand

A Bird’s-eye View of the 
Branding Process
When it comes to branding, you should know what you’re getting into before
you really buckle down and get started. This section gives you a helicopter
view of the branding process you’re getting ready to launch; we feature the
major steps involved and tell you where to turn in the upcoming chapters for
step-by-step branding advice.
If you’re a visual person, Figure 2-1 lays out the branding process in a clear,
easy-to-follow manner.
Step 1: Decide what you’re going to brand
Are you branding a product, a service, a company, or an individual? If the dis-
tinctions are a bit blurry, flip back to the section “To Brand or Not to Brand”
earlier in this chapter.
In addition to deciding what you’re going to brand, you need to decide if the
brand you’re developing will be your one-and-only brand or if it will live
alongside or under the umbrella of other brands in your organization.
Brand architecture 101
The relationship between your business and your brand is called brand archi-
tecture. In the same way that building architecture makes all the rooms of a
structure work together, brand architecture neatly packages the segments of
your company into a single, understandable entity. Most brands qualify as
one of three types of brand architecture.

 Parent-dominant brands: Businesses that follow this form of brand
architecture introduce each new product brand under the strong busi-
ness brand identity of the parent organization. General Electric (GE) is a
great example of a parent-dominant brand. Whether you buy a GE refrig-
erator, range, microwave, or washing machine, you’re buying the
General Electric brand. Under that brand, you can choose from the GE
Monogram or the GE Profile line, but you always know you’re buying GE
because the parent brand dominates all its offerings.
Adopt a parent-dominant branding strategy if any of the following situa-
tions apply to your business:
• Your company has a modest marketing department and budget. If
your resources are limited, build one strong parent brand to repre-
sent your core business and then introduce each new offering
under the umbrella of your business identity. By doing so, you
eliminate the need to create and manage the identity of multiple
self-standing brands, which requires an intense investment of time,
people, discipline, and dollars.
• All your products support a single business brand image and
promise. For example, if your business brand issues a promise to
deliver top-tier quality to the most discerning customers, you can’t
introduce a product that serves the bargain-basement market.
• You want to heighten the value of your business brand as part of a
long-term plan to prepare your business for growth or sale. Parent-
dominant products enhance the equity of the parent brand.
 Parent-endorsed brands: These brands enter the marketplace as their
own brands but have the strong and visible endorsement of their parent
organizations. For example, iPod is a parent-endorsed brand, as is
Macintosh. Both enter the market carrying the strong, visible Apple
logo, but the only name you see is the name of the brand you’re buying
at the moment: iPod or Mac. The brand emphasis is on the product, but
the company brand adds instant credibility.
Consider a parent-endorsed branding strategy if any of the following sit-
uations apply to your business:
• You have the staff and financial resources to build a number of
brands — one for your business and one for each product.
• You want to build strong visibility and equity for each individual
brand, perhaps with a mid- or long-term goal of spinning off and
selling the endorsed brand.
• You want to appeal to new target audiences whose interests may
be easier to reach with a new brand than with the identity of your
parent brand.
31
Chapter 2: When and How to Brand

• You compete in an arena, such as the car industry, where all other
businesses brand each line. In such cases, in order to achieve com-
parable visibility and esteem for your product lines, you may need
to replicate the strategy of your competitors and introduce each
line as a parent-endorsed brand.
 Parent-silent brands: These brands are owned by their parent compa-
nies but stand entirely on their own in the marketplace. For example,
Crest, Folgers, Head & Shoulders, Oil of Olay, Pampers, and Pringles are
consumer brands owned by Procter & Gamble, yet the parent company
is virtually invisible as each brand is presented to consumers.
Building parent-silent brands is the most costly branding strategy of all.
You need to build a strong, stand-alone brand for each and every prod-
uct, plus you need to build a corporate or business brand that can carry
its weight in the financial and corporate worlds and serve as a magic
carpet for each new brand to ride in on until it establishes itself as a
seemingly independent entity in the marketplace.
Unless you’re a megamarketer with deep pockets, your brand will probably fall
under the parent-dominant or parent-endorsed category unless — borrowing
from the family tree language — it’s an “only child” because you wisely follow
the Rule of One explained in the next section.
Following the Rule of One
Unless you have a deep reservoir of staff, expertise, and marketing dollars,
heed the branding Rule of One: Build one brand for your business rather than
one business full of many brands. Introduce each new product or service as
an offering under your business brand.
If you choose to brand separate products or services, build a separate busi-
ness unit for each new brand. That way, each offering stands on its own,
drawing on its own resources and building independent value that can con-
tribute to your business brand equity or that you can spin off or sell in the
future.
Step 2: Do your research
When you’re clear about what you’re branding, the next step is to analyze
your offering and the market in which it will compete. Think of this as your
discovery phase, which is comprised of two major steps:
1. Find out everything there is to know about your market.
Begin by researching your prospective customers — who they are, where
they are, and what motivates their buying decisions. Then analyze your
competition to discover what solutions already exist in the marketplace
and exactly how the offering you’re branding is different and better.
32
Part I: Everything You Ever Wanted to Know About Branding 

2. Find out everything there is to know about your product or service.
You need to know what makes your offering unique, what attributes
make it excel over competing alternatives, and how it solves your cus-
tomers’ wants or needs.
Flip to Chapter 4 as you embark on this fact-finding mission. Along with
advice on how to proceed, that chapter has forms and questionnaires to use
as you gather information about your brand offering and the market in which
it will compete.
Step 3: Position your product or service
Positioning is how you find and win a place for your offering in the market-
place and in consumers’ minds.
Consumers are so overwhelmed with product choices and marketing mes-
sages that they take in messages that seem distinctly meaningful. They make
mind space only for products or services that provide unique solutions
to problems or needs that aren’t already being addressed by competing 
products.
To determine your market position, follow these four steps:
1. Determine which distinct and meaningful consumer needs or desires
only your product or service addresses in the marketplace.
2. Communicate your point of difference.
3. Win a unique position for your offering in the market and in the con-
sumer’s mind.
4. Perform so well that no competitor can compete against or unseat
your position.
Positioning precedes brand development. It defines how you’ll differentiate
your offering and slot it into an available space in the market and in your cus-
tomers’ minds.
Chapter 5 takes you on a step-by-step walk through the positioning process,
including how to determine your market position, how to communicate your
position, how to win your position in your consumers’ minds, and how to
protect your position so that your brand can claim and own a defined niche
in which to live and grow.
33
Chapter 2: When and How to Brand

Step 4: Write your brand definition
Your brand definition is a true statement about what your brand stands for. It
describes what you offer, why you offer it, how your offering is different and
better, what unique benefits your customers can count on, and what promise
or set of promises you make to all who work with and buy from your business.
You have to know your brand definition before you begin to create materials
that will become the public presentation of your brand in the marketplace.
Otherwise the face of your brand doesn’t match up with the base of your
brand, and your brand communications lack credibility.
Figure 2-2 shows the relationship between
 The base of your brand: The culture, mission, vision, values, leadership,
management, and organization that together create what your brand
stands for
 The face of your brand: The part of your brand that rises into public
view and translates the vast reality of your brand into a name, symbol,
and message that employees, consumers, and colleagues can quickly
and easily see, understand and believe

34
Part I: Everything You Ever Wanted to Know About Branding 

The face of your brand has to sit firmly upon the strong base formed by your
company mission, vision, and commitment to the promise you represent
through your brand marketing.
As you get ready to define your brand, turn to Chapter 6 for help with every
step involved.
Step 5: Develop your name, 
logo, and tagline
This is the point where branding gets exciting. The minute you give your
brand a name and face — or logo — you can watch managers, employees,
and others inside the company start to buy into the branding process. Here’s
a brief introduction to these important brand elements:
 Name: Your name is the key that unlocks your brand image in your con-
sumer’s mind. Turn to Chapter 7 for help creating your brand name,
including advice for how to recognize qualities of a great name, pick or
create your name, test the appropriateness and availability of the name
you want, and turn the name you choose into a vehicle that conveys
your brand promise and builds value for the brand it represents.
 Logo: Your logo is the brandmark or symbol that serves as the face of
your brand on your signage, packaging, stationery, advertising, sales lit-
erature, and every other physical communication vehicle that carries
your name into the marketplace. Coauthor Bill is the guru on this sub-
ject, and he’s filled Chapter 8 with information on how to develop a
great logo, avoid logo design taboos, apply your logo with consistency
throughout your marketing program, and manage your logo so that no
one tampers with or misrepresents its design.
 Tagline: Your tagline is the memorable phrase that provides consumers
with a quick indication of your product, brand, and market position.
Some marketers make their taglines an essential part of their identities,
whereas other marketers don’t create taglines at all. Taglines are partic-
ularly useful, though, for companies whose names or logos don’t clearly
convey the company position or personality and for businesses that rely
heavily on e-mail or other communications in which logo presentation
isn’t possible. See Chapter 8 for help deciding whether or not your mar-
keting would benefit from a tagline and, if so, how to create one for your
brand.
35
Chapter 2: When and How to Brand

Step 6: Launch your brand
Your brand launch happens in two phases, which take place in the following
order:
1. Internal launch
Before you even think of introducing your brand to prospects, explain it
to all who have or feel that they have a stake in your business, including:
• Shareholders, managers, and employees: These are the people
most invested in your business and most apt to serve as ambas-
sadors for your brand. Be ready to answer questions like “Why are
we spending money on this?” and “How will this strengthen our
business?” by linking your branding program to your business mis-
sion and goals. And by all means, take extra care with those who
sell your product, providing them with a complete set of tools to
help them present your brand position and story to prospects and
customers (turn to Chapter 9 for advice).
• Key business partners and major customers: These are people
who have bought into your business as loyal advisors, supporters,
and clients. Before they see your new brand on packaging or in
ads, give them a preview. Chapter 9 helps you plan your approach.
2. External launch
Your brand goes public when you unveil your name, logo, and slogan,
and when you begin to tell your market the story of how your brand
reflects what you stand for. Coauthor Barbara’s the marketing guru on
our author team, and she’s designed Part III to guide you as you write
the marketing plan for your launch and create the advertising, publicity-
generation tools, sales materials, and online program that carry the
announcement of your new brand into your marketplace.
Step 7: Manage, leverage, 
and protect your brand
This is the “care and feeding” phase of the branding process; it’s the step that
leads to a strong, healthy, resilient brand. Just like good parenting, good
branding management can be summed up in a single word — consistency.
 Display a consistent look.
 Project a consistent tone.
 Deliver a consistent level of quality, demonstrated through consistent
communications and consistent products and services.
 Be consistently true to your brand.
36
Part I: Everything You Ever Wanted to Know About Branding 

Consistency builds good brands. If you mess around with your brand, you
destroy its strength.
Begin managing your brand from the moment you announce your name
because
 The minute your name or news of your offering goes into the market-
place, you begin making first impressions of your brand, whether they’re
the ones you intend to make or not.
 By understanding your brand definition and market position, you can
project messages that build accurate perceptions from the get-go.
 By etching your brand onto a blank slate in the marketplace, you don’t
have to undertake the difficult task of erasing erroneous impressions
and rewriting your brand image.
The chapters in Part IV help you stick to your guns. They’re packed with
information for keeping a tight rein on your brand, creating brand allegiance,
leveraging value, and, when the time’s right, revitalizing your brand to fit
changing market or business conditions.
The chapters in Part V focus on how to protect your brand by establishing
and standing up for your legal rights. They also help you create usage rules
that protect your brand from well-meaning but misguided attempts by staff
members, freelancers, printers, sign makers, and others who are all too will-
ing to help you “refine” or “tweak” your brand image, which usually leads
directly to an erosion of the consistency you’re fighting to maintain.
Step 8: Realign your brand 
to keep it current
When you hear people talking about the need to redo their (or your) brand,
don’t listen in on the conversation, and don’t use them as your branding
gurus. For as long as your brand exists, it’s your brand. It’s the promise you
made yesterday and the promise you’ll make tomorrow. It’s the essence of
what your business stands for and the esteem it has built among all its 
stakeholders.
You can’t just change essence; you can’t just change your brand. What you
can (and should) be willing to change is how your brand is presented. From
time to time, you need to update your brand presentation (the face of your
brand) to keep it relevant to the market in which it lives. Face it, market
trends change. Purchase behaviors change (think of how the Internet turned
37
Chapter 2: When and How to Brand

how people buy upside down). Design looks or cultural aesthetics change.
When they do, you need to realign your brand by updating its look and mes-
sage but not by changing the promise you make.
Only on rare occasions do companies need to rebrand, which involves aban-
doning the essence of what they stand for and starting from scratch to build
a brand new brand. This rare move is discussed in Chapter 17.
Here are a few examples of brand realignment:
 Coke changed its tagline from “The Real Thing” to just “Real” to sound
more culturally relevant. It’s the same message, but it has a realigned
presentation.
 AT&T slightly evolved the look of the symbol and typeface it uses as its
logo in order to appear lighter and more nimble following a merger with
SBC.
 British Petroleum changed the definition of BP to “Beyond Petroleum” to
address the market’s growing environmental concerns.
None of these companies threw away their brands and started from scratch.
They did what you should do when and if your brand presentation starts to
get a little out of step with its market: Keep all the esteem you built through
the first seven steps of the brand development process, and then protect
your image with a regular assessment of whether it needs a slight realign-
ment to match the market’s evolving interests.
When to Brand
The following sections spotlight the major times that businesses launch or
polish brands, along with advice for how to proceed and what to expect in
each case.
Opening a new business
When you open a business, be ready to project your brand image from the
first second that you throw open the company doors, hook up the phone
lines, or launch your Web site.
While you’re writing your business plan (if that term just threw you into a
panic, run — don’t walk — to get a copy of Business Plans Kit For Dummies,
2nd Edition, by Steven Peterson, Peter E. Jaret, and Barbara Findlay Schenck
[Wiley]), write the plan for branding your business. Be sure to take into
account the following advice as you do so:
38
Part I: Everything You Ever Wanted to Know About Branding 

 Follow the first seven steps in the branding process outlined in the pre-
ceding section of this chapter and detailed throughout this book.
 Take special care to figure out and understand exactly how you intend
to position your business within the competitive landscape so that
you provide a unique and valuable offering in an already crowded 
marketplace.
 Create all the primary branding tools before you ever open for business,
including your name, brandmark or logo, stationery, Web site, sales
material, and presentation tools to help you introduce your business
and present your brand to funding partners, prospective employees,
business partners, and new customers.
Introducing a new product
When you introduce a new product, you have to decide whether the product
you’re introducing will enter the market under your business brand or as its own
brand, with or without a visible link to your business brand. (For more on this
decision, refer to the section “Brand architecture 101” earlier in this chapter.)
If you decide to introduce your new product as a new brand, you need to
follow every single one of the seven steps in the branding process, giving 
special consideration to the Step 2 discovery phase. You must do all the
research and analysis necessary to determine your product position, point of
difference, and marketing approach.
If you have an existing brand, seriously consider how you may fit your new
product under your existing brand. Doing so allows you to leverage your new
product introduction off of the visibility and value that your current brand
already enjoys in the marketplace.
If you decide to introduce your new product as an offering under your estab-
lished business brand, you need to take a few steps to ensure that your new
product not only benefits from but also provides benefit to your business
brand. Ask yourself these questions:
 Does the new product support and extend your established brand image?
 Have you done a careful competitive analysis to be sure that your new
offering is distinctively different and better than existing products and
that it will contribute to rather than weaken your brand image in your
marketplace?
 Have you developed a product name and logo that fits within the frame-
work of your business brand?
 Have you created product advertising and sales materials that conform
to your business brand image and graphic identity?
39
Chapter 2: When and How to Brand

The Rule of One is worth repeating here: Unless your business has strong
marketing expertise and a well-funded marketing budget, limit the number of
brands you build to one, and introduce all new products under that strong,
single brand. The price of getting too ambitious is building no brand well and
gaining little if any brand presence in your marketplace.
Fundraising for a nonprofit
Successful fundraising campaigns operate under the auspices of well-known,
well-regarded, well-branded organizations. Before your organization launches a
fundraising campaign, establish credibility and trust by first building a brand
image for your organization that prospective donors know and believe in.
To build a brand image for your organization, follow these steps:
1. Follow the brand building steps outlined earlier in this chapter to
create awareness of your organization’s overall mission, vision, and
values and to build trust in your track record for leveraging donated
dollars into good works.
2. Build a strong and emotional story for the new cause you’re seeking
to fund.
3. Introduce your campaign to the public, tying it to your overall mission
and vision and leveraging the value and power of your organizational
brand on behalf of your new fundraising program.
Taking your business public
Don’t even consider launching an initial public offering, or IPO, until you have
a well-established and well-regarded brand. Investors direct dollars into busi-
nesses that they trust to be well-led, innovative, successful, and capable of
rising to even higher levels of growth and profitability.
For proof that the sequence of branding before going public works, consider
Google and Microsoft. By the time company shares were finally made avail-
able, investors were fighting over them because the brands were so strong
and well-established.
Going global
Some businesses want to sell in international markets. Others want to estab-
lish themselves as global companies with operating presences in a range of
countries. Either way, if your brand is going to travel, it had better be up to
the task. Before your company crosses international borders, take these steps:
40
Part I: Everything You Ever Wanted to Know About Branding 

 Create or realign your brand to fit the realities of the cultures it will
enter. Be sure that your name translates favorably, that the colors and
shapes in your logo create positive impressions in the new environment,
and that your brand messages are consistent with the culture of your
new market. (Chapter 17 can help you make these adjustments to your
brand.)
 Plan, budget for, and launch a strong brand introduction in each new
country or market area. Gaining market share in a foreign market is a
big task that begins with gaining name familiarity and belief in your busi-
ness. Gaining brand awareness is an essential first step toward success.
Make it your aim to quickly achieve the reputation of a trusted business
with whom those in your new market want to work. (Chapter 9 offers
plenty of advice for accomplishing this step.)
Raising venture capital
Venture capitalists are investors who look to invest in companies with strong
leadership, strong business concepts, and strong positions in growing market
arenas.
Don’t even think of approaching venture capitalists until you have
 Clearly defined technology and products
 A business model capable of delivering predictable streams of revenue
 A management team with proven capability that’s relevant to the size
and kind of businesses you’re trying to fund
 The ability to personally represent your brand by making an impeccable
first impression
41
Chapter 2: When and How to Brand
A brand is stronger than a giving request
Since 1881, the American Red Cross has won
awareness and trust as the nation’s premier
emergency response organization, branding
itself with the slogan “Together, we can save a
life.” When a humanitarian crisis hits, the Red
Cross is the first name that comes to the minds
of those who want to help. Its strong brand pre-
cedes its giving request.
When the Gulf Coast was ravaged by Hurricane
Katrina in 2005, the Red Cross moved quickly to
launch relief efforts. Within hours of the disaster,
public service announcements aired nationally
on television, with Aaron Neville’s voice
announcing that “Hope is stronger than a hurri-
cane” accompanied by the dominant logo of the
Red Cross. Within weeks, the giving public’s
emotional connection and strong belief in the
Red Cross resulted in contribution pledges that
exceeded $1.25 billion.

Use your business plan — the prerequisite to every venture capital request —
to present your business and explain your brand. But also be prepared to
make your personal presentation the embodiment of your brand personality.
Ask yourself which would you rather invest in: an uncertain, messy-looking
genius with a great idea or a focused, well-presented person of average intelli-
gence with a great idea?
Merging with another business
Businesses merge, but there’s really no such thing as a brand merger. Combining
Brand A with Brand B doesn’t result in Brand A+B. It either results in a retooled
version of Brand A, a retooled version of Brand B, or an all-new Brand C.
Entering a merger is entering a politically sensitive area. As part of the
merger negotiations, you need answer the following questions:
 Is the merger actually a takeover? If so, one culture and one brand will
be subsumed by the other.
 Is the reason for the merger to acquire brand strength or to acquire
physical attributes? If it’s to acquire brand strength, then the stronger of
the two brands is the one that must prevail.
 Can you afford the loss of established brand equity if you decide to
create an altogether new brand as a result of the merger?
Depending on your answers to these questions, move into branding action by
following one of these approaches:
 If the merger will result in the survival of one brand, turn to Chapter 17
for advice on revitalizing that brand and reintroducing it in its new and
improved form.
 If the merger will result in an altogether new brand, start the branding
process from scratch following the seven steps outlined in the section
“A Bird’s-eye View of the Branding Process” earlier in this chapter.
With either approach, dedicate extra time, effort, and dollars to gain com-
plete understanding and buy-in from the staffs of both organizations before
you take the retooled brand or the new brand public.

rands are indelible. When they’re seared into customers’ minds, they’re
long-lasting and durable. That’s why this chapter is so important. It
helps you plan your branding strategy before you leap into branding action.
This chapter walks you through the steps of figuring out what you want your
branding program to accomplish, what kind of brand identity you’re seeking,
and what it will take in terms of budget, manpower, and planning to reach the
branding success you seek.
If you don’t yet have a brand — that is, if you’re starting a new business or
getting ready to launch a new product — this chapter can help you plan your
brand from scratch so you get your brand identity, image, and strategy spot-
on from the get-go.
If you already have a brand — that is, if people already know your name and
have impressions about what you stand for — use the information in this chap-
ter as you assess whether the brand image you have is the one you want and, if
not, how you can move your brand from where it is to where you want it to be.
Gearing Up to Brand, Rebrand, 
or Refine Your Brand
If branding is the hot topic in your organization, you’re probably facing one of
two situations: Either you’re starting a business and want to create a new
brand to go with it, or you have a brand but want a different (or somewhat
different) one to better represent your offering in the marketplace.

Whether you’re launching a new brand or you’re in the process of refining an
existing brand, you have to start by figuring out what people think when they
hear your name or think about the industry or business arena you’re enter-
ing. When you’re clear about how people currently perceive your identity,
then you can figure out what brand assets you have to build upon and what
brand identity, in your dreams, you want to achieve.
Getting real about your 
current brand identity
The best starting point for brand development is a true and candid look at
what people currently think of your brand and industry in the marketplace.
If you’re starting a business and don’t yet have a brand to analyze, instead
assess the image of the business arena you’re entering. For instance, if you’re
starting a children’s museum, think about the mental images people have
about museums in general and children’s museums in particular. When you
know the preconceived notions you’re dealing with, you’re in a good position
to develop a strategy that leads to a brand image that reflects the unique
attributes and differentiating aspects of the organization you’re starting.
The point of your brand assessment is to determine answers to the following
questions:
 What do people like or dislike about you, your business, or your 
business arena?
 What do they trust or distrust?
 What do they think you are and do?
 Why do they choose your offering?
 How do they think you compare with your competitors?
 How do they think you affect their lives for better or worse? How do
they find your offering relevant and a good fit with their lives and needs?
Don’t rely solely on your own judgments or those of your top management
team to assess your current image. Instead, gather input from a wider range
of people. Ask those who work on the front line of your business. Go to the
people who answer incoming calls, take product orders, field complaints, 
and fix service problems. Then go talk to some customers or prospective 
customers, too.
Use the following questions in your interviews. They’re designed to help you
collect information on your current brand identity without making you or
those you’re interviewing feel self-conscious about their answers:
44
Part I: Everything You Ever Wanted to Know About Branding 

 In a sentence, how would you describe our business?
 How would you describe our products or services?
 What one reason, above all others, causes you and others to buy from
our business?
 When you consider buying from our business, what three other compa-
nies or brands do you also consider?
 What one reason, above all others, do you think causes people to buy
from one of our competitors?
 Do you think there is high or low awareness of our business or brand in
the marketplace?
 Do you think there are clear and distinct differences between our offer-
ings and those of our competitors? If so, what are a few of the distinct
differences that make our offerings unique or more desirable?
 If you were to compare our business to a car, what car would it be, 
and why? What car would you associate with each of our three top 
competitors?
 If you were to compare our business to an actor or actress, who would 
it be, and why? Who would you associate with each of our three top
competitors?
If your business is small and you have casual conversations with clients and
prospects on an ongoing basis, you can ask the questions in informal face-to-
face meetings. If your customer base is large or geographically diverse, you
may need to pose the questions through written or phone surveys. Turn to
Chapter 4 for advice on how to conduct customer research and when to call
in professional assistance.
As you launch your research, first provide your own answers to these ques-
tions and collect answers from your key management team. Then put those
answers aside while you pose the questions to employees, business associ-
ates, customers, and prospects. The differences between how you and others
see your business and brand may be surprising and will lead to an honest
assessment of the brand you currently have in your own mind and, more
importantly, in the minds of others.
Taking stock of your brand assets and
using them to your advantage
Before making adjustments to your brand image, you need to know what con-
tributes to the value of the brand you currently own.
45
Chapter 3: Heating Up Your Branding Iron

For a well-known example, consider the brand assets of Coke: the red packag-
ing, the Coca-Cola script, the bottle shape, the name, the formula, the market-
ing position of “the Real Thing.” Take any one of those assets away, and the
brand is diminished. Evolve any one of those assets to fit emerging cultural
attitudes or consumer tastes, and the brand is enhanced. Witness how “the
Real Thing” became “Real” and how Coca-Cola has become Coke in marketing
campaigns. The brand assets remain intact, and the brand value increases
through enhanced relevance to changing marketplaces.
The worksheet in Figure 3-1 can help you assess your brand assets. As you
enter your assessment of each asset, base your answer on your own opinion
and on the opinions you collect from those in your company and customer
base. Turn to professional researchers for help if your company is large or if
you’re realigning a brand that will have significant range and value in the
future.
The resulting brand asset analysis allows you to decide which elements of
your brand have significant value. These are the assets that you should keep
or evolve in future brand realignments. The analysis also uncovers which
assets have little recognition or regard and can go by the wayside with little
or no loss of brand strength or value.
In your dreams! Defining your 
desired brand identity
Whereas the preceding sections help you analyze your brand assets and
assess your brand image as it exists today, this section helps you define the
brand image you want for the future.
As you envision your ideal brand image, realize that the brand you build
needs to be a true reflection of your business’s mission, vision, and values as
well as the promises you make and keep in your marketplace. It also needs to
be believable, which is why your strategy to achieve your desired brand iden-
tity needs to take into account currently held perceptions about your brand.
Branding isn’t a game of leapfrog. You can’t ask people to jump past what
they currently believe and immediately land on a new perception about what
you stand for. You have to nudge their beliefs in a new direction by building
upon the images they currently hold as you help them adopt new levels of
awareness, emotional attachment, beliefs, trust, and preference for your
offering.

will help you determine the priority you will place on enhancing perceptions
of each attribute in your branding strategy.

Part I: Everything You Ever Wanted to Know About Branding 
Using key brand attributes to steer 
branding strategy
A few years back, we worked with the develop-
ers of a gated golf community featuring a presti-
gious golf course and homes that raised the bar
of design quality and residential investments.
Exclusivity was a key brand attribute to the com-
munity’s developers and customers alike.
The problem was that the community was hard
to find. It was away from main roads, so people
considering home or homesite purchases
needed detailed directions. The most obvious
solution to this problem — posting highway sig-
nage or outdoor boards offering driving direc-
tions — was ruled out because it risked eroding
the brand’s attributes of exclusivity and prestige.
As a solution, the developers created a brochure
that unfolded to a map leading prospects right to
the property, with inset photos pointing out land-
scape and lifestyle attributes along the way. The

What’s Your Goal? Prioritizing 
Your Brand’s To-Do List
Not everyone setting out to build or fine-tune a brand has the same mission.
Some, especially those representing big, hugely funded companies or top-tier
celebrities, aim above all else to establish and maintain top-of-mind aware-
ness to ensure that the spotlight in their category shines brightly and fully in
their brand’s direction. Others establish brands in order to forge or deepen
emotional connections with customers, to differentiate their products from
competing offers, or to develop the kind of preference and motivation that
prompts purchase decisions and makes cash registers ring. And still other
brand builders want their brands to do all of the above.
Your brand to-do list can be long or short, but you can’t create it after the
fact; in order to build a brand or fine-tune the brand you have, you need to
know where you want to arrive. As you set your sights, determine which of
the following brand functions best describe what you aim to achieve through
branding:
 Build awareness
 Create an emotional connection
 Convey distinguishing attributes
 Gain credibility and trust
 Achieve buyer preference
If you need help organizing your thinking, use the worksheet in Figure 3-3. It
lists the five key brand functions and provides space to rate your brand’s cur-
rent strength in each area and prioritize the functions you want to enhance
through your future branding strategy.
Build awareness
If you’re launching a new brand or working to strengthen a brand in a com-
petitive category, increasing awareness may be among the highest priorities
of your branding program. Brands large and small put awareness-building at
the top of the branding to-do list for these reasons:
 Awareness leads to marketplace dominance. The most powerful
brands owned by the biggest companies and celebrities hold their com-
petitive positions based largely on how widely they’re known and
noticed. That’s why marketers with the biggest brand names constantly
49
Chapter 3: Heating Up Your Branding Iron

reinforce their images through advertising, promotions, and publicity.
They know that in order to maintain their market dominance, they must
continuously strengthen the awareness or notice of their brands in their
far-flung marketplaces.
 Awareness makes selling easier. Marketers who aren’t working with
names like Nike or Oprah work to build awareness not to become the
best known brands in their marketing worlds but to build sales, pure
and simple. Without brand awareness, you spend the lion’s share of
every ad, presentation, or sales call introducing your business and
explaining why it’s better than all other alternatives. Meanwhile, a com-
peting company with established brand awareness can spend that time
advancing information that moves the customer to a purchase decision.
After you build awareness for your brand, that awareness acts like a proxy
for your business. When you can’t be somewhere in person, your brand goes
for you, getting you noticed and conveying your core message and business
promise on your behalf.
Create an emotional connection
If your customers select your offering based largely on how they feel about
owning your product or associating with your business, then creating an emo-
tional connection needs to be an important part of your branding strategy.
Not all brands rely on emotional connections. Some brands succeed based on
their high levels of credibility or on their abilities to distinguish themselves
based on unique benefits that customers can’t get from competing compa-
nies. These brands are chosen based on factual comparisons. They appeal to
what people think; they involve decisions of the mind. Brands that rely on
emotional connections appeal to what people feel; they involve decisions of
the heart.
Consider the last time you bought dish soap. You looked at the lineup of bot-
tles, glanced at the prices, saw that a soap brand you’d heard of was competi-
tively priced, and made your selection. Your decision was rational; based on
your awareness of the brand, you grabbed what seemed to deliver the best
value for the dollars you were expending. You weren’t looking for a happy
marriage between you and the dish soap — you just wanted to know that you
were choosing a good product for a decent price. Emotions didn’t come into
play. On the other hand, think of what you went through the last time you
bought a car; gave to a charity; helped your son or daughter select a univer-
sity to attend; or decided on a new home, laptop computer, or even expensive
sunglasses. Suddenly, your emotions came into play. In addition to function,
you weighed whether or not your choice would feel good — whether it would
instill confidence, security, pride, or even a coolness factor. Ultimately, your
emotions steered you toward your choice more than your mind did.
50
Part I: Everything You Ever Wanted to Know About Branding 

In setting your branding strategy, move emotional connection to the top of
your list if any of the following apply:
 Your product is selected for the sense of satisfaction or security it deliv-
ers, the self-image it enhances, or the experience it provides — as much
or more than for its factual attributes.
 Your product involves a major financial investment that contributes to
the customer’s ego or lifestyle. Not all high-priced items involve emo-
tional connection (root canal, anyone?) but many do, including those that
affect how buyers feel about themselves and how they appear to others.
 Customer loyalty is essential to your success. Face it, people stick with
brands they love, and love, above all others, is the hallmark emotion.
Differentiate your product
When customers understand why your offering is different and better than all
competing products, they have a clear reason to buy from you, and you have
a secure market position.
If you’re not 100 percent sure of how you stand apart from the competitive
pack — or if you’re sure but your customers seem confused or don’t appear
to find the distinction meaningful or motivating — then product differentia-
tion needs to move up in the ranks of what you want to accomplish through
your branding strategy.
Product differentiation is particularly important if you’re facing any of these
marketing challenges:
 Customers fail to see your offering as unique and distinctly beneficial.
 Your market environment is crowded with similar offerings.
 To win sales in your competitive environment, you frequently revert to a
reliance on low pricing or discounting strategies rather than high value.
In some cases, simply fine-tuning your brand promise and marketing message
is enough to win differentiation in the customer’s mind. (Chapter 6 is full of
information on these topics.) More often, though, to achieve meaningful dis-
tinction, you need to undertake at least some level of product modification in
order to add meaningful attributes and benefits that your customer can’t
receive from competitors. Additionally, you many need to change the way
you present your brand by changing your product packaging to magnify
important distinctions that will pull customers in your direction at the
moment of purchase. (If brand revitalization is in the cards, Chapter 17 can
lead you through the process.)
51
Chapter 3: Heating Up Your Branding Iron

Create credibility and trust
In any branding strategy, you absolutely must plan to establish or enhance
credibility and trust. Brands, essentially, are reputations that result from
promises made and consistently kept. If your brand fails to win on these two
counts — if it fails to appear credible or trustworthy — it fails altogether.
When people buy services or when they buy online, they’re buying based
completely on trust that their expectations will be met. Therefore, every new
service or online business needs to make credibility and trust a branding pri-
ority. Likewise, businesses that face credibility crises because they’ve failed to
deliver on the promises they’ve made need to rebuild brand trust in a hurry.
To rate your brand’s credibility and trust levels, ask yourself these questions:
 Do people believe we’re credible and trustworthy?
 Do we appear credible?
 Do we act trustworthy?
 What promise do we make to customers?
 What guarantee or assurance do we extend?
 What additional promises can we make to build even higher levels of
trust?
Your assessment of your current level of trust and your need to enhance the
promise you make will determine the emphasis you put on heightening credi-
bility and trust in your branding strategy.
Motivate purchasing
Brands are like great advance teams in that they establish interest, appeal,
confidence, preference, and purchase motivation in a customer’s mind before
your product ever enters the arena.
For an idea of how brands work to presell products, consider this analogy:
Looking back to the social scene of your high school days, which would you
have preferred: a date with a person whose name you knew and respected, to
whom you were attracted, and with whom you felt trust and a sense of pride in
the potential association; or a blind date who didn’t even come with an assur-
ance from a good friend? In teen jargon, “Duh!” The answer’s a no-brainer.
Faced with a selection, you and nearly everyone else opt for the safe choice.
And the safe choice is the one you’ve heard of (awareness), the one that
52
Part I: Everything You Ever Wanted to Know About Branding 

makes you feel good (emotional connection), the one with uniquely positive
attributes (distinction), and the one you can rely on (credibility and trust).
Together, all the brand functions combine to create product preference and
to motivate purchases, although all don’t play equally in your branding strat-
egy. If you’re building a new brand, your initial branding emphasis will proba-
bly focus on developing brand awareness and differentiating your product.
If you’re refining or realigning an existing brand, you probably already have
established strength in at least some of the functions. Therefore your future
branding strategy will direct your efforts toward gaining strength in your cur-
rent areas of weakness. The worksheet in Figure 3-3 helps you prioritize your
efforts and design your strategy to motivate purchasing.

Crunching the Numbers: Budgeting 
for Your Brand Building Program
Ask a handful of homebuilders how much it costs to build a home and you’ll
get a handful of different answers. The cost depends on the home being built.
The same is true when the question is, “How much does it cost to build a
brand?”
The variables involved in the cost of brand building include:
 The amount of your own time and expertise you can commit:
Especially if your brand is local or your business is small, you can prob-
ably research your current brand image, define your desired brand iden-
tity, and determine the value of the brand assets you’ve already
developed without bringing in professional help.
 The extent to which your brand will venture: If your brand will travel
far from your home office and therefore will represent you when you’re
nowhere to be found, it had better be pretty impressive, which usually
means that you’d better plan to make a more sizeable investment in
branding than that required by a very small business with a small and
geographically limited clientele.
 The business level at which your brand will compete: Playing in the
major league is more expensive than playing in the minor league. If you
intend to compete with established, well-known, superbly branded com-
panies or organizations, you’d better invest in a brand that’s up to the
task, which means a do-it-yourself logo is out of the question, for example.
As you assemble your budget, flip back to Chapter 1 for an idea of the range
of costs involved in each phase of the brand development process. Based on
the variables listed, adjust the numbers to your unique situation as you
assign costs for each of the following three phases of the branding process:
1. Strategic development and positioning
This phase involves market research, brand identity research, brand
aspiration research, and development of the positioning and branding
strategies you’ll follow to reach the branding success you seek. (If you
plan to do a good portion of this work yourself, check out Chapters 4, 5,
and 6.)
2. Creation of brand identity elements
In this phase, professionals are worth their weight in gold. When it
comes to creating, selecting, and protecting your name; designing your
54
Part I: Everything You Ever Wanted to Know About Branding 

logo; devising your tagline; and developing the core marketing materials
that will carry your brand into the marketplace, hire the best talent for
the job.
If the job is development of a name and logo for a service business that
faces only moderate competition in a localized market area, plan on a
moderate investment. On the other hand, if the job is development of a
name and logo that will travel not just past state lines but across inter-
national borders and through cyberspace to hundreds of thousands of
business prospects, invest more heavily and amortize the cost for years
to come.
3. Implementation of your brand strategy
When you’ve set your brand strategy and established your brand iden-
tity, implementing your branding program becomes part of your existing
marketing program — and your existing marketing budget. Branding and
marketing aren’t separate in terms of message or money. Your brand
strategy becomes the foundation for your marketing strategy, just as it
becomes the basis of your business plan (see the next section).
55
Chapter 3: Heating Up Your Branding Iron
If you don’t have the heaviest hammer . . .
The old saying marketers use when dealing with
small-budget clients is, “If you don’t have the
heaviest hammer, use the sharpest nail.” How
does that relate to branding?
If you don’t have the biggest budget (or anything
even close to a big budget), sharpen the focus of
your branding program so that it works to
achieve two brand functions above all others:
target-market awareness and product differen-
tiation. Make sure that every single communica-
tion that leaves your business helps those within
your target market know who you are and why
your offering is different and better.
The key to this strategy is focusing on your target
market. If you don’t have the biggest budget,
don’t try to talk to the biggest market. Tailor your
brand and focus your communications on those
who will make a difference to your success.
Then as you send brand messages into your
target marketplace, follow this advice:
 See that every single communication —
online or offline, in person or through 
media — carries your brand identity without
variation so that you etch a single, crystal-
clear, professional brand image.
 Put your logo on absolutely everything that
represents you and your brand in the mar-
ketplace.
 Add a tagline or slogan (see Chapter 8 for
help) if your name doesn’t adequately
convey who you are, what you do, and why
you’re great.
 If you rely heavily on e-mail, add a signature
line that presents your business name and
tagline on your e-mail messages.
Building a brand image doesn’t have to cost a
fortune, but building a brand that doesn’t cost a
fortune does require target marketing and utmost
consistency.

Making Brand Development 
Part of Your Business Plan
Your brand is your business; it’s the presentation of what you are and what
you stand for. Your brand is the way you present the promise your business
makes to everyone it touches, whether as an employee, an investor, a cus-
tomer, an associate, or a supporter in the form of a referring source, contribu-
tor, or friend.
Your business plan (you do have one, right?) is the blueprint for how you’ll
achieve business success. It includes the following components:
 Your company overview, which includes your mission, vision, values,
key products, and business goals
 Your business environment, which includes your industry overview,
market segmentation, customer profile, and competitive analysis
 Your company strategy, which includes your business model, goals,
marketing plan, and growth strategy
 Your company description, which includes the products you offer, your
research and operational capabilities, and your marketing strategy
In every one of these business plan components, your brand plays a starring
role. It embodies your mission, vision, and values. It impacts your product
development plans. It guides your market segmentation, customer targeting,
and competitive strategy decisions. It determines what you do and say and
how you look and feel. It keeps you true to your business promise.
When you build your business, essentially, you’re building your brand, and
vice versa. The two are interdependent and mutually beneficial.
Knowing the relationship between your
mission, vision, and brand identity
This part confuses even the pros. The terms mission, vision, and brand iden-
tity all come with blurry edges that overlap and confound. For the record:
 Your mission is the broad purpose of your company and the affect it will
have on others.
 Your vision is your long-term aspiration for your business. It’s what you
want to achieve through your business success.
 Your brand identity is a tangible expression that reflects and represents
both your mission and your vision.
56
Part I: Everything You Ever Wanted to Know About Branding 

Those of us in the field of marketing spend hours trying to simplify the hier-
archy of mission, vision, and brand identity, and here’s a quick way to put the
three in context: Your mission is the heart of your business, your vision is the
eyes, and your brand identity is the face. (Chapter 6 helps you put all three
into words.)
Committing to the branding process
Think of entering the branding process as entering a marriage — you have to
agree to commit for the long haul.
Your brand is a reflection of your company’s mission and vision. You’d think
that if you know your company’s mission and vision, identifying your brand
and starting the branding process should be a piece of cake. But it rarely is.
Many businesses reach for their mission and vision statements and realize
that they never created them in the first place. Oops. Others have statements
that, upon review, no longer accurately reflect where they want the business
to go and what they want it to be. If either of these scenarios sound sounds
familiar, don’t be embarrassed. Instead, turn quickly to Chapter 6 for guid-
ance in righting the wrongs.
Determining the kind of business you want your brand to reflect is a big and
important decision that may take time and definitely takes patience. Set aside
some time and head off on a planning retreat with all the people who make
your business what it is. Together, you can define what you want out of your
brand, how you’ll measure success, and how you’ll build a brand that can
grow with your business and your customer base far into the future. When
you embark on the planning process, turn to Chapter 6 for step-by-step
advice to follow when creating your brand definition and brand promise.
Who’s on First? Recruiting 
Your Branding Team
Your brand is the promise of what your organization is, what it stands for,
and what benefits it delivers, and it’s reinforced every single time people
come in contact with any facet of your business. That means that everyone in
your company is a representative of your brand. As you set out to create or
revamp your brand, form a branding team that includes representatives from
all aspects of your organization. Then, at key milestones along the way, bring
your entire staff onto the team through updates and presentations.
57
Chapter 3: Heating Up Your Branding Iron

Getting buy-in from the top down
Buy-in, participation, and leadership from the owners and top-level execu-
tives of your company are absolutely essential to your branding success.
Your brand is a reflection of the direction in which the top-level leadership is
driving the company. If those in a position to make strategic business deci-
sions don’t understand and champion the brand you’re building, they may as
well lead the company away from its brand promise and toward a credibility
train wreck.
Consider a photographic studio that builds a brand to reflect the expertise
and exclusivity required to handle high-end corporate assignments that
result in award-winning photos appearing in annual reports, internationally
distributed brochures, and ads in the most prestigious publications. If the
studio owner, in an effort to increase business, starts advertising to attract
clients for wedding photos and high school graduation pictures, the presti-
gious attributes of the studio’s brand promise to corporations go right out
the window.
Your brand needs to be reinforced through every business decision and
through every brand contact point. For that reason, it needs to have the
interest and engagement of those who call the shots and keep the company
true to its brand premise and promise.
Engaging all employees in the process
The only way to get company-wide commitment to your brand is to get com-
pany-wide awareness of your brand, backed by company-wide rules about
how your brand is to be presented and protected.
Educate everyone from the CEO to part-time or freelance designers about
your brand strategy, promise, identity, and presentation guidelines. Turn
them into brand champions (use Chapter 13 as your playbook), and ensure
that they know the rules for presenting your brand by following the advice
for managing your logo in Chapter 8 and staying true to your brand promise
in Chapter 14.
Take the time to put everyone on the same branding page. What they don’t
know can hurt you.

Next, it goes into site planning, helping you find and stake

o matter what you’re branding or whether you’re building a new brand
or revitalizing an existing brand, your effort has to start with market
research, and here’s why: Unless your budget is limitless (and we’ve yet to
see one that is), you can’t possibly try to talk to all the people who may have
some interest in what you have to offer. You have to target both your mes-
sage and your market.
Targeting your market involves figuring out which people are most likely to
want what you’re selling. You have to find out who they are, where they are,
how they’re best reached by media, what kinds of messages or offers will
motivate them to buy, and, when they’re ready to buy, what kind of buying
and customer experience will make them satisfied and loyal to your brand.
If you have ESP or you’re a genius with a crystal ball, you can guess at the
answers. If you’re like everyone else, you need to do some research, and
that’s what this chapter’s all about. It helps you create a profile of your ideal
customer and then determine your customers’ purchase motivations, their
preferred purchase channels and experiences, and the reasons they choose
one brand over another in your category.
In the process of this research, you find your market niche — the select group
of customers who share unique interests and needs that your offering alone
can address. When you find your market niche, presto! You’ve discovered an
open position for your brand in the crowded marketplace around you.

Defining Who Buys What You’re 
Selling — and Why
You have to know your customers in order to know how to speak to them and
how to create a brand experience that they find relevant, attractive, and moti-
vating. If your market is comprised of teenagers and your marketing talks to
seniors, you’re communicating in a foreign language. That’s an exaggeration,
of course, but it makes the point of why this section is important.
Customer research is essential for of the following reasons, among others:
 Customer research helps you define who your customers are and,
better yet, who your most ideal customers are. This information helps
you design a brand strategy that attracts and wins more customers just
like the very best ones you already have.
 Customer research reveals the reasons your most ideal customers are
attracted to your business. With this knowledge, you can highlight in
your branding strategy the attributes that your customers find most
attractive, and you can design processes that enhance and complete the
brand experience every time customers encounter your business.
 Customer research reveals the reasons people don’t buy your offer-
ing. You can use this knowledge to fix deficiencies or differentiate
between those who do and don’t want what you’re selling, which leads
you straight to a market niche.
In the next sections, we focus on how to create a profile of who your cus-
tomers are in factual terms and how to discover what your customers want
and value, what motivates their purchase decisions, what buying patterns
they follow, and what they prefer about the various brands in your category.
Your customer profile
Arriving at your customer profile involves a look at customer facts and fig-
ures, which usually fall into the categories of geographics, demographics, and
behavioral patterns.
By knowing your customer geographics, you know where to reach your cus-
tomers; by knowing their demographics, you know who to reach; and based
on their behavior patterns, you know how to reach them.
If you’re branding a new business, you don’t have an established clientele to
profile. Instead, describe the people you believe are most apt to buy from
your new company based on what you know about customers in your indus-
try and in the unique niche you’re aiming to fill.
62
Part II: Building a Brand, Step-by-Step 

Mapping out geographics
To obtain geographic information, gather addresses off invoices, checks, or
shipping labels, or ask customers for their zip codes during quick surveys.
The findings tell you which neighborhoods, counties, states, or international
regions are home to large concentrations of your customers. Analyze your
findings by answering the following questions:
 Do a majority of your customers live in a single geographic area? The
concept of geodemographics, or cluster marketing, stems from the premise
that people who live in the same area tend to have similar traits, prefer-
ences, and buying patterns. If you notice that your customers cluster in
concise market areas, study the economics and resident profiles of
those market areas. You’re likely to discover the values and purchase
motivators of your customers.
 Do customers from different market areas purchase from your busi-
ness differently? For example, suppose you discover that customers
within close proximity to your business drop in for impulse and sale 
purchases, whereas those from farther away make appointments, stay
longer, and buy higher-ticket items. With this information, you may con-
clude that convenience is a key brand attribute to those in the local
market area, and expertise or exclusivity are key attributes to distant
customers. Based on the market area you want to grow, you know which
attribute to stress in your branding program.
Detailing demographics
Use personal observation or surveys to arrive at a factual analysis of your
customer base. Focus on the following elements:
 Gender: What percentage of customers is male, and what percentage is
female?
 Age: What percentage of customers falls into the following age groups:
children, teens, 20–30, 31–40, 41–50, 51–65, and 65+?
 Household composition: Are most customers single, married, divorced,
widowed, parents with children at home, couples without children at
home, or grandparents?
 Income information: What income category do most customers fall
into? Do most rent or own their homes? Are they retired, self-employed,
professionals, or students?
 Ethnic information: Is most or a good percentage of your customer base
of a specific nationality? What languages do they speak?
63
Chapter 4: Finding a Niche You Can Fill: Researching Your Market

Uncovering behavioral patterns
Behavioral patterns usually stem from your customers’ interests and beliefs.
 Interests: Do many of your customers share the same recreational inter-
ests? Do they tend to read the same kinds of magazines, watch the same
kinds of TV programs, or listen to the same kinds of radio stations or
music? Do they use the Internet?
 Beliefs: Is a good portion of your customer base members of the same
kinds of groups, organizations, churches, political party, or other groups
that they support and believe in?
What your customers want and value
When you know who you’re trying to reach and where and how to reach
them, you need to know what to say in order to address your customers’
values, motivations, and purchasing patterns. The following questions can
help you access the information you need:
 What motivates your customers’ purchase decisions? Put differently,
what needs or desires are your customers trying to fill when they pur-
chase your product? Realize that the answer isn’t always obvious. A
couple may say that they like the design and quality of a particular new
home when really they’re motivated by the prestige of the neighborhood.
To get to the root of your customers’ purchase motivation, try to find
out how your offering makes a customer feel. For instance, you may 
discover that the homebuyers like the design and quality of the home
they’re considering because it makes them feel prestigious or luxurious.
By uncovering the feelings your product evokes, you know the basis of
the buyer’s motivation and the attributes to highlight in your branding
strategy.
 How do your customers approach your business? Do they buy in-
person, or by phone, mail, or online? Do customers decide to buy on
their own or on the recommendation of or with the approval of someone
else? Does your brand need to make a promise to the product consumer
or to the purchase authority or referring agent? Or both? By knowing
how customers reach your business and the factors that influence their
purchase you’ll be able to create a more effective branding strategy.
 How do customers purchase your products? By analyzing purchase 
patterns, you can uncover information about the brand attributes that
matter most to customers.
• Do most of your customers buy on impulse or after careful consid-
eration? Careful consideration may indicate a need for trust and
reliability assurances.
64
Part II: Building a Brand, Step-by-Step 

• Do they pay cash, charge, or buy on payment plans? Payment
plans may indicate a greater sensitivity to price.
• Do they sign contracts or opt for multipurchase deals? Long-term
commitments indicate high trust.
• If you offer an add-on warranty or service program, do most cus-
tomers take the offering or decline it? Acceptance may indicate
concern over ease of use or reliability.
• Are they interested primarily in price, or are their decisions made
based on quality, prestige, convenience, or other values?
What sets your most ideal customers apart
Your most ideal customers are the people who buy the most from your busi-
ness, cause the fewest problems, say the nicest things, and recommend you
the most often. To determine if your most ideal customers have geographic,
demographic, or behavioral traits in common (see the section “Your cus-
tomer profile” for an explanation of those things), answer these questions:
 Do your most ideal customers tend to buy the same kinds of products 
or request the same kinds of options?
 Do they buy from your business simply to obtain your product or 
service, or do they think that your offering fulfills additional needs or
interests — such as the ability to socialize, to feel the prestige of joining
your exclusive or trendy clientele, to enrich themselves educationally
through product samples or seminars, or to enjoy the level of your
expertise or the safety of your trustworthiness?
 What attributes of your business do you think your most ideal customers
value most highly: product quality, available features, convenience (your
location or your purchasing options), reliability, staff expertise, customer
support and service, price (high or low — some people are attracted to
bargains and others to the highest level of premium offering), or other
aspects of doing business with you?
 How do your most ideal customers buy? For example, do they buy on
impulse, in bulk, on sale, and so on?
 Do your most ideal customers share any of the same demographic or
lifestyle characteristics, such as gender, age, income, ethnicity, geo-
graphic location, beliefs, or values?

Why customers buy from you
Take all that you know about your customer demographics, geographics,
behavioral patterns, and purchase values and motivations and answer this
question: Why do customers choose to buy from you?
Commit your thoughts to paper using the format shown in Figure 4-1. Complete
the form twice: once for your average customer and once for your most ideal
customer. Use the information in the average customer form to determine how
your brand must appeal to your current clientele. Use the information in the
ideal customer form to determine which brand attributes to emphasize in
order to shift your clientele to include more customers like those you currently
consider the cream of the crop and also to enhance the brand experience that
your most ideal customers count on from your business.

Who might be a customer? Inquiring 
minds want to know
In addition to studying your customers (check
out the section “Defining Who Buys What You’re
Selling — and Why”), study your inquiries.
Inquiries are prospective customers, and they’re
a great indicator of what kinds of messages and
motivators attract interest to your business. To
study your inquiries, do the following:
 Track where your inquiries come from. Use
information from incoming phone calls,
direct mail responses, in-person visits, and
Web site activity reports to determine the
geographic locales of people who are
attracted to your offering. The findings may
lead you to the development of new target
market areas.
 Pay attention to what kinds of marketing
messages gain strong inquiry responsive-
ness, and then watch to see whether or not
those inquiries result in sales. You may dis-
cover that an attribute you tout in marketing
draws a heavy response that doesn’t con-
vert to sales. Conclusion: On closer exami-
nation, your offering doesn’t fulfill the
inquiry’s want or need. Either you need to
enhance the strength of the attribute that
drew the inquiry to you, or you need to shift
your emphasis to a different, more-deliver-
able attribute in future marketing efforts.
 Collect the names of those inquiring about
your offering and then follow up with them
to determine whether or not they purchased
a product in your category. Conduct a short
survey by phone or mail to ask if they made
a purchase, if they’re still considering a pur-
chase, or if they decided not to purchase. If
they purchased a competing product, ask
what distinguishing features or brand attrib-
utes led them from your offering to that of
your competitors.

Digging Up the Info You Need
Of all the time and money spent on market research each year, the over-
whelming majority is invested by a few huge companies. Hmmm . . . there’s
probably a correlation there: Big businesses get bigger by knowing and
responding to customer wants and needs.
You can do the same, even without a huge research investment. If you’re will-
ing to devote time, you don’t need a huge budget to unearth the information
you need. You can start by looking for telltale signs within your own business
and sales records. You can talk directly to customers (something that smaller
business owners do on a daily basis anyway), and you can conduct do-it-
yourself research.
Know thyself: Conducting a self-
assessment of your offering
A successful brand strategy results in an accurate reflection of what you are
and what you promise to those who come into contact with your business.
That’s why it’s important to start your brand research by looking long and
hard at your business to define your brand as it exists right now. Start by
answering these questions:
AT-A-GLANCE CUSTOMER DESCRIPTION
PROFILE: Our customers are predominantly     [ gender ]     living in     [ region_]     
who     [ a description of lifestyle facts such as: are married, own their homes, 
work as professionals, have young children living at home, and are members of business 
organizations and/or golf clubs ]    . 
WANTS AND VALUES: Our customers value     [_the attributes your customers 
value, for example Quality, Features, Convenience, Reliability, Expertise, 
Support, Service, Low Price, Prestige, or Exclusivity  ]    .
MOTIVATIONS: The top reasons our customers buy from our business are:  [_we’re
conveniently located, they get to work directly with the owner/s, they want the best and 
perceive us to be more exclusive than our competitors, we get things done quickly and on 
budget, and so on _]    .

 What does your business do best? What single thing above all others
makes your business or product a great choice for customers? If you
were to close tomorrow, what attributes that you offer would customers
have the hardest time finding elsewhere?
 What do customers buy most from your business? Refer to your
invoices, your order log, and your income statement. Where is the
money coming from? Customers vote with their pocketbooks, so if most
of your revenue comes from a single product or service line, that line
probably represents the offering your customers value most highly.
 What aspect of your business gets the most internal attention? How 
do you or the leadership of your company allocate time and money to
develop your business? Most companies prioritize efforts in one of the
following areas: research and development, operations, marketing, dis-
tribution and delivery, management, organization, and customer service.
What is the major emphasis in your company? Your answer probably
points toward your business strength and a brand attribute.
 What services do you offer or promise that your competitors don’t?
A decade ago, who would have thought that delivering a pizza within 
30 minutes would distinguish a brand? Domino’s did. Who would have
thought that promising to get a delivery to its destination overnight would
set a company apart? FedEx did. Does your company make a promise — a
promise that may feel like a minimal standard within your organization —
that causes customers to choose and stick with your business? Look hard.
Something as mundane as consistently putting jewelry in a robin’s egg-
blue box could be the factor that makes you the Tiffany of your category.
Tuning in to customer insights
To find out how your business is excelling and where it’s lagging, you don’t
need to do formal research. Just talk to those who actually meet with your
customers face-to-face — at the reception desk, at the customer service
window, in the complaints or returns line, and on the sales floor. Or place
yourself in a position to actually watch customers in action. What do they
like? What attracts them? What confuses them? What causes them to look
more closely? What causes them to turn away?
As you tap into customer insights, look for answers to these questions:
 What requests do customers make that you currently don’t fulfill? Do
customers wish you offered same-day delivery, easier parking, addi-
tional product features, streamlined service, or a real person on the
other end of the line instead of your voicemail system? Ask everyone in
your organization to add every request they hear to a customer wish list.
You can’t fulfill all requests — doing so could cause you to veer away
from your brand identity — but you at least need to know what cus-
tomers want so you can enhance your offerings when appropriate.

Part II: Building a Brand, Step-by-Step 

An example of customer input leading to brand enhancements comes right
from our own Oregon backyard, where the High Desert Museum tuned in
to customers and enhanced its reputation as a visitor destination. Museum
volunteers and staff noticed that after about an hour and half at the
museum, visitors started asking where they could get something to eat. A
vending machine was the only answer, and you can bet that it did a brisk
business. Still, after about two hours, guests drifted out the front door in
order to find restaurants, leaving behind them the chance to join the
museum membership or to shop longer in the museum store. But that was
then, and this is now. Today, the museum has a full-service restaurant that
serves visitors, allows for after-hours catered receptions, and enhances
the museum’s brand image as a place to spend not just a few hungry hours
but a full day immersed in natural history and wildlife exhibits.
 What complaints do customers register? Establish a complaint log
where employees can list customer complaints they receive or elements
they believe to cause customer departures. You can only fix problems
that you know about. According to research, for every complaint you
hear, 26 customers have issues that they don’t mention. So in addition 
to asking employees to record stated complaints, ask them to read
unstated clues to dissatisfaction (see the next item in this list).
 What hints of dissatisfaction do your customers give? Ask everyone in
your company to note compliments that customers share about your
competitors. Ask them to record any positive mention of how things
used to be (“Oh, for the good old days when a real person answered the
phone”), and ask employees to let you know if they no longer hear the
compliments that they used to hear frequently.
 Which products are on back order? And which frequently get
returned? The answers to these two questions reveal what your 
customers want and don’t want.
 What displays, Web pages, or promotional offers get the most atten-
tion from your customers? There’s an old saying in marketing: “Sell
what people are buying.” In branding, the concept translates to some-
thing like this: Brand the attributes people want from your business.
To uncover what they want, watch them move through your business.
Watch the way they travel through your Web site, watch the promotional
offers that win the greatest response, watch the carpet on your retail
floor to see where it’s most worn, and watch your shelves to see which
ones are continuously depleted of inventory or which products are
reordered continuously.
Conducting customer research
Sometimes you have to conduct more formal research in order to excavate
the information you need to know from customers. Let this section guide you
as you enter the realm of interviews, surveys, and focus groups.
69
Chapter 4: Finding a Niche You Can Fill: Researching Your Market

Just watch! Observing customer behaviors
The section “Tuning in to customer insights” gets you started researching
customer behavior simply by watching your customers in action. This sec-
tion takes it a step farther and provides a few how-to tips and approaches for
formalizing your customer observation research.
 Watch how customers arrive at your business. On at least a quarterly
basis, consider the following:
• If they arrive at your business online, track the paths they take to
your site. Do they follow links, and, if so, what do the links offer? If
they come from search engine results, what terms are they research-
ing? If they navigate through your site, where do they go? Your con-
clusions reveal how customers are attracted to your business.
• If they arrive in person, what kinds of cars do they drive? What
kinds of clothes do they wear? Observe what shopping bags, if any,
they carry. Do they arrive alone or with others? All are clues to
customer interests and values. Based on your findings, you can
enhance waiting areas, child play areas, refreshment offerings, or
other amenities that cater to the ways your customers experience
your brand and your business.
• If they arrive via phone, use caller ID features to pinpoint each
caller’s geographic location. Then work with your phone service
provider to assess their phone experiences: How long do they stay
on hold, how many hang up before getting through to someone in
your business, and how many layers of automated responses do
they go through before accessing the right information? Your find-
ings tell you a lot about your inquiries (prospective customers),
the satisfaction levels of your phone customers, and the interests
they seek to address.
 Watch where customers go when they’re at your business. This step is
particularly important for businesses that serve customers on-site.
Consider the following:
• What do they do upon entry? Do they ask about the nature of
your business? If so, you know immediately that you need to
enhance your brand awareness. Do they seem confused about
what to do or where to go upon entry to your business? If so, you
need to enhance your reception techniques or your directional sig-
nage. Do they encounter bottlenecks that cause initial negative
reactions? Unless you’re trying to convey that you’re the busiest
business in the world and that people would rather wait than go to
a competitor, interpret your customers’ reactions as the need for
some service retuning.
• What questions do they ask or hint at? If they consistently ask
about prices, or if they leave looking quizzically at the receipts in
their hands, be ready to reassess your pricing or billing procedures.
70
Part II: Building a Brand, Step-by-Step 

If they have to ask repeatedly to touch the merchandise or to see
samples of your work for other clients, understand that they have
doubts about your offering and need the reassurances that only
better displays and presentations can deliver. If they want to experi-
ence your product (a sure sign of engaged interest), be ready to offer
anything from test-drives to testimonials that provide a sense of
what it’s like to be the proud owner of whatever you’re selling.
• Where do they stand or wait? Go to the normal collection points
in your business and see what your customers experience during
wait times. Are they presented with brand messages? Are they
encouraged to make add-on purchases? Are they asked to share
their input about your business? If they do nothing but look
around for what to do next, you’re missing an opportunity to pro-
mote your brand or to collect information that allows you to make
your brand stronger.
Just ask! Interviews and surveys
Before you take up your customer’s time with an interview or survey, be clear
about what you want the research to accomplish. Most research is intended
to discover who your customers are and how to reach them, what your cus-
tomers think of and want from products or services like the ones you offer,
and how your customers may react to possible product or marketing innova-
tions or revisions you’re considering. As you collect information, follow this
advice:
 If you’re collecting information to clarify your customer profile, you
hardly need an in-depth interview or survey. (For more on customer
profiles, flip back to the section “Your customer profile” earlier in this
chapter.) You can collect information through online or in-person cus-
tomer registration forms, you can host contests that include the
requested information on entry forms, or you can issue a customer
information update request on a regular basis, perhaps accompanied by
a small thank-you gift for those you count among your valuable cus-
tomer base.
 If you’re working to assess levels of customer awareness, interest, or
satisfaction, customer opinion surveys are a good tool for the task.
You can conduct short surveys in-person at the point of purchase, or
you can collect more extensive information through questionnaires
delivered via phone, mail, or e-mail.
For surveys that involve more than a few questions, most companies
seek professional assistance as they develop their survey instruments.
The tricky part is that although you want to collect information about
your offerings in order to improve them, you don’t want to fan any fires
of discontent by spotlighting shortcomings or by unduly imposing on
your customers’ time. You also don’t want to lead your customers to the
answers you’re seeking; if you do, the research is basically good for
71
Chapter 4: Finding a Niche You Can Fill: Researching Your Market

nothing. To balance your dueling desires for customer input and cus-
tomer satisfaction, follow this advice:
• Keep your survey short enough that it only takes a few minutes
of your customers’ time. The exception is when you’re dealing
with highly loyal customers who are committed to your business
and willing to invest heavily of their time.
• Avoid general questions in favor of comparative questions that
are more likely to elicit thoughtful and accurate responses. For
example, avoid a general question like, “On a scale of 1 to 10 with
10 being best, how do you rate our service?” Instead, ask, “On a
scale of 1 to 10 with 10 being best, how satisfied were you with the
service you received during your last visit to our business?”
• Ask questions that help you understand how your customer
relates to your product. For example, you may ask, “On a scale of
1 to 10 with 10 being highest, how closely did our product live up
to your expectations?”
• Ask questions that reveal how you stack up against competitors
in customers’ minds. For example, you may ask, “On a scale of 1 to
10 with 10 being highest, how convenient is our location compared
to the location of other businesses where you can purchase similar
products or services?
 To see how your customers react to a product or marketing idea, or to
pinpoint subtleties in what they think or feel, consider chatting one-to-
one in personal or phone interviews. When conducting interviews,
keep the following points in mind:
• You waste everyone’s time if you aren’t truly open to any cus-
tomer response to your idea. If you (or those in a leadership posi-
tion) already know what you’re going to do and are simply seeking
validation, save your time and money.
• You may not be the best person to conduct the interview.
Generally, people are nice and polite and don’t want to burst bub-
bles or hurt feelings. If a third-party professional researcher asks
for your customers’ opinions, the answers may be 180 degrees dif-
ferent (and more accurate) than what customers would admit to
the owner of the idea.
Table 4-1 can help you determine when to seek professional help with your
research program and when you can just go it alone.
Just listen! Using focus groups
Focus groups, by definition, are left to the professionals. A focus group is a
gathering of customers or prospective customers who share input about a
product or marketing idea with a professional moderator who guides the con-
versation, prompts input, and manages the discussion so it isn’t dominated
by one person or opinion. The only reason you should hold a focus group is if
72
Part II: Building a Brand, Step-by-Step 

you want to weigh opinions, reactions, and risks before proceeding with an
important product or marketing decision. Before holding a focus group, be
clear about the information or idea you’re presenting to the group and the
kind of impressions you’re seeking to collect before the session ends.
When to do it yourself and 
when to get research help
When you’re dealing with market research, there are some things you can do
yourself and others that you need outside help for in order to get the most accu-
rate, useful results. Table 4-1 lays out various information-gathering approaches
along with advice regarding when to involve professional assistance.

Where else to turn for facts and figures
Thanks to the Internet, the resources available to help you gather informa-
tion about your market and customers are virtually without limit. Following
are a few ways to focus your research efforts.
Go Web surfing
When you hit the Web, start with these recommendations and then let your
imagination and your search engine take over:
 Visit the Web sites of your competitors. Check out how they present
themselves, the brand attributes they highlight, and the new moves
they’re announcing to see what you’re up against.
 Go to government Web sites. Start with www.census.gov for informa-
tion on the population and resident characteristics in practically any
U.S. community. Then move on to the Web sites of the business develop-
ment departments that serve your target market areas, from your state’s
economic development department to the business resource center at
your local chamber of commerce.
 Search for organizations that serve the interests of your industry.
Enter your industry into a search engine and check out some of the top
results in order to access facts and figures about the business arena in
which you operate. For instance, when we enter “golf industry statistics”
in our favorite search engine, one of the first results is the Golf Research
Group, “the world’s leading consultant and publisher of business infor-
mation to the golfing industry.” As another example, we enter “cellular
phone industry statistics” into the search engine and one of the first
results is for the Cellular Telecommunications & Internet Association,
“the international association for the wireless telecommunication indus-
try.” Similar industry groups probably serve your business arena.
Hit the library reference shelves
In addition to reference materials specific to your industry, check out these
two marketing sourcebooks:
74
Part II: Building a Brand, Step-by-Step 

 ESRI Community Sourcebooks: These volumes contain population,
demographic, and income data as well as other consumer information
for every U.S. zip code, Direct Marketing Area (DMA), and Metropolitan
Statistical Area (MSA). The information is valuable as you work to fore-
cast demand for your products, note population trends, and analyze the
composition of your target market area.
 The Lifestyle Market Analyst: Published by Standard Rate and Data
Service (SRDS) and Equifax, this guide provides demographic and
lifestyle data organized by geographic market area, lifestyle interests,
and consumer profiles.
Putting It All in Perspective
Knowing as much as you can about who you’re trying to reach and what your
target customer wants and needs helps you make essential decisions as you
create your branding strategy. But beware: People can smell a fabricated
fake. You have to be what you say you are. If your customers want “cool and
trendy,” you have to be cool and trendy before you amplify that message in
the marketplace. You have to be able to walk your talk.
The most powerful brands are created by those with strong personalities,
aspirations, and passions. A great example is Martha Stewart. On an episode
of the show The Apprentice, she reprimanded one of the contestants for rely-
ing too heavily on research findings. She used her own organization as a
counterpoint, explaining that rather than creating products in response to
customer desires, her company created unquestionably great products and
then created customer desire. The same statement applies to most every cur-
rent and historic great brand leader, from Steve Jobs to Walt Disney to Oprah
Winfrey. All have strong opinions and clear visions. Even when they were told
that their ideas wouldn’t fly, they proceeded, and then they created the
desire that led to the best branding case studies in the world.
Use research not to create your brand message but to fine-tune it. Start with
passion, and build from there. If your brand doesn’t have your heart and soul
in it, no amount of research can give it a successful life.
Seizing Marketplace Opportunities
Chapter 2 features an illustrated view of the branding process as it moves
from brand essence to brand esteem. The final leg in the branding race is to
realign your brand to address market conditions, purchase behaviors, and
customer aesthetics, and that final phase is never done. Your brand lives in
the here and now, and the only way to keep it alive and healthy is to con-
stantly keep it attuned to the wants, needs, interests, and opportunities that
exist in the world not just of today but of tomorrow.
75
Chapter 4: Finding a Niche You Can Fill: Researching Your Market

Your brand is a player in pop culture, so the more you tune in to the changing
world around you, the more your brand will remain current — and relevant.
To keep your brand on top of marketplace opportunities, you don’t have to
be a seer who forecasts the future. You just have to look beyond the known
environments of your business and social arena for new ideas, needs, prod-
ucts, fads, trends, and market frenzies. To put yourself in position to seize
opportunities, follow these suggestions:
 Stay close to your customers. Only by listening and observing can you
know what they want but can’t find or what new needs they’re dealing
with that marketers haven’t yet addressed.
 Get close to your noncustomers. It sounds counterintuitive, but you
need to keep an eye on what people who are the polar opposite of your
customers are into. Urban youth certainly didn’t fit the customer profile
of high-end fashion boutiques, but it didn’t take long for the grunge look
to affect haute couture anyway. To keep your brand current, widen your
marketplace view. Tune in to what may feel like the foreign language of
teenagers even if your market is comprised of senior citizens. Read tech-
nology publications even if your business arena is in the professional
services.
 Be ready to update and align your brand to the changing market envi-
ronment. Check out Chapter 17 for help with this task.
 At all times, watch for unmet needs and unserved market segments. A
branding success opportunity may await you if you can fill a hole in the
market. See the sidebar on DOS For Dummies for a prime example.
76
Part II: Building a Brand, Step-by-Step 
How DOS For Dummies launched 
“A Reference for the Rest of Us”
Way back in 1987, when computerese was a
foreign language and computer manuals were
practically impossible to understand, an enter-
prising author overheard a frustrated customer
wish for a simple how-to book that explained
the DOS operating system. According to lore, he
said, “Something like DOS For Dummies.” In
1991, Dan Gookin’s book with that very title hit
bookshelves. Booksellers were leery that the
title would insult their customers, but the pub-
lisher allayed concern by calling the title a
“term of endearment,” and book buyers
responded by falling in love with the concept.
Today, 125 million books later, the For Dummies
phenomenon is a branding case study. If you
want proof that brands emerge with full
strength when they address real and unmet
needs and when they’re propelled by the
founder’s passion and powerful belief, look no
further than the yellow and black book you’re
smartly holding in your hands.

D
epending on who’s counting, today’s average consumer faces a barrage
of up to 3,000 advertising and promotional messages every single day.
People cope with the onslaught in two ways. First, they tune out messages
that don’t appeal to their wants and needs. Second, they brush off messages
for offerings they already buy from trusted suppliers unless — and here’s the
whole point of finding and protecting a position for your brand — the offering
being presented is uniquely and attractively different and better.
To get through the noise and clutter of today’s marketplace, you have to win
a competitive position by presenting your offering as unique and different in
a way that truly matters to customers. Then, after your brand wins a place in
your customers’ minds, you need to hold on to your position by delivering a
brand experience that’s so perfectly suited to customer desires and expecta-
tions that your clientele sees no reason to let any competing brand into the
space you fill.
Branding expert Walter Landor, the creative and strategic genius behind
many of the most famous brands you know today, is widely quoted for his
assertion that “Products are made in the factory, but brands are created in
the mind.” This chapter helps you find an available space to create your
brand in the minds of your customers.

The Marketing Muscle of Positioning
From playing with childhood puzzles, you know that you can’t force a square
peg into a round hole. You also can’t force a square peg into a space already
filled by another square peg, right? In order to fit a new peg into a puzzle, you
need to find an open space and fill it with a piece that matches up perfectly.
When you do, the piece drops effortlessly into the open slot and sits securely
in place.
The same principle applies to the human mind. You can’t fit an idea into a
customer’s mind unless it matches up with a need or desire that the cus-
tomer genuinely cares about and that isn’t already addressed perfectly by
another idea or offering.
Positioning is the process of finding an unfulfilled want or need in your cus-
tomer’s mind and filling it with a distinctively different and ideally suited
offering.
Finding a Position of Your Own: 
The Birthplace of Your Brand
To build a brand, you have to build a positive collection of perceptions in
your customers’ minds. As with any construction project, before you can
actually do the building, you have to select and prepare the site. That’s the
role positioning plays in the branding process.
Before you can define, identify, and launch your brand, you have to find the
position where your brand will live in your customers’ minds and hearts.
(Flip back to Chapter 2 for an illustration of the branding process and to see
how positioning paves the way for your brand definition and identity.)
As you seek your position, follow one of the following four most common
positioning approaches that we explain in this section.
Fulfill an unfilled need
Think of this as the find-an-itch-and-scratch-it approach. You study your cus-
tomer wants and needs, see a desire that isn’t addressed by any existing
product or service, and move quickly to beat any competitor to the solution.
78
Part II: Building a Brand, Step-by-Step 

The resulting brand, created in response to an existing desire, slides right
into an available slot in the customer’s mind — as long as you seize the open
position before anyone else stakes claim to it.
WeightWatchers is a great example of fulfilling a need. Founder Jean Nidetch
turned a living room conversation about how to lose weight into a brand
that’s now 40 years old and known around the world for its weekly support
group meetings that help customers lose weight and keep it off.
Specialize to create a new market niche
Marketers that follow this positioning route aim to provide the absolute best
solution to a very exclusive or narrow segment of the market. This approach
is the polar opposite of trying to be all things to all people. Specialty brands
exist in large, crowded fields; rather than trying to compete with the pack, 
a business finds a way to serve a well-defined portion of the market in a
uniquely attractive way. As a result, it creates a market niche, a select group
of customers who have similar wants and needs that have been overlooked
by competing businesses.
EasyJet created a market niche when the company set out to cater to the
cost-conscious, plan-it-yourself traveler with self-proclaimed “cheap flights.”
EasyJet called itself “Europe’s leading low-cost airline,” marketing to low-
budget, no-frills customers with the tagline “The Web’s favorite airline.”
Transform an established solution
This evolutionary approach to positioning involves taking a solution that cur-
rently exists in the marketplace and transforming it into a new solution that’s
so different that it spawns a whole new product category. Examples include
the transformation of computers into laptops, cars into electronic or hybrid
machines, and the coffee shop into an upscale European-style café experi-
ence, to name a few.
Creating a new solution to an already-addressed desire or need takes enor-
mous insight into the popular culture and plenty of marketing power to get
the word out. To succeed with this approach to positioning, you need to have
or hire people with the capability to spot fads and predict trends. You also
need plenty of money — both to evolve currently available products into a
new innovation and to promote the resulting new product with such velocity
and strength that you can lay claim to the first position in the new product
category before competitors have time to leap into the arena.

Chapter 5: Filling Your Niche: Positioning Your Brand

The iPod is a perfect example of this type of positioning. Apple responded 
to the market’s desires for miniaturization, maximum capacity, and mind-
boggling design in 2001. Apple CEO Steve Jobs unveiled the iPod as a Mac-
compatible product that puts “1,000 songs in your pocket.” By 2005, the iPod
was the best-selling digital audio player in the world and an essential acces-
sory in the minds of people who had never before even considered carrying
their music around with them.
Discover an all-new solution
Creating an all-new product or service to fill a want or need that no else has
even noticed or thought to address is the revolutionary approach to brand-
ing. All-new solutions come from the minds of people who see the same prob-
lems everyone else sees, but they ignore conventional thinking and come up
with entirely new solutions. Most brand-new brand ideas are built upon exist-
ing ideas; a few examples are car radios, TV dinners, and exercise bikes.
Gaining a market position, awareness, and adoption for a brand-new idea
takes patience and a massive marketing investment. After all, you’re not just
introducing a product, you’re introducing a whole new paradigm for which
the market may or may not be ready.
The Segway Human Transporter is a great example of this revolutionary
approach to branding. It was introduced by inventor Dean Kamen in 2001 to
“transform a person into an empowered pedestrian” and to create a whole
new way to move people on “fun, smart transportation.”
Figuring Out What You Do 
Better Than Anyone Else
The key to your market position is your point of difference, also called your
point of distinction or your unique selling proposition (USP).
Your unique attributes are what set you apart from your competitors and
attract clients to your offering. Without clearly defined and communicated
distinctions, people basically view a product as a commodity chosen simply
for its availability or lowest price and easily passed over for any similar offer-
ing that seems to fill the same bill with less effort or expense. (See Chapter 2
for plenty of information on commodities.)
80
Part II: Building a Brand, Step-by-Step 

To avoid the one-is-as-good-as-another trap, take these steps:
 Find something true about yourself, your business, or your product
that can define and differentiate you while also addressing a genuine
market interest or need.
 Make customers aware of the unique benefits or value that they
receive only when they work with your business or buy your product.
For example, take note the next time you’re invited to participate in a
taste test, when you watch an ad showing how much better one paper
towel sops up moisture over another, or when you see before-and-after
photos proving a product’s effectiveness. These demonstrations are
ways that marketers work to make you aware of the unique advantages
that only their products deliver.
 Reinforce your positive point of difference every single time the cus-
tomer encounters your name, your product, or your staff or in any
other way comes into contact with your brand experience.
Just being different isn’t enough for a successful positioning strategy. An
automobile manufacturer that introduces the only car to burn gasoline at a
rate of one gallon every two miles has a point of distinction but no point of
attraction. To position your brand, you need both attraction and distinction.
 The attraction comes from providing values and attributes that cus-
tomers genuinely want or need.
 The distinction comes from providing values and attributes that cus-
tomers can only receive when they work with your business or buy your
product.
In order to win a meaningful, distinctive position in the market, you need to
shine a spotlight on your most outstanding attributes. So what are they?
To conduct a self-assessment of your offering, use the worksheet in Figure 5-1.
(If you need help digging up the information you need, flip back to Chapter 4.)
Enter your company’s greatest strengths in the left-hand column. Then use
the following columns to enter assessments of how well you, your management
team, your staff, and your customers feel that your offering distinguishes
your business and set you apart in your competitive marketplace. When you
see a resounding “best” across the board, you know you’ve landed on an
attribute of distinction.

Chapter 5: Filling Your Niche: Positioning Your Brand

Deciding Which Customers 
You Serve the Best
Positioning involves focusing — not just on what you do best but also on the
market segment you serve best. Instead of trying to please all people in all
ways, great brands please some people — a defined segment of market — in
an extraordinary way because of the unique and meaningful attributes and
experiences the brands offer.

Chapter 5: Filling Your Niche: Positioning Your Brand

Finding Your Place in the 
Competitive Landscape
To position your brand, you need to look at how your offering fits within your
competitive landscape, including
 How your customers think your offering ranks
 How you think your offering ranks
In a perfect branding world, your customers’ beliefs and perceptions about
your offering match precisely with what you believe to be your brand’s distin-
guishing characteristics and attributes. However, for all but the best-built and
best-managed brands, the matchup is less than perfect. In fact, you’re proba-
bly holding this book because you sense a gap between what you think
makes you different and better and how you think your offering is perceived
in your marketplace.
If people misunderstand your brand, you can’t just wave a magic wand to
change their minds. You have to move strategically from the position your
brand currently occupies in customers’ minds to where you want it to be.
You also have to be sure that the position you want your brand to hold in the
marketplace isn’t already taken by some other brand.
Putting your brand on the positioning map
Use a positioning matrix like the one illustrated in Figure 5-3 as you work to
determine where your brand fits in your competitive landscape.
Figure 5-3 shows how Di Lusso Bakery Café, a client of Bill’s company, Brand
Navigation, mapped its position in its competitive environment of coffee
shops and casual eateries. Using a framework that plotted competitors based
on type of customer experience (ranging from global brand to local cafe) and
café atmosphere (ranging from old world to contemporary), Di Lusso deter-
mined that its desired brand position was more old-world and more local
than its two major competitors.
Create a similar map for your brand using attributes that matter most in your
competitive arena. For instance, a specialty food products brand may position
competitive offerings along axis lines based on food preferences (traditional to
gourmet) and pricing (affordable to premium). A ski resort may position com-
petitive offerings along axis lines based on type of ski experience (one-day
recreation to destination resort) and price (affordable to premium).
84
Part II: Building a Brand, Step-by-Step 

If you’re creating a branding strategy for an existing brand, as you place your
brand on your positioning matrix, be reasonable about the position it cur-
rently holds in the minds of your customers. Moving your brand from its cur-
rent position to a new position isn’t like moving furniture. You can’t just pick
your brand up and slot it into a new space. Your customers — not you —
move your brand to a new position based on the impressions they receive
consistently over time. To change your market position, you need to build
upon what customers currently believe by conveying messages, making
impressions, and delivering experiences that logically move your brand
toward your desired competitive position. The chapters in Part III help you
plan your repositioning strategy and get the word out.
Determining your point of difference
Your point of difference determines your position in your competitive environ-
ment. It defines the precise segment of the market that you serve best and
how your offering is distinctively unique from that of businesses or products
that provide similar but different solutions and experiences.

Chapter 5: Filling Your Niche: Positioning Your Brand

Many businesses, especially many small businesses that desperately want to
increase sales, try to make their products attractive to anyone and everyone.
They’re afraid to pinpoint their distinctions or target precise market seg-
ments for fear that they’ll miss sales opportunities. In fact, the reverse is
true. If you can’t tell customers what you do best, they have no reason to
choose your offering. If you try to tell them you’re best at everything, your
claim isn’t very credible.
Before you begin the process of putting your brand into words (see Chapter 6),
you need to define your point of difference in your competitive environment.
Use the following template:
[Name of your business, product, or service] is the [your distinction and the
generic term for your type of offering] to provide [your unique features or
benefits] to [your customer profile] who choose our offering in order to
feel [your customers’ emotional outcome].
In this statement, your distinction may be along the lines of “best,” “first,”
“only,” “most-recommended,” or “highest-ranking.” The generic term for 
your type of offering may be “café,” “mouthwash,” “how-to manual,” 
86
Part II: Building a Brand, Step-by-Step 
Package your position as an experience
In any competitive arena, a number of brands
compete for the same space on the positioning
matrix by claiming to be the friendliest, to have
the highest quality, to offer the lowest prices, or
to excel in any other attribute you can think of.
Yet one brand prevails and wins recognition from
the marketplace, mystifying all the competitors
who truly think and can even prove that their
attributes in the area of distinction are better.
So what tips the customer’s perception toward
one competitor and away from the others? As in
most other things in life, firsthand experience
trumps all other forms of communication. In spite
of the fact that a number of competitors offer
similar services, prices, or quality, in each arena,
one brand delivers an experience that expresses
the attribute in such a way that customers
believe it to be the best. And that belief gets rein-
forced every time the customer encounters the
brand in any way or at any time.
As you define your unique point of difference
and stake your position, create an experience
that allows your customer to feel the difference
firsthand. For example, if you say that your 
position is economy, create a warehouse envi-
ronment and experience. If your position is
exclusivity, create an exclusive experience that
includes individualized service and second-to-
none responsiveness.
The brands that win the positioning war are
those that get their strategy right, convey their
distinguishing attributes with utter consistency,
and deliver an experience that differentiates
them from all the others. Help your customers
constantly experience your difference, and your
unique position is reaffirmed every time the cus-
tomer brushes up against it.

“homebuilder,” “sports drink,” or “Web designer.” Examples of customer pro-
files include “local residents with global mindsets,” “upwardly mobile young
professionals seeking enhanced status,”and “parents wanting to provide their
children with opportunity and enrichment.” Finally, your customers’ emo-
tional outcome may be “secure,” “successful,” “self-confident,” or “indulged.”
No copycats! Avoiding the 
fate of a me-too brand
This section is brief because the headline just about says it all. A me-too
brand is one that offers exactly what another brand offers with no distinctive
attributes other than the fact that it’s presented by a different marketer.
If you try to slot your brand into a market or mind position already taken 
by a competitor, you face a long and tough uphill battle. Trying to unseat a
competitor requires that you convince customers to move away from their
current choice first. Only then can you convince them to move toward your
offering. That’s double the marketing work with half the assurance of market-
ing success. After all, telling customers that what they believe is wrong is a
slow way to make friends and influence perceptions.
An equally bad idea is trying to leverage off someone else’s brand. By likening
your brand to someone else’s, all you do is cast a spotlight on a competitor
and point out your own second-string position.
The best alternative is to find your own position by filling an unfilled need,
specializing to serve a market segment or niche, or creating an all-new solu-
tion. (Flip back to the section “Finding a Position of Your Own: The Birthplace
of Your Brand” earlier in this chapter for a rundown of these approaches.)
Testing and Protecting Your Position
As soon as you’re clear about your customer profile, your place in your com-
petitive environment, and the point of difference that sets you apart and pro-
vides customers a reason to buy from you and you alone, you’re ready to
write your positioning statement. A positioning statement describes your
offering, your market, and the point of difference or unique distinction that
sets your offering apart from competing alternatives.
Your positioning statement defines the niche that only your offering fills in
the marketplace and the distinction that you’ll highlight in all marketing
efforts. Your positioning statement isn’t a public announcement; rather, it’s
87
Chapter 5: Filling Your Niche: Positioning Your Brand

an internal marketing compass. After you establish your positioning state-
ment, use it within your company to guide all your branding and marketing
communication efforts.
Before writing your positioning statement, answer these questions:
 Is your point of difference unique and hard for a competitor to duplicate?
 Do your distinctions or differences truly matter to your customers?
 Does your offering synch well with economic and cultural trends?
 Will customers believe your claims about your offering? Why should they
believe you? Can you support or prove your claim?
If you can answer “yes” to these questions, it’s time to sharpen your pencil or
open your word processing program to start writing your positioning state-
ment. Your positioning statement should contain the following points, in
order:
1. Name of your company or product
2. Your business description
3. A summary of your point of difference
4. Your customer profile
Here’s an example positioning statement: Valley Homes home construction is
the first company to build energy-efficient, custom-designed, affordable homes
for Central Valley residents seeking to build quality, one-of-a-kind residences on
the homesites of their choice.
After writing your positioning statement, evaluate its accuracy by asking
 Is it believable?
 Is it consistent with what people who know your business believe to be
true about you, the way you operate, and the benefits you deliver?
 Can you consistently deliver the distinct attributes as they’re stated?
 Can you package and deliver your point of difference with such consis-
tency that, every single time customers encounter your brand, your dis-
tinction is reinforced and the experience reminds customers of why they
chose and remain loyal to your brand?
Steer clear of positioning landmines by making sure that your positioning
statement avoids these problem areas:
88
Part II: Building a Brand, Step-by-Step 

 Be sure that no other brand already owns the position you’re trying to
claim.
 Be sure that your point of difference is one you can protect. For instance,
don’t base your position on having the lowest price because a competi-
tor can always best you on that front.
 Be sure that you don’t build your position around an attribute you can’t
control, such as being the “only provider of XYZ service.” Unless you
can set up a barrier to entry by competitors through a license or some
other protection, you leave yourself vulnerable to having the very
attribute you built your brand upon eroded by a quick move by a new
player in your game.
When your positioning statement passes these tests, you’ve found a place to
build your brand. Congratulations! Now you can start putting your brand
promise and brand definition into words (see Chapter 6).

Putting Your Brand into Words
In This Chapter
 Knowing your business mission and vision
 Defining your brand
B
uilding a brand and building a home have two things in common: Both
need a site to occupy — a house lot in the case of a home and a market
position in the case of a brand — and both require a plan that you can follow
in order to achieve the desired outcome.
The process of finding a place to build your brand both in your marketplace
and in your customers’ minds is called positioning; it’s the first important
step in branding and the topic of Chapter 5. Planning the brand you intend to
create is what this chapter is all about.
In this chapter, we help you lay the foundation for a brand that accurately
reflects the essence of what you stand for and how you operate. We begin
with a look at your mission and vision statements (and help you write state-
ments if you don’t already have them). Next, we help you define the promise
you make to all who deal with you and your organization. After that, we guide
the crafting of your brand identity statement and your core brand message.
Finally, we help you write the brand character statement that influences all
expressions of your brand — your name, logo, tagline, advertising, Web site,
the products and services you offer, the staff you assemble, the customer
experience you deliver, and the reputation you develop as a result.
Dusting Off Your Business Vision,
Mission, and Values
Your brand is a reflection of what you stand for, so it has to align perfectly
with the values and purpose of your business or organization.
If you’re unclear about what your business is, why it exists, who it serves,
and what it promises, this section is especially for you. It’s also a must-read if

you have a good sense of your vision and mission but haven’t yet committed
anything to writing. This is the time to put ink on paper.
To arrive at a brand that perfectly reflects the essence of your company, you
need to write three essential statements:
 Your vision statement, which defines your long-term aspirations. It
explains why you’re doing what you’re doing and the ultimate good you
want to achieve through your success. Think of your vision as the pic-
ture of where you ultimately want your work to lead you.
 Your mission statement, which defines the purpose of your company
and the effect you intend to have on the world around you. It states
what you do for others and the approach you follow in order to achieve
the aspirations you’ve set for yourself, your organization, or your busi-
ness. Think of your mission as the route you’ll follow to achieve your
vision.
 Your business promise, which summarizes the positive difference you
deliver to all who deal with your organization. Internally, your business
promise guides the development of all elements of your brand.
Externally, your business promise is sometimes translated into and pre-
sented as a motto or tagline.
For an example of how a vision and mission translate into a tagline, consider
the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, an organization working to cure a genetic 
disease that affects approximately 30,000 children and adults in the United
States. The Foundation’s brand statements are as follows:
 Vision: To identify the resources and people needed to cure cystic 
fibrosis.
 Mission: To assure the development of the means to cure and control
cystic fibrosis and to improve the quality of life for those with the disease.
 Brand tagline: Adding tomorrows every day.
Use the information in the following sections to write statements that guide
your organization and the development of your brand.
Refocusing your vision
Your brand is the tangible expression of your vision. It’s the banner that
waves what you’re passionate about and what you aspire to achieve. Just as
the images on a country’s flag symbolize the core of what is important to that
culture and nation, your brand symbolizes the core of what’s important to
you and your organization.
92
Part II: Building a Brand, Step-by-Step 

Whether you’ve written it down or not, you probably have a vision of the good
that you, your business, or your organization hopes to achieve in your world.
Likewise, you probably have a set of principles and values that guide how you
operate and what you are and aren’t willing to do to achieve success.
As a prerequisite to writing your brand identity statement (see “Mission
Possible: Defining Your Brand” later in this chapter), put your values and
vision into words. Your values and vision are fundamental to what your busi-
ness is and stands for, and therefore they’re essential to the brand image
that’s reflected to the public.
The values you value
Start by clarifying your values — your beliefs about your responsibility to
your employees, clients, business associates, and community. The worksheet
in Figure 6-1 can guide your thinking.
Your statement of values can take the form of a simple list that declares the
principles that steer your company. For example, the Whole Foods Web site
dedicates a page to a list of the company’s core values, including the following:
 Selling the highest quality natural and organic products possible
 Satisfying and delighting our customers
 Supporting team member happiness and excellence
VALUES WORKSHEET
Use the provided values as a point from which to launch your thinking as you list 
all the values that steer your decision-making and the direction of your organization. 
After you compile a list of all values you believe play a significant role in your business 
decisions  and plans, put a check mark alongside the few that you feel take precedence 
over all others.

Chapter 6: Putting Your Brand into Words

 Creating wealth through profits and growth
 Caring about our communities and our environment
Envisioning your highest hopes and aspirations
Your vision statement puts into a single sentence the reason your business
exists. Regardless of whether you move offices, make operational changes,
update your logo, revise your marketing message, or undertake any number
of other strategic or tactical changes, the vision of what you’re aiming to
achieve, the good you intend to do in your world, should remain stable.
Many organizations post their vision statements on their corporate Web
sites. Following are a few examples:
 Habitat For Humanity Australia: A world where everyone has a decent
place to live.
 Boys & Girls Clubs of Canada: Leading the way to a brighter future for
Canada’s children and youth.
 Volvo Car Corporation: To be the world’s most desired and successful
premium car brand.
 Virginia Tech: To do things that matter and that have a profound impact
on our changing world — whether it is in the classroom, the laboratory,
or a village in a developing country.
As you develop your own vision statement, take some time to answer these
questions:
 Why do you and those in your organization get up and go to work every
day? You could earn a living at any number of places, so what is it about
your organization that keeps you loyal and motivated?
 Ultimately, what good are you aiming to affect in your world? What last-
ing difference do you want to make?
 What ultimate benefits do your products and services deliver?
Use your answers to compile a short vision statement that summarizes what
you feel is the highest purpose of your business.
Building your brand on the strong 
back of your business mission
Your vision is your ultimate dream; your mission is how you’ll achieve your
aspirations.
94
Part II: Building a Brand, Step-by-Step 

As you can see from the two examples in this section, there’s no one format
to follow in writing your business mission. All that really matters is that your
mission statement covers the following points:
 The products or services you provide
 Who you serve
 How you are unique
 What benefits or greater good you promise
As an example, consider the vision of the Boys & Girls Clubs of Canada:
Leading the way to a brighter future for Canada’s children and youth. A brighter
future for children and youth is the organization’s ultimate aspiration. The
road map to get there is contained in the organization’s supporting mission
statement: The mission of all Boys and Girls Clubs of Canada is to provide a
safe, supportive place where children and youth can experience new opportuni-
ties, overcome barriers, build positive relationships, and develop confidence
and skills for life.
As you write your own statement, don’t get hung up on the format or on the
idea that your statement has to look just like anyone else’s. For instance, look
at how different the mission of the Boys & Girls Club is from the mission of
the Peace Corps, which reads:
Three simple goals comprise the Peace Corps mission:
1. Helping the people of interested countries in meeting their needs for
trained men and women.
2. Helping promote a better understanding of Americans on the part of
the people served.
3. Helping promote a better understanding of other peoples on the part
of all Americans.
As you begin to strengthen your mission statement or write one for the first
time, the worksheet shown in Figure 6-2 can help. It presents questions to
help focus your thinking before providing a framework into which you can
enter the components of your statement.
As you polish your statement into its final form, use language and a format
that reflects the nature and tone of your business. Some statements are
formal, and some are relaxed; some are short, and some are long. No matter
how your mission statement looks or sounds, be sure to
 Avoid jargon. Instead, use language that anyone inside or outside your
company can easily understand.
 Avoid generalizations in favor of specific descriptions. Rather than say
“We serve elderly Americans,” say “We serve elderly, recently widowed
Americans who are living independently in their own homes.”
95
Chapter 6: Putting Your Brand into Words

 Show passion. Write your mission statement in a way that inspires
others to want to come on board and be part of the good work you’re
doing.
Polishing your business promise
Your business promise is the pledge upon which you build your brand and
stake your reputation. It’s what you assure those who come into contact with
your business — whether as employees, suppliers, investors, associates, or
customers — that they can count on you to deliver. It’s the expectation that
you live up to every time people experience your brand, whether through
advertising, promotions, buying experiences, service encounters, or any
other contact.

Part II: Building a Brand, Step-by-Step 

Your promise is the essence of your brand. Don’t make the common mistake
of thinking that your logo is your brand identity. Your logo is a visual repre-
sentation of your brand and an important element of your brand identity, but
it’s just one component. When people think of your brand, they may visualize
your logo, but your promise is what motivates them in your direction.
While-you-wait service is a promise. The best on-time arrival record is a
promise. “You’ll never wait in line” is a promise. “You’re a name, not a
number” is a promise. Each one puts a company’s reputation on the line by
assuring that the brand will live up to the high expectations it sets for itself,
or else. The promise becomes an internal rallying call for excellence and a
magnet for new business.
Your promise is essential to your branding strategy. If you’re not already sure
of the promise you make to all who deal with your business, consider these
questions:
 Why do customers choose your business? What do they seek from you
that they can’t get elsewhere?
 How do you think your most satisfied customers describe your products
or services? What words do they use when they pay compliments or
when they fill out satisfaction surveys?
 How do you think your most satisfied customers describe the feeling
they get when they work with your business? Would they use words
like “efficient,” “fun,” “friendly,” “competent,” “creative,” “convenient,”
“reliable,” “exciting,” “amazing,” or others?
 What attributes of your company do you think customers like best and
would find the hardest to replace if your business weren’t available
to them?
 If customers had to choose one word or phrase that describes what they
consistently expect and receive from your company, what would it be?
Answer these questions on your own, ask managers and staff members to
answer them, and then go to a few key customers and ask for their input.
Explain what you’re up to. Tell them that, as part of your branding strategy,
you’re clarifying the way your business promise is interpreted in the market,
and you’d appreciate their responses to the preceding questions.
When you’re done with your analysis, take these steps:
1. List all the reasons customers choose your business and the attributes
they count on only your company to deliver.
2. Circle all the attributes you’re confident that you can deliver consis-
tently and upon which you’re willing to stake your reputation.
97
Chapter 6: Putting Your Brand into Words

3. Put a check mark next to those attributes that are compelling to cus-
tomers and to your internal team — the ones you can rally behind
and take pride in offering.
4. Take the checked items and make a short list of business attributes
that are most assured, most compelling, most believable, and most
consistent with the character of your company.
Your final list of business attributes provides the basis upon which to form
your business promise. Following are a few examples to get you started:
 Sony Ericsson: “Sony Ericsson will always deliver the best mobile busi-
ness experience. That is our promise to you.”
 BMW: “Sheer driving pleasure.”
 Wal-Mart: “Always low prices. Always.”
 John Deere: “You can count on equipment that’s as productive as possi-
ble. Up and ready to work when you are. And designed to minimize your
daily operating costs. Nothing runs like a Deere.”
 Umpqua Bank (a Northwest boutique bank): “Serious about service.”
No one likes someone who breaks promises. As you put your promise into
words, make sure it’s one you can deliver upon consistently every single time
people come into contact with your brand, whether as customers, employ-
ees, suppliers, associates, or prospects. Staying true to your word and con-
sistently upholding your promise is essential to building business trust and
loyalty.
Beginning with your point of difference (see Chapter 5), use the following
template to write the business promise you’ll incorporate into your branding
strategy.
[Name of your business, product, or service] is the [your distinction and the
generic term for your type of offering] to provide [your unique features or
benefits] to [your customer profile] who choose our offering in order to
feel [your customers’ emotional outcome].
We consistently deliver the unique attributes and benefits our customers
count on, and we promise our customers [the promise customers can
absolutely count on from your company].
Defining your brand character
Your brand character is like the personality of your brand. Some brands are
serious or even somber, and some are whimsical, fun, or playful. Some
brands are youthful, and some are like silver-haired sages.
98
Part II: Building a Brand, Step-by-Step 

As a first step in defining your brand character, ask yourself this question:
How would your brand be described if it were a person who walked into the
room? Sophisticated? Fashionable? Flamboyant? Reserved? Important?
Playful? Or one of countless other descriptions? Keep your answer in mind
as you go through the rest of this section.
As you define your brand character, realize that the character you convey
must be an accurate reflection of your business vision, mission, values, and
promise.
If your brand character, which is reflected through the look and tone of your
brand expressions, is inconsistent with what your company actually is and
stands for, you’ll face two problems.
 Your brand expressions will roam all over the map, serious at one time
and playful at another depending on the mood and whim of whoever is
producing them, and you’ll wind up with a schizophrenic brand identity
as a result.
 The brand identity you project into the marketplace will be inconsistent
with the brand experience people encounter when they actually contact
your business, leading to a lack of credibility and a poor reputation.
Follow these steps to write a brand character statement that guides the
development of all expressions of your brand:
1. Review your vision statement to refocus on the highest aspirations of
your business.
2. Review the top values you support.
3. Review the promise you make in your marketplace.
4. Based on your vision, values, and promise, write a one-sentence
brand character statement.
Use the following format: Our brand is [insert a description of the charac-
ter of your brand], a trait we reflect through brand expressions that are
[insert a description of the mood and tone that all your marketing will 
project].
If you have difficulty defining your character, ask yourself these questions:
 If you were to compare your business to a car, what car would it be, 
and why?
 If you were to compare your business to an actor or actress, who would
it be, and why?
99
Chapter 6: Putting Your Brand into Words

Your answers help you determine words and personality traits that define the
character of your business and brand and steer the creation of all brand
expressions within and outside your company.
From your name and logo to the way your staff dresses, the look of your sur-
roundings, your marketing materials, and the experience you provide, all con-
tacts with your brand should reinforce a single mood, tone, and personality.
Mission Possible: Defining Your Brand
Your brand identity statement, also called your brand definition, shrinks all
your thoughts about your business mission, values, and promise into a 
concise statement that defines what you do, how you differ from all other
similar solutions, and what you pledge to deliver to those who deal with 
your business.
Your completed brand identity statement serves as the steering wheel for
your branding strategy. It influences every turn you make in presenting your
brand — from giving it a name and logo to producing ads and marketing
materials to creating the experience that customers will encounter when 
they come into contact with your brand from any direction.
What to incorporate
As you write your brand identity statement, be sure that it reflects the follow-
ing information:
 The three things you want people to know about your business:
• What you offer
• Who you serve
• How you’re best at what you do
 Your point of difference (how you serve your target market differently
and better than all other options)
 Your business promise that will be upheld through all brand experiences
 Your brand character or personality that will be communicated through
the mood and tone projected in all brand expressions
100
Part II: Building a Brand, Step-by-Step 

The anatomy of a brand identity statement
Your brand identity is the face of your brand. It includes your name, logo,
tagline or slogan, advertising, marketing materials, signage, and every other
way that you express your brand in your business and in your marketplace.
Your brand identity statement defines your brand identity. It describes the
people your brand must relate to, the attributes it must highlight, and the
promise and character it must convey. To write a brand identity statement
that guides your branding strategy, use this format:
[Your name] promises [your target market] that they can count on us for
[your unique attribute or benefit] delivered with [information about the
character, tone, and mood you convey].
Grading your statement
Before accepting your brand identity statement as the one that will guide
your branding strategy, see if you can answer “yes” to these three questions:
 Does the statement illuminate your difference? Does it make it clear how
you differ from other solutions in your business arena?
 Is the statement customer-centric? Does it clarify what you provide and
promise to others rather than what you aspire for yourself?
 Can you project the statement with a unified voice across all markets
and media? And can you fulfill its promise through every contact with
your business and as part of the overall customer experience with your
brand?
Putting your brand identity 
statement to the test
After you commit your brand identity statement to paper, it’s time to test it
internally within your business and with key customer groups.
In personal meetings and focus group sessions, confirm that the brand iden-
tity statement you’ve crafted resonates with those who work with and buy
from your business. (For information on conducting research, turn to
Chapter 4.) In this final test, probe the following questions:
101
Chapter 6: Putting Your Brand into Words

 Is the promise you make the same as the promise customers count on
from your business?
• Do people believe that your business consistently delivers on its
promise?
• Do they believe that the promise is upheld through all contact
points, including your physical place of business, phone greeting,
online presence, customer service, return policies, staff members,
communications, and every other way in which you interact with
those in your market?
• If they were to explain to someone else the promise your business
makes, how would they express it?
 Are the unique attributes or benefits highlighted in your brand identity
statement consistent with those that others most associate with your
business?
 Is the character that you’ve summarized in your brand identity state-
ment consistent with the character that others believe you exude?
 If you uncover slight differences between the promise, benefits, and
character defined in your brand identity statement and the attributes
others believe to be true about your business, what adjustments to your
business would align the two mindsets?
If your brand will serve a concise, easy-to-reach, and relatively small market,
you can test your brand identity statement on your own, using the research
advice presented in Chapter 4. For brands that serve larger markets or face
major competition from established and recognized brands, invest in profes-
sional assistance to test your statement before putting it to work as you
name your brand, design its logo and tagline, and create the marketing mate-
rials and brand experience that will present it day in and day out in your
market.

I
f you haven’t yet named your brand, you just opened to what may be the
most important chapter in this book.
Naming your brand is by far the most challenging, momentous, and neces-
sary phase in the process of branding. Before you can proceed to develop a
brand identity, you need a name that’s appropriate, available, appealing, and
enduring. Truly, naming a brand is as important — and as difficult — as
naming a baby.
Other elements of your brand — including your logo, tagline, and color
scheme — may evolve over time, but your name will remain constant. From
the day you announce your name, it’s the key that unlocks your brand image
in the minds of your consumers.
This chapter sheds light on the value of your brand name, how to recognize
the characteristics of a good name, and how to come up with and protect a
name that works well from the start and long into your successful future.
What’s In a Name?
The right name distinguishes you from all other businesses, and ideally, it
establishes your personality, brand character, market position, and the
nature of your offering. The very best name accomplishes the following
objectives:

104
Part II: Building a Brand, Step-by-Step 
 It reflects the brand character you want your business to project.
 It’s descriptive of your offering.
 It creates an association to the meaning of your brand.
 It’s easy and pleasant to say.
 It’s unique and memorable.
Not all great names score a ten in all areas, but nearly every good name
scores on most fronts, and only a rare few successful names strike out com-
pletely on any one of the preceding characteristics. In this section, we help
guide your selection — or creation — of a name that meets the criteria for
your brand.
What the right name does
The right name establishes your brand from the day you announce it and
grows with your business and your vision as you evolve into a larger, more
established organization that possibly reaches into new market areas, new
geographic regions, and even new product areas.
In the same way you wouldn’t want to give a baby a name that doesn’t transi-
tion to adulthood, you don’t want to give your brand a name that hinders
your development in the future. For that reason, most forward-thinking mar-
keters avoid names like First Avenue Dry Cleaning, for instance, unless
they’re absolutely certain that they’ll always be on First Avenue and that
they’ll always focus on dry cleaning as their primary offering.
In choosing your name, the following three criteria weigh heavier than all
others:
 Your name should convey or support your brand image.
 Your name should convey or be consistent with your brand promise.
 Your name should have the capability to appreciate as an asset that can
be harvested through premium pricing, through licensing, or even
through the sale of shares in your business or the outright sale of your
brand name to a future owner.
Conveys or implies your brand image
If you’re at all unclear about your desired brand image, flip back to Chapter 6,
which leads you through the process of crafting the brand identity statement
that steers all decisions regarding the expression of your brand and the
image you create in the marketplace.

Your brand identity statement follows this framework:
[Your business] promises [your target market] that they can count on
us for [unique attribute or benefit] delivered with [information about the
character, tone, and mood you convey].
Write down your brand identity statement and commit to it before beginning
the naming process. By defining your brand first, you can select a name that’s
consistent with the three elements of your brand identity statement: your
target market, your promise, and the tone and mood used to consistently
convey the character of your business.
A name that doesn’t directly or obviously reflect your brand identity 
statement — that doesn’t obviously convey or imply the nature of your target
market, your brand promise, or your brand character — can turn out to be a
spectacularly strong brand name if (and this is a big if) you’re willing and
able to invest the marketing budget to win market awareness, acceptance,
105
Chapter 7: Naming Your Brand
Bending the brand name rules, at a price
Some businesses inherit, live with, or even
choose names that go against some or all the
textbook criteria for a great brand name — and
they end up with great brands anyway. How do
they do it? They invest marketing time and
money to build a story around their names, and
in the process they build affection, loyalty, and
equity for names that, without significant mar-
keting support, would have probably made it
into Chapter 21 of this book as examples of
branding mistakes to avoid.
An outstanding and well-known example is the
brand name Smucker’s. In 1897, Jerome Monroe
Smucker started pressing the fruit from Johnny
Appleseed’s tree plantings at his Ohio mill and
selling the resulting fruit products from the back
of a horse-drawn wagon. Before long, Smucker’s
name became associated with his personal
guarantee of product quality, a promise that
evolved over the years into the hallmark of a
brand that’s now distributed worldwide and
ranks as North America’s market leader in the
categories of jams, jellies, preserves, and a
range of other specialty items.
Of and by itself, the Smucker’s name would
hardly pass most brand name tests or research
studies. But over time and with excellent mar-
keting, the name has become a renowned
brand success story. To quote from company lit-
erature: “We still proudly display our name on
every jar because . . . with a name like
Smucker’s, it has to be good.”
Note: Before bending the rules to give your
brand a name that doesn’t quickly and clearly
convey your brand in a pleasant and easy-to-
recall manner, realize that you’ll need to invest
heavily in marketing efforts to create the asso-
ciations that don’t stem naturally from your
name choice.

and enthusiasm for what it means. As proof, consider names such as Apple,
Google, Amazon, and Yahoo!, along with a good many of today’s other best-
known brands. The names themselves don’t convey promises or differentiate
offerings, yet they label today’s megabrands thanks to terrific awareness-
building and brand management programs that have injected the names with
meaning in consumers’ minds.
At the other end of the spectrum, consider great brand names like Internet
Explorer, Dunkin’ Donuts, and Mail Boxes, Etc., which instantaneously convey
their brand purposes even to those who may have never heard the names
before.
Either approach works, but the smaller your marketing budget, the wiser
you are to settle on a brand name that automatically conveys your brand
essence. Doing so allows you to avoid the costly need for extensive market
education to create meaning for your name.
Advances your brand promise
Your brand name should convey, imply, or support your brand promise.
There’s no hard-and-fast rule about the degree to which your name must
reveal your promise. However, if your name only hints at what you do and
offer, then you’d better be prepared to invest marketing time, effort, and
money to tell the story not communicated by your name.
Some brands clearly put the brand promise right into the brand name. Well-
known examples include:
 Jiffy Lube service centers
 DieHard automotive batteries
 Terminix pest control
 Krusteaz easy-to-make pie crust mix
 Lean Cuisine entrees
 Powerade sports drink
 Coppertone suncare products
 Miracle-Gro plant food
 Seattle’s Best coffee
 Ziploc storage bags
 Clear Eyes eye drops
106
Part II: Building a Brand, Step-by-Step 

Some brands imply the promise that customers can count on through names
that are completely consistent with the benefits they deliver. Examples
include:
 Gymboree: The celebration of childhood
 Victoria’s Secret: Romantic, stylish, and feminine lingerie
 Foot Locker: Athletic footwear and apparel
 Sunkist: Quality, fresh-tasting, better-for-you citrus products
 The Home Depot: One-stop shopping for home improvement and con-
struction
 Legalzoom: A law firm specializing in low-cost divorce services that calls
itself the nation’s leading online legal service
Still other names neither convey nor imply the brand promise. Instead, they
support the brand’s commitment by being consistent in character and pre-
sentation to the brand’s offering. Here are a couple examples:
 Yahoo!: The name doesn’t say or imply “search engine” or “Web host-
ing,” and it doesn’t convey a brand promise. Instead, the name paves the
way for an online experience that’s fast, fun, and successful.
 Pier One: The name doesn’t say or imply “distinct, casual home furnish-
ings and décor at a good value,” which is what the company promises.
Instead, it conjures up the idea of an environment where customers can,
in the company’s words, “discover the ‘spice’ they need to personalize
their homes.”
Regardless of whether your promise is directly presented, implied, or simply
supported through your brand name, make sure it’s pegged to a commitment
that’s small enough to keep but big enough to grow with your business. You
can probably think of a brand that promised to be the “hometown” business
only to chase opportunity in a nearby market area where, eventually, the
headquarters moved and the hometown promise evaporated.
Becomes an asset
Good brand names accumulate value that pays off in a number of ways.
 As a well-managed brand gains awareness, its promise becomes trusted,
and that trust carries a value for which consumers are willing to pay a
premium, leading to stronger sales and higher profits.
 As a well-managed brand gains market recognition, it becomes valued by
other marketers who want to cross-promote with or even license the
brand name to benefit from its strong and positive image, leading to
marketing and business opportunities.
107
Chapter 7: Naming Your Brand

 As a well-managed brand grows into a market success story, others want
to own part of it, leading to a public offering or outright purchase of the
brand, at which time the original brand builder can harvest the brand’s
value through a complete or partial sale.
For advice on leveraging your brand’s value, see Chapter 16. But first, put
yourself in position to build your brand into an asset by following these
naming tips:
 Give your brand a name that can grow and live for years.
• Avoid names that limit your product range. Unless you’re
absolutely certain that you’ll never want to sell anything other
than lamps, for instance, be careful about calling yourself The
Lamp Store.
• Give your brand some geographic elbow room. The advantages
of not tying your name to a single geographic region are twofold.
By avoiding a name like Milwaukee Printing Services, you allow
your business to open into new market areas without the burden
of an out-of-town name or the need for a new name altogether, and
you keep yourself out of the lineup of all the other business names
that start with Milwaukee in the local phone directory.
 Especially if you think you may want to sell your business in the
future, give your brand a name that isn’t your own (referred to as Me,
Inc. in the branding business). At the time of sale, a good portion of
your brand equity resides in goodwill, which is the positive value of your
name and reputation. If your brand name is your name, the new owners
will probably want rename it, and they’ll want to pay less as a result.
 Give your brand a name that’s unique, memorable, and easy to recall.
When naming happens
Most brands get their names at one of the following three times:
 When a new business or product is being introduced for the first time
This is when most brands are named and is likely the situation you’re
facing as you read this book.
 When an existing business or product wants to face its future with a
new name that isn’t burdened with a negative connotation
For example, Kentucky Fried Chicken renamed itself KFC, freeing it to
market offerings beyond the range of fried foods and chicken. Another
example is Phillip Morris, which became Altria to distance itself from its
tobacco heritage.
108
Part II: Building a Brand, Step-by-Step 

 When an existing business or product wants to embrace growth
opportunities precluded by the limiting nature of its existing name
For example, Federal Express became FedEx, giving itself a shorter name
that better exemplifies the company’s speed promise while at the same
time deemphasizing the word “federal” to better reflect the brand’s
worldwide market. Likewise, the plastic card in your billfold didn’t
always carry the brand name VISA. It used to be called BankAmericard, a
name that was abandoned in the mid-1970s in favor of a name that was
shorter, instantly recognizable, pronounceable in any language, and had
no country or language affiliations.
Types of names
The brand name selection process usually results in a name that fits into one
of the following categories:
 The owner’s name or names: An owner’s name can serve as the basis
for a business name, such as Joe Smith’s Piano Tuning Service. On a far
larger scale, an owner’s name (or two owners’ names, in this case) can
serve as the basis for a merged business name, such as ExxonMobil.
Especially for small business sole proprietors, building a new brand on
the name of an owner is an easy approach. The name is likely to be avail-
able, easy to register, and capable of advancing the promise that the
owner stands by the company’s products or services.
The downside to using an owner’s name is that, without significant mar-
keting, personal names rarely develop the kind of widespread awareness
and sky-high credibility that translate to premium pricing and future sale
value.
 Abbreviation names: People think of quick, easy-to-recall names like
IBM or AOL and believe that a similarly short abbreviation or acronym
will work for them. In both these examples, though, extensive marketing
efforts had to be made before the names meant something to con-
sumers. Unless you’re willing to invest accordingly, avoid this route.
Either you’ll end up with a string of initials that mean little to consumers
or you’ll end up with a generic name like ABC Equipment Rental, which
exudes no personality or promise and has only one benefit — putting
you first in alphabetical lists in the phone book. That’s hardly a brand
building strategy!
 Geographically anchored names: These are dime-a-dozen names that
work to capitalize on a known local landmark or geographic indicator.
Think Central Coast Bank, Pleasantville Grocery, and Cascade Mountain
Insurance. Most names of this kind blur into a group of like-named 
109
Chapter 7: Naming Your Brand

entities. Only a few stand out as esteemed brands, and those that do are
almost always the ones that invested the most time and money to market
their names into distinguishing brands.
 Descriptive names: These are names that describe a business’s offering
or brand promise. Head Start Child Development Programs, U-Haul,
Budget Rent A Car, and Clinique are examples of names that convey the
nature of the brand’s offerings and business promise.
 Borrowed interest names: These are names that use existing words that
don’t directly reflect the brand’s offerings or promise but that can be
linked to a brand’s essence and promise through marketing efforts
rather than through direct translation. Good examples include Apple,
Nike, Yahoo!, and Starbucks.
 Fabricated-word names: These are names that combine acronyms,
words, or syllables to form previously unknown words and brand
names. Google, Verizon, Microsoft, and Mozilla are all are easy to repeat,
easy to recall names that have been imbued with meaning due to their
business’s efforts. Because they’re newly invented words, fabricated
names are usually available for trademark protection, and the domain
names that contain them are likely to be available, too.
Naming advice to follow

Your Brand Name
When it comes time to actually name your brand, get ready to spend some
time and even some money, especially if your brand’s going to span a large
market area, compete against major brand names, or support a major vision
that will take decades to achieve and therefore will live long into the future.
Whether you choose to name your brand on your own or to seek professional
assistance from a professional marketing firm or branding group, involve
your own team in the process by following these steps.
1. List the attributes you personally want to reflect in your brand name.
Consider the following:
• What terms out of your brand identity statement do you most want
your name to convey, reflect, or support?
• What aspects of your brand promise would you like your name to
advance?
• What words define the character you want your name to convey?
2. Bring together key business partners, managers, and staff members,
and ask them to answer the three questions listed in Step 1. Then ask
them what kinds of names come to their minds.
111
Chapter 7: Naming Your Brand

Before you even begin the brainstorming process, or before you involve
professional assistance, this initial internal reaction focuses you on the
brand essence, attributes, and character that seem true to those who
are most involved with your business and its differentiating attributes.
3. Decide who will actually decide on your name.
Will the final choice rest with a single person or with the team? Will it
require a unanimous vote, or will the majority rule? Will one person
have veto power?
4. Involve all who will have a say — especially the key decision maker —
in the naming process.
You’re setting yourself up for trouble if the person who will ultimately
approve the name fails to participate in the process and lacks under-
standing of the reasons behind the name being presented.
Rounding up good ideas
Whether you’re naming your brand on your own or involving a professional
branding consultant or marketing firm, begin by giving thought to the kinds
of names you think do and don’t suit the character and vision of your brand.
Begin by assembling the team that will name your brand or that will work
with the professional consultants. Consider holding a retreat to get the cre-
ative ideas flowing. Not every idea will be a good idea; that’s the nature of
brainstorming. But the process produces lists of the kinds of names you think
fit well with your business. From there, you can proceed to narrow down the
choices, or you can turn your initial ideas over to a professional branding
consultant or marketing firm.
Brainstorming
At the beginning of a brainstorming session, participants usually are shy
about getting creative or throwing out what may seem like wild and crazy
ideas. Allow them to ease into the process by starting the session with a dis-
cussion of what kinds of feelings the participants would like people to have
when they hear your brand name, whatever it turns out to be.
Have an easels or white board available and write down every emotion you
hear. Then group them into categories, such as reputation, expertise, features
and benefits, or any other labels that seem to fit over clusters of words that
emerged from the discussion.
112
Part II: Building a Brand, Step-by-Step 

Then leave the categories in sight as you begin to brainstorm names that may
induce the desired responses.
As you brainstorm name ideas, encourage creativity by following these tips:
 Give every idea its time and space. The quickest way to kill creativity is
to shut down ideas with comments like, “That’s been done before,”
“That won’t work,” or “That’s not what we’re looking for.”
 When an idea seems to come out of left field, encourage alternatives.
Prompt more ideas with comments like, “What other words describe
that same concept?” and “How can we say that and fit within our brand
character?”
 Probe ideas. Ask participants to describe the underlying meaning of the
names they’re presenting. Sometimes in their descriptions they’ll
uncover other names that are even more appropriate.
 Encourage alternative perspectives. Ask participants to stand in the
shoes of others and to think of how they’d describe your brand from the
point of view of a child, a celebrity, an older consumer, or others who
may not be represented by the brainstorming group.
Record the results of your brainstorming session and review them as soon
after the session as possible. Circle the ideas that match your brand identity
statement. They make up the short list that you work from as you narrow
choices and begin to assemble name ideas (see the section “The hard part:
Narrowing your list to the best options” later in this chapter).
Finding inspiration
To find a unique name, reach outside your usual work environment. Give the
following ideas a try:
 Get out of your regular surroundings and go to the kinds of places
where your target customers spend time. If they eat in fast-food restau-
rants, go order a soda or a meal, take a table, and observe. If they’re avid
shoppers, go to the mall or to your downtown shopping area. If they
commute mass transit, buy a ticket and take a ride or two.
As you observe target customers, pay attention to the books they’re
reading, the shopping bags they’re carrying, and the labels they’re wear-
ing. Jot down names. They may unlock ideas for a name for your brand
that fits well with the interests and mindset of your customer base.
 Go to the magazine rack in your local bookstore or public library and
pull copies of magazines that you think your customers read. Flip
through and note ideas, names, or words that you think fit your brand
character and your brand identity statement.
113
Chapter 7: Naming Your Brand

 Go to stores or pick up magazines that are well outside the interest
area of your customers. If your customers are interested in high fashion,
go to a fish and bait shop, for instance. Look around at brand names.
The exposure may trigger interesting new concepts.
 Look through English and international language dictionaries, and
flip through a thesaurus. In the English dictionary, look up words that
describe your brand and study the word origins, seeing if they trace
back to Greek, Latin, or other roots that may provide the basis for good
brand names. In international dictionaries, look for translations of your
brand promise or attributes that may make great names. In the the-
saurus, look for synonyms for words that describe your brand.
Throughout your search, take note of the kinds of names that catch your eye
or ear. Are they names that convey or imply promises, names based on bor-
rowed interest, or names that are fabricated from syllables and sounds to
create one-of-a-kind new words? Your findings can guide your name decision.
The hard part: Narrowing your 
list to the best options
Here’s where the naming process gets tricky. Narrowing your list of potential
names down to a few best choices is tough and emotional. You know that
you’re making a lasting decision, and until the name is announced and met
with great fanfare, you can’t really be certain that it’s the ideal name.
When creating your short list of names, follow this advice:
 Include only a few top contenders unless you’re planning to undertake a
trademark search, in which case you need a longer list because many
will be knocked out during the legal process.
 Keep your top name contenders tightly within your brand naming circle
until you’re ready to reveal your name selection. Then (and only then)
you may want to show also-ran names as part of the rationale you pre-
sent to build support for your top choice.
Not even the greatest name contenders can hold up to the scrutiny that fol-
lows a leak during water-cooler conversations. For that reason, don’t let the
names out of your committee until you select one and it’s ready for presenta-
tion, backed by all the rationale for why it’s a great choice and how it will
excel in your marketing arena.
114
Part II: Building a Brand, Step-by-Step 

Putting your top contenders 
through a preliminary test
When you arrive at a short list of names you believe fit your brand well, put
each one through the following series of questions and investigations.
 Does it accurately depict or support your desired brand image?
• Does it convey, imply, or accurately reflect your differentiating
attributes and brand promise?
• Does it reflect your brand position? For instance, if your position is
being the most professional, creative, responsive, efficient, or pres-
tigious in your marketplace, does the name sound adequately pro-
fessional, creative, responsive, efficient, or prestigious?
• Is it a credible reflection of your business today? For example, if
you’re a local firm, including the word “global” in your name may
be quite a stretch.
• Can it grow with you as you achieve your highest aspiration and
the vision of your business?
 Is it easy to say?
• Write each leading name on a piece of paper and ask a few confi-
dants to read it out loud. Do they pronounce it correctly? Does it
sound pleasing to the ear? (To avoid feeding the internal gossip
mill, ask people outside your business.)
• Pretend that you’re answering the phone and use the name in a
greeting. (“Good morning, XYZ Company. May I help you?”) Does it
roll off the tongue, or is it awkward to say?
• Pretend that you’re introducing yourself as the president or vice
president or chief inventor of the company. How does the name
sound in professional conversations?
 Is it easy to spell?
• Say each leading name candidate out loud to others and ask them
to write it down. Do they spell it correctly?
If the name’s misspelled from time to time you may well select it
anyway, deciding that you can market your way around the prob-
lem. But be sure to make note of and save the various misspellings.
As you establish your online identity, you can try to grab domain
names for each of the erroneous spellings and automatically redi-
rect them to your official Web site. (You can find more on online
branding in Chapter 12.)
115
Chapter 7: Naming Your Brand

 Is it unique?
• Pick up your phone book and the phone book for the biggest city
in your market area. Go to the section in the white pages where
your brand name would appear to see how many similarly named
businesses already exist. Then conduct a similar exercise using
business directories, including everything from chamber of com-
merce or economic development directories to industry registers.
• Enter the name in a few Internet search engines and scan the
results to see if the name currently applies to other businesses.
 Does it translate well? Should you decide to go into e-commerce or to
serve international markets, does the name you’re considering have a
positive connotation in other cultures? If you think you’ll be targeting
specific international audiences in the future, ask people familiar with
the languages and cultures of those groups to react to the name. If you
don’t know anyone to ask, consider asking a language professor at a
local university for input.
 Do you like the name? You’ll be living with this name for a long time, so
you need to be comfortable with it. If the name really rubs you the
wrong way or embarrasses you in any way, move on to another selec-
tion. But if it feels awkward to say or write, realize that you may simply
be resisting change. The fact that it sounds different is good and even
necessary to stand out in the crowded market environment.
 Can you protect it? The final section of this chapter describes how to
check availability, stake your claim, obtain your domain name, and pro-
tect your brand with a trademark if it will be crossing state and national
borders. If the name’s not available or protectable in your market area —
whether that’s your hometown, state, region, country, or the world —
the sooner you know, the sooner you can strike it off your list and move
on to the next best choice.
Building consensus around 
your top-choice name
To win support for your name selection, don’t surprise your decision makers
with a last-minute presentation. Keep them in the loop throughout the process
so that, as a top choice emerges, they’re familiar with the name, the rationale
for its selection, and the ways that it works on behalf of your business.
As you reach outside your decision-making circle to present the name to 
your entire company, turn to Chapter 9 to find out how to launch your brand
internally.
116
Part II: Building a Brand, Step-by-Step 

Grabbing a Domain Name, If You Can
Your domain name is the string of characters that people type into their Web
browsers to reach your site. Ideally, you want your domain name to read
www.[yourbrandname].com, but in today’s crowded online world, the
chance of getting your dream address is far from guaranteed.
For an initial test of availability, open your browser and enter the domain
name of your dreams in the address line. If you’re taken straight to a Web
page, your desired domain name is already taken — sorry. If, instead, you get
a message that no such page exists, you’ve hit the equivalent of online pay
dirt. In that event, register the name, quickly. Even if it doesn’t actually
become your brand name, the cost of registering and protecting it just in case
is miniscule compared to the value of reserving the name in case you decide
it’s your winning brand name choice. (Expect to pay anywhere from a few dol-
lars to $75 to register a domain name for a three-year period. For a complete
list of domain name registrars, go to www.internic.net/regist.html.)
To conduct a more thorough availability search, turn to a domain name reg-
istry site. Network Solutions (www.networksolutions.com) is one of many
that offer free name searches. Enter the name you want and wait a few sec-
onds to see if it’s available. If it’s not, the site invites you to “see options to
get unavailable domain names.” Click that option to see advice for making
offers on already-registered names.
If your desired brand name isn’t available as a domain name, you can either
simply strike the name from your list or, if the name is owned by a cyber
squatter (someone who reserves all kinds of names until someone is willing to
buy the rights to them), you can contact the owner to see about purchasing
the address. Be aware, however, that this can be a time-consuming and costly
process.
If your desired brand name is already taken, avoid taking these alternate
routes:
 Don’t try to secure the name you want simply by replacing the .com
with .net or .org. Here’s why: Rather than conducting an online search
for a company’s address, many Web users take a shortcut by typing the
company plus .com into their browser address lines. Therefore, if you
adopt a domain name that consists of your brand name plus .net,
savvy Web users will reach a wrong address. Oops.
 Don’t try to reserve some clever variation of your name by adding
hyphens or using alternative spellings. For instance, don’t try to license
www.branding-for-dummies.com if www.brandingfordummies.com
is already taken. People won’t remember how to make the adjustments,
and as a result, they’ll never find you online.
117
Chapter 7: Naming Your Brand

Turn to Chapter 12 for much more information on how to establish your
brand online.
Fitting Your Name into Your 
Brand Architecture
Before you settle on a brand name, consider how and where the brand will fit
within your business, which is known as brand architecture (see Chapter 2).
Most brands fit into one of these architecture categories:
 Independent brands: These are stand-alone brands that represent every
offering and activity of the organizations they represent. Most small
businesses create independent brands for the simple reason that they’re
easier to build, manage, and market. At the same time, many very large
organizations also present all their offerings under a single brand. The
Red Cross is a good example.
 Parent-dominant brands: Parent-dominant brands are closely and very
visibly tied to the name and credibility of the top-level brand. For exam-
ple, a nonprofit organization that hosts a well-known annual fundraiser
probably treats the yearly event as a parent-dominant brand of the orga-
nization.
 Parent-endorsed brands: These are uniquely differentiated offerings
that are closely affiliated with their parent brands. Even though they’re
known by their own brand names, parent-endorsed brands are clearly
linked to a better-known umbrella brand. An example is Sony
PlayStation.
 Brand extensions: These brands piggyback on the recognition of an
established parent brand but build awareness and interest in a new and
different target market segment. A few examples are Arm & Hammer
Deodorant, Starbucks Coffee Liqueur, and RainX Windshield Wiper
Blades.
Successful smaller businesses build only one brand — for good reason.
Building, managing, protecting, and consistently conveying a single brand
takes time, money, and tremendous dedication. Creating multiple brands dou-
bles or triples the branding work and often results in a lack of focus on the
primary brand that drives the company’s success.
118
Part II: Building a Brand, Step-by-Step 

Rather than create multiple brands, build a single, dominant brand that pre-
sides over a number of product lines, events, fundraising campaigns, or other
brandable entities while reinforcing your primary brand at all times. Then as
you name each new offering, be sure that the name you select complements
the promise of the top-level brand. If it doesn’t, throw it out of the running
and move on to other names that fit with the identity and character of the
brand under which all other products fit.
Catch It If You Can: Protecting 
Your Name
After you select your name and put it through the wringer to see if people
can spell it, say it, remember it, find it online, and relate well to it in your
home culture as well as in other cultures, it’s time to begin the process of reg-
istering and protecting the name to ensure that it will belong to you and only
you for as long as it lives in the marketplace.
Screening to see if the name 
you want is already taken
Just because you love a name doesn’t mean you can adopt it and start using
it. First, you have to jump through some legal hoops to make sure that the
name isn’t too similar to an existing business name or trademark in your
119
Chapter 7: Naming Your Brand
Roundabout advice from Mark Twain
Consider this quote from Mark Twain:
Sufficient unto the day is one baby. As long
as you are in your right mind, don’t ever
pray for twins. Twins amount to a perma-
nent riot; and there ain’t any real difference
between triplets and an insurrection.
Twain could well have been talking about
brands rather than babies because one brand
is sufficient for most smaller businesses, and
more than one brand is more than most small
businesses can handle and manage well.
Unless your marketing expertise is high and
your budget large, stick to a single brand. Make
all additional products, events, or other brand-
able offerings that you present subbrands that
live under the strong umbrella of your one-and-
only brand.

market area. Conducting a name-availability search on your own and without
legal help isn’t enough to assure that the name you want is available, but it
helps you uncover which names definitely are already in use. With that
knowledge, you can create a Plan B before investing heavily in a name that
may not work for your brand.
Follow these steps to do your own initial name-availability search:
1. Conduct a preliminary online search for the name.
Start by entering your desired name plus .com in the address line of
your Web browser to see if you’re taken to the site of an existing busi-
ness. Then enter the name into a number of different search engines to
see if businesses with your top-choice name appear in the search
results.
If another business already uses the name you want, you may still be
able to use it as your own so long as your market area or industry doesn’t
overlap with that of the other business. However, proceed with caution
and the understanding that you’re risking marketplace confusion by
giving your brand the same name as another business’s brand.
2. Search your state’s database of registered business names.
This database is kept by the office of your secretary of state, corpora-
tions division, corporate registry, or a similar department depending on
the state or region in which you’re headquartered.
Banks require that you have an approved name before opening a busi-
ness bank account, and they can usually tell you exactly which govern-
ment office to call for name registration assistance. One call can tell you
whether the name you want is already taken in your immediate market
area. If the name’s available, you can complete a registration form, pay a
fee, and protect the name for your use in your immediate market area.
3. Screen the name with the United States Patent and Trademark Office,
which maintains a massive database of pending, registered, and
expired federal trademarks.
Go to www.uspto.gov, click on Trademarks, then Search Trademarks,
and enter the name you want. For global and international information,
go to www.uspto.gov/main/profiles/international.htm.
4. Conduct a preliminary domain name search.
A number of online resources allow you to conduct a free search of
domain name registries. Enter “domain name search” into your favorite
search engine, ask advice from the firm that hosts your Web site, or visit
sites such as www.neetworksolutions.com or www.allwhois.com
to conduct free on-the-spot searches.

 Trademark: A word, phrase, symbol, design,
or a combination of these used to identify
and distinguish a business and its products
or services.
 Registered trademark: A trademark that’s
registered with and protected by the U.S.

marks are indicated by use of the federal
registration symbol of a circled R (®) or by
the designation “Reg. TM.” You may use the

mark, you may alert the public to your claim
by inserting the designation “TM” (trade-
mark) or “SM” service mark. You may use
these terms regardless of whether you’ve
filed a mark application with the U.S. Patent
and Trademark Office.
Treading the trademark ropes
After you register your business name with government offices in your local
market area, you’re safe to use your name, but your name isn’t safe from use
by others outside your immediate market areas.
If you plan to do business across state or national borders, you should obtain
a trademark to prevent others from infringing on your identity by using a simi-
lar name, logo, or other identifying feature of your brand.
You can obtain extensive information and advice on trademarks from these
online resources:

office.org/directory/overview.pl

Anyone who tells you that the arena of trademarks is an easy one to navigate
is wearing rose-colored glasses. We’ve been through it enough times to
strongly advise you to look over the sidebar “Scheduling a root canal for your
brand name” and to seek legal assistance from an attorney who specializes in
trademark protection.
Your business attorney probably can assist you or refer you to a good legal
specialist for help with getting a trademark. Or you can use the Lawyer
Locator tool on the American Bar Association’s Web site (www.abanet.org/
lawyerlocator/searchaop.html). This tool allows you to locate attorneys
specializing in intellectual property in the state or country of your choice.

Part II: Building a Brand, Step-by-Step 
Scheduling a root canal for your brand name
Coming up with a name that appeals to con-
sumers and gaining a nod of approval from your
trademark attorney is a challenging, frustrating,
and even painful process. Part of the dilemma
is that consumers generally prefer names com-
prised of familiar words that create instant con-
nection and understanding, whereas attorneys
prefer unusual and coined names — the farther
away from any word ever heard before, the
better.
If a trademark is important to you (and if your
brand will travel nationally or globally, it’s not
just a matter of importance but of necessity),
follow this name development and trademark-
ing process used by leading brand development
specialists:
1. Establish your strategic objective based on
your desired brand position and character.
2. Develop anywhere from 500 to 1,000 poten-
tial names, using the various approaches
cited in this chapter.
3. Select your top 50 name choices.
4. Send your list to an attorney who special-
izes in naming and trademarking.
The attorney will conduct an initial trade-
mark search in your business arena and in
related areas of business to determine
whether using the name may leave you vul-
nerable to litigation from other brand hold-
ers now or in the future. In most cases, by
the time the drilling’s over, only two or three
of your 50 name entries end up on a “good
chance of approval” list. The price for con-
ducting the initial screening for each name
usually runs around $25 to $30.
5. The attorney puts names that make it past
the initial screening through an exhaustive
availability search.
This phase generally runs around $3,000 to
$4,000 per name and results in a detailed risk
analysis. If your top-choice name is deemed
clear to use without risk of an infringement
suit from another trademark holder, autho-
rize your attorney to run — not walk — to
register it as your own. If its use comes with
some infringement question marks, work
with your attorney (and within the comforts
of your own risk tolerance) to determine
whether or not to proceed to adopt the name
with or without a trademark.

L
ogo design is the point at which the branding process acquires fanfare.
The minute people in your organization see your brand emerge in a logo
that embodies your name they begin to get enthusiastic about what may
have previously felt like a whole bunch of navel-gazing. To most people, logo
creation is the fun part of branding. It’s also the part that unduly gets the
most energy and enthusiasm.
If you opened straight to this chapter with the hope that you could give your
brand a face without wading through the process of researching, positioning,
and defining your brand identity, realize that branding isn’t like a game of
Monopoly. You can’t just jump to “Go.” The only way you end up with a logo
that accurately reflects the essence of your brand is by defining the essence
of your brand before you begin the logo design process. If you haven’t yet
done so, do yourself and your brand a favor by going through the steps pre-
sented in Chapter 6. They help you clarify your understanding of your
brand’s mission, values, vision, culture, and character so that you can create
a symbol — a logo — that serves as an accurate presentation of who you are
and what you stand for in your marketplace.
If, however, you’ve taken the necessary steps and are truly ready to create a
brand logo, dive right in. This chapter contains all you need to know.

124
Part II: Building a Brand, Step-by-Step 
Planning Your Logo: The 
Face of Your Brand
Your logo is the graphic design — in type or symbol form — that conveys
your brand name and character in your marketplace.
The best logos are unique, simple, and strong representations of the compa-
nies they identify. To those seeing your signage, letterhead, packaging, ads,
brochures, and any other communication that carries a visual representation
of your brand, your logo is the face of your organization.
This section is full of advice on how to proceed with your logo design, but
above all else, remember these three all-important points:
 Keep your logo simple. Simple logo designs work best for a number of
reasons:
• They actually stand out in the sea of visual complexity and chaos
that exists in today’s busy and saturated marketplace.
• They enjoy longer lives than trendy, complicated logos that go out
of style and require redesign to keep them in step with market
tastes.
• They contribute more significantly to a brand’s awareness and
recognition than logos that need to be updated every few years.
Look at the long-standing logos of well-known and leading brands,
such as Nike, Microsoft, and the Red Cross; they display an amaz-
ing amount of visual restraint.
 Design a logo that can be presented consistently across all commu-
nication channels. You want your logo to work well on your business
checks, your vehicle signage, your Web site, your TV ads, and even
your company uniforms or other apparel.
 Don’t do it yourself unless you’re a design professional or you want
your logo to look like it represents a hands-on business that, in fact,
created its own logo. Self-made logos are kind of like self-made TV ads;
most of them are obvious for their lack of polish.
If you’re not sure whether a do-it-yourself logo will present your company
adequately, review your business vision (see Chapter 6 if your vision isn’t
totally clear in your mind). If your vision is to provide the lowest-cost,
quickest, bare-bones solution in a low-competition market area, a self-
created logo may work just fine. However, if your highest aspirations for
your business involve a long life and a broadly recognized reputation for
top quality in a competitive field, investing in a professionally designed
logo is a moderate down payment on your success.

Matching your logo to your 
brand and business
Whether you do it yourself or hire a professional to develop your logo, you
need to think in advance about what image you want your logo to convey.
Any graphic designer can tell you that clients who give no direction, saying
that they’ll simply know the right logo when they see it, burn through a lot of
unnecessary time and money while they wait for the perfect look to miracu-
lously emerge.
Instead, begin your logo-design task with some clear initial input about the type
of image you want to develop. Use the worksheet in Figure 8-1 to assemble your
thoughts and give your designer — whether that person is yourself, someone
on your staff, or an experienced professional — good directions to work from.

Chapter 8: Designing Your Logo and Tagline

Choosing your logo approach
Most logos take one of the following forms:
 They feature the name of the business in a unique type presentation
called a wordmark.
 They feature the initials of the business in a symbol called a lettermark.
 They feature a symbol that represents the business, called a brandmark.
 They combine these three logo approaches, for instance using a letter-
mark or a brandmark as the focal point of the logo, accompanied by the
full name of the company — and sometimes the company slogan or
tagline as well — in a unique configuration that becomes the company’s
brand symbol.
Take care when combining elements in your logo design. Too much results in
an overdone, visually complicated, confusing logo. If you do combine ele-
ments, be sure that each component is visually clean and strong. For good
examples, consider the multielement logos of fashion industry brands. For
example, Chanel’s unadorned wordmark is used in conjunction with the
iconic overlapping double Cs to create a strong symbol and fashion icon.
Figure 8-2 presents examples of each of the logo approaches.
Spelling it out with a wordmark
A wordmark (sometimes called a logotype or typographic symbol) turns your
brand name into your logo by presenting it in a unique typestyle, often with
some artistic element that adds flair and memorability. Wordmarks are gain-
ing in popularity among brand builders, as explained in the sidebar “What’s
in a logo? Increasingly, a name.”
The best wordmarks are easy to read and distinctive. A few examples of
widely and easily recognized wordmarks include the logos of FedEx, Google,
Kellogg’s, and Yahoo!.
Consider a wordmark especially if any of the following circumstances apply
to your marketing situation.
 You want your logo to build recognition for your name.
 Your marketing budget is lean, and realistically, you aren’t able to gain
widespread recognition of a symbol, so you’re better off gaining recogni-
tion of a distinct presentation of your name instead.
 You intend to develop subbrands under your primary brand, and you
want a strong wordmark that can serve as an umbrella over each line.

Using your initials in a lettermark
Lettermarks turn a company’s initial or initials into a brand symbol. In some
logos, the lettermark appears all on its own, as in the IBM logo, which long
ago dropped any reference to the name International Business Machines.
Other stand-alone lettermarks include the logos of GE, CNN, and Louis
Vuitton.
In other logos, the lettermark appears along with a wordmark that presents
the full name of the brand, such as in the logo of McDonald’s, which features
the restaurant name along with an oversized “M.” Another example is the
logo of Kodak, which features a large K into which the name Kodak fits.
Lettermarks are good logo choices in the following circumstances:
 You want to make your name the primary emphasis of your logo, but
you feel that your name is too long to be a good wordmark.
 You want to add a stylized monogram to a fairly straightforward presen-
tation of your name in order to convey your brand personality.
 You have the budget necessary to gain awareness for your lettermark
so that, in time, people see the mark and think of your business and
its name.
Creating a brandmark or symbol
Brandmarks range from fairly literal to abstract designs. The best brand-
marks become so associated with the brand names they symbolize that, in
time, consumers automatically think of the brand name when they catch a
glimpse of the logo. Think of the Nike Swoosh or the Mercedes symbol as
examples of the power of great brandmarks.
You can create a brandmark by using free or almost-free resources available
through clip-art or do-it-yourself logo sites or software, but the savings can
be quickly eaten up by the investment you’ll need to make to infuse a generic
symbol with meaning for your brand.
Of all the logo approaches, developing a brandmark requires the highest level
of professionalism, design expertise, and investment.
If you decide to go the brandmark route, you’re best off hiring an experienced
designer to create a customized, trademarkable symbol for your brand. And
you should realize that, even with a one-of-a-kind, tailor-made mark, you need
to make a strong marketing investment in order to establish meaning for your
symbol in the eyes and minds of your consumers.
128
Part II: Building a Brand, Step-by-Step 

Consider a brandmark when these circumstances apply to your business:
 Your name is too long or cumbersome for a wordmark.
 A lettermark doesn’t fit the character or image of your brand.
 A symbol will help you communicate the benefit, promise, distinction, or
character of your brand.
 Your market spans the globe, and you seek a symbol that can represent
your brand regardless of the language of the consumer.
 You have the budget required to build your logo into a recognizable,
meaningful symbol that communicates with such strength that it can
carry meaning even if it doesn’t appear with your name.
Most brandmarks fit into one of these categories:
 A representation of the business name. For example, the Circle K
brandmark is a “K” in a circle, and the Target logo is, unmistakably, a
target. The Apple logo is an apple, the Red Cross logo is a red cross. The
Shell logo is a shell, and the Greyhound logo is a greyhound. The list
goes on and on.
 A representation of the brand’s primary offering. For instance, a
cruise line may adopt a brandmark of an ocean liner, and a catering ser-
vice may use a knife and fork or a wine glass as its symbol.
 A representation of the brand’s promise. For instance, an educational
program may feature a symbol of a child holding a book, and a health
spa may feature a symbol representing a toned body. Morton’s salt
adopted the symbol of a little girl sprinkling salt in the rain.
 An abstract symbol that, over time and through marketing, is instilled
with meaning for the brand it represents. Examples of this kind of
brandmark include the “good hands” of Allstate Insurance, the rings of
the International Olympics, the Nike Swoosh, and the bespectacled trian-
gle-faced man on the cover of the book you’re holding. All are highly visi-
ble brandmarks that are meaningful to consumers because of diligent
use and marketing by the brand holders.
Developing Your Logo Design
If you want to try to do it yourself, you can enter “do-it-yourself logo cre-
ation” into any search engine to obtain lists of logo-generating Web sites and
logo development software. If you’re artistically inclined and if you have the
time to spend, proceed on your own, taking great care to follow the advice in
the upcoming sections on logo design and logo taboos.
129
Chapter 8: Designing Your Logo and Tagline

If you think your time is better spent running your business and acquiring
customers rather than trying to create your own logo, hire a graphic designer,
ad agency, or branding firm to do the creative and design work for you.
Whether you do it on your own or with professional assistance, start devel-
oping your logo design by completing the worksheet shown in Figure 8-1 so
that you or your logo design team members understand the brand your logo
must reflect before the creative process begins.
Also, provide the following information to help guide creation of a logo that
fits your brand and its market:
 A description of your clientele: For instance, are your customers pre-
dominantly male or female, professional or blue-collar, urban or subur-
ban, or of a particular age group or income level?
 Three to six words that you think best describe your brand and offer-
ing: For example, “stylish,” “high quality,” “contemporary,” “classic,”
“casual,” “professional,” and so on.
130
Part II: Building a Brand, Step-by-Step 
What’s in a logo? Increasingly, a name
When you think of logos, you probably think of
visual symbols or brandmarks because that’s
how logos entered the business world in the
1800s. Back then, the manufacturing break-
throughs of the 19th century allowed for large-
scale production of goods for the first time. With
mass-production came product supplies that
could be sold not just in home market areas but
also in far-flung locations.
To successfully sell in distant markets, though,
companies needed to gain consumer aware-
ness and brand recognition in new areas where
personal sales presence often wasn’t possible.
Putting their names on their goods wasn’t good
enough because many 19th-century consumers
were unable to read. So marketers used sym-
bols to convey their brands. They adopted and
presented meaningful brandmarks that could be
easily understood even by those without liter-
acy. The famous bell of the Bell Telephone
System (known to all as Ma Bell back in those
pre-deregulation days) was one of the early
symbols to gain widespread prominence.
Over the years, the need for a reliance on sym-
bols ebbed. As literacy rates climbed, compa-
nies began to present stylized versions of their
names instead of or alongside symbols repre-
senting their brands.
As the calendar turned to the year 2000 and the
Internet became a major communication chan-
nel, new companies increasingly adopted new
words that would work as Internet domain
names and as their brand names. Rather than
asking the market to learn a newly fabricated
name and a new symbol, the companies turned
their names into their logos, presenting their
brands with wordmarks instead of brandmarks.
Google and Yahoo! are two globally recognized
examples.

 Samples of logos you like and don’t like, along with some idea of why
you feel the way you do about each one: Designers can’t read minds, so
the more input you provide, the faster and better the process will go.
 Your preliminary thoughts regarding design, color, and shape consid-
erations: If you know that your logo will need to work well in horizontal
signs, for instance, or if you know that you hate the color brown, say so
early on, not after you see the first round of design suggestions. Give
creative professionals everything they need to do the job right from the
start, when creativity is at its highest. Doing so avoids making them feel
like their creative solutions are being killed through a thousand little
cuts. Providing certain information upfront also saves you time and
money because you arrive at a solution that fits your brand and meets
your needs without rounds and rounds of costly revisions.
Design ingredients
As you go through the design process, be aware that the typestyle you select,
the colors you adopt, and the shape the logo takes all have a bearing on the
way it communicates and works for your brand.
What’s your type?
Some typestyles look bold, some look progressive, some look refined or even
elegant, and some look playful or creative. The typestyle you choose — and
the way you arrange the type in your logo — has a tremendous impact on the
impression your logo makes. Follow these tips:
 Choose a typestyle that matches the character of your brand. If your
brand character is buttoned-down and professional, choose a typestyle
that looks professional and even formal. If your brand character is
casual, choose a typestyle that looks casual, too.
For a quick orientation to the world of typestyles, open your word pro-
cessing program and pull down the menu for fonts to see samples of a
wide variety of typestyles. Notice that some styles feature small lines
adorning each character. These lines are called serifs, and the typestyles
that feature them are called serif styles. Other typestyles are devoid of
any letter enhancements, or sans serif. Courier and Times New Roman
are examples of serif typestyles; Helvetica and Geneva are examples of
sans serif typestyles. In general, serif typestyles convey a more tradi-
tional character whereas sans serif typestyles are more modern.
131
Chapter 8: Designing Your Logo and Tagline

When choosing your typestyle, opt for a look that can withstand the test
of time. For instance, the FedEx wordmark is derived from the Helvetica
type and has been altered to make it more distinctive. Helvetica was
designed by the typographer Max Miedinger in 1957. How’s that for
proof that classic styles have longevity!
 Customize the presentation of your name in your logo. Look at the
wordmarks in Figure 8-2, and you’ll see that some incorporate design
elements into the type presentation. Others present the type in what, at
first glance, seems to be a straightforward presentation. But don’t be
fooled. There’s a world of difference between the look of a beautifully
produced wordmark and the look of type straight off your word proces-
sor. Type produced directly from a word processor is evenly spaced so
that all letters and words are the same distance apart. Type that’s pro-
fessionally arranged is adjusted so that letters are placed in uniquely
pleasing configurations. The difference is almost imperceptible, yet it
makes a dramatic difference in the appearance of a wordmark, and it’s
one of the reasons logo designers earn their fees.
A primer on colors
Your logo’s color scheme can become an essential element of your brand
identity. Coca-Cola is red; IBM is blue; John Deere is green. For that matter,
think of your favorite college or pro team. Put the players in different colors,
and fan confusion sets in.
As you choose colors for your brand identity, consider the following:
 Establish a color scheme that differs from the scheme used by your
major competitors. People relate to color so strongly that you’ll cause
confusion by trying to adopt the same or similar colors that are already
associated with another key player in your market arena.
 Choose a color scheme that reflects your brand character. If your
market is comprised of young children, logo colors that resemble deco-
rations on a birthday cake may be ideal. But the same colors would
hardly work for the logo of a respected plastic surgeon or a leading cor-
porate law firm.
Most consumers perceive neutral tones such as grey, taupe, navy, dark
green, or burgundy as subdued, mature, and professional. Pastels
convey calmness. Blues and greens are cool. Red, orange, and yellow are
warm and energetic.
 Choose colors that match your brand and the expectations customers
have when selecting your offering. For example, if your brand and your
customers’ expectations are professional, choose colors that are sub-
dued and cool. If you offer and your customers seek lively entertain-
ment, choose colors that are energetic.
132
Part II: Building a Brand, Step-by-Step 

 Consider how your colors will be interpreted in other cultures or
countries if your brand will be marketed outside your immediate
market area.
 If your logo will appear on apparel or logo-emblazoned specialty
items, consider how the colors will look on uniforms, golf shirts, ball
caps, coffee mugs, or the dozens of other places it may end up. If the
colors can’t be reproduced consistently, alter your color scheme accord-
ingly. Alternatively, decide on an acceptable range of colors in which the
logo can be presented without breaking your logo management rules
(See the section “Managing your logo” later in this chapter for more
information.)
 The fewer colors you employ, the easier your logo will be to manage.
Logos with full-color illustrations or photos require full-color printing —
an expensive and time-consuming process that you should adopt only
after serious consideration. Plus, the Internet further restricts color
options because the Web’s color palette is limited.
 No matter what color scheme you adopt, be sure your logo works
beautifully in plain old black and white. After all, that’s how it will look
on your business checks, in photocopies, in many small-format ads, and
in numerous low-cost communications that will carry your brand iden-
tity far and wide.
Logo shapes and sizes
Most logos need to work well in a horizontal configuration that’s about half
as tall as it is wide. In other words, they need to look good on a standard
business card, in the return address portion of a business envelope, and on
the shirt pocket of uniforms or logo apparel.
Whatever configuration your logo takes, be sure it can reduce down to the size
it will appear on a business card, which is where it will appear most frequently.
If it becomes blurry or unrecognizable in a small size, redesign it to simplify the
elements so that it reads well even in its most minute presentation.
Logo design evaluation
When reviewing logo designs, put them through a preliminary test to see if
they incorporate the traits of most good symbols.
 Do you think the logo makes a good impression for your business?
Does it make an impression that’s equal to the professionalism and stan-
dards of your company?
 Is it easy to see and remember? Try this test when reviewing a logo
design: Look at the logo, then set it aside and try to draw a quick rendi-
tion on a scrap of paper. If you come up with a sketch that’s close to the
design, then you can be pretty sure that the logo is memorable.
133
Chapter 8: Designing Your Logo and Tagline

 Does it work in a single ink color and at a small size? If the rendition
you’re looking at is in color, run it through the photocopier and see if it
looks good in black and white and at a size that fits on a business card.
Check to be sure that none of the fine lines disappear in the reproduc-
tion and reduction. If they do, then the logo artwork is probably too
weak to withstand a broad range of applications.
Logo design taboos
Economy is a virtue in almost every arena except logo design. The biggest
mistake that new brand marketers make is saddling themselves with logos
that scream “homemade.” Follow this advice to avoid the most common logo-
design pitfalls:
 Don’t have your cousin’s nephew design it or do it yourself.
Remember, your logo is what visually represents your brand and the cal-
iber of your offering. If you want to compete with great brands, hire an
expert who specializes in logo design.
 Don’t let the design get too fussy. Keep it simple. The best brands are
clean and refined, conveying leadership and longevity.
 Don’t resort to clip art. The archives of available symbols that you can
drop into your logo are huge, but they’re generic, say little about your
brand and its character, and are sure to show up in someone else’s logo
at some point in the future.
 Don’t be a copycat. Use other logos for inspiration, but invest the time
and money necessary to create your own unique mark. For one thing, you
end up with a unique logo. For another, you avoid the legal landmines that
infringing on another company’s brandmark are likely to set off.
Your logo makes the difference between a strong and a weak first impression
for your business. It also makes the difference between a brand of choice and
a product purchased simply for its price or availability. Want proof? Take the
alligator off the shirt, and what is Izod selling? A shirt like any other shirt you
can get anywhere. With the alligator, the shirt becomes an association with
the success and stature of the Ivy League.
Preparing your logo artwork
If you feel up to the task of designing your own logo, follow this advice:
 If you create your logo by using the templates available in publishing
programs, carefully customize colors, symbols, and typestyles so that
you end up with a unique logo look for your business.
134
Part II: Building a Brand, Step-by-Step 

 Use the same design software that professionals use. Adobe Illustrator,
CorelDRAW, and Macromedia Freehand are known as vector-based
graphic design software, which means that your final logo design can be
enlarged or reduced without design distortion or loss of quality.
If you go the preferred route and hire a design professional for your logo
design and development, take these steps:
1. Choose a professional whose expertise, size, and fees fit well with
your needs.
Options range from freelance artists to small design studios to local,
regional, national or global ad agencies to internationally renowned
identity developers. You can spend anywhere from several hundred dol-
lars up to the million-dollar range. If you want a logo that competes well
in a local market, set aside a small budget and find a local resource. If
you aspire to make the list of the world’s top brands, turn to the talents
of award-winning brand specialists, and invest accordingly.
2. Review past work samples to be sure that the designer’s style matches
with your expectations.
3. Be clear about your budget and obtain cost estimates before authoriz-
ing design work to begin.
4. Stipulate that you will own all rights to your logo after you pay in full
for its design and production.
5. Upon approval of your final logo design, obtain copies of the artwork
in EPS format for printing purposes and in JPG and GIF formats for
online use.
Putting Your Logo to Work
After you create and approve your logo design, apply it consistently to every
single communication that carries your name into the marketplace. Use the
worksheet in Figure 8-3 to keep track of all the places your logo needs to go.
Then aim to get your logo into place on all items on the list just as quickly as
possible.
Avoid introducing your logo in a piecemeal fashion, applying it to some brand
presentations immediately and others over time. If some communications
carry your logo and others don’t, or if some carry outdated versions of a
revised logo while other carry the latest iteration, you’re setting yourself up
for a weak identity and marketplace confusion.

Part II: Building a Brand, Step-by-Step 

Saving Face: Giving an Existing 
Logo a Makeover
Sometimes a logo gets tired. Perhaps it’s been used inconsistently and, as a
result, it’s lost the ability to present your brand in a clear manner. Maybe it’s
failed to keep pace with changes to your brand’s product offering, character,
and target market. Or maybe it’s just plain gone out of style over the years.
If you think that the time has come to repair your logo, begin by evaluating
your needs. Consider whether you need an evolutionary or revolutionary re-
design. In other words, think about whether you seek a quick nip and tuck or
an extreme brand makeover.
To come to this conclusion, ask yourself the following questions:
 What image do you want to project, and how does your logo fall short?
 What about your business has changed since your logo was created?
Is your target market different? Has your product offering changed?
Do you still make the same business promise? Is your brand character
still the same?
 Can you update your current logo to reflect your updated situation with-
out making a radical identity change, or do you need an altogether new
symbol even though the complete change may result in short-term
market confusion?
 What elements of your logo are most important to your identity?
The symbol? The colors? The wordmark? If you could keep only one por-
tion of your logo, which would it be? (Chapter 17 presents before-and-
after logo redesigns that show how others made their logo redesign
decisions.)
 Do you have the budget required to change your logo throughout all
brand communications?
Look back at Figure 8-3 for a list of all the places your brand logo goes. In
addition to the cost of redesigning your logo, you need to be prepared to
update every single place your logo appears, and the sooner the better.
Trying to apply a new logo on a catch-as-catch-can basis is a formula for
brand management disaster. Instead, aim to update your logo in all
appearances in as short a period as possible.
137
Chapter 8: Designing Your Logo and Tagline

As you get ready to revitalize your brand, turn to Chapter 17. It provides indi-
cators to watch and situations to monitor as you determine whether or not to
retool or retire your brand identity, how to critique your logo, how to revive
your look, and how to manage the rebranding process so that it’s as transpar-
ent and effective as it can possibly be.
Managing Your Logo
To maintain a strong graphic identity for your brand, your logo has to appear
exactly the same every single time it’s reproduced, with no exceptions.
The minute you present your logo with a different typestyle, or in a different
color combination, or with a different embellishment of any kind, you lose
consistency and, with that, the power to convey your brand identity with
clarity.
To ensure that your logo is presented without variation, create a set of usage
guidelines to be followed by everyone who produces marketing materials
for your business. This section provides an outline to follow to manage
your logo.
Creating logo tools, standards, 
and usage rules
As a first step toward controlling the presentation of your logo, create logo
artwork that must be used consistently by all who create materials on behalf
of your brand. Then stipulate that your logo must be reproduced from these
approved files and not from second-generation versions that risk degradation
of the clarity and quality of the design.
Beyond use of the approved artwork, also control how your logo can appear
by establishing usage guidelines in each of the following areas.
Presentation of your logo as a single unit
Too often, those creating materials for your company will want to take liber-
ties with your logo by increasing the size of one element and decreasing the
size of another, or by moving elements into different positions to alter the
shape of the logo in order to fit it into a space it otherwise doesn’t fit. Ban
such individualized treatments by providing artwork for your logo in several
allowable shape variations — perhaps one for use in horizontal placements
and one for use in vertical placements — along with the stipulation that any
alternative configuration must be approved prior to usage.
138
Part II: Building a Brand, Step-by-Step 

Placement of your logo
Define how your logo can appear in printed materials.
 Clarify how much open space must exist between your logo and sur-
rounding design elements. For instance, a company with a wordmark
that begins with the letter “T” may require that the logo be surrounded
by open space at least equal to the size the “T” appears on the page.
This rule ensures that the logo isn’t crowded by surrounding artwork.
 Define whether or not you allow your logo to appear on its side or in
a diagonal placement, or whether it must always run parallel to the
bottom of the page, whether in a horizontal or vertical configuration.
 Define the smallest size in which your logo can appear. Especially if
your logo involves type or fine lines, it may become illegible at small
sizes, which reflects poorly on your brand image.
Color treatments
In your logo usage guidelines, define the ink colors in which your logo may
appear.
 In black and white applications, stipulate whether or not you allow the
logo art to appear in white on a black background (called a reverse treat-
ment) or whether the logo itself should appear in black, with no reverse
option.
 When printing your logo in black ink, clarify whether you allow it to
appear on colored paper or in colored backgrounds and, if so, whether
background colors are limited to a range of recommended or allowable
colors.
 When your logo appears in colors, spell out what colors are allowed. If
your logo is to appear in green, for example, take the guidelines a step
further by telling exactly which shade of green, giving the ink number
from the Pantone Matching System (PMS) used by most printers. Also
stipulate how to build the approved color through the four-color print-
ing process (called CMYK for cyan-magenta-yellow-black) by defining
what percentage of each of the four inks a printer should use to create
the desired tone. Further, define how to arrive at the color through the
RGB (red green blue) process for computer screen display.
Backgrounds and shadow effects
Many of the best-managed logos bar reproduction of color logos over back-
grounds that compete with the logo design. When backgrounds are neces-
sary, you may want to stipulate that the background must be dark enough to
allow the logo to be reversed out of the background, causing the logo to
appear in white rather than in the standard color treatment. Also, consider
whether or not you allow your logo to be presented with a shadow effect.
139
Chapter 8: Designing Your Logo and Tagline

Naming a brand cop
People don’t fiddle with your logo to be mischievous; they think they’re being
helpful or creative on your behalf without realizing that their help is actually
a hindrance to the strength of your brand identity. That’s why usage rules are
so all-important. It’s also why you need to circulate your usage guidelines and
name a person within your company who must approve any usage that devi-
ates in any way from the approved usage of your logo.
Chapter 18 includes detailed information on writing and enforcing your brand
usage guidelines.
Creating a Tagline
A tagline is a phrase that accompanies your brand name to quickly translate
your positioning and brand identity statements into a line that means some-
thing to consumers. A tagline is meant to provide consumers with an indica-
tion of your brand and its market position in just a few memorable words.
Discovering what makes a great tagline
Great taglines have a number of common attributes. When writing your
tagline, see that it meets these criteria:
 It’s memorable. You hear it, memorize it quickly, and repeat it with ease.
 It’s short. Great taglines often have as few as ten syllables so that
they’re quick to recite, easy to tuck in alongside logos, and short enough
to include in voicemail greetings and small-space ads.
 It conveys a brand’s point of difference by telling what sets it apart
from others. A great example of this element is Avis Rent A Car and the
tagline “We try harder.”
 It clarifies a brand’s market position and key benefits, especially if the
brand name doesn’t quickly communicate the brand’s offerings and
distinctions.
 It differentiates a business from all others. In fact, a great tagline is so
unique that it doesn’t work when linked to a competitor’s brand name.
 It reflects the brand’s identity, character, promise, and personality.
 It’s believable and original.
140
Part II: Building a Brand, Step-by-Step 

A great tagline manages to excel on most or all of these fronts while also
avoiding a couple of major tagline mistakes.
 It invokes positive feelings without running the risk of triggering sarcastic
retorts.
 It appeals to consumers even more than to corporate committees. In
other words, the tagline doesn’t get bogged down with the input of a
dozen executives who inadvertently turn the slogan into a corporate ral-
lying call rather than a consumer magnet.
 It adds to the meaning of the brand name without repeating any of the
same words or concepts.
Deciding whether you need a tagline 
(and you probably do)
Taglines are increasingly important as a means to carry your brand identity
where your logo can’t go, like your e-mail messages, classified ads, voicemail
greetings, and other nonvisual communication channels. In those environ-
ments, your tagline becomes the single transmitter of your business’s brand
and position.
Some brand names tell a pretty complete brand story (for example,
Coppertone, Jiffy Lube, U-Haul). Other brand names benefit from some quick
explanation, which is where taglines come to the rescue. Plus, even seem-
ingly self-sufficient brand names gain dimension through their slogans.
To determine whether you need a tagline, answer these questions:
 Does your business offer consumers distinct advantages that aren’t con-
veyed in your name?
 Would your brand character be more clearly presented with a line that
travels with your brand name?
 Is your company best at something that you want consumers to know
about but that isn’t conveyed by your name?
If you answered “yes” to any of these questions, a tagline may well be a
strong addition to your brand name, logo, and marketing program.

Tag(line), you’re it! Coming 
up with your slogan
For a look at some of the best slogans in use today, go online to the
Advertising Slogan Hall of Fame at www.adslogans.co.uk/hof. From
AT&T’s “Reach out and touch someone” to the Yellow Pages’ “Let your fingers
do the walking,” the site posts the top ten slogans of recent years along with
an A-to-Z list of great taglines and a wealth of tagline development advice.
In crafting your own tagline, consider the following:
 Know your positioning statement. What meaningful and available niche in
your market do you fill better than any other brand? (Turn to Chapter 5
if you’re not sure.)
 Based on your unique position, come up with a list of quick, memorable
one-liners that convey your special distinction.
 Put each of your tagline contenders to the test by seeing if they live up
to the qualities listed in the section “What makes a great tagline?” For

f your new brand were to consist simply of a new name, a new logo, and
maybe a new tagline, it would be ready to launch as soon as the ink was
dry on your new stationery, ads, and supporting marketing materials. But,
guess what? Branding isn’t that superficial.
Brands aren’t skin-deep applications that you apply over your organization to
give it a new, improved, and more compelling identity. Brands go all the way
to the core of your business. They’re reflected not just by your logo, ads, and
sales communications but, even more importantly, by every contact with
your business — whether before, during, or after the purchase.
That’s why this chapter helps you launch your brand from the inside out,
bringing every aspect of your business into alignment with your brand
promise, personality, and character before you raise the curtain and intro-
duce your brand in your marketplace.
This chapter leads you through the phases of your brand launch: preparing
for your brand debut, writing your brand launch marketing plan, launching
your brand internally, and moving your brand into the public eye.

Part III: Launching Your New Brand 
Committing to Internal and External
Brand Launches — In That Order
When it comes to brand launches, we’ve seen extreme successes and real
flops, and the difference, almost without variation, comes down to whether
or not the launch took place within the organization before it traveled to the
outside world. If an internal launch doesn’t occur first, a brand fails to win
the kind of internal buy-in necessary to imbed the brand message into the
entire brand experience.
Although your logo is a very important aspect of your brand, it’s only one
representation of your identity. Your brand is conveyed through everything
the world sees and hears and encounters. How you answer your phones, how
you treat your employees, how your employees treat your customers, how it
feels to deal with your business, the look of your workspace or Web site, the
music that plays in the background — these are the expressions that make
your brand message and promise a reality. To create the experience that
accurately reflects your brand, your internal team needs to embrace your
brand before it sees the light of the world outside your doors.
Preparing for Your Brand Launch
Whether you’re launching a new brand or revitalizing an existing brand, your
brand identity needs to be announced as part of a complete brand story. If
your new brand identity leaks out in bits and pieces, people within your orga-
nization are likely to think one of two things:
 So what?
 They spent all that time and money on that?
After you’ve decided on and approved your brand name, logo, and tagline
(see Chapters 7 and 8), hold that information close to your vest while you put
your brand through final tests and prepare it for unveiling.
Knowing your story, chapter and verse
Before you enlist the understanding, interest, and support of others, be sure
you’re 100-percent ready for your internal launch by assembling short state-
ments that describe each of the following brand elements. Summarize the 
following:

 Your market position: Chapter 5 helps you work through the homework
involved to arrive at a statement that tells what you offer, who you
serve, and the unique benefits you offer in your competitive market
arena.
 Your brand promise: If your brand promise isn’t already clearly estab-
lished, turn to Chapter 6 to define the reasons customers choose your
business, the benefits people count on you to deliver, the experience
they expect to receive, and the promise they can absolutely count on
from your brand.
 Your brand character: Chapter 6 helps you arrive at a one-sentence
brand character statement that defines the personality of your brand
and the mood and tone that will be reflected through all brand expres-
sions, including every contact and experience with your brand.
 Your brand definition: Also called your brand identity statement, this
short definition wraps your target market, market position, point of dif-
ference, brand promise, and brand character into a single sentence that
directs all your branding efforts. Your brand definition is an internal
steering device, not an external marketing message. It’s a single sen-
tence that guides your brand’s development, following this format:
[Your name] promises [your target market] that they can count on us
for [your unique attribute or benefit] delivered with [information about the
character, tone, and mood you convey].
Putting your brand launch into context
You’re probably reading this book because you’re in the midst of creating a
new brand or revising an existing brand, either through a brand identity face-
lift or through a complete rebranding effort — which we liken to a branding
mulligan, where you write your last brand off and start all over again.
Either way, you need to be clear about why you’re doing what you’re doing.
What’s more, those who work with you, either as employees or as sharehold-
ers or customers, need to be clear about what you’re doing and why the
effort is worthwhile to the value of your organization.
To prepare for your brand launch, ready your answers to the following 
questions.
Why are you undertaking this branding effort?
Most branding programs aim to achieve one or more of the following 
outcomes:
147
Chapter 9: Countdown to Takeoff: Planning Your Brand Launch

 Build awareness: Awareness leads to marketplace dominance and easier
sales efforts, so awareness is usually a top objective in any brand
launch.
 Create an emotional connection: Brands need to build emotional con-
nections with their prospects, especially brands that deliver products
that contribute to a sense of personal satisfaction or security.
Additionally, brands aiming to enhance customer loyalty often target the
emotional connection, realizing that customers remain true to brands
they love.
 Differentiate your offering: For brands in crowded market categories —
where many competitors offer similar products, services, and promises —
differentiation is usually a key brand launch objective.
 Create or enhance credibility and trust: Every service or online busi-
ness needs to make credibility and trust a key branding priority because
service and online purchasers are, essentially, buying based on nothing
but trust. Customers can’t see, hold, or try out a service or online offer-
ing before saying “yes” or clicking Proceed to Checkout. Instead, they
buy based purely on the belief that the company will deliver on its
promise.
 Motivate purchases: Rapid sales growth is a key objective for those
introducing new consumer brands, largely because the retail market-
place offers only a small window of opportunity for a new brand to
prove marketplace acceptance before it’s booted off the shelf for some
other brand that delivers greater sales volume for the retailer.
For help determining your branding priorities, turn to Chapter 3. It includes a
worksheet to help you determine the strategic importance of various brand
functions to your branding success, while also helping you assess the pre-
launch strengths of your current brand if you’re undergoing a brand revital-
ization or rebranding program.
What do you expect your brand launch to achieve?
After you set your branding priorities (drawing from the list in the preceding
section), you need to set objectives for what you want your brand launch to
achieve. The more clearly you establish quantifiable outcomes for your
brand launch, the more quickly you win buy-in from shareholders, funding
partners, top-level executives, and the staff who will help you make your new
brand a success.
 If you’re starting a new business or brand, you’re starting from zero,
with no existing brand awareness, emotional connection, credibility,
brand differentiation, or sales momentum. Therefore, setting objectives
is a matter of determining how quickly you intend to reach certain levels
of success in each priority area.
148
Part III: Launching Your New Brand 

 If you’re realigning or rebranding an existing brand, begin by assess-
ing your pre-launch situation in each of the brand functions. Your exist-
ing success levels become the benchmark against which you measure
the success of your brand launch.
Chapter 3 can help as you determine your current success levels. For
help conducting research or enlisting professional assistance, turn to
the research sections in Chapter 4. When you know your benchmarks,
you can set your brand launch objectives by defining the increases you
intend to achieve above the pre-launch level in each priority area.
In either case, be realistic about how much change you can effect over the
brand launch period and how much it will cost in terms of marketing invest-
ment to gain the level of awareness and sales motivation you set out to
achieve. The market adopts change incrementally, which is a nice way to say
slowly, so set your objectives with your eyes wide open about the momentum
you’re likely to achieve.
Aim to monitor your success not just at the completion of your brand launch
but several times over the next year. Doing so allows you to measure how
your brand is doing in terms of increases in sales, distribution, market share,
and pricing, and also in terms of consumer awareness, preference, perceived
value, perceived point of difference, satisfaction, and desire to purchase,
repurchase, or refer to others.
Depending upon the size of your organization, you can conduct this research
on your own following the survey and interview advice in Chapter 4, or you
can turn to the professional assistance of a research firm. You can find
research firms through major city phone directories or by asking for referrals
from advertising agencies and branding firms.
What about timing?
If your brand launch will gain momentum with a tie-in with a major confer-
ence, trade show, or industry event, or if it will benefit from introduction at a
certain date for some other reason, make that date clear when you launch
the brand internally.
It’s easy for people in your company to get complacent about something that
seems like an aesthetic change, but if they realize that, on a certain date, the
curtain needs to rise and the brand needs to be ready to go in order to
achieve awareness and momentum, they’ll step on board with a greater sense
of mission.
149
Chapter 9: Countdown to Takeoff: Planning Your Brand Launch

What’s your message?
Before unveiling your brand internally or externally, be completely certain
about the single message you want the market to take away from your brand
launch program. By clarifying your brand introduction message in advance,
all brand communications — formal and informal, from the CEO to the front-
line staff — align, contributing to a strong, clear impression. To create your
message, follow the framework shown in Figure 9-1.
Producing prototypes to 
introduce your brand
As you prepare to introduce your brand, be ready to show how your brand
will appear in the marketplace over the coming weeks and months. Do this by
creating prototypes, also called mock-ups, of everything from signs to ads to
Web pages to uniforms, apparel, specialty items, and product packages. By
showing samples of how the brand will look in actual applications, you allow
people on your internal team to engage and interact with the brand. By

seeing how the identity works, they begin to put their attachments to previ-
ous brand identity representations, or their doubts about the newly adopted
identity representations, out of their minds.
Don’t skimp on the production of your prototypes. If the samples you show
aren’t impressive, the reaction to your brand won’t be impressive either.
Invest in prototypes that look as much like the real thing as possible. The
designers, ad agency, or brand consultants who help you with your branding
program can provide these prototypes.
Checking your internal readiness
In branding, what you say pales in comparison to what you do. The experience
your customers have with your brand trumps your logo presentation, advertis-
ing, and marketing efforts in a heartbeat. In fact, given the choice between a
beautifully presented brand identity that’s backed by an uneven brand experi-
ence and a marginally presented brand identity that’s backed by a brand expe-
rience that’s impeccably reinforced at every touch point, we and most other
brand consultants would vote for experience over identity any day.
To prepare your organization to consistently deliver on your brand promise,
create an inventory of all the ways people encounter your business. Evaluate
each contact point to see that it accurately reflects the mood, tone, and
promise of your brand. To get your evaluation started, begin with this list:
 Telephone: Do you answer phones promptly, consistently, and with a
message that reinforces your brand? Do voicemail recordings through-
out your company convey a common tone and message?
 In-person arrival: Are directions to your business clear and in keeping
with the character of your business? Is your business location a good
reflection of your brand? Does your front door (or your Web site’s home
page, if your business exists primarily online) make a strong, accurate
first impression? Upon arrival, does your entry area (or your home
page) make a strong statement for your brand? Are people greeted
promptly and in a manner that reflects your brand promise?
 Within your business: Is the look, sound, and even the smell of your
business in keeping with your brand character? Do your employees
reflect your brand identity by the way they look and act, the clothes
they wear, and the way they interact with customers?
 Correspondence: Have you standardized mail and e-mail correspon-
dence so that all communications, whether they come from a salesper-
son, an invoice clerk, or a service representative, create an echo
chamber for the quality and caliber of your brand?
151
Chapter 9: Countdown to Takeoff: Planning Your Brand Launch

 Service: The service cycle involves eight steps — initial contact, establish-
ment of rapport, product presentation, sale negotiation and transaction,
payment, product delivery, follow-up to confirm customer satisfaction, and
ongoing customer service and communication. Monitor how well your
brand is reflected at each of these contact points. If at any one your cus-
tomer has an uneven experience with your brand, your brand promise is
eroded and the strength of your brand is weakened.
The minute you feel your organization is ready to deliver a consistent brand
experience at every customer touch point, you’re ready for brand launch.
Previewing your brand story 
with priority audiences
Prior to the public launch of your brand and again on at least an annual basis,
take your brand story to your most important outside audiences: Your
investors and your best customers.
Taking your brand story to investors and analysts
We don’t mean to sound too much like Yogi Berra, but the best thing you can
do to enhance market investment in your brand is to build and manage a
great brand in the first place.
The financial world watches the Interbrand and BusinessWeek annual surveys
on power brands (see Chapter 22) for a reason: Investors realize that a good
way to monitor a firm’s earning potential is to monitor the strength of its
branding program.
In addition to watching how a brand stacks up in national studies, investors
watch how well brands send out strong brand management signals. When
presenting to investors, be aware that they consider the following line-up of
questions, and make the answers part of your presentation:
 Does the brand convey the same identity, message, and promise when
dealing with all its stakeholder groups, from investors to consumers to
employees?
 Does the brand express itself through an integrated marketing program
that projects the same look, tone, message, and promise in advertising, in
fulfillment materials, online, and in its bricks-and-mortar establishments?
 Does the brand retain its customers — an indication that it delivers well
on its brand promise?
152
Part III: Launching Your New Brand 

 Does the brand have coordinated internal management, as evidenced by
a brand experience that’s without variation whether it’s encountered as
a prospect, a customer, a job applicant, a supplier, or an investor?
If your organization seeks support from the investment community, first build
a branding program that evokes a strong “yes” response to each of the pre-
ceding questions.
Then, at the time of brand launch and periodically thereafter, deliver your
brand story to the investor and analyst community by
 Creating an investor/analyst presentation that features your brand story
and success indicators
For examples of brand presentations, enter “investor analyst brand pre-
sentation” in your favorite search engine. The results should lead you to
corporate sites that allow you to click on investor podcasts, Webcasts,
presentations, news releases, and fact sheets.
 Taking your presentation directly to major investment partners and
hosting centrally located events for the general investor community to
attend
 Backing your live presentations with Webcasts and podcasts for those
who can’t attend the event in person
 Following presentations with news release recaps to investment firms
and financial media
 Posting all investor/analyst information in the online pressroom area of
your Web site
Treating your best customers to an insiders’ preview
The trick to turning customers into brand ambassadors is keeping your brand
promise without fail, delivering a consistently compelling brand experience,
and making your best customers feel not only valued but also treasured.
Whether you’re rebranding, revitalizing your brand, revamping your brand,
or introducing a subbrand or brand extension, don’t risk upsetting your best
and most loyal customers by letting them hear the news through the grapevine.
Deliver the news personally, host customer brand preview events, and plan
ways to allow old customers to embrace your new brand through a brand
introduction program that turns customers into ambassadors for your com-
pany. Chapter 14 gives you advice to follow in this area.
153
Chapter 9: Countdown to Takeoff: Planning Your Brand Launch

Ten, Nine, Eight . . . Writing Your 
Brand Launch Marketing Plan
Assemble your brand launch plans into a document that will guide your
brand introduction. By putting a plan in writing, you force yourself to clarify
the objectives you’re seeking to achieve, the strategy and tactics you’ll
follow, the timeline you’ll meet, and the budget you’ll live within.
You can launch your brand without a plan or with a plan that exists only in
your head, but you shouldn’t. It’s far easier to stick to your timeline, strategy,
and budget; to meet your objectives; and to enlist the support of team mem-
bers when your plan is in writing on a couple sheets of paper that all those
who share responsibility for success can review, adopt, and buy into.
Follow these ten steps to compile your brand launch plans into a document
that guides your brand introduction. The following sections delve into some
of these steps in greater detail.
1. State your brand introduction message, following the template pre-
sented in Figure 9-1.
2. Benchmark your pre-launch situation by determining your brand’s
current levels of awareness, emotional connection, distinction, credi-
bility and trust, and sales.
3. Set your market launch objectives by prioritizing what you want your
launch to accomplish and by pinning each priority to a measurable
outcome, such as a percentage increase in brand awareness, emo-
tional connection, distinction, credibility and trust, and sales.
4. Define your target market so that you can direct communications
specifically toward this group.
5. Define the brand promise and brand character that must be conveyed
in all brand communications and experiences.
6. Establish your brand introduction strategies, including your product
strategy, distribution strategy, pricing strategy, and promotion strategy.
7. Detail your marketing tactics, including how you’ll use advertising,
publicity, promotions, online marketing, sales efforts, packaging, and
point-of-sale efforts to introduce your brand.
8. Establish your budget.
9. Create your action plan and timeline.
10. Measure and monitor your success.
154
Part III: Launching Your New Brand 

Benchmarking your pre-launch situation
Chapters 3 and 4 include information on assessing your market situation and
conducting research to find out more about your brand’s awareness, distinc-
tion, and preference in your market. Use the form in Figure 9-2 to benchmark
your pre-launch situation and to monitor shifts in brand presence and perfor-
mance during the post-launch period.
Setting your goal and objectives
Your goal is what you want your brand launch to achieve; your objectives
define how you’ll achieve your goal. For example:
 If your goal is to win awareness for your brand and its distinctions,
your objectives may include gaining name recognition and knowledge
of your unique point of difference among a defined percentage of con-
sumers in your target market with in a certain length of time from the
conclusion of your brand launch.
 If your goal is to enhance credibility and trust, your objectives may be
to achieve awareness of and belief in your point of difference and your
brand promise among a defined percentage of consumers in your target
market within a certain length of time from the conclusion of your brand
launch.
 If your goal is to motivate sales, your objective may be to add at least
one new distribution channel and to realize a specified sales increase
without sacrificing unit sale price within a certain length of time from
the conclusion of your brand launch.
Commit your goals and objectives to writing in order to keep your efforts
focused only on marketing strategies and tactics that contribute to your suc-
cess. Then each time a new marketing opportunity arises, you can put it to
this easy litmus test: Will this opportunity help us meet our goal? Does it sup-
port one or more of our objectives? If the answer is “no,” you can quickly
decline the offer and turn your attention back to your plan.

Part III: Launching Your New Brand 

Defining your target market
In defining your target market, answer these questions:
 Are you targeting new customers?
 Are you targeting existing customers?
 Are you targeting those in a position to refer customers to your business
or to speak on your behalf?
 Will your introductory efforts be confined geographically to a specific
city or region, or will they target broadly dispersed consumers who fit a
defined prospect profile?
Targeting your market puts you in a position to reach prospects effectively
with well-chosen media and messages. It also helps you plan staffing and dis-
tribution to meet the market demand your communications generate.
Nearly all successful brand introductions start with narrowly focused target
markets for these reasons:
 A brand introduction requires intensive communication in order to
rapidly achieve a necessary level of awareness. It’s far easier and vastly
more affordable to achieve intensive communication when prospects all
live in a limited geographic area that can be reached with regional media,
or when they share lifestyle or interest similarities that allow you to
reach them with special interest media or one-to-one communications.
 Most brand introductions come from small businesses that work with
relatively small budgets. Huge corporations either buy and reintroduce
existing brands or introduce parent-dominant brands that slide into the
market under the strong umbrella identity of the well-known corporate
brand. Nearly all other brands start with budget, distribution, and
staffing constraints that are best managed by introduction in highly
focused target markets.
 Even major brands benefit from target marketing at the time of intro-
duction. By introducing a brand in a single geographic market or through
a single distribution channel or even a single retail chain, the brand can
achieve a high level of awareness while building a success story that cre-
ates publicity, word-of-mouth, and other forms of viral marketing.
Setting your strategies
Most marketing plans include strategies for the 4Ps: product, pricing, promo-
tion, and place (or distribution channels). When creating the marketing plan
for your brand introduction, establish the strategy you’ll follow in each of
these four areas:
157
Chapter 9: Countdown to Takeoff: Planning Your Brand Launch

 Product: Most brand launches revolve around the announcement of an
altogether new offering or the announcement of changes to an existing
offering. Be aware that new products require a higher level of introduc-
tion, explanation, and purchase motivation than are required by product
revisions, which are often introduced to an already committed audience.
 Pricing: If one of your brand introduction priorities is to achieve new
sales, particularly from new customers, your pricing strategy is an
essential element in your brand introduction. To motivate decisions,
consider limited-term introductory pricing or payment options, rebates,
trial offers, or other purchase incentives.
 Promotion: Your promotion strategy describes how you’ll get the word
out about your brand. Most brand launch promotions involve public
relations, advertising, and online communications, each described in
detail in Chapters 10, 11, and 12.
 Place or distribution: Your brand introduction needs to be backed by a
distribution strategy that allows consumers to access the product as
soon as interest is ignited. To a business-to-business brand marketer, the
distribution strategy may take the form of a new location, new Web site,
or some other new means of access. To a consumer brand marketer, the
distribution strategy must lead to an easy-to-access purchase point.
Often, businesses introduce consumer brands first through a single dis-
tribution point or chain. This approach allows the marketer to maximize
in-store visibility while minimizing the requirements of distributor dis-
counts and slotting fees that can erode profits to the point of killing a
consumer brand before it has time to get off the ground.
Selecting your brand introduction tactics
In order to achieve cost-effective visibility and credibility, most brand
launches rely heavily on publicity and public relations rather than on adver-
tising, which often is used as a follow-up to news and personally delivered
announcements of the new brand.
As you plan the tactics you’ll use to deliver your brand introduction message
in your target market, keep the following points in mind:
 Public relations activities are the backbone of most brand introductions.
The field of public relations includes employee or member relations, com-
munity relations, industry relations, government relations, and media rela-
tions that result in news coverage of your brand introduction message.
Events, meetings, newsletters, exhibitions, and publicity all fall under the
category of public relations. All spread news and generate understanding
without involving paid advertising. Turn to Chapter 10 as you plan your
public relations game plan.
158
Part III: Launching Your New Brand 

 Promotions are marketing activities that aim to trigger a desired con-
sumer action over a short period of time. Marketers launching con-
sumer brands use promotions to win support from distributors and
retailers and to prompt customers to a first-time trial of the new prod-
uct. See Chapter 11 for guidelines on promotions.
 Advertising creates awareness in audiences reached by newspapers,
magazines, radio, and television. Most consumer brands, as well as
most brands being introduced over large market areas, use advertising
to convey their brand messages to broadly dispersed markets. Chapter
11 offers advice for scheduling, creating, and placing your ads.
When using advertising as a brand launch tactic, time your ad schedules
so that ads break after your brand is released via news stories. After
your message runs in ad form, editorial contacts may not view it as
news, and you forego the chance to gain the credible third-party voice of
a reporter or newscaster.
 Direct mail is advertising that’s delivered on a one-to-one basis to mail
boxes or e-mail in-boxes rather than through mass media. It’s a great
way to provide invitations, detailed information, or publicity reinforce-
ment to individuals who are targeted because they precisely match your
customer profile. Follow the advice in Chapter 11 on how to create great
ads as you create your direct mailers. If you’re delivering your mailers
via e-mail, turn to Chapter 12 for information on how to create e-mail
that gets opened and read.
 Personal presentations and sales efforts are especially important to
brand launches that depend on personal relationships, referrals, or sup-
port from established contacts and customers. Most business and ser-
vice brands include launch events and personal presentations as essential
introduction tactics. Chapter 13 covers how to prepare your sales force
and how to take your brand story on the road to key audiences.
 Sales materials, packaging, and point-of-sale displays are essential for
consumer brands and for brands that involve complex features, high
prices, or considerable deliberation prior to the purchase decision.
For all but the smallest local market brands, sales and packaging materi-
als require the design talents of established professionals. Begin by
answering the communication planning questions in Chapter 11 and
then hire a designer, ad agency, branding, or packaging specialist to
create your materials. Chapter 11 can help you through the selection
and hiring process.
 Online communications play an increasingly important role in brand
introduction tactical plans, as described in Chapter 12.

Part III: Launching Your New Brand 

Takeoff! Launching Your Brand
Remember that your brand launch needs to happen in two phases: an inter-
nal phase and then an external phase. Only after your internal team is on
board and every customer touch point is in alignment and ready to deliver on
your brand promise are you ready to take your brand outside your organiza-
tion and to your target market.
Launching internally
Conduct your internal launch in two phases: the first one for senior manage-
ment and the second one for your full employee team. This sequence is
important because you need to ensure that all executives are firmly on board
before you start rallying the troops. Otherwise, you risk gaining enthusiasm
from employees only to have some vice president (also known as someone’s
boss) say something like, “I don’t know why we’re spending so much time
and money on this.” Just like that, internal support for your branding pro-
gram can take a giant backslide.
If your company is small to medium in size, your two-phase internal launch
can happen over a short time period. If you’re dealing with multiple locations
or divisions, however, it will take longer. Either way, by involving executives
in the brand planning and development phase, you cut down the time needed
to bring top-level leaders on board because they’re part of the planning team
from the beginning.
Starting with the bigwigs: Launching with upper management
Your internal brand launch definitely requires a from-the-top-down approach
that starts with top-level executives and moves on to company-wide man-
agers before reaching your full employee corps.
Representatives of the executive group were likely involved in the brand
development process, so your management brand launch isn’t likely to be an
unveiling as much as a chance to bring the whole brand picture into focus.
Follow these steps as you launch your brand with your executive team:
1. Review and win unanimous consent for your brand position, promise,
character, definition, and launch message.
If some executives have questions or doubts, take time to address them
at this phase of the launch so that all leaders are reading from the same
page when your brand message moves into your organization.

Chapter 9: Countdown to Takeoff: Planning Your Brand Launch

2. Gain agreement regarding your brand launch objectives and timing.
If some executives see timing conflicts between the brand launch and
other company activities, iron out the kinks by altering the schedule,
shifting launch responsibilities to other executives, or hiring employees
or outside professionals to handle the tasks involved. No matter what,
deal with the conflict at this stage of the launch so that it doesn’t
become a barrier to success as you implement your broader launch.
3. Preview the materials you’ll be presenting at your company-wide
brand launch.
The tasks covered in the section “Preparing for Your Brand Launch” ear-
lier in this chapter help you prepare your presentation materials. Before
using them at your company launch, preview them with your executives
to ensure that there won’t be any surprises (or resistance) at the time of
the company-wide presentation.
4. Discuss and win agreement regarding how the departments overseen
by each senior executive can tangibly integrate the brand promise
into every aspect of the organization’s products and services.
Chapter 14 includes a form for conducting a brand experience audit.
Consider asking your executive team to use the form as they assess any
brand contact points in need of repair and as they take responsibility for
implementing change in their individual management arenas.
Launching company-wide
By taking the time to explain why you’re branding, rebranding, or revitalizing
your brand and how your efforts link to your business mission and goals, you
preempt internal resistance and kick-start the process of creating a team of
champions for your brand. (Turn to Chapter 13 for complete information on
turning your staff and business partners into your best brand champions.)
The company-wide brand launch should be both an education process and a
company rally. For a successful launch, follow these steps:
1. Make a case about the value of branding.
If you can’t connect the idea of branding to the company vision, mission,
values, and goals, you’re setting yourself up to hear murmurs of, “They
paid how much for that?” Turn to the section “Putting your brand launch
into context” earlier in this chapter for advice on announcing your
brand in terms that link it to your company’s vision, values, and goals.
162
Part III: Launching Your New Brand 

2. Present your brand strategy, putting special emphasis on the brand
promise and the importance of a brand experience that’s reflected
through every point of encounter with your business.
Refer to the section “Checking your internal readiness” earlier in this
chapter as you prepare for this step.
3. Unveil your brand identity.
Show the logo, preview the slogan, and present prototypes of how the
brand identity will appear on marketing materials over coming weeks
and months.
4. Give each employee a quality gift — a hat, shirt, pen, or other item —
featuring the new logo.
The nicer the item, the better the impression, so avoid anything cheap
or cheesy unless that’s the image you want your employees to take away
with them. Instead, accompany your internal brand launch with distribu-
tion of quality items that employees will like and want to keep. No click-
top pens with flaky metallic imprints up the side, please!
As you hand out your logo gifts, remind employees of the external
launch date and ask them to keep your identity under wraps until that
day arrives. If your staff is too large to control, consider holding the dis-
tribution of gifts until the external launch occurs.
5. Ask each member of your team to personally embrace the brand
and become an ambassador who delivers the brand experience to 
customers.
We cover this step in more detail in Chapter 13.
Launching externally
Only when your company is ready to walk the talk is it time to take your
brand introduction message to the world outside your business. When your
brand experience is ready for prime time, amplify the message to your busi-
ness world by following these steps:
1. Time your external launch to coincide with public interest in your story.
If you serve a particular industry, consider timing your launch to coin-
cide with a major conference or trade show. If you serve a local market,
time your launch to coincide with an annual economic development con-
ference, regional business fair, or some other event that brings regional
leaders and media together in one place.
163
Chapter 9: Countdown to Takeoff: Planning Your Brand Launch

2. Launch a public relations program to carry your brand message into
the market.
3. Place ads stating your brand and the promise it makes.
4. Unveil your brand promise and message on the home page of your
Web site.
As you announce your brand outside your organization, use the information
in Chapters 10, 11, and 12 to leverage publicity to launch your brand, adver-
tise to put your stake in the ground, and put the power of the Internet to
work to spread your brand message far and wide.

Getting the Word Out with 
Public Relations
In This Chapter
 Telegraphing your brand introduction via public relations
 Targeting and getting the attention of news media outlets
 Developing your publicity resources
P
ublic relations, also known as PR, is a term that’s often misused and even
abused. Contrary to common misperception, public relations isn’t a
fancy name for publicity, although publicity is the element of public relations
that most marketers work the hardest to achieve. For that matter, even the
term publicity comes with a set of misconceptions, including the idea that
publicity is a free substitute for advertising or that it’s a way to fix a brand
image through — to use the term of the decade — spin.
To set the record straight, public relations involves all the activities — includ-
ing employee, community, industry, and government relations; customer and
prospect events and communications; publicity; and even crisis management —
that marketers use to build and develop a favorable image among all the
public audiences that contribute to the brand’s success. In the words of the
Public Relations Society of America, “Public relations helps an organization
and its public adapt mutually to each other.”
Simply put, public relations is the matchmaker between what you believe
about your brand and what your public audiences believe about your brand.
It’s no wonder, then, that most brands ride into public view on the magic
carpet of a public relations program.
This chapter helps you plan and implement your brand introduction public
relations program. It offers a description of what’s involved in a well-rounded
public relations program and tells you where publicity fits into the picture
and how to orchestrate a publicity program that nets news coverage for your
brand announcement.

Creating Your Brand Launch PR Plan
Most new brands enter the marketplace via public relations efforts for three
reasons:
 Most new brands are launched by entrepreneurs and small businesses
with target niche markets easily reached by presentations, events, and
publicity.
 New brands benefit from the understanding and credibility generated by
public relations and publicity efforts, which often cost less to implement
than advertising programs.
 As soon as a brand is announced via advertising, it falls out of the break-
ing news category and enters the realm of promotional marketing.
Therefore, most new brand marketers begin their introductions using
public relations efforts to reach key editorial, business, client, and
prospect groups before the brand introduction message goes to the
mass market via promotional advertising.
As you launch your brand using public relations tactics, the following infor-
mation can help you understand all the available avenues and assemble your
public relations game plan.
Covering all the bases
A public relations program is comprised of a number of different components
because the “public” for any organization is divided into various interest
groups, which are also called stakeholder groups. For instance, the program
you’ll use to communicate with your employee group will likely differ from
the program you’ll use to communicate with your investor group because
each group has different interests and wants different kinds of information.
When developing your brand launch public relations plan, consider the fol-
lowing program components.
Employee or member relations
This avenue, also known as internal relations, is where your brand launch
starts. It involves communication with employees or members (in the case of
cooperatives or associations) so that they know your full brand message
before it goes into the more public marketplace.
166
Part III: Launching Your New Brand 

Internal relations involves everything from sharing the story of why you’re
investing in a branding program to training employees to represent your
brand and deliver on your brand message and promise.
Refer to Chapter 9 for help preparing for your internal launch. Then turn to
Chapter 13 as you use internal relations on an ongoing basis to turn your
employees into a team of champions for your brand.
Any brand introduction that fails to include insiders first is in for trouble.
That’s why the unveiling of your brand needs to start within your organiza-
tion. Use meetings, events, communication programs, and information dis-
semination to build employee awareness and to generate support among the
very people who will end up representing your brand image and delivering
your brand experience on a daily basis.
Community relations
Creating visibility and understanding for your brand in your home commu-
nity is especially important if your market is local or if you want to establish
your business and brand as forces in your own backyard. To gain community
awareness, follow these steps:
1. Introduce your brand through regional news stories.
Follow our advice in the section “Extra! Extra! Making News” later in this
chapter for targeting and providing news stories to local media.
2. Gain awareness among community leaders, business and government
leaders, and key customers by previewing your brand at a brand
launch event.
Consider timing your brand launch to coincide with a major conference
or trade show where industry leaders, media representatives, and cus-
tomers are gathered looking for news stories. Or, if you serve a local
market, time your launch to coincide with an annual economic develop-
ment conference, regional business fair, or some other event that brings
regional leaders and media together in one place.
3. Use the brand launch as the beginning of an ongoing effort to estab-
lish your name, message, and brand promise in the minds of commu-
nity residents and leaders by joining groups, participating in
charitable efforts, and contributing time, products, services, or funds
to support projects that benefit your home market region.
Building a local reputation takes considerably more time than the dura-
tion of your brand launch program. However, your launch provides an
ideal opportunity to introduce — or to reintroduce in the case of brand
revitalization or rebranding — your brand in your home community.
167
Chapter 10: Getting the Word Out with Public Relations

Industry relations
If your brand meets the needs of a vertical market, which is a market with
specialized interest in a particular industry or area, consider timing your
launch to coincide with a major industry event.
Vertical markets span the alphabet from advertising to zoos, and each has its
own industry association and annual gathering. By arranging your brand
launch to coincide with a major industry conference or trade show, you can
introduce your brand to customers, suppliers, industry leaders, and repre-
sentatives of industry-specific media outlets all in one fell swoop.
If your business (or your budget) is too small to merit major industry event
presence, you can still employ industry relations as part of your public rela-
tions program. Use the advice in the section “Introducing Your Brand with
Publicity” later in this chapter to cultivate industry-specific media relations
and resulting publicity. Also, consider joining your industry association
and taking a leadership position. If you do, your business benefits in two
major ways:
 You keep your business at the forefront of industry advances.
 You acquire industry information that you can share with local and 
business media, making you a valuable news resource and giving your
business valuable news exposure at the same time.
Government relations
If your business is regulated or depends on relationships with elected offi-
cials, include government relations in your overall public relations program.
Whether your focus is local — on your mayor, city councilors, and county
leaders — or whether it goes to the state or national level, take time as part
of your brand launch to make a special introduction to your relevant leaders
by employing one or several of these approaches:
 Distribute information to key government leaders. The officials may be
too busy to sit down for a meeting with you, but they’ll take note if you
send a mailing, perhaps in the form of a brand launch press kit with a
cover letter. In the letter, briefly explain the reasons behind your brand
launch and your aspiration to be a positive employer and economic
engine in your marketplace. Refer them to the press kit for more infor-
mation, and add an invitation to count on your business as an industry
resource or to offer assistance with relevant projects.
 Add government officials to the invitation list for your community
brand launch event.
168
Part III: Launching Your New Brand 

 Keep in contact by sending copies of company news releases, reprints
of favorable news features or articles, annual reports, and other indi-
cators of your success.
Media relations
Publicity delivers your message through news mentions in mass media out-
lets. A carefully orchestrated and impeccably maintained media relations pro-
gram results in publicity that benefits your brand in three ways:
 Publicity is often a cost-effective way to gain media exposure. Sure, it
costs money to write and distribute news releases and to cultivate
media relationships. But unlike advertising, publicity isn’t purchased.
You obtain it as a result of editorial contacts and information delivery
rather than through paid ad placements.
 Publicity contributes to your credibility for the simple reason that
people find editorial content more convincing and believable than simi-
lar information delivered through paid ads.
 After you obtain publicity, you can reproduce the articles or news seg-
ments and circulate them as part of your marketing efforts, including
them on your Web site, in direct mailings, as part of presentations, and
in press kits.
Successful media relations rely on targeted and established editorial relation-
ships, distribution of newsworthy releases and story ideas, and ongoing
availability as a reliable and trustworthy news resource. The section titled
“Extra! Extra! Making News” later in this chapter gives you advice to follow
for meeting these requirements.
Writing your public relations game plan
A public relations program doesn’t just happen. In fact, without a firm com-
mitment to the task and a dedicated plan to follow, it’s too easy to turn your
energies toward building sales or putting out management fires and, as a
result, neglect the opportunity to build and develop a favorable image for
your brand among your public audiences or stakeholder groups.
To outline the public relations program you’ll use to introduce your brand,
follow these steps:
1. Define and prioritize your audiences and communication approaches.
Go through the list in the preceding section and determine which
approaches — employee relations, community relations, industry rela-
tions, government relations, and media relations — are most important
to the success of your brand launch.
169
Chapter 10: Getting the Word Out with Public Relations

Nearly all brand launches begin with a focus on employees and internal
audiences. From there, depending on the objectives of the introduction,
each brand launch follows a different public relations path. If you seek
to heighten awareness in general or industry-specific markets, the media
is a primary target audience for your brand launch. If you seek to
heighten customer loyalty or support, you should focus efforts on cur-
rent customers. If you’re seeking enhanced credibility in your market-
place, your emphasis should be on industry, community, and
government leaders.
2. Select and prioritize your public relations tactics.
When you’re clear about your target audiences, you’re ready to choose
which tactics will best deliver your message to those you’re trying to
reach. Publicity, mailings, hosted events, personal presentations, and
participation in community or industry gatherings are among the most
frequently used public relations tactics. (If you think your public rela-
tions skills could use a brush-up, start by turning to Public Relations For
Dummies, 2nd Edition by Eric Yaverbaum, Robert W. Bly, and Ilise Benun
[Wiley].)
3. Establish your public relations program budget by allocating the
funds necessary to implement each of your scheduled public relations
tactics.
Chapter 9 includes a budget worksheet. As you complete the public 
relations portion of the budget, include all the expenses you project for
launch events (for employees, customers, investors, business associ-
ates, community leaders, and industry or trade gatherings), publicity
generation (including media kit development and news release genera-
tion and distribution), and direct mailings to stakeholder groups. Also,
include costs for professional assistance from designers, publicists, or
public relations firms if your program exceeds the capabilities or capac-
ity of those on your staff.
4. Establish your action plan and timeline.
Assign dates by which each tactic must be planned and implemented.
Then assign responsibility for getting the task completed on time so that
your plan and your brand introduction take advantage of every public
relations opportunity.
When your public relations plan is down on paper, insert it into your brand
launch marketing plan under the section titled “Promotional Strategy.” See
Chapter 9 for step-by-step help in writing your overall marketing plan if you
haven’t yet prepared one.
170
Part III: Launching Your New Brand 

Introducing Your Brand with Publicity
Your brand launch is an ideal opportunity to generate publicity if — and this
is a big if — you can turn it into a newsworthy story, which means a story
that contains news of interest to the audience of the news outlet in which you
hope the story will appear.
In brand launch after brand launch, we’ve learned this valuable lesson: Unless
your brand already enjoys a sky-high level of public awareness and interest,
audiences don’t really care that you have a new or revitalized brand identity.
What they do care about is how your brand announcement matters to them
and their lives. They care if you’ve launched a new business or product that’s
projected to create 12 new jobs in your market area, or if your new line of ser-
vices fulfills a demonstrated market desire, or if your expansion into national
or international markets will positively impact the local economy.
Ask yourself, “How is our brand announcement important to the audience of
the media outlet where we want a story to run or air?” When you have a clear
answer, prepare to generate publicity by following these steps:
1. Decide the target audiences you want to reach via publicity and the
nature of the story you want consumers to see, hear, or read about
your brand launch.
Depending on your objectives, you may want to get your story to the
financial world, to those in your industry, to your local community, or
specifically to those who are or are likely to become customers of your
business.
2. Target media outlets by researching and selecting publications and
broadcast vehicles that reach the audiences you’re trying to reach.
If your objective is to reach customers but you’re not completely certain
about your customer profile, flip to Chapter 5 and complete the
Customer Profile Worksheet.
3. Prepare and distribute your news, either via personal calls during
which you share story ideas and provide background information or
via news releases that you hand-deliver, fax, mail, or e-mail to editor-
ial contacts.
171
Chapter 10: Getting the Word Out with Public Relations

Matching publicity efforts to 
your brand launch objectives
As you work on your brand launch, you welcome all good publicity, but you
derive the most value from publicity that carries your story to your highest-
priority audiences, which are the audiences whose positive opinions are
most likely to contribute to your success.
To set your publicity generation efforts off in the right direction, begin by
defining who you most want to reach via publicity, the story you want to
convey, and the type of media that’s most likely to carry your news to your
target audiences.
Refer to Table 10-1 as you create your publicity game plan.

Targeting media outlets
The media list for your brand launch publicity program may be so short that
it includes only the few news outlets in your hometown, or it may be long
enough to list all the publications, broadcast outlets, wire services, and Web
sites that reach your market locally, regionally, nationally, and globally.
Long or short, your target media list should be limited only to media outlets
that reach your target audience and that carry news of the nature you’re
working to spread. The following sections provide advice to follow, resources
to tap, and how-to information for developing your list.
Knowing the right media outlets when you see them
Put media outlets on your list only if they match your needs on the following
fronts:
 Geographically, they serve audiences in the market areas you wish to
reach.
 Their audiences are comprised of people with the lifestyle interests and
demographics — age, gender, education level, income level, and so on —
of those you’re trying to reach.
 Their editorial focus aligns with the nature of your story.
 Their audiences are likely to be interested in your news.
News editors confirm that the preceding advice gets ignored on a regular
basis. As a result, community newspapers receive releases with no local news
slant whatsoever, national outlets get releases regarding local stories with no
broad-reaching impact, and special interest media outlets receive news of no
173
Chapter 10: Getting the Word Out with Public Relations

significance to the interests they serve. It’s no surprise that the misdirected
news stories take a direct route from in-box to trash bin. Save your news 
from this demise by first researching news outlets to be sure they match up
with the nature of your news and then crafting the presentation of your news
to match up with the needs of the editors and audiences you’re seeking to
influence.
Tapping into media list resources
As you develop your target media list, turn to the following resources:
 dir.yahoo.com/News_and_Media: This online directory of general
and industry-specific news outlets categorizes outlets by news and
media formats and subjects.
 Bacon’s Media Directories: Available by subscription online
(www.bacons.com) and in the reference section of major libraries,
these media directories profile U.S. and Canadian newspapers, broad-
cast outlets, and Internet media.
 Standard Rate and Data Service (SRDS) Media Source books: Available
by subscription online (www.srds.com) and in most major libraries,
SRDS provides media profiles, advertising data, and contact information
for business publications, consumer and trade magazines, newspapers,
and interactive media sources.
Creating your list
When you know which media outlets reach those in your target audiences,
create your target media list. For each media outlet, record the following:
 Media outlet name and contact information, including mailing and e-mail
addresses, general phone number, and Web site address
 Media publishing or broadcast frequency, circulation or reach statistics,
and deadline information
 Editorial contact information, including the name or names and contact
information for those managing or reporting on the type of news you’ll
be generating
Prioritizing editorial contacts
Go through your complete target media list and select outlets that most effec-
tively reach your target markets with editorial content that best matches up
with the kind of news stories you’ll be circulating. For instance, local media
may be more interested in stories about how your branding efforts will affect
the size and success of your business in the local market area, whereas indus-
try press may be more interested in stories that describe how your branding
program will set a new direction in your business arena.
174
Part III: Launching Your New Brand 

As you put media outlets on your high-priority target media list — the list of
outlets that you want to cultivate for in-depth editorial relationships — find
out everything you can about the outlet so you can match your stories
accordingly. For each media outlet on your high-priority list, obtain the fol-
lowing information:
 The name and title of the editor or reporter you should contact with
information for stories in the sections or programs that cover your area
of interest
If contact lists for editors and reporters aren’t available on the media
Web site, try calling the media outlet’s main phone number and asking
for the name of the person on the editorial staff to whom you should
send business news and story ideas. When you obtain the name, ask for
a direct phone number and e-mail address, too. Record this information
on your high-priority media contact list.
 The lead time each outlet requires for story pitches and placements
 Story angle and news submission preferences
Although all media outlets on your target media list are valuable and important
to your publicity program, your high-priority editorial contacts are the ones to
whom you’ll give special attention. They’re the ones most apt to deliver in-
depth coverage that goes straight to your most important audiences.
Pitching your story
Instead of simply crossing your fingers and sending a news release, contact
high-priority contacts in advance and pitch your story. Your goal is to pro-
vide a heads-up about your upcoming news and to persuade each contact to
cover the story. When pitching stories, keep these points in mind:
 Do your homework in advance. Before making contact, know the media
outlet’s format, deadlines, and audience as well as the editorial contact you
want to talk to and the program, section, or column where your news fits.
 Be newsworthy. Editorial staff members aren’t interested in promotional
messages. They want to know that the story you’re proposing is of inter-
est to their audiences and that it fits well within their editorial format.
 Be concise and compelling. Your contacts are on tight deadlines, so be
ready to pitch your story quickly and completely.
 Be professional in your delivery. Don’t hem and haw, stumble to find
words, or sound uncertain about the story you’re proposing.
 Get the information you need to fulfill the interest you generate.
When the reporter shows interest, obtain information about how to
deliver your news — in person or by mail, fax, or e-mail — and by what
deadline.
175
Chapter 10: Getting the Word Out with Public Relations

When pitching your brand introduction story to high-priority media contacts
(either verbally or in writing), you should limit your presentation to 400 words
or less. Plan your presentation by compiling these elements, in order:
1. Introduction: In an attention-getting introduction, describe your pro-
posed story and how it relates to the interests of the media outlet’s
audience.
For example: “After a year of research, development, testing, and
approval, our company is unveiling the new identity of ABC Company,
including its revolutionary line of all-natural plant-pest control products
that will be manufactured here in River City and shipped worldwide to
enhance environmentally responsible crop production on an estimated
500 million acres over the upcoming three years.”
2. Story overview: Summarize what makes your announcement news-
worthy; how it’s relevant to current events, audience interests, and
market trends; and any research or supporting material you can 
provide to the editor.
3. Desired coverage: Mention the kind of coverage you seek: a feature
story, news coverage, event coverage, interview of an executive or
industry official, attendance at media conference, and so on.
4. Additional information: Describe how you can assist in story 
development.
You don’t have to provide material at the time of the pitch, but explain
the kinds of material you’re prepared to provide, from artwork to market
trends to company history to arrangements for interviews and so on.
5. Contact information: Provide contact information so the editor can
get back to you with a story decision or requests for additional 
information.
6. Follow-up: Offer to provide a short summary of your pitch via e-mail
as a follow-up to your conversation and to confirm your contact 
information.
Preparing and distributing news releases
News releases are the standard currency in the publicity realm. Whether
you’re delivering news in person, at a news event, or by hand, mail, or e-mail,
the minimum standard is to pass along a news release that summarizes your
story and says who to contact for more information.
176
Part III: Launching Your New Brand 

In the past, nearly all news releases were printed on paper and delivered by
hand, mail, or fax to editorial contacts. Today, most news releases are created
electronically and delivered via e-mail, with hard-copy versions available for
subsequent handout and follow-up. Additionally, a growing number of compa-
nies now package news into audio or video form for ready-to-go transmission
to broadcast audiences.
The following sections tell you how to proceed with each of these news
release approaches.
Hard-copy news releases
Printed news releases generally fit on no more than two double-spaced pages
that provide the following information, in the following order:
1. Whom to contact for more information: Along the top of the page, type,
“For more information:” followed by the name, telephone number and
e-mail address of the person who can provide additional facts.
2. When the news can be released: Most releases follow the “For more
information” section with the announcement that the news is “For
Immediate Release.” If it’s absolutely necessary to hold the news until a
certain time, instead of typing, “For Immediate Release,” use the space
to announce an embargo, stating that the news may not be released until
a set date or time; for instance, “Embargo until 12:01am January 15,
2007.” If you embargo your news, be sure that you have a very good
reason why it can’t be released earlier and that the reason is made clear
in the news release (for instance, “On January 15, Global Enterprises
announced its merger with Worldwide Business . . .”). Call editorial con-
tacts in advance to alert them to the time sensitivities, and see that your
own organization keeps a lid on the news until the date that you autho-
rize the media to announce it.
3. A succinct headline: On no more than two lines, summarize the topic
of the news release in a statement that uses active voice as opposed
to passive voice. For example, use “New Brand Identity Appeals to
Expanded Global Marketplace” instead of “New Logo Unveiled.”
4. The news release dateline: The body of the release begins with the
name of the city and the abbreviation of the state from which the news
originates, followed by the date of the release (for example, “PORTLAND,
OR, December 1, 2006”).
5. The news: Present your news in an inverted pyramid style that tells who,
what, where, when, why, and how right at the beginning of the release so
that the most important news remains intact if an editor cuts the release
from the bottom up.
177
Chapter 10: Getting the Word Out with Public Relations

6. Quotes: Include brief quotes from executives, industry leaders, or other
authorities, along with complete attribution.
7. Boilerplate closing: End your release with a one-paragraph summary of
your company’s mission and background, including facts about the size
and purpose of your company and your brand promise.
To distribute hard-copy news releases, use one of these approaches:
 Handle the task on your own by mailing, faxing, or delivering releases to
your target media contact list.
 Contract with a public relations professional or public relations agency
to write and distribute your news releases.
 Use a news distribution service such as PR Newswire (www.prnews
wire.com) or Business Wire (www.businesswire.com) to achieve
simultaneous distribution of important news to national, international,
or business media. (For examples of e-mail news distribution services,
visit www.ereleases.com, www.prweb.com, and www.internet
newsbureau.com.)
E-mail news releases
Increasingly, journalists prefer to receive news via e-mail. Before assuming
that your news is welcomed by online delivery, however, do the following:
1. Confirm with your target media outlet or editorial contact that your
release will be accepted if it’s transmitted via e-mail.
2. Obtain the correct e-mail address.
3. Ask whether to send the release as an e-mail message or e-mail 
attachment.
Staff at most media outlets don’t open unsolicited attachments, so don’t
send your release as an attachment unless you’re specifically told to do so.
When preparing releases for transmission via e-mail, follow this format:
1. E-mail address: Send the e-mail directly to your editorial contact.
2. Subject line: In the subject line, enter a benefit-oriented headline in 50
or fewer characters.
3. Message: In the message portion of your e-mail, pull the elements of
your news release together in this order:
1. State when the news can be released, usually using the words “For
Immediate Release” or, if necessary, by announcing when the news
can be released, using a line such as, “Embargo until 12:01 am,
January 15, 2007.”
178
Part III: Launching Your New Brand 

2. Double-space and type the release dateline (the city name and
state abbreviation where the news originates), followed by the
date of the release.
3. Type a dash followed by the body of the news release (single-
spaced except between paragraphs). Limit the release to about
500 words.
4. Share information on how to obtain additional information (for
example, “To schedule interviews . . .” or, “To obtain photos and
artwork . . .”).
5. Close with boilerplate information, just as in a hard-copy release
(see the preceding section).
6. Add the contact person’s name, phone number, and e-mail address;
and the company name, contact information, and Web site
address.
When e-mailing releases, use plain text rather than HTML or other markup
language. Prepare a traditional hard-copy version of the release as well to
enclose in media kits, to post within your company, to distribute to clients
and key contacts, and to provide as follow-up information to editors.
Audio and video news releases
News releases in audio, video, and multimedia formats present prepackaged
news stories to broadcast outlets.
 Video new releases (VNR) either package news in the same style as that
used in television news reporting or provide video footage for use by
broadcast outlets when producing news segments.
 Audio news releases (ANR) usually take the form of 60-second news sto-
ries tailored for use by radio stations and networks.
 Webcasts allow marketers to present portions of offline events — such
as major presentations or announcements — to online audiences.
Audio and video releases require a high level of production capability.

News release artwork
Today’s publications put heavy emphasis on photos and illustrations, so pub-
lishers count on those seeking publicity to submit good images to accom-
pany the stories they propose. The better the artwork and photography you
submit, the better the chance that you receive publicity. To improve your
chances of getting a news release with artwork published, follow these tips:
179
Chapter 10: Getting the Word Out with Public Relations

 When hand delivering or mailing artwork, provide photo prints in a
minimum size of 5-x-7 inches, or provide slides, transparencies, or com-
puter files that meet the size, resolution, format, and quality required by
the media outlet. Specifications vary widely, so always inquire with your
editorial source before submitting anything. When providing hard-copy
illustrations, submit first-generation reproductions on bright white paper.
 When submitting artwork digitally, follow these guidelines:
• Submit artwork in at least the size you hope it will run or in the
size requested by the media outlet.
• Prepare your artwork in an acceptable format and with ade-
quate digital resolution. JPEG files are nearly universally
accepted, and most publications can use your material if it arrives
with a resolution of 250 to 300 PPI (pixels per inch). To be safe, ask
before sending.
• Transmit your image in RGB (red green blue) color format. This
is the default setting in most photo software and the most common
on-screen viewing mode.
• When sending digital photos, rename photo files from the
default name given by the camera. Bring the image up on your
computer monitor and use the “rename file” function to label the
photo with a name that identifies the photo or provides a short
caption.
 When selecting and submitting artwork, provide only high-quality
images and professionally produced graphics, each accompanied by a
caption or cutline. The caption titles the photo; the cutline describes the
image in detail. When writing your cutline, include the names of all iden-
tifiable people (from left to right), information about the photo, and the
name of the photographer and photo credit request, if any.
Always obtain permission before submitting artwork as an e-mail attachment
because most media outlets don’t open unsolicited or unexpected attachments.
Creating a media kit
Beyond providing a news release and artwork, many marketers provide edi-
tors and reporters with a media kit in the form of a folder full of background
information that helps inform writers about the business and the brand so
that they can produce better stories. When preparing a media kit for your
brand launch, include the following elements:
180
Part III: Launching Your New Brand 

 Your brand story
 Your company history
 Fact sheets about your products or services and the markets you serve
 High-quality artwork of your new brand identity
 Prototypes of how your brand will be applied over the coming weeks
and months
 A company brochure (unless your brochure is a sales piece that con-
tains little or no background information)
 Your most recent annual report or a one-page summary of financial facts
 Contact information including names, phone numbers, and e-mail
addresses of those who can be reached for additional information
Building an online pressroom
Journalists increasingly turn to online pressrooms to find company contacts,
check facts, obtain information, or download images, so before launching
your brand, consider adding a pressroom to your Web site. An online press-
room should contain all the information that’s in your media kit along with
the following additional background and resource materials:
 Company history, product information, and market information
 Executive profiles
 Financial information
 Current and recent news releases
 Recent media coverage as well as a searchable archive of past news 
stories
 Downloadable photos and graphics
 Scheduled events worthy of media coverage
 Background information, including annual reports, research reports,
transcripts of major speeches or presentations, and copies of white
papers (papers that state your organization’s position or philosophy on
topics of importance to your business arena in language that most read-
ers can understand).
 Links to useful Web sites
 Contact information for media spokespeople
181
Chapter 10: Getting the Word Out with Public Relations

Extra! Extra! Making News
To turn your brand launch into a newsworthy story that earns publicity expo-
sure, include in your announcement information that’s relevant, timely, inter-
esting, and useful to media audiences.
Each brand launch situation differs, but the following examples may spur
ideas:
 A new company that aspires to become a regional economic force
announces its brand by bringing in an industry leader to share perspec-
tives on the industry and to describe how the new brand will play an
important role.
 A nonprofit organization announcing a major brand revitalization invites
the governor or a key state cabinet member to help unveil the brand and
discuss how the organization’s new direction supports important
statewide agendas.
 An entrepreneur announces a new brand in tandem with the announce-
ment of partnership agreements with several key distributors, thereby
increasing the financial impact of the company’s announcement.
 A developer unveils the brand for a new environmentally sensitive resi-
dential development along with the announcement that a percentage of
all development profits are dedicated to a regional clean-air fund.
Make your brand announcement newsworthy by including information of
genuine news value. The opposite of newsworthy information is information
that belongs in sales pitches. The minute your “news” becomes promotional,
it’s labeled as hype and trashed accordingly.
182
Part III: Launching Your New Brand 
Good deeds make good news
Here’s an easy-to-remember definition of public
relations: Doing the right thing and then talking
about it.
As you work to generate public interest and
media coverage for your brand, one surefire
way to gain positive attention is to participate in
community or humanitarian efforts that better
your world and the world of those you’re seek-
ing to reach with your brand message.
Consider the headline-making actions of
Starbucks. In 2006, the company leveraged its
commitment to community, education, and liter-
acy programs by producing and publicizing the
movie Akeelah and the Bee, which carried the
tagline, “Change the world one word at a time.”
Your own efforts are likely to be much smaller in
scale, but by building ties to your target markets
by joining groups; serving on boards; heading up
charitable campaigns; and donating time, prod-
ucts, services, or funds to worthwhile causes,
you reap the benefit of personal satisfaction
while generating news about your altruism.

Staging news conferences
News conferences are far more popular among those seeking publicity than
they are among those covering, writing, and producing news. More and more
often, journalists shun ribbon cuttings, groundbreakings, and announcements
that can just as easily be explained in a news release or phone conversation.
Before you plan a brand launch news conference, consider this advice:
 Stage a news conference if your launch includes important news that
should be announced simultaneously to all media outlets.
 Stage a news conference if you’re presenting an important speaker or
celebrity.
 Stage a news conference if your launch includes displays and presenta-
tions that require personal attendance.
If you decide to schedule a news conference, hold it at a time and place con-
venient to most journalists, start it on time, hold speakers to short time slots,
minimize speeches in favor of demonstrations, and have media kits and
releases ready for attendees (and ready to be delivered to media outlets not
in attendance).
You’re on! Shining in media interviews
The whole point of publicity generation efforts is to win the attention of a
reporter or news editor. When the request for more information or a media
interview comes, don’t fumble the call. Prepare yourself for the next step by
following these dos and don’ts:
 In advance of media calls, do know the main points you want to convey
in every brand launch interview. (Turn to Chapter 9 to develop your
brand launch introduction message if you haven’t yet done so.)
 When a media request arrives, do confirm the name of the publication or
station, the editorial contact, and the deadline.
 During interviews, do begin by asking how much time the reporter has
or the length of the broadcast segment, and keep the interview within
that timeframe.
 Do make your most important points as early in the interview as possi-
ble and again later in the interview as appropriate.
 Do keep your comments short so that they make good quotes. In broad-
cast interviews, aim for 20-second sound bites.
 Do keep your comments positive and nonpromotional.
183
Chapter 10: Getting the Word Out with Public Relations

 Do provide a media kit with reproduction-quality copies of your new
brand identity and prototypes of logo usage applications.
 Do follow up with your thanks. Follow up within days of the interview, at
which time you can offer to provide any additional information that will
help the reporter compile the story. Then follow up again right after the
story runs or airs, thanking the reporter or editor for the coverage and
offering to remain available for any future questions or story ideas.
 Don’t answer questions if you aren’t sure of the answer. Instead, arrange
to put the reporter in touch with a more qualified person on the topic.
 Don’t speak poorly of the competition or argue with the reporter.
 Don’t try to fill silences with extraneous information that may misdirect
the angle of the story.
 Don’t ask that comments be off the record. You’re better off simply not
saying anything you don’t want to see in print or hear on air.
There’s No Such Thing as Bad Publicity,
Right? Wrong!
Sorry, but sometimes publicity gives a company a black eye. Bad publicity
can be the result of bad luck, bad timing, a bad product or service, or a bad
mistake made in the process of a media interview, customer encounter, or
marketplace mishap.
Chapter 19 tackles the topic of what to do if you run into trouble, but to stay
out of trouble in the first place, follow these tips:
 Before meeting with media, be clear about your brand promise and
brand character, and stay true to your brand at all times. Even if the
story you’re advancing has nothing to do with your brand message,
when people read or hear your news, it contributes to the way they
experience your brand. If the tone, message, or character you advance is
inconsistent with what people expect from your brand, then the resulting
publicity is far more harmful than helpful to your company and brand.
 Watch your words. Don’t get flip, don’t go off-message or ad-lib, don’t
try to be funny, and never disparage others. If you attack someone else,
the least that can happen is that you erode your brand image. The most
that can happen is that you face a libel suit if an untrue statement ends
up in print or a slander suit if an untrue statement ends up on air.

rands need awareness like plants need water. If people don’t know
about your brand, or if they don’t have a clear idea about what your
brand is and stands for, it will never take root in their minds, which is where
brands live and thrive.
Advertising is a primary tool for developing brand awareness for the simple
reason that it allows you to tell your story in exactly the terms you want,
when you want, and where you want. Unlike publicity-generation efforts (see
Chapter 10), which, at best, result in delivery of your message some of the
time, advertising is a surefire means to carry your brand message into target
market homes, offices, cars, and mailboxes.
Good advertising grabs attention, heightens interest, creates emotional con-
nection, and etches a positive brand image in your target prospect’s mind.
Good advertising is an investment that pays off by building awareness and, as
a result, equity for your brand.
This chapter helps you plan, create, produce, and place advertising that con-
veys your message, inspires your market, and builds a clear, compelling
image for your brand in the minds of your target prospects. We also help
you develop the full range of marketing materials that complement your
advertising — from sales materials to product packages — so that your ads
are part of an integrated marketing program that conveys a single, strong
brand image in your marketplace.

Getting Singular with One Brand
Message and Tone
When you hear marketers talk about integrated marketing communications,
they’re talking about communications that project a single focused tone and
message across all communication channels, whether transmitted via per-
sonal presentations, promotions, advertising, direct mail, online marketing,
or public relations.
The power of consistency for you 
and your brand
Great brand marketers all recite the same mantra: Consistency builds brands.
When you deliver the same look, message, and promise across all media
channels, in all forms of marketing communication, and through every
encounter with consumers, you develop an integrated marketing campaign
that conveys one strong, clear image and builds one strong, clear brand.
Brands benefit from integrated marketing communications for a number of
reasons, including the following:
 Customers gain confidence in brands that convey consistent market-
ing messages. If your communications sound or look buttoned-down
and professional one day and whimsical or playful the next, customers
don’t know what to believe and trust about your business. As a result,
they’re likely to turn to a more reliable product source instead.
 Customers count on the tone conveyed in ads and marketing materials
to be the voice of the business and brand. If your business presents
one personality in business magazines, another personality in broadcast
ads, and yet a third personality online, you confuse customers at the
least and cause them to think that your business is inconsistent and
unreliable at the worst.
How to present a consistent brand image
To build a consistent brand image, present a consistent tone and the same
core marketing message in all communications, regardless of the objective
or call to action each communication aims to achieve.
186
Part III: Launching Your New Brand 

 Your core marketing message communicates your brand promise to
help customers make or save money; improve effectiveness and effi-
ciency; enhance safety, security, or success; or enjoy other valuable 
benefits. Before settling on your core marketing message, be sure the
promise you convey is one you can keep and one that will be reinforced
every time a customer encounters your business. For help putting your
message to the test, check out Chapter 9.
 The tone of your marketing communications conveys your brand per-
sonality and character. Be sure that the tone you project is compatible
with your business’s offering and your customers’ expectations. For
instance, the operators of a preschool may adopt a tone that’s caring
and playful, two attributes parents seek when choosing a day setting for
their children, rather than clinical or professional, qualities people
expect from a hospital or bank.
As you put your core marketing message and brand tone into writing, consider
this format:
1. State your brand claim.
State the claim you’ll make, directly or indirectly, in all communications.
For example, “Our brand provides the best solution for ecologically
sound, affordable landscape solutions in the Pacific Northwest.”
2. Provide proof.
State how you’ll back your claim. For example, “We’ll prove our claim by
presenting before and after examples in our communications as well as
on our Web site, where homeowners can complete a do-it-yourself cost
estimate and environmental savings form.”
3. Determine the communication tone that you’ll incorporate into all
your marketing efforts.
This statement is used internally to guide the personality presented in
your marketing communications. For example, “The tone of our commu-
nications is friendly and confident. We want to sound expert but not
uppity; casual but not complacent. We want our customers to know
through our communications that we’re the kind of people they’d like to
visit with in their own backyards and that they can count on us for
expert, efficient, earth-sensitive landscape service delivery.”
A Clear Purpose: Don’t Get Creative 
without One!
Whether you’re producing an ad, a trade show display, a brochure, a sales
presentation, or any other brand communication, the first step is always the
187
Chapter 11: Advertising and Promoting Your Brand

same. You have to start by defining the purpose of your communication so
that your job starts and stays on task. Use the following communication plan-
ning questions to guide your thinking:
 Who is your target audience?
In a sentence or two, describe the audience you’re aiming to reach with
this marketing effort in terms of where they can be reached, who they
are in factual terms, and how and why they buy products like the one
you’re offering.
 What does your target audience currently know or think about your
brand, product, or service?
Define the current mindset before working to achieve change. Does your
audience lack knowledge about you, in which case your communication
needs to establish awareness? Does your audience hold positive percep-
tions that you want to reinforce? Does your audience hold inaccurate
perceptions that you want to change?
 What do you want your target audience to think — and do?
Define the outcome you want this marketing effort to achieve. Do you
want prospects to call for an appointment, ask for a free estimate, visit 
a Web site for an online demonstration, attend an event or promotion,
make a first-time trial purchase, or simply increase awareness?
 Why should prospects believe you and take the recommended action?
Summarize the unique benefits that your customers can count on and
the reason they should act now.
 What mandatory information do you need to convey in this 
communication?
List the things that absolutely must be addressed in the creation of this
communication, including brand tone, core marketing message, and
graphic standards that ensure the proper presentation of your brand.
 How will you measure success?
State your desired outcome so that the communication can be designed
to accomplish its aim. For example, if you want phone calls or Web site
visits, give people a reason and clear instructions for reaching you by
phone or online. If you want to schedule a meeting, give the prospect a
compelling reason to want to see you and an easy way to make the
appointment. If you want heightened awareness, establish a precommu-
nication benchmark against which you can measure changes in attitude.
 What is your timeline and budget?
To produce your communication on time and on budget, set a timeline
and a budget in advance. If you don’t, the date will slide and costs will
mount.
188
Part III: Launching Your New Brand 

Gaining Awareness and 
Getting Some Action
Advertising is how businesses, organizations, and individuals inform and 
persuade prospects and customers through paid announcements in mass
media outlets such as newspapers, magazines, television and radio stations,
outdoor boards, Web sites, and other media vehicles.
Most ads fall into one of two categories:
 When an ad’s purpose is to build awareness and interest, it’s consid-
ered an image ad, which is also called a brand ad or an institutional ad.
 When an ad’s purpose is to present an offer and prompt a consumer
response, it’s considered a product ad, which is also called a promotional
ad or a call-to-action ad.
The world’s largest brand marketers run big, beautiful, image-building brand
ads with no call to action whatsoever. At the other end of the spectrum, the
smallest brand marketers run highly promotional call-to-action ads for the
simple reason that they need every ad to pull its own weight by delivering
measurable results in the form of inquiries, business visits, or sales.
To build your brand and gain responses, take a middle road by creating ads
that build brand awareness and interest while calling for a specific action. To
create ads that build your brand while prompting a measurable consumer
action or attitude change, follow these steps:
1. Develop your brand’s core marketing message and brand tone.
The section “Getting Singular with One Brand Message and Tone” earlier
in this chapter can help with this step. Make sure that every ad or other
form of communication, regardless of its call to action, conveys your
brand message and tone so that your organization consistently projects
a unified brand image that consumers begin to recognize and trust.
2. For each ad, direct mailer, newsletter, news release, or other commu-
nication, answer communication planning questions (see the preced-
ing section) to summarize the unique promotional offer,
announcement, or sales message you want to convey.
3. Insist that all marketing communications that leave your organization
meet the objectives established for the particular piece while also
advancing your brand’s core marketing message, tone, and image.
189
Chapter 11: Advertising and Promoting Your Brand

Making an Ad Schedule
Advertising pays its freight when it reaches the people you’re aiming to influ-
ence with enough frequency to change their perceptions and actions.
The first step toward getting your ad dollars’ worth is choosing the right
media vehicles. The second step is setting the right ad schedule. The follow-
ing sections help as you decide which media to use and how to put your ad
schedule through the planning hurdles.
Matching media vehicles to your 
communication needs
Good media schedules include ads placed with media outlets that get your
message in front of exactly the audiences you want to reach. For example:
 If the objective of your advertising is to reach and influence your
prospects and customers, place ads in media with audiences that match
your customer profile (turn to Chapter 5 and complete the Customer
Profile Worksheet if you’re not sure how to define your customer).
For example, if you’re branding a private golf club and you know your
prospect pool is comprised of affluent golfers, you probably want to
place ads in sports sections of newspapers, on golf tournament broad-
casts, or in golfing magazines.
 If the objective of your advertising is to reach and influence those who
influence the success of your brand — through their investments, refer-
rals, or for any other reason — create a definition of the kind of person
you’re working to reach and then find media outlets that count people
who match that profile within their audiences.
For example, if you’re branding a senior citizen assisted-living housing
community, you may decide that your success depends upon referrals
and recommendations from the attorneys, physicians, and adult chil-
dren of your prospects. Therefore, in addition to advertising in publica-
tions that reach adults 75 and older, you also want to announce open
houses and offer information packets in media outlets that reach physi-
cians, attorneys, and middle-aged adults in your market area.
You need to know the definition of your target market before you can select the
right media outlet for your ad. In most cases, a number of outlets fill the bill in
terms of reaching your audience. When that’s the case, you can make media
selections based on which outlets best reach your market within the cost and
timing realities you face. See the sidebar “The media menu” for a quick look the
costs, placement considerations, and advantages of various media outlets.

Balancing advertising reach and frequency
Media schedules balance two objectives:
 Reach: The size of the audience that will be exposed to your ad. Print
media outlets use subscriber or circulation figures to describe their
reach, whereas broadcast outlets base their reach on the number of
people who see or hear an ad.
 Frequency: The number of times the average person is exposed to an ad
message over a specified time period of usually one month or less.
Most marketers agree that reach creates broad awareness whereas frequency
creates recognition, understanding, and responses.
Betting on frequency over reach
Unless your entire objective is to gain widespread awareness, plan your media
schedule to limit your reach and to increase your frequency by concentrating
ad buys in media that reach a highly targeted audience on a frequent basis.
The opposite of frequency is to try to create a big splash with a showy, one-
shot ad — perhaps a full-page ad in newspapers or magazines or a bazillion-
dollar airing on a high-ticket television broadcast like the Super Bowl. The
problem is that even high-impact ad buys miss a portion of the target audi-
ence. Some readers or viewers aren’t available when your ad runs or airs, and
if you’ve placed all your bets on a one-time schedule, you don’t have the
chance to reach them again.
When planning your schedule, factor in these advertising realities:
 Most media planners say that you need to place your ad nine times to
reach your target prospect once for the simple reason that, at any given
time, a portion of the potential audience is tuned out, distracted, or just
not in the mood or mindset to hear what you’re saying.
 Media schedulers also factor in the fact that you need to reach a
prospect as many as three times to achieve attention, interest, desire,
and action.
 Most ads need to run or air up to 27 times to do the job you want them
to do.
There are exceptions, of course. If your ad runs or airs via a publication
or program that reaches a highly devoted audience that reads or tunes
in almost without fail, you can get away with a schedule that runs your
ad fewer times. Be aware, though, that the budget requirement is about
the same either way because media outlets charge a premium for ad
buys that reach highly targeted and devoted audiences.
192
Part III: Launching Your New Brand 

Stretching dollars by concentrating on fewer media outlets
To gain frequency within your target market without breaking the bank, limit
your media schedule to a few media outlets.
For example, instead of running your ad one time each in six magazines, run
it three times in the two that best reach your audience. Or rather than run-
ning a light newspaper schedule and a light radio schedule, choose one or
the other and run a heavy schedule that achieves the kind of frequency that
changes minds and moves markets.
By concentrating your schedule, you gain a number of advantages.
 You take advantage of discounted rates offered by media to high-volume
advertisers.
 You save on production costs by creating ads for fewer media outlets.
 You increase visibility in your selected outlets, contributing to a percep-
tion of brand strength and clout in the minds of the readers or viewers.
 You reach the audiences of your selected outlets on a more frequent
basis than would be possible if you were to divide your budget among a
longer list of media outlets.
Scheduling your ads
Few advertisers run heavy, continual ad schedules week-in and week-out,
52 weeks a year. Instead, most advertisers vary their ad presence by follow-
ing one of the scheduling plans shown in Figure 11-1.

Chapter 11: Advertising and Promoting Your Brand

The types of schedule patterns are
 Continual schedules, which run week-in and week-out for as long as the
marketer advertises. They’re used to maintain ongoing awareness. Some
continual ad schedules involve ongoing placement of big, splashy ads;
for example, an ad may appear on the back cover of every issue of a
magazine. However, many continual ad schedules are more economical,
involving placement of small-space ads that run on a continuous basis in
magazines or local newspapers.
 Flighting schedules, which run ads in bursts. They usually start with a
heavy ad buy that makes a strong enough market impression to carry
the brand through a dormant ad period. After the dormant period, the
marketer comes back in with a light ad schedule to renew awareness,
followed by another dormant period and then by a heavy schedule that
typically coincides with a buying season or marketing opportunity.
 Front-loading schedules, which begin with a heavy ad schedule. They
aim to saturate the market with impressions before pulling back to a
more economical, maintenance-level schedule that sustains the aware-
ness and interest generated during the schedule launch. Front-loading
schedules are a good choice for announcing new brands or business
openings, promoting new products, or revitalizing lagging sales.
 Heavy-up schedules, which are similar to front-loading schedules except
that they involve several saturation ad periods, also known as ad blitzes.
They’re used to create and keep a high level of market awareness by
alternating intense ad schedules with low-level continual schedules in
between.
 Pulsing schedules, which run ads on an on-and-off basis. On a sustaining
basis, the marketer runs a moderate schedule, goes dormant, runs
another moderate schedule, and then goes dormant again. Pulsing
schedules are rarely used for launches or to rev up interest, but rather
they’re used to maintain awareness after it’s established.
Creating Ads That Work
Ad creation is where marketing gets fun, so you may be tempted to hurry up
and get to this part. Resist this temptation and do something with less flair
and more function before you turn on your creative juices.
Start by taking time to figure out what you want your ad to accomplish. Go
beyond a vague idea, like “We want to introduce our brand.” Instead, get spe-
cific with instructions such as, “We want to announce our new brand to our
40-something, predominantly male, regionally based audience with an ad that
194
Part III: Launching Your New Brand 

conveys our brand promise to offer the best private golf experience in the
state while extending an invitation to take a club tour and apply for a limited
number of memberships.”
In other words, get specific about what you want your ad to accomplish and
then get creative with each type of ad you create.
Print ads
In great print ads, the headline, copy, and design work together to grab atten-
tion, inspire interest, promote a brand promise, prompt the desired action,
and advance the brand image. That’s a lot, but it’s not too much to ask. In
fact, it’s what you need to demand out of every ad you place in a newspaper
or magazine.
To achieve success, each print ad must include three powerful components:
 Headline: Your headline is the equivalent of the ad’s stop-em-in-their-
tracks introductory statement. Four out of every five print ad readers
read only the headline, so it had better be capable of targeting the right
prospects, grabbing attention, and making people want to read the rest
of your story.
You may notice ads without headlines, but take a second look and you
either see an amazing photo or illustration that speaks louder than
words or a headless wonder that most people look right past. Unless
you can afford an amazing graphic element that you’re sure has stopping
power, use a headline every time.
 Copy: Good copy (which is just a term for the text of your ad) talks
directly to the reader, conveying information that tells the reader the
benefits of your offering, the promise of your brand, and what to do next
to obtain information, take advantage of an offer, or make a purchase.
 Design: Design is the way your ad looks — how it uses type, art, open
space, borders, and placement of elements to create a look that both
allows a reader’s eyes to move easily through the message and promi-
nently presents the brand identity of the advertiser.
Punching up headline power
Headlines can be long or short. They can sit at the top, in the middle, or at
the bottom of the ad. They can feature a single word, a phrase, a sentence, or
a question. When it comes to headlines, it isn’t the form that matters. It’s the
function. See the dos and don’ts in Table 11-1 for headline advice to follow
and traps to avoid.

Convincing copy
Big, beautiful image ads sometimes contain no copy at all. They rely entirely
on the strength of the brand name and logo, along with a captivating photo or
other image, to advance the brand and expand market awareness, credibility,
and loyalty.
Most advertisers need their ads to ignite action, though, and for that reason,
most ads count on copy to play a pretty important role. If you expect your ad
to generate consumer response — in the form of changed opinions, enhanced
196
Part III: Launching Your New Brand 

interest, requests for more information, pre-purchase inquiries about price or
options, business visits, or other actions that move consumers toward a
buying decision — make sure the text of your ad is up to the task.
When writing copy (or when reviewing copy written by ad professionals),
keep these points in mind:
 Be sure the first sentence is capable of capturing interest and enticing
the reader to want to know more.
 Be sure the second sentence lures the reader into the third sentence,
with each additional sentence advancing your brand promise and
building more credibility and trust.
 Include an invitation to take action. If you want your ad to deliver
results, include a call to action in the form of an invitation or a promo-
tional offer.
 Inspire action with an incentive. Most new brands want to prompt 
positive changes in consumer opinions or activity. They want to per-
suade prospects to request more information, view demonstrations, 
ask for cost estimates, sample the product, or in some other way move
toward the buying decision — the sooner the better. Stimulate action by
extending limited-time special buying terms, promotional pricing, trial
offers, guarantees, or other offers that lower the risk or heighten the
ease of taking the desired action.
 Call for action. Don’t assume that readers know where to find you, how
to reach you, or whether or not you have a Web site, give free estimates,
or welcome drop-in business. If you want your ad to generate responses,
make responding easy (“Call us toll-free,” “Go online to request a free
estimate,” “Visit our business seven days a week,” and so on). Then tell
them exactly how to proceed by providing your phone number, direc-
tions to your place of business, your Web address, and any other infor-
mation that makes responding to your ad message easy.
Designing for impact
Professional graphic artists and art directors earn their fees for many rea-
sons, but high on the list is the simplicity of their designs. Flip through the
pages of any newspaper or magazine to see the ads that benefit from great
design. They’re the ones with the fewest elements, the most striking visuals,
and the cleanest and most attention-grabbing looks.
If you’re investing a significant amount of money in ad buys, seriously con-
sider investing in the creation of professionally designed ads. The section
“Hiring professional creative help” later in this chapter guides you through
selecting the right resources.
197
Chapter 11: Advertising and Promoting Your Brand

As you create or review ad designs, consider this advice:
 Use art. Many readers flip through publications at rapid-fire speed, stop-
ping only when a headline or visual grabs their attention. To increase
your chance of grabbing interest, include a photograph or an illustration
(a drawing, cartoon, or other art) in your ad.
In some ads, the art shows the product being advertised. In other cases,
it shows the product in use or represents the benefits the product deliv-
ers. In yet other cases, the art relies on what’s called borrowed interest by
featuring a photo or illustration that indirectly relates to the ad message.
For example, a company featuring Tuscan vacations may feature a photo
of Florence (the product), it may show a photo of people sitting near a
villa overlooking a Chianti landscape (the product in use), or it may fea-
ture an illustration of wine glasses or grape vines (borrowed interest).
 Keep it simple. Print media is a cluttered environment packed full of
news articles, feature stories, facts and figures, and ads large and small.
On a crowded page, the clean, open ad is the one that wins attention for
the simple reason that it gives the reader’s eyes a place to find a
moment’s refuge from the visual overwhelm. Streamline your ad design
by following these tips:
• Frame your ad with unfilled space. Rather than letting your copy
or design elements run right up to the edge of your ad space
(where they run into the adjacent ad or news story), design your
ad so that it isolates itself with white space or a black border.
• Eliminate unnecessary elements. When readers view an ad, their
eyes sweep across it, usually from upper left to lower right; in a
matter of only moments, they note the message, the advertiser
logo, and whether they want to pause for a second or move on to
the next item on the page. If your ad lacks a clear focal point or fails
to convey a message at a glance, it doesn’t get a second chance.
Help readers grab your message by eliminating all visual distrac-
tions. Ads that win awards for their effectiveness are almost always
examples of design restraint as opposed to design overload.
 Size your ad to match your message. If you’re promoting a $1.99 offer,
an attention-getting, small-space ad may work just fine. But if you’re
launching a new brand and you want to say, in essence, “Hello, world.
We’re going to be a big deal, and here’s why,” make the size of your ad
reflect the size of your message. If you have budget restrictions, con-
sider these ideas:
• Rather than run a large ad one time only, create the largest-sized
ad that you can afford to run multiple times. Opt for frequency
over size.
198
Part III: Launching Your New Brand 

• Even with a partial-page ad, aim to dominate the page by choosing
an attention-getting ad shape. Some publications allow you to run
wide, shallow ads that span the entire width of the page or long,
narrow ads that run the full length of the page, giving the feeling of
a large ad when, in fact, the ad covers as little as a fifth of the page.
 Consistently advance a single ad look and tone for your brand. Rather
than design a new and different ad every time you promote your brand,
leverage the impact of your advertising by creating an ad look for your
brand and using it consistently every time you advertise. For example,
use the same typestyle in all headlines, the same border design, the
same style of illustrations, and the same placement of your logo. To
establish your guidelines, see Chapter 18.
Broadcast ads
In the same way that print advertisers need to establish a brand look to
advance in all ads, broadcast advertisers need to establish a brand sound
that consumers can immediately hear and relate to the brand’s name. To
establish a brand sound
 Consider using the same announcer in all broadcast ads.
 Establish a broadcast ad style, such as ads consisting of a dialogue
between two people, ads that feature testimonials, or ads that consis-
tently convey the same kind of message.
 Use music or sound effects consistently so that people can recognize
your ad and identify your brand by sound alone.
 Seriously consider hiring professional broadcast resources for every-
thing from ad concept development to studio production to talent.
Especially if your brand is competing with big-budget brands, or if your
ads will run alongside the ads of major brand advertisers, a professionally
produced ad makes you look like able competition; a do-it-yourself ad
may well flag your brand — in a few quick seconds — as an also-ran.
Hiring professional creative help
When you’re creating a long-lasting marketing piece or ad campaign that
involves a major media budget, think seriously about bringing in some pros to
help you do the job right. The difference between the look of professionally
produced materials and those created in-house by using desktop publishing is
199
Chapter 11: Advertising and Promoting Your Brand

usually immediately apparent. The budget is higher on the professionally pro-
duced piece, but so is the visual impression. As you produce marketing mate-
rials, turn to one of the following resources:
 In-house talent, providing that you have qualified people who won’t 
be sidetracked from other responsibilities to create your marketing
materials.
 Free or almost-free resources, which are available through media out-
lets and marketing suppliers such as printers, sign makers, and publish-
ers. If you’re simply updating existing materials to drop in a new logo or
tagline, free is a great price. But beware: If you want a unique, creative
idea or ad look, turn to professionals who can devote the time and talent
necessary to do the job, at a price.
 Marketing professionals, who can include freelance professionals,
design or production studios, full-scale agencies, and brand consultants.
When considering working with marketing professionals, be sure to do
the following:
• Clarify your needs. If you’re seeking one-time assistance, a free-
lancer may work fine. If you want to acquire a long-term image
development partner, an agency relationship is a better choice.
• Set your priorities. If, above all else, you want cutting-edge cre-
ative ideas, find an agency that reels in creative awards. If your
emphasis is online marketing, head toward a group with proven
online experience. If you want help from someone with intimate
knowledge of your industry or market sector, or someone with gov-
ernment, business, or even social connections, know that priority
before you start interviewing potential resources.
• Define your budget, and share the financial facts with your top-
choice professionals. If your budget doesn’t fit with the profes-
sional’s client profile, better to know sooner than later.
When you identify the professionals that fit your needs, make your decision
by following these steps:
1. Decide how many professional groups you want to interview.
If your project is simple or your budget is spare, start with one top-
choice supplier and save yourself and the professionals the drill of
a competition that will only eat up the time and money you have for
the task.
2. If you plan to interview multiple groups, follow this process so that
you compare apples to apples:
200
Part III: Launching Your New Brand 

1. Share your needs, priorities, budget, and timeline with each
firm’s CEO, and determine the firm’s interest.
2. Schedule appointments to find out each firm’s capabilities and
match them with your needs.
3. Review each agency’s capabilities and presentations, and then
make your selection.
4. Get the client-agency agreement in writing.
A contract should clarify the services to be provided, the compen-
sation arrangement, the term of the arrangement, how the contract
can be terminated, and who will own materials upon payment.
Ideally, you want all materials to become property of your com-
pany upon payment, but don’t make assumptions. Confirm the
arrangement, and see that the ownership details are part of the
contract you sign.
Measuring Your Ad’s Effectiveness
Each time you launch an ad effort, know what you want to accomplish so that
you can evaluate whether or not your effort achieves its aim. Chapter 3 con-
tains information on creating your brand’s “to-do list,” including information
that helps you prioritize the objectives of your brand launch effort. Table 11-2
offers examples for measuring how your marketing accomplishes its task.

Packaging Your Product 
to Convey Your Brand
Product packages are a combination of form and function.
 The form of your package involves design, shape, and a look that cap-
tures consumer attention and conveys and reinforces your brand image
and promise.
 The function of your package involves usability. In addition to looking
good on a shelf, your packaging has to work. It has to be easy to pick up,
read, study, use, and carry away.
Even if you don’t have a consumer product, you still package your offering,
perhaps in a shopping bag, a folder or envelope containing a cost estimate or
proposal, or a take-home bag for diners to carry home leftovers.
Regardless of the form your packaging takes, make sure that it accurately
reflects the promise and tone of your brand and that it makes an appropri-
ately strong and consistent impression for your business. Chapter 17
includes information on redesigning packaging as part of revitalizing a brand.
202
Part III: Launching Your New Brand 

Staging Promotions to Build Business
and Brand Awareness
Promotions are time-sensitive, attention-generating events that aim to alter
customer perception or behavior. Some promotions work to increase pur-
chases from existing customers, some work to attract new customers, some
promote new buying patterns, and some work to build business during other-
wise slow periods. Most offer price incentives, trial offers, coupons, or
rebates.
To advance your brand, be sure that any promotion you stage matches well
with your brand character and promise. For example, if yours is the most
exclusive brand in your category, a price promotion is out of character, but a
series of events featuring celebrities or authorities in your field is compatible
with your image.
Also, take care to protect your brand image when entering cross-promotions
that tie your brand to another brand. Chapter 16 includes a section on how
to cross-promote without diluting the value of your own brand.

ncreasingly, the Internet is the primary avenue by which consumers
access, evaluate, and consider products and services. Because of the per-
vasiveness of online searches and online business, organizations large and
small put increasing importance on how their brands look and communicate
on the Internet. Online, branding is essential for two very different reasons.
 If your business relies on the Web as a sales channel, you need to
have a strong brand to pave the way for sales success. Unlike in a
bricks-and-mortar outlet, online customers can’t touch or try your prod-
uct, and no one’s there to personally explain and reinforce your promise.
More than in any other distribution channel, online customers need to
arrive confident in your brand’s quality and promise. If you rely on
online sales, you need your brand to do some pretty significant advance
work so that customers arrive at your site confident and ready to make
purchase decisions.
 If your business relies on the Web to provide information or customer
service, you need to make sure that online encounters are a seamless
extension of your overall brand experience. Whether customers meet
up with your brand online or offline, they should receive an identical
message, tone, look, character, and promise. This consistency leads to a
single, consistently reinforced and positive experience regardless of the
approach to your organization.
Whether the Internet is a sales channel for your business or simply a key com-
munication vehicle, to a huge number of consumers, it represents the most fre-
quently visited approach to your brand. This chapter helps you create an

online experience that meshes perfectly with your total brand experience so
that your brand image and promise is reinforced in a lockstep manner whether
customers encounter you online or offline before, during, or after the sale.
Creating Your Online ID
In the same way that your brand name is the key that unlocks your brand
image in the mind of consumers, your domain name — the string of charac-
ters Web users type into a browser to reach your site, such as www.your
brandsite.com — is the key that unlocks your brand online.
Ideally, your domain name is comprised of your brand name plus .com or
.org, depending on whether your brand represents a commercial business
or a nonprofit organization. When it comes to establishing a domain name,
though, the Internet isn’t an ideal world. For one thing, it’s heavily populated
with millions of Web sites accessed by domain names that tie up most of the
words in the English dictionary. Beyond that, it’s a world where cyber-squatters
camp on attractive unclaimed domain names, registering and tying them up
until someone pays what feels like a ransom to free them for use.
If you haven’t already registered a domain name for your brand, get ready to
jump through some hoops. This section can help you get through relatively
unscathed.
Naming your site
By a mile, making your brand name the centerpiece of your domain name is
the most preferable route to establishing an online identity, and here’s why:
Internet analysts estimate that 15 percent of Web traffic takes the form of
type-in traffic, a term that describes users who bypass search engines and
simply type the name of the company they’re looking for, followed by .com,
in the address bar of the Web browser. By making your brand name the basis
of your domain name, you capture visits from this growing group of experi-
enced Web users. Plus, you reinforce your brand name every time someone
searches for you online.
Turn your brand name into your domain name, if you can
The shortcut to establishing an online identity is to start with a brand name
that’s available for registration as a domain name. By registering both your
brand name and your domain name at the same time, you eliminate the grief
of settling on a brand name that you later discover isn’t available for online
use. Plus, you end up with a single name on your physical establishment and
on your Web site, a vital first step in creating a single, unified identity for
your brand.
206
Part III: Launching Your New Brand 

Avoid a brand name that’s straight out of the dictionary, if you can. Nearly
every entry in the English dictionary is already in use in a registered domain
name and therefore is unavailable for your online use.
If you haven’t already named your brand, preempt a ton of frustration by coin-
ing a brand-new word that can be used as both your brand and domain names.
Chapter 5 is packed with advice on creating brand names, including how to 
fabricate syllables or words into great brand and domain names. Microsoft,
Cingular, Verizon, DreamWorks, and Firefox are just a few prominent examples.
Devising Plan B domain names
If you’re launching a new brand and your top-choice name isn’t available as a
domain name, return to the brainstorming process until you can find or
invent a brand name that you can also use online.
If you’re working with an established brand and the domain name you want
isn’t available, you have to come up with a second-best solution. Try these
approaches:
 Come up with a tagline or slogan that can become a major part of your
brand identity and the basis for your domain name. For example, if
you type in www.wetryharder.com, you’re taken to the Avis Web site.
Type in www.justdoit.com and you land on the Nike site.
 Look into purchasing your top-choice domain name from its current
owner. Be aware that this process can be costly and time-consuming,
but if you plan to build a valuable brand, it’s probably worth the invest-
ment. Many domain name registrars offer assistance with this step; go to
www.internic.net/regist.html for a complete list of registrars.
Following are a few things not to do when you have to go with a Plan B 
brand name:
 If your brand name plus .com is already taken, don’t try to beat the
system by using your brand name followed by .net. Web users instinc-
tively type .com, so when they type that with your brand name, they’ll
go straight to someone else’s site.
 If the name you want isn’t available, don’t try to add hyphens or other
unusual additions to your brand name in order to create a domain name
that you can register. The result will be a name that’s hard to type and
remember.
 If your brand name is too long to make a good domain name, don’t invent
some abbreviation that will be hard to memorize and recall. For example,
the Hawaii Visitors and Convention Bureau can be reached by typing
www.hvcb.com, but they don’t ask consumers to remember the lineup of
initials. Instead, they market the domain name www.gohawaii.com,
which offers not only an easy-to-recall address but also a desirable
remedy to the mid-winter blues.
207
Chapter 12: Sending Your Brand into Cyberspace

Domain name advice
As you plan your domain name, consider the following points:
 Keep your domain name short and easy to remember. Think of the
best-known Web addresses as ideal examples: www.aol.com, www.
ebay.com, www.google.com, www.yahoo.com, www.amazon.com.
Each one is short, memorable, and just about impossible to forget or
misspell.
 Don’t get clever with unique spellings or abbreviations that may make
sense to those within your organization but that bewilder strangers to
your site. For instance, a domain name like www.cookeezncream.com
may be available, but the chances that most users will type it correctly
most of the time are slim.
 Think globally. If your business plan calls for international presence,
register your name with various international codes to specify your
international offices. For example, www.microsoft.com/uk is the
address for information about Microsoft products and services in the
United Kingdom.
Registering your name
When you find an available domain name, register it immediately. Enter
“domain name registrars” in your search engine to find a near-countless
number of registration services, most charging somewhere between $25 and
$75 for a three-year period of domain ownership.
When registering your name, consider this advice:
 The first domain name you need to register is your site name, as in
www.yourbrandname.com.
 If you can, also register your site with the extensions .net, .org,
.info, and .biz. By reserving all possible extensions for your site
name, you can set the address up to redirect users who type in a wrong
extension to your primary address.
 Also consider registering domain names that users may accidentally type
when looking for your Web site. Through a process called URL redirection,
you can make your Web site available under a number of different URLs
or online addresses that are all forwarded to your primary Web address.
For example
• Register your brand tagline as a domain name so Web users who
forget your brand name but remember your slogan can type it in to
reach your site.
208
Part III: Launching Your New Brand 

• Register your brand name with various misspellings. For instance,
if you type www.googel.com, you’re redirected to the www.
google.com Web site. Or if you type www.fordummies.com, you
arrive at the www.dummies.com Web site. Establish a similar
error-capture program in your own domain name strategy by think-
ing of ways that users may mistype or misspell your domain name
and registering each version.
• Register additional domain names as you discover new user-error
tendencies. After your Web site is up and running, regularly check
error logs to see what kinds of mistakes people are making when
trying to reach your site. And ask those who deal with customers to
pass along pronunciation or spelling mistakes that they see or hear
so that you can work the errors into your URL-forwarding strategy.
Creating a multiple domain name strategy costs very little. The registra-
tion fee on each name is nominal, and you can redirect all traffic to the
Web site that carries your primary domain name, incurring no additional
site building or hosting fees.
Building a Site That Reinforces 
Your Brand
If by any slight chance you’re wondering if you need a Web site — or a
stronger Web site than the one you already have — make a list of brand
names you know, and then look online to see if each one has a Web site. We’re
willing to bet that you won’t find a great brand that isn’t backed by a great
site. That’s because in today’s wired world, building a great brand and build-
ing a great site go hand in hand.
Before building or strengthening the Web site for your business and your
brand, give some thought to the kind of people you’ll be serving online, the
kind of information they’ll be seeking, and what you want to achieve through
your online presence. Answer the following questions:
 Who is likely to visit your site? Will your site be visited primarily by
current customers? Or will it be used by job seekers, suppliers, cus-
tomer prospects, or others seeking information about your business?
 How will people use your site? Will people want general information,
such as your location, open hours, and product lines? Will they want
answers to frequently asked questions about your offering? Will they
want to study your organization’s background and experience or find
out more about your products? Will they want the ability to request
209
Chapter 12: Sending Your Brand into Cyberspace

quotes or to study customization options? Will they want to buy online?
Will job seekers want to apply online? By knowing what people will want
from your site, you can design its features and functions accordingly.
 What are your goals for your site? Every site should advance the brand
image. Beyond that, do you want your site to generate leads, capture
online sales, provide customer support, or simply deliver information
about your business? Your answers in this area help you weigh site
development costs against the value you expect your site to deliver.
Settling on the right type of site
Most Web sites fall into one of the following categories:
 Company contact sites: Easy and economical to build and maintain,
these sites are like online business cards, with graphics that advance
brand images while delivering the facts that online users seek about
businesses. Minimally, a contact site provides your business identity
and description, information about your products and services, your
open hours, and how to reach you online and at your physical location.
 Brochure sites: These sites are online cousins to print brochures. This
kind of site needs to advance your brand image while delivering clear
information about your company background, products, and services.
 Support sites: These sites reinforce existing customer relationships by
providing online service and customer communication, including infor-
mation about product usage, installation, troubleshooting, updates, and
news. They’re useful when many customers have similar questions or
service needs that can be addressed online by companies prepared to
respond immediately to user questions.
 E-commerce sites: These are sites designed to sell goods online. They
invite and allow customers to view products, make choices, place
orders, submit payment, and, often, track delivery. Because of the com-
plexity of the functions required, these are the most expensive sites to
build and maintain.
Considering content
Content describes electronically delivered information, including text, photos,
or graphics. As you plan the content for your brand Web site, keep the follow-
ing tips in mind:
 Build your site page-by-page. Don’t think of your site as a single unit
with many pages. Think in modular terms, with an introductory home
page and links to pages that each cover a single topic.
210
Part III: Launching Your New Brand 

 Think of your home page as the welcome mat to your entire site. Just
as you wouldn’t try to tell your whole story on the cover of your
brochure, don’t try to tell your whole story on your home page. Use
your home page to establish your brand image, convey your brand
promise, and invite users to click for specific information. For help
developing your home page, check out the section “Making your home
page your online business lobby” later in this chapter.
 Use keywords to your advantage. Keywords are words or phrases that
people enter into search engines when they’re seeking information or a
particular Web site. As you develop each page on your site, think of the
keywords that describe the content of your page. Then use those words
in the page headline and several times in the page copy so that, when
consumers seek information through keyword searches, your page has a
chance of appearing in the search results.
Keyword searches may send users to internal pages of your site rather
than to your home page, so be sure that every page identifies your
brand and provides an easy link back to your home page.
 Be spare with words and generous with design. Online, people skim
pages, grabbing information from headlines, clicking on easy-to-understand
buttons, and stopping only when they see information that seems to
meet their needs. To catch the attention of these fast-moving page skim-
mers, avoid long blocks of text in favor of quotes, testimonials, head-
lines, graphics, and a design that’s clear, clean, and capable of conveying
your brand image at a glance.
Mapping out easy navigation
Navigation is how users access information on your site. Most sites use 
menu bars and colored or underlined text or icons to help users navigate
Web pages and know where to click to reach the information they want.
On your home page, present clearly labeled selections so that site visitors
know exactly how to proceed to get their questions answered. Look at the
“after” version of the home page in Figure 12-1 as an example. Along the
bottom of the home page, options invite visitors, customers, or employees 
to enter site areas designed specifically for their interests. Along the top of
the site, people can click to reach general information about the company, its
locations, or its services, or they can click to contact the company. Nothing
about the site is ambiguous. People don’t have to translate terms such as
“What people are saying,” or “How you can count on us.” Each label is clear
and easy to understand. Aim for the same clarity when you plan your site’s
home page.
211
Chapter 12: Sending Your Brand into Cyberspace

When you’re putting together the content of pages other than your home
page, follow this advice:
 On each page, provide navigation keys so that users can jump from site
page to site page with ease.
 On each page, provide a link back to your home page.
 Keep navigation choices clear and to a minimum.
Integrating your brand image 
online and offline
When people arrive in your Web space, your site is your business in their
minds. If it’s slow, cluttered, confusing, or unresponsive, visitors will link
those labels to your brand. Likewise, if it’s easy to navigate, if it communi-
cates clearly, and if it responds to user requirements with ease, the reputa-
tion of your brand will soar as a result.
For an example of a site that establishes a strong brand, visit the Web site of
the resort Verana at www.verana.com. Although the resort offers just seven
private guesthouses, its Web site clearly establishes it as a first choice for
discerning travelers. The site’s design mirrors the resort’s brand image as a
“small yet unforgettable retreat comprised of a cluster of secluded bungalows
in a remote and unspoiled location.” Were you to arrive at the resort and ask
how first-time guests made their choice, you’d hear the words “Web site”
repeated like a mantra. The Verana site is both well designed and well pro-
duced. It expresses the brand perfectly, and as a result, the success of Verana
eclipses its larger and longer-standing competitors. With careful design, your
site can and should do the same.
The power of one: Using one look, one message, one tone
As you build your business’s Internet presence, take extra care to see that
the look, tone, and character you present online is identical to the image you
present in your other communications and in your bricks-and-mortar outlet,
if you have one.
Your Web site rarely makes the first impression for your business. Almost
always, it reinforces an impression that’s first made through your advertising
and marketing materials, your physical business outlet, or online links to
your site. If your Web presence isn’t consistent with the brand image cus-
tomers expect to encounter, they’re likely to think they’re on the wrong site.
As you design your site, keep in mind that online customers may also see
your magazine ads, walk by your front door or display windows, look you up
in the phone book, or meet you or your staff at business or social gatherings.
For your Web site to work for your brand, it needs to synch with all the other
212
Part III: Launching Your New Brand 

impressions people form about your organization. Online, use the same style
of type, the same colors, the same logo presentation, the same slogan, the
same design approach, and the same core marketing message that guides all
your other marketing communications.
Online customers also expect the same kind of responsiveness they receive
at bricks-and-mortar outlets — and then some. In person, you can apologize
if something takes a bit longer than usual or if a service mishap occurs.
Online, you don’t have that luxury. If your site crashes, is slow to load, is con-
fusing to navigate, or doesn’t immediately present the desired information,
customers are likely bail out, never to return.
Making your home page your online business lobby
In the same way that a physical business space has an entry area where visi-
tors are greeted, oriented, and inspired to enter and consider purchase trans-
actions, your home page needs to provide a similar welcome to your Web
space.
In many ways, the Internet is like a giant shopping mall. As people shop,
wander, or collect information, they go from one site’s home page to the next.
At each online stop, they count on the home page to tell them where they are,
what they can expect to find, and how to proceed to get more information.
Your home page is the single most important page of your Web site. It’s
where most traffic arrives and where most consumers form their initial
impressions of your online presence. If your home page doesn’t do its job,
the rest of your site hardly has a chance. To make sure your home page is the
best it can be, follow this advice:
 Create a home page that makes a strong, clean, clear impression for
your brand. The most frequent mistake that online marketers make is to
create a home page with an overload of information in a visually chaotic
layout that’s easier to ignore than it is to look at.
 Assign your home page three functions and three functions only:
• To announce that the user has landed in your brand space
• To make a quick and strong impression for your brand by 
establishing your brand look and promise
• To immediately communicate how the user can access additional
information
 If your home page starts to look like a newsletter for your company,
redesign it ASAP. Great home pages are clean and inviting with obvious
buttons to click to quickly access all additional information. See Figure 12-1
for before and after examples of a home page that was redesigned to
heighten effectiveness.

Getting People to Your Site
Opening your Web site is a lot like opening the doors to a new business loca-
tion or getting a new toll-free phone number. It only matters if you promote
the news, gain interest in the offering, give people a reason to be in touch,
and do everything possible to lead people to your site.

Register with search engines
When online users want to find information, most often they visit a search
engine or directory, enter a description of the material they’re seeking, and
wait for the results to appear in the form of a list of Web pages that seem to
fit the request.
 Search engines like Google collect information by using a program
called a spider to read and index Web sites, sending keywords from the
sites back to the search engine index. Then each time a Web user
searches for keywords, the engine goes to its database, finds sites with
words that match the request, and provides a list of results.
 Directories like Yahoo! include lists that are categorized by people who
read the sites and index information for access by users.
When your site is ready for prime time, submit your URL or domain name
address to leading search engines and directories in order to begin the
process of getting your site recognized in Web searches. Minimally, follow
these steps:
1. Register your site at Open Directory (www.dmoz.org/add.html).
Submit your site address for free, wait three weeks, check to see if your
site is in the directory, and resubmit it if it hasn’t been picked up. The
Open Directory Project is the largest, most comprehensive human-
edited directory of the Web. Registration with this site is an essential
step because Open Directory powers the core searches of the Web’s
largest and most popular search engines, including AOL Search, Google,
Netscape Search, and hundreds of other sites. When you’re on this free
directory, you’re likely to be listed with the other major search engines
as well.
2. After registering with Open Directory, register your site with individ-
ual major search engines and directories as well.
To do this, go to Search Engine Watch (www.searchenginewatch.com)
and click on Search Engine Submission Tips for current information on
registering your site with search engines and directories. The arena of
search engines and registration fees changes rapidly, and this site can
keep you up-to-date.
Help search engines find your site
Google powers the majority of online searches, and the goal of most Web site
owners is to achieve good Google presence. An outstanding resource for
achieving this victory is Building Your Business With Google For Dummies by
Brad Hill (Wiley), which includes these tips:
215
Chapter 12: Sending Your Brand into Cyberspace

 Build pages around core keywords that define each page’s topical focus.
 Incorporate core keywords into the page’s content.
 Place core keywords in each page’s <META> tags, which are the hidden
HTML code commands that search engines scan.
 Fill in the <TITLE> tag, using core keywords.
 Use <alt> tags, with keywords, on page graphics.
 Use text, not graphical buttons, for navigation links.
 Register and use domains that describe the site’s business.
 Avoid splash pages, which are entry pages that visitors must click
through to get to your home page.
 Devote one page to a comprehensive site map.
 Keep pages focused, and write new pages for divergent subjects.
 Don’t use spamming, keyword stuffing, or cloaking. All three techniques
aim to trick search engine spiders into heightening a site’s ranking in
search engine results. They’re considered unethical approaches, and
when discovered, they prompt search engines to take action ranging
from lowering the site’s rank to banning it from the index.
 Build a network of incoming links from other sites to your site (see the
following section of how-to advice).
Building Your Business With Google For Dummies offers other valuable advice,
including the suggestion that you test your keywords at www.wordtracker.com.
This fee-based service offers a free trial after which you can subscribe for
periods ranging from one day to one year. Another free resource is the
Google Keyword Sandbox. Go to adwords.google.com/select/
KeywordToolExternal, enter a general keyword or phrase for your busi-
ness or product, and review the long list of related terms that appears. This
tool is intended for use by businesses using the pay-per-click advertising pro-
gram called Google AdWords, but nonusers can benefit from it as well.
Build incoming links to your site
Nearly all Web search experts agree that the best way to optimize your online
presence is to establish a broad network of links that direct traffic to your
site. Get started by following these steps:
1. Submit your site to search engines and directories (see “Register with
search engines” earlier in this chapter).
216
Part III: Launching Your New Brand 

2. Establish link exchanges with compatible sites to build visibility for
your site and drive incoming traffic.
Contact sites that attract visitors with interests similar to your site’s vis-
itors, and work out arrangements whereby you each link to the other’s
site in order to increase traffic to both sites.
3. Publish articles online to generate publicity and gain links to your site.
Also, submit articles to e-zines, newsletters, and magazines that are
delivered via e-mail to subscribers. Turn to www.zinos.com, ezine
dir.com, or www.ezinearticles.com for article submission advice.
4. Develop online referrals by getting your link included on the Web
sites of manufacturers whose products you carry, professional organi-
zations to which you belong, and organizations with which you do
business.
5. Develop online affiliations that link your site to sales sites in return
for a commission on resulting sales.
For information on this type of connection, visit Commission Junction at
www.cj.com.
Promote, promote, promote
To gain brand visibility online, use every resource available to lead people to
your site, beginning with the following approaches:
 Include your Web site address on all your stationery products, including
business cards, letterhead, envelopes, and note cards.
 Include an invitation (and a reason) to visit your Web site in all your
marketing communications, including ads, brochures, news releases,
presentations, and displays.
 Feature your Web site address on your packaging and products.
 Post your Web address on your business vehicles and signage.
 Include your Web address (and a reason to visit your site) in your
voice-mail recording, on-hold messages, and e-mail signature file.
 Include your Web address on every page of printed or electronic
newsletters or brochures.
 Add a “Tell a friend” function to your Web site so that visitors can refer
others to your site.
217
Chapter 12: Sending Your Brand into Cyberspace

Using Blast E-Mail to Reach 
Your Market
Blast e-mail — also known as bulk e-mail — resembles direct mail except that
it goes out electronically and is regulated by antispam regulations.
If you have a good list of customers, associates, and business contacts who
have given you permission to send them e-mails, an e-mail blast is a great
way to announce your brand or to share brand news on an ongoing basis.
All you need for e-mail blasts is a list of people who have opted in to receive
your e-mails, e-mail messages that are likely to be opened and read, and a
way to manage the program.
Building permission marketing networks
Before sending e-mail blasts, be double sure that the people on your e-mail
list will welcome your message by seeing that they match at least one of the
following descriptions:
 They’ve opted in to your e-mail list by providing your organization with
their e-mail addresses. Most well managed e-mail programs include a
double opt-in system that accompanies a first e-mailing with a response
request so that the recipient either reconfirms interest or opts out of
future mailings.
 They’re friends, colleagues, suppliers, customers, or prospects who
have requested similar information in the recent past.
 They were referred to you by a trusted resource.
After you create an opt-in mailing list, manage it well by taking these 
precautions:
 Never publish your e-mail list on your Web site, even in a well-meaning
way that provides contact information for organization members or
clients.
 Never enter recipient addresses in the “To” section of your blast e-mail.
Protect addresses by entering your own address in the “To” area and
then entering all recipient addresses as blind carbon copies, using the
“BCC” address option in your e-mail program.
218
Part III: Launching Your New Brand 

 Include an Unsubscribe link in all e-mails so that people can opt out of
your mailings.
 If you haven’t used your opt-in e-mail list for three or more months, 
send a pre-mailing before sending your blast e-mail. In the pre-mailing,
briefly announce that you’ve got a new e-newsletter or brand mailing,
and ask recipients to “Click here” to receive your mailing. The pre-mailing
helps you determine which e-mail addresses are no longer valid and also
helps you steer clear of the spam complaints you’re bound to get by
sending e-mails to people with whom you haven’t been in touch for
months on end.
Getting your e-mail opened and read
When you’re ready to send a blast e-mail, follow this advice:
 Write a five- to seven-word subject line that your recipients will find
familiar. Include your company name if they know your business. People
open e-mails that they believe are relevant to their interests. Avoid the
kinds of subject lines that are typical in spam mailings, such as too-good-
to-believe come-on lines, titles in all-capital letters, or titles that scream
for action with phrases like “limited time offer” or “click now.”
 Include your company name in the “From” box. This step signals that
the e-mail is from a familiar source, and it may also help you get past
your recipients’ spam filters.
 Keep your message brief (ten lines or so) and casual. To tell a more
complete story, link the e-mail recipient to your Web page or invite a
subscription to your e-newsletter. Either approach heightens involve-
ment with your brand.
 Expect your e-mail message to be quickly scanned. Grab interest with
an attention-getting opening line, and use a P.S. to inspire further action.
Stay away from long paragraphs, double-space every few sentences, and
include bullets for easy-to-view lists.
 Use easy-to-open and easy-to-read plain text for news announcements
or for quick, special e-mail offers. If you choose to use HTML, avoid
JavaScript, which gets blocked by most e-mail applications.
 Include an e-mail signature file at the end of every message. Use this
area to present your brand name and slogan, physical address, contact
information, e-mail confidentiality statement, and a promotional message
such as a newsletter subscription invitation. (Go to the help area of your
e-mail program if you need instructions for setting up an e-mail signature.)

Blogging and Podcasting
Increasingly, brand builders use online tools to spread their brand messages,
to build emotional connections with consumers, and to reach those who
influence the brand’s success. The two online tools you’re bound to hear
about most often are blogs and podcasts.
Blogging basics
Blog, short for web log, is the term for online journals that share news, ideas,
and — above all — opinions. Blog topics run the gamut, but they almost
always have the following features:
 They’re graphically simple and full of short entries, called posts, that are
updated frequently and arranged so that newest items appear first.
 They focus on a single point of view or interest area and reflect the 
opinions of the blog author. Online, they’re akin to the newspaper’s 
op-ed page.
 They’re informal in tone.
 They allow users to search story archives.
 They use RSS (Rich Site Summary or Really Simple Syndication) or a sim-
ilar format that allows blog posts to be distributed and shared on other
sites with a link back to the originating site.
Gaining visibility
Some brand marketers have their own blogs (for example, check out the
Google blog at www.googleblog.blogspot.com). Others work to gain
mentions in posts on existing blogs.
220
Part III: Launching Your New Brand 
Spam versus opt-in e-mail
Spam is e-mail that’s sent to people who didn’t
request it, don’t want it, and feel that their in-
boxes have been invaded by its arrival. Opt-in
e-mail is e-mail that’s been requested. Spam is
annoying at best, and illegal at worst. Opt-in
e-mail is welcomed and opened. Can you figure
out which route you want to follow?
To keep your e-mail out of the dreaded spam
category, take time to understand and comply
with the CAN SPAM ruling, passed by the U.S.
government in 2003. For information on the leg-
islation, visit www.wilsonweb.com/wmt9/
canspam_comply.htm.

To gain visibility in the blogosphere:
 Register your blog with blog directories such as www.blogwise.com,
www.blogcatalog.com, and www.bloghub.com.
 Read and follow blogs that align with the interests of your target audi-
ence to gain customer insight and information on market trends. When
you find a blog that sounds like a good fit with your own blog, inquire
about establishing reciprocal links.
 When appropriate, post comments on blogs or submit tips or links that
match with the blog content.
Starting your own blog
Following are some suggestions for starting your own blog:
 Be sure you’re ready to commit to the upkeep of a blog, which involves
keeping content fresh and updated daily or at least weekly.
 Be clear about the distinct point of view or interest area your blog will
advance. If a blog sounds like it’s full of corporate lingo, it’s basically
dead on arrival.
 Visit www.blogger.com/start for free assistance in getting your blog
up and running.
 Be ready to receive and respond to reader feedback.
 Promote your blog through ongoing marketing efforts and by registering
it with blog directories.
Podcasts
Podcasts are sound files that subscribers can access online and transfer to
personal digital audio players in order to listen to them whenever and wher-
ever they want.
Some brand marketers create podcasts to share information about their
offerings. Other marketers sponsor podcasts in the same way that advertis-
ers sponsor broadcast shows. For example, in 2005, Lexus announced that it
had become a sponsor of California public radio station KCRW’s podcasts.
To find out more about podcasting and how to create your own podcasts,
start by visiting sites such as www.ipodder.org and www.pod101.com. You
can also grab a copy of Podcasting For Dummies by Tee Morris, Evo Terra,
Dawn Miceli, and Drew Domkus (Wiley).
221
Chapter 12: Sending Your Brand into Cyberspace

For some good examples of podcasts, go to www.dummies.com and click on
Subscribe to Dummies.com Podcasts. Then choose from any of the podcasts
listed on the page.
When you feel you’re ready to incorporate podcasts in your publicity 
program, follow these steps:
1. Search podcast directories such as www.podcastalley.com or
www.podcast.net to find podcasts with content that matches your
business arena and listeners that match your customer profile.
2. Listen to podcasts to get a feel for their style and content.
3. Submit tips, information, news, audio releases, or story or interview
ideas to selected podcasts, following the exact same criteria you’d use
to gain publicity in traditional media.

A
fter you build, launch, and gain market awareness of
your brand, it’s time to kick the brand management
process into high gear in order to create the kind of brand
experience that results in devoted, passionate customers
and true brand value. This part helps you manage a brand
that earns its keep — both in the minds of your customers
and on the bottom line of your balance sheet.
Count on the upcoming five chapters to help you develop
your brand’s equity by creating brand champions, consis-

Suiting Up a Team of 
Brand Champions
In This Chapter
 Generating organization-wide brand buy-in
 Delivering your brand at every customer contact point
 Creating brand ambassadors
P
ut simply, people power brands.
Brands are made or broken by human encounters that either advance or
erode brand promises because each contact builds brand passion, brand
apathy, or brand disdain. The difference between well-launched brands that
fizzle and well-managed brands that soar to great value lies in the brand
experience, which is the result of customers’ everyday encounters with 
your name, your product, your organization, and your people.
A great brand name, logo, promise, and communication program are essen-
tial ingredients for brand success, but to hit a branding home run, you need
to staff your branding game plan with a committed team of brand champions.
Building an organization full of individuals committed to the brand is the only
way to ensure that your brand vision and values are accurately reflected and
your brand promise is consistently delivered.
In this chapter, we give you a plan to follow to make sure you have a 
team of brand champions on your side. We also explain how to get the 
most out of your sales force and how to target investors and your best 
customers.

Branding from the Top Down
Great leaders embody great brands. Leading a great brand takes courage and
decisiveness. It requires commitment to the brand promise, discipline to
build an organization around fulfillment of the promise, and perseverance to
keep the promise through all customer contacts and market conditions.
The person whose name sits at the very top of your organizational chart
needs to be your brand’s evangelist-in-chief.
 If that person is you, be prepared to be your brand’s primary champion,
your organization’s brand coach, the mirror of your brand’s promise,
and the driving force behind the quality of your customer’s brand 
experience.
 If that person is your boss, gain top-tier involvement before taking
another step in the branding process. Without buy-in from the highest
rung of your organization’s management ladder, your brand will never
reach its potential.
Under good leadership, great branding is almost transparent. The brand
experience is so all-enveloping that consumers can’t tell where branding
stops and where business starts because great brands are mirror reflections
of great businesses. They represent values and organization-wide commit-
ments that reach all the way to the core of an organization, spanning the
entire length and width of the organizational chart.
Writing your branding playbook
To make branding an organization-wide commitment, take three essential
steps:
1. Communicate your organization’s mission and vision clearly through-
out your company.
Your mission defines what you intend to do and the approach you’ll
follow to achieve your aspirations. Your vision defines why your com-
pany does what it does and the ultimate good you aim to achieve
through your success. Together your mission and vision orient all who
work with your organization to the ultimate aim you’re working toward
and the route you’ll take to get there. For help putting your statements
into words, see Chapter 6.
226
Part IV: The Care and Feeding of Your Brand

2. Build organization-wide understanding for your brand identity 
statement.
This statement encapsulates what you do, those you serve, how you
differ from all other similar solutions, and the promise you make to all
who deal with your organization, so it’s essential for your team to be on
the same page.
3. Make your brand promise an organization-wide commitment.
Your brand promise is the statement upon which you stake your reputa-
tion. It’s the essence of your brand and the quality you assure to all who
come into contact with your organization. Be sure that your entire team
knows the promise they’re helping to keep.
Keep in mind, however, that true brand culture stems from the beliefs, per-
sonalities, and values those leading the brand. It’s so authentic and heartfelt
that it’s caught, not taught, throughout the organization.
You can’t package and impose your brand mission or promise onto employ-
ees like a fabricated formula. We’ve heard about companies that assemble
their staffs to recite the mission statement each morning (or worse, to sing it
in staff meetings — believe it or not, we’ve seen this firsthand, much to the
embarrassment of the assembled employees). The only way to gain company-
wide buy-in is to start with buy-in at the top and to spread it with such enthu-
siasm that a strong sense of culture naturally follows.
To test how well your promise is known, embraced, and implemented in your
organization, answer the questions posed in Figure 13-1.
Becoming your brand’s MVP
“Walk the talk” may sound like an overused phrase, but in reality, it’s a tenet
that could be far better employed in today’s business world.
How many times have you entered a business that promises friendly service
only to stand around waiting for someone to offer some assistance? How
many times have you been assured by a company’s communications that
“to us, you’re a name, not a number” only to place a phone call that burns ten
minutes in a voice-mail maze that repeatedly requests your account number,
interspersed by blasé background music and an occasional automated voice
reminding you that your call is important?

Chapter 13: Suiting Up a Team of Brand Champions

To keep your brand promise, build a brand experience that conveys your
promise during each and every customer encounter. To do so, you need a
team of brand champions who know and believe in the promise, too.
Putting Your Brand Promise to the Test
How do you define your brand promise? 
State how your offering stands apart from all others in terms of features but more 
important in terms of consumer benefits. (See Chapter 6 for steps to follow.)
How do those in your organization define your brand promise?
Benchmark current awareness of your brand promise by asking individuals at different 
levels of your organization — from top management to service front lines – to describe 
how your organization differs from competitors and the unique promise that consumers 
can count on only from your organization.
How do you communicate your brand promise within your organization?
Is your brand promise the basis of your company name or slogan? Is your brand promise 
explained during employee training sessions? Is your brand promise – and its delivery – 
discussed during management planning sessions? Do you have programs that recognize 
and reward employees for actions that exemplify your brand promise? 
How have you coordinated the delivery of your brand promised?  
Have you studied how well your promise is conveyed and kept at each customer 
encounter point, whether through advertising, online, upon first call or visit, during the 
purchase transaction, at the point of billing, during delivery and after-purchase 
transactions, at the point of customer service or concerns, during post-purchase 
follow-up, through customer loyalty programs, and at all other points where the customer 
has an experience with your brand?
How well do your customers know your promise?
To really test whether your promise is clear, compelling, and well delivered, ask customers 
how they find your organization different from all competing entities. Ask how they would 
describe the promise they count on your business to keep. Ask what one attribute they 
most rely on from you; what one thing they would miss the most if your organization 
disappeared tomorrow. (Chapter 4 offers advice for conducting research.)

Part IV: The Care and Feeding of Your Brand

Following are some suggestions to ensure your team is as passionate about
your brand as you are:
 Keep the same promise that you make to your customers with your
employees. If you promise customers friendly service, promise your
employees a friendly employment setting. If you promise the highest-
quality offering, promise your employees the highest-quality work envi-
ronment, including the highest-quality production resources. If you
promise a super-creative product, promise employees super-creative
work surroundings. Great brands realize that, to convey a brand promise
with true belief, employees need to experience the promise firsthand.
 Make your work environment a mirror image of your brand experi-
ence. If you promise that your business team works together to serve
customers, break down the barriers of cubicles and closed doors so that
employees actually work in an atmosphere of teamwork. If you promise
the most creative solutions, foster a creative work environment (no uni-
forms, please!). We heard of one ad agency that took its unique creativity
promise so far as to say they wouldn’t hold company gatherings at an
establishment that served its sugar in cubes — a sign of regulated serv-
ings and traditional delivery that ran counter to the agency’s promise.
 Be sure your brand promise starts at the very top of your organiza-
tion. For a good example, the John Deere company Web site features a
page with the headline “Our Brand Promise” that contains this state-
ment: “In 1847 John Deere promised, ‘I will never put my name on a
product that does not have in it the best that I have in me.’ For more
than 150 years we’ve remained true to that commitment — building our
reputation by building value into every machine that bears our name.”
Make an organization-wide commitment to your brand promise, and then
make every business decision with the promise in mind, including decisions
about how you’ll create a work environment, employee training, and
employee rewards that help you walk the talk of your brand promise within
your organization.
Training Your Team
If you’re launching a new brand, before your brand makes its public debut,
prepare all players for their roles. Following the step-by-step advice in
Chapter 9, which covers training and inspiring your staff.
If you’re managing an existing brand, your training needs are twofold: To
recruit and train new employees into the brand culture and to enhance and
reward commitment to the brand among existing employees. This section
addresses these training needs.
229
Chapter 13: Suiting Up a Team of Brand Champions

Developing brand champions
When training employees to be brand champions, market position, brand
promise, and brand character are the three key points you need to be sure 
to stress.
Emphasizing your brand’s unique market position
When presenting your brand’s position to staff, use a device such as the posi-
tioning matrix (shown in Chapter 5) to illustrate and gain understanding for
the unique place your brand holds in its market. The positioning matrix also
provides a visual presentation of how your brand offers distinct attributes
and a different brand experience from competitive alternatives.
Chapter 5 also offers advice for positioning your brand and mapping your
brand’s position in your competitive arena.
Promoting your brand promise
Chapter 6 leads you through the steps involved to determine your brand
attributes and to write your business promise.
When presenting your promise to your employees, describe how your organi-
zation delivers on its promise at every point of your customer’s brand experi-
ence. Cite a wide range of examples, including how the promise is
 Upheld upon arrival by phone, in person, or online
 Echoed in your company’s e-mail signature
 Reflected in your company billings and follow-up statements
 Conveyed in marketing materials
 Presented at the point of customer service and even when receiving
complaints
Be ready to present examples to help employees understand their own and
their associates’ roles in upholding your business pledge and your cus-
tomers’ expectations.
Conveying brand character
Your brand character is the personality of your brand that’s reflected through
the look and tone of your brand expressions.
If people have human contact with your brand, your people are the most
important representatives of your brand character. For that reason, your staff
needs to understand your brand character and ways that they can reflect
your company image and promise. Otherwise, if you communicate one brand
character and then deliver service through a staff member who reflects a
complete different character, you’re in line for a credibility train wreck.
230
Part IV: The Care and Feeding of Your Brand

The following are ways to train your customers to represent your brand 
character:
 During an initial staff orientation, explain your brand character as a look
and tone — a personality — that’s based upon your organization’s
values, vision, and brand promise.
 Explain that every employee is a representative of the brand character.
 Describe your brand character in a statement such as, “Our brand char-
acter is [a description using words that you’d use to describe the personal-
ity of your brand if it were a person or a car; for instance, sophisticated,
fashionable, revolutionary, innovative, professional, elegant, or refined].
We reflect our character through brand expressions that are [a descrip-
tion of the mood and tone that all your marketing will project; for example,
chic and stylish, cutting-edge creative, calm and subdued, high-quality and
professional].
 Define how your organization manages its brand character through com-
pany dress, customer contact, office décor, correspondence manage-
ment, background music, aroma, color, and any other way that the
personality of your organization is expressed. Create policies where
appropriate, but focus on creating a brand promise and culture that runs
so deeply through your organization that employees naturally adopt it
as their own.
An example of pervasive brand character can be seen when walking
through lobby of a W Hotel. The brand describes itself as “W . . . for
warm, wonderful, witty, wired. W for welcome.” More than words,
though, the brand expresses its identity through every presentation
point, including employees who, within weeks of joining the hotel team,
seem to transform their own looks to become representatives of W’s
“young, hip” culture.
Gaining team buy-in
To win staff understanding and enthusiasm for your brand, treat brand train-
ing as a function worthy of time and effort by doing the following:
 See that each employee takes part in a formal brand training session
that presents
• A snapshot history of your organization
• A description of your market and how you provide the best solu-
tion to the market’s wants or needs
• Your brand definition
• Your brand’s unique position in your competitive arena
231
Chapter 13: Suiting Up a Team of Brand Champions

• Your brand’s distinguishing attributes and how they translate into
meaningful customer benefits
• Your brand’s character and how it’s reflected through employees
and at each customer contact point
• How your brand and branding program are keys to your business
success
Employees are more likely to buy in if they see how your brand supports
your business goals and objectives. For help in this area, check out
Chapter 3, which includes a worksheet to help you assess and prioritize
the brand strengths that are essential to your success.
 Plan informal brand training sessions that aim to immerse staff mem-
bers in your brand culture.
Following a classroom-style introduction to your brand, arrange for new
employees to experience your brand as a customer does, beginning with
a review of marketing materials and moving through contact with all
departments. As a result, each employee will see how various employ-
ees uphold the brand promise and the customers’ expectations.
 Arrange opportunities that allow employees to watch others make
brand presentations so they can see how the brand is described and
translated into customer benefits.
 Make brand training an ongoing effort.
Periodically ask employees questions such as:
• What attributes do you think customers most appreciate about 
our brand?
• From your encounters with customers or from your vantage point
within our organization, do you think that our customers accu-
rately understand our brand’s distinctions and how we differ from
competitors?
• If you were one of our primary competitors, how might you
describe the greatest weakness of our brand?
• What one customer contact point seems to you to be least effec-
tive at conveying our brand promise?
• If you could wave a magic wand and fix one thing that causes our
customer frustration or lack of confidence in our brand, what
would it be?
 Give employees the authority to go the extra mile to keep brand
promises, and reward them for their innovation and responsiveness.
232
Part IV: The Care and Feeding of Your Brand

Nordstrom is a shining example of an empowered team of confident
brand champions who are encouraged to use their own good instincts to
offer customized solutions, to right wrongs when they see them, and to
go overboard to provide the kind of customer experience that fuels the
consumer grapevine with positive word-of-mouth. Most amazing, compa-
nies like Nordstrom don’t tout their service success stories in publicity
features or advertising campaigns. Instead, they let the stories reach the
outside world via passionate customers who spread the good word with
far greater impact than any company-generated communication could
achieve.
 On a regular basis, ask yourself and your staff: What kinds of stories
are customers telling about our service?
If you’re not totally proud of what you believe is being said about you,
turn to Chapter 14 to examine and improve your customer experience.
233
Chapter 13: Suiting Up a Team of Brand Champions
It’s never crowded on the extra mile
The anonymous line that serves as this sidebar
title has been used in countless motivational
lectures, yet the extra mile remains wide open
for those willing to double their service, triple
their customer attention, quadruple their com-
mitment to customized solutions, and build
brand buzz and brand strength as a result.
To move into the elite group of brands that
cruise to success by amazing customers with
unfailing and exemplary experiences, follow
these four steps:
 Encourage employees to think like brand
owners, doing whatever they feel is nec-
essary to provide amazing customer expe-
riences, to anticipate and preempt
customer needs, to correct defects, and to
create passionate customers — and brand
enthusiasts — for life. For an example of an
award-winning service program, visit a
page of the Ritz-Carlton Web site, at
www.ritzcarlton.com/corporate/
about_us/gold_standards.asp,
that shows how the hotel company pre-
sents its values, philosophy, promise, and
service program.
 Empower employees to customize solu-
tions and service innovations. Give your
staff parameters, including budget guide-
lines, to provide on-the-spot customer solu-
tions without having to navigate frustrating
management layers.
 Recognize and reward outstanding service
efforts. By putting the spotlight on team
members who go out of their way to convey
your brand promise, you set the bar higher
for everyone.
 Live your brand promise inside and outside
your business, constantly finding new and
better ways to convey your brand message
and benefit to employees, customers, and
all in your community.

Prepping Your Sales Force
In most organizations, the salesperson is the active agent in the customer-to-
brand relationship chain, which follows this sequence:
1. Marketing communications generate awareness.
2. Inquiry responses inspire interest.
3. Online, phone, or in-person encounters heighten purchase desire.
4. Sales presentations inspire brand trust, reinforce brand promises, address
concerns, negotiate terms, and launch the customer relationship.
The best brand marketers view their sales forces as teams of brand ambas-
sadors. They make sure that salespeople are steeped in the brand culture
and armed with tools and scripts that help them not only explain the offering
but also inspire belief in the desirable benefit of the brand promise.
For example, Victoria’s Secret sells underwear, but the salespeople know that
what people are really buying when they make a purchase is the idea of sexy
romance. Harley-Davidson sells motorcycles, but people are really buying an
association with an independent and rebellious spirit. Lance Armstrong’s
LiveStrong armbands aren’t just about supporting research for a cure for
cancer; they’re also a representation of a belief in living life to the fullest.
Even more than your product, your brand promise inspires your customer’s
purchase decision. So arm your sales team with scripts for sharing your
story, brand testimonials and endorsements, techniques for overcoming
objections, and approaches for negotiating terms and closing sales without
ever varying from the brand message and promise.
Arming your sales force with testimonials
and product endorsements
Branding makes selling easier because it paves the way with trust-building
communications that establish credibility, confidence, and understanding of
a brand’s unique value and benefits.
Still, at the moment of purchase decision, customers need a final bit of inspi-
ration or reinforcement that the brand’s offering will deliver as promised.
This is true when customers are purchasing in-person, and it’s even more
important when they’re purchasing from Web sites or direct mailers.
234
Part IV: The Care and Feeding of Your Brand

To deliver the extra jolt of assurance that a branded product is as good as it’s
touted to be, provide your sales force with testimonials and endorsements
from satisfied customers or authorities.
Personal testimonials
When you share good words from past customers, prospective customers
gain confidence that you have a good business track record, that you deliver
on your promises, and that you stand by your products and services.
When obtaining and presenting customer testimonials, follow these tips:
 Wait until purchase transactions are completed before asking a satisfied
buyer if he or she would say a few words on behalf of your brand.
 Encourage customers to provide frank comments. Even if the informa-
tion isn’t suitable for a testimonial, it’s valuable as you refine your offer-
ing and brand experience.
 Whether customers speak or write their comments, ask them to focus 
on the aspect of their buying experience that they found most compelling.
Some customers may cite service, some may cite product selection, and
some may cite convenience, guarantee, or after-sale service. Specific
praise makes the buyer’s comments more believable to prospective 
customers.
 Ask customers to include details about their experiences. Consider the
difference in impact between, “I’m impressed by your willingness to go
the extra mile” and “We needed to pick up our new widget late on a
Thursday evening in order to fit our travel plans. We still can’t believe
that you not only worked long past closing hours but that you also made
our pick-up unnecessary by delivering the widget to our doorstep.
Thanks!” The latter statement obviously gives prospective customers a
better idea of the level of service they can expect to receive.
 When obtaining written permission to use the testimonial get identifica-
tion information, including at least the customer’s first name, hometown,
and title or business affiliation if possible and appropriate.
When dealing with customer testimonials, avoid these mistakes:
 Never offer cash, product, or favors in return for customer testimonials.
 Don’t invent testimonials. They’re likely to sound phony (which they
are), and the practice is unethical.
 Don’t prompt customers to include marketing messages in their testimo-
nials. Let them speak freely. You want to collect genuine opinions about
how customers view the attributes and benefits of your offering and the
experience of dealing with your organization.
235
Chapter 13: Suiting Up a Team of Brand Champions

Celebrity endorsements
Celebrity endorsements link statements of support from well-known individu-
als with brands that somehow match up with the celebrity’s personality and
reputation — for a price. Usually celebrity endorsements are purchased with
cash, product, stock options, or some other form of compensation.
When considering using celebrities in your brand building program, weigh
these points:
 The most credible endorsements convince consumers that a respected
personality uses and benefits from your offering. A perfect example is
the pairing of Tiger Woods and Nike.
 The celebrity you employ to represent your brand must align perfectly
with your brand image.
 The best celebrity representatives actually use and personally support
the brands they advance, so you should aim to establish a relationship
that goes beyond product endorsement to include product usage and
affinity.
 Celebrity endorsements are worthy of legal contracts that define the rela-
tionship, the compensation, and what happens should the celebrity’s
integrity be damaged by scandal. Don’t proceed on a handshake.
Expert endorsements
When experts test, evaluate, and offer positive opinions on products, the
endorsements are valuable in developing consumer confidence as long as
you follow a few precautions:
 The expert must have clear and well-recognized qualifications.
 The expert must conduct a product test that conforms to testing stan-
dards in your industry. If the test proves that your offering is superior to
a competitor’s offering, keep records that support the claim.
 The expert must have no relationship with your business, or if a rela-
tionship exists, you must describe the relationship in all materials that
reference the test.
Organization endorsements
An organization endorsement is a seal of approval for a product from a 
reputable organization. The Good Housekeeping Seal is an example of an
organization endorsement. When showing that your offering has met an orga-
nization’s standards of excellence, turn things up a notch by following this
advice:
236
Part IV: The Care and Feeding of Your Brand

 Feature endorsements from organizations that have credibility and
meaning with your customer prospects.
 Before featuring an endorsement, comply with the organization’s stan-
dards and receive a formal acceptance and endorsement.
 Present the endorsement by including the organization’s name, logo, or
seal in your marketing materials and on your packaging.
 Feature endorsements only from actual, independent organizations,
never from organizations created solely for use in your marketing pro-
gram. Always check with each endorsing organization regarding how
you may use the endorsement and what kinds of restrictions apply.
Spreading the good word
When presenting testimonials or endorsements, remember that your top pri-
ority is to give credibility to your brand promise. Don’t expect the testimonial
to make the sale but rather to erase hesitation that tends to precede the
buying decision.
To make the most of testimonials from customers, celebrities, experts, or
organizations, present them in the following ways:
 Provide testimonials and endorsements in sales presentations. Share
accolades from past customers as well as details on expert test results.
 Include accolades in sales letters and literature. Intersperse testimoni-
als and endorsements with sales points rather than isolate testimonials to
a single page or letter enclosure. The effect will be more conversational
and more powerful.
 Feature testimonials on your Web site, where customers have few
other ways to gain personal confidence in your brand. Create a page
full of testimonials and endorsements, but also incorporate them
throughout your site so that site visitors can see summaries of real-life
experiences that encourage them to make a purchase or obtain more
information.
Intercepting objections
Objections open the door to brand building opportunities. When customers
share concerns or objections with your company’s representatives, at the
very least, the customers are involved in the sales conversation, and at the
most, they provide input that allows your company to clarify misunderstand-
ings and to uncover and address buying obstacles.
237
Chapter 13: Suiting Up a Team of Brand Champions

Most objections stem from one of three areas of concern.
 Lack of trust in your brand: Here’s where testimonials and endorse-
ments can come to the rescue.
 Preference for a competing brand: Arm your sales force with a clear
recap of the benefits and value your brand delivers so that they can pre-
sent a positive response that favorably compares your offering to like
products without taking any digs at competitors.
 Concern over your offer: Prepare your sales force to probe the concern
and to avoid jumping to the conclusion that price is the issue. Often con-
cerns have as much to do with questions about ease of use, appropriate-
ness of the offering, perceived risk in dealing with a new product or
brand, or even lack of authority to make the purchase. For each form of
concern, provide sales materials and scripts to address the issue.
• Price concerns: Provide ways to demonstrate worth, present prod-
uct value, show cost/value ratios, and show money- or time-saving
potential. Also provide salespeople with a range of purchase
options — from trial offers to bulk discounts to special terms or
installment plans — to address price barriers.
• Time concerns: Provide ways that salespeople can demonstrate
ease of use, installation, product adoption, training, or other time
concerns.
• Risk concerns: Provide demonstrations, trial offers, no-risk guaran-
tees, or service assurances to minimize the risk customers associ-
ate with a purchase. Also present testimonials, endorsements, and
case studies that replace risk concerns with product assurances.
In addition to dealing positively with concerns, train your salespeople to
log concerns and to share them with your organization on a periodic
basis. That way, when it’s time to revitalize your brand, you know the
kinds of issues you’re dealing with.

Getting Customers to Pledge
Allegiance to Your Brand
In This Chapter
 Creating customer loyalty through brand experiences
 Reaching beyond expectations
 Igniting customer passion for your brand
C
reating a brand name, a brand identity, and a brand promise are just the
beginning of the branding process. They’re like the ante you pay to play
in the high-stakes branding arena. They’re the down payment required to rise
above the noisy floor of me-too offerings and to win a chance at a preferred
place in customers’ hearts and minds, where great brands live and thrive.
You can’t just register a terrific brand name, design an award-winning logo,
craft a great brand promise, and then sit back and wait for the magic to
happen. Sorry, a great brand framework, of and by itself, isn’t enough to build
a great brand success story. Even good market awareness and strong con-
sumer purchases aren’t enough. Brand success requires one more essential
ingredient: customers with brand passion.
This chapter is about moving your brand into the winner’s circle by attract-
ing and keeping customers with allegiance, affection, and — the ultimate 
jackpot — true enthusiasm for your brand.
Kindling Customer Loyalty
Great brands are what they are because of sky-high customer enthusiasm
that results in nothing short of brand passion.
For good examples of the power of customer enthusiasm, consider the
brands whose logos you see displayed on car windshields or whose labels
are worn on the outside of clothes as badges of honor and affection. They’re

the brands that enjoy both customer pride of ownership and the incalculable
value of customer affection, loyalty, word-of-mouth, and brand allegiance.
Passionate employees and passionate customers (in that order) power great
brands. You can’t put the cart before the horse. You can’t create passionate
customers without first creating the kind of brand experience that only pas-
sionate employees can deliver. For help turning your employees into a team
of brand champions, flip back to Chapter 13.
When your organization’s ready to deliver awe-inspiring service that fulfills
your brand promise at every customer encounter point, you’re on your way
to developing passionate customers. This section details steps to follow in
getting your customers on your side 100 percent.
Turning sales transactions into 
customer relationships
The first step in developing brand allegiance is sparking a customer relation-
ship. Most customers fit into one of two categories:
 Transaction customers, who help build your bottom line: They approach
your business seeking a good deal, and their expectations usually are
based on low price coupled with outstanding features or convenience.
Transaction customers’ primary interest is in the deal rather than the
relationship. Although they may be happy enough with your business to
pass along positive word-of-mouth comments and even to make repeat
purchases, in most cases, they leave you in a heartbeat if a deeper dis-
count or better-sounding deal comes along.
Most transaction customers are transaction customers, period. But
sometimes, if you ignite their interest, enthusiasm, and trust, they sur-
prise you (and themselves) by becoming entranced by your brand expe-
rience and moving into the relationship customer category.
 Relationship customers, who help build your brand: They value loy-
alty, commitment, and trust even more than they value good deals. They
prefer to do business with those whose reputations they know and
whose promises they believe in.
When relationship customers choose a brand, they’re inclined to stick
with it if — and this is a big if and the whole point of this chapter — you
give them the kind of brand experience that turns them into brand
zealots and spread-the-word ambassadors.
240
Part IV: The Care and Feeding of Your Brand 

All customers are important in that they represent revenue and the potential
for good or bad word-of-mouth. But relationship customers benefit your
brand over and above the dollars they spend by contributing both to your
profitability and to your brand perception.
Why customer relationships matter
It costs a lot to win a first-time customer for your business. If that person
buys once and heads out the door never to be seen again, your business 
has seen the only revenue it will ever realize from your customer-attraction
investment.
On the other hand, if the customer buys again and again, your marketing
investment gets amortized, and the profitability you enjoy from your one-
time investment grows higher and higher. Numerous studies show that, by
winning repeat business from just 5 percent more customers, a business can
improve profitability by 75 to 100 percent.
Unquestionably, your bottom line is one major reason that customer rela-
tionships matter. Additionally, relationship customers can develop into so
much more.
 Relationship customers who are treated well and who receive consis-
tently good brand experiences develop into loyal customers.
 Loyal customers who are treated well and who receive consistently good
brand experiences make repeat purchases, even when promotions and
discounts aren’t involved. What’s more, loyal customers who are treated
like insiders and who gain a feeling of brand ownership turn into pas-
sionate customers.
 Passionate customers who are treated well and who receive consistently
good brand experiences become brand ambassadors.
 Brand ambassadors who are treated well and who receive consistently
good brand experiences spread the word on a brand’s behalf, fueling
marketplace awareness, positive perceptions, and brand value.
As proof of the power of brand ambassadors, the 2004
BusinessWeek/Interbrand “Best Global Brands” Special Report included
this statement: “Companies that are able to instill a sense of ownership
in near-fanatical customers showed the biggest gains in our fourth
annual ranking of the 100 most valuable global brands.”
No doubt you noticed a common theme in the preceding process that turns
relationship customers into brand ambassadors. The formula for converting
relationship customers into loyal customers, loyal customers into passionate
customers, and passionate customers into brand ambassadors is clear: Exceed
customer expectations, and deliver a consistently great brand experience.
241
Chapter 14: Getting Customers to Pledge Allegiance to Your Brand

Delivering a Great Brand Experience
In any competitive arena, brands make similar claims. Each promises to be
the friendliest, to have the highest quality, to offer the best pricing, or to
deliver countless other distinctions that, on closer inspection, aren’t all that
different from the claims of other brands that a consumer could choose
instead.
Yet when consumers gravitate to one brand over the others, their decisions
are rarely based on the words they’ve heard in marketing messages. Consumers
base their brand decisions on their own experiences. They choose and stay
with brands that — based on what they’ve personally seen and sensed —
they believe will keep their brand promises.
“Be the brand” isn’t just talk, it’s the key to branding success. Brand strategy
doesn’t move markets, but brand experience does.
Jeff Bezos, founder of Amazon.com, is widely quoted for his statement,
“A brand is what people say about you when you aren’t in the room.” Your
brand lives in the consumer’s mind, and it’s based on beliefs that are 
reinforced every time that person encounters your brand — directly or 
indirectly, and before, during, or after the sale.
To build the brand you want, create an experience that allows your cus-
tomers to feel your distinctions and that reaffirms your promise during 
every single encounter with your brand.
Putting your brand experience 
to a personal test
The first step in managing your brand experience is to experience your
brand, simple as that. How do you do that? Follow these suggestions:
 Arrive like customers arrive. Forget your usual insider shortcuts. If 
customers arrive by car, you should call or go online to obtain driving
instructions, and then pull into the lot or circle the block looking for a
place to leave your car (and at what price). If your customers reach you
online, you should conduct an online search for your business by using
both your name and keywords. If customers call your business, you
should dial in to see what a phone arrival is like.
 Shop like they shop. Go through the buying experience exactly as a cus-
tomer would, asking to see samples, requesting cost estimates, and com-
paring various options both within your company and with competitors.
Go through the trial or customization process, and experience every
other step involved in making the purchase decision.
242
Part IV: The Care and Feeding of Your Brand 

 Pause where they pause. Within the buying process, notice where and
how you wait. How long does it take to receive an initial greeting? Is the
wait time tolerable? Is the greeting appropriate? Do you receive strong
brand messages while you wait? Is the wait comfortable? Are you offered
refreshments? Does the wait, including its length and its distractions, fit
your brand image and promise?
 Use your product just as they use it. If customers have to sign an esti-
mate or a contract in order to buy your product, notice how the informa-
tion is presented, whether it’s perfectly clear, and what questions, if any,
come to mind. If they have to unpackage or assemble your product, go
through the steps yourself following the provided instructions to see if it
makes sense. Dial your help line to check out your support functions.
Then put the product to use to assess the user experience.
Use your findings to smooth the customer experience by
 Creating a map of how customers enter, buy from, and follow up with
your business. This information helps as you conduct your more formal
experience audit (see the next section).
 Noting and making plans to eliminate any customer barriers. Eliminate
all barriers, whether they’re physical (lack of parking), emotional (undue
waits), or product-oriented (packaging is hard to open; instructions are
difficult to understand).
 Noting and making plans to address any opportunities for service or
product enhancements. For example, if you find that customers are con-
sistently tailoring your product to suit their particular needs, include
customization as a free or low-cost option.
Auditing your brand experience
Brand experiences are the result of brand encounters, and brand encounters
are affected by
 Your business location
 How your signage looks to those passing by your business
 The look of the people who shop in your stores
 The caliber and cleanliness of your business vehicles
 The quality of your advertising
 The nature of your publicity
 The speed of your Web site
243
Chapter 14: Getting Customers to Pledge Allegiance to Your Brand

 The length of time phone calls are left on hold
 The friendliness and experience of customer service staff
 The flexibility of your return policies
 Whether your walkways are shoveled free of snow in the wintertime
This list barely scratches the surface of the ways that people form impres-
sions about your brand, but you get the idea. A complete customer contact
inventory could span the length of this book!
With so many encounter points, it’s no wonder that many businesses have
trouble maintaining a consistent image. With each lapse, though, no matter
how minor, consumers lose confidence in the brand’s ability to keep its
promise and to maintain its distinctions.
To establish and maintain the quality of your brand experience, take these
steps:
1. Determine every brand impression point that prospects and consumers
encounter when dealing with your business, from the pre-purchase
stage through the purchase experience and post-purchase.
2. Create a brand experience that conveys your brand promise without
fail or hesitation through encounters that consistently advance your
brand message, your brand tone and look, and your brand character.
3. Audit your brand promise on a regular basis to insure against reputation-
eroding communication or service lapses.
Pre-purchase impressions
Pre-purchase impressions usually take the form of advertising, direct mail,
displays, publicity, introductory presentations, and positive word-of-mouth
comments that aim to establish
 Brand awareness
 Brand distinctions
 Brand position
 Positive brand perceptions
 Brand relevance to consumer wants and needs
Most pre-purchase communications target prospective, new, or lapsed cus-
tomers with messages intended to prompt inquiries, product sampling, and,
ultimately, purchases.
244
Part IV: The Care and Feeding of Your Brand 

Purchase experience impressions
During the purchase process, consumers form impressions based on the
location of your business, the design of your physical or online setting, the
style and attitude of your employees (and even that of other customers), the
design of your packaging, the nature of your pricing, and the way they’re
treated by sales and service staff.
As you define and audit each purchase encounter point, remember that the
purpose of contact during the purchase process is to reinforce your brand
image and promise and also to
 Heighten consumer confidence
 Overcome consumer doubts or feelings of risk
 Underscore your brand distinctions and competitive advantage
 Build trust
 Convey your product value and positive price-value relationship
Post-purchase impressions
The strongest post-purchase impression comes from delivery of a branded
product that matches or exceeds the customer’s quality, use, and perfor-
mance expectations.
The post-purchase experience also includes your follow-up service, your cus-
tomer communications, your loyalty programs, your customer events and
promotions, how you handle the compliments and concerns that engaged
customers will share, and how you encourage customers to become more
involved in tailoring the brand experience to their unique wants and needs.
(See the section “Recipe for a cult brand” later in this chapter for more infor-
mation on this point.)
As you define and audit each post-purchase encounter point, be sure that
your company’s performance underscores your brand promise while also
 Demonstrating appreciation
 Exceeding customer expectations
 Addressing customer needs
 Encouraging involvement and brand ownership
Making use of your findings
As you conduct your brand experience audit, use the worksheet in Figure 14-1
as a guide and follow these steps:
245
Chapter 14: Getting Customers to Pledge Allegiance to Your Brand

1. Identify all brand impression points.
2. Evaluate the strength or weakness of each impression point based
on how well your organization currently performs at this point
and whether your performance has improved or slipped over the
recent past.
3. Identify any gaps between your brand promise and your brand 
experience.
4. Prioritize the gaps for immediate attention based on the seriousness
of the experience lapse and the prominence of the impression point.
5. Set improvement objectives, monitor progress, and reward your staff
for performance advances.
Making Sure You’re Exceeding 
Customer Expectations
In today’s fast-paced business world, it’s hard to meet customer expectations
on a consistent basis, let alone exceed them. And yet, market expectations
are higher and more important to brand success than ever.
Even customers who value relationships with your brand will defect if their
expectations aren’t met. In fact, even those whose expectations are met will
defect if they sense a quality gap (an experience that falls short of expecta-
tions) or if another brand wows them with an over-the-top brand experience
that makes yours pale in comparison.
Protecting your customer base from defection takes work — and a strong
brand. When customers believe in your brand promise, and when they con-
sistently receive a clear brand message and a good brand experience, they’re
more likely to cut you some slack and remain true to your brand even if one
encounter falls short once in a rare blue moon.
To measure how well you’re doing at delivering an exemplary customer 
experience, measure your customer satisfaction levels on a frequent basis.
Figure 14-2 includes a chart to guide your assessment. As you fill it out, follow
your gut instinct and collect input from those who work with customers and
manage customer relation departments in your business in order to arrive at
your responses. Periodically, you should also conduct customer satisfaction
research, following the research advice in Chapter 4.

Igniting Customer Passion
Customers don’t fall in love with a brand overnight. First they need a little
wooing. Customers need
 To meet a brand that interests them. They need to hear a name, see a
logo, and encounter a brand message that somehow makes them think,
“Hey, this could be for me.”
 To be presented with a promise that compels them to want to get fur-
ther involved.
 To have a brand experience that fuels their interest while underscor-
ing their initially formed positive impressions.

Part IV: The Care and Feeding of Your Brand 

 To be overwhelmed by the pride they feel in simply saying that the
brand is “theirs.” They need to believe that everything about the brand
is so right and that everything about the brand’s products, service,
promise, people, and clientele is so consistently ideal that the brand 
is somehow capable of enriching their lives on a personal level.
Only when your brand has achieved awareness, interest, involvement, trust,
and pride of ownership can it ignite consumer passion.
Generating buzz
One way to launch the push for passionate customers is to use what’s called
buzz marketing, which is essentially high-powered word-of-mouth that aims
to get people telling other people who tell other people about your brand and
its products and service.
Buzz marketing is a fairly new term with a long history. For decades mar-
keters have worked to get their brands in use and talked about by those
whose opinions influence others. When movie stars stand on the red carpet
at the Oscars announcing that they’re “wearing Armani,” that’s buzz market-
ing. But on a more practical scale, when an online chat room participant
touts a new product, that’s buzz marketing, too.
249
Chapter 14: Getting Customers to Pledge Allegiance to Your Brand
What’s in a scent?
Want an example of a strong brand experi-
ence? Think of Cinnabon. Within a football
field’s distance of the shopping mall food court,
you know whether or not it has a Cinnabon. 
The company has perfected what’s called an
olfactory signature — more commonly known
as a scent — that announces the brand’s pres-
ence and readies customers for what has
become a highly predictable brand experience.
Brands are comprised of memories, and
according to those who study such things, smell
is the sense that most effectively triggers
memory. Cinnabon manages its brand around its
scent. It distances its stores from outlets that
may compromise its aroma, and then it delivers
a product and a customer experience that
aligns with the smell that brought people toward
the store in the first place.
More and more brands are getting into the
scent-as-brand-experience arena. For example,
some hotels have started perfuming their lob-
bies with stress-reducing brand aromas or
wafting the smell of the espresso bar toward
waiting areas. The latter establishes a brand
scent while also supplementing hotel revenues
with sales from the coffee bar business. How’s
that for double-duty!
Not every brand has or needs a brand scent, but
at the very least, a pleasant smell leaves a pos-
itive lasting impression. So how does your
brand smell? Enter your business and inhale to
sense the memory that customers carry away.

ASSESSING THE QUALITY OF YOUR CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE 
1.  Assess current and past performance (1=low; 5=high). 
2.  Assess competitors’ performance.
Areas in which performance has slipped or competitors excel indicate potential

Buzz marketing falls under the category of viral marketing because, like a
virus, it spreads with a frenzy as soon as it’s started, and that’s the whole
attraction.
To generate buzz marketing, start with product news that people actually
want to hear about and talk about. Then spread the word, either on your own
or through passionate consumers. Use any of these communication channels:
 Online, gain visibility in chat rooms and forums where those who fit
your customer profile gather and where people discuss products like the
one you’re offering.
 Start a company blog (or encourage avid customers to start a brand
blog) that’s full of information, opinions, and ideas about your brand. 
As an alternative, provide information to existing blogs that match your
brand’s image (see Chapter 12 for how-to information on branding
online).
 Use blast e-mails to spread brand news and inspire buzz among your
established clientele (see Chapter 12).
 Get your product in use by passionate consumers who can’t say enough
about it. Cultivate the kind of fanatics Winston Churchill was talking
about when he said “A fanatic is one who can’t change his mind and
won’t change the subject.”

Consumers helping consumers catch brand spirit
In 2004, when the Mozilla Foundation introduced
the open-source Web browser Firefox, it did so
with a user-organized viral campaign titled
“Spread Firefox” that did exactly as its name
implied. Within days of the browser launch,
Firefox was generating a million downloads a
day. Tens of thousands of brand fans signed up
to serve as marketing volunteers on a quest 
to get Web sites to display Firefox promotional
buttons and banners and to get the Firefox word
out through blogs, chat rooms, mainstream
media, and even a full-page ad in The New York
Times, paid for with donated dollars.

Recipe for a cult brand
Cult brands happen when consumers take brand passion to the nth degree.
They happen when consumers adopt the brand as “theirs” instead of “yours.”
When you hear consumers say “my iPod,” “my Google news page,” “my IKEA,”
or “myspace.com” (that one’s right in the name), they’ve taken ownership of
the brand and its product or service.
For as long as brands have existed, there have been cult brands. But in the
past, most cult brands were small, underdog brands that attracted I’d-rather-
fight-than-switch customers who stood by their brands with pride even when
hardly anyone else even knew the brand name.
Today, even the biggest brands inspire cult brand followings by using all or
most of the following strategies:
 Start with a unique brand identity and promise that consumers truly
want to be part of. Then spotlight and stay true to your brand differ-
ences and distinctions.
 Offer products that customers not only can customize but that you
prefer them to customize in order to adapt the products to their unique
consumer preferences, no matter how far-out and unusual.
 Create a brand experience that’s like no other and that never, ever, falls
short of the consumer expectation.
 Emphasize viral marketing, buzz marketing, and good old-fashioned
word of mouth over traditional advertising. (See the preceding section
for more on viral and buzz marketing.)
 Create fans both among your employees and among your customers,
and support development of brand fan clubs, Web sites, forums, blogs,
events, and any other channel that allows those who know and love
your brand to share their opinions.
 Create or at least support the formation of a community of brand fans
who personify your brand by displaying it on personalized items, talking
about it, and sharing their enthusiasm with others.

Valuing Your Brand
In This Chapter
 Appreciating the good economics of a great brand
 Evaluating the value of your brand
 Understanding brand equity and how to build it
I
t seems almost too good to be true that a name, a promise, and a great
reputation can be worth thousands, millions, or even billions of dollars,
but it’s a fact you can bank on when you build and manage a great brand.
Often, when companies are bought and sold, as much as half of the money
that trades hands covers the purchase of the brand name and all it means 
in the marketplace. That means that roughly fifty cents out of every dollar
exchanged in many business sales goes not for inventory, buildings, physical
items, business contracts, accounts receivable, or other tangible assets but
for the purchase of the brand — something no one can actually see or touch,
which is why brand equity is called an intangible asset.
Brand equity is so important that, in the world’s most successful businesses,
the most valuable single intangible asset is the brand.
This chapter defines what it takes to build the value of your brand, how to
convert brand value to brand equity (and how to protect that equity), how to
measure and enhance your brand’s worth, and how to leverage the strength
of your brand for greater business, financial, and community good.
Great brands are great assets. This chapter helps you get your money’s worth.

The Brand Value–Brand 
Equity Connection
When it comes to the value of a brand, you have two elements to be con-
cerned with:
 How your brand is valued by consumers: Your brand’s value in con-
sumer minds is the result of public perception formed by all the impres-
sions your brand makes in its marketplace. If consumer impressions are
positive and consistent, your brand’s value is likely to be positive and
consistent, too. If impressions are erratic or even negative, brand value
is likely to waver and sink on the news.
 How your brand is valued by investors or prospective brand buyers:
Your brand’s value as an asset is called brand equity. Brand equity is
determined by a complex process that weighs your brand’s current and
future monetary value, based not only on consumer perceptions but
also on the ability of your brand to deliver economic advantages to its
owner in the future.
Revving up the economic engine
From its invisible post deep in consumers’ minds, brand value fuels market
activity. When your brand value is high, your brand enjoys a long lineup of
economic advantages, including:
 Premium pricing: When consumers hold your brand’s attributes and
promise in high esteem, they’re willing to pay more for what they per-
ceive is higher value and lower risk than they believe is represented by
lesser-known or lesser-valued alternatives. As a result of high brand
value, your brand enjoys the benefit of lower price sensitivity and price
elasticity. Consumers purchase highly valued brands even when the
price fluctuates because their decision is based on the perception of
brand quality and not the product price.
 Lower cost of sales: When consumers value a brand highly, they make
repeat purchases and buy with greater purchase frequency — without
the need for extensive and costly sales promotions, sales negotiations,
and customer retention efforts on your part. As a result, high brand
value allows you to reduce sales-acquisition costs by amortizing a one-
time sales expense across multiple purchases and a longtime client 
relationship.
254
Part IV: The Care and Feeding of Your Brand 

 Lower cost of promotion: Consumers who value your brand highly
become brand ambassadors. They enhance your brand’s marketplace
visibility by speaking well on your behalf, spreading positive word-of-
mouth, and recruiting others into your clientele at no additional promo-
tional cost to your business.
 Higher market share: When customers stay loyal to your business — and
recruit new customers to boot — you enjoy increased market share, which
is the percentage of market activity captured by each competitor in a
market arena. Dominant market share provides a two-pronged economic
advantage: It reduces your brand’s need for new business development
expenses while increasing your brand’s immunity from competitive attacks.
 Lower employee turnover: High brand value almost always exists in the
minds of employees before it reaches the minds of consumers. (Chapter 13
is full of tips for instilling a sense of brand value and brand passion 
in your employee team.) When consumers catch the brand spirit from
employees, consumers tend to pass their brand enthusiasm back to
employees, making employees’ jobs easier and far more enjoyable,
thereby reducing employee turnover.
Gaining a competitive advantage
Strong brand value inoculates an organization against competitive threats it
may otherwise face. It also provides a number of other competitive advan-
tages, including:
 Consumer recognition: Brands with high brand value enjoy strong sup-
port and loyalty from customers. This loyalty results in long-term rela-
tionships that are resistant to overtures from competitors. It also results
in higher sales volume, lower cost of sales, and greater return on invest-
ments in business development and customer retention.
 Industry recognition: Brands with high value enjoy stature in their
industries that results in advantageous industry leadership roles, indus-
try trade media coverage, favorable relationships with industry suppli-
ers, and profitable industry supplier terms.
 Media recognition: High brand value results in high market awareness,
including awareness among those who cover news stories. When
reporters seek comments from industry leaders, they call on the names
they know, catapulting high-value brands to even more prominence.
 Financial industry recognition: The financial world monitors brand
value as a strong indicator of the strength of an organization’s management
and corporate health. Analysts and investors see strong brands as reflec-
tions of strong businesses that they reward with higher levels of invest-
ment, lower cost of capital, and advantageous financial relationships. (In
Chapter 13, you can get help improving your performance in this arena.)
255
Chapter 15: Valuing Your Brand

Brands with high value enjoy a protected market position for the simple
reason that their market strengths are so hard to tackle that competitors set
their sights on different, more open markets or competitors instead.
To assess the current value of your brand, use the worksheet in Figure 15-1.
Estimating Your Brand’s Equity
When a customer goes out of his way to buy a pair of sneakers bearing a cer-
tain logo, a cup of coffee from a certain outlet, jewelry in a certain pale blue
box, a donut made while-you-watch at a certain bakery, or a reference book
bound in a certain yellow-and-black cover, he does so because he believes
that the product he’s buying offers a unique set of benefits. Those benefits
translate into what consumers perceive as brand value.
When consumers go out of their way on a repeated basis, when they willingly
pay a premium to obtain the set of benefits they attribute to a branded prod-
uct, and when they encourage others to do the same, they deliver an eco-
nomic advantage — brand equity — to the brand owner.
As a brand owner, you can estimate your brand’s worth by following a few
recognized approaches.
Brand equity measuring sticks
To measure brand equity, most brand evaluators assess a brand’s ability to
achieve premium pricing, lower costs, and business strength and growth.
Sales performance
As a starting point in evaluating the worth of your brand, assess whether
your sales are going up and at what rate.
1. Calculate the percentage of sales growth your brand has experienced
for each of the past three years.
For example, if two years ago your sales totaled $3 million and last year
they grew to $3.25 million, your business experienced one-year growth
of 8.3 percent. (Sales were up $250,000, and $250,000 ÷ $3 million = 8.3
percent.)
2. Calculate your average sales growth over the past three years by total-
ing the growth (or decline) of sales over each of the past three years
and then dividing that number by three.

For example, if you experienced 5 percent sales growth three years ago,
5 percent sales growth two years ago, and 8 percent growth last year,
your three-year average growth rate is 6 percent ([5 + 5 + 8] ÷ 3 = 6).
3. Indicate if extraneous circumstances factored into the growth or
decline of any of the past three years.
For example, if your business underwent a significant remodel that
resulted in fewer customers and lower sales over a one-year period, 
note that factor and explain how the remodel contributed to brand
worth even as it detracted from sales revenue.
4. Indicate if extraneous circumstances will affect the growth of sales
over future years.
For example, if your business projects flat sales for the next few years as
you complete development of a major new product, explain the develop-
ment schedule and how the product launch will propel sales and con-
tribute to brand worth in the near future.
Unless you explain that extraneous circumstances affected your sales growth
in the past, it’s fair for brand evaluators to assume that your average sales
growth over the past three years indicates the sales growth rate you’ll
achieve during the next few years.
Marketing strength
The size, growth rate, and composition of your market arena all affect your
brand equity. Obviously, if the size of your market is decreasing, if consumer
preferences are turning away from your brand attributes, or if new competi-
tors are grabbing large slices of what used to be your market, the worth of
your brand suffers. Measuring brand equity by marketing strength requires
you to address the following questions:
 Is your business arena one that attracts growing or declining market
interest? For instance, the home sewing industry, the ski industry, and
the tennis industry are three arenas that have seen consumer participa-
tion decline over recent years. In contrast, pet ownership, wine con-
sumption, and healthcare usage are all up.
To assess trends in your industry, go to your public or university library
reference area and consult the Lifestyle Market Analyst published by
SRDS and Equifax. The publication presents lifestyle and demographic
information for residents of 210 major U.S. market areas. By obtaining
your market area statistics for current and past years, you can deter-
mine whether your consumer base is growing or declining.
 Is consumer demand for your offering growing or declining? Consult
your own records first. Are your inquiries, your new customer accounts,
and your customer purchase rates increasing or decreasing? Then
258
Part IV: The Care and Feeding of Your Brand 

obtain information from publications that serve your business arena.
Are their subscription and circulation counts on the increase? Does your
business association show increased or decreased activity in your busi-
ness arena? Together, your findings can help you make a case regarding
the strength of consumer demand for your brand’s offerings.
 Is your business arena getting more competitive, and is your brand
faring better or worse in the competitive field? List your top competi-
tors for each of the past three years, along with how you ranked in terms
of sales against each one. Note whether competitors have entered or left
your market arena as well as whether competitors have gained or slipped
in market share against your brand. The degree to which you’re gaining
business from competitors is a good indication of brand strength and
resulting worth.
Brand experience
Your brand experience is the sum of all encounters with your brand, whether
through contacts with you or your staff, your advertising, your Web site, your
telephone answering system, your retail environment, your publicity, and
even the word-of-mouth that circulates about your brand.
Your brand experience is the means by which customers form impressions
about your brand, and as such, it links directly to your brand’s success. To
assess your brand experience, use the worksheets that appear in Chapter 14.
Also consider the following questions:
 Are your brand’s distinguishing attributes clear and consistently 
conveyed?
 Are the benefits your brand promises ones of increasing value to your
consumers?
 Does your brand convey and keep its brand promise at every point of
contact, whether with employees, suppliers, prospects, consumers, sup-
pliers, investors, shareholders, or any other stakeholder group?
Brand value
To assess your brand value as a contributor to your brand equity, use the
worksheet shown earlier in Figure 15-1 and give thought to the following
questions. As you arrive at answers, realize that positive responses indicate
that your brand value is strong; a mixed-bag set of responses indicates that
your brand value is at risk; a lineup of “no” answers indicates that your brand
needs serious repair in order to restore its value.
 Is your customer base growing?
 Is your customer retention rate increasing? (Conversely, is your cus-
tomer attrition rate rising?)
259
Chapter 15: Valuing Your Brand

 Is your brand awareness level increasing? When prospective customers
are asked to name the top few brands that come to mind in your busi-
ness arena, how many cite your name, and has that number grown or
declined over recent years?
 Is your brand’s mindshare increasing? When prospective customers are
asked to name the top brand that comes to mind in your market arena,
how many cite your name, and has that number grown or declined over
recent years?
 Is your average sale price increasing?
The degree to which consumers are willing to pay a premium for your
offering is often viewed as a primary indicator of your brand’s equity.
Calculating your brand equity
Brands are worth money. As proof, John Stuart, one of the 20th century’s
great business leaders and a former CEO of the Quaker Oats Company, is
widely quoted as saying, “If this business were split up, I would give you the
land and bricks and mortar, and I would take the brands and trademarks, and
I would fare better than you.”
To figure out the equity of your brand so that you know the worth of the
asset you’re building, protecting, and leveraging or so that you understand
your brand’s possible sale price, use either or both of these two approaches:
 Assess the costs involved to establish or replace your brand.
 Assess the economic worth of your brand based on its market share
advantage, price premium advantage, cost of sale advantages, and 
reputation.
Figuring out the cost of establishing or replacing your brand
One approach to estimating your brand’s worth is to figure out what it would
cost if you were to create your brand today or if the organization seeking to
purchase your brand were to try to build your brand from scratch.
In assessing your brand from this angle, take the following into account:
 The cost of creating your brand identity, including:
• Name development and registration
• Logo development and trademarking
• Slogan development and trademarking
260
Part IV: The Care and Feeding of Your Brand 

• Domain name registration and Web presence
• Development of other brand-identifying elements such as a unique
and widely accepted color scheme, an olfactory signature or scent,
a musical signature, and any other element that contributes to
what your market understands to be the identity of your brand
 The cost to achieve your current level of market awareness, including
what it would cost in advertising, promotion, and publicity to achieve
knowledge of your brand name, to establish your brand message and
brand promise, and to gain awareness of your brand benefits and 
distinctions
 The cost to build and retain your current clientele, including advertis-
ing, promotions, relationship development, and implementation of loy-
alty programs necessary to attract your customer corps and develop the
kind of customer retention and passion that leads to your current levels
of repeat purchases and positive word-of-mouth
Determining the economic value of your 
brand’s premium market position
When businesses get ready to sell brands, often they begin by calculating the
dollars-and-cents economic advantage of the brand. You can assess your own
economic advantage by watching two indicators:
 Price elasticity: When your consumer demand remains high even when
your prices go up, your brand enjoys pricing leeway known as favorable
price elasticity. Price elasticity usually results from high brand value and
usually leads to premium pricing.
 Premium pricing: To assess your brand’s pricing advantage, determine
how much extra consumers are willing to pay in order to purchase your
branded product instead of the offering of a lesser-known or lesser-
valued brand. This difference, multiplied by your sales volume, defines
the economic value of your premium market position.
In other words, high brand value leads to favorable price elasticity, favorable
price elasticity leads to premium pricing, and premium pricing leads to brand
equity.
To calculate the worth of your brand’s premium pricing position, conduct a
calculation following this formula:
1. Find the price difference between your offering and generic offerings
or offerings from lesser-known or less-respected brands.
For example, if a six-partner accounting firm sells time for $100 an hour
and average rates in the firm’s market area are $85, the accountants’
261
Chapter 15: Valuing Your Brand

price premium equals $15. Or if a bottled water product sells for $2.29
and competing, nonbranded products or products with lesser brands
sell for $1.99, the branded water’s price premium is $.30.
2. Multiply the price difference by the number of units sold.
If the six-partner accounting firm sells a total of 10,000 partner hours a
year, its annual price premium equals $150,000 (100,000 hours × $15
price premium). If the bottled water producer sells 600,000 bottles a
year, its annual price premium equals $180,000 (600,000 bottles × $.30
price premium).
3. Adjust your result to account for future brand performance projections.
These projections include the likelihood that customers will continue 
to behave in a similar manner in the future; that the brand’s current 
economic reality is transferable to new owners; and that the brand’s
momentum will continue at its current pace. For example, if a service
business commands premium pricing in large part due to the powerful
reputation of the owner, and if the owner wants to sell the brand and
depart the business, then the value of the price premium would likely 
be discounted by those considering a purchase of the brand.
When calculating the worth of a brand’s premium price position, be aware
that the number you arrive at is a valuation starting point, not the finishing
line. The effect of future brand-building activities, market growth or retrac-
tion trends, actions of competitors, and other market realities need to be
weighed on an individual basis to determine whether the value of the price
premium should be adjusted upward or downward in assessing the brand’s
worth.
When you need a pro: Identifying 
evaluation experts
If you’re thinking about selling your brand, a good first step is to follow the
advice in the preceding section so that you have a sense of what you believe
to be your brand’s worth. From there, you may have enough information to
begin sale negotiations for a smaller brand, but for larger brands, it’s worth it
to call on professional assistance.
Evaluating the worth of a brand is both an art and a science. To obtain expert
assistance, do the following:

Getting out what you’ve put in: 
Leveraging your brand equity
Leveraging your brand’s equity is like boosting
your next business opportunity with a loan from
your own strong reputation.
When you have a strong brand, you’re in a great
position to take the credibility you’ve established
over the years and apply it to the launch of a 
new or related product or business — with 
instantaneous recognition thanks to the reservoir
of good will and trust that resides in your brand
name.
Most leveraging opportunities take the form of
 Brand extensions, which extend the power
of an established brand name to a new but
related business or product line
 Line extensions, which add variety to the
offerings of an established brand by
extending the brand to new but closely
related products
 Licensing, which essentially rents or
leases your brand to another company that
pays all expenses to produce and market a
product that carries the licensed brand
identity in return for a licensing fee and roy-
alties on wholesale revenues
 Cobranding, which capitalizes on the
mutual benefits of your brand and the brand
of a promotional partner
Regardless of the approach you take, leverag-
ing your brand into new opportunities requires
some careful planning and cautious implemen-
tation. We dedicate a full chapter to the best
advice to embrace and the worst landmines to
avoid in this area. Turn to Chapter 16 for lever-
aging advice.

Protecting Your Brand Equity
For as long as you own your brand, you must consistently protect its value,
following the same marketing approach you used to build the brand’s equity
in the first place.
Chapter 9 includes advice for planning your brand launch marketing plan,
including how to set strategies for each of the four Ps in the marketing mix:
product, pricing, promotion, and place (or distribution). As you build and
protect your brand, regularly update your brand marketing plan, always mon-
itoring these four strategic areas to be sure that all brand marketing deci-
sions are consistent with your brand position, promise, and image.
 Product: If you adopt new product lines or make product adjustments,
be sure they match your brand image and market position.
 Pricing: Be sure that all pricing decisions align with your brand’s market
position and image. Discounting is a popular way to win quick sales in
today’s cost-conscious market environment, but if your market position
is that of the high-end, elite brand, a discounting strategy may be the
equivalent of shooting your brand in the foot.
 Promotion: Be sure all promotions are consistent with your brand iden-
tity. As brands mature, too often leaders loosen their grip, turning brand
management over to those with less passion or understanding. The
result is costly, brand-eroding diversion from the brand image and
promise.
 Place: As you enhance your distribution — the way you get your prod-
uct to your market — be sure that you select only those channels that
support your brand identity. Too many high-end brands have suffered
by cutting distribution deals with warehouse outlets only to later receive
the cold shoulder from the boutique retailers with whom they’d built
their reputations and clientele.
As if that weren’t a long enough to-do list, there’s one more “P” to consider,
and that’s people — the employees who power your brand experience. Turn
to Chapter 13 for plenty of advice on how to build brand spirit within your
organization and how to achieve brand delivery excellence by developing a
team of enthusiastic, knowledgeable, and passionate brand champions.

 Reaping the rewards of licensing
O
f the tens of thousands of new products that enter the retail arena each
year, most never become success stories. That’s the bad news. The
good news is that most of those that “make it” — those that beat the dire
product start-up odds — have something in common that, as a brand owner,
you can leverage to your advantage.
The common trait shared by most successful new products is that they ride
into the market on the magic carpet of a known name. That’s why most best-
selling new books are by known authors, and most top-selling new music
releases are by known artists. Most successful new products either carry 
the names of known brands or are fueled by the powerful endorsements of
known authorities or personalities. By gliding into the market on the current
of an established brand, a new product debuts with the advantage of instant
credibility, a strength that’s basically borrowed from a brand name and repu-
tation that may have taken years, decades, or even longer to build.
Leveraging a brand name is lucrative as long as you avoid a good many danger
zones. If your new product doesn’t align with your brand message and promise,
or if it doesn’t build on the emotional connection you’ve established with
your customers, you can actually hurt your brand in the process of trying to
help your new product.
Before sharing your trusted reputation with a new offering, use this chapter
to help you seize opportunities without damaging the power of your brand
name and reputation in the process.

Planning for Product Innovations
Most businesses increase revenue in one of two ways: by selling more of their
established products or by introducing and selling new products.
Figure 16-1 illustrates the opportunities you can pursue as you aim to
increase purchases by current customers and to attract new customers 
into your business.
Product innovations range from minor revisions all the way to brand-new
product introductions. Most product announcements fit into one of the fol-
lowing categories:
 Brand extension: When you introduce a new product or product line
that supports your core brand message and promise while taking your
brand outside its initial category, it’s called a brand extension. A few
examples include Starbucks Coffee Liqueur, Woolite Carpet Cleaner, and
Emerilware Cookware and Cutlery.
 Line extension: When you introduce a variation of your existing product
or service that features the same characteristics and primary benefit of
your established offering but with a new secondary benefit, it’s called a
line extension. A few examples include Diet Coke, Crest Extra Whitening
Toothpaste, and Dove Sensitive Skin Body Wash.
 Repositioning: When you present your established product in a way
that causes consumers to think of it differently, expanding or altering its
potential market as a result, it’s called repositioning. A few examples
include Arm & Hammer Baking Soda as a cleaning and deodorizing solu-
tion and St. Joseph Aspirin as a cardiac health treatment.

 Revitalization: When you make anything from a moderate to a radical
product change to address evolving market realities with new packaging,
benefits, pricing, or distribution, it’s called revitalizing. A few examples
include Kool-Aid Singles packets for making single servings of Kool-Aid
and H&R Block TaxCut Online and Software for do-it-yourself tax prepa-
ration. (See Chapter 17 for complete information on revitalizing your
brand and offering.)
 Product launch: Introducing an all-new product is called a product
launch. Examples are everywhere, including new cars, new software, new
restaurants, new sports gear, new grocery items, new music devices, and
a near-endless list of other new offerings. Some new products enter the
market as new brand launches, following all the brand-building steps in
this book. Others take a profitable shortcut by entering the market as
brand extensions or line extensions, riding in on the strength of an exist-
ing brand name.
As you leverage your brand, realize that you’re working with a very valuable
asset. In some ways, extending your brand is like taking out a home equity loan
to underwrite a new investment. It’s a great idea as long as the new venture
you’re funding doesn’t shake the stability of your established asset. Before dip-
ping into the reservoir of goodwill that you’ve established with your name,
look long and hard at the new product opportunity you’re considering.
Tiptoeing into the Brand Extension Arena
Most brands loan the value of their names to new offerings in one of two ways:
 Line extensions stretch the brand name to cover a new offering with
new and different consumer benefits in the brand’s current product
category.
 Brand extensions stretch the brand name to new product categories,
usually in one of three ways:
• By entering a new price or quality category in the same general
product arena (such as a car company offering a new brand)
• By entering a new but adjacent product category (such as Crest
toothpaste moving into Crest toothbrushes)
• By entering a completely new category (such as Nike introducing
sunglasses)
Both forms of leverage — brand extensions and line extensions — come with
some common advantages and risks.
267
Chapter 16: Leveraging Brand Value with Brand Extensions and Licensing

 On the plus side:
• The new offering enjoys faster market acceptance at far lower pro-
motional costs than would be required if the product were to enter
the market with a name consumers have never heard of.
• The extension allows the brand to reach current and new cus-
tomers with a new offering and therefore increases the chance for
new sales revenue.
• Announcement of the new product allows the brand to strengthen
and renew its brand message and promise in the marketplace.
 On the minus side:
• If the new product doesn’t match up with the brand’s position and
promise, it can confuse consumers and shake their confidence in
the brand.
• If the nature of the new product causes the brand to drift from the
brand’s core message, the new product can dilute the brand’s
strength and reduce brand loyalty and passion at the same time.
When extending your brand, the safest bet is to stay in your same product
category or to stretch only so far as a complementary category. For example,
a window manufacturer may safely extend its brand to screens and awnings.
Extending your name to a distant product category is the equivalent of
making a loan to a risky venture, and any good banker will tell you that
there’s a reason why loan requests for risky ventures are routinely declined.
When the profile of the applicant doesn’t match the risk of the request, a
bank loan officer simply says “no.” When it comes to brand extensions, 
sometimes brand managers need to issue the same response.
If you see an opportunity to extend your brand into an altogether new cate-
gory, proceed with caution, making certain that your brand promise still
makes perfect sense in the new market arena. The section “Putting your
extension idea through the hoops” later in this chapter helps you cull 
good ideas from brand-damaging ones.
Avoiding line extension traps
Of the thousands of new products introduced each year, more than half are
line extensions that carry the name and all the characteristics of an estab-
lished brand while offering a distinct new advantage to the market.
When you extend your line, you seize a number of opportunities.
268
Part IV: The Care and Feeding of Your Brand 

 You capture a greater share of your current customer’s billfold by giving
that person more reasons to buy from your business.
 You attract new customers by offering a new benefit and purchase incen-
tive. For instance, adding a low-fat version of your product suddenly
allows you to attract weight-conscious prospects. Or offering single-
sized portions allows you to serve one-person households and also gain
trial usage by those not willing to make larger-quantity purchases.
 In the retail arena, you expand brand presence by creating the need for
more shelf space.
 Internally, you wring more profitability out of existing marketing and
production investments.
Offsetting the upsides of line extensions are some major pitfalls to avoid.
 If the new product doesn’t live up to brand expectations in terms of
quality, market position, consumer preference, or brand promise, it
erodes brand confidence in a hurry. Remember New Coke?
 If the new product extends your line to a mind-boggling and indistinct
assortment, consumers can become confused, which leads to selection
dilemmas that result in no purchase at all.
 If consumers view the new offering as an improvement of an existing
product in your line, they may purchase the new offering at the expense
of the established offering (called product cannibalization).
 If those inside your company aren’t clear about the distinct attributes
and target market for the new offering, or if they feel the new offering
cannibalizes existing offerings, uncertainty and competition may result
among the very people who should be championing your products.
Before extending your product line, answer the questions in Figure 16-2.
Often, brands introduce line extensions as reactions to moves by key com-
petitors. For instance, over a short time period, Honda extended its line to
include Acura, Toyota extended its line to include Lexus, and Nissan
extended its line to include Infiniti. Each worked to protect its share of
market by countering an extension move by the other. If your competitive
arena prompts a similar extension by your business, don’t proceed until you
answer the questions in Figure 16-2. Otherwise, you may risk protecting
market share at the expense of your brand image or your business strength.
269
Chapter 16: Leveraging Brand Value with Brand Extensions and Licensing

Look before leaping into brand extensions
Leveraging your brand into new market categories is one of the most valued
perks of brand development. It allows you to take the reputation and credibility
you’ve built over time and apply it to new ventures that benefit from instant
awareness and competitive advantage.
LINE EXTENSION QUESTIONS TO ADDRESS
Why are you introducing a new product? What new benefits will the product offer?
Is the new product clearly related to your other offerings? Will customers quickly and 
clearly see both the relationship and the distinct differences?
How are the benefits of the new product distinctly different from the benefits of your 
current product or products? 
Are the benefits of the new product ones that are meaningful and needed by current 
and prospective customers?
Does your business have the financial and human resources necessary to create, 
produce, introduce, and market the new product without harming the strength of your 
established products?
Will the new product add enough new sales to offset any decreases in sales from existing 
products that may occur when customers shift purchases to the new offering?
Does the new product closely match the benefits of a competitor’s established offering? 
If so, how will your product distinguish itself and win the purchase decision from existing 
and prospective customers? 
Will the new product extend your line to the point that it becomes too long or confusing for 
customers to understand?
Is the new product completely consistent with your brand position (see Chapter 5) and 
your brand promise and identity (see Chapter 7)?

In many ways, an established brand is like a magic wand for new product
introductions. But (there’s always a hitch when something seems almost too
good to be true) if you haven’t done your homework, extending your brand
name into a new category can be a dangerous roll of the dice.

www.brandchannel.com, enter “top brand extensions” into the search box,
and scroll down the results to access the brand paper entitled “Top Brand
Extensions.” It contains the results of an annual survey of top brand exten-
sions conducted by New York brand consultant TippingSprung, in collabora-
tion with BrandWeek magazine. The brand extension winners in 2005 were as
follows:
 Best overall extension: Iams pet insurance
Iams is a company whose mission is “to enhance the well being of dogs
and cats by providing world-class quality foods and pet care products.”
Moving into the pet insurance category is a logical, believable extension
of the promise its customers already trust.
 Best in the liquor category: Starbucks coffee liqueur
The Starbucks mission is to be “the premier purveyor of the finest coffee
in the world.” Extending the Starbucks label to liqueur, in partnership
with whisky maker Jim Beam, is a strong cobranding opportunity (there’s
more on this topic later in the chapter). It’s also an innovative way to
increase purchases from existing customers, who consume coffee
liqueurs at a rate far higher than the general public.
 Best in the magazine category: Hardcover books from O, The Oprah
Magazine
This extension makes double sense. First, it spreads the Oprah commit-
ment to reading from the popular Oprah Book Club to a published line of
books. Second, the books are tied to material from O Magazine.
 Best “overdue” brand extension: Tide to Go stain removal pen
This extension repackages Tide to meet unaddressed consumer needs
for a portable stain solution. It also expands the market by moving the
use of Tide out of the laundry room and into the office, car, or anywhere
else that people on the go find themselves.
 Best furniture brand extension: Antiques Roadshow furniture by Pulaski
Furniture
This cobranded extension fits well with the attributes, markets, and
messages of both brands. The new line features 60 pieces inspired by
significant discoveries on the popular PBS program Antiques Roadshow.

 Best not-for-profit brand extension: National Geographic’s partnership
with GoogleEarth to offer maps with content from National Geographic
 Worst brand extension: Harley-Davidson cake decorating kits. (In the
2004 survey, this award went to Hooters Air airline.)
What works? What doesn’t?
Marketing graveyards are filled with brand extension failures. At the same
time, business publications are filled with headlines heralding brand exten-
sion successes. In all cases, the new products started with good ideas, but
from there, the paths went in vastly different directions.
In three steps, here’s how you can steer your extension away from disaster
and toward success:
1. Make certain that there’s a real market opportunity for your new
offering.
Turn to Chapter 4 for advice on how to conduct market research. Then
turn to Chapter 5 for help finding and seizing a market position for your
offering.
2. Make certain that your business has the staff, production, and finan-
cial resources necessary to support the new product without sacrific-
ing the strength of existing offerings.
3. Make certain that your brand message and promise both extend to the
new offering.
If the new offering isn’t in complete alignment with the brand image held
by those who know your brand, both your new product and your brand
will suffer.
The illustration in Figure 16-3 comes courtesy of Prophet, a global brand con-
sultancy specializing in branding and marketing. It shows how market oppor-
tunities, organizational capabilities, and brand relevance must converge to
create a “sweet spot” for your brand extension.
As you consider brand extensions and look for your brand sweet spot,
answer these questions:
 Do you see unaddressed market opportunities that your business is
organizationally suited to seize?
As an example, if a restaurant sees market opportunity based on unmet
consumer desire for home-delivered meals and has the staff and trans-
portation capability to address the need, then the business is two-thirds
of the way toward capitalizing on a brand extension sweet spot. All that’s
272
Part IV: The Care and Feeding of Your Brand 

left is to be absolutely certain that the restaurant’s brand and the
promise for which it’s known will extend to a home-delivered product. If
so, all lights are green. If not, the restaurant is better off introducing a
new brand to address the market opportunity rather than risking dilution
or misdirection of its current brand image.
 Do you see unaddressed market opportunities that fit ideally with
your brand image and promise?
For example, if a restaurant’s patrons have an unmet need for home-
delivered meals and the restaurant’s brand image fits well with a home-
delivered product, then the brand is two-thirds of its way to extension —
pending determination that the restaurant has the organizational capa-
bility to succeed in the home-delivery arena. If the business doesn’t
have adequate staff or appropriate and available vehicles for transport-
ing meals, then it needs to assess whether the business opportunity is
great enough to offset the costs of retooling operationally in order to
make the new venture a success.
 Do you see areas where your brand image and organizational capabil-
ities converge to create a new product offering?
For example, if a restaurant has a fleet of vehicles that it uses to serve busi-
ness clients with catered meals and a brand image for outstanding meals-to-
go, then it has two of the three ingredients necessary for a home-delivery
product extension. The missing element is market opportunity. The restau-
rant needs to determine that there’s adequate unmet demand for home-
delivered meals. If residents in the market area desire home-delivered
meals, if they have the economic means to purchase the offering, and if
home-delivery competitors haven’t already seized the opportunity, then 
the restaurant is on its way to a successful brand extension.

Chapter 16: Leveraging Brand Value with Brand Extensions and Licensing

Don’t ask your brand to stretch too far
When brand extensions fail, the downfall rarely stems from a lack of organiza-
tional ability or market opportunity. Most businesses stop themselves before
stretching the ability of their staffs, production facilities, or management
capability. And most businesses make sure that sufficient market potential
exists before launching new products.
Most brand extension disasters occur when businesses try to stretch their
brand identities into distant product categories where they lack relevance. In
doing so, they basically expect the brand’s followers to follow the brand via a
giant leap of faith. They assume that the consumer’s belief in the brand as a
preferred solution in product category A will translate into consumer trust in
product categories B, C, and even X, Y, and Z.
Expecting your brand to stretch easily from category A to adjacent categories
B and C may be reasonable. For example, asking consumers to believe that
Oprah’s magazine is a good launching pad for a hardcover book series makes
sense. Longer stretches, however, get problematic. Remember when high-
powered celebrities launched the Planet Hollywood restaurant chain? The
effort required consumers to trust that great actors would be great restaura-
teurs. Shuttered restaurant sites tell the rest of the story.
Putting your extension idea through the hoops
Before proceeding with a brand extension, test the relevance of your brand to
the new category by putting it through the process illustrated in Figure 16-4.
274
Part IV: The Care and Feeding of Your Brand 
How elastic is your brand?
Brand elasticity is a term that describes a brand’s
capability to stretch into new product arenas
without compromising the image or promise of
what the brand offers in its market. A good exam-
ple of a brand that successfully tested its elas-
ticity is Dole, which for years was marketed as a
brand for pineapples. Then research showed
that consumers linked Dole to the broader con-
cept of sunshine. Aha! Dole revitalized its brand
(see Chapter 17) to stand for high-quality fresh
fruit, vegetables, and other foods and extended
its offerings beyond pineapple to a wide range of
products including sorbet, nuts, premium juices,
and other offerings.
At the other end of the elasticity spectrum is
Disney, which is so thoroughly perceived as a
brand that represents family entertainment that
it couldn’t stretch into movies for mature audi-
ences without creating confusion and conflicts
in consumers’ minds. That’s why you see a
second Disney brand — Touchstone Films — on
movies that consumers may find too far outside
the family entertainment category that they link
to the Disney brand.

Submerging subbrands, once and for all
A subbrand is a brand that’s closely tied to a
parent brand but that has its own identity and
values in an effort to distinguish it from the
attributes of top-level brand. If that definition
confuses you, imagine what the concept of a
subbrand does to the consumer!
Often a brand introduces a subbrand as a way
to offer a lower-priced line without harming the
esteem of the top-level brand; Four Points by
Sheraton and United Airline’s Ted are examples
of subbrands.
Coauthor Bill Chiaravalle tells his Brand
Navigation clients to consider subbrands a
giant marketing taboo.
For one thing, brands (whether top-level brands
or subbrands) need esteem to succeed, and
you’ll never build esteem out of an identity that
begins as subordinate to something else. For
another thing, subbrands confuse consumers
and weaken brand management.
Bill goes so far as to say that there’s really no
such thing as a subbrand, at least not in the
consumer’s mind, which is where brands live.
To the consumer, a brand is a brand, not a
subset of a brand. As a brand manager, you
should look at it the same way.
Bill’s adamant stance is reinforced by plenty of
other brand gurus. James Burgin and Jon
Ward, coauthors of Branding For Profit (Trump
University Press), put it this way: “When it
comes to brands, the consumer can only count
to one.” That doesn’t mean the consumer isn’t
smart, but it makes a point about how the brain
works. In today’s overloaded marketing envi-
ronment, the human mind can only take in and
remember so much. As a result, the consumer
can only handle one brand at a time.
For example, the consumer sees Diet Coke
either as its own brand or as a flavor variety of
the Coke brand, not as a subbrand of Coke.
Likewise, consumers see Jetta and Passat
either as their own brands or as flavors of VW.
The consumer keeps it simple, and as a brand
manager, you should, too. When developing the
branding strategy for a new product, rather
than creating some second-cousin-once-
removed relationship, ask “Does this product fit
best as a flavor or variation of our established
brand? Or does it have a unique enough set of
attributes, or fit into a unique enough product
category, that it should live under its own
brand?” In any case, consider “subbrand” the
wrong answer.

Cobranding: Brand Value × 2
Cobrands capitalize on the benefits of two compatible brands that present
similarly desirable attributes to consumers. In the offing, both brands stand
to benefit from a number of advantages that come out of the synergy as long
as they manage to avoid a few dangers.
Potential advantages of cobranding are that
 Both brands benefit from the opportunity to appeal to a greater cus-
tomer base than either may be able to reach on its own.
 Each brand stands to enhance its esteem by borrowing on the strength
of the partner brand.
 The brands share marketing costs, resulting in cost savings for each.
 Each brand benefits from the perceived endorsement of the other.
Potential dangers of cobranding are that
 Brand management is complicated by the need to integrate the separate
operating systems and management approaches of each brand.
 The cobranded offering can confuse consumers unless the link between
the two brands is immediately obvious, sensible, and easy to understand.
 One brand can be diminished in stature if consumers consider the part-
ner brand to be an incompatible match.
Uniting brands with like visions, 
values, and budgets
In the most effective cobranding opportunities, the two brands share the fol-
lowing characteristics:
 Both brands have distinctive and compatible attributes.
 Both brands share complementary brand images in terms of quality and
brand character.
 Both brands serve markets with similar customer profiles.
 Both brands share market prominence as well as similar values and
beliefs.
276
Part IV: The Care and Feeding of Your Brand 

Cobranding efforts cover a broad range. They may involve strategic alliances
in which two brands unite to reach common goals or cobranded promotions
in which two brands team up to achieve short-term sales objectives. Efforts
may also involve cobranded product introductions in which two brands bring
their production and marketing efforts together to achieve a greater market
impact than either could achieve alone.
Recent and prominent examples of cobranded product introductions include
the Coach Edition of Lexus, the Eddie Bauer Edition of Ford Explorer, and the
Motorola ROKR iPod Phone, to name just a few. In each case, the cobranded
products leverage the esteem and attributes of each brand through a partner-
ship that’s clearly a good fit in consumers’ minds because the brand partners
both appeal to similar markets, offer similar quality, and represent similar
benefits.
Cobranding checklist
Before joining up with another brand, be sure you can answer a strong “yes”
to each of these questions:
 Are your brands compatible without directly competing with each
other?
 Do your brands appeal to the same or very similar customers?
 Will both brands enhance their reputations through the cobranding
partnership?
 Do customers, media, investors, and other members of the public
equally respect both brands?
 Are the management and marketing styles of both brand owners 
compatible?
 Do you trust each other?
 Are all the details down on paper and signed by both parties, including
the cobranding marketing plan, budget, timeline, and responsibilities?
 Can you explain the cobranded product or promotion in a sentence that
will make sense to your employees, customers, and others? Are both
brands explaining it in exactly the same way?
277
Chapter 16: Leveraging Brand Value with Brand Extensions and Licensing

Brand Licensing
Brand licensing is one of the most widely used ways to extend a brand, largely
because it allows a brand to achieve new product introductions without gear-
ing up operationally for the task. Instead, the brand licenses its name to a
manufacturer that takes on all the production and marketing efforts of the
new product.
When you license your brand, basically you rent your legally protected brand
identity to another business that will manufacture and sell products that
carry your name.
To the consumer, licensed products look just like line extensions, brand
extensions, or cobranded products. So before you consider a license agree-
ment, be sure that the agreement will result in products that meet all the
brand characteristics and that avoid all the brand-damaging landmines
detailed in the preceding sections of this chapter.
Understanding licensing lingo
Brand licensing comes with its own language. The terms you hear most
include the following:
 Licensing: Leasing a trademarked or copyrighted brand identity, includ-
ing brand name, logo, tagline, or any other form of brand signature, to
another business, usually for use on a product or product line
 Licensor: The owner of the brand and the renter of the rights
 Licensee: The business renting rights to use the brand identity
 Contractual agreement: The formal permission document that defines
how the licensee may use the brand and how the licensor will be paid
The contract should include specific usage purposes, limitations on
applications, geographic area, time period, payment schedule, and terms.
Rely on an attorney to draw up and review the agreement, and obtain
formal signatures. Handshakes are great, but only after the ink is dry.
 Royalty: A percentage of the licensee’s wholesale revenue (often set at
or near 5 percent), which is paid to the licensor in exchange for the
rights to use the brand. In most contracts, the licensee agrees to pay the
licensor a guaranteed minimum royalty payment plus a royalty on all
sales that exceed the minimum payment amount.
278
Part IV: The Care and Feeding of Your Brand 

Benefits of licensing
In a good licensing agreement, both parties benefit. The licensor gains the
benefit of a brand extension and related marketplace presence and sales rev-
enue (via royalties) without any investment in product development, produc-
tion, or marketing. To the brand owner and licensor, licensing is a no-cost
form of brand value leverage.
The licensee gains the benefit of the licensor’s brand name, which lends
immediate awareness, distinction, and trust to the manufacturer’s product
rollout. Without the need for any brand development investment, the licensor
is able to achieve marketplace dominance and command a premium sales
price thanks to the lease of the licensor’s brand name.
Licensing steps to follow
Most license agreements result in what looks to the consumer like either a
brand produced product or a cobranded product. For instance, Disney
licenses its name to Timex, and Timex makes watches featuring Mickey
Mouse. The consumer thinks the two teamed up to make the watch possible,
and they did, although it was likely through a licensing agreement rather than
through a manufacturing and marketing partnership.
How your branded product gets to market is a behind-the-scenes issue that’s
invisible to consumers. The consumer simply sees the product, links it to your
name, and decides whether the product enhances or diminishes your brand
image. (The sections “Don’t ask your brand to stretch too far” and “Putting
your extension idea through the hoops” earlier in this chapter help you evalu-
ate the match between licensing opportunities and your brand image.)
The most important step to follow in brand licensing, therefore, is to give
licensed offerings the same level of consideration and scrutiny that you give
any other brand or line extension.
Additionally, you should follow these necessary steps:
1. Build, protect, and manage a strong and highly esteemed brand.
Otherwise, few if any licensees will find your name worth the lease price.
2. Establish licensing guidelines, including how far you’ll allow your
brand to range — in terms of product categories, price range, and dis-
tribution channels — through licensed products.
279
Chapter 16: Leveraging Brand Value with Brand Extensions and Licensing

3. License only to well-managed, well-respected, and well-financed 
companies.
4. Limit licensing partners to one or only a few in each product category
or geographic area.
5. Implement a comprehensive licensee training program to ensure 
that all licensed products are developed and marketed to your brand
standards.
Most licensee training programs begin with education that immerses
licensees in the brand image and the brand’s usage guidelines. They also
include presentation of the steps that licensees must take in order to
gain approval of marketing communications, packaging, products, and
any materials that carry the brand identity.
6. Monitor and protect the way your brand is presented via licensed
products in the same way you protect its usage within your own 
organization.
Be vigilant regarding misuse of your brand identity or infringements on
your license. Turn to Chapters 8 and 18 for help.

Revitalizing Your Brand
In This Chapter
 Evaluating your need for a brand update
 Aligning your brand to current times and market conditions
 Launching your revitalized brand
A
s you open to this chapter, the word “rebranding” is probably on your
mind, but chances are good that “revitalizing” better explains the brand
revision you’re looking for.
Rebranding is a catchall term that marketers use when they talk about updat-
ing their brand identities and reputations. Especially when business is down
or competition is up, the idea of rebranding arises along with hope that a new
logo, a new slogan, and maybe even a new name will be the magic pill for an
image turnaround.
In fact, few brand owners really need or want a total brand overhaul. Complete
rebranding involves basically erasing your current brand identity (along with
much of the considerable value that goes with it) and starting the brand devel-
opment process all over again, following all the steps explained in this book.
Sometimes rebranding is in order (like following a major acquisition, a merger,
or a major change in business direction). More often, though, instead of
rebranding, marketers need to revitalize their brands by updating their iden-
tities to make them more contemporary, more competitive, and a clearer
reflection of the businesses they represent.
This chapter helps you to determine what kind of a brand revision you need
and how far you want your identity update to go. Then it helps you plan the
steps involved to make the changes you have in mind while protecting the
brand value you’ve built to date.

Brands Grow Old, Too
Some brands age gracefully, gaining stature, esteem, and strength in the
process. Others show their years in less distinguished ways, becoming out-of-
step, a little dowdy, and no longer able to command the interest of those they
most need to inspire — whether that means consumers, investors, employ-
ees, or other brand supporters.
With attention, many brands come back to life quickly. Some require only
cosmetic attention — ranging from a design nip and tuck to a full brand
facelift — along with some message and marketing realignment. Others need
to be resuscitated with heroic rebranding efforts. Still others need to be put
on life support while their owners prepare for their graceful departure from
the big, branded world.
As evidenced by the fact that most brands never see their fifth birthdays but
others live well into the second century of life, there’s no timetable to rely on
as you try to plot your brand’s growth curve.
What you can count on, however, is that sooner or later your brand will go
through all or most of the life-cycle stages illustrated in Figure 17-1.
Spotting brand aging signs
Times change, businesses change, consumer interests change, culture
changes, and sometimes brands need to change, too. To evaluate whether
your brand may be in need of an update, ask the questions listed in this sec-
tion on an annual basis, at the very least.
If you answer “yes” to a number of these questions during your annual brand
review, you definitely need to take action and follow the steps detailed in the
rest of this chapter.

Part IV: The Care and Feeding of Your Brand 

Has your business changed dramatically?
Most rebranding or brand revitalizing is triggered by internal business changes.
When the nature of your business changes, the nature of your brand changes,
and realignment becomes necessary. To determine whether your situation
merits branding attention, ask these questions:
 Have ownership or leadership changes led to a new company culture? If
so, does your brand identity still accurately reflect your company mis-
sion, vision, and values?
 Has your product line changed, or are you about to add products that
will dramatically alter your offerings? If so, does your brand promise still
apply to every product and service you offer or plan to offer?
 Have you changed your distribution channels (how and where you offer
your products)? If so, does your brand identity represent you well in all
channels, particularly online?
Has your market changed dramatically?
The next most frequent reason for brand realignment is a changing market
environment. To assess whether your market is eclipsing your brand
strength, ask these questions:
 Are you facing new or stronger competition? If so, how well do your
brand identity, promise, and experience stand up to the challenge?
 Have new market solutions or customer preferences caused consumers
to lose or lessen their interest in your brand attributes or promise? If so,
can your brand offerings be realigned to market tastes?
 Has your brand message and experience become out of synch with cur-
rent consumer interests and tastes? If so, can you update your experi-
ence to make it compelling and competitive?
 Is your brand identity — your logo, tagline, and other identifying 
elements — out of step with current design and cultural trends? If so,
can you update your identity while retaining the elements that carry the
most brand value?
Brand change-of-life warning signals
When your organization (the heart and soul of your brand) undergoes major
change, most often your brand identity (the face of your brand) needs to
undergo change as well. Otherwise, the core of your organization is out of
alignment with the promise you make to your market, and a brand credibility
crisis is likely to follow.
283
Chapter 17: Revitalizing Your Brand

Likewise, when your market (the reason for your brand’s being) undergoes
major change, your brand identity probably needs to change, too. Otherwise
your image is out of synch with market needs, tastes, and desires, and a
brand relevance crisis follows.
To avoid a brand disaster, frequently scan your business situation for four early
warning signs that the strength of your brand may be at risk. The signs are
 Rapid business expansion
 Major product or channel diversification
 A merger or acquisition
 A brand identity that has failed to adapt to your changed business and
market
The upcoming sections describe the symptoms of each of these brand health
red flags. Scan them, and then complete the questionnaire in Figure 17-2 to
assess your brand’s vulnerability.
Rapid expansion
Growth is good, but when it happens to your company too quickly, your
brand can suffer.
In the race to roll out new products, seize new opportunities, open additional
outlets, add new distribution channels, or expand into new market areas,
your business can outgrow your brand identity. Suddenly, your core brand
message is outdated, you can no longer keep your brand promise, and your
brand experience is unpredictable. Even your name and slogan become inap-
propriate fits with the current realities of your business.
If your organization has experienced dramatic growth in the most recent six-
month period, schedule a weekend retreat — and soon — to gather employ-
ees to evaluate whether your brand identity still reflects the character,
values, and attributes of your evolving business situation. Don’t wait until an
identity or credibility crisis sets in. Use the questions in Figure 17-2 as your
assessment guide.
Major product, channel, or strategic diversification
The marketplace is in constant flux. The Internet has basically rewritten the
rules on how businesses communicate, present offerings, and even sell prod-
ucts. At the same time, market territories, even for small businesses, have
expanded almost without limits. Self-employed entrepreneurs in home offices
now serve market areas that literally span the globe.
284
Part IV: The Care and Feeding of Your Brand 

Amidst this change, companies are refocusing or changing strategic 
direction — and brand identities — to adapt to changing business environ-
ments. Among the best examples are businesses that have moved their
bricks-and-mortar businesses online; businesses that have shifted emphasis
to address environmental realities; and companies that have altered their
product lines, distribution approaches, and business strategies in order to
serve global markets.
Questionaire: Is your brand in need of an update?
Is your name still an appropriate label for the business 
you’ve become, the promise you keep, and the markets 
you serve?
Has your organization found it necessary to improvise 
adaptations of  your brand name to make it an 
appropriate label for some of your offerings?
Has your organization found it necessary to use 
alternate versions of your brand name, logo, and tagline 
in certain distribution channels?
If the Internet has become a major distribution channel
for your business and you weren’t able to seize your 
business name as your domain name, are you 
successfully training customers to find you online under 
a different name?
Does your staff understand and embrace the business 
you’ve become? When asked to describe your brand, 
do employees all give nearly identical answers?
Do your customers understand and embrace the 
business you’ve become? Have your best customers 
stayed loyal and enthusiastic as you’ve grown?
Has your brand experience begun to get unpredictable? 
(See Chapter 14 for help evaluating the experience you 
deliver.)
Does your brand identity look dated, with a typestyle, 
ink colors, and graphic design that seem stuck in the 
past?
Does your brand identity match the quality and 
sophistication of the business you’ve become?

Chapter 17: Revitalizing Your Brand

UPS is a good case in point. Over the past decade, UPS shifted its emphasis
from fleets of delivery trucks to teams of global logistics experts. In the
process, the company changed its marketing message, redesigned its logo
and Web site, and developed a new tagline to address the company’s changed
structure and market. As recently as 1993, UPS marketed under the slogan,
“The package delivery company more companies count on.” Today, in the
United States, the company asks, “What can brown do for you?”; globally, UPS
declares, “Deliver more.” Both taglines eliminate references to packages and
shipping, instead opening the consumer’s mind to the company’s expanded
market and capabilities.
BP (British Petroleum) is another good example of a business that restruc-
tured strategically and then realigned its brand accordingly. After multiple
mergers and acquisitions, BP needed to declare that it had become more
than a petroleum company. The company underwent a revolutionary visual
update. To accurately reflect BP’s transformation from “a local oil company
into a global energy group,” BP recast its identity to a “green” leader, even
changing the meaning of “BP” to stand for “beyond petroleum.”
A merger or acquisition
When you hear the word “merger,” most often you’re hearing a euphemism
for the reality that one business has been acquired or taken over by another.
On occasion, two businesses participate as 50-50 partners in a merger, but
even then one company usually emerges as the dominant force.
Whether companies are acquired or merge, their brands rarely blend into
one. Essentially, a brand is an organization’s promise, so in merging two
promises, merged companies rarely end up with a stronger promise. More
often, they end up with a two-pronged promise that confuses consumers and
rattles confidence.
In most corporate acquisitions or mergers, the two organizations assess the
value of each brand and the equity of each brand’s identifying elements
before adopting one of the following brand approaches:
 The acquiring company keeps its name and emerges as the prevailing
brand, sometimes with a revitalized look that reflects the benefits of
the business acquisition. (This is what happens in most cases.)
 The seller’s name prevails. For example, when SBC acquired AT&T, it
chose to adopt the high-value AT&T name and update the identity to
appear more agile and youthful. The changes made included a shift in
color and typestyle and a redesign of the brandmark to more closely
resemble a globe — the market served by the new entity.
286
Part IV: The Care and Feeding of Your Brand 

 The two combining companies merge their names. For example, when
FedEx acquired Kinko’s, it renamed the Kinko’s brand FedEx Kinko’s to
leverage the strength of both companies. Likewise the merger of Price
Waterhouse with Coopers & Lybrand resulted in the new brand name
PricewaterhouseCoopers. And then there’s the Time Warner and AOL
merger that resulted, briefly, in the merged brand name AOL/Time
Warner, which confused consumers and investors alike and eventually
separated into two independent brand names: AOL and Time Warner.
 An altogether new brand emerges with no visible link to either of the
brands represented in the merger or acquisition.
A dated brand identity
In the low-budget start-up days, many businesses resort to brand identities
that are either self-designed or whipped up by an aspiring artist recommended
by the friend of a friend of a cousin of a brother-in-law. The result is usually a
make-do identity created with all the best intentions in the world at a price
that seemed right at the time.
Fast-forward several years, though, and what seemed to work fine in the past
no longer fits. Maybe the design was never quite right. Or maybe it was right
once, but it no longer represents the culture or sophistication of the organiza-
tion or fits the nature of the market it serves or the culture in which it survives.
Some typestyles, colors, and graphic approaches are stuck in eras thankfully
long past. (Think of the colors and style of the 1960s!) When that’s the case,
brand revitalization is in order, and it’s a process you can’t take lightly. Simply
designing a great new brandmark isn’t enough. At the very least, you need to
take the following action:
1. Assess how much you want or need to change your identity.
Brand identity redesigns span the gamut from evolutionary to revolu-
tionary depending on whether they move your current identity forward
a little or a lot and whether they result in an altogether new name and
logo. See Figure 17-3 for examples.
2. Determine which brand identity assets contribute the most value to
your brand so that you know which aspects to protect and carry over
to your revitalized identity.
Turn to Chapter 3 for help with this task.
3. Invest in the counsel and talents of a good brand designer as you
weigh your existing brand strengths and consider your options.
Chapter 11 provides advice for interviewing creative firms, making selec-
tions, and getting design agreements in writing.

Chapter 17: Revitalizing Your Brand

4. Adopt a revitalized brand strategy that can represent your brand
vision for at least ten years, which is about the maximum frequency
that the look of a brand should undergo major change.

Examining Your Brand’s Health
Doctors require X-rays and lists of diagnostic tests before determining health
conditions and issuing prescriptive remedies. Why should brands be any dif-
ferent? Before “fixing” your brand, put it through the same kind of checkup.
1. Start with a brand review, also called a brand audit.
2. Determine how far you want or need your brand revision to go in
terms of changes to your current brand identity.
3. Outline your brand revitalization plan by defining your goals, objec-
tives, strategies, tactics, and measuring sticks.

Part IV: The Care and Feeding of Your Brand 

Conducting a brand review
A brand review takes your brand through many of the same steps you took
when establishing your brand in the first place. (For an overview of the brand
development process, see Chapter 3.)
As you review your brand’s situation, give every one of the questions in this
section the attention it deserves. Your answers will help you pinpoint where
your brand is ailing so you can direct your repair efforts at fixing what’s
broken rather than overhauling brand attributes that are in good condition.
Too often, brands undergo name or logo changes when what they really need
to do is improve their brand experiences, starting with the way their prod-
ucts work. Or a company rebrands — basically throwing the baby out with
the bathwater — when its old brand actually had good value that could have
been revitalized for a whole lot less investment and market confusion. By
answering each of the following questions, you determine which aspects of
your brand are in good condition and which aspects need adjustment in
order to truly reflect the business you’ve become.
What do you want to achieve through your branding program?
Prioritize your goals by selecting from the following brand functions:
 Create greater awareness
 Enhance emotional connection with consumers and brand stakeholders,
including investors, employees, and those who influence brand selection
289
Chapter 17: Revitalizing Your Brand
Revitalizing, because . . .
Revitalizing your brand presents a great oppor-
tunity to state anew what your brand stands for.
As brands age, brand messages often get
blurry; over time, people within and outside the
business become unclear about a brand’s iden-
tity, what distinguishes it from others, what
unique attributes it offers, and what promise it
makes.
Revitalizing lets you put a polishing cloth not
only to your brand look but also to your brand
message. You get the chance to say, “We are
revitalizing our brand because . . .”
 We’ve expanded our market territory.
 We’ve added products or enhanced services.
 We’ve changed strategically to better
address market realities, needs, and desires.
 We’ve grown through mergers, acquisi-
tions, or meteoric success.
Brand revitalization lets you amplify the good
news about what your brand has become. It
gives you the chance to reunite everyone in
your company and customer corps under a
new, clearly stated brand message that gives
you something to shout about.

 Clarify or redefine brand distinctions
 Build or rebuild credibility and trust
 Motivate product preference and purchases
Chapter 3 includes a worksheet that helps you assess how well your brand-
ing priorities are supported by your current brand strengths. If your brand is
strong in your priority areas, your need for brand revitalization is low. If your
brand is weak in the areas that are most important to your future success,
however, your brand likely needs assessment, repair, and rejuvenation.
How well does your brand fit in your marketplace?
Sometimes marketplace conditions change in such a way that brands become
outdated or even irrelevant. Perhaps the brand’s benefits are no longer appeal-
ing or the way the brand is presented to consumers no longer fits marketplace
trends and patterns. Ask these questions:
 How do others — including employees, customers, prospective cus-
tomers, investors, and suppliers — perceive your brand?
 Why do consumers choose your brand? Are their reasons strongly com-
pelling and adequately conveyed in your brand name, logo, tagline, and
brand communications?
 What attributes do consumers believe distinguish your brand from com-
peting brands? Are those the same attributes that you feel best differen-
tiate your brand and its offerings?
 Are the distinguishing characteristics of your brand of increasing or
decreasing interest to consumers?
 Is your brand well recognized among those you target as customers?
When asked to name top contenders in your market category, do all,
most, or few prospects cite your brand?
 Do your brand name, logo, and slogan appeal to current market and cul-
tural tastes and trends?
See Chapter 4 for advice on how to conduct research to unearth the answers
you need in the area of marketplace perception.
Is your brand an accurate reflection of your business?
All great brands share one important attribute: They’re mirror images of the
companies they represent. To assess how well your brand reflects your busi-
ness situation, ask these questions:
290
Part IV: The Care and Feeding of Your Brand 

 Does your brand identity mirror your current business mission, vision,
and values (see Chapter 6), or have ownership, leadership, or strategic
changes made your brand out-of-date?
 Does your brand identity accurately reflect the character, personality, and
tone of your business? (See Chapter 6 for help arriving at your answer.)
 Does the promise you make to consumers convey your strengths and
distinctions, and is it believable and consistently reinforced through all
brand encounters? (Refer to Chapter 6 as you consider this question.)
 Do all products that you’ve added or that you plan to add fit well under
your brand? Do the number of products and the nature of your offerings
make sense to consumers? (Chapter 2 addresses brand architecture, and
Chapter 16 touches on brand extensions.)
 Is your pricing an accurate reflection of your brand message and promise?
 Has your brand image been tarnished by events within or outside your
control? (See Chapter 19 for help dealing with bad news about your
brand.)
Do consumers accurately understand your brand?
Remember, your brand lives in your consumers’ minds, so before you begin
to revise your image, invest time and effort to discover what those who know
your brand currently think of it. Ask these questions:
 Does the brand image currently held in consumers’ minds reflect the
competitive position you aspire to fill in your marketplace? (See
Chapter 5 for help staking claim to your market position.)
 When consumers rank the top competitors in your field, does the rank-
ing of your brand fit with your market dominance aspirations?
 Does your brand attract the clientele you aspire to serve?
 Do those who work most closely with your business — including your
employees, your business partners, your investors, and your most loyal
customers — all describe your brand accurately?
Does your current brand experience reinforce your 
desired brand image at all contact points?
Consumer opinion about a brand is the result of all contact with the brand,
from marketing communications to staff encounters, from the intricacies of
the purchase experience to the experience of becoming a brand owner.
Determine whether your brand experience contributes to your desired brand
image by asking these questions:
291
Chapter 17: Revitalizing Your Brand

 Are your brand name, logo, communications, location, and experience
consistent with the personality, character, and tone that you want asso-
ciated with your business?
 When consumers encounter your brand, is the experience consistent,
compelling, and competitive? (Turn to Chapter 14 for instructions on
how to put your brand experience to the test.)
 Are your communications — from your ads to your Web site to your
phone and mail and in-person contacts — uniformly consistent and 
competitive in terms of look, tone, character, and brand message?
Does your brand compete well with the brands 
of dominant competitors in your market area?
As newcomers enter your business arena, their brand offerings can change
consumer expectations. Determine whether your brand has remained current
by asking these questions:
 Is your identity (your name, logo, tagline, and other identifying ele-
ments) distinctive and competitive in terms of quality, sophistication,
and consistency?
 Is your brand promise clear, unique, and appealing when compared to
promises extended by your competitors?
 Are your services competitive or outstanding compared to those of your
competitors?
 Is your brand experience competitive and outstanding?
Making the diagnosis: Retool or retire?
After you complete a brand review, the moment of decision arrives: Can your
brand be revitalized, or do you need to put it out to pasture? To arrive at an
answer, use the results of the brand review to help you answer the following
questions:
 Is your brand healthy? Is it an accurate reflection of your business
today? As you look at your plans and hopes for the next ten years, does
your brand name, logo, promise, and message extend to cover your 
aspirations?
If your answers add up to a resounding “yes,” give your brand the green
light to keep going, along with a double-dose investment of time and
money to see that it’s well protected and well presented for years
to come.
292
Part IV: The Care and Feeding of Your Brand 

 Is your brand ailing? Has it lost its fit with your business and market? If
so, is the gap between what your business has become and what your
brand identity implies vast or minor?
If the alignment between your brand and your business is way off — if
your brand is called Main Street Fix-It but you now offer business system
reviews and solutions to a global market — you’re facing an identity
crisis, and complete rebranding may be in order.
On the other hand, if the alignment between your brand and your business
is only slightly amiss — if your name is Global Advertising but you now
offer global clients strategic planning, branding, and message development
services in addition to advertising production and placement — a name
adjustment and a brand revitalization may be the extent of your needs.
 Does your brand have high value? (Chapter 15 can help you make your
assessment.) If your answer is “yes,” you have strong motivation to revi-
talize rather than rebrand. By revitalizing — or updating and polishing
your current brand — you maintain the high-value identifying elements
of your brand, and in so doing you protect the brand value you’ve built
over the years.
When you rebrand, you basically erase previously established value and
start over again, building value from scratch. Rebranding is the way to
go when the value in your existing brand is so low or in such negative
territory that you’re better off giving yourself the equivalent of a golf
mulligan and taking an altogether new shot. If that’s the case in your sit-
uation, turn straight back to Chapter 3, heat up your branding iron, and
get ready to begin the branding process from square one.
Fixing a Broken Brand
Most brands break not because markets change but because businesses
change.
Sometimes, logos go out of style and need updating in order to keep pace
with market tastes and cultural trends, but that kind of market-responsive
change involves only a cosmetic update, not a brand overhaul.
Brand overhauls become necessary when business overhauls literally change
a company’s heart and soul. When the core of the business — the base of the
brand — changes radically, the face of the brand — the brand’s name, logo,
and identifying elements — needs to change, too. Otherwise, a disconnect
exists between what the brand says it is and what, in fact, the brand is. And
that’s a formula for credibility disaster.
293
Chapter 17: Revitalizing Your Brand

Protecting your valuables
The most essential step in fixing or updating a brand is determining which of
your brand assets carry the highest value in consumers’ minds. Brand assets
include:
 Your brand name
 Your brand’s identifying elements, including your logo, your logotype or
script, your tagline or slogan, your color scheme, your packaging, and
brand signature items such as a unique scent (think Cinnabon), a musi-
cal signature (United Air Lines’ background music, for example), or even
signature events that consumers link to your name

Part IV: The Care and Feeding of Your Brand 
Ten mistakes to avoid when revitalizing
As you audit, update, and realign your brand to
address current business and market realities,
take a minute to review the most common mis-
takes brand marketers make so that you can
avoid them and sail on toward branding suc-
cess. The most common mistakes are
 Failure to enlist the head of your organiza-
tion as the leader of your brand revitaliza-
tion effort
 Failure to assess whether your product or
your brand experience — and not your
brand identity — may be hurting your
brand’s esteem in its marketplace
 Failure to enlist experienced professionals
to help with research, name development,
logo design, trademark registration, and
brand communications
 Failure to inform your staff early on about
why you’re undertaking a brand revitaliza-
tion effort
 Failure to understand and protect your cur-
rent brand assets as you revise your brand
for the future
 Failure to maintain a silent stage, a time
during which brand plans are held close to
the vest until they’re adopted by manage-
ment and ready for presentation to your
organization’s internal team. (Put in familiar
terms, loose lips sink ships.)
 Failure to introduce and win support 
internally before you let your revitalized
brand story outside the confines of your
organization
 Failure to reach your most loyal customers,
investors, and suppliers with news of your
revitalized brand before they learn about
your brand changes through the grapevine
or through mass media
 Failure to establish a brand management
plan that ensures continuous and consis-
tent communication of your brand message
and promise across all communication
channels and at all consumer touch points
 Failure to introduce your revitalized brand
with the fanfare it deserves

 Your brand’s core message and promise
 Your brand’s dominance in a defined market niche
 Your brand’s link to key customer groups
The brand asset analysis worksheet in Chapter 3 can help you determine the
value of each of your assets and whether or not the strength of your brand
would be reduced if you were to change or eliminate the asset.
For instance, if you discover that your brandmark has low awareness or 
that its usage has been mismanaged over the years, you may determine that
replacing your symbol will serve only to strengthen your image. On the other
hand, if you find that consumers have high awareness and regard for your
name, you should think long and hard before abandoning it.
Making the change
You can start the revitalization process after you determine which brand
assets you should keep and which are dispensable. Take these steps to revi-
talize your brand:
1. Get the leadership of your company involved right from the beginning.
If possible, the person who leads your company should lead the brand
revitalization or rebranding process. Otherwise, you’re apt to face an
uphill battle when it’s time to adopt the new identity.
2. Determine how you’ll refresh, revise, or rebuild your brand promise.
In essence, your brand is the promise you make to consumers. The degree
to which you alter your promise in large part dictates the degree to which
you alter your brand. (Turn to Chapter 6 for help with this step.)
3. Determine whether you need to alter your name, either slightly or
drastically, to fit your business, your market, and your sales channels.
In Chapter 7, we help you with your analysis and with the process of
renaming your brand, if that’s the next step in your brand’s life.
4. Decide whether you need to redesign your logo.
Chapter 8 has advice on logo design, but we recommend that you
involve an experienced professional in the actual redesign. As part of the
redesign process, also rewrite your graphic guidelines and your brand
management policies (see Chapter 8).
295
Chapter 17: Revitalizing Your Brand

5. Refine your brand experience so that every encounter with your revi-
talized brand reinforces the message and promise you make and the
image you want to etch in the consumer’s mind.
6. Relaunch your brand, starting within your organization and following
the advice in Chapter 9.
Don’t leapfrog over this step. If you fail to gain understanding and buy-in
from your internal team, nothing you do externally can save your brand
from the ramifications.
7. When your revitalized brand is known, accepted, and adopted inter-
nally (and not a moment before), take your brand public.
Begin with a publicity generation effort that shares the story of why
you’re making the change, how you’re building on your brand’s heritage
while simultaneously embracing your brand’s future, and how your new
identity and brand strategy focus on a clear, strong, powerful vision. See
Chapter 10 for a publicity how-to.
8. Launch advertising and promotions to amplify your brand’s revital-
ized message (see Chapter 11).
9. Invest the time and dollars necessary to build and protect your revi-
talized brand’s value (see Chapter 18).

F
or all their strengths, brands are vulnerable. They’re susceptible to
infringement by competitors who use disarmingly similar names or
logos. Plus they’re open to attack by friends and foes alike, who intentionally
or innocently mess with your brand’s identity and erode your brand strength
in the process.
The reasons to protect your brand are many, but none tops the fact that,
when brands undergo competitive attack or weak management, marketplace
confusion follows. And marketplace confusion is a fatal condition for most
brands.
This chapter helps you fortify your brand in two ways. First, it tells you how
to take preemptive action by registering your brand identity so that others
can’t use it — or so that you can take legal action if they do. Second, it lays
out a plan for managing the presentation of your brand, beginning with usage
guidelines and ending with usage enforcement.
Strong brands thrive under the careful watch of brand owners who never
blink and who never turn a blind eye to brand management mishaps or trans-
gressions. The old line “You snooze, you lose” could have been written as
advice for brand managers. Vigilance is the prescription for brand strength
and the antidote for brand erosion.

Immunizing Your Brand with Government
Filings and Trademarks
The extent to which you protect your name legally hinges on the size of
your business, the size of your market area, and the vision you hold for your
business. If you think that someday your brand will span state or national
borders — or if you think that someday you may want to sell it to someone
with aspirations of building it into a national or global name — you should
put every form of legal protection in place, the sooner the better.
The best and easiest time to protect your brand is right when you name your
business because your business name is likely to become your primary
brand name. Turn to Chapter 7 for complete advice for choosing a name,
screening to see that it isn’t already in use, and registering it so it’s unavail-
able to others.
The most common methods of name protection are
 Filing your business name with local government offices
 Establishing a trademark
In this section, we provide tips for how to proceed on both fronts.
Filing your name with local 
government offices
Brand names fit into one of two categories: business names and product
names. This section deals with protecting business names.
As you name your business, either you’ll choose a name that includes the
owners’ surnames along with a description of the business or you’ll choose
what’s called a fictitious or assumed name, which features a name other
than your true name. In either case, filing your name with the right local 
government office is a necessary step. The process is straightforward and 
relatively easy.
If your business name includes the legal surname of each owner along with a
generic description of your business (for instance, Smith, Jones, and
Peterson Insurance), follow these steps:
1. Find out where the database of registered business names is main-
tained in your state or region.
300
Part V: Protecting Your Brand 

Contact the office of your county clerk or your secretary of state for
help, or ask your attorney or accountant for instructions. Your banker
can also point you in the right direction because financial institutions
require name registration information when opening business accounts.
2. Register your business name by completing a form and paying a fee.
When you’re doing business under your legal name (such as John
Johnson Plumbing), a name search and name approval is unnecessary.
The exception is if you add a phrase such as “and Sons” or “and
Associates” to your name (for example, John Johnson and Sons
Plumbing). In that case, the name suggests that other owners are
involved, so you need to follow the rules for registering a fictitious or
assumed name as described in the following list.
Business names that don’t include owners’ legal surnames and generic busi-
ness descriptions are called fictitious names or assumed names. If your name
falls under this category, you need to register the name with a government
agency. In most areas, registration takes place though the office of the county
clerk, but in some areas the office of the secretary of state handles the task.
Your banker or attorney can direct you to the right office. The registration
process for these types of names is as follows:
1. Undertake a name availability search to determine that no competing
business has staked a claim to the name you want.
To determine name availability, request a search of the assumed names
database in all jurisdictions (usually that means counties) in which you
want to register your name. Search the jurisdiction where your business
is located as well as the jurisdictions that cover each market area you
plan to serve. Additionally, consider searching the jurisdictions that
cover the heaviest population areas of your state or region because you
may choose to expand into those areas in the future.
2. If your desired name is available, fill out the forms and pay the
required fees to register your name in your home region and in each
region you plan to do business.
Consider also registering your name in the counties that include your
state’s greatest population counts in order to protect the name from use
by most competing businesses in your greater market area.
If a name availability search reveals that your desired brand name is already
taken by another business, head back to the drawing board and check out
Chapter 7 for naming advice.
301
Chapter 18: Defending Your Brand

Obtaining a trademark
If your business serves only one state, you can inquire with the office of your
secretary of state about a state trademark that helps protect your brand
identity in your statewide region.
When you obtain a state trademark, you prevent others from using a similar
mark in your statewide area. However, the process for obtaining a state trade-
mark includes no search of other state or federal registrations; therefore,
your right to use a state mark could be preempted by discovery of prior use
by a trademark owner with a federal registration.
A federal trademark provides broader protection than a state trademark and
is important if your business serves a far-reaching market area that crosses
state or national borders. (A federal trademark is called a service mark if it
protects the brand of a service rather than a tangible item.)
The process of trademarking is long, tricky, and important for two reasons:
 A federal trademark protects your brand identity from use by others.
 The process of obtaining a trademark steers you clear of the legal hot
water that awaits if you obliviously try to use a name, logo, tagline, or
other identifying element that someone else has trademarked.
To obtain a federal trademark, plan to take these steps:
1. Determine whether the brand identity you want to trademark is
blocked by someone else’s trademark.
To make this determination, you can conduct a preliminary online
search of the database maintained by the U.S. Patent and Trademark
Office (USPTO). Go to www.uspto.gov, click on Trademarks, click on
Search Trademarks, and follow the instructions. (For information on
international trademark protection, go to www.uspto.gov/main/
profiles/international.htm.)
2. If your desired brand identity appears to be available, hire an attorney
who specializes in trademarks to conduct a more extensive search.
Your attorney will determine whether your desired brand identity is
available for use without risk of an infringement suit from another trade-
mark holder.
Don’t try to proceed on your own; the trademark process requires pro-
fessional expertise. (You can find details of the steps and costs involved
in this extensive brand identity search in Chapter 7.)
302
Part V: Protecting Your Brand 

3. If you get a green light from your attorney, move to secure a trade-
mark as quickly as you can, either through continuous and consistent
use (see the next section) or through the rigorous process of official
trademark registration (see the section “Obtaining a registered trade-
mark” later in this chapter).
Trademarking through common law usage
After you determine that your brand name, logo, tagline, or other identifying
element is available — meaning that it isn’t already protected by someone
else’s trademark — you can begin to trademark it by using it continuously and
consistently in the course of marketing and selling your branded offering.
When establishing your trademark through common law usage, use the letters
“TM” in superscript (or “SM” if you’re establishing a service mark) alongside
the mark you’re protecting. In the United States and countries with similar
legal systems, announcing your trademark or service mark claim in this way
lets you begin to accrue trademark rights through common law usage.
In taking the common law approach, be aware of these shortcomings:
 Common law trademark protection is limited to the geographic areas in
which your mark has actually been used.
 You don’t have the protection of a federal registration if another party
were to dispute your claim to your trademark.
 By using the trademark without undergoing the rigorous search and
analysis of a formal trademark application, you may be liable for infring-
ing upon someone else’s registered mark. Even after your attorney
screens and conducts a detailed risk analysis for your name, additional
infringement issues can arise during the trademark application process
that preclude your usage of the mark, which is why federal registration
is the ultimate form of trademark protection.
Obtaining a registered trademark
To obtain a federally registered trademark, follow the steps described in the
beginning of this section and in Chapter 7. The federal trademark process is
especially important to undergo to protect your brand if you do or plan to do
business across state or national borders. For information on federally regis-
tered trademarks, count on these resources:
 For information on U.S. trademarks, turn to the USPTO Web site at
www.uspto.gov.
 For information on obtaining trademarks in a number of countries
through a single registration, visit the World Intellectual Property
Organization at www.wipo.int or go to the international property sec-
tion of the USPTO Web site at www.uspto.gov/main/profiles/
international.htm.
303
Chapter 18: Defending Your Brand

 To locate attorneys in your area who specialize in intellectual prop-
erty including trademarks, visit the Web site of the American Bar
Association at www.abanet.org and click on Lawyer Locator.
Use the trademark designations superscript “TM” or “SM” until your trade-
mark is formally issued by the USPTO, at which time you can begin using the
designation ®. Don’t jump the gun and use the registered mark before your
federal trademark is granted. Doing so is called false use and can result in
denial of your federal registration.
As soon as you receive your federal trademark, give notice of your trademark
in at least one prominent place in every ad, brochure, package, sign, or other
medium by
 Using the symbol ® presented in superscript to the right of the trade-
marked name or symbol
 Using “Registered, U.S. Patent and Trademark Office” (or the abbrevia-
tion “Reg. U.S. Pat. & Tm. Off.”) either in addition to or instead of the 
® symbol
Maintaining your trademark registration
Registering your trademark is like jumping through flaming hoops, and the
effort doesn’t stop when the registration is approved. After you obtain a
trademark registration, it’s time to kick your trademark protection efforts
into high gear. If you don’t, your mark and all the work you put into obtaining
it can fly right out the window.
Use it or abandon it
We’re sure you’ve heard about cyber-squatters who grab up domain names,
register them, and camp on the names with the thought of either using them
in the future or selling them to someone else when the time and price is right.
Don’t try a similar tactic in the world of trademarks. Trademarks are only
granted to applicants who are actively engaged or who can prove their intent
to be engaged in the fields of commerce covered by the application.
When you apply to register a trademark, the USPTO requires you to list the
specific goods and services for which you seek the registration. For each area
you list, you must have use in commerce, which means that you must be able
to provide evidence either that you’re currently engaged in commerce in the
areas listed or that you have good faith intent to use the mark in the areas
listed on your registration application.
Using your mark in commerce means a couple of different things.

Part V: Protecting Your Brand 

 For trademarked goods: The mark is placed on products, labels, pack-
ages, displays, or documents associated with the sale of goods that are
sold or transported interstate.
 For trademarked services: The mark is used or displayed in marketing
and selling services that are provided in more than one state.
Simply putting your mark on stationery products or using it in business pre-
sentations isn’t enough to prove that it has use in commerce. You have to
actually use the mark commercially in each of the categories covered by your
application, and you have to keep using it. After three years of nonuse in any
category, your trademark can be deemed abandoned and cancelled as a result.
To protect your trademark, work with and follow the advice of an attorney
who specializes in trademark law. Be prepared to periodically assess that
your trademark is used in commerce in each of the usage categories for
which it’s registered. If you aren’t using the mark in all its designated cate-
gories, take action to amend your registration. Otherwise, you put your entire
registration at risk.
Defend it or lose it
By obtaining federal trademark registration, you claim exclusive rights to use
a name, symbol, tagline, or other identifying element. With that right, how-
ever, comes an obligation to use the mark continuously and consistently and
to bar any usage that weakens your exclusive claim to the mark.
As you protect your trademark, rely on information obtained from your trade-
mark attorney and the USPTO. At the very least, follow these suggestions:
 Don’t use your trademarked name as a verb, and don’t allow it to be
turned into an active word by adding -ing.
Consider what happened to the trademark Windsurfer. The mark for
Windsurfer applied to a wind-propelled, surfboard-like apparatus
patented by Californians Jim Drake and Hoyle Schweitzer in 1968. But
after the trademarked term was presented as a verb — by using the
word “windsurfing” to describe the sport of sailboarding — courts found
the mark to be generic and no longer protectable as a trademark.
 Do use your trademark as an adjective in front of the generic term for
your offering, not as a noun that describes your offering. For example,
Xerox copier and Macintosh computer are proper uses of trademarks.
The story of the escalator illustrates what happens if you fail to follow
this rule. The name Escalator was once a trademark of the Otis Elevator
Company. However, instead of consistently using the mark as a descrip-
tor (as in Escalator brand moving stairs), it was used as a noun (an esca-
lator), and the trademark protection rolled right out of sight.
305
Chapter 18: Defending Your Brand

 Do accompany your trademark with the appropriate symbol: super-
script “TM” for unregistered trademarks, superscript “SM” for unregis-
tered service marks, and ® for registered trademarks or service marks.
 Do present your trademark consistently, with no variation in spelling
and no addition of dashes or slashes.
 Do separate your trademarked name from surrounding text by underlin-
ing it or by presenting it in bold, capital letters, or italics.
If you slack off and use or allow others to use your trademarked term as a
verb or a generic label, you dilute your exclusive rights to the term and risk
rights to your trademark as a result.
Owners of widely known and cited trademarks go to great and costly lengths
to keep their names from being used as common nouns or verbs. As one
example, the owners of the Rollerblade mark have spent millions of dollars to
educate consumers and competitors about how the mark can and can’t be
used. The gist of their message is that Rollerblade isn’t a generic term for in-
line skates, and rollerblading isn’t a sport. Rather, Rollerblade is a trademark
name of a company that manufactures in-line skates, and it’s the brand of
equipment you wear when you go in-line skating. Using the term in any other
way puts the trademark at risk, and the makers of Rollerblade skates pay
dearly to ensure that doesn’t happen.
306
Part V: Protecting Your Brand 
If the world’s your market . . .
As you take action to register and protect your
name from competitors, think big. In fact, if your
products or services will travel the world, think
in global terms right from the get-go.
If you intend for your brand to establish interna-
tional value and strong equity, follow this
advice:
 As you develop your brand identity, test 
its relevance and acceptance in other cul-
tures and languages — especially in the
cultures of countries where you’ll develop
clusters of customers as a result of global
offices, Internet marketing, or distributor
relationships.
 If your products or services will travel
national borders, obtain international trade-
mark registrations in the very beginning,
before others can beat you to the task. 
If you don’t, someday when you seek to 
protect your brand in distant markets, you
just may discover that your name has
already been trademarked — but not by
your organization.
 There’s no such thing as a worldwide trade-
mark, but you can file a single international
application that allows you to apply for
trademark registration in any of the more
than 60 countries that participate in what’s
called the Madrid Protocol. For information,
visit the World Intellectual Property
Organization at www.wipo.int.

Shielding Your Brand from Misuse
Regardless of the form of legal protection you put in place to protect your
brand’s identity from misuse outside your company, you need to establish
and adopt a set of well-crafted and carefully monitored usage guidelines and
standards for use within your company.
Laying down the law with brand 
usage guidelines
Chapter 8 includes advice for stipulating your logo usage guidelines. Beyond
consistent logo usage, well-branded organizations establish style guidelines —
“rules” may be a better word — for how their identities may be presented.
As you define how your brand can be presented, be sure to consider and
cover all the points in this section.
Logo usage
To ensure that your logo always appears exactly to your specifications, begin
by creating digital logo art files that can be scaled larger or smaller only as a
single unit. By using these established files, designers and others can’t take
artistic liberties with logo elements.
Additional ways to protect your logo include:
 Requiring that your logo be reproduced only from approved materials
provided digitally or in reproduction-ready form by your organization
and never from second-generation versions that risk a loss of quality
and clarity
 Providing your logo in horizontal and vertical versions and stipulating
that any alternative presentation must be approved prior to usage
 Defining how your logo may be placed in printed materials, including the
smallest size in which it can be reproduced and the amount of open
space that must surround it in order to protect its presentation
 Explaining allowable color treatments, including whether the logo can
be reversed (to appear as a white image in a field of color) and the exact
ink colors in which it can appear
Logo usage is covered in more detail in Chapter 8.
307
Chapter 18: Defending Your Brand

Typestyle
A quick way to unify the look of your brand materials is to limit the type-
styles or fonts that you allow in your ads, brochures, signs, packaging, or
other materials. For best results, adopt and limit type usage to one or several
fonts for use in headlines and one or several for use in body copy or text.
As you choose typestyles, match how you look in print with the personality
and character of your brand (see Chapter 6 for help defining your brand
character). For example, if your brand personality is crisp and professional,
you won’t want to choose a typestyle that’s ultra-trendy or playful.
Copy guidelines
To protect your identity, write copy guidelines to define how your name can
be presented and what words may and may not be used in association with
your brand. Your copy guidelines should
 Define which parts of your name or slogan must be presented in all capi-
tal letters or with an initial capital letter.
 Define when, if ever, your name may be abbreviated and, if so, what
abbreviations are allowable.
 Prohibit using your brand name as a verb (with -ing) or as a noun. Think
of your brand name is an adjective that modifies a generic word that
describes your product (for example, JELL-O gelatin).
 Prohibit using your brand name in plural or possessive form (in other
words, don’t add an -s or -’s unless your brand is trademarked in that
form).
 Prohibit breaking and hyphenating your brand name at the end of a line.
 State whether and when your name must be accompanied by a designa-
tion such as Inc., Ltd., or LLC.
 Define which parts of your name or slogan must be accompanied by a
trademark, service mark, or registered trademark symbol based on the
advice of your trademark attorney.
 Define whether and how you want your marketing materials to carry a
copyright notice (for example, © 2006 Your Brand Name, Inc.). For copy-
right information, go to www.copyright.gov.

Enforcing the rules
The key to enforcing your brand usage rules is to aggressively monitor how
your brand is being presented. Get ready, though, because the task is harder
308
Part V: Protecting Your Brand 

today than it has ever been before thanks to the immediate and far reach of the
Internet. It used to take years for a term to make its way into everyday language
as a generic descriptor for a product or activity. With the Internet, though, a
term can be adopted as everyday language within a matter of months.
The brand name Google is a perfect example. If it weren’t for constant brand
protection efforts, the name would have long since become a generic label,
and the trademark would have been at risk, big time. Instead, Google
Technology takes action every time it sees a trademark violation. The infring-
ing party receives correspondence stating that Google is a trademark of
Google Technology, Inc. and that use of “Google” must refer to the services of
the company and not to Internet searching in general. Along with the letter is
a set of instructions on how to use “Google” properly and a request to delete
or revise the infringing reference.
What’s good policy for the Google brand is good policy for your brand as
well. After you establish your brand, take these actions to protect it:
 Put the appropriate brand protections in place, from filing your name
with local government offices to registering your trademark.
 Define your brand usage guidelines.
 Name and empower a department or person to monitor and enforce
your brand usage guidelines (see the next section).
 Train your entire employee team about proper use of your brand and
trademarks.
 Require all suppliers, copromoters, or licensees to respect your trade-
mark and to follow your brand usage guidelines.
 Don’t allow any misuse or infringement of your brand and trademarks,
either within or outside your organization.
 Monitor and manage your trademark registration to be sure you’re using
your mark properly in all registration categories, and amend or renew
your application as necessary to keep it accurate and current.
Naming and empowering a brand cop
Your brand cop, also called a trademark coordinator, is the person (or depart-
ment) that keeps your brand safe from misuse or infringements. Consider
assigning the task to your marketing vice president or to a person in your
marketing department. The brand cop’s job is to enforce brand usage guide-
lines while continuously monitoring for misuse of your brand from those out-
side your organization.
309
Chapter 18: Defending Your Brand

Specific tasks include:
 Training all employees regarding the use of your trademark and brand
identity
Training should take place at the time of hiring and again whenever the
brand is updated, extended, or in any way revised. Providing printed or
online copies of usage guidelines isn’t enough; plan face-to-face meetings
and in-person presentations to demonstrate and personally explain cor-
rect approaches to your brand presentation.
 Reviewing brand materials for consistency with brand usage guidelines
 Reviewing (with your attorney) plans for copromotions or license agree-
ments to be sure that they uphold your trademark and brand presenta-
tion rules
 Monitoring for misuse of your trademark by those within your organiza-
tion by watching for any of the trademark violations noted in the section
“Defend it or lose it” earlier in this chapter
 Watching for misuse of your mark by other organizations that may try to
use or misuse your mark or to adopt a mark that closely resembles
yours and causes marketplace confusion as a result
Scan the Internet for unauthorized usage by entering your trademark
name as well as violations of your name — such as your name as a 
verb — in search engines. Study the search results as well as the ads
that appear alongside the results to see if your mark is being used 
erroneously.
 Taking action against trademark abuses
Sometimes the abuse is intentional, but more often it’s not. If the viola-
tion stems from an employee or supplier mistake or oversight, get it
fixed immediately. If it comes from the outside, get legal advice regarding
how to proceed to put an end to the misuse.
 Keeping records of trademark usage and trademark enforcement
Should your trademark ever be questioned, you want your files to show
that, in fact, your trademark was used in commerce in each category
covered by the application and that it was aggressively protected and
defended, both within and outside your organization.

Taking Action When Bad Things
Happen to Good Brands
In This Chapter
 Watching for brand-damaging landmines
 Preparing for the worst, just in case
S
ometimes brands make news for the worst reasons. In spite of a million
good intentions, brands can run into trouble due to anything from bad
management to bad luck. When they do, the situation requires action, ASAP.
The alternative — waiting around while you try to wish the problem away —
is a formula for a public relations disaster.
This chapter is about righting wrongs should they happen. We begin by help-
ing you steer clear of the biggest problems brand owners encounter. Then we
prepare you for a major threat to your brand so that you don’t get blindsided.
Finally, we lay out a plan for kicking a crisis management plan into high gear,
when and if the need arises.
If all goes well, you’ll never need to implement the advice in this chapter. But
follow it anyway, just in case. Your preparation and ability to respond
promptly someday may be the key to saving your brand’s equity.
Handle with Care: Avoiding 
Brand Equity Landmines
Most brand-damaging events fall into one of these categories:
 A lapse in social responsibility: For example, some apparel brands have
had their images tainted by news that goods are manufactured in facto-
ries where worker mistreatment occurs.

 A lapse in corporate behavior: For examples, look at the business sto-
ries of the early 2000s about companies that cooked the books, violated
regulations, and used loopholes to maximize shareholder value, mini-
mizing brand equity in the process.
 A lapse in personal behavior of a high-profile executive, spokesper-
son, or leading brand representative: Examples of this kind of situation
include the brand damage that Hertz faced after spokesperson O.J.
Simpson’s double-murder trial, Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia’s posi-
tion after Stewart’s stock trading-related trial and conviction, and the
state of the Catholic Church following scandals involving abuses by
priests. In each case, negative news about the brand’s representatives
translated to negative news about the brand, risking the brand’s reputa-
tion and necessitating prompt and extensive implementation of the
brand protection measures detailed in this chapter.
 Death or sudden departure of a high-profile corporate leader: For
example, consider the impact of Dr. Robert Atkins’s death on Atkins
Nutritionals, Inc. Within days of Atkins’s untimely death in 2003 from a
fall on an icy sidewalk, headlines asked, “Is the Atkins brand toast?” The
answer followed in August 2005 when the company filed for Chapter 11
bankruptcy court protection.
 Product failures, malfunctions, or dangers: Whether real or perceived,
these problems may be the result of human errors, inadequate or over-
looked quality procedures and controls, violations of procedures, circu-
lation of misinformation, consumer misunderstandings, or out-and-out
product sabotage. Examples range from a questionable chemical that
endangered the Crayola brand years ago to cyanide-tainted Tylenol
Extra Strength capsules that resulted from product tampering and trig-
gered one of the most effective crisis management programs in the his-
tory of public relations.
 Crises that result from natural or manmade disasters or accidents:
These events can range from earthquakes or fires to snipers or terrorists.
Before you plan how to handle brand threats, take some time to plan how to
avoid them if you can.
The best offense is a good defense. To defend yourself, you need to take two
essential steps:
1. Identify potential threats.
Go through the preceding list to identify the kinds of threats that may
take a toll on your brand reputation. Then assess the likelihood of those
threats actually occurring. For any threat that appears to loom large,
work in advance to reduce vulnerability by establishing systems and
protective actions that steer your organization away from the potential
risks.
312
Part V: Protecting Your Brand 

2. Prepare a brand crisis management plan.
Prepare a plan complete with assignments for who will lead and serve
on the crisis management team, what communication procedures will be
followed, and the steps that will get a clear, consistent message out to all
affected audiences.
Identifying potential threats
While your business environment is calm, take time to imagine some of the
worst-case scenarios your brand may face. Then assess how significantly
each threat could affect the strength of your brand, your business, and your
reputation. To identify all potential threats, take these steps:
1. Consider potential brand threats that may negatively impact your
brand image.
Refer to the preceding list of brand-damaging event categories to
prompt your thinking.
2. Rank the likelihood of each brand threat occurring.
For instance, a privately held service business with no shareholders and
no production facilities has a low likelihood of encountering a threat
from a lapse of corporate behavior. If that same service business is
headed by an owner with a high-profile, jet-set lifestyle, however, the
likelihood of a real or perceived lapse of personal behavior may be high.
3. Determine which of your brand attributes would be most affected
should your brand encounter each potential brand threat.
For example, if your business has to deal with news of a product failure,
brand attributes such as safety, precision craftsmanship, or quality
would be affected.
4. Rank the impact of each attribute that may be affected on the overall
strength of your brand.
For example, if your brand is known primarily for its safety record and
suddenly sustains a safety lapse, the impact on brand strength would
be high.
Use the chart shown in Figure 19-1 as you assess the likelihood that various
potential threats will impact attributes that are important to the strength of
your brand image. Wherever you see a likely brand threat to a high-impact
brand attribute, take preventive action by fortifying systems and procedures
in order to avoid a brand-shaking crisis.

EVALUATING IMPACT OF BRAND THREATS ON BRAND STRENGTH
In any row that you check “high” in both the Likelihood and Impact columns, the brand
threat is both real and potentially highly damaging. 
Lapse of social 
responsibility (due to 
hiring policies, vendor 
policies, production 
processes, and so on)
Lapse in corporate 
behavior (due to 
accounting discrepancies; 
violation of environmental 
or other regulations;
violation of trust of 
consumers, investors, 
stockholders, and so on)
Lapse of personal 
behavior of high-profile 
owner or leader, 
spokesperson, or other 
brand representative 
(due to legal issues, 
personal troubles, and 
so on) 
Death or sudden 
departure of corporate 
leader 
Product failure, 
malfunction, or danger 
(whether real or rumored)
Natural or human-caused 
disaster or accident that 
affects business access, 
product delivery, or safety 
of consumers and 
employees.

Taking preemptive strikes 
against brand threats
Complete the chart in Figure 19-1, and scan your results for any rows in
which you’ve checked “medium” or “high” in both the second and fourth
columns. These rows indicate areas where your brand faces a strong likeli-
hood of encountering a threat that could shake your reputation to the core.
For each high-risk, high-impact threat, develop both a strategy to reduce the
risk and the capability to deal with the threat should it happen. Go so far as
to share your preemptive plans with those who have a stake in your brand —
from employees to customers to suppliers to investors.
For example, Berkshire Hathaway is a publicly traded company controlled by
Warren Buffett, one of the most renowned and richest investors in the world.
When it comes to Berkshire Hathaway’s brand attributes, the wisdom and wit
of Warren Buffett soar right to the top of the list. As a result, the departure of
Buffett, who has run the company since 1965, is a valid brand threat. It’s also
a threat from which the company doesn’t run or hide. The 2005 Berkshire
Hathaway annual report includes a section titled “Succession Planning” that
begins with the paragraph, “As owners, you are naturally concerned about
whether I will insist on continuing as CEO after I begin to fade and, if so, how
the board will handle that problem. You also want to know what happens if I
should die tonight.” The rest of the section explains, in detail, how the com-
pany is prepared to handle the transition in a way that protects the security
of the company and shareholder investments. It ends with the assurance,
“We have an outstanding group of directors, and they will always do what’s
right for shareholders. And while we are on the subject, I feel terrific.”
Take a straightforward approach when owning up to and addressing your
own brand threats. Follow these steps:
1. Face facts.
Where you know you face a risk, admit it. Trying to wish it away is never
a decent strategy. If you’re vulnerable because of lax production poli-
cies, admit it. If the public places high confidence in your high-profile
but aging leader, admit it. Regardless of the threat, if it’s real and loom-
ing, shed light on it and begin examining how best to minimize the
threat.
2. Gather a team to discuss risks.
Form a brand threat management committee to consider potential
threats from a number of viewpoints. Involve not just brand manage-
ment staff but also managers from customer service, production, finan-
cial management, and other departments. Discuss what kinds of events
may trigger the brand threat and how each can be preempted.
315
Chapter 19: Taking Action When Bad Things Happen to Good Brands

3. Take preventive action.
If the threat is real and the risk is high, address it head-on. Enact new
policies. Install new procedures. Establish a succession plan. Create
evacuation procedures. Address high-risk behaviors. Take whatever
steps are necessary and effective to admit and reduce or erase vulnera-
bilities that could damage your brand image in the future.
Be Prepared: Reacting to Brand Threats
If the worst happens and your brand reputation is attacked by internal or
outside forces, be ready to control the news, tell the story, remedy the prob-
lem, and assure the public that it won’t happen again.
Public relations professionals talk about a golden hour during which you can
control the story and move quickly to save your brand image from disaster.
Yet too many companies spend the first hour following a brand threat wring-
ing their hands and trying to figure out what steps to take. By the time
they’re ready to move, the story is out of their hands and being told by
others, often with inaccuracies and from perspectives that damage the brand
even further.
Commit to developing a brand crisis management plan that includes these
components:
 Who’s who on your management team, including who will serve as the
primary and secondary spokespersons, who will provide legal or techni-
cal advice, and who will help staff the plan.
 Whom to contact in the event of a crisis. Prepare a list with home, office,
fax, and cell phone numbers; e-mail addresses; and mailing addresses for
• Emergency and security contacts
• Top executives and managers
• Business and financial partners
• Media contacts
• Employees
• Key contacts in your community, industry, and distribution channels
• Key customers
 What to say, including what happened, what you’re doing to make it
right, and how it won’t happen again — all in terms that describe your
concern for the public and not simply your actions to minimize corpo-
rate or brand loss. Remember, you can’t plan your exact message in
advance, but you can plan what your message needs to convey.
316
Part V: Protecting Your Brand 

 What your strategy is, including plans for releasing the news, establish-
ing and staffing physical and online media centers, handling heightened
interest through expanded and even back-up phone and online capacity,
and providing ongoing updates regarding how you’re working to remedy
the problem and prevent it from recurring.
The following sections cover each of these components in more detail.
Compiling a list of who’s who
Be ready to activate a crisis management program by knowing in advance
exactly who will serve on the management and communication team. Fill the
roles explained in each of the following sections.
Primary spokesperson
Each communications crisis needs one calm, knowledgeable person to serve as
a spokesperson that presents facts, fields questions, and provides an interface
between the media and the brand. In small businesses or organizations, the
CEO or the owner often takes on spokesperson responsibilities simply because
no one else in the organization has a high enough profile to fill the role. In
larger organizations, the person who serves as the communications expert
(usually the vice president or director of public relations) assumes the task.
When other qualified candidates are available, many organizations avoid
naming the CEO as primary spokesperson. The reasoning isn’t that the CEO
can’t fill the role but rather that, if media representatives are trained to deal
with the CEO, they won’t settle for statements from a secondary spokesperson.
As a result, if the CEO isn’t available, media representatives may hold their
questions, and potentially damaging information lapses may occur as a result.
As you appoint your spokesperson, be sure he or she is trained in your brand
story and message as well as in media relations, including how to conduct and
manage interviews and media coverage. Also be sure the spokesperson is
 Capable of communicating and presenting information well
 Comfortable and experienced in front of cameras and in media interviews
 Knowledgeable about your organization
 Credible, trustworthy, and an empathetic representative to those both
within and outside your organization
 Able to inspire confidence and explain issues clearly and without jargon
 Aware of the full scope of the issue and the range of experts who can
provide additional information to reporters
 Calm, sincere, and likeable
317
Chapter 19: Taking Action When Bad Things Happen to Good Brands

Name a high-level person within your organization, such as a vice president
or your top communication officer, as your primary spokesperson. Avoid
naming a lawyer as the primary spokesperson. Doing so indicates that you
have legal concerns, which translates to guilt in the minds of consumers.
Secondary spokesperson
Your primary spokesperson can’t always be on-call, so name a back-up
spokesperson with similar capabilities so that a fully informed person is
always available to media and others.
If your primary spokesperson is your CEO, be sure that your secondary
spokesperson is a high-level company officer or owner who shares similar
clout. Otherwise, media will want to wait to talk with the CEO, potentially
costing your brand an opportunity to provide breaking news and facts to the
public.
Expert advisors
Depending upon the nature of the brand crisis, you may need to involve rep-
resentatives from various outside organizations to provide specific informa-
tion on anything from medical to legal to police activities.
In such cases, ask each outside organization to name its own primary and
secondary spokespersons rather than make comments through a long list of
different representatives. This arrangement helps you limit the number of
people who are explaining the crisis to the public. Otherwise, consumers
hear bits and pieces of the story from a mind-boggling number of different
representatives, triggering confusion and a lack of confidence in your busi-
ness and brand.
Your CEO
Regardless of whether your CEO serves as the primary crisis spokesperson,
he or she must lead the response to a brand threat, getting involved in the
very first moments and signing off on every element of the communication
plan so that no second-guessing or finger-pointing occurs along the way of
dealing with the problem.
Knowing who to call
In advance of any crisis, prepare a crisis communication contact list that con-
tains full contact information for the following:
 Internal contacts, including executives, crisis team members, managers,
employees, union representatives, and others
 Emergency contacts, including police, security, and government offices
318
Part V: Protecting Your Brand 

 Media contacts, including reporters or editors at local, national, interna-
tional, and trade or industry media that have an interest in news of your
organization
 Investor and analyst contacts, from your local bankers to your share-
holders to investors or potential investors
 Community and industry contacts, from your local chamber of com-
merce to your industry or trade association to key partners, subcontrac-
tors, and competitors
 Business partners, including customers, suppliers, and distributors
 Special interest contacts, including environmental, safety, consumer, or
other groups that take an interest in your business
List the sequence in which contacts should be made to ensure that those
who most need to know are reached most immediately. Also make sure that
copies of the contact list are readily available in multiple locations inside and
outside your business, including in the offices of your CEO, communications
or public relations director, top-level executives, and in a password-protected
section of your Web site.
Working out what to do and say
The first priority of every brand manager is to avoid brand crises in the first
place. That’s why it’s important to regularly assess and take proactive steps
to defend against the kinds of threats that are likely to attack your brand
strength. The chart in Figure 19-1 helps you with this task.
Sometimes, though, in spite of all the best efforts in the world, bad things
happen to good brands. If your brand were to undergo a crisis, you need to
be ready to launch into defensive action.
A single set of advice applies to all crisis situations: Tell the truth, be as com-
plete as possible, issue statements immediately, and aim to restore trust as
quickly as possible.
Instead of wasting precious moments debating what to do, take the following
actions immediately:
1. Activate your emergency communication system by contacting those
who need to know first about the threatening event.
2. Convene your brand crisis communication team.
Immediately assess the situation. Determine whether the situation
affects your organization legally, financially, administratively, opera-
tionally, or in other ways.
319
Chapter 19: Taking Action When Bad Things Happen to Good Brands

3. Craft the message you’ll deliver to explain what happened and what
your organization will do to restore safety and confidence.
When writing your message, limit it to a few sentences. If you can’t
explain the situation in seconds, people aren’t able to grasp and under-
stand it, and they turn to others for what may be erroneous explana-
tions. Prepare a message that meets these criteria:
• It has no more than three key points that you use to explain the sit-
uation, and each point is summarized in fewer than ten words. For
each point, prepare up to three supporting facts that your
spokesperson can provide as additional explanation.
• It includes no industry jargon or words that can’t be understood
by someone with an eighth grade education.
• It’s relevant and delivered in terms that matter to those who are
affected by the situation. This isn’t the time to talk about how your
organization is affected. This is the time to show that you care
about all involved parties and are dealing with the situation on
their behalf.
4. Name who will serve as your primary spokesperson and secondary
spokesperson and what additional experts you will need to call on to
explain the situation.
5. Make a list of a dozen or so of the toughest questions you think your
spokesperson will be asked.
For each question, prepare and rehearse a short response that includes
the name of the person who can provide additional legal, technical, or
other specific information.
6. Have your message and your prepared answers to anticipated ques-
tions reviewed and approved by those responsible for the affected
functions as well as by your company’s CEO and legal team.
7. Prepare a news release that explains the situation.
Tell who, what, where, when, why, and how you’re dealing with the situa-
tion, using your approved message and Chapter 10’s advice on writing
releases.
8. Make your announcement and distribute your news release as quickly
as possible.
Notify employees and all organization insiders immediately before or at
the same time that you release the story to news media. In addition to
circulating your prepared release, deliver a concise statement that sum-
marizes key points and focuses on the steps you’re taking to achieve a
positive outcome for all affected parties.

9. Open a media center where you can meet with reporters in a location
that allows them access to the story yet provides adequate distance
from the hub of activity so that they don’t overhear unplanned 
comments.

Chapter 19: Taking Action When Bad Things Happen to Good Brands
Pushing through the pain
One of the most legendary examples of a suc-
cessfully implemented crisis management plan
comes out of the early 1980s, when packages of
Tylenol Extra Strength capsules were mali-
ciously filled with cyanide-laced capsules,
resealed, and placed on retail shelves in the
Chicago area.
Johnson & Johnson, parent company of McNeil
Consumer Products Company, the maker of
Tylenol, learned of the crisis through the kind of
phone call no brand owner ever wants to
receive. A Chicago news reporter called to
report that people weren’t just sick but were
dying from poisoned Tylenol product.
Johnson & Johnson wasted no time in launch-
ing a crisis response. The company immediately
convened a crisis strategy team charged with
devising a response to two questions (in this
order): How do we protect the people? and How
do we save the product?
First, the team used the media to alert con-
sumers nationwide not to consume any form of
Tylenol until further notice. They withdrew all
Tylenol packages from Chicago-area shelves
and stopped all advertising and production.
When a tainted product was found outside the
Chicago area, they went a step farther and
pulled every bottle of Tylenol from every retail
shelf nationwide. Simultaneously, Johnson &
Johnson offered to exchange all purchased
Tylenol capsules with Tylenol tablets, at a
potential cost to the company of millions of 
dollars.
The financial impact on Johnson & Johnson
was enormous, but the focus of the company’s
efforts remained firmly on consumer safety
rather than on dollars lost. It established hot
lines and issued a constant stream of news
updates. Not once did the company spotlight
the fact that it had nothing to do with the tainted
product. Instead, it put up a $100,000 reward and
worked with the police, FBI, and other govern-
ment agencies to help find those responsible, all
the while working internally to devise tamper-
proof packaging to protect against such a dis-
aster recurring in the future.
Within months, Tylenol returned to pharmacies
and retail shelves, this time wrapped in triple-
safety sealed packaging. To bring consumers
back to the brand, the company circulated
coupons to be applied to new purchases of
Tylenol. It launched a new ad campaign, and
more than 2,000 salespeople were enlisted to
make presentations to members of the medical
community to inspire support for the product
reintroduction.
Tylenol quickly reclaimed 27 percent of the pain
reliever market and today is one of the top-
selling over-the-counter drugs in the United
States. This fact is a strong testament to the
way Johnson & Johnson rapidly responded to
the crisis by taking responsibility, putting con-
sumer safety first, working with the media, and,
ultimately, recovering from the greatest brand
crisis in the pharmaceutical industry.

10. Activate an emergency Web site, or add designated pages to your
online pressroom to present breaking news and background 
information.
See Chapter 10 for assistance in building an online pressroom.
11. Constantly update and distribute information that provides situation
and response updates including steps your organization is taking to
ensure the safety of people and products.
Remain consistent, forthright, available, and responsive to all who are
affected or who have questions or concerns.
12. When the crisis subsides, assess the impact on your brand and begin
work immediately to restore your brand strength by following the
steps detailed in Chapter 17.
Following crisis communications 
dos and don’ts
Whether you’re in the throes of a brand crisis or simply preparing your orga-
nization for such a situation, keep this advice in mind:
 Do be caring and genuinely concerned.
 Do take responsibility.
 Do explain the situation immediately in a few sentences that can be
widely understood by the general public.
 Do prepare a concise message and share it within your organization so
that everyone is talking from the same page and telling the same truths.
 Do be prepared to present complete back-up information and explana-
tions upon request, but don’t offer more information than requested or
you risk confusing the message.
 Do avoid jargon or language that the general public doesn’t understand.
 Do keep your employees informed of all new developments.
 Do plan and share remedies for the situation and controls that will pre-
vent it from recurring.
 Do answer questions in a way that allows you to reiterate the key points
of your approved message.
 Do prepare updated background information and news releases prior to
each new announcement or major interview.
322
Part V: Protecting Your Brand 

 Do realize that the spokesperson should provide facts that have been
assembled and confirmed by your organization and its expert resources
and should stick to the approved points.
 Do limit the number of people who explain the crisis to the public.
Include only your primary spokesperson, a secondary spokesperson,
and a handful of designated expert spokespeople from within or outside
your organization who are selected to explain legal, medical, technical,
or other aspects of the situation.
 Do rehearse presentations and responses to anticipated questions.
 Do follow up immediately on all information requests.
 Do refer questions requiring technical or legal responses to the desig-
nated expert spokespeople.
 Do stay calm and positive and demonstrate genuine care and concern.
 Don’t veer from approved messages.
 Don’t ask to be “off the record.”
 Don’t respond to negative questions by repeating negative phrases.
Instead, address the issue in positive terms.
 Don’t delay responding to media. If you need additional time, return the
call and schedule a return call shortly, by which time you should have
the appropriate information to share.

Ten Truths about Branding
In This Chapter

 Making the human connection
 Benefiting from great brand experiences
T
he best name, logo, ads, and efforts can’t compensate for a weak brand.
But what’s a brand? And how do you build a strong one? The ten truths
presented in this chapter offer up answers to these burning questions and
summarize the golden rules of great branding.
Branding Starts with Positioning
Your position is the birthplace of your brand. It’s the unique space in the con-
sumer’s mind that only your offering can fill. You need to determine and stake
your position before you develop the brand that will live there.
Positioning is the process of finding an unfulfilled want or need in the con-
sumer’s mind and addressing it with a distinctively different and ideally
suited offering.
Remember these rules about positioning:
 Your position must be open. Otherwise, you’ll need to dislodge an exist-
ing brand — and that’s big and costly challenge to tackle.
 Your position must be based on a unique point of difference that’s
believable and truly attractive to consumers.
 Your point of difference must be one that you can deliver with such
consistency that every experience with your brand reminds cus-
tomers of why they chose and remain loyal to your brand.

Chapter 4 helps you conduct the research necessary to find an open position
you can fill, and Chapter 5 helps you stake claim to the position you find.
A Brand Is a Promise Well Kept
Brands are promises that people believe in. Your brand, in essence, is a
promise about who you are and what unique benefits you deliver that gets
reinforced every single time people come in contact with any facet of your
organization — whether as customers, prospects, investors, employees, sup-
pliers, friends, or neighbors, or through any other dealing.
Your promise is the pledge upon which you stake your brand reputation. It’s
the expectation that you live up to every time people experience your brand,
whether through advertising, promotions, buying experiences, service
encounters, or any other contact.
A successful brand strategy results in an accurate reflection of what you are
and what you promise to all those who come into contact with your business.
For help defining your promise, flip to Chapter 6.
Branding Happens from the Inside Out
Your brand is a reflection of what you stand for, so it has to align perfectly
with the values and purpose of your organization. Otherwise, the identity you
present to the world doesn’t synch with the identity that resides at the core
of your business, and consumers sense the lack of credibility and tune out
your marketing efforts as a result.
To arrive at a brand that perfectly reflects the essence of your organization,
begin the branding process by writing three essential statements:
 Your vision statement, which defines the long-term aspirations of your
organization and the ultimate good you want to achieve
 Your mission statement, which defines what you do for others and the
approach you’ll follow to achieve your vision
 Your brand identity statement, which covers what you do, those you
serve, and the positive difference you promise to make
328
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Chapter 6 includes statement templates and step-by-step advice to follow in
writing these statements. Chapter 9 helps you win understanding and buy-in
for your brand within your organization before you even think about
announcing it to the outside world.
Consistency Builds Brands
After you’re clear about what you stand for, you’re ready to deliver your
product, promise, and brand experience with total consistency. Doing so puts
the odds strongly in your favor that you’ll win out over brands that shift with
the wind, regardless of how beautifully they’ve polished their identities or
their marketing materials.
Create a consistent brand that customers can count on by
 Displaying a consistent look
 Projecting a consistent tone
 Delivering a consistent level of quality, as demonstrated through consis-
tent communications and consistent products and services
 Being consistently true to the heart of your brand
The chapters in Part III help you present your brand with consistency
through publicity, advertising, and online efforts, and Chapter 14 provides a
blueprint for delivering a great and unfailingly consistent brand experience.
People Power Brands
Brands are made or broken by human encounters that either advance or
erode brand promises. Passionate employees and passionate customers — in
that order — power great brands. If you develop brand understanding, enthu-
siasm, and commitment within your organization, customer understanding,
enthusiasm, and commitment will follow.
A great brand name, logo, promise, and communication program are essen-
tial ingredients for brand success, but you also need brand champions, begin-
ning with the leader of your organization and including every single person
who affects the consumer’s experience with your offering.
Chapter 13 tells you how to suit up a team of brand champions within your
organization. Chapter 14 helps you ignite customer passion.
329
Chapter 20: Ten Truths about Branding

Brands Live in Consumers’ Minds
When people see or hear your name, they automatically conjure up impres-
sions and memories that determine what they believe about you. Their
notions may be the result of firsthand encounters with your product or 
organization. Their notions may be based on communications they’ve seen
or heard — anything from your ads to displays, signs, news articles, even
your logo on Little League hats. Their notions may result from secondhand
recaps of other customers’ experiences that are passed along online or by
word-of-mouth.
Regardless of whether the beliefs customers hold about you are many or few,
good or bad, or accurate or inaccurate, they comprise the image of your brand
in your customer’s mind and influence how your customer thinks and buys.
Your brand image lives in your customers’ minds whether you intentionally
put it there or not. Good branding is the way of making sure that the brand
image you have is the brand image you want.
Brand Names Unlock Brand Images
Your brand is a set of memories that’s uncovered when people see or hear
your name.
The right name establishes your brand from the day it’s announced, and it
grows with your business and your vision as you reach into new market
areas, new geographic regions, and even new product areas.
A great brand name should
 Reflect the brand character of your business
 Describe your offering and convey an association to the meaning of your
brand
 Convey or be consistent with your brand promise
 Be easy and pleasant to say and unique and memorable so that, over
time, it appreciates into an asset that you can harvest through premium
pricing, licensing, or even a sale to a new owner
Naming your brand is the most challenging, momentous, and necessary
phase in the process of branding. Count on Chapter 7 to walk you through
the steps involved.

Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Brand Experiences Trump 
Brand Messages
In branding, what you say pales in comparison to what you do.
When consumers gravitate to one brand over the others, their decisions are
rarely based on reactions to marketing messages alone. Instead, consumers
rely on their own experiences. They choose and stay with brands that they
believe will keep their promises based on what the customers have person-
ally seen and sensed.
To create a brand experience capable of moving markets and instilling loy-
alty, convey, reinforce, and amplify your brand promise through every
encounter with your organization — from the office of the CEO down and
from the first inquiry to the last service call. If one portion of the experience
falls short of consumer expectations — from one poorly handled phone call
to one erroneous invoice — your brand image suffers.
“Be the brand” isn’t just talk, it’s the key to branding success. To develop a
team of brand champions prepared to deliver a great brand experience and
to put your brand experience to the test, turn to Chapters 9 and 13.
Brands Need to Start and Stay Relevant
To win and keep a slot in the consumer’s mind, your brand needs to begin
and remain credible, competitive, current, and relevant to customer wants,
needs, and interests. That means you need to tune in to market conditions,
consumer preferences, and cultural trends not only when you first establish
your brand but also on a regular basis as your brand ages.
Markets change, and businesses change. When they do, brands that remain
stuck in times past pay a high price in terms of credibility and competitiveness.
Follow the advice in Chapter 4 to conduct customer and competitive research
before you launch your brand and afterward. Then use Chapter 17 as your
guide as you determine what kind of brand update may be in order — from
an evolutionary revitalization of your brand logo and look to a revolutionary,
full-scale rebranding following a major merger, acquisition, or redirected busi-
ness strategy.
331
Chapter 20: Ten Truths about Branding

Either way, the revised brand strategy that you adopt should represent your
brand vision for at least ten years, which is about the frequency that brands
should undergo major change.
Brands Are Valuable Assets
In the world’s most successful businesses, the brand is often the most valu-
able single asset. When companies with great brands are sold, the value of
the brand often accounts for as much as half of the sale price. Plus, brand
value translates into everyday economic benefits, including:
 Premium pricing and reduced price sensitivity
 Lower costs of sales and promotions
 Higher market share
 Reduced threat of competition
 Greater employee satisfaction
 Higher recognition by consumers, industry leaders, media, investors,
and analysts

the equity of your brand. Then check out Chapter 16 to find out how to pro-
tect your brand equity as you leverage your brand value into growth oppor-
tunities through brand extensions, licensing, and cobranding opportunities.

Chapter 21
Ten Branding Mistakes and 
How to Avoid Them
In This Chapter
 Establishing the right brand in the right way
 Doing what it takes to maintain your brand
S
ome brands get off to great starts. Some are wobbly from the get-go.
Others start well and then lose their way through lack of focus, disci-
pline, and follow-through on brand strategies, brand promises, and reliably
consistent brand experiences.
This chapter describes ten branding mistakes to steer clear of and provides
tips to keep your brand moving continuously in the right direction, con-
stantly gaining esteem and equity as a result.
Thinking of Branding as a Quick Fix
The mistake: When business is down, when consumer interest ebbs, or when
competition surges, the idea of branding pops up as some miracle cure for
transforming product perceptions and jump-starting success. In the heat of
the moment, otherwise cool-headed professionals begin to believe that a new
logo — and maybe even a new name, a new tagline, or a new marketing 
message — will serve as a remedy for all that ails the bottom line.
Those who look at branding as a marketing quick fix make the mistake of
thinking that a brand is just a cosmetic application. They think that a new
and improved brand identity will be the formula for a new and improved
brand image. It doesn’t work that way, though, because a successful brand
has to go all the way to the core of an organization.

The remedy: Before you create or alter the face of your brand, be sure you’re
creating an accurate reflection of what’s at the base of your brand. The part
of your brand that rises into public view — your name, logo, and marketing
materials — must mirror the mission, vision, values, culture, leadership, and
management that lies at the heart and soul of your organization. Otherwise, a
credibility crisis looms large.
Chapter 6 helps you define the essence of your organization and how it oper-
ates and then guides your thinking as you put your brand promise, brand
character, and brand identity into words. Then, and only then, are you ready
to name your brand, design your logo, and create marketing materials and a
brand experience to convey your brand accurately and successfully in your
world. The process isn’t quick, but it’s worth it!
Starting with a Weak Identity
The mistake: Weak identities reveal themselves on first sight. They appear in
the form of names that limit the scope and success of the brands they repre-
sent. Or they’re displayed as logos that, at-a-glance, convey that they were
created on shoestring budgets by organizations with little chance of compet-
ing with big, established businesses.
As long as the businesses represented by weak names and logos are satisfied
to remain in the confines that their identities dictate, all’s well. But if they
want to expand into new product lines, new market arenas, or new competi-
tive spheres, their weak identities are heavy anchors dragging down their
success.
The remedy: Invest the time and money required to develop a strong name
and logo when you first establish your brand. Remember these points:
 In most cases, your name will live as long as your business does, so
choose, register, and protect a name that you can grow with over
years and decades. Great brand names travel through time, trends, mar-
kets, and even strategic redirections. Settle on a name that conveys your
brand promise, supports your brand image, and that’s unique, pleasant
to say, and easy to recall — all without confining your brand to a specific
product or market area. (Chapter 7 has naming advice.)
 Your logo will become the immediately identifiable face of your
brand, so make it a strong, simple, unique design that reproduces well
in all forms of communication and scales up and down in size to look
good on anything from business cards to giant signs. Chapter 8 pro-
vides a guide to logo design along with the strong recommendation that
you seek professional design assistance. When the time’s right to update
your look, turn to Chapter 17 for tips on how to revitalize your logo so
that it remains a contemporary representation of your brand.
334
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Forgetting the Rule of One
The mistake: Businesses that barely have the budgets and marketing staff
required to build one brand try to build two or three or more. In doing so,
they dilute the expertise and funding they can devote to any one and build
brand strength for none.
The remedy: Unless you’re sure that you have the marketing budget and
expertise required to build and support multiple brands, stick to the Rule of
One: Build one brand for your business rather than a business full of many
brands. Apply the Rule of One by following this advice:
 Build a single brand that can preside over all your offerings.
 Introduce each new product or service as an offering under your one-
and-only brand. This strategy allows each new product to capitalize
upon the credibility of your brand while boosting the strength of your
brand through the success of each new offering.
 Wipe the term subbrand from your branding vocabulary. Turn to
Chapter 16 for information on how subbrands confuse customers
and weaken brand management.
Chapter 2 has tips on how to manage a number of products under your 
one brand, and Chapter 7 can help you develop a family of names under a
single brand umbrella. Chapter 16 branches out with tips on how to extend your
brand to new products, cobranded offerings, and licensing opportunities.
If you decide to create separate brands for individual products or services,
build a separate business unit for each new brand. Separate business units
allow each offering to stand on its own, drawing on its own resources and
building independent value that you can spin off or sell in the future.
Failing to Differentiate
The mistake: If you can’t tell customers what you do best, they have no
reason to choose your offering. If you don’t give them a clear reason to
choose your product, they opt for a different, more distinct solution. And if
they think that all available offerings deliver the same value and quality, they
simply buy whatever’s available at the lowest price.
The remedy: Find a distinguishing characteristic that causes your offering to
excel over available alternatives, and build your brand around that point of
difference. To differentiate your brand
335
Chapter 21: Ten Branding Mistakes and How to Avoid Them

 Determine unique aspects of your offering that address genuine market
interests or needs.
 Develop a brand identity and brand message to achieve awareness of
the unique values consumers receive only when they work with your
business or buy your product.
 Reinforce your point of difference every time consumers come into con-
tact with your name, your product, your staff, or your brand experience.
Chapter 5 can help you find your brand’s unique position in the marketplace,
and Chapter 14 covers delivering your point of difference at every consumer
contact point.
Failing to Launch
The mistake: Even business owners that love groundbreakings, ribbon cut-
tings, grand openings, and lavish celebrations underestimate the importance
of staging a brand launch. Either they simply start using a new brand identity
and call it a launch, or they invest in a formal marketplace launch of the
brand before they take the time to gain brand understanding and buy-in
within their own organizations.
If you fail to launch your brand, you lose a great one-time opportunity to make
news with your brand identity, point of difference, promise, and message.
If you fail to launch internally first, you lose the chance to unite your team
behind the brand. As a result, you almost certainly set your organization up
for lapses in delivery of a great and consistent brand experience simply
because a good many of your employees don’t understand what in the world
your brand’s all about.
The remedy: Launch your brand from the inside out, bringing every aspect of
your business into alignment with your brand promise, personality, and char-
acter before you raise the curtain and introduce your brand in your market-
place (see Chapter 9). Chapters 10, 11, and 12 are full of information on how to
take your brand public via publicity, advertising, and online communications.
Failing to Protect and Defend
The mistake: Brand owners get complacent. They think that ironclad protec-
tive measures aren’t necessary to protect their brands from infringement or
misuse, so they fail to obtain or defend trademarks, lock up domain names,
write brand usage guidelines, or enforce their own brand usage rules when
they’re broken. Before long, brand names are in jeopardy, brand consistency
is at risk, and brand value plummets.
336
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

The remedy: Protect your brand in three important ways:
1. File your name with appropriate government offices, and obtain
brand trademarks if your sphere of business crosses state or national
boundaries.
2. Establish, adopt, and enforce usage guidelines so that those within or
outside your organization don’t tamper with your brand identity.
3. Enforce your rules by following up on every brand usage infraction,
without fail.
If you don’t follow up on infractions, the least that can happen is erosion
of the strength of your brand presentation. The worst that can happen is
loss of your trademarks due to your own abandonment or complacency.
Check out Chapter 18 for step-by-step advice to follow in order to defend
your brand.
Believing That What You Say Is More
Important Than What You Do
The mistake: Even with the best name and logo, the most awesome brand
launch, and brand marketing materials that win best-of-show in all creative
competitions, brands suffer if they don’t live up to their promises and deliver
the kind of products and service that create loyal and passionate consumers.
The remedy: Realize that your brand is either made or broken not by what
you say but by what you do. Consumers base their brand impressions upon
the caliber and consistency of their experiences with the brand. To establish
and maintain the kind of brand experience that builds passion, loyalty, and
brand value, follow the advice in Chapter 14 and take these steps:
1. Identify every possible point of contact between your brand and 
your consumer, from pre-purchase encounters through the purchase
experience and product usage, to post-purchase communications and
customer service.
2. Evaluate each point of contact to see that you present your brand mes-
sage, promise, look, and tone without fail and with total consistency.
3. Identify and correct any points of contact where the brand experience
falls even slightly short of your brand promise.
4. Regularly audit your brand experience to insure against brand-
eroding communication or service lapses.
337
Chapter 21: Ten Branding Mistakes and How to Avoid Them

Underestimating the Value 
of Consistency
The mistake: Brand owners get bored. They get tired of their looks and mes-
sages, so they start improvising. They fiddle with their identities, putting
some additional color here or there, adding a new tagline, maybe even
embellishing their names or revising their logo designs. They try out new per-
sonalities in their marketing messages, sampling humorous approaches when
they’ve always been staid and serious in the past, or trying to look or sound
hip instead of keeping their usual conventional tone.
Just like that, consistency goes out the window along with the ability to convey
the brand’s identity and promise with the kind of clarity that inspires confi-
dence in everyone from employees to consumers to investors and others.
The remedy: To build and maintain a strong brand, you have to be consis-
tent, and to be consistent, you have to
 Insist that your logo appear exactly the same every single time it’s repro-
duced, with no exceptions in typestyle, color, design, placement of the
tagline, or presentation of every other element that contributes to the
brand identity consumers know and count on (see Chapter 8).
 Put your brand promise into words (see Chapter 6) and then make sure
it’s kept at every point of encounter with your brand, whether with cus-
tomers, employees, suppliers, associates, or prospects. Only by staying
true to your word and consistently upholding your promise can you
build trust and loyalty.
 Define and stay true to your brand character, which is the look and tone
that conveys the personality of your organization.
 Create a set of brand usage guidelines to be followed by everyone who
produces marketing materials for your business, and then name a brand
cop to keep everyone’s efforts in line (see Chapter 19).
If your brand needs updating, don’t do it in a haphazard or ad hoc fashion.
Take formal action, following the brand revitalization process outlined in
Chapter 17.
Asking Your Brand to Stretch Too Far
The mistake: When a good brand extends its name to an iffy product or to a
product that contradicts the brand message and promise or that erodes the
emotional connection that the brand enjoys with consumers, the brand ends
up hurting itself in the process of trying to help the launch of the new offering.
338
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

The remedy: Leveraging a brand name is a smart, lucrative action as long as
the new offering is consistent with your brand message and promise and
capable of deepening the emotional connection you’ve established with your
customers.
When extending your brand, stay within your established product category
or only move into categories that are very compatible with your established
offering. Extend your brand only to new products that match up with con-
sumer expectations of your brand in terms of quality, market position, and
brand promise.
Be careful that your new offering isn’t so similar to an existing offering that it
confuses consumers, causing them to buy your new product instead of your
established product (called cannibalization) or leading to selection dilemmas
that result in no purchase at all.
Leveraging your brand into new product or market categories is one of the
most valued perks of brand development. It allows you capitalize on the rep-
utation you’ve built over time and apply it to new ventures that benefit from
instant awareness and competitive advantage. Chapter 16 provides a good
overview for how to seize brand extension opportunities without stretching
your name to the breaking point.
Ignoring Brand Aging Signs
The mistake: Some brands get stuck in times past, and the brand owners are
the last ones to notice. They’re so busy fending off competitors and working
to attract and keep business that they fail to notice when their brand identi-
ties no longer reflect the essence of their businesses, when their brand identi-
ties become out of step with current tastes and trends, or when their brand
experiences become outdated, erratic, or otherwise unable to compete well
in the contemporary environment.
The remedy: On a regular basis, a great brand undergoes the equivalent of a
physical to see if it’s experiencing any early warning signs that its age is start-
ing to affect its health. Chapter 17 outlines all the symptoms to watch for in
giving your brand a checkup, including:
 Major ownership or leadership changes that affect your mission, vision,
values, or strategic direction
 Major changes to your product line or distribution channels
 Major changes to your market situation, including significantly
increased competition or major shifts in consumer preferences and
behaviors
339
Chapter 21: Ten Branding Mistakes and How to Avoid Them

 A merger or acquisition
 A brand that no longer reflects your changed business and market
 A brand message, experience, or identity that’s become dated and out of
synch with cultural trends and consumer interests and tastes
Some brand situations benefit from minor cosmetic repair and message
realignment, whereas others require more significant revitalization or even
total rebranding. Turn to Chapter 17 for help as you conduct a brand assess-

Chapter 22
Ten Traits of the World’s 
Most Valuable Brands
In This Chapter
 Recognizing the most valuable brands when you see them
 Aiming to share the common traits of valuable brands
E
ach year, Interbrand, a global branding consultancy, and BusinessWeek
magazine publish a ranking of the best global brands by value. The study
is widely considered the most significant and influential brand and marketing
survey. The 2006 report concluded that the following brands are the most
valuable in the world:
#1 Coca-Cola
#11 Citi
#2 Microsoft
#12 Marlboro
#3 IBM
#13 Hewlett-Packard
#4 GE
#14 American Express
#5 Intel
#15 BMW
#6 Nokia
#16 Gillette
#7 Toyota
#17 Louis Vuitton
#8 Disney
#18 Cisco
#9 McDonald’s
#19 Honda
#10 Mercedes-Benz
#20 Samsung
The traits that the Interbrand/BusinessWeek report found common to every
brand on this list are summarized in this chapter.
As you dive into the branding process, prepare yourself to encounter the
same conversation over and over. People will ask what you’re doing, and
when you say that you’re developing a brand or managing a branding pro-
gram, they’ll give you a blank stare and ask (we know, we’ve heard it for
years), “A brand? You mean like on a horse or cow?” Here’s what to say: “No.
A brand like on the products that you know and trust more than all others.”

Then reel off the names of any of the brands in the preceding list. People will
immediately recognize the names and begin to understand why you’re devot-
ing your efforts to build even a fraction of the awareness, credibility, and rep-
utations these companies enjoy.
Instilling your brand with the ten traits in this chapter will put you well on
your way.
Simple, Powerful Differentiation
A great brand holds a unique place in the minds of those who buy from, work
for, or invest in the brand, whether financially or emotionally.
Great brands differentiate themselves in a way that’s clear, easy to explain,
and meaningful to consumers and all other stakeholders. They hold a unique
position in the market because they provide benefits that no competitors can
match.
To find and fill your position in the market and in your consumers’ minds,
turn to Chapters 4 and 5.
A Clear and Compelling Vision
Brands are built from the inside out. That means they originate in companies
with clearly established mission, vision, and values statements that drive all
organization and branding decisions. Then they express their beliefs in every-
thing they say and do, from the products and services they offer to the staff
they attract to the advertising and communications they send into the 
marketplace.
As you develop or dust off the mission, vision, and values that steer your
organization, turn to Chapter 6.
A Promise Consumers Want and Believe
People get emotionally attached to brands that fill unmet or unaddressed
wants and needs consistently and without fail. The greatest brands symbolize
solutions that consumers want, need, understand, and believe in.
To write your brand promise, turn to Chapter 6.
342
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Distinctive, Reliable, Superior 
Products and Services
Great brands deliver great products. They excel in product design, produc-
tion, and packaging; they’re known for superb communications; and they’re
heralded for excellent service before and after the sale.
To see that your product and service is consistent with the vision of your
organization and the promise you make to consumers, turn to Chapter 4 for
help conducting research.
A Strong, Memorable Brand Identity
Look at the list of great brands at the beginning of this chapter. Just seeing
the names should unlock images in your mind of each brand’s logo and possi-
bly tagline, musical signature, and ad look as well. That’s because each great
brand puts forth a brand identity that’s simple, strong, memorable, and pre-
sented without variation on every product, in every market, through every
communication, and at every consumer contact point.
Chapters 7 and 8 offer advice on developing a great identity for your brand.
A Single, Consistently Presented 
Brand Message
A distinct and compelling brand message is at the heart of all great brand
communications, regardless of the communication format or medium.
Whether you encounter a great brand through its product or packaging, its
print or broadcast ads, its online presence, or in person through a business
experience, the character of the brand is always consistent, and the core
brand message never varies.
Chapter 6 offers advice for putting your brand character and definition into
words, and the chapters in Part III are full of tips for sending a consistent
message into the marketplace, whether via public relations, advertising, pro-
motions, or online communications.
An Amazing Brand Experience
So what’s an amazing brand experience? It’s an experience that positively
reinforces the brand message and promise at every single point of consumer
343
Chapter 22: Ten Traits of the World’s Most Valuable Brands

encounter. Great brand experiences start at the very first impression and
continue without fail through the purchase deliberation, the buying process,
and after the sale when awesome service generates the kind of customer
brand passion that cements customer-brand relationships for life.
Turn to Chapter 14 for help putting your brand experience to the test.
Brand Allegiance from the Top Down
Great brands are built from the top down and from the inside out. Find a
great brand (the list in this chapter puts 20 right in front of your eyes), and
you’ll find a business that’s headed by a brand champion and staffed by a
team of brand fans.
To develop high allegiance and commitment to your brand, start with those
in the highest leadership and ownership positions and continue through to
every staff person who has an impact on your product, promise, and brand
experience. See Chapter 13 for advice.
Adaptability to Changing Times
Strong brands remain strong even as they migrate to new geographic areas,
into new consumer groups, and through changing economic times and
market conditions. In spite of changes in the competitive arena, economic
conditions, consumer interests, or market trends, they stay relevant to con-
sumer needs, interests, and tastes.
See Chapter 4 for help researching your brand’s relevance, and flip to
Chapter 17 for help revitalizing your brand if an update is in order.
Focus, Passion, and Persistence
The final common trait of those who build great brands: They have disci-
pline, persistence, and long-term commitments to their brands. Those who
get bored with their brands and start sampling with new marketplace posi-
tions, new points of distinction, new looks, and new variations on their brand
promises never reach the league of great and valuable brands. The prize of
sky-high brand equity goes only to those who stick to their brand messages
and propositions with unwavering loyalty. Repetition may be boring, but it
builds brands, and brands build value.
