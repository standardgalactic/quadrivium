Author’s Acknowledgments
I’m deeply grateful to everyone at Wiley Publishing who helped produce this
book. Their professionalism, courtesy, and good humor were much appreci-
ated. I supplied some words, and the editors and production staff at Wiley
molded them into the finished product.
Out of the blue, I got a call in 1996 from Kathy Welton, then Vice President
and Publisher for the Consumer Publishing Group of the For Dummies books.
Kathy asked if I’d be interested in doing this book. It didn’t take me very long
to say yes. Thank you again, Kathy!
I can’t say enough nice things about Pam Mourouzis, who was project editor
on the first edition of the book. The book is immensely better for her insights
and advice. The two copyeditors on the book —  Diane Giangrossi and Joe
Jansen — did a wonderful job. Mary Metcalfe provided valuable suggestions
on the manuscript. Thanks to Holly McGuire and Jill Alexander who encour-
aged me to revise the book. The second edition benefited from the editing by
Norm Crampton and Ben Nussbaum.
I thank Stacy Kennedy, acquisitions editor, for asking me to do this and the
previous revision. Joan Friedman was the project editor on this and the 
previous edition. Evidently, Wiley assigned me the best editor they have.
Joan kept a steady hand on the tiller as we sailed through the choppy waters
of the revisions. Joan was a delight to work with, and it goes without saying
that she made the book much better. Thank you most sincerely Joan, and I
hope to work with you again on the next revision.
One reason I like to write books goes back to an accounting class in my
undergraduate days at Creighton University in Omaha. I took a course taught
by the Dean of the Business School, Dr. Floyd Walsh. I turned in a term paper,
and he said that it was very well written. I have never forgotten that compli-
ment. I think my old Prof would be proud of this book and might even give me
an “A” on the assignment.

Introduction
You may know individuals who make their living as accountants. You may
be thankful that they’re the accountants and you’re not. You may prefer
to leave accounting to the accountants, and think that you don’t need to know
anything about accounting. This attitude reminds me of the old Greyhound
Bus advertising slogan “Leave the Driving to Us.” Well, if you could get around
everywhere you wanted to go on the bus, that would be okay. But if you have
to drive most places, you’d better know something about autos. You do a lot
of “financial driving,” so you should know something about accounting as well.
Sure, accounting involves numbers. So does watching your car mileage,
knowing your vital health statistics, keeping track of your bank balance,
negotiating the interest rate on your home mortgage, monitoring your retire-
ment fund, and bragging about your kid’s grade point average. You deal with
numbers all the time. Accountants provide financial numbers. These numbers
are very important in your financial life. Knowing nothing about financial
numbers puts you at a serious disadvantage. In short, financial literacy
requires a working knowledge of accounting.
About This Book
This book, like all For Dummies books, consists of freestanding chapters. Each
chapter is like a tub standing on its own feet. You can read the chapters in any
order you please. You can tailor your reading plan to give priority to the chap-
ters of most interest to you, and read other chapters as time permits. Of course,
you could start on page 1 and continue straight through until the last page.
The choice is yours.
I’ve written this book for a wide audience. You may be a small business man-
ager who already has experience with financial statements, for example, but
you need to know more about how to use accounting information in analyzing
your profit performance and cash flow. Or, you may be an investor who needs
to know more about financial statements, so your chief interest probably will
be the chapters that explain those statements.

This book offers several advantages:
 I explain accounting in plain English with a minimum of jargon and
technical details.
 I carefully follow a step-by-step approach in explaining topics.
 I include only topics that non-accountants should understand; I avoid
topics that only practicing accountants have to know.
 I include frank discussions of certain sensitive topics, which go
unmentioned in many accounting books.
I should emphasize one thing: This book is not an accounting textbook.
Introductory accounting textbooks are ponderous, dry as dust, and overly
detailed (in my judgment). However, textbooks have one advantage: They
include exercises and problems. You can learn much by reading this book. If
you have the time, you can gain additional insights and test your understand-
ing of accounting by working the exercises in my Accounting Workbook For
Dummies (Wiley).
Conventions Used in This Book
Learning accounting requires learning the fundamentals of financial statements.
You get accounting information in other forms of communication (in bank state-
ments and in business newspaper articles, for example), but financial statements
occupy center stage. To understand financial statements you don’t have to
be an expert. But you should know how to extract the main messages from
financial statements. Serious investors, investment analysts, lenders, and
business managers, in particular, need a sure grip on financial statements.
Financial statements are presented according to established (one could say
entrenched) conventions. Uniform styles and formats for reporting financial
statements have evolved over the years and become generally accepted. The
conventions for financial statement reporting can be compared to the design
rules for highway signs and traffic signals. Without standardization there
would be a lot of accidents.
I present financial statements throughout the book. Therefore, I want to take
a moment now to explain the conventions for reporting financial statements.
To illustrate these points I use the following example of an income statement
for a business. Note: This business example is organized as a pass-through
entity for income tax purposes and, therefore, does not itself pay income tax.
(I discuss pass-through entities in Chapter 8.)

Accounting For Dummies, 4th Edition 

Income Statement for Year
Sales revenue
$5,218,000
Cost of goods sold expense
$3,267,000
Gross margin
$1,951,000
Selling, general, and 
$1,484,000
administrative expenses
Operating profit
$467,000
Interest expense
$186,000
Net income
$281,000
Here are the conventions to keep in mind:
 It may seem obvious, but you read a financial statement from the top
down. Sales revenue is listed first, which is the total income from the
sale of products and services during the period before expenses in the
period are deducted. If the main revenue stream of the business is from
selling products, the first expense deducted from sales revenue is cost of
goods sold, as in this example.
Deducting the cost of goods sold expense from sales revenue gives gross
margin (also called gross profit). The number of other expense lines in an
income statement varies from business to business. Before interest
expense is deducted, the standard practice is to show operating profit
(also called operating earnings), which is profit before interest expense.
 An amount that is deducted from another amount — such as the cost of
goods sold expense — may be placed in parentheses to indicate that it is
being subtracted from the amount above it. Alternatively, the accountant
who prepares the financial statement may assume that readers know that
expenses are deducted from sales revenue, so no parentheses are put
around the number. You see expenses presented both ways in financial
reports, but you hardly ever see a minus (negative) sign in front of
expenses.
 Notice the use of dollar signs in the income statement example. In the
illustration all amounts have a dollar sign prefix. However, financial
reporting practices vary quite a bit on this matter. The first number in a
column always has a dollar sign, but from here down it’s a matter of per-
sonal preference.
 To indicate that a calculation is being done, a single underline is drawn
under a number, as you see under the $3,267,000 cost of goods sold
expense number in the example. This means that the expense amount is
being subtracted from sales revenue. The number below the underline,
therefore, is a calculated amount.
3
Introduction

Note that there are three calculated amounts in the example: $1,951,000
gross margin; $467,000 operating profit; and, $281,000 net income.
 Dollar amounts in a column are always aligned to the right, as your see
in the income statement example. Trying to read down a jagged column
of numbers that are not right-aligned would be asking too much; the
reader might develop vertigo.
 In the income statement example, dollar amounts are rounded to the
nearest thousand for ease of reading, which is why you see all zeros in
the last three places of each number. Really big businesses round off to
the nearest million and drop the last six digits. The accountant could
have dropped off the last three digits in the income statement, but prob-
ably wouldn’t in most cases.
Many accountants don’t like rounding off amounts reported in a finan-
cial statement, so you see every amount carried out to the last dollar,
and sometimes even to the last penny. However, this gives a false sense
of precision. Accounting for business transactions cannot be accurate
down to the last dollar; this is nonsense. The late Kenneth Boulding, a
well-known economist, once quipped that accountants would rather be
precisely wrong than approximately correct. Ouch! That stings because
there’s a strong element of truth behind the comment.
 The final number in a column typically is double underlined, as you see
for the $281,000 bottom-line profit number in the income statement. This
is about as carried away as accountants get in their work — a double
underline. Instead of a double underline for a bottom-line number, it may
appear in bold.
There’s one more convention I need to mention: I give several Web addresses
(URLs) in this book. Some need to break across two lines of text. If this is the
case, rest assured that I haven’t put in any extra characters (such as hyphens)
to indicate the break. So, when using one of these Web addresses, just type in
exactly what you see in this book, pretending as though the line break doesn’t
exist.
What You’re Not To Read
While you’re reading, I assume you’re on the edge of your seat and can hardly
wait to get to the next exciting sentence. Well, perhaps I get more pumped up
about accounting than you. So, one question you may have is this: Do I really
have to read every sentence in the book? To be honest, you can skip the para-
graphs marked with the Technical Stuff icon. You can simply leapfrog over these
sections without missing a beat. If you have time, you can return to these topics
4
Accounting For Dummies, 4th Edition 

later. Also, the sidebars in the chapters are interesting, but not essential for
understanding the topics at hand. Sidebars are like when you say in a conver-
sation, “By the way, did you know . . . ?”
There’s reading, and then there’s remembering what you read. You should read
the examples I use throughout the book, but you don’t have to remember the
numbers in each example. For instance, consider the income statement example
in the previous section. You should understand that the bottom-line profit is the
amount remaining after all expenses are deducted from sales revenue. But, of
course, you don’t need to remember the specific amount of the bottom-line profit
in the example.
Foolish Assumptions
Although I assume that you have a basic familiarity with the business world, I
take nothing for granted regarding how much accounting you know. Even if
you have some experience with accounting and financial statements, I think
you’ll find this book useful.
I have written this book with a wide audience in mind. You should find yourself
more than once in the following list of potential readers:
 Accountants to be: This book is a good first step for anyone considering
a career in professional accounting.
 Active investors: Investors in marketable securities, real estate, and other
ventures need to know how to read financial statements backward and
forward.
 Passive investors: Many people let the pros manage their money by
investing in mutual funds or using investment advisors to handle their
money; even so, they need to understand the investment performance
reports they get, which use plenty of accounting terms and measures.
 People who want to take control of their personal finances: Many
aspects of managing your personal finances involve the accounting
vocabulary and accounting-based calculation methods.
 Business managers (at all levels): Trying to manage a business without
a good grip on financial statements can lead to disaster. How can you
manage the financial performance of your business if you don’t even
understand the financial statements of your business?
 Anyone interested in following economic, business, and financial
news: Articles in The Wall Street Journal and other financial news
sources are heavy with accounting terms and measures.
5
Introduction

 Administrators and managers of government and not-for-profit entities:
Although making profit is not the goal of these entities, the focus is still
on the bottom line because the entity has to stay within its revenue
limits and keep on a sound financial footing.
 Politicians at local, state, and federal levels: These men and women
pass many laws having significant financial consequences, and the better
they understand accounting, the better their votes should be (we hope).
 Bookkeepers: Strengthening their knowledge of accounting should
improve their effectiveness and value to the organization.
 Entrepreneurs: As budding business managers, they need a solid grasp
of accounting basics.
 Business buyers and sellers: Anyone thinking of buying or selling a busi-
ness should know how to read its financial statements and how to “true
up” these accounting reports that serve as the basis for setting a market
value on the business.
 Investment bankers, institutional lenders, and loan officers: I don’t
really have to tell these folks that they need to understand accounting;
they already know.
 Business and finance professionals: This includes lawyers and financial
advisors, of course, but even clergy counsel their flock on financial matters
occasionally.
I could put others in the above list. But I think you get the idea that many dif-
ferent people need to understand the basics of accounting. Perhaps someone
who leads an isolated contemplative life and renounces all earthly possessions
does not need to know anything about accounting. But, then again, I don’t know.
How This Book Is Organized
This book is divided into parts, and each part is further divided into chap-
ters. The following sections describe what you can find in each part.
Part I: Opening the Books on Accounting
In Chapters 1 and 2, I introduce the three primary business financial state-
ments gradually, one step at a time. Rather than throwing you in the deep end
of the pool, hoping that you learn to swim before drowning in too many
details, I make sure you first learn to float and then move on to some basic
6
Accounting For Dummies, 4th Edition 

strokes. The information for financial statements comes from the bookkeeping
system of the entity. The financial statements of an entity are no more reliable
and accurate than the reliability and accuracy of its bookkeeping system —
and the integrity of the company’s management, of course. So, in Chapter 3, I
offer a brief overview of bookkeeping and accounting systems. You could jump
over this chapter, if you must. But I recommend at least a quick read.
Part II: Figuring Out Financial Statements
In Part II, I complete the explanations of the three primary financial state-
ments of businesses (see Chapters 4, 5, and 6). In Chapter 7, I explain that
businesses are not in a straitjacket when it comes to deciding which account-
ing methods to use for recording their revenue and expenses. They can select
from two or more equally acceptable methods for recording certain revenues
and expenses. The choice of accounting methods affects the values recorded
for assets and liabilities.
Part III: Accounting in 
Managing a Business
To start a business and begin operations, its founders must first decide on
which legal structure to use. Chapter 8 explains the legal entities for carrying
on business activities. Each has certain advantages and disadvantages, and
each is treated differently under the income tax law.
Chapter 9 explains an extraordinarily important topic: designing an account-
ing report template that serves as a good profit model, one that focuses on
the chief variables that drive profit and changes in profit. A hands-on profit
model is essential for decision-making analysis. A manager depends on the
profit model to determine the effects of changes in sales prices, sales volume,
product costs, and the other fundamental factors that drive profit.
In Chapter 10, I discuss accounting-based planning and control techniques,
through the lens of budgeting. Managers in manufacturing businesses should
be wary of how product costs are determined, as Chapter 11 explains. The
chapter also explains other economic and accounting cost concepts relevant
to business managers.
7
Introduction

Part IV: Preparing and Using 
Financial Reports
In Part IV, I first explain how a financial report is put together (see Chapter 12).
Next I discuss how investors and lenders read financial statements (see
Chapter 13). Business managers need more information than is included in an
external financial report to investors and lenders. In Chapter 14, I survey the
additional information that managers need.
I close this part of the book with a chapter that explains audits of financial
statements by CPAs and the very serious problems of accounting and finan-
cial reporting fraud (see Chapter 15). If there were no Enrons in the world,
things would be a lot simpler. I hate to say it, but the next Enron is just wait-
ing to happen. Unfortunately, you can’t necessarily depend on audits to dis-
cover accounting fraud.
Part V: The Part of Tens
In the For Dummies style, I close the book with a pair of chapters in “The Part
of Tens.” I condense the main lessons from the book’s chapters into two lists
of ten vital points each. Chapter 16 reviews ten important ways business man-
agers should use accounting information. Chapter 17 gives business investors
handy tips for getting the most out of reading a financial report — tips on how
to be efficient in reading a financial report and the key factors to focus on.
Glossary
The accounting terminology in financial statements is a mixed bag. Many terms
are straightforward, but accountants also use esoteric terms that you don’t see
outside of financial statements. Sometimes it must seem like accountants are
speaking a foreign language. I must admit that accountants use jargon more
than they should. In some situations accountants resort to arcane terminology
to be technically correct, much like lawyers use arcane terminology in filing law-
suits and drawing up contracts.
Where I use jargon in the book, I pause and clarify what the terms mean in plain
English. Also, I present a helpful glossary at the end of the book that can assist
you on your accounting safari. This glossary provides quick access to succinct
definitions of key accounting and financial terms, with relevant commentary
and an occasional editorial remark. This is better than your average glossary.

Icons Used in This Book
This icon points out especially important ideas and accounting concepts that
are particularly deserving of your attention. The material marked by this 
icon describes concepts that are the undergirding and building blocks of
accounting — concepts that you should be very clear about and that clarify
your understanding of accounting principles in general.
I use this icon sparingly; it refers to very specialized accounting stuff that is
heavy going, which only a CPA could get really excited about. However, you
may find these topics important enough to return to when you have the time.
Feel free to skip over these points the first time through and stay with the
main discussion.
This icon calls your attention to useful advice on practical financial topics. It
saves you the cost of buying a yellow highlighter pen.
This icon is like a caution sign that warns you about speed bumps and pot-
holes on the accounting highway. Taking special note of this material can
steer you around a financial road hazard and keep you from blowing a fiscal
tire. In short — watch out!
Where to Go from Here
There’s no law against you starting on page 1 and reading through to the last
page. However, you may first want to scan the book’s Contents at a Glance
and see which chapters pique your interest.
Perhaps you’re an investor who is very interested in learning more about finan-
cial statements and the key financial statement ratios for investors. You might
start with Chapters 4, 5, and 6 which explain the three primary financial state-
ments of businesses, and finish with Chapter 13 on reading a financial report.
(And don’t overlook Chapter 17.)
Perhaps you’re a small business owner/manager with a basic understanding
of your financial statements, but you need to improve how you use account-
ing information for making your key profit decisions, and for planning and
controlling your cash flow. You might jump right into Chapters 9 and 10,
which explain the analysis of profit behavior and budgeting cash flows.
The book is not like a five-course dinner in which you have to eat in the order
the food is served to you. It’s more like a buffet line from which you can pick
and choose, and eat in whatever order you like.

In this part . . .
A
ccounting is essential in the worlds of business,
investing, finance, and taxes. In this part, you find
out why.
Accountants are the “information gatekeepers” in the
economy. Without accounting, a business couldn’t func-
tion, wouldn’t know whether it’s making a profit, and
would be ignorant of its financial situation. Accounting is
equally vital in managing the business affairs of not-for-
profit and governmental entities.
From its accounting records, a business prepares its 
financial statements, its tax returns, and the reports to its
managers. In financial reports to investors and lenders, a
business must obey authoritative accounting and financial
reporting standards. If not, its financial reports would be
misleading and possibly fraudulent, which could have dire
consequences.
Bookkeeping — the record-keeping part of accounting —
must be done well to ensure that the financial information
of a business is timely, complete, accurate, and reliable —
especially the numbers reported in its financial state-
ments and tax returns. Wrong numbers in financial
reports and tax returns can cause all sorts of trouble.

A
ccounting is all about financial information — capturing it, recording
it, configuring it, analyzing it, and reporting it to persons who use it. 
I don’t say much about how accountants capture, record, and configure fin-
ancial information in this book. But I talk a lot about how accountants commu-
nicate information in financial statements, and I explain the valuation methods
accountants use — ranging from measuring profit and loss to putting values
on assets and liabilities of businesses.
As you go through life, you come face to face with accounting information more
than you would ever imagine. Regretfully, much of this information is not self-
explanatory or intuitive, and it does not come with a user’s manual. Accounting
information is presented on the assumption that you have a basic familiarity
with the vocabulary of accounting and the accounting methods used to gener-
ate the information. In short, most of the accounting information you encounter
is not transparent. The main reason for studying accounting is to learn its
vocabulary and valuation methods, so you can make more intelligent use of the 
information.

14
Part I: Opening the Books on Accounting 
People who use accounting information should know the basic rules of play
and how the financial score is kept, much like spectators at a football or
baseball game. The purpose of this book is to make you a knowledgeable
spectator of the accounting game.
Let me point out another reason you should know accounting basics — I call
it the defensive reason. A lot of people out there in the cold, cruel financial world
may take advantage of you, not necessarily by illegal means but by withholding
key information and by diverting your attention from unfavorable aspects of
certain financial decisions. These unscrupulous characters treat you as a lamb
waiting to be fleeced. The best defense against such tactics is to know some
accounting, which can help you ask the right questions and understand the
financial points that con artists don’t want you to know.
Accounting Is Not Just for Accountants
One main source of accounting information is in the form of financial statements
that are packaged with other information in a financial report. Accountants keep
the books and record the financial activities of an entity (such as a business).
From these detailed records the accountant prepares financial statements that
summarize the results of the activities.
Financial statements are sent to people who have a stake in the outcomes of
the activities. If you own stock in General Electric, for example, or you have
money in a mutual fund, you receive regular financial reports. If you invest
your hard-earned money in a private business or a real estate venture, or you
save money in a credit union, you receive regular financial reports. If you are a
member of a nonprofit association or organization, you’re entitled to receive
regular financial reports.
In summary, one important reason for studying accounting is to make sense
of the financial statements in the financial reports you get. I guarantee that
Warren Buffett knows accounting and how to read financial statements. I sent
him a copy of my How To Read A Financial Report (Wiley). In his reply, he
said he planned to recommend it to his “accounting challenged” friends.
Affecting both insiders and outsiders
People who need to know accounting fall into two broad groups: insiders and
outsiders. Business managers are insiders; they have the authority and respon-
sibility to run a business. They need a good understanding of accounting terms
and the methods used to measure profit and put values on assets and liabilities.

Accounting information is indispensable for planning and controlling the finan-
cial performance and condition of the business. Likewise, administrators of
nonprofit and governmental entities need to understand the accounting termi-
nology and measurement methods in their financial statements.
The rest of us are outsiders. We are not privy to the day-to-day details of a busi-
ness or organization. We have to rely on financial reports from the entity to know
what’s going on. Therefore, we need to have a good grip on the financial state-
ments included in the financial reports. For all practical purposes, financial
reports are the only source of financial information we get directly from a busi-
ness or other organization.
By the way, the employees of a business — even though they obviously have
a stake in the success of the business — do not necessarily receive its finan-
cial reports. Only the investors in the business and its lenders are entitled to
receive the financial reports. Of course, a business could provide this informa-
tion to those of its employees who are not shareowners, but generally speaking
most businesses do not. The financial reports of public businesses are in the
public domain, so their employees can easily secure a copy. However, financial
reports are not automatically mailed to all employees of a public business.
In our personal financial lives, a little accounting knowledge is a big help for
understanding investing in general, how investment performance is mea-
sured, and many other important financial topics. With some basic account-
ing knowledge, you’ll sound much more sophisticated when speaking with
your banker or broker. I can’t promise you that learning accounting will save
you big bucks on your income taxes, but it can’t hurt and will definitely help
you understand what your tax preparer is talking about.
Keep in mind that this is not a book on bookkeeping and recordkeeping sys-
tems. I offer a brief explanation of procedures for capturing, processing, and
storing accounting information in Chapter 3. Even experienced bookkeepers
and accountants should find some nuggets in that chapter. However, this
book is directed to users of accounting information. I focus on the end prod-
ucts of accounting, particularly financial statements, and not how informa-
tion is accumulated. When buying a new car, you’re interested in the finished
product, not details of the manufacturing process that produced it.
Overcoming the stereotypes of accountants
I recently saw a cartoon in which the young son of clowns is standing in a circus
tent and is dressed as a clown, but he is holding a business briefcase. He is
telling his clown parents that he is running away to join a CPA firm. Why is this
funny? Because it plays off the stereotype of a CPA (certified public accountant)
15
Chapter 1: Accounting: The Language of Business, Investing, Finance, and Taxes

as a “bean counter” who wears a green eyeshade and has the personality of
an undertaker (no offense to morticians). Maybe you’ve heard the joke that
an accountant with a personality is one who looks at your shoes when he is
talking to you, instead his own shoes.
Like most stereotypes, there’s an element of truth in the preconceived image
of accountants. As a CPA and accounting professor for more than 40 years, I
have met and known a large number of accountants. Most accountants are
not as gregarious as used-car sales people (though some are). Accountants
certainly are more detail-oriented than your average person. However, you
don’t have to be good at mathematics to be a good accountant. Accountants
use very little math (no calculus and only simple algebra). Accountants are
very good at one thing: They want to see both sides of financial transactions:
the give and take. Accountants know better than anyone that, as economists
are fond of saying, there’s no such thing as a free lunch.
If you walked down a busy street in Chicago, New York, or Los Angeles, I
doubt that you could pick out the accountants. I have no idea whether
accountants have higher or lower divorce rates than others, whether they go
to church more frequently, whether most are Republicans or Democrats, or if
they generally sleep well at night. I do think that accountants are more
honest in paying their income taxes than other people, although I have no
proof of this.
Relating accounting to your 
personal financial life
I’m sure you know the value of learning personal finance and investing funda-
mentals. (I can recommend Personal Finance For Dummies and Investing For
Dummies by Eric Tyson, MBA, both published by Wiley.) Well, a great deal of
the information you use in making personal finance and investing decisions is
accounting information. One knock I have on books in these areas is that they
often don’t make clear that you need a basic understanding of accounting ter-
minology and valuation methods in order to make good use of the financial
information.
You have a stake in the financial performance of the business you work for,
the government entities you pay taxes to, the churches and charitable organi-
zations you donate money to, the retirement plan you participate in, the busi-
nesses you buy from, and the healthcare providers you depend on. The
financial performance and viability of these entities has a direct bearing on
your personal financial life and well-being.
16
Part I: Opening the Books on Accounting 

We’re all affected by the profit performance of businesses, even though we
may not be fully aware of just how their profit performance affects our jobs,
investments, and taxes. For example, as an employee your job security and
your next raise depend on the business making a profit. If the business suffers
a loss, you may be laid off or asked to take a reduction in pay or benefits.
Business managers get paid to make profit happen. If the business fails to
meet its profit objectives or suffers a loss, its managers may be replaced (or
at least not get their bonuses). As an author, I hope my publisher continues
to make profit so I can keep receiving my royalty checks.
Your investments in businesses, whether direct or through retirement accounts
and mutual funds, suffer if the businesses don’t turn a profit. I hope the
stores I trade with make profit and continue in business. The federal govern-
ment and many states depend on businesses making profit to collect income
taxes from them.
Looking for Accounting 
in All the Right Places
Accounting extends into virtually every walk of life. You’re doing accounting
when you make entries in your checkbook and when you fill out your federal
income tax return. When you sign a mortgage on your home, you should
understand the accounting method the lender uses to calculate the interest
amount charged on your loan each period. Individual investors need to
understand accounting basics in order to figure their return on invested capi-
tal. And it goes without saying that every organization, profit-motivated or
not, needs to know how it stands financially.
Here’s a quick sweep to give you an idea of the range of accounting:
 Accounting for organizations and accounting for individuals
 Accounting for profit-motivated businesses and accounting for nonprofit
organizations (such as hospitals, homeowners’ associations, churches,
credit unions, and colleges)
 Income tax accounting while you’re living and estate tax accounting
when you die
 Accounting for farmers who grow their products, accounting for miners
who extract their products from the earth, accounting for producers who
manufacture products, and accounting for retailers who sell products
that others make
17
Chapter 1: Accounting: The Language of Business, Investing, Finance, and Taxes

 Accounting for businesses and professional firms that sell services
rather than products, such as the entertainment, transportation, and
healthcare industries
 Past-historical-based accounting and future-forecast-oriented accounting
(budgeting and financial planning)
 Accounting where periodic financial statements are legally mandated
(public companies are the primary example) and accounting where such
formal accounting reports are not legally required
 Accounting that adheres to historical cost mainly (businesses) and account-
ing that records changes in market value (mutual funds, for example)
 Accounting in the private sector of the economy and accounting in the
public (government) sector
 Accounting for going-concern businesses that will be around for some
time and accounting for businesses in bankruptcy that may not be
around tomorrow
Accounting is necessary in a free-market, capitalist economic system. It’s
equally necessary in a centralized, government-controlled, socialist economic
system. All economic activity requires information. The more developed the
economic system, the more the system depends on information. Much of the
information comes from the accounting systems used by the businesses, insti-
tutions, individuals, and other players in the economic system.
Some of the earliest records of history are the accounts of wealth and trading
activity. The need for accounting information was a main incentive in the
development of the numbering system we use today. The history of account-
ing is quite interesting (but beyond the scope of this book).
Taking a Peek into the Back Office
Every business and not-for-profit entity needs a reliable bookkeeping system
(see Chapter 3). Keep in mind that accounting is a much broader term than
bookkeeping. For one thing, accounting encompasses the problems in mea-
suring the financial effects of economic activity. Furthermore, accounting
includes the function of financial reporting of values and performance mea-
sures to those that need the information. Business managers and investors,
and many other people, depend on financial reports for information about
the performance and condition of the entity.
18
Part I: Opening the Books on Accounting 

Bookkeeping refers to the process of accumulating, organizing, storing, and
accessing the financial information base of an entity, which is needed for two
basic purposes:
 Facilitating the day-to-day operations of the entity
 Preparing financial statements, tax returns, and internal reports to 
managers
Bookkeeping (also called recordkeeping) can be thought of as the financial
information infrastructure of an entity. Of course the financial information
base should be complete, accurate, and timely. Every recordkeeping system
needs quality controls built into it, which are called internal controls or inter-
nal accounting controls.
Accountants design the internal controls for the bookkeeping system, which
serve to minimize errors in recording the large number of activities that an
entity engages in over the period. The internal controls that accountants design
are also relied on to detect and deter theft, embezzlement, fraud, and dishonest
behavior of all kinds. In accounting, internal controls are the ounce of prevention
that is worth a pound of cure.
I explain internal controls in Chapter 3. Here, I want to stress the importance
of the bookkeeping system in operating a business or any other entity. These
back-office functions are essential for keeping operations running smoothly,
efficiently, and without delays and errors. This is a tall order, to say the least.
Most people don’t realize the importance of the accounting department in
keeping a business operating without hitches and delays. That’s probably
because accountants oversee many of the back-office functions in a business —
as opposed to sales, for example, which is front-line activity, out in the open and
in the line of fire. Go into any retail store, and you’re in the thick of sales activi-
ties. But have you ever seen a company’s accounting department in action?
Folks may not think much about these back-office activities, but they would
sure notice if those activities didn’t get done. On payday, a business had better
not tell its employees, “Sorry, but the accounting department is running a little
late this month; you’ll get your checks later.” And when a customer insists on
up-to-date information about how much he or she owes to the business, the
accounting department can’t very well say, “Oh, don’t worry, just wait a week
or so and we’ll get the information to you then.”
19
Chapter 1: Accounting: The Language of Business, Investing, Finance, and Taxes

Typically, the accounting department is responsible for the following:
 Payroll: The total wages and salaries earned by every employee every
pay period, which are called gross wages or gross earnings, have to be
calculated. Based on detailed private information in personnel files and
earnings-to-date information, the correct amounts of income tax, social
security tax, and several other deductions from gross wages have to be
determined.
Stubs, which report various information to employees each pay period,
have to be attached to payroll checks. The total amounts of withheld
income tax and social security taxes, plus the employment taxes
imposed on the employer, have to be paid to federal and state govern-
ment agencies on time. Retirement, vacation, sick pay, and other bene-
fits earned by the employees have to be updated every pay period.
In short, payroll is a complex and critical function that the accounting
department performs. Many businesses outsource payroll functions to
companies that specialize in this area.
 Cash collections: All cash received from sales and from all other sources
has to be carefully identified and recorded, not only in the cash account
but also in the appropriate account for the source of the cash received.
The accounting department makes sure that the cash is deposited in the
appropriate checking accounts of the business and that an adequate
amount of coin and currency is kept on hand for making change for cus-
tomers. Accountants balance the checkbook of the business and control
who has access to incoming cash receipts. (In larger organizations, the
treasurer may be responsible for some of these cash flow and cash-
handling functions.)
 Cash payments (disbursements): In addition to payroll checks, a business
writes many other checks during the course of a year — to pay for a
wide variety of purchases, to pay property taxes, to pay on loans, and to
distribute some of its profit to the owners of the business, for example.
The accounting department prepares all these checks for the signatures
of the business officers who are authorized to sign checks. The accounting
department keeps all the supporting business documents and files to
know when the checks should be paid, makes sure that the amount to be
paid is correct, and forwards the checks for signature.
 Procurement and inventory: Accounting departments usually are
responsible for keeping track of all purchase orders that have been
placed for inventory (products to be sold by the business) and all other
assets and services that the business buys — from postage stamps to
forklifts. A typical business makes many purchases during the course of
a year, many of them on credit, which means that the items bought are
received today but paid for later. So this area of responsibility includes
keeping files on all liabilities that arise from purchases on credit so that
cash payments can be processed on time. The accounting department
20
Part I: Opening the Books on Accounting 

also keeps detailed records on all products held for sale by the business
and, when the products are sold, records the cost of the goods sold.
 Property accounting: A typical business owns many different substan-
tial long-term assets called property, plant, and equipment — including
office furniture and equipment, retail display cabinets, computers, machin-
ery and tools, vehicles (autos and trucks), buildings, and land. Except for
relatively small-cost items, such as screwdrivers and pencil sharpeners, a
business maintains detailed records of its property, both for controlling the
use of the assets and for determining personal property and real estate
taxes. The accounting department keeps these property records.
The accounting department may be assigned other functions as well, but this
list gives you a pretty clear idea of the back-office functions that the account-
ing department performs. Quite literally, a business could not operate if the
accounting department did not do these functions efficiently and on time.
And to repeat one point: To do these back-office functions well the account-
ing department must design a good bookkeeping system and make sure that
it is accurate, complete, and timely.
Focusing on Transactions
Accounting focuses on transactions. A good bookkeeping system captures and
records every transaction that takes place without missing a beat. Transactions
are economic exchanges between a business or other entity and the parties
with which the entity interacts and makes deals. Transactions are the lifeblood
of every business, the heartbeat of activity that keeps it going. Understanding
accounting, to a large extent, means understanding how accountants record
the financial effects of transactions. The immediate and future financial
effects of some transactions can be difficult to determine.
A business carries on economic exchanges with six basic types of persons or
entities:
 Its customers, who buy the products and services that the business sells.
 Its employees, who provide services to the business and are paid wages
and salaries and provided with benefits, such as a retirement plan, med-
ical insurance, workers’ compensation, and unemployment insurance.
 Its suppliers and vendors, who sell a wide range of things to the busi-
ness, such as legal advice, products for resale, electricity and gas, tele-
phone service, computers, vehicles, tools and equipment, furniture, and
even audits.
21
Chapter 1: Accounting: The Language of Business, Investing, Finance, and Taxes

 Its debt sources of capital who loan money to the business, charge
interest on the amount loaned, and are due to be repaid at definite dates
in the future.
 Its equity sources of capital, the individuals and financial institutions
that invest money in the business and expect the business to earn profit
on the capital they invest.
 The government, or the federal, state, and local agencies that collect
income taxes, sales taxes, payroll taxes, and property taxes from the
business.
Figure 1-1 illustrates the interactions between the business and the other par-
ties in its economic exchanges.
Even a relatively small business generates a surprisingly large number of
transactions, and all transactions have to be recorded. Certain other events
that have a financial impact on the business have to be recorded as well. These
are called events because they’re not based on give-and-take bargaining —
unlike the something-given-for-something-received nature of economic
exchanges. Events such as the following have an economic impact on a busi-
ness and are recorded:
 A business may lose a lawsuit and be ordered to pay damages. The liability
to pay the damages is recorded.
 A business may suffer a flood loss that is uninsured. The waterlogged
assets may have to be written down, meaning that the recorded values
of the assets are reduced to zero if they no longer have any value to the
business. For example, products that were being held for sale to cus-
tomers (until they floated down the river) must be removed from the
inventory asset account.
 A business may decide to abandon a major product line and downsize
its workforce, requiring that severance compensation be paid to the laid-
off employees.
As I explain in more detail in Chapter 3, at the end of the year the accountant
makes a special survey to make sure that all events and developments during
the year that should be recorded have been recorded, so that the financial
statements and tax returns for the year are complete and correct.

Taking the Pulse of a Business: 
Financial Statements
I devote a good deal of space in this book to discussing financial statements.
In Chapter 2, I explain the fundamental information components of financial
statements, and then Part II gets into the nitty-gritty details. Here, I simply
want to introduce you to the three primary kinds of financial statements so
you know from the get-go what they are and why they’re so crucial.
Financial statements are prepared at the end of each accounting period. A
period may be one month, one quarter (three calendar months), or one year.
Financial statements report summary amounts, or totals. Accountants seldom
prepare a complete listing of the details of all the activities that took place during
a period, or the individual items making up a total amount. Business managers
occasionally need to search through a detailed list of all the specific transactions
that make up a total amount. When they want to drill down into the details, they
ask the accountant for the more detailed information. But this sort of detailed
listing is not a financial statement.
Outside investors in a business see only summary-level financial statements.
For example, investors see the total amount of sales revenue for the period
but not how much was sold to each and every customer.

Chapter 1: Accounting: The Language of Business, Investing, Finance, and Taxes

Meeting the balance sheet and 
the accounting equation
One type of accounting report is a “Where do we stand at the end of the
period?” type of report. This is called the statement of financial condition or,
more commonly, the balance sheet. The date of preparation is given in the
header, or title, above this financial statement.
A balance sheet shows two sides of the business, which I suppose you could
think of as the financial yin and yang of the business:
 Assets: On one side of the balance sheet the assets of the business are listed,
which are the economic resources owned and being used in the business.
The asset values reported in the balance sheet are the amounts recorded
when the assets were originally acquired — although I should mention that
an asset is written down below its historical cost when the asset has suffered
a loss in value. (And to complicate matters, some assets are written up to
their current fair values.) Some assets have been on the books only a few
weeks or a few months, so their reported historical values are current. The
values for other assets, on the other hand, are their costs when they were
acquired many years ago.
 Sources of assets: On the other side of the balance sheet is a breakdown
of where the assets came from, or their sources. Assets are not like manna
from the heavens. Assets come from two basically different sources: creditors
and owners. First, the creditors: Businesses borrow money in the form of
interest-bearing loans that have to be paid back at a later date, and they
buy things on credit that are paid for later. So, part of total assets can be
traced to creditors, which are the liabilities of a business. Second are the
owners: Every business needs to have owners invest capital (usually money)
in the business. Also, businesses retain part or all of the annual profits
they make, and profit increases the total assets of the business. The total
of invested capital and retained profit is called owners’ equity.
Suppose a business reports $2.5 million in total assets (without going into the
details of which particular assets the business holds). I know that the total of
its liabilities, plus the capital invested by its owners, plus its retained profit,
adds up to $2.5 million. Otherwise its books would be out of balance, which
means there are bookkeeping errors.
Continuing with this example, suppose that the total amount of the liabilities of
the business is $1.0 million. This means that the total amount of owners’ equity
in the business is $1.5 million, which equals total assets less total liabilities.
Without more information we don’t know how much of total owners’ equity is
traceable to capital invested by the owners in the business and how much is
the result of profit retained in the business. But we do know that the total of
these two sources of owners’ equity is $1.5 million.
24
Part I: Opening the Books on Accounting 

The financial condition of the business in this example is summarized in the
following accounting equation (in millions):
$2.5 assets = $1.0 liabilities + $1.5 owners’ equity
Looking at the accounting equation, you can see why the statement of financial
condition is called the balance sheet; the equal sign means the two sides balance.
Double-entry bookkeeping is based on the accounting equation — the fact
that the total of assets on the one side is counterbalanced by the total of lia-
bilities, invested capital, and retained profit on the other side. I discuss
double-entry bookkeeping in Chapter 3. Basically, double-entry bookkeeping
simply means that both sides of transactions are recorded. For example, if
one asset goes up, another asset goes down — or, alternatively, either a liabil-
ity or owners’ equity goes up. This is the economic nature of transactions.
Double-entry means two-sided, not that the transactions are recorded twice.
Reporting profit and loss, and cash flows
Other financial statements are different from the balance sheet in one impor-
tant respect: They summarize the flows of activities over the period. (An
example of a flow number is the total attendance at Colorado Rockies base-
ball games over its entire 82 home game regular season; the cumulative count
of spectators passing through the turnstiles over the season is the flow.)
Accountants prepare two types of financial flow reports for a business:
 The income statement summarizes the inflow from sales revenue and
income, which is offset by the outflows for the expense during the period.
Deducting expenses from revenue and income leads down to the well-
known bottom line, which is the final net profit or loss for the period and
is called net income or net loss (or some variation of these terms).
25
Chapter 1: Accounting: The Language of Business, Investing, Finance, and Taxes
A pop quiz
Here’s a teaser for you. If a business’s total
assets equal $2.5 million and its total liabilities
equal $1.0 million, we know that its total owners’
equity is $1.5 million. Question: Could the owners
have invested more than $1.5 million in the busi-
ness? Answer: Yes. One possibility is that the
owners invested $2.5 million but the business has
so far accumulated $1.0 million of losses instead
of making profit. The accumulated loss offsets
the amount invested, so the owners’ equity is
only $1.5 million net of its cumulative loss of $1.0
million. The $1.0 million of cumulative loss is
money down the rat hole. Owners bear the risk
that the business may be unable to make a profit.
A loss falls on the owners and, accordingly,
causes a decrease in the owners’ equity amount
reported in the balance sheet.

Alternative titles for this financial statement are the statement of operations
and the statement of earnings. Inside a business, but not in its external
financial reports, the income statement is commonly called the profit
and loss statement, or P&L report.
 The statement of cash flows summarizes the business’s cash inflows
and outflows during the period. The accounting profession has adopted
a three-way classification of cash flows for external financial reporting:
cash flows from making sales and incurring expenses; cash flows from
investing in assets and selling assets; and cash flows from raising capital
from debt and equity sources, returning capital to these sources, and
making distributions from profit to owners.
Respecting the importance of this trio
I explain more about the three primary financial statements (balance sheet,
income statement, and statement of cash flows) in Chapter 2. They constitute
the hard core of a financial report to those persons outside a business who
need to stay informed about the business’s financial affairs. These individuals
have invested capital in the business, or the business owes them money;
therefore, they have a financial interest in how well the business is doing.
The managers of a business, to keep informed about what’s going on and the
financial position of the business, also use these three key financial statements.
They are absolutely essential in helping managers control the performance of a
business, identify problems as they come up, and plan the future course of a busi-
ness. Managers also need other information that is not reported in the three basic
financial statements. (In Part III of this book, I explain these additional reports.)
The three primary financial statements constitute a business’s financial
center of gravity. The president and chief executive officer of a business (plus
other top-level officers) are responsible for seeing that the financial state-
ments are prepared according to applicable financial reporting standards and
according to established accounting principles and methods.
If a business’s financial statements are later discovered to be seriously in error
or deliberately misleading, the business and its top executives can be sued for
damages suffered by lenders and investors who relied on the financial state-
ments. For this reason, business managers should understand their responsi-
bility for the financial statements and the accounting methods used to prepare
the statements. In a court of law, they can’t plead ignorance.
I have met more than one business manager who doesn’t have a clue about
his or her financial statements. This situation is a little scary; a manager who
26
Part I: Opening the Books on Accounting 

doesn’t understand financial statements is like an airplane pilot who doesn’t
understand the instrument readouts in the cockpit. Such a manager could run
the business and “land the plane safely,” but knowing how to read the vital
signs along the way is much more prudent.
Business managers at all levels need to understand financial statements and
the accounting methods used to prepare them. Also, lenders to a business,
investors in a business, business lawyers, government regulators of business,
entrepreneurs, anyone thinking of becoming an entrepreneur and starting a
business, and, yes, even economists should know the basics of financial
statement accounting. I’ve noticed that even experienced business journal-
ists, who ought to know better, sometimes refer to the balance sheet when
they’re talking about profit performance. The bottom line is found in the
income statement, not the balance sheet!
Considering Accounting Careers
In our highly developed economy, many people make their living as accoun-
tants — and here I’m using the term accountant in the broadest possible
sense. If you look in the Statistical Abstract of the United States you’ll see that
upwards of 2 million people make their living as bookkeepers, accountants,
and auditors. They work for businesses, government agencies, nonprofit
organizations, and other organizations and associations.
Because accountants work with numbers and details, you hear references to
accountants as bean counters, digit heads, number nerds, and other names I
don’t dare mention here. Accountants take these snide references in stride
and with good humor. Actually, accountants rank among the most respected
professionals in many polls.
Certified public accountant (CPA)
In the accounting profession, the mark of distinction is to be a CPA, which
stands for certified public accountant. The term public means that the person
has had some practical experience working for a CPA firm; it does not indi-
cate whether that person is presently in public practice (as an individual CPA
or as an employee or partner in a CPA firm that offers services to the public
at large) rather than working for one organization. For example, I have a CPA
certificate in Colorado, but I’m on inactive status because I have retired and
do not offer my services to the public.
27
Chapter 1: Accounting: The Language of Business, Investing, Finance, and Taxes

To become a CPA, you go to college, graduate with an accounting major in a
five-year program (in most states), and pass the national, computer-based
CPA exam. You also must satisfy professional employment experience; this
requirement varies from state to state but generally is one or two years. After
satisfying the education, exam, and experience requirements, you get a CPA
certificate to hang on your wall. More important, you get a permit from your
state to practice as a CPA and offer your services to the public. States require
continuing education hours to maintain an active CPA permit.
The controller: The chief accountant 
in an organization
The top-level accounting officer in a business organization is usually called the
controller. The controller designs the entire accounting system of the business
and keeps it up-to-date with changes in the tax laws and changes in the account-
ing rules that govern reporting financial statements to outside lenders and
owners. Controllers are responsible for hiring, training, evaluating, promoting,
and sometimes firing the persons who hold the various bookkeeping and
accounting positions in an organization — which range from payroll functions
to the several different types of tax returns that have to be filed on time with dif-
ferent government agencies.
The controller is the lead person in the financial planning and budgeting process
of the business organization. Furthermore, the controller designs the accounting
reports that all the managers in the organization receive — from the sales and
marketing managers to the purchasing and procurement managers. These inter-
nal reports should be designed to fit the authority and responsibility of each
manager; they should provide information for managers’ decision-making analy-
sis needs and the information they need to exercise effective control. The con-
troller also designs and monitors the accounting reports that go to the
business’s top-level vice presidents, the president, the chief executive officer, and
the board of directors. All the tough accounting questions and problems get
referred to the controller.
Smaller businesses may employ only one accountant. In many cases a small
company’s full-time bookkeeper or office manager carries out many of the
duties that would be done by the controller in a larger organization. Smaller
businesses often call in a CPA for advice and help. The CPA may function
more or less as a part-time controller for a small business, preparing its
annual income tax returns and helping to prepare the business’s external
financial reports.
28
Part I: Opening the Books on Accounting 

State incorporation laws typically require that someone in the business be
designated the treasurer, who has fiduciary responsibilities. Also, these laws
usually require that someone be designated the secretary. The organizational
charts of larger businesses usually put their controller under their vice presi-
dent for finance, or chief financial officer (CFO). The accounting functions in a
business are integrated with and work in close coordination with its financial,
treasury, and secretary functions.
A springboard to other careers
Many CPAs move on to other careers. A recent article in the Journal of
Accountancy featured former CPAs who moved on to other interesting
careers. One became a Harley-Davidson dealer, another a high school
teacher, another an auto racing track owner, another a physical fitness coach-
ing business owner, and one even became a stand-up comedian whose stage
name is “Debitman.” Serving time as a CPA is a good springboard to many
careers, even being the author of Accounting For Dummies.
By the way, if you’re interested in accounting, you may think about getting a
Ph.D. in accounting and becoming an accounting professor. After a few years
in public accounting, I went back to school, got my Ph.D., and spent the rest
of my career in that capacity. These days, the starting salaries for new assis-
tant professors of accounting are well into six digits!

f you read Chapter 1, you got a very brief introduction to the three pri-
mary business financial statements: the income statement, the balance
sheet, and the statement of cash flows. In this chapter, you get some juicy
details. Then, in Part II, you really get the goods. Think back to when you
learned to ride a bicycle. Chapter 1 is like getting on the bike and learning to
keep your balance. In this chapter, you put on your training wheels and start
riding. Then, when you’re ready, the chapters in Part II explain all 21 gears of
the financial statements bicycle, and then some.
The financial effects of making profit are not as simple as you may think. Profit-
making activities cause changes in the financial condition of a business — but
maybe not the changes you suppose. Many people assume that making a profit
increases a business’s cash balance by the same amount and that’s the end of
it. That’s simply not true. Making profit leaves many footprints on the financial
condition of a business.
Also in this chapter, I briefly discuss financial accounting and reporting 
standards. Businesses comply with established rules for recording revenue,
income, expenses, and losses; for putting values on assets and liabilities; and
for presenting and disclosing information in their financial reports. The basic
idea is that all businesses should follow uniform methods for measuring and
reporting profit performance, and reporting financial condition and cash
flows. Consistency in accounting from business to business is the goal. I
explain who makes the rules, and I discuss two important recent develop-
ments: the internationalization of accounting standards, and the increasing
divide between financial reporting for public and private companies.

Introducing the Information Content 
of Financial Statements
This chapter focuses on the basic information components of each financial
statement reported by a business. In this first step, I do not address the clas-
sification, or grouping, of these information packets within each financial
statement. The first step is to get a good idea of the information content
reported in financial statements. The second step is to become familiar with
the “architecture,” rules of classification, and other features of financial state-
ments, which I explain in Part II of the book.
Setting up the business example
To better illustrate the three primary financial statements, I need a realistic
business example. The information content of its financial statements
depends on the line of business a company is in — in other words, which
types of products and services it sells. The financial statements of a movie
theater chain are different from those of a bank, which are different from
those of an airline, which are different from an automobile manufacturer.
Here, I use a fairly common type of business example.
Here are the particulars of the business I use for the example:
 It sells products, mainly to other businesses.
 It sells on credit, and its customers take a month or so before they pay.
 It holds a fairly large stock of products awaiting sale (its inventory).
 It owns a wide variety of long-term operating assets that have useful
lives from 3 to 30 years or longer (a building, machines, tools, comput-
ers, office furniture, and so on.).
 It’s been in business for many years and has made a steady profit over
the years.
 It borrows money for part of the total capital it needs.
 It’s organized as a corporation and pays federal and state income taxes
on its annual taxable income.
 It has never been in bankruptcy and is not facing any immediate finan-
cial difficulties.
32
Part I: Opening the Books on Accounting 

The company’s annual income statement for the year just ended, its balance
sheet at the end of the year, and its statement of cash flows for the year are
presented in Figures 2-1, 2-2, and 2-3 respectively. Dollar amounts in the three
financials are rounded off to the nearest thousand, which is not uncommon.
Dollar amounts can be reported out to the last dollar, or even the last penny
for that matter. But too many digits in a dollar amount are hard to absorb, so
many businesses round off the dollar amounts in their financial statements.
These financial statements are stepping-stone illustrations that are con-
cerned mainly with the basic information components in each statement.
Full-blown, classified financial statements are presented in Part II of the book.
(I know you can’t wait to get to those chapters.) The financial statements in
this chapter do not include all the information you see in actual financial
statements. Also, I use descriptive labels for each item rather than the terse
and technical titles you see in actual financial statements. And I strip out
subtotals that you see in actual financial statements because they are not
necessary at this point. So, with all these conventions in mind, let’s get going.
Oops, I forgot to mention a couple of things about financial statements. I
should give you quick heads-up on these points. Financial statements are
rather stiff and formal. No slang or street language is allowed, and I’ve never
seen a swear word in one. Financial statements would get a G in the movies
rating system. Seldom do you see any graphics or artwork in a financial state-
ment itself, although you do see a fair amount of photos and graphics else-
where in the financial reports of public companies. And, there’s virtually no
humor in financial reports. So, don’t look for cartoons like the ones by Rich
Tennant in this book. (However, I might mention that in his annual letter to
the stockholders of Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett includes some won-
derful humor to make his points.)
The income statement
The income statement is the all-important financial statement that summa-
rizes the profit-making activities of a business over a period of time. Figure
2-1 shows the basic information content for an external income statement:
one released outside the business to its owners and lenders. The income
statement in Figure 2-1 shows six lines of information: sales revenue on the
top line, four types of expenses that are deducted from sales revenue, and
finally bottom-line net income. Virtually all income statements disclose at
least the four expenses shown in Figure 2-1. The first two expenses (cost of
goods sold and selling, general, and administrative expenses) take a big bite
out of sales revenue. The other two expenses (interest and income tax) are
relatively small as a percent of annual sales revenue but important enough in
their own right to be reported separately.
33
Chapter 2: Financial Statements and Accounting Standards

Instead of one amount for all selling, general, and administrative expenses, a
business may separate out certain expenses from this broad category. For
example, a business could disclose separate expenses for advertising and
sales promotion, depreciation, salaries and wages, research and develop-
ment, and delivery and shipping — though reporting these expenses is not
common. Businesses do not disclose the compensation of top management in
their external financial reports (although this information can be found in the
proxy statements of public companies that are filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission).
Inside most businesses an income statement is called a P&L (profit and loss)
report. These internal profit performance reports to the managers of a busi-
ness include a good deal more detailed information about expenses, and
about sales revenue also. Reporting just four expenses to managers (as shown
in Figure 2-1) would not do. Chapter 9 explains P&L reports to managers.
Sales revenue is from the sales of products and services to customers. Income
refers to amounts earned by a business from sources other than sales; for
example, a real estate rental business receives rental income from its tenants.
(In the example, the business has only sales revenue.) As I mention above,
businesses report the expenses shown in Figure 2-1 — cost of goods sold
expense, selling and general expenses, interest expense, and income tax
expense. Further breakdown of expenses is at the discretion of the business.
Net income, being the bottom line of the income statement after deducting all
expenses from sales revenue (and income, if any), is called, not surprisingly,
the bottom line. It is also called net earnings. A few companies call it profit or
net profit, but such terminology is not common.
The income statement gets the most attention from business managers,
lenders, and investors (not that they ignore the other two financial state-
ments). The very abbreviated versions of income statements that you see 
in the financial press, such as in The Wall Street Journal, report the top line
(sales revenue and income) and the bottom line (net income) and not much
more. Refer to Chapter 4 for much more information on income statements.

The balance sheet
Figure 2-2 shows the building blocks (basic information components) of a
typical balance sheet. One reason the balance sheet is called by this name is
that its two sides balance, or are equal in total amounts. In the example, the
$5.2 million total of assets equals the $5.2 million total of liabilities and
owners’ equity. The balance or equality of total assets on the one hand and
the sum of liabilities plus owners’ equity on the other hand is expressed in
the accounting equation, which I discuss in Chapter 1.
Generally speaking, five or more assets are reported in a typical balance
sheet, starting with cash, and then receivables, and then cost of products
held for sale, and so on down the line. Generally five or more liabilities are
disclosed, starting with trade credit liabilities (from buying on credit), and
then unpaid expenses, and then proceeding through the interest-bearing
debts of the business. Two or more owners’ equity accounts are generally
reported. In summary, you’ll find 12 or more lines of information in most bal-
ance sheets. Each of these information packets is called an account — so, a
balance sheet has a composite of asset accounts, liability accounts, and
owners’ equity accounts.

Chapter 2: Financial Statements and Accounting Standards

Most businesses need a variety of assets. You have cash, which every busi-
ness needs, of course. Businesses that sell products carry an inventory of
products awaiting sale to customers. Businesses need long-term resources
that are generally called property, plant, and equipment; this group includes
buildings, vehicles, tools, machines, and other resources needed in their
operations. All these, and more, go under the collective name “assets.”
As you’d suspect, the particular assets reported in the balance sheet depend
on which assets the business owns. I include just four basic assets in Figure
2-2. These are the hardcore assets that a business selling products on credit
would have. It’s possible that such a business could lease virtually all of its
long-term operating assets instead of owning them, in which case the busi-
ness would report no such assets. In this example, the business owns these
so-called fixed assets. They are fixed because they are held for use in the
operations of the business and are not for sale, and their usefulness lasts 
several years or longer.
So, where does a business get the money to buy its assets? Most businesses
borrow money on the basis of interest-bearing notes or other credit instru-
ments for part of the total capital they need for their assets. Also, businesses
buy many things on credit and at the balance sheet date owe money to their
suppliers, which will be paid in the future. These operating liabilities are
never grouped with interest-bearing debt in the balance sheet. The accoun-
tant would be tied to the stake for doing such a thing. Note that liabilities are
not intermingled among assets — this is a definite no-no in financial report-
ing. You cannot subtract certain liabilities from certain assets and only report
the net balance. You would be given 20 lashes for doing so.
Could a business’s total liabilities be greater than its total assets? Well, not
likely — unless the business has been losing money hand over fist. In the vast
majority of cases a business has more total assets than total liabilities. Why?
For two reasons:
 Its owners have invested money in the business, which is not a liability
of the business.
 The business has earned profit over the years, and some (or all) of the
profit has been retained in the business. Making profit increases assets;
if not all the profit is distributed to owners, the company’s assets rise by
the amount of profit retained.
In the example (refer to Figure 2-2), owners’ equity is about $2.5 million, or
$2.47 million to be more exact. Sometimes this amount is referred to as net
worth, because it equals total assets minus total liabilities. However, net
worth is not a good term because it implies that the business is worth the
36
Part I: Opening the Books on Accounting 

amount recorded in its owners’ equity accounts. The market value of a busi-
ness, when it needs to be known, depends on many factors. The amount of
owners’ equity reported in a balance sheet, which is called its book value, is
not irrelevant in setting a market value on the business — but it is usually 
not the dominant factor. The amount of owners’ equity in a balance sheet is
based on the history of capital invested in the business by its owners and the
history of its profit performance and distributions from profit.
A balance sheet could be whipped up anytime you want, say at the end of
every day. In fact, some businesses (such as banks and other financial institu-
tions) need daily balance sheets, but most businesses do not prepare balance
sheets that often. Typically, preparing a balance sheet at the end of each
month is adequate for general management purposes — although a manager
may need to take a look at the business’s balance sheet in the middle of the
month. In external financial reports (those released outside the business to
its lenders and investors), a balance sheet is required at the close of business
on the last day of the income statement period. If its annual or quarterly
income statement ends, say, September 30; then the business reports its bal-
ance sheet at the close of business on September 30.
The balance sheet could more properly be called the statement of assets, lia-
bilities, and owners’ equity. Its more formal name is the statement of financial
condition. Just a reminder: The profit for the most recent period is found in 
the income statement; periodic profit is not reported in the balance sheet.
The profit reported in the income statement is before any distributions from
profit to owners. The cumulative amount of profit over the years that has not
been distributed to its owners is reported in the owners’ equity section of the
company’s balance sheet.
By the way, notice that the balance sheet in Figure 2-2 is presented in a top
and bottom format, instead of a left and right side format. Either the vertical
or horizontal mode of display is acceptable. You see both the portrait and the
landscape layouts in financial reports.
The statement of cash flows
To survive and thrive, business managers confront three financial imperatives:
 Make an adequate profit
 Keep financial condition out of trouble and in good shape
 Control cash flows
37
Chapter 2: Financial Statements and Accounting Standards

The income statement reports whether the business made a profit. The bal-
ance sheet reports the financial condition of the business. The third impera-
tive is reported on in the statement of cash flows, which presents a summary
of the business’s sources and uses of cash during the income statement
period.
Smart business managers hardly get the word net income (or profit) out of
their mouths before mentioning cash flow. Successful business managers tell
you that they have to manage both profit and cash flow; you can’t do one and
ignore the other. Business is a two-headed dragon in this respect. Ignoring
cash flow can pull the rug out from under a successful profit formula. Still,
some managers are preoccupied with making profit and overlook cash flow.
For external financial reporting, the cash flows of a business are divided into
three categories, which are shown in Figure 2-3.
In the example, the company earned $520,000 profit during the year (see
Figure 2-1). One result of its profit-making activities was to increase its cash
$400,000, which you see in part (1) of the statement of cash flows (see Figure
2-3). This still leaves $120,000 of profit to explain, which I get to in the next
section. The actual cash inflows from revenues and outflows for expenses 
run on a different timetable than when the sales revenue and expenses are
recorded for determining profit. It’s like two different trains going to the 
same destination — the second train (the cash flow train) runs on a different
schedule than the first train (the recording of sales revenue and expenses 
in the accounts of the business). In the next section, I give a scenario that
accounts for the $120,000 difference between cash flow and profit. I give a
more comprehensive explanation of the differences between cash flows and
sales revenue and expenses in Chapter 6.
The second part of the statement of cash flows sums up the long-term invest-
ments made by the business during the year, such as constructing a new pro-
duction plant or replacing machinery and equipment. If the business sold any
of its long-term assets, it reports the cash inflows from these divestments in
this section of the statement of cash flows. The cash flows of other invest-
ment activities (if any) are reported in this part of the statement as well. As
you can see in part (2) of the statement of cash flows (see Figure 2-3), the
business invested $450,000 in new long-term operating assets (trucks, equip-
ment, tools, and computers).
The third part of the statement sums up the dealings between the business
and its sources of capital during the period — borrowing money from lenders
and raising new capital from its owners. Cash outflows to pay debt are
reported in this section, as well as cash distributions from profit paid to the
owners of the business. As you can see in part (3) of the statement of cash
38
Part I: Opening the Books on Accounting 

flows (see Figure 2-3), the result of these transactions was to increase cash
$200,000. By the way, in this example the business did not make cash distrib-
utions from profit to its owners. It could have, but it didn’t — which is an
important point that I discuss later in the chapter (see the section “Why no
cash distribution from profit?).
As you see in Figure 2-3, the net result of the three types of cash activities
was a $150,000 increase during the year. The increase is added to the cash
balance at the start of the year to get the cash balance at the end of the year,
which is $1 million. I should make one point clear here: The $150,000 increase
in cash during the year (in this example) is never referred to as a cash flow
bottom line, or any such thing. The term “bottom line” is strictly reserved for
the last line of the income statement, which reports net income — the final
profit after all expenses are deducted.
I could tell you that the statement of cash flows is relatively straightforward
and easy to understand, but that would be a lie. The statements of cash flows
reported by most businesses are frustratingly difficult to read. (More about
this issue in Chapter 6.) Figure 2-3 presents the statement of cash flows for
the business example as simply as I can possibly make it. Actual cash flow
statements are much more complicated than the brief introduction to this
financial statement that you see in Figure 2-3.

Chapter 2: Financial Statements and Accounting Standards

Imagine you have a highlighter pen in your hand, and the three basic finan-
cial statements of a business are in front of you. What are the most important
numbers to mark? Financial statements do not have any numbers highlighted;
they do not come with headlines like newspapers. You have to find your own
headlines. Bottom-line profit (net income) in the income statement is one
number you would mark for sure. Another key number is cash flow from oper-
ating activities in the statement of cash flows.
How Profit and Cash Flow 
from Profit Differ
The income statement in Figure 2-1 reports that the business in our example
earned $520,000 net income for the year. However, the statement of cash
flows in Figure 2-3 reports that its profit-making, or operating, activities
increased cash only $400,000 during the year. This gap between profit and
cash flow from operating activities is not unusual. So, what happened to the
other $120,000 of profit? Where is it? Is there some accounting sleight of hand
going on? Did the business really earn $520,000 net income if cash increased
only $400,000? These are good questions, and I will try to answer them as
directly as I can without hitting you over the head with a lot of technical
details at this point.
Here’s one scenario that explains the $120,000 difference between profit (net
income) and cash flow from operating activities:
 Suppose the business collected $50,000 less cash from customers during
the year than the total sales revenue reported in its income statement.
(Remember that the business sells on credit and its customers take time
before actually paying the business.) Therefore, there’s a cash flow lag
between booking sales and collecting cash from customers. As a result,
the business’s cash inflow from customers was $50,000 less than the
sales revenue amount used to calculate profit for the year.
 Also suppose that during the year the business made cash payments
connected with its expenses that were $70,000 higher than the total
amount of expenses reported in the income statement. For example, 
a business that sells products buys or makes the products, and then
holds the products in inventory for some time before it sells the items 
to customers. Cash is paid out before the cost of goods sold expense 
is recorded. This is one example of a difference between cash flow 
connected with an expense and the amount recorded in the income
statement for the expense.
40
Part I: Opening the Books on Accounting 

In this scenario, the two factors cause cash flow from profit-making (operat-
ing) activities to be $120,000 less than the net income earned for the year.
Cash collections from customers were $50,000 less than sales revenue, and
cash payments for expenses were $70,000 more than the amount of expenses
recorded to the year. In Chapter 6, I explain the several factors that cause
cash flow and bottom-line profit to diverge.
At this point the key idea to hold in mind is that the sales revenue reported in
the income statement does not equal cash collections from customers during
the year, and expenses do not equal cash payments during the year. Cash col-
lections from sales minus cash payments for expenses gives cash flow from a
company’s profit-making activities; sales revenue minus expenses gives the
net income earned for the year. Cash flow almost always is different from net
income. Sorry mate, but that’s how the cookie crumbles.
Gleaning Key Information from 
Financial Statements
The whole point of reporting financial statements is to provide important
information to people who have a financial interest in the business — mainly
its outside investors and lenders. From that information, investors and
lenders are able to answer key questions about the financial performance
and condition of the business. I discuss some of these key questions in this
section. In Chapters 13 and 17, I discuss a longer list of questions and explain
financial statement analysis.
How’s profit performance?
Investors use two important measures to judge a company’s annual profit
performance. Here, I use the data from Figures 2-1 and 2-2 (the dollar
amounts are in thousands):
 Return on sales = profit as a percent of annual sales revenue:
$520 bottom-line annual profit (net income) ÷ $10,400 annual sales 
revenue = 5.0%
 Return on equity = profit as a percent of owners’ equity:
$520 bottom-line annual profit (net income) ÷ $2,470 owners’ equity =
21.1%
41
Chapter 2: Financial Statements and Accounting Standards

Profit looks pretty thin compared with annual sales revenue. The company
earns only 5 percent return on sales. In other words, 95 cents out of every
sales dollar goes for expenses, and the company keeps only 5 cents for profit.
(Many businesses earn 10 percent or higher return on sales.) However, when
profit is compared with owners’ equity, things look a lot better. The business
earns more than 21 percent profit on its owners’ equity. I’d bet you don’t
have many investments earning 21 percent per year.
Is there enough cash?
Cash is the lubricant of business activity. Realistically a business can’t oper-
ate with a zero cash balance. It can’t wait to open the morning mail to see
how much cash it will have for the day’s needs (although some businesses
try to operate on a shoestring cash balance). A business should keep enough
cash on hand to keep things running smoothly even when there are interrup-
tions in the normal inflows of cash. A business has to meet its payroll on
time, for example. Keeping an adequate balance in the checking account
serves as a buffer against unforeseen disruptions in normal cash inflows.
At the end of the year, the business in our example has $1 million cash on
hand (refer to Figure 2-2). This cash balance is available for general business
purposes. (If there are restrictions on how it can use its cash balance, the
business is obligated to disclose the restrictions.) Is $1 million enough?
Interestingly, businesses do not have to comment on their cash balance. I’ve
never seen such a comment in a financial report.
The business has $650,000 in operating liabilities that will come due for pay-
ment over the next month or so (refer to Figure 2-2). So, it has enough cash to
pay these liabilities. But it doesn’t have enough cash on hand to pay its oper-
ating liabilities and its $2.08 million interest-bearing debt (refer to Figure 2-2
again). Lenders don’t expect a business to keep a cash balance more than 
the amount of debt; this condition would defeat the very purpose of lending
money to the business, which is to have the business put the money to good
use and be able to pay interest on the debt.
Lenders are more interested in the ability of the business to control its cash
flows, so that when the time comes to pay off loans it will be able to do so.
They know that the other, non-cash assets of the business will be converted
into cash flow. Receivables will be collected, and products held in inventory
will be sold and the sales will generate cash flow. So, you shouldn’t focus just
on cash; you should throw the net wider and look at the other assets as well.
42
Part I: Opening the Books on Accounting 

Taking this broader approach, the business has $1 million cash, $800,000
receivables, and $1.56 million inventory, which adds up to $3.36 million of
cash and cash potential. Relative to its $2.73 million total liabilities ($650,000
operating liabilities plus $2.08 million debt), the business looks in pretty
good shape. On the other hand, if it turns out that the business is not able to
collect its receivables and is not able to sell its products, it would end up in
deep doo-doo.
One other way to look at a business’s cash balance is to express its cash bal-
ance in terms of how many days of sales the amount represents. In the exam-
ple, the business has an ending cash balance equal to 35 days of sales,
calculated as follows:
$10,400,000 annual sales revenue ÷ 365 days =
$28,493 sales per day
$1,000,000 cash balance ÷ $28,493 sales per day 
= 35 days
The business’s cash balance equals a little more than one month of sales
activity, which most lenders and investors would consider adequate.
Can you trust the financial statement
numbers? Are the books cooked?
Whether the financial statements are correct or not depends on the answers
to two basic questions:
 Does the business have a reliable accounting system in place and
employ competent accountants?
 Has top management manipulated the business’s accounting methods 
or deliberately falsified the numbers?
I’d love to tell you that the answer to the first question is always yes, and the
answer to the second question is always no. But you know better, don’t you?
What can I tell you? There are a lot of crooks and dishonest persons in the
business world who think nothing of manipulating the accounting numbers
and cooking the books. Also, organized crime is involved in many businesses.
And I have to tell you that in my experience many businesses don’t put much
effort into keeping their accounting systems up to speed, and they skimp on
hiring competent accountants. In short, there is a risk that the financial state-
ments of a business could be incorrect and seriously misleading.
43
Chapter 2: Financial Statements and Accounting Standards

To increase the credibility of their financial statements, many businesses hire
independent CPA auditors to examine their accounting systems and records
and to express opinions on whether the financial statements conform to
established standards. In fact, some business lenders insist on an annual
audit by an independent CPA firm as a condition of making the loan. The out-
side, non-management investors in a privately owned business could vote to
have annual CPA audits of the financial statements. Public companies have no
choice; under federal securities laws, a public company is required to have
annual audits by an independent CPA firm.
Two points: CPA audits are not cheap, and these audits are not always effec-
tive in rooting out financial reporting fraud by high-level managers. I discuss
these and other points in Chapter 15.
Why no cash distribution from profit?
In this example the business did not distribute any of its profit for the year 
to its owners. Distributions from profit by a business corporation are called
dividends. (The total amount distributed is divided up among the stockhold-
ers, hence the term “dividends.”) Cash distributions from profit to owners
are included in the third section of the statement of cash flows (refer to
Figure 2-3). But, in the example, the business did not make any cash distribu-
tions from profit — even though it earned $520,000 net income (refer to
Figure 2-1). Why not?
The business realized $400,000 cash flow from its profit-making (operating)
activities (refer to Figure 2-3). In most cases, this would be the upper limit on
how much cash a business would distribute from profit to its owners. So you
might very well ask whether the business should have distributed, say, at
least half of its cash flow from profit, or $200,000, to its owners. If you owned
20 percent of the ownership shares of the business, you would have received
20 percent, or $40,000, of the distribution. But you got no cash return on your
investment in the business. Your shares should be worth more because the
profit for the year increased the company’s owners’ equity. But you did not
see any of this increase in your wallet.
Deciding whether to make cash distributions from profit to shareowners is in
the hands of the directors of a business corporation. Its shareowners elect
the directors, and in theory the directors act in the best interests of the
shareowners. So, evidently the directors thought the business had better use
for the $400,000 cash flow from profit than distributing some of it to share-
owners. Generally the main reason for not making cash distributions from
profit is to finance the growth of the business — to use all the cash flow from
profit for expanding the assets needed by the business at the higher sales
level. Ideally, the directors of the business would explain their decision not to
distribute any money from profit to the shareowners. But, generally, no such
comments are made in financial reports.
44

Keeping in Step with Accounting and
Financial Reporting Standards
The unimpeded flow of capital is absolutely critical in a free market economic
system and in the international flow of capital between countries. Investors
and lenders put their capital to work where they think they can get the best
returns on their investments consistent with the risks they’re willing to take.
To make these decisions, they need the accounting information provided in
financial statements of businesses.
Imagine the confusion that would result if every business were permitted 
to invent its own accounting methods for measuring profit and for putting
values on assets and liabilities. What if every business adopted its own 
individual accounting terminology and followed its own style for presenting
financial statements? Such a state of affairs would be a Tower of Babel.
Recognizing U.S. standards
The authoritative standards and rules that govern financial accounting and
reporting by businesses based in the United States are called generally
accepted accounting principles (GAAP). When you read the financial state-
ments of a business, you’re entitled to assume that the business has fully

Chapter 2: Financial Statements and Accounting Standards
Is making profit ethical?
Many people have the view that making profit is
unethical; they think profit is a form of theft —
from employees who are not paid enough, from
customers who are charged too much, from find-
ing loopholes in the tax laws, and so on. (Profit
critics usually don’t say anything about the ethi-
cal aspects of a loss; they don’t address the
question of who should absorb the effects of a
loss.) I must admit that profit critics are some-
times proved right because some businesses
make profit by using illegal or unethical means,
such as false advertising, selling unsafe prod-
ucts, paying employees lower wages than they
are legally entitled to, deliberately under-funding
retirement plans for employees, and other
immoral tactics. Of course in making profit a
business should comply with all applicable laws,
conduct itself in an ethical manner, and play fair
with everyone it deals with. In my experience
most businesses strive to behave according to
high ethical standards, although under pressure
they cut corners and take the low road in certain
areas. Keep in mind that businesses provide
jobs, pay several kinds of taxes, and are essen-
tial cogs in the economic system. Even though
they are not perfect angels, where would we be
without them?

complied with GAAP in reporting its cash flows, profit-making activities, and
financial condition — unless the business makes very clear that it has pre-
pared its financial statements using some other basis of accounting or has
deviated from GAAP in one or more significant respects.
If GAAP are not the basis for preparing its financial statements, a business
should make very clear which other basis of accounting is being used and
should avoid using titles for its financial statements that are associated with
GAAP. For example, if a business uses a simple cash receipts and cash dis-
bursements basis of accounting — which falls way short of GAAP — it should
not use the terms income statement and balance sheet. These terms are part
and parcel of GAAP, and their use as titles for financial statements implies
that the business is using GAAP.
I won’t bore you with a lengthy historical discourse on the development of
accounting and financial reporting standards in the United States. The gen-
eral consensus (backed up by law) is that businesses should use consistent
accounting methods and terminology. General Motors and Microsoft should
use the same accounting methods; so should Wells Fargo and Apple. Of
course, businesses in different industries have different types of transactions,
but the same types of transactions should be accounted for in the same way.
That is the goal.
There are upwards of 10,000 public companies in the United States and easily
more than a million private-owned businesses. Now, am I telling you that all
these businesses should use the same accounting methods, terminology, and
presentation styles for their financial statements? Putting it in such a stark
manner makes me suck in my breath a little. The correct answer is that all
businesses should use the same rulebook of GAAP. However, the rulebook
permits alternative accounting methods for some transactions. Furthermore,
accountants have to interpret the rules as they apply GAAP in actual situa-
tions. The devil is in the details.
In the United States, GAAP constitute the gold standard for preparing financial
statements of business entities (although the gold is somewhat tarnished, as I
discuss in later chapters). The presumption is that any deviations from GAAP
would cause misleading financial statements. If a business honestly thinks it
should deviate from GAAP — in order to better reflect the economic reality 
of its transactions or situation — it should make very clear that it has not
complied with GAAP in one or more respects. If deviations from GAAP are 
not disclosed, the business may have legal exposure to those who relied on
the information in its financial report and suffered a loss attributable to the
misleading nature of the information.
46
Part I: Opening the Books on Accounting 

Getting to know the U.S. standard setters
Okay, so everyone reading a financial report is entitled to assume that GAAP
have been followed (unless the business clearly discloses that it is using
another basis of accounting).
The basic idea behind the development of GAAP is to measure profit and to
value assets and liabilities consistently from business to business — to estab-
lish broad-scale uniformity in accounting methods for all businesses. The
idea is to make sure that all accountants are singing the same tune from the
same hymnal. The purpose is also to establish realistic and objective meth-
ods for measuring profit and putting values on assets and liabilities. The
authoritative bodies write the tunes that accountants have to sing.
47
Chapter 2: Financial Statements and Accounting Standards
Financial accounting and reporting by government
and not-for-profit entities
In the grand scheme of things, the world of
financial accounting and reporting can be
divided into two hemispheres: for-profit busi-
ness entities and not-for-profit entities. A large
body of authoritative rules and standards called
generally accepted accounting principles
(GAAP) have been hammered out over the
years to govern accounting methods and finan-
cial reporting of business entities in the United
States. Accounting and financial reporting stan-
dards have also evolved and been established
for government and not-for-profit entities. This
book centers on business accounting methods
and financial reporting. Financial reporting by
government and not-for-profit entities is a broad
and diverse territory, which is beyond the scope
of this book. I’ll say just a few words here.
People generally don’t demand financial reports
from government and not-for-profit organizations.
Federal, state, and local government entities
issue financial reports that are in the public
domain, although few taxpayers are interested in
reading them. When you donate money to a char-
ity, school, or church, you don’t always get finan-
cial reports in return. On the other hand, many
private, not-for-profit organizations issue finan-
cial reports to their members — credit unions,
homeowners’ associations, country clubs, mutual
insurance companies (owned by their policy
holders), pension plans, labor unions, healthcare
providers, and so on. The members or partici-
pants may have an equity interest or ownership
share in the organization and, thus, they need
financial reports to apprise them of their financial
status with the entity.
Government and other not-for profit entities
should comply with the established accounting
and financial reporting standards that apply 
to their type of entity. Caution: Many not-for-
profit entities use accounting methods differ-
ent than business GAAP — in some cases very 
different — and the terminology in their finan-
cial reports is somewhat different than in the
financial reports of business entities.

Who are these authoritative bodies? In the United States, the highest-ranking
authority in the private (non-government) sector for making pronouncements
on GAAP — and for keeping these accounting standards up-to-date — is the
Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). Also, the federal Securities and
Exchange Commission (SEC) has broad powers over accounting and financial
reporting standards for companies whose securities (stocks and bonds) are
publicly traded. Actually, the SEC outranks the FASB because it derives its
authority from federal securities laws that govern the public issuance and
trading in securities. The SEC has on occasion overridden the FASB, but not
very often.
GAAP also include minimum requirements for disclosure, which refers to how
information is classified and presented in financial statements and to the
types of information that have to be included with the financial statements,
mainly in the form of footnotes. The SEC makes the disclosure rules for
public companies. Disclosure rules for private companies are controlled by
GAAP. Chapter 12 explains the disclosures that are required in addition to the
three primary financial statements of a business (the income statement, bal-
ance sheet, and statement of cash flows).
The official set of GAAP rules is big — more than a thousand pages! These
rules have evolved over many decades — some rules remaining the same for
many years, some being superseded and modified from time to time, and new
rules being added. Like lawyers who have to keep up on the latest court
cases, accountants have to keep up with the latest developments at the FASB
and SEC (and other places as well).
Some people think the rules have become too complicated and far too techni-
cal. If you flip through the GAAP rulebook, you’ll see why people come to this
conclusion. However, if the rules are not specific and detailed enough, differ-
ent accountants will make different interpretations that will cause inconsis-
tency from one business to the next regarding how profit is measured and
how assets and liabilities are reported in the balance sheet. So, the FASB is
between a rock and a hard place. For the most part it issues rules that are
rather detailed and technical.
Going worldwide
Although it’s a bit of an overstatement, today the investment of capital knows
no borders. U.S. capital is invested in European and other countries, and cap-
ital from other countries is invested in U.S. businesses. In short, the flow of
capital has become international. Accounting and financial reporting stan-
dards in other countries are not bound by U.S. GAAP, and in fact there are sig-
nificant differences that cause problems.

Outside the United States, the main authoritative accounting standards setter
is the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), which is based in
London. The IASB was founded in 2001. Over 7,000 public companies have
their securities listed on the several stock exchanges in the European Union
(EU) countries. In many regards, the IASB operates in a manner similar to the
Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) in the United States, and the
two have very similar missions. The IASB has already issued many standards,
which are called International Financial Reporting Standards.
The two main authoritative accounting rule-making bodies — the FASB and
the IASB — are not on a collision course. Just the opposite: They are on a
convergence course. They are working together toward developing global
standards that all businesses would follow, regardless of which country a
business is domiciled in. Of course political issues and national pride come
into play. The term harmonization is favored, which sidesteps difficult issues
regarding the future roles of the FASB and IASB in the issuance of interna-
tional accounting standards.
One major obstacle deterring the goal of world-wide accounting standards
concerns which sort of standards should be issued:
 The FASB follows a rules-based approach. Its pronouncements have been
very detailed and technical. The idea is to leave very little room for dif-
ferences of interpretation.
 The IASB favors a principles-based method. Under this approach,
accounting standards are stated in fairly broad general language and the
detailed interpretation of the standards is left to accountants in the field.
The two authoritative bodies have disagreed on some key accounting issues,
and the road to convergence of accounting standards will be rocky, in my
view. But no country’s economy is an island to itself. The stability, develop-
ment, and growth of an economy depend on securing capital from both inside
and outside the country. The flow of capital across borders by investors and
lenders gives enormous impetus for the development of uniform interna-
tional accounting standards. Stay tuned; in the coming decade I think we will
see more and more convergence of accounting standards in different coun-
tries. Then again, I could be dead wrong.
Noting a divide between public 
and private companies
Traditionally, GAAP and financial reporting standards were viewed as equally
applicable to public companies (generally large corporations) and private
(generally smaller) companies. Today, however, we are witnessing a growing
distinction between accounting and financial reporting standards for public
versus private companies. Although most accountants don’t like to admit it,
49
Chapter 2: Financial Statements and Accounting Standards

there’s always been a de facto divergence in actual financial reporting prac-
tices by private companies compared with the more rigorously enforced
standards for public companies. For example, many private companies still
do not include a statement of cash flows in their financial reports, even
though this has been a GAAP requirement since 1975.
It’s probably safe to say that the financial reports of most private businesses
measure up to GAAP standards in all significant respects. At the same time,
however, there’s little doubt that the financial reports of some private compa-
nies fall short. As a matter of fact, in the invitation to comment on the pro-
posal to establish an advisory committee for private company accounting
standards, the FASB said that “compliance with GAAP standards for many for-
profit private companies is a choice rather than a requirement because pri-
vate companies can often control who receives their financial information.”
The FASB and the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA)
recently established the Private Company Financial Reporting Committee,
which will advise the FASB regarding how to adapt accounting standard pro-
nouncements for private companies.
Private companies do not have many of the accounting problems of large,
public companies. For example, many public companies deal in complex
derivative instruments, issue stock options to managers, provide highly
developed defined-benefit retirement and health benefit plans for their
employees, enter into complicated inter-company investment and joint ven-
ture operations, have complex organizational structures, and so on. Most pri-
vate companies do not have to deal with these issues.
Finally, I should mention that smaller private businesses do not have as much
money to spend on their accountants and auditors. Big companies can spend
big bucks and hire highly qualified accountants. Furthermore, public compa-
nies are legally required to have annual audits by independent CPAs (see
Chapter 15). The annual audit keeps a big business up-to-date on accounting
and financial reporting standards. Frankly, smaller private companies are
somewhat at a disadvantage in keeping up with accounting and financial
reporting standards.
Recognizing how income tax methods
influence accounting methods
Generally speaking (and I’m being very general here), the U.S. federal income
tax accounting rules for determining the annual taxable income of a business
are in agreement with GAAP. In other words, the accounting methods used for
figuring taxable income and for figuring business profit before income tax are
50
Part I: Opening the Books on Accounting 

in general agreement. Having said this, I should point out that several differ-
ences do exist. A business may use one accounting method for filing its
annual income tax returns and a different method for measuring its annual
profit both internally for management reporting purposes and externally for
preparing its financial statements to outsiders.
Many people argue that certain income tax accounting methods have had an
unhealthy impact on GAAP. For example, the income tax law permits acceler-
ated methods for depreciating long-lived operating assets — machines, tools,
autos and trucks, and office equipment. (Even the cost of buildings can be
depreciated over shorter life spans than the actual lives of most buildings.)
Other depreciation methods may be more realistic, but many businesses use
accelerated depreciation methods both in their income tax returns and in
their financial statements.
Following the rules and bending the rules
An often repeated accounting story concerns three persons interviewing for
an important accounting position. They are asked one key question: “What’s
2 plus 2?” The first candidate answers, “It’s 4,” and is told, “Don’t call us, we’ll
call you.” The second candidate answers, “Well, most of the time the answer
is 4, but sometimes it’s 3 and sometimes it’s 5.” The third candidate answers:
“What do you want the answer to be?” Guess who gets the job. This story
exaggerates, of course, but it does have an element of truth.
51
Chapter 2: Financial Statements and Accounting Standards
Depending on estimates and assumptions
The importance of estimates and assumptions
in financial statement accounting is illustrated
in a footnote you see in many annual financial
reports such as the following:
“The preparation of financial statements in con-
formity with generally accepted accounting prin-
ciples requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect reported amounts.
Examples of the more significant estimates
include: accruals and reserves for warranty and
product liability losses, post-employment bene-
fits, environmental costs, income taxes, and
plant closing costs.”
Accounting estimates should be based on the
best available information, of course, but most
estimates are subjective and arbitrary to some
extent. The accountant can choose either pes-
simistic or optimistic estimates, and thereby
record either conservative profit numbers or
more aggressive profit numbers. One key pre-
diction made in preparing financial statements
is called the going-concern assumption. The
accountant assumes that the business is not
facing imminent shutdown of its operations and
the forced liquidations of its assets, and that it
will continue as usual for the foreseeable future.
If a business is in the middle of bankruptcy pro-
ceedings, the accountant changes focus to the
liquidation values of its assets.

The point is that interpreting GAAP is not cut-and-dried. Many accounting
standards leave a lot of wiggle room for interpretation. Guidelines would be a
better word to describe many accounting rules. Deciding how to account for
certain transactions and situations requires seasoned judgment and careful
analysis of the rules. Furthermore, many estimates have to be made. (See the
sidebar “Depending on estimates and assumptions.”) Deciding on accounting
methods requires, above all else, good faith.
A business may resort to creative accounting to make profit for the period
look better, or to make its year-to-year profit less erratic than it really is
(which is called income smoothing). Like lawyers who know where to find
loopholes, accountants can come up with inventive interpretations that stay
within the boundaries of GAAP. I warn you about these creative accounting
techniques — also called massaging the numbers — at various points in this
book. Massaging the numbers can get out of hand and become accounting
fraud, also called cooking the books. Massaging the numbers has some basis
in honest differences for interpreting the facts. Cooking the books goes way
beyond interpreting facts; this fraud consists of inventing facts and good old-
fashioned chicanery. I say more on accounting fraud in Chapters 7 and 15.

I
think it’s safe to say that most folks are not enthusiastic bookkeepers. You
may balance your checkbook against your bank statement every month
and somehow manage to pull together all the records you need for your
annual federal income tax return. But if you’re like me, you stuff your bills 
in a drawer and just drag them out once a month when you’re ready to pay
them. And when’s the last time you prepared a detailed listing of all your
assets and liabilities (even though a listing of assets is a good idea for fire
insurance purposes)? Personal computer programs are available to make
bookkeeping for individuals more organized, but you still have to enter a lot
of data into the program, and most people decide not to put forth the effort.
I don’t prepare a summary statement of my earnings and income for the year.
And I don’t prepare a breakdown of what I spent my money on and how much
I saved. Why not? Because I don’t need to! Individuals can get along quite well
without much bookkeeping — but the exact opposite is true for a business.
There’s one key difference between individuals and businesses. Every busi-
ness must prepare periodic financial statements, the accuracy of which is
critical to the business’s survival. The business depends on the accounts and
records generated by its bookkeeping process to prepare these statements; if

the accounting records are incomplete or inaccurate, the financial statements
are incomplete or inaccurate. And inaccuracy simply won’t do. In fact, inac-
curate and incomplete bookkeeping records could be construed as evidence
of fraud.
Obviously, then, business managers have to be sure that the company’s book-
keeping and accounting system is adequate and reliable. This chapter shows
you what bookkeepers and accountants do, mainly so you have a clear idea
of what it takes to be sure that the information coming out of your account-
ing system is complete, timely, and accurate.
Bookkeeping and Beyond
Bookkeeping refers mainly to the record-keeping aspects of accounting; it is
essentially the process (some would say the drudgery) of recording all the
information regarding the transactions and financial activities of a business
(or other organization, venture, or project). Bookkeeping is an indispensable
subset of accounting. The term accounting is much broader, going into the
realm of designing the bookkeeping system, establishing controls to make
sure the system is working well, and analyzing and verifying the recorded
information. Accountants give orders; bookkeepers follow them.
You can think of accounting as what goes on before and after bookkeeping.
Accountants prepare reports based on the information accumulated by the
bookkeeping process: financial statements, tax returns, and various confiden-
tial reports to managers. Measuring profit is a critical task that accountants
perform — a task that depends on the accuracy of the information recorded
by the bookkeeper. The accountant decides how to measure sales revenue
and expenses to determine the profit or loss for the period. The tough ques-
tions about profit — how to measure it in our complex and advanced eco-
nomic environment, and what profit consists of — can’t be answered through
bookkeeping alone.
Pedaling Through the Bookkeeping Cycle
Figure 3-1 presents an overview of the bookkeeping cycle side-by-side with
elements of the accounting system. You can follow the basic bookkeeping
steps down the left side. The accounting elements are shown in the right
column. The basic steps in the bookkeeping sequence, explained briefly, are
as follows. (See also “Managing the Bookkeeping and Accounting System,”
later in this chapter, for more details on some of these steps.)
54
Part I: Opening the Books on Accounting 

1. Prepare source documents for all transactions, operations, and other
events of the business; source documents are the starting point in the
bookkeeping process.
When buying products, a business gets a purchase invoice from the sup-
plier. When borrowing money from the bank, a business signs a note
payable, a copy of which the business keeps. When a customer uses a
credit card to buy the business’s product, the business gets the credit
card slip as evidence of the transaction. When preparing payroll checks,
a business depends on salary rosters and time cards. All of these key
business forms serve as sources of information into the bookkeeping
system — in other words, information the bookkeeper uses in recording
the financial effects of the activities of the business.
Identify and prepare source 
documents for all transactions, 
operations, activities, and
developments that should be recorded.
Enter in source documents financial
effects and other relevant details that
apply for the transactions and other
events.
Make original entries of financial
effects of transactions and other
events, file source documents, and
build accounting database.
Carry out end-of-period procedures,
which includes recording the very
important adjusting and correcting
entries.
Prepare adjusted trial balance, to
provide the up-to-date and accurate
listing of all accounts at end of period.
Perform closing procedures at end of
fiscal year to prepare accounts for
next period.

2. Determine and enter in source documents the financial effects of the
transactions and other events of the business.
Transactions have financial effects that must be recorded — the busi-
ness is better off, worse off, or at least “different off” as the result of its
transactions. Examples of typical business transactions include paying
employees, making sales to customers, borrowing money from the bank,
and buying products that will be sold to customers. The bookkeeping
process begins by determining the relevant information about each
transaction. The chief accountant of the business establishes the rules
and methods for measuring the financial effects of transactions. Of
course, the bookkeeper should comply with these rules and methods.
3. Make original entries of financial effects into journals and accounts,
with appropriate references to source documents. 
Using the source document(s) for every transaction, the bookkeeper
makes the first, or original, entry into a journal and then into the busi-
ness’s accounts. Only the official, established chart of accounts should
be used in recording transactions. A journal is a chronological record 
of transactions in the order in which they occur — like a very detailed
personal diary. In contrast, an account is a separate record, or page as 
it were, for each asset, each liability, and so on. One transaction affects
two or more accounts. The journal entry records the whole transaction
in one place; then each piece is recorded in the two or more accounts
that are affected by the transaction.
Here’s a simple example that illustrates recording a transaction in a jour-
nal and then posting the changes caused by the transaction in the
accounts. Expecting a big demand from its customers, a retail bookstore
purchases, on credit, 50 copies of Accounting For Dummies, 4th Edition,
from the publisher, Wiley. The books are received and placed on the
shelves. (Fifty copies is a lot to put on the shelves, but my relatives
promised to rush down and buy several copies each.) The bookstore
now owns the books and also owes Wiley $650, which is the cost of the
50 copies. Here we look only at recording the purchase of the books, not
recording subsequent sales of the books and paying the bill to Wiley.
The bookstore has established a specific inventory account called
“Inventory–Trade Paperbacks” for books like mine. And the purchase 
liability to the publisher should be entered in the account “Accounts
Payable–Publishers.” So the journal entry for this purchase is recorded
as follows:
Asset:
Inventory–Trade Paperbacks
+ $650.00
Liability:
Accounts Payable–Publishers
+ $650.00
56
Part I: Opening the Books on Accounting 

This pair of changes is first recorded in one journal entry. Then, some-
time later, each change is posted, or recorded in the separate accounts —
one an asset and the other a liability.
In ancient days, bookkeepers had to record these entries by hand, and
even today there’s nothing wrong with a good hand-entry (manual)
bookkeeping system. But bookkeepers now can use computer programs
that take over many of the tedious chores of bookkeeping (see the last
section in this chapter, “Using Accounting Software”). Of course, typing
has replaced hand cramps with carpal tunnel syndrome, but at least the
work gets done more quickly and with fewer errors!
I can’t exaggerate the importance of entering transaction data correctly
and in a timely manner. The prevalence of data entry errors was one
important reason that most retailers use cash registers that read bar-
coded information on products, which more accurately capture the 
necessary information and speed up the entry of the information.
4. Perform end-of-period procedures — the critical steps for getting the
accounting records up-to-date and ready for the preparation of man-
agement accounting reports, tax returns, and financial statements.
A period is a stretch of time — from one day to one month to one quar-
ter (three months) to one year — that is determined by the needs of the
business. A year is the longest period of time that a business would wait
to prepare its financial statements. Most businesses need accounting
reports and financial statements at the end of each quarter, and many
need monthly financial statements.
Before the accounting reports can be prepared at the end of the period
(refer to Figure 3-1), the bookkeeper needs to bring the accounts of the
business up-to-date and complete the bookkeeping process. One step,
for example, is recording the depreciation expense for the period (see
Chapter 4 for more on depreciation). Another step is getting an actual
count of the business’s inventory so that the inventory records can be
adjusted to account for shoplifting, employee theft, and other losses.
The accountant needs to take the final step and check for errors in the
business’s accounts. Data entry clerks and bookkeepers may not fully
understand the unusual nature of some business transactions and may
have entered transactions incorrectly. One reason for establishing inter-
nal controls (discussed in “Enforce strong — I mean strong! — internal
controls,” later in this chapter) is to keep errors to an absolute mini-
mum. Ideally, accounts should contain very few errors at the end of the
period, but the accountant can’t make any assumptions and should
make a final check for any errors that may have fallen through the
cracks.
57
Chapter 3: Bookkeeping and Accounting Systems

5. Compile the adjusted trial balance for the accountant, which is the
basis for preparing reports, tax returns, and financial statements.
After all the end-of-period procedures have been completed, the book-
keeper compiles a complete listing of all accounts, which is called the
adjusted trial balance. Modest-sized businesses maintain hundreds of
accounts for their various assets, liabilities, owners’ equity, revenue, and
expenses. Larger businesses keep thousands of accounts, and very large
businesses may keep more than 10,000 accounts. In contrast, external
financial statements, tax returns, and internal accounting reports to
managers contain a relatively small number of accounts. For example, a
typical external balance sheet reports only 25 to 30 accounts (maybe
even fewer), and a typical income tax return contains a relatively small
number of accounts.
The accountant takes the adjusted trial balance and telescopes similar
accounts into one summary amount that is reported in a financial report
or tax return. For example, a business may keep hundreds of separate
inventory accounts, every one of which is listed in the adjusted trial bal-
ance. The accountant collapses all these accounts into one summary
inventory account that is presented in the external balance sheet of the
business. In grouping the accounts, the accountant should comply with
established financial reporting standards and income tax requirements.
6. Close the books — bring the bookkeeping for the fiscal year just
ended to a close and get things ready to begin the bookkeeping
process for the coming fiscal year.
Books is the common term for a business’s complete set of accounts. A
business’s transactions are a constant stream of activities that don’t end
tidily on the last day of the year, which can make preparing financial
statements and tax returns challenging. The business has to draw a
clear line of demarcation between activities for the year (the 12-month
accounting period) ended and the year yet to come by closing the books
for one year and starting with fresh books for the next year.
Most medium-size and larger businesses have an accounting manual that
spells out in great detail the specific accounts and procedures for recording
transactions. But all businesses change over time, and they occasionally
need to review their accounting system and make revisions. Companies do
not take this task lightly; discontinuities in the accounting system can be
major shocks and have to be carefully thought out. Nevertheless, bookkeep-
ing and accounting systems can’t remain static for very long. If these systems
were never changed, bookkeepers would still be sitting on high stools making
entries with quill pens and bottled ink in leather-bound ledgers.

Managing the Bookkeeping 
and Accounting System
In my experience, too many business managers and owners ignore their book-
keeping and accounting systems or take them for granted — unless something
goes wrong. They assume that if the books are in balance, everything is okay.
The section “Double-Entry Accounting for Single-Entry Folks,” later in this
chapter, covers exactly what it means to have “books in balance” — it does
not necessarily mean that everything is okay.
To determine whether your bookkeeping system is up to snuff, check out the
following sections, which provide a checklist of the most important elements
of a good system.
Categorize your financial information: 
The chart of accounts
Suppose that you’re the accountant for a corporation and you’re faced with
the daunting task of preparing the annual federal income tax return for the
business. This demands that you report the following kinds of expenses (and
this list contains just the minimum!):
 Advertising
 Bad debts
 Charitable contributions
 Compensation of officers
 Cost of goods sold
 Depreciation
 Employee benefit programs
 Interest
 Pensions and profit-sharing plans
 Rents
 Repairs and maintenance
 Salaries and wages
 Taxes and licenses
59
Chapter 3: Bookkeeping and Accounting Systems

You must provide additional information for some of these expenses. For
example, the cost of goods sold expense is determined in a schedule that
also requires inventory cost at the beginning of the year, purchases during
the year, cost of labor during the year (for manufacturers), other costs, and
inventory cost at year-end.
Where do you start? Well, if it’s March 1 and the tax return deadline is March
15, you start by panicking — unless you were smart enough to think ahead
about the kinds of information your business would need to report. In fact,
when your accountant first designs your business’s accounting system, he or
she should dissect every report to managers, the external financial state-
ments, and the tax returns, breaking down all the information into categories
such as those I just listed.
For each category, you need an account, a record of the activities in that cate-
gory. An account is basically a focused history of a particular dimension of a
business. Individuals can have accounts, too — for example, your checkbook
is an account of the cash inflows and outflows and the balance of your check-
ing account (assuming that you remember to record all activities and recon-
cile your checkbook against your bank statement). I doubt that you keep a
written account of the coin and currency in your wallet, pockets, glove com-
partment, and sofa cushions, but a business needs to. An account serves as
the source of information for preparing financial statements, tax returns, and
reports to managers.
The term general ledger refers to the complete set of accounts established
and maintained by a business. The chart of accounts is the formal index of
these accounts — the complete listing and classification of the accounts used
by the business to record its transactions. General ledger usually refers to the
actual accounts and often to the balances in these accounts at some particu-
lar time.
The chart of accounts, even for a relatively small business, normally contains
100 or more accounts. Larger business organizations need thousands of
accounts. The larger the number, the more likely that the accounts are given
number codes according to some scheme — for example, all assets may be in
the 100 to 300 range, all liabilities in the 400 to 500 range, and so on.
As a business manager, you should make sure that the controller (chief
accountant), or perhaps an outside CPA consultant, reviews the chart of
accounts periodically to determine whether the accounts are up-to-date and
adequate for the business’s needs. Over time, income tax rules change, the
company goes into new lines of business, the company adopts new employee
benefit plans, and so on. Most businesses are in constant flux, and the chart
of accounts has to keep up with these changes.
60

Standardize source document 
forms and procedures
It’s said that armies move on their stomachs. Well, businesses move on their
paperwork. Placing an order to buy products, selling a product to a customer,
determining the earnings of an employee for the month — virtually every
business transaction needs paperwork, generally known as source documents.
Source documents serve as evidence of the terms and conditions agreed
upon by the business and the other person or organization that it’s dealing
with. Both parties receive some kind of source document. For example, for a
sale at a cash register, the customer gets a sales receipt, and the business
keeps a running tape of all transactions in the register.
61
Chapter 3: Bookkeeping and Accounting Systems
More than you may want to know right 
now about types of accounts
Accounts fall into two basic types according to
which financial statement their balances are
reported in:
 Balance sheet accounts: Assets, liabilities,
and owners’ equity accounts
 Income statement accounts: Revenue and
income accounts, and expense and loss
accounts
In other words, the accounts are divided
between those that constitute the financial con-
dition of the business (assets, liabilities, and
owners’ equity accounts) and those that sum-
marize the profit-making activities of the busi-
ness (revenue and expenses, plus income and
loss accounts).
In actual practice a business needs other types
of accounts as well. For example, a business
keeps so-called contra accounts, which are the
negative side of certain accounts. The two main
examples are these:
 Accumulated depreciation, the balance of
which is deducted from the original cost
balance of long-term operating assets that
are being depreciated over time
 Allowance for doubtful accounts, the bal-
ance of which is deducted from the balance
of the accounts receivable asset account in
anticipation that some receivables will not
be collected
Note: Although a business reports a statement
of cash flows, in addition to its balance sheet
and income statement, the cash flow amounts
that are reported in the cash flow statement are
prepared from information already included in
the balance sheet and income statement
accounts (see Chapter 6). So rest assured that
the balance sheet and income statement
accounts taken together are all the accounts a
business needs.

Clearly, an accounting system needs to standardize the forms and procedures
for processing and recording all normal, repetitive transactions and should
control the generation and handling of these source documents. From the
bookkeeping point of view, these business forms and documents are very
important because they provide the input information needed for recording
transactions in the business’s accounts. Sloppy paperwork leads to sloppy
accounting records, and sloppy accounting records just won’t do when the
time comes to prepare tax returns and financial statements.
If you’re the owner of a small business, you may want to check out an office
supply store to see the kinds of forms that you can buy right off the shelf. You
can find many of the basic forms and documents that you need for recording
business transactions. Also, computer accounting software packages today
include templates for most business forms and source documents needed by
a business.
Hire competent, trained personnel
A business shouldn’t be penny-wise and pound-foolish: What good is meticu-
lously collecting source documents if the information on those documents
isn’t entered into your system correctly? You shouldn’t try to save a few
bucks by hiring the lowest-paid people you can find. Bookkeepers and
accountants, like all other employees in a business, should have the skills
and knowledge needed to perform their functions. Here are some guidelines
for choosing the right people to enter and control the flow of your business’s
data and for making sure that those people remain the right people:
 College degree: Many accountants in business organizations have a 
college degree with a major in accounting. However, as you move down
the accounting department, you find that more and more employees do
not have a college degree and perhaps don’t even have any courses in
accounting — they learned bookkeeping methods and skills through 
on-the-job training. Although these employees may have good skills 
and instincts, my experience has been that they tend to do things by the
book; they often lack the broader perspective necessary for improvising
and being innovative. So you want to at least look twice at a potential
employee who has no college-based accounting background.
 CPA or CMA: When hiring higher-level accountants in a business organi-
zation, you want to determine whether they should be certified public
accountants (CPAs). Most larger businesses insist on this credential,
along with a specific number of years’ experience in public accounting.
The other main professional accounting credential is the CMA, or certi-
fied management accountant, sponsored by the Institute of Management
Accountants (IMA). Unlike the CPA license (which I discuss in Chapter
1), the CMA designation of professional achievement is not regulated by
the state. The CMA is evidence that the person has passed tough exams
and has a good understanding of business accounting and income tax.
62
Part I: Opening the Books on Accounting 

In my opinion, a business is prudent to require the CPA or CMA creden-
tial for its chief accountant (who usually holds the title of controller), 
or a business should regularly consult with a CPA in public practice for
advice on its accounting system and on accounting problems that 
come up.
 Continuing education: Bookkeepers and accountants need continuing
education to keep up with changes in the income tax law and financial
reporting requirements, as well as changes in how the business oper-
ates. Ideally, bookkeepers and accountants should be able to spot
needed improvements and implement these changes — to make
accounting reports to managers more useful, for example. Fortunately,
many short-term courses, home-study programs, and the like are avail-
able at very reasonable costs for keeping up on the latest accounting
developments. Many continuing education courses are available on the
Internet, but be sure to check out the standards of an Internet course.
States require that CPAs in public practice take 30 to 40 hours per year
of continuing education in approved courses to keep their licenses.
 Integrity: What’s possibly the most important quality to look for is also
the hardest to judge. Bookkeepers and accountants need to be honest
people because of the control they have over your business’s financial
records. Conduct a careful background check when hiring new account-
ing personnel. After you hire them, periodically (and discreetly) check
whether their lifestyles match their salaries. Small-business owners and
managers have closer day-in and day-out contact with their accountants
and bookkeepers, which can be a real advantage — they get to know
their accountants and bookkeepers on a personal level. Even so, you can
find many cases where a trusted bookkeeper has embezzled many thou-
sands of dollars over the years. I could tell you many true stories about
long-time, “trusted” bookkeepers that made off with some of the family
fortune.
Enforce strong — I mean strong! — 
internal controls
Any accounting system worth its salt should establish and vigorously enforce
effective internal controls — basically, additional forms and procedures over
and above what’s needed strictly to move operations along. These additional
procedures serve to deter and detect errors (honest mistakes) and all forms
of dishonesty by employees, customers, suppliers, and even managers them-
selves. Unfortunately, many businesses pay only lip service to internal con-
trols; they don’t put into place good internal controls, or they don’t seriously
enforce their internal controls (they just go through the motions).
63
Chapter 3: Bookkeeping and Accounting Systems

Internal controls are like highway truck weigh stations, which make sure that
a truck’s load doesn’t exceed the limits and that the truck has a valid plate.
You’re just checking that your staff is playing by the rules. For example, to
prevent or minimize shoplifting, most retailers now have video surveillance,
as well as tags that set off the alarms if the customer leaves the store with the
tag still on the product. Likewise, a business should implement certain proce-
dures and forms to prevent (as much as possible) theft, embezzlement, kick-
backs, fraud, and simple mistakes by its own employees and managers.
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 applies to public companies that are subject
to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) jurisdiction. Congress
passed this law mainly in response to Enron and other massive financial
64

Internal controls against mistakes and theft
Accounting is characterized by a lot of paper-
work — forms and procedures are plentiful.
Most business managers and employees have
their enthusiasm under control when it comes
to the paperwork and procedures that the
accounting department requires. One reason
for this attitude, in my experience, is that non-
accountants fail to appreciate the need for
accounting controls.
These internal controls are designed to mini-
mize errors in bookkeeping, which has to
process a great deal of detailed information and
data. Equally important, controls are necessary
to deter employee fraud, embezzlement, and
theft, as well as fraud and dishonest behavior
against the business from the outside. Every
business is a target for fraud and theft, such as
customers who shoplift; suppliers who deliber-
ately ship less than the quantities invoiced to a
business and hope that the business won’t
notice the difference (called short-counts); and
even dishonest managers themselves, who may
pad expense accounts or take kickbacks from
suppliers or customers.
For these reasons a business should take steps to
avoid being an easy target for dishonest behavior
by its employees, customers, and suppliers. Every
business should institute and enforce certain 
control measures, many of which are integrated
into the accounting process. Following are five
common examples of internal control procedures:
 Requiring a second signature on cash dis-
bursements over a certain dollar amount
 Matching up receiving reports based on
actual counts and inspections of incoming
shipments with purchase orders before cut-
ting checks for payment to suppliers
 Requiring both a sales manager’s and
another high-level manager’s approval for
write-offs of customers’ overdue receivable
balances (that is, closing the accounts on
the assumption that they won’t be col-
lected), including a checklist of collection
efforts that were undertaken
 Having auditors or employees who do not
work in the warehouse take surprise counts
of products stored in the company’s ware-
house and compare the counts with inven-
tory records
 Requiring mandatory vacations by every
employee, including bookkeepers and
accountants, during which time someone
else does that person’s job (because a
second person may notice irregularities or
deviations from company policies)

reporting fraud disasters. The act, which is implemented through the SEC
and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB), requires that
public companies establish and enforce a special module of internal controls
over their financial reporting. You can find more on this topic in Chapter 15,
where I discuss audits and accounting fraud. Although the law applies only to
public companies, some accountants worry that the requirements of the law
will have a trickle-down effect on smaller private businesses as well.
In my experience, smaller businesses tend to think that they’re immune to
embezzlement and fraud by their loyal and trusted employees. These are per-
sonal friends, after all. Yet, in fact, many small businesses are hit very hard
by fraud and usually can least afford the consequences. Most studies of fraud
in small businesses have found that the average loss is well into six figures!
You know, even in a friendly game of poker with my buddies, we always cut
the deck before dealing the cards around the table. Your business, too,
should put checks and balances into place to discourage dishonest practices
and to uncover any fraud and theft as soon as possible.
Complete the process with 
end-of-period procedures
Suppose that all transactions during the year have been recorded correctly.
Therefore, the accounts of the business are ready for preparing its financial
statements, aren’t they? Not so fast! Certain additional procedures are neces-
sary at the end of the period to bring the accounts up to snuff for preparing
financial statements for the year. Two main things have to be done at the end
of the period:
 Record normal, routine adjusting entries: For example, depreciation
expense isn’t a transaction as such and therefore isn’t included in the
flow of transactions recorded in the day-to-day bookkeeping process.
(Chapter 4 explains depreciation expense.) Similarly, certain other
expenses and income may not have been associated with a specific
transaction and, therefore, have not been recorded. These kinds of
adjustments are necessary to have correct balances for determining
profit for the period, such as, to make the revenue, income, expense, 
and loss accounts up-to-date and correct for the year.
 Make a careful sweep of all matters to check for other developments
that may affect the accuracy of the accounts: For example, the com-
pany may have discontinued a product line. The remaining inventory of
these products may have to be removed from the asset account, with a
corresponding loss recorded in the period. Or the company may have
settled a long-standing lawsuit, and the amount of damages needs to be
recorded. Layoffs and severance packages are another example of what
the chief accountant needs to look for before preparing reports.
65
Chapter 3: Bookkeeping and Accounting Systems

Lest you still think of accounting as dry and dull, let me tell you that end-of-
period accounting procedures can stir up controversy of the heated-debate
variety. These procedures require that the accountant make decisions and
judgment calls that upper management may not agree with. For example, the
accountant may suggest recording major losses that would put a big dent in
profit for the year or cause the business to report a loss. The outside CPA
auditor (assuming that the business has an independent audit of its financial
statements) often gets in the middle of the argument. These kinds of debates
are precisely why business managers need to know some accounting: to hold
up your end of the argument and participate in the great sport of yelling and
name-calling — strictly on a professional basis, of course.
Leave good audit trails
Good bookkeeping systems leave good audit trails. An audit trail is a clear-cut
path of the sequence of events leading up to an entry in the accounts. An
accountant starts with the source documents and follows through the book-
keeping steps in recording transactions to reconstruct this path. Even if a
business doesn’t have an outside CPA do an annual audit, the accountant 
has frequent occasion to go back to the source documents and either verify
certain information in the accounts or reconstruct the information in a differ-
ent manner. Suppose that a salesperson is claiming some suspicious-looking
travel expenses; the accountant would probably want to go through all this
person’s travel and entertainment reimbursements for the past year.
If the IRS comes in for a field audit of your business, you’d better have good
audit trails to substantiate all your expense deductions and sales revenue for
the year. The IRS has rules about saving source documents for a reasonable
period of time and having a well-defined process for making bookkeeping
entries and keeping accounts. Think twice before throwing away source doc-
uments too soon. Also, ask your accountant to demonstrate and lay out for
your inspection the audit trails for key transactions, such as cash collections,
sales, cash disbursements, and inventory purchases. Even computer-based
accounting systems recognize the importance of audit trails. Well-designed
computer programs provide the ability to backtrack through the sequence of
steps in the recording of specific transactions.
Look out for unusual events 
and developments
Business managers should encourage their accountants to be alert to 
anything out of the ordinary that may require attention. Suppose that the
accounts receivable balance for a customer is rapidly increasing — that is,
the customer is buying more and more from your company on credit but isn’t
66
Part I: Opening the Books on Accounting 

paying for these purchases quickly. Maybe the customer has switched more
of his company’s purchases to your business and is buying more from you
only because he is buying less from other businesses. But maybe the cus-
tomer is planning to stiff your business and take off without paying his debts.
Or maybe the customer is planning to go into bankruptcy soon and is stock-
piling products before the company’s credit rating heads south.
Don’t forget internal time bombs: A bookkeeper’s reluctance to take a vaca-
tion could mean that she doesn’t want anyone else looking at the books.
To some extent, accountants have to act as the eyes and ears of the business.
Of course, that’s one of the main functions of a business manager as well, but
the accounting staff can play an important role.
Design truly useful reports for managers
I have to be careful in this section; I have strong opinions on this matter. I
have seen too many off-the-mark accounting reports to managers — reports
that are difficult to decipher and not very useful or relevant to the manager’s
decision-making needs and control functions.
Part of the problem lies with the managers themselves. As a business 
manager, have you told your accounting staff what you need to know, when
you need it, and how to present it in the most efficient manner? When you
stepped into your position, you probably didn’t hesitate to rearrange your
office, and maybe you even insisted on hiring your own support staff. Yet you
most likely lay down like a lapdog regarding your accounting reports. Maybe
you assume that the reports have to be done a certain way and that arguing
for change is no use.
On the other hand, accountants bear a good share of the blame for poor man-
agement reports. Accountants should proactively study the manager’s deci-
sion-making responsibilities and provide the information that is most useful,
presented in the most easily digestible manner.
In designing the chart of accounts, the accountant should keep in mind the
type of information needed for management reports. To exercise control,
managers need much more detail than what’s reported on tax returns and
external financial statements. And as I explain in Chapter 9, expenses should
be regrouped into different categories for management decision-making
analysis. A good chart of accounts looks to both the external and the internal
(management) needs for information.
67
Chapter 3: Bookkeeping and Accounting Systems

So what’s the answer for a manager who receives poorly formatted reports?
Demand a report format that suits your needs! See Chapter 9 for a useful
profit analysis model, and show it to your accountant as well.
Double-Entry Accounting 
for Single-Entry Folks
Businesses and nonprofit entities use double-entry accounting. But I’ve never
met an individual who uses double-entry accounting in personal bookkeep-
ing. Instead, individuals use single-entry accounting. For example, when you
write a check to make a payment on your credit card balance, you undoubt-
edly make an entry in your checkbook to decrease your bank balance. And
that’s it. You make just one entry — to decrease your checking account bal-
ance. It wouldn’t occur to you to make a second, companion entry to
decrease your credit card liability balance. Why? Because you don’t keep a
liability account for what you owe on your credit card. You depend on the
credit card company to make an entry to decrease your balance.
Businesses and nonprofit entities have to keep track of their liabilities as well
as their assets. And they have to keep track of all sources of their assets.
(Some part of their total assets comes from money invested by their owners,
for example.) When a business writes a check to pay one of its liabilities, it
makes a two-sided (or double) entry — one to decrease its cash balance and
the second to decrease the liability. This is double-entry accounting in action.
Double-entry does not mean a transaction is recorded twice; it means both
sides of the transaction are recorded at the same time.
Double-entry accounting pivots off the accounting equation:
Total assets = Total liabilities + 
Total owners’ equity
The accounting equation is a very condensed version of the balance sheet.
The balance sheet is the financial statement that summarizes a business’s
assets on the one side and its liabilities plus its owners’ equity on the other
side. Liabilities and owners’ equity are the sources of its assets. Each source
has different claims on the assets, which I explain in Chapter 5.
One main function of the bookkeeping/accounting system is to record all
transactions of a business — every single last one. If you look at transactions
through the lens of the accounting equation, there is a beautiful symmetry in
transactions (well, beautiful to accountants at least). All transactions have a
68
Part I: Opening the Books on Accounting 

natural balance. The sum of financial effects on one side of a transaction
equals the sum of financial effects on the other side.
Suppose a business buys a new delivery truck for $65,000 and pays by check.
The truck asset account increases by the $65,000 cost of the truck, and cash
decreases $65,000. Here’s another example: A company borrows $2 million
from its bank. Its cash increases $2 million, and the liability for its note
payable to the bank increases the same amount.
Just one more example: Suppose a business suffers a loss from a tornado
because some of its assets were not insured (dumb!). The assets destroyed
by the tornado are written off (decreased to zero balances), and the amount
of the loss decreases owners’ equity the same amount. The loss works its
way through the income statement but ends up as a decrease in owners’
equity.
Virtually all business bookkeeping systems use debits and credits for making
sure that both sides of transactions are recorded and for keeping the two
sides of the accounting equation in balance. A change in an account is
recorded as either a debit or a credit according to the following rules:
Assets
=
Liabilities
+
Owners’ Equity
+ Debit
+ Credit
+ Credit
– Credit
– Debit
– Debit
An increase in an asset is tagged as a debit; an increase in a liability or
owners’ equity account is tagged as a credit. Decreases are just the reverse.
Following this scheme, the total of debits must equal the total of credits in
recording every transaction. In brief: Debits have to equal credits. Isn’t that
clever? Well, the main point is that the method works. Debits and credits
have been used for centuries. (A book published in 1494 described how 
business traders and merchants of the day used debits and credits in their
bookkeeping.)
Note: Sales revenue and expense accounts also follow debit and credit rules.
Revenue increases owners’ equity (thus is a credit), and an expense
decreases owners’ equity (thus is a debit).
The balance in an account at a point in time equals the increases less the
decreases recorded in the account. Following the rules of debits and credits,
asset accounts have debit balances, and liabilities and owners’ equity
accounts have credit balances. (Yes, a balance sheet account can have 
a wrong-way balance in unusual situations, such as cash having a credit 
balance because the business has written more checks than it has in its
69
Chapter 3: Bookkeeping and Accounting Systems

checking account.) The total of accounts with debit balances should equal
the total of accounts with credit balances. When the total of debit balance
accounts equals the total of credit balance accounts, the books are in 
balance.
Balanced books don’t necessarily mean that all accounts have correct bal-
ances. Errors are still possible. The bookkeeper may have recorded debits or
credits in wrong accounts, or may have entered wrong amounts, or may have
missed recording some transactions altogether. Having balanced books
simply means that the total of accounts with debit balances equals the total
of accounts with credit balances. The important thing is whether the books
(the accounts) have correct balances, which depends on whether all transac-
tions and other developments have been recorded correctly.
Juggling the Books to Conceal
Embezzlement and Fraud
Fraud and illegal practices occur in large corporations and in one-owner/
manager-controlled small businesses — and in every size business in
between. Some types of fraud are more common in small businesses, includ-
ing sales skimming (not recording all sales revenue, to deflate the taxable
income of the business and its owner) and the recording of personal
expenses through the business (to make these expenses deductible for
income tax). Some kinds of fraud are committed mainly by large businesses,
including paying bribes to public officials and entering into illegal conspira-
cies to fix prices or divide the market. The purchasing managers in any size
business can be tempted to accept kickbacks and under-the-table payoffs
from vendors and suppliers.
Some years ago we hosted a Russian professor who was a dedicated
Communist. I asked him what surprised him the most on his first visit to the
United States. Without hesitation he answered “The Wall Street Journal.” I 
was puzzled. He then explained that he was amazed to read so many stories
about business fraud and illegal practices in the most respected financial
newspaper in the world. At the time of revising this chapter, the backdating
of management stock options is very much in the news. Many financial
reporting fraud stories are on the front pages. And there are a number of sto-
ries of companies that agreed to pay large fines for illegal practices (usually
without admitting guilt).
70
Part I: Opening the Books on Accounting 

I’m fairly sure that none of this is news to you. You know that fraud and illegal
practices happen in the business world. My point in bringing up this unpleas-
ant topic is that fraud and illegal practices require manipulation of a busi-
ness’s accounts. For example, if a business pays a bribe it does not record
the amount in a bald-faced account called “bribery expense.” Rather the busi-
ness disguises the payment by recording it in a legitimate expense account
(such as repairs and maintenance expense, or legal expense). If a business
records sales revenue before sales have taken place (a not uncommon type 
of fraud), it does not record the false revenue in a separate account called
“fictional sales revenue.” The bogus sales are recorded in the regular sales
revenue account.
Here’s another example of an illegal practice. Money laundering involves
taking money from illegal sources (such as drug dealing) and passing it
through a business to make it look legitimate — to give the money a false
identity. This money can hardly be recorded as “revenue from drug sales” 
in the accounts of the business. If an employee embezzles money from the
business, he has to cover his tracks by making false entries in the accounts
or by not making entries that should be recorded.
71
Chapter 3: Bookkeeping and Accounting Systems
A gray area in financial reporting
In some situations, the same person or the
same group of investors controls two or more
businesses. Revenue and expenses can be
arbitrarily shifted among the different business
entities under common control. For one person
to have a controlling ownership interest in two
or more businesses is perfectly legal, and such
an arrangement often makes good business
sense. For example, a retail business rents a
building from a real estate business, and the
same person is the majority owner of both busi-
nesses. The problem arises when that person
arbitrarily sets the monthly rent to shift profit
between the two businesses; a high rent gen-
erates more profit for the real estate business
and lower profit for the retail business. This kind
of maneuver may be legal, but it raises a touchy
accounting issue.
Readers of financial statements are entitled to
assume that all activities between the business
and the other parties it deals with are based on
what’s called arm’s-length bargaining, meaning
that the business and the other parties have a
purely business relationship. When that’s not
the case, the financial report should — but usu-
ally doesn’t — use the term related parties to
describe persons and organizations that are not
at arm’s length with the business. According to
financial reporting standards, a business should
disclose any substantial related-party transac-
tions in its external financial statements.

Manipulating accounts to conceal fraud, illegal activities, and embezzlement
is generally called juggling the accounts. Another term you probably have
heard is cooking the books. Although this term is sometimes used in the same
sense of juggling the accounts, the term cooking the books more often refers
to deliberate accounting fraud, in which the main purpose is to produce
financial statements that tell a better story than are supported by the facts.
When the accounts have been juggled or the books have been cooked, the
financial statements of the business are distorted, incorrect, and misleading.
Lenders, other creditors, and the owners who have capital invested in the
business rely on the company’s financial statements. Also, a business’s man-
agers and board of directors (the group of people who oversee a business
corporation) may be misled — assuming that they’re not a party to the fraud,
of course — and may also have liability to third-party creditors and investors
for their failure to catch the fraud. Creditors and investors who end up suffer-
ing losses have legal grounds to sue the managers and directors (and per-
haps the independent auditors who did not catch the fraud) for damages
suffered.
I think that most persons who engage in fraud cheat on their federal income
taxes; they don’t declare the ill-gotten income. Needless to say, the IRS is on
constant alert for fraud in federal income tax returns, both business and per-
sonal returns. The IRS has the authority to come in and audit the books of the
business and also the personal income tax returns of its managers and
investors. Conviction for income tax evasion is a felony, I might point out.
Using Accounting Software
It would be possible, though not very likely, that a very small business would
keep its books the old-fashioned way — record all transactions and do all the
other steps of the bookkeeping cycle with pen and paper and by making
handwritten entries. However, even a small business has a relatively large
number of transactions that have to be recorded in journals and accounts, to
say nothing about the end-of-period steps in the bookkeeping cycle (refer to
Figure 3-1).
When mainframe computers were introduced in the 1950s and 1960s, one of
their very first uses was for accounting chores. However, only large busi-
nesses could afford these electronic behemoths. Smaller businesses didn’t
use computers for their accounting until some years after personal comput-
ers came along in the 1980s. But, as the saying goes, “We’ve come a long way,
baby.” A bewildering array of accounting computer software packages is
available today.
72
Part I: Opening the Books on Accounting 

There are accounting software packages for every size business, from small
(say, $5 million annual sales or less and 20 employees or less) to very large
($500 million annual sales and up and 500 employees or more). Developing
and marketing accounting software is a booming business. You could go to
Google or Yahoo and type “accounting software” in the search field, but be
prepared for many, many references. Except for larger entities that employ
their own accounting software and information technology experts, most
businesses need the advice and help of outside consultants in choosing,
implementing, upgrading, and replacing accounting software.
If I were giving a talk to owners/managers of small to middle-size businesses, I
would offer the following words of wisdom about accounting software:
 Choose your accounting software very carefully. It’s very hard to pull up
stakes and switch to another software package. Changing even just one
module in your accounting software can be difficult.
 In evaluating accounting software, you and your accountant should con-
sider three main factors: ease of use; whether it has the particular fea-
tures and functionality you need; and the likelihood that the vendor will
continue in business and be around to update and make improvements
in the software.
 In real estate, the prime concern is “location, location, location.” The
watchwords in accounting software are “security, security, security.” 
You need very tight controls over all aspects of using the accounting
software and who is authorized to make changes in any of the modules
of the accounting software.
 Although accounting software offers the opportunity to exploit your
accounting information (mine the data), you have to know exactly what
to look for. The software does not do this automatically. You have to ask
for the exact type of information you want and insist that it be pulled out
of the accounting data.
 Even when using advanced, sophisticated accounting software, a busi-
ness has to design the specialized reports it needs for its various man-
agers and make sure that these reports are generated correctly from the
accounting database.
 Never forget the “garbage in, garbage out” rule. Data entry errors can be
a serious problem in computer-based accounting systems. You can mini-
mize these input errors, but it is next to impossible to eliminate them
altogether. Even barcode readers make mistakes, and the barcode tags
themselves may have been tampered with. Strong internal controls for
the verification of data entry are extremely important.
73
Chapter 3: Bookkeeping and Accounting Systems

 Make sure your accounting software leaves very good audit trails, which
you need for management control, for your CPA when auditing your
financial statements, and for the IRS when it decides to audit your
income tax returns. The lack of good audit trails looks very suspicious
to the IRS.
 Online accounting systems that permit remote input and access over 
the Internet or a local area network with multiple users present special
security problems. Think twice before putting your accounting system
online.
Smaller businesses, and even many medium-size businesses, don’t have the
budget to hire full-time information system and information technology special-
ists. They use consultants to help them select accounting software packages,
install software, and get it up and running. Like other computer software,
accounting programs are frequently revised and updated. A consultant can 
help keep a business’s accounting software up-to-date, correct flaws and secu-
rity weaknesses in the program, and take advantage of its latest features.

Financial
Statements

In this part . . .
F
inancially speaking, managers, owners, and lenders
want to know three basic things about a business: its
profit or loss, its financial condition, and its cash flows.
Accountants answer this call for information by preparing
on a regular basis three financial statements, which are
detailed in this part.
The income statement summarizes the profit-making activi-
ties of the business and its bottom-line profit or loss for
the period. The balance sheet reports the financial posi-
tion of the business at a point in time — usually the last
day of the profit period. The statement of cash flows
reports the amount of cash generated from profit and
other sources of cash during the period, and what the
business did with this money. Its financial statements tell
the financial story of the business, for good or bad.
One word of caution: The numbers you see in its financial
statements depend, to a significant extent, on which
accounting methods the business chooses. Businesses
have more accounting alternatives than you may think. 
In painting the financial picture of a business, the accoun-
tant can use somber or vivid colors from the palette of
acceptable accounting methods.

n this chapter, I lift up the hood and explain how the profit engine runs.
Making a profit is the main financial goal of a business. (Not-for-profit orga-
nizations and government entities don’t aim to make profit, but they should
at least avoid a deficit.) Accountants are the designated financial scorekeep-
ers in the business world. Accountants are professional profit-measurers. I
find profit accounting a fascinating challenge. For one thing, you have to
understand how a business operates and its strategies in order to account for
its profit.
Making a profit and accounting for it aren’t nearly as simple as you may 
think. Managers have the demanding tasks of making sales and controlling
expenses, and accountants have the tough tasks of measuring revenue and
expenses and preparing reports that summarize the profit-making activities.
Also, accountants are called on to help business managers analyze profit for
decision-making, which I explain in Chapter 9. And accountants prepare
profit budgets for managers, which I cover in Chapter 10.
This chapter focuses on the financial consequences of making profit and how
profit activities are reported in a business’s external financial reports to its
owners and lenders. In the United States, generally accepted accounting prin-
ciples (GAAP) govern the recording and reporting of profit; see Chapter 2 for
details about GAAP.

Presenting a Typical Income Statement
At the risk of oversimplification, I would say that businesses make profit
three basic ways:
 Selling products (with allied services) and controlling the cost of the
products sold and other operating costs
 Selling services and controlling the cost of providing the services and
other operating costs
 Investing in assets that generate investment income and market value
gains and controlling operating costs
Obviously, this list isn’t exhaustive, but it captures a large slice of business
activity. In this chapter, I concentrate on the first category of activity: selling
products. Products range from automobiles to computers to food to clothes
to jewelry. The customers of a business may be the final consumers in the
economic chain, or a business may sell to other businesses.
Figure 4-1 presents a typical profit report for a product-oriented business;
this report, called the income statement, would be sent to its outside owners
and lenders. The report could just as easily be called the net income state-
ment because the bottom-line profit term preferred by accountants is net
income, but the word net is dropped off the title. Alternative titles for the
external profit report include earnings statement, operating statement, state-
ment of operating results, and statement of earnings. (Note that profit reports
distributed to managers inside a business are usually called P&L [profit and
loss] statements, but this moniker is not used in external financial reporting.)

Part II: Figuring Out Financial Statements 

The heading of an income statement identifies the business (which in this
example is incorporated — thus the term “Inc.” following the name), the
financial statement title (“Income Statement”), and the time period summa-
rized by the statement (“Year Ended December 31, 2009”). I explain the legal
organization structures of businesses in Chapter 8.
You may be tempted to start reading an income statement at the bottom line.
But this financial report is designed for you to read from the top line (sales
revenue) and proceed down to the last — the bottom line (net income). Each
step down the ladder in an income statement involves the deduction of an
expense. In Figure 4-1, four expenses are deducted from the sales revenue
amount, and four profit lines are given: gross margin; operating earnings;
earnings before income tax; and, finally, net income.
If a business sells services and does not sell products, it does not have a cost
of goods sold expense; therefore, the company does not show a gross margin
line. On the other hand, some service-based businesses disclose a “cost of
sales expense” that is analogous to the cost of goods sold expense reported
by product-based companies, in which case a gross margin line is reported. I
should caution you that you find many variations on the basic income state-
ment example I show in Figure 4-1. In particular, a business has a fair amount
of latitude regarding the number of expense lines to disclose in its external
income statement.
I can’t stress enough that the dollar amounts you see in an income statement
are flow amounts, or cumulative measures of activities during a period of time
(one year in Figure 4-1). To illustrate, suppose that the average sale of the
business in the example is $2,600. Therefore, the business made 10,000 sales
and recorded 10,000 sales transactions over the course of the year ($2,600 per
sale × 10,000 sale transactions = $26 million). The sales revenue amount (see
Figure 4-1) is the cumulative total of all sales made from January 1 through
December 31. Likewise for the expenses: For example, the cost of goods sold
expense is the cost of all products sold to customers in the 10,000 sales trans-
actions during the year, and the interest expense is the total of all interest
transactions recorded during the year.
Taking care of some housekeeping details
I want to point out a few things about income statements that accountants
assume everyone knows but, in fact, are not obvious to many people.
(Accountants do this a lot: They assume that the people using financial state-
ments know a good deal about the customs and conventions of financial
reporting, so they don’t make things as clear as they could.) For an accoun-
tant, the following facts are second-nature:
79
Chapter 4: Reporting Revenue, Expenses, and the Bottom Line

 Minus signs are missing. Expenses are deductions from sales revenue,
but hardly ever do you see minus signs in front of expense amounts to
indicate that they are deductions. Forget about minus signs in income
statements, and in other financial statements as well. Sometimes paren-
theses are put around a deduction to signal that it’s a negative number,
but that’s the most you can expect to see.
 Your eye is drawn to the bottom line. Putting a double underline under
the final (bottom-line) profit number for emphasis is common practice
but not universal. Instead, net income may be shown in bold type. You
generally don’t see anything as garish as a fat arrow pointing to the
profit number or a big smiley encircling the profit number — but again,
tastes vary.
 Profit isn’t usually called profit. As you see in Figure 4-1, bottom-line
profit is called net income. Businesses use other terms as well, such as
net earnings or just earnings. (Can’t accountants agree on anything?) In
this book, I use the terms net income and profit interchangeably.
 You don’t get details about sales revenue. The sales revenue amount in
an income statement is the combined total of all sales during the year;
you can’t tell how many different sales were made, how many different
customers the company sold products to, or how the sales were distrib-
uted over the 12 months of the year. (Public companies are required to
release quarterly income statements during the year, and they include a
special summary of quarter-by-quarter results in their annual financial
reports; private businesses may or may not release quarterly sales
data.) Sales revenue does not include sales and excise taxes that the
business collects from its customers and remits to the government.
Note: In addition to sales revenue from selling products and/or services,
a business may have income from other sources. For instance, a busi-
ness may have earnings from investments in marketable securities. In its
income statement, investment income goes on a separate line and is not
commingled with sales revenue. (The business featured in Figure 4-1
does not have investment income.)
 Gross margin matters. The cost of goods sold expense is the cost of
products sold to customers, the sales revenue of which is reported 
on the sales revenue line. The idea is to match up the sales revenue 
of goods sold with the cost of goods sold and show the gross margin
(also called gross profit), which is the profit before other expenses are
deducted. The other expenses could in total be more than gross margin,
in which case the business would have a loss for the period.
Note: Companies that sell services rather than products (such as air-
lines, movie theaters, and CPA firms) do not have a cost of goods sold
expense line in their income statements, although as I mention above,
some service companies report a cost of sales expense and a corre-
sponding gross margin line.
80
Part II: Figuring Out Financial Statements 

 Operating costs are lumped together. The broad category selling, gen-
eral, and administrative expenses (refer to Figure 4-1) consists of a wide
variety of costs of operating the business and making sales. Some exam-
ples are:
• Labor costs (wages, salaries, and benefits paid to employees)
• Insurance premiums
• Property taxes on buildings and land
• Cost of gas and electric utilities
• Travel and entertainment costs
• Telephone and Internet charges
• Depreciation of operating assets that are used more than one year
(including buildings, land improvements, cars and trucks, comput-
ers, office furniture, tools and machinery, and shelving)
• Advertising and sales promotion expenditures
• Legal and audit costs
As with sales revenue, you don’t get much detail about operating
expenses in a typical income statement.
Your job: Asking questions!
The worst thing you can do when presented with an income statement is to
be a passive reader. You should be inquisitive. An income statement is not
fulfilling its purpose unless you grab it by its numbers and starting asking
questions.
For example, you should be curious regarding the size of the business (see
the nearby sidebar “How big is a big business, and how small is a small 
business?”). Another question to ask is: How does profit compare with sales
revenue for the year? Profit (net income) equals what’s left over from sales
revenue after you deduct all expenses. The business featured in Figure 4-1
squeezed $1.69 million profit from its $26 million sales revenue for the year,
which equals 6.5 percent. This ratio of profit to sales revenue means
expenses absorbed 93.5 percent of sales revenue. Although it may seem
rather thin, a 6.5 percent profit margin on sales is quite acceptable for many
businesses. (Some businesses consistently make a bottom-line profit of 10 
to 20 percent of sales, and others are satisfied with a 1 or 2 percent profit
margin on sales revenue.) Profit ratios on sales vary widely from industry to
industry.
81
Chapter 4: Reporting Revenue, Expenses, and the Bottom Line

GAAP are relatively silent regarding which expenses have to be disclosed 
on the face of an income statement or elsewhere in a financial report. For
example, the amount a business spends on advertising does not have to be
disclosed. (In contrast, the rules for filing financial reports with the Securities
and Exchange Commission [SEC] require disclosure of certain expenses, such
as repairs and maintenance expenses. Keep in mind that the SEC rules apply
only to public businesses.)
In the example shown in Figure 4-1, expenses such as labor costs and adver-
tising expenditures are buried in the all-inclusive selling, general, and adminis-
trative expenses line. (If the business manufactures the products it sells
instead of buying them from another business, a good part of its annual labor
82
Part II: Figuring Out Financial Statements 
How big is a big business and how 
small is a small business?
One key measure of the size of a business is the
number of employees it has on its payroll. Could
the business shown in Figure 4-1 have 500
employees? Probably not. This would mean that
the annual sales revenue per employee would
be only $52,000 ($26 million annual sales rev-
enue divided by 500 employees). The average
annual wage per employee would have to be
less than half the sales revenue per employee
in order to leave enough sales revenue after
labor cost to cover the cost of goods sold and
other expenses. The average annual wage of
employees in many industries today is over
$35,000, and much higher in some industries.
Much more likely, the number of full-time
employees in this business is closer to 100. This
number of employees yields $260,000 sales rev-
enue per employee, which means that the busi-
ness could probably afford an average annual
wage of $40,000 per employee, or higher.
Public companies generally report their num-
bers of employees in their annual financial
reports, but private businesses generally do not.
U.S. GAAP do not require that the total number
and total wages and salaries of employees be
reported in the external financial statements of
a business, or in the footnotes to the financial
statements.
The definition of a “small business” is not uni-
form. Generally the term refers to a business
with less than 100 full-time employees, but in
some situations, it refers to businesses with less
than 20 employees. Even 20 employees earning,
say, only $25,000 annual wages per person (a
very low amount) require a $500,000 annual pay-
roll before employee benefits (such as Social
Security taxes) are figured in. Most businesses
have to have sales at least equal to two or three
times their basic payroll expense. Therefore, a
20-employee business paying minimum wages
would need more than $1 million annual sales
revenue.

cost is included in its cost of goods sold expense line.) Some companies dis-
close specific expenses such as advertising and marketing costs, research
and development costs, and other significant expenses. In short, income
statement expense disclosure practices vary considerably from business to
business.
Another set of questions you should ask in reading an income statement con-
cern the profit performance of the business. Refer again to the company’s
profit performance report (refer to Figure 4-1). Profit-wise, how did the busi-
ness do? Underneath this question is the implicit question: relative to what?
Generally speaking, three sorts of benchmarks are used for evaluating profit
performance:
 Comparisons with broad, industry-wide performance averages
 Comparisons with immediate competitors’ performances
 Comparisons with the business’s performance in recent years
Chapter 13 explains the analysis of profit performance and key ratios that are
computed for this purpose.
83
Chapter 4: Reporting Revenue, Expenses, and the Bottom Line
The P word
I’m sure you won’t be surprised to hear that the
financial objective of every business is to make
an adequate profit on a sustainable basis. In the
pursuit of profit, a business should behave eth-
ically, stay within the law, care for its employ-
ees, and be friendly to the environment. I don’t
mean to preach here. But the blunt truth of the
matter is that profit is a dirty word to many
people, and the profit motive is a favorite target
of many critics who blame it for unsafe working
conditions, exploitation of child labor, wages
that are below the poverty line, and other ills of
the economic system. The profit motive is an
easy target for criticism.
You hear a lot about the profit motive of business,
but you hardly ever see the P word in external
financial reports. In the financial press, the most
common term you see instead is earnings. Both
The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times
cover the profit performance of public corpora-
tions and use the term earnings reports. If you
look in financial statements, the term net income
is used most often for the bottom-line profit that
a business earns. Accountants prefer net
income, although they also use other names, like
net earnings and net operating earnings.
In short, profit is more of a street name; in polite
company, you generally say net income.
However, I must point out one exception. I have
followed the financial reports of Caterpillar, Inc.,
for many years. Caterpillar uses the term profit
for the bottom line of its income statement; it’s
one of the few companies that call a spade a
spade.

Finding Profit
As I say in the previous section, when reading an income statement your job
is asking pertinent questions. Here’s an important question: What happened
to the business’s financial condition as the result of earning $1.69 million net
income for the year (refer to Figure 4-1)? The financial condition of a business
consists of its assets on the one side and its liabilities and owners’ equity on
the other side. (The financial condition of a business at a point in time is
reported in its balance sheet, which I discuss in detail in Chapter 5.)
To phrase the question a little differently: How did the company’s assets, 
liabilities, and owners’ equity change during the year as the result of its 
revenue and expense transactions that yielded $1.69 million profit? You 
can’t record revenue without increasing a particular asset (or decreasing a
particular liability in some cases). And you can’t record an expense without
decreasing a particular asset or increasing a particular liability. Revenue and
expenses are not ephemeral things, like smoke blowing in the wind. These
two components of profit cause real changes in assets and liabilities.
When you see the sales revenue in Figure 4-1, you should be thinking that there
was $26 million inflow of assets during the year. (In the example, no liabilities
are involved in recording sales.) The company’s total expenses for the year
were $24.31 million ($26 million sales revenue minus $1.69 million net income).
Expenses decrease assets or increase liabilities. Therefore, you should be
thinking that there was an outflow of assets during the year and probably a
run-up of liabilities for a combined total of $24.31 million. In short, sales and
expenses cause considerable changes in assets and liabilities. Usually these
changes are rumbles, but they can cause a seismic event on occasion.
The question can be answered in terms of the accounting equation: a very
condensed version of the balance sheet. A useful version of the accounting
equation is the following, in which owners’ equity is divided between
invested capital and retained earnings:
The owners’ equity of a business increases for two quite different reasons:
The owners invest money in the business, and the business makes a profit.
Naturally, a business keeps two types of accounts for owners’ equity: one for
invested capital and one for retained profit, or retained earnings (as it is gen-
erally called). The term retained is used because in most situations some or
all of annual profit is not distributed to owners but is retained in the busi-
ness. Unfortunately, the retained earnings account sounds like an asset in the
minds of many people. It is not! It is a source-of-assets account, not an asset
account. It’s on the right-hand side of the accounting equation; assets are on
the left side. See the “So why is it called retained earnings?” sidebar for more
information.

Part II: Figuring Out Financial Statements 

The business in the Figure 4-1 example earned $1.69 million profit for the
year. Therefore, its retained earnings account increased this amount, because
the bottom-line amount of net income for the period is recorded in this
account. We know this for sure. But what we can’t tell from the income state-
ment is how the assets and liabilities of the business were affected by its sale
and expense activities during the period. One possible scenario is the follow-
ing (in thousands of dollars):
This scenario works because the sum of the right-hand-side changes
($300,000 increase in liabilities plus $1.69 million increase in retained earn-
ings) equals the $1.99 million increase in assets.
The “financial shift” in assets and liabilities from profit-making activities is
especially important for business managers to understand and pay attention
to, because they have to manage and control the changes. It would be dan-
gerous simply to assume that making a profit has only beneficial effects on
assets and liabilities. One of the main purposes of the statement of cash
flows, which I discuss in Chapter 6, is to summarize the financial changes
caused by the profit activities of the business during the year.

Chapter 4: Reporting Revenue, Expenses, and the Bottom Line
So why is it called retained earnings?
The ending balance reported in the retained
earnings account is the amount after recording
increases and decreases in the account during
the period, starting with the opening balance at
the start of the period, of course. The retained
earnings account increases when the business
makes a profit and decreases when the business
distributes some of the profit to its owners. That
is, the total amount of profit paid out to the
owners is recorded as a decrease in the retained
earnings account. (Exactly how the profit is
divided among the owners depends on the own-
ership structure of the business; see Chapter 8.)
Bonus question: Why doesn’t a business pay
out all its annual profit to owners? One reason is
that the business may not have converted all its
profit into cash by the end of the year and may
not have enough cash to distribute all the profit
to the owners. Or the business may have had
the cash but needed it for other purposes, such
as growing the company by buying new build-
ings and equipment or spending the money on
research and development of new products.
Reinvesting the profit in the business in this way
is often referred to as plowing back earnings. A
business should always make good use of its
cash flow instead of letting the cash pile up in
the cash account. See Chapter 6 for more on
cash flow from profit.

To summarize, the company’s $1.69 million net income resulted in some com-
bination of changes in its assets and liabilities, such that its owners’ equity
(specifically, its retained earnings) increased $1.69 million. One such scenario
is given just above. In fact, this is what happened in the business example,
which I summarize later in the chapter (see the section “Summing Up the
Financial Effects of Profit”).
Getting Particular about 
Assets and Liabilities
The sales and expense activities of a business involve inflows and outflows 
of cash, as I’m sure you know. What you may not know, however, is that the
profit-making process also involves four other basic operating assets and
three basic types of operating liabilities. Each of the following sections
explains one of these operating assets and liabilities. This gives you a more
realistic picture of what’s involved in making profit.
Making sales on credit →
Accounts receivable asset
Many businesses allow their customers to buy their products or services on
credit. They use an asset account called accounts receivable to record the
total amount owed to the business by its customers who have made pur-
chases “on the cuff” and haven’t paid yet. In most cases, a business doesn’t
collect all its receivables by the end of the year, especially for credit sales
that occur in the last weeks of the year. It records the sales revenue and the
cost of goods sold expense for these sales as soon as a sale is completed and
products are delivered to the customers. This is one feature of the accrual
basis of accounting, which records revenue when sales are made and records
expenses when these costs are incurred. When sales are made on credit, the
accounts receivable asset account is increased; later, when cash is received
from the customer, cash is increased and the accounts receivable account is
decreased. Collecting the cash is the follow-up transaction trailing along after
the sale is recorded.
The balance of accounts receivable at the end of the year is the amount of
sales revenue that has not yet been converted into cash. Accounts receivable
represents cash waiting in the wings to be collected in the near future (assum-
ing that all customers pay their accounts owed to the business on time). Until
the money is actually received, the business is without the cash inflow.
86
Part II: Figuring Out Financial Statements 

Selling products →Inventory asset
The cost of goods sold is one of the primary expenses of businesses that sell
products. (In Figure 4-1, notice that this expense is equal to more than half
the sales revenue for the year.) This expense is just what its name implies:
the cost that a business pays for the products it sells to customers. A busi-
ness makes profit by setting its sales prices high enough to cover the actual
costs of products sold, the costs of operating the business, interest on bor-
rowed money, and income taxes (assuming that the business pays income
tax), with something left over for profit.
When the business acquires a product, the cost of the product goes into an
inventory asset account (and, of course, the cost is either deducted from the
cash account or added to the accounts payable liability account, depending
on whether the business pays with cash or buys on credit). When a customer
buys that product, the business transfers the cost of the product from the
inventory asset account to the cost of goods sold expense account because
the product is no longer in the business’s inventory; the product has been
delivered to the customer.
The first step in the income statement is deducting the cost of goods sold
expense from the sales revenue for the goods sold. Almost all businesses 
that sell products report the cost of goods sold as a separate expense in 
their income statements, as you see in Figure 4-1.
A business that sells products needs to have a stock of those products on
hand to sell to its customers. This stockpile of goods on the shelves (or in
storage space in the backroom) waiting to be sold is called inventory. When
you drive by an auto dealer and see all the cars, SUVs, and pickup trucks
waiting to be sold, remember that these products are inventory. The cost of
unsold products (goods held in inventory) is not yet an expense; only after
the products are actually sold does the cost get listed as an expense. In this
way, the cost of goods sold expense is correctly matched against the sales
revenue from the goods sold. Correctly matching expenses against sales rev-
enue is the essence of accounting for profit.
Prepaying operating costs →
Prepaid expense asset
Prepaid expenses are the opposite of unpaid expenses. For example, a busi-
ness buys fire insurance and general liability insurance (in case a customer
who slips on a wet floor or is insulted by a careless salesperson sues the
business). Insurance premiums must be paid ahead of time, before coverage
87
Chapter 4: Reporting Revenue, Expenses, and the Bottom Line

starts. The premium cost is allocated to expense in the actual period bene-
fited. At the end of the year, the business may be only halfway through the
insurance coverage period, so it charges off only half the premium cost as 
an expense. (For a six-month policy, you charge one-sixth of the premium
cost to each of the six months covered.) So at the time the premium is paid,
the entire amount is recorded in the prepaid expenses asset account, and for
each month of coverage, the appropriate fraction of the cost is transferred to
the insurance expense account.
Another example of something initially put in the prepaid expenses asset
account is when a business pays cash to stock up on office supplies that it
may not use for several months. The cost is recorded in the prepaid expenses
asset account at the time of purchase; when the supplies are used, the appro-
priate amount is subtracted from the prepaid expenses asset account and
recorded in the office supplies expense account.
Using the prepaid expenses asset account is not so much for the purpose of
reporting all the assets of a business, because the balance in the account
compared with other assets and total assets is typically small. Rather, using
this account is an example of allocating costs to expenses in the period bene-
fited by the costs, which isn’t always the same period in which the business
pays those costs. The prepayment of these expenses lays the groundwork for
continuing operations seamlessly into the next year.
Fixed assets →Depreciation expense
Long-term operating assets that are not held for sale in the ordinary course
of business are called fixed assets; these include buildings, machinery, office
equipment, vehicles, computers and data-processing equipment, shelving
and cabinets, and so on. Depreciation refers to spreading out the cost of a
fixed asset over the years of its useful life to a business, instead of charging
the entire cost to expense in the year of purchase. That way, each year of use
bears a share of the total cost. For example, autos and light trucks are typi-
cally depreciated over five years; the idea is to charge a fraction of the total
cost to depreciation expense during each of the five years. (The actual frac-
tion each year depends on which method of depreciation used, which I
explain in Chapter 7.)
Of course, depreciation applies only to fixed assets that you buy, not those
you rent or lease. (If you lease or rent fixed assets, which is quite common,
the rent you pay each month is charged to rent expense.) Depreciation is a
real expense but not a cash outlay expense in the year it is recorded. The
cash outlay occurs when the fixed asset is acquired. See “The positive impact
of depreciation on cash flow” sidebar for more information.
88
Part II: Figuring Out Financial Statements 

Take another look back at the business example in Figure 4-1. From the infor-
mation supplied in its income statement, we don’t know how much deprecia-
tion expense the business recorded in 2009. However, the footnotes to its
financial statements reveal this amount. In 2009, the business recorded
$775,000 depreciation expense. Basically, this expense decreases the book
value (the recorded value) of its fixed assets. Chapter 5 goes into more detail
regarding how depreciation expense is recorded.
Unpaid expenses →Accounts payable,
accrued expenses payable, 
and income tax payable
A typical business pays many expenses after the period in which the
expenses are recorded. Following are some common examples:
89
Chapter 4: Reporting Revenue, Expenses, and the Bottom Line
The positive impact of depreciation on cash flow
Depreciation is good news for cash flow. This
concept gets a little complex, so stay with me
here. To start with, fixed assets wear out and
lose their economic usefulness over time. Some
fixed assets last many years, such as office fur-
niture and buildings. Other fixed assets last just
a few years, such as delivery trucks and com-
puters. Accountants argue, quite logically, that
the cost of a fixed asset should be spread out or
allocated over its predicted useful life to the
business. Depreciation methods are rather arbi-
trary, but any reasonable method is much better
than the alternative of charging off the entire
cost of a fixed asset in the year it is acquired.
A business has to pass the cost of its fixed
assets through to its customers and recover the
cost of its fixed assets through sales revenue. A
good example to illustrate this critical point is a
taxicab driver who owns his cab. He sets his
fares high enough to pay for his time; to pay for
the insurance, license, gas, and oil; and to
recover the cost of the cab. Included in each
fare is a tiny fraction of the cost of the cab,
which over the course of the year adds up to the
depreciation expense that he passed on to his
passengers and collected in fares. At the end of
the year, he has collected a certain amount of
money that pays him back for part of the cost of
the cab.
In summary, fixed assets are gradually liqui-
dated, or turned back into cash, each year. Part
of sales revenue recovers some of the cost of
fixed assets, which is why the decrease in the
fixed assets account to record depreciation
expense has the effect of increasing cash
(assuming your sales revenue is collected in
cash during the year). What the company does
with this cash recovery is another matter.
Sooner or later, you need to replace fixed assets
to continue in business.

 A business hires a law firm that does a lot of legal work during the year,
but the company doesn’t pay the bill until the following year.
 A business matches retirement contributions made by its employees but
doesn’t pay its share until the following year.
 A business has unpaid bills for telephone service, gas, electricity, and
water that it used during the year.
Accountants use three different types of liability accounts to record a busi-
ness’s unpaid expenses:
 Accounts payable: This account is used for items that the business buys
on credit and for which it receives an invoice (a bill). For example, your
business receives an invoice from its lawyers for legal work done. As
soon as you receive the invoice, you record in the accounts payable lia-
bility account the amount that you owe. Later, when you pay the invoice,
you subtract that amount from the accounts payable account, and your
cash goes down by the same amount.
 Accrued expenses payable: A business has to make estimates for sev-
eral unpaid costs at the end of the year because it hasn’t yet received
invoices for them. Examples of accrued expenses include the following:
• Unused vacation and sick days that employees carry over to the fol-
lowing year, which the business has to pay for in the coming year
• Unpaid bonuses to salespeople
• The cost of future repairs and part replacements on products that
customers have bought and haven’t yet returned for repair
• The daily accumulation of interest on borrowed money that won’t
be paid until the end of the loan period
Without invoices to refer to, you have to examine your business opera-
tions carefully to determine which liabilities of this sort to record.
 Income tax payable: This account is used for income taxes that a busi-
ness still owes to the IRS at the end of the year. The income tax expense
for the year is the total amount based on the taxable income for the
entire year. Your business may not pay 100 percent of its income tax
expense during the year; it may owe a small fraction to the IRS at year’s
end. You record the unpaid amount in the income tax payable account.
Note: A business may be organized legally as a pass-through tax entity for
income tax purposes, which means that it doesn’t pay income tax itself
but instead passes its taxable income on to its owners. Chapter 8
explains these types of business entities. The example I offer here is for
a business that is an ordinary corporation that pays income tax.

Part II: Figuring Out Financial Statements 

Summing Up the Financial 
Effects of Profit
Business managers should understand not only how to make profit, but also
the financial effects of making profit. Profit does not simply mean an increase
in cash. Sales revenue and expenses affect several assets other than cash and
operating liabilities. I realize that I make this point several times in this chap-
ter, so forgive me if I seem to be harping. I simply want to drive home the
importance of understanding this fact.
Making profit involves additional transactions that are closely allied with sales
and expenses. These tightly connected transactions include the following:
 Collecting cash from customers for credit sales made to them, which
takes place after recording the sales revenue
 Purchasing (or manufacturing) products that are put in inventory and
held there until the products are sold sometime later, at which time the
cost of products sold is charged to expense in order to match up with
the revenue from the sale
 Paying certain costs in advance of when they are charged to expense
 Paying for products bought on credit and for other items that are not
charged to expense until sometime after the purchase
 Paying for expenses that have been recorded sometime earlier
 Making payments to the government for income tax expense that has
already been recorded
These allied transactions are the “before and after” of recording sales and
expense transactions. The allied transactions are not reported as such in a
financial statement. However, the allied transactions change assets and liabil-
ities, and they definitely affect cash flow. I explain how the changes in assets
and liabilities caused by the allied transactions affect cash flow in Chapter 6.
Figure 4-2 is a summary of the changes in assets and liabilities during the
year that are caused by a company’s profit-making activities — including the
sales and expense transactions (summarized in the income statement) and
the allied transactions (which are not reported in a financial statement). This
sort of summary is not usually prepared for business managers, nor is such a
summary presented in external financial reports. But it is a useful way to sum
up the financial consequences of making profit.
91
Chapter 4: Reporting Revenue, Expenses, and the Bottom Line

Note in Figure 4-2 that I use descriptive names for the assets and liabilities,
instead of the formal account titles that you see in actual financial state-
ments. You can refer to the formal account titles earlier in the chapter (see
the section “Getting Particular about Assets and Liabilities”). When explain-
ing the balance sheet in Chapter 5, I stick to the formal titles of the accounts.
Other transactions also change the assets, liabilities, and owners’ equity of a
business, such as borrowing money and buying new fixed assets. These non-
revenue and non-expense transactions are reported in the statement of cash
flows, which I explain in Chapter 6.
Reporting Extraordinary 
Gains and Losses
I have a small confession to make: The income statement example shown in
Figure 4-1 is a sanitized version as compared with actual income statements
in external financial reports. If you took the trouble to read 100 income state-
ments, you’d be surprised at the wide range of things you’d find in these
statements. But I do know one thing for certain you would discover.

Part II: Figuring Out Financial Statements 

Many businesses report unusual, extraordinary gains and losses in addition to
their usual revenue, income, and expenses. In these situations, the income
statement is divided into two sections:
 The first section presents the ordinary, continuing sales, income, and
expense operations of the business for the year.
 The second section presents any unusual, extraordinary, and nonrecur-
ring gains and losses that the business recorded in the year.
The road to profit is anything but smooth and straight. Every business expe-
riences an occasional discontinuity — a serious disruption that comes out of
the blue, doesn’t happen regularly or often, and can dramatically affect its
bottom-line profit. In other words, a discontinuity is something that disturbs
the basic continuity of its operations or the regular flow of profit-making
activities.
Here are some examples of discontinuities:
 Downsizing and restructuring the business: Layoffs require severance
pay or trigger early retirement costs; major segments of the business
may be disposed of, causing large losses.
 Abandoning product lines: When you decide to discontinue selling a
line of products, you lose at least some of the money that you paid for
obtaining or manufacturing the products, either because you sell the
products for less than you paid or because you just dump the products
you can’t sell.
 Settling lawsuits and other legal actions: Damages and fines that you
pay — as well as awards that you receive in a favorable ruling — are
obviously nonrecurring extraordinary losses or gains (unless you’re in
the habit of being taken to court every year).
 Writing down (also called writing off) damaged and impaired assets: 
If products become damaged and unsellable, or fixed assets need to be
replaced unexpectedly, you need to remove these items from the assets
accounts. Even when certain assets are in good physical condition, if
they lose their ability to generate future sales or other benefits to the
business, accounting rules say that the assets have to be taken off the
books or at least written down to lower book values.
 Changing accounting methods: A business may decide to use a different
method for recording revenue and expenses than it did in the past, in
some cases because the accounting rules (set by the authoritative
accounting governing bodies — see Chapter 2) have changed. Often, 
the new method requires a business to record a one-time cumulative
effect caused by the switch in accounting method. These special items
can be huge.
93
Chapter 4: Reporting Revenue, Expenses, and the Bottom Line

 Correcting errors from previous financial reports: If you or your
accountant discovers that a past financial report had an accounting
error, you make a catch-up correction entry, which means that you
record a loss or gain that had nothing to do with your performance 
this year.
According to financial reporting standards (GAAP), which I explain in 
Chapter 2, a business must make these one-time losses and gains very visible
in its income statement. So in addition to the main part of the income state-
ment that reports normal profit activities, a business with unusual, extraordi-
nary losses or gains must add a second layer to the income statement to
disclose these out-of-the-ordinary happenings.
If a business has no unusual gains or losses in the year, its income statement
ends with one bottom line, usually called net income (which is the situation
shown in Figure 4-1). When an income statement includes a second layer, that
line becomes net income from continuing operations before unusual gains and
losses. Below this line, each significant, nonrecurring gain or loss appears.
Say that a business suffered a relatively minor loss from quitting a product
line and a very large loss from adopting a new accounting standard. The
second layer of the business’s income statement would look something like
the following:
Net income from continuing operations
$267,000,000
Discontinued operations, net of income taxes
($20,000,000)
Earnings before cumulative effect of changes 
$247,000,000
in accounting principles
Cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles, 
($456,000,000)
net of income taxes
Net earnings (loss)
($209,000,000)
The gains and losses reported in the second layer of an external income
statement are generally complex and may be quite difficult to follow. So
where does that leave you? In assessing the implications of extraordinary
gains and losses, use the following questions as guidelines:
 Were the annual profits reported in prior years overstated?
 Why wasn’t the loss or gain recorded on a more piecemeal and gradual
year-by-year basis instead of as a one-time charge?
 Was the loss or gain really a surprising and sudden event that could not
have been anticipated?
 Will such a loss or gain occur again in the future?
94
Part II: Figuring Out Financial Statements 

Every company that stays in business for more than a couple of years experi-
ences a discontinuity of one sort or another. But beware of a business that
takes advantage of discontinuities in the following ways:
 Discontinuities become continuities: This business makes an extraordi-
nary loss or gain a regular feature on its income statement. Every year
or so, the business loses a major lawsuit, abandons product lines, or
restructures itself. It reports “nonrecurring” gains or losses from the
same source on a recurring basis.
 A discontinuity is used as an opportunity to record all sorts of write-
downs and losses: When recording an unusual loss (such as settling a
lawsuit), the business opts to record other losses at the same time, and
everything but the kitchen sink (and sometimes that, too) gets written
off. This so-called big-bath strategy says that you may as well take a big
bath now in order to avoid taking little showers in the future.
A business may just have bad (or good) luck regarding extraordinary events
that its managers could not have predicted. If a business is facing a major,
unavoidable expense this year, cleaning out all its expenses in the same year
so it can start off fresh next year can be a clever, legitimate accounting tactic.
But where do you draw the line between these accounting manipulations and
fraud? All I can advise you to do is stay alert to these potential problems.
Closing Comments
The income statement occupies center stage; the bright spotlight is on this
financial statement because it reports profit or loss for the period. But remem-
ber that a business reports three primary financial statements — the other
two being the balance sheet and the statement of cash flows, which I discuss
in the next two chapters. The three statements are like a three-ring circus. The
income statement may draw the most attention, but you have to watch what’s
going on in all three places. As important as profit is to the financial success of
a business, the income statement is not an island unto itself.
Also, keep in mind that financial statements are supplemented with footnotes
and contain other commentary from the business’s executives. If the financial
statements have been audited, the CPA firm includes a short report stating
whether the financial statements have been prepared in conformity with
GAAP. Chapter 15 explains audits and the auditor’s report.
I don’t like closing this chapter on a sour note, but I must point out that an
income statement you read and rely on — as a business manager, investor, 
or lender — may not be true and accurate. In most cases (I’ll even say in the
large majority of cases), businesses prepare their financial statements in
95
Chapter 4: Reporting Revenue, Expenses, and the Bottom Line

good faith, and their profit accounting is honest. They may bend the rules a
little, but basically their accounting methods are within the boundaries of
GAAP even though the business puts a favorable spin on its profit number.
But some businesses resort to accounting fraud and deliberately distort their
profit numbers. In this case, an income statement reports false and mislead-
ing sales revenue and/or expenses in order to make the bottom-line profit
appear to be better than the facts would support. If the fraud is discovered at
a later time, the business puts out revised financial statements. Basically, the
business in this situation rewrites its profit history. I wish I could say that
this doesn’t happen very often, but the number of high-profile accounting
fraud cases in recent years has been truly alarming. The CPA auditors of
these companies did not catch the accounting fraud, even though this is one
purpose of an audit. Investors who relied on the fraudulent income state-
ments ended up suffering large losses.
Anytime I read a financial report, I keep in mind the risk that the financial
statements may be “stage managed” to some extent — to make year-to-year
reported profit look a little smoother and less erratic, and to make the finan-
cial condition of the business appear a little better. Regretfully, financial state-
ments don’t always tell it as it is. Rather, the chief executive and chief
accountant of the business fiddle with the financial statements to some
extent. I say much more about this tweaking of a business’s financial state-
ments in later chapters.

Chapter 5
Reporting Assets, Liabilities, 
and Owners’ Equity
In This Chapter
 Identifying three basic types of business transactions
 Classifying assets and liabilities
 Connecting revenue and expenses with their assets and liabilities
 Examining where businesses go for capital
 Understanding balance sheet values
T
his chapter explores one of the three primary financial statements
reported by businesses — the balance sheet, which is also called the
statement of financial condition and the statement of financial position. This
financial statement is a summary at a point in time of the assets of a business
on the one hand, and the liabilities and owners’ equity sources of the busi-
ness on the other hand. It’s a two-sided financial statement, which can be
condensed in the accounting equation:
Assets = Liabilites + Owners’ equity
The balance sheet may seem to stand alone — like an island to itself —
because it’s presented on a separate page in a financial report. But keep 
in mind that the assets and liabilities reported in a balance sheet are the
results of the activities, or transactions, of the business. Transactions are 
economic exchanges between the business and the parties it deals with: 
customers, employees, vendors, government agencies, and sources of capi-
tal. Transactions are the stepping stones from the start-of-the year to the end-
of-the-year financial condition.

Understanding That Transactions 
Drive the Balance Sheet
A balance sheet is a snapshot of the financial condition of a business at an
instant in time — the most important moment in time being at the end of the
last day of the income statement period. If you read Chapter 4, you’ll notice
that I continue using the same business example in this chapter. The fiscal, or
accounting, year of the business ends on December 31. So its balance sheet 
is prepared at the close of business at midnight December 31. (A company
should end its fiscal year at the close of its natural business year or at the
close of a calendar quarter — September 30, for example.) This freeze-frame
nature of a balance sheet may make it appear that a balance sheet is static.
Nothing is further from the truth. A business does not shut down to prepare
its balance sheet. The financial condition of a business is in constant motion
because the activities of the business go on nonstop.
The activities, or transactions, of a business fall into three basic types:
 Operating activities: This category refers to making sales and incurring
expenses, and also includes the allied transactions that are part and
parcel of making sales and incurring expenses. For example, a business
records sales revenue when sales are made on credit, and then, later,
records cash collections from customers. Another example: A business
purchases products that are placed in its inventory (its stock of prod-
ucts awaiting sale), at which time it records an entry for the purchase.
The expense (the cost of goods sold) is not recorded until the products
are actually sold to customers. Keep in mind that the term operating
activities includes the allied transactions that precede or are subsequent
to the recording of sales and expense transactions.
 Investing activities: This term refers to making investments in assets
and (eventually) disposing of the assets when the business no longer
needs them. The primary examples of investing activities for businesses
that sell products and services are capital expenditures, which are the
amounts spent to modernize, expand, and replace the long-term operat-
ing assets of a business.
 Financing activities: These activities include securing money from debt
and equity sources of capital, returning capital to these sources, and
making distributions from profit to owners. Note that distributing profit to
owners is treated as a financing transaction, not as a separate category.
Wondering where to find these transactions in a financial report? See the
sidebar “How transactions are reported in financial statements.”

Figure 5-1 shows a summary of changes in assets, liabilities, and owners’
equity during the year for the business example I introduce in Chapter 4.
Notice the middle three columns in Figure 5-1, for each of the three basic
types of activities of a business. One column is for changes caused by its 
revenue and expenses and their allied transactions during the year, which
collectively are called operating activities. The second column is for changes
caused by its investing activities during the year. The third column is for the
changes caused by its financing activities.

Chapter 5: Reporting Assets, Liabilities, and Owners’ Equity
How transactions are reported 
in financial statements
Sales revenue and expenses, as well as any
gains or losses that are recorded in the period,
are reported in the income statement. However,
the total flows during the period of the allied
transactions connected with sales and expenses
are not reported. For example, the total of cash
collections from customers from credit sales
made to them is not reported. The net changes
in the assets and liabilities directly involved in
operating activities are reported in the statement
of cash flows (see Chapter 6). Financing and
investing transactions are also found in the
statement of cash flows. (Reporting the cash
flows from investing and financing activities is
one of the main purposes of the statement of
cash flows.)

Note: Figure 5-1 is not — I repeat not — a balance sheet. The balance sheet
for this business is presented later in the chapter (see Figure 5-2). Businesses
do not report a summary of changes in assets, liabilities, and owners’ equity
such as the one that I show in Figure 5-1 (although personally I think that
such a summary would be helpful to users of financial reports). The purpose
of Figure 5-1 is to leave a trail of how the three major types of transactions
during the year change the assets, liabilities, and owner’s equity accounts of
the business during the year.
The 2009 income statement of the business in the example is shown in 
Figure 4-1 in Chapter 4. You may want to flip back to this financial statement. 
On sales revenue of $26 million, the business earned $1.69 million bottom-line
profit (net income) for the year. The sales and expense transactions of the 
business during the year plus the allied transactions connected with sales 
and expenses cause the changes shown in the operating activities column 
in Figure 5-1. You can see in Figure 5-1 that the $1.69 million net income has
increased the business’s owners’ equity–retained earnings by the same amount.
The operating activities column in Figure 5-1 is worth lingering over for a few
moments because the financial outcomes of making profit are seen in this
column. In my experience, most people see a profit number, such as the $1.69
million in this example, and stop thinking any further about the financial out-
comes of making the profit. This is like going to a movie because you like its
title, but you don’t know anything about the plot and characters. You proba-
bly noticed that the $1,515,000 increase in cash in this column differs from
the $1,690,000 net income figure for the year. That’s because the cash effect
of making profit (which includes the allied transactions connected with sales
and expenses) is almost always different than the net income amount for the
year. Chapter 6 on cash flows explains this difference.
The summary of changes presented in Figure 5-1 gives a sense of the balance
sheet in motion, or how the business got from the start of the year to the 
end of the year. It’s very important to have a good sense of how transactions
propel the balance sheet. A summary of balance sheet changes, such as
shown in Figure 5-1, can be helpful to business managers who plan and con-
trol changes in the assets and liabilities of the business. They need a clear
understanding of how the two basic types of transactions change assets and
liabilities. Also, Figure 5-1 provides a useful platform for the statement of
cash flows, which I explain in Chapter 6.
Presenting a Balance Sheet
Figure 5-2 presents a two-year, comparative balance sheet for the business
example that I introduce in Chapter 4. The balance sheet is at the close of
business, December 31, 2008 and 2009. In most cases financial statements are
not completed and released until a few weeks after the balance sheet date.
100
Part II: Figuring Out Financial Statements 

Therefore, by the time you would read this financial statement it’s already
out of date, because the business has continued to engage in transactions
since December 31, 2009. (Managers of a business get internal financial state-
ments much sooner.) When substantial changes have occurred in the interim,
a business should disclose these developments in its financial report.
When a business does not release its annual financial report within a few
weeks after the close of its fiscal year, you should be alarmed. There are rea-
sons for such a delay, and the reasons are all bad. One reason might be that
the business’s accounting system is not functioning well and the controller
(chief accounting officer) has to do a lot of work at year-end to get the
accounts up to date and accurate for preparing the financial statements.
Another reason is that the business is facing serious problems and can’t
decide on how to account for the problems. Perhaps a business may be
delaying the reporting of bad news. Or the business may have a serious dis-
pute with its independent CPA auditor that has not been resolved (see
Chapter 15 where I explain audits).

Chapter 5: Reporting Assets, Liabilities, and Owners’ Equity

In reading through a balance sheet such as the one shown in Figure 5-2, you
may notice that it doesn’t have a punch line like the income statement does.
The income statement’s punch line is the net income line, which is rarely
humorous to the business itself but can cause some snickers among analysts.
You can’t look at just one item on the balance sheet, murmur an appreciative
“ah-ha,” and rush home to watch the game. You have to read the whole thing
(sigh) and make comparisons among the items. Chapters 13 and 17 offer
more information on interpreting financial statements.
Notice in Figure 5-2 that the beginning and ending balances in the assets, 
liabilities, and owner’s equity accounts are the same as in Figure 5-1. The 
balance sheet in Figure 5-2 discloses the original cost of the company’s fixed
assets and the accumulated depreciation recorded over the years since
acquisition of the assets, which is standard practice. (Figure 5-1 presents
only the net book value of its fixed assets, which equals original cost minus
accumulated depreciation.)
The balance sheet is unlike the income and cash flow statements, which
report flows over a period of time (such as sales revenue that is the cumula-
tive amount of all sales during the period). The balance sheet presents the
balances (amounts) of a company’s assets, liabilities, and owners’ equity at
an instant in time. Notice the two quite different meanings of the term bal-
ance. As used in balance sheet, the term refers to the equality of the two
opposing sides of a business — total assets on the one side and total liabili-
ties and owners’ equity on the other side, like a scale with equal weights on
both sides. In contrast, the balance of an account (asset, liability, owners’
equity, revenue, and expense) refers to the amount in the account after
recording increases and decreases in the account — the net amount after all
additions and subtractions have been entered. Usually, the meaning of the
term is clear in context.
An accountant can prepare a balance sheet at any time that a manager wants
to know how things stand financially. Some businesses — particularly finan-
cial institutions such as banks, mutual funds, and securities brokers — need
balance sheets at the end of each day, in order to track their day-to-day finan-
cial situation. For most businesses, however, balance sheets are prepared
only at the end of each month, quarter, and year. A balance sheet is always
prepared at the close of business on the last day of the profit period. In other
words, the balance sheet should be in sync with the income statement.
Kicking balance sheets 
out into the real world
The statement of financial condition, or balance sheet, shown earlier in
Figure 5-2 is about as lean and mean as you’ll ever read. In the real world
many businesses are fat and complex. Also, I should make clear that 
Figure 5-2 shows the content and format for an external balance sheet, which
102
Part II: Figuring Out Financial Statements 

means a balance sheet that is included in a financial report released outside a
business to its owners and creditors. Balance sheets that stay within a busi-
ness can be quite different.
Internal balance sheets
For internal reporting of financial condition to managers, balance sheets
include much more detail, either in the body of the financial statement itself
or, more likely, in supporting schedules. For example, just one cash account
is shown in Figure 5-2, but the chief financial officer of a business needs to
know the balances on deposit in each of the business’s checking accounts.
As another example, the balance sheet shown in Figure 5-2 includes just one
total amount for accounts receivable, but managers need details on which
customers owe money and whether any major amounts are past due. Greater
detail allows for better control, analysis, and decision-making. Internal bal-
ance sheets and their supporting schedules should provide all the detail that
managers need to make good business decisions. See Chapter 14 for more
detail on how business managers use financial reports.
External balance sheets
Balance sheets presented in external financial reports (which go out to
investors and lenders) do not include much more detail than the balance
sheet shown in Figure 5-2. However, external balance sheets must classify
(or group together) short-term assets and liabilities. For this reason, external
balance sheets are referred to as classified balance sheets.
Let me make clear that the CIA does not vet balance sheets to keep secrets
from being disclosed that would harm national security. The term classified,
when applied to a balance sheet, does not mean restricted or top secret;
rather, the term means that assets and liabilities are sorted into basic
classes, or groups, for external reporting. Classifying certain assets and liabil-
ities into current categories is done mainly to help readers of a balance sheet
more easily compare current assets with current liabilities for the purpose of
judging the short-term solvency of a business.
Judging solvency
Solvency refers to the ability of a business to pay its liabilities on time. Delays
in paying liabilities on time can cause very serious problems for a business.
In extreme cases, a business can be thrown into involuntary bankruptcy. Even
the threat of bankruptcy can cause serious disruptions in the normal opera-
tions of a business, and profit performance is bound to suffer. If current liabil-
ities become too high relative to current assets — which constitute the first
line of defense for paying current liabilities — managers should move quickly
to resolve the problem. A perceived shortage of current assets relative to cur-
rent liabilities could ring alarm bells in the minds of the company’s creditors
and owners.
103
Chapter 5: Reporting Assets, Liabilities, and Owners’ Equity

Therefore, notice in Figure 5-2 the following groupings (dollar amounts refer
to year-end 2009):
 The first four asset accounts (cash, accounts receivable, inventory, and
prepaid expenses) are added to give the $8,815,000 subtotal for current
assets.
 The first four liability accounts (accounts payable, accrued expenses
payable, income tax payable, and short-term notes payable) are added
to give the $4.03 million subtotal for current liabilities.
 The total interest-bearing debt of the business is separated between
$2.25 million in short-term notes payable and $4 million in long-term notes
payable. (In Figure 5-1, only one total amount for all interest-bearing
debt is given, which is $6.25 million.)
The following sections offer more detail about current assets and liabilities.
Current (short-term) assets
Short-term, or current, assets include:
 Cash
 Marketable securities that can be immediately converted into cash
 Assets converted into cash within one operating cycle
The operating cycle refers to the repetitive process of putting cash into inven-
tory, holding products in inventory until they are sold, selling products on
credit (which generates accounts receivable), and collecting the receivables
in cash. In other words, the operating cycle is the “from cash — through
inventory and accounts receivable — back to cash” sequence. The operating
cycles of businesses vary from a few weeks to several months, depending on
how long inventory is held before being sold and how long it takes to collect
cash from sales made on credit.
Current (short-term) liabilities
Short-term, or current, liabilities include non-interest-bearing liabilities that
arise from the operating (sales and expense) activities of the business. A 
typical business keeps many accounts for these liabilities — a separate
account for each vendor, for instance. In an external balance sheet you 
usually find only three or four operating liabilities, and they are not labeled
as non-interest-bearing. It is assumed that the reader knows that these oper-
ating liabilities don’t bear interest (unless the liability is seriously overdue
and the creditor has started charging interest because of the delay in paying
the liability).
104
Part II: Figuring Out Financial Statements 

The balance sheet example shown in Figure 5-2 discloses three operating 
liabilities: accounts payable, accrued expenses payable, and income tax
payable. Be warned that the terminology for these short-term operating 
liabilities varies from business to business.
In addition to operating liabilities, interest-bearing notes payable that have
maturity dates one year or less from the balance sheet date are included in
the current liabilities section. The current liabilities section may also include
certain other liabilities that must be paid in the short run (which are too
varied and technical to discuss here).
Current ratio
The sources of cash for paying current liabilities are the company’s current
assets. That is, current assets are the first source of money to pay current lia-
bilities when these liabilities come due. Remember that current assets consist
of cash and assets that will be converted into cash in the short run. To size up
current assets against total current liabilities, the current ratio is calculated.
Using information from the company’s balance sheet (refer to Figure 5-2), you
compute its year-end 2009 current ratio as follows:
$8,815,000 current assets ÷ $4,030,000 current
liabilities = 2.2 current ratio
Generally, businesses do not provide their current ratio on the face of their
balance sheets or in the footnotes to their financial statements — they leave
it to the reader to calculate this number. On the other hand, many businesses
present a financial highlights section in their financial report, which often
includes the current ratio.
Folklore has it that a company’s current ratio should be at least 2.0. However,
business managers know that an acceptable current ratio depends a great
deal on general practices in the industry for short-term borrowing. Some
businesses do well with a current ratio less than 2.0, so take the 2.0 bench-
mark with a grain of salt. A lower current ratio does not necessarily mean
that the business won’t be able to pay its short-term (current) liabilities on
time. Chapters 13 and 17 explain solvency in more detail.
Preparing multiyear statements
The three primary financial statements of a business, including the balance
sheet, are generally reported in a two- or three-year comparative format. To
give you a sense of comparative financial statements, I present a two-year
comparative format for the balance sheet in Figure 5-2. Two- or three-year
comparative financial statements are de rigueur in filings with the Securities
105
Chapter 5: Reporting Assets, Liabilities, and Owners’ Equity

and Exchange Commission (SEC). Public companies have no choice, but pri-
vate businesses are not under the SEC’s jurisdiction. Generally accepted
accounting principles (GAAP) favor presenting comparative financial state-
ments for two or more years, but I’ve seen financial reports of private busi-
nesses that do not present information for prior years.
The main reason for presenting two- or three-year comparative financial
statements is for trend analysis. The business’s managers, as well as its out-
side investors and creditors, are extremely interested in the general trend of
sales, profit margins, ratio of debt to equity, and many other vital signs of the
business. Slippage in the ratio of gross margin to sales from year to year, for
example, is a very serious matter.
Coupling the Income Statement 
and Balance Sheet
Chapter 4 explains that sales and expense transactions change certain assets
and liabilities of a business (which are summarized in Figure 5-1). Even in the
relatively straightforward business example introduced in Chapter 4, we see
that cash and four other assets are involved, and three liabilities are involved
in the profit-making activities of a business. I explore these key interconnec-
tions between revenue and expenses and the assets and liabilities of a busi-
ness here. It turns out that the profit-making activities of a business shape a
large part of its balance sheet.
Figure 5-3 shows the vital links between sales revenue and expenses and the
assets and liabilities that are driven by these profit-seeking activities. Please
note that I do not include cash in Figure 5-3. Sooner or later, sales and
expenses flow through cash; cash is the pivotal asset of every business.
Chapter 6 examines cash flows and the financial statement that reports the
cash flows of a business. Here I focus on the non-cash assets of a business, as
well as its liabilities and owners’ equity accounts that are directly affected by
sales and expenses. You may be anxious to examine cash flows, but as we say
in Iowa, “Hold your horses.” I’ll get to cash in Chapter 6.
The income statement in Figure 5-3 continues the same business example I
introduce in Chapter 4. It’s the same income statement but with one modifica-
tion. Notice that the depreciation expense for the year is taken out of selling,
general, and administrative expenses. We need to see depreciation expense on
a separate line.

Figure 5-3 highlights the key connections between particular assets and liabil-
ities and sales revenue and expenses. Business managers need a good under-
standing of these connections to control assets and liabilities. And outside
investors and creditors should understand these connections to interpret the
financial statements of a business (see Chapters 13 and 17).

Chapter 5: Reporting Assets, Liabilities, and Owners’ Equity

Sizing up assets and liabilities
Although the business example I use in this chapter is hypothetical, I didn’t
make up the numbers at random. For the example, I use a modest-sized busi-
ness that has $26 million in annual sales revenue. The other numbers in its
income statement and balance sheet are realistic relative to each other. I
assume that the business earns 45 percent gross margin ($11.7 million gross
margin ÷ $26 million sales revenue = 45 percent), which means its cost of
goods sold expense is 55 percent of sales revenue. The sizes of particular
assets and liabilities compared with their relevant income statement num-
bers vary from industry to industry, and even from business to business in
the same industry.
Based on its history and operating policies, the managers of a business can
estimate what the size of each asset and liability should be, which provide
very useful control benchmarks against which the actual balances of the
assets and liabilities are compared, to spot any serious deviations. In other
words, assets (and liabilities, too) can be too high or too low relative to the
sales revenue and expenses that drive them, and these deviations can cause
problems that managers should try to correct.
For example, based on the credit terms extended to its customers and the
company’s actual policies regarding how aggressively it acts in collecting
past-due receivables, a manager determines the range for the proper, or
within-the-boundaries, balance of accounts receivable. This figure is the con-
trol benchmark. If the actual balance is reasonably close to this control
108
Part II: Figuring Out Financial Statements 
Turning over assets
Assets should be turned over, or put to use, by
making sales. The higher the turnover — the more
times the assets are used, and then replaced —
the better, because every sale is a profit-making
opportunity. The asset turnover ratio compares
annual sales revenue with total assets. In our
business example, the company’s asset turnover
ratio is computed as follows for the year 2009
(using relevant data from Figures 5-2 and 5-3):
$26,000,000 annual sales revenue ÷
$14,850,000 total assets = 1.75 asset
turnover ratio
Some industries are very capital-intensive,
which means that they have low asset turnover
ratios; they need a lot of assets to support their
sales. For example, gas and electric utilities are
capital-intensive. Many retailers, on the other
hand, do not need a lot of assets to make sales.
Their asset turnover ratios are relatively high;
their annual sales are three, four, or five times
their assets. Our business example that has a
1.75 asset turnover ratio falls in the broad
middle range of businesses that sell products.

benchmark, accounts receivable is under control. If not, the manager should
investigate why accounts receivable is smaller or larger than it should be.
The following sections discuss the relative sizes of the assets and liabilities 
in the balance sheet that result from sales and expenses (for the fiscal year
2009). The sales and expenses are the drivers, or causes, of the assets and 
liabilities. If a business earned profit simply by investing in stocks and bonds,
it would not need all the various assets and liabilities explained in this chap-
ter. Such a business — a mutual fund, for example — would have just one
income-producing asset: investments in securities. This chapter focuses on
businesses that sell products on credit.
Sales revenue and accounts receivable
In Figure 5-3 annual sales revenue for the year 2009 is $26 million. The year-
end accounts receivable is one-tenth of this, or $2.6 million. The average 
customer’s credit period is roughly 36 days: 365 days in the year times the 
10 percent ratio of ending accounts receivable balance to annual sales rev-
enue. Of course, some customers’ balances are past 36 days, and some are
quite new; you want to focus on the average. The key question is whether a
customer credit period averaging 36 days is reasonable.
Suppose that the business offers all customers a 30-day credit period, which
is fairly common in business-to-business selling (although not for a retailer
selling to individual consumers). The relatively small deviation of about 6
days (36 days average credit period versus 30 days normal credit terms)
probably is not a significant cause for concern. But suppose that, at the end
of the period, the accounts receivable had been $3.9 million, which is 15 per-
cent of annual sales, or about a 55-day average credit period. Such an abnor-
mally high balance should raise a red flag; the responsible manager should
look into the reasons for the abnormally high accounts receivable balance.
Perhaps several customers are seriously late in paying and should not be
extended new credit until they pay up.
Cost of goods sold expense and inventory
In Figure 5-3 the cost of goods sold expense for the year 2009 is $14.3 million.
The year-end inventory is $3.45 million, or about 24 percent. In rough terms,
the average product’s inventory holding period is 88 days — 365 days in the
year times the 24 percent ratio of ending inventory to annual cost of goods
sold. Of course, some products may remain in inventory longer than the 
88-day average, and some products may sell in a much shorter period than 
88 days. You need to focus on the overall average. Is an 88-day average inven-
tory holding period reasonable?
109
Chapter 5: Reporting Assets, Liabilities, and Owners’ Equity

The “correct” average inventory holding period varies from industry to
industry. In some industries, especially heavy equipment manufacturing, 
the inventory holding period is very long — three months or longer. The
opposite is true for high-volume retailers, such as retail supermarkets, that
depend on getting products off the shelves as quickly as possible. The 88-day
average holding period in the example is reasonable for many businesses but
would be too high for some businesses.
The managers should know what the company’s average inventory holding
period should be — they should know what the control benchmark is for the
inventory holding period. If inventory is much above this control benchmark,
managers should take prompt action to get inventory back in line (which is
easier said than done, of course). If inventory is at abnormally low levels, this
should be investigated as well. Perhaps some products are out of stock and
should be immediately restocked to avoid lost sales.
Fixed assets and depreciation expense
As Chapter 4 explains, depreciation is a relatively unique expense.
Depreciation is like other expenses in that all expenses are deducted from
sales revenue to determine profit. Other than this, however, depreciation is
very different from other expenses. When a business buys or builds a long-
term operating asset, the cash outlay for the asset is recorded in a fixed 
asset account. The cost of a fixed asset is spread out, or allocated, over its
expected useful life to the business. The depreciation expense recorded in
the period does not require any further cash outlay during the period. (The
cash outlay occurred when the fixed asset was acquired.) Rather, deprecia-
tion expense for the period is that portion of the total cost of a business’s
fixed assets that is allocated to the period to record the cost of using the
assets during the period. Depreciation depends on which method is used to
allocate the cost of fixed assets over their estimated useful lives. I explain 
different depreciation methods in Chapter 7.
The higher the total cost of its fixed assets (called property, plant, and 
equipment in a formal balance sheet), the higher a business’s depreciation
expense. However, there is no standard ratio of depreciation expense to the
cost of fixed assets. The annual depreciation expense of a business seldom is
more than 10 to 15 percent of the original cost of its fixed assets. Either the
depreciation expense for the year is reported as a separate expense in the
income statement (as in Figure 5-3), or the amount is disclosed in a footnote.
Because depreciation is based on the gradual charging off, or writing-down
of, the cost of a fixed asset, the balance sheet reports not one but two num-
bers: the original (historical) cost of its fixed assets and the accumulated
depreciation amount (the total amount of depreciation that has been charged
to expense from the time of acquiring the fixed assets to the current balance
110
Part II: Figuring Out Financial Statements 

sheet date). The purpose isn’t to confuse you by giving you even more num-
bers to deal with. Seeing both numbers gives you an idea of how old the fixed
assets are and also tells you how much these fixed assets originally cost.
In the example we’re working with in this chapter, the business has, over sev-
eral years, invested $12,450,000 in its fixed assets (that it still owns and uses),
and it has recorded total depreciation of $6,415,000 through the end of the
most recent fiscal year, December 31, 2009. (Refer to the balance sheet pre-
sented in Figure 5-2.) The business recorded $775,000 depreciation expense
in its most recent year. (See its income statement in Figure 5-3.)
You can tell that the company’s collection of fixed assets includes some old
assets because the company has recorded $6,415,000 total depreciation since
assets were bought — a fairly sizable percent of original cost (more than
half). But many businesses use accelerated depreciation methods that pile up
a lot of the depreciation expense in the early years and less in the back years
(see Chapter 7 for more details), so it’s hard to estimate the average age of
the company’s assets. A business could discuss the actual ages of its fixed
assets in the footnotes to its financial statements, but hardly any businesses
disclose this information — although they do identify which depreciation
methods they are using.
SG&A expenses and their three 
balance sheet accounts
Take yet another look at Figure 5-3 and notice that sales, general, and admin-
istrative (SG&A) expenses connect with three balance sheet accounts: pre-
paid expenses, accounts payable, and accrued expenses payable. The broad
SG&A expense category includes many different types of expenses in making
sales and operating the business. (Separate expense accounts are maintained
for specific expenses; depending on the size of the business and the needs of
its various managers, hundreds or thousands of specific expense accounts
are established.)
For bookkeeping convenience, a business records many expenses when the
expense is paid. For example, wage and salary expenses are recorded on
payday. However, this “record as you pay” method does not work for many
expenses. For instance, insurance and office supplies costs are prepaid, and
then released to expense gradually over time. The cost is initially put in the
prepaid expenses asset account. (Yes, I know that “prepaid expenses” doesn’t
sound like an asset account, but it is.) Other expenses are not paid until
weeks after the expenses are recorded. The amounts owed for these unpaid
expenses are recorded in an accounts payable or in an accrued expenses
payable liability account.
111
Chapter 5: Reporting Assets, Liabilities, and Owners’ Equity

I won’t go through all the details of how I came up with the year-end balances
in prepaid expenses, accounts payable, and accrued expenses payable (aren’t
you lucky!). For more details, you may want to take a look at Chapter 4.
Remember that the accounting objective is to match expenses with sales rev-
enue for the year, and only in this way can the amount of profit be measured
for the year. So expenses recorded for the year should be the correct
amounts, regardless of when they’re paid.
Intangible assets and 
amortization expense
Although our business example does not include these kinds of assets, many
businesses invest in intangible assets. Intangible means without physical exis-
tence, in contrast to buildings, vehicles, and computers. For example:
 A business may purchase the customer list of another company that is
going out of business.
 A business may buy patent rights from the inventor of a new product or
process.
 A business may buy another business lock, stock, and barrel and may
pay more than the total of the individual assets of the company being
bought are worth — even after adjusting the particular assets to their
current values. The extra amount is for goodwill, which may consist of a
trained and efficient workforce, an established product with a reputation
for high quality, or a very valuable location.
Only intangible assets that are purchased are recorded by a business. A busi-
ness must expend cash, or take on debt, or issue owners’ equity shares for an
intangible asset in order to record the asset on its books. Building up a good
reputation with customers or establishing a well-known brand is not recorded
as an intangible asset. You can imagine the value of Coca-Cola’s brand name,
but this “asset” is not recorded on the company’s books. (However, Coca-Cola
protects its brand name with all the legal means at its disposal.)
The cost of an intangible asset is put in the appropriate asset account, just
like the cost of a tangible asset is recorded in a fixed asset account. And, like
a fixed asset account (with the exception of land), the cost of an intangible
asset that has a limited useful economic life is allocated over its estimated
useful life. (Note: Certain intangible assets are viewed as having more or less
perpetual useful lives.) The allocation of the cost of an intangible asset over
its estimated economic life is called amortization. Amortization expense is
very similar to depreciation expense. Because our business example does not
include any intangible assets, there is no amortization expense.
112
Part II: Figuring Out Financial Statements 

Debt and interest expense
Look back at the balance sheet shown in Figure 5-2. Notice that the sum of
this business’s short-term (current) and long-term notes payable at year-end
2009 is $6.25 million. From its income statement in Figure 5-3 we see that its
interest expense for the year was $400,000. Based on the year-end amount of
debt, the annual interest rate is about 6.4 percent. (The business may have
had more or less borrowed at certain times during the year, of course, and
the actual interest rate depends on the debt levels from month to month.)
For most businesses, a small part of their total annual interest is unpaid at
year-end; the unpaid part is recorded to bring interest expense up to the cor-
rect total amount for the year. In Figure 5-3, the accrued amount of interest is
included in the accrued expenses payable liability account. In most balance
sheets you don’t find accrued interest payable on a separate line; rather, it’s
included in the accrued expenses payable liability account. However, if
unpaid interest at year-end happens to be a rather large amount, or if the
business is seriously behind in paying interest on its debt, it should report
the accrued interest payable as a separate liability.
113
Chapter 5: Reporting Assets, Liabilities, and Owners’ Equity
What about cash?
A business’s cash account consists of the
money it has in its checking accounts plus the
money that it keeps on hand. Cash is the essen-
tial lubricant of business activity. Sooner or
later, virtually all business transactions pass
through the cash account.
Every business needs to maintain a working
cash balance as a buffer against fluctuations in
day-to-day cash receipts and payments. You
can’t really get by with a zero cash balance,
hoping that enough customers will provide
enough cash to cover all the cash payments
that you need to make that day.
At year-end 2009, the cash balance of the busi-
ness whose balance sheet is presented in
Figure 5-2 is $2,165,000, which equals a little
more than four weeks of annual sales revenue.
How large a cash balance should a business
maintain? This question has no simple answer.
A business needs to determine how large a
cash safety reserve it’s comfortable with to
meet unexpected demands on cash while keep-
ing the following points in mind:
 Excess cash balances are unproductive
and don’t earn any profit for the business.
 Insufficient cash balances can cause the
business to miss taking advantage of oppor-
tunities that require quick action — such as
snatching up a prized piece of real estate
that just came on the market or buying out a
competitor.

Income tax expense and 
income tax payable
In Figure 5-3, earnings before income tax — after deducting interest and all
other expenses from sales revenue — is $2.6 million. The actual taxable
income of the business for the year probably is different than this amount
because of the many complexities in the income tax law. In the example, I use
a realistic 35 percent tax rate, so the income tax expense is $910,000 of the
pretax income of $2.6 million.
A large part of the federal income tax amount for the year must be paid
before the end of the year. But a small part is usually still owed at the end 
of the year. The unpaid part is recorded in the income tax payable liability
account, as you see in Figure 5-3. In the example, the unpaid part is $115,000
of the total $910,000 income tax for the year, but I don’t mean to suggest that
this ratio is typical. Generally, the unpaid income tax at the end of the year is
fairly small, but just how small depends on several technical factors.
Net income and cash dividends (if any)
A business may have other sources of income during the year, such as inter-
est income on investments. In this example, however, the business has only
sales revenue, which is gross income from the sale of products and services.
All expenses — starting with cost of goods sold down to and including
income tax — are deducted from sales revenue to arrive at the last, or
bottom, line of the income statement. The preferred term for bottom-line
profit is net income, as you see in Figure 5-3.
The $1.69 million net income for the year increases the owners’ equity
account retained earnings by the same amount, which is indicated by the line
of connection from net income to retained earnings in Figure 5-3. The $1.69
million profit (here I go again using the term profit instead of net income)
either stays in the business or some of it is paid out and divided among the
owners of the business. This business paid out cash distributions from profit
during the year, and the total of these cash payments to its owners (share-
holders) is recorded as a decrease in retained earnings. You can’t tell from
the income statement or the balance sheet the amount of cash dividends.
You have to look in the statement of cash flows for this information (which I
explain in Chapter 6).
114
Part II: Figuring Out Financial Statements 

Financing a Business
To run a business, you need financial backing, otherwise known as capital. 
In broad overview, a business raises capital needed for its assets by buying
things on credit, waiting to pay some expenses, borrowing money, getting
owners to invest money in the business, and making profit that is retained in
the business. Borrowed money is known as debt; capital invested in the busi-
ness by its owners and retained profits are the two sources of owners’ equity.
How did the business whose balance sheet is shown in Figure 5-2 finance its
assets? Its total assets are $14.85 million at year-end 2009. The company’s
profit-making activities generated three liabilities — accounts payable,
accrued expenses payable, and income tax payable — and in total these
three liabilities provided $1.78 million of the total assets of the business. Debt
provided $6.25 million, and the two sources of owners’ equity provided the
other $6.82 million. All three sources add up to $14.85 million, which equals
total assets, of course. Otherwise, its books would be out of balance, which is
a definite no-no.
Accounts payable, accrued expenses payable, and income tax payable 
are short-term, non-interest-bearing liabilities that are sometimes called 
spontaneous liabilities because they arise directly from a business’s expense
activities — they aren’t the result of borrowing money but rather are the
result of buying things on credit or delaying payment of certain expenses.
It’s hard to avoid these three liabilities in running a business; they are gener-
ated naturally in the process of carrying on operations. In contrast, the mix
of debt (interest-bearing liabilities) and equity (invested owners’ capital and
retained earnings) requires careful thought and high-level decisions by a
business. There’s no natural, or automatic, answer to the debt-versus-equity
question. The business in the example has a large amount of debt relative to
its owners’ equity, which would make many business owners uncomfortable.
Debt is both good and bad, and in extreme situations it can get very ugly. The
advantages of debt are:
 Most businesses can’t raise all the capital they need from owners’ equity
sources, and debt offers another source of capital (though, of course,
many lenders are willing to provide only part of the capital that a busi-
ness needs).
 Interest rates charged by lenders are lower than rates of return expected
by owners. Owners expect a higher rate of return because they’re taking
a greater risk with their money — the business is not required to pay
them back the same way that it’s required to pay back a lender. For
example, a business may pay 6 percent annual interest on its debt and
be expected to earn a 12 percent annual rate of return on its owners’
equity. (See Chapter 13 for more on earning profit for owners.)
115
Chapter 5: Reporting Assets, Liabilities, and Owners’ Equity

The disadvantages of debt are:
 A business must pay the fixed rate of interest for the period even if it
suffers a loss for the period or earns a lower rate of return on its assets.
 A business must be ready to pay back the debt on the specified due
date, which can cause some pressure on the business to come up with
the money on time. (Of course, a business may be able to roll over or
renew its debt, meaning that it replaces its old debt with an equivalent
amount of new debt, but the lender has the right to demand that the old
debt be paid and not rolled over.)
If a business defaults on its debt contract — it doesn’t pay the interest on
time or doesn’t pay back the debt on the due date — it faces some major
unpleasantness. In extreme cases, a lender can force it to shut down and liq-
uidate its assets (that is, sell off everything it owns for cash) to pay off the
116
Part II: Figuring Out Financial Statements 
Financial leverage: Taking a chance on debt
The large majority of businesses borrow money
to provide part of the total capital needed for
their assets. The main reason for debt is to close
the gap between how much capital the owners
can come up with and the amount the business
needs. Lenders are willing to provide the capi-
tal because they have a senior claim on the
assets of the business. Debt has to be paid back
before the owners can get their money out of
the business. A business’s owners’ equity pro-
vides a relatively permanent base of capital and
gives its lenders a cushion of protection.
The owners use their capital invested in the
business as the basis to borrow. For example,
for every two bucks the owners have in the
business, lenders may be willing to add another
dollar (or even more). Using owners’ equity as
the basis for borrowing is referred to as finan-
cial leverage, because the equity base of the
business can be viewed as the fulcrum, and
borrowing is the lever for lifting the total capital
of the business.
A business can realize a financial leverage gain
by making more EBIT (earnings before interest
and income tax) on the amount borrowed than
the interest on the debt. For a simple example,
assume that debt supplies one-third of the total
capital of a business (and owners’ equity two-
thirds). Suppose the business’s EBIT for the year
just ended is a nice, round $3 million. Fair is fair,
so you could argue that the lenders, who put up
one-third of the money, should get one-third, or
$1 million, of the profit. This is not how it works.
The lenders get only the interest amount on
their loans. Suppose the total interest for the
year is $600,000. The financial leverage gain,
therefore, is $400,000. The owners would get
their two-thirds share of EBIT plus the $400,000
pretax financial leverage gain.
On the flip side, using debt may not yield a finan-
cial leverage gain, but rather a financial leverage
loss. One-third of a company’s EBIT may equal
less than the interest due on its debt. That inter-
est has to be paid no matter what amount of EBIT
the business earns. Suppose EBIT equals zero
for the year. Nevertheless, the business must pay
the interest on its debt. So, the business would
have a bottom-line loss for the year.

debt and unpaid interest. Just as you can lose your home if you don’t pay
your home mortgage, a business can be forced into involuntary bankruptcy if
it doesn’t pay its debts. A lender may allow the business to try to work out its
financial crisis through bankruptcy procedures, but bankruptcy is a nasty
affair that invariably causes many problems and can really cripple a business.
Costs and Other Balance Sheet Values
In my experience, the values for assets reported in a balance sheet can be a
source of confusion for both business managers and investors, who tend to
put all dollar amounts on the same value basis. In their minds, a dollar is a
dollar, whether it’s in accounts receivable, inventory, fixed assets, accounts
payable, or retained earnings. However, this naïve assumption glosses over
important differences and can lead to serious misinterpretation of the bal-
ance sheet. A balance sheet reports a rainbow of values — not just one color.
This is the nature of the generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) —
the accounting methods used to prepare financial statements for the external
financial reporting by a business (see Chapter 2).
Book values are the amounts recorded in the accounting process and
reported in financial statements. Do not assume that the book values
reported in a balance sheet necessarily equal the current market values. Book
values are based on the accounting methods used by a business. Generally
speaking, the amounts reported for cash, accounts receivable, and liabilities
are equal to or are very close to their current market or settlement values.
For example, accounts receivable will be turned into cash for the amount
recorded on the balance sheet, and liabilities will be paid off at the amounts
reported in the balance sheet. It’s the book values of inventory and fixed
assets, as well as any other assets in which the business invested some time
ago, that most likely are lower than current replacement values.
Different businesses select different accounting methods to determine their
cost of inventory and how much of each of their fixed assets’ costs are allo-
cated to depreciation expense each year. A business is free to use very con-
servative accounting methods — with the result that its inventory cost value
and the undepreciated cost of its fixed assets may be considerably lower
than the current replacement cost values of these assets. Chapter 7 explains
about choosing from among alternative accounting methods.
A business may use accounting methods that have the effect of recording
higher profit and higher asset values than would exist under more conserva-
tive accounting methods. Even so, the current replacement values of its inven-
tory and fixed assets may be quite a bit higher than the recorded costs of these
assets, in particular for buildings, land, heavy machinery, and equipment. For
example, the aircraft fleet of United Airlines, as reported in its balance sheet, is
117
Chapter 5: Reporting Assets, Liabilities, and Owners’ Equity

hundreds of millions of dollars less than the current cost it would have to pay
to replace the planes. Complicating matters is the fact that many of its older
planes are not being produced any more, and United would replace the older
planes with newer models.
Businesses are not permitted under GAAP to write up the book values of
their assets to current market or replacement values. (Well, investments in
marketable securities held or available for sale have to be written up, or
down, but this is an exception to the general rule.) Although recording
market values has intuitive appeal, a mark-to-market valuation model is not
practical or appropriate for businesses that sell products and services. These
businesses do not stand ready to sell their assets (other than inventory);
they need their assets for operating the business into the future. At the end
of their useful lives, assets are sold for their disposable values (or traded in
for new assets).

S
uppose that a business’s cash balance decreases $110,000 during the
year. You see this decrease in the company’s balance sheets for the 
years ended December 31, 2008 and 2009. The business started the year with
$2,275,000 cash and ended the year with $2,165,000 (as in the business exam-
ple I use in Chapters 4 and 5.) What does the balance sheet tell you about the
reasons for the cash decrease? Well, not a whole lot. Answering such a ques-
tion is not the nature or purpose of a balance sheet.
One possibility is that the business suffered a large loss in 2009 that caused a
drain on cash. You can look at its 2009 income statement to find out whether
the business had a loss or made a profit, but this financial statement does not
report the cash flow effect from the loss or profit. Another possibility for the
cash decrease is that the business paid down its debt. Or perhaps the com-
pany made large investments in new machines and equipment during the
year. Where do you look for such information? Answering this question is the
main purpose of this chapter, which introduces the third key financial state-
ment: the statement of cash flows.
Seeing the Big Picture of Cash Flows
People generally understand that a business increases its cash by increasing
its debt and by its owners investing more money in the business. They under-
stand that a business can also sell some of its assets to provide cash. They

know that its cash decreases when a business pays down its debt, returns
some of the capital that its owners had previously invested in the business,
and invests in new fixed assets (buildings, machines, equipment, vehicles,
and so on).
Most people also know there is another important source of cash: making
profit. However, things get a little tricky regarding this source of cash. One
problem is this: Instead of saying that a business “earns profit,” people say
that a business “makes money.” Therefore, many people assume that the
bottom-line profit for the year increases cash exactly the same amount — no
more, and no less. Not true: The actual amount of cash flow from making
profit is invariably different than the amount of profit earned for the period.
Earning profit and generating cash flow from the profit are two different
things. You’re talking about apples and oranges when you’re talking about
profit and cash flow from profit.
Here’s a very brief explanation of why profit and cash flow from profit are 
different amounts. When a business makes sales on credit, sales revenue is
recorded before cash is collected from customers. Cash inflow from credit
sales takes place after recording the sales revenue. Also, many expenses 
are recorded before cash is paid for the liabilities incurred by the expenses.
So, cash outflow for the expenses takes place after recording the expenses.
Furthermore, the recording of depreciation expense does not require a cash
outlay in the period. You could simply add back depreciation expense to
bottom-line profit to get a rough (and I mean rough) measure of cash flow
from making profit. But this shortcut ignores the other factors that affect
cash flow from profit, and I don’t recommend it.
Note: Because I use the same business example in this chapter that I use 
in Chapters 4 and 5, you may want to take a moment to review its 2009
income statement in Figure 4-1. And you may want to review Figure 5-1, 
which summarizes how the three types of activities changed its assets, 
liabilities, and owners’ equity accounts during the year 2009. (Go ahead, 
I’ll wait.)
Suppose the president of the business asks me, the chief accountant (con-
troller), for an executive summary of the company’s sources and uses of cash
during the year ended December 31, 2009. The president does not want a
formal, detailed financial statement with all the bells and whistles. He wants a
very brief summary that speaks to him as the very busy chief executive of
the business. Here’s what I would prepare for him:
120

The president would do a critical review of the strategic decisions that were
made during the year. For example, was it prudent to take on more debt? Why
did the shareowners invest an additional $150,000 in the business, and will
they invest additional capital during the coming year? Should the business
have distributed about half of the cash flow from profit to its owners? I return
to these issues in the last section of the chapter, “Being an Active Reader.”
You may be wondering how I got the information to prepare the executive
summary of cash flows for the president. I extracted the relevant information
from the company’s asset, liability, and owners’ equity accounts. I examined
the increases and decreases entered in the accounts during the year to deter-
mine the amounts you see in the executive summary. This is no problem; 
I’m an accountant, you know. Accountants prepare detailed spreadsheets in
which changes in the asset, liability, and owners’ equity accounts are ana-
lyzed and classified in order to prepare a statement of cash flows, or an exec-
utive summary such as the one I show here. Computer software programs
can be used for this purpose.
The president of the business can request any particular accounting report
or summary that he wants. The president is not limited or restricted to the
format and content of the three financial statements that are prepared for
external reporting. If the president wants an executive summary of cash
flows, as opposed to a formal statement of cash flows as it is presented in 
the external financial report of the business, then as controller I prepare the
executive summary. I know which side my bread is buttered on. There are no
restrictions regarding how to report cash flows internally (inside the busi-
ness to its managers). If the president doesn’t like or doesn’t understand the
information I give him in the executive summary of cash flows, he will let me
know in no uncertain terms.
121
Chapter 6: Reporting Cash Flows

You may be wondering in particular how I got the $1,515,000 amount for cash
flow from making profit (see the executive summary). And, you may be won-
dering why this cash flow amount is different than the $1.69 million bottom-
line profit number reported in the company’s income statement for the year
(see Figure 4-1 in Chapter 4).
One purpose of the statement of cash flows is to report the cash flow from
making profit and to explain the difference between the cash flow number
and the bottom-line profit number in the income statement. The cash flow
number is based on actual cash inflows and outflows; the profit number is
based on accounting for sales revenue and expenses. Remember the follow-
ing points:
 If a business makes credit sales, the total cash inflow from customers is
different than the total sales revenue recorded in the year (unless the
business collects all its credit sales before the end of the year).
 The total cash outlay for expenses during the year is different than the
total amount of expenses recorded in the year.
The statement of cash flows begins with the cash flow from making profit, or
cash flow from operating activities as accountants call it. Operating activities is
the technical term that accountants have adopted for sales and expenses,
which are the “operations” that a business carries out to earn profit. I don’t
think it’s the best term in the world, but we are stuck with it; it’s part of the
official language of accounting.
Meeting the Statement of Cash Flows
I hate to start out like this, but I have to tell you that a business has its choice
between two quite different methods of reporting cash flow from operating
activities in its statement of cash flows. Financial reporting standards permit
either approach. I first show you the preferred method, and then the alterna-
tive. Figure 6-1 presents the statement of cash flows for our business example
dressed to the nines, in formal attire. This is not a condensed version; it’s the
real thing, not an executive summary. One main difference, as compared with
the executive summary of cash flows I prepared for the president, is seen in
the first section, Cash Flows from Operating Activities.
What you see in the first section of the statement of cash flows is called the
direct method for reporting cash flow from operating activities. I think the
term “direct” is meant to refer to the cash flows connected with sales and
expenses. For example, the business collects $25.55 million from customers
during the year, which is the direct result of making sales.
122
Part II: Figuring Out Financial Statements 

Note in Figure 6-1 that cash flow from operating activities for the year is
$1,515,000, which is $175,000 less than the company’s $1,690,000 net income
for the year (refer to Figure 4-1). When issuing the financial reporting standard
for the statement of cash flows, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
(FASB) thought that financial report readers would compare cash flow from
operating activities with net income, and they would want some sort of expla-
nation for the difference between these two important financial numbers.
Therefore, the FASB decreed that the statement of cash flows should also
include a reconciliation schedule to explain the difference between cash flow
from operating activities and net income. Or, a business can use the alterna-
tive method for reporting cash flow from operating activities. The alternative

Part II: Figuring Out Financial Statements 

The indirect method for reporting cash flow from operating activities focuses
on the changes during the year in the assets and liabilities that are connected
with sales and expenses. I explain these connections in Chapter 4. (You can
also trace these changes back to Figure 5-1, which includes the start-of-year
and end-of-year balances of the balance sheet accounts for the business
example.)
While there are obvious differences in the first section of the statement of
cash flows between the two methods for reporting cash flow from operating
activities, the other two sections of the statement — cash flow from investing
activities and cash flow from financing activities — are the same. The level of
detail disclosed in these two sections varies from business to business. For
example, some companies report one aggregate amount for all capital expen-
ditures (investments in new long-term operating assets), whereas others give
a more detailed breakdown.
Dissecting the Difference Between 
Cash Flow and Net Income
A positive cash flow from operating activities is the amount of cash gener-
ated by a business’s profit-making operations during the year, exclusive of its
other sources of cash during the year. Cash flow from operating activities
indicates a business’s ability to turn profit into available cash — cash in the
bank that can be used for the needs of business. As you see in Figure 6-1 or
Figure 6-2 (take your pick), the business in our example generated $1,515,000
cash from its profit-making activities in the year. As they say in New York,
“That isn’t chopped liver.”
The business in our example experienced a strong growth year. Its accounts
receivable and inventory increased by relatively large amounts. In fact, all its
assets and liabilities intimately connected with sales and expenses increased;
their ending balances are larger than their beginning balances (which are the
amounts carried forward from the end of the preceding year). Of course, this
may not always be the case in a growth situation; one or more assets and lia-
bilities could decrease during the year. For flat, no-growth situations, it’s
likely that there will be a mix of modest-sized increases and decreases.
The following sections explain how the asset and liability changes affect cash
flow from operating activities. As a business manager, you should keep a
close watch on the changes in each of your assets and liabilities and under-
stand the cash flow effects caused by these changes. Investors should focus
on the business’s ability to generate a healthy cash flow from operating activ-
ities, so investors should be equally concerned about these changes. In some
situations these changes can signal serious problems!
125
Chapter 6: Reporting Cash Flows

I realize that you may not be too interested in the details that I discuss in the
following sections. With this in mind, at the start of each section I present the
punch line. If you wish, you can just read this and move on. But the details
are fascinating (well, at least to accountants).
Note: Instead of using the full phrase “cash flow from operating activities”
every time, I use the shorter term “cash flow” in the following sections. All
data for assets and liabilities are found in the two-year balance sheet of the
business (see Figure 5-2).
Accounts receivable change
Punch Line: An increase in accounts receivable hurts cash flow; a decrease
helps cash flow.
The accounts receivable asset shows how much money customers who
bought products on credit still owe the business; this asset is a promise 
of cash that the business will receive. Basically, accounts receivable is the
amount of uncollected sales revenue at the end of the period. Cash does 
not increase until the business collects money from its customers.
The business started the year with $2.15 million and ended the year with $2.6
million in accounts receivable. The beginning balance was collected during
the year, but the ending balance had not been collected at the end of the
year. Thus the net effect is a shortfall in cash inflow of $450,000. The key 
point is that you need to keep an eye on the increase or decrease in accounts
receivable from the beginning of the period to the end of the period. Here’s
what to look for:
 If the amount of credit sales you made during the period is greater than
what you collected from customers during the period, your accounts
receivable increased over the period, and you need to subtract from net
income that difference between start-of-period accounts receivable and
end-of-period accounts receivable. In short, an increase in accounts
receivable hurts cash flow by the amount of the increase.
 If the amount you collected from customers during the period is greater
than the credit sales you made during the period, your accounts receiv-
able decreased over the period, and you need to add to net income that
difference between start-of-period accounts receivable and end-of-period
accounts receivable. In short, a decrease in accounts receivable helps
cash flow by the amount of the decrease.
126
Part II: Figuring Out Financial Statements 

In our business example, accounts receivable increased $450,000. Cash col-
lections from sales were $450,000 less than sales revenue. Ouch! The busi-
ness increased its sales substantially over the last period, so you shouldn’t
be surprised that its accounts receivable increased. The higher sales revenue
was good for profit but bad for cash flow.
The “lagging behind” effect of cash flow is the price of growth — managers
and investors need to understand this point. Increasing sales without increas-
ing accounts receivable is a happy situation for cash flow, but in the real
world you usually can’t have one increase without the other.
Inventory change
Punch Line: An increase in inventory hurts cash flow; a decrease helps cash
flow.
Inventory is usually the largest short-term, or current, asset of businesses
that sell products. If the inventory account is greater at the end of the period
than at the start of the period — because unit costs increased or because the
quantity of products increased — the amount the business actually paid out
in cash for inventory purchases (or for manufacturing products) is more than
what the business recorded in the cost of goods sold expense for the period.
In our business example, inventory increased $725,000 from start-of-year to
end-of-year. In other words, to support its higher sales levels in 2009, this
business replaced the products that it sold during the year and increased its
inventory by $725,000. The business had to come up with the cash to pay for
this inventory increase. Basically, the business wrote checks amounting to
$725,000 more than its cost of goods sold expense for the period. This step-
up in its inventory level was necessary to support the higher sales level,
which increased profit even though cash flow took a hit.
Prepaid expenses change
Punch Line: An increase in prepaid expenses (an asset account) hurts cash
flow; a decrease helps cash flow.
A change in the prepaid expenses asset account works the same way as a
change in inventory and accounts receivable, although changes in prepaid
expenses are usually much smaller than changes in those other two asset
accounts.
127
Chapter 6: Reporting Cash Flows

The beginning balance of prepaid expenses is charged to expense this year,
but the cash for this amount was actually paid out last year. This period (the
year 2009 in our example), the business pays cash for next period’s prepaid
expenses, which affects this period’s cash flow but doesn’t affect net income
until next period. In short, the $75,000 increase in prepaid expenses in this
business example has a negative cash flow effect.
As it grows, a business needs to increase its prepaid expenses for such things
as fire insurance (premiums have to be paid in advance of the insurance 
coverage) and its stocks of office and data processing supplies. Increases 
in accounts receivable, inventory, and prepaid expenses are the cash flow
price a business has to pay for growth. Rarely do you find a business that 
can increase its sales revenue without increasing these assets.
The depreciation factor
Punch Line: Recording depreciation expense decreases the book value of
long-term operating (fixed) assets. There is no cash outlay when recording
depreciation expense. Each year the business converts part of the total cost
invested in its fixed assets into cash. It recovers this amount through cash
collections from sales. Thus, depreciation is a positive cash flow factor.
The amount of depreciation expense recorded in the period is a portion of
the original cost of the business’s fixed assets, most of which were bought
and paid for years ago. (Chapters 4 and 5 explain more about depreciation.)
Because the depreciation expense is not a cash outlay this period, the
amount is added to net income to determine cash flow from operating activi-
ties (see Figure 6-2).
For measuring profit, depreciation is definitely an expense — no doubt about
it. Buildings, machinery, equipment, tools, vehicles, computers, and office
furniture are all on an irreversible journey to the junk heap (although build-
ings usually take a long time to get there). Fixed assets (except for land) have
a limited, finite life of usefulness to a business; depreciation is the accounting
method that allocates the total cost of fixed assets to each year of their use in
helping the business generate sales revenue.
In our example, the business recorded $775,000 depreciation expense for 
the year. Instead of looking at depreciation as only an expense, consider the
investment-recovery cycle of fixed assets. A business invests money in its
fixed assets that are then used for several or many years. Over the life of 
a fixed asset, a business has to recover through sales revenue the cost
invested in the fixed asset (ignoring any salvage value at the end of its useful
life). In a real sense, a business “sells” some of its fixed assets each period to
its customers — it factors the cost of fixed assets into the sales prices that it
charges its customers.
128
Part II: Figuring Out Financial Statements 

For example, when you go to a supermarket, a very small slice of the price
you pay for that quart of milk goes toward the cost of the building, the
shelves, the refrigeration equipment, and so on. (No wonder they charge so
much!) Each period, a business recoups part of the cost invested in its fixed
assets. In the example, $775,000 of sales revenue went toward reimbursing
the business for the use of its fixed assets during the year. In short, deprecia-
tion is a positive cash flow factor. The depreciation amount is imbedded in
sales revenue, and sales revenue generates cash flow.
The business in our example does not own any intangible assets and, thus,
does not record any amortization expense. (See Chapter 5 for an explanation
of intangible assets and amortization.) If a business does own intangible
assets, the amortization expense on these assets for the year is treated the
same as depreciation is treated in the statement of cash flows. In other
words, the recording of amortization expense does not require cash outlay in
the year being charged with the expense. The cash outlay occurred in prior
periods when the business invested in intangible assets.
Changes in operating liabilities
Punch Line: An increase in a short-term operating liability helps cash flow; a
decrease hurts cash flow.
The business in our example, like almost all businesses, has three basic liabil-
ities inextricably intertwined with its expenses:
 Accounts payable
 Accrued expenses payable
 Income tax payable
When the beginning balance of one of these liability accounts is the same as
its ending balance (not too likely, of course), the business breaks even on
cash flow for that account. When the end-of-period balance is higher than the
start-of-period balance, the business did not pay out as much money as was
recorded as an expense in the year.
In our business example, the business disbursed $640,000 to pay off last year’s
accounts payable balance. (This $640,000 was the accounts payable balance
at December 31, 2008, the end of the previous fiscal year.) Its cash this year
decreased $640,000 because of these payments. But this year’s ending balance
sheet (at December 31, 2009) shows accounts payable of $765,000 that the
business will not pay until the following year. This $765,000 amount was
recorded to expense in the year 2009. So, the amount of expense was $125,000
129
Chapter 6: Reporting Cash Flows

more than the cash outlay for the year; or, in reverse, the cash outlay was
$125,000 less than the expense. An increase in accounts payable benefits cash
flow for the year. In other words, an increase in accounts payable has a posi-
tive cash flow effect. Increases in accrued expenses payable and income tax
payable work the same way.
In short, liability increases are favorable to cash flow — in a sense, the busi-
ness ran up more on credit than it paid off. Such an increase means that the
business delayed paying cash for certain things until next year. So you need
to add the increases in the three liabilities to net income to determine cash
flow, as you see in the statement of cash flows (refer to Figure 6-2). The busi-
ness avoided cash outlays to the extent of the increases in these three liabili-
ties. In some cases, of course, the ending balance of an operating liability
may be lower than its beginning balance, which means that the business paid
out more cash than the corresponding expenses for the period. In this case,
the decrease is a negative cash flow factor.
Putting the cash flow pieces together
The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) has expressed a definite
preference for the direct method of reporting cash flow from operating activi-
ties (refer to Figure 6-1). Nevertheless, this august rule-making body permits
the indirect method to be used in external financial reports. And, in fact, the
overwhelming majority of public companies use the indirect method. One
reason may be this: If a business uses the direct method format, it has to
include a supplementary schedule of changes in the assets and liabilities
affecting cash flow from operating activities. Therefore, most businesses
decide to provide the reconciliation between net income and cash flow by
using the indirect method. Go figure.
Taking into account all the adjustments to net income, the bottom line (oops,
I shouldn’t use that term when referring to cash flow) is that the company’s
cash balance increased $1,515,000 from its operating activities during the
year. The first section in the statement of cash flows (refer to Figure 6-2)
shows the stepping stones from net income to the amount of cash flow from
operating activities.
What do the figures in the first section of the cash flow statement (refer to
Figure 6-2) reveal about this business over the past period? Recall that the
business experienced sales growth during this period. The downside of sales
growth is that assets and liabilities also grow — the business needs more
inventory at the higher sales level and also has higher accounts receivable.
The business’s prepaid expenses and liabilities also increased, although not
nearly as much as accounts receivable and inventory.
130
Part II: Figuring Out Financial Statements 

The growth of the business in 2009 over 2008 yielded higher profit but also
caused a surge in its assets and liabilities — the result being that cash flow is
$175,000 less than its net income. Still, the business had $1,515,000 cash at its
disposal. What did the business do with this $1,515,000 of available cash? You
have to look to the remainder of the cash flow statement to answer this very
important question.
Sailing Through the Rest of the
Statement of Cash Flows
After you get past the first section of the statement of cash flows, the remain-
der is a breeze. Well, to be fair, you could encounter some rough seas in the
remaining two sections. But, generally speaking, the information in these sec-
tions is not too difficult to understand. The last two sections of the statement
report on the other sources of cash to the business and the uses the business
made of its cash during the year.
Investing activities
The second section of the statement of cash flows (see Figure 6-1 or 6-2)
reports the investment actions that a business’s managers took during the
year. Investments are like tea leaves, which serve as indicators regarding
what the future may hold for the company. Major new investments are the
sure signs of expanding or modernizing the production and distribution facili-
ties and capacity of the business. Major disposals of long-term assets and
shedding off a major part of the business could be good news or bad news
for the business, depending on many factors. Different investors may inter-
pret this information differently, but all would agree that the information in
this section of the cash flow statement is very important.
Certain long-lived operating assets are required for doing business. For exam-
ple, Federal Express and UPS wouldn’t be terribly successful if they didn’t
have airplanes and trucks for delivering packages and computers for tracking
deliveries. When these assets wear out, the business needs to replace them.
Also, to remain competitive, a business may need to upgrade its equipment
to take advantage of the latest technology or to provide for growth. These
investments in long-lived, tangible, productive assets, which are called fixed
assets for short, are critical to the future of the business. In fact, these cash
outlays are called capital expenditures to stress that capital is being invested
for the long haul.
131
Chapter 6: Reporting Cash Flows

One of the first claims on cash flow from operating activities is for capital
expenditures. Notice that the business spent $1,275,000 on fixed assets,
which are referred to more formally as property, plant, and equipment in the
cash flow statement (to keep the terminology consistent with account titles
used in the balance sheet — the term fixed assets is rather informal).
A typical statement of cash flows doesn’t go into much detail regarding
exactly what specific types of fixed assets the business purchased (or con-
structed): how many additional square feet of space the business acquired,
how many new drill presses it bought, and so on. Some businesses do leave 
a clearer trail of their investments, though. For example, in the footnotes or
elsewhere in their financial reports, airlines describe how many new aircraft of
each kind were purchased to replace old equipment or to expand their fleets.
Usually, a business disposes of some of its fixed assets every year because
they reached the end of their useful lives and will no longer be used. These
fixed assets are sent to the junkyard, traded in on new fixed assets, or sold
for relatively small amounts of money. The value of a fixed asset at the end 
of its useful life is called its salvage value. The disposal proceeds from selling
fixed assets are reported as a source of cash in the investing activities sec-
tion of the statement of cash flows. Usually, these amounts are fairly small.
Also, a business may sell off fixed assets because it’s downsizing or abandon-
ing a major segment of its business; these cash proceeds can be fairly large.
Financing activities
Note in the annual statement of cash flows for the business example (refer 
to Figure 6-1 or 6-2) that cash flow from operating activities is a positive
$1,515,000 and the negative cash flow from investing activities is $1,275,000.
The result to this point, therefore, is a net cash increase of $240,000, which
would have increased the company’s cash balance this much if the business
had no financing activities during the year. However, the business increased
its short-term and long-term debt during the year, its owners invested addi-
tional money in the business, and it distributed some of its profit to stock-
holders. The third section of the cash flow statement summarizes these
financing activities of the business over the period.
The managers did not have to go outside the business for the $1,515,000 cash
increase generated from its operating activities for the year. Cash flow from
operating activities is an internal source of money generated by the business
itself, in contrast to external money that the business raises from lenders and
owners. A business does not have to go hat in hand for external money when
its internal cash flow is sufficient to provide for its growth. Making profit is
the cash flow spigot that should always be turned on.
132
Part II: Figuring Out Financial Statements 

I should mention that a business that earns a profit could, nevertheless, have
a negative cash flow from operating activities — meaning that despite posting
a net income for the period, the changes in the company’s assets and liabili-
ties cause its cash balance to decrease. In reverse, a business could report a
bottom-line loss for the year, yet it could have a positive cash flow from its
operating activities. The cash recovery from depreciation plus the cash bene-
fits from decreases in its accounts receivable and inventory could be more
than the amount of loss. More realistically, a loss usually leads to negative
cash flow, or very little positive cash flow.
The term financing refers to a business raising capital from debt and equity
sources — by borrowing money from banks and other sources willing to loan
money to the business and by its owners putting additional money in the busi-
ness. The term also includes the flip side — that is, making payments on debt
and returning capital to owners. The term financing also includes cash distrib-
utions by the business from profit to its owners. By the way, keep in mind that
interest on debt is an expense that is reported in the income statement.
Most businesses borrow money for the short term (generally defined as less
than one year), as well as for longer terms (generally defined as more than
one year). In other words, a typical business has both short-term and long-
term debt. (Chapter 5 explains that short-term debt is presented in the cur-
rent liabilities section of the balance sheet.)
The business in our example has both short-term and long-term debt.
Although this is not a hard-and-fast rule, most cash flow statements report
just the net increase or decrease in short-term debt, not the total amounts
borrowed and total payments on short-term debt during the period. In con-
trast, both the total amounts of borrowing from and repayments on long-term
debt during the year are generally reported in the statement of cash flows —
the numbers are reported gross, instead of net.
In our example, no long-term debt was paid down during the year, but short-
term debt was paid off during the year and replaced with new short-term
notes payable. However, only the $100,000 net increase is reported in the
cash flow statement. The business also increased its long-term debt $150,000
(refer to Figure 6-1 or 6-2).
The financing section of the cash flow statement also reports the flow of cash
between the business and its owners (stockholders of a corporation). Owners
can be both a source of a business’s cash (capital invested by owners) and a
use of a business’s cash (profit distributed to owners). The financing activities
section of the cash flow statement reports additional capital raised from its
owners, if any, as well as any capital returned to the owners. In the cash flow
statement, note that the business issued additional stock shares for $150,000
during the year, and it paid a total of $750,000 cash dividends from profit to its
owners.
133
Chapter 6: Reporting Cash Flows

Speaking of cash dividends from profit to shareowners, you might note that
in the executive summary to the president I deduct the $750,000 cash divi-
dends directly from the $1,515,000 cash flow from profit for the year, which
leaves $765,000 for other business purposes. Personally, I think it makes
better sense to “match up” the cash flow from profit (operating activities)
and how much of this amount was distributed to the owners. In my view this
is a natural comparison to make. However, the official financial reporting
standard says that cash distributions from profit should be put in the financ-
ing activities section of the statement of cash flows, as you see in Figures 6-1
and 6-2. For further discussion on this point see the last section in the chap-
ter, “Being an Active Reader.”
Trying to Pin Down “Free Cash Flow”
A term has emerged in the lexicon of finance: free cash flow. This piece of lan-
guage is not — I repeat, not — an officially defined term by any authoritative
accounting rule-making body. Furthermore, the term does not appear in cash
flow statements reported by businesses. Rather, free cash flow is street lan-
guage, and the term appears in The Wall Street Journal and The New York
Times. Securities brokers and investment analysts use the term freely (pun
intended). Unfortunately, the term free cash flow hasn’t settled down into one
universal meaning, although most usages of the term have something to do
with cash flow from operating activities.
The term free cash flow has been used to mean the following:
 Net income plus depreciation expense, plus any other expense recorded
during the period that does not involve the outlay of cash — such as
amortization of costs of the intangible assets of a business, and other
asset write-downs that don’t require cash outlay
 Cash flow from operating activities as reported in the statement of cash
flows, although the very use of a different term (free cash flow) suggests
a different meaning is intended
 Cash flow from operating activities minus the amount spent on capital
expenditures during the year (purchases or construction of property,
plant, and equipment)
 Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) —
although this definition ignores the cash flow effects of changes in the
short-term assets and liabilities directly involved in sales and expenses,
and it obviously ignores that most of interest and income tax expenses
are paid in cash during the period
134
Part II: Figuring Out Financial Statements 

In the strongest possible terms, I advise you to be very clear on which defini-
tion of free cash flow a speaker or writer is using. Unfortunately, you can’t
always determine what the term means even in context. Be careful out there.
One definition of free cash flow, in my view, is quite useful: cash flow from
operating activities minus capital expenditures for the year. The idea is that a
business needs to make capital expenditures in order to stay in business and
thrive. And to make capital expenditures, the business needs cash. Only after
paying for its capital expenditures does a business have “free” cash flow that
it can use as it likes. In the example in this chapter, the free cash flow accord-
ing to this definition is:
$1,515,000 cash flow from operating activities –
$1,275,000 capital expenditures = $240,000 free
cash flow
In many cases, cash flow from operating activities falls short of the money
needed for capital expenditures. To close the gap a business has to borrow
more money, persuade its owners to invest more money in the business, or
dip into its cash reserve. Should a business in this situation distribute any 
of its profit to owners? After all, it has a cash deficit after paying for capital
expenditures. But, in fact, many businesses make cash distributions from
profit to their owners even when they don’t have any free cash flow (as I just
defined it).
Being an Active Reader
Your job is to ask questions (at least in your own mind) when reading a finan-
cial statement. You should be an active reader, not a ho-hum passive reader,
in reading the statement of cash flows. You should mull over certain ques-
tions to get full value out of the statement.
The statement of cash flows reveals what financial decisions the business’s
managers made during the period. Of course, management decisions are
always subject to second-guessing and criticizing, and passing judgment
based on reading a financial statement isn’t totally fair because it doesn’t cap-
ture the pressures the managers faced during the period. Maybe they made
the best possible decisions in the circumstances. Then again, maybe not.
One issue, in my mind, comes to the forefront in reading the company’s state-
ment of cash flows. The business in our example (see Figure 6-2) distributed
$750,000 cash from profit to its owners — a 44 percent payout ratio (which
equals the $750,000 distribution divided by its $1,690,000 net income). In ana-
lyzing whether the payout ratio is too high, too low, or just about right, you
need to look at the broader context of the business’s sources of and needs
for cash.
135
Chapter 6: Reporting Cash Flows

The company’s $1,515,000 cash flow from operating activities is enough to
cover the business’s $1,275,000 capital expenditures during the year and still
leave $240,000 available. The business increased its total debt $250,000.
Combined, these two cash sources provided $490,000 to the business. The
owners also kicked in another $150,000 during the year, for a grand total of
$640,000. Its cash balance did not increase this amount because the business
paid out $750,000 dividends from profit to its stockholders. So, its cash bal-
ance dropped $110,000.
If I were on the board of directors of this business, I certainly would ask the
chief executive why cash dividends to shareowners were not limited to
$240,000 in order to avoid the increase in debt and to avert having shareown-
ers invest additional money in the business. I would probably ask the chief
executive to justify the amount of capital expenditures as well. Being an old
auditor, I tend to ask tough questions and raise sensitive issues.
Would you like to hazard a guess regarding the average number of lines in the
cash flow statements of publicly owned corporations? Typically, their cash
flow statements have 30 to 40 or more lines of information by my reckoning.
So it takes quite a while to read the cash flow statement — more time than
the average investor probably has available. You know, each line of informa-
tion in a financial statement should be a useful and relevant piece of informa-
tion. In reading many statements of cash flows over the years, I have to
question why so many companies overload this financial statement with so
much technical information. One could even suspect, with some justification,
that many businesses deliberately obscure their statements of cash flows.

T
his chapter explains that the financial statements reported by a business
are just one version of its financial history and position. Different accoun-
tants and different managers for the business could have presented different
versions that would have told a different story. I take a no-holds-barred look
at how the income statement and balance sheet depend on which accounting
methods a business chooses and on whether the financial statements are
tweaked to make them look better (while staying within the boundaries of
accounting and financial reporting standards).
The amounts reported in the financial statements of a business are not
simply facts that depend only on good bookkeeping. Here’s why:
 A business has choices among different accounting methods for recording
the amounts of revenue and expenses.
 A business can make pessimistic or optimistic estimates and forecasts
when recording certain revenue and expenses.
 A business has some wiggle room in implementing its accounting methods,
especially regarding the precise timing of when to record sales and expenses.
 A business can engage in certain tactics at year-end to put a more favor-
able spin on its financial statements.

138
Part II: Figuring Out Financial Statements 
These are important points to understand when you read financial statements,
and I help you get a firm handle on them in this chapter.
Reading Statements with 
a Touch of Skepticism
Suppose that you have the opportunity and the ready cash to buy a going busi-
ness. The business I have in mind is the very one I use as the example in the pre-
vious three chapters in which I explain the income statement (Chapter 4), the
balance sheet (Chapter 5), and the statement of cash flows (Chapter 6). Of
course, you should consider many factors in deciding your offering price.
The company’s most recent financial statements would be your main source
of information in reaching a decision — not the only source, of course, but
the most important source for financial information about the business.
I’d recommend that you employ an independent CPA auditor to examine the
company’s recordkeeping and accounting system, to determine whether 
the accounts of the business are complete, accurate, and in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The CPA should also test
for possible fraud and any accounting shenanigans in the financial statements.
(I discuss accounting and financial reporting fraud in Chapter 15.) As the
potential buyer of the business you can’t be too careful. You don’t want the
seller of the business to play you for a sucker.
Recognizing a business’s bias
Some people put a great deal of faith in numbers: 2 + 2 = 4, and that’s the 
end of the story. When they see a dollar amount reported to the last digit in a
financial statement, they get the impression of exactitude and precision. But
accounting isn’t just a matter of adding up numbers. It’s not an exact science.
Some even argue that accounting is more art than science, although I wouldn’t
go that far (and I certainly wouldn’t trust any numbers that Picasso came up
with — would you?). Accounting involves a whole lot more subjective judg-
ments and arbitrary choices than most people think.
Only one set of financial statements is included in a business’s financial report:
one income statement, one balance sheet, and one statement of cash flows. A
business does not provide a second, alternative set of financial statements that
would have been generated if the business had used different accounting meth-
ods and if the business had not tweaked its financial statements. Therefore, you
see only one version of the financial performance and position of the business.
But behind the scenes the controller and managers know that the company’s
financial statements would have been different if different accounting methods

had been used to record sales revenue and expenses and if the business had
not engaged in certain end-of-period maneuvers to make its financial statements
look better. (My father-in-law, a retired businessman, calls these tricks of the
trade “fluffing the pillows.”)
Everyone having a financial stake in a business should understand and keep in
mind the bias or tilt of the financial statements they’re reading. Using a baseball
analogy, the version of financial statements in your hands may be in left field,
right field, or center field. All versions are in the ballpark of GAAP, which define
the playing field but don’t dictate that every business has to play straight down
the middle. In their financial reports, businesses don’t comment on whether
their financial statements as a whole are liberal, conservative, or somewhere in
between. However, a business does have to disclose in the footnotes to its state-
ments which accounting methods it uses. (See Chapter 12 for getting a financial
report ready for release.)
Contrasting aggressive and 
conservative numbers
As the potential buyer of a business, you have to decide on an offering price.
You have to decide what the business is worth. Generally speaking, the two
most important factors are the profit performance of the business (reported
in its income statement) and the composition of assets, liabilities, and owners’
equity of the business (reported in its balance sheet). For instance, how much
would you pay for a business that has never made a profit and whose liabilities
are more than its assets? There’s no simple formula for calculating the market
value for a business based on its profit performance and financial condition.
But, quite clearly, the profit performance and financial condition of a business
are dominant factors in setting its market value.
Figure 7-1 shows a comparison that you never see in real-life financial reports.
The Version A column in Figure 7-1 presents the income statement and balance
sheet reported by the business. The Version C column reveals an alternative
income statement for the year and an alternative balance sheet at year-end that
the business could have reported (but didn’t). I don’t present an alternative
statement of cash flows, for reasons I explain later in the chapter.
Assuming you’ve read Chapters 4 and 5, the account balances in the Version
A column should be familiar — these are the same numbers from the finan-
cial statements I explain in those chapters. The dollar amounts in the Version
C column are the amounts that could have been recorded using different
accounting methods.

Figure 7-1:
Two
versions of
financial
statements
for the
business.
140
Part II: Figuring Out Financial Statements 

The “A” in Version A stands for actual and aggressive. What I mean by aggres-
sive is that the business adopted accounting methods that maximize its
recorded profit, and it used certain techniques to make its year-end financial
condition look as positive as possible.
Some businesses go the opposite direction. They adopt conservative
accounting methods to record profit performance, and they wouldn’t think of
tinkering with their financial statements at the end of the year, even when
their profit performance falls short of expectations and their financial condi-
tion has some trouble spots. In Figure 7-1, the “C” in Version C stands for con-
servative and cautious.
Now, you may very well ask, “Where in the devil did you get the numbers for
Version C?” The dollar amounts in Version C are my best estimates of what
conservative and cautious numbers would be for this business — a company
that has been in business for several years, has made a profit most years, and
has not gone through bankruptcy.
Figuring Out Why Financial 
Statements Differ
Look at the third column on the right in Figure 7-1. These are the differences
between the two financial statement versions. In the balance sheet the differ-
ences are concentrated in assets; only one liability is different. In total, assets
are $1.55 million lower and liabilities are $65,000 higher. These differences are
the results of recording slightly lower amounts of sales revenue and signifi-
cantly higher amounts of expenses in the conservative Version C scenario.
Remember the following about revenue and expenses:
 Recording sales revenue increases an asset (or decreases a liability in
some cases).
 Recording an expense either decreases an asset or increases a liability.
Most of the balance sheet differences in Figure 7-1 are caused by higher amounts
of expenses in the Version C scenario. The cumulative amount of net income
recorded over the years by the business in the Version C scenario is $1,615,000
less than in Version A:
$1,550,000 smaller amount of assets + $65,000
higher amount of liabilities = $1,615,000 
less net income recorded over the years
141
Chapter 7: Choosing Accounting Methods: Different Strokes for Different Folks  

At the end of each year, the amount of annual net income is recorded in the
retained earnings owners’ equity account. As you can see in Figure 7-1, the
retained earnings balance in Version C is exactly $1,615,000 less than in
Version A. This is a sizable amount, to be sure. But keep in mind that it took
all the years of its existence to accumulate that $1,615,000 amount. The net
income difference for its latest year (2009) is responsible for only part of the
cumulative, total difference in retained earnings.
Sales revenue and every expense except interest are different between
Versions A and C. Net income in Version C is $340,000 (about 20 percent)
lower than in Version A.
Suppose that in putting a market value on the business, you use the earnings
multiple method. (For more information on the valuation of a small business,
see Small Business Financial Management Kit For Dummies, written by myself
and my son, Tage C. Tracy [Wiley]). Suppose you are willing to pay six times the
most recent annual profit of the business. (I certainly don’t mean to suggest that
six times earnings is a standard multiple for all small businesses.) In Version A,
you would offer $10.74 million for the business ($1.69 million net income × 6 =
$10.74 million). In Version C, you would offer only $8.1 million ($1.35 million net
income × 6 = $8.1 million). If the business had used more conservative account-
ing methods, you would offer $2.64 million less for the business!
The following sections briefly explain each of the differences in Figure 7-1, except
the retained earnings difference that I explain just above. I keep the explanations
relatively brief and to the point. The idea is to give you a basic taste of some of
the main reasons for the differences. Note: From here on, instead of referring to
Version A and Version C, I will call the two different situations Company A and
Company C. Remember that Company A uses aggressive accounting methods
that boost recorded profit, and Company C uses conservative accounting meth-
ods that dampen recorded profit.
Cash balance
Company A engaged in what is called window dressing, which I discuss in
Chapter 12. Company A held its books open for a few days after the close of
the fiscal year in order to record additional cash collections from its accounts
receivable. It’s as if the cash had been received on December 31, 2009, even
though the cash was not actually deposited in its checking account until the
first week in January 2010. Isn’t this cheating? Well, yes; it’s like telling a small
fib or a white lie.
The reason a business would do some window dressing is to improve the
cash balance in its ending balance sheet. A business knows that when its
creditors and shareowners read its ending balance sheet they pay particular
attention to how its cash balance stacks up against its liabilities. Also, keeping
the books open for a few days (only for cash collections of accounts receivable)
142
Part II: Figuring Out Financial Statements 

makes the company’s ending accounts receivable balance appear to be more
under control because the balance is a smaller percent of total sales for the
year. This gives the impression that the credit terms extended to customers
are under good management, and the ending balance of accounts receivable
is not too large (which would indicate that too many customers are late in
paying their amounts owed the business).
Accounts receivable balance
One reason the ending balance of accounts receivable is lower is explained in
the previous section: Company A did some window dressing. But there are
two other reasons as well:
 Company C waits a little longer to record sales made on credit than Com-
pany A, to be more certain that all aspects of delivering products and
the acceptance by customers are finalized and there is little chance of the
products being returned by the customers. This delay in recording sales
causes its accounts receivable balance to be slightly lower, because at
December 31, 2009 it had not yet recorded some credit sales that were
still in the process of final acceptance by the customers.
Businesses should be consistent from year to year regarding when they
record sales. For some businesses, the timing of recording sales revenue
is a major problem — especially when the final acceptance by the cus-
tomer depends on performance tests or other conditions that must be
satisfied. Some businesses engage in channel stuffing by forcing their
dealers or customers to take delivery of more products than they
ordered. A good rule to follow is to read the company’s footnote in its
financial statements that explains its revenue recognition method, and
see whether there is anything unusual about it. If the footnote is vague,
be careful — be very careful!
If products are returnable and the deal between the seller and buyer
does not satisfy normal conditions for a completed sale, the recording of
sales revenue should be postponed until the return privilege no longer
exists. For example, some products are sold on approval, which means
the customer takes the product and tries it out for a few days or longer
to see if the customer really wants it.
 Company C is stricter about writing off a customer’s past due balance as
uncollectible. After it has made a reasonable effort to collect the debt but
a customer still hasn’t sent a check, Company C writes off the balance as
a bad debts expense. It decreases the past due accounts receivable balance
to zero and records an expense of the same amount. Company A, in con-
trast, waits much longer to write off a customer’s past due amount. In the
long run Company A still has to write off a customer’s debt if it has been
outstanding too long — but it waits until the last minute to make the
write-off entry.
143
Chapter 7: Choosing Accounting Methods: Different Strokes for Different Folks  

Inventory and cost of goods sold expense
The business in the example sells products, mainly to other businesses. A
business either manufactures the products its sells or purchases products for
resale to customers. (Chapter 11 explains the determination of product costs
for manufacturing businesses.) At this point it is not too important whether the
business manufactures or purchases the products it sells. What is important is
that the costs of its products have drifted upward over time because of inflation
and other factors. Therefore, the business has had to increase its sales prices to
keep up with the product cost increases.
There are two ways to deal with product cost inflation:
 Push the higher, most recent costs through to cost of goods sold
expense as soon as possible.
 Follow the chronological order of acquisition and let the older product
costs go out to cost of goods sold before the more recent product costs
are charged out to expense.
I explain these two methods in the later section “Calculating Cost of Goods
Sold and Cost of Inventory.”
Company A uses the method that minimizes cost of goods sold expense and
maximizes cost of ending inventory. Company C, in contrast, uses the method
that maximizes cost of goods sold expense and minimizes cost of ending inven-
tory. Note in Figure 7-1 that Company C’s ending inventory is $700,000 lower and
its cost of goods sold expense for the year is $280,000 higher. Over the years its
cost of goods sold expense has been charged with $700,000 that Company A has
not yet charged to the expense. Company C’s cost of goods sold expense in 2009
is $280,000 higher than Company A; the remainder of the $700,000 cumulative
difference in inventory cost is attributable to prior years.
Actually, not all of the cumulative $700,000 inventory difference and not all of
the $280,000 cost of goods sold difference in 2009 is due to the different inven-
tory and cost of goods sold expense methods used by the companies. Part of
each difference is due to how each company applies, and puts into practice,
the lower of cost or market (LCM) accounting rule. I explain this topic later in
the chapter; see the section “Recording Inventory Losses under the Lower of
Cost or Market (LCM) Rule.” Company C is tougher and stricter in implement-
ing the LCM procedure. It records higher amounts of inventory write-down at
the end of the year, which increases its cost of goods sold expense (or some
other expense account).

All accountants agree that the costs of long-term operating assets that have
limited useful lives to a business should be spread out over those predicted
useful lives instead of being charged off entirely to expense in the year of acqui-
sition. These long-lived operating assets are labeled property, plant and equip-
ment in Figure 7-1, and less formally are called fixed assets. (The cost of land
owned by a business is not depreciated because land is a property right that
has perpetual life.) The allocation of the cost of a fixed asset over its estimated
useful economic life to a business is called depreciation. The principle of depre-
ciation is beyond criticism, but the devil is in the details.
The original costs of fixed assets should theoretically include certain costs in
addition to their purchase or construction costs. However, in actual practice
these fringe costs are not always included in the original cost of fixed assets.
For example, it is theoretically correct to include installation costs of putting
into place and connecting electrical and other power sources of heavy machin-
ery and equipment. It is correct to include the cost of painting logos on the sides
of delivery trucks. The cost of an older building just bought by a business should
include the preparatory clean-up costs and the safety inspection cost. But, as I
say, in practice a business may not include such additional costs in the original
costs of its fixed assets.
Company A does include most of these additional costs in the original costs
of its fixed assets, which means that the cost balances of its fixed assets are
higher. These additional costs are not expensed immediately but are included
in the total amount to be depreciated over future years. Also, Company A uses
what is called straight-line depreciation, which spreads out the cost of a fixed
asset evenly over the years of its useful life to the business.
In contrast, Company C does not include any costs other than purchase or
construction costs in its fixed asset accounts, which means these additional
costs are charged to expense immediately and are not delayed to future years.
Also, and most importantly, Company C uses what is called accelerated depreci-
ation for allocating the cost of its fixed assets to expense. Higher amounts are
allocated to early years and smaller amounts to later years. Only the original
cost is allocated to expense over time, but there is a front-end loading on the
early years using accelerated depreciation.
I explain the straight-line and accelerated depreciation methods later in the
chapter (see the section “Appreciating Depreciation Methods”). For now, note in
Figure 7-1 that the original cost of Company C’s property, plant, and equipment
is $225,000 smaller than Company A’s, and its accumulated depreciation balance
is $425,000 higher. The company’s depreciation expense is not disclosed as a
separate expense in the income statement shown in Figure 7-1. We can’t tell
145
Chapter 7: Choosing Accounting Methods: Different Strokes for Different Folks  

from the information in the income statement the amount of 2009 deprecia-
tion expense between the two companies. But Company C’s depreciation
expense for the year is higher because the business has been growing and
increasing its investments in new fixed assets.
Accrued expenses payable 
liability balance
Most products are sold with expressed or implied warranties and guarantees.
Even if good quality controls are in place, some products sold by a business
don’t perform up to promises, and the customers want the problems fixed. A
business should estimate the cost of these future obligations and record this
amount as an expense in the same period that the goods are sold (along with
the cost of goods sold expense, of course); it should not wait until customers
actually return products for repair or replacement. After being in business a
few years, a company can forecast with reasonable accuracy the percent of
products sold that will be returned for repair or replacement under the guar-
antees and warranties offered to its customers. However, brand new products
that have no track record may be a serious problem in this regard.
Company A does not make the effort to estimate future product warranty and
guaranty costs; it records these costs on a when-paid basis. It waits until it
actually incurs these costs to record an expense. The company has decided
that the understatement of its liabilities is not significant.
Company C, on the other hand, takes the high road and goes to the trouble to
estimate the amount of future costs for the products it has already sold.
Therefore, its accrued expenses payable liability account is $65,000 higher
than Company A’s. The difference of this particular expense for the year
between the two versions is a bit tricky to determine. (I won’t delve into
details here.) Furthermore, the $65,000 higher amount of the liability includes
accruals that a business records to recognize other unpaid expenses at the
end of the year.
A typical business at the end of the year has certain costs that will not be paid
until sometime in the future — costs that are an outgrowth of the current
year’s operating activities. For example, a business should accrue (calculate
and record) the amount it owes to its employees for vacation and sick pay. A
business may not have received its property tax bill yet, but it should estimate
the amount of tax to be assessed and record the proper portion of the annual
property tax to the current year. One expense accrual is easy to calculate: the
accumulated interest on notes payable that hasn’t been paid yet at the end of
the year. Calculating this amount is straightforward because the amount bor-
rowed and the interest rate are definite.
146

Wrapping things up
In Figure 7-1, you should note that the accounts payable liability is the same in
both versions. These short-term operating liabilities are definite amounts that
have definite due dates. There are no accounting choices or options in record-
ing accounts payable. Also in Figure 7-1, I keep the income tax payable the same
in both versions. If the business had used different accounting methods for
determining its annual taxable income, its annual income tax expense would
have been different, and the ending amount of its income tax payable liability
might be a little different. This point is not that important to go into here.
Figure 7-1 presents just one alternative scenario regarding how different
accounting methods cause differences in the financial statements of a com-
pany. The differences in Figure 7-1 are not unrealistic in my opinion. But to be
frank, my alternative numbers are no more than educated guesses. Businesses
keep only one set of books. Even a business itself doesn’t know how different
its financial statements would be if it had used different accounting methods.
Financial report readers can read the footnotes to determine whether liberal
or conservative accounting methods are being used, but footnotes are not
easy to read. Plus, they don’t allow you to determine what profit would have
been and how the balance sheet amounts would be different if alternative
accounting methods had been used.
So, why don’t I include the statement of cash flows in the financial statements
comparison in Figure 7-1? Generally speaking, this financial statement, which
summarizes cash flows for the year, is the same no matter which accounting
methods are used by a business. Cash flows are recorded when cash is actu-
ally received or disbursed; cash flow entries don’t depend on which accrual-
based accounting methods are used. However, a business may engage in window
dressing at the end of the year (see the earlier section “Cash balance”). In this sit-
uation, the cash flow from operating activities is higher because the business has
recorded cash flows that actually did not take place until after the end of its
accounting year.
If you own or manage a business, I strongly encourage you to get involved in
deciding which accounting methods to use for measuring your profit and how
these methods are actually implemented. Chapter 16 explains that a manager
has to answer questions about his or her financial reports on many occasions,
so you should know which accounting methods are used to prepare the finan-
cial statements. However, “get involved” does not mean manipulating the
amounts of sales revenue and expenses recorded in the year — to make profit
look higher, to smooth fluctuations in profit from year to year, or to improve
the amounts of assets and liabilities reported in your ending balance sheet.
You shouldn’t even consider doing these things. (Of course these manipula-
tions go on in the real world. Some people also drive under the influence, but
that doesn’t mean you should.)

Chapter 7: Choosing Accounting Methods: Different Strokes for Different Folks  

Calculating Cost of Goods Sold 
and Cost of Inventory
One main accounting decision that must be made by companies that sell
products is which method to use for recording the cost of goods sold expense,
which is the sum of the costs of the products sold to customers during the
period. You deduct cost of goods sold from sales revenue to determine gross
margin — the first profit line on the income statement (refer to Figure 7-1). Cost
of goods sold is a very important figure, because if gross margin is wrong,
bottom-line profit (net income) is wrong.
A business acquires products either by buying them (retailers and distribu-
tors) or by producing them (manufacturers). Chapter 11 explains how manu-
facturers determine product cost; for retailers, product cost is simply purchase
cost. (Well, it’s not entirely this simple, but you get the point.) Product cost is
entered in the inventory asset account and is held there until the products are
sold.
When a product is sold, but not before, the product cost is taken out of inven-
tory and recorded in the cost of goods sold expense account. You must be
absolutely clear on this point. Suppose that you clear $700 from your salary
for the week and deposit this amount in your checking account. The money
stays in your bank account and is an asset until you spend it. You don’t have
an expense until you write a check.
Likewise, not until the business sells products does it have a cost of goods
sold expense. When you write a check, you know how much it’s for — you
have no doubt about the amount of the expense. But when a business with-
draws products from its inventory and records cost of goods sold expense,
the expense amount is in some doubt. The amount of expense depends on
which accounting method the business selects.
A business can choose between two opposite methods to record its cost of
goods sold and the cost balance that remains in its inventory asset account:
 The first-in, first-out (FIFO) cost sequence
 The last-in, first-out (LIFO) cost sequence
Other methods are acceptable, but these two are the primary options. Caution:
Product costs are entered in the inventory asset account in the order acquired,
but they are not necessarily taken out of the inventory asset account in this
order. The different methods refer to the order in which product costs are taken
out of the inventory asset account. You may think that only one method is
appropriate — that the sequence in should be the sequence out. However,
generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) permit alternative methods.
148
Part II: Figuring Out Financial Statements 

The choice between the FIFO and LIFO accounting methods does not depend
on the actual physical flow of products. Generally speaking, products are
delivered to customers in the order the business bought or manufactured the
products — one reason being that a business does not want to keep products
in inventory too long because the products might deteriorate or show their
age. So, products generally move in and move out of inventory in a first-in,
first-out sequence. Nevertheless, a business may choose the last-in, first-out
accounting method.
The FIFO (first-in, first-out) method
With the FIFO method, you charge out product costs to cost of goods sold
expense in the chronological order in which you acquired the goods. The pro-
cedure is that simple. It’s like the first people in line to see a movie get in the
theater first. The ticket-taker collects the tickets in the order in which they
were bought.
Suppose that you acquire four units of a product during a period, one unit at
a time, with unit costs as follows (in the order in which you acquire the
items): $100, $102, $104, and $106. By the end of the period, you have sold
three of these units. Using FIFO, you calculate the cost of goods sold expense
as follows:
$100 + $102 + $104 = $306
In short, you use the first three units to calculate cost of goods sold expense.
The cost of the ending inventory asset, then, is $106, which is the cost of the
most recent acquisition. The $412 total cost of the four units is divided between
$306 cost of goods sold expense for the three units sold and the $106 cost of the
one unit in ending inventory. The total cost has been accounted for; nothing has
fallen between the cracks.
FIFO works well for two reasons:
 Products generally move into and out of inventory in a first-in, first-out
sequence: The earlier acquired products are delivered to customers
before the later acquired products are delivered, so the most recently
purchased products are the ones still in ending inventory to be delivered
in the future. Using FIFO, the inventory asset reported in the balance
sheet at the end of the period reflects recent purchase (or manufacturing)
costs, which means the balance in the asset is close to the current
replacement costs of the products.
149
Chapter 7: Choosing Accounting Methods: Different Strokes for Different Folks  

 When product costs are steadily increasing, many (but not all) busi-
nesses follow a first-in, first-out sales price strategy and hold off raising
sales prices as long as possible. They delay raising sales prices until
they have sold their lower-cost products. Only when they start selling
from the next batch of products, acquired at a higher cost, do they raise
sales prices. I favor using the FIFO cost of goods sold expense method
when a business follows this basic sales pricing policy, because both the
expense and the sales revenue are better matched for determining gross
margin. I realize that sales pricing is complex and may not follow such a
simple process, but the main point is that many businesses use a FIFO-
based sales pricing approach. If your business is one of them, I urge you
to use the FIFO expense method to be consistent with your sales pricing.
The LIFO (last-in, first-out) method
Remember the movie ticket-taker I mentioned earlier? Think about that ticket-
taker going to the back of the line of people waiting to get into the next showing
and letting them in first. The later you bought your ticket, the sooner you get
into the theater. This is the LIFO method, which stands for last-in, first-out. The
people in the front of a movie line wouldn’t stand for it, of course, but the LIFO
method is acceptable for determining the cost of goods sold expense for prod-
ucts sold during the period.
The main feature of the LIFO method is that it selects the last item you pur-
chased first, and then works backward until you have the total cost for the
total number of units sold during the period. What about the ending inven-
tory — the products you haven’t sold by the end of the year? Using the LIFO
method, the earliest cost remains in the inventory asset account (unless all
products are sold and the business has nothing in inventory).
Using the same example from the preceding section, assume that the busi-
ness uses the LIFO method instead of FIFO. The four units, in order of acquisi-
tion, had costs of $100, $102, $104, and $106. If you sell three units during the
period, the LIFO method calculates the cost of goods sold expense as follows:
$106 + $104 + $102 = $312
The ending inventory cost of the one unit not sold is $100, which is the oldest
cost. The $412 total cost of the four units acquired less the $312 cost of goods
sold expense leaves $100 in the inventory asset account. Determining which
units you actually delivered to customers is irrelevant; when you use the LIFO
method, you always count backward from the last unit you acquired.
150
Part II: Figuring Out Financial Statements 

The two main arguments in favor of the LIFO method are these:
 Assigning the most recent costs of products purchased to the cost of goods
sold expense makes sense because you have to replace your products to
stay in business, and the most recent costs are closest to the amount you
will have to pay to replace your products. Ideally, you should base your
sales prices not on original cost but on the cost of replacing the units sold.
 During times of rising costs, the most recent purchase cost maximizes
the cost of goods sold expense deduction for determining taxable income,
and thus minimizes income tax. In fact, LIFO was invented for income tax
purposes. True, the cost of inventory on the ending balance sheet is lower
than recent acquisition costs, but the taxable income effect is more impor-
tant than the balance sheet effect.
But here are the reasons why LIFO is problematic:
 Unless you are able to base sales prices on the most recent purchase costs
or you raise sales prices as soon as replacement costs increase — and
most businesses would have trouble doing this — using LIFO depresses
your gross margin and, therefore, your bottom-line net income.
 The LIFO method can result in an ending inventory cost value that’s seri-
ously out of date, especially if the business sells products that have very
long lives. For instance, for several years, Caterpillar’s LIFO-based inven-
tory has been about $2 billion less than what it would have been under
the FIFO method.
 Unscrupulous managers can use the LIFO method to manipulate their
profit figures if business isn’t going well. They deliberately let their inven-
tory drop to abnormally low levels, with the result that old, lower product
costs are taken out of inventory to record cost of goods sold expense.
This gives a one-time boost to gross margin. These “LIFO liquidation
gains” — if sizable in amount compared with the normal gross profit
margin that would have been recorded using current costs — have to be
disclosed in the footnotes to the company’s financial statements. (Dipping
into old layers of LIFO-based inventory cost is necessary when a business
phases out obsolete products; the business has no choice but to reach
back into the earliest cost layers for these products. The sales prices of
products being phased out usually are set low, to move the products out
of inventory, so gross margin is not abnormally high for these products.)
If you sell products that have long lives and for which your product costs rise
steadily over the years, using the LIFO method has a serious impact on the
ending inventory cost value reported on the balance sheet and can cause the
balance sheet to look misleading. Over time, the current cost of replacing
products becomes further and further removed from the LIFO-based inventory
costs. Your 2009 balance sheet may very well include products with 1999, 1989,
or 1979 costs. As a matter of fact, the product costs reported for inventory
could go back even further.
151
Chapter 7: Choosing Accounting Methods: Different Strokes for Different Folks  

Note: A business must disclose in a footnote with its financial statements the
difference between its LIFO-based inventory cost value and its inventory cost
value according to FIFO. However, not too many people outside of stock ana-
lysts and professional investment managers read footnotes very closely.
Business managers get involved in reviewing footnotes in the final steps of
getting annual financial reports ready for release (refer to Chapter 12). If your
business uses FIFO, ending inventory is stated at recent acquisition costs,
and you do not have to determine what the LIFO value would have been.
Many products and raw materials have very short lives; they’re regularly
replaced by new models (you know, with those “New and Improved!” labels)
because of the latest technology or marketing wisdom. These products aren’t
around long enough to develop a wide gap between LIFO and FIFO, so the
accounting choice between the two methods doesn’t make as much differ-
ence as with long-lived products.
The average cost method
If you were to make an exhaustive survey of businesses, you would find out
that some businesses use methods other than FIFO and LIFO to measure cost
of goods sold expense and inventory cost. Furthermore, you would discover
variations on how LIFO is implemented. I don’t have the space in this book to
explain all the methods. Instead, I’ll quickly mention a third basic method:
the average cost method.
Compared with the FIFO and LIFO methods, the average cost method seems
to offer the best of both worlds. The costs of many things in the business
world fluctuate, and business managers tend to focus on the average product
cost over a time period. Also, the averaging of product costs over a period of
time has a desirable smoothing effect that prevents cost of goods sold from
being overly dependent on wild swings of one or two acquisitions.
However, to many businesses, the compromise aspect of the average cost
accounting method is its worst feature. Businesses often want to go one way or
the other and avoid the middle ground. If they want to minimize taxable income,
LIFO gives the best effect during times of rising prices. Why go only halfway
with the average cost method? If the business wants its ending inventory to be
as near to current replacement costs as possible, FIFO is better than the average
cost method. Plus, recalculating averages every time product costs change,
even with computers, is a real pain in the posterior. But the average cost
method is an acceptable method under GAAP and for income tax purposes.
152
Part II: Figuring Out Financial Statements 

Recording Inventory Losses under the
Lower of Cost or Market (LCM) Rule
Acquiring and holding an inventory of products involves certain unavoidable
economic risks:
 Deterioration, damage, and theft risk: Some products are perishable or
otherwise deteriorate over time, which may be accelerated under certain
conditions that are not under the control of the business (such as the air
conditioning going on the blink). Most products are subject to damage
when they’re handled, stored, and moved (for example when the forklift
operator misses the slots in the pallet and punctures the container).
Products may be stolen (by employees and outsiders).
 Replacement cost risk: After you purchase or manufacture a product, its
replacement cost may drop permanently below the amount you paid
(which usually also affects the amount you can charge customers for the
products).
 Sales demand risk: Demand for a product may drop off permanently,
forcing you to sell the products below cost just to get rid of them.
Regardless of which method a business uses to record cost of goods sold and
inventory cost, it should apply the lower of cost or market (LCM) test to inven-
tory. A business should regularly inspect its inventory very carefully to deter-
mine loss due to theft, damage, and deterioration. And the business should go
through the LCM routine at least once a year, usually near or at year-end. The
process consists of comparing the cost of every product in inventory — mean-
ing the cost that’s recorded for each product in the inventory asset account
according to the FIFO or LIFO method (or whichever method the company
uses) — with two benchmark values:
 The product’s current replacement cost (how much the business would
pay to obtain the same product right now)
 The product’s net realizable value (how much the business can sell the
product for)
If a product’s cost on the books is higher than either of these two benchmark
values, an accounting entry is made to decrease product cost to the lower of
the two. In other words, inventory losses are recognized now rather than later,
when the products are sold. The drop in the replacement cost or sales value
of the product should be recorded now, on the theory that it’s better to take
your medicine now than to put it off. Also, the inventory cost value on the
balance sheet is more conservative because inventory is reported at a lower
cost value.
153
Chapter 7: Choosing Accounting Methods: Different Strokes for Different Folks  

Determining current replacement cost values for every product in your inven-
tory isn’t easy! When I worked for a CPA firm many years ago, we tested the
ways clients applied the LCM method to their ending inventories. I was surprised
by how hard it was to pin down current market values — vendors wouldn’t
quote current prices or had gone out of business, prices bounced around from
day to day, suppliers offered special promotions that confused matters, and
on and on. Applying the LCM test leaves much room for interpretation.
Some shady characters abuse LCM to cheat on their income tax returns. They
knock down their ending inventory cost value — decrease ending inventory
cost more than can be justified by the LCM test — to increase the deductible
expenses on their income tax returns and thus decrease taxable income. A
product may have proper cost value of $100, for example, but a shady charac-
ter may invent some reason to lower it to $75 and thus record a $25 inventory
write-down expense in this period for each unit — which is not justified. But,
even though the person can deduct more this year, he or she will have a lower
inventory cost to deduct in the future. Also, if the person is selected for an IRS
audit and the Feds discover an unjustified inventory knockdown, the person
may end up with a felony conviction for income tax evasion.
Appreciating Depreciation Methods
In theory, depreciation expense accounting is straightforward enough: You
divide the cost of a fixed asset (except land) among the number of years that
the business expects to use the asset. In other words, instead of having a huge
lump-sum expense in the year that you make the purchase, you charge a frac-
tion of the cost to expense for each year of the asset’s lifetime. Using this
method is much easier on your bottom line in the year of purchase, of course.
Theories are rarely as simple in real life as they are on paper, and this one is
no exception. Do you divide the cost evenly across the asset’s lifetime, or do
you charge more to certain years than others? Furthermore, when it eventu-
ally comes time to dispose of fixed assets, the assets may have some disposable,
or salvage, value. In theory, only cost minus the salvage value should be
depreciated. But in actual practice most companies ignore salvage value and
the total cost of a fixed asset is depreciated. Moreover, how do you estimate
how long an asset will last in the first place? Do you consult an accountant
psychic hot line?
As it turns out, the IRS runs its own little psychic business on the side, with a
crystal ball known as the Internal Revenue Code. Okay, so the IRS can’t tell
you that your truck is going to conk out in five years, seven months, and two
days. The Internal Revenue Code doesn’t give you predictions of how long
your fixed assets will last; it only tells you what kind of time line to use for
income tax purposes, as well as how to divide the cost along that time line.
154
Part II: Figuring Out Financial Statements 

Hundreds of books have been written on depreciation, but the book that really
counts is the Internal Revenue Code. Most businesses adopt the useful lives
allowed by the income tax law for their financial statement accounting; they
don’t go to the trouble of keeping a second depreciation schedule for finan-
cial reporting. Why complicate things if you don’t have to? Why keep one
depreciation schedule for income tax and a second for preparing your finan-
cial statements?
Note: The tax law can change at any time, and you can count on the tax law
to be extremely technical. The following discussion is meant only as a basic
introduction and certainly not as tax advice. The annual income tax guides,
such as Taxes For Dummies by Eric Tyson, Margaret Atkins Munro, and David J.
Silverman (Wiley), go into the more technical details of calculating depreciation.
The IRS rules offer two depreciation methods that can be used for particular
classes of assets. Buildings must be depreciated just one way, but for other
fixed assets you can take your pick:
 Straight-line depreciation: With this method, you divide the cost evenly
among the years of the asset’s estimated lifetime. Buildings have to be
depreciated this way. Assume that a building purchased by a business
cost $390,000, and its useful life — according to the tax law — is 39 years.
The depreciation expense is $10,000 (1/39 of the cost) for each of the 39
years. You may choose to use the straight-line method for other types of
assets. After you start using this method for a particular asset, you can’t
change your mind and switch to another depreciation method later.
 Accelerated depreciation: Actually, this term is a generic catchall for
several different kinds of methods. What they all have in common is that
they’re front-loading methods, meaning that you charge a larger amount
of depreciation expense in the early years and a smaller amount in the
later years. The term accelerated also refers to adopting useful lives that
are shorter than realistic estimates. (Very few automobiles are useless
after five years, for example, but they can be fully depreciated over five
years for income tax purposes.)
One popular accelerated method is the double-declining balance (DDB)
depreciation method. With this method, you calculate the straight-
line depreciation rate, and then you double that percentage. You apply
that doubled percentage to the declining balance over the course of 
the asset’s depreciation time line. After a certain number of years, you
switch back to the straight-line method to ensure that you depreciate
the full cost by the end of the predetermined number of years.
The salvage value of fixed assets (the estimated disposal values when the
assets are taken to the junkyard or sold off at the end of their useful lives) is
ignored in the calculation of depreciation for income tax. Put another way, if a
fixed asset is held to the end of its entire depreciation life, then its original
cost will be fully depreciated, and the fixed asset from that time forward will
155
Chapter 7: Choosing Accounting Methods: Different Strokes for Different Folks  

have a zero book value. (Recall that book value is equal to original cost minus
the balance in the accumulated depreciation account.)
Fully depreciated fixed assets are grouped with all other fixed assets in exter-
nal balance sheets. All these long-term resources of a business are reported
in one asset account called property, plant, and equipment (usually not “fixed
assets”). If all its fixed assets were fully depreciated, the balance sheet of a
company would look rather peculiar — the cost of its fixed assets would be
offset by its accumulated depreciation. Keep in mind that the cost of land (as
opposed to the structures on the land) is not depreciated. The original cost
of land stays on the books as long as the business owns the property.
The straight-line depreciation method has strong advantages: It’s easy to
understand, and it stabilizes the depreciation expense from year to year.
Nevertheless, many business managers and accountants favor an accelerated
depreciation method in order to minimize the size of the checks they have to
write to the IRS in the early years of using fixed assets. This lets the business
keep the cash, for the time being, instead of paying more income tax. Keep in
mind, however, that the depreciation expense in the annual income statement
is higher in the early years when you use an accelerated depreciation method,
and so bottom-line profit is lower. Many accountants and businesses like
accelerated depreciation because it paints a more conservative (a lower or
more moderate) picture of profit performance in the early years. Who knows?
Fixed assets may lose their economic usefulness to a business sooner than
expected. If this happens, using the accelerated depreciation method would
look very wise in hindsight.
Except for brand-new enterprises, a business typically has a mix of fixed
assets — some in their early years of depreciation, some in their middle
years, and some in their later years. So, the overall depreciation expense for
the year may not be that different than if the business had been using
straight-line depreciation for all its depreciable fixed assets. A business does
not have to disclose in its external financial report what its depreciation
expense would have been if it had been using an alternative method. Readers
of the financial statements cannot tell how much difference the choice of
accounting methods would have caused in depreciation expense that year.
Scanning the Expense Horizon
Recording sales revenue and other income can present some hairy account-
ing problems. As a matter of fact, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
(FASB) — the private sector authority that sets accounting and financial
reporting standards in the United States — ranks revenue recognition as a
major problem area. A good part of the reason for putting revenue recogni-
tion high on the list of accounting problems is that many high profile financial
accounting frauds have involved recording bogus sales revenue that had no
156
Part II: Figuring Out Financial Statements 

economic reality. Sales revenue accounting presents challenging problems in
some situations. But in my view, the accounting for many key expenses is
equally important. Frankly, it’s damn difficult to measure expenses on a year-
by-year basis.
I could write a book on expense accounting, which would have at least 20 or
30 major chapters. All I can do here is to call your attention to a few major
expense accounting issues.
 Asset impairment write-downs: Inventory shrinkage, bad debts, and
depreciation by their very nature are asset write-downs. Other asset
write-downs are required when an asset becomes impaired, which
means that it has lost some or all of its economic utility to the business
and has little or no disposable value. An asset write-down reduces the
book (recorded) value of an asset (and at the same time records an
expense or loss of the same amount). A write-off reduces the asset’s
book value to zero and removes it from the accounts, and the entire
amount becomes an expense.
 Employee-defined benefits pension plans and other post-retirement
benefits: The GAAP rule on this expense is extremely complex. Several
key estimates must be made by the business, including, for example, the
expected rate of return on the investment portfolio set aside for these
future obligations. This and other estimates affect the amount of
expense recorded. In some cases, a business uses an unrealistically high
rate of return in order to minimize the amount of this expense.
 Certain discretionary operating expenses: Many operating expenses
involve timing problems and/or serious estimation problems. Furthermore,
some expenses are very discretionary in nature, which means how much
to spend during the year depends almost entirely on the discretion of man-
agers. Managers can defer or accelerate these expenses in order to manip-
ulate the amount of expense recorded in the period. For this reason,
businesses filing financial reports with the SEC are required to disclose cer-
tain of these expenses, such as repairs and maintenance expense, and
advertising expense. (To find examples, go to the EDGAR database of the
Securities and Exchange Commission at www.sec.gov.)
 Income tax expense: A business can use different accounting methods
for some of the expenses reported in its income statement than it uses
for calculating its taxable income. Oh, boy! The hypothetical amount of
taxable income, as if the accounting methods used in the income state-
ment were used in the tax return, is calculated; then the income tax based
on this hypothetical taxable income is figured. This is the income tax
expense reported in the income statement. This amount is reconciled with
the actual amount of income tax owed based on the accounting methods
used for income tax purposes. A reconciliation of the two different income
tax amounts is provided in a technical footnote schedule to the financial
statements.

Chapter 7: Choosing Accounting Methods: Different Strokes for Different Folks  

 Management stock options: A stock option is a contract between an
executive and the business that gives the executive the option to pur-
chase a certain number of the corporation’s capital stock shares at a
fixed price (called the exercise or strike price) after certain conditions
are satisfied. Usually a stock option does not vest until the executive has
been with the business for a certain number of years. The question is
whether the granting of stock options should be recorded as an expense.
This issue had been simmering for some time. The Financial Accounting
Standards Board (FASB) finally issued a pronouncement that requires a
value measure be put on stock options when they are issued and that
this amount be recorded as an expense.
You could argue that management stock options are simply an arrange-
ment between the stockholders and the privileged few executives of the
business, by which the stockholders allow the executives to buy shares
at bargain prices. The granting of stock options does not reduce the
assets or increase the liabilities of the business, so you could argue that
stock options are not a direct expense of the business; instead, the cost
falls on the stockholders. Allowing executives to buy stock shares at
below-market prices increases the number of shares over which profit
has to be spread, thus decreasing earnings per share. Stockholders have
to decide whether they are willing to do this; the granting of manage-
ment stock options must be put to a vote by the stockholders.
In any case, the main problem today concerns how to put a value on
stock options at the time they are issued to executives. The FASB pro-
nouncement opened the door to alternative methods for calculating the
value of stock options. Guess what? More than one method is being used
by public businesses to measure the expense of management stock options.
This should not be a surprise to anyone. It will take some time for things to
settle down on the preferred way to measure the cost of management stock
options.
Please don’t think that the short list above does justice to all the expense
accounting problems of businesses. U.S. businesses — large and small, public
and private — operate in a highly developed and very sophisticated econ-
omy. One result is that expense accounting has become very complicated
and confusing.

Part II: Figuring Out Financial Statements 

Part III
Accounting in
Managing a
Business

In this part . . .
T
his part of the book, in short, explains how accounting
helps managers achieve the financial objectives of the
business.
To survive and thrive, a business faces three inescapable
financial imperatives: making adequate profit, turning its
profit into cash flow on a timely basis, and keeping its
financial condition in good shape. Its managers should
understand the financial statements of the business (see
Part II). In addition, business managers should take advan-
tage of time-tested accounting tools and techniques to
help them achieve the financial goals of the business.
To begin this part, Chapter 8 explains that business
founders must decide which legal structure to use.
Chapter 9 demonstrates that business managers need a
well-designed P&L (profit and loss) report for understand-
ing and analyzing profit — one that serves as the touch-
stone in making decisions regarding sales prices, costs,
marketing and procurement strategies, and so on.
Chapter 10 explains that budgeting, whether done on a
big-time or a small-scale basis, is a valuable technique for
planning and setting financial goals. Lastly, Chapter 11
examines the costs that managers work with day in and
day out. Managers may think they understand the cost 
figures they work with, but they may not appreciate the
problems in measuring costs.

T
he obvious reason for investing in a business rather than putting your
hard-earned money in a safer type of investment is the potential for greater
rewards. Note the word potential. As one of the partners or shareowners of a
business, you’re entitled to your fair share of the business’s profit — but at the
same time you’re subject to the risk that the business could go down the tubes,
taking your money with it.
Ignore the risks for a moment and look at just the rosy side of the picture:
Suppose the doohickeys that your business sells become the hottest products
of the year. Sales are booming, and you start looking at buying a five-bedroom
mansion with an ocean view. Don’t jump into that down payment just yet — you
may not get as big a piece of the sales revenue pie as you’re expecting. You may
not see any of profit after all the claims on sales revenue are satisfied. And even
if you do, the way the profit is divided among owners depends on the business’s
legal structure.
This chapter shows you how legal structure determines your share of the
profit — and how changes beyond your control can make your share less
valuable. It also explains how the legal structure determines whether the
business as a separate entity pays income taxes. (In one type of legal structure,
the business pays income taxes and its owners pay a second layer of income
taxes on the distributions of profit to them by the business. Uncle Sam gets
not one but two bites of the profit apple.)

Studying the Sources of Business Capital
Every business needs capital. Capital provides the money for the assets a
business needs to carry on its operations. Common examples of assets are
the working cash balance a business needs for day-to-day activities, products
held in inventory for sale, and long-life operating assets (buildings, machines,
computers, office equipment, and so on). One of the first questions that sources
of business capital ask is: How is the business entity organized legally? In other
words, which specific form or legal structure is being used by the business? The
different types of business legal entities present different risks and offer differ-
ent rewards to business capital sources.
Before examining the different types of business entities in detail, it’s useful
to look at the basic sources of business capital. In other words, where does a
business get capital? Regardless of the particular legal structure a business
uses, the answer comes down to two basic sources: debt and equity. Debt
refers to the money borrowed by a business, and equity refers to money
invested in the business by owners. Making profit also provides equity capi-
tal. No matter which type of business entity form that it uses, every business
needs a foundation of ownership (equity) capital to persuade people to loan
money to the business.
I might add that in starting a new business from scratch, its founders typi-
cally must invest a lot of sweat equity, which refers to the grueling effort and
long hours to get the business off the ground and up and running. The
founders don’t get paid for their sweat equity, and it does not show up in the
accounting records of the business. You don’t find the personal investment of
time and effort for sweat equity in a balance sheet.
Deciding on debt
Suppose a business has $10 million in total assets. (You find assets in the bal-
ance sheet of a business — see Chapter 5.) How much of the $10 million
should be supplied by debt capital? As you probably know, there’s no simple
answer to such a question. Some businesses depend on debt capital for more
than half of the money needed for their assets. In contrast, some businesses
have virtually no debt at all. You find many examples of both public and pri-
vate companies that have no borrowed money. But as a general rule, busi-
nesses carry some debt (and therefore have interest expense).
The debt decision is not really an accounting responsibility. Deciding on debt
is the responsibility of the chief financial officer and chief executive of the
business. In modest-sized and smaller businesses, the chief accounting officer
(controller) may also serve as the chief financial officer. In larger-sized busi-
nesses, two different persons hold the top financial and accounting positions.
162
Part III: Accounting in Managing a Business 

Most businesses borrow money because their owners are not able or not will-
ing to supply all the capital needed for its assets. As you know, banks are one
major source of loans to businesses. Of course, banks charge interest on the
loans; a business and its bank negotiate an interest rate acceptable to both.
Many other terms and conditions are negotiated, including the term (time
period) of the loan and whether collateral is required. The loan contract between
a business and its lender may prohibit the business from distributing profit
to owners during the period of the loan. Or, the loan agreement may require that
the business maintain a minimum cash balance. Generally speaking, the
higher the ratio of debt to equity, the more likely a lender will charge higher
interest rates and will insist on tougher conditions, because the lender has
higher risk that the business might default on the loan.
The president or other appropriate financial officer of the business signs the
note payable to the bank. In addition, the bank (or other lender) may ask the
major investors in a smaller, privately owned business to sign the note
payable as individuals, in their personal capacities — and it may ask their
spouses to sign the note payable as well. You should definitely understand
your personal obligations if you are inclined to sign a note payable of a busi-
ness. You take the risk that you may have to pay some part or perhaps the
entire amount of the loan from your personal assets.
Tapping two sources of owners’ equity
The rights and risks of a business’s owners are completely different than
those of its debtholders. Whether you’re a budding entrepreneur about to
start up a new business venture or a seasoned business investor, you’d
better understand the fundamental differences between the debtholders and
shareowners of a business. Every business — regardless of how big it is and
whether it’s publicly or privately owned — has owners; no business can get
all the capital it needs just by borrowing. Every business needs a continuing
base of ownership (equity) capital.
Here’s what business owners do:
 Invest money in the business when it originally raises capital from indi-
viduals or institutions (for instance, when IBM issued shares of stock to
persons who invested money in the company when it started up many
years ago, or when three friends formed a partnership last year to start
up Joe’s Bar & Grill).
 Expect the business to earn profit on their equity capital in the business
and expect to share in that profit by receiving cash distributions from
profit and by benefiting from increases in the value of their ownership
shares — with no guarantee of either.
163
Chapter 8: Deciding the Legal Structure for a Business 

 Directly participate in the management of the business or hire others to
manage the business. In smaller businesses, an owner may be one of the
managers and may sit on the board of directors, but in very large busi-
nesses you are just one of thousands of owners who elect a representative
board of directors to oversee the managers of the business and to protect
the interests of the owners.
 Receive a proportionate share of the proceeds if the business is sold, or
receive a proportionate share of ownership when another business buys
or merges with the business, or end up with nothing in the event the
business goes kaput and there’s nothing left over after paying off the
creditors of the business.
When owners invest money in a business, the accountant records the amount
of money as an increase in the company’s cash account. And, to keep things
in balance, the amount invested in the business is also recorded as an increase
in an owners’ equity account. Owners’ equity also increases when a business
makes profit. (See Chapters 4 and 7 for more on this subject.) Because of the
two different reasons for increases, and because of certain legal requirements
regarding minimum owners’ capital amounts that have to be maintained by a
business for the protection of creditors, the owners’ equity of a business is
divided into two separate types of accounts:
 Invested capital: This type of owners’ equity account records the
amounts of money that owners have invested in the business, which
could have been many years ago. Owners may invest additional capital
from time to time, but generally speaking they cannot be forced to put
additional money in a business (unless the business issues assessable
ownership shares, which is unusual). Note: A business may keep two or
more accounts for invested capital from its owners.
 Retained earnings: The profit earned by a business over the years that
has been retained and not distributed to its owners is accumulated in
this account. If all profit had been distributed every year, retained earn-
ings would have a zero balance. (If a business has never made a profit,
its accumulated loss would cause retained earnings to have a negative
balance, which generally is called a deficit.) If none of the annual profits
of a business had been distributed to its owners, the balance in retained
earnings would be the cumulative profit earned by the business since it
opened its doors (net of any losses along the way).
Whether to retain part or all of annual net income is one of the most important
decisions that a business makes; distributions from profit have to be decided
at the highest level of a business. A growing business needs additional capital
for expanding its assets, and increasing the debt load of the business usually
cannot supply all the additional capital. So, the business plows back some of its
profit for the year rather than giving it out to the owners. In the long run this
may be the best course of action because it provides additional capital for
growth.
164
Part III: Accounting in Managing a Business 

Recognizing the Legal Roots 
of Business Entities
One of the most important aspects of our legal system, from the business and
economic point of view, is that the law enables entities to be created for con-
ducting business activities. These entities are separate and distinct from the
individual owners of the business. Business entities have many of the rights
of individuals. Business entities can own property and enter into contracts,
for example. In starting a business venture, one of the first things the founders
have to do is select which type of legal structure to use — which usually
requires the services of a lawyer who knows the laws of the state in which the
business is organized.
A business may have just one owner, or two or more owners. A one-owner busi-
ness may choose to operate as a sole proprietorship; a multi-owner business
must choose to be a corporation, a partnership, or a limited liability company.
The most common type of business is a corporation (although the number of
sole proprietorships would be larger if you count part-time, self-employed per-
sons in this category).
No legal structure is inherently better than another; which one is right for a
particular business is something that the business’s managers and owners
need to decide at the time of starting the business. The advice of a lawyer is
usually needed. The following discussion focuses on the basic types of legal
entities that owners can use for their business. Later, the chapter explains
how the legal structure determines the income tax paid by the business and
its owners, which is always an important consideration.
Incorporating a Business
The law views a corporation as a real, live person. Like an adult, a corporation
is treated as a distinct and independent individual who has rights and
responsibilities. (A corporation can’t be sent to jail, but its officers can be put
in the slammer if they are convicted of using the corporate entity for carrying
out fraud.) A corporation’s “birth certificate” is the legal form that is filed
with the Secretary of State of the state in which the corporation is created
(incorporated). A corporation must have a legal name, of course, like an indi-
vidual. Some names cannot be used, such as the State Department of Motor
Vehicles; you need to consult a lawyer on this point.
165
Chapter 8: Deciding the Legal Structure for a Business 

Just as a child is separate from his or her parents, a corporation is separate
from its owners. The corporation is responsible for its own debts. The bank
can’t come after you if your neighbor defaults on his or her loan, and the
bank can’t come after you if the corporation you have invested money in
goes belly up. If a corporation doesn’t pay its debts, its creditors can seize
only the corporation’s assets, not the assets of the corporation’s owners.
(However, see the sidebar “Be careful what [and how] you sign.”)
This important legal distinction between the obligations of the business entity
and its individual owners is known as limited liability — that is, the limited
liability of the owners. Even if the owners have deep pockets, they have no
legal exposure for the unpaid debts of the corporation (unless they’ve used
the corporate shell to defraud creditors). So, when you invest money in a cor-
poration as an owner, you know that the most you can lose is the amount you
put in. You may lose every dollar you put in, but the corporation’s creditors
cannot reach through the corporate entity to grab your assets to pay off the
liabilities of the business. (But, to be prudent, you should check with your
lawyer on this issue — just to be sure.)
Issuing stock shares
When raising equity capital, a corporation issues ownership shares to persons
who invest money in the business. These ownership shares are documented by
stock certificates, which state the name of the owner and how many shares are
owned. The corporation has to keep a register of how many shares everyone
owns, of course. (An owner can be an individual, another corporation, or any
other legal entity.) Actually, many public corporations use an independent
agency to maintain their ownership records. In some situations stock shares
are issued in book entry form, which means you get a formal letter (not a fancy
engraved stock certificate) attesting to the fact that you own so many shares.
Your legal ownership is recorded in the official “books,” or stock registry of the
business.
166
Part III: Accounting in Managing a Business 
Be careful what (and how) you sign
If I sign a $10 million note payable to the bank as
“John A. Tracy, President of Best-Selling Books,
Inc.,” then only the business (Best-Selling
Books, Inc.) is liable for the debt. But if I also add
my personal signature, “John A. Tracy,” below
my signature as president of the business, the
bank can come after my personal assets in the
event that the business can’t pay the note
payable. A good friend of mine once did this; only
later did he learn of his legal exposure by sign-
ing as an individual. By signing a note payable as
an individual, you put your personal and family
assets at risk in the event the business is not able
to pay the loan.

The owners of a corporation are called stockholders because they own stock
shares issued by the corporation. The stock shares are negotiable, meaning
the owner can sell them at any time to anyone willing to buy them without
having to get the approval of the corporation or other stockholders. Publicly
owned corporations are those whose stock shares are traded in public mar-
kets, such as the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ. There is a ready
market for the buying and selling of the stock shares.
The stockholders of a private business have the right to sell their shares,
although they may enter into a binding agreement restricting this right. For
example, suppose you own 20,000 of the 100,000 stock shares issued by the busi-
ness. So, you have 20 percent of the voting power in the business (one share has
one vote). You may agree to offer your shares to the other shareowners before
offering the shares to someone else outside the present group of stockholders.
Or, you may agree to offer the business itself the right to buy back the shares. In
these ways, the continuing stockholders of the business control who owns the
stock shares of the business.
Offering different classes of stock shares
Before you invest in stock shares, you should ascertain whether the corpora-
tion has issued just one class of stock shares. A class is one group, or type, of
stock shares all having identical rights; every share is the same as every
other share. A corporation can issue two or more different classes of stock
shares. For example, a business may offer Class A and Class B stock shares,
where Class A stockholders are given the vote in elections for the board of
directors but Class B stockholders do not get a vote.
State laws generally are liberal when it comes to allowing corporations to issue
different classes of stock shares. A whimsical example is that holders of one
class of stock shares could get the best seats at the annual meetings of the
stockholders. But whimsy aside, differences between classes of stock shares
are very significant and affect the value of the shares of each class of stock.
Two classes of corporate stock shares are fundamentally different: common
stock and preferred stock. Here are two basic differences:
 Preferred stockholders are promised a certain amount of cash dividends
each year (note I said “promised,” not “guaranteed”), but the corpora-
tion makes no such promises to its common stockholders. Each year,
the board of directors must decide how much, if any, cash dividends to
distribute to its common stockholders.
 Common stockholders have the most risk. A business that ends up in
deep financial trouble is obligated to pay off its liabilities first, and then
its preferred stockholders. By the time the common stockholders get
their turn the business may have no money left to pay them.
167
Chapter 8: Deciding the Legal Structure for a Business 

Neither of these points makes common stock seem too attractive. But consider
the following points:
 Preferred stock shares usually are promised a fixed (limited) dividend
per year and typically don’t have a claim to any profit beyond the stated
amount of dividends. (Some corporations issue participating preferred
stock, which gives the preferred stockholders a contingent right to more
than just their basic amount of dividends. This topic is too technical to
explore further in this book.)
 Preferred stockholders generally don’t have voting rights, unless they don’t
receive dividends for one period or more. In other words, preferred stock
shareholders usually do not participate in electing the corporation’s board
of directors or vote on other critical issues facing the corporation.
The main advantages of common stock, therefore, are the ability to vote in
corporation elections and the unlimited upside potential: After a corporation’s
obligations to its preferred stock are satisfied, the rest of the profit it has
earned accrues to the benefit of its common stock.
Here are some important things to understand about common stock shares:
 Each stock share is equal to every other stock share in its class. This
way, ownership rights are standardized, and the main difference
between two stockholders is how many shares each owns.
 The only time a business must return stockholders’ capital to them is
when the majority of stockholders vote to liquidate the business (in part
or in total). Other than this, the business’s managers don’t have to worry
about losing the stockholders’ capital.
 A stockholder can sell his or her shares at any time, without the approval
of the other stockholders. However, as I mention earlier, the stockholders
of a privately owned business may agree to certain restrictions on this
right when they first became stockholders in the business.
 Stockholders can put themselves in key management positions, or they
may delegate the task of selecting top managers and officers to the board
of directors, which is a small group of persons selected by the stockholders
to set the business’s policies and represent stockholders’ interests.
Now don’t get the impression that if you buy 100 shares of IBM, you can
get yourself elected to its board of directors. On the other hand, if Warren
Buffett bought 100 million shares of IBM, he could very well get himself on
the board. The relative size of your ownership interest is key. If you put up
more than half the money in a business, you can put yourself on the board
and elect yourself president of the business. The stockholders who own
50 percent plus one share constitute the controlling group that decides
who goes on the board of directors.
168
Part III: Accounting in Managing a Business 

Note: The all-stocks-are-created-equal aspect of corporations is a practical and
simple way to divide ownership, but its inflexibility can be a hindrance, too.
Suppose the stockholders want to delegate to one individual extraordinary
power, or to give one person a share of profit out of proportion to his or her
stock ownership. The business can make special compensation arrangements
for key executives and ask a lawyer for advice on the best way to implement
the stockholders’ intentions. Nevertheless, state corporation laws require
that certain voting matters be settled by a majority vote of stockholders. If
enough stockholders oppose a certain arrangement, the other stockholders
may have to buy them out to gain a controlling interest in the business. (The
limited liability company legal structure permits more flexibility in these
matters. I talk about this type of legal structure later in the chapter; see 
the section “Considering Partnerships and Limited Liability Companies.”)
Determining the market value 
of stock shares
If you want to sell your stock shares, how much can you get for them?
There’s a world of difference between owning shares of a public corporation
and owning shares of a private corporation. Public means there is an active
market in the stock shares of the business; the shares are liquid. The shares
can be converted into cash in a flash by calling your stockbroker or going
online to sell them. You can check a daily financial newspaper — such as The
Wall Street Journal — for the current market prices of many large publicly
owned corporations. Or you can go to one of many Internet Web sites (such
as http://finance.yahoo.com) that provide current market prices. But
stock shares in privately owned businesses aren’t publicly traded, so how
can you determine the value of your shares in such a business?
Well, I don’t mean to sidestep the question, but stockholders of a private
business don’t worry about the market value of their shares — until they are
serious about selling their shares, or when something else happens that
demands putting a value on the shares. When you die, the executor of your
estate has to put a value on the shares you own (excuse me, the shares you
used to own) for estate tax purposes. If you divorce your spouse, a value is
needed for the stock shares you own, as part of the divorce settlement. When
the business itself is put up for sale, a value is put on the business; dividing
this value by the number of stock shares issued by the business gives the
value per share.
Other than during events like these, which require that a value be put on the
stock shares, the shareowners of a private business get along quite well without
knowing a definite value for their shares. This doesn’t mean they have no idea
regarding the value of their business and what their shares are worth. They read
169
Chapter 8: Deciding the Legal Structure for a Business 

the financial statements of their business, so they know its profit performance
and financial condition. In the backs of their minds they should have a rea-
sonably good estimate regarding how much a willing buyer might pay for the
business and the price they would sell their shares for. So even though they
don’t know the exact market value of their stock shares, they are not com-
pletely in the dark about that value.
My son, Tage C. Tracy, and I discuss the valuation of small businesses in our
book Small Business Financial Management Kit For Dummies (Wiley). Space does
not permit an extended discussion of business valuation methods here.
Generally speaking, the value of ownership shares in a private business depends
heavily on the recent profit performance and the current financial condition of
the business, as reported in its latest financial statements. The financial state-
ments may have to be trued up, as they say, to bring some of the historical cost
values in the balance sheet up to current replacement values.
Business valuation is highly dependent on the specific circumstances of each
business. The present owners may be very eager to sell out, and they may be
willing to accept a low price instead of taking the time to drive a better bar-
gain. The potential buyers of the business may see opportunities that the
present owners don’t see or aren’t willing to pursue. Even Warren Buffett,
who has a well-deserved reputation for knowing how to value a business,
admits that he’s made some real blunders along the way.
Keeping alert for dilution of share value
Watch out for developments that cause a dilution effect on the value of your
stock shares — that is, that cause each stock share to drop in value. Keep in
mind that sometimes the dilution effect may be the result of a good business
decision, so even though your share of the business has decreased in the
short term, the long-term profit performance of the business (and, therefore,
your investment) may benefit. But you need to watch for these developments
closely. The following situations cause a dilution effect:
 A business issues additional stock shares at the going market value but
doesn’t really need the additional capital — the business is in no better
profit-making position than it was before issuing the new stock shares.
For example, a business may issue new stock shares in order to let a
newly hired chief executive officer buy them. The immediate effect may
be a dilution in the value per share. Over the long term, however, the
new CEO may turn the business around and lead it to higher levels of
profit that increase the stock’s value (see the sidebar “The motivation
for management stock options”).
170
Part III: Accounting in Managing a Business 

 A business issues new stock shares at a discount below its stock shares’
current value. For example, the business may issue a new batch of stock
shares at a price lower than the current market value to employees who
take advantage of an employee stock-purchase plan. Selling stock shares
at a discount, by itself, has a dilution effect on the market value of the
shares. But in the grand scheme of things, the stock-purchase plan may
motivate its employees to achieve higher productivity levels, which can
lead to superior profit performance of the business.
Now here’s one for you: The main purpose of issuing additional stock shares
is to deliberately dilute the market value per share. For example, a publicly
owned corporation doubles its number of shares by issuing a two-for-one
stock split. Each shareholder gets one new share for each share presently
owned, without investing any additional money in the business. As you would
expect, the market value of the stock drops in half — which is exactly the
purpose of the split because the lower stock price is better for stock market
trading (according to conventional wisdom).
171
Chapter 8: Deciding the Legal Structure for a Business 
The motivation for management stock options
Management stock options are a prime exam-
ple of issuing stock shares at below-market
prices. (See Chapter 7, where I discuss
accounting for the expense of management
stock options.) Many publicly owned corpora-
tions grant their top-level executives stock
options in addition to their salaries and other
compensation benefits. A management stock
option gives a manager the legal right to buy a
certain number of shares at a fixed price start-
ing at some time in the future — assuming that
conditions of continued employment and other
requirements are satisfied. Usually the exercise
price (also called the strike price) of a manage-
ment stock option is set equal to or higher than
the market value of the stock shares at the time of
grant. So, giving a manager a stock option does
not produce any immediate gain to the manager.
If the market price of the stock shares rises above
the exercise price of the stock option sometime
in the future, the stock options become valuable;
indeed, many managers have become multimil-
lionaires from their stock options.
It may seem, therefore, that the management
stock options should have a negative impact on
the market price of the corporation’s stock
shares because the total value of the business
has to be divided over a larger number of stock
shares. On the other hand, the theory is that
the total value of the business is higher than it
would have been without the management stock
options because better managers were attracted
to the business or managers performed better
because of their options. The stockholders end
up better off than they would have been if no
stock options had been awarded to the man-
agers. Well, that’s the theory.

Recognizing conflicts between 
stockholders and managers
Stockholders (including managers who own stock shares in the business) are
primarily concerned with the profit performance of the business; the divi-
dends they receive and the value of their stock shares depend on it. Managers’
jobs depend on living up to the business’s profit goals. But while stockholders
and managers have the common goal of optimizing profit, they have certain
inherent conflict of interests:
 The more money that managers make in wages and benefits, the less
stockholders see in bottom-line net income. Stockholders obviously
want the best managers for the job, but they don’t want to pay any more
than they have to. In many corporations, top-level managers, for all
practical purposes, set their own salaries and compensation packages.
A public business corporation establishes a compensation committee
consisting of outside directors that sets the salaries, incentive bonuses,
and other forms of compensation of the top-level executives of the organi-
zation. An outside director is one who has no management position in the
business and who, therefore, should be more objective and should not be
beholden to the chief executive of the business. This is good in theory,
but it doesn’t work out all that well in practice — mainly because the top-
level executive of a large public business typically has the dominant voice
in selecting the persons to serve on its board of directors. Being a director
of a large public corporation is a prestigious position, to say nothing of
the annual fees that are fairly substantial at most corporations.
 The question of who should control the business — managers, who are
hired for their competence and are intimately familiar with the business, or
stockholders, who may have no experience relevant to running this business
but whose money makes the business tick — can be tough to answer.
In ideal situations, the two sides respect each other’s contributions to
the business and use this tension constructively. Of course, the real
world is far from ideal, and in some companies, managers control the
board of directors rather than the other way around.
As an investor, be aware of these issues and how they affect the return on
your investment in a business. If you don’t like the way your business is run,
you can sell your shares and invest your money elsewhere. (However, if the
business is privately owned, there may not be a ready market for its stock
shares, which puts you between a rock and a hard place.)

Considering Partnerships and 
Limited Liability Companies
Suppose you’re starting a new business with one or more other owners, but
you don’t want it to be a corporation. You can choose to create a partnership or
a limited liability company, which are the main alternatives to the corporate
form of business.
A partnership is also called a firm. You don’t see this term used to refer to a
corporation or limited liability company nearly as often as you do to a part-
nership. The term firm connotes an association of a group of individuals
working together in a business or professional practice.
173
Chapter 8: Deciding the Legal Structure for a Business 
Where profit goes in a corporation
Suppose that a private business earned $1.32 mil-
lion net income for the year just ended and has
issued 400,000 capital stock shares. Divide net
income by the number of shares, and you come
up with earnings per share of $3.30. Assume that
the business paid $400,000 cash dividends during
the year, or $1.00 per share. The retained earn-
ings account thus increased $2.30 per share
(earnings per share minus dividends per share).
Although stockholders don’t have the cash to
show for it, their investment is better off by $2.30
per share, which shows up in the balance sheet
as an increase in the retained earnings account.
They can hope that the business will use the cash
provided from profit to increase future profit,
which should lead to higher cash dividends.
Now, suppose the business is a public company
that is 1,000 times larger. It earned $1.32 billion
on its 400 million capital stock shares and dis-
tributed $400 million in cash dividends. You may
think that the market value should increase
$2.30 per share, because the business earned
this much per share that it retained in the busi-
ness and did not distribute to its shareholders.
Your thinking is quite logical: Profit is an
increase in the net assets of a business (assets
less liabilities, which is also called net worth).
The business is $2.30 per share “richer” at the
end of the year than it was at the start of the
year, due to the profit it earned and retained.
Yet it’s entirely possible that the market price of
the stock shares actually decreased during the
year. Market prices are governed by psycho-
logical, political, and economic factors that go
beyond the information in the financial reports
of a business. Financial statements are only one
of the information sources that stock investors
use in making their buy-and-sell decisions.
Chapters 13 and 17 explain how stock investors
use the information in financial reports.

Compared with the relatively rigid structure of corporations, the partnership
and limited liability company forms of legal entities allow the division of man-
agement authority, profit sharing, and ownership rights among the owners to
be very flexible. Here are the key features of these two legal structures:
 Partnerships: Partnerships avoid the double-taxation feature that
corporations are subject to (see “Choosing the Right Legal Structure for
Income Tax,” later in this chapter, for details). Partnerships also differ from
corporations with respect to owners’ liability. A partnership’s owners fall
into two categories:
• General partners are subject to unlimited liability. If a business
can’t pay its debts, its creditors can reach into general partners’
personal assets. General partners have the authority and responsi-
bility to manage the business. They are roughly equivalent to the
president and other high-level managers of a business corporation.
The general partners usually divide authority and responsibility
among themselves, and often they elect one member of their group
as the senior general partner or elect a small executive committee
to make major decisions.
• Limited partners escape the unlimited liability that the general
partners have hanging around their necks. Limited partners are
not responsible, as individuals, for the liabilities of the partnership
entity. These junior partners have ownership rights to the busi-
ness’s profit, but they don’t generally participate in the high-level
management of the business. A partnership must have one or more
general partners; not all partners can be limited partners.
Many large partnerships copy some of the management features of the
corporate form — for example, a senior partner who serves as chair of
the general partners’ executive committee acts in much the same way as
the chair of a corporation’s board of directors.
Generally, a partner can’t sell his or her interest to an outsider without
the consent of all the other partners. You can’t just buy your way into a
partnership; the other partners have to approve your joining the part-
nership. In contrast, you can buy stock shares and thereby become part
owner of a corporation without the approval of the other stockholders.
 Limited liability company (LLC): The LLC is a relatively new and
increasingly popular type of business creature. An LLC is like a corpora-
tion regarding limited liability, and it’s like a partnership regarding the
flexibility of dividing profit among the owners. An LLC can elect to be
treated like a partnership for income tax purposes.
An LLC’s key advantage is flexibility — especially regarding how profit
and management authority are determined. For example, an LLC permits
the founders of the business to put up, say, only 10 or 20 percent of the
money to start a business venture but to keep all management authority
in their hands. The other investors share in profit but not necessarily in
proportion to their invested capital.
174
Part III: Accounting in Managing a Business 

LLCs have a lot more flexibility than corporations, but this flexibility can
have a downside. The owners must enter into a very detailed agreement
that spells out the division of profit, the division of management authority
and responsibility, their rights to withdraw capital, and their responsibili-
ties to contribute new capital as needed. These schemes can get very
complicated and difficult to understand, and they may end up requiring a
lawyer to untangle them. If the legal structure of an LLC is too complicated
and too far off the beaten path, the business may have difficulty explaining
itself to a lender when applying for a loan, and it may have difficulty con-
vincing new shareholders to put capital into the business.
A partnership treats salaries paid to partners (at least to its general partners)
as distributions from profit. In other words, profit is determined before the
deduction of partners’ salaries. LLCs are more likely to treat salaries paid to
owner-managers as an expense (like a corporation). I should warn you that
the accounting for compensation and services provided by the owners in an
LLC and the partners in a partnership gets rather technical and is beyond the
scope of this book.
The partnership or LLC agreement specifies how to divide profit among the
owners. Whereas owners of a corporation receive a share of profit directly
proportional to the number of shares they own, a partnership or LLC does
not have to divide profit according to how much each owner invested.
175
Chapter 8: Deciding the Legal Structure for a Business 
Limiting liability: Professional 
corporations and LLPs
Professional partnerships — physicians, CPAs,
lawyers, and so on — may choose to become
professional corporations (PCs), which are a
special type of legal structure that state laws
offer to professionals who otherwise would
have to operate under the specter of unlimited
partnership liability. States also permit limited
liability partnerships (LLPs) for qualified profes-
sionals (such as doctors, lawyers, CPAs, and
dentists), in which all the partners have limited
liability.
These types of legal entities were created
mainly in reaction to very large damage awards
in malpractice lawsuits against partners during
recent times. The professionals pleaded for pro-
tection from the unlimited liability of the part-
nership form of organization, which they had
traditionally used. Until these new types of pro-
fessional legal entities came along, the code of
professional ethics of the various professions
required that practitioners operate as a part-
nership (or as sole practitioners).
Today, almost all professional associations are
organized as PCs or LLPs. They function very
much as partnerships do but without the unlim-
ited liability feature — which is like having the
best of both worlds.

Invested capital is only one of three factors that generally play into profit
allocation in partnerships and LLCs:
 Treasure: Owners may be rewarded according to how much of the
treasure — invested capital — they contributed. So if Jane invested twice
as much as Joe did, her cut of the profit may be twice as much as Joe’s.
 Time: Owners who invest more time in the business may receive more of
the profit. Some partners or owners, for example, may generate more
billable hours to clients than others, and the profit-sharing plan reflects
this disparity. Some partners or owners may work only part-time, so the
profit-sharing plan takes this factor into account.
 Talent: Regardless of capital and time, some partners bring more to the
business than others. Maybe they have better business contacts, or
they’re better rainmakers (they have a knack for making deals happen),
or they’re celebrities whose names alone are worth a special share of
the profit. Whatever it is that they do for the business, they contribute
much more to the business’s success than their capital or time suggests.
A partnership needs to maintain a separate capital (ownership) account for
each partner. The total profit of the entity is allocated into these capital
accounts, as spelled out in the partnership agreement. The agreement also
specifies how much money each partner can withdraw from his capital account.
For example, partners may be limited to withdrawing no more than 80 percent
of their anticipated share of profit for the coming year, or they may be allowed
to withdraw only a certain amount until they’ve built up their capital accounts.
Going It Alone: Sole Proprietorships
A sole proprietorship is, basically, the business arm of an individual who has
decided not to carry on his or her business activity as a separate legal entity
(as a corporation, partnership, or limited liability company). This is the
default when you don’t establish a legal entity.
This kind of business is not a separate entity; it’s like the front porch of a
house — attached to the house but a separate and distinct area. You may be a
sole proprietor of a business without knowing it! An individual may do house
repair work on a part-time basis or be a full-time barber who operates on his
own. Both are sole proprietorships. Anytime you regularly provide services
for a fee, sell things at a flea market, or engage in any business activity whose
primary purpose is to make profit, you are a sole proprietor. If you carry on
business activity to make profit or income, the IRS requires that you file a sep-
arate Schedule C “Profit or Loss From Business” with your annual individual
income tax return. Schedule C summarizes your income and expenses from
your sole proprietorship business.
176
Part III: Accounting in Managing a Business 

As the sole owner (proprietor), you have unlimited liability, meaning that if
your business can’t pay all its liabilities, the creditors to whom your business
owes money can come after your personal assets. Many part-time entrepre-
neurs may not know this or may put it out of their minds, but this is a big risk
to take. I have friends who are part-time business consultants and they oper-
ate their consulting businesses as sole proprietorships. If they are sued for
giving bad advice, all their personal assets are at risk — though they may be
able to buy malpractice insurance to cover these losses.
Obviously, a sole proprietorship has no other owners to prepare financial
statements for, but the proprietor should still prepare these statements to
know how his or her business is doing. Banks usually require financial state-
ments from sole proprietors who apply for loans.
One other piece of advice for sole proprietors: Although you don’t have to
separate invested capital from retained earnings like corporations do, you
should still keep these two separate accounts for owners’ equity — not only
for the purpose of tracking the business but for the benefit of any future
buyers of the business as well.
177
Chapter 8: Deciding the Legal Structure for a Business 
Sharing profit with customers: 
Business cooperatives
A business that shares its profit with its cus-
tomers? Nobody can be that generous. Actually,
one type of business entity does just that: A
cooperative pays its customers patronage div-
idends based on its profit for the year — each
customer receives a year-end refund based on
his or her purchases from the business over the
year. Imagine that.
Oh, did I mention that in a cooperative, the cus-
tomers are the owners? To shop in the coopera-
tive, a customer must invest a certain amount of
money in the business. (You knew there had to be
a catch somewhere!) I grew up in Iowa. You see
the silos of grain co-ops (cooperative associa-
tions) all over the state. They are owned by the
farmers who use the co-ops to store and deliver
their crops.
Business cooperatives deduct patronage divi-
dends in determining their taxable income for the
year. If the business returns all profit to customers
as patronage dividends, taxable income is zero.
But the owners have to list their patronage divi-
dends on their individual income tax returns for
the year (and the co-op reports these distribu-
tions to the IRS).

Choosing the Right Legal 
Structure for Income Tax
While deciding which type of legal structure is best for securing capital and
managing their business, owners should also consider the dreaded income
tax factor. They should know the key differences between the two alternative
kinds of business entities from the income tax point of view:
 Taxable-entity, C corporations: These corporations are subject to income
tax on their annual taxable income. Plus, their stockholders pay a second
income tax on cash dividends that the business distributes to them from
profit, making C corporations and their owners subject to double taxation.
The owners (stockholders) of a C corporation include in their individual
income tax returns the cash distributions from the after-tax profit paid to
them by the business.
 Pass-through entities — partnerships, S corporations, and LLCs: These
entities do not pay income tax on their annual taxable income; instead,
they pass through their taxable income to their owners, who pick up their
shares of the taxable income on their individual tax returns. Pass-through
entities still have to file tax returns with the IRS, even though they don’t
pay income tax on their taxable income. In their tax returns, they inform
the IRS how much taxable income is allocated to each owner, and they send
each owner a copy of this information to include with his or her individual
income tax return.
Most LLCs opt to be treated as pass-through entities for income tax purposes.
But an LCC can choose instead to be taxed as a C corporation and pay income
tax on its taxable income for the year, with its individual shareholders paying
a second tax on cash distributions of profit from the LLC. Why would an LCC
choose double taxation? Keep reading.
The following sections illustrate the differences between the two types of tax
entities for deciding on the legal structure for a business. In these examples, I
assume that the business uses the same accounting methods in preparing its
income statement that it uses for determining its taxable income — a generally
realistic assumption. (I readily admit, however, that there are many technical
exceptions to this general rule.) To keep this discussion simple, I consider just
the federal income tax, which is much larger than any state income tax that
may apply.
178
Part III: Accounting in Managing a Business 

C corporations
A corporation that cannot qualify as an S corporation (which I explain in the
next section) or that does not elect this alternative if it does qualify is
referred to as a C corporation in the tax law. A C corporation is subject to fed-
eral income tax based on its taxable income for the year, keeping in mind that
there are a host of special tax credits (offsets) that could reduce or even elim-
inate the amount of income tax a corporation has to pay. I probably don’t
need to remind you how complicated the federal income tax is.
Suppose a business is taxed as a C corporation. Its abbreviated income state-
ment for the year just ended is as follows (see Chapter 4 for more about
income statements):
Abbreviated Annual Income Statement for a C Corporation
Sales revenue
$26,000,000
Expenses, except income tax
(23,800,000)
Earnings before income tax
$2,200,000
Income tax
(748,000)
Net income
$1,452,000
Now, at this point I had to make a decision. One alternative was to refer to
income tax form numbers and to use the tax rates in effect at the time of writing
this chapter. The income tax form numbers have remained the same for many
years, but the rest of the tax law keeps changing. For instance, Congress shifts
tax rates every so often. Furthermore, tax rates are not flat; they’re progressive,
which means that the rates step up from one taxable income bracket to the next
higher bracket — for both businesses and individuals. As I have already alluded
to, there are many special deductions to determine taxable income, and there
are many special tax credits that offset the normal amount of income tax. (And I
haven’t even said anything about the increasingly serious problems caused by
the alternative minimum tax provision in the income tax law.)
Given the complexity and changing nature of the income tax law, in the fol-
lowing discussion I avoid going into details about income tax form numbers
and the income tax rates that I use to determine the income tax amounts in
each example. By the time you read this section, the tax rates probably will
have changed anyway. Let me assure you, however, that I use realistic income
tax numbers in the following discussion. (I didn’t just look out the window
and make up income tax amounts.)
Refer to the C corporation income statement example again. Based on its $2.2
million taxable income for the year, the business owes $748,000 income tax —
most of which should have been paid to the IRS before year-end. The income
179
Chapter 8: Deciding the Legal Structure for a Business 

tax is a big chunk of the business’s hard-earned profit before income tax. Finally,
don’t forget that net income means bottom-line profit after income tax expense.
Being a C corporation, the business pays $748,000 income tax on its profit
before tax, which leaves $1,452,000 net income after income tax. Suppose the
business distributes $500,000 of its after-tax profit to its stockholders as their
just rewards for investing capital in the business. The stockholders include
the cash dividends as income in their individual income tax returns.
Assuming that all the individual stockholders have to pay income tax on this
additional layer of income, as a group they would pay something in the neigh-
borhood of $75,000 income tax to Uncle Sam.
A business corporation is not legally required to distribute cash dividends,
even when it reports a profit and has good cash flow from its operating activi-
ties. But paying zero cash dividends may not go down well with all the stock-
holders. If you’ve persuaded your Aunt Hilda and Uncle Harry to invest some
of their money in your business, and if the business doesn’t pay any cash div-
idends, they may be very upset. The average large public corporation pays
out about 30 percent of its after-tax annual net income as cash dividends to
its stockholders. It’s difficult to say what privately owned corporations do
regarding dividends, since the information is not available to the public.
S corporations
A business that meets the following criteria (and certain other conditions)
can elect to be treated as an S corporation:
 It has issued only one class of stock.
 It has 100 or fewer people holding its stock shares.
 It has received approval for becoming an S corporation from all its 
stockholders.
Suppose that the business example I discuss in the previous section qualifies
and elects to be taxed as an S corporation. Its abbreviated income statement
for the year is as follows:
Abbreviated Annual Income Statement for an S Corporation
Sales revenue
$26,000,000
Expenses, except income tax
(23,800,000)
Earnings before income tax
$2,200,000
Income tax
                 0
Net income
$2,200,000
180
Part III: Accounting in Managing a Business 

An S corporation pays no income tax itself, as you see in this abbreviated
income statement. But it must allocate its $2.2 million taxable income among
its owners (stockholders) in proportion to the number of stock shares each
owner holds. If you own one-tenth of the total shares, you include $220,000 of
the business’s taxable income in your individual income tax return for the
year whether or not you receive any cash distribution from the profit of the 
S corporation. That probably pushes you into a high income tax rate bracket.
When its stockholders read the bottom line of this S corporation’s annual
income statement, it’s a good news/bad news thing. The good news is that
the business made $2.2 million net income and does not have to pay any cor-
porate income tax on this profit. The bad news is that the stockholders must
include their respective shares of the $2.2 million in their individual income
tax returns for the year. I can only speculate on the total amount of individual
income tax that would be paid by the stockholders as a group. But I would
hazard a guess that the amount would be $300,000 or more. An S corporation
could distribute cash dividends to its stockholders, to provide them the
money to pay the income tax on their shares of the company’s taxable
income that is passed through to them.
The main tax question concerns how to minimize the overall income tax burden
on the business entity and its stockholders. Should the business be an S cor-
poration (assuming it qualifies) and pass through its taxable income to its
stockholders, which generates taxable income to them? Or should the business
operate as a C corporation (which always is an option) and have its stock-
holders pay a second tax on dividends paid to them in addition to the income
tax paid by the business? Here’s another twist: In some cases, stockholders
may prefer that their S corporation not distribute any cash dividends. They
are willing to finance the growth of the business by paying income tax on the
taxable profits of the business, which relieves the business from paying income
tax. Many factors come into play in choosing between an S and C corporation.
There are no simple answers. I strongly advise you to consult a CPA or other
tax professional.
Partnerships and LLCs
The LLC type of business entity borrows some features from the corporate
form and some features from the partnership form. The LLC is neither fish
nor fowl; it’s an unusual blending of features that have worked well for many
business ventures. A business organized as an LLC has the option to be a
pass-through tax entity instead of paying income tax on its taxable income. A
partnership doesn’t have an option; it’s a pass-through tax entity by virtue of
being a partnership.
181
Chapter 8: Deciding the Legal Structure for a Business 

Following are the key income tax features of partnerships and LLCs:
 A partnership is a pass-through tax entity, just like an S corporation.
When two or more owners join together and invest money to start a
business and don’t incorporate and don’t form an LLC, the tax law treats
the business as a de facto partnership. Most partnerships are based on
written agreements among the owners, but even without a formal, writ-
ten agreement, a partnership exists in the eyes of the income tax law
(and in the eyes of the law in general).
 An LLC has the choice between being treated as a pass-through tax entity
and being treated as a taxable entity (like a C corporation). All you need to
do is check off a box in the business’s tax return to make the choice. (It’s
hard to believe that anything related to taxes and the IRS is as simple as
that!) Many businesses organize as LLCs because they want to be pass-
through tax entities (although the flexible structure of the LLC is also a
strong motive for choosing this type of legal organization).
The partners in a partnership and the shareholders of an LLC pick up their
shares of the business’s taxable income in the same manner as the stockholders
of an S corporation. They include their shares of the entity’s taxable income in
their individual income tax returns for the year. For example, suppose your
share of the annual profit as a partner, or as one of the LLC’s shareholders, is
$150,000. You include this amount in your personal income tax return.
Once more, I must mention that choosing the best legal structure for a business
is a complicated affair that goes beyond just the income tax factor. You need to
consider many other factors, such as the number of equity investors who will
be active managers in the business, state laws regarding business legal entities,
ease of transferring ownership shares, and so on. After you select a particular
legal structure, changing it later is not easy. Asking the advice of a qualified pro-
fessional is well worth the money and can prevent costly mistakes.
Sometimes the search for the ideal legal structure that minimizes income tax
and maximizes other benefits is like the search for the Holy Grail. Business
owners should not expect to find the perfect answer — they have to make
compromises and balance the advantages and disadvantages. In its external
financial reports, a business has to make clear which type of legal entity it is.
The type of entity is a very important factor to the lenders and other credi-
tors of the business, and to its owners of course.

Analyzing and Managing Profit
In This Chapter
 Recognizing the profit-making function of business managers
 Scoping the field of managerial accounting
 Centering on profit centers
 Understanding P&L reports
 Analyzing profit for fun and profit
A
s a manager, you get paid to make profit happen. That’s what separates
you from the employees at your business. Of course, you should be a
motivator, innovator, consensus builder, lobbyist, and maybe sometimes a
babysitter, too, but the hard-core purpose of your job is to make and improve
profit. No matter how much your staff loves you (or do they love those dough-
nuts you bring in every Monday?), if you don’t meet your profit goals, you’re
facing the unemployment line.
Competition in most industries is fierce, and you can never take profit perfor-
mance for granted. Changes take place all the time — changes initiated by
the business and changes from outside forces. Maybe a new superstore down
the street is causing your profit to fall off, and you figure that you’ll have a
huge sale to draw customers, complete with splashy ads on TV and Dimbo
the Clown in the store. Whoa, not so fast. First make sure that you can afford
to cut prices and spend money on advertising and still turn a profit. Maybe
price cuts and Dimbo’s balloon creations will keep your cash register singing,
but making sales does not guarantee that you make a profit. Profit is a two-
headed beast: Profit comes from making sales and controlling expenses.
This chapter focuses on the fundamental financial factors that drive profit —
what you could call the levers of profit. Business managers need a sure-handed
grip on these profit handles. Profit reports prepared for people outside the
business don’t disclose all the vital information that business managers need
to plan and control profit performance. A manager needs to thoroughly under-
stand external income statements and also needs to look deep into the bowels
of the business.

Helping Managers Do Their Jobs
As previous chapters explain, accounting serves critical functions in a busi-
ness. A business needs a dependable recordkeeping and bookkeeping system
for operating in a smooth and efficient manner. Strong internal accounting
controls are needed to minimize errors and fraud. A business must comply
with a myriad of tax laws, and it depends on its chief accountant (controller)
to make sure that all its tax returns are prepared on time and correctly. A
business prepares financial statements that must conform with established
accounting standards, which are reported on a regular basis to its creditors
and external shareowners. In addition, accounting should help managers in
their decision-making, control, and planning. This sub-field of accounting is
generally called managerial or management accounting.
This is the first of three chapters devoted to this branch of accounting. In this
chapter, I pay particular attention to the internal accounting report to managers
that provides essential feedback information needed for controlling current
profit performance, and which also serves as the platform for planning future
profit performance. I also explain how managers use accounting information for
analyzing how they make profit and why profit changes from one period to the
next. Chapter 10 concentrates on financial planning and budgeting, and Chapter
11 examines the methods and problems of determining product costs (generally
called cost accounting).
Designing and monitoring the accounting system, complying with tax laws, and
preparing external financial reports all put heavy demands on the time and
attention of the accounting department of a business. Even so, managers’ needs
for accounting information should not be given second-level priority. The chief
accountant (controller) has the responsibility of ensuring that the financial infor-
mation needs of managers are served with maximum usefulness. Ideally, a man-
ager tells the accountant exactly what information he needs and how to report
the information. In the real world, however, this is not exactly how it works. The
accountant has to more or less read the mind of the manager. Oftentimes the
accountant has to take the initiative regarding the information to report to man-
agers and how to report it.
Following the organizational structure
The first rule of managerial accounting is to follow the organizational struc-
ture: to report relevant information for which each manager is responsible.
(This principle is sometimes referred to as responsibility accounting.) If a man-
ager is in charge of sales in a territory, for instance, the controller reports the
sales activity for that territory during the period to the sales manager. Two
184
Part III: Accounting in Managing a Business 

types of organizational units in a business are of primary interest to managerial
accountants:
 Profit centers: These are separate, identifiable sources of sales revenue
that expenses can be matched with, so that a measure of profit can be
determined for each. A profit center can be a particular product or 
a product line, a particular location or territory in which a wide range 
of products are sold, or a channel of distribution. Rarely is the entire busi-
ness managed as one conglomerate profit center, with no differentiation
of its different sources of sales and profit.
 Cost centers: Some departments and other organizational units do not
generate sales, but they have costs that can be identified to their opera-
tions. Examples are the accounting department, the headquarters staff
of a business, the legal department, and the security department. The
managers responsible for these organizational units need accounting
reports that keep them informed about the costs of running their depart-
ments. The managers should keep their costs under control, of course,
and they need informative accounting reports to do this.
In this chapter, I concentrate on accounting reports for managers of profit cen-
ters. I don’t mean to shun cost centers, but, frankly, the type of accounting
information needed by the managers of cost centers is relatively straightfor-
ward. They need a lot of detailed information, including comparisons with last
period and with the budgeted targets for the current period. I don’t mean to
suggest that the design of cost center reports is a trivial matter. Sorting out sig-
nificant cost variances and highlighting these cost problems for management
attention is very important. But the spotlight of this chapter is on profit analy-
sis methods and the primary accounting report for managers of profit centers.
Note: I should mention that large businesses commonly create relatively
autonomous units within the organization that, in addition to having respon-
sibility for their profit and cost centers, also have broad authority and con-
trol over investing in assets and raising capital for their assets. These
organization units are called, quite logically, investment centers. Basically, an
investment center is a mini business within the larger conglomerate.
Discussing investment centers is beyond the scope of this chapter.
Centering on profit centers
From a one-person sole proprietorship to a mammoth business organization
like General Electric or IBM, one of the most important tasks of managerial
accounting is to identify each source of profit within the business and to accu-
mulate the sales revenue and the expenses for each of these sources of profit.
Can you imagine an auto dealership, for example, not separating revenue and
expenses between its new car sales and its service department? For that
185
Chapter 9: Analyzing and Managing Profit

matter an auto dealer may earn more profit from its financing operations
(originating loans) than from selling new and used cars.
Even many small businesses have a relatively large number of different sources
of profit. In contrast, even a relatively large business may have just a few main-
stream sources of profit. There are no sweeping rules for classifying sales rev-
enue and costs for the purpose of segregating sources of profit — in other
words, for defining the profit centers of a business. Every business has to sort
this out on its own. The controller (chief accountant) can advise top manage-
ment regarding how to organize the business into profit centers. But the main
job of the controller is to identify the profit centers that are established by
management and to make sure that the managers of these profit centers get the
accounting information they need.
Presenting a P&L Template
Profit performance reports prepared for a business’s managers typically are
called P&L (profit and loss) reports. These reports are prepared as frequently
as managers need them, usually monthly or quarterly — perhaps even weekly
in some businesses. An internal P&L report goes to the manager in charge of
each profit center; these confidential profit reports do not circulate outside
the business.
External financial statements comply with well-established rules and conven-
tions. In contrast, the format and content of internal accounting reports to
managers is a wide-open field. If you could sneak a peek at the internal P&L
reports of several businesses, I think you would be surprised at the diversity
among the businesses. All businesses include sales revenue and expenses in
their internal P&L reports. Beyond this broad comment, it’s very difficult to
generalize about the specific format and level of detail included in P&L
reports, particularly regarding how operating expenses are disclosed.
Businesses that sell products deduct the cost of goods sold expense from
sales revenue, and then report gross margin (also called gross profit) — both
in their externally reported income statements and in their internal P&L
reports to managers. However, internal P&L reports have a lot more detail
about sources of sales and the components of cost of goods sold expense. In
this chapter, I use the example of a business that sells products, so the P&L
report that I introduce in the next section follows this pattern. Businesses
that sell products manufactured by other businesses generally fall into one of
two types: retailers that sell products to final consumers, and wholesalers
(distributors) that sell to retailers. The following discussion applies to both
retailers and wholesalers, and also lays the foundation for manufacturing
businesses, which I discuss in Chapter 11.
186
Part III: Accounting in Managing a Business 

From the gross margin on down in an internal P&L statement, reporting prac-
tices vary from company to company. One question looms large: How should
the operating expenses of a profit center be presented in its P&L report?
There’s no authoritative answer to this question. Different businesses report
their operating expenses differently in their internal P&L statements. One
basic choice for reporting operating expenses is between the object of expen-
diture basis and the cost behavior basis.
Reporting operating expenses on 
the object of expenditure basis
One way to present operating expenses in a profit center’s P&L report is to
list them according to the object of expenditure basis. This means that expenses
are classified according to what is purchased (the object of the expenditure) —
such as salaries and wages, commissions paid to salespersons, rent, depreciation,
shipping costs, real estate taxes, advertising, insurance, utilities, office supplies,
telephone costs, and so on. To do this, the operating expenses of the business
have to be recorded in such a way that these costs can be traced to each of
its various profit centers. For example, employee salaries of persons working
in a particular profit center are recorded as belonging to that profit center.
The object of expenditure basis for reporting operating costs to managers of
profit centers is practical and convenient. And this information is useful for
management control because, generally speaking, controlling costs focuses
on the particular items being bought by the business. For example, a profit center
manager analyzes wages and salary expense to decide whether additional or
fewer personnel are needed relative to current and forecast sales levels. A man-
ager can examine the fire insurance expense relative to the types of assets being
insured and their risks of fire losses. For cost control purposes the object of
expenditure basis works well. But, there is a downside. This method for report-
ing operating costs to profit center managers obscures the all-important factor in
making profit: margin. Managers absolutely need to know margin, as I explain in
the following sections.
Reporting operating expenses 
on their cost behavior basis
Margin is the residual amount after all variable expenses of making sales are
deducted from sales revenue. The first and usually largest variable expense
of making sales is the cost of goods sold expense (for companies that sell
products). But most businesses also have other variable expenses that depend
either on the volume of sales (quantities sold) or the dollar amount of sales
(sales revenue). In addition to variable operating expenses of making sales,
187
Chapter 9: Analyzing and Managing Profit

almost all businesses have fixed expenses that are not sensitive to sales
activity — at least not in the short run. Margin equals profit after all variable
costs are deducted from sales revenue but before fixed costs are deducted
from sales revenue.
Figure 9-1 presents a P&L report for a profit center example that classifies oper-
ating expenses according to how they behave relative to sales activity. The
detailed expenses under each major heading are not presented in the P&L report
itself; instead, this information is presented in supporting schedules that supple-
ment the main page of the P&L report.
This two-level approach provides a hierarchy of information. The most important
and critical information is included in the main P&L report, in summary form.
As time permits, the manager can drill down to the more detailed information
in the supporting schedules for each variable and fixed expense in the main
P&L report. The supplementary information for each variable and fixed
expense is presented according to the object of expenditure basis. For exam-
ple, depreciation on the profit center’s fixed assets is one of several items
listed in the direct fixed expenses category. The amount of commissions paid
to salespersons is listed in the revenue-driven expenses category.
The example shown in Figure 9-1 is an annual P&L report. As I mention ear-
lier, profit reports are prepared as frequently as needed by managers, monthly
in most cases. Interim P&L reports may be abbreviated versions of the annual
report. But at least once a year, and preferably more often, the manager should
see the complete picture of all expenses of the profit center. Keep in mind that
this example is for just one slice of the total business, which has other profit
centers each with its own profit (P&L) report.

Part III: Accounting in Managing a Business 

The P&L report shown in Figure 9-1 includes sales volume, which is the total
number of units of product sold during the period. Of course, the accounting
system of a business has to be designed to accumulate sales volume informa-
tion for the P&L report of each profit center. Generally speaking, keeping
track of sales volume for products is not a problem, unless the business sells
a huge variety of different products. When a business cannot come up with a
meaningful measure of sales volume, it still can classify its operating costs
between variable and fixed, although it loses the ability to use per-unit values
in analyzing profit and has to rely on other techniques.
Separating variable and fixed expenses
For a manager to analyze a business’s profit behavior thoroughly, she needs
to know which expenses are variable and which are fixed — in other words,
which expenses change according to the level of sales activity in a given period,
and which don’t. The title of each expense account often gives a pretty good
clue. For example, the cost of goods sold expense is variable because it
depends on the number of units of product sold, and sales commissions are
variable expenses. On the other hand, real estate property taxes and fire and lia-
bility insurance premiums are fixed for a period of time.
Managers should always have a good feel for how their operating expenses
behave relative to sales activity. But to be honest, separating variable and
fixed operating expenses is not quite as simple as it may appear at first glance.
One problem that rears its ugly head is that some expenses, which are recorded
on an object of expenditure basis, have both a fixed cost component and a vari-
able cost component. A classic example was the “telephone and telegraph”
expense (as it was called in the old days). Businesses had to pay a fixed charge
per month for local calls, but long-distance charges depended on how many
calls were made and to where. Of course, modern communication networks
using cell phones and the Internet are quite different. In any case, the accoun-
tant should separate between the fixed and variable cost components of
expenses for reporting to managers.
Variable expenses
Virtually every business has variable expenses, which move up and down in
tight proportion with changes in sales volume or sales revenue, like soldiers
obeying orders barked out by their drill sergeant. Here are examples of
common variable expenses:
 The cost of goods sold expense, which is the cost of products sold to
customers
 Commissions paid to salespeople based on their sales
 Franchise fees based on total sales for the period, which are paid to the
franchisor
189
Chapter 9: Analyzing and Managing Profit

 Transportation costs of delivering products to customers via FedEx,
UPS, and freight haulers (railroads and trucking companies)
 Fees that a retailer pays when a customer uses a credit or debit card
Cost of goods sold is usually the largest variable expense of a business that
sells products, as you would suspect. Other variable expenses are referred to
as operating expenses, which are the costs of making sales and running the
business. The sizes of variable operating expenses, relative to sales revenue,
vary from industry to industry. Delivery costs of Wal-Mart and Costco, for
instance, are minimal because their customers take the products they buy with
them. (Wal-Mart and Costco employees generally don’t even help carry pur-
chases to their customers’ vehicles.) Other businesses deliver products to their
customers’ doorsteps, so that expense is obviously much higher (and dependent
on which delivery service the company uses — FedEx or UPS versus the U.S.
Postal Service, for example).
Fixed expenses
Fixed operating expenses include many different costs that a business is oblig-
ated to pay and cannot decrease over the short run without major surgery on
the human resources and physical facilities of the business.
As an example of fixed expenses, consider the typical self-service car wash
business — you know, the kind where you drive in, put some coins in a box,
and use the water spray to clean your car. Almost all the operating costs of
this business are fixed; rent on the land, depreciation of the structure and the
equipment, and the annual insurance premium don’t depend on the number
of cars passing through the car wash. The main variable expenses are the
water and the soap, and perhaps the cost of electricity.
Fixed expenses are the costs of doing business that, for all practical pur-
poses, are stuck at a certain amount over the short term. Fixed expenses do
not react to changes in the sales level. Here are some more examples of fixed
operating expenses:
 Gas and electricity costs to heat, cool, and light the premises
 Employees’ salaries and benefits
 Real estate property taxes
 Annual audit fee (if the business has its financial statements audited)
 General liability and officers’ and directors’ insurance premiums
If you want to decrease fixed expenses significantly, you need to downsize the
business (lay off workers, sell off property, and so on). When looking at the var-
ious ways for improving profit, significantly cutting down on fixed expenses is
generally the last-resort option. Refer to the section “Know your options for
190
Part III: Accounting in Managing a Business 

improving profit” later in the chapter. A business should be careful not to over-
react to a temporary downturn in sales by making drastic reductions in its
fixed costs, which it may regret later if sales pick up again.
Stopping at operating earnings
In Figure 9-1, the P&L report terminates at the operating earnings line; it does
not include interest expense or income tax expense. Interest expense and
income tax expense are business-wide types of expenses, which are the respon-
sibility of the financial executive(s) of the business. Generally, interest and
income tax expenses are not assigned to profit centers, unless a profit center is
a rather large and autonomous organizational division of the business that has
responsibility for its own assets, finances, and income tax.
The measure of profit before interest and income tax is commonly called oper-
ating earnings or operating profit. It also goes by the name earnings before inter-
est and tax, or EBIT. It is not called net income, because this term is reserved for
the final bottom-line profit number of a business, after all expenses (including
interest and income tax) are deducted from sales revenue.
191
Chapter 9: Analyzing and Managing Profit
Different uses of the term margin
Gross margin, also called gross profit, equals
sales revenue minus the cost of goods sold
expense. Gross margin does not reflect other
variable operating expenses that are deducted
from sales revenue. In contrast, the term margin
refers to sales revenue less all variable
expenses. Some people use the term contribu-
tion margin instead of just margin to stress that
margin contributes toward the recovery of fixed
expenses (and to profit after fixed expenses are
covered). However, the prefix contribution is not
really necessary, and I don’t use it. Why use two
words when one will do?
Businesses that sell products report gross
margin in their external income statements.
However, they do not disclose their variable and
fixed operating expenses. They report expenses
according to an object of expenditure basis,
such as “marketing, administrative, and general
expenses.” The broad expense categories
reported in external income statements include
both variable and fixed cost components.
Therefore, the margin of a business (sales rev-
enue after all variable expenses but before fixed
expenses) is not reported in its external income
statement. Managers carefully guard informa-
tion about margins. They don’t want competitors
to know the margins of their business.
Further complicating the issue, unfortunately, is
that newspaper reporters frequently use the term
margin when referring to operating earnings.
Strictly speaking, this usage is not correct. Margin
equals profit after all variable expenses are
deducted from sales revenue and before fixed
expenses are deducted. So, be careful when you
see the term margin: It may refer to gross margin,
to true margin, or to operating earnings.

Focusing on margin — 
the catalyst of profit
Figure 9-1 includes a very important line of information: margin — both margin
per unit and total margin. Margin is your operating profit before fixed expenses
are deducted. Don’t confuse this number with gross margin, which is profit after
the cost of goods sold expense is subtracted from sales revenue but before any
other expenses are deducted. (Please refer to the sidebar “Different uses of the
term margin.”)
With the information in Figure 9-1 in hand, you can dig into the reasons that
margin per unit increased from $22.66 in fiscal year 2008 to $25.00 in fiscal
year 2009. Two favorable changes occurred: The sales price per unit increased,
and the product cost decreased — no small achievement, to be sure! However,
the gain in the gross profit per unit was offset by unfavorable changes in both
variable operating expenses. The profit center manager must keep on top of
these changes.
As a manager, your attention should be riveted on margin per unit, and you
should understand the reasons for changes in this key profit driver from
period to period. A small change in unit margin can have a big impact on
operating earnings. (See “Don’t underestimate the impact of small changes in
sales price” later in the chapter.)
Answering Two Critical Profit Questions
If you were the manager of a profit center and you had just received the latest
P&L report (see Figure 9-1), you should immediately ask yourself two questions:
 How did I make $1.5 million profit (operating earnings before interest
and income tax) in 2009?
 Why did my profit increase $215,650 over last year ($1,500,000 in 2009 –
$1,284,350 in 2008 = $215,650 profit increase)?
How did you make profit?
Actually, you can answer this profit question three ways (see Figure 9-1 for data):
 Answer # 1: You earned total margin that is more than fixed expenses.
You earned $25 profit margin per unit and sold 100,000 units; therefore:
$25 unit margin × 100,000 units sales volume =
$2,500,000 margin
192
Part III: Accounting in Managing a Business 

Your profit center is charged with $1 million total fixed expenses for the
year ($750,000 direct plus $250,000 allocated fixed costs); therefore:
$2,500,000 margin – $1,000,000 fixed operating
expenses = $1,500,000 operating profit
 Answer # 2: Your sales volume exceeded your break-even point.
Your break-even point is the sales volume at which total margin exactly
equals total fixed expenses. Your break-even point for 2009 was:
$1,000,000 total fixed expenses for year ÷ $25
margin per unit = 40,000 units sales volume 
break-even point
Your actual sales volume for the year was 100,000 units, or 60,000 units
in excess of your break-even point. Each unit sold in excess of break-even
generated $25 “pure” profit because the first 40,000 units sold covered
your fixed expenses. Therefore:
60,000 units sold in excess of break-even × $25
margin per unit = $1,500,000 operating profit
 Answer # 3: Your high sales volume diluted fixed expenses per unit to
below your margin per unit.
The average fixed expenses per unit sold for the year is:
1,500,000 total fixed expenses ÷ 100,000 units sold
= $10 fixed expenses per unit sold
Your margin per unit was $25; so operating earnings per unit were $15 ($25
margin per unit – $10 fixed expenses per unit = $15 operating earnings per
unit). Therefore:
$15 operating earnings per unit × 100,000 units
sales volume = $1,500,000 operating earnings
Each answer is valid. In certain situations, one method of analysis is more useful
than another. If you were thinking of making a large increase in fixed operating
expenses, for example, you should pay attention to the effect on your break-even
point; answer #2 is useful in this situation. If you were thinking of changing sales
prices, answer #1, which focuses on margin per unit, is very relevant. (See the
later section “Using the P&L Template for Decision-Making Analysis.”) Likewise, if
you’re dealing with changes in product cost or variable operating expenses that
affect unit margin, answer #1 is very helpful.
Answer 3 is useful to focus on the full cost of a product. In the example, the
sales price is $100 per unit (refer to Figure 9-1). The total of variable costs per
unit is $75 (which includes product cost and the two variable operating costs
per unit). The average fixed cost per unit sold is $10, which added to the $75
variable cost per unit gives $85 full cost per unit. Subtracting the full cost per
unit from the $100 sales price gives the $15 profit per unit.
193
Chapter 9: Analyzing and Managing Profit

How did you increase profit?
In your profit center report (refer to Figure 9-1), note that your total fixed
expenses increased from $925,000 last year to $1 million in 2009, a $75,000
increase. Of course, you should investigate the reasons for your fixed expense
increases. The $25,000 increase in allocated fixed expenses may not be under
your control, but the $50,000 increase in direct fixed expenses is under your
control. These fixed costs are your responsibility as manager of the profit
center. You definitely should know which of these costs were higher than last
year, and the reasons for the increases.
In any case, you were able to increase margin more than enough to cover the
fixed costs increases and to boost profit. In fact, your margin increased
$290,650 over last year ($2,500,000 margin in 2009 – $2,209,350 margin in 2008
= $290,650 margin increase). How did you do this?
This question can be answered more than one way. In my view, the most
practical method is to calculate the effect of changes in sales volume and the
margin per unit. Being the superb manager that you are, to say nothing of
your marketing genius, your profit center increased sales volume over last
year. Furthermore, you were able to increase margin per unit, which is even
more impressive. The profit impact of each change is determined as follows
(refer to Figure 9-1 for data):
 Sales volume change impact on profit:
$25 margin per unit × 2,500 units sales volume
increase = $62,500 increase in margin
 Margin per unit change impact on profit:
$2.34 increase in margin per unit × 97,500 units
sales volume last year = $228,150 increase 
in margin
Even if your sales volume had stayed the same, the $2.34 increase in your
margin per unit (from $22.66 to $25) would have increased margin $228,150.
And by selling 2,500 more units than last year, you increased margin $62,500.
Quite clearly, the major factor was the significant increase in your margin per
unit. You were able to increase this key profit driver by more than 10 percent
(10.3 percent to be precise). However, you may not be able to repeat this per-
formance in the coming year; you may have to increase sales volume to boost
profit next year.
194
Part III: Accounting in Managing a Business 

Looking More Closely at the 
Profit Center P&L Report
As the previous sections should make clear, profit center managers depend
heavily on the information in their P&L reports. They need to thoroughly under-
stand these profit reports. Therefore, I want to spend some time walking
through each element of the P&L report. Please flip back to Figure 9-1 as I do so.
Sales volume
Sales volume, the first line in the P&L report, is the total number of units sold
during the period, net of any returns by customers. Sales volume should include
only units that actually brought in revenue to the business. In general, busi-
nesses do a good job in keeping track of the sales volumes of their products
(and services). These are closely monitored figures in, for example, the automo-
bile and personal computer industries.
Now here’s a nagging problem: Some businesses sell a huge variety of prod-
ucts. No single product or product line brings in more than a small fraction of
the total sales revenue. For instance, McGuckin Hardware, a general hardware
store in Boulder, carries more than 100,000 products. The business may keep
count of customer traffic or the number of individual sales made over the year,
but it probably does not track the quantities sold for each and every product it
sells. I explore this issue later in the chapter — see the last section, “Closing
with a Boozy Example,” for more details.
Sales revenue
Sales revenue is the net amount of money received by the business from the
sales of products during the period. Notice the word net here. The business
in our example, like most, offers its customers many incentives to buy its
products and to pay quickly for their purchases. The amount of sales revenue
in Figure 9-1 is not simply the list prices of the products sold times the
number of units sold. Rather, the sales revenue amount takes into account
deductions for rebates, allowances, prompt payment discounts, and any
other incentives offered to customers that reduce the amount of revenue
received by the business. (The manager can ask that these revenue offsets be
included in the supplementary backup layer of schedules to the main page of
the P&L report.)
195
Chapter 9: Analyzing and Managing Profit

Cost of goods sold
Cost of goods sold is the cost of the products sold during the period. This
expense should be net of discounts, rebates, and allowances the business
receives from its vendors and suppliers. The cost of goods sold means different
things for different types of businesses:
 To determine product costs, manufacturers add together three costs:
• The costs of raw materials
• Labor costs
• Production overhead costs
Accounting for the cost of manufactured products is a major function of
cost accounting, which I discuss in Chapter 11.
 For retailers and distributors, product cost basically is purchase cost.
However, refer to Chapter 7, where I explain the differences between the
FIFO and LIFO methods for releasing inventory costs to the cost of goods
sold expense. The profit center manager should have no doubts about
which cost of goods sold expense accounting method is being used. For
that matter, the manager should be aware of any other costs that are
included in total product cost (such as inbound freight and handling costs
in some cases).
One common problem is how to report the cost of inventory shrinkage, which
refers to losses from shoplifting by customers, physical deterioration of prod-
ucts as they sit in inventory, employee theft of products, damage caused in
the handling and storage of products, and so on. The amount of inventory
shrinkage can be included in the cost of goods sold expense, or it may be
included in volume-driven operating expenses. A manager definitely should
know which other costs have been placed in the cost of goods sold expense,
in addition to the product cost of units sold during the period.
Variable operating expenses
In Figure 9-1, variable operating expenses are divided into two types: revenue-
driven expenses and volume-driven expenses.
Revenue-driven expenses are those that depend primarily on the dollar amount of
sales revenue. This group of variable operating expenses includes commissions
paid to salespersons based on the dollar amount of their sales, credit card fees
paid by retailers, franchise fees based on sales revenue, and any other cost that
depends directly on the amount of sales revenue. Notice in Figure 9-1 that these
196
Part III: Accounting in Managing a Business 

operating expenses are presented as a percent of sales price in the per-unit
column; in the example these costs equal 8.5 percent, or $8.50 per $100 of sales
revenue in 2009 (versus only 8.0 percent in 2008).
Volume-driven expenses are driven by and depend primarily on the number of
units sold, or the total quantity of products sold during the period (as
opposed to the dollar value of the sales). These expenses include delivery
and transportation costs paid by the business, packaging costs, and any
costs that depend primarily on the size and weight of the products sold.
Most businesses have both types of variable operating expenses. However,
one or the other may be so minor that it would not be useful to report the
cost as a separate item to managers. Only the dominant type of variable oper-
ating expense would be presented, and it would absorb the other type —
which is good enough for government work, as they say.
Fixed operating expenses
Managers may view fixed operating expenses as an albatross around the neck
of the business. In fact, these costs provide the infrastructure and support for
making sales. The main characteristic of fixed operating costs is that they do not
decline when sales during the period fall short of expectations. A business com-
mits to many fixed operating costs for the coming period. For all practical pur-
poses these costs cannot be decreased very much over the short run. Examples
of fixed costs are wages of employees on fixed salaries (from managers to main-
tenance workers), real estate taxes, depreciation on the buildings and equipment
used in making sales, and utility bills.
Certain fixed costs can be matched with a particular profit center. For example,
a business may advertise a specific product, and the fixed cost of the advertise-
ment can be matched against revenue from sales of that product. A major
product line may have its own employees on fixed salaries or its own delivery
trucks on which depreciation is recorded. A business may purchase specific lia-
bility insurance covering a particular product it sells. In Figure 9-1 these costs
are reported as direct fixed expenses.
In contrast, you cannot directly couple company-wide fixed operating expenses
to particular products, product lines, or other types of profit units in the organi-
zational structure of a business. General administrative expenses (such as the
CEO’s annual salary and corporate legal expenses) are incurred on an entity-as-a-
whole basis and cannot be connected directly with any particular profit center. A
business may, therefore, allocate these fixed costs among its different profit cen-
ters. The fixed costs that are handed down from headquarters are shown as allo-
cated fixed expenses in Figure 9-1.
197
Chapter 9: Analyzing and Managing Profit

Using the P&L Template for 
Decision-Making Analysis
The P&L template (refer to Figure 9-1) serves as a good model for decision-
making analysis. To demonstrate, suppose that you’re under intense competi-
tive pressure to lower the sales price of one product you sell. This product is
one “slice” of the total activity reported in Figure 9-1. Suppose that during the
year (2009) you sold 1,000 units of the product at a $100 sales price, and the
unit costs of this product are the same as in Figure 9-1.
Your competitors are undercutting your sales price, so you’re thinking of cut-
ting the sales price 10 percent next year, or $10 per unit. You predict that the
price reduction will boost sales volume 25 percent and increase your market
share. Seems like a good idea — or does it? You should run some numbers
before making a final decision, just to be sure. Answer #1 in the earlier sec-
tion “How did you make profit?” is the best method for this analysis. For the
year just ended, this product generated $25,000 margin:
$25 margin per unit × 1,000 units sold = 
$25,000 margin

Part III: Accounting in Managing a Business 
Dealing with a flaw in the accounting system
The P&L report template I show in Figure 9-1
and the analysis of profit I explain in the section
“Answering Two Critical Profit Questions” hinge
on the separation of variable and fixed operat-
ing costs. On the other hand, the classification
between variable and fixed operating expenses
is not needed in external financial statements
and income tax returns. Operating expenses are
reported on the object of expenditure basis in
external financial reports and tax returns, so the
accounting systems of many businesses do not
tag operating expense accounts as fixed or
variable. As a result, variable versus fixed infor-
mation for operating expenses is not readily
available from the accounting system. What’s a
manager to do?
Well, here’s a practical solution: As the profit
center manager, you can tell your accountant
whether an operating expense is variable or
fixed. Give your classification of the operating
expenses in your profit center to the accoun-
tant, and stress that you want this classification
in the P&L report for your profit center. This may
be extra work for your accountant, but the vari-
able versus fixed classification of operating
expense is of great value for your management
decision-making, control, and planning.

Assuming your prediction about sales volume at the lower price is correct
and sales volume increases to 1,250 units, and assuming that the variable costs
for the product remain the same, next year you would earn $18,750 margin:
$15 margin per unit × 1,250 units sold = 
$18,750 margin
Cutting the sales price $10 reduces the margin per unit $10; the new margin
per unit would be $15 per unit. That’s a 40 percent drop in margin per unit. A
25 percent gain in sales volume cannot make up for the 40 percent plunge in
margin per unit. You’d need a much larger sales increase just to keep margin
the same as in 2009, and even more sales to increase margin next year. You’d
better think twice about dropping the sales price.
You may gain a larger market share, but your margin would drop from $25,000
to $18,750 on this product if you go ahead with the sales price cut. Is the larger
market share worth this much sacrifice of margin? That’s why you get paid the
big bucks: to make decisions like this. As your controller I can only help you do
the analysis and calculate the impact on profit before you make a final decision.
Another factor to consider is this: Fixed expenses (people, warehouse space,
distribution channels, and so on) provide the capacity to make sales and carry
on operations. A small increase in sales volume, such as selling 250 more units
of the product in question, should not push up the total fixed expenses of your
profit center (unless you are already bursting at the seams). On the other hand,
a major sales volume increase across the board would require additional
capacity, and your fixed expenses would have to be increased.
This sales price reduction decision is just one example of the many decisions
business managers have to deal with day in and day out. The P&L report tem-
plate is a useful — indeed an invaluable — analysis framework for many 
decisions facing business managers.
Tucking Away Some Valuable Lessons
The P&L report template shown in Figure 9-1 offers managers several impor-
tant lessons. Like most tools, the more you use it the more you learn. In the
following sections I summarize some important lessons from the template.
Recognize the leverage effect caused 
by fixed operating expenses
Suppose sales volume had been 10 percent higher or lower in 2009, holding
other profit factors the same. Would profit have been correspondingly 10
199
Chapter 9: Analyzing and Managing Profit

percent higher or lower? The intuitive, knee-jerk reaction answer is yes, profit
would have been 10 percent higher or lower. Wouldn’t it? Not necessarily.
Margin would have been 10 percent higher or lower — $250,000 higher or lower
($25 margin per unit × 10,000 units = $250,000).
The $250,000 change in margin would carry down to profit unless fixed expenses
would have been higher or lower at the different sales volume. The very nature
of fixed expenses is that these costs do not change with relatively small changes
in sales volume. In all likelihood, fixed expenses would have been virtually the
same at a 10 percent higher or lower sales level.
Therefore, profit would have been $250,000 higher or lower. On the base
profit of $1.5 million, the $250,000 swing equals a 17 percent shift in profit.
Thus, a 10 percent swing in sales volume causes a 17 percent swing in profit.
This wider swing in profit is called the operating leverage effect. The idea is
that a business makes better use of its fixed expenses when sales go up; its
fixed expenses don’t increase with the sales volume increase. Of course, the
downside is that fixed expenses don’t decrease when sales volume drops.
Don’t underestimate the impact 
of small changes in sales price
Recall that in the example the sales price is $100, and revenue-driven variable
expenses are 8.5 percent of sales revenue (refer to Figure 9-1). Suppose the
business had sold the product for $4 more or less than it did, which is only a
4 percent change — pretty small it would seem. This different sales price
would have changed its margin per unit $3.66 net of the corresponding change
in the revenue-driven variable expenses per unit. ($4 sales price change × 8.5
percent = $.34 per unit, which netted against the $4 sales price change = $3.66
change in margin per unit.)
Therefore, the business would have earned total margin $366,000 higher or
lower than it did at the $100 sales price. ($3.66 change in margin per unit ×
100,000 units sales volume = $366,000 shift in margin.) Fixed expenses are not
sensitive to sales price changes and would have been the same, so the
$366,000 shift in margin would carry down to profit.
The $366,000 swing in profit, compared with the $1.5 million baseline profit in
the example, equals a 24 percent swing in profit. A 4 percent change in sales
price causes a 24 percent change in profit. Recall that a 10 percent change in
sales volume causes just a 17 percent change in profit. When it comes to
profit impact, sales price changes dominate sales volume changes.
200
Part III: Accounting in Managing a Business 

The moral of the story is to protect margin per unit above all else. Every
dollar of margin per unit that’s lost — due to decreased sales prices,
increased product cost, or increases in other variable costs — has a tremen-
dously negative impact on profit. Conversely, if you can increase the margin
per unit without hurting sales volume, you reap very large profit benefits.
Know your options for improving profit
Improving profit boils down to three critical factors, listed in order from the
most effective to the least effective:
 Increasing margin per unit
 Increasing sales volume
 Reducing fixed expenses
Say you want to improve your profit from the $1.5 million you earned in 2009
to $1.8 million next year, which is a $300,000 or 20 percent increase. Okay, so
how are you going to increase profit $300,000? Here are your basic options:
 Increase your margin per unit $3, which would raise total margin
$300,000 based on the 100,000 units sales volume.
 Sell 12,000 additional units at the present margin per unit of $25, which
would raise your total margin by $300,000. (12,000 additional units × $25 =
$300,000 additional margin.)
 Use a combination of these two strategies: Increase both the margin per
unit and sales volume such that the combined effect is to improve total
margin $300,000.
 Reduce fixed expenses $300,000.
The last alternative may not be very realistic. Part of your fixed expenses
($250,000) is the amount allocated from headquarters, over which you have no
control. Reducing your direct fixed expenses $300,000, from $750,000 to
$450,000, would be drastic and probably would reduce your capacity to make
sales and carry out the operations in your part of the business. Perhaps you
could do a little belt-tightening in your fixed expenses area, but in all likelihood
you would have to turn to the other alternatives for increasing your profit.
The second approach is obvious — you just need to set a sales goal of increasing
the number of products sold by 12,000 units. (How you motivate your already
overworked sales staff to accomplish that sales volume goal is up to you.) But
how do you go about the first approach, increasing the margin per unit by $3?
201
Chapter 9: Analyzing and Managing Profit

The simplest way to increase margin per unit by $3 would be to decrease your
product cost per unit $3. Or you could attempt to reduce sales commissions
from $8.50 per $100 of sales to $5.50 per $100 — which may hurt the motivation
of your sales force, of course. Or you could raise the sales price about $3.38
(remember that 8.5 percent comes off the top for sales commission, so only $3
would remain to improve the unit margin). Or you could combine two or more
such changes so that your unit margin next year would increase $3.
Closing with a Boozy Example
Several years ago, some friends pooled their capital and opened a liquor
store in a rapidly growing area. In their estimation, the business had a lot of
promise. They didn’t come to me for advice, but if they had I would have told
them one thing to do during their planning stage — in addition to location
analysis and competition analysis, of course. I would have recommended that
they run some critical numbers through a basic profit model in order to esti-
mate the annual sales revenue they would need to break even. Of course,
they want to do better than break even, but the break-even sales level is a key
point of reference.
Starting up any business involves making commitments to a lot of fixed
expenses. Leases are signed, equipment is purchased, people are hired, and so
on. All this puts a heavy fixed cost burden on a new business. The business
needs to make sales and generate margin from the sales that is enough to
cover its fixed expenses before it can break into the profit column. So, the first
step I would have suggested is that they estimate their fixed expenses for the
first year. Next, they should have estimated their profit margin on sales. Here
there is a slight problem, but one that is not too difficult to deal with.
During their open house for the new store, I noticed the very large number of
different beers, wines, and spirits available for sale — to say nothing of the
different sizes and types of containers many products come in. Quite literally,
the business sells thousands of distinct products. The store also sells many
products like soft drinks, ice, corkscrews, and so on. Therefore, the business
does not have an easy-to-define sales volume factor (the number of units
sold) for analyzing profit. The business example I discuss in this chapter uses
a sales volume factor, which is the number of units sold during the period. In
the liquor store example, this won’t work. So, a modification is made. Total
sales revenue is used for the measure of sales volume, not the number of
units (bottles) sold.
The next step, then, is to determine the average margin as a percent of sales rev-
enue. I’d estimate that a liquor store’s average gross margin (sales revenue less
cost of goods sold) is about 25 percent. The other variable operating expenses
of the liquor store probably run about 5 percent of sales. (I could be off on this
estimate, of course.) So, the average margin would be 20 percent of sales (25
202
Part III: Accounting in Managing a Business 

percent gross margin less 5 percent variable operating expenses). Suppose the
total fixed operating expenses of the liquor store were about $100,000 per
month (for rent, salaries, electricity, and so on), which is $1.2 million per year.
So, the store needs $6 million in annual sales to break even:
$1,200,000 annual fixed expenses ÷ 20% average
margin = $6,000,000 annual sales revenue to break
even
Selling $6 million of product a year means moving a lot of booze. The busi-
ness needs to sell another $1 million to provide $200,000 of operating earn-
ings (at the 20 percent average margin) — to pay interest expense and
income tax and leave enough net income for the owners who invested capital
in the business and who expect a decent return on their investment.
I’m not privy to the financial statements of the liquor store. It appears that
they have been quite successful. Business seems to be booming, even with-
out my advice. Perhaps they did exactly the sort of profit model analysis that
I would have recommended.

A
business can’t open its doors each day without having a pretty good
idea of what to expect. And it can’t close its doors at the end of the day
not knowing what happened. Recall the Boy Scouts’ motto: “Be prepared.” A
business should follow that dictum: It should plan and be prepared for its
future, and it should control its actual performance to reach its financial goals.
Business managers can wait for results to be reported to them on a “look
back” basis, and then wing it from there. Or, they can look ahead and care-
fully plan profit, cash flows, and financial condition of the business, to chart
its course into the future. The plan provides invaluable benchmarks; actual
results can be compared against the plan to detect when things go off course.
Planning the financial future of a business and comparing actual performance
against the plan are the essence of business budgeting. Budgeting is not an
end to itself but rather a means or tool of financial planning and control.
But keep in mind that budgeting costs time and money. The business man-
ager should put budgeting to the cost/benefit test. Frankly, budgeting may
not earn its keep and could actually cause serious problems that contradict
the very reasons for doing it.
Budgeting offers important benefits, but a business may decide not to go to the
effort of full-scale budgeting. I can’t argue with a minimal budgeting strategy for
some businesses. However, a business should not throw out the budgeting
baby with the bathwater. Certain techniques used in budgeting are very useful
even when a business doesn’t do formal budgeting.

206
Part III: Accounting in Managing a Business 
Exploring the Reasons for Budgeting
The financial statements included in the financial reports of a business are
prepared after the fact; they’re based on transactions that have already taken
place. (I explain business financial statements in Chapters 4, 5, and 6.) Budgeted
financial statements, on the other hand, are prepared before the fact and reflect
future transactions that are expected to take place based on the business’s
strategy and financial goals. Note: Budgeted financial statements are not shared
outside the business; they are strictly for internal management use.
Business budgeting requires setting specific goals and developing the detailed
plans necessary to achieve them. Business budgeting should be built on real-
istic forecasts for the coming period. A business budget is an integrated plan
of action — not simply a few trend lines on a financial chart. Budgeting is
much more than slap-dashing together a few figures. A budget is an integrated
financial plan put down on paper — or, more likely these days, entered in com-
puter spreadsheets. (Many budgeting computer programs are on the market
today; ask your CPA or other financial consultant which one he or she thinks
is best for your business.)
Business managers don’t just look out the window and come up with budget
numbers. Budgeting is not pie-in-the-sky wishful thinking. Business budgeting —
to have practical value — must start with a broad-based critical analysis of the
most recent actual performance and position of the business by the managers
who are responsible for the results. Then the managers decide on specific and
concrete goals for the coming year. (Budgets can be done for more than one year,
but the first stepping stone into the future is the budget for the coming year —
see the sidebar “Taking it one game at a time.”)
In short, budgeting demands a fair amount of managers’ time and energy.
Budgets should be worth this time and effort. So why should a business go to the
trouble of budgeting? Business managers do budgeting and prepare budgeted
financial statements for three main reasons: modeling, planning, and control.
Taking it one game at a time
A company generally prepares one-year bud-
gets, although many businesses also develop
budgets for two, three, and five years out.
Whenever you reach out beyond a year, what
you’re doing becomes more tentative and iffy.
Making forecasts and estimates for the next 12
months is tough enough. A one-year budget is
more definite and detailed in comparison to
longer-term budgets. As they say in the sports
world, a business should take it one game (or
year) at a time. Looking down the road beyond
one year is a good idea, to set long-term goals
and to develop long-term strategy. But long-term
planning is different than short-term budgeting.

Modeling reasons for budgeting
Business managers should make detailed analyses to determine how to improve
the financial performance and condition of their business. The status quo is
usually not good enough; business managers are paid to improve things — not
to simply rest on their past accomplishments. For this reason managers should
develop good models of profit, cash flow, and financial condition for their busi-
ness. Models are blueprints or schematics of how things work. A financial model
is like a roadmap that clearly marks the pathways to profit, cash flow, and finan-
cial condition.
Don’t be intimidated by the term model. Simply put, a model consists of vari-
ables and how they interact. A variable is a critical factor that, in conjunction
with other factors, determines results. A model is analytical, but not all
models are mathematical. In fact, none of the financial models in this book is
the least bit mathematical — but you do have to look at each factor of the
model and how it interacts with one or more other factors. Here’s an example
of an accounting model, which is called the accounting equation:
Assets = Liabilities + Owners’ equity
This is a very condensed model of the balance sheet. The accounting equa-
tion is not detailed enough for budgeting, however. More detail about assets
and liabilities is needed for budgeting purposes.
Chapter 9 presents a profit and loss (P&L) report template for managers (see
Figure 9-1). This P&L report is, at its core, a profit model. This model includes
the critical variables that drive profit: sales volume, sales price, product cost,
and so on. A P&L report, such as the one I show in Figure 9-1, provides the
essential feedback information on profit performance of the organizational unit
(a profit center in the example). The P&L report also serves as the platform and
the point of departure for mapping out the profit strategies and goals for the
coming year.
Likewise, business managers need a model for planning cash flow from operating
activities. (I explain this important source of cash flow in Chapter 6.) Managers
should definitely forecast the amount of cash they will generate during the
coming year from making profit. They need a reliable estimate of this source of
cash flow in order to plan for other sources of cash flow they will need during
the coming year — to provide the money for replacing and expanding the long-
term operating (fixed) assets of the business and to make cash distributions
from profit to owners. Managers need a model that provides a clear trail of how
the sales and expenses of the business drive its assets and liabilities, which in
turn drive the cash flow from operating activities.
207
Chapter 10: Financial Planning, Budgeting, and Control

Most business managers see the advantages of budgeting profit for the
coming year; you don’t have to twist their arms to do this. At the same time,
many businesses balk at budgeting changes in assets and liabilities during
the coming year, which means they can’t budget cash flow from operating
activities. All their budget effort is focused on profit, and they leave cash
flows and financial condition in the dark. This is a dangerous strategy when
the business is in a tight cash position. The business should not simply
assume that its cash flow from operating activities will be adequate to its
needs during the coming year.
The best advice is to prepare all three budgeted financial statements:
 Budgeted income statement (profit report): The P&L report shown in
Figure 9-1 serves as a hands-on profit model — one that highlights the
critical variables that drive profit. This P&L report separates variable
and fixed expenses and includes sales volume, margin per unit, and other
factors that determine profit performance. The P&L report is a schematic
that shows the path to operating profit. It reveals the factors that must be
improved in order to improve profit performance in the coming period.
 Budgeted balance sheet: The key connections and ratios between sales
revenue and expenses and their corresponding assets and liabilities are
the elements in the model for the budgeted balance sheet. These vital
connections are explained throughout Chapters 4 and 5. The budgeted
changes in operating assets and liabilities provide the information needed
for budgeting cash flows during the coming year.
 Budgeted statement of cash flows: The budgeted changes during the
coming year in the assets and liabilities used in making profit (conduct-
ing operating activities) determine cash flow from operating activities for
the coming year (see Chapter 6). In contrast, the cash flows of investing
and financing activities depend on the managers’ strategic decisions regard-
ing capital expenditures that will be made during the coming year, how
much new capital will be raised from debt and from owners’ sources of
capital, and the business’s policy regarding cash distributions from profit.
In short, budgeting requires good working models of making profit, financial
condition (assets and liabilities), and cash flow. Budgeting provides a strong
incentive for business managers to develop financial models that help them
make strategic decisions and exercise control — and do better planning.
Planning reasons for budgeting
One main purpose of budgeting is to force managers to create a definite and
detailed financial plan for the coming period. To construct a budget, man-
agers have to establish explicit financial objectives for the coming year and
identify exactly what has to be done to accomplish these financial objectives.
208
Part III: Accounting in Managing a Business 

Budgeted financial statements and their supporting schedules provide clear
destination points — the financial flight plan for a business.
The process of putting together a budget directs attention to the specific things
that you must do to achieve your profit objectives and optimize your assets and
capital. Basically, budgets are a form of planning that push managers to answer
the question “How are we going to get there from here?”
Budgeting can also yield other important planning-related benefits:
 Budgeting encourages a business to articulate its vision, strategy, and
goals. A business needs a clearly stated strategy guided by an overarching
vision, and it should have definite and explicit goals. It is not enough for
business managers to have strategies and goals in their heads. Developing
budgeted financial statements forces managers to be explicit and definite
about the objectives of the business, as well as to formulate realistic plans
for achieving the business objectives.
 Budgeting imposes discipline and deadlines on the planning process.
Busy managers have trouble finding enough time for lunch, let alone
planning for the upcoming financial period. Budgeting pushes managers
to set aside time to prepare a detailed plan that serves as a road map for
the business. Good planning results in a concrete course of action that
details how a company plans to achieve its financial objectives.
Management control reasons for budgeting
I deliberately put this reason last, after the modeling and planning reasons
for budgeting. Many people have the mistaken notion that the main purpose
of budgeting is to rein in managers and employees, who otherwise would
spend money like drunken sailors. Budgeting should not put the business’s
managers in a financial straitjacket. Tying the hands of managers is not the
purpose of budgeting. Having said this, however, it’s true that budgets serve
a management control function. Management control, first and foremost, means
achieving the financial goals and objectives of the business, which requires
comparing actual performance against benchmarks and holding individual
managers responsible for keeping the business on schedule in reaching its
financial objectives.
The board of directors of a corporation focuses its attention on the master
budget for the whole business: the budgeted income statement, balance sheet,
and cash flow statement for the business as a whole for the coming year. The
chief executive officer (CEO) of the business focuses on the master budget as
well, but the CEO must also look at how each manager in the organization is
doing on his or her part of the master budget. As you move down the organi-
zation chart of a business, managers have narrower responsibilities — say,
for the business’s northeastern territory or for one major product line. A
209
Chapter 10: Financial Planning, Budgeting, and Control

master budget consists of different segments that follow the business’s orga-
nizational structure. In other words, the master budget is put together from
many pieces, one for each separate organizational unit of the business. For
example, the manager of one of the company’s far-flung warehouses has a
separate budget for expenses and inventory levels for his or her bailiwick.
By using budget targets as benchmarks against which actual performance is
compared, managers can closely monitor progress toward (or deviations from)
the budget goals and timetable. You use a budget plan like a navigation chart to
keep your business on course. Significant variations from the budget raise red
flags, in which case you can determine that performance is off course or that
the budget needs to be revised because of unexpected developments.
For management control, a budgeted profit report is divided into months 
or quarters for the coming year. The budgeted balance sheet and budgeted
cash flow statement may also be put on a monthly or quarterly basis. The
business should not wait too long to compare budgeted sales revenue and
expenses against actual performance (or to compare actual cash flows 
and asset levels against the budget). You need to take prompt action when
problems arise, such as a divergence between budgeted expenses and actual
expenses.
Profit is the main thing to pay attention to, but accounts receivable and
inventory can also get out of control (become too high relative to actual sales
revenue and cost of goods sold expense), causing cash flow problems.
(Chapter 6 explains how increases in accounts receivable and inventory are
negative factors on cash flow.) A business cannot afford to ignore its balance
sheet and cash flow numbers until the end of the year.
Additional benefits of budgeting, 
and a note of caution
Budgeting has advantages and ramifications that go beyond the financial
dimension and have more to do with business management in general.
Consider the following:
 Budgeting forces managers to do better forecasting. Managers should
be constantly scanning the business environment to spot changes that
will impact the business. Vague generalizations about what the future
may hold for the business are not good enough for assembling a budget.
Managers are forced to put their predictions into definite and concrete
forecasts.
 Budgeting motivates managers and employees by providing useful yard-
sticks for evaluating performance. The budgeting process can have a
good motivational impact by involving managers in the budgeting process
(especially in setting goals and objectives) and by providing incentives to
210
Part III: Accounting in Managing a Business 

managers to strive for and achieve the business’s goals and objectives.
Budgets provide useful information for superiors to evaluate the perfor-
mance of managers and can be used to reward good results. Employees
may be equally motivated by budgets. For example, budgets supply base-
line financial information for incentive compensation plans. And the profit
plan (budget) for the year can be used to award year-end bonuses accord-
ing to whether designated goals were achieved.
 Budgeting can assist in the communication between different levels of
management. Putting plans and expectations in black and white in bud-
geted financial statements — including definite numbers for forecasts
and goals — minimizes confusion and creates a kind of common lan-
guage. As you know, the “failure to communicate” lament is common in
many business organizations. Well-crafted budgets can definitely help
the communication process.
 Budgeting is essential in writing a business plan. New and emerging
businesses need to present a convincing business plan when raising cap-
ital. Because these businesses may have little or no history, the managers
and owners must demonstrate convincingly that the company has a clear
strategy and a realistic plan to make profit. A coherent, realistic budget fore-
cast is an essential component of a business plan. Venture capital sources
definitely want to see the budgeted financial statements of a business.
In larger businesses, budgets are typically used to hold managers accountable
for their areas of responsibility in the organization; actual results are compared
against budgeted goals and timetables, and variances are highlighted. Managers
do not mind taking credit for favorable variances, when actual comes in better
than budget. But beating the budget for the period does not always indicate out-
standing performance. A favorable variance could be the result of manipulating
the budget in the first place, so that the budgeted benchmarks can be easily
achieved.
Likewise, unfavorable variances have to be interpreted carefully. If a manager’s
budgeted goals and targets are fair and reasonable, the manager should be
held responsible. The manager should carefully analyze what went wrong and
what needs to be improved. Stern action may be called for, but the higher ups
should recognize that the budget benchmarks may not be entirely fair; in par-
ticular, they should make allowances for unexpected developments that occur
after the budget goals and targets are established (such as a hurricane or tor-
nado, or the bankruptcy of a major customer). When managers perceive the
budgeted goals and targets to be arbitrarily imposed by superiors and not
realistic, serious motivational problems can arise.
Budgeting is not without its problems. Budgeting looks good in theory, but in
actual practice things are not so rosy. Here are some issues to consider:
 Budgeting takes time, and the one thing all business managers will tell
you is that they never have enough time for all the things they should do.
211
Chapter 10: Financial Planning, Budgeting, and Control

 Budgeting done from the top down (from headquarters down to the
lower levels of managers) can stifle innovation and discourage managers
from taking the initiative when they should.
 Unrealistic budget goals can demotivate managers rather than motivate
them.
 Managers may game the budget, which means they play the budget as a
game in which they worry first and foremost about how they will be
affected by the budget rather than what’s best for the business.
 There have been cases in which managers resorted to accounting fraud
to make their budget numbers.
Realizing That Not Everyone Budgets
Most of what I’ve said so far in this chapter can be likened to a commercial
for budgeting — emphasizing the reasons for and advantages of budgeting by
a business. So every business does budgeting, right? Nope. Smaller businesses
generally do little or no budgeting — and even many larger businesses avoid
budgeting, at least in a formal and comprehensive manner. The reasons are
many, and mostly practical in nature.
Avoiding budgeting
Some businesses are in relatively mature stages of their life cycle or operate
in a mature and stable industry. These companies do not have to plan for any
major changes or discontinuities. Next year will be a great deal like last year.
The benefits of going through a formal budgeting process do not seem worth
the time and cost.
At the other extreme, a business may be in a very uncertain environment,
where attempting to predict the future seems pointless. A business may lack
the expertise and experience to prepare budgeted financial statements, and it
may not be willing to pay the cost for a CPA or outside consultant to help.
But what if your business applies for a loan? The lender will demand to see a
well-thought-out budget in your business plan, right? Not necessarily. I served
on a local bank’s board of directors for several years, and I reviewed many
loan requests. Our bank did not expect a business to include a set of budgeted
financial statements in the loan request package. Of course, we did demand to
see the latest financial statements of the business. Very few of our smaller
business clients prepared budgeted financial statements.

Part III: Accounting in Managing a Business 

Relying on internal accounting reports
Although many businesses do not prepare budgets, they still establish fairly
specific goals and performance objectives that serve as good benchmarks for
management control. Every business — whether it does budgeting or not —
should design internal accounting reports that provide the information man-
agers need in running a business. Obviously, managers should keep close
tabs on what’s going on throughout the business. Some years ago, in one of
my classes, I asked students for a short definition of management control.
One student answered that management control means “watching every-
thing.” That’s not bad.
Even in a business that doesn’t do budgeting, managers depend on regular
profit reports, balance sheets, and cash flow statements. These key internal
financial statements should provide detailed management control information.
These feedback reports are also used for looking ahead and thinking about the
future. Other specialized accounting reports may be needed as well.
Making reports useful for management control
Most business managers, in my experience, would tell you that the account-
ing reports they get are reasonably good for management control. Their
accounting reports provide the detailed information they need for keeping a
close watch on the 1,001 details of the business (or their particular sphere of
responsibility in the business organization).
What are the criticisms I hear most often about internal accounting reports?
 They contain too much information.
 All the information is flat, as if each piece of information is equally relevant.
Managers are very busy people and have only so much time to read the
accounting reports coming to them. Managers have a valid beef on this score,
I think. Ideally, significant deviations and problems should be highlighted in
the accounting reports they receive — but separating the important from the
not-so-important is easier said than done.
Making reports useful for decision-making
If you were to ask a cross-section of business managers how useful their
accounting reports are for making decisions, you would get a different answer
than how good the accounting reports are for management control.
Business managers make many decisions affecting profit: setting sales prices,
buying products, determining wages and salaries, hiring independent con-
tractors, and purchasing fixed assets, for example. Managers should carefully
analyze how their actions would impact profit before reaching final decisions.
Managers need internal profit reports that are good profit models — that
213
Chapter 10: Financial Planning, Budgeting, and Control

make clear the critical variables that affect profit (see Figure 10-1 in the next
section for an example). Well-designed management profit reports are
absolutely essential for helping managers make good decisions.
Keep in mind that almost all business decisions involve nonfinancial and non-
quantifiable factors that go beyond the information included in accounting
reports. For example, the accounting department of a business can calculate
the cost savings of a wage cut, or the elimination of overtime hours by
employees, or a change in the retirement plan for employees — and the man-
ager would certainly look at this data. But such decisions must consider
many other factors, such as effects on employee morale and productivity, the
possibility of the union going on strike, legal issues, and so on. In short,
accounting reports provide only part of the information needed for business
decisions, though an essential part for sure.
Making reports clear and straightforward
Needless to say, the internal accounting reports to managers should be clear
and straightforward. The manner of presentation and means of communica-
tion should get the manager’s attention, and a manager should not have to
call the accounting department for explanations.
Designing truly useful management accounting reports is a very challenging
task. Within one business organization, an accounting report may have to be
somewhat different from one profit center to the next. Standardizing account-
ing reports may seem like a good idea but may not be in the best interests of
the various managers throughout the business — who have different respon-
sibilities and different problems to deal with.
Many of the management accounting reports that I’ve seen could be
improved — substantially! Accounting systems pay so much attention to the
demands of preparing external financial statements and tax returns that man-
agers’ needs for good internal reports are often overlooked or ignored. The
accounting reports in many businesses do not speak to the managers receiv-
ing them; the reports are too voluminous and technical and are not focused
on the most urgent and important problems facing the managers. Designing
good internal accounting reports for managers is a challenging task, to be
sure. But every business should take a hard look at its internal management
accounting reports and identify what should be improved.
Watching Budgeting in Action
Suppose you’re the general manager of one of a large company’s several divi-
sions, which is a major profit center of the business. (I discuss profit centers
in Chapter 9.) You have broad authority to run this division, as well as the
responsibility for meeting the financial expectations for your division. To be
214
Part III: Accounting in Managing a Business 

more specific, your profit responsibility is to produce a satisfactory annual
operating profit, which is the amount of earnings before interest and income
tax (EBIT). (Interest and income tax expenses are handled at the headquar-
ters level in the organization.)
The CEO has made clear to you that she expects your division to increase
EBIT during the coming year by about 10 percent, or $256,000 to be exact. In
fact, she has asked you to prepare a budgeted profit report showing your
plan of action for increasing your division’s EBIT by this target amount. She
also has asked you to prepare a summary for the budgeted cash flow from
operating activities based on your profit plan for the coming year.
Figure 10-1 presents the P&L report of your division for the year just ended. The
format of this accounting report follows the profit report template explained in
Chapter 9, which is designed to mark a clear path for understanding profit
behavior and how to increase profit. Note that fixed operating expenses are sep-
arated from the two variable operating expenses. (Your actual reports may
include more detailed information about sales and expenses.) To keep number-
crunching to a minimum, I assume that you sell only one product.
Most businesses, or the major divisions of a large business, sell a mix of sev-
eral different products. General Motors, for example, sells many makes and
models of autos and light trucks, to say nothing about its other products. The
next time you visit your local hardware store, take the time to look at the
number of products on the shelves. The assortment of products sold by a
business and the quantities sold of each that make up its total sales revenue
is referred to as its sales mix. As a general rule, certain products have higher
profit margins than others. Some products may have extremely low profit
margins, so they are called loss leaders.

Chapter 10: Financial Planning, Budgeting, and Control

The marketing strategy for loss leaders is to use them as magnets, so customers
buy your higher profit margin products along with the loss leaders. Shifting the
sales mix to a higher proportion of higher profit margin products has the effect
of increasing the average profit margin on all products sold. (A shift to lower
profit margin products would have the opposite effect, of course.) Budgeting
sales revenue and expenses for the coming year must include any planned shifts
in the company’s sales mix.
Developing your profit strategy 
and budgeted profit report
Being an experienced manager, you know the importance of protecting your
unit margins. Your division sold 260,000 units in the year just ended (see
Figure 10-1). Your margin per unit was $32. If all your costs were to remain the
same next year (you wish!), you could sell 8,000 more units to reach your
$256,000 profit improvement goal:
$256,000 additional margin needed ÷ $32 margin per
unit = 8,000 additional units
The relatively small increase in your sales volume (8,000 additional units ÷
260,000 units = 3.1 percent) should not increase your fixed expenses —
unless you’re already operating at full capacity and would have to increase
warehouse space and delivery capacity to take on even a small increase in
sales volume. But realistically, some or most of your costs will probably
increase next year.
Let’s take this one step at a time. First, we look at your fixed costs for the coming
year. You and your managers, with the assistance of your trusty accounting
staff, have analyzed your fixed expenses line by line for the coming year. Some
of these fixed expenses will actually be reduced or eliminated next year. But the
large majority of these costs will continue next year, and most are subject to
inflation. Based on careful studies and estimates, you and your staff forecast
total fixed operating expenses for next year will be $6,006,000, which is $286,000
more than the year just ended.
Fortunately, you think that your volume-driven variable expenses should not
increase next year. These are mainly transportation costs, and the shipping
industry is in a very competitive, hold-the-price-down mode of operations
that should last through the coming year. The cost per unit shipped should
not increase.
216
Part III: Accounting in Managing a Business 

You have decided to hold the revenue-driven operating expenses at 8 percent
of sales revenue during the coming year, the same as for the year just ended.
These are sales commissions, and you have already announced to your sales
staff that their sales commission percentage will remain the same during the
coming year. On the other hand, your purchasing manager has told you to
plan on a 4 percent product cost increase next year — from $55 per unit to
$57.20 per unit, or an increase of $2.20 per unit.
Summing up to this point, your total fixed expenses will increase $286,000
next year, and the $2.20 forecast product cost will drop your margin per unit
from $32.00 to $29.80 if your sales price does not increase. One way to
achieve your profit goal next year would be to load all the needed increase on
sales volume and keep sales price the same. (I’m not suggesting that this
strategy is a good one, but it serves as a good point of departure.)
So, what would your sales volume have to be next year? Remember: You want
to increase profit $256,000 (orders from on high), and your fixed expenses
will increase $286,000 next year. So, your margin goal for next year is deter-
mined as follows:
$8,320,000 margin for year just ended + $286,000
fixed expenses increase + $256,000 profit
improvement goal = $8,862,000 margin goal
Without bumping sales price, your margin would be only $29.80 per unit next
year. At this margin per unit you will have to sell over 297,000 units:
$8,862,000 total margin goal ÷ $29.80 margin per unit
= 297,383 units sales volume
Compared with the 260,000 units sales volume in the year just ended, you would
have to increase sales by more than 37,000 units, or more than 14 percent.
You and your sales manager conclude that sales volume cannot be increased
14 percent. You’ll have to raise the sales price to compensate for the increase
in product cost and to help cover the fixed cost increases. After much discus-
sion, you and your sales manager decide to increase the sales price 3 percent,
from $100 to $103. Based on the 3 percent sales price increase and the forecast
product cost increase, your unit margin next year would be as follows:
Budgeted Unit Margin Next Year
Sales price
$103.00
Product cost
(57.20)
Revenue-driven operating expenses (@ 8.0%)
(8.24)
Volume-driven operating expenses per unit
   (5.00)
Equals: Margin per unit
$32.56
217
Chapter 10: Financial Planning, Budgeting, and Control

At the budgeted $32.56 margin per unit, you determine the sales volume
needed next year to reach your profit goal as follows:
$8,862,000 total margin goal next year ÷ $32.56
margin per unit = 272,174 units sales volume
This sales volume is about 5 percent higher than last year (12,174 additional
units over the 260,000 sales volume last year = about a 5 percent increase).
You decide to go with the 3 percent sales price increase combined with the 5
percent sales volume growth as your official budget plan. Accordingly, you for-
ward your budgeted profit report for the coming year to the CEO. Figure 10-2
summarizes this profit budget for the coming year, with comparative figures for
the year just ended.
The main page of your budgeted profit report is supplemented with appropriate
schedules to provide additional detail about sales by types of customers and
other relevant information. Also, your budgeted profit plan is broken down into
quarters (perhaps months) to provide benchmarks for comparing actual perfor-
mance during the year against your budgeted targets and timetable.
Budgeting cash flow for the coming year
The budgeted profit plan (refer to Figure 10-2) is the main focus of attention,
but the CEO also requests that all divisions present a budgeted cash flow from
operating activities for the coming year. Remember: The profit you’re respon-
sible for as general manager of the division is the amount of earnings before
interest and income tax (EBIT).

Part III: Accounting in Managing a Business 

Chapter 6 explains that increases in accounts receivable, inventory, and pre-
paid expenses hurt cash flow from operating activities and that increases in
accounts payable and accrued liabilities help cash flow. In reading the bud-
geted profit report for the coming year (refer to Figure 10-2), you see that vir-
tually every budgeted figure for the coming year is higher than the figure for
the year just ended. Therefore, your operating assets and liabilities will
increase at the higher sales revenue and expense levels next year — unless
you can implement changes to prevent the increases.
For example, sales revenue increases from $26,000,000 to the budgeted
$28,033,968 next year (refer to Figure 10-2) — an increase of $2,033,968. Your
accounts receivable balance was five weeks of annual sales last year. Do you
plan to tighten up the credit terms offered to customers next year — a year in
which you will raise the sales price and also plan to increase sales volume? I
doubt it. More likely, you will attempt to keep your accounts receivable bal-
ance at five weeks of annual sales.
Assume that you decide to offer your customers the same credit terms next
year. Thus, the increase in sales revenue will cause accounts receivable to
increase by $195,574:
5/52 × $2,033,968 sales revenue increase = $195,574
accounts receivable increase
Last year, inventory was 13 weeks of annual cost of goods sold expense. You
may be in the process of implementing inventory reduction techniques. If you
really expect to reduce the average time inventory will be held in stock
before being sold, you should inform your accounting staff so that they can
include this key change in the balance sheet and cash flow models.
Otherwise, they will assume that the past ratios for these vital connections
will continue next year.
Assuming your inventory holding period remains the same, your inventory
balance will increase more than $317,000:
13/52 × $1,268,378 cost of goods sold expense
increase = $317,055 inventory increase
Figure 10-3 presents a brief summary of your budgeted cash flow from operat-
ing activities based on the information given for this example and using your
historical ratios for short-term assets and liabilities driven by sales and
expenses. Note: Increases in accrued interest payable and income tax
payable are not included in your budgeted cash flow. Your profit responsibil-
ity ends at the operating profit line, or earnings before interest and income
tax expenses.
219
Chapter 10: Financial Planning, Budgeting, and Control

You submit this budgeted cash flow from operating activities (see Figure 10-3)
to headquarters. Top management expects you to control the increases in your
operating assets and liabilities so that the actual cash flow generated by your
division next year comes in on target. The cash flow of your division (minus,
perhaps, a small amount needed to increase the working cash balance held by
your division) will be transferred to the central treasury of the business.
Headquarters will be planning on you generating about $3.2 million cash flow
during the coming year.
Considering Capital Expenditures 
and Other Cash Needs
This chapter focuses on profit budgeting for the coming year and budgeting
the cash flow from that profit. These are the two hardcore components of busi-
ness budgeting, but not the whole story. Another key element of the budgeting
process is to prepare a capital expenditures budget for your division that goes
to top management for review and approval. A business has to take a hard look
at its long-term operating assets — in particular, the capacity, condition, and
efficiency of these resources — and decide whether it needs to expand and
modernize its property, plant, and equipment.
In most cases, a business needs to invest substantial sums of money in pur-
chasing new fixed assets or retrofitting and upgrading its old fixed assets.
These long-term investments require major cash outlays. So, each division of
a business prepares a formal list of the fixed assets to be purchased, con-
structed, and upgraded. The money for these major outlays comes from the
central treasury of the business. Accordingly, the overall capital expenditures

budget goes to the highest levels in the organization for review and final
approval. The chief financial officer, the CEO, and the board of directors of
the business go over a capital expenditure budget request with a fine-toothed
comb (or at least they should).
At the company-wide level, the financial officers merge the profit and cash
flow budgets of all profit centers and cost centers of the business. (A cost
center is an organizational unit that does not generate revenue, such as the
legal and accounting departments.) The budgets submitted by one or more of
the divisions may be returned for revision before final approval is given. One
main concern is whether the collective cash flow total from all the units pro-
vides enough money for the capital expenditures that will be made during the
coming year — and to meet the other demands for cash, such as for cash dis-
tributions from profit. The business may have to raise more capital from debt
or equity sources during the coming year to close the gap between cash flow
from operating activities and its needs for cash. This is a central topic in the
field of business finance and beyond the coverage of this book.
221
Chapter 10: Financial Planning, Budgeting, and Control
Business budgeting versus government budgeting:
Only the name is the same
Business and government budgeting are more
different than alike. Government budgeting is
preoccupied with allocating scarce resources
among many competing demands. From federal
agencies down to local school districts, govern-
ment entities have only so much revenue avail-
able. They have to make very difficult choices
regarding how to spend their limited tax revenue.
Formal budgeting is legally required for almost
all government entities. First, a budget request
is submitted. After money is appropriated, the
budget document becomes legally binding on
the government agency. Government budgets
are legal straitjackets; the government entity
has to stay within the amounts appropriated for
each expenditure category. Any changes from
the established budgets need formal approval
and are difficult to get through the system.
A business is not legally required to use budget-
ing. A business can implement and use its budget
as it pleases, and it can even abandon its budget
in midstream. Unlike the government, the revenue
of a business is not constrained; a business can
do many things to increase sales revenue. A busi-
ness can pass its costs to its customers in the
sales prices it charges. In contrast, government
has to raise taxes to spend more (except for fed-
eral deficit spending, of course).

Cost Concepts and Conundrums
In This Chapter
 Determining costs: The second most important thing accountants do
 Appreciating the different needs for cost information
 Contrasting costs for understanding them better
 Determining product cost for manufacturers
 Padding profit by manufacturing too many products
M
easuring costs is the second most important thing accountants do,
right after measuring profit. (Well, the Internal Revenue Service might
think that measuring taxable income is the most important.) But really, can
measuring a cost be very complicated? You just take numbers off a purchase
invoice and call it a day, right? Not if your business manufactures the products
you sell — that’s for sure! In this chapter, I demonstrate that a cost, any cost,
is not as obvious and clear-cut as you may think. Yet, obviously, costs are
extremely important to businesses and other organizations.
Consider an example close to home: Suppose you just returned from the gro-
cery store with several items in the bag. What’s the cost of the loaf of bread you
bought? Should you include the sales tax? Should you include the cost of gas
you used driving to the store? Should you include some amount of depreciation
expense on your car? Suppose you returned some aluminum cans for recycling
while you were at the grocery store, and you were paid a small amount for the
cans. Should you subtract this amount against the total cost of your purchases?
Or should you subtract the amount directly against the cost of only the sodas in
aluminum cans that you bought? And, is cost the before-tax cost? In other
words, is your cost equal to the amount of income you had to earn before
income tax so that you had enough after-tax income to buy the items?
These questions about the cost of your groceries are interesting (well, to me
at least). But you don’t really have to come up with definite answers for such
questions in managing your personal financial affairs. Individuals don’t have
to keep cost records of their personal expenditures, other than what’s needed
for their annual income tax returns. In contrast, businesses must carefully record
all their costs correctly so that profit can be determined each period, and so that
managers have the information they need to make decisions and to make a
profit.

224
Part III: Accounting in Managing a Business 
Looking down the Road to 
the Destination of Costs
All businesses that sell products must know their product costs — in other
words, the costs of each and every item they sell. Companies that manufac-
ture the products they sell — as opposed to distributors and retailers of
products — have many problems in figuring out their product costs. Two
examples of manufactured products are a new Cadillac just rolling off the
assembly line at General Motors and a copy of my book, Accounting For
Dummies, 4th Edition, hot off the printing presses.
Most production (manufacturing) processes are fairly complex, so product cost
accounting for manufacturers is fairly complex; every step in the production
process has to be tracked carefully from start to finish. Many manufacturing
costs cannot be directly matched with particular products; these are called indi-
rect costs. To arrive at the full cost of each product manufactured, accountants
devise methods for allocating indirect production costs to specific products.
Surprisingly, generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) provide very
little authoritative guidance for measuring product cost. Therefore, manufactur-
ing businesses have more than a little leeway regarding how to determine their
product costs. Even businesses in the same industry — Ford versus General
Motors, for example — may use different product cost accounting methods.
Accountants determine many other costs, in addition to product costs:
 The costs of departments, regional distribution centers, and other
organizational units of the business
 The cost of the retirement plan for the company’s employees
 The cost of marketing programs and advertising campaigns
 The cost of restructuring the business or the cost of a major recall of
products sold by the business, when necessary
A common refrain among accountants is “different costs for different purposes.”
True enough, but at its core, cost accounting serves two broad purposes: mea-
suring profit and providing relevant information to managers for planning,
control, and decision-making. 
In my experience, people are inclined to take cost numbers for granted, as if
they were handed down on stone tablets. The phrase actual cost often gets
tossed around without a clear definition. An actual cost depends entirely on
the particular methods used to measure the cost. I can assure you that these
cost measurement methods have more in common with the scores from
judges in an ice skating competition than the times clocked in a Formula One
auto race. Many arbitrary choices are behind every cost number you see.

There’s no one-size-fits-all definition of cost, and there’s no one correct and
“best-in-all-circumstances” method of measuring cost.
The conundrum is that, in spite of the inherent ambiguity in determining
costs, we need exact amounts for costs. In order to understand the income
statement and balance sheet that managers use in making their decisions, they
need to understand a little bit about the choices an accountant has to make in
measuring costs. Some cost accounting methods result in conservative profit
numbers; other methods boost profit, at least in the short run.
This chapter covers cost concepts and cost measurement methods that apply to
all businesses, as well as basic product cost accounting of manufacturers. I dis-
cuss how a manufacturer could be fooling around with its production output to
manipulate product cost for the purpose of artificially boosting its profit figure.
(Service businesses encounter their own problems in allocating their operating
costs for assessing the profitability of their separate sales revenue sources.)
Are Costs Really That Important?
Without good cost information, a business operates in the dark. Cost data is
needed for the following purposes:
 Setting sales prices: The common method for setting sales prices (known
as cost-plus or markup on cost) starts with cost and then adds a certain
percentage. If you don’t know exactly how much a product costs, you
can’t be as shrewd and competitive in your pricing as you need to be.
Even if sales prices are dictated by other forces and not set by managers,
managers need to compare sales prices against product costs and other
costs that should be matched against each sales revenue source.
 Formulating a legal defense against charges of predatory pricing prac-
tices: Many states have laws prohibiting businesses from selling below
cost except in certain circumstances. And a business can be sued under
federal law for charging artificially low prices intended to drive its com-
petitors out of business. Be prepared to prove that your lower pricing is
based on lower costs and not on some illegitimate purpose.
 Measuring gross margin: Investors and managers judge business perfor-
mance by the bottom-line profit figure. This profit figure depends on the
gross margin figure you get when you subtract your cost of goods sold
expense from your sales revenue. Gross margin (also called gross profit) is
the first profit line in the income statement (see Figures 4-1 and 9-1, as
well as Figure 11-1 later in this chapter, for examples). If gross margin is
wrong, bottom-line net income is wrong — no two ways about it. The cost
of goods sold expense depends on having correct product costs (see
“Assembling the Product Cost of Manufacturers” later in this chapter).
225
Chapter 11: Cost Concepts and Conundrums   

 Valuing assets: The balance sheet reports cost values for many (though
not all) assets. To understand the balance sheet you should understand
the cost basis of its inventory and certain other assets. See Chapter 5 for
more about assets and how asset values are reported in the balance
sheet (also called the statement of financial condition).
 Making optimal choices: You often must choose one alternative over
others in making business decisions. The best alternative depends heav-
ily on cost factors, and you have to be careful to distinguish relevant
costs from irrelevant costs, as I describe in the section “Relevant versus
irrelevant costs,” later in this chapter.
In most situations, the book value of a fixed asset is an irrelevant cost. Say
book value is $35,000 for a machine used in the manufacturing operations
of the business. This is the amount of original cost that has not yet been
charged to depreciation expense since it was acquired, and it may seem
quite relevant. However, in deciding between keeping the old machine or
replacing it with a newer, more efficient machine, the disposable value of
the old machine is the relevant amount, not the undepreciated cost bal-
ance of the asset. Suppose the old machine has only a $20,000 salvage
value at this time; this is the relevant cost for the alternative of keeping it
for use in the future — not the $35,000 that hasn’t been depreciated yet. In
order to keep using it, the business forgoes the $20,000 it could get by sell-
ing the asset, and this $20,000 is the relevant cost in this decision situation.
Making decisions involves looking forward at the future cash flows of each
alternative — not looking backward at historical-based cost values.
Becoming More Familiar with Costs
The following sections explain important cost distinctions that managers
should understand in making decisions and exercising control. Also, these cost
distinctions help managers better appreciate the cost figures that accountants
attach to products that are manufactured or purchased by the business.
Retailers (such as Wal-Mart or Costco) purchase products in a condition ready
for sale to their customers — although the products have to be removed from
shipping containers, and a retailer does a little work making the products
presentable for sale and putting the products on display. Manufacturers don’t
have it so easy; their product costs have to be “manufactured” in the sense that
the accountants have to accumulate various production costs and compute
the cost per unit for every product manufactured. I focus on the special cost
concerns of manufacturers in the upcoming section “Assembling the Product
Cost of Manufacturers.”

227
Chapter 11: Cost Concepts and Conundrums   
Accounting versus economic costs
Accountants focus mainly on actual costs
(though they disagree regarding how exactly to
measure these costs). Actual costs are rooted
in the actual, or historical, transactions and
operations of a business. Accountants also
determine budgeted costs for businesses that
prepare budgets (see Chapter 10), and they
develop standard costs that serve as yardsticks
to compare with the actual costs of a business.
Other concepts of cost are found in economic
theory. You encounter a variety of economic
cost terms when reading The Wall Street
Journal, as well as in many business discus-
sions and deliberations. Don’t reveal your igno-
rance of the following cost terms:
 Opportunity cost: The amount of income (or
other measurable benefit) given up when
you follow a better course of action. For
example, say that you quit your $50,000 job,
invest $200,000 to start a new business, and
end up netting $80,000 in your new business
for the year. Suppose also that you would
have earned 5 percent on the $200,000 (a
total of $10,000) if you’d kept the money in
whatever investment you took it from. So
you gave up a $50,000 salary and $10,000 in
investment income with your course of
action; your opportunity cost is $60,000.
Subtract that figure from what your actual
course of action netted you — $80,000 —
and you end up with a “real” economic
profit of $20,000. Your income is $20,000
better by starting your new business
according to economic theory.
 Marginal cost: The incremental, out-of-
pocket outlay required for taking a particu-
lar course of action. Generally speaking, it’s
the same thing as a variable cost (see
“Fixed versus variable costs,” later in this
chapter). Marginal costs are important, but
in actual practice managers must recover
fixed (or nonmarginal) costs as well as mar-
ginal costs through sales revenue in order
to remain in business for any extent of time.
Marginal costs are most relevant for ana-
lyzing one-time ventures, which don’t last
over the long-term.
 Replacement cost: The estimated amount it
would take today to purchase an asset that
the business already owns. The longer ago
an asset was acquired, the more likely its
current replacement cost is higher than its
original cost. Economists are of the opinion
that current replacement costs are relevant
in making rational economic decisions. For
insuring assets against fire, theft, and nat-
ural catastrophes, the current replacement
costs of the assets are clearly relevant.
Other than for insurance, however, replace-
ment costs are not on the front burners of
decision-making — except in situations in
which one alternative being seriously con-
sidered actually involves replacing assets.
 Imputed cost: An ideal, or hypothetical, cost
number that is used as a benchmark or yard-
stick against which actual costs are com-
pared. Two examples are standard costs and
the cost of capital. Standard costs are set in
advance for the manufacture of products
during the coming period, and then actual
costs are compared against standard costs
to identify significant variances. The cost of
capital is the weighted average of the inter-
est rate on debt capital and a target rate of
return that should be earned on equity capi-
tal. The economic value added (EVA) method
compares a business’s cost of capital
against its actual return on capital, to deter-
mine whether the business did better or
worse than the benchmark.
For the most part, these types of cost aren’t
reflected in financial reports. I’ve included them
here to familiarize you with terms you’re likely
to see in the financial press and hear on finan-
cial talk shows. Business managers toss these
terms around a lot.

I cannot exaggerate the importance of correct product costs (for businesses
that sell products, of course). The total cost of goods (products) sold is the first,
and usually the largest, expense deducted from sales revenue in measuring profit.
The bottom-line profit amount reported in a business’s income statement depends
heavily on whether its product costs have been measured properly during that
period. Also, keep in mind that product cost is the value for the inventory asset
reported in the balance sheet of a business. (For a balance sheet example see
Figure 5-2.)
Direct versus indirect costs
You might say that the starting point for any sort of cost analysis, and particu-
larly for accounting for the product costs of manufacturers, is to clearly distin-
guish between direct and indirect costs. Direct costs are easy to match with a
process or product, whereas indirect costs are more distant and have to be
allocated to a process or product. Here are more details:
 Direct costs: Can be clearly attributed to one product or product line, or
one source of sales revenue, or one organizational unit of the business,
or one specific operation in a process. An example of a direct cost in the
book publishing industry is the cost of the paper that a book is printed
on; this cost can be squarely attached to one particular phase of the
book production process.
 Indirect costs: Are far removed from and cannot be naturally attached
to specific products, organizational units, or activities. A book pub-
lisher’s phone bill is a cost of doing business but can’t be tied down to
just one step in the book editorial and production process. The salary of
the purchasing officer who selects the paper for all the books is another
example of a cost that is indirect to the production of particular books.
Each business must determine a method of allocating indirect costs to dif-
ferent products, sources of sales revenue, organizational units, and so on.
Most allocation methods are far from perfect and, in the final analysis, end
up being arbitrary to one degree or another. Business managers should
always keep an eye on the allocation methods used for indirect costs and
take the cost figures produced by these methods with a grain of salt. If I
were called in as an expert witness in a court trial involving costs, the first
thing I’d do is critically analyze the allocation methods used by the busi-
ness for its indirect costs. If I were on the side of the defendant, I’d do my
best to defend the allocation methods. If I were on the side of the plaintiff,
I’d do my best to discredit the allocation methods — there are always
grounds for criticism.
228
Part III: Accounting in Managing a Business 

The cost of filling the gas tank as I drive from Denver to San Diego and back
to consult with my coauthor and son, Tage, about the book we wrote
together, Small Business Financial Management Kit For Dummies (Wiley), is a
direct cost of making the trip. The annual auto license plate fee that I pay to
the state of Colorado is an indirect cost of the trip, although it is a direct cost
of having the car available during the year.
Fixed versus variable costs
If your business sells 100 more units of a certain item, some of your costs
increase accordingly, but others don’t budge one bit. This distinction
between variable and fixed costs is crucial:
 Variable costs: Increase and decrease in proportion to changes in sales
or production level. Variable costs generally remain the same per unit of
product, or per unit of activity. Additional units manufactured or sold
cause variable costs to increase in concert. Fewer units manufactured or
sold result in variable costs going down in concert.
 Fixed costs: Remain the same over a relatively broad range of sales volume
or production output. Fixed costs are like a dead weight on the business.
Its total fixed costs for the period are a hurdle it must overcome by selling
enough units at high enough margins per unit in order to avoid a loss and
move into the profit zone. (Chapter 9 explains the break-even point, which
is the level of sales needed to cover fixed costs for the period.)
Note: The distinction between variable and fixed costs is essential for under-
standing and analyzing profit behavior, which I explain in Chapter 9.
Relevant versus irrelevant costs
Not every cost is important to every decision a manager needs to make.
Hence the distinction between relevant and irrelevant costs:
 Relevant costs: Costs that should be considered and included in your
analysis when deciding on a future course of action. Relevant costs are
future costs — costs that you would incur, or bring upon yourself, depend-
ing on which course of action you take. For example, say that you want to
increase the number of books that your business produces next year in
order to increase your sales revenue, but the cost of paper has just shot
up. Should you take the cost of paper into consideration? Absolutely —
that cost will affect your bottom-line profit and may negate any increase
in sales volume that you experience (unless you increase the sales
price). The cost of paper is a relevant cost.
229
Chapter 11: Cost Concepts and Conundrums   

 Irrelevant (or sunk) costs: Costs that should be disregarded when deciding
on a future course of action; if brought into the analysis, these costs could
cause you to make the wrong decision. An irrelevant cost is a vestige of the
past — that money is gone. For this reason, irrelevant costs are also called
sunk costs. For example, suppose that your supervisor tells you to expect a
slew of new hires next week. All your staff members use computers now,
but you have a bunch of typewriters gathering dust in the supply room.
Should you consider the cost paid for those typewriters in your decision to
buy computers for all the new hires? Absolutely not — that cost should
have been written off and is no match for the cost you’d pay in productivity
(and morale) for new employees who are forced to use typewriters.
Generally speaking, fixed costs are irrelevant when deciding on a future course
of action, assuming that they’re truly fixed and can’t be increased or decreased
over the short term. Most variable costs are relevant because they depend
on which alternative is selected.
Although fixed costs themselves are usually irrelevant in decision making, these
costs often indicate something about a business’s capacity — how much building
space it has, how many machine-hours are available for use, how many hours of
labor can be worked, and so on. Managers have to figure out the best way to uti-
lize these capacities. For example, suppose your retail business pays an annual
building rent of $200,000, which is a fixed cost (unless the rental contract with the
landlord has a rent escalation clause based on sales revenue). The rent, which
gives the business the legal right to occupy the building, provides 15,000 square
feet of retail and storage space. You should figure out which sales mix of products
will generate the highest total margin — equal to total sales revenue less total
variable costs of making the sales, including the costs of the goods sold and all
variable costs driven by sales revenue and sales volume.
Actual, budgeted, and standard costs
The actual costs a business incurs may differ (though we hope not significantly)
from its budgeted and standard costs:
 Actual costs: Historical costs, based on actual transactions and operations
for the period just ended, or going back to earlier periods. Financial state-
ment accounting is mainly (though not entirely) based on a business’s
actual transactions and operations; the basic approach to determining
annual profit is to record the financial effects of actual transactions and
allocate historical costs to the periods benefited by the costs.
 Budgeted costs: Future costs, for transactions and operations expected
to take place over the coming period, based on forecasts and established
goals. Fixed costs are budgeted differently than variable costs. For example,
if sales volume is forecast to increase by 10 percent, variable costs will
definitely increase accordingly, but fixed costs may or may not need to be
230
Part III: Accounting in Managing a Business 

increased to accommodate the volume increase. In Chapter 10, I explain
the budgeting process and budgeted financial statements.
 Standard costs: Costs, primarily in the area of manufacturing, that are
carefully engineered based on detailed analysis of operations and forecast
costs for each component or step in an operation. Developing standard costs
for variable production costs is relatively straightforward because most are
direct costs. In contrast, most fixed costs are indirect, and standard costs for
fixed costs are necessarily based on more arbitrary methods (see “Direct
versus indirect costs,” earlier in this chapter). Note: Some variable costs
are indirect and have to be allocated to specific products in order to come
up with a full (total) standard cost of the product.
Product versus period costs
Some costs are linked to particular products, and others are not:
 Product costs: Manufacturing costs attached directly or allocated to
particular products. The cost is recorded in the inventory asset account
and stays in that asset account until the product is sold, at which time
the cost goes into the cost of goods sold expense account. (See Chapters 4
and 5 for more about these accounts; also, see Chapter 7 for alternative
methods for selecting which product costs are first charged to the cost of
goods sold expense.)
For example, the cost of a new Ford Focus sitting on a car dealer’s show-
room floor is a product cost. The dealer keeps the cost in the inventory
asset account until you buy the car, at which point the dealer charges
the cost to the cost of goods sold expense.
 Period costs: Costs that are not attached to particular products. These
costs do not spend time in the “waiting room” of inventory. Period costs
are recorded as expenses immediately; unlike product costs, period costs
don’t pass through the inventory account first. Advertising costs, for
example, are accounted for as period costs and recorded immediately in
an expense account. Also, research and development costs are treated as
period costs (with some exceptions).
Separating product costs and period costs is particularly important for
manufacturing businesses, as you find out in the following section.
231
Chapter 11: Cost Concepts and Conundrums   

Assembling the Product Cost 
of Manufacturers
Businesses that manufacture products have several additional cost problems
to deal with, compared with retailers and distributors. I use the term manufac-
ture in the broadest sense: Automobile makers assemble cars, beer companies
brew beer, automobile gasoline companies refine oil, DuPont makes products
through chemical synthesis, and so on. Retailers (also called merchandisers)
and distributors, on the other hand, buy products in a condition ready for
resale to the end consumer. For example, Levi Strauss manufactures clothing,
and Macy’s is a retailer that buys from Levi Strauss and sells the clothes to the
public. The following sections describe costs unique to manufacturers.
Minding manufacturing costs
Manufacturing costs consist of four basic types:
 Raw materials (also called direct materials): What a manufacturer buys
from other companies to use in the production of its own products. For
example, General Motors buys tires from Goodyear (or other tire manu-
facturers) that then become part of GM’s cars.
 Direct labor: The employees who work on the production line.
 Variable overhead: Indirect production costs that increase or decrease as
the quantity produced increases or decreases. An example is the cost of
electricity that runs the production equipment: You pay for the electricity
for the whole plant, not machine by machine, so you can’t attach this cost
to one particular part of the process. But if you increase or decrease the
use of those machines, the electricity cost increases or decreases accord-
ingly. (In contrast, the monthly utility bill for a company’s office and sales
space probably is fixed for all practical purposes.)
 Fixed overhead: Indirect production costs that do not increase or
decrease as the quantity produced increases or decreases. These fixed
costs remain the same over a fairly broad range of production output
levels (see “Fixed versus variable costs,” earlier in this chapter). Three
significant fixed manufacturing costs are
• Salaries for certain production employees who don’t work directly
on the production line, such as a vice president, safety inspectors,
security guards, accountants, and shipping and receiving workers.
• Depreciation of production buildings, equipment, and other manu-
facturing fixed assets.
• Occupancy costs, such as building insurance, property taxes, and
heating and lighting charges.
232
Part III: Accounting in Managing a Business 

Figure 11-1 presents an annual income statement for a manufacturer and
includes information about its manufacturing costs for the year. The cost of
goods sold expense depends directly on the product cost from the summary
of manufacturing costs that appears below the income statement. A business
may manufacture 100 or 1,000 different products, or even more, and the busi-
ness must prepare a summary of manufacturing costs for each product. To
keep our example easy to follow (but still realistic), Figure 11-1 presents a sce-
nario for a one-product manufacturer. The multi-product manufacturer has
some additional accounting problems, but I can’t provide that level of detail
here. This example illustrates the fundamental accounting problems and
methods of all manufacturers.

Chapter 11: Cost Concepts and Conundrums   

The information in the manufacturing costs summary below the income
statement (see Figure 11-1) is highly confidential and for management eyes
only. Competitors would love to know this information. A company may
enjoy a significant cost advantage over its competitors and definitely does
not want its cost data to get into their hands.
Classifying costs properly
Two vexing issues rear their ugly heads in determining product cost for a
manufacturer:
 Drawing a bright line between manufacturing costs and non-
manufacturing operating costs: The key difference here is that manufac-
turing costs are categorized as product costs, whereas non-manufacturing
operating costs are categorized as period costs (refer to “Product versus
period costs,” earlier in this chapter). In calculating product costs, you
include only manufacturing costs and not other costs. Period costs are
recorded right away as expenses — either in variable operating expenses
or fixed operating expenses (see Figure 11-1). Here are some examples of
each type of cost:
• Wages paid to production line workers are a clear-cut example of a
manufacturing cost.
• Salaries paid to salespeople are a marketing cost and are not part
of product cost; marketing costs are treated as period costs, which
means they are recorded immediately to expense of the period.
• Depreciation on production equipment is a manufacturing cost,
but depreciation on the warehouse in which products are stored
after being manufactured is a period cost.
• Moving the raw materials and partially-completed products through
the production process is a manufacturing cost, but transporting the
finished products from the warehouse to customers is a period cost.
The accumulation of direct and indirect production costs starts at the
beginning of the manufacturing process and stops at the end of the produc-
tion line. In other words, product cost stops at the end of the production
line — every cost up to that point should be included as a manufacturing
cost.
If you misclassify some manufacturing costs as operating costs, your
product cost calculation will be too low (see the following section,
“Calculating product cost”). Also, the Internal Revenue Service may come
knocking at your door if it suspects that you deliberately (or even inno-
cently) misclassified manufacturing costs as non-manufacturing costs in
order to minimize your taxable income.
234
Part III: Accounting in Managing a Business 

 Allocating indirect costs among different products: Indirect manufac-
turing costs must be allocated among the products produced during
the period. The full product cost includes both direct and indirect
manufacturing costs. Creating a completely satisfactory allocation
method is difficult; the process ends up being somewhat arbitrary, but
it must be done to determine product cost. Managers should understand
how indirect manufacturing costs are allocated among products (and,
for that matter, how indirect non-manufacturing costs are allocated
among organizational units and profit centers). Managers should also
keep in mind that every allocation method is arbitrary and that a different
allocation method may be just as convincing. (See the sidebar “Allocating
indirect costs is as simple as ABC — not!”)
235
Chapter 11: Cost Concepts and Conundrums   
Allocating indirect costs is 
as simple as ABC — not!
Accountants for manufacturers have developed
many methods and schemes for allocating indi-
rect overhead costs, most of which are based
on a common denominator of production activ-
ity, such as direct labor hours or machine hours.
A different method has received a lot of press
recently: activity-based costing (ABC).
With the ABC method, you identify each sup-
porting activity in the production process and
collect costs into a separate pool for each iden-
tified activity. Then you develop a measure for
each activity — for example, the measure for the
engineering department may be hours, and the
measure for the maintenance department may
be square feet. You use the activity measures as
cost drivers to allocate costs to products.
The idea is that the engineering department
doesn’t come cheap; including the cost of their
slide rules and pocket protectors, as well as their
salaries and benefits, the total cost per hour for
those engineers could be $200 or more. The logic
of the ABC cost-allocation method is that the
engineering cost per hour should be allocated on
the basis of the number of hours (the driver)
required by each product. So if Product A needs
200 hours of the engineering department’s time
and Product B is a simple product that needs only
20 hours of engineering, you allocate ten times as
much of the engineering cost to Product A. In
similar fashion, suppose the cost of the mainte-
nance department is $20 per square foot per year.
If Product C uses twice as much floor space as
Product D, it would be charged with twice as
much maintenance cost.
The ABC method has received much praise for
being better than traditional allocation methods,
especially for management decision making.
But keep in mind that this method still requires
rather arbitrary definitions of cost drivers, and
having too many different cost drivers, each
with its own pool of costs, is not too practical.
Cost allocation always involves arbitrary meth-
ods. Managers should be aware of which meth-
ods are being used and should challenge a
method if they think that it’s misleading and
should be replaced with a better (though still
somewhat arbitrary) method. I don’t mean to put
too fine a point on this, but cost allocation
essentially boils down to a “my arbitrary method
is better than your arbitrary method” argument.

Calculating product cost
The basic equation for calculating product cost is as follows (using the exam-
ple of the manufacturer given in Figure 11-1):
$91,200,000 total manufacturing costs ÷ 120,000 units
production output = $760 product cost per unit
Looks pretty straightforward, doesn’t it? Well, the equation itself may be
simple, but the accuracy of the results depends directly on the accuracy of
your manufacturing cost numbers. The business example we’re using in this
chapter manufactures just one product. Even so, a single manufacturing
process can be fairly complex, with hundreds or thousands of steps and
operations. In the real world, where businesses produce multiple products,
your accounting systems must be very complex and extraordinarily detailed
to keep accurate track of all direct and indirect (allocated) manufacturing
costs.
In our example, the business manufactured 120,000 units and sold 110,000
units during the year, and its product cost per unit is $760. The 110,000 total
units sold during the year is multiplied by the $760 product cost to compute
the $83.6 million cost of goods sold expense, which is deducted against the
company’s revenue from selling 110,000 units during the year. The company’s
total manufacturing costs for the year were $91.2 million, which is $7.6 mil-
lion more than the cost of goods sold expense. The remainder of the total
annual manufacturing costs is recorded as an increase in the company’s
inventory asset account, to recognize that 10,000 units manufactured this
year are awaiting sale in the future. In Figure 11-1, note that the $760 product
cost per unit is applied both to the 110,000 units sold and to the 10,000 units
added to inventory.
Note: The product cost per unit for our example business is determined for
the entire year. In actual practice, manufacturers calculate their product
costs monthly or quarterly. The computation process is the same, but the 
frequency of doing the computation varies from business to business.
Product costs likely will vary each successive period the costs are deter-
mined. Because the product costs vary from period to period, the business
must choose which cost of goods sold and inventory cost method to use. (If
product cost happened to remain absolutely flat and constant period to
period, the different methods would yield the same results.) Chapter 7
explains the alternative accounting methods for determining cost of goods
sold expense and inventory cost value.
236
Part III: Accounting in Managing a Business 

Examining fixed manufacturing 
costs and production capacity
Product cost consists of two very distinct components: variable manufacturing
costs and fixed manufacturing costs. In Figure 11-1, note that the company’s
variable manufacturing costs are $410 per unit, and its fixed manufacturing
costs are $350 per unit. Now, what if the business had manufactured ten more
units? Its total variable manufacturing costs would have been $4,100 higher.
The actual number of units produced drives variable costs, so even one more
unit would have caused the variable costs to increase. But the company’s total
fixed costs would have been the same if it had produced ten more units, or
10,000 more units for that matter. Variable manufacturing costs are bought on a
per-unit basis, as it were, whereas fixed manufacturing costs are bought in bulk
for the whole period.
Fixed manufacturing costs are needed to provide production capacity — the
people and physical resources needed to manufacture products — for the
period. After the business has the production plant and people in place for
the year, its fixed manufacturing costs cannot be easily scaled down. The
business is stuck with these costs over the short run. It has to make the best
use it can from its production capacity.
Production capacity is a critical concept for business managers to stay focused
on. You need to plan your production capacity well ahead of time because you
need plenty of lead-time to assemble the right people, equipment, land, and
buildings. When you have the necessary production capacity in place, you want
to make sure that you’re making optimal use of that capacity. The fixed costs of
production capacity remain the same even as production output increases or
decreases, so you may as well make optimal use of the capacity provided by
those fixed costs. For example, you’re recording the same depreciation amount
on your machinery regardless of how you actually use those machines, so you
should be sure to optimize the use of those machines (within limits, of course —
overworking the machines to the point where they break down won’t do you
much good).
The burden rate
The fixed cost component of product cost is called the burden rate. In our man-
ufacturing example, the burden rate is computed as follows (see Figure 11-1 
for data):
$42,000,000 fixed manufacturing costs for period ÷
120,000 units production output for period = 
$350 burden rate
Note that the burden rate depends on the number divided into total fixed
manufacturing costs for the period — that is, the production output for the
period.
237
Chapter 11: Cost Concepts and Conundrums   

Now, here’s a very important twist on my example: Suppose the company
had manufactured only 110,000 units during the period — equal exactly to
the quantity sold during the year. Its variable manufacturing cost per unit
would have been the same, or $410 per unit. But its burden rate would have
been $381.82 per unit (computed by dividing the $42 million total fixed manu-
facturing costs by the 110,000 units production output). Each unit sold, there-
fore, would have cost $31.82 more simply because the company produced
fewer units. (The burden rate is $381.82 at the 110,000 output level but only
$350 at the 120,000 output level.)
If only 110,000 units were produced, the company’s product cost would have
been $791.82 ($410 variable costs plus the $381.82 burden rate). The com-
pany’s cost of goods sold, therefore, would have been $3.5 million higher for
the year ($31.82 higher product cost × 110,000 units sold). This rather signifi-
cant increase in its cost of goods sold expense is caused by the company pro-
ducing fewer units, even though it produced all the units that it needed for
sales during the year. The same total amount of fixed manufacturing costs is
spread over fewer units of production output.
Idle capacity
The production capacity of the business example in Figure 11-1 is 150,000 units
for the year. However, this business produced only 120,000 units during the
year, which is 30,000 units fewer than it could have. In other words, it operated
at 80 percent of production capacity, which is 20 percent idle capacity:
120,000 units output ÷ 150,000 units capacity = 
80% utilization, or 20% idle capacity
This rate of idle capacity isn’t unusual — the average U.S. manufacturing
plant normally operates at 80 to 85 percent of its production capacity.
The effects of increasing inventory
Looking back at the numbers shown in Figure 11-1, the company’s cost of
goods sold benefited from the fact that it produced 10,000 more units than it
sold during the year. These 10,000 units absorbed $3.5 million of its total
fixed manufacturing costs for the year, and until the units are sold this $3.5
million stays in the inventory asset account (along with the variable manufac-
turing costs, of course). It’s entirely possible that the higher production level
was justified — to have more units on hand for sales growth next year. But
production output can get out of hand, as I discuss in the following section,
“Puffing Profit by Excessive Production.”

Managers (and investors as well) should understand the inventory increase
effects caused by manufacturing more units than are sold during the year. In the
example shown in Figure 11-1, the cost of goods sold expense escaped $3.5 million
of fixed manufacturing costs because the company produced 10,000 more
units than it sold during the year, thus pushing down the burden rate. The
company’s cost of goods sold expense would have been $3.5 million higher if
it had produced just the number of units it sold during the year. The lower
output level would have increased cost of goods sold expense and would
have caused a $3.5 million drop in gross margin and earnings before income
tax. Indeed, earnings before income tax would have been 27 percent lower
($3.5 million ÷ $13.2 million = 27 percent decrease).
239
Chapter 11: Cost Concepts and Conundrums   
The actual costs/actual output method 
and when not to use it
The product cost calculation for the business
example shown in Figure 11-1 is based on the
actual cost/actual output method, in which you
take your actual costs — which may have been
higher or lower than the budgeted costs for the
year — and divide by the actual output for the year.
The actual costs/actual output method is appro-
priate in most situations. However, this method
is not appropriate and would have to be modi-
fied in two extreme situations:
 Manufacturing costs are grossly excessive
or wasteful due to inefficient production
operations: For example, suppose that the
business represented in Figure 11-1 had to
throw away $1.2 million of raw materials
during the year. The $1.2 million should be
removed from the calculation of the raw
material cost per unit. Instead, you treat it as
a period cost — meaning that you take it
directly into expense. Then the cost of goods
sold expense would be based on $750 per
unit instead of $760, which lowers this
expense by $1.1 million (based on the 110,000
units sold). But you still have to record the
$1.2 million expense for wasted raw materi-
als, so EBIT would be $100,000 lower.
 Production output is significantly less than
normal capacity utilization:Suppose that the
Figure 11-1 business produced only 75,000
units during the year but still sold 110,000
units because it was working off a large
inventory carryover from the year before.
Then its production output would be 50 per-
cent instead of 80 percent of capacity. In a
sense, the business wasted half of its pro-
duction capacity, and you can argue that half
of its fixed manufacturing costs should be
charged directly to expense on the income
statement and not included in the calculation
of product cost.

Puffing Profit by Excessive Production
Whenever production output is higher than sales volume, be on guard.
Excessive production can puff up the profit figure. How? Until a product is sold,
the product cost goes in the inventory asset account rather than the cost of
goods sold expense account, meaning that the product cost is counted as a
positive number (an asset) rather than a negative number (an expense). Fixed
manufacturing overhead cost is included in product cost, which means that
this cost component goes into inventory and is held there until the products
are sold later. In short, when you overproduce, more of your total of fixed man-
ufacturing costs for the period is moved to the inventory asset account and
less is moved into cost of goods sold expense for the year.
You need to judge whether an inventory increase is justified. Be aware that
an unjustified increase may be evidence of profit manipulation or just good
old-fashioned management bungling. Either way, the day of reckoning will
come when the products are sold and the cost of inventory becomes cost of
goods sold expense — at which point the cost impacts the bottom line.
Shifting fixed manufacturing 
costs to the future
The business represented in Figure 11-1 manufactured 10,000 more units than
it sold during the year. With variable manufacturing costs at $410 per unit,
the business expended $4.1 million more in variable manufacturing costs
than it would have if it had produced only the 110,000 units needed for its
sales volume. In other words, if the business had produced 10,000 fewer
units, its variable manufacturing costs would have been $4.1 million less —
that’s the nature of variable costs. In contrast, if the company had manufac-
tured 10,000 fewer units, its fixed manufacturing costs would not have been
any less — that’s the nature of fixed costs.
Of its $42 million total fixed manufacturing costs for the year, only $38.5 mil-
lion ended up in the cost of goods sold expense for the year ($350 burden
rate × 110,000 units sold). The other $3.5 million ended up in the inventory
asset account ($350 burden rate × 10,000 units inventory increase). The $3.5
million of fixed manufacturing costs that are absorbed by inventory is shifted
to the future. This amount will not be expensed (charged to cost of goods
sold expense) until the products are sold sometime in the future.
Shifting part of the fixed manufacturing cost for the year to the future may
seem to be accounting slight of hand. It has been argued that the entire
amount of fixed manufacturing costs should be expensed in the year that
240
Part III: Accounting in Managing a Business 

these costs are recorded. (Only variable manufacturing costs would be
included in product cost for units going into the increase in inventory.)
Generally accepted accounting principles require that full product cost (variable
plus fixed manufacturing costs) be used for recording an increase in inventory.
However, as the example in Figure 11-1 shows, producing more than you sell
does boost profit.
Let me be very clear here: I’m not suggesting any hanky-panky in the example
shown in Figure 11-1. Producing 10,000 more units than sales volume during
the year looks — on the face of it — to be reasonable and not out of the ordi-
nary. Yet at the same time, it is naïve to ignore that the business did help its
pretax profit to the amount of $3.5 million by producing 10,000 more units than
it sold. If the business had produced only 110,000 units, equal to its sales volume
for the year, all its fixed manufacturing costs for the year would have gone into
cost of goods sold expense. The expense would have been $3.5 million higher,
and EBIT would have been that much lower.
Cranking up production output
Now let’s consider a more suspicious example. Suppose that the business
manufactured 150,000 units during the year and increased its inventory by
40,000 units. It may be a legitimate move if the business is anticipating a big
jump in sales next year. On the other hand, an inventory increase of 40,000
units in a year in which only 110,000 units were sold may be the result of a
serious overproduction mistake, and the larger inventory may not be needed
next year. In any case, Figure 11-2 shows what happens to production costs
and — more importantly — what happens to the profit lines at the higher
production output level.
The additional 30,000 units (over and above the 120,000 units manufactured
by the business in the original example) cost $410 per unit. (The precise cost
may be a little higher than $410 per unit because as you start crowding pro-
duction capacity, some variable costs per unit may increase a little.) The
business would need $12.3 million more for the additional 30,000 units of pro-
duction output:
$410 variable manufacturing cost per unit × 30,000
additional units produced = $12,300,000 additional
variable manufacturing costs invested in inventory
Again, its fixed manufacturing costs would not have increased, given the
nature of fixed costs. Fixed costs stay put until capacity is increased. Sales
volume, in this scenario, also remains the same.
241
Chapter 11: Cost Concepts and Conundrums   

But check out the business’s EBIT in Figure 11-2: $23.65 million, compared with
$15.95 million in Figure 11-1 — a $7.7 million higher amount, even though sales
volume, sales prices, and operating costs all remain the same. Whoa! What’s
going on here? The simple answer is that the cost of goods sold expense is $7.7
million less than before. But how can cost of goods sold expense be less? The
business sells 110,000 units in both scenarios. And variable manufacturing
costs are $410 per unit in both cases.

Part III: Accounting in Managing a Business 

The culprit is the burden rate component of product cost. In the Figure 11-1
example, total fixed manufacturing costs are spread over 120,000 units of
output, giving a $350 burden rate per unit. In the Figure 11-2 example, total
fixed manufacturing costs are spread over 150,000 units of output, giving a
much lower $280 burden rate, or $70 per unit less. The $70 lower burden rate
multiplied by the 110,000 units sold results in a $7.7 million lower cost of
goods sold expense for the period, a higher pretax profit of the same amount,
and a much improved bottom-line net income.
Being careful when production output 
is out of kilter with sales volume
In the example shown in Figure 11-2, the business produced 150,000 units (full
capacity); therefore, its inventory asset absorbed $7.7 million of the company’s
fixed manufacturing costs for the year, and its cost of goods sold expense for
the year escaped this cost. But get this: Its inventory increased 40,000 units,
which is quite a large increase compared with the annual sales of 110,000 during
the year just ended. Who was responsible for the decision to go full blast and
produce up to production capacity? Do the managers really expect sales to jump
up enough next year to justify the much larger inventory level? If they prove to
be right, they’ll look brilliant. But if the output level was a mistake and sales do
not go up next year . . . they’ll have you-know-what to pay next year, even though
profit looks good this year. An experienced business manager knows to be on
guard when inventory takes such a big jump.
Summing up, the cost of goods sold expense of a manufacturer, and thus its
operating profit, is sensitive to a difference between its sales volume and pro-
duction output during the year. Manufacturing businesses do not generally
discuss or explain in their external financial reports to creditors and owners
why production output is different than sales volume for the year. Financial
report readers are pretty much on their own in interpreting the reasons for
and the effects of under- or over-producing products relative to actual sales
volume for the year. All I can tell you is to keep alert and keep in mind the
profit impact caused by a major disparity between a manufacturer’s produc-
tion output and sale levels for the year.

Part IV
Preparing and
Using Financial
Reports

In this part . . .
F
inancial reports are like newspaper articles. A lot of
activity goes on behind the scenes that you may not
be aware of. In reading a financial report, you see only the
finished product. Chapter 12 gives the inside story of how
financial reports are put together.
Outside investors in a business — the owners who are not
on the inside managing the business — depend on its finan-
cial reports as their main source of information. Chapter 13
explains financial statement ratios that investors use for
interpreting profit performance and financial condition.
Serious investors must know these ratios.
The financial report is the end of the line for the outside
investors and lenders of a business. They can’t call the
business and ask for more information. But the financial
statements are just the starting point for the managers of
the business. Chapter 14 explains the more detailed and
highly confidential accounting information they need for
identifying problems and opportunities.
Chapter 15 explains the reasons for audits of financial
reports by independent CPAs. Investors and lenders defi-
nitely should read the auditor’s report, which is explained
in this chapter. The chapter also discusses the ugly topic
of accounting fraud. Unfortunately, some businesses resort
to accounting fraud, which is not only unethical but illegal.

I
n Chapters 4, 5, and 6, I explain the three primary financial statements of a
business:
 Income statement: Summarizes sales revenue and other income (if any)
and expenses and losses (if any) for the period. It ends with the bottom-
line profit for the period, which most commonly is called net income or
net earnings. (Inside a business this profit performance statement is
commonly called the Profit & Loss, or P&L, report.)
 Balance sheet: Summarizes financial condition at the end of the period, con-
sisting of amounts for assets, liabilities, and owners’ equity at that instant in
time. (Its more formal name is the statement of financial condition.)
 Statement of cash flows: Reports the cash increase or decrease during
the period from profit-making activities (revenue and expenses) and the
reasons this key figure is different than bottom-line net income. It also
summarizes other cash flows during the period from investing and
financing activities.
These three statements, plus the footnotes to the financials and other content,
are packaged into annual financial reports so a business’s investors, lenders,
and other interested parties can keep tabs on the business’s financial health. In
this chapter, I shine a light on the preparation process so you can recognize the
types of decisions that must be made before a financial report hits the streets.

Recognizing Management’s Role
Whether a business is a small private company or a large public corporation,
its annual financial report consists of
 The three basic financial statements: income statement, balance sheet,
and statement of cash flows.
 A statement of changes in owners’ equity (if needed). Although it’s
called a “statement,” this item is more properly described as a supple-
mentary schedule. It reports certain information regarding changes in
owners’ equity accounts during the year that is not included in its three
primary financial statements. (See “Statement of Changes in Owners’
Equity” later in the chapter.)
 And more.
In deciding what “more” means, the business’s CEO and top lieutenants play
an essential role — which they (and outside investors and lenders) should
understand. The CEO does certain critical things before a financial report is
released to the outside world:
1. Confers with the company’s chief financial officer and controller
(chief accountant) to make sure that the latest accounting and finan-
cial reporting standards and requirements have been applied in its
financial report. (The president of a smaller private company may have
to consult with a CPA on these matters.) In recent years, we’ve seen a
high degree of flux in accounting and financial reporting standards and
requirements. The private sector Financial Accounting Standards Board
(FASB) and the governmental regulatory agency, the Securities and
Exchange Commission (SEC), have been very busy in recent years — to
say nothing of the federal Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the creation of
the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board.
A business and its auditors cannot simply assume that the accounting
methods and financial reporting practices that have been used for many
years are still correct and adequate. A business must check carefully
whether it is in full compliance with current accounting standards and
financial reporting requirements.
2. Carefully reviews the disclosures in the financial report. The CEO and
financial officers of the business must make sure that the disclosures — all
information other than the financial statements — are adequate according
to financial reporting standards, and that all the disclosure elements are
truthful but, at the same time, not damaging to the business.
248
Part IV: Preparing and Using Financial Reports 

This disclosure review can be compared with the notion of due diligence,
which is done to make certain that all relevant information is collected,
that the information is accurate and reliable, and that all relevant require-
ments and regulations are being complied with. This step is especially
important for public corporations whose securities (stock shares and
debt instruments) are traded on securities exchanges. Public businesses
fall under the jurisdiction of federal securities laws, which require very
technical and detailed filings with the SEC.
3. Considers whether the financial statement numbers need touching
up. The idea here is to smooth the jagged edges off the company’s year-
to-year profit gyrations or to improve the business’s short-term solvency
picture. Although this can be described as putting your thumb on the
scale, you can also argue that sometimes the scale is a little out of bal-
ance to begin with and the CEO should approve adjusting the financial
statements in order to make them jibe better with the normal circum-
stances of the business.
When I discuss the third step later in this chapter, I’m venturing into a gray area
that accountants don’t much like to talk about. Some topics are, shall I say,
rather delicate. The manager has to strike a balance between the interests of
the business on the one hand and the interests of the owners (investors) and
creditors of the business on the other. The best analogy I can think of is the
advertising done by a business. Advertising should be truthful, but, as I’m sure
you know, businesses have a lot of leeway regarding how to advertise their
products and have been known to engage in hyperbole. Managers exercise the
same freedoms in putting together their financial reports. Financial reports may
have some hype, and managers may put as much positive spin on bad news as
possible without making deceitful and deliberately misleading comments.
Keeping in Mind the Purpose 
of Financial Reporting
Business managers, creditors, and investors read financial reports because these
reports provide information regarding how the business is doing and where it
stands financially. Indeed, these accounting reports are the only source of this
information! The top-level managers of a business, in reviewing the annual financial
report before releasing it outside the business, should keep in mind that a finan-
cial report is designed to answer certain basic financial questions:
 Is the business making a profit or suffering a loss, and how much?
 How do assets stack up against liabilities?
 Where did the business get its capital, and is it making good use of the
money?
249
Chapter 12: Getting a Financial Report Ready for Release

 What is the cash flow from the profit or loss for the period?
 Did the business reinvest all its profit or distribute some of the profit to
owners?
 Does the business have enough capital for future growth?
People read a financial report like a road map — to point the way and check
how the trip is going. Managing and putting money in a business is a financial
journey. A manager is like the driver and must pay attention to all the road signs;
investors and lenders are like the passengers who watch the same road 
signs. Some of the most important road signs are the ratios between sales rev-
enue and expenses and their related assets and liabilities in the balance sheet.
In short, the purpose of financial reporting is to deliver important information
to the lenders and shareowners of the business that they need and are entitled
to receive. Financial reporting is part of the essential contract between a busi-
ness and its lenders and investors. This contract can be stated in a few words:
Give us your money, and we’ll give you the information you need to know
regarding how we’re doing with your money.
Financial reporting is governed by statutory and common law, and it should
be done according to ethical standards. Unfortunately, financial reporting
sometimes falls short of both legal and ethical standards.
Businesses assume that the readers of the financial statements and other
information in their financial reports are fairly knowledgeable about business
and finance in general, and understand basic accounting terminology and
measurement methods in particular. Financial reporting standards and prac-
tices, in other words, take a lot for granted about readers of financial reports.
Don’t expect to find friendly hand holding and helpful explanations in finan-
cial reports. I don’t mean to put you off, but reading financial reports is not
for sissies. You need to sit down with a cup of coffee and be ready for serious
concentration.
Staying on Top of Accounting and
Financial Reporting Standards
Standards and requirements for accounting and financial reporting don’t stand
still. For many years, changes in accounting and financial reporting standards
moved like glaciers — slowly and not too far. But, just like the climate has warmed,
the activity of the accounting and financial reporting authorities has warmed up.
In fact, it’s hard to keep up with the changes.
250
Part IV: Preparing and Using Financial Reports 

Without a doubt, the rash of accounting and financial reporting scandals over
the last two decades or so was one major reason for the step-up in activity 
by the standard setters. The Enron accounting fraud not only brought down a
major international CPA firm (Arthur Andersen) but also led to passage of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and its demanding requirements on public compa-
nies regarding establishing and reporting on internal controls to prevent
financial reporting fraud.
The other major reason for the heightened pace of activity by the standard set-
ters is, in my opinion, the increasing complexity of doing business. When you
look at how business is being conducted these days, you find more and more
complexity — for example, the use of financial derivative contracts and instru-
ments. The legal exposure of businesses has expanded, especially in respect to
environmental laws and regulations. There is a move toward the internationaliza-
tion of accounting and financial reporting standards, as I discuss in Chapter 2.
In my view, the standard setters should be given a lot of credit for their attempts
to deal with the problems that have emerged in recent decades and for trying to
prevent repetition of the problems. But the price of doing so has been a rather
steep increase in the range and rapidity of changes in accounting and financial
reporting standards and requirements. Top-level managers of businesses have
to make sure that the top-level financial and accounting officers of the business
are keeping up with these changes and make sure that their financial reports
follow all current rules and regulations. Managers lean heavily on their chief
financial officers and controllers for keeping in full compliance with accounting
and financial reporting standards.
Making Sure Disclosure Is Adequate
The financial statements are the backbone of a financial report. In fact, a
financial report is not deserving of the name if the three primary financial state-
ments are not included. But a financial report is much more than just the finan-
cial statements; a financial report needs disclosures. Of course, the financial
statements themselves provide disclosure of important financial information
about the business. The term disclosures, however, usually refers to additional
information provided in a financial report.
The CEO of a public corporation, the president of a private corporation, or the
managing partner of a partnership has the primary responsibility to make sure
that the financial statements have been prepared according to U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles (GAAP) — or to international accounting stan-
dards, as the case may be — and that the financial report provides adequate dis-
closure. He or she works with the chief financial officer and controller of the
business to make sure that the financial report meets the standard of adequate
disclosure. (Many smaller businesses hire an independent CPA to advise them
on their financial reports.)
251
Chapter 12: Getting a Financial Report Ready for Release

For a quick survey of disclosures in financial reports, the following distinctions
are helpful:
 Footnotes provide additional information about the basic figures included
in the financial statements. Virtually all financial statements need footnotes
to provide additional information for several of the account balances.
 Supplementary financial schedules and tables to the financial state-
ments provide more details than can be included in the body of financial
statements.
 A wide variety of other information is presented, some of which is
required if the business is a public corporation subject to federal regula-
tions regarding financial reporting to its stockholders. Other information
is voluntary and not strictly required legally or according to GAAP.
Footnotes: Nettlesome but needed
Footnotes appear at the end of the primary financial statements. Within the
financial statements, you see references to particular footnotes. And at the
bottom of each financial statement, you find the following sentence (or words to
this effect): “The footnotes are integral to the financial statements.” You should
read all footnotes for a full understanding of the financial statements, although I
should mention that some footnotes are dense and technical. For example, read
the footnote that explains how a public corporation put the value on its man-
agement stock options in order to record the expense for this component of
management compensation. Then take two aspirin to get rid of your headache.
Footnotes come in two types:
 One or more footnotes are included to identify the major accounting
policies and methods that the business uses. (Chapter 7 explains that a
business must choose among alternative accounting methods for recording
revenue and expenses, and for their corresponding assets and liabilities.)
The business must reveal which accounting methods it uses for booking
its revenue and expenses. In particular, the business must identify its cost
of goods sold expense (and inventory) method and its depreciation
methods. Some businesses have unusual problems regarding the timing
for recording sales revenue, and a footnote should clarify their revenue
recognition method. Other accounting methods that have a material
impact on the financial statements are disclosed in footnotes as well.
 Other footnotes provide additional information and details for many
assets and liabilities. For example, during the asbestos lawsuits that went
on for many years, the businesses that manufactured and sold these
products included long footnotes describing the lawsuits. Details about
stock option plans for executives are the main type of footnote to the
capital stock account in the owners’ equity section of the balance sheet.
252
Part IV: Preparing and Using Financial Reports 

Some footnotes are always required; a financial report would be naked without
them. Deciding whether a footnote is needed (after you get beyond the obvious
ones disclosing the business’s accounting methods) and how to write the foot-
note is largely a matter of judgment and opinion, although certain standards
apply:
 The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) and its predecessors
have laid down many disclosure standards for businesses reporting
under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
 The SEC mandates disclosure of a broad range of information for publicly
owned corporations.
 International businesses abide by disclosure standards adopted by 
the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).
All this is quite a smorgasbord of disclosure requirements, to say the least.
One problem that most investors face when reading footnotes — and, for that
matter, many managers who should understand their own footnotes but find
them a little dense — is that footnotes often deal with complex issues (such
as lawsuits) and rather technical accounting matters. Let me offer you one
footnote that highlights the latter point. For your reading pleasure, a footnote
from the 2003 annual 10-K report of Caterpillar, Inc. filed with the SEC. (Just
try to make sense of it — I dare you.)
D. Inventories: Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is
principally determined using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method. The value
of inventories on the LIFO basis represented about 75% of total inventories
at December 31, 2006, and about 80% of total inventories at December 2005,
and 2004.
If the FIFO (first-in, first out) method had been in use, inventories would
have been $2,403 million, $2,345 million and $2,124 million higher than
reported at December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively.
Yes, these dollar amounts are in millions of dollars. But what does this mean?
Caterpillar’s inventory cost value for its inventories at the end of 2006 would
have been $2.4 billion higher if the FIFO accounting method had been used. In
other words, this particular asset would have been reported at a 38 percent
higher value than the $6.4 billion reported in its balance sheet at year-end
2006. Of course, you have to have some idea of the difference between the
two accounting methods — LIFO and FIFO — to make sense of this note (see
Chapter 7).
You may wonder how different the company’s annual profits would have been if
an alternative accounting method had been in use. A business’s managers can
ask its accounting department to do this analysis. But, as an outside investor,
you would have to compute these amounts yourself (assuming you had all the
253
Chapter 12: Getting a Financial Report Ready for Release

necessary information). Businesses disclose which accounting methods they
use, but they do not disclose how different annual profits would have been if
an alternative method had been used.
Other disclosures in financial reports
The following discussion includes a fairly comprehensive list of the various
types of disclosures (other than footnotes) found in annual financial reports
of publicly owned businesses. A few caveats are in order. First, not every
public corporation includes every one of the following items, although the
disclosures are fairly common. Second, the level of disclosure by private
businesses — after you get beyond the financial statements and footnotes —
is generally much less than in public corporations. Third, tracking the actual
disclosure practices of private businesses is difficult because their annual
financial reports are circulated only to their owners and lenders. (A private
business keeps its financial report as private as possible, in other words.) A
private business may include any or all of the following disclosures, but by
and large it is not required to do so (and, in my experience, very few do).
In addition to the three financial statements and footnotes to the financials,
public corporations typically include the following disclosures in their annual
financial reports to their stockholders:
 Cover (or transmittal) letter: A letter from the chief executive of the
business to the stockholders, which usually takes credit for good news
and blames bad news on big government, unfavorable world political
developments, a poor economy, or some other thing beyond manage-
ment’s control. (See the sidebar “Warren Buffett’s annual letter to
Berkshire Hathaway shareholders” for a refreshing alternative.)

I’d like to call your attention to one notable
exception to the generally self-serving and
slanted letter from a business’s chief executive
officer to its stockholders, which you find in
most annual financial reports. Warren Buffett is
the Chairman of the Board of Berkshire
Hathaway, Inc. He has become very well known
and is called the “Oracle of Omaha.” Mr.
Buffett’s letters are the epitome of telling it like
it is; they are very frank, sometimes with brutal
honesty, and quite humorous in places. You can
go the Web site of the company (www.
berkshirehathaway.com) and download
his most recent letter (and earlier ones if you
like). You’ll learn a lot about his investing philos-
ophy, and the letters are a delight to read even
though they’re relatively long (20+ pages usually).

 Management’s report on internal control over financial reporting: An
assertion by the chief executive officer and chief financial officer regard-
ing their satisfaction with the effectiveness of the internal controls of the
business, which are designed to ensure the reliability of its financial
reports (and to prevent financial and accounting fraud).
 Highlights table: A table that presents key figures from the financial
statements, such as sales revenue, total assets, profit, total debt, owners’
equity, number of employees, and number of units sold (such as the number
of vehicles sold by an automobile manufacturer, or the number of “revenue
seat miles” flown by an airline, meaning one airplane seat occupied by a
paying customer for one mile). The idea is to give the stockholder a financial
thumbnail sketch of the business.
 Management discussion and analysis (MD&A): Deals with the major
developments and changes during the year that affected the financial
performance and situation of the business. The SEC requires this disclo-
sure to be included in the annual financial reports of publicly owned
corporations.
 Segment information: A report of the sales revenue and operating prof-
its (before interest and income tax, and perhaps before certain costs
that cannot be allocated among different segments) for the major divi-
sions of the organization, or for its different markets (international
versus domestic, for example).
 Historical summaries: A financial history that extends back beyond the
years (usually three) included in the primary financial statements.
 Graphics: Bar charts, trend charts, and pie charts representing financial
conditions; photos of key people and products.
 Promotional material: Information about the company, its products, its
employees, and its managers, often stressing an overarching theme for
the year. Most companies use their annual financial report as an adver-
tising opportunity.
 Profiles: Information about members of top management and the board
of directors. Of course, everyone appears to be well qualified for his or
her position. Negative information (such as prior brushes with the law)
is not reported.
 Quarterly summaries of profit performance and stock share prices:
Shows financial performance for all four quarters in the year and stock
price ranges for each quarter (required by the SEC).
 Management’s responsibility statement: A short statement indicating that
management has primary responsibility for the accounting methods used
to prepare the financial statements, for writing the footnotes to the state-
ments, and for providing the other disclosures in the financial report.
Usually, this statement appears near the independent CPA auditor’s report.
255
Chapter 12: Getting a Financial Report Ready for Release

 Independent auditor’s report: The report from the CPA firm that performed
the audit, expressing an opinion on the fairness of the financial statements
and accompanying disclosures. Chapter 15 discusses the nature of audits
by CPAs and the audit reports that they present to the board of directors of
the corporation for inclusion in the annual financial report. Public corpora-
tions are required to have audits; private businesses may or may not have
their annual financial reports audited.
 Company contact information: Information on how to contact the com-
pany, the Web site address of the company, how to get copies of the
reports filed with the SEC, the stock transfer agent and registrar of the
company, and other information.
 No humor allowed: Finally, I should mention that annual financial
reports have virtually no humor — no cartoons, no one-liners, and no
jokes. (Well, the CEO’s letter to shareowners may have some humorous
comments, even when the CEO doesn’t mean to be funny.) I mention this
point to emphasize that financial reports are written in a somber and
serious vein. Many times in reading an annual financial report I have the
reaction that the company should lighten up a little. The tone of most
annual financial reports is that the fate of the Western world depends on
the financial performance of the company. Gimme a break!
Managers of public corporations rely on lawyers, CPA auditors, and their financial
and accounting officers to make sure that everything that should be disclosed in
the business’s annual financial reports is included, and that the exact wording of
the disclosures is not misleading, inaccurate, or incomplete. This is a tall order.
The field of financial reporting disclosure changes constantly.
Both federal and state laws, as well as authoritative accounting standards,
have to be observed in financial report disclosures. Inadequate disclosure is
just as serious as using wrong accounting methods for measuring profit and
for determining values for assets, liabilities, and owners’ equity. A financial
report can be misleading because of improper accounting methods or
because of inadequate or misleading disclosure. Both types of deficiencies
can lead to nasty lawsuits against the business and its managers.
Putting a Spin on the Numbers
(But Not Cooking the Books)
This section discusses two accounting tricks that involve manipulating, or
“massaging,” the accounting numbers. I don’t endorse either technique, but
you should be aware of both. In some situations, the financial statement num-
bers don’t come out exactly the way the business wants. With the connivance
of top management, accountants can use certain tricks of the trade — some
256
Part IV: Preparing and Using Financial Reports 

would say sleight of hand, or shenanigans — to move the numbers closer to
what the business prefers. One trick improves the appearance of the short-
term solvency of the business and the cash balance reported in the balance
sheet at the end of the year. The other device shifts some profit from one
year to the next to report a smoother trend of net income from year to year.
I don’t mean to suggest that all businesses engage in these accounting
machinations — but many do. The extent of use of these unholy schemes 
is hard to pin down because no business would openly admit to using them.
The evidence is fairly convincing, however, that many businesses massage
their numbers to some degree. I’m sure you’ve heard the term loopholes
applied to income tax. Well, some loopholes exist in financial statement
accounting as well.
Window dressing for fluffing 
up the cash balance
Suppose you manage a business and your controller has just submitted for
your review the preliminary, or first draft, of the year-end balance sheet.
(Chapter 5 explains the balance sheet, and Figure 5-2 shows a complete bal-
ance sheet for a business.) Figure 12-1 shows the current assets and current
liabilities sections of the balance sheet draft.
Wait a minute: a zero cash balance? How can that be? Maybe your business
has been having some cash flow problems and you’ve intended to increase
your short-term borrowing and speed up collection of accounts receivable to
help the cash balance. Folks generally don’t like to see a zero cash balance —
it makes them kind of nervous, to put it mildly, no matter how you try to
cushion it. So what do you do to avoid setting off alarm bells?

257
Chapter 12: Getting a Financial Report Ready for Release

Your controller is probably aware of a technique called window dressing, a very
simple method for making the cash balance look better. Suppose your fiscal
year-end is October 31. Your controller takes the cash collections from cus-
tomers paying their accounts receivable that are actually received on November
1, 2, and 3, and records them as if these cash collections had been received on
October 31. After all, the argument can be made that the customers’ checks
were in the mail — that money is yours, as far as the customers are concerned.
Window dressing reduces the amount in accounts receivable and increases
the amount in cash by the same amount — it has absolutely no effect on your
profit figure for the period. It just makes your cash balance look a touch
better. Window dressing can also be used to improve other accounts’ bal-
ances, which I don’t go into here. All of these techniques involve holding the
books open — to record certain events that take place after the end of the
fiscal year (the ending balance sheet date) to make things look better than
they actually were at the close of business on the last day of the year.
Sounds like everybody wins, doesn’t it? You look like you’ve done a better job
as manager, and your lenders and investors don’t panic. Right? Wrong!
Window dressing is deceptive to your creditors and investors, who have
every right to expect that the end of your fiscal year as stated on your finan-
cial reports is truly the end of your fiscal year. I should mention, however,
that when I was in auditing I encountered situations in which a major lender
of the business was fully aware that it had engaged in window dressing. The
lender did not object because it wanted the business to fluff the pillows to
make its balance sheet look better. The loan officer wanted to make the loan
to the business look better. Essentially, the lender was complicit in the
accounting manipulation.
Window dressing could be a dangerous game to play. Window dressing could
be the first step on a slippery slope. A little window dressing today, and
tomorrow, who knows — maybe giving the numbers a nudge now will lead to
more serious accounting deceptions, such as profit smoothing techniques
(discussed next), or even out-and-out accounting fraud. Moreover, when a
business commits some accounting hanky-panky, should the chief executive
of the business brief its directors on the accounting manipulation? Things get
messy, to say the least!
Sanding the rough edges off profit
You should not be surprised when I tell you that business managers are
under tremendous pressure to make profit every year and to keep profit on
the up escalator year after year. Managers strive to make their numbers and
to hit the milestone markers set for the business. Reporting a loss for the
258
Part IV: Preparing and Using Financial Reports 

year, or even a dip below the profit trend line, is a red flag that investors view
with alarm. Everyone likes to see a steady upward trend line for profit; no one
likes to see a profit curve that looks like a roller coaster. Most investors want
a smooth journey and don’t like putting on their investment life preservers.
Managers can do certain things to deflate or inflate profit (net income) recorded
in the year, which are referred to as profit smoothing techniques. Other names
for these techniques are income smoothing and earnings management. Profit
smoothing is like a white lie told for the good of the business and perhaps for
the good of managers as well. Managers know that there is always some noise
in the accounting system. Profit smoothing muffles the noise.
The general view in the financial community is that profit smoothing is not
nearly as serious as cooking the books, or juggling the books. These terms refer
to deliberate, fraudulent accounting practices such as recording sales revenue
that has not happened or not recording expenses that have happened.
Nevertheless, profit smoothing is still very serious and if carried too far could
be interpreted as accounting fraud. Managers can and do go to jail for fraudu-
lent financial statements. I discuss cooking the books in Chapter 15.
The pressure on public companies
Managers of publicly owned corporations whose stock shares are actively
traded are under intense pressure to keep profits steadily rising. Security ana-
lysts who follow a particular company make profit forecasts for the business,
and their buy-hold-sell recommendations are based largely on these earnings
forecasts. If a business fails to meet its own profit forecast or falls short of
stock analysts’ forecasts, the market price of its stock shares usually takes a
hit. Stock option and bonus incentive compensation plans are also strong
motivations for achieving the profit goals set for the business.
The evidence is fairly strong that publicly owned businesses engage in some
degree of profit smoothing. Frankly, it’s much harder to know whether private
businesses do so. Private businesses don’t face the public scrutiny and
expectations that public corporations do. On the other hand, key managers
in a private business may have bonus arrangements that depend on recorded
profit. In any case, business investors and managers should know about
profit smoothing and how it’s done.
Compensatory effects
Most profit smoothing involves pushing some amount of revenue and/or
expenses into years other than those in which they would normally be
recorded. For example, if the president of a business wants to report more
profit for the year, he or she can instruct the chief accountant to accelerate
the recording of some sales revenue that normally wouldn’t be recorded until
next year, or to delay the recording of some expenses until next year that nor-
mally would be recorded this year.
259
Chapter 12: Getting a Financial Report Ready for Release

Chapter 7 explains that managers choose among alternative accounting meth-
ods for several important expenses (and for revenue as well). After making
these key choices, the managers should let the accountants do their jobs and
let the chips fall where they may. If bottom-line profit for the year turns out to
be a little short of the forecast or target for the period, so be it. This hands-off
approach to profit accounting is the ideal way. However, managers often use a
hands-on approach — they intercede (one could say interfere) and override
the normal accounting for sales revenue or expenses.
Both managers who do profit smoothing and investors who rely on financial
statements in which profit smoothing has been done must understand one
thing: These techniques have robbing-Peter-to-pay-Paul effects. Accountants
refer to these as compensatory effects. The effects next year offset and cancel
out the effects this year. Less expense this year is counterbalanced by more
expense next year. Sales revenue recorded this year means less sales revenue
recorded next year. Of course, the compensatory effects work the other way
as well: If a business depresses its current year’s recorded profit, its profit
next year benefits. In short, a certain amount of profit can be brought for-
ward into the current year or delayed until the following year.
Two profit histories
Figure 12-2 shows, side by side, the annual profit histories of two different
businesses over six years. Steady Flow, Inc. shows a nice smooth upward
trend of profit. Bumpy Ride, Inc., in contrast, shows a zigzag ride over the six
years. Both businesses earned the same total profit for the six years — in this
case, $1,050,449. Their total six-year profit performance is the same, down to
the last dollar. Which company would you be more willing to risk your money
in? I suspect that you’d prefer Steady Flow, Inc. because of the nice and
steady upward slope of its profit history.
I have a secret to share with you: Figure 12-2 is not really for two different
companies — actually, the two different profit figures for each year are for
the same company. The year-by-year profits shown for Steady Flow, Inc. are
the company’s smoothed profit amounts for each year, and the annual profits
for Bumpy Ride, Inc. are the actual profits of the same business — the annual
profits that were recorded before smoothing techniques were applied.
For the first year in the series, 2004, no profit smoothing occurred. The two
profit numbers are the same; there was no need for smoothing. For each of
the next five years, the two profit numbers differ. The difference between actual
profit and smoothed profit for the year is the amount that revenue and/or
expenses had to be manipulated for the year. For example, in 2005 actual profit
would have been a little too high, so the company accelerated the recording of
some expenses that should not have been recorded until the following year
(2006); it booked those expenses in 2005. In contrast, in 2008, actual profit was
running below the target net income for the year, so the business put off record-
ing some expenses until 2009 to make 2008’s profit look better. Does all this
make you a little uncomfortable? It should.
260
Part IV: Preparing and Using Financial Reports 

A business can go only so far in smoothing profit. If a business has a particularly
bad year, all the profit-smoothing tricks in the world won’t close the gap. And if
managers are used to profit smoothing, they may be tempted in this situation to
resort to accounting fraud, or cooking the books.
Management discretion in the timing of revenue and expenses
Several smoothing techniques are available for filling the potholes and
straightening the curves on the profit highway. Most profit-smoothing tech-
niques require one essential ingredient: management discretion in deciding
when to record expenses or when to record sales.
When I was in public accounting, one of our clients was a contractor that
used the completed contract method for recording its sales revenue. Not until
the job was totally complete did the company book the sales revenue and
deduct all costs to determine the gross margin from the job (in other words,
from the contract). In most cases, the company had to return a few weeks
after a job was finished for final touch-up work or to satisfy customer com-
plaints. In the past, the company waited for this final visit before calling a job
complete. But the year I was on the audit, the company was falling short of
its profit goals. So the president decided to move up the point at which a job
was called complete. The company decided not to wait for the final visit,
which rarely involved more than a few minor expenses. Thus more jobs were
completed during the year, more sales revenue and higher gross margin were
recorded in the year, and the company met its profit goals.

Chapter 12: Getting a Financial Report Ready for Release

A common technique for profit smoothing is to delay normal maintenance and
repairs, which is referred to as deferred maintenance. Many routine and recur-
ring maintenance costs required for autos, trucks, machines, equipment, and
buildings can be put off, or deferred, until later. These costs are not recorded
to expense until the actual maintenance is done, so putting off the work means
recording the expense is delayed.
Here are a few other techniques used:
 A business that spends a fair amount of money for employee training
and development may delay these programs until next year so the
expense this year is lower.
 A company can cut back on its current year’s outlays for market
research and product development.
 A business can ease up on its rules regarding when slow-paying cus-
tomers are written off to expense as bad debts (uncollectible accounts
receivable). The business can, therefore, put off recording some of its
bad debts expense until next year.
 A fixed asset out of active use may have very little or no future value to a
business. But instead of writing off the undepreciated cost of the impaired
asset as a loss this year, the business may delay the write-off until next
year.
Keep in mind that most of these costs will be incurred next year, so the effect is
to rob Peter (make next year absorb the cost) to pay Paul (let this year escape
the cost).
262
Part IV: Preparing and Using Financial Reports 
Financial reporting on the Internet
Most public companies put their financial reports
on their Web sites. For example, you can go to
www.cat.com and navigate to Caterpillar’s
investors section, where you can locate its SEC
filings and its annual report to stockholders. Each
company’s Web site is a little different, but usu-
ally you can figure out fairly easily how to down-
load its annual and quarterly financial reports.
Alternatively, you can go to the EDGAR
(Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and
Retrieval) database, maintained by the
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
Finding particular filings with the SEC is rela-
tively easy, but each company makes many fil-
ings with the SEC so you have to know which
one you want to see. (The annual financial
report is form 10-K.) Go to the EDGAR company
search site at http://www.sec.gov/
edgar/searchedgar/companysearch.
html.

Clearly, managers have a fair amount of discretion over the timing of some
expenses, so certain expenses can be accelerated into this year or deferred
to next year in order to make for a smoother year-to-year profit trend. But a
business does not divulge in its external financial report the extent to which
it has engaged in profit smoothing. Nor does the independent auditor com-
ment on the use of profit-smoothing techniques by the business — unless the
auditor thinks that the company has gone too far in massaging the numbers
and that its financial statements are downright misleading.
Going Public or Keeping Things Private
Suppose you had the inclination (and the time!) to compare 100 annual finan-
cial reports of publicly owned corporations with 100 annual reports of privately
owned businesses. You’d see many differences. Public companies are generally
much larger (in terms of annual sales and total assets) than private companies,
as you would expect. Furthermore, public companies generally are more
complex — concerning employee compensation, financing instruments,
multinational operations, federal laws that impact big business, legal
exposure, and so on.
Private and public businesses are bound by the same accounting rules for mea-
suring profit and for valuing assets, liabilities, and owners’ equity, and for dis-
closures in their financial reports. (To be more precise, private companies are
exempt from a couple of accounting rules.) But most of the accounting and
financial reporting standards that have been issued over the last two or three
decades are directed mainly to public companies; by and large private com-
panies do not have these accounting issues. As I mention in Chapter 2, the
accounting profession has taken initiatives with the goal of better recognizing
the different needs of private companies and the constituents of financial
reporting by private companies. Well, this is the party line. In my view, the
main purpose is to lighten the accounting and financial reporting burden on
private companies, which generally don’t have the time or the accounting
expertise to comply with the large number of complex standards on the books.
Reports from publicly owned companies
Around 10,000 corporations are publicly owned, and their stock shares are
traded on the New York Stock Exchange, NASDAQ, or other stock markets.
Publicly owned companies must file annual financial reports with the SEC —
the federal agency that makes and enforces the rules for trading in securities
(stocks and bonds). These filings are available to the public on the SEC’s
EDGAR database (see the sidebar “Financial reporting on the Internet”).
263
Chapter 12: Getting a Financial Report Ready for Release

The annual financial reports of publicly owned corporations include all or
most of the disclosure items I list earlier in the chapter (see the section “Making
Sure Disclosure Is Adequate”). As a result, annual reports published by large
publicly owned corporations run 30, 40, or 50 pages (or more). The large major-
ity of public companies put their annual reports on their Web sites. Many public
companies also present condensed versions of their financial reports — see the
section “Recognizing condensed versions” later in this chapter.
Annual reports from public companies generally are very well done — the
quality of the editorial work and graphics is excellent; the color scheme,
layout, and design have very good eye appeal. But be warned that the volume
of detail in their financial reports is overwhelming. (See the next section for
advice on dealing with the information overload in annual financial reports.)
While private companies are cut some slack when it comes to reporting certain
financial information — such as earnings per share — the requirements for pub-
licly owned businesses are more stringent. Publicly owned businesses live in a
fish bowl. When a company goes public with an IPO (initial public offering of
stock shares), it gives up a lot of the privacy that a closely held business enjoys.
A public company is required to have its annual financial report audited by an
outside, independent CPA firm. In doing an audit, the CPA passes judgment on
the company’s accounting methods and adequacy of disclosure.
Reports from private businesses
Compared with their public brothers and sisters, private businesses gener-
ally provide few additional disclosures in their annual financial reports. Their
primary financial statements with the accompanying footnotes are pretty
much it. Often, their financial reports may be printed on plain paper and sta-
pled together. A privately held company may have very few stockholders,
and typically one or more of the stockholders are active managers of the
business, who already know a great deal about the business. I suppose that a
private company could e-mail its annual financial report to its lenders and
shareowners, although I haven’t seen this yet.
Private corporations could provide all the disclosures I mention in this chapter —
there’s certainly no law against doing so. But they generally don’t. Investors
in private businesses can request confidential reports from managers at the
annual stockholders’ meetings (which is not practical for a stockholder in a
large public corporation). And major lenders to a private business can demand
that certain items of information be disclosed to them as a condition of the
loan.
264
Part IV: Preparing and Using Financial Reports 

A private business may have its financial statements audited by a CPA firm
but generally is not required by law to do so. Frankly, CPA auditors cut private
businesses a lot of slack regarding disclosure. I don’t entirely disagree with
enforcing a lower standard of disclosure for private companies. The stock
share market prices of public corporations are extremely important, and full
disclosure of information should be made publicly available so that market
prices are fairly determined. On the other hand, the ownership shares of pri-
vately owned businesses are not traded, so there’s no urgent need for a com-
plete package of information.
Dealing with Information Overload
As a general rule, the larger a business, the longer its annual financial report.
I’ve seen annual financial reports of small, privately owned businesses that
you could read in 30 minutes to an hour. In contrast, the annual reports of
large, publicly owned business corporations are typically 30, 40, or 50 pages
(or more). You would need two hours to do a quick read of the entire annual
financial report, without trying to digest its details.
If you did try to digest the details of an annual financial report, which is a long,
dense document not unlike a lengthy legal contract, you would need many
hours (perhaps the whole day) to do so. (Also, to get the complete picture, you
should read the company’s filings with the SEC in conjunction with its annual
financial report. Tack on a few more hours for that!) For one thing, there are
many, many numbers in an annual financial report. I’ve never taken the time to
count the number of numbers in an average annual financial report, but I can
guarantee there are at least hundreds, and reports for large, diversified, global,
conglomerate businesses must have over a thousand.
Browsing based on your interests
How do investors in a business deal with the information overload of annual
financial reports? Very, very few persons take the time to plow through every
sentence, every word, every detail, and every number on every page — except
for those professional accountants, lawyers, and auditors directly involved in
the preparation and review of the financial report. It’s hard to say how most
managers, investors, creditors, and others interested in annual financial reports
go about dealing with the massive amount of information — very little research
has been done on this subject. But I have some observations to share with you.
265
Chapter 12: Getting a Financial Report Ready for Release

An annual financial report is like the Sunday edition of a large city newspaper,
such as The New York Times or the Chicago Tribune. Hardly anyone reads every
sentence on every page of these Sunday papers, much less every word in the
advertisements — most people pick and choose what they want to read. They
browse their way through the paper, stopping to read only the particular arti-
cles or topics they’re interested in. Some people just skim through the paper.
Some glance at the headlines. I think most investors read annual financial
reports like they read Sunday newspapers. The complete information is there if
you really want to read it, but most readers pick and choose which information
they have time to read.
Annual financial reports are designed for archival purposes, not for a quick read.
Instead of addressing the needs of investors and others who want to know
about the profit performance and financial condition of the business — but have
only a very limited amount of time available — accountants produce an annual
financial report that is a voluminous financial history of the business.
Accountants leave it to the users of annual reports to extract the main points.
So financial statement readers use relatively few ratios and other tests to get a
feel for the financial performance and position of the business. (Chapters 13 and
17 explain how readers of financial reports get a fix on the financial performance
and position of a business.)
Recognizing condensed versions
Here’s a well-kept secret: Many public businesses and nonprofit organizations
don’t send a complete annual financial report to their stockholders or members.
They know that few persons have the time or the technical background to read
thoroughly the full-scale financial statements, footnotes, and other disclosures
in their comprehensive financial reports. So, they present relatively brief sum-
maries that are boiled-down versions of their complete financial reports. For
example, my retirement fund manager, TIAA-CREF, puts out only financial sum-
maries to its participants and retirees. Also, AARP issues condensed financial
reports to its members.
Typically, these summaries — called condensed financial statements — do not
provide footnotes or the other disclosures that are included in the complete
and comprehensive annual financial reports. If you really want to see the offi-
cial financial report of the organization, you can ask its headquarters to send
you a copy (or, for public corporations, you can go to the EDGAR database of
the SEC — see the sidebar “Financial reporting on the Internet”).
266
Part IV: Preparing and Using Financial Reports 

Using other sources of 
business information
Keep in mind that annual financial reports are only one of several sources of infor-
mation to owners, creditors, and others who have a financial interest in the busi-
ness. Annual financial reports, of course, come out only once a year — usually
two months or so after the end of the company’s fiscal (accounting) year. You
have to keep abreast of developments during the year by reading financial news-
papers or through other means. Also, annual financial reports present the sani-
tized version of events; they don’t divulge scandals or other negative news about
the business.
Not everything you may like to know as an investor is included in the annual
financial report. For example, information about salaries and incentive com-
pensation arrangements with the top-level managers of the business are dis-
closed in the proxy statement, not in the annual financial report. A proxy
statement is the means by which the corporation solicits the vote of stock-
holders on issues that require stockholder approval — one of which is com-
pensation packages of top-level managers. Proxy statements are filed with the
SEC and are available on its EDGAR database.
Statement of Changes in Owners’ Equity
In many situations, a business prepares a “mini” financial statement in addition
to its three primary financial statements (income statement, balance sheet, and
statement of cash flows). This additional schedule is called the statement of
changes in owners’ equity. You find this schedule in almost all public companies,
because most have relatively complex ownership structures and changes in
their equity accounts during the year. Many smaller private companies, on the
other hand, do not need to present this schedule.
Owners’ equity consists of two fundamentally different sources: capital invested
in the business by the owners, and profit earned by and retained in the busi-
ness. The specific accounts maintained by the business for its total owners’
equity depend on the legal organization of the business entity. One of the main
types of legal organization of a business is the corporation, and its owners are
stockholders. A corporation issues ownership shares called capital stock. The
title statement of changes in stockholders’ equity is used for corporations.
(Chapter 8 explains the corporation and other legal types of business entities.)
267
Chapter 12: Getting a Financial Report Ready for Release

Let’s consider a situation in which a business does not need to report this
statement, to make clearer why the statement is needed. Suppose a business
corporation has only one class of capital stock (ownership shares); it did not
issue any additional capital stock shares during the year; and it did not record
any gains or losses directly in its owners’ equity during the year (due to other
comprehensive income, which I explain in a moment). This business does not
need a statement of changes in stockholders’ equity. In reading the financial
report of this business you would see in its statement of cash flows (see Figure
6-1 or 6-2, for example) and its footnotes whether the business raised addi-
tional capital from its owners during the year, and how much cash dividends
(distributions from profit) were paid to the owners during the year. In other
words, the statement of cash flows and footnotes report all the activity in the
owners’ equity accounts during the year. Even so, a business may go ahead and
prepare the schedule in order to bring together everything affecting its owner’s
equity accounts in one place.
In contrast, many larger businesses — especially publicly traded corporations —
generally have complex ownership structures consisting of two or more classes
of capital stock shares; they usually buy some of their own capital stock shares;
and they have one or more technical types of gains or losses during the year. So
they prepare a statement of changes in stockholders’ equity to collect together
in one place all the changes affecting the owners’ equity accounts during the year.
This particular statement (that focuses narrowly on changes in owners’ equity
accounts) is where you find certain gains and losses that increase or decrease
owners’ equity but that are not reported in the income statement. This is a rather
sneaky way of bypassing the income statement.
Basically, a business has the option to skirt around the income statement
and, instead, report certain gains and losses in the statement of changes in
owners’ equity. In this way, the gains or losses do not affect the bottom-line
profit of the business reported in its income statement. You have to read this
financial summary of the changes in the owners’ equity accounts to find out
whether the business had any of these technical gains or losses, and the
amounts of the gains or losses.
The special types of gains and losses reported in the statement of stockholders’
equity (instead of the income statement) have to do with foreign currency trans-
lations, unrealized gains and losses from certain types of securities investments
by the business, and changes in liabilities for unfunded pension fund obligations
of the business. The term comprehensive income is used to describe the normal
content of the income statement plus the additional layer of these special types
of gains and losses. Being so technical in nature, these gains and losses fall into
a twilight zone, as it were, in financial reporting. The gains and losses can be
tacked on at the bottom of the income statement, or they can be put in the
statement of changes in owners’ equity — it’s up to the business to make the
choice. You see it done both ways in financial reports.
268
Part IV: Preparing and Using Financial Reports 

The general format of the statement of changes in stockholders’ equity
includes
 A column for each class of stock (common stock, preferred stock, and so on)
 A column for any treasury stock (shares of its own capital stock that the
business has purchased and not cancelled)
 A column for retained earnings
 One or more columns for any other separate components of the business’s
owners’ equity
Each column starts with the beginning balance and then shows the increases
or decreases in the account during the year. For example, a comprehensive
gain is shown as an increase in retained earnings, and a comprehensive loss
as a decrease.
I have to admit that reading a statement of changes in stockholders’ equity 
in a public company’s annual financial report can be heavy lifting. The
professionals — stock analysts, money and investment managers, and so 
on — carefully read through and dissect this statement, or at least they should.
The average, nonprofessional investor should focus on whether the business
had a major increase or decrease in the number of stock shares during the year,
whether the business changed its ownership structure by creating or eliminating a
class of stock, and what impact stock options awarded to managers of the busi-
ness may have had.

Read a Financial Report
In This Chapter

 Using ratios to interpret financial condition
 Scanning footnotes and sorting out important ones
 Paying attention to what the auditor says
S
ome years ago, a private business needed additional capital to continue
its growth. Its stockholders could not come up with all the additional
capital the business needed. So they decided to solicit several people to invest
money in the company, including me. (In Chapter 8, I explain corporations and
the stock shares they issue when owners invest capital in the business.) I stud-
ied the business’s most recent financial report. I had an advantage that you’ll
have too if you read this chapter: I know how to read a financial report and
what to look for.
After studying the financial report, I concluded that the profit prospects of
this business looked promising and that I probably would receive reasonable
cash dividends on my investment. I also thought the business might be bought
out by a bigger business someday, and I would make a capital gain. That proved
to be correct: The business was bought out a few years later, and I doubled my
money (plus I earned dividends along the way).
Not all investment stories have a happy ending, of course. As you know, stock
share market prices go up and down. A business may go bankrupt, causing its
lenders and shareowners large losses. This chapter isn’t about guiding you
toward or away from making specific types of investments. My purpose is to
explain basic tools lenders and investors use for getting the most information
value out of a business’s financial reports — to help you become a more intel-
ligent lender and investor.

Note: This chapter focuses on the external financial report that a business sends
to its lenders and shareowners. External financial reports are designed for the
non-manager stakeholders in the business. The business’s managers should defi-
nitely understand how to read and analyze its external financial statements, but
managers should do additional financial analysis, which I discuss in Chapter 14.
This additional financial analysis by managers uses confidential accounting
information that is not circulated outside the business.
Knowing the Rules of the Game
When you invest money in a business venture or lend money to a business,
you receive regular financial reports from the business. The basic premise of
financial reporting is accountability — to inform the sources of a business’s
ownership and debt capital about the financial performance and condition of
the business. Brief financial reports are sent to owners and lenders quarterly
(every three months). A full and comprehensive financial report is sent annu-
ally. This chapter focuses on the annual financial report.
Public companies make their financial reports available to the public at large;
they do not limit distribution only to their present shareowners and lenders.
For instance, I don’t happen to own any stock shares of Caterpillar. So, how
did I get its annual financial report? I simply went to Cat’s Web site. In contrast,
private companies generally keep their financial reports private — they
distribute their financial reports only to their shareowners and lenders. Even
if you were a close friend of the president of a private business, I doubt that
the president would let you see a copy of its latest financial report. You may
as well ask to see the president’s latest individual income tax return. (You’re
not going to see it either.)
There are written rules for financial reports, and there are unwritten rules.
The main written rules in the United States are called generally accepted
accounting principles (GAAP). The unwritten rules don’t have a name. For
instance, there is no explicit rule prohibiting the use of swear words and
vulgar expressions in financial reports. Yet, quite clearly, there is a strict
unwritten rule against improper language in financial reports. There’s one
unwritten rule in particular that you should understand: A financial report is
not a confessional. A business does not have to lay bare all its problems in its
financial reports. A business cannot resort to accounting fraud to cover up
its problems, of course. But a business does not comment on its difficulties
and sensitive issues in reporting its financial affairs to the outside world.
272
Part IV: Preparing and Using Financial Reports 

Becoming a More Savvy Investor
An investment opportunity in a private business won’t show up on your
doorstep every day. However, if you make it known that you have money to
invest as an equity shareholder, you may be surprised at how many offers
come your way. Alternatively, you can invest in publicly traded securities,
those stocks and bonds listed every day in The Wall Street Journal. Your stock-
broker would be delighted to execute a buy order for 100 shares of, say,
Caterpillar for you. Keep in mind that your money does not go to Caterpillar; the
company is not raising additional money. Your money goes to the seller of the
100 shares. You’re investing in the secondary capital market — the trading in
stocks by buyers and sellers after the shares were originally issued some time
ago. In contrast, I invested in the primary capital market, which means that my
money went directly to the business.
You may choose not to manage your securities investments yourself. Instead,
you can put your money in one or more of the thousands of mutual funds
available today, or in an exchange-traded fund (a recent type of investment
vehicle). You’ll have to read other books to gain an understanding of the
choices you have for investing your money and managing your investments.
Be very careful about books that promise spectacular investment results
with no risk and little effort. One book that is practical, well written, and lev-
elheaded is Investing For Dummies, 4th Edition, by Eric Tyson (Wiley).
Investors in a private business have just one main source of financial information
about the business they’ve put their hard-earned money in: its financial reports.
Of course, investors should carefully read these reports. By “carefully,” I mean
they should look for the vital signs of progress and problems. The financial state-
ment ratios that I explain later in this chapter point the way — like signposts on
the financial information highway.
Investors in securities of public businesses have many sources of information
at their disposal. Of course, they can read the financial reports of the busi-
nesses they have invested in and those they are thinking of investing in. Instead
of thoroughly reading these financial reports, they may rely on stockbrokers,
the financial press, and other sources of information. Many individual investors
turn to their stockbrokers for investment advice. Brokerage firms put out all
sorts of analyses and publications, and they participate in the placement of new
stock and bond securities issued by public businesses. A broker will be glad to
provide you information from companies’ latest financial reports. So, why
should you bother reading this chapter if you can rely on other sources of
investment information?
273
Chapter 13: How Lenders and Investors Read a Financial Report

The more you know about interpreting a financial report, the better prepared
you are to evaluate the commentary and advice of stock analysts and other
investment experts. If you can at least nod intelligently while your stockbroker
talks about a business’s P/E and EPS, you’ll look like a savvy investor — and you
may get more favorable treatment. (P/E and EPS, by the way, are two of the key
ratios explained later in the chapter.) You may regularly watch financial news on
television or listen to one of today’s popular radio financial talk shows. The
ratios explained in this chapter are frequently mentioned in the media.
This chapter covers financial statement ratios that you should understand,
as well as warning signs to look out for in audit reports. (Part II of this book
explains the three primary financial statements that are the core of every
financial report: the income statement, the balance sheet, and the statement
of cash flows.) I also suggest how to sort through the footnotes that are an
integral part of every financial report to identify those that have the most
importance to you.
Comparing Private and Public 
Business Financial Reports
As I explain in Chapters 2 and 12, the accounting profession is presently con-
sidering whether private companies should be relieved of the onerous bur-
dens imposed by certain accounting and financial reporting standards. The
main, almost exclusive focus of the standard setters over the last three
decades has been on the accounting and financial reporting problems of large
274
Part IV: Preparing and Using Financial Reports 
Looking beyond financial reports
Investors don’t rely solely on financial reports
when making investment decisions. Analyzing a
business’s financial reports is just one part of
the process. You should consider these addi-
tional factors, depending on the business you’re
thinking about investing in:
 Industry trends and problems
 National economic and political developments
 Possible mergers, friendly acquisitions, and
hostile takeovers
 Turnover of key executives
 Labor problems
 International 
markets 
and 
currency
exchange ratios
 Supply shortages
 Product surpluses
Whew! This kind of stuff goes way beyond
accounting, obviously, and is just as significant as
financial statement analysis when you’re picking
stocks and managing investment portfolios.

public companies. There seems to be a consensus that many of these complex
standards are not relevant to smaller, private businesses — and that the users
of their financial reports are not well served by the standards. So far, there has
not been a lot of concrete progress in identifying which particular standards
should not apply to private companies. But it’s still early in the game, so stay
tuned.
Although accountants are loath to talk about it, the blunt fact is that many (per-
haps most) private companies simply ignore some authoritative standards in
preparing their financial reports. This doesn’t mean that their financial reports are
misleading — perhaps substandard, but not seriously misleading. In any case, a
private business’s annual financial report is generally bare bones. It includes the
three primary financial statements (balance sheet, income statement, and state-
ment of cash flows), plus some footnotes — and that’s about it. I’ve seen private
company financial reports that don’t even have a letter from the president. In fact,
I’ve seen financial reports of private businesses (mostly very small companies)
that don’t include a statement of cash flows, even though this financial statement
is required according to financial reporting standards.
Public businesses are saddled with the additional layer of requirements
issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission. (This federal agency has
no jurisdiction over private businesses.) The financial reports and other
forms filed with the SEC are available to the public at http://www.sec.
gov/edgar/searchedgar/companysearch.html. The best known of these
forms is the 10-K, which includes the business’s annual financial statements in
prescribed formats, with many supporting schedules and detailed disclosures
that the SEC requires.
Many publicly owned businesses present very different annual financial reports
to their stockholders than their filings with the SEC. A large number of public
companies include only condensed financial information in their annual stock-
holder reports (not their full-blown and complete financial statements). They
refer the reader to their more detailed SEC financial report for more specifics.
The financial information in the two documents can’t differ in any material way.
In essence, a stock investor can choose from two levels of information — one
quite condensed and the other very technical.
A typical annual financial report by a public company to its stockholders is a
glossy booklet with excellent art and graphic design, including high-quality
photographs. The company’s products are promoted, and its people are featured
in glowing terms that describe teamwork, creativity, and innovation — I’m sure
you get the picture. In contrast, the reports to the SEC look like legal briefs —
there’s nothing fancy in these filings. The SEC filings contain information about
certain expenses and require disclosure about the history of the business, its
main markets and competitors, its principal officers, any major changes on the
horizon, and so on. Professional investors and investment managers definitely
should read the SEC filings. If you want information on the compensation of the
top-level officers of the business, you have to go to its proxy statement (see the
sidebar “Studying the proxy statement”).
275
Chapter 13: How Lenders and Investors Read a Financial Report

Analyzing Financial Statements 
with Ratios
Financial statements have lots of numbers in them. (Duh!) All these numbers
can seem overwhelming when you’re trying to see the big picture and make
general conclusions about the financial performance and condition of the
business. One very useful way to interpret financial reports is to compute
ratios — that is, to divide a particular number in the financial report by
another. Financial statement ratios are also useful because they enable you to
compare a business’s current performance with its past performance or with
another business’s performance, regardless of whether sales revenue or net
income was bigger or smaller for the other years or the other business. In
other words, using ratios cancels out size differences. (I bet you knew that,
didn’t you?)
Surprisingly, you don’t find too many ratios in financial reports. Publicly
owned businesses are required to report just one ratio (earnings per share,
or EPS), and privately owned businesses generally don’t report any ratios.
Generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) don’t demand that any
ratios be reported (except EPS for publicly owned companies). However, you
still see and hear about ratios all the time, especially from stockbrokers and
other financial professionals, so you should know what the ratios mean, even
if you never go to the trouble of computing them yourself.
276
Part IV: Preparing and Using Financial Reports 
Studying the proxy statement
Public corporations solicit their stockholders’
votes in the annual election of persons to sit on
the board of directors and on other matters that
must be put to a vote at the annual stockhold-
ers’ meeting. The communication for soliciting
votes from stockholders is called a proxy state-
ment — the reason being that the stockholders
give their votes to a proxy, or designated
person, who actually casts the votes at the
annual meeting. The SEC requires many disclo-
sures in proxy statements that are not found in
annual financial reports issued to stockholders
or in the business’s annual 10-K. For example,
compensation paid to the top-level officers of
the business must be disclosed, as well as their
stock holdings. If you own stock in a public cor-
poration, take the time to read through the
annual proxy statement you receive.

Ratios do not provide final answers — they’re helpful indicators, and that’s it.
For example, if you’re in the market for a house, you may consider cost per
square foot (the total cost divided by total square feet) as a way of compar-
ing the prices of the houses you’re looking at. But you have to put that ratio
in context: Maybe one neighborhood is closer to public transportation than
another, and maybe one house needs more repairs than another. In short, the
ratio isn’t the only factor in your decision.
Figures 13-1 and 13-2 present an income statement and balance sheet for a
public business that will serve as the example for the rest of the chapter. I
don’t include a statement of cash flows here — because no ratios are calcu-
lated from data in this financial statement. (Well, I should say that no cash flow
ratios have yet become widespread and commonly used; you could take data
from the statement of cash flows and calculate ratios, of course.) I don’t pre-
sent the footnotes to the company’s financial statements here, but I discuss
reading footnotes in the upcoming section “Frolicking Through the Footnotes.”
The financial statements were audited by an independent CPA firm. (I tackle
the nature of audits in Chapter 15, and later in this chapter, I explain why you
should read the auditor’s report — see “Checking for Ominous Skies in the
Audit Report.”)

Gross margin ratio
As I explain in Chapters 4 and 9, making bottom-line profit begins with
making sales and earning sufficient gross margin from those sales. By suffi-
cient, I mean that your gross margin must cover the expenses of making sales
and operating the business, as well as paying interest and income tax
expenses, so that there is still an adequate amount left over for profit. You
calculate the gross margin ratio as follows:
Gross margin ÷ Sales revenue = Gross margin ratio

Part IV: Preparing and Using Financial Reports 

So a business with a $158.25 million gross margin and $457 million in sales
revenue (refer to Figure 13-1) earns a 34.6 percent gross margin ratio. Now,
suppose the business had been able to reduce its cost of goods sold expense
and had earned a 35.6 percent gross margin. That one additional point (one
point equals 1 percent) would have increased gross margin $4.57 million (1
percent × $457 million sales revenue) — which would have trickled down to
earnings before income tax, assuming other expenses below the gross margin
line had been the same (except income tax). Earnings before income tax
would have been 9.3 percent higher:
$4,570,000 bump in gross margin ÷ $49,320,000
earnings before income tax = 9.3% increase
Never underestimate the impact of even a small improvement in the gross
margin ratio!
Investors can track the gross margin ratios for the two or three years whose
income statements are included in the annual financial report, but they really
can’t get behind gross margin numbers for the “inside story.” In their finan-
cial reports, public companies include a management discussion and analysis
(MD&A) section that should comment on any significant change in the gross
margin ratio. But corporate managers have wide latitude in deciding what
exactly to discuss and how much detail to go into. You definitely should read
the MD&A section, but it may not provide all the answers you’re looking for.
You have to search further in stockbroker releases, in articles in the financial
press, or at the next professional business meeting you attend.
As I explain in Chapter 9, business managers pay close attention to margin
per unit and total margin in making and improving profit. Margin does not
mean gross margin, but rather it refers to sales revenue minus product cost
and all other variable operating expenses of a business. In other words,
margin is profit before the company’s total fixed operating expenses (and
before interest and income tax). Margin is an extremely important factor in
the profit performance of a business. Profit hinges directly on margin.
The income statement in an external financial report discloses gross margin
and operating profit, or earnings before interest and income tax expenses
(see Figure 13-1 for instance). However, the expenses between these two
profit lines in the income statement are not classified into variable and fixed.
Therefore, businesses do not disclose margin information in their external
financial reports — they wouldn’t even think of doing so. This information is
considered to be proprietary in nature; it is kept confidential and out of the
hands of competitors. In short, investors do not have access to information
about a business’s margin or its fixed expenses. Neither GAAP nor the SEC
requires that such information be disclosed — and it isn’t! Nevertheless,
stock analysts and investment pundits make the best estimates they can for
the margins of businesses they analyze. But, they have to work with other
information than what’s in a company’s financial report.
279
Chapter 13: How Lenders and Investors Read a Financial Report

Profit ratio
Business is motivated by profit, so the profit ratio is very important, to say
the least. The bottom line is not called the bottom line without good reason.
The profit ratio indicates how much net income was earned on each $100 of
sales revenue:
Net income ÷ Sales revenue = Profit ratio
The business in Figure 13-1 earned $32.47 million net income from its $457
million sales revenue, so its profit ratio equals 7.1 percent, meaning that the
business earned $7.10 net income for each $100 of sales revenue. (Thus, its
expenses were $92.90 per $100 of sales revenue.) Profit ratios vary widely
from industry to industry. A 5 to 10 percent profit ratio is common in many
industries, although some high-volume retailers, such as supermarkets, are
satisfied with profit ratios around 1 or 2 percent.
You can turn any ratio upside down and come up with a new way of looking
at the same information. If you flip the profit ratio over to be sales revenue
divided by net income, the result is the amount of sales revenue needed to
make $1 profit. Using the same example, $457 million sales revenue ÷ $32.47
million net income = 14.08, which means that the business needs $14.08 in
sales to make $1.00 profit. So you can say that net income is 7.1 percent of
sales revenue, or you can say that sales revenue is 14.08 times net income.
Earnings per share (EPS), 
basic and diluted
Publicly owned businesses, according to generally accepted accounting princi-
ples (GAAP), must report earnings per share (EPS) below the net income line in
their income statements — giving EPS a certain distinction among ratios. Why is
EPS considered so important? Because it gives investors a means of determining
the amount the business earned on their stock share investments: EPS tells you
how much net income the business earned for each stock share you own. The
essential equation for EPS is as follows:
Net income ÷ Total number of capital stock shares = EPS
For the example in Figures 13-1 and 13-2, the company’s $32.47 million net
income is divided by the 8.5 million shares of stock the business has issued
to compute its $3.82 EPS.
280
Part IV: Preparing and Using Financial Reports 

Note: EPS is extraordinarily important to the stockholders of businesses
whose stock shares are publicly traded. These stockholders pay close atten-
tion to market price per share. They want the net income of the business to
be communicated to them on a per share basis so that they can easily com-
pare it with the market price of their stock shares. The stock shares of pri-
vately owned corporations are not actively traded, so there is no readily
available market value for the stock shares. Private businesses do not have to
report EPS according to GAAP. The thinking behind this exemption is that
their stockholders do not focus on per share values and are more interested
in the business’s total net income.
The business in the example could be listed on the New York Stock Exchange
(NYSE). Assume that its capital stock is being traded at $70 per share. The Big
Board (as it is called) requires that the market cap (total value of the shares
issued and outstanding) be at least $100 million and that it have at least 1.1
million shares available for trading. With 8.5 million shares trading at $70 per
share, the company’s market cap is $595 million, well above the NYSE’s mini-
mum. At the end of the year, this corporation has 8.5 million stock shares out-
standing, which refers to the number of shares that have been issued and are
owned by its stockholders. Thus, its EPS is $3.82, as just computed.
But here’s a complication: The business is committed to issuing additional
capital stock shares in the future for stock options that the company has
granted to its executives, and it has borrowed money on the basis of debt
instruments that give the lenders the right to convert the debt into its capital
stock. Under terms of its management stock options and its convertible debt,
the business may have to issue 500,000 additional capital stock shares in the
future. Dividing net income by the number of shares outstanding plus the
number of shares that could be issued in the future gives the following com-
putation of EPS:
$32,470,000 net income ÷ 9,000,000 capital stock
shares issued and potentially issuable = $3.61 EPS
This second computation, based on the higher number of stock shares, is called
the diluted earnings per share. (Diluted means thinned out or spread over a
larger number of shares.) The first computation, based on the number of stock
shares actually issued and outstanding, is called basic earnings per share. Both
are reported at the bottom of the income statement — see Figure 13-1.
So, publicly owned businesses report two EPS figures — unless they have a
simple capital structure that does not require the business to issue additional
stock shares in the future. Generally, publicly owned corporations have com-
plex capital structures and have to report two EPS figures, as you see in Figure
13-1. Sometimes it’s not clear which of the two EPS figures is being used in
press releases and in articles in the financial press. You have to be careful to
determine which EPS ratio is being used — and which is being used in the
calculation of the price/earnings (P/E) ratio (explained in the next section).
281
Chapter 13: How Lenders and Investors Read a Financial Report

The more conservative approach is to use diluted EPS, although this calculation
includes a hypothetical number of shares that may or may not be actually
issued in the future.
Calculating basic and diluted EPS isn’t always as simple as my example may
suggest. Here are just two examples of complicating factors that require the
accountant to adjust the EPS formula. During the year a company may
 Issue additional stock shares and buy back some of its stock shares.
(Shares of its stock owned by the business itself that are not formally
cancelled are called treasury stock.) The weighted average number of
outstanding stock shares is used in these situations.
 Issue more than one class of stock, causing net income to be divided
into two or more pools — one pool for each class of stock. EPS refers
to the common stock, or the most junior of the classes of stock issued by
a business. (Let’s not get into tracking stocks here, when a business
divides itself into two or more sub-businesses and you have an EPS for
each sub-part of the business, because few public companies do this.)
Price/earnings (P/E) ratio
The price/earnings (P/E) ratio is another ratio that’s of particular interest to
investors in public businesses. The P/E ratio gives you an idea of how much
you’re paying in the current price for stock shares for each dollar of earnings
(the net income being earned by the business). Remember that earnings prop
up the market value of stock shares.
The P/E ratio is, in one sense, a reality check on just how high the current
market price is in relation to the underlying profit that the business is earning.
Extraordinarily high P/E ratios are justified when investors think that the com-
pany’s EPS has a lot of upside potential in the future.
The P/E ratio is calculated as follows:
Current market price of stock ÷ Most recent trailing 
12 months diluted EPS* = P/E ratio
* If the business has a simple capital structure and does not report a diluted
EPS, its basic EPS is used for calculating its P/E ratio (see the previous section).
The capital stock shares of the business in our example are trading at $70,
and its diluted EPS for the latest year is $3.61. Note: For the remainder of this
section, I will use the term EPS; I assume you understand that it refers to
diluted EPS for businesses with complex capital structures, or to basic EPS
for businesses with simple capital structures.
282
Part IV: Preparing and Using Financial Reports 

Stock share prices of public companies bounce around day to day and are sub-
ject to big changes on short notice. To illustrate the P/E ratio, I use the $70 price,
which is the closing price on the latest trading day in the stock market. This
market price means that investors trading in the stock think that the shares are
worth about 19 times EPS ($70 market price ÷ $3.61 EPS = 19). This P/E ratio
should be compared with the average stock market P/E to gauge whether the
business is selling above or below the market average.
Over the last century, average P/E ratios have fluctuated more than you might
think. I remember when the average P/E ratio was less than 10, and a time
when it was more than 20. Also, P/E ratios vary from business to business,
industry to industry, and year to year. One dollar of EPS may command only a
$12 market value for a mature business in a no-growth industry, whereas a
dollar of EPS for dynamic businesses in high-growth industries may be
rewarded with a $35 market value per dollar of earnings (net income).
Dividend yield
The dividend yield ratio tells investors how much cash income they’re receiv-
ing on their stock investment in a business. Suppose that our business exam-
ple paid $1.50 cash dividends per share over the last year, which is less than
half of its EPS. (I should mention that the ratio of annual dividends per share
divided by annual EPS is called the payout ratio.) You calculate the dividend
yield ratio for this business as follows:
$1.50 annual cash dividend per share ÷ $70 current
market price of stock = 2.1% dividend yield
You can compare the dividend yield with the interest rate on high-grade debt
securities that pay interest. The average interest rate of high-grade debt secu-
rities (U.S. Treasury bonds and Treasury notes being the safest) is sometimes
two or more times the dividend yields on public corporations. In theory,
market price appreciation of the stock shares makes up for this gap. Of
course, stockholders take the risk that the market value will not increase
enough to make their total return on investment rate higher than a bench-
mark interest rate.
Assume that long-term U.S. Treasury bonds are paying 4.5 percent annual inter-
est, which is 2.4 percent higher than the business’s 2.1 percent dividend yield
in the example. If this business’s stock shares don’t increase in value by at least
2.4 percent over the year, its investors would have been better off investing in
the debt securities instead. (Of course, they wouldn’t have gotten all the perks
of a stock investment, like those heartfelt letters from the president and those
glossy financial reports.) The market price of publicly traded debt securities
can fall or rise, so things get a little tricky in this sort of investment analysis.

Book value and book value per share
The amount reported in a business’s balance sheet for owners’ equity is
called its book value. In the Figure 13-2 example, the book value of owners’
equity is $217.72 million at the end of the year. This amount is the sum of the
accounts that are kept for owners’ equity, which fall into two basic types: cap-
ital accounts (for money invested by owners minus money returned to them),
and retained earnings (profit earned and not distributed to the owners). Just
like accounts for assets and liabilities, the entries in owners’ equity accounts
are for the actual, historical transactions of the business.
If you remember only one thing, make sure it’s this: Book value is not market
value. The book value of owners’ equity is not directly tied to the market value
of a business. You could say that there is a disconnect between book value and
market value, although this goes a little too far. Book value may be considered
heavily in putting a market value on a business and its ownership shares. Or,
it may play only a minor role. In any case, other factors come into play in set-
ting the market value of a business and its ownership shares. Market value 
may be quite a bit more than book value, or considerably less than book value.
Whether or not it is known, market value is not reported in the balance sheet
of a business. For example, you do not see the market value of Google reported
in its latest balance sheet or elsewhere in its annual financial report (although
public companies include the market price ranges of their capital stock shares
for each quarter of the year).
Public companies have one advantage: You can easily determine the current
market value of their ownership shares and the market cap for the business
as a whole (equal to the number of shares × the market value per share.) The
market values of capital stock shares of public companies are easy to find.
Stock market prices are reported every trading day in many newspapers and
on the Internet.
Private companies have one disadvantage: There is no active trading in their
ownership shares to provide market value information. The shareowners of a
private business probably have some idea of the price per share that they
would be willing to sell their shares for, but until an actual buyer for their
shares or for the business as a whole comes down the pike, market value is not
known. Even so, in some situations there is a need to put a market value on the
business and/or its ownership shares. For example, when a shareholder dies or
gets a divorce there is need for a current market value estimate of the owner’s
shares (for estate tax or divorce settlement purposes). When making an offer
to buy a private business, the buyer puts a value on the business, of course.
The valuation of a private business is beyond the scope of this book. You can
find more on this topic in a book I coauthored with my son, Tage C. Tracy,
called Small Business Financial Management Kit For Dummies (Wiley).
284
Part IV: Preparing and Using Financial Reports 

One value of the ownership shares for both public and private businesses is
book value per share. You calculate the book value per share for a business as
follows:
Owners’ equity ÷ Number of stock shares outstanding =
Book value per share
The business shown in Figure 13-2 has issued 8.5 million capital stock shares.
The book value of its $217.72 million owners’ equity divided by the number of
stock shares gives a book value per share of $25.61. If the business sold off its
assets exactly for their book values and paid all its liabilities, it would end up
with $217.72 million left for the stockholders, and it could therefore distrib-
ute $25.61 per share to them. But, of course, the company doesn’t plan to go
out of business, liquidate its assets, and pay off its liabilities anytime soon.
Is book value the major determinant of market value? No, generally speaking
book value is not the dominant factor that drives the market price of a stock —
not for a public company whose stock shares are traded every day, nor for a
private business when a value is being put on the business. EPS is much more
important for public companies. However, let’s not throw out the baby with the
bathwater — book value per share is not entirely irrelevant. Book value per
share is the measure of the recorded value of the company’s assets less its lia-
bilities — the net assets backing up the business’s stock shares.
Book value per share is important for value investors, who pay as much attention
to the balance sheet factors of a business as to its income statement factors.
They search out companies with stock market prices that are not too much
higher, or even lower, than book value per share. Part of their theory is that such
a business has more assets to back up the current market price of its stock
shares, compared with businesses that have relatively high market prices rela-
tive to their book value per share. In the example, the business’s stock is selling
for about 2.8 times its book value per share ($70 market price per share ÷ $25.61
book value per share = 2.8 times). This may be too high for some investors and
would certainly give value investors pause before deciding to buy stock shares of
the business.
Book value per share can be calculated for a private business, of course. But
its capital stock shares are not publicly traded, so there is no market price to
compare the book value per share with. Suppose I own 1,000 shares of stock
of a private business, and I offer to sell 100 of my shares to you. The book
value per share might play some role in our negotiations. However, a more
critical factor would be the amount of dividends per share the business will
pay in the future, which depends on its earnings prospects. Your main
income would be dividends, at least until you had an opportunity to liquidate
the shares (which is uncertain for a private business).
285
Chapter 13: How Lenders and Investors Read a Financial Report

Return on equity (ROE) ratio
The return on equity (ROE) ratio tells you how much profit a business earned in
comparison to the book value of its owners’ equity. This ratio is especially useful
for privately owned businesses, which have no easy way of determining the
market value of owners’ equity. ROE is also calculated for public corporations,
but, just like book value per share, it generally plays a secondary role and is not
the dominant factor driving market prices. Here’s how you calculate this ratio:
Net income ÷ Owners’ equity = ROE
The business whose income statement and balance sheet are shown in
Figures 13-1 and 13-2 earned $32.47 million net income for the year just ended
and has $217.72 million owners’ equity at the end of the year. Therefore, its
ROE is 14.9 percent:
$32,470,000 net income ÷ $217,720,000 owners’ equity 
= 14.9% ROE
Net income increases owners’ equity, so it makes sense to express net
income as the percentage of improvement in the owners’ equity. In fact, this
is exactly how Warren Buffett does it in his annual letter to the stockholders
of Berkshire Hathaway. Over the 42 years ending in 2006, Berkshire Hathaway’s
average annual ROE was 21.4 percent, which is extraordinary. See the sidebar
“If you had invested $1,000 in Berkshire Hathaway in 1965.”
286
Part IV: Preparing and Using Financial Reports 
If you had invested $1,000 in 
Berkshire Hathaway in 1965
You probably have heard about Berkshire
Hathaway and its CEO, Warren Buffett, who is the
second richest person according to Forbes mag-
azine’s annual listing of the 400 richest people in
America. (Bill Gates, the co-founder of Microsoft,
is number one.) Suppose you had invested $1,000
in Berkshire Hathaway in 1965 and held on to your
shares for 42 years, to the end of 2006. At that
time, the book value of your shares was about
$3.6 million (and the market value of your shares
was quite a bit higher than that).
This Berkshire Hathaway investment example
demonstrates the power of compounding at a
high earnings rate over a long stretch of time.
Under Mr. Buffett’s time as CEO starting in 1965
through the end of 2006, the company earned an
average 21.4 percent annual ROE. The actual
annual ROE rates for Berkshire Hathaway fluc-
tuated over the 42 years. Berkshire Hathaway
had annual rates lower than its 21.4 percent
average annual rate in 24 of the 42 years, includ-
ing the most recent 8 years (1999 through 2006).
(Data is from Berkshire Hathaway’s 2006 annual
financial report.)

Current ratio
The current ratio is a test of a business’s short-term solvency — its capability
to pay its liabilities that come due in the near future (up to one year). The
ratio is a rough indicator of whether cash on hand plus the cash to be col-
lected from accounts receivable and from selling inventory will be enough to
pay off the liabilities that will come due in the next period.
As you can imagine, lenders are particularly keen on punching in the num-
bers to calculate the current ratio. Here’s how they do it:
Current assets ÷ Current liabilities = Current ratio
Note: Unlike most other financial ratios, you don’t multiply the result of this
equation by 100 and represent it as a percentage.
Businesses are generally expected to maintain a minimum 2 to 1 current
ratio, which means its current assets should be twice its current liabilities. In
fact, a business may be legally required to stay above a minimum current
ratio as stipulated in its contracts with lenders. The business in Figure 13-2
has $136,650,000 in current assets and $58,855,000 in current liabilities, so its
current ratio is 2.3. It shouldn’t have to worry about lenders coming by in the
middle of the night to break its legs. Chapter 5 discusses current assets and
current liabilities and how they are reported in the balance sheet.
Acid-test ratio
Most serious investors and lenders don’t stop with the current ratio for test-
ing the business’s short-term solvency (its capability to pay the liabilities
that will come due in the short term). Investors, and especially lenders, cal-
culate the acid-test ratio — also known as the quick ratio or the pounce ratio —
which is a more severe test of a business’s solvency than the current ratio.
The acid-test ratio excludes inventory and prepaid expenses, which the cur-
rent ratio includes, and it limits assets to cash and items that the business
can quickly convert to cash. This limited category of assets is known as quick
or liquid assets.
You calculate the acid-test ratio as follows:
Liquid assets ÷ Current liabilities = Acid-test ratio
Note: Like the current ratio, you don’t multiply the result of this equation by
100 and represent it as a percentage.
287
Chapter 13: How Lenders and Investors Read a Financial Report

The business example in Figure 13-2 has two “quick” assets: $14.85 million
cash and $42.5 million accounts receivable, for a total of $57.35 million. (If it
had any short-term marketable securities, this asset would be included in its
total quick assets.) Total quick assets are divided by current liabilities to
determine the company’s acid-test ratio, as follows:
$57,350,000 quick assets ÷ $58,855,000 current
liabilities = .97 acid-test ratio
Its .97 to 1.00 acid-test ratio means that the business would be just about able
to pay off its short-term liabilities from its cash on hand plus collection of its
accounts receivable. The general rule is that the acid-test ratio should be at
least 1.0, which means that liquid (quick) assets should equal current liabili-
ties. Of course, falling below 1.0 doesn’t mean that the business is on the verge
of bankruptcy, but if the ratio falls as low as 0.5, that may be cause for alarm.
This ratio is also known as the pounce ratio to emphasize that you’re calculating
for a worst-case scenario, where a pack of wolves (known as creditors) could
pounce on the business and demand quick payment of the business’s liabilities.
But don’t panic. Short-term creditors do not have the right to demand immedi-
ate payment, except under unusual circumstances. This ratio is a very conserv-
ative way to look at a business’s capability to pay its short-term liabilities — too
conservative in most cases.
Return on assets (ROA) ratio 
and financial leverage gain
As I discuss in Chapter 5, one factor affecting the bottom-line profit of a busi-
ness is whether it uses debt to its advantage. For the year, a business may realize
a financial leverage gain, meaning it earns more profit on the money it has bor-
rowed than the interest paid for the use of that borrowed money. A good part
of a business’s net income for the year could be due to financial leverage.
The first step in determining financial leverage gain is to calculate a busi-
ness’s return on assets (ROA) ratio, which is the ratio of EBIT (earnings
before interest and income tax) to the total capital invested in operating
assets. Here’s how to calculate ROA:
EBIT ÷ Net operating assets = ROA
Note: This equation uses net operating assets, which equals total assets less
the non-interest-bearing operating liabilities of the business. Actually, many
stock analysts and investors use the total assets figure because deducting all
the non-interest-bearing operating liabilities from total assets to determine
288
Part IV: Preparing and Using Financial Reports 

net operating assets is, quite frankly, a nuisance. But I strongly recommend
using net operating assets because that’s the total amount of capital raised
from debt and equity.
Compare ROA with the interest rate: If a business’s ROA is, say, 14 percent
and the interest rate on its debt is, say, 6 percent, the business’s net gain on
its debt capital is 8 percent more than what it’s paying in interest. There’s a
favorable spread of 8 points (one point = 1 percent), which can be multiplied
times the total debt of the business to determine how much of its earnings
before income tax is traceable to financial leverage gain.
In Figure 13-2, notice that the business has $100 million total interest-bearing
debt: $40 million short-term plus $60 million long-term. Its total owners’
equity is $217.72 million. So its net operating assets total is $317.72 million
(which excludes the three short-term non-interest-bearing operating liabili-
ties). The company’s ROA, therefore, is:
$55,570,000 EBIT ÷ $317,720,000 net operating assets 
= 17.5% ROA
The business earned $17.5 million (rounded) on its total debt — 17.5 percent
ROA times $100 million total debt. The business paid only $6.25 million inter-
est on its debt. So the business had $11.25 million financial leverage gain
before income tax ($17.5 million less $6.25 million).
ROA is a useful ratio for interpreting profit performance, aside from determining
financial gain (or loss). ROA is a capital utilization test — how much profit before
interest and income tax was earned on the total capital employed by the busi-
ness. The basic idea is that it takes money (assets) to make money (profit); the
final test is how much profit was made on the assets. If, for example, a business
earns $1 million EBIT on $25 million assets, its ROA is only 4 percent. Such a
low ROA signals that the business is making poor use of its assets and will have
to improve its ROA or face serious problems in the future.
Frolicking Through the Footnotes
Reading the footnotes in annual financial reports is no walk in the park. The
investment pros read them because in providing consultation to their clients
they are required to comply with due diligence standards — or because of
their legal duties and responsibilities of managing other peoples’ money. When
I was an accounting professor, I had to stay on top of financial reporting; every
year I read a sample of annual financial reports to keep up with current practices.
But beyond the group of people who get paid to read financial reports, does
anyone read footnotes?
289
Chapter 13: How Lenders and Investors Read a Financial Report

For a company you’ve invested in (or are considering investing in), I suggest
that you do a quick read-through of the footnotes and identify the ones that
seem to have the most significance. Generally, the most important footnotes
are those dealing with the following matters:
 Stock options awarded by the business to its executives: The additional
stock shares issued under stock options dilute (thin out) the earnings per
share of the business, which in turn puts downside pressure on the market
value of its stock shares, assuming everything else remains the same.
 Pending lawsuits, litigation, and investigations by government agen-
cies: These intrusions into the normal affairs of the business can have
enormous consequences.
 Employee retirement and other post-retirement benefit plans: Your
main concerns here should be whether these future obligations of the
business are seriously underfunded. I have to warn you that this particu-
lar footnote is one of the most complex pieces of communication you’ll
ever encounter. Good luck.
 Debt problems: It’s not unusual for companies to get into problems with
their debt. Debt contracts with lenders can be very complex and are
financial straitjackets in some ways. A business may fall behind in making
interest and principal payments on one or more of its debts, which triggers
provisions in the debt contracts that give its lenders various options to
protect their rights. Some debt problems are normal, but in certain cases
lenders can threaten drastic action against a business, which should be
discussed in its footnotes.
 Segment information for the business: Public businesses have to report
information for the major segments of the organization — sales and
operating profit by territories or product lines. This gives a better
glimpse of the different parts making up the whole business. (Segment
information may be reported elsewhere in an annual financial report
than in the footnotes, or you may have to go to the SEC filings of the
business to find this information.)
These are a few of the important pieces of information you should look for in
footnotes. But you have to stay alert for other critical matters that a business
may disclose in its footnotes, so I suggest scanning each and every footnote
for potentially important information. Finding a footnote that discusses a
major lawsuit against the business, for example, may make the stock too
risky for your stock portfolio.

Part IV: Preparing and Using Financial Reports 

Checking for Ominous Skies 
in the Auditor’s Report
The value of analyzing a financial report depends on the accuracy of the report’s
numbers. Understandably, top management wants to present the best possible
picture of the business in its financial report. The managers have a vested inter-
est in the profit performance and financial condition of the business; their yearly
bonuses usually depend on recorded profit, for instance. As I mention several
times in this book, the top managers and their accountants prepare the financial
statements of the business and write the footnotes. This situation is somewhat
like the batter in a baseball game calling the strikes and balls. Where’s the
umpire?
Independent CPA auditors are like umpires in the financial reporting game. The
CPA comes in, does an audit of the business’s accounting system and methods,
and gives a report that is attached to the company’s financial statements.
Publicly owned businesses are required to have their annual financial reports
audited by independent CPA firms, and many privately owned businesses have
audits done, too, because they know that an audit report adds credibility to the
financial report.
What if a private business’s financial report doesn’t include an audit report?
Well, you have to trust that the business prepared accurate financial statements
following authoritative accounting and financial reporting standards and that
the footnotes to the financial statements cover all important points and issues.
Unfortunately, the audit report gets short shrift in financial statement analysis,
maybe because it’s so full of technical terminology and accountant doubles-
peak. But even though audit reports are a tough read, anyone who reads and
analyzes financial reports should definitely read the audit report. Chapter 15
provides more information on audits and the auditor’s report.
The auditor judges whether the business’s accounting methods are in accor-
dance with appropriate accounting and financial reporting standards — gen-
erally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) for businesses in the United
States. In most cases, the auditor’s report confirms that everything is hunky-
dory, and you can rely on the financial report. However, sometimes an audi-
tor waves a yellow flag — and in extreme cases, a red flag. Here are the two
important warnings to watch out for in an audit report:
 The business’s capability to continue normal operations is in doubt
because of what are known as financial exigencies, which may mean a
low cash balance, unpaid overdue liabilities, or major lawsuits that the
business doesn’t have the cash to cover.
291
Chapter 13: How Lenders and Investors Read a Financial Report

 One or more of the methods used in the report are not in complete
agreement with appropriate accounting standards, leading the auditor to
conclude that the numbers reported are misleading or that disclosure is
inadequate. (Look for language in the auditor’s report to this effect.)
Although auditor warnings don’t necessarily mean that a business is going
down the tubes, they should turn on that light bulb in your head and make
you more cautious and skeptical about the financial report. The auditor is
questioning the very information on which the business’s value is based, and
you can’t take that kind of thing lightly.
Also, just because a business has a clean audit report doesn’t mean that the
financial report is completely accurate and aboveboard. As I discuss in Chapter
15, auditors don’t always catch everything, and they sometimes fail to discover
major accounting fraud. Also, the implementation of accounting methods is
fairly flexible, leaving room for interpretation and creativity that’s just short of
cooking the books (deliberately defrauding and misleading readers of the finan-
cial report). Some massaging of the numbers is tolerated, which may mean that
what you see on the financial report isn’t exactly an untarnished picture of the
business. I explain window dressing and profit smoothing — two common exam-
ples of massaging the numbers — in Chapter 12.

How Business Managers Use 
a Financial Report
In This Chapter
 Recognizing the limits of external financial statements
 Locating detailed financial condition information
 Identifying more in-depth profit information
 Looking for additional cash flow information
I
f you’re a business manager, I strongly suggest that you read Chapter 13
before continuing with this one. Chapter 13 discusses how a business’s
lenders and investors read its financial reports. These stakeholders are enti-
tled to regular financial reports so they can determine whether the business
is making good use of their money. The chapter explains key ratios that the
external stakeholders can use for interpreting the financial condition and
profit performance of a business.
Business managers should understand the financial statement ratios in
Chapter 13. Every ratio does double duty; it’s useful to business lenders and
investors and equally useful to business managers. For example, the profit
ratio and return on assets ratio are extraordinarily important to both the
external stakeholders and the managers of a business — the first measures
the profit yield from sales revenue, and the second measures profit on the
assets employed by the business.
But as important as they are, the external financial statements do not provide
all the accounting information that managers need to plan and control the
financial affairs of a business. Managers need additional information. Managers
who look no further than the external financial statements are being very
shortsighted — they don’t have all the information they need to do their jobs.
The accounts reported in external financial statements are like the table of con-
tents of a book; each account is like a chapter title. Managers need to do more
than skim chapter titles. As the radio personality Paul Harvey would say, man-
agers need to look at the rest of the story.

294
Part IV: Preparing and Using Financial Reports 
This chapter looks behind the accounts reported in the external financial
statements. I explain the types of additional accounting information that man-
agers need in order to control financial condition and performance, and to
plan the financial future of a business.
Building on the Foundation of the
External Financial Statements
Managers are problems solvers. Every business has some problems, perhaps
even some serious ones. However, external financial statements are not
designed to expose those problems. Except in extreme cases — in which the
business is obviously in dire financial straits — you’d never learn about its
problems just from reading its external financial statements. To borrow lyrics
from an old Bing Crosby song, external financial statements are designed to
“accentuate the positive, eliminate the negative . . . [and] don’t mess with
Mister In-Between.”
Seeking out problems and opportunities
Business managers need more accounting information than what’s disclosed
in external financial statements for two basic purposes:
 To alert them to problems that exist or may be emerging that threaten the
profit performance, cash flow, and financial condition of the business
 To suggest opportunities for improving the financial performance and
health of the business
A popular expression these days is “mining the data.” The accounting system
of a business is a rich mother lode of management information, but you have
to dig that information out of the accounting database. Working with the con-
troller (chief accountant), a manager should decide what information she
needs beyond what is reported in the external financial statements.
Avoiding information overload
Business manages are very busy people. Nothing is more frustrating than get-
ting reams of information that you have no use for. For that reason, the con-
troller should guard carefully against information overload. While some types
of accounting information should stream to business managers on a regular
basis, other types should be provided only on as as-needed basis.

Ideally, the controller reads the mind of every manager and provides exactly
the accounting information that each manager needs. In practice, that can’t
always happen, of course. A manager may not be certain about which infor-
mation she needs and which she doesn’t. The flow of information has to be
worked out over time.
Furthermore, how to communicate the information is open to debate and
individual preferences. Some of the additional management information can
be put in the main body of an accounting report, but most is communicated
in supplemental schedules, graphs, and commentary. The information may
be delivered to the manager’s computer, or the manager may be given the
option to call up selected information from the accounting database of the
business.
My point is simply this: Managers and controllers must communicate — early
and often — to make sure managers get what they need without being swamped
with unnecessary data. No one wants to waste precious time compiling reports
that are never read. So before a controller begins the process of compiling
accounting information for managers’ eyes only, be sure there’s ample commu-
nication about what each manager needs.
Gathering Financial 
Condition Information
The balance sheet — one of three primary financial statements included in a
financial report — summarizes the financial condition of the business. Figure
14-1 lists the basic accounts in a balance sheet, without dollar amounts for
the accounts and without subtotals and totals. Just 12 accounts are given in
Figure 14-1: five assets (counting fixed assets and accumulated depreciation
as only one account), five liabilities, and two owners’ equity accounts. A busi-
ness may report more than just these 12 accounts. For instance, a business
may invest in marketable securities, or have receivables from loans made to
officers of the business. A business may have intangible assets. A business
corporation may issue more than one class of capital stock and would report
a separate account for each class. And so on. The idea of Figure 14-1 is to
focus on the core assets and liabilities of a typical business.
295
Chapter 14: How Business Managers Use a Financial Report

Cash
The external balance sheet reports just one cash account. But many busi-
nesses keep several bank checking and deposit accounts, and some (such as
gambling casinos and food supermarkets) keep a fair amount of currency on
hand. A business may have foreign bank deposits in euros, English pounds,
or other currencies. Most businesses set up separate checking accounts for
payroll; only payroll checks are written against these accounts.
Managers should monitor the balances in every cash account in order to
control and optimize the deployment of their cash resources. So, information
about each bank account should be reported to the manager.
Managers should ask these questions regarding cash:
 Is the ending balance of cash the actual amount at the balance sheet
date, or did the business engage in window dressing in order to inflate its
ending cash balance? Window dressing refers to holding the books open
after the ending balance sheet date in order to record additional cash
inflow as if the cash was received on the last day of the period. Window
dressing is not uncommon. (For more details, see Chapter 12.) If window
dressing has gone on, the manager should know the true, actual ending
cash balance of the business.
 Were there any cash out days during the year? In other words, did the
company’s cash balance actually fall to zero (or near zero) during the
year? How often did this happen? Is there a seasonal fluctuation in cash
flow that causes “low tide” for cash, or are the cash out days due to run-
ning the business with too little cash?

to the loan balance? In this situation the cash balance is not fully available
for general operating purposes.
 Are there any out-of-the-ordinary demands on cash? For example, a busi-
ness may have entered into buyout agreements with a key shareholder
or with a vendor to escape the terms of an unfavorable contract. Any
looming demands on cash should be reported to managers.
Accounts receivable
A business that makes sales on credit has the accounts receivable asset —
unless it has collected all its customers’ receivables by the end of the year,
which is not very likely. To be more correct, the business has hundreds or
thousands of individual accounts receivable from its credit customers. In its
external balance sheet, a business reports just one summary amount for all
its accounts receivable. However, this total amount is not nearly enough
information for the business manager.
Here are questions a manager should ask about accounts receivable:
 Of the total amount of accounts receivable, how much is current (within
the normal credit terms offered to customers), slightly past due, and
seriously past due? A past due receivable causes a delay in cash flow
and increases the risk of it becoming a bad debt (a receivable that ends
up being partially or wholly uncollectible).
 Has an adequate amount been recorded for bad debts? Is the company’s
method for determining its bad debts expense consistent year to year?
Was the estimate of bad debts this period tweaked in order to boost or
dampen profit for the period? Has the IRS raised any questions about
the company’s method for writing off bad debts? (Chapter 7 discusses
bad debts expense.)
 Who owes the most money to the business? (The manager should
receive a schedule of customers that shows this information.) Which
customers are the slowest payers? Do the sales prices to these cus-
tomers take into account that they typically do not pay on time?
It’s also useful to know which customers pay quickly to take advantage
of prompt payment discounts. In short, the payment profiles of credit
customers are important information for managers.
 Are there “stray” receivables buried in the accounts receivable total? A
business may loan money to its managers and employees or to other
businesses. There may be good business reasons for such loans. In any
case, these receivables should not be included with accounts receivable,
which should be reserved for receivables from credit sales to cus-
tomers. Other receivables should be listed in a separate schedule.
297
Chapter 14: How Business Managers Use a Financial Report

Inventory
For businesses that sell products, inventory is typically a major asset. It’s
also typically the most problematic asset from both the management and
accounting points of view. First off, the manager should understand the
accounting method being used to determine the cost of inventory and the
cost of goods sold expense. (You may want to quickly review the section in
Chapter 7 that covers this topic.) In particular, the manager should have a
good feel regarding whether the accounting method results in conservative
or liberal profit measures.
Managers should ask these questions regarding inventory:
 How long, on average, do products remain in the warehouse before they
are sold? The manager should receive a turnover analysis of inventory that
clearly exposes the holding periods of products. Slow-moving products
cause nothing but problems. The manager should ferret out products that
have been held in inventory too long. The cost of these sluggish products
may have to be written down or written off, and the manager has to autho-
rize these accounting entries. The manager should review the sales
demand for slow-moving products, of course.
 If the business uses the LIFO method (last-in, first-out), was there a LIFO
liquidation gain during the period that caused an artificial and one-time
boost in profit for the year? (I explain this aspect of the LIFO method in
Chapter 7.)
The manager should also request these reports:
 Inventory reports that include side-by-side comparison of the costs and
the sales prices of products (or at least the major products sold by the
business). It’s helpful to include the mark-up percent for each product,
which allows the manager to focus on mark-up percent differences from
product to product.
 Regular reports summarizing major product cost changes during the
period, and forecasts of near-term changes. It may be useful to report 
the current replacement cost of inventory assuming it’s feasible to
determine this amount.
Prepaid expenses
Generally, the business manager doesn’t need too much additional informa-
tion on this asset. However, there may be a major decrease or increase in this
asset from a year ago that is not consistent with the growth or decline in sales
from year to year. The manager should pay attention to an abnormal change in
the asset. Perhaps a new type of cost has to be prepaid now, such as insurance
298
Part IV: Preparing and Using Financial Reports 

coverage for employee safety triggered by an OSHA audit of the employee
working conditions in the business. A brief schedule of the major types of
prepaid expenses is useful.
Fixed assets and accumulated depreciation
Fixed assets is the all-inclusive term for the wide range of long-term operating
assets used by a business — from buildings and heavy machinery to office
furniture. Except for the cost of land, the cost of a fixed asset is spread over
its estimated useful life to the business; the amount allocated to each period
is called depreciation expense. The manager should know the company’s
accounting policy regarding which fixed assets are capitalized (the cost is
recorded in a fixed asset account) and which are expensed immediately (the
cost is recorded entirely to expense at the time of purchase).
Most businesses adopt a cost limit below which minor fixed assets (a screw-
driver, stapler, or wastebasket, for example) are recorded to expense instead
of being depreciated over some number of years. The controller should alert
the manager if an unusually high amount of these small cost fixed assets were
charged off to expense during the year, which could have a significant impact
on the bottom line.
The manager should be aware of the general accounting policies of the busi-
ness regarding estimating useful lives of fixed assets and whether the
straight-line or accelerated methods of allocation are used. Indeed, the man-
ager should have a major voice in deciding these policies, and not simply
defer to the controller. In Chapter 7, I explain these accounting issues.
Using accelerated depreciation methods may result in certain fixed assets
that are fully depreciated. These assets should be reported to the manager —
even though they have a zero book value — so the manager is aware that
these fixed assets are still being used but no depreciation expense is being
recorded for their use.
Generally, the manager does not need to know the current replacement costs
of all fixed assets — just those that will be replaced in the near future. At the
same time, it is useful for the manager to get a status report on the com-
pany’s fixed assets, which takes more of an engineering approach than an
accounting approach. The status report includes information on the capacity,
operating efficiency, and projected remaining life of each major fixed asset.
The status report should include leased assets that are not owned by the
business and which, therefore, are not included in the fixed asset account.
The manager needs an insurance summary report for all fixed assets that are
(or should be) insured for fire and other casualty losses, which lists the types
of coverage on each major fixed asset, deductibles, claims during the year,
299
Chapter 14: How Business Managers Use a Financial Report

and so on. Also, the manager needs a list of the various liability risks of
owning and using the fixed assets. The manager has to decide whether the
risks should be insured.
Accounts payable
As you know, individuals have credit scores that affect their ability to borrow
money and the interest rates they have to pay. Likewise, businesses have credit
scores. If a business has a really bad credit rating, it may not be able to buy on
credit and may have to pay exorbitant interest rates. I don’t have space here to
go into the details of how credit rankings are developed for businesses. Suffice
it to say that a business should pay its bills on time. If a business consistently
pays its accounts payable late, this behavior gets reported to a credit rating
agency (such as Dun & Bradstreet).
The manager needs a schedule of accounts payable that are past due (beyond
the credit terms given by the vendors and suppliers). Of course, the manager
should know the reasons that the accounts have become overdue. The man-
ager may have to personally contact these creditors and convince them to
continue offering credit to the business.
Frankly, some businesses operate on the principle of paying late. Their standard
operating procedure is to pay their accounts payable two, three, or more weeks
after the due dates. This could be due to not having adequate cash balances or
wanting to hang on to their cash as long as possible. Years ago, IBM was notori-
ous for paying late, but because its credit rating was unimpeachable, it got away
with this policy.
Accrued expenses payable
The controller should prepare a schedule for the manager that lists the major
items making up the balance of the accrued expenses payable liability account.
Many operating liabilities accumulate or, as accountants prefer to say, accrue
during the course of the year that are not paid until sometime later. One main
example is employee vacation and sick pay; an employee may work for almost a
year before being entitled to take two weeks vacation with pay. The accountant
records an expense each payroll period for this employee benefit, and it accu-
mulates in the liability account until the liability is paid (the employee takes his
vacation). Another payroll-based expense that accrues is the cost of federal and
state unemployment taxes on the employer.
Accrued expenses payable can be a tricky liability from the accounting point
of view. There’s a lot of room for management discretion (or manipulation,
depending on how you look at it) regarding which particular operating liabilities
to record as expense during the year, and which not to record as expense until
300
Part IV: Preparing and Using Financial Reports 

they are paid. The basic choice is whether to expense as you go or expense
later. If you decide to record the expense as you go through the year, the
accountant has to make estimates and assumptions, which are subject to
error. Then there’s the question of expediency. Employee vacation and sick
pay may seem to be obvious expenses to accrue, but in fact many businesses
do not accrue the expense on the grounds that it’s simply too time consum-
ing and, furthermore, that some employees quit and forfeit the rights to their
vacations.
Many businesses guarantee the products they sell for a certain period of
time, such as 90 days or one year. The customer has the right to return the
product for repair (or replacement) during the guarantee period. For exam-
ple, when I returned my iPod for repair, Apple should have already recorded
in a liability account the estimated cost of repairing iPods that will be returned
after the point of sale. Businesses have more “creeping” liabilities than you
might imagine. With a little work, I could list 20 or 30 of them, but I’ll spare you
the details. My main point is that the manager should know what’s in the
accrued expenses payable liability account, and what’s not. Also, the manager
should have a good fix on when these liabilities will be paid.
Income tax payable
It takes an income tax professional to comply with federal and state income
tax laws on business. The manager should make certain that the accountant
responsible for its tax returns is qualified and up-to-date.
The controller should explain to the manager the reasons for a relatively large
balance in this liability account at the end of the year. In a normal situation, a
business should have paid 90 percent or more of its annual income tax by the
end of the year. However, there are legitimate reasons that the ending balance
of the income tax liability could be relatively large compared with the annual
income tax expense — say 20 or 30 percent of the annual expense. It behooves
the manager to know the basic reasons for a large ending balance in the
income tax liability. The controller should report these reasons to the chief
financial officer and perhaps the treasurer of the business.
The manager should also know how the business stands with the IRS, and
whether the IRS has raised objections to the business’s tax returns. The busi-
ness may be in the middle of legal proceedings with the IRS, which the man-
ager should be briefed on, of course. The CEO and (perhaps other top-level
managers) should be given a frank appraisal of how things may turn out and
whether the business is facing any additional tax payments and penalties.
Needless to say, this is very sensitive information, and the controller may
prefer that none of it be documented in a written report.
301
Chapter 14: How Business Managers Use a Financial Report

Finally, the chief executive officer working closely with the controller should
decide how aggressive to be on income tax issues and alternatives. Keep in
mind that tax avoidance is legal, but tax evasion is illegal. As you probably
know, the income tax law is exceedingly complex, but ignorance of the law is
no excuse. The controller should make abundantly clear to the manager
whether the business is walking on thin ice in its income tax returns.
Interest-bearing debt
In Figure 14-1, the balance sheet reports two interest-bearing liabilities: one for
short-term debts (those due in one year or less) and one for long-term debt.
The reason is that financial reporting standards require that external balance
sheets report the amount of current liabilities so the reader can compare this
amount of short-term liabilities against the total of current assets (cash and
assets that will be converted into cash in the short term). Interest-bearing debt
that is due in one year or less is included in the current liabilities section of the
balance sheet. (See Chapter 5 for more details.)
The amounts of the short-term and long-term debt accounts reported in the
external balance sheet are not enough information for the manager.
The best practice is to lay out in one comprehensive schedule for the man-
ager all the interest-bearing obligations of the business. The obligations
should be organized according to their due (maturity) dates, and the sched-
ule should include other relevant information such as the lender, the interest
rate on each debt, the plans to roll over the debt (or not), the collateral, and
the main covenants and restrictions on the business imposed by the lender.
Recall that debt is one of the two sources of capital to a business (the other
being owners’ equity, which I get to next). The sustainability of a business
depends on the sustainability of its sources of capital. The more a business
depends on debt capital, the more important it is to manage its debt well and
maintain excellent relations with its lenders.
Raising and using debt and equity capital, referred to as financial manage-
ment or corporate finance, is a broad subject that extends beyond the scope
of this book. For more information, look at Small Business Financial Management
Kit For Dummies (Wiley) — a book that my son, Tage C. Tracy, and I coauthored,
which explains the financial management function in more detail.
302
Part IV: Preparing and Using Financial Reports 

Owners’ equity
External balance sheets report two kinds of ownership accounts: one for
capital invested by the owners in the business and one for retained earnings
(profit that has not been distributed to shareowners). In Figure 14-1, just one
invested capital account is shown in the owners’ equity section, as if the busi-
ness has only one class of owners’ equity. In fact, business corporations, limited
liability companies, partnerships, and other types of business legal entities can
have complex ownership structures. The owners’ equity sections in their bal-
ance sheets report several invested capital accounts — one for each class of
ownership interest in the business.
Broadly speaking, the manager faces three basic issues regarding the owners’
equity of the business:
 Is more capital needed from the owners?
 Should some capital be returned to the owners?
 Can and should the business make a cash distribution from profit to the
owners and, if so, how much?
These questions belong in the field of financial management and extend beyond
the scope of this book. However, I should mention that the external financial
statements are very useful in deciding these key financial management issues.
For example, the manager needs to know how much total capital is needed to
support the sales level of the business. The asset turnover ratio (annual sales
revenue divided by total assets) provides a good touchstone for determining
the amount of capital that is needed for sales.
The external financial report of a business does not disclose the individual
shareowners of the business and the number of shares each person or insti-
tution owns. The manager may want to know this information. Any major
change in the ownership of the business usually is important information to
the manager.
Culling Profit Information
The sales and expenses of a business over a period of time are summarized in
a financial statement called the income statement. Profit (sales revenue minus
expenses) is the bottom line of the income statement. Chapter 4 explains the
externally reported income statement, as well as how sales revenue and
expenses are interconnected with the operating assets and liabilities of the
business. The income statement fits hand in glove with the balance sheet.
303
Chapter 14: How Business Managers Use a Financial Report

Chapter 9 explains internal profit reports to managers, which are called P&L
(profit and loss) reports. P&L reports should be designed to help managers
in their profit analysis and decision making. Chapter 9 is the logical take-off
point for this section, in which I discuss the types of profit information man-
agers need.
Margin: The catalyst of profit
A business makes profit by earning total margin that exceeds its total
fixed expenses for the period. Margin equals sales revenue minus all variable
expenses of generating the sales revenue. Cost of goods sold is the main
variable expense for companies that sell products. Most businesses have
other significant variable expenses, which depend either on sales volume
(the quantity of products or services sold) or the dollar amount of sales
revenue. P&L reports to managers should separate variable from fixed
operating expenses, in order to measure margin.
Figure 14-2 presents a skeleton of the P&L report. No dollar amounts are given
because I focus on the kinds of information that managers need in order to ana-
lyze and control profit. Note that operating expenses below the gross margin
line are classified between variable and fixed. Therefore, the P&L report
includes margin (profit before fixed operating expenses). Income statements in
external financial reports do not classify the behavior of operating expenses.
The P&L report stops at the operating profit line, or earnings before interest
and income tax expenses. (Interest is in the hands of the chief financial offi-
cer of the business, and income tax is best left to tax professionals.)

Part IV: Preparing and Using Financial Reports 

Most businesses sell a wide variety of products and have many sources of
sales revenue. The margins per unit on each source of sales vary. It’s quite
unusual to find a business that earns the same margin ratio on all its sales.
The manager needs information on sales revenue and margin for each main-
stream source of sales. But the term “mainstream source of sales” will have
very different meanings for each business. In analyzing profit, one of the main
challenges facing business managers is deciding how to organize, categorize,
and aggregate the huge volume of data on sales and expenses.
For example, consider a hardware store in Boulder, Colorado that sells more
than 100,000 different products (including different sizes of the same products).
Suppose it has ten key managers with sales and profit responsibility. This means
that each manager would be responsible for 10,000 different sources of sales. It
would be possible to report every specific sale to the manager, but this would
be absurd! The same is true for a high-volume retailer like Target or Costco. For
a Honda or Toyota auto dealer, on the other hand, reporting each new car sale
to the manager would be practical.
Regardless of how sales are reported to the manager, all variable expenses of
each sales source should be matched against the sales revenue in order to
determine margin for that source. The alternative is to match only the cost of
goods sold expense with sales revenue, which means that the manager knows
only gross margin instead of final margin (after variable operating expenses
are also deducted from sales revenue).
Sales revenue and expenses
In this section, I offer examples of sales revenue and expense information that
managers need that is not reported in the external income statement of a
business. Given the very broad range of different businesses and different
circumstances, I can’t offer much detail.
Here’s a sampling of the kinds of accounting information that business managers
need either in their P&L reports or in supplementary schedules and analyses:
 Sales volumes (quantities sold) for all sources of sales revenue.
 List sales prices and discounts, allowances, and rebates against list
sales prices. For many businesses (but not all), sales pricing is a two-
sided affair that starts with list prices (such as manufacturer’s suggested
retail price) and includes deductions of all sorts from the list prices.
 Sales returns — products that were bought but later returned by
customers.
 Special incentives offer by suppliers that effectively reduce the pur-
chase cost of products.
305
Chapter 14: How Business Managers Use a Financial Report

 Abnormal charges for embezzlement and fraud losses.
 Significant variations in discretionary expenses from year to year, such
as repair and maintenance, employee training costs, and advertising.
 Illegal payments to secure business, including bribes, kickbacks, and
other under-the-table payments. Keep in mind that businesses are not
willing to admit to making such payments, much less report them in
internal communications. Therefore, the manager should know how
these payments are disguised in the accounts of the business.
 Sales revenue and margin for new products.
 Significant changes in fixed costs and reasons for the changes.
 Expenses that surged much more than increases in sales volume or
sales revenue.
 New expenses that show up for first time.
 Accounting changes (if any) regarding when sales revenue and expenses
are recorded.
The above items do not constitute an exhaustive list. But the list covers many
important types of information that managers need in order to interpret their
P&L reports and to plan profit improvements in the future. Analyzing profit is a
very open-ended process. There are many ways to slice and dice sales and
expense data. Managers have only so much time at their disposal, but they
should take the time to understand and analyze the main factors that drive
profit.
Digging into Cash Flow Information
Chapter 6 explains the statement of cash flows included in a business’s external
financial report. Cash flows are divided into three types:
 Cash flows from operating activities (“operating” refers to making sales
and incurring expenses in the process of earning profit)
 Cash flows from investing activities (outlays for new long-term assets
and proceeds from disposals of these assets)
 Cash flows from financing activities (borrowing and repaying debt; raising
capital from and returning capital to owners; and cash distributions
from profit to owners)
306
Part IV: Preparing and Using Financial Reports 

Distinguishing investing and financing
cash flows from operating cash flows
Investing and financing decisions are the heart of business financial manage-
ment. Every business must secure and invest capital. No capital, no business —
it’s as simple as that. Inadequate capital clamps limits on the growth potential of
a business. In larger businesses, the financing and investing activities are the
domain of the chief financial officer (CFO), who works with other high-level
executives in setting the financial strategies and policies of the business.
The field of financial management — raising capital for a business and deploying
its capital — is beyond the scope of this book. For more information, you can
refer to the book I coauthored with my son, Small Business Financial Management
Kit For Dummies (Wiley).
This section concentrates on cash flow from operating activities. These cash
flows are in the domain of managers with operating responsibilities — man-
agers who have responsibilities for sales and the expenses that are directly
connected with making sales. These managers should understand the cash
flow impacts of their sales and expenses. (See the sidebar “Cash flow charac-
teristics of sales and expenses.”) Their sales and expense decisions drive the
operating activity cash flows of the business.
307
Chapter 14: How Business Managers Use a Financial Report
Cash flow characteristics of sales and expenses
In reading their P&L reports, managers should
keep in mind that the accountant records sales
revenue when sales are made — regardless of
when cash is received from customers. Also,
the accountant records expenses to match
expenses with sales revenue and to put
expenses in the period where they belong —
regardless of when cash is paid for the
expenses. The manager should not assume that
sales revenue equals cash inflow, and that
expenses equal cash outflow.
The cash flow characteristics of sales and
expenses are summarized as follows:
 Cash sales generate immediate cash inflow.
Keep in mind that sales returns and sales
price adjustments after the point of sale
reduce cash flow.
 Credit sales do not generate immediate
cash inflow. There’s no cash flow until the
customers’ receivables are actually col-
lected. There’s a cash flow lag from credit
sales.
 Many operating costs are not paid until sev-
eral weeks (or months) after they are
recorded as expense; and a few operating
costs are paid before the costs are charged
to expense.
 Depreciation expense is recorded by
reducing the book value of an asset and
does not involve cash outlay in the period
when it is recorded. The business paid out
cash when the asset was acquired.
(Amortization expense on intangible assets
is the same.)

Managing operating cash flows
In a small, one-owner/one-manager business, one person has to manage both
profit and cash flow from profit. In larger businesses, managers who have profit
responsibility may or may not have cash flow responsibility. The profit manager
may ignore the cash flow aspects of his sales and expense activities. The
responsibility for controlling cash flow falls on some other manager. Of course,
someone should manage the cash flows of sales and expenses. The following
comments speak to this person in particular.
The net cash flow during the period from carrying on profit-making operations
depends on the changes in the operating assets and liabilities directly connected
with sales revenue and expenses. Figure 14-3 highlights these assets and liabili-
ties, and also retained earnings. Changes in these accounts during the year
determine the cash flow from operating activities. In other words, changes in
these accounts boost or crimp cash flow.
Note that retained earnings is highlighted in Figure 14-3. Profit increases this
owners’ equity account. Profit is the starting point for determining cash flow
from operating activities. (Alternatively, a business may use the direct
method for determining and reporting cash flow from operating activities,
which I explain in Chapter 6.)

Part IV: Preparing and Using Financial Reports 

The cash flow from profit is determined as follows:
1. Start with the accounting profit number, usually labeled net income.
2. Add depreciation expense (and amortization expense, if any) because
there is no cash outlay for the expense during the period.
3. Deduct increases or add decreases in operating assets because
• An increase requires additional cash outlay to build up the asset.
• A decrease means part of the asset is liquidated and provides
cash.
4. Add increases or deduct decreases in operating liabilities because
• An increase means less cash is paid out than the expense.
• A decrease means more cash is paid out to reduce the liability.
You may ask: What about changes during the year in those balance sheet
accounts that are not highlighted in Figure 14-3? Well, these changes are
reported either in the cash flow from investing activities or the cash flow from
financing activities sections of the statement of cash flows. So, all balance
sheet account changes during the year end up in the statement of cash flows.
The manager should closely monitor the changes in operating assets and lia-
bilities (see Figure 14-3). A good general rule is that each operating asset and
liability should change about the same percent as the percent change in the
sales activity of the business. If sales revenue increases, say, 10 percent, then
operating assets and liabilities should increase about 10 percent. The per-
cents of increases in the operating assets and liabilities (in particular,
accounts receivable, inventory, accounts payable, and accrued expenses
payable) should be emphasized in the cash flow report to the manager. The
manager should not have to take out his calculator and do these calculations.
Controlling cash flow from profit (operating activities) means controlling
changes in the operating assets and liabilities of making sales and incurring
expenses: There’s no getting around this fact of business life. There’s no
doubt that cash flow is king. You can be making good profit, but if you don’t
turn the profit into cash flow quickly, you are headed for big trouble.

 Dealing with managers who massage the numbers
 Coping with fraud (if you can find it)
 Auditing the auditors
S
uppose you’re one of the external shareowners of a business or one of its
lenders. You depend on its financial reports for the information you need
about your stake in the business. How can you be sure that its accounting
methods conform with established standards? How do you know whether the
business makes adequate disclosure in its financial reports? Is the business
playing by the rules in measuring its profit and in releasing financial informa-
tion? You trust the managers, or you wouldn’t have put your money in the
business. But you still have these nagging questions. Well, in business, as in
politics, the answer is: Trust, but verify.
Many businesses hire an independent CPA (certified public accountant) to
audit their financial reports. An audit provides assurance that the financial
report of the business is correct and not misleading. The CPA examines the
evidence and renders a report. The auditor’s report says that the business
uses proper accounting methods and its financial report provides adequate
disclosure. Or not. Things get messy when the auditor finds fault with the
accounting or financial disclosure of the business. But it’s better to be
warned than to continue on your merry way and be unaware of the deficien-
cies in the business’s financial report.
A financial report can be wrong and misleading because of innocent, uninten-
tional errors, or because of deliberate cold-blooded fraud. Errors can happen
because of incompetence and carelessness. Fraud happens when the company’s
accountants and managers are crooks. The CPA auditor should definitely catch
all significant errors. The auditor’s responsibility for discovering fraud is not as
clear-cut. You may think catching fraud is the purpose of an audit, but I’m sorry
to tell you it’s not as simple as that.

312
Part IV: Preparing and Using Financial Reports  
Exploring the Need for Audits
One reason for audits — especially for smaller private companies that do not
employ professionally qualified accountants — is to have a second set of
eyes look over the business’s accounting methods and financial reports. The
investors and lenders of a business are more comfortable having an audit.
Indeed, they may demand an annual audit as a condition of putting their money
in the business. After all, there’s the possibility that not everything is on the
up-and-up in the business and in its financial report.
I hope I’m not the first person to point this out to you, but the business world
is not like Sunday school. Not everything is pure and straight. A business could
deliberately deceive its investors and lenders with false or misleading numbers
in its financial report. That’s where audits come in. Audits are one means of
keeping misleading financial reporting to a minimum.
In a sense, CPA auditors are like highway patrol officers who enforce traffic
laws and issue tickets to keep speeding to a minimum. Or, if you prefer another
analogy, a business having an independent accounting professional come in
once a year to check up on its accounting is like a person getting a physical
exam once a year. The audit exam may uncover problems that the business
was not aware of, and knowing that the auditors come in once a year to take a
close look at things keeps the business on its toes.
After completing an audit examination, the CPA prepares a short report stat-
ing whether the business has prepared its financial report according to the
appropriate U.S. or international accounting and reporting standards (which I
explain in Chapter 2). In this way, audits are an effective means of enforcing
accounting standards. The auditors hold the feet of managers to the fire, or
at least that’s how it should work.
Businesses whose ownership and debt securities (stock shares and bonds)
are traded in public markets in the United States are required to have annual
audits by an independent CPA firm. (The federal securities laws of 1933 and
1934 require audits.) For a publicly traded company, the cost of an annual
audit is the price the company pays for going into public markets for its capi-
tal and for having its securities traded in a public marketplace — which pro-
vides liquidity for its securities, of course.
Although federal law doesn’t require audits for private businesses, banks and
other lenders to private businesses may insist on audited financial statements.
If lenders don’t require audited statements, a business’s shareowners have to
decide whether an audit is a good investment. Of course, audits aren’t cheap.
It’s hard to do an audit of even a small business in less than 100 hours. At $100
per hour (which is probably too low an estimate), the audit fee would be

$10,000. Owners and investors in a private business should balance the cost
of an audit (which they bear) against the benefit of getting more reliable
financial statements from the business.
Instead of a full-fledged audit, which they can’t realistically afford, many smaller
businesses have a CPA come in regularly to look over their accounting methods
and give advice on their financial reporting. Unless a CPA has done a complete
audit, she has to be very careful not to express an opinion of the company’s
financial statements. Without a careful examination of the evidence supporting
the amounts reported in the financial statements, the CPA is in no position to
give an opinion on the financial statements prepared from the accounts of the
business.
What’s in an Auditor’s Report
The large majority of financial statement audit reports give the business a clean
bill of health, or what’s called a clean opinion. (The technical term for this opin-
ion is an unqualified opinion, which means that the auditor does not qualify or
restrict his opinion regarding any significant matter.) At the other end of the
spectrum, the auditor may state that the financial statements are misleading
and should not be relied upon. This negative, disapproving audit report is called
an adverse opinion. That’s the big stick that auditors carry: They have the
power to give a company’s financial statements an adverse opinion, and no
business wants that.
The threat of an adverse opinion almost always motivates a business to give
way to the auditor and change its accounting or disclosure in order to avoid
getting the kiss of death of an adverse opinion. An adverse audit opinion says
that the financial statements of the business are misleading. The Securities and
Exchange Commission (SEC) does not tolerate adverse opinions by auditors of
public businesses; it would suspend trading in a company’s securities if the
company received an adverse opinion from its CPA auditor.
The clean (unqualified) opinion
If the auditor finds no serious problems, the CPA firm gives the business’s
financial statements an unqualified or clean opinion. However, I should warn
you that the standard audit report has enough defensive, legalistic language
to make even a seasoned accountant blush. If you have any doubts, go to the
Web site of any public corporation and look at its most recent financial state-
ments, in particular the auditor’s report.
313
Chapter 15: Audits and Accounting Fraud   

The following summary cuts through the jargon and explains what the audit
report really says:
Standard Audit Report (Unqualified or Clean Opinion)
1st paragraph
We did an audit, but the financial statements
are the responsibility of management; we just
express an opinion of them.
2nd paragraph
We carried out audit procedures that provide
us a reasonable basis for expressing our opin-
ion, but we don’t necessarily catch everything.
3rd paragraph
The company’s financial statements conform
to accounting and financial reporting standards
and are not misleading.
For large public companies (those with over $75 million market cap at the
time of this writing), the auditor’s report must contain a paragraph explaining
that the CPA audited the company’s internal controls over financial reporting,
which expresses an opinion on the effectiveness of these controls. This
extension of the auditor’s report concerning internal controls is the outgrowth
of the financial reporting fraud scandals over the last decade (does Enron ring
a bell?). Top management of the business must also include a statement in the
annual financial report giving their opinion on the company’s financial reporting
internal controls.
Other kinds of audit opinions
An audit report that does not give a clean opinion may look very similar to a
clean-opinion audit report to the untrained eye. Some investors see the name
of a CPA firm next to the financial statements and assume that everything is
okay — after all, if the auditor had seen a problem, the Feds would have pounced
on the business and put everyone in jail, right? Well, not exactly. How do you
know when an auditor’s report may be something other than a straightforward,
no-reservations clean opinion? Look for more language than just the standard three
paragraphs — that’s the key.
Additional language in an audit report is important to look for — it’s never good
news. For example, the auditor’s report may point out a flaw in the company’s
financial statements but not a fatal flaw that would require an adverse opinion.
In this situation, the CPA issues a qualified opinion. The auditor includes a short
explanation of the reasons for the qualification. You don’t see qualified audit
opinions that often, but you should read the auditor’s report to be sure.
314
Part IV: Preparing and Using Financial Reports  

One modification to an auditor’s report is very serious — when the CPA
expresses substantial doubts about the capability of the business to continue as
a going concern. A going concern is a business that has sufficient financial where-
withal and momentum to continue its normal operations into the foreseeable
future and would be able to absorb a bad turn of events without having to default
on its liabilities. A going concern does not face an imminent financial crisis or
any pressing financial emergency. A business could be under some financial
distress but overall still be judged a going concern. Unless there is evidence to
the contrary, the CPA auditor assumes that the business is a going concern.
But in some cases, the auditor may see unmistakable signs that a business is in
deep financial waters and may not be able to convince its creditors and lenders
to give it time to work itself out of its present financial difficulties. The creditors
and lenders may force the business into involuntary bankruptcy, or the business
may make a preemptive move and take itself into voluntary bankruptcy. The
equity owners (stockholders of a corporation) may end up holding an empty bag
after the bankruptcy proceedings have concluded. (This is one of the risks that
stockholders take.) If an auditor has serious concerns about whether the busi-
ness is a going concern, these doubts are spelled out in the auditor’s report.
Who’s Who in the World of Audits
Some CPAs operate as sole practitioners, but many CPAs form partnerships
(also called firms). A CPA firm has to be large enough to assign enough staff
auditors to a client so that all audit work can be completed in a relatively short
period — financial reports are generally released about four to six weeks after
the close of the fiscal year. Large businesses need large CPA firms, and very
large global business organizations need very large international CPA firms.
The public accounting profession consists of four very large international
firms; several good-sized second-tier national firms; and many regional firms,
small local firms, and sole practitioners.
The Big Four international CPA firms are household names in the business world:
 Ernst & Young
 PricewaterhouseCoopers (all one word with the C capitalized — the
result of the merger of two firms)
 Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu
 KPMG (the PM in the name derives from an earlier time when Peat
Marwick was part of the firm’s name)
315
Chapter 15: Audits and Accounting Fraud   

These four firms and other large CPA partnerships are legally organized as
limited liability partnerships, and you see LLP after their names. The Big Four
audit the large majority of the public corporations in the United States. The
Big Four are international in scope and employ a large number of people. For
example, Ernst & Young has about 130,000 employees worldwide. In contrast,
browse through the CPA section in the business listings of your local phone
book; you’ll find many sole practitioners and small CPA firms.
Many CPAs do not do auditing. In fact, they wouldn’t touch auditing with a
ten-foot pole. They provide income tax, financial advising, and business con-
sulting services — and they make a handsome income doing so. They avoid
auditing for several reasons. Perhaps the most important reason is the risk of
being sued for failing to discover fraud in financial statements on which the
CPA expressed a clean opinion. Auditors have a lot of trouble discovering
fraud, which I discuss in the later section “Discovering Fraud, or Not.”
Another reason many CPAs shy away from auditing is that businesses don’t
want to pay for the cost of a good audit; they want to buy an audit opinion on
the cheap. Generally, auditing is not as lucrative as income tax, advising, and
consulting services. Also, auditing is much more regulated as compared with
income tax and consulting. All in all, it’s a quieter life for CPAs without audit-
ing. Auditing is a high risk and high stress activity, but not a particularly high
income activity. Nevertheless, some small CPA firms do audits. Most mid-size
and larger regional CPA firms do audits; auditing is a sizeable part of their rev-
enue. Auditing is the mainstay of the Big Four and other national CPA firms.
Standing Firm When Companies 
Massage the Numbers, or Not
I majored in accounting in college and, upon graduation, went to work for one
of the national CPA firms. I took great pride in my profession. I went on to get
my Ph.D. in accounting, and I taught at the University of California in Berkeley
and at the University of Colorado in Boulder for 40 years before retiring. I regu-
larly taught the auditing course, which introduces students to the audits of
financial statements by independent CPAs.
I always stressed that an auditor is duty-bound to exercise professional
skepticism. The auditor should have a mindset that challenges the accounting
methods and reporting practices of the client in order to make sure that its
financial statements conform with accounting standards and are not mislead-
ing. A good auditor should be tough on the accounting methods of the client.
An auditor should never be a weak, look-the-other-way, let’s-go-along-with-
management reviewer of a business’s accounting methods and financial
reporting practices. An auditor should be as mean as a junkyard guard dog —
a true enforcer of accounting and financial reporting standards.
316
Part IV: Preparing and Using Financial Reports  

Ideally, a business should select the accounting methods that are best suited
to how it operates and stick with those methods over time; its managers should
never intervene in the accounting process. Well, it doesn’t always work this way.
I explain in Chapter 12 that business managers don’t always remain on the side-
lines regarding the accounting in their business. Sometimes managers, working
in cahoots with the controller, intervene and manipulate the timing for recording
sales revenue and expenses (and gains and losses in some situations). In these
situations, management overrides normal accounting procedures.
In many audits the CPA becomes aware of heavy-handed accounting manipu-
lation (also called massaging the numbers) for purposes such as smoothing
year-to-year profit, boosting profit for the year, or making the business appear
more solvent than it really is. Generally, managers have some ground to stand
on; there is some rationale for their accounting machinations. But both the
managers and the CPA auditor know what’s going on: The financial statements
are being tweaked.
What’s an auditor to do? The auditor is under pressure to go along with man-
agement, even though he may strongly disagree with the accounting manipu-
lations. He knows that better accounting should be used or that disclosure
should be more adequate. Too often, instead of holding his ground, the CPA
capitulates and does not force management to change. He allows the financial
statements to be manipulated. This is a harsh comment, and I don’t make it
lightly. If you could get frank answers from practicing CPA auditors on this
issue, you’d find that most agree with me.
Here’s my take on the situation: CPA auditors go along with management mas-
saging of the numbers (and “massaging” disclosure) if they think that the
financial statements are not seriously misleading. The CPA’s rationale is this:
Yes, the financial statements could be more correct and could provide better
disclosure, but all in all the financial statements are not seriously misleading.
I must acknowledge that in many situations CPA auditors do stand their
ground: They persuade the business not to manipulate its accounting num-
bers and to provide better disclosure. However, the CPA cannot brag about
this in the audit report, saying “We talked management out of manipulating
the accounting numbers.” CPA auditors deserve a lot of credit for working
behind the scenes to enforce accounting and financial reporting standards.
At the same time, many auditors could — and should — be tougher.
317
Chapter 15: Audits and Accounting Fraud   

Discovering Fraud, or Not
Massaging the numbers is one thing. Accounting and financial reporting fraud,
also called cooking the books, is another thing altogether. Accounting fraud
refers to such schemes as recording sales revenue for products and services
that have not been sold, not recording expenses that have been incurred,
recording gains that have not and probably will not be realized, and not recording
losses that have been sustained. Financial reporting fraud encompasses
accounting fraud; it also includes failing to disclose negative matters that
should be disclosed in a financial report or making deliberately misleading
disclosures in a financial report.
The track record of CPA auditors in discovering accounting and financial
reporting fraud is not very good. The number of well-known companies that
engaged in accounting and financial reporting fraud in recent years that was
not discovered by their CPA auditors is truly staggering. The best known of
these companies was Enron, but hundreds of companies committed account-
ing fraud. Enron is also infamous for the reason that its auditor, Arthur Andersen
& Company, was found guilty of obstruction of justice because its senior staff
persons on the audit destroyed audit evidence. Almost overnight this venerable
CPA firm ceased to exist. Over the years, I had attended several faculty work-
shops held by Arthur Andersen, and I had the highest regard for the firm. Quite
clearly, in the case of the Enron audit, something went seriously wrong.
Auditors have trouble discovering fraud for several reasons. The most impor-
tant reason, in my view, is that those managers who are willing to commit fraud
understand that they must do a good job of concealing it. Managers bent on
fraud are very clever in devising schemes that look legitimate, and they are
very good at generating false evidence to hide the fraud. These managers think
nothing of lying to their auditors. Also, they are aware of the standard audit
procedures used by CPAs and design their fraud schemes to avoid audit
scrutiny as much as possible.
Over the years, the auditing profession has taken somewhat of a wishy-washy
position on the issue of whether auditors are responsible for discovering
accounting and financial reporting fraud. The general public is confused
because CPAs seem to want to have it both ways. CPAs don’t mind giving the
impression to the general public that they catch fraud, or at least catch fraud
in most situations. However, when a CPA firm is sued because it didn’t catch
fraud, the CPA pleads that an audit conducted according to generally
accepted auditing standards does not necessarily discover fraud in all cases.
In the court of public opinion, it is clear that people think that auditors should
discover any material accounting fraud — and, for that matter, auditors should
discover any other material fraud against the business by its managers,
employees, vendors, or customers. CPAs refer to the difference between their
responsibility for fraud detection (as they define it) and the responsibility of
318
Part IV: Preparing and Using Financial Reports  

auditors perceived by the general public as the “expectations gap.” CPAs want
to close the gap — not by taking on more responsibility for fraud detection,
but by lowering the expectations of the public regarding their responsibility.
You’d have to be a lawyer to understand in detail the case law on auditors’
legal liability for fraud detection, and I’m not a lawyer. But, quite clearly, CPAs
are liable for gross negligence in the conduct of an audit. If the judge or jury
concludes that gross negligence was the reason the CPA failed to discover
fraud, the CPA is held liable. (CPA firms have paid millions and millions of dol-
lars in malpractice lawsuit damages.)
In a nutshell, standard audit procedures do not always uncover fraud, except
when the perpetrators of the fraud are particularly inept at covering their
tracks. Using tough-minded forensic audit procedures would put auditors in
adversarial relationships with their clients, and CPA auditors want to main-
tain working relationships with clients that are cooperative and friendly. A
friendly auditor, some would argue, is an oxymoron.
One last point: In many accounting fraud cases that have been reported in
the financial press, the auditor knew about the accounting methods of the
client but did not object to the misleading accounting — you may call this an
audit judgment failure. In these cases, the auditor was overly tolerant of ques-
tionable accounting methods used by the client. Perhaps the auditor may
have had serious objections to the accounting methods, but the client per-
suaded the CPA to go along with the methods. In many respects, the failure to
object to bad accounting is more serious than the failure to discover account-
ing fraud, because it strikes at the integrity and backbone of the auditor.
Who Audits the Auditors?
One result from the plethora of Enron-type accounting fraud scandals was pas-
sage of the 2002 Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which was quickly signed into law by
President George W. Bush. The Act imposed new duties on corporate manage-
ment regarding their responsibilities over internal controls that are designed
to prevent financial reporting fraud. The act also established a new regulatory
board that has broad powers over CPA firms that audit public businesses: the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB), which is within the
administrative structure of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
Prior to the passage of this act, the accounting profession policed itself
through entities of the national association of CPAs, the American Institute of
CPAs (AICPA): the Auditing Standards Board, the Ethics Committee, and the
peer review process. These entities are still in place, but now the AICPA has
jurisdiction only over private businesses that are not under the jurisdiction
of the federal securities laws and the SEC. CPA firms that audit both private
319
Chapter 15: Audits and Accounting Fraud   

and public companies now have two bosses, one for their private business
clients and one for their public business clients.
The PCAOB has ruled that many consulting and other services that CPA firms
used to provide to their audit clients are now out of bounds. The firms can
offer these services to public businesses that they don’t audit, but not to
their audit clients. The thinking is that the auditor cannot be truly indepen-
dent if the firm also derives substantial revenue from selling non-audit ser-
vices to the same client that it audits. (In the past, many people criticized
these conflicts of interest.)
The role, authority, and responsibilities of audit committees of public busi-
nesses have also become more prominent in recent years. An audit commit-
tee is a subcommittee of the board of directors of a business corporation.
Audit committee members now must be outside directors, meaning they have
no management position in the business. Outside directors are often consid-
ered more independent, more objective, and more willing to challenge the
executives of the business on serious issues facing the business. The audit
committee works closely with the independent CPA auditor on any issues and
problems that come up during the audit.

F
inancially speaking, business managers have three jobs:
 Earn adequate profit consistently
 Generate cash flow from profit
 Control the financial condition of the business
How can accounting help make you a better business manager? That’s 
the bottom-line question, and the bottom line is the best place to start.
Accounting provides the financial information you need for making good
profit decisions — and it stops you from plunging ahead with gut-level 
decisions that feel right but don’t hold water after due-diligent analysis.
Accounting also provides cash flow and financial condition information 
you need. But in order for accounting information to do all these wonderful
things, you have to understand and know how to interpret it.
Reach Break-Even, and 
Then Rake in Profit
Almost every business has fixed costs: costs that are locked in for the year
and remain the same whether annual sales are at 100 percent or below half
your capacity. Fixed costs are a dead weight on a business. To make profit,

you have to get over your fixed costs hurdle. How do you do this? Obviously,
you have to make sales. Each sale brings in a certain amount of margin,
which equals the revenue minus the variable expenses of the sale.
Say you sell a product for $100. Your purchase (or manufacturing) cost is $60,
which accountants call the cost of goods sold expense. Your variable costs of
selling the item add up to $15, including sales commission and delivery cost.
Thus, your margin on the sale is $25: $100 sales price – $60 product cost –
$15 variable costs = $25 margin. (Margin is before interest and income tax
expenses.)
Your annual fixed operating costs total $2.5 million. These costs provide the
space, facilities, and people that are necessary to make sales and earn profit.
Of course, the risk is that your sales will not be enough to overcome your
fixed costs. This leads to the next step, which is to determine your break-
even point. Break-even refers to the sales revenue you need just to recoup
your fixed operating costs. If you earn 25 percent average margin on sales, 
in order to break even you need $10 million in annual sales: $10 million × 25
percent margin = $2.5 million margin. At this sales level, margin equals fixed
costs and your profit is zero (you break even). Not very exciting so far, is it?
But from here on it gets much more interesting.
Until sales reach $10 million, you’re in the loss zone. After you cross over 
the break-even point, you enter the profit zone. Suppose your annual sales
revenue is $16 million, or $6 million over your break-even point. Your profit
(earnings before interest and income tax) is $1.5 million ($6 million sales over
break-even × 25 percent margin ratio = $1.5 million profit). After you cross
over the break-even threshold, your entire margin goes toward profit; each
additional $100 sale generates $25 profit. Suppose, for example, that you had
made $1 million in additional sales. You would earn $250,000 more profit — an
increase of 16.7 percent over the profit earned on $16 million sales revenue.
Set Sales Prices Right
In real estate, the three most important profit factors are location, location,
and location. In the business of selling products and services, the three most
important factors are margin, margin, and margin. Of course a business man-
ager should control expenses — that goes without saying. But the secret to
making profit is making sales and earning an adequate margin on them.
(Remember, margin equals sales price less all variable costs of the sale.)
Chapter 9 explains that internal P&L reports to managers should clearly 
separate variable and fixed costs so the manager can focus on margin.
324
Part V: The Part of Tens 

In the example in the previous section, your sales prices earn 25 percent
margin on sales. In other words, $100 of sales revenue generates $25 margin
(after deducting the cost of product sold and variable costs of making the
sale). Therefore, $16 million in sales revenue generates $4 million margin. 
The $4 million margin covers your $2.5 million in fixed costs and provides
$1.5 million of profit (before interest and income tax).
An alternative scenario illustrates the importance of setting sales prices high
enough to earn an adequate margin. Instead of the sales prices in the previ-
ous example, suppose you had set sales prices 5 percent lower. Therefore,
your margin would be $5 lower per $100 of sales. Instead of 25 percent margin
on sales, you would earn only 20 percent margin on sales. How badly would
the lower margin ratio hurt profit?
On $16 million annual sales, your margin would be $3.2 million ($16 million
sales × 20 percent margin ratio = $3.2 million margin). Deducting $2.5 million
fixed costs for the year leaves only $700,000 profit. Compared with your $1.5
million profit at the 25 percent margin ratio, the $700,000 profit at the lower
sales prices is less than half. The moral of this story is that a 5 percent lower
sales price causes 53 percent lower profit!
Distinguish Profit from Cash Flow
To find out whether you made a profit or had a loss for the year, you look at
the bottom line in your P&L report. But you must understand that the bottom
line does not tell you cash flow from your profit-making activities. Profit does
not equal cash flow. Don’t ever assume that making profit increases cash the
same amount. Making such an assumption reveals that you’re a rank amateur.
Cash flow can be considerably higher than bottom-line profit, or considerably
lower. Cash flow can be negative even when you earn a profit, and cash flow
can be positive even when you have a loss. There’s no natural correlation
between profit and cash flow. If I know one of the numbers, I don’t have a clue
about the other.
Figure 16-1 shows an example I designed to illustrate the differences between
sales revenue and expenses (the accounting numbers used to measure profit)
and the cash flows of the sales and expenses. Only three expenses are shown:
cost of goods sold, depreciation, and one total amount for all other expenses.
(Note: Reporting expenses this way is not adequate for managers in a P&L
report and is not acceptable for income statements in an external financial
report.)
325
Chapter 16: Ten Accounting Tips for Managers

Here are the reasons for the cash flow differences in Figure 16-1:
 Your accounts receivable (from credit sales) increased $100,000 during
the year, so actual cash collections from customers were only $4.9 mil-
lion during the year — a cash flow shortfall of $100,000.
 You built up your inventory $225,000 during the year, so your cash 
outlays for products were $225,000 higher than the cost of goods 
sold expense for the year.
 Depreciation expense is not a cash outlay in the period recorded; the
cash outlay took place when the fixed assets being depreciated were
acquired some years ago.
 Total cash outlays for other expenses were $165,000 lower than the
amount of expenses recorded in the year, mainly because your accounts
payable and accrued expenses payable liabilities increased during the
year — you had not paid this amount of expenses by year-end.
Every situation is different, of course. I don’t mean to suggest that cash flow
is always lower than profit for the year. Suppose accounts receivable had
remained flat during the year; your cash flow would have been $100,000
higher. If you had not built up your inventory, then . . . you get the picture.
You must keep close tabs on the changes in the assets and liabilities that
impact cash flow from profit. See Chapter 6 for more details.
Call the Shots on Accounting Policies
You may have heard the adage that war is too important to be left to the gen-
erals. Well, accounting is too important to be left to the accountants — espe-
cially when choosing which accounting methods to use. I’m oversimplifying,
but measuring profit and putting values on assets and liabilities boils down 
to choosing between conservative accounting methods and more liberal (or
aggressive) methods. Conservative methods record profit later rather than
sooner; liberal methods record profit sooner rather than later. It’s a “pay me
now or pay me later” choice. (Chapter 7 gives you the details on accounting
methods.)

Part V: The Part of Tens 

I encourage you to get involved in setting your company’s accounting poli-
cies. Business managers should take charge of accounting decisions just 
like they take charge of marketing and other key activities of the business.
Some business managers defer to their accountants in choosing accounting
methods for measuring sales revenue and expenses. Don’t! You should get
involved in making these decisions. The best accounting method is the one
that best fits the operating methods and strategic plan of your business. As
the manager, you know the business’s operations and strategy better than
your accountant.
Many businesses choose conservative accounting methods to defer paying
their income tax. Keep in mind that higher expense deductions in early years
cause lower deductions in later years. Also, conservative, income tax–driven
accounting methods make the inventory and fixed assets in your balance
sheet look anemic. Recording higher cost of goods sold expense takes more
out of inventory, and recording higher depreciation expense causes the book
value of your fixed assets to be lower. Nevertheless, you may decide that
deferring the payment of income taxes is worth it, in order to keep your
hands on the cash as long as possible.
Budget Wisely
Many people hear the word “budgeting” and think of a budgeting system —
involving many persons, detailed forecasting, negotiating over goals and
objectives, and page after page of detailed accounting statements that
commit everyone to certain performance benchmarks for the coming period.
In reality, all kinds of budgeting methods and approaches exist. You don’t
have to budget like IBM or a large business organization. You can do one-
person limited-purpose budgeting. Even small-scale budgeting can pay hand-
some dividends.
I explain in Chapter 10 the reasons for budgeting — first, for understanding
the profit dynamics and financial structure of your business and, second, 
for planning for changes in the coming period. Budgeting forces you to focus
on the factors for improving profit and cash flow. It’s always a good idea to
look ahead to the coming year; if nothing else, at least plug the numbers in
your profit report for sales volume, sales prices, product costs, and other
expenses, and see how your projected profit looks for the coming year. It may
not look too good, in which case you need to plan how you will do better.
The profit budget, in turn, lays the foundation for changes in your assets and
liabilities that are driven by sales revenue and expenses. Your profit budget
should dovetail with your assets and liabilities budget and with your cash flow
327
Chapter 16: Ten Accounting Tips for Managers

budget. This information is very helpful in planning for the coming year —
focusing in particular on how much cash flow from profit will be realized and
how much capital expenditures will be required, which in turn lead to how
much additional capital you have to raise and how much cash distribution
from profit you will be able to make.
Get the Accounting Information 
You Need
Experienced business managers can tell you that they spend a good deal of
time dealing with problems because things don’t always go according to plan.
Murphy’s Law (if something can go wrong, it will, and usually at the worst
possible time) is all too true. To solve a problem, you first have to know that
you have one. Managers need to get on top of problems as soon as possible.
A well-designed accounting system should set off alarms about any problems
that are developing, so you can nip them in the bud.
You should identify the handful of critical factors that you need to keep a
close eye on. Insist that your internal accounting reports highlight these 
factors. Only you, the business manager, can identify the most important
numbers that you must closely watch to know how things are going. Your
accountant can’t read your mind. If your regular accounting reports do 
not include the exact types of information you need, sit down with your
accountant and spell out in detail what you want to know. Don’t take no for
an answer. Don’t let your accountant argue that the computer doesn’t keep
track of this information. Computers can be programmed to spit out any type
of information you want.
Here are accounting information variables that should always be on your radar:
 Sales volumes
 Margins
 Fixed expenses
 Overdue accounts receivable
 Slow-moving inventory items
Experience is the best teacher. Over time, you discover which financial fac-
tors are the most important to highlight in your internal accounting reports.
The trick is to make sure that your accountant provides this information.

Tap into Your CPA’s Expertise
As you know, a CPA will perform an audit of your financial report (see
Chapter 15). And the CPA will assist in preparing your income tax returns. In
doing the audit, your CPA may find serious problems with your accounting
methods and call these to your attention. Also, the CPA auditor will point out
any serious deficiencies in your internal controls (see the next section). And,
it goes without saying that your CPA can give you valuable income tax advice
and guide you through the labyrinth of federal and state income tax laws and
regulations.
You should also consider taking advantage of other services a CPA has to
offer. A CPA can help you select, implement, and update a computer-based
accounting system and can give expert advice on many accounting issues
such as cost allocation methods. A CPA can do a critical analysis of the inter-
nal accounting reports to managers in your business and suggest improve-
ments in these reports. A CPA has experience with a wide range of businesses
and can recommend best practices for your business. If necessary, the CPA
can serve as an expert witness on your behalf in lawsuits. A CPA may be
accredited in the areas of business valuation and financial advising.
You have to be careful that the consulting services provided by your CPA do
not conflict with the CPA’s independence required for auditing your financial
report. If there is a conflict, you should use one CPA for auditing your finan-
cial report and another CPA for consulting services.
Critically Review Your Fraud Controls
Every business faces threats from fraud — from within and from without.
Your knee-jerk reaction may be that fraud couldn’t possibly be going on
under your nose in your own business. I once discussed fraud with a man
who served hard time in the Nebraska State Penitentiary for embezzling over
$300,000 from his employer. He said that such a cocky attitude by a business
manager presents the perfect opportunity for getting away with fraud
(although he tripped up, obviously).
Without you knowing about it, your purchasing manager may be accepting
kickbacks or other “gratuities.” Your long-time bookkeeper may be embez-
zling. One of your suppliers may be short-counting you on deliveries. I’m not
suggesting that you should invest as much time and money in preventing
fraud and cheating against your business as do Las Vegas casinos. But every
now and then you should take a hard look at whether your fraud controls are
adequate.
329
Chapter 16: Ten Accounting Tips for Managers

Preventing fraud starts with establishing and enforcing good internal con-
trols, which I discuss in Chapter 3. In the course of auditing your financial
report, the CPA evaluates your internal controls. The CPA will report to you
any serious deficiencies. Even with good internal controls and having regular
audits, you should consider calling in an expert to assess your vulnerability
to fraud and to determine whether there is evidence of any fraud going on.
A CPA may not be the best person to test for fraud — even if the CPA has
fraud training and forensic credentials. A private detective may be better 
for this sort of investigation because he has more experience dealing with
crooks and digging out sources of information that are beyond what a CPA
customarily uses. For example, a private detective may install secret monitor-
ing equipment or even spy on your employees’ private lives. I understand if
you think that you’d never be willing to go so far to defend yourself against
fraud, but consider this: Someone committing fraud against your business
has no such compunctions.
Lend a Hand in Preparing 
Your Financial Reports
Many business managers look at preparing the annual financial report of the
business like they look at its annual income tax return — it’s a task best left
to the accountant. This is a mistake. You should take an active part in prepar-
ing the annual financial report. (I discuss getting the financial report ready
for release in Chapter 12.) You should carefully think of what to say in the
letter to stockholders that accompanies the financial statements. You should
help craft the footnotes to the financial statements. The annual report is a
good opportunity to tell a compelling story about the business.
The president or chief executive of the business has the ultimate responsibility
for the financial report. Of course your financial report should not be fraudu-
lent and deliberately misleading; if it is you can, and probably will, be sued. 
But beyond that, lenders and investors appreciate a frank and honest discus-
sion of how the business did, including its problems as well as its successes.
In my view, the gold standard for financial reports is set by Warren Buffett,
the CEO of Berkshire Hathaway. He lays it on the line; if he has a bad year, 
he makes no excuses. Buffett is appropriately modest if he has a good year.
Every annual report of Berkshire Hathaway summarizes the nature of the
business and how it makes profit. If you knew nothing about this business,
you could learn what you need to know from its annual report. (Go to www.
berkshirehathaway.com to get its latest annual report.)

Sound Like a Pro in Talking about 
Your Financial Statements
On many occasions, a business manager has to discuss her financial state-
ments with others. You should come across as very knowledgeable and be
very persuasive in what you say. These occasions include
 Applying for a loan: The loan officer may ask specific questions about
your accounting methods and items in your financial statements.
 Talking with individuals or other businesses that may be interested in
buying your business: They may have questions about the recorded
values of your assets and liabilities.
 Dealing with the press: Large corporations are used to talking with the
media, but even smaller businesses are profiled in local news stories.
 Dealing with unions or other employee groups in setting wages and
benefit packages: They may think that your profits are very high so you
can afford to increase wages and benefits.
 Explaining the profit-sharing plan to your employees: They may take 
a close interest in how profit is determined.
 Putting a value on an ownership interest for divorce or estate tax 
purposes: These values are based on the financial statements of the
business (and other factors).
 Reporting financial statement data to national trade associations:
Trade associations collect financial information from their members.
You should make sure that you’re reporting the financial information
consistently with the definitions used in the industry.
 Presenting the annual financial report before the annual meeting of
owners: The shareowners may ask penetrating questions and expect
you to be very familiar with the financial statements.

Ten Tips for Reading 
a Financial Report

 Bumping into extraordinary gains and losses
 Comparing cash flow with profit
 Looking for signs of financial distress
 Recognizing the limits of financial reports
R
eading a business’s financial report is like shucking an oyster: You have
to know what you’re doing and work to get at the meat. You need a good
reason to pry into a financial report. The main reason to become informed
about the financial performance and condition of a business is because you
have a stake in the business. The financial success or failure of the business
makes a difference to you.
Shareowners have a major stake in a business, of course. The lenders of a
business also have a stake, which can be major. Shareowners and lenders are
the two main audiences of a financial report. But others also have a financial
stake in a business. For example, my books are published by John Wiley &
Sons (a public company), so I look at its financial report to gain comfort that
my royalties will be paid.
In this chapter, I offer practical tips to help investors, lenders, or anyone who
has a financial stake in a business glean important insights from its financial
reports.
Get in the Right Frame of Mind
So often I hear non-accountants say that they don’t read financial reports
because they are not “numbers” people. You don’t have to be a math wizard

or rocket scientist to extract the essential points from a financial report. I
know that you can find the bottom line in the income statement and compare
this profit number with other relevant numbers in the financial statements.
You can read the balance of cash in the balance sheet. If the business has a
zero or near-zero cash balance, you know that this is a serious — perhaps
fatal — problem.
Therefore, my first bit of advice is to get in the right frame of mind. Don’t let a
financial report bamboozle you. Locate the income statement, find bottom-
line profit (or loss!), and get going. You can do it — especially having a book
like this one to help you along.

Sorting out financial report readers
Shareowners and lenders have a direct stake in
a business, of course. Quite clearly, they have
important reasons to keep up with the informa-
tion in its financial reports. In fact, they may
have a duty to read its financial reports (such as
the bank officer in charge of loans to the busi-
ness, and investment managers of a mutual
fund owning stock shares in the business). But
many other people have a stake in a business
and should consider looking in its financial
reports. Consider the following examples:
 Employee retirement benefits depend on
whether the business is fully funding its
plans; employees should read the footnote
discussing this issue (assuming the finan-
cial report is available to them).
 If you plan to make a large deposit on a new
condo with a real estate developer, you
should ask to look at its balance sheet to
see whether the business is in financial
trouble before you sign on the dotted line.
 People suing a business should focus on
the items in the financial report that support
their lawsuit against the business (such as
misleading footnotes, for example).
 My wife and I are considering moving into
a retirement community that requires a very
large non-refundable entrance fee; believe
me, I want to see its financial report first.
 If you belong to a homeowners’ association,
you should review its financial statements
to spot any serious problems.
 I read the annual financial report of my
retirement fund manager closely because
most of my retirement savings are in the
hands of this organization (TIAA-CREF, in
case you’re interested).
 I shop regularly at Costco (a public com-
pany), so I glance at its financial report to
check whether my annual membership fee
is a good move.

Decide What to Read
Suppose you own stock shares in a public corporation and want to keep
informed about its performance. You could depend on articles and news
items in The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times, Barron’s, and so on that
summarize the latest financial reports of the company. This saves you the
time and trouble of reading the reports yourself. Generally, these brief arti-
cles capture the most important points. If you own an investment portfolio 
of many different stocks, reading news articles that summarize the financial
reports of the companies is not a bad approach. But suppose you want more
financial information than you can get in news articles?
The annual financial reports of public companies contain lots of information:
a letter from the chief executive, a highlights section, trend charts, financial
statements, extensive footnotes to the financial statements, historical sum-
maries, and a lot of propaganda. And you get photos of the top brass and
directors, of course. (The financial reports of most private companies are 
significantly smaller; they contain financial statements with footnotes, and
not much more.)
So, how much of the report do you actually read?
You could read just the highlights section and let it go at that. This might do
in a pinch. I think you should read the chief executive’s letter to shareowners
as well. Ideally, the letter summarizes in an evenhanded and appropriately
modest manner the main developments during the year. However, these 
letters from the top dog often are self-congratulatory and typically transfer
blame for poor performance on factors beyond the control of the managers.
Read them, but take these letters with a grain of salt.
Many public businesses send shareowners a condensed summary version in
place of their much longer and more detailed annual financial reports. This is
legal, as long as the business mentions that you can get its “real” financial
report by asking for a hard copy or by going to its Web site. The idea, of
course, is to give shareowners an annual financial report that they can read
and digest more quickly and easily.
The scaled-down, simplified, and shortened versions of annual financial
reports are adequate for average stock investors. They are not adequate for
serious investors and professional investment managers. These investors and
money managers should read the full-fledged financial report of the business,
and they may study the company’s annual 10-K report that is filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). You can go to www.sec.gov and
click on Filings & Forms (EDGAR) to retrieve the 10-K of a public company.

Chapter 17: Ten Tips for Reading a Financial Report

Improve Your Accounting Savvy
Financial statements — the income statement, balance sheet, and statement
of cash flows — are the hard core of a financial report. To make sense of
financial statements, you need at least a rudimentary understanding of finan-
cial statement accounting. You don’t have to be a CPA, but the accountants
who prepare financial statements presume that you are familiar with account-
ing terminology and financial reporting practices. If you’re an accounting illit-
erate, the financial statements probably look like a Sudoku puzzle. There’s no
way around this demand on financial report readers. After all, accounting is
the language of business. (Now where have I heard that before?)
The solution? Read this book. And when you’re done, consider reading
another book or two about reading financial reports and analyzing financial
statements. If you need a suggestion, check out another of my books, How To
Read A Financial Report, 6th edition (Wiley).
Judge Profit Performance
A business makes profit by making sales and by keeping expenses less than
sales revenue, so the best place to start in analyzing profit performance is
not the bottom line but the top line: sales revenue. Here are some items to
focus on:
 How does sales revenue in the most recent year compare with the previ-
ous year? Higher sales should lead to higher profit, unless a company’s
expenses increase at a higher rate than its sales revenue. If sales rev-
enue is relatively flat from year to year, the business must focus on
expense control to help profit, but a business can cut expenses only so
far. The real key for improving profit is improving sales. Therefore, stock
analysts put first importance on tracking sales revenue year to year.
 What is the gross margin ratio of the business (which equals gross profit
divided by sales revenue)? Even a small slippage in its gross margin ratio
can have disastrous consequences on the company’s bottom line. Stock
analysts would like to know the margin of a business, which equals sales
revenue minus all variable costs of sales (product cost and other vari-
able costs of making sales). But external income statements do not
reveal margin; businesses hold back this information from the outside
world.
336
Part V: The Part of Tens 

 Based on information from a company’s most recent income statement
(which you can find in the financials section of its Web site), how do
gross margin and the company’s bottom line (net income, or net earn-
ings) compare with its top line (sales revenue)? Calculate these two
ratios for a variety of businesses; you may be surprised at the variation
from industry to industry. By the way, very few businesses provide
profit ratios on the face of their income statements — which is curious
because they know that readers of their income statements are inter-
ested in their profit ratios.
Track Profit into Earnings per Share
The bottom line for stock investors is not the bottom line. Shareowners’
attention is riveted on the bottom-line profit figure, of course. But they can’t
stop their analysis at the bottom line. The value of a stock depends heavily
on its earnings per share (EPS). So stockholders should track profit into EPS
to check whether changes in EPS and profit are divergent. The risk is that 
the profit pie may be cut up into smaller pieces. Bottom-line profit may have
increased 10 percent over last year, for example, but EPS may have increased
less than 10 percent. How do you like that?
Here’s an example with three different scenarios. A business earned $1.2 mil-
lion net income for the year. At the start of the year it had 1 million stock
shares outstanding (in the hands of its stockholders). Suppose the number of
shares had remained the same during the year. In this scenario, EPS would be
$1.20. A full amount of profit goes to each stock share that was outstanding at
the start of the year. Fair enough.
Alternatively, suppose the business had granted several key executives stock
options during the year for 200,000 shares, and these stock options are in the
money at the end of the year (meaning the current market value of the stock
is higher than the exercise prices of the stock options). Therefore, profit is
spread over 1.2 million shares, and the diluted EPS is only $1.00. Market value
depends on diluted EPS (see Chapter 13 for more details). In this scenario,
EPS and the stock’s market value are penalized. Part of the profit benefit 
was diverted from the original stockholders to the executives via the stock
options.
In contrast, suppose that during the year the business purchased and retired
200,000 shares of its capital stock. In this situation, EPS would be $1.50 ($1.2
million net income ÷ 800,000 shares). Businesses with surplus cash argue that
the best thing to do is to buy some of their own stock shares, which reduces
the number of shares outstanding and increases EPS.
337
Chapter 17: Ten Tips for Reading a Financial Report

The main lesson here is that EPS, on which market value pivots, does not
necessarily move in sync with the profit performance of a business. It’s
always a good idea to check the percent change in profit against the percent
change in EPS. Public companies have to report EPS on the face of their
income statements (not a bad idea for private companies as well). However, a
business does not explain any divergence between its profit and EPS behav-
ior. You have to figure this out on your own.
Confront Extraordinary Gains and Losses
Many income statements start out normally: sales revenue less the expenses
of making sales and operating the business. But then there’s a jarring layer 
of extraordinary gains and losses on the way down to the final profit line. (I
discuss extraordinary gains and losses in Chapter 4.) In these situations,
there are two bottom lines: one for profit from normal, ordinary, ongoing
operations; and a second for the effect from the abnormal, extraordinary,
nonrecurring gains and losses. The final profit line is the net result of the two
components in the income statement. (EPS is reported before and after the
unusual items.) What’s a financial statement reader to do when a business
reports such gains and losses?
There’s no easy answer to this question. You could blithely assume that
these things happen to a business only once in a blue moon and should not
disrupt the business’s ability to make profit on a sustainable basis. I call this
the earthquake mentality approach: When there’s an earthquake, there’s 
a lot of damage, but most years have no tremors and go along as normal.
Extraordinary gains and losses are supposed to be nonrecurring in nature
and recorded infrequently, or one-time gains and losses. In actual practice,
however, many businesses report these gains and losses on a regular and
recurring basis — like having an earthquake every year or so.
Extraordinary losses are a particular problem because large amounts are
moved out of the mainstream expenses of the business and treated as 
nonrecurring losses in its income statement, which means these amounts do
not pass through the regular expense accounts of the business. Profit from
continuing operations is reported at higher amounts than it would be if the
so-called extraordinary losses were treated as regular operating expenses.
Unfortunately, CPA auditors tend to tolerate this abuse. Investment managers
complain in public about this practice. But in private they seem to prefer that
businesses have the latitude to maximize their reported earnings from con-
tinuing operations by passing off some expenses as extraordinary losses.
338
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Compare Cash Flow and Profit
The objective of a business is not simply to make profit, but to generate cash
flow from making profit as quickly as possible. Cash flow from making profit
is the most important stream of cash inflow to a business. A business could
sell off some assets to generate cash, and it can borrow money or get share-
owners to put more money in the business. But cash flow from making profit
is the spigot that should always be turned on. A business needs this cash
flow to make cash distributions from profit to shareowners, to maintain liq-
uidity, and to supplement other sources of capital to grow the business.
The income statement does not — I repeat does not — report the cash
inflows of sales and the cash outflows of expenses. Therefore, the bottom 
line of the income statement is not a cash flow number. The net cash flow
from the profit-making activities of the business (its sales and expenses) 
is reported in the statement of cash flows. When you look there, you will
undoubtedly discover that the cash flow from operating activities (the official
term for cash flow from profit-making activities) is higher or lower than the
bottom-line profit number in the income statement. I explain the reasons for
the difference in Chapter 6.
Businesses seldom offer any explanation of the difference between profit and
cash flow. What you see in the statement of cash flows is all you get — no
more. You’re pretty much on your own to interpret the difference. There are
no general benchmarks or ratios for testing cash flow against profit. I couldn’t
possibly suggest that cash flow should normally be 120 percent of bottom-line
profit, or some other ratio. There is one rough rule: Growth penalizes cash
flow — or, more accurately, growth sucks up cash from sales because the busi-
ness has to expand its assets to support the higher level of sales.
Cash flow from operating activities can be a very low percent of profit (or
even negative). This situation should prompt questions about the company’s
quality of earnings, which refers to the credibility and soundness of its profit
accounting methods. In many cases cash flow is low because accounts receiv-
able from sales haven’t been collected and because the business made large
increases in its inventories. The surges in these assets raise questions about
whether all the receivables will be collected and whether the entire inventory
will be sold at regular prices. Only time will tell. Generally speaking, you
should be more cautious and treat the net income that the business reports
with some skepticism.
339
Chapter 17: Ten Tips for Reading a Financial Report

Look for Signs of Financial Distress
A business can build up a good sales volume and have very good profit mar-
gins, but if the company can’t pay its bills on time, its profit opportunities
could go down the drain. Solvency refers to the prospects of a business 
being able to meet its debt and other liability payment obligations on time.
Solvency analysis asks whether a business will be able to pay its liabilities,
looking for signs of financial distress that could cause serious disruptions in
the business’s profit-making operations. Even if a business has a couple bil-
lion bucks in the bank, you should ask: How does its solvency look?
Frankly, detailed solvency analysis of a business is best left to the pros. The
credit industry has become very sophisticated in analyzing solvency. For
example, bankruptcy prediction models have been developed that have
proven useful. I don’t think the average financial report reader should spend
the time to calculate solvency ratios. For one thing, many businesses mas-
sage their accounting numbers to make their liquidity and solvency appear 
to be better than they are at the balance sheet date.
Although many accountants and investment analysts would view my advice
here as heresy, I suggest that you just take a quick glance at the company’s
balance sheet. How do its total liabilities stack up against its cash, current
assets, and total assets? Obviously, total liabilities should not be more than
total assets. Duh! And obviously, if a company’s cash balance is close to zero,
things are bad. Beyond these basic rules, things are a lot more complex.
Many businesses carry a debt load you wouldn’t believe, and some get into
trouble even though they have hefty cash balances.
The continued solvency of a business depends mainly on the ability of its
managers to convince creditors to continue extending credit to the business
and renewing its loans. The credibility of management is the main factor, not
ratios. Creditors understand that a business can get into a temporary bind
and fall behind on paying its liabilities. As a general rule, creditors are slow 
to pull the plug on a business. Shutting off new credit may be the worst thing
lenders and other creditors could do. Doing so may put the business in a 
tailspin, and its creditors may end up collecting very little. Usually, it’s not in
their interest to force a business into bankruptcy — doing so is a last resort.
Recognize the Risks of Restatement 
and Fraud
In 2007, the CEO of one of the Big Four global CPA firms testified before a
blue-ribbon federal government panel on the state of auditing and financial
reporting. He said that one out of every ten financial reports issued by public
340
Part V: The Part of Tens 

companies is revised and restated at a later time. If that’s true, there’s a 10
percent chance that the financial statements you’re reading are not entirely
correct and could be seriously misleading. An earlier study of financial
restatements arrived at a much lower estimate. You’d think that the inci-
dence of companies having to redo their financial reports would be extremely
rare, but you see financial restatements with alarming regularity.
When a business restates its original financial report and issues a new ver-
sion, it does not make restitution for any losses that investors suffered by
relying on the originally reported financial statements. In fact, few companies
even say they’re sorry when they put out revised financial statements.
Generally, the language explaining financial restatements is legalistic and
exculpatory. “We didn’t do anything wrong” seems to be the underlying
theme. This attitude is hard to swallow.
All too often the reason for the restatement is that someone later discovered
that the original financial statements were based on fraudulent accounting.
As I explain in Chapter 15, CPAs don’t have a very good track record for dis-
covering financial reporting fraud. What it comes down to is this: Investors
take the risk that the information in financial statements they use in making
decisions is subject to revision at a later time. I suppose you could go to the
trouble of searching for a business that has never had to restate its financial
statements, but there’s always a first time, of course.
Remember the Limits 
of Financial Reports
There’s a lot more to investing than reading financial reports. Financial
reports are an important source of information, but investors also should
stay informed about general economic trends and developments, political
events, business takeovers, executive changes, technological changes, and
much more. Undoubtedly, the information demands required for investing
have helped fuel the enormous popularity of mutual funds; investors offload
the need to keep informed to the investment managers of the mutual fund.
Many advertisements of financial institutions stress this point — that you
have better things to do with your time.
When you read financial statements, keep in mind that these accounting
reports are somewhat tentative and conditional. Accountants make many
estimates and predictions in recording sales revenue and income, and
expenses and losses. Some soft numbers are mixed in with hard numbers in
financial statements. In short, financial statements are iffy to some extent.
There’s no getting around this limitation of accounting.
341
Chapter 17: Ten Tips for Reading a Financial Report

Having said that, let me emphasize that financial reports serve an indispens-
able function in any developed economy. We really couldn’t get along without
financial reports, despite their limits and problems. People wouldn’t know
which way to turn in a financial information vacuum. Even though the finan-
cial air is polluted, we need the oxygen of financial reports to breathe.

Glossary: Slashing Through the
Accounting Jargon Jungle
A
BC: The acronym for activity-based costing, which is a cost allocation
scheme that allocates the cost of support functions in an organization
(such as maintenance) based on the units of activity of the support function
that are used by other departments and processes in the business.
accounting: The methods and procedures for identifying, analyzing, record-
ing, accumulating, and storing information and data about the activities of an
entity that have financial results, and preparing summary reports of these
activities internally for managers and externally for those entitled to receive
financial reports about the entity. A business’s managers, investors, and
lenders depend on accounting reports called financial statements to make
informed decisions. Accounting also encompasses preparing tax returns that
must be filed with government tax authorities by the entity, and facilitating
day-to-day operating functions.
accounting equation: Assets = Liabilities + Owners’ Equity. This equation
expresses the fundamental duality, or two-sided nature, of accounting and is
useful for explaining double-entry accounting, which uses debits and credits
for recording transactions. It summarizes the balance or equality of an
entity’s assets and the sources of its assets, which fall into two categories: 
liabilities and owners’ equity.
accounting fraud (also called cooking the books): The deliberate falsification
or manipulation of accounting numbers to make the profit performance and/or
the financial condition of a business appear better than reality. Accounting
fraud is sophisticated and even fools the CPA auditors of a business. Recent
years have seen an embarrassing number of high-profile accounting fraud
cases, which resulted in the establishment of a new federal regulatory agency
with broad powers over public companies and the CPA auditors of public busi-
nesses: the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB).

accounts payable: One main type of the short-term operating liabilities of a
business, in which are recorded the amounts owed to vendors or suppliers
for the purchase of products, supplies, parts, and services that are bought 
on credit. Generally these liabilities are non-interest bearing (although an
interest charge may be added as a penalty for late payment).
accounts receivable: The short-term asset in which are recorded the
amounts owed to the business from sales of products and services on credit
to its customers. Customers are not normally charged interest, unless they
do not pay their bills when due. The balance of this asset in a balance sheet
is net of write-offs for uncollectible amounts (bad debts).
accrual-basis accounting: Recording the financial effects of economic events
when they happen, as opposed to simple cash accounting. Using accrual-
basis accounting, revenue is recorded when sales are made (rather than
when cash is received from customers), and expenses are recorded to match
with sales revenue or in the period benefited (rather than when expenses are
paid). The accrual basis of accounting is seen in the recording of assets such
as receivables from customers, inventory (cost of products not yet sold), and
cost of long-term assets (fixed assets) — and in the recording of liabilities
such as accounts payable to vendors and payables for unpaid expenses.
accrued expenses payable: The generic term for liability accounts used to
record the gradual accumulation of unpaid expenses, such as vacation pay
earned by employees and profit-based bonus plans that aren’t paid until the
following period. Note: The specific title of this liability varies from business
to business; you may see accrued liabilities, accrued expenses, or some other
similar account title.
accumulated depreciation: The total cumulative amount of depreciation
expense that has been recorded since the fixed assets being depreciated
were acquired. In the balance sheet, the amount in this account is deducted
from the original cost of fixed assets. The balance of cost less accumulated
depreciation is included in the book value of the fixed assets.
acid-test ratio: An alternative name for the quick ratio.
adjusting entries: At the end of the period, these important entries are
recorded to complete the bookkeeping cycle. These end-of-period entries
record certain expenses to the period (such as depreciation) and update rev-
enue, income, expenses, and losses for the period. Note: This term also refers
to making correcting entries when accounting errors are discovered.
amortization: The allocation of the cost of an intangible asset over its
expected useful life to the business. Amortization expense is recorded on the
straight-line basis (equal amounts each period).
344
Accounting For Dummies, 4th Edition 

asset turnover ratio: Annual sales revenue divided by total assets (at year-
end, or the average total assets during the year).
audit report: The opinion on the financial report of a business issued by a
CPA firm upon its completion of auditing the company’s financial statements
and footnotes. The audit report states whether the financial statements are in
conformity with applicable U.S. or international financial reporting standards.
A “clean opinion” means the CPA auditor has no serious disagreements with
the financial report of the business.
bad debt: The expense that arises from a customer’s failure to pay the
amount owed to the business from a credit sale. When the credit sale was
recorded, the accounts receivable asset account was increased. When it
becomes clear that this debt owed to the business will not be collected, the
asset is written down and the amount is charged to bad debts expense.
balance sheet: This financial statement summarizes the assets, liabilities,
and owners’ equity of a business at a moment in time. It’s prepared at the 
end of every profit period and whenever else it is needed. The main elements
of a balance sheet are called accounts — such as cash, inventory, notes
payable, and capital stock. Each account has a dollar amount, which is called
its balance. But be careful: The fact that the accounts have balances is not
the reason this financial statement is called a balance sheet. Rather, the
equality (or balance) of assets with the total of liabilities and owners’ equity
is the reason for the name. This financial statement is also called the state-
ment of financial condition and the statement of financial position.
book value (of assets and owners’ equity): Refers to the recorded amounts
on the books (accounting records) of a business, which are reported in its
balance sheet. Often this term is used to emphasize that the amounts
recorded in the accounts of the business are less than the current replace-
ment costs of certain assets, or less than the market value of owners’ equity.
break-even: The annual sales volume or sales revenue at which total margin
equals total annual fixed expenses — that is, the exact sales amount at which
the business covers its fixed expenses and makes a zero profit and avoids a
loss. Break-even is a useful point of reference in analyzing profit performance
and the effects of making sales in excess of break-even.
capital expenditures: Outlays for fixed (long-term) assets in order to over-
haul or replace old fixed assets or to expand and modernize the long-lived
operating resources of a business. Fixed assets is a broad category that
includes buildings, machinery, equipment, vehicles, furniture, fixtures, and
computers. These operating assets have useful lives from 3 to 39 (or more)
years. The term “capital” implies that substantial amounts are invested for
many years.
345
Appendix: Glossary: Slashing Through the Accounting Jargon Jungle

capital stock: The ownership shares issued by a corporation for capital
invested in the business by owners. Total capital is divided into units of own-
ership called capital stock shares. In the old days, you actually got engraved
certificates as legal evidence of your ownership of a certain number of
shares. Today, book entry is the norm: Your ownership is recorded in the
books, or records, of the registrar for the stock shares. A business corpora-
tion must issue at least one class of capital stock, called common stock. It may
also issue other classes of stock, such as preferred stock.
cash flow: An ambiguous term that can refer to several different sources of or
uses of cash. Some friendly advice: Always use this term with which source
or use of cash you have in mind!
cash flow from operating activities: Equals the total cash inflow from sales
and other income during the period minus the total cash outflow for expenses
and losses during the period. This important number is reported in the first
section of the statement of cash flows; it is not found in the income statement.
certified public accountant (CPA): The CPA designation is a widely recog-
nized and respected badge of a professional accountant. A person must meet
educational and experience requirements and pass a national uniform exam
to qualify for a state license to practice as a CPA. Many CPAs are not in public
practice; they work for business organizations, government agencies, and
nonprofit organizations, or they teach accounting (a plug for educators here
if you don’t mind). CPAs in public practice do audits of financial statements,
and they also provide tax, management, and financial consulting services.
common stock: The one class of capital stock that must be issued by a busi-
ness corporation. It has the most junior, or “last in line,” claim on the busi-
ness’s assets in the event of liquidation, after all liabilities and any senior
capital stock (such as preferred stock) are paid. Owners of common stock
receive dividends from profit only after preferred stockholders (if any) are
paid. Owners of common stock generally have voting rights in the election 
of the board of directors, although a business may issue both voting and 
nonvoting classes of common stock.
comprehensive income: Includes net income reported in the income state-
ment plus certain rather technical gains and losses that are recorded but
don’t necessarily have to be included in the income statement. In other
words, the effects of these developments can bypass the income statement.
Most companies report these special types of gains and losses (if they have
any) in their statement of changes in owners’ (stockholders’) equity.
controller: The chief accounting officer of an organization. The controller
may also serve as the chief financial officer (CFO) in a business or other 
organization, although in large organizations the two jobs are usually split.
346
Accounting For Dummies, 4th Edition 

cooking the books: See accounting fraud. Should not be confused with the
lesser offenses of massaging the numbers and income smoothing.
current assets: Includes cash plus accounts receivable, inventory, and pre-
paid expenses (and short-term marketable securities if the business owns
any). These assets will be converted into cash during one operating cycle 
or sooner, which determines the liquidity of a business.
current liabilities: Short-term liabilities, principally accounts payable,
accrued expenses payable, income tax payable, short-term notes payable,
and the portion of long-term debt that falls due within the coming year. This
group includes both non-interest-bearing and interest-bearing liabilities that
must be paid in the short term, usually defined to be one year or less.
current ratio: One test of a business’s short-term solvency (debt-paying
capability). Find the current ratio by dividing a business’s total current assets
by its total current liabilities.
debits and credits: Accounting jargon for decreases and increases recorded
in accounts for assets, liabilities, owners’ equity, revenue, and expenses
according to the centuries’ old method that is based on the accounting equa-
tion. In recording a transaction, the total of debits must equal the total of
credits. “The books are in balance” means that the sum of debit balance
accounts equals the sum of credit balance accounts. Even though the
accounts are in balance, there may be errors due to other reasons. 
depreciation: Allocating a fixed asset’s cost over three or more years, based
on its estimated useful life to the business. Each year of the asset’s life is
charged with part of its total cost as the asset gradually wears out and 
loses its economic value to the business. Either an accelerated depreciation
method or straight-line depreciation is used. An accelerated method allocates
more of the cost to the early years than the later years. The straight-line
method allocates an equal amount to every year.
dividend yield: Measures the cash income component of return on invest-
ment in stock shares of a corporation. The dividend yield equals the most
recent 12 months of cash dividends paid on a stock divided by the stock’s
current market price. If a stock is selling for $100 and over the last 12 months
paid $3 cash dividends, its dividend yield equals 3 percent.
double-entry accounting: Simply put, this term means that both sides of 
an economic event or business transaction are recorded. For every action
recorded there is a reaction that is also recorded. The debits and credits
method is the means used to implement double-entry accounting.
347
Appendix: Glossary: Slashing Through the Accounting Jargon Jungle

earnings before interest and income tax (EBIT): Sales revenue less cost 
of goods sold and all operating expenses — but before deducting interest
expense and income tax expense (and usually, but not always, before extraor-
dinary gains and losses). This intermediate measure of profit also is called
operating earnings, operating profit, or something similar.
earnings per share (EPS): Equals net income for the most recent 12 months
reported, called the trailing 12 months, divided by the number of capital stock
shares. Dividing net income by the actual number of shares in the hands of
stockholders, called outstanding shares, gives basic EPS. Diluted EPS equals
the same net income figure divided by the sum of the actual number of
shares outstanding plus additional shares that will be issued under terms of
stock options awarded to managers and for the conversion of senior securi-
ties into common stock (if the company has issued convertible debt or pre-
ferred stock securities).
EDGAR: The first name of my father-in-law. Seriously, this is the acronym 
for the database of financial reports and other required filings under federal
securities laws with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Go to
www.sec.gov and navigate to Filings & Forms (EDGAR).
extraordinary gains and losses: Unusual, nonrecurring gains and losses that
happen infrequently and that are aside from the normal, ordinary sales and
expenses of a business. These gains and losses, in theory, are one-time
events that come out of the blue. But in actual practice many businesses
record these gains and losses too frequently to be called nonrecurring. These
gains and losses (net of income tax effects) are reported separately in the
income statement. In this way, attention is directed to net income from the
normal continuing operations of the business — as if the special gains and
losses should be put out of mind.
Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB): The highest authoritative,
private sector, standard-setting body of the accounting profession in the
United States. The FASB issues pronouncements that establish generally
accepted accounting principles (GAAP).
financial leverage: Generally refers to using debt capital on top of equity
capital. The strategy is to earn a rate of return on assets (ROA) higher than
the interest rate on borrowed money. A favorable spread between the two
rates generates financial leverage gain to the benefit of net income and
owners’ equity.
financial reports: The periodic financially oriented communications from a
business (and other types of organizations) to those entitled to know about
the financial performance and position of the entity. Financial reports of busi-
nesses include three primary financial statements (balance sheet, income
348
Accounting For Dummies, 4th Edition 

statement, and statement of cash flows), as well as footnotes and other infor-
mation relevant to the owners of the business. Public companies must file
several types of financial reports and forms with the Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC), which are open to the public. The financial reports of pri-
vate businesses are sent only to its owners and lenders.
financial statement: Generally refers to one of the three primary accounting
reports of a business: the balance sheet, statement of cash flows, or income
statement. Sometimes financial statements are called simply financials. Internal
financial statements and other accounting reports to managers contain consid-
erably more detail, which is needed for decision making and control.
financing activities: One of three basic types of cash flows reported in the
statement of cash flows. These are the dealings between a business and its
sources of debt and equity capital — such as borrowing and repaying debt,
issuing new stock shares, buying some of its own stock shares, and paying
dividends to shareowners.
first-in, first-out (FIFO): A widely used accounting method by which costs of
products when they are sold are charged to cost of goods sold expense in
chronological order. One result is that the most recent acquisition costs
remain in the inventory asset account at the end of the period. The reverse
order also is acceptable, which is called the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method.
fixed assets: The shorthand term for the long-life physical resources used 
by a business in conducting its operations, which include land, buildings,
machinery, equipment, furnishings, tools, and vehicles. Please note that fixed
assets is an informal term; the more formal term used in a balance sheet is
property, plant, and equipment.
fixed costs: Those expenses or costs that remain unchanged over the short
run and do not vary with changes in sales volume or sales revenue. Common
examples are building rent under lease contracts, salaries of many employ-
ees, property taxes, and monthly utility bills. Fixed expenses provide the
capacity for carrying out operations and for making sales.
footnotes: Think of footnotes in a book. Footnotes are attached to the three
primary financial statements included in an external financial report, and
they present detailed information that cannot be put directly in the body of
one of the financial statements. Footnotes have the reputation of being diffi-
cult to read, poorly written, overly detailed, and too technical. Unfortunately,
these criticisms have a lot of truth behind them.
free cash flow: Be very cautious about this term because it has no uniform
meaning; different people use it to mean different things. Some people use it
to mean cash flow from operating activities — to emphasize that this source of
cash is free from the need to borrow money, issue capital stock shares, or sell
assets. But this is not the only meaning you see in practice.
349
Appendix: Glossary: Slashing Through the Accounting Jargon Jungle

generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP): The authoritative stan-
dards and approved accounting methods that should be used by businesses
domiciled in the United States and private nonprofit organizations to mea-
sure and report their revenue and expenses; to present their assets, liabili-
ties, and owners’ equity; and to report their cash flows in their financial
statements. GAAP are not a straitjacket; these official standards are loose
enough to permit alternative interpretations by accountants.
goodwill: In the broad business sense, this term generally refers to brand
name recognition or to the well-known and respected reputation of a com-
pany. Goodwill in this usage means the business has an important asset that
is not reported in its balance sheet. In the accounting context, however,
goodwill has a more restricted meaning. To be recorded and appear in the
balance sheet of a business, goodwill must actually be purchased, such as 
by buying an established brand name or buying a company with an excellent
reputation. Only purchased goodwill is reported as an asset in the balance
sheet. The cost of (purchased) goodwill may or may not be amortized
(charged off to expense over the years).
gross margin (profit): Equals sales revenue less cost of goods sold for the
period. Making adequate gross margin is the starting point for making a
bottom-line profit.
income smoothing: Manipulating the timing of when sales revenue and/or
expenses are recorded in order to produce a smoother profit trend with 
narrower fluctuations from year to year. Also called massaging the numbers,
the implementation of profit-smoothing procedures needs the implicit or
explicit approval of top-level managers, because these techniques require 
the override of normal accounting procedures for recording sales revenue
and expenses. CPA auditors generally tolerate a reasonable amount of profit
smoothing — which is also called earnings management.
income statement: This financial statement summarizes sales revenue (and
income) and expenses (and losses) for a period and reports one or more
profit lines. Also, any extraordinary gains and losses are reported in this
financial statement. The income statement is one of the three primary finan-
cial statements of a business included in its financial report and is also called
the earnings statement, the operating statement, or other similar titles.
internal (accounting) controls: Forms, procedures, and precautions that are
established primarily to prevent and minimize errors and fraud (beyond the
forms and procedures that are needed for record keeping). Common internal
control are: requiring the signature of two managers to approve transactions
over a certain amount; restricting entry and exit routes of employees; using
surveillance cameras; forcing employees to take their vacations; separating
duties; and conducting surprise inventory counts and inspections.
International Accounting Standards Board (IASB): The authoritative finan-
cial reporting standards–setting body for businesses outside the United
350
Accounting For Dummies, 4th Edition 

States (mainly European Union companies at the present time). The IASB
issues broad, general-language standards (a “principles-based approach”), 
in contrast to the technically detailed pronouncements of the Financial
Accounting Standards Board (FASB). The two are working together toward the
harmonization of accounting and financial reporting practices in the United
States and the member nations of the EU.
investing activities: One of three classes of cash flows reported in the 
statement of cash flows. Mainly, these outlays are the major investments 
in long-term operating assets. A business may dispose of some of its fixed
assets during the year, and proceeds from these disposals are reported in
this section of the statement of cash flows.
last-in, first-out (LIFO): A widely used accounting method by which costs of
products when they are sold are charged to cost of goods sold expense in
reverse chronological order. One result is that the ending inventory cost
value consists of the costs of the earliest goods purchased or manufactured.
The actual physical flow of products seldom follows a LIFO sequence. The
method is justified on the grounds that the cost of goods sold expense
should reflect the cost of replacing the products sold, and the best approxi-
mations are the most recent acquisition costs.
lower of cost or market (LCM): A special accounting test applied to inven-
tory that can result in a write-down and charge to expense for the loss in
value of products held for sale. The recorded costs of products in inventory
are compared with their current replacement costs (market price) and with
net realizable value if normal sales prices have been reduced. If either value
is lower, then recorded cost is written down to this lower value.
management (managerial) accounting: The branch of accounting that pre-
pares internal financial statements and other accounting reports and analy-
ses to help managers carry out their planning, decision-making, and control
functions. Most of the detailed information in these reports is confidential
and is not circulated outside the business. Internal profit reports focus on
margin and sales volume, and they should separate variable expenses from
fixed expenses. Management accounting includes budgeting, developing and
using standard costs, and working closely with managers regarding how
costs are allocated.
manufacturing overhead costs: Refers to those costs that are indirect and
cannot be naturally matched or linked with manufacturing particular prod-
ucts, or even to a department or step in the production process. One exam-
ple is the annual property tax on the buildings in which all the company’s
manufacturing activities are carried out. Many overhead costs are fixed and
cannot be decreased over the short run — such as payment for the general
liability insurance carried by a business. Production overhead costs are allo-
cated among the different products manufactured during the period in order
to account for the full cost of each product. In this way, the manufacturing
overhead costs are absorbed into product cost.
351
Appendix: Glossary: Slashing Through the Accounting Jargon Jungle

margin: Equals sales revenue minus cost of goods sold expense and minus all
variable expenses. (In other words, margin is profit before fixed expenses are
deducted.) On a per-unit basis, margin equals sales price less product cost per
unit and less variable expenses per unit. Margin is an exceedingly important
measure for analyzing profit behavior and in making sales price decisions.
market cap: The total value of a business calculated by multiplying the cur-
rent market price of its capital stock times the total number of capital stock
shares issued by the business. This calculated amount is not money that has
been invested in the business, which is subject to the whims of the stock
market.
massaging the numbers: See income smoothing. It’s also called earnings 
management or juggling the books, and it sometimes includes the practice 
of window dressing.
net income: Equals sales revenue less all expenses for the period; also any
extraordinary gains and losses for the period are counted in the calculation
to get bottom-line net income. Bottom line means everything has been
deducted from sales revenue (and other income the business may have) so
that the last profit line in the income statement is the final amount of profit
for the period. Instead of net income, you may see terms such as net earnings,
earnings from operations, or just earnings. You do not see the term profit very
often.
operating activities: Generally this term refers to the profit-making activities
of a business — that is, the mainstream sales and expense transactions of a
business.
operating liabilities: Refers to the liabilities from making purchases on credit
for items and services needed in the normal, ongoing operating activities of 
a business. The term also includes the liabilities for the accumulation, or
accrual, of unpaid expenses in order to record a full cost of the expenses for
the period (such as accumulated vacation pay earned by employees that will
not be taken until later).
owners’ equity: The ownership capital base of a business. Owners’ equity
derives from two sources: investment of capital in the business by the
owners (for which capital stock shares are issued by a corporation) and
profit that has been earned by the business but has not been distributed to
its owners (called retained earnings for a corporation).
pass-through tax entity: A type of legal organization that does not itself pay
income tax but instead serves as a conduit of its annual taxable income. The
business passes through its annual taxable income to its owners, who include
their respective shares of the amount in their individual income tax returns.
352
Accounting For Dummies, 4th Edition 

Partnerships are pass-through tax entities by their very nature. Limited liabil-
ity companies (LLCs) and corporations with 100 or fewer stockholders
(called S corporations) can elect to be treated as pass-through tax entities.
preferred stock: A second type, or class, of capital stock that is issued by a
business corporation in addition to its common stock. Preferred stock derives
its name from the fact that it has certain preferences over the common stock:
It is paid cash dividends before dividends can be paid to common stockhold-
ers; and, in the event of liquidating the business, preferred stock shares must
be redeemed before any money is returned to the common stockholders.
Owners of preferred stock usually do not have voting rights, and the stock
may be callable by the corporation, which means that the business has to
right to redeem the shares for a certain price per share.
prepaid expenses: Expenses that have been paid in advance, or up front, for
future benefits. The amount of cash outlay is entered in the prepaid expenses
asset account. For example, a business writes a $60,000 check today for fire
insurance coverage over the following six months. The total cost is first
entered in the asset account; then, each month, $10,000 is taken out of the
asset and charged to expense. Prepaid expenses are usually much smaller
than a business’s inventory, accounts receivable, and cash assets.
price/earnings (P/E) ratio: The current market price of a capital stock
divided by its trailing 12 months’ diluted earnings per share (EPS) — or its
basic earnings per share if the business does not report diluted EPS.
product cost: Equals the purchase cost of goods that are bought and then
resold by retailers and wholesalers (distributors). In contrast, a manufacturer
combines different types of production costs to determine product cost:
direct (raw) materials, direct labor, and overhead costs.
profit: A very general term that is used with different meanings. It may mean
gains minus losses, or other kinds of increases minus decreases. In business,
the term means sales revenue (and other sources of income) minus expenses
(and losses) for a period of time, such as one year. In an income statement,
the final or bottom-line profit is most often called net income. For public com-
panies, net income is put on a per-share basis, called earnings per share.
profit and loss (P&L) report: A popular title for internal profit performance
reports to managers (that are not circulated outside the company). The term
has a certain ring to it that sounds good, but if you consider it closely, how
can a business have profit and loss at the same time?
property, plant, and equipment: The term generally used in balance sheets
instead of fixed assets.
353
Appendix: Glossary: Slashing Through the Accounting Jargon Jungle

proxy statement: The annual solicitation from a corporation’s top executives
and board of directors to its stockholders that requests that they vote a cer-
tain way on matters that have to be put to a vote at the annual meeting of
stockholders. In larger public corporations, most stockholders cannot attend
the meeting in person, so they delegate a proxy (stand-in person) to vote
their shares yes or no on each proposal on the agenda.
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB): The regulatory
agency of the U.S. federal government created by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of
2002, which was enacted in response to fallout from a number of high-profile
accounting fraud scandals that the CPA auditors of the businesses failed to
discover. This board has broad powers over auditors of public businesses
and the public businesses themselves.
quality of earnings: A pejorative term that raises questions about the relia-
bility of the net income reported by a business. The issue is whether the
profit accounting methods of a business are correct in the circumstances,
and it raises the possibility that reported profit may be overstated.
quick ratio: Calculated by dividing the total of cash, accounts receivable, and
marketable securities (if any) by total current liabilities. This ratio measures
the capability of a business to pay off its current short-term liabilities with its
cash and near-cash assets. Note that inventory and prepaid expenses, the
other two current assets, are excluded from assets in this ratio (which is also
called the acid-test ratio.)
retained earnings: One of two basic sources of the owners’ equity of a busi-
ness (the other being capital invested by the owners). Annual profit (net
income) increases this account, and distributions from profit to owners
decrease the account. The balance in the retained earnings account does 
not refer to cash or any particular asset.
return on assets (ROA): Equals the ratio of some measure of profit divided
by some measure of assets, and is expressed as a percent. Caution: There 
is no one measure of profit or total assets for calculating this ratio. Different
ROA ratios have different uses. The main purpose of calculating ROA is to
test whether a business is using its assets so that it can pay its cost of capi-
tal, which includes interest on its debt and a satisfactory rate of return on
equity (ROE) for its owners.
return on equity (ROE): Equals net income (minus preferred stock dividends
if any) divided by the book value of owners’ equity (minus the amount of pre-
ferred stock) and is expressed as a percent. ROE is the basic measure of how
well a business is doing in generating earnings, or return on the owners’ capi-
tal investment in the business.
354
Accounting For Dummies, 4th Edition 

return on investment (ROI): A very broad and general term that refers to the
income, profit, gain, or earnings on a capital investment, expressed as a per-
centage of the amount invested. Two relevant ROI ratios for a business are
return on assets (ROA) and return on equity (ROE).
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC): The federal agency (established
by the federal Securities Exchange Act of 1934) that has jurisdiction and broad
powers over the public issuance and trading of securities (stocks and bonds)
by business corporations. Although it has the power to legislate accounting
standards, the SEC has largely deferred to the Financial Accounting Standards
Board (FASB). The SEC has authority over the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (PCAOB).
solvency: Refers to the ability of a business (or other entity) to pay its liabili-
ties on time. The current ratio and quick ratio are used to assess the short-
term solvency of a business.
statement of cash flows: One of the three primary financial statements of a
business, which summarizes its cash inflows and outflows during a period
according to a threefold classification: cash flow from operating activities,
investing activities, and financing activities.
statement of changes in owners’ (stockholders’) equity: More in the nature
of a supplementary schedule than a full-fledged financial statement in its own
right. Its purpose is to summarize the changes in the owners’ equity accounts
during the year, including distributing cash dividends, issuing additional
stock shares, buying some of its own capital stock shares, reporting special
types of technical gains and losses that are not reported in the income state-
ment, and who knows what else.
variable costs: Costs that are sensitive to changes in sales volume or sales
revenue. In contrast, fixed costs do not change over the short run in response
to changes in sales activity.
window dressing: An accounting trick or ruse that makes the liquidity and
short-term solvency of a business look better than it really was on the bal-
ance sheet date. The books are held open a few business days after the close
of the accounting year in order to record additional cash receipts (as if the
cash collections had occurred on the last day of the year). This term does
not refer to manipulating profit (see income smoothing). A reasonable amount
of window dressing is not viewed as accounting fraud.
