Introduction to Zen Cart
Zen Cart is an open-source e-commerce shopping cart based on PHP and MySQL. 
It is one of the major derivatives of osCommerce shopping cart. This chapter 
introduces you to Zen Cart and answers the following questions:
What is Zen Cart
What are the main features of Zen Cart
What are the similarities in and differences between Zen Cart and 
osCommerce
What are the advantages of using Zen Cart over osCommerce
Where does Zen Cart stand when compared to other shopping carts
What is Zen Cart?
First, you have to be clear what Zen Cart is. Let's hear from the creators of Zen Cart 
who said the following, on Zen Cart's website www.zen-cart.com :
Zen Cart™ truly is the art of e-commerce; free, user-friendly, open-source shopping 
cart software. The e-commerce website design program is being developed by a 
group of like-minded shop owners, programmers, designers, and consultants who 
think e-commerce web design could be and should be done differently.
From the above lines, it is clear that:
Zen Cart is a shopping cart software application
Zen Cart is open-source
Zen cart was developed by a group of programmers, designers,  
and consultants

Introduction to Zen Cart 
[  ]
Let's see what all of these mean. First, you come to the point of it being a shopping 
cart. In your daily life, you know what a shopping cart is. Whenever you are in a 
store, you browse the goods and put the ones you want to buy  in the shopping cart. 
Once you are done with the shopping, you take that shopping cart to the checkout 
counter and pay for the goods. Once the payment is made in full, the goods you 
have put in the shopping cart are yours. Similarly, in online shopping carts, when 
you are visiting an online store you browse the products in the catalogue, put the 
products you want to buy in the cart, and at the end you checkout from the shop, 
making the payment. Once the payment is made, you can instantly get the products 
(for downloadable products) or the store may arrange shipment of the goods to your 
address. Shopping cart software manages the whole process—from maintaining a 
catalogue to ensuring delivery of the purchased products to customers. Zen Cart is a 
software application that can be used to build and run our online shop. 
Zen Cart is open-source software. Open-source means that its code is open to 
programmers. Programmers have freedom to modify the code for their own 
purposes. Zen Cart is itself an open-source software and is also built using some 
other open-source software. Zen Cart uses PHP as the programming language and 
runs on most Web servers that support PHP. At the backend, it uses MySQL—
another robust, open-source database server—to store products and other 
information in the database.
Like other open-source software, development of Zen Cart is a collaborative effort. 
Although there is a core team of Zen Cart developers, others also contribute and 
develop modules to enhance its functionality. You can interact with the Zen Cart 
community at Zen Cart's forum http://www.zen-cart.com/forum.
Zen Cart is a branch of another open-source e-commerce application, osCommerce. 
osCommerce also uses PHP and MySQL. However, there is lot of debate as to which 
one is better—osCommerce or Zen Cart. You will also learn about the merits and 
demerits of both these shopping carts in this chapter.
The Main Features of Zen Cart
Zen Cart is built for entrepreneurs, by entrepreneurs. Zen cart developers claim 
that the program is built by programmers and designers who understand the online 
selling process from start to finish. Existing users of Zen Cart know that it contains 
all of the necessary tools required to build a successful online store. Zen Cart is also  
being constantly improved and upgraded based on users' requirements.
 

Chapter 1
[  ]
The major features included in Zen Cart are outlined in the following sections:
Easy Installation and Upgradation
Zen Cart has a very easy installation and upgradation system. Its native web-based 
installer checks the database and server requirements before proceeding to install 
Zen Cart. It guides you systematically through installation of the store. Each step 
is well-documented, guiding you through online help tips with a ready to help 
community of Zen Cart users. The installation tool prepopulates the basic store 
information, which helps you to quickly set up the shop. From the installation tool, 
you can also populate optional demo products to explore Zen Cart's features.
Easy Localization
Zen Cart has some useful features for localization. It supports multiple languages, 
multiple currencies, multiple payment methods, shipping methods, and multiple 
tax rates for different tax regions. Some of the language packs, including Arabic, 
Spanish, Dutch, French, German, and Polish are readily available from Zen Cart 
website's download section. You can also add new languages and translate the 
interface into your desired language. 
Similarly, you can show your product prices in any currency. You can add currencies 
of your choices, set conversion rates against base currency, and product prices will 
be shown in any currency the customer wants. You also have an auto-update facility 
for updating the currency conversion rates based on available market data.
Tax rates can vary depending on the shipping address or billing address. You can 
apply different tax rates to different types of products, based on the regions you are 
shipping or billing to. You can also create custom tax and shipping regions as per  
your needs. 
You have an array of options for payment methods. Most of the major online 
payment gateways are supported for online payment processing. Besides online 
payment, you also have options for offline payments such as money order, bank 
transfer, cash on delivery, and so on. You have the full freedom to apply appropriate 
payment methods for specific regions.
Customer Management
Zen Cart has excellent features both for customers and shop administrators, 
especially in managing customers and products. 
 

Introduction to Zen Cart 
[ 10 ]
In a normal Zen Cart shop, customers can browse the products, view the details, 
and register themselves to order a product. Once registered with Zen Cart shop, 
customer information is stored in the database. Then, they can log in to Zen Cart 
shop each time they visit your store. Customers can maintain up to five shipping 
and billing addresses, which can be used when they shop. They can also subscribe to 
newsletters and product notifications of their choice and manage these subscriptions 
from the account details page.
The administrator of the shop can allow customer unrestricted shopping.  You can 
also make registration mandatory for customers to see the prices of the products. 
Administrators have the right to enable or disable any customer at any time. There 
is an excellent way to communicate with a single customer or a group of customers 
from the Zen Cart administration panel. You do not need external email program to 
communicate with customers—Zen Cart handles it for you.
The administrator of the shop can set the shop to be only a showroom. This means 
that products will be displayed in the shop, customers will be able to browse the 
items but they cannot make a purchase. While using it as a showroom, you have the 
option to either hide, or show the prices of the products. At any time, the showroom 
can be brought online and customers allowed to purchase products.
In normal shopping mode, often you may need to make the shop offline for some 
maintenance work. In that case, you can simply switch on the shop in maintenance 
mode, which will show a notice to the customers that you are in maintenance mode 
and will be back soon.
Categories and Products
In Zen Cart, there is no limit to how big the catalog can be. You can build your catalog 
with thousands of products and keep the products in categories. Zen Cart allows you 
to create unlimited nested categories. You also have the ability to copy, move, or link 
a product to another category.
Your catalog may contain both—physical merchandise and downloadable virtual 
products. You can assign attributes to products, and price the products according 
to these attributes. Product options can be shown as drop-downs, option buttons, 
checkboxes, and text inputs. Products can also be marked as "Free" or "Call for 
Price". A product marked "Free" does not require the buyers to pay for it. However, 
shipping charges may apply to it.
 

Chapter 1
[ 11 ]
Customer Retention Tools
Zen Cart has many customer retention tools that allows the store owner to 
communicate with the customers. Zen Cart maintains a customer-base from where 
the administrator can contact any customer through email. The store owner can 
notify customers about new products, promotions, discounts, and many other things. 
The store owner can send order status emails whenever the status of an order is 
changed. This allows the customers to be informed about their orders.
The administrators can send periodic newsletters to customers in plain text or HTML 
format. Customers can subscribe and unsubscribe to newsletters when creating 
their account, or from the account details page. Zen Cart also has referral tools that 
can track customer referrals. Customers can also send the product details to others 
by using the "Tell a Friend" feature. It has a system for gift certificate and discount 
coupon generation and distribution. Customers can use these gift certificates and 
discount coupons for purchasing products from the store.
Promotions, Sales, and Discounts
Promotions, sales, and discounts are common to all shops. Zen Cart also has features 
for adding promotions, sales, and discounts. The administrator can specify special 
prices and sale reductions for individual products, or can apply category-wide 
sales prices. Moreover, the administrator has the opportunity to generate discount 
coupons and send them to customers, who can then use the coupon codes to get 
discounts while shopping. The discount coupons may be configured for specific 
customer groups or for specific quantities of products purchased. This discount may 
be in the form of a one-time value deduction, or percentage deduction. Minimum 
and maximum purchases per product can also be configured. 
Another great feature of Zen Cart is pricing by attributes. Some products may have 
various attributes and choosing those will add or deduct from product-base price. 
 

Introduction to Zen Cart 
[ 12 ]
Powerful Administration Tool
Zen Cart has a powerful administration tool. Zen Cart's administration panel is 
password-protected and only users with administrative privilege can log in to this 
area. From this administrative panel, the administrator can configure minimum and 
maximum values, image sizes, and customer details. Further more, the administrator 
can also:
Choose layout settings for spotlight listings
Pick details to be displayed on the product details page
Edit policy pages with HTML
Add, delete, move, link, or copy products
Create and manage product attributes
Manage product reviews, featured products, specials, and storewide sales. 
Install and manage the shipping and payment module 
Control banner advertising, price, and taxation 
Create and send newsletters
Besides, Zen Cart also has several tools for content management and adding new 
content pages to the shop.
Fully Customizable Catalog Templates
Zen Cart has an easy-to-use template system, which is XHTML 1.0 compliant and 
utilizes a nearly table-less layout. The administrator can:
Change the colors, fonts, and many graphics using Cascading  
Stylesheets (CSS)
Add, move, and remove sideboxes using the administration tool 
Zen Cart template system uses overriding functionality, which means that 
configuration changes do not get overwritten during upgrades. Override 
functionality can be used even without knowing PHP. Using this, the administrator 
can create as many different looks as needed. These templates are easily 
administered and applied to the site from the administration panel.

[ 13 ]
Third-Party Modules
Zen Cart supports a large number of third-party modules that can build on or 
enhance the functionality of Zen Cart. Zen Cart website's download section lists 
almost every conceivable  type of third-party module. The administrators can 
download the third-party modules and install them as per the easy-to-follow 
instructions that come with the module. Most of the modules are designed in such a 
way that they do not need to modify or overwrite Zen Cart core files. 
For a working Zen Cart shop, the administrator may need to install such  
third-party modules. For example, to facilitate administration of Zen Cart shop, the 
administrator may install, 'Backup MySQL Plugin', 'Barcode product field', 'Credit 
Card Fraud Detection', 'Easy Populate', 'Email Archive Manager', 'PayPal Session 
Viewer', 'Sales Report', and so on. From the buttons and graphics category, you 
may also download appropriate buttons in the language that you need, and use 
appropriate graphic icons for your shop.
Third-party modules categorized as marketing tools may be used for product 
marketing and promotion. For example, the 'cross-sell', 'advanced cross-sell', and 
'better-together' modules can be used for adding cross-sell and up-sell features in 
your shopping carts. These modules are discussed in detail in Chapter 6, Promotion 
and Public Relations.
There are more than 100 third-party modules for payment processing. These 
modules can be used for accepting different types of payments and using payment 
processors ranging from PayPal, 2CheckOut, eWay, Google Checkout, LinkPoint, 
MoneyBooker, WorldPay, and so on.
Third-party shipping modules can be used for using different shipping methods 
ranging from Free Shipping, AusPost, UPS, RoyalMail, FedEx, and so on. There are 
some other third party modules that can be used for search engine friendly URL 
generation, adding lightbox effects, changing look and feel, adding header graphics 
and logos, and so on.

Zen Cart versus osCommerce
osCommerce is an open-source application licensed under the GPL and is available 
for free without warranty. For production, the latest milestone release osCommerce 
2.2 milestone 2, released in 2003, is recommended. Although the last release was 
a long time ago, this is a testimony to the stability of osCommerce. Like Zen Cart, 
osCommerce will work on any machine that can run PHP (4.x+) and has access to 
a MySQL database. It is also possible to run osCommerce on a WAMP (Windows/
Apache/MySQL/PHP) or even a WIMP (Windows/IIS/MySQL/PHP).
The idea that drove Zen Cart developers was to make the osCommerce easier 
for users as well as for developers. With this in mind, Zen Cart was built on 
osCommerce. Now, they are two separate products. The programming structure has 
also been changed in Zen Cart, and extra functionalities added.
According to its users, Zen Cart is a better cart than osCommerce, as it is being 
actively developed by a good group who release new versions regularly. 
osCommerce has not had a release for more than two years now. Zen Cart is more 
dynamic, yet is also stable.
 

Chapter 1
[ 15 ]
The only drawback to Zen Cart is that it does not have many modules as compared 
to osCommerce. But if you consider its age, it has progressed a lot in developing 
third-party contributions, and more developers are interested in developing such 
modules for Zen Cart. 
Users have the choice of using either osCommerce or Zen Cart. But having some 
experience of both carts, one would easily be convinced that Zen Cart is a more 
secure and easy-to-use shopping cart than osCommerce.
Feature Comparison
After discussing the general differences between osCommerce and Zen cart, let's 
point out the specific differences between their features. The following sections will 
show how features differ in these two carts.
Default and Contributed Modules
By default, Zen Cart has most of the required modules. You can start using Zen Cart 
for a live shop without installing additional modules. Its administration area is, by 
default, protected and you do not need to install an additional module to protect it. 
Common payment and shipping modules are also installed. 
osCommerce has fewer default modules installed as compared to Zen Cart. 
However, there are hundreds of user-contributed modules to help add desired 
features. The only caveat is that there is no official rating system on the osCommerce 
site for the quality of any of the modules contributed by the third-party developers. 
As per the site's disclaimer, shop owners have to use the modules at their own risk. 
Zen Cart is behind in terms of the number of modules available at its site. However, 
the modules available are clearly-described, and users will not be confused about 
which one to download for what purpose.
Security
By default, Zen Cart has better security than osCommerce. From a security point 
of view, the default installation of osCommerce should not be used in a production 
environment. It must first be customized to harden security.
In osCommerce's default installation, there is no specific admin-login authentication 
protection built into it. If you keep everything unchanged from the default 
installation, anyone can simply visit http://[our site]/catalog/admin and have 
access to the store's administration interface. However, there are user-contributed 
modules for securing the administration area in osCommerce.

[ 16 ]
You can use passwords to protect the administration area through the.htaccess file. 
If there is no time-based cookie authentication system, even with .htaccess (and 
you do access the admin screen), any user that has access to the URL from your Web 
browser can also access the administration system by following that URL.
On the other hand, Zen Cart has a built-in administrative login system. The 
administrative username and password are configured during installation. 
Whenever you want to access the admin area, you must type that administrative 
username and password. You can create additional administrative accounts from the 
admin area via Tools | Admin Settings.
Categories and Products Management
Both osCommerce and Zen Cart support multiple nested categories for products. 
However, osCommerce allows the addition of products and categories at the same 
level, while Zen Cart does not. In Zen Cart, a category may contain only other 
categories or products, but not both.
There are differences on the page for adding new products. In osCommerce, it has 
fewer fields as compared to Zen cart. It simply gives the stock status, availability 
date, tax class, price, product description, quantity, model, image, URL, and weight. 
On the other hand, in Zen Cart, you can also add whether a product is virtual, call 
for price, priced by attributes, if the product is virtual whether shipping address will 
be displayed or not, whether free shipping will be used or not, and so on. 
For adding product images in Zen Cart, you have two options: upload an image to a 
specified directory, or use an existing image from the Web server. In both the cases, 
you have the option to either specify the directory from which the image will be 
used, or to where the image will be uploaded. In osCommerce, you cannot specify 
the image directory, or specify the URL of an image located on the Web server. The 
only option is to upload an image for the product.
Product type is an excellent feature of Zen Cart. It helps us show different products 
with different information and layout. The product type feature allows you to 
configure the display of products based on the product's  attributes. By default,  
Zen Cart will have Product – General and Product – Music types of products. 
You can add additional product types, for example, for selling books, you can add 
'Product - Books'.

Template Customization
The osCommerce default template is unusable for serious e-commerce storefronts. 
Therefore, users want to customize its look and feel at the very beginning. But 
osCommerce has no easy-to-customize templates. The default template and text 
are not easily editable and users must go through each line of the code on the 
appropriate pages to make the changes. The template structure is also table-based, 
and complex to understand, especially because logic and layout are not  
adequately separated.
Zen Cart has an easily-customizable template system where overrides can be used 
to apply customization to the base template. Using this override, you can apply 
multiple templates to a site and get the desired look and feel. Zen Cart templates  
are almost table-less, and fully XHTML 1.0 compliant. It has a developer tool to 
locate strings for translation and modification, which makes it easy to customize  
the templates.
Promotion and Public Relations
Several promotion and public relation tools are built into Zen Cart. It has a built-in 
gift certificate and discount coupon feature which can better promote your products. 
In osCommerce, you need to install a third party module separately to add this 
feature. Similarly, Zen Cart has a SaleMaker, through which you can manage all 
sales. osCommerce has no such built-in feature. In osCommerce, the only way to 
configure a special price is through menu Catalog | Specials. 
User and Developer Community
It's hard to say which one has the largest user community. According to 
osCommerce's claim, it has over 13,000 live shops. For Zen Cart, although the 
number of shops has not been estimated, it may not be an insignificant number. 
Most modern stores run on Zen Cart, as it is easy to use and does not compromise on 
security and flexibility in customization.
osCommerce's biggest strength is its large developer community and a wide variety 
of contributed modules. While a large number of contributed modules may be 
considered as strength, at the same time, this also creates a lot of confusion for 
newbies to osCommerce.

[ 18 ]
Programmatic Differences
Although Zen Cart has been developed from they osCommerce code base, there 
are programmatic differences between the two. Understanding the programming 
differences can help solve migration-related problems when migrating from one 
cart to another. It will be especially helpful when you convert some osCommerce 
modules for use in Zen Cart.
The most significant programmatic difference between osCommerce and Zen 
Cart is that you need register_globals on for osCommerce, whereas Zen Cart 
recommends this setting be kept off. For security reasons, most of the hosting servers 
keep this setting off. Running osCommerce on these servers will be difficult unless 
you work out some way to enable register_globals.
Another major difference between osCommerce and Zen Cart are their use of 
functions and classes. The naming convention for functions is different in both carts. 
Zen Cart functions start with zen_ prefix, whereas osCommerce functions start with 
osc_ or tep_ prefix. 
In osCommerce, tep_db_query() function is used to run a query against the 
database, then a while() loop is used. In Zen Cart,  $db->Execute() function is 
used to run the query, and the while() loop is used differently. 
There are also some differences in the database structure. osCommerce has 54  
database tables, whereas Zen Cart has 93. In osCommerce, the products table 
contains 12 fields, whereas in Zen Cart, it contains around 35 fields. The  
Product_attributes table in Zen Cart also contains a much higher number  
of fields as compared to osCommerce.
Zen Cart has a splendid and easy-to-navigate template system while osCommerce 
doesn't have one at all. In Zen Cart, all template files are located in includes/
templates folder. There is a template override system that can be used to apply 
multiple templates to a site and to customize the template easily. In osCommerce, 
template files are located in the osCommerce installation directory and are difficult 
to customize. The administrators need to override the original files during the 
installation of a new template in osCommerce.
Zen Cart and Other CMS/Shopping Carts
There are other shopping carts and CMSs that can be compared with Zen Cart. The 
following sections describe the main features of these carts/CMSs and compare them 
with Zen Cart. 
 

Chapter 1
[ 19 ]
Joomla-VirtueMart
VirtueMart is a component for the award winning content management system 
Joomla!. It is quite powerful and easy to use. Most of the features of Zen Cart are 
available in VirtueMart component. However, VirtueMart lacks Zen Cart's coupon 
administration system. VirtueMart is a good choice if you are building a content-
based website using Joomla! and want to sell some products from that site. However, 
you cannot use it independently. It must be used together with Joomla! or Mambo.
Joomla provides the core system and the framework on which VirtueMart can  
run. Using these two will provide a complete Shopping Cart Solution within a 
content-based website, together with many other plug-ins such as Forums, FAQ, 
Guestbooks, Galleries, and so on. Changing the look and feel of VirtueMart  
shop is also easy as it uses Joomla's easy to customize CSS and XML/HTML  
based templates. 
CubeCart
CubeCart is a powerful eCommerce script written with PHP & MySQL. CubeCart  
is not open-source software and is not redistributable. With CubeCart, you can  
set up a powerful online store as long as you have hosting that supports PHP and a 
MySQL database.
CubeCart v4 requires, at the least, PHP 4.3.0, MySQL 4.1, and GD (Image Library).  
It can run on both a Linux/Unix or a Windows webserver, but a Linux/Unix server  
is recommended.
CURL with SSL support is required for some shipping/payment modules. 
ZendOptimizer or Ioncube will need to be installed on Windows servers in order  
to run CubeCart v4. On Linux/Unix servers, ZendOptimizer is not required but the 
hosting account must be able to load IonCube loader files.
Considering the features and licensing requirements of CubeCart, Zen Cart is a 
better choice than CubeCart if you are building an online shop from the scratch.
AgoraCart
AgoraCart is a free open-source ecommerce shopping cart software application that 
offers a wide range of features. It has limitless flexibility in many areas including full 
design control through Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), template systems, customizable 
layouts, custom individual product category layouts and templates, modular  
'drop-in and go' code as well as AgoraScript, AgoraCart's own scripting language 
inside parsed HTML pages, which experienced programmers will appreciate.
 

Introduction to Zen Cart 
[ 20 ]
Although AgoraCart has most of the features of Zen Cart, it is not based on PHP. 
AgoraCart is programmed in Perl 5. Therefore, you need to install a Unix/Linux 
based hosting server, supporting Perl 5.6 and runing cgi scripts to host AgoraCart. 
As PHP has better performance and easier templating as compared to Perl, Zen Cart 
will be easier and more attractive than AgoraCart for new online shop owners.`
x-Cart
x-Cart is a commercial shopping cart. Its web-based administrator area and 
installation wizard make setup and maintenance of the shopping cart easy. 24x7 
technical support is also available from its vendor. 
x-Cart has no logical limitations on the number of products. Its code is optimized for 
smooth performance for up to 20,000 products. Depending on server configuration, 
x-Cart can run with up to 500,000 products. 
x-Cart is neither free, nor open-source. The user interface and the operation of x-cart 
remains similar to Zen Cart. X-cart uses the smarty template language, which is not 
any easier than Zen Cart's templating. Moreover, third party modules for Zen Cart 
are mostly free, whereas those for X-cart are sold separately involving a significant 
investment by the shop owner.
Summary
This chapter has introduced Zen Cart and its functionalities. Zen Cart has some 
great features for online shop owners and shoppers. Shoppers can register and keep 
themselves updated on new products at the shop. 
Although Zen Cart is a branch of osCommerce, it has advanced a lot in terms of 
added security, ease of templating and an array of features. Unlike osCommerce, 
some essential features are readily-available in Zen Cart. As Zen Cart has developed, 
it has adopted a simpler and powerful templating system that enables programmers 
to easily customize the look and feel. There are differences in function names and 
database structure in Zen Cart and osCommerce. One should be aware of these 
differences while converting some modules from osCommerce to Zen Cart.
Finally, you have seen how different shopping carts compare to Zen Cart. With 
this little introduction to Zen Cart, you can proceed to its installation and basic 
configuration in the next chapter.
 

Installation and  
Basic Configuration
If you are not using Zen Cart or have not installed it yet, then you need to learn 
about installing Zen Cart, before proceeding to the next chapter. In fact, installation 
of Zen Cart takes very little effort. If you are familiar with other shopping carts/ 
CMS installations, it will not be very difficult for you. In this chapter, you  
are going to learn about installing Zen Cart on your server and making the  
required configuration.
On completion of this chapter, you will be able to:
Describe the prerequisites for installing Zen Cart
Install Zen Cart using Fantastico
Install Zen Cart by uploading files
Upgrade from previous versions
Configure shop for your use
If you have already installed Zen Cart, or you have been using it for a 
long time, then you may skip this chapter.
Prerequisites
Before installing Zen Cart on your server, ensure that you have the required server 
environment. As prerequisites, you need a web server that can support PHP and 
run MySQL database server. The following sections describe the prerequisites for 
installing Zen Cart in more detail.
•
•
•
•
•
 

Installation and Basic Configuration
[ 22 ]
The minimum recommended server requirements for Zen cart installation is: 
PHP 4.3.2 or higher (PHP 4.4.x for optimal performance), 
Apache 1.3.x and higher; and 
MySQL 3.2.x or higher. 
Although Register Globals may be on or off, it is recommended to keep safe_mode 
off. For many shipping and payment modules, CURL has to be installed/compiled  
with PHP.
Support for HTTPS may be required depending on the payment methods being 
accepted. The use of SSL during account creation and check out is also recommended.
At present, Zen Cart does not officially support PHP5. However, many shops are 
successfully running on servers, using PHP5. In August 2007, it was announced on 
Zen Cart's website that Zen Cart version 1.4 and higher will require PHP 5.2 as  
the minimum.
Web Server
You can use Zen Cart on Apache, Microsoft IIS and other web servers that can 
support PHP. If you are using Zen Cart for development or testing purposes, you 
may have local web servers—such as Apache or IIS—installed. For live shops, 
you must have a web server running for live websites. You may have a dedicated 
web host server or a shared web server for hosting. There are a lot of web hosting 
companies offering budget web hosting on Linux-Apache-MySQL-PHP hosting.  
On windows server, PHP or MySQL may not be available in a standard  
hosting package.
For your local computer, you may install web server, PHP and MySQL server 
separately, or install one of the following bundled packages :
WAMP: WAMP is a package of Apache-MySQL-PHP for Windows 
computers. You can download it from www.wampserver.com and install it 
as a windows application. You can get Apache, MySQL and PHP running 
within a few minutes. You will also have phpMyAdmin pre-installed to 
administer MySQL databases.
EasyPHP: EasyPHP, a package of Apache-MySQL-PHP, is simple to install 
and use. You can download it free of charge at www.easyphp.org.
XAMPP: XAMPP is an easy-to-install Apache distribution containing 
MySQL, PHP and Perl. XAMPP is very easy to install and use—just 
download, extract and start. You can download a version for Linux, 
Windows, Mac, or Solaris. It is available at www.apachefriends.org/en/
xampp.html.

Chapter 2
[ 23 ]
Installing any of these packages will ease your administration task for web server 
and MySQL database. However, you are free to install and configure Apache, 
MySQL, and PHP separately.
If you are playing around with Zen Cart, I recommend using a 
development server. You will also need a development environment 
for customizing themes and testing third party contributions. In Linux, 
you can set it up by installing Apache, MySQL, and PHP packages. For 
Windows machines, you need to use one of the above-mentioned  
Apache-MySQL-PHP packages. In Appendix A, we will show how to set 
up a development environment by installing and configuring WAMP on a 
Windows machine.
PHP
If you plan to use Zen Cart, I am sure that you know about PHP. PHP is the hot 
scripting language for the web. You can get �������������������������������
the ���������������������������
latest version of PHP from  
www.php.net. You can download and install PHP package with your web server.  
For IIS, PHP can be configured as CGI or ISAPI; you can use either modes. For Linux, 
Apache-PHP-MySQL is installed by default. If you use WAMP, EasyPHP, or XAMPP 
web server package, you don't have to install and configure PHP separately. 
Database
At present, Zen Cart supports only MySQL. MySQL ������������������������������
version ����������������������
4.1.x is recommended. 
However, Zen Cart can run on MySQL 5 server, but advanced features of MySQL 5 
cannot be used in Zen Cart tables.
The data structure of Zen Cart is given in the mysql_zencart.sql file located in 
the zc_install/sql directory. Database tables will automatically be built during 
installation. However, you have to create the database and the user for login to that 
database before hand. 
If you have installed WAMP or XAMPP, you will get MySQL server installed 
automatically. You can also use phpMyAdmin for managing databases in MySQL 
server. If you are using Linux hosting and cPanel, you can also use cPanel's database 
management tool and phpMyAdmin to create, delete, and manage databases  
and users.
 

Installation and Basic Configuration
[ 24 ]
Step-by-Step Installation
Once all prerequisites have been met, you can proceed to the installation of Zen Cart. 
The following sections describe the installation process for Zen Cart systematically, 
by using Fantastico and by uploading files to the server. 
Through Fantastico
Fantastico is an excellent tool for installing a number of PHP applications on a server. 
Most of the Linux hosting services will give you access to your account through 
cPanel. Along with cPanel, you may also get Fantastico support. One of the benefits 
of installing a PHP application using Fantastico is that you don't need to bother 
about creating databases and uploading Zen Cart files separately.
A detailed discussion of use of cPanel is beyond the scope of this book. 
It is assumed that you know how to login and use cPanel. To learn more 
about cPanel administration, please refer to cPanel User Guide and Tutorial, 
published by Packt.
Step-by-step guidelines for installing Zen Cart using Fantastico are given below:
1.	 Login to cPanel and click on the Fantastico icon.
2.	 A list of available PHP applications will be displayed. Go to the E-commerce 
section and click on Zen Cart link.
3.	 A short description of Zen Cart, current installations, and a link for new 
installation will be displayed. You will be informed about the space  
required for the new installation too. Click on the New Installation link to  
install Zen Cart.
 

Chapter 2
[ 25 ]
4.	 Steps 1 to 3 for Zen Cart installation will be shown. Then , you have to 
provide the following information:
Install on domain: Select the domain on which Zen Cart will be 
installed. If you have a sub-domain of, say, shop.yourdomain.com, you 
can select it, or you can install on yourdomain.com domain.
Install on directory: Enter the name of the directory on which Zen Cart 
will be installed. The directory should not already-exist; Fantastico will 
create a new one. If you want to install Zen Cart in the shop directory 
under your domain's root directory, just type shop in this field. Keep it 
blank to install it in that domain's root directory.
Administrator-username: Enter the name of administrative account. 
This will be used to login to Zen cart administration panel.
Password: Enter a password in this field. This will be needed to access 
the administrative panel.

notify others about this installation by entering their email address and 
pressing Send E-mail Button. You will also see links to your shop catalog 
and the administrative area in this screen.
 

Installation and Basic Configuration
[ 28 ]
By Uploading Files
If you do not have Fantastico, do not worry. You can easily install Zen Cart by 
uploading the required files to the web server. Before doing this, you must download 
the latest version of Zen Cart from www.zen-cart.com. Unzip the zipped or gzipped 
package on your computer. Then, create the directory on your web server's webroot, 
and a database for Zen Cart on the MySQL server. Also, configure a database user to 
have the appropriate permissions (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, CREATE, ALTER, 
INDEX, DROP) on this database. If you are using cPanel, you can use its tools such as 
phpMyAdmin for this.
 

Chapter 2
[ 29 ]
You need an FTP program for uploading files to the server. FileZilla is a nice choice 
for this. 
Web hosts have their preferences in naming folders for running a website. You can 
have many files that don't even get shown to the public. The ones that are available 
for access via a browser are usually in a specific folder, for example, /home/
yourname/public_html or /var/www/yourname/httpdocs or /usr/accounts/a/b/
yourname/httpd and so on. 
You need to upload your files to one of these folders. If you want the shop to be in a 
directory different to that of the webroot, you must create a directory, say shop, in 
the webroot.
Before running the installer, you need to know the following facts:
The physical path to your new Zen Cart directory, for example, /home/
suhreed/public_html/shop
The Virtual HTTP path (the URL of your domain and the directory for your 
shop), for example, http://www.suhreedsarkar.com/shop
The Virtual HTTPS server or the secure URL to your domain, for example, 
https://www.suhreedsarkar.com. You can have a shared certificate on a 
virtual server, for example, https://suhreedsarkar.secureservername.
net/ or https://secure.sharedservername.net/~suhreed.
The Virtual HTTPS path or the secure URL to your domain and directory 
for your shop, for example, https://www.suhreedsarkar.com/shop or 
https://secure.sharedservername.net/~suhreed/shop.
You must take note of these paths before starting the installation. You should  
also know your database name, username, and the password to access it. You have  
now uploaded the files to the shop directory, and you will use it for the  
following examples.

Store Identifier (Table-Prefix): If you are using the same database for 
another application, it is better to separate Zen Cart tables with a prefix. 
Type a prefix for the tables, for example, zen, in this field.
Database Host: Enter the database server's name in this field. Usually, 
it is localhost. If not, you can enter the hostname as dbserver.
yourdomain.com in the Database Host field.
Database Username: For connecting to the database, you need a 
database username. Remember that for shared hosting on the linux 
server, the username used to log into cPanel is prefixed to the database 
username, for example suhreed_zen, where suhreed is the account on 
that server, and zen is the database username. 
Database Password: Enter password for that database user in this field. 
This password must match with the existing database user's password.
Database Name: You have to specify the name of the database   
that will be used for the Zen Cart Shop, for example, zencart or  
yourname_zencart. You must provide the name of an existing 
database. Therefore, you need to create this database beforehand. 
However, Zen Cart Setup can create the tables in the database.
Database Sessions: You can store your session information in the 
database or separate file system. For storing sessions in the database, 
select Yes in this field.
SQL Cache method: Caching SQL queries improves the performance of 
the Zen Cart shop. You can store SQL queries in the database or in file 
systems. Select the method that you want to use. 
Session/SQL Cache Directory: If you select a file system as SQL Cache 
method, specify the directory to be used for caching. By default, this is 
the cache directory under the Zen Cart installation. 
6.	 Click on the Save Database Settings button to proceed to the next step. The

Upgrading from Previous Versions
Although installation of Zen Cart is very straightforward, you have to think 
twice before upgrading to a newer version of Zen Cart. The main concern during 
upgrading is to keep the existing product catalog and customer base intact. As 
you are running a live shop, you must always try to minimize offline time for 
maintenance. You will also need to ensure that your custom look and feel for the 
shop works flawlessly with the newer version of Zen Cart.
Before starting the upgrade, you need to experiment with it to ensure that it does not 
disrupt your shop's operations. For each new release, there are important documents 
in the /docs folder of the Zen Cart ZIP file.  Please check the 2.readme_how_to_
upgrade.html file for any special notes about the version you are upgrading from 
and upgrading to. Always keep a backup of your database and your files before 
starting the upgrade.
During the upgrade, a file-comparison tool such as WinMerge, Beyond 
Compare or ExamDiff (Linux) may be very helpful to you. These tools 
will help you  compare file changes, and understand implication of these 
changes. Once you understand the changes, you may have a clearer 
picture of what to expect after upgrading.
It is better if you can install the new version as a separate shop, with demo data, 
and browse through it to understand the new features. Doing so will help you 
understand whether that version will be compatible with your previous version of 
Zen Cart. 
Preparation for Upgrading
First, unzip a copy of the new version of Zen Cart, upload it on to your web server, 
into a demo folder, install the new version into a separate database, and also include 
the demo products (these can be deleted after the conversion is complete).
Then, study the new features, and the changes to the template structures, as well as 
the change log. Use the demo products in the demo shop as examples. Also read the 
supporting documentation provided with the new release.
Take a full backup of your database by exporting it to an SQL file. Then, make a full 
backup of all of your site files and keep the backup on your computer. You may want 
to call this backup zen_backup.
Now, unzip a copy of the original Zen Cart files for your installed version. This 
should be placed in a separate working folder on your PC, perhaps \zen_orig. 
Then, make a list of any add-ons that you may have installed, for later reference.
 

Chapter 2
[ 41 ]
Run a tool such as WinMerge to compare the original Zen Cart files in \zen_orig 
against your working backup files in \zen_backup. Note all of the files that are 
different - these are the files that you have changed or configured. In WinMerge, 
double-click on each file and note what the differences are. If the differences are just 
language definitions for display text, they will be simple to carry forward.
If the differences are actual programming/code differences, you will need to make 
detailed notes in order to replicate those changes in the new version. Any mods/
add-ons you've installed are likely to contain many programming changes, and may 
not be fully compatible with the newer Zen Cart release.
Replicating File Changes
After identifying the changed files, go through each changed file, and copy your 
changes from the old version into the new version. Simple language edits will be just 
a matter of copy and paste. Programming changes to core components will be more 
difficult and may require significant testing.
Note that there will be several changes you will have to make to files that you have 
overridden using the template overrides system. Thus, you'll want to compare files 
from /includes/templates/MYTEMPLATE/* to /includes/template/template_
default/*. Similarly, you will have to compare and change language files and 
sidebox overrides. 
Testing and Upgrading
As indicated earlier, it is better to have a new database for the upgraded version, 
as the database structure may be different to the previous version. Therefore, you 
have to create a new database in which to install the new version of Zen Cart. Make 
a fresh database backup for your existing shop to include the last order that might 
have been processed, or the last customer registration. Now, restore your database  
to the new database you just created.
Now, you have to edit the includes/configure.php file to reflect the new database. 
If your /zen_new folder doesn't have /includes/configure.php and /admin/
includes/configure.php files, copy them from the old store folder. Then, edit the/
zen_new/includes/configure.php file to ensure that your DATABASE_NAME 
matches the new database that you have created. Make sure that the database 
username and password have also been changed.  Now, save these changes so that 
you can upload the files to the web server.
 

Installation and Basic Configuration
[ 42 ]
Upload the modified files from the /zen_new folder to your web server into an 
alternate folder, for example, /zen_138. Once you have uploaded the files, run the 
/zc_install/index.php file, and choose Upgrade when prompted. Don't select 
Install at this stage as it will overwrite your database. If you do not find the upgrade 
option, then it may be the case that the installer was unable to connect to your 
database and confirm the database's version. In this case you should check your 
configure.php settings and correct accordingly.
Before going live, place the shop in Down for Maintenance mode from the admin 
area. Then, you need to add your IP address to the list of allowed addresses to get 
into the site for previewing. You must test the site to ensure that things are operating 
as planned. If you have any small problems to repair, turn Down for Maintenance 
on and off again as required.
Basic Configuration of the Store
On finishing the installation or upgrade, you may be tempted to check the new face 
of your shop.  You may go straight to the store on completion of the installation 
process by clicking a button. Alternatively, you could open your browser and point 
it to http://www.yourdomain.com/shop/. Here, shop is the folder where you have 
installed Zen Cart. This will show the store with the demo categories and products 
and using the default design of of the store.
 

Chapter 2
[ 43 ]
Note that, at the top, there are two warnings in red. These warnings ask you to remove 
the zc_install directory and make the  includes/configure.php file read-only. 
You must resolve these problems before proceeding to change anything else.
Removing the Installation Directory
The first step after installation is to remove the installation directory, zc_install. 
Keeping this directory threatens the security of your site, as other people may 
point their browser to www.yourdomain.com/shop/zc_install/ and override the 
installation settings. Therefore, you should either delete the whole directory, or 
rename it (in which case the name should be complex and hard to guess).
Setting Appropriate Directory and File 
Permissions
Some of the files and folders need special permissions to be set. For security reasons, 
you need to ensure that appropriate permissions are set to these files and folders. If 
appropriate permissions are not set, the browser will issue some warning messages. 
This section describes how to set up appropriate permissions on the Zen Cart folders 
and files.
Using FTP Programs
Most of the FTP programs allow you to change file permissions. Connect to your 
site using the FTP program, navigate to your public_html directory, and perhaps 
into your zencart folder underneath public_html. Then, look for a Properties 
command that can be applied to that directory. If you right-click on the folder, you 
will find Properties as one of the options.
If you are using FileZilla, you have to right-click on the folder and select File 
Attributes. Then, you change the permissions to the required settings for the 
following folders, as indicated below:
 

Installation and Basic Configuration
[ 44 ]
Set 777 (read, write, execute for all) to all of these folders:
/cache
/pub
/images
/includes/languages/english/html_includes
/admin/backups
/admin/images/graphs
Set 444 (read only) or 644 (read-write for owner, for others read-only) to these files:
/includes/configure.php
/admin/includes/configure.php
Using cPanel
If you are using cPanel, you can use its file manager to set permissions on the files 
and folders. Open File Manager, and browse to the folder where you have put your 
Zen Cart files. Click on the link of the file or folder (not on the icon), and then click 
on the Change Permission link on the right. You will see a permission setting box on  
the right, as shown below.
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
 

Chapter 2
[ 45 ]
Set permissions to read, write and execute for the User, Group, and World groups by 
checking the appropriate nine checkboxes. You will see the permissions as numerical 
values (such as 644) in the Permission field. If there is an option to process all files 
under this subdirectory, check that box. Then, click Change or OK (or whatever) 
button to process the changes.
Using SSH
If you have SSH access instead of cPanel, you could type the following commands:
	
chdir /home/suhreed/public_html/shop (substitute your actual  
	
working directory). 
	
chmod -R 777 ./cache 
	
chmod -R 777 ./pub 
	
chmod -R 777 ./images 
	
chmod -R 777 ./includes/languages/english/html_includes 
	
chmod -R 777 ./admin/backups 
	
chmod -R 777 ./admin/images/graphs 
 
	
chmod 444 ./includes/configure.php 
	
chmod 444 ./admin/includes/configure.php
Note that, uppercase R is important in these commands.
If you are using shared hosting, access to your server through SSH may not be 
available. In that case, using cPanel file manager is the best choice.
On a Windows Server
If you are using Windows server for your Zen Cart shop, you can set permissions to 
the folders and files as follows:
1.	 Navigate to the wwwroot folder or to the path where your Zen Cart files are in.
2.	 From the list of folders and files, right-click on a particular file or folder.
3.	 Choose Properties from the pop-up menu.
4.	 Click on the Security tab.
5.	 Now, add the IUSR_xxxx user account ������������������������������������
where xxxx is the computer name ����
and 
give it read write permissions. IUSR_xxxx account is the local account for 
accessing your folders.
6.	 Click on OK to close the Properties box.
7.	 If you do not see a Security tab in step 4 above, you have to simply select the 
Read and Write boxes. Deselect the read-only checkbox if it is already select.
8.	 Repeat these steps for all required files/folders, as indicated earlier in  
this section.
 

Installation and Basic Configuration
[ 46 ]
On a Windows PC
You can also try your Zen Cart on Windows PC (Windows 2000 Professional, 
Windows XP, and so on). In such cases, you have to set the following folder and  
files permissions:
1.	 Navigate to the wwwroot folder or the path your Zen Cart files are in.
2.	 Right-click on the required files or folders as listed earlier.
3.	 Choose Properties.
4.	 Set the read-only flag on or off depending on your requirements
5.	 Click Apply or OK.
6.	 Repeat for all the required files/folders.
You may be interested to know more about CHMOD and the permission 
system. For getting a good lesson on CHMOD and linux permission 
system, you can—visit the following sites: http://en.wikipedia.

Changing Configuration File
Zen Cart's configuration options are set in the database. However, for connecting 
to the database and locating the required files and directories, a configuration file 
is used. Zen Cart's main configuration file is includes/configure.php. This file 
contains the directory and database connectivity variables. Usually, you don't have 
to edit this file manually - it is configured during installation. However, you may 
need to edit it manually if you want to change the database name, user, or password. 
If you relocate a directory, you will also need to reflect this in the file.
Now, let's have a look at the main variables in this file and understand what each 
variable means:
// Define the webserver and path parameters
// HTTP_SERVER is your Main webserver: eg, http://www.yourdomain.com
// HTTPS_SERVER is your Secure webserver:  
                                        eg, https://www.yourdomain.com
  define('HTTP_SERVER', 'http://www.suhreedsarkar.com');
  define('HTTPS_SERVER', 'https://www.suhreedsarkar.com');
// Use secure webserver for checkout procedure?
  define('ENABLE_SSL', 'false');

Installation and Basic Configuration
[ 48 ]
This file is self-explanatory. For most of the variables, instructions are given inside 
comments (lines starting with //). In most cases, you may need to change the 
DIR_WS_CATALOG and DIR_WS_HTTPS_CATALOG variables to reflect your installation 
directory. Also, you may need to change the DB_SERVER_USERNAME, DB_SERVER_
PASSWORD, and DB_DATABASE variables. Note the differences between DIR_WS_* 
and DIR_FS_* variables. DIR_WS_* variables are for the webserver. This means that  
DIR_WS_CATALOG represents the webserver path to the catalog directory, for example,  
http://www.suhreedsarkar.com/shop. On the other hand, DIR_FS_* is for the 
file system path. This means that DIR_FS_CATALOG represents the path in the files 
system, for example,  /home/suhreed/public_html/shop/.
There is another file for the admin section—admin/includes/configure.php. This 
file is completely different from the includes/configure.php file and must not be 
accidentally overwritten. The admin/includes/configure.php file contains settings 
for the secured admin area. Some of the variables in this file are:
//following settings are webserver paths

There are also settings for the database and cache folders. Database settings are the 
same as the includes/configure.php file.
Using the Administration Panel
Once you have installed Zen Cart, you can try to log in to the admin area. Point 
your browser to http://www.youdomain.com/shop/admin/. Then, type the 
administrative username and password, which you had defined during installation. 
You can click on the Login button to proceed.
The administration panel is the area from where you will configure your store 
for public use, and add products to your catalog. This panel will also be used for 
managing customers, products, and orders. 
When you first enter the administration panel, you will see a dashboard with a 
summary of products available, orders received, orders unfulfilled, new customers, 
new orders, and other statistics for your shop. This information is very useful for a 
shop owner for monitoring day to day operations.
 

Installation and Basic Configuration
[ 50 ]
To make your store usable for others, you have to configure your store first, that is 
configure its name, address, shop owner's email, email transportation method, and 
so on. You can configure your shop from Configuration | My Store. We will learn 
about these configuration options in the next chapter.
Summary
In this chapter, you have learned about prerequisites to installing Zen Cart. You have 
also learned the step-by-step procedures for installing Zen Cart using Fantastico, 
and by file uploading. Then you learned about upgrading from an older version to a 
newer version of Zen Cart. 
You have also learned about the file and folder permissions that need to be set for 
effective operation of the Zen Cart shop. You have seen that certain files and folders 
need special permission for read and write. Finally you have learned how to login to 
the admin areas and configure the shop's name, address, and so on.
Once the installation is complete, the shop has to be configured for the customers' 
use. Zen Cart includes a lot of configuration options. In the next chapter, you will 
learn about configuring the shop. Until then, you can reward yourself with a mug of 
coffee for having installed Zen Cart successfully!
 

Configuring the Store
By now, you have learned how to install Zen Cart and log into the administration 
area. In this chapter, you are going to learn about different configuration options for 
the store. 
On completion of this chapter, you will know:
How to set global configuration options for a Zen Cart store
How to manage the product catalogue
How to install and configure payment, shipping, and order total modules for 
Zen Cart store
How to manage customers and orders
The configuration options introduced in this chapter are essential.
Shop Configuration
Before launching your shop online, you have to configure several aspects of your 
shop. First, you configure the store's name, address, store owner's name, login 
options, product listing, payment, and shipping options, and so on. Then, you add 
categories and products to your product catalog. Once the shop is live, customers 
will place orders and you will have to manage those orders.

Configuring the Store
[ 52 ]
Store Name and Address
Before launching your online shop, you need to specify your store's name and 
address. You can define these via Configuration | My Store. You should at least 
change the Store Name, Store Owner, Country, Zone, Store Address, and Phone. 
These are the essentials for starting your online shop.
There are some interesting settings on this screen. If your store is multilingual, then 
you can specify in what language the store will be shown—based on the store's 
default language or on the browser's language settings. Select Default or Browser in 
the Language Selector field, as required. 
When showing the category lists, you may want to know how many products are 
there in each category. Select true in the Show Category Counts field to show the 
product counts. Similarly, you can show the products count in the admin area by 
selecting true in the Show Category Counts – Admin field.
Product prices can be shown with tax. Set Display Prices with Tax to display the 
prices inclusive of tax. You can also specify the basis on which the product and 
shipping taxes are computed. This may be based on the tax rules in the originating 
country (where store is located), billing address (from where the bill will be paid), 
or destination country (where the product is shipped to). You have to select the 
appropriate settings in these fields.
 

Chapter 3
[ 53 ]
You can use a Zen Cart store as a showcase or as a normal store by setting the 
following values in the Store Status field:
0 (=Normal Store): Setting 0 in Store Status field will display the store  
in normal mode where customers can buy products from the store.
1 (=showcase no prices): Setting this value will display the shop as a 
showcase, where customers will not be able to place orders. This option  
will only show the product listing and descriptions, but not the prices. 
2 (=Showcase with prices): setting this value in Store Status field will 
display the shop in showcase mode and also display the product prices.
Another important setting on the My Store screen is the Currency Conversion 
Ratio. You can automatically update currency exchange rates in Zen Cart. In this 
case, you may want to uplift the conversion by a certain ratio. This will be added 
to the conversion rate. As the bank rate is obtained from the currency-exchange 
servers, this conversion ratio will enable you to charge extra in order to make up the 
difference between the bank rate and the consumer rate.
Customer Information
You can define the extent to which you are going to collect information on 
customers. From the Configuration | Customer Details screen, you can define 
the fields that are going to be presented during account creation, and identify the 
absolute essentials for purchasing a product from your store.
You may want to know the customer's age to be sure that the person who is buying 
a product is an adult and legally authorized to transact online. For this, you require 
the birth date of each customer during account creation. Set the Date of Birth option 
to true. This will show the Date of Birth field during account creation. However, the 
customers could leave it blank. To make it a required field, set the value >0 in the 
Date of Birth field in the Configuration | Minimum Values screen.
You can show or hide the Company, Address Line 2, State, and Fax Number fields. 
If you want to show the states as a drop-down list, set the State - Always display 
as pulldown? field to true. Further, if you can set a default country from the Create 
Account Default Country ID field. If you want to promote your newsletter, set 1 or 
2 in the Show Newsletter Checkbox field.  Similarly, you can set Customer Default 
Email Preference to 1 =Text or 2 =HTML.

Configuring the Store
[ 54 ]
Some online shops require users to sign up before they can browse products and 
make purchases. If you want to do this, change the Customer Shop Status – View 
Shop and Prices field. You can set a value of 0 to 3:
If you want all visitors to be able to browse the products, but only require 
registration to place an order, then set its value to 0. 
If you want only registered customers to be able to browse the products, then 
set its value to 1 =Must login to browse. 
Setting it to 2 means everyone can browse the products but they cannot see 
the prices until they login to the shop. 
If you want to make it a showroom, so that nobody can place an order, set 
this field to 3 =Showroom only.
Some of the other settings related to Customer Authorization are also on this screen. 
Default values will work for most of the shops. 
You may want to track customer referrals, and provide a discount coupon up on 
signing up to your shop. In this case, you must define the necessary setting in the 
Customer Referral Status field. You may keep it off (0), use 1st Discount Coupon 
Code (1), or allow customer to type a coupon code during account creation (2). If 
you really want to give your customers a discount coupon on signing up, create a 
discount coupon via Gift Certificates/Coupon | Coupon Admin first. Then, select 
that coupon in the New Signup Discount Coupon ID# field from the Configuration 
| GV Coupons screen.
Actual configuration of gift vouchers and discount coupons are discussed 
in detail in Chapter 6, Promotion and Public Relations. In that chapter you 
will learn how to configure and send discount coupons to customers on 
different occasions.
Product Listing
You can configure for how the product list and descriptions will be shown. From 
Configuration | Product Listing, you can define the fields that will be displayed on 
the product listing page. The first half of the options controls the fields that appear 
in the product listing, and their order. If you want an element to not appear on the 
page, give it a value of 0. A non-zero value means the element will be shown, and the 
number defines the sort order for the field. 
The Display Product Listing Default Sort Order setting on the same page depends 
on these settings. Settings with a value (that is, sort order) of 0 will be ignored, while 
the rest will be assigned an incrementing ID based on the sort order.  For example, 
•
•

•
 

Chapter 3
[ 55 ]
if you set Display Product Name to 1, Display Product Price/Add to Cart to 3 and 
the rest to 0, then Display Product Name is assigned an ID of 1 and Display Product 
Price/Add to Cart is assigned an ID of 2 (not 3, which is the sort order). 
You can also edit Display Product Listing Default Sort Order. This setting should 
contain two characters; the first character is the ID of the field which has already 
been discussed, and the second character should be the letter 'a' for ascending, or 'd' 
for descending. If you want to sort product field, in descending order, then use 2d. 
From this screen, you can also enable or disable display of product images, the 
add to cart box, product name, module, manufacturer, price, weight, quantity box, 
category, and so on.
Email Options
Several emails can be sent to your customers from your Zen Cart shop. Usually, 
customers who subscribe to newsletters and product notifications receive regular 
emails. However, whenever a customer registers or places an order, he or she 
receives an email. For some other reasons, you may also need to notify the customers 
from time to time. You can set various email configuration options via Configuration 
| Email Options. As a minimum, you have to configure the following options:
Email Transport method: You must specify whether the server will use 
a local connection to send mail or use an SMTP connection via TCP/IP. 
Servers running on Windows and MacOS should change this settings to 
SMTP. SMTPAUTH should be used only when your server requires SMTP 
authorization to send messages. You must also configure your SMTPAUTH 
settings in the appropriate fields in this admin section. Sendmail -f is only 
for servers which require the use of the -f parameter to send email. This is 
a security setting often used to prevent spoofing. The default for this field is 
sendmail, and this will work fine with Linux servers.
Use MIME HTML When Sending Emails: Set this to true if you want to 
send emails in HTML format. Otherwise keep the default value of false.
Send Copy of *: There are several options such as Send Copy of Order 
Confirmation Emails To. Type an appropriate email address to which 
the notifications will be sent. If your store is small, and only one person 
handles all these, then set only one email address for all of the fields. But for 
large stores, you may assign several people to order tracking, gift voucher 
management, review management, and so on. In this case, you must provide 
email addresses of those persons or departments.
SMTP Email Account Mailbox: If you have selected SMTPAUTH as the 
email transport mechanism, then type email account's SMTP mailbox name.

SMTP Email Account Password: Here, enter the password for your SMTP 
mailbox. This field is required only if you are using SMTPAUTH as the  
email transport.
SMTP Email Mail Host: Here, enter the DNS name of your SMTP mail 
server, for example, mail.yourdomain.com. This is required only if you are 
using SMTPAUTH as the email transport mechanism.
SMTP Email Mail Server Port: Here, enter the IP port number, generally 25, 
that our SMTP mail server operates on. This is required only if you are using 
SMTPAUTH as email transport mechanism. 
When facing problems with email, always check these configurations first.
Logging 
Logging is important for your online shop, especially when you face problems 
with your shop. You can set the options for controlling how events are logged via 
Configuration | Logging. The following are some of the options:
Store Page Parse Time: Set this to true if you want to log the time it takes 
to parse a page. This information may be helpful to analyze your store's 
performance.
Log Destination: Here, set the directory and filename of the page parse time 
log in this field. The default is /var/log/www/zen/page_parse_time.log. 
Change it to your required path.
Log Date Format: Set the date format to be used in logging. The default 
format is %d/%m/%Y %H:%M:%S.
Display The Page Parse Time: You can display the page parse time at the 
bottom of each page by setting this field to true. Otherwise, storing parse 
time in the log file will be a good choice. 
Store Database Queries: Storing database queries in the log file may help 
you troubleshoot query problems later. Set this value to true if you want to 
store the database queries in the page parse time log.
Log files are always helpful for troubleshooting. It is recommended that you enable 
logging for your online shop. This will give you the opportunity to analyze what 
happens in your shop. Also remember to manage the log file. You may need to clear 
the log file regularly to limit its growth.

Regulations
Every online store has some rules and regulations that must be followed by the 
customers. You must always provide the terms and conditions of purchasing 
products from your online shop, and obtain the customers' acceptance of these. You 
can set the terms and conditions for the customers in Configuration | Regulations.
If you set Confirm Terms and Conditions During Checkout Procedure to true, the 
Terms and Conditions page will be shown during the checkout procedure, and the 
customer must agree to them before they can complete their purchase. This is a good 
way of reminding the customer of the terms and conditions of purchasing products 
from your shop.
Nowadays, most of the customers are aware of their privacy. As you collect some 
private information from the customers, it would be good to show a privacy notice 
during account creation. Set Confirm Privacy Notice During Account Creation 
Procedure to true to show the privacy notice during the account creation procedure, 
which the customer must agree to before they can create their account.
You must develop your terms and conditions carefully. This should be 
legally correct and also acceptable to both parties. You will find some 
standard notices at Zen Cart website's download section.
EZ Pages
EZ-pages in Zen Cart give us opportunities to easily create static pages. From the 
Configuration | EZ Pages Settings page, you can set various options to configure 
the EZ-Pages. Creation and editing of EZ-Pages is controlled via Tools | EZ-Pages. 
You can set the elements of an EZ Page that will be shown – header, footer, left 
sidebar, right sidebar, Prev/Next buttons, table of contents, and so on. The default 
settings for these fields are suitable for most of online shops. However, you have the 
option of changing them to suit your requirements.
Images
A variety of images are shown in Zen Cart shop. You can configure the images and 
the way these images will be shown. Via Configuration | Images, you can set the 
options used to control the size of images on each page/for each type of content. Set 
these to the same size as the images you create. Otherwise, your images will appear 
distorted. There are some general options on how the images are handled, and a 
single option that controls the layout of additional product images on the Product 
Info page. You can set the options any way that you want them.
 

Configuring the Store
[ 58 ]
GZip Compression
From the Configuration | GZip Compression page, you can control the GZip 
compression settings for your online shop. Enabling GZip Compression means that 
all content from your store is compressed before it is downloaded to the user. The 
contents are then decompressed by the user's web browser. This compression and 
decompression is transparent to the user and significantly speeds up their browsing. 
It is therefore recommended that you turn this on if your webserver supports it.
Stock
You can set options to control various options regarding stock control via 
Configuration | Stock. There are also two Shopping Cart page layout options here. 
To get an updated stock level, enable Check stock level and Subtract stock. Specify 
a mark that will be shown when a product is out of stock. In Show Sold Out Image 
in Place of Add to Cart field, set 1 to show an image when a product is out of stock. 
You may set a Stock Re-order Level to a convenient value, instead of the default of 
5. If you want to show products that are out of stock, select 1 in the Products status 
in Catalog when out of stock should be set to field. 
Shipping/Packaging
If you are selling physical products, then shipping and packaging options will be an 
important issue for your shop. You can set general shipping information including 
locations, and weight and size limits via Configuration | Shipping/Packaging. The 
following options needed to be configured:
Country of Origin: The country of origin from which the products will be 
shipped. This will be used for calculating the shipping cost.
Postal Code: Here, enter the postal code (ZIP code) of the store. This is to be 
used in the shipping quote. 
Enter the Maximum Package Weight you will ship: The shipping methods 
you are using may prohibit you from shipping a heavy package. Generally, 
carriers have a maximum weight limit for a single package. Set the maximum 
weight limit that can be shipped through all carriers. 
Package Tare Small to Medium—added percentage:weight: Here, you 
should define a percentage of the product weight as packaging. This is 
expressed as two numbers separated by a colon. The first number is a 
percentage of the weight of what will be our small package weight. The 
second is our small package weight maximum or upper limit.

Larger packages—added packaging percentage:weight: Here,  you should 
define a percentage of product weight as packaging. This is expressed as two 
numbers separated by a colon. The first number is a percentage of the weight 
of what will be our large package weight. The second is our large package 
weight average or maximum or upper limit.
Display Number of Boxes and Weight Status: You must specify whether 
you want to show the number of boxes, the weight, or both the number of 
boxes and the weight during checkout. Set 0 to show none, 1 to show the 
number of boxes only, 2 to show the weight only, and 3 to show both the 
number of boxes and weight. The default is set to 3.
Order Free Shipping 0 Weight Status: For some products, the weight may 
be zero. In that case, calculating the shipping cost returns no value. You may 
consider such products as being eligible for free shipping. Set 1 to use free 
shipping for such products.
Shipping Estimator Display Settings for Shopping Cart: You can show 
a link to the shipping estimator on our shopping cart. Set 1 to show it as a 
button, and 2 to show it as a link.
Shipping Estimator Display Settings for Shopping Cart: You can show a 
link for the shipping estimator on your shopping cart. Set this filed to 1 to 
show it as a button, and 2 to show it as a link.
Display Order Comments on Admin Invoice: For this option, there are 
again three options, 0= OFF means that comments will not be displayed on 
the Admin Invoice. Option 1= First Comment by Customer only will show 
the comments by the customes only. Option 2= All Comments for the Order 
means that all of the comments for the order wll be displayed on the  
Admin Invoice.
Display Order Comments on Admin Packing Slip: This is very much 
similar to the above option.
Attribute Settings
Via Configuration | Attribute Settings, you can set options for controlling which 
product attributes are maintained, and whether downloadable products are allowed, 
and how they are handled. For downloadable products, there are eight options.  
First, you have to set Enable Downloads to true. Then, you have options to set  
the following: 
Which method will be used for downloading—redirecting or streaming?
After how many days will a download product expire? 
How many downloads are allowed per product? 
How will the download controller status be updated?

Other attribute settings are for pricing. You can enable price factors, quantity price 
discounts, attribute images, and text pricing by word or by letter. 
Credit Cards
For online payments, you have the option to enable use of the credit cards. Via 
Configuration | Credit Cards, you can determine which credit cards can be 
accepted. However, this will not turn payment processing on. It will simply enable 
customers to use specific credit card, and display the credit card on the payment 
page. We can show the credit cards list as text or images. To show the image, set 2 
in the Credit Card Enabled - Show on Payment field. You also need to upload the 
credit card images to the images directory and define these images in the language 
file. Editing the language file is discussed in Chapter 5, Localization of Zen Cart.
Product Info
From Configuration | Product Info, you can set some basic options for controlling 
the elements that are included on the Product Info page. You can also set some page 
layout options for the Previous and Next buttons. These settings will be applied to 
all product types. 
You may define the product image, height and weight, previous and next buttons, 
previous and next bar position, and so on. From here, you can set the contents of the 
product information page.
Layout Settings
A wide range of options for controlling different layout options are available via 
Configuration | Layout Settings. These are global options that will appear on all 
pages, and there are also some options for individual sideboxes. From here, you 
can set column widths, breadcrumb positions and option, category display, banner 
display, and so on. Although you can change the width of the left and right columns, 
it would be wiser to look at your templates first. Changing these values may change 
your look and feel unexpectedly.
Zones, Currencies, and Taxes
The countries of the world can be divided into zones. These zones are useful for 
applying taxes and calculating shipping costs. Zen Cart can use multiple currencies 
in your shop. You can also use taxes specific to a zone. Zones, Currencies, and Taxes 
are managed from the Locations/Taxes menu. These are discussed in detail, in 
Chapter 5, Localization of Zen Cart.
 

Chapter 3
[ 61 ]
Catalog
After configuring the shop, the shop owner's main task will be to manage the 
product catalog and orders. You can add and change products and categories from 
the Catalog Menu.
Product Types
Product Types in Zen Cart allow us to present different information for types of 
products in the shop (and possibly in a different format). If you are selling books, for 
example, you should show some special information, such as author name, edition, 
ISBN, number of pages, cover type, and so on. A product type, say a book, can collect 
this custom information in addition to other generic product information for that book. 
Similarly, a product type, say music, will collect different information (artist name, 
download size, mp3 clip) and will be displayed differently. Catalog | Product Types 
allows us to view and edit product types. 
On the Catalog | Product Types page, you will see a listing of product types. For 
each product type, you can select the default settings, such as default tax class for 
the new products of that type. You can also set layout options by clicking on the edit 
layout button. You will see the layout options for the product type you have chosen.
When you are creating products via Catalog | Categories/Products, beside the 
New Product button you will see a pull-down menu for choosing a product type. 
The product type that you select from this menu is the type of product that you will 
create. The product creation form will be different depending on the product type 
you have chosen.
By default, the music product type is bundled with Zen Cart v 1.3.7.x. For 
earlier versions, there was a product type named book. I liked that for 
creating a book store. That add-on has been archived now.

Manufacturers
Products should be cataloged according to manufacturer. This manufacturer 
information can also be displayed on the product details page. Catalog | 
Manufacturers allows us to view, add, edit, or delete manufacturer information.
You can add a manufacturer by clicking on the insert button. This will display  
the new manufacturer screen (shown above). The following information should be 
provided on this screen:
Manufacturers name: Here, enter the manufacturer name,  
for example, Canon.
Manufacturers Image: Here, navigate to and select the product image on 
your computer. This image will be uploaded to your webserver.
Upload to directory: Select the directory on the webserver to which the 
manufacturer's image will be uploaded. Alternatively, you can keep all of the 
manufacturers' images in one directory. Then, if you have already uploaded 
the image to that directory, you can select a folder and enter the image name 
in the Or, select an existing image file from server, filename: field.
Manufacturers URL: Here, enter the URL for the manufacturer's website.

Categories/Products
Once you have added the product types and manufacturers, you can create the 
product categories and products. Create and edit your products and categories via 
Catalog | Categories/Products.
Managing Categories
In order to add products to your store, you need at least one category. Create a 
category by clicking the new category button. Products must be placed inside 
categories. Otherwise, Zen Cart may experience various problems. For example, it 
may not display the products, or searches may not work. 
You can create multiple nested categories. For the new categories, you have to enter 
a name, description (in each active language), image to be uploaded for that category 
(or the filename of the image on the webserver), image upload directory, and sort 
order. To create a sub-category, click on the parent category and then click on the 
new category button.
 

Configuring the Store
[ 64 ]
To edit a category, click on the edit icon on the right of the row for that category. 
From the edit screen, you can restrict that category (including sub-categories) to only 
contain a certain product type. For example, if you have a category named books, 
you can restrict this category to the book product type only. Similarly, the music 
category can be restricted to the music product type only. Select the appropriate 
product type in the Restrict to Product Type drop-down list and click on Add 
include SubCategories or Add without SubCategories.
Each category may have multiple sub-categories, but it cannot contain both  
sub-categories and products. There is no restriction on the number of products 
or categories you can have in a category. Moreover, there is no restriction on the 
number of levels of subcategories. However, keep the nesting to a minimum for 
better management of the product catalog.
You can copy one category to another category and make it a sub-category. You can 
also delete a category, or a sub-category. Deleting a category does not automatically 
delete the products under it, but if the products lose their master category ID, 
they will no longer be shown in the catalog. Therefore, you must always move the 
products to another category before deleting their parent category.
 

Chapter 3
[ 65 ]
Managing Products
Once you have created all of the categories and know which products to be included 
in each category, you can start adding products to these categories. For helping 
catalogers, you can prepare a guideline for choosing the appropriate categories. 
Restricting categories to specific product types will also help.
To add a product to a category, click on that category's icon. If that category has a  
sub-category, you will not see the new product button. So, click on the subcategories, 
until you see a new product button. Then, select the appropriate product type and 
click on the new product button. The following figure shows how a product is added: 
 

Configuring the Store
[ 66 ]
Based on the product type you have chosen, you will have to provide specific 
information about that product. Typical information that you may need to provide 
includes: product name, manufacturer name, stock status, availability date, tax class, 
net and gross price, minimum and maximum order quantity, product description, 
quantity, model, product image, URL, shipping weight, and sort order. If you are 
adding a product of music product type, you need to provide music genre, recording 
company, recording artist, and so on. For book type products, you need to add 
author(s) name, edition, number of pages, publisher, sub-title, subject, format, 
publication date, and so on.
Before adding a product to the catalog, you must prepare images for that product. 
Images for product should be high-quality but, at the same time, small in size. 
Although Zen Cart displays images according to the configured size, do not use very 
large images as these will take more webserver space and more time to load. 
Products by Options/Attributes
You may sell products with options and attributes. For example, if you are selling  
T-shirts, you may offer four colors and four sizes S, M, L, and XL. For a change of 
color the price remains the same, but for a size change the price changes too. This 
type of product is appropriate for selling using attributes. We have to select Yes in 
the Product Priced by Attributes field while creating that product.
For using options and attributes with products, you have to create the options  
and values first, and then assign those option-value pairs to products through the 
attribute manager.
Option Name Manager
Before you can add attributes to your products in Catalog | Attributes Controller, 
you need to create option names and give them values wherever appropriate. 
Catalog | Option Name Manager allows us to view, edit, add, and delete  
option names.  
Follow these steps to create an option:
1.	 In the first text box, en: type the name of your attribute option. This should 
be informative as it will appear in your shop.
2.	 In the second box, Order: type the sort order that you want the attribute to 
appear under the product.
 

Chapter 3
[ 67 ]
3.	 In the drop-down box, select the type of attribute that you want. 
Dropdown box: Requires option values that you can set in  
Catalog | Option Value Manager.
Text: A text area box that does not require option values. 
Radio: A button that allows customers to select an option value. The 
customer can only select a single value from the available options. This 
requires option values.
Checkbox: A square box that allows customers to select an option value. 
The customer can select multiple values from the available options. This 
requires option values.
File: This type of attribute allows customers to upload files. File 
extensions can be set via Configuration | Maximum Values, in 
Allowed Filename Extensions. This attribute does not require  
option values.
Read only: These attributes are for display purposes only and are not 
part of a calculation. They also do not appear on the order page. It is an 
informational attribute that can be used with one or more products and 
then changed once to apply to all products to which the attribute has 
been assigned. However, this requires option values.
4.	 Click the insert button to save the option.
Once you have created an option, you can edit it by clicking edit next to the option 
name. Then, change the following settings:
Comments: Specify the text that your customers will see above your option 
name. Make this informative so that customers know what they need to 
enter. For example, if the option name is to upload a file, you can tell your 
customer the file extensions that are allowed.
Rows: The number of rows you want your input/text area box to have. 
Display Size: This is the size of the input/text area box your customers will 
see on the screen.
Maximum length: This is the maximum number of characters including 
spaces, that your customer will be able to type into the input/text area box. 
Attribute Images per Row: The number of images and option values that 
you would like on each row.

Attribute Style for Radio Buttons/Checkbox: If you choose your option as a 
radio box or checkbox, you can define how they will appear. The following 
number values can be used: 
0 = Images Below Option Names 
1 = Element, Image and Option Value 
2 = Element, Image and Option Name Below 
3 = Option Name Below Element (check box/radio button) 
and image 
4 = Element (check box/radio button) Below Image and 
Option Name 
5 = Element Above Image and Option Name 
Option Value Manager
Once you have defined the option name, you can add values to it via Catalog | 
Option Value Manager. You will see the list of option names, values, and sort 
orders. At the bottom of the list, select the option name from the drop-down  
list, and then enter the value into the en: text box, and specify the sort order in  
order textbox. Now, click on insert to save it. Add all the other values for the  
same option name. Now, your option-value pairs are ready to be added in the 
attributes controller.

Attributes Controller
Once you have added option names and values using Catalog | Option Name 
Manager and Catalog | Option Value Manager, you can add these options to 
products via Catalog | Attributes Controller. You can also start attribute controller 
from product list by clicking on attribute controller icon (
).
To add an attribute to a product, you must follow these steps:
1.	 Go to the large gray box titled Adding New Attributes.
2.	 Select the option name that you want to add from the first scroll box .
3.	 Select a matching option value from the second scroll box, for example, select 
option name Size [dropdown] from the first box and Small [SIZE:] from the 
second box. 
4.	 Click the insert button.
The price and weight of the product may vary depending on the product attributes. 
When adding attributes to a product, you can configure the price and weight changes. 
When selecting an option and a value, Price can be entered with a prefix of + (plus) 
or — (minus) or blank. '+' or blank means an increase, and '—' means a decrease. 
Generally, the price we enter here will be added to, or subtracted from, our base price 
based on the use of the + or — prefix. But when Price by Attribute is enabled, the 
price we enter here will be added to your base price regardless of the prefix. 
Weight can optionally be entered if it affects the product weight. You can use a prefix 
of '+' or '—' or blank. Using '+' and blank will add the attribute weight, while '—' will 
subtract the attribute weight, from the product's base weight.
You can also define quantity discounts. Quantity discounts (Attributes Qty Price 
Discount) are useful when the entire group of products being ordered has a different 
price depending on the quantity purchased. You can also specify the quantity 
discounts as: 1:11, 5:10.00, 8:9.00,10:8.00,15:7.00,20:6.00, 50:5.00.
This can be best expressed as shown in the following table:
Size XL 
QTY 
1 
2-5 
6-8 
9-10 
11-15 16-20 20+ 
PRICE $11.00 $10.00 $9.00 $8.00 $7.00 $6.00 $5.00 
As you can see, definition consists of a number of quantity:price pairs.  The first 
number in the pair is the minimum quantity that must be purchased, and the second 
number in the pair is the price that the customer will pay if they purchase (at least) 
that quantity. The quantity discount will be applied only to products with specific 
attributes (here, size XL).
 

Configuring the Store
[ 70 ]
One-time quantity discounts (Onetime Attributes Qty Price Discount) allow specific 
amounts to be applied to quantity discounts. For example, 400:5 will apply a one-
time charge of $5 to an order with any number of items less than 400. Negative 
numbers work in these entries as well, creating a quantity discount. This is useful if 
you define a base price and would like to allow the user to have the discount off  
the base price. 
Attribute flags
You can use flags for attributes to make these attributes special. These are used to 
define other features of the attribute, such as: 
Used For Display Purposes Only:  Some attributes may be used for display 
purposes only, and cannot be selected and added to cart. For example, you 
may have a blue color t-shirt, and the color it has been expressed through 
an attribute. You don't want to give the option to the customers to choose a 
color. In this case, you can set this attribute to be display only. 
Attribute is Free When product is Free: Select this to make the attribute free 
when the product is free. Otherwise, selecting the attribute will add the price 
to the free product.  
Default Attribute to be Marked Selected: Selecting this will set a default 
value for attribute. A default value needs to be selected.
Apply Discounts Used by Product Special/Sale: This will apply the same 
type of discount that the product is getting from the products' price against 
the special or sale price.
Include in Base Price When Priced by Attributes: When products are priced 
by attributes, selecting this flag will add the lowest-priced attribute to the 
base price of the product. 
Attribute Required for Text: This means that the customer must fill in this 
field before adding it to the cart.
Attribute Images 
Images can be attached to attributes. To add an image to each attribute, you can 
either type the filename of the image file into the Attributes Image Swatch text box, 
or click Browse and select the image from your computer. You also need to select 
the directory where the image will be uploaded. If you enter the filename, then you 
will need to upload it to your server yourself and select the No radio button under 
Overwrite Existing Image?. Click on the insert button to upload the image.

Downloadable Products as Attributes
You can set a product as downloadable, so that customers can download. To add 
the downloadable attribute to a product, enter in the filename of the file that will be 
downloaded. Then, type the number of days after which the download will expire, 
and the maximum number of downloads that can be made. Click insert to save  
the attribute.
Copying Attributes to Other Products or Categories 
One easy way to use attributes on a group of products is to copy the attributes from 
one product to another, or to every product in a category. The attribute images and 
any other attribute options for price or weight also get copied and can be edited  
once copied. 
At the top of the attributes controller are several self-explanatory buttons that link 
to other sections of the admin panel. The last two are both copy to—the first is to a 
product, the second to a category. 
Click copy to (product or category depending on our preference), and in the large 
scroll box choose the category or product to which you want to copy the selected 
product attributes. 
 

Configuring the Store
[ 72 ]
Then, you have three options:
1.	 Delete first, then copy new attributes: This will delete any existing 
attributes that are attached to the products to which you are copying the new 
attributes. New attributes are then added to the products.
2.	 Update with new attribute settings/prices, then add new ones: If the 
product you are copying to already has the same attributes, the values of 
those existing attributes will be updated. Then, the new attributes will be 
added to that product.
3.	 Ignore and add only new attributes: This will not alter any existing 
attributes, but will only add new ones.
You select one of the above options and click the copy button. You will then be 
notified about the success of copying the attributes. You can copy the attributes of 
the product to a category in similar way. In that case, the attributes will be applied to 
all of the products in that category.
Option Name and Value Sorter
Although, you can edit the sort order via Catalog | Option Name manager, it is 
easier to edit the sort order via Catalog | Option Name Sorter. You can then assign 
the sort order of each option and click on the Update Sort Order button to update 
the sort order. You need to do this for each language.
Similarly, you can manage option values easily via Catalog | Option Value Sorter.  
Select an option and click on edit to get the list of values for that option. Then enter the 
new sort orders and click on Update Sort Order button to update it.
Downloads Manager
Products for downloads can be managed via Catalog | Downloads Manager. You 
will see a list of all downloadable products, along with the associated product ID and 
name. You will also see the names of the files to be downloaded. A red icon in the 
Filename column indicates that the file is not on the webserver. A green icon means 
that the file is available on the webserver. For a red icon, upload the file to Zen Cart's 
download directory or, if the file is named differently, change the filename via the 
attribute controller. You can also do this by clicking on the edit button.
 

Chapter 3
[ 73 ]
Prices
The Catalog | Products Price Manager menu allows us to edit product pricing by 
category. You can change the price, availability date, in stock / out of stock setting, 
quantity minimum (qty min), quantity units (qty units), quantity maximum (qty 
max), quantity minimum, and unit mix (qty min/unit mix), and whether the product 
is free, call for price, or priced by attributes, all from the products price manager. 
You can also edit special product and featured product information from this screen.
Bulk Import/Export of Products
For building a catalogue, it will be useful if you could bulk import/export products 
from, the catalog. If you have an existing shop, then bulk import may help. Bulk 
export may help you when moving the catalog to another shop. It may also help if 
you want to build the catalog offline, and then upload it to the online shop. You may 
ask the manufacturers to send their catalog in a specified format and upload that to 
the webserver. By default, Zen Cart has no feature to bulk import/export products. 
However, some third party add-ons are available for this.
One of the easiest bulk import tools for Zen Cart is EasyPopulate by Langer  
(www.modhole.com). You can download it from the Zen Cart website's download 
section. Once downloaded, you just have to unzip it and upload the files, keeping  
the directory structure intact. EasyPopulate does not overwrite any core files. Apply 
the install_sql.sql file via Tools | Install SQL Patches. This will give you 
options for configuration. 
To configure Easy Populate, select Configuration | Easy Populate. You will see only 
one option to configure—Uploads Directory. The default is temp/. You change it 
to be any path you choose. You may create a directory named ep in the Zen Cart 
directory and enter the path of that directory in this field. Then all Easy Populate files 
will be created in this directory. You must also remember to set the file permission 
on this directory to 777.

After uploading the files and configuring the Upload Directory, select Tools | Easy 
Populate. Here, you will see some links to download and create Easy Populate 
and Froogle files. Click on the Download Complete tab-delimited .txt file to edit 
(Attributes Not Included) link. This will download a tab-delimited text file, which 
can be opened using Microsoft Excel or the OpenOffice.org Calc spreadsheet 
program. If you want to build your own catalog based on this file, you must only 
keep the header row and delete/overwrite all other rows. You should type only the 
necessary information in these rows and save it. Once the file is ready, select Tools 
| Easy Populate and click on browse to select the file to upload in the Upload EP 
file field. Then, click on the Insert into db button. New product information will be 
added to catalog. 
Similarly, you can download template for model/category, model/price/quantity, 
and prepare your file for uploading. In all of these cases, keep the header row intact. 
Otherwise, bulk import will not work.
Modules
Modules are functional add-ons for Zen Cart. You can have payment modules, 
shipping modules, or order total modules. Each type of module performs a different 
task for the shopping cart. For example, payment modules process payment through 
different payment gateways, while shipping modules are used to calculate shipping 
cost based on the destination and the carrier.
 

Chapter 3
[ 75 ]
Installing/Uninstalling Modules
Modules in Zen Cart are automatically added to the shopping cart system when you 
put the module files in the appropriate directories. All of the modules in Zen Cart are 
located in the includes/modules directory. Under this directory, there are at least 
three subdirectories: payment, shipping and order_total. Once we put the files 
in these directories, we will find the module listed in the respective configuration 
screens, that is, Modules | Payment, Modules | Shipping, or Modules | Order 
Total screen. When you select that module for the first time you will see the install 
button on the right. You can install the module by clicking on this button.
Payment Modules
Payment modules are for processing payment through a payment processing 
gateway. For example, you may use the Authorize.net payment module to receive 
payment through the Authorize.net gateway. By default, there are about nine 
payment modules installed. The functions and configuration of each payment 
module are described below:
Authorize.net
If you have an Authorize.net merchant account, you can use this payment gateway. 
You can accept credit cards and electronic checks through Authorize.net. You can 
create an account at www.authorize.net.
There are two modules for Authorize.net: Authorize.net SIM and Authorize.net  
AIM. Authorize.net AIM is the preferred method for connecting a shop to the 
Authorize.net Payment Gateway. AIM allows merchants to customize their own 
payment forms (the web page that collects the customer's payment information) 
and receipt page, as well as submit transactions over an end-to-end Secure Sockets 
Layer (SSL) connection. On the other hand, Authorize.net SIM is a Payment Gateway 
connection method that allows merchants to post transactions directly to the 
payment gateway's secure server and requires transaction-unique encryption for 
transaction authentication. SIM provides merchants with a hosted payment form and 
a hosted receipt page.
Install either of the two modules. Both modules need some configuration values. 
Let's see how to configure the Authorize.net AIM module.
For the Authorize.net AIM module, you have to configure the following values:
Enable Authorize.net Transaction (AIM) Module: If you want to process 
transactions through Authorize.net using the AIM method, select True.
Login ID: Type the login username for you Authorize.net account.

Transaction Key: A transaction key is used for encrypting transaction 
processing data. You can get this code from your Authorizenet  
Account | Security Settings | API Login ID and Transaction Key.
MD5 Hash: This will be encryption key used for validating received 
transaction data (MAX 20 CHARACTERS). This hash value needs to be set in 
Authorize.net admin section.
Transaction mode: Transaction mode can be set to Test or Production. You 
can use Test mode only for testing your configuration, but always keep it in 
the Production mode when your shop is live.
Authorization Type: If you want to authorize only the submitted credit 
card number, select Authorize only. Selecting Authorize + Capture will also 
record the credit card number.
Enable Database Storage: To save the gateway data in your database,  
select True.
Customer Notifications: If you select True in this field, for every transaction, 
Authorize.net will send a receipt to the customer.
Merchant Notifications: If you select True in this field, for any transaction, 
Authorize.Net will send a receipt to the merchant.
Request CVV Number: If you want customers to provide card's CVV 
number, select True in this field.
Sort Order of Display: Enter a sort order for displaying the Authorize.Net 
payment method. The lowest sort order will be displayed first.
Payment Zone: Certain payment methods may be applicable only for certain 
zones. For example, you may use Check/Money Order payment only inside 
your country. For each payment method, you can specify a Payment Zone 
from this drop-down list.
Set Completed Order Status: Here, you can select the order status upon 
successful transaction using this payment method. As authorize.Net is an 
online payment processor, you may set the order status to Processing.
Set Refunded Order Status: Here you set the status of refunded orders 
to this value. You can select either of the following: default, Pending[1], 
Processing[2], Delivered[3], or Update[4].
Debug Mode: Enable the debug mode as this will help us know why a 
transaction has failed. In this case, select Log only, or Log and Email. If 
you select Log and Email for each failed transaction, the debug info will be 
written into the log, and an email will be sent to the administrator.
Configuration of the Authorize.net SIM module is almost similar, but has fewer 
options. It has a different configuration option, Transaction Method, where you can 
define what you want to accept Credit Card or eCheck.

Credit Card
The Credit Card module is not for instant online payment. Instead, credit card 
information is collected through this module, and we can charge it to that credit card 
using our credit card processing terminal.
To use the Credit Card module, you click on this, and install it. Then, you click on 
edit to change the following options. Set Enable Credit Card Module, Collect & 
Store the CVV Number  to True, and select Store the Credit Card Number. Credit 
card numbers will be stored partially in the database. Then, you have to type an 
email address, usually the administrator's email address, to which part of the credit 
card number will be sent. You may keep Payment Zone blank. Set the Order Status 
field to Pending, as credit cards are not authorized instantly.
When customers use this module, they will provide their credit card information 
during check-out. You can see the order in Customers | Orders screen. If you click 
on that order, you will see the details. Their credit card numbers will be displayed, 
but with the middle eight digits masked with XXXXXXXX. 
Check your email for a message related to the order number that you have on 
your screen. You will find the blacked out eight digits in the email. Now, you can 
assemble the credit card number and enter it into your merchant terminal to process 
the credit card transaction. If the credit card purchase is approved by your merchant, 
you can mark the order status as Processing. It is better to add the authorization 
number to the Comments field before you save the new order status. Select the 
notify customer box to let the customer know that the payment has been approved. 
Finally, when you ship the order, you will update the order status to Delivered and 
notify customer again.
Customer credit card numbers are not allowed to be stored in a retrieval 
system. So, if you do store them, and your system is hacked and your 
customer's credit card info stolen and used fraudulently, you will be 
liable for all unauthorized purchases made using those credit cards. 
Hence, to protect yourself and your customers, the full numbers are not 
stored in Zen Cart, but are split up into two separate mechanisms for 
safety. However, if you have other payment methods, such as PayPal 
online payment, try to avoid using this simple credit card module.
Cash on Delivery
For some products, or in some areas, your payment option may be pay by cash when 
the product is delivered. As for Bangladesh, we have no online transaction facility. 
So cash on delivery may be a suitable payment method.
 

Configuring the Store
[ 78 ]
If you want to use this module, then click on it to install it. Then, change its 
configuration. It has very few options: enable the module, set the Payment Zone, 
Order Status and Sort order of display.
Zen Cart Free Charge Card
You may be wondering whether this really involves payment. Actually, this module 
is used when you do not have to pay for a product. When checking out a free 
product, this payment module will be used. If you have free products in your shop, 
you can install and enable this module.
LinkPoint/YourPay API
If you have a LinkPoint or YourPay account for online payment, you may use this 
module. If you have no account at LinkPoint or YouPay, simply click on the link 
provided on the right side box to Sign Up for an account.
Before installing this module, check that your system fulfills all of the requirements. 
You should have CURL enabled to be able to use this module. You also need to have 
Port 1129 to be configured for bidirectional communication, and a PEM RSA Key 
digital certificate. Instructions for getting this key are given in the box on the right most 
side of the screen:
1.	 First, install the module and enable it. 
2.	 Then, type your LinkPoint/YouPay merchant ID.
 

Chapter 3
[ 79 ]
3.	 Select LinkPoint Transaction Mode as LIVE:Production, TESTING:
Successful or TESTING:Decline. This must be LIVE:Production for  
live shops.
4.	 In the Authorization Type field, select either Authorize only, or Immediate 
Charge/Capture. 
5.	 Then, select Order Status, Payment Zone, Sort Order. 
6.	 If you want to be notified of any fraudulent credit card activity by email, 
select Yes in the Fraud Alerts field. 
7.	 Select True in Enable Database Storage field to store logs of all credit card 
activities. It is a good idea to log all credit card activities into the database, so 
that you can analyze this log in case of any fraudulent activity. 
Cheque/Money Order
If you want to allow payment via Cheques and Money Order, install and enable this 
module. The configuration is simple. Set the Payment Zone, Order Status and Sort 
Order. Then, type the name of the person to whom the cheque or money order will 
be issued. The store address will automatically be shown as the address to which the 
money order or cheque will be sent to. As you do not receive the cheque or the money 
order instantly, set the order status to Pending. When you receive the cheque or 
money order, change the order status and notify the customer. It is better to record the 
cheque number in the comments field when you update the order status.
PayPal
If you are starting an online shop, you may already know about PayPal. PayPal is 
a popular online transaction network through which you can pay to other PayPal 
account holders and others with your credit cards. It supports major credit cards and 
several types of accounts. For more information, you can visit www.paypal.com. If you 
don't have a PayPal account, you can create one to start accepting PayPal at your store.
By default, you will get three PayPal modules installed in Zen Cart: PayPal  
IPN-Websites Payments Standard, PayPal Website Payments Pro, and PayPal 
Express Checkout. Either can be used depending on your PayPal account type. The 
following sections describe the configuration of these two modules.
PayPal IPN Websites Payments Standard
The PayPal IPN module is the easiest way to use PayPal for your site. Instant 
Payment Notification (IPN) is PayPal's interface for handling real-time purchase 
confirmation and server-to-server communications. Whenever a transaction occurs, 
IPN delivers immediate notification and confirmation of PayPal payments, and 
provides the status and additional data on pending, cancelled, or failed transactions.
 

Configuring the Store
[ 80 ]
Checkout using the PayPal IPN module consists of the following six steps: 
1.	 Customers select the products they want to purchase and choose to pay  
with PayPal. 
2.	 Customers are transferred to PayPal's secure site via an HTML redirect.
3.	 Customers log in to their account and review their shipping and billing 
information. Customers then click Pay to make their payment, which is 
processed instantly.
4.	 Customers review their payment confirmation at PayPal.
5.	 Customers are automatically redirected back to your site via an HTML redirect.
6.	 Customers arrive at the order confirmation screen on your website. Shop 
owners are notified of a successful payment via email, Instant Payment 
Notification, or Payment Data Transfer.
Note that payment information, PayPal account and credit card, are entered on 
PayPal's site, not on your shop's checkout page. PayPal just notifies you whether the 
transaction has been successful or not. The transaction amount automatically goes to 
your PayPal account.
To use the PayPal IPN module, install and enable it from the Modules | Payment 
screen. If you don't have a PayPal account, create one and configure your profile. In 
the profile settings, type http://www.yourdomain.com/shop/ipn_main_handler.
php as Instant Payment Notification Preferences URL, and in the Automatic Return 
URL field under Website Payments Preferences, type http://www.yourdomain.
com/shop/index.php?main_page=checkout_process. These URLs will be shown 
in the box on the rightmost side of the screen, when you click on the module.
You have to configure the following options for your PayPal IPN module:
Enable PayPal Module:  Here, select True to enable and use this module.
Business ID: Here, type your PayPal account's primary email address. Check 
with your PayPal account if you have any doubts about the email addresses 
used for the account.
PDT Token (Payment Data Transfer): Enter your PDT Token value here to 
activate transactions immediately after processing (if they pass validation). 
You will get a token when you enable Payment Data Transfer under Website 
Transaction Preferences in your PayPal Profile.
Transaction Currency: Here, select the currency that you want to use 
with PayPal. If an unsupported currency format is sent to PayPal, it will 
automatically be converted into USD.
Payment Zone: Here, select the payment zone in which this module can be 
used. You can leave it blank to make it available in all zones.

Set Pending Notification Status: Here, select the order status for the pending 
transactions. The default is Pending.
Set Order Status: Here, select the order status of a successful PayPal 
transaction. The default is Processing, and it is fine to leave this as it is.
Set Refund Order Status: Here, select the order status for a refund request. 
The default is Pending, and it is fine to leave this as it is.
Sort Order of Display: Here, enter a number for the display order of the 
module in the checkout's payment options list. An option with a lower value 
will be placed first.
Page Style: If you have created a custom page style in your PayPal account 
profile, then type the name of that page style in this field. If you would like 
to always reference your Primary style, set it to primary. If you would like to 
reference the default PayPal page style, then set this to paypal.
Mode for PayPal web services: Here, specify the paypal processing URL. 
The default is www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr. Alternatively, you can use 
www.paypal.com/us/cgi-bin/webscr for the US and www.paypal.com/uk/
cgi-bin/webscr for the UK.
Debug Mode: Here, enable debug mode to collect information about failed 
transactions. You may choose Off, Log or Log and Email. Transaction logs 
are written in the /includes/modules/payment/paypal/logs file.
Once these options are configured, click on the update button to save the settings. 
Now, customers will see the PayPal IPN payment option during checkout. When 
they select this option, they are redirected to the PayPal page, where they can pay 
from their PayPal account or credit cards. When the transaction is successful, they 
will be redirected to the page specified in Automatic Return URL (that is, the 
checkout page of our shop).
PayPal Express
We may use the PayPal Express module to enable the PayPal express checkout. 
Express Checkout allows customers to complete transactions in very few steps. It 
allows them to use shipping and billing information stored securely in PayPal to 
check out, so that they don't have to re-enter it on our site. 
Express checkout works in the following way:
After selecting the products to purchase, customers click Checkout with 
PayPal on our website.
They are transferred to PayPal, where they select their payment method, as 
well as the correct shipping and billing address. Then, they are returned to 
your website to complete their purchases.

PayPal automatically gives you the shipping address, email, and other 
customer information needed to fulfill your order.
With Express Checkout, your buyers finish their orders on your website, and not on 
PayPal's. So, you can get real-time notification of successful payments.
To use PayPal Express Checkout, install and enable this module. This module 
requires PayPal API credentials and CURL enabled on your server. First, request an 
API key in your PayPal profile and keep the credentials at hand, and then check that 
CURL is enabled on your server. If your server uses a CURL proxy, get that proxy 
address. Also ensure that the IPN is enabled, and the IPN URL is provided in your 
PayPal profile.
In addition to the settings for the PayPal IPN module, the following are needed for 
PayPal Express module:
Express Checkout: Require Confirmed Address: If you want customers to 
provide a confirmed address for shipping, select Yes in this field.
Express Checkout: Select Cheapest Shipping Automatically: To make the 
checkout process faster, you may want to automatically select the cheapest 
shipping method when the customer returns from PayPal, and thus skip the 
shipping page. To do this, select Yes. 
Express Checkout: Skip Payment Page: You may want to skip the checkout 
payment page when the customer is checking out with Express Checkout. 
Select Yes if you do not want to display the payment page. Note that 
enabling this will not give the customers options to use their coupons or gift 
certificates, as the Payment Page will be skipped.
Payment Action: Here, select the Final Payment in order to get the payment 
at the end of the transaction. Alternatively, you can select Auth only to 
receive payments upon authorization only. The default is Final Payment.
API Signature—Username: Enter the API Username from your PayPal API 
Signature settings under API Access. This value typically looks like an email 
address and is case-sensitive.
API Signature—Password: Here, enter the API Password from your PayPal 
API Signature settings under API Access. This value is a 16-character code, 
and is case-sensitive.
API Signature—Signature Code: Here, enter API Signature from your 
PayPal API Signature settings under API Access. This value is a 56-character 
code, and is case-sensitive.
Live or Sandbox: If you are using the module for testing purposes, select 
Sandbox. But for live shops, to receive payment through PayPal, you must 
select Live.

PayPal Website Payments Pro
You can also use PayPal Website Payment Pro module for processing payment in 
Zen Cart. Website Payments Pro module gives some extra benefits than other two 
PayPal modules. However, for using this module you must have PayPal Express 
Checkout module installed and configured. Most of the configuration options are 
same as other two modules. Only new setting you have to configure in this module is 
PayPal Mode. This setting has the following options:
•	
PayPal: If you have US Paypal account and want to use  that for Website 
Payments Pro service, select this option. However, for using this you must 
have configured API Settings in PayPal Express Checkout module.
•	
Payflow-UK: This option will allow you to use Payflow-UK payment 
processing gateway. You need a Payflow-UK account for using this option.
•	
Payflow-US: For using Payflow-US payment processing gateway, select this 
option. You need a Payflow-US account for using this option.

Other Payment Modules
There are a lot of payment modules that can be downloaded from the Zen Cart 
website and used for processing payments using other payment processor gateways. 
The configurations differ depending upon the gateways used. Here, you are going to 
learn about two popular payment modules that you may like to use for your shop.
WorldPay
WorldPay is a popular payment processor for online merchants. We can use 
WorldPay as payment processor by adding the third-party module, WorldPay 
for Zen Cart 1.3.x, available from the Zen Cart website's downloads section. After 
downloading the package, extract it and copy the files to your web server's Zen Cart 
directory, maintaining folder structure.

section, unzip it, and upload all files. No file will be overwritten by this  
payment module. 
Once the upload is complete, go to Modules | Payment. You will see the 
MoneyBooker listed as an available payment module. Install it and click edit to 
configure it. First, enable this payment method, provide the email address used for 
your MoneyBooker account, select Transaction Currency, Payment Zone, Set Order 
Status, and set Sort Order of Display. Your MoneyBooker payment module is now 
ready for use.
During checkout, the moneybooker.com payment option will be shown. On 
confirming the order, the customer will be redirected to the moneybooker.com site. 
The customer needs to log in to moneybooker.com using his or her account name and 
password, and make payment from his or her balance at moneybooker.com.

Shipping Modules
Shipping is one of the important features of your online shop. You have to give 
customers a choice of shipping options. Several modules are used to provide 
shipping options to the customers. Shipping modules are administered from the 
Modules | Shipping screen. 
Flat Rate
A flat rate shipping charge is simple to use and is the most straight-forward method. 
If you use flat rate shipping for all products, you charge the same shipping fee. To 
use a flat rate for shipping, enable this module and enter the shipping cost for all 
orders in the Shipping cost field. You may also define the Tax Class, Tax Basis, 
Shipping Zone, and Sort Order for this module.
Free shipping
Here, you can use the FREE SHIPPING! (freeshipper) and Free Shipping Options 
(freeoptions) modules if you want to offer free shipping for some or all products. In 
this case, you have to enable these modules and configure both the modules.
Free Options is used to display a Free Shipping option when other shipping 
modules are displayed. It can be based on: Always show, Order Total, Order Weight, 
or Order Item Count. For example, you may offer free shipping for an order of more 
than USD 200. However, the Free Options module will not be shown when Free 
Shipper is displayed.
 

Chapter 3
[ 91 ]
Setting Total to >= 0.00 and <= nothing (leave blank) will activate this module to 
show with all shipping modules, except for Free Shipping. Leaving all settings for 
Total, Weight and Item Count blank will deactivate this module.
Free Shipping Options do not get displayed if Free Shipping is used, based on zero 
weight for Free Shipping. In Free Shipping Options configuration, you can define the 
total order, weight, and item count for which free shipping will be applicable, and 
the minimum cost and handling fee for free shipping.
The Free Shipping option is shown when a product is always shipped for free. But 
conditional free shipping, that is, for purchases above a total price or size, and so on, 
is handled by the Free Shipping Options module. If you have some products marked 
for free shipping, enable the Free Shipping module, and specify the minimum 
shipping and handling charges when free shipping is used. 
You may be wondering when to configure the Free Shipping Options and 
Free Shipping modules. Here, you have to specify the shipping charge 
and handling charges. If you charge for this, then it is not completely free 
shipping. So, remember that free shipping does not always mean absolutely 
FREE! You may need to pay something for Free Shipping!
Per Item and Per Unit
Depending on your products, you may choose either per item, or per unit shipping 
costs. For example, for each shipping box you may charge USD 2.50, and for each 
book in your store, you may charge USD 1.00. These types of shipping are handled 
by the Per Item and Per Unit modules.
The main configuration for the Per Item shipping module is Shipping Cost per 
Item. Specify a cost here. When calculating the total shipping cost, this amount will 
be multiplied by the number of items in the order. In addition to per item costs, 
you may also specify a handling cost per shipping method. Then, the total cost of 
shipping will be:
Total Shipping Cost = (No. of Items × per item shipping cost) + Handling fee
If you ship your products in a box or other package, you may use the Per Unit 
shipping module. Similarly, you have to configure the per unit shipping cost and 
the handling fee. When using the per unit shipping method, you need to specify the 
shipping unit (box, packet) when adding a product to the catalog. Otherwise, this 
module cannot calculate the shipping cost.
 

Configuring the Store
[ 92 ]
Store Pickup
Store Pickup is a shipping method wherein the store owner does not ship the 
products to the customer. Instead, the customer visits the physical store and picks 
up the products. This may sound good, and you may think that there is no cost 
involved, but, you may also charge a nominal fee for packaging the products. In fact, 
for the Store Pickup module you can configure this fee in the Shipping Cost field. 
Configuring Shipping Zone is important for this module as you cannot provide 
store pickup options for customers all over the world. For example, if your shop is 
in Bangladesh and you provide the store pickup option to customers in America, it 
would be weird!
Table Rate
You may calculate the shipping cost from a cost table where you can see the total 
price or the weight and determine the shipping cost. If you know the shipping cost 
for a region by weight, you can use the Table Rate module. In this module, you have 
to build a table for weight: cost or price:cost. In the Shipping Table field, you can 
provide shipping cost based on total cost, weight, or the number of items. This is 
denoted as 10:2.5, 20:4.5, and so on. In the Table Method, select the criteria on which 
you are calculating the cost—weight, price or items. If you select weight, then 10:2.5 
means for 10 Kg you are charging USD 2.5; if you select price then 10:2.5 would 
mean that for every USD 10.00 spent, the shipping charge is USD 2.50; and when you 
select items, 10:2.5 means mean you will charge USD 2.5 per 10 purchased.
United Parcel Service
United Parcel Service (UPS) is a reputed worldwide parcel delivery service. You may 
like to use UPS as a shipping method. To use the UPS shipping method, install and 
enable the United Parcel Service shipping module and configure the following:
UPS Pickup Method: Specify how your packages will be handed over to 
UPS. You may take them to a UPS Customer Counter (CC), tell UPS to 
regularly pick the packages up from your store (RDP), ask for UPS to make 
a one-time pickup (OTP), send the packages to a letter centre (LC) or use 
On Call Air (OCA). You have to type the code, as indicated, for the different 
pickup methods.
UPS Packaging?: Specify the type of packaging that will be used for your 
parcel. You may use your own packaging (CP) or UPS packaging such as 
UPS Letter (ULE), UPS Tube (UTE), UPS Express Box (UBE). Enter the 
codes in this field.

Chapter 3
[ 93 ]
Residential Delivery?: Indicate whether the delivery will be Residential 
(RES) or Commercial (COM). As you are normally shipping to individual 
customers, Residential delivery is recommended.
Shipping Methods: Choose the shipping methods to be used by UPS. A brief 
explanation of all methods are available on the page for this module in Zen 
Cart. For more information you may check the UPS website at www.ups.com.
You can also configure other generic options such as Shipping Zone, Handling Fee, 
Tax Class and Tax Basis.
United States Postal Service
You can use the United States Postal Service (USPS) for shipping your products. Zen 
Cart has a built-in USPS shipping module, which can be installed and configured for 
this purpose. Before using this module, you need to register at www.usps.com for a  
USPS web tools User ID. Install and enable this module and configure the  
following options:
Enable USPS Shipping: Do you want to offer USPS shipping? You have two 
options here: select True in order to enable it, or select False to disable it.
USPS Web Tools User ID: Enter the Web Tools user ID that you have 
received from USPS after registration.
Which server to use: Initially, you should use the testing server. Once you 
are satisfied that it is working, set it to production. It must be production 
for live shops. But before setting it to production, you have to mail to 
icustomercare@usps.com to activate it for the Production server. Once you 
have received a confirmation email from USPS, you can set this option to the 
Production server.
All Packages are machinable: Here, specify whether all packages will 
be considered machinable (processable by a machine - for example with 
a barcoded ZIP code on the address label). Machinable packages have 
lower charges. But packages more than 35 lbs or less than 6 ounces will 
automatically be considered as non-machinable.
USPS Options: Select the information that will be shown in the USPS 
shipping option during checkout. It may show the weight and transit time, 
along with the shipping cost.  
Domestic Shipping Methods: Select the domestic services that will be used. 
Options available are: Express, Priority, First Class, Parcel Media, BPM,  
and Library.

International Shipping Methods: Select the international shipping methods 
that will be used. Available options are: Global Express, Global Express 
Non-Doc Rect, Global Express Non-Doc Non-Rect, Express Mail Int, 
Express Mail Int Flat Rate Env, Priority Mail International, Priority Mail 
Int Flat Rate Env, Priority Mail Int Flat Rate Box, and First-Class Mail Int.
Debug Mode: Turn the debug mode on to have a complete detailed log of 
USPS quote results emailed to the store owner.
You can also configure other generic options, such as Shipping Zone, Handling Fee, 
Tax Class, and Tax Basis.
Zone Rates
You may use one shipping rate for each zone. Although Table Rate allows us to apply 
a rate table for a specific zone, you can use multiple zones by using Zone Rates. First, 
you have to define which countries are in which zones. Then, define the shipping rates 
for each zone. The rates may be based on weight, price, or number of items.
As with the Table Rate shipping method, you have to indicate, in the Calculation 
Method field, the basis on which shipping cost will be calculated. Then, define Zone 
1, Zone 2, and Zone 3 countries by entering the two-letter ISO codes for the countries 
that are to be assigned to each zone, separated by commas (,).  Type the rates in Zone 
1 Shipping Table, Zone 2 Shipping Table and Zone 3 Shipping Table field. The rates 
should be in the format: 10:2.5, 15:4.5, 20:6.5, and so on. If you select weight as a 
calculation method, then an entry of 10:2.5 in the Zone 1 Shipping Table means that 
for Zone 1 Countries, customers have to pay 2.5 USD per 10 Kg weight. For each 
zone, you can also specify a handling fee.
Order Total Modules
Order Total modules are used to calculate the total cost due during checkout. You 
can see the list of Order Total modules on the Modules | Order Total screen. These 
modules are located in the includes/modules/order_total/ directory. The 
following list shows the default Order Total modules:
COD Fee: If you want to enable Cash on Delivery as a payment option, then 
you may also charge a fee for using this payment method. The COD Fee  
(ot_cod_fee) module will add this COD fee to the subtotal of the product 
prices during checkout. You have to specify the COD fee for each shipping 
method used.

Discount Coupon: If a customer is using a discount coupon, this module's 
task is to deduct the discount coupon amount from the total amount due. In 
other words, this module actually provides the discounts to the customers. 
Here you have to configure how the discount will be granted. If you want 
to give a discount on total including shipping cost, select true in the Include 
Shipping field. If you want to give a discount on the total including tax, then 
select true in Include Tax field. Specify how to recalculate the tax. The three 
options available are None, Standard, and Credit Note.
Group Discount: This module deducts group discounts for eligible customers. 
Settings for this module are the same as for the Discount Coupon module.
Gift Certificates: This module is used to redeem gift certificates and allow 
gift certificates as a payment option. During checkout, payments made by 
gift certificates are deducted by this module. Settings for this module are the 
same as for the Discount Coupon module.
Low Order Fee: If the order amount is lower than a threshold value, then you 
may charge a low order fee. This module adds the low order fee to the order 
total. To charge a low order fee, enable low order fee through this module 
and specify the threshold value below which the low order will be charged. 
Also, specify the value of the low order fee in the Order Fee field. You can 
specify the fee as a percentage of the order total, or as an absolute amount. 
You may exempt the low order fee for the national orders, international 
orders, gift vouchers, or virtual products, individually.
Shipping: This module adds shipping cost to the order total. In the settings 
for this module, you can enable free shipping. Select true in the Allow Free 
Shipping field and specify the order amount over which an order will be 
eligible for free shipping. You can also enable free shipping for national, 
international, or both types of orders.
Sub-Total: This module shows the order sub-total, based on what discounts 
or other charges have to be applied. You need to simply enable this module; 
there is no option to configure.
Tax: This module adds taxes to order sub-total, to calculate the order total. 
You need to simply enable this module; there is no option to configure.
Total: This module calculates the total amount to be paid for the order. It 
must be enabled, and it has no configuration options.

These are the default Order Total modules. If you install other modules, you may 
find some other order total module in the Modules | Order Total screen. For 
example, installing Better Together module (which we will discuss in Chapter 6) will 
show the Better Together Discount moduel in this list.
Customers
Managing customers will be one of your tasks as a shop owner or administrator 
of Zen Cart. Customer Management includes customer registration, retrieval of 
forgotten passwords, informing customers about site update or maintenance, or any 
other important issues.
Registration/Authentication of Customers
Generally, users need to register with the Zen Cart shop before shopping. An 
unregistered customer may add items to the shopping cart, but before checking out, 
he or she needs to register. A customer can always register by clicking on the Log In 
link on the home page. You may specify the required fields for user registration via 
Configuration | Customer Details.
Once registered, a confirmation email containing a verification code is sent to the 
customer. The customer clicks on the link provided to visit your shop and enter the 
verification code. This way, the customer is verified. Once a customer is verified, he 
or she can place orders in the shop.
Customers can retrieve their forgotten password by clicking on the Forgot your 
password? link on the Login page. Administrators can change customer information 
(but not the password) on the Customers | Customers screen. 
 

Chapter 3
[ 97 ]
Managing Customers
All customer accounts are listed on the Customers | Customers screen. Select a 
customer name and you will see some command buttons in the right side box. 
Click on edit to change a customer's information. Although you can change any 
information in the customer's profile, it is not wise to change their address or other 
personal information. However, you may change the customer's authorization status, 
if you need to disable a customer for some reason.
We can see a customer's orders by clicking the orders button. A summary of the 
customer's activities will be shown in the right-side box.
Communicating with Customers
You may need to communicate with the customers to clarify some order, items or 
any other reason. In this case, select that customer and click on the email button 
shown in the right-side box. E-mail screen will be shown, where you can type the 
email subject and message, and can send it by clicking on the send button. From this 
screen you can also send mails to a group of customers.

Order Fulfilment and Inventory
After opening the shop in production, your main task will be to manage orders and 
fulfill these in a timely manner. You can see the list of all orders on the Customers | 
Orders screen. From this screen, you can edit or delete an order, or print invoice and 
packing slip for that order.
Order Statistics
Order statistics can be seen from dashboard. In the orders section, you can see 
the order status, which shows the pending orders, orders being processed, orders 
delivered, and orders that have been updated. In the new orders section, you will 
find all new orders. The list of products sold can be seen on the Reports | Products 
Purchased screen.
Managing Inventory
Managing inventory includes knowing the stock levels of all products and adding 
products to the catalog as and when necessary. You can identify products with low 
stock from the Reports | Products Low Stock screen. The screen will show the 
products that need immediate repletion.

Group Pricing
Group pricing can be used to provide a discount to a group of customers. You can 
manage group pricings from Customers | Group Pricing. To create a new group 
price, click on the insert button. Enter a group name and a discount percentage. Save 
the group. Now add customers to that group by editing the customer's profiles. From 
the Customers | Customers screen, select a customer and click on the edit button. In 
the options section, select the appropriate group in Discount Pricing Group field. 
Order Status
You need to update the order status manually. When an order is shipped or delivered, 
you need to change the order status. For managing an order, select that order from 
the list and click on the edit button. Now, change the Status field, for example, to 
Processing. You can also add a comment and select the Notify Customer and Append 
Comments checkboxes. You click on the update button to update the status. An email 
will be sent to the customer notifying them of the status of this order. When you have 
shipped the product, update the status to Shipped, and notify the customer. Again, 
you will need to update the status when the product is delivered.
 

Configuring the Store

When shipping products, you need to enclose an invoice. This invoice can be 
generated by clicking on the invoice button. You can also generate a packing slip by 
clicking on the packing slip button. The difference between an invoice and a packing 
slip is that the invoice includes the prices of the products, whereas a packing slip 
only lists the products.
Summary
In this chapter, we have discussed different configuration options for Zen Cart shop. 
First, we learned how to set global configuration options from the Configuration 
menu in the Administration area. Then we discussed the configuration of the 
available modules. We also learned how to enable and configure online payment 
methods using payment modules. Further, we discussed configuration of our shop 
for using several shipping methods, including Universal Parcel Service and the 
United States Postal Service. The use of Order Totals modules was also discussed. 
After examining how to configure these, we learned how to manage the product 
catalog by maintaining categories, products, and attributes. We are now also familiar 
with customer and order management. With all of this information, we now know 
how to configure a Zen Cart store.
Although we have learned how to configure the store, we have still not configured 
the look and feel of the store. In the next chapter, we are going to learn about 
customizing the look and feel of a Zen Cart store.
 

Customizing Look and Feel
One of the good features of Zen Cart is that, with some knowledge in HTML, 
CSS, and PHP, users can customize its look and feel. As an administrator, you 
can customize its look and feel through the administration panel. But for further 
customization and matching it to your own style, you need to edit template files. 
This chapter is going to show you how to customize the look and feel of a  
Zen Cart shop.
On completion of this chapter, you will be able to:
Configure the look and feel through the administration panel
Apply different templates to your Zen Cart store
Change the texts and graphics displayed in the store front-end
Customize the look and feel by editing files
Understand the override system
Modify templates to suit your needs
Create new templates for the front-end
Modify templates for sending mails to customers
Each of these topics will be discussed to enable you to perform the tasks of 
customizing the look and feel of your store.
Configuring Look and Feel 
Zen Cart templates define the look and feel of the store through different graphics, 
colors, and fonts. By default, only the Classic template is shipped with Zen Cart 
version 1.3.8.x. However, you have the liberty to download and install new 
templates from the Internet and also develop your own look and feel of a Zen Cart 
store and configure it through the administration panel.

Zen Cart provides great design flexibility. You can see the design showcase on the 
Zen Cart website www.zen-cart.com. The website lists Zen Cart shops throughout 
the world. Visiting these shops will give you an idea about the extent to which you 
can change the design of a Zen Cart shop.
You can download lots of templates from the Zen Cart website:  
www.zen-cart.com. There are some other sites from which  
you can download Zen Cart templates, free of charge.  
http://www.zencarttemplates.info allows us to preview  
and download free templates. However, professional looking Zen Cart 
templates are also available from some other template stores such as  
www.templatemonster.com. You can use Google to find  
such templates.
For the exercise in this book, you are going to design a template that  
will look like www.packtpub.com. You will use the same logo and 
design scheme.
Zen Cart templates reside in the /includes/templates directory. Before applying 
any template, you need to copy the template files to the /includes/templates 
directory under your Zen Cart installation root directory.
To start building your customized template, copy the /includes/templates/
classic folder to a new folder of /includes/templates/packt. Now, open the 
/includes/templates/packt/template_info.php file in your favorite text editor 
and change it as follows:
$template_name = 'PACKT Publishing';
$template_version = 'Version 1.0';
$template_author = 'Suhreed Sarkar (c) 2008';
$template_description = 'This template set is designed for packtpub.
com, as an illustartion of Zen Cart template design procedures.';
$template_screenshot = 'scr_template_packt.jpg';
Save the file when you have made these changes. Now, your template is ready for 
use in your Zen Cart shop.

[ 103 ]
Note that the template is not complete yet. You have only created a 
skeleton. While going through the following sections, you will gradually 
customize this template.
Applying a Template 
Generally, you need to set the template for each language. You can change the 
template used by your shop via Tools | Template Selection in the administration 
panel. The screen lists the installed templates. The template in use is selected  
by default. 
To change the template for a language, click on that language. Then, you see a  
right-arrow in the action column for that language. On the right, information  
about the selected template is shown. To apply the template, click on the edit button,  
select the template of your choice from the drop-down list, and then click on the 
update button.
 

Customizing Look and Feel
[ 104 ]
To apply your newly created template, select PACKT Publishing from the  
drop-down list, and click update. Your new template will be applied. As you  
have still not changed much in the template, it will look similar to the previous, 
classic, template.
If the language for which you want to assign a template, is not available in the list, 
click on the New Language button. Then, select the template name and language 
from the drop-down list. If the preferred language is not available in the drop-down 
list, you will need to add it via Localization | Languages.
Any template that you have copied to the includes/templates/ 
directory is generally displayed in the drop-down list accessible via  
Tools | Template Selection. If the template is not displayed in the  
drop-down list, it means that something is wrong with the template files. 
Check that all of the files have been copied to the templates directory, and 
ensure that the template_info.php file is in that template directory.
Controlling Layouts
A Zen Cart shop layout consists of left and right column sideboxes, a header, a 
footer, and the main content in the middle column. You can define which sideboxes 
will be shown where. You can also choose the width of the left and right column 
sideboxes. The following sections will show us how to do this.
Layout Settings
A wide variety of layout settings can be defined via Configuration | Layout 
Settings. The screen provides an array of configuration options for defining the 
column widths and other layout characteristics.
 

Chapter 4
[ 105 ]
The column width for the left and right boxes can be defined in the Column Width 
– Left Boxes and Column Width – Right Boxes fields respectively. The default width 
of these boxes is 150px. You can extend this setting to whatever width you prefer, for 
example 200px, based on the availability of screen space.
Breadcrumbs (showing our current location) status can be specified in the Define 
Breadcrumb Status field. Although the default value is 1, you may set this value to 2, 
which will show the breadcrumb on all pages except the homepage. In fact, showing 
Home on the homepage looks odd, so this should be turned off for the homepage. 
You can also set the breadcrumb separator in the Bread Crumbs Navigation 
Separator field.
You can hide the left or right column by setting the Column Left Status – Global 
and Column Right Status – Global fields to 0.
If you want to show the categories on the homepage, you must change the 
Categories - Always Show on Main Page field's value to 1. To speed up the page 
loading, you may also be tempted to use CSS buttons, instead of gif or jpg image 
buttons, to speed up the page loading. Set the CSS Buttons field's value to Yes to use 
the CSS buttons. 
 

Customizing Look and Feel
[ 106 ]
Showing/Hiding Sideboxes
The layout of the store front-end can be defined via Tools | Layout Box Controller. 
Clicking on this, you will see the boxes and names of the files that can be assigned to 
the left, right or center position in the front-end.
Sideboxes are generally located in the includes/modules/sideboxes directory. 
All the files in this directory will be shown in the Tools | Layout Boxes Controller 
screen. You will find five fields to the right of each sidebox. You can change the value 
of these fields by selecting the sidebox and then clicking on the edit button to the 
right of the fields. 
 

Chapter 4
[ 107 ]
The configuration options are available for each sidebox:
Left/Right Column Status: If you need to show a sidebox in the left or right 
column on the store front-end, select ON in this field. It is displayed on the 
left or right column, as you indicate in the Location field. 
Location: Once the Left/Right Column Status is indicated here, you have to 
indicate the column in which you would want to show the sidebox, whether 
left or right. For sideboxes with the Single Column Status ON, this selection 
will not be effective.
Left/Right Column Sort Order: This field indicates the order in which 
the sideboxes will be shown in the left or the right column. A lower value 
indicates a position nearer the top, and a higher value moves it down.
Single Column Sort order: This field indicates the order of the Single 
Column sideboxes. A lower value puts the sidebox nearer the top.
Single Column Status: If you want to show a sidebox in the center column, 
you select ON in this field. 
You can customize the location and order of the sideboxes through this screen. You 
can also hide or show the sideboxes in the left and right columns from here.

Customizing Look and Feel
[ 108 ]
Another way of hiding some sideboxes from a page is to edit the page's template file. 
For example, if you want to hide the right column sideboxes on the Privacy Policy 
page, follow the instructions given here:
1.	 Open the file includes/templates/template_default/common/ 
tpl_main_page.php in your favorite text editor.
2.	 Find the line which reads as:
if (in_array($current_page_base,explode(",",'list_pages_to_skip_
all_right_sideboxes_on_here,separated_by_commas,and_no_spaces')) ) 
{
    $flag_disable_right = true;
        }
3.	 Change the above line to:
if (in_array($current_page_base,explode(",",'privacy, 
  contact_us,shippinginfo')) ) {
    $flag_disable_right = true;
  }
Note that the names of three pages have been entered here. For these pages, 
the right column sideboxes will not be shown. You can add more page names 
here separating them with a comma (,).
4.	 Save the file as includes/templates/packt/common/tpl_main_page.php.
5.	 Open your browser and point it to http://yourdomain.com/index.
php?main_page=privacy. The page will now look like the  
following screenshot:
 

Chapter 4
[ 109 ]
Understanding Zen Cart Templates
Designing a template for the first time is not an easy job. But once you have 
understood the basics and worked out some hacks, the process will be much easier. 
Getting to understand the logic behind Zen Cart templates is the first step towards 
developing templates for Zen Cart.
A Zen Cart template consists of a set of PHP files containing HTML and PHP codes. 
Each page consists of a header, a footer and sideboxes. While you are designing any 
page or module, you should keep in mind where you are going to show that page  
or module.
Whereas HTML and PHP codes give the structure of the page, CSS styles control the 
presentation of the page components. You need to edit the respective CSS to get the 
appropriate look and feel of a page. 
While tweaking the Zen Cart template, you will often have to change the layouts 
and try them on the local server. Upload the tweaked or new template files to the 
production server only when you are fully satisfied with their output.
Remember how Zen Cart handles images. There are two ways of inserting 
images into the page output. You can use a relative path to the images 
directory, or use PHP variables to declare the images in the template. 
Also remember that there will be shops using https server, and if you 
use relative image paths, it is likely that the https server will throw up 
warnings about insecure items. One solution to this is to keep a copy of 
the images inside the images directory at the https installation directory. 
To be on the safer side, I recommend you always use PHP variables  
for images.
In this section, you are going to understand how Zen Cart templates work, and what 
you need to change to get your desired look and feel.

Template Files Structure
The Zen Cart templates are located in the includes/templates directory. The 
typical structure of the templates directory is shown in the following figure. Note 
that by default there is a default template named template_default. This template 
contains most of the files needed for any template, and can be used as a base for all 
new templates. Therefore, it is wise not to modify or replace any file in this template 
directory. Instead, create the new template in a separate directory and apply the 
template override. Through this template override, all new changes will be applied 
along with this default template. 
The template files used in Zen Cart provide the structure and layout of the various 
pages of your cart. They make use of the definitions from your language files. 
The template files of Zen Cart are located in the includes/templates/template_
default directory under the installation root of the shop. Template files have a tpl 
prefix (for example, tpl_filename.php). They provide the structure and layout of 
the various pages of a Zen Cart shop. 
 

Chapter 4
[ 111 ]
You will find three types of template files:
Common: These template files are located in the includes/templates/
template_default/common directory. These are common to every page used 
in Zen Cart. Generally, these files consist of the main page, header, footer and 
box files for the sideboxes.
Specific pages: There are some template files specific to certain pages. These 
are located in the includes/templates/template_default/templates 
directory. For example, the display for the Login page is defined by the  
tpl_login_default.php file. If you want to change the display of a 
particular page, change the respective template file in this directory.
Sideboxes: Display of the contents in the sideboxes is defined in the 
sideboxes template files. You will find these files in the includes/
templates/template_default/sideboxes directory.
Besides these three types of template files, there are also CSS stylesheets and graphics 
files in the template directory. Editing the template and CSS files will not be too hard 
as most of the sections in those files are commented for your understanding.
CSS in Zen Cart Template
Zen Cart uses CSS for layout and display of the store's front-end. There are several 
CSS stylesheets for different purposes. Generally, CSS stylesheets are located in the 
CSS folder within the template directory. You can change most of the layout and 
display characteristics, such as color, font, and so on, by editing these stylesheets. 
The names of the stylesheets and their descriptions are given in the following table.
CSS file Naming
Purpose
style*.css
These stylesheets load at the very beginning and define  
site-wide properties.
language_stylesheet.
css
These files are for language-specific properties. For each 
language, you may need to define a separate stylesheet. For 
example, while using the Bangla language, you need to use 
the appropriate fonts, instead of default Arial or Helvetica. In 
this case, you have to define Bangla language-specific style 
properties in the bangla_stylesheet.css file. On selecting the 
Bangla language from the front-end, language-specific style 
information will be used from the bangla_stylesheet.css file.
page_name.css   
These files are for page-specific styles. You can define different 
style properties for each page through these stylesheets.

CSS file Naming
Purpose
language_page_name.
css
These are language-specific style definitions for a specific  
page. When a page's language changes, the style definitions 
from these stylesheets are used to display that page in the  
selected language.
c_??_??.css   
These files are for a specific category. On changing the 
category, the style information from these pages is used.
language_c_??_??.css
These files contain language-specific style information for each 
category.
m_??.css  
These files define style properties specific to a manufacturer.
language_m_??.css  
These files contain language-specific style properties for a 
manufacturer.
p_??.css   
These files define style properties for a specific product's info 
page. By adding these stylesheets, you can display the product 
information pages differently for each manufacturer.
language_p_??.css   
These files define the language-specific style properties for a 
product's info page.
print*.css  
These files contain site-wide style properties for generating 
printer-friendly pages.
The stylesheets mentioned above are listed in the order in which they load. 
stylesheet.css always loads first, and should contain the majority of your CSS 
selectors. Files loaded later takes priority over previously loaded file(s). 
You can speed up loading time by including only new selectors or 
selectors whose properties you wish to change in the optional CSS files. 
You can also have different overrides for the same page, in different 
languages, because the two would never be called at the same time.
Language-specific stylesheets are of great use while considering the localization of 
your store. As you know, fonts may need to be different for different languages. 
Fonts used for English will not be enough to display the contents in Bangla or in 
Hindi. For these languages, you need to define the bangla_stylesheet.css or 
hindi_stylesheet.css files. These files should contain only the site-wide changes 
that you want to make to stylesheet.css. For example, you may only need to 
change the background-image and font-family for Bangla or Hindi.
 

Chapter 4
[ 113 ]
You can also set different stylesheets for different pages. For example, you may set a 
different background-image for different pages. 
Although you have the flexibility to add new stylesheets and selectors, 
it is better to use existing CSS files and the standard tags as much as 
possible. Only change their properties when needed. It is also suggested 
that you do not change the core code. Use the existing CSS files to do the 
work for you. Keeping your custom design in custom CSS files will later 
help you upgrade Zen Cart easily. 
Understanding Overrides
One of the useful features of Zen Cart is its override system. This feature allows 
template designers to use existing templates as a base, and apply new or modified 
designs to the template system on an incremental basis. Overrides also allow you to 
make and save changes to your cart without the fear of losing them when upgrades 
and patches are released.
The override system is applicable to:
 Language Files (includes/languages)
 Module Files (includes/modules)
Template Files (includes/templates/template_default)
Extra Definitions (includes/languages/language_name/ 
extra_definitions)
Extra Data Files (includes/extra_datafiles)
This means, that you can customize these files without modifying them directly. 
Creating some new files and adding modifications to the new files will help you 
achieve the desired customization.  All of these new modified files can be saved in 
the custom_folder, say my_mods.

Overriding Language Files
Let us consider an example for modifying a language file. Generally Zen Cart 
uses the language strings from the includes/languages/english.php file. You 
can make site-wide changes to this file. For example, you may want to adapt the 
language to suit a book store. As you sell only books, you can use 'Books' instead 
of 'Products', and also 'Publishers' instead of 'Manufacturers'. You can also change 
languages for specific pages. For example, you can change the language for the 
Featured Products page (featured_products.php) by applying overrides as follow:
1.	 Create a new directory /includes/languages/english/packt
2.	 Copy includes/languages/english/featured_products.php to this 
new directory. You now have /includes/languages/english/packt/
featured_products.php
3.	 Open the file featured_products.php in a text editor, then find the 
following lines of code to modify:
define('NAVBAR_TITLE', 'Featured Products');
define('HEADING_TITLE', 'Featured Products');
define('TEXT_DATE_ADDED', 'Date Added:');
define('TEXT_MANUFACTURER', 'Manufacturer:');
define('TEXT_PRICE', 'Price:');
Replace 'Manufacturer' with 'Publisher' and 'Products' with 'Books'. Now the 
above lines will look like:
define('NAVBAR_TITLE', 'Featured Books');
define('HEADING_TITLE', 'Featured Books');
define('TEXT_DATE_ADDED', 'Date Added:');
define('TEXT_MANUFACTURER', 'Publisher:');
define('TEXT_PRICE', 'Price:');
4.	 Save the file.
Similarly, open the /includes/languages/english/index.php file and replace  
all instances of products with books and all instances of manufacturers with 
publishers. Also, replace all instances of models with edition.
 

Chapter 4
[ 115 ]
Now, the Featured Products page of your Zen Cart shop will look like the following 
screenshot. Note that 'Books' is shown instead of 'Products'.
Overriding Module Files
As with Language overrides, you can apply overrides to module files located in  
/includes/modules/sideboxes/. Each .php file in this folder represents a sidebox. 
If you want to make changes to a sidebox, the best way is to use an override. For 
example, in your book shop you may want to use a custom Information sidebox. 
Instead of modifying information.php, you can use an override. Follow the  
given instructions:
1.	 Create a new directory, includes/modules/sideboxes/packt.
2.	 Copy includes/modules/sideboxes/information.php to this new folder.
3.	 Now, open the file includes/modules/sideboxes/packt/information.
php in your favorite text editor.
4.	 Modify the file to suit your needs. 
5.	 Save the file.
Whenever you develop a new module for this bookshop, you can put it in this 
directory. The module will override the modules in the other directories, when you 
apply the Packt publishing template.
 

Customizing Look and Feel
[ 116 ]
Overriding Template Files 
Overrides can also be used for page-specific template files. Page-specific templates 
are located in the includes/templates/template_default/templates/tpl_*.php 
files. If you need to modify some part of a page-specific template, for example  
tpl_product_reviews_default.php, follow the given instructions:
1.	 Create the directory, includes/templates/packt/templates.
2.	 Copy includes/templates/template_default/templates/ tpl_
product_reviews_default.php to the above directory.
3.	 Open the file in your favorite text editor.  
3.	 Find the appropriate sections and modify them to suit your needs.
4.	 Save the file.
The changes you have made to tpl_product_reviews_default.php will now 
override the previous design.
Using Your Own Definitions
You may need to include additional definitions during customization of your 
Zen Cart. Additional definitions are generally kept in the includes/languages/
english/extra_definitions/ folder. To add your own definitions, open your 
favorite text editor, create a definition file named my_own_definition.php and 
save it in an appropriate folder. Write all of the definitions that are needed for 
customization of your Zen Cart shop in this file. 
Using Extra Data Files
Sometimes, you may also need to create extra data files for some modules or for 
customizing your Zen Cart shop. Follow the same method used for creating your 
own definition file. You can define extra data files and save these in the includes/
extra_datafiles/ folder. For example, you have created a custom page (about_us) 
and need to reference the filename. You can do this by creating a new file  
(about_us_filenames.php) which will include the following:
<?php
// About Us Filename Define
define('FILENAME_ABOUT_US', 'about_us');
?>
Now, save the file as /includes/extra_datafiles/about_us_filenames.php. 
 

Chapter 4
[ 117 ]
Zen Cart Upgrades and Overrides
One of the benefits of using the override system is that you don't have to worry 
about over-writing your custom files when you upgrade to a later version, because 
all of your modified files are in the custom directories. If you do not use override, 
but directly modify the core files, it will be difficult to save or recreate your changes 
during an upgrade. 
For safety, wherever you see a classic folder, you can add another custom folder, 
where custom is the name of your customized template. You can do all the changes 
in this custom folder, keeping the original files intact. This will help when you are 
upgrading to later versions.
Customizing Zen Cart Templates
The preferred way to customize the look of a page is to do so with a stylesheet. It is 
much easier to keep track of a stylesheet than hacks in the source code. 
When Zen Cart loads a page, it first looks for a stylesheet with the same name as 
your page.  You can see what Zen Cart calls each page by looking at your URL. 
It should be something like your_domain/index.php?main_page=index.main_
page. It tells the cart which page to display. For example, if you want to hide the 
breadcrumbs on your homepage, you can do so by adding the following stylesheet:
Create a new stylesheet (.css file) in your templates CSS directory named 
index_home.css.
Add the styles for your homepage. The style required to hide the 
breadcrumbs is: 
	
#navBreadCrumb{ display: none; } 
Save the changes to the file.
•
•
•
 

Customizing Look and Feel
[ 118 ]
Now, refresh your browser to your shop's homepage. If the new style is not  
applied, try emptying your browser cache. The homepage will be shown without  
the breadcrumb.
Another example of using a page-specific stylesheet may be for the Privacy page. 
Suppose that you want to show the heading of the privacy notice in red, and the 
background of the notice in silver. For this, you can create a stylesheet named 
privacy.css and place the following style declaration in that file:
#privacyDefaultHeading {      
 font-family: Arial;
 color: red;
 text-transform: uppercase;
 }
 
 #privacyDefaultMainContent {
   color: red;
   background-color: silver;
 }
In this way, you can create stylesheets for each page. However, it is convenient to 
add only those style declarations that are unique to that specific page.

Changing Logos and Texts
After installation of Zen Cart you will find the Zen Cart logo in the header of 
the store front-end. In the main body, you will see 'Congratulations! You have 
successfully installed your Zen Cart E-commerce Solution'. An advertisement for 
the Zen Cart manual follows that. You have to customize this page before starting 
your online shop. In fact, the first step towards customizing your look and feel will 
be to change these texts and the logo of the store.
Changing Default Texts
The first thing that you may want to change is the statement 'Congratulations! You 
have successfully installed your Zen Cart™; E-Commerce Solution'. To remove this 
statement, open the includes/languages/english/index.php file in your favorite 
text editor and find the following code:
/*Replace this text with the headline you would like for your shop. 
For example: 'Welcome to My SHOP!'*/
define('HEADING_TITLE', 'Congratulations! You have successfully 
installed  your Zen Cart&trade; E-Commerce Solution.');
} elseif ($category_depth == 'nested') {
  // This section deals with displaying a subcategory
 /*  Replace this line with the headline you would like for your shop.
For example: 'Welcome to My SHOP!' */
define('HEADING_TITLE', 'Congratulations! You have successfully 
installed your Zen Cart&trade; E-Commerce Solution.'); 
 

Customizing Look and Feel
[ 120 ]
In the highlighted lines in the preceding code, replace the text starting 
'Congratulations…' with your own text. Make sure that the single quote marks 
are not deleted. You may put a welcome message here, say, 'Welcome to Packt 
Publishing'. However, if you do not want to show anything, just delete the default 
words and keep one space. Then save the file as includes/languages/english/
packt/index.php, to use the overrides. 
Another default text you need to change is 'Sales Message Goes Here'. You may 
also need to change the 'Tagline Here'. To do so, open the includes/languages/
english/header.php file in your favorite text editor and find the following line  
of code:
define('HEADER_SALES_TEXT', 'Tagline Here');
Replace 'Tagline Here' with your own text, such as 'community experience, 
distilled!'. Make sure that the single quotes are not deleted and the text you specify 
remains inside the quotes. Save the file as includes/languages/english/packt/
header.php.
If you see 'Zen Cart!, The Art of E-Commerce' on your browser title bar, you need 
to edit another file includes/languages/english/meta_tags.php. Open it in your 
text editor and find the following lines of code: 
// page title
define('TITLE', 'Zen Cart!');
// Site Tagline
define('SITE_TAGLINE', 'The Art of E-commerce'); 
Replace the title and tagline texts with your own texts, making sure that the single 
quote marks are not left out, and new quote marks are not added. Save the edited file 
as includes/languages/english/packt/meta_tags.php.
Note that after changing the above texts, the advertisement placed on the homepage 
is still visible. This is defined in the /includes/languages/english/html_
includes/classic/define_main_page.php file. Open the file in the text editor and 
delete all of the contents of file. To be safe, you may apply override by creating a file 
named /includes/languages/english/html_includes/packt/define_main_
page.php. Enter your desired text in this file using HTML markup, or keep it blank 
to show nothing.
 

Chapter 4
[ 121 ]
You may use the pages in the /includes/languages/english/html_includes/ 
folder more intelligently. You can add any HTML content to any page by creating 
a define_page_name.php page in this folder and sub-folder. For example, the texts 
to be displayed in the Privacy page can be put in define_privacy.php file in the 
HTML format. Similarly, define_checkout_success.php, define_conditions.
php, define_contact_us.php, define_page_not_found.php, and  
define_discount_coupon.php can be of great use if you want to display related 
information as nicely-formatted text.
Changing the Header Image
The header image of Zen Cart is one of the first things you will want to change. By 
default, Zen Cart uses a graphic named header_bg.jpg for its header, but you have 
the freedom to change its name as you wish. To do this, create a new background 
graphic using an image editor—GIMP or Adobe Photoshop—and save that image as 
includes/templates/packt/images/header_bg.jpg.
For Zen Cart customization, it is better not to change the original files. 
Zen Cart uses an override system which can be used to add customization 
to templates, modules, sideboxes, and so on. Let us start using the 
override system for the following exercises. 
From Zen Cart 1.3.7.x, stylesheets are used to define the background image for the 
header. Therefore, you need to edit the stylesheet. Open the stylesheet.css and 
find the following lines:
 #logoWrapper {
   width:760px;
   height:110px;
   background-image:url(../images/header_bg.jpg);
   background-repeat:no-repeat;
 }
In the highlighted line above, specify the name of your header background image, 
for example, my_header_bg.jpg. Save the file as includes/templates/packt/css/
stylesheet.css. 
As Packt website does not use a header image, you can remove this as well. To do 
this, change the preceding code block to be as follows:
#logoWrapper {
   width:90%;
   height:110px;
   background-color:#ffffff;
 }
 

Customizing Look and Feel
[ 122 ]
As www.packtpub.com uses a fluid design, you have to make it much more flexible 
by defining the width as a percentage. Instead of the background header, display a 
white background. Now, your store will look as shown in the following screenshot:
Before using any new image as background , make sure you resize its height and 
width to fit the header region. Also note that you can specify its height and width 
from this style declaration. 
Adding a New Logo
You need to change the logo of your store to make it branded. One easy way to do 
this is to replace the includes/templates/template_default/images/logo.gif 
file with another logo.gif file of the same dimension. But often, you would want 
to do more by creating your own image of different sizes and in different image 
formats (that is, .jpg, .png). You may also want to change their position. Now, you 
are going to learn how to do this.
First, prepare your logo using an image editor of your choice. Save the image to 
includes/templates/packt/images/packt_logo.png. 
Now, you need to adjust the height, width and logo name in the language file. To do 
this, open includes/languages/english/header.php and find the following lines:
 define('HEADER_LOGO_WIDTH', '192px');
 define('HEADER_LOGO_HEIGHT', '64px');
 define('HEADER_LOGO_IMAGE', 'logo.gif');
 

Chapter 4
[ 123 ]
Make appropriate changes to these lines and save the file as includes/languages/
english/packt/header.php. You have to do it for each language. For example, for 
the Bangla language, you have to copy header.php file to includes/languages/
bangla/packt/header.php.
By default, the logo is left-aligned. This alignment is defined in  
includes/templates/template_default/css/stylesheet.css. Open the  
file and find the following: 
#logo, .centerBoxContents, .specialsListBoxContents,
       .categoryListBoxContents, .centerBoxContentsAlsoPurch,  
       .attribImg {float: left;}
Because this is a collection of several selectors (#logo, .centerBoxContents and so 
on), split this into two separate statements as shown here, so as not to interfere with 
the layout of the other sections: 
.centerBoxContents, .specialsListBoxContents,
.categoryListBoxContents, .centerBoxContentsAlsoPurch,  
.attribImg {float: left;}
#logo {float: left;}
To center the logo, use text-align: center; or to align it to the right, use float: right; 
Save the files as includes/templates/packt/css/stylesheet.css. After adding 
the logo, the logo area will appear as follows:
Changing Colors and Fonts
If you open any page of your Zen Cart in a text editor, you will find that the page is 
broken into smaller pieces called 'classes'. The style for each class is defined in the 
stylesheet.css file. You can control the look of your shop by changing the fonts, 
colors, text sizes, borders, background images, and so on, by changing the class 
styles. You can change the colors by using standard HTML color numbers for the text 
and background colors. You can also change the text size by increasing or decreasing 
the size, and change the typeface by using a different font name.
 

Customizing Look and Feel
[ 124 ]
For example, you want to change the font size and the color of the Tag Line. If you 
view the source code, you will find the tag line in following code:
<div id="tagline">community experience, distilled</div>
If you want to change its style—font, color, and so on—you have to change the style 
definition of your tagline ID in stylesheet.css. 
To do this, open the includes/templates/packt/css/stylesheet.css file in your 
favorite text editor, and find the following lines:
#tagline {
	
color:#000000;
	
font-size: 2em;
	
text-align : center;
	
vertical-align: middle;
	
}
Let us change its color and font as follows:
#tagline {
	
color:#6600FF;
	
font-size:3em;
	
font-style:italic;
	
text-align : center;
	
vertical-align: middle;
	
}
Now, reload the homepage in your browser. You will see the difference in the 
display of your tagline.
You have the freedom to edit the stylesheet. You can remove a CSS element, such 
as a border, simply by commenting out the line with a "/*" (slash, asterisk) at the 
beginning of the line and "*/" (asterisk, slash) at the end of the line. You can add new 
style properties and make your Zen Cart shop more attractive. But what you need to 
know to do this is how CSS works.

The Web Developer Toolbar extension for Mozilla Firefox may be of great 
help to you while editing stylesheets for Zen Cart. This will help you 
identify classes and IDs for HTML elements, and show you associated 
style declarations and stylesheets in use. It will also help you see the 
source code and identify document object models. 
As you want to make the site similar to www.packtpub.com, you have to change its 
look and feel by changing its fonts and colors by editing stylesheets. The following 
changes are to be made to /includes/templates/packt/css/stylesheet.css:
#mainWrapper {
...
   width: 90%; /* instead of 750px, we make it fluid */
...
	
}
#logoWrapper{
	
/* background-image: url(..);
	
background-repeat: repeat-x; */
	
background-color: #ffffff;
	
height:100px;
	
}
#navMainWrapper, #navSuppWrapper, #navCatTabsWrapper {

}
#navCatTabs li {

After all of these changes have been made for the two image files, tile_back.png 
and tabrightI.gif, and these images are added to /includes/templates/packt/
images directory, the site now looks quite similar to www.packtpub.com, though it 
may need some more tweaking. Look at the following screenshot:
Note that now the color scheme has been changed to look similar to Packt's website. 
The borders of the sideboxes also look similar to Packt's boxes. You may try to  
fine-tune its design after learning more about changing buttons and page layouts.
Changing Buttons and Icons
You can change the buttons and icons used in your Zen Cart shop. This will help 
you customize the Zen Cart shop as you wish. In Zen Cart, the buttons and icons are 
generally located in the following places:
/images folder: This is where your product images are kept. Whenever 
you upload a product image, it goes into this folder. This folder may have 
subfolders to contain product images by manufacturers and/or types.
/includes/languages/english/images folder: The language icon (icon.gif) 
is located in this folder. For each language, create such a folder and put your 
language flag there.
•
•
 

Customizing Look and Feel
[ 128 ]
/includes/templates/template_default/buttons/english folder: This 
folder contains the buttons used by the Cart. You need to add buttons for 
each language. First, generate the buttons in your language, and then put 
them in the appropriate folders. For example, the buttons for the Bangla 
language should be in either the includes/templates/template_default/
buttons/bangla folder or the includes/templates/packt/buttons/ 
bangla folder.
/includes/templates/template_default/images folder: This folder 
contains header_bg.jpg, logo.gif, and other images required by the 
template. Your template-specific image files should be put in the images 
folder under your template directory, for example, includes/templates/
packt/images. 
/includes/templates/template_default/images/icons folder: This 
folder contains additional images used by Zen Cart. The delete icon, warning 
icon, and so on can be found in this folder. Put your template-specific icons 
in the includes/templates/packt/images/icons folder.
Once you have generated the custom buttons and icons for your template, the names 
of these buttons need to be defined in includes/language/english/button_
names.php. For each language, you need to set the names in this file. For example, 
the names of buttons specific to the Bangla language should be defined in the 
includes/languages/bangla/button_names.php file.
The editing of button_names.php will be straightforward. It has two sections: one 
for defining the button image files, another for defining alt text for those images. 
The following is a code snippet from button_names.php:

You can use your favorite image editor for creating the buttons in your language. 
The buttons may be saved as GIF, JPG or PNG, but if you are not using the same 
format and names as the original buttons, you need to edit the button_names.php 
file to reflect the new names of the buttons, and save this edited file in your language 
override directory.
There are some online tools which can be used to generate buttons for 
the Zen Cart store, simply by specifying the background and foreground 
color, font, language and button template. One such tool is available at 
http://www.advancewebsoft.com/downloads/free-scripts/
free-oscommerce-cre-loaded-zen-cart-oscmax-button-
generator-p.html. This online tool can generate buttons for Zen Cart, 
osCommerce, CRE-Loaded, and oscMax.
Changing Layout of a Template
Changing the layout of a template mainly involves changing its width and showing/
hiding sideboxes. You have already learned about showing or hiding sideboxes. 
Now, you will learn how to change the width of a template.
In Zen Cart version 1.3.x, CSS are used for layout, instead of tables. Therefore, you 
only need to edit the main stylesheet for that template. When changing the width of 
a template, it is better to use an override. Open the /includes/templates/packt/
css/stylesheet.css file and find the following style declaration:
#mainWrapper {
 background-color: #ffffff;
 text-align: left;
 width: 750px;
 vertical-align: top;
}
The highlighted line specifies the width of the page. To make the template fluid, that 
is, fit it in the available browser window space, change its value to 100%. You could 
also choose any other desired value. 
In Zen Cart version prior to 1.3.x, changing the width was tricky. For such a 
template open the stylesheet.css file for editing, and find the .centershop, 
TABLE.header, .main_page, and TD.headerNavigation declarations. In all the 
declarations, you will find a line saying, width: 750px !important;. Change the 
width in this line. Remember that all four instances need to be changed.

Modifying a Page Template
Page-specific templates are located in the /includes/templates/template_
default/templates/ directory. For each page there is a tpl_*.php page. The layout 
of the page is defined in its related tpl file. You can change the template for each file 
by editing these files and applying overrides. For example, you may want to change 
the layout of the Product Information page. Information regarding a product is 
shown in this page when you click a product link. By default, this page looks like the 
following screenshot:
Note that the Add to Cart block is shown after the product description. You may opt 
to put this just after the product name to persuade customers to buy it. To do this, 
you need to edit the tpl_product_info_display.php file. Open it in your favorite 
text editor, and find the following block:  
<!--bof Add to Cart Box --> 
..... 
 
<!--eof Add to Cart Box-->
Select the whole block and cut it. Now, locate the following block:
<!--bof Product Name-->
<h1 id="productName" class="productGeneral">
    <?php echo $products_name; ?> 
</h1>
<!--eof Product Name-->
 

Chapter 4
[ 131 ]
Paste the <!—bof Add to Cart Box --> block just after <!—eof Product Name 
-->. Now save the file in your override directory /includes/templates/packt/
templates/. 
Refresh the page in your browser. Now, you will see the Add to Cart block just after 
the product name. You can edit other files in the same way.
Using EZ pages
The product catalogue in the Zen Cart shop consists of dynamically-generated pages. 
Of course, the product catalogue is the core of an online shop. However, besides 
product catalogs, a good shop also needs to have some static pages that describe 
such things as privacy policy, shipping & return policy, frequently asked questions, 
and so on. These pages generally do not change frequently and need to be linked to 
the homepage so that customers can access these pages whenever necessary.
A feature called EZ-Pages provides the flexibility of adding static pages to a Zen Cart 
shop in a fast and easy way. It also helps create links to other internal and external 
pages. You can also create related links to form a group or a chapter.
 

Customizing Look and Feel
[ 132 ]
EZ-Page can be added to your store via Tools | EZ-Pages | New File in the 
Administration Panel. Options for creating an EZ-Page are shown in the  
following table: 
Option
Description
Page Title
Type the name of the page in this field. The page or link you 
are creating will be referred to by this page title. Page Title 
is mandatory, and all EZ-Pages and links need it in order to 
function.
Open New Window
Selecting 'Yes' for this field will open the page or link in a new 
window when on in the Header, Footer or Sidebox.
Page is SSL
Select 'Yes' to indicate that the page or link is using Secure 
Socket Layer (SSL).
Link placement locations
Although you have the option of adding additional links to 
the Header, Footer and Sidebox with EZ-Pages, you are not 
limited to only these three link locations. Links can be placed 
in one or more locations simply by enabling the Order for the 
Location(s) where the Link should appear. The Link Location 
Status for the Header, Footer and Sidebox is controlled simply 
by setting these to 'Yes' or 'No' for each setting. Then, set the 
order in which the Link should appear for each location.
Chapter and TOC
The Chapter and TOC, or Table of Contents, are a unique 
method of building Multiple Links that interact together. While 
these links still follow the rules of the Header, Footer and 
Sidebox placement, the difference is that only one of the links, 
the main link, needs to be displayed anywhere on the site.
HTML Content
Add HTML content that will be shown on the page in this text 
area. HTML editors will often add the opening and closing tags 
for sections such as  <html>, <head> and <body> to the file 
you are working on. You need to remove these when copying 
from another HTML page, as these are already added to the 
pages via EZ-Pages.
Internal Link URL
Internal Link URLs are links to internal pages within 
your shop. These can be to any valid URL, but should 
be written as relative links such as index.php?main_
page=index&cPath=21. It is convenient to write it as a 
Relative Link so that after changing domains, the link still 
remain valid.
External Link URL
External Link URLs are links to pages outside your shop. These 
can be to any valid URL such as: http://www.zen-cart.
com. For an external link, you need to include the full URL. 
You can also mark these to open in a New Window or the  
Same Window.
 

Chapter 4
[ 133 ]
After typing a page title, if you provide an internal or external link, it will be 
considered as a link, and not a page. In that case, the text you have typed in the 
HTML Content box will be ignored. 
Creating A New Template
Creating a new template for Zen Cart is fun. You have already learned the basics 
of how a Zen Cart template works. Prior to version 1.3.x of Zen Cart, some HTML 
tables were used for layout. But in version 1.3.x onwards, Zen Cart has fully 
abandoned the use of HTML tables for layout, using a CSS-based layout instead.
Creating A File System 
Let us start building a new template for Zen Cart by creating a new folder under 
includes/templates/. Let us name it Packt (or whatever you like). But remember 
to use underscore instead of spaces in a long name. Avoid using Book Shop. Instead, 
use book_shop or BookShop.
Under the packt template folder, create the following folders:
images: this folder will contain all the images needed for the template.
css: this folder will contain all the CSS files for the template. It's better to 
copy all the files from the includes/templates/template_default/css 
directory to this css folder.
common: this folder will contain the common files for the template. You may 
copy the files from the includes/templates/template_default/common 
folder, and edit those to suit your needs.
sideboxes: this folder will contain module-specific sideboxes. Here, you 
can add new sideboxes, which you are going to use.
templates: this folder contains page-specific templates. Whenever you want 
to change a page's layout, copy the template for that page to this directory 
and modify it as required.
Information regarding a template is located in the template_info.php file. You 
need to create a new template_info.php file for the new template. Copy the file 
called includes/templates/template_default/template_info.php into the  
new template folder, and then open the template_info.php file in your favorite  
text editor.

Change the text between each set of single quotes to suit your new template. 
<?php
$template_name = 'Packt Publishing';
$template_version = 'Version 1.0';
$template_author = 'Suhreed Sarkar';
$template_description = 'This template is designed for Packt 
Publishing';
$template_screenshot = '';
?>
Remember to keep the single quotes. Your template name does not need to be 
identical to your folder name, and you can use spaces to make it read well, but it 
is best to keep them similar. Leave the space between the quotes for the template 
screenshot field empty for now, as you don't have one yet.
When you've finished, your new file structure should appear as follows: 
Open your Admin panel and navigate to Tools | Template Selection. Click the 
Edit button, then choose Packt Publishing from the drop-down menu and click the 
Update button. Now, navigate to Tools | Layout boxes controller, and click the 
Reset button at the bottom of the page. 
Your new template is now enabled and ready to be customized.
 

Chapter 4
[ 135 ]
Using Overrides
When building a new template for Zen Cart, you can use its powerful overriding 
feature.  Overriding means using some template as the base and extending it by 
adding different properties through separate templates. For example, you may 
want to make some modifications to the default template, template_default. You 
could modify the files in the template_default directory to do this. But due to its 
overriding character, you can add the changes in the new template, say packt, which 
will apply the changes to the shop.
In fact, you can override any file in the path includes/templates/ 
template_default. Files in this directory generally determine the layout and 
the HTML formatting of your web pages. By default, Zen Cart has two standard 
templates: template_default and classic, both of which are located in the 
includes/templates/ folder. 
Out of these two standard templates, only template_default contains a full set of 
files. Every other template contains only the files that differ from template_default. 
If your template does not contain a particular file, Zen Cart will pull that file from 
template_default. 
Graphics
You need to add your templates graphics to the appropriate folders as discussed 
previously in the section on Changing Buttons and Icons. The header image, logo, 
background image, background image for sidebox headings, and so on should be 
placed in the images directory under your template directory. If you want to change 
the buttons and icons, create the graphic files in the GIF, JPG or PNG format and 
put them in the /includes/templates/template_name/buttons/language_name 
folder. Then, update the button_names.php file to define the button image file name, 
and the ALT texts for those images.
Sideboxes 
You do not need to copy existing sideboxes from the template_default directory, 
as these will automatically be displayed. If you are planning to develop a new 
sidebox, put the template for that sidebox in the sideboxes folder under your 
template directory.
 

Customizing Look and Feel
[ 136 ]
A sidebox consists of three files, which are located in the includes directory: 
modules/sideboxes/template_name/name_of_sidebox.php
languages/english/extra_definitions/template_name/ 
name_of_sidebox_defines.php 
templates/template_name/sideboxes/tpl_name_of_sidebox.php 
You need to replace template_name and name_of_sidebox with you template name 
and the sidebox name respectively. For example, let us build a sidebox named  
my_sidebox. Then, my_sidebox.php file will read like this:
<?php
$show_my_sidebox = true;
if ($show_my_sidebox == true){
require($template->get_template_dir('tpl_my_sidebox.php', 
  DIR_WS_TEMPLATE, $current_page_base,'sideboxes'). 
  '/tpl_my_sidebox.php');
$title =  BOX_HEADING_MY_SIDEBOX;
$left_corner = false;
$right_corner = false;
$right_arrow = false;
require($template->get_template_dir($column_box_default,  
  DIR_WS_TEMPLATE, $current_page_base,'common') . 
  '/' . $column_box_default);
 }
?>
This page actually defines what is to be shown in that sidebox. Note that this 
page also includes the corresponding template file. Here, we have used a constant 
BOX_HEADING_MY_SIDEBOX.  You need to define this in the includes/languages/
english/extra_definitions/packt/my_sidebox_defines.php file. This file will 
look like this:
<?php
  define('BOX_HEADING_MY_SIDEBOX', 'My Sidebox');
?>
Now, you have to build its template file includes/templates/packt/sideboxes/
tpl_my_sidebox.php, which will read as:
<?php
  $content = "This is my first Sidebox. I have created it in 5 
minutes. Although it is not of practical use yet, I hope I can 
eventually build a good sidebox.";
?>

Chapter 4
[ 137 ]
If you have created these files for the packt template, you can try it by going to 
Tools | Layout Boxes Controller in the administration panel. From here, turn the 
sidebox ON and set it up to display in the left or the right side column. This sidebox 
will look like the following figure.
Stylesheets
All stylesheets for your new template should be placed in the /includes/
templates/template_name/css folder. You should follow stylesheet naming 
conventions as discussed earlier in this chapter. It is a good idea to copy an old 
stylesheet and then modify it to suit your needs. As discussed earlier, you can have 
multiple stylesheets for your shop –you can even add a stylesheet for each page. 
As a design rule, try to keep the declarations minimal, simple, and self explanatory. 
Try to restrain yourself from changing the class and ID names in the core files.
Creating and Modifying Email Templates
As a store owner, you need to send several mails to your existing and potential 
customers. You will learn about promotion and public relations activities available in 
Zen Cart in Chapter 6. All these emails use some templates that reside in the /email 
folder under the Zen Cart installation directory. To change these emails to your style, 
you may edit these templates.
The email's structure is determined in one of two ways. If you are sending plain text 
emails, the email structure is determined by the way you put together the various 
items (customer greeting, order number, link to detailed invoice, and so on) in a 
string variable that is then passed to the zen_mail() function. If you are sending 
HTML emails, the structure is determined by the template you use.
 

Customizing Look and Feel
[ 138 ]
Text Email Template
You can rearrange, add, or delete items in a plain text email. To do so, you will need 
to edit the Zen Cart files where the email is created. For example, if you want to 
edit the order confirmation email, you will need to edit the file includes/classes/
order.php. 
In your example, open up includes/classes/order.php and scroll down to the 
bottom of the file, in the function send_order_email(). There, you will see the lines 
that construct the plain text email message: 
[Line 827]
$email_order = EMAIL_TEXT_HEADER . EMAIL_TEXT_FROM . STORE_NAME . "\n\
n" . $this->customer['firstname'] . ' ' . $this->customer['lastname'] 
. "\n\n" . EMAIL_THANKS_FOR_SHOPPING . "\n" . EMAIL_DETAILS_FOLLOW 
. "\n" . EMAIL_SEPARATOR . "\n" . EMAIL_TEXT_ORDER_NUMBER . ' ' . 
$zf_insert_id . "\n" . EMAIL_TEXT_DATE_ORDERED . ' ' . strftime(DATE_
FORMAT_LONG) . "\n" . EMAIL_TEXT_INVOICE_URL . ' ' . zen_href_
link(FILENAME_ACCOUNT_HISTORY_INFO, 'order_id=' . $zf_insert_id, 'SSL' 
[Line 848]
$email_order .= zen_db_output($this->info['comments']) . "\n\n";
[Line 855]
$email_order .= EMAIL_TEXT_PRODUCTS . "\n" .
                        EMAIL_SEPARATOR . "\n" .
                        $this->products_ordered .
                        EMAIL_SEPARATOR . "\n";
In this file, the variable that holds the plain text email message is called  
$email_order. It generally has a different name in each file, such as $email or 
$email_text. Whatever its name, this is the place where you will make your 
changes. You can add, delete, and rearrange the order of the items to suit  
your wishes. 
HTML Email Templates
HTML Email templates have two parts: embedded CSS and HTML codes. You may 
be surprised to see the embedded stylesheet in each mail template and may want 
to know why linked stylesheets have not been used. One reason for not using the 
linked stylesheet is that you may not know how the email clients will behave. Most 
email clients used today can handle HTML emails and stylesheets to some extent. 
But there is no guarantee that every customer will have an email client that can 
retrieve linked stylesheets and render the emails in the desired format.
 

Chapter 4
[ 139 ]
Stylesheet
The first portion of the email template is devoted to defining styles for different parts 
of the mail. Open the /email/email_template_welcome.html file in your favorite 
text editor to examine the stylesheet in an email template. The stylesheet in this 
template will appear as follows:
<style type="text/css">
.body {background-color:#ffffff; color:#000000; font-family:Verdana,    
Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;}
…
.header {font-size:10px; padding:0px; width:550px;}
.content {font-size:10px; padding:5px; width:550px;}
.content-line {padding:5px;}
.coupon-block { padding: 5px; border: 1px #cccccc solid; background-
color: #FFFF99; }
…
.disclaimer1 a:link {color:#666666;}
.disclaimer1 a:visited {color:#666666;}
.disclaimer2 { color: #666666; padding: 5px; }
.copyright { border-bottom: 0px #9a9a9a solid; padding: 5px; }
</style>
Style declarations in this stylesheet are straight-forward. First, it has defined style for 
the body and hyperlinks. Then, it defines the content and email related styles. Most 
of the style names are self-explanatory. You will find the HTML blocks with these 
names in the template.
HTML with variables
The main part of the email template is the HTML code with style classes and 
variables.  The following are some of the variables used to construct content for  
the email:
$EMAIL_GREETING 
$EMAIL_WELCOME 
$COUPON_BLOCK 
$GV_BLOCK 
$EMAIL_MESSAGE_HTML 
$EMAIL_CONTACT_OWNER 
$EMAIL_CLOSURE 
$EMAIL_FOOTER_COPYRIGHT

[ 140 ]
$EMAIL_DISCLAIMER 
$EMAIL_SPAM_DISCLAIMER 
$EXTRA_INFO
These variables are defined in several PHP files, such as create_account.php. Once 
you have found the files that need to be edited, you may want to add a definition 
for your new HTML item to each one. For example, you have added an item called 
$EMAIL_HOURS_OF_OPERATION to the email_template_order_status.html 
template. One of the files that you will need to edit is admin/orders.php. Find the 
part of that file where the email message is being constructed. In this case, it begins 
around line 100. 
You can see that the HTML message is constructed with several statements such as: 
$html_msg['EMAIL_CUSTOMERS_NAME'] = $check_status->fields['customers_
name'];
$html_msg['EMAIL_TEXT_ORDER_NUMBER'] = EMAIL_TEXT_ORDER_NUMBER . ' ' . 
$oID;
All you need to do is add a new statement under all of these, to define your new item: 
$html_msg['EMAIL_HOURS_OF_OPERATION'] = 'We are open from 9 AM to 5 PM 
every day of the week.';
Use a $ in front of the name of your new item in the HTML template, but 
do not use the $ where you define it.
To change the text displayed in your emails, edit the corresponding language file. 
You can change an existing text, or add a new one (if you've added it to your email 
structure). You add or change text values using the define() statements: 
define(EMAIL_LOVELY_YOU_DROPPED_BY,'We are just so immeasurably 
delighted that you stopped by our store today!');
There is another language file you need to modify when altering text for your emails, 
includes/languages/english/email_extras.php. This file contains several text 
strings common to all emails sent from your store.

Summary
In this chapter, we have learned about customizing the look and feel of a Zen Cart 
Shop. You have seen how Zen Cart templates can be used to change the look and 
feel, and have also understood how the template override system works. We have 
discussed assigning template to a Zen Cart shop, changing default text and logos, 
changing fonts, colors and other styles. We have also discussed customizing Zen 
Cart template by editing template files and using overrides. Then, we learned how 
to create a new template based on an existing template. We have also learned about 
using side-boxes and customizing email templates. 
With this knowledge, you are now ready to move forward to next chapter, which 
will discuss localization of the Zen Cart shop.
 

Localization of Zen Cart
Localization is one of the important features of Zen Cart. Although our online shop 
serves globally, it can also be localized to a specific community or customer niche. 
For example, when customers from Bangladesh connect to the online shop, the 
language of the shop could be changed to Bangla, and customers from France may 
have French as the store's front-end language. 
This chapter discusses the localization features of Zen Cart. After finishing this 
chapter, you will know:
Why localization is necessary
How to localize regions and taxes
How to use multiple currencies for a store
How to add a new language
How to translate the front-end into another language
How to modify or add order status to suit your need
Most of the tasks discussed in this chapter need to be completed before opening the 
shop for online selling.
The Need for Localization
As opposed to globalization, localization is the process of customizing software 
and documentation for a particular country. Localization includes the translation of 
menus and messages into the native spoken language as well as changes in the user 
interface to accommodate different alphabets and cultures. It also includes using 
appropriate locales (for example, date and time formats.) for that country or  
region. For example, for customers from Bangladesh, an online store's front-end 
language may be changed to Bangla, but only changing the language will not be 
enough for localization. For successful localization, appropriate locales—including 
currency, date formats, time-zone, and so on—for Bangladesh will also be used. So, a

Localization of Zen Cart

localization attempt for Bangladesh will automatically translate the website interface. 
The prices will be shown in Bangladeshi Taka (with a symbol ৳), and the date will be 
shown in the dd/mm/yyyy format.
Localization plays an important role in attracting customers—especially for a niche 
market. When a store is localized, customers from the niche market are easily attracted 
to that store, because they think that it is their 'own' store. Localization also helps in 
understanding the content of the store in a better manner. As for Bangla, customers 
speaking Bangla will be more comfortable reading the product description in Bangla. 
Countries and Zones
The first step in localization of the Zen cart shop is to define the zones and  
zone-specific taxes. As you may know, sales taxes vary across countries, and 
also across regions. If the shop can be adapted to the customers' regions, and can 
appropriately calculate the taxes based on the tax rates applicable to their regions, it 
will be of great help to the customers. They will also think that you, the shop owners, 
are more responsive to their needs.
Countries
Locations can be configured into two entities: Countries and Zones. The first 
identifier for a location is a country. You can see the list of countries from the 
Locations/Taxes | Countries screen. 
 

Chapter 5
[ 145 ]
Each country has a name, a two-letter ISO Code and another three-letter ISO Code. 
For example, Bangladesh has two ISO country codes: BD and BGD. These ISO 
codes are based on globally accepted standards. Another field associated with each 
country is the address format. These address formats are also based on the ISO 
standard formats for addresses. These range from 1 to 5. If you explore a little bit, 
you will find that most of countries is use address format 1. 
The five formats are as following:
Format 1
Firstname Lastname
Address line 1
<optional second address line>
City, Postcode
State, Country
Format 2
Firstname Lastname 
Address line 1 
<optional second address line> 
City, State Postcode 
Country
Format 3
Firstname Lastname 
Address line 1 
<optional second address line> 
City 
Postcode - State, Country
Format 4
Firstname Lastname 
Address line 1 
<optional second address line> 
City (Postcode) 
Country
Format 5
Firstname Lastname 
Address line 1 
<optional second address line> 
Postcode City 
Country
You need to choose an appropriate format for the country. For Bangladesh, an 
appropriate address may be format 4, as state names are not used in addresses  
in Bangladesh.
Adding a New Country
Usually, all countries are listed with their associated ISO Codes. However, if you 
want to add a new country, you can do so clicking on the new country button.  
For each country, you need to enter the name, and the ISO-3166 codes (two and three 
digits) for that country. You also have to select an address format used for  
that country.
 

Localization of Zen Cart
[ 146 ]
Editing a Country
Rarely do you need to edit country information. However, you may like to change 
the address format for countries. In that case, select the country from the list, and 
click on the edit button. Then change the country information—Name, ISO Code (2), 
ISO Code (3) and Address format—as appropriate. Click on the update button to 
save your changes.
Deleting a Country
Generally, all countries are listed in the Location/Taxes | Countries screen. If 
you are sure that you do not need a country, you can delete it from the database. 
Remember that once you delete a country, it will not be shown in the Country  
drop-down list during account creation. You can delete a country easily by selecting 
it and clicking on the delete button. A confirmation dialog will be displayed to check 
whether you really want to delete the country. Confirm the deletion by clicking on 
the delete button.
 

Chapter 5
[ 147 ]
Zones
You may need zones in order to calculate shipping costs, taxes, payment methods 
and discounts. There may be multiple zones in a country. By default, there are two 
kinds of zones in Zen Cart: zones and zones definitions (sometimes referred to as geo 
zones). Zones are local; that is, zones can be defined for countries or provinces within 
a larger entity such as a state or a country. 
For example, you can have a zone defined as SAARC, for all the countries in the 
SAARC region, that is, Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, Nepal, Maldives, Sri Lanka 
and Bhutan. Then you can define zones for each of these countries, containing the 
provinces for that country. In Bangladesh, there are six divisions, which can be 
defined as six zones. 
You always have to define at least one zone, and every location (country or state) in 
which you plan to sell should be included in your zone definitions. However, unless 
you have to distinguish between provinces or countries (for taxes, or shipping, for 
example), you don't really need to define additional zones.
The zones and zone definitions (geo_zones) are used to tie Tax Rates and Tax 
Classes to geographic locations. For example, you may ship to all of the states in the 
USA, but if your store is located in Florida, you only need to charge sales tax to the 
customers in Florida. You can define two zones, one containing all the states except 
Florida, and one containing only Florida. Then, you can specify the Tax Rate that the 
Florida �����������������
zone should use. 
Now, if your state has separate tax rates for different cities or countries  
(say California), then you need to establish one for each city or country in order to 
account for sales across cities, or countries, according to your sales tax return. 
Some Shipping Modules (such as the zones shipping module) also work 
with geographic zones. These zones are specified in the module itself, and 
are independent of the zone definitions you make. This means that you 
can specify different shipping rates, for example, for countries in the same 
zone definition.

Creating a Zone
You can create a zone via menu option Locations/Taxes | Zones. Click on the new 
zone button. In the Zones Name box, type the name of the zone, enter a code in the 
Zones Code field, and select the country in which the zone is situated. For example, 
you may type a district name, assign a code to it, and select Bangladesh as the 
country. After typing this information, click on the insert button to save the zone.
You can create as many zones as you need. For example, you may create 64 zones 
for 64 districts in Bangladesh. These zones can be used for calculating shipping costs 
by courier service. Remember that creating a zone alone will have no effect on the 
shipping costs or taxes until you use the zones for those purposes. The uses of these 
zones are defined via menu option Locations/Taxes | Zone definitions.
Zone Definitions
Zone definitions are zones used for shipping, payment and taxes. To create and use 
a zone definition, ������������������������������������������
you ��������������������������������������
first have to create geo zones in the Locations/Taxes | Zones 
screen, as described earlier. Then, you can use the zones in zone definitions.
By default, you will see one zone definition—Florida, which is used to ascertain local 
taxes. You can create new zones from the Locations/Taxes | Zone definitions screen. 
You will see a list of Zone Definitions in this screen with three status indications: 
Taxes & Zones Defined (green), Zones Defined but not Taxes (yellow), and Not 
Configured (red).
 

Chapter 5
[ 149 ]
To create a new zone definition, click on the insert button. Then, type the zone name 
and a description of the zone. In Description, indicate the purpose for which you 
have created the zone, for example, for shipping to the Dhaka division. Click on the 
insert button to save the zone.
The status of the zone will be shown as Not Configured (red) after creating the zone 
definition. You need to configure it by adding geo zones to it. Select the zone, and 
click on the details button to list the geo zones under this zone definition.
Click on the insert button to add a new geo zone to the zone definition. A New Sub 
Zone box will be shown. Select the country and the zone from the drop-down list, 
and click on the insert button. The zones must be defined beforehand. You can add 
multiple geo zones from multiple countries. For example, you may create a Zero Tax 
zone and include all geo zones where you don't need to add taxes.

Taxes 
As discussed earlier, taxes can be applied to a specific zone definition. Therefore, first 
create a zone definition for tax purposes. Tax Classes are typically used to differentiate 
between the types of tax calculations that apply to a given product. Typical tax classes 
would include: Taxable Goods, Non-Taxable Goods, GST-Only, and so on. You can 
see a list of tax classes via Locations/Taxes | Tax Classes. 
Creating a Tax Class
To create a tax class, go to Locations/Taxes | Tax Classes, and click on the new tax 
class button. Now, enter a title and description for this tax class. Click insert to save 
the tax class.
Assigning Tax Classes
When entering new products via Catalog | Categories/Products, it is necessary to 
select the appropriate tax class for that product. Otherwise, taxes won't be calculated 
appropriately during checkout. To assign a tax class, select the appropriate tax 
class from the Tax Class drop-down list. The result of changing the tax class is 
immediately reflected in the Products Price (Gross) field.
 

Chapter 5
[ 151 ]
Instead of assigning a tax class for each product, you can assign a default tax class for 
a product type. This will apply a consistent tax class to all the products of the same 
type. For example, Music may be tax free. So, it will be wise to set the default tax 
class as Non-Taxable Goods for Music product type.
Before assigning a default tax class to a product type you need to identify the Tax 
Class ID number. To identify the Tax class ID, do the following:
1.	 From Locations/Taxes | Tax Classes, select a tax class and click edit. 
2.	 Now, look at the URL in the browser address bar. You will find something 
that looks like: &tID=2, which mean Tax class ID number is 2. 
Once you get the Tax class ID, it is time to set that ID in the product type's default tax 
class field. To do this:
1.	 Go to Catalog | Product Types. 
2.	 Select the product type from the list, for example Product – Music, and click 
on Edit Layout. 
3.	 Click on Product Price Tax Class Default - When adding new products? 
4.	 Enter the number of the tax class ID determined above (that is, 2). 
5.	 Click on the update button to save the setting.

Creating a Tax Rate
Creating a tax class will not automatically add taxes to the products sold. You have 
to create tax rates for the specific zones. 
You can create a tax rate for a zone, for example Dhaka, via Locations/Taxes | Tax 
Rates and clicking on the new tax rate button. You have to define the following 
information in the New Tax Rate box:
Tax Class Title: Select a tax class from the drop-down list. The tax classes 
you have defined earlier will be shown in this list. If you do not find an 
appropriate tax class, go back to the Locations/Taxes | Tax Classes page, 
and define a new tax class.
Zone: Select a zone from this drop-down list. Zones you have defined earlier 
will be listed here. The Tax Rate you are defining will be applicable for the 
zone you select in this drop-down list.
Tax Rate (%): Define the Tax Rate percentage that will be applied to  
the products.
Description: Type a description of the Tax Rate in this field. This will explain 
why it was created and where it will be used.
Priority: Set a priority for Tax Rate. You may have several tax rates for 
a zone. In that case, tax rates with the same priority will be added to the 
product price. On the other hand, tax rates with different priorities will be 
compounded. That means a lower numbered tax rate will be applied first, 
then the next priority tax rate will be applied to the resulting amount.

address zone.
Using Multiple Currencies
Localization | Currencies screen allows us to add new currencies or edit existing 
ones. The predefined currencies in this module are U.S. Dollar (default), Euro, GB 
Pound, Australian Dollar and Canadian Dollar. You can add a new currency, or 
edit an existing one. 
Adding a New Currency
By default, only five currencies are defined in Zen Cart. You may need to add 
other currencies, if you want to trade in those currencies, or want to show prices in 
those currencies. To add a new currency, click on the new currency button in the 
Localization | Currencies screen. 
 

Localization of Zen Cart
[ 154 ]
In the new currency screen, you need to enter the following information: 
Title: This is the name of the new currency, as in Canadian Dollar, Mexican 
Peso or Bangladeshi Taka. 
Code: This is the three-character ISO 4217 international name for the 
currency –CAD for Canadian Dollar, MXN for Mexican Peso, USD for US 
Dollar, JPY for Japanese Yen, BDT for Bangladeshi Taka, and so on. Note that 
to use the automated currency conversion feature, this code must be correct.
Symbol Left and Symbol Right: If you need to display some symbol to the 
left or the right side of the currency amount, you need to type that symbol 
in this box. If no symbol appears before or after the amount (as in CA$ for 
Canadian Dollar), leave these fields blank. 
Decimal Point: This is where you indicate the symbol that appears between 
the whole and fractional amounts of a currency. For U.S. and Canadian 
dollars, this is a period; in some countries it is a comma. 
Thousands Point: This is where you indicate the symbol that appears 
between the figures of a currency, in thousands. For U.S. and Canadian 
dollars, this is a comma; in some countries it is a period.
Decimal Places: This indicates the number of decimal places that appear to 
the right for this currency. The U.S. and Canadian dollars have two digits 
after the decimal point. Some currencies may have others, such as zero,  
four or six.
Value: This is the value of the other currency relative to the default currency 
of our store. Our default currency should have a value of exactly 1. If you 
are going to use the automatic conversion feature (see the update currencies 
button below), then you can simply leave this field blank (or enter zero, both 
are the same) and let the website update the value. 
Set as default (requires a manual update of currency values): If this is the 
default currency for this store, you need to check this box. Note that this may 
require some manual changes, as indicated in the box. Thus, you might want 
to set this before loading any pricing data.
After you finish entering the new information, click on the insert button to save this 
new currency entry.
Currency Conversion
Zen Cart has a built-in facility to update currency exchange rates from the exchange 
rate server. For this to work, all currencies defined in our shop must use the correct 
ISO 4217 codes in the code column.

Chapter 5
[ 155 ]
To update currencies, click on the update currencies button. The site will request 
current exchange rate values from various conversion sites on the Internet for all of 
the currencies that have a correct ISO 4217 code. Within a few seconds, your shop 
will obtain current values, and automatically update the exchange rates.
Rates that are correctly converted will be listed with a green background at the 
top of the page. Rates that were not correctly converted will be listed with a red 
background. Zen Cart shop will try more than one converter if it has failed in 
converting a particular currency. If you see a red item after updating currencies, you 
have to pay attention to it. It may be caused by misspelling the ISO 4217 code for that 
currency. Currencies that were not correctly updated because of the unavailability of 
exchange rates at the exchange rate server will have to be manually updated using 
the edit feature. 
If you do not wish to use the automatic conversion feature, you can set the 
conversion rate manually by selecting the currency and clicking edit button. From 
Localization | Currencies screen, you can see the sample conversion rates. Note that 
these are sample values; you need to know the exact conversion rate at a given point 
in time, as currency conversion rates can fluctuate. 
Editing a Currency
If you only need to correct the exchange rate, you can use the update currencies 
button to change all the conversions on our website. If, however the automatic 
conversion does not work for some reason (for example, you entered Russian Rubles 
using code RUS instead of RUB), you would need to change that. To do this:
1.	 Click on the line showing the currency that you want to change.  
A right-arrow will appear in the action column. 
 

Localization of Zen Cart
[ 156 ]
2.	 Now click on the edit button. A series of entry fields, the same as provided 
for the add new currency button, will appear, but this time those fields will 
be loaded with their current values.
3.	 Change any field as required. 
4.	 Once you have finished, click on the update button to save your changes. 
5.	 If you decide not to save the changes, click on cancel to keep the original 
values intact. 
Deleting an Existing Currency
If you no longer want a particular currency, you can delete the currency as follows:
1.	 Click on the line showing the currency you want to delete. A right-arrow will 
appear in the action column.
2.	 Click on the delete button. You will be asked to confirm if you want to delete 
the currency. 
3.	 Click on the delete button again to delete the currency, or click the cancel 
button if you do not wish to delete it. 
Hiding the Currencies box
If you only operate with one currency, the US Dollar for example, you may wish to 
delete all other currencies and set the exchange value to 1. 
With only one currency in use, you will most likely want to stop the currency 
selection box from being displayed. 
To do this:
1.	 Click on Tools | Layout Boxes Controller. 
2.	 Find sideboxes/currencies.php in the list. It may appear at the bottom. 
3.	 Click on it, and then click on edit and set both Left/Right Column Status and 
Single Column Status to OFF. 
4.	 Finally, click Update.

Languages
Zen Cart has a multi-lingual feature which you can use to provide multiple 
languages for your online shop. This feature allows us to add and translate the 
Zen Cart interface into new languages. By default, the store will be shown in the 
English language. You can add another language and translate the strings into that 
language. When you activate this new language, Zen Cart shop will be displayed in 
that language. The following sections describe how to convert a Zen Cart shop into a 
multi-lingual shop.
Using Character Sets
You can set locales for the site from the language file. For each language, there is a 
file named after that language. For example, for the English language, you will find 
the includes/languages/english.php file. For viewing a locale, open this file in 
your favorite text editor, and find the following line:
@setlocale(LC_TIME, 'en_US.ISO_8859-1');
For the English language, the locale is set to en_US.ISO_8859-1. For other 
languages, it may be different. For example, for the Bangla language it is bn_BD. 
For each language, you can set the character set encoding. The character set encoding 
needs to be set correctly, otherwise, the language characters shown may be wrong. 
To change the character set, find the following line:
define('CHARSET', 'iso-8859-1');
For the English language, the character set ISO-8859-1 may work fine, but for 
languages that use Unicode or some other encoding, you must set the appropriate 
character set. For example, to use the Bangla language, the character set must be set 
to UTF-8.
Creating a New Language
You can add a new language from the Localization | Languages screen. Click on 
the new language button on this screen, and a form will appear. Now, enter the 
following information in the form: 
Name: This is the name of the language, probably best expressed in itself, for 
example, Francais for French, Español for Spanish, Deutsch for German, and 
so on. 
Code: This is ISO 639 two-letter language code; for example, en for English, 
fr for Francais, es for Español, bn for Bangla, and so on.  
•

Localization of Zen Cart
[ 158 ]
Image: This would be a small icon used to identify the language. This would 
most likely be a .gif image of the national flag for a country commonly 
associated with that language. 
Directory: This is the directory where the translated .php source files for 
this language are located. For example, if www.example.com is running Zen 
Cart, and its files are located in the zencart directory, then the directory 
for English is located at http://www.example.com/zencart/includes/ 
languages/english. The value for other languages needs to be changed to 
the appropriate values. 
Sort order: This is the order in which the languages should appear in. Lower 
numbers are shown higher in the front-end. 
Set as default: Check this box if this is the default language for your shop.  
Once you have provided this information, click on the insert button to add the new 
language. Alternatively, click on the cancel button if you change your mind.
Although you can create a language without uploading the language files to the 
appropriate directories, the language will not work until you do so. Therefore, 
before creating a new language in the Localization | Languages screen, you need 
to download a language pack from Zen Cart's website and copy those files to the 
includes/languages/ folder with the language name.
•
•
•
•
 

Chapter 5
[ 159 ]
Before creating a new language, make sure that the following files and directories are 
uploaded to the appropriate places:
includes/languages/<language_name>.php 
includes/languages/<language_name>/* 
admin/includes/languages/<language_name>.php 
admin/includes/languages/<language_name>/* 
includes/templates/template_default/buttons/<language_name>/ 
Replace <language_name> with the name of your language. Also remember that 
although most of the files go in the includes/languages directory, language-
specific buttons need to be placed in the includes/templates/template_default/
buttons/<language_name> folder.
Editing a Language
To change information about an existing language, do the following:
1.	 Click on the named language so that the right-arrow appears in the  
Action column.
2.	 Click on the edit button. 
3.	 Now edit the settings. The fields on the screen are the same for adding  
a language. 
4.	 After you have finished editing, click on the update button to save the 
changes, or click on cancel to discard them. 
Remember that editing a language and translating a language is not the 
same. You can translate a language by editing the individual language 
files, that you have uploaded to the language directories.
Deleting a Language
To remove a language, click on the named language so that the right-arrow appears 
in the Action column, and then click on the delete button. If this is not the default 
language, you will be asked for confirmation. Click on the delete button again to 
delete the language, or click on cancel if you do not wish to delete this language. If 
this is the default language, only the cancel button will appear, as you cannot delete 
the default language.

Localization of Zen Cart
[ 160 ]
Remember that deleting a language from the list does not delete the 
language files automatically. If you want to delete the language files too, 
you need to delete those manually.
Translating Language Files
At present, more than 25 language packs are available for download from the Zen 
Cart website. Packs for most of the major languages are available, including Arabic, 
French, Spanish, Portuguese, Norwegian, Japanese, Simplified Chinese, and so on. 
If you do not find your language pack there, don't be upset. You can always create 
your own language pack.
Zen Cart gives you the flexibility to translate any language. In fact, translating 
language strings in Zen Cart becomes very easy if you understand the basics of its 
language structure. In Zen Cart, all of the language strings are defined as constants 
in the language files.
The best way to start translating the language files is to copy the English language 
files into a new directory. Then, open each file and translate the strings.
For each language, there is a file in the includes/languages/ directory named after 
the language name. For example, you will find english.php. Rename this file to 
your language name, for instance, bangla.php.
First change the locale in @setlocale(LC_TIME, 'en_US.ISO_8859-1'); line. For 
Bangla, change en_US.ISO_8859-1 to bn_BD. Remember that you have to change the 
string inside the quotation mark keeping the constants in UPPERCASE unchanged.
You can also change the date format via the DATE_FORMAT_SHORT and DATE_FORMAT 
settings. For some languages, dates are expressed as m/d/y and for some, it is d/m/Y. 
Set the appropriate format for your language.
The language strings for each front-end file are located in similarly-named .php files. 
For example, language strings used in create_account.php page are located in  
the includes/languages/english/create_account.php file. You will find lines 
such as:
define('NAVBAR_TITLE', 'Create an Account');
You have to translate only the second part, that is, Create an Account. Make sure that 
the quotation marks are intact after translating the strings. You will need to change 
all of the strings in all of the files, one by one.
 

Chapter 5
[ 161 ]
Remember to select UTF-8 or Unicode encoding when saving the 
modified language file, if that file contains Unicode characters. Saving 
these .php files in ANSI format will degenerate the Unicode strings.
Order Status
Every order has a status. For example, when an order is placed by a customer, it is 
assigned either a pending status, or a processing status. This may be expressed in 
different ways for different languages. Therefore, Zen Cart allows us to add new 
order status entries, edit existing order status name entries, or delete an order status 
name entry, in the Localization | Order Status screen. 
By default, there are four order status defined:
Pending(default)
Processing
Delivered
Update
•
•
•
•
 

Localization of Zen Cart
[ 162 ]
When an order is placed, Pending is the default status of that order. Of course, you 
can set the default order status for each type of payments while configuring the 
payment modules. Processing means that the order is currently being processed, 
and will be shipped soon. Once the order has been shipped and delivered to the 
customer, you may set the status to Delivered. Similarly, a status of Update can be 
assigned to any order when you are updating it for some reason. You may like to 
inform the customer of any order status change. This is done from the order  
editing screen.
Adding a New Order Status
You may need to add a new order status. For example, you may want to add a 
Shipped status, so that you can inform the customer when their order has been 
shipped. Adding this order status is simple. You can add a new order status from the 
Localization | Order Status screen.
 

Chapter 5
[ 163 ]
To add a new order status, click on the insert button. A box allowing you to enter 
the name of the status will appear. You will find one or more text boxes to type the 
name of that status in all installed languages. Give a meaningful name to the order 
status. If this is the default status (applied to all new orders), check the set as default 
checkbox. Click on the insert button to save this new status, or click on the cancel 
button if you want to discard the changes. 
Editing an Existing Status
You may need to edit an existing order status to reflect the actual meaning of that 
status. For example, you may want to change Pending to Waiting for Payment, to 
explain why the order is pending. For other installed and supported languages, you 
also need to edit the order status. 
 

Localization of Zen Cart
[ 164 ]
To edit an existing order status, select the status and click on the edit button. The 
Edit Orders Status box will be shown. Again here, you will see one or more text 
boxes, each showing a language icon alongside it. You can change the name of that 
order status for any or all of the languages in these text boxes. ������������������������
If you want to set that 
status as the default status for upcoming orders, check  the Set as default checkbox. 
Once you have finished editing the status names, click the update button to save 
your changes, or click cancel to discard the changes.
Order statuses can be very useful for your online business. First, plan 
the status of the orders according to your selling process. Then add 
appropriate order status in Localization | Order Status. For example, you 
may add Returned and Refunded statuses to indicate that the product 
has been returned for a refund, and has subsequently been refunded.
Summary
In this chapter, we have discussed important configuration options for localizing Zen 
Cart. First, we discussed how to define countries and zones. Then you learned about 
defining zones for taxes, tax classes, tax rates, and assigning tax rates to specific 
zones. We also discussed adding, editing and updating currencies in a Zen Cart shop 
that uses multiple currencies. You also learned about creating and editing languages 
for the Zen Cart shop and translating language files into another language. 
With this knowledge in localizing the Zen Cart shop, you will be able to make the 
shop online after localizing it. In the next chapter, we will discuss how to promote 
your products and maintain public relationships through Zen Cart tools. 
 

Promotions and  
Public Relations
Every online store's success depends on promotion and public relations. As a 
marketer, the more you promote your products to the target market, the greater the 
chance of getting more customers. Good online stores have built-in promotional 
activities and public relations tools. Zen Cart has a set of tools for promotion and 
public relations. In this chapter, you are going to be introduced to these tools.
On completion of this chapter, you will be able to:
Use Zen Cart's promotional tools such as banner ads, discounts, salemaker, 
cross-sell and up-sell, specials, and featured products.
Use gift certificates and coupons to attract more customers.
Use newsletters and product notifications to keep in constant communication 
with your customers and reward their loyalty.
Optimize your site for search engines.
By now, you should have learned how to add products to your catalogue and how to 
manage customers.
Promotions
For any business, promotion is a must and Zen Cart has built-in tools for 
promotional activities. Features such as banner ads, promotional discounts, 
salemaker, products on special list, cross selling, and up selling can be used 
effectively for promotions. In this section, we are going to discuss how these features 
can help to promote your products.

Banner Ads
If you have been operating a shop or have started building a shop using Zen Cart, 
you will know what a banner ad is. A banner ad is a form of advertising on the Web 
used frequently to display product advertisement into a web page. Clicking on a 
banner ad takes you to a site or a webpage.
Banner ad tool in Zen Cart can be used for advertising both external and internal 
products. You can display any banner ad through this tool. In Zen Cart, there are 
three places where you can display banner ads. 
You can control banner ads in your Zen Cart shop from Tools | Banner Manager. 
From here, you can add, delete, and edit the banners:
To add a new banner, click the new banner button.
To edit an existing one and change its link, its picture, and so on, click on the 
banner you want to change, and click the edit button.
You can enable and disable any particular banner by clicking on the red/
green status button.
Types of Banners
Two types of banners can be used in Zen Cart: sidebox and wide banners. Sidebox 
banners are just like a sidebox suitable to be shown in the left or right column. Wide 
banners span the width of your page. 
Each banner is assigned to a group, and you can give it any name. A group contains 
multiple banners and one from the group will be randomly shown at a time . For 
each group, you also need to indicate the position where it is to be displayed. This is 
done from Configuration | Layout Settings. 
•
•
•
 

Chapter 6
[ 167 ]
By default, Zen Cart has three predefined banner groups: BannersAll,  
SideBox-Banners, and Wide-Banners.
Banner statistics are also tracked on a day-to-day basis. You will see the banner 
views and clicks statistics for the last three days on this window. 
Displaying Banner Groups
Each group is assigned to be displayed in a position on the shop front-end. You 
define this position by editing the Banner Display Groups position group names 
under Configuration | Layout Settings.
For sidebox banners, only one banner group on a particular sidebox can be displayed 
at a time. For others, you can have multiple banner groups.
By default, the BannersAll group is assigned to be displayed in SideBox—BannersAll 
position. This means that banners from the BannersAll group will be shown in this 
sidebox, one at a time. SideBox-Banners group is assigned to two sidebox locations 
—SideBox-Banner Box and SideBox—Banner Box 2. Wide-Banners group is assigned 
to be shown in footer position 3.
Remember that, wide banners are only suitable for showing at the header 
and footer positions. Assigning such a banner to a sidebox will create 
a layout problem, and is hence should be avoided. Similarly, assigning 
sidebox banners to the header or footer positions will result in too much 
blank space at both sides of the banners.

Designing Banners
Banner sizes are of your choice. However, there are standard sizes of banners to be 
used on websites. You should use these standard sizes for consistency. But you can 
make them any size that you want as long as those sizes match your template layout.
Standard sizes for banners and their suitable display position are shown in the 
following table:

Adding/Editing a Banner
You can add/edit banners from Tools | Banner Manager from the administration 
panel. To edit the properties of a banner, select the banner and click on the edit 
button. For adding a new banner, click on the new banner button. This will open the 
following screen:
You have to fill or edit the following information in the banner editing/adding screen:
Banner Status: Select Active or Not Active to indicate the banner status. If 
Not Active is selected, then the banner will not be shown.
Banner New Window: Indicates whether the banner will open in a new 
window when clicked, or open in the same window. Selecting Yes will open 
the banner in a new window.

Banner Title: Type the title of the banner. Each banner must have a title.
Banner URL: Type the URL to which the browser will be redirected when 
the banner ad is clicked. 
Banner Group: Select the group for this banner. If you do not see appropriate

banners/ .This directory must exist at the server and should be writable. 
HTML Text: If you want to show a HTML banner instead of an image 
banner, type HTML text in this box. Remember that the HTML text will take 
precedence over the image banner. This means that if you type HTML text 
and provide the image banner link, only the HTML banner will be displayed. 
The clicks for the HTML text banners will not be counted.
Sort Order-banner_box_all: As there are multiple banners under the banner 
_box_all category, a sort order or each banner needs to be specified here. The 
banners will be displayed in that sort order – a lower order banner will be 
displayed first. For other categories, this field does not carry any importance.
Scheduled at: You can schedule a banner for a specified date. Select the date 
from which you want to start showing the banner. Keeping it blank will 
immediately activate that banner.
Expires on:  Select the date on which you want to stop showing the banner. If 
you want to show the banner for a number of impressions, type the number 
of impressions in the impressions/views field. You have to fill either the 
expiry date or the number of impressions/views. If you don't want to stop 
showing the banner, keep the expiry field blank.

Promotional Discounts
Promotional discounts are often used in online shops. You can offer special discounts 
to customers on different occasions such as the New Year, Christmas, and so on. Zen 
Cart has built-in tools to configure promotional discounts on products in specific 
categories or on selected products. You can also configure the promotion start and 
end dates.
Special prices can be configured from Catalog | Products Price Manager. First, select 
a category to show the products under it. Once the product list is shown, select the 
product for which you want to assign a special price. Then click on the install button 
to the right of the Special Price Info field.
 

Promotions and Public Relations
[ 172 ]
A special screen will display a list of products in the Product list box. Select a 
product from the Product list box. Then assign the special price in the Special Price 
field. You can assign a new price for the product, or assign a percentage discount 
(say 20%) in this field. Then select the start date at the Available Date field and the 
end date at the Expiry Date field. If you want to start the discount immediately, 
keep the Available Date field blank. Similarly, if you want to keep the discount 
continuing for an indefinite period, keep the Expiry Date field blank.
Although you can keep a discount for an unlimited period, it is not a 
good idea to keep it open-ended, as it actually attracts fewer customers. 
Always assign an Expiry Date so that customers feel an urge to buy it 
immediately.
Cross-Selling and Up-Selling
Cross-selling, up-selling and better-together are some of the sales techniques used 
widely in online shops. Although Zen Cart has no built-in capability of doing these, 
you can implement these features by adding contributed modules. In this section, you 
are going to learn how to implement cross-sell, up-sell and better-together features.
 

Chapter 6
[ 173 ]
Cross-Selling
The idea of cross-selling is to sell additional products or services to a customer. 
Cross-selling may be of different forms. For example, while you are selling a novel, 
you may try to sell other novels by the same author; while selling a computer, you 
may try to sell other accessories; or when you are selling a product which requires 
maintenance, you may sell servicing and extended warranty along with that product. 
The idea of cross-selling is to sell relevant products—not substitutes for that product.
Zen Cart has no built-in capability for cross-selling. However, several modules for 
cross-selling are available at the Zen Cart website. You can use one of those and 
start cross-selling. We are going to discuss one such module—Cross Sell by Tony 
Corbett. This module allows you to add up to 6 products as relevant in your product 
information page.
The installation process of the module is described in the Install.txt file in this 
package. Follow the instructions for installation. First, you have to apply a patch (in 
products_xsell.sql) from Tools | Install SQL Patch. Then, upload the files in to 
the appropriate directories. Replace YOUR_TEMPLATE with your template's name, for 
example, packt. Then you have to edit two files:
Add define('TEXT_XSELL_PRODUCTS', 'We Also Recommend :'); just 
above the final ?>  in includes/languages/english/product_info.php 
and save it into includes/languages/english/packt/product_info.php.
Edit the product-info template file /includes/templates/template_
default/ tpl_product_info_display.php and insert the following code 
at the point where you wish the Cross-Sell box to appear. Usually, best at the 
end of the file:
<?php
require($template->get_template_dir ('tpl_modules_xsell_products.
php', DIR_WS_TEMPLATE, $current_page_base,'templates'). '/' . 
'tpl_modules_xsell_products.php');
?>
Save the file as /includes/templates/packt/ tpl_product_info_dis-
play.php. Add the above codes for any other product type for which you 
wish to enable cross-sell display (for example, files such as tpl_product_mu-
sic_info_display.php).
After successful installation, you can configure the options for this module from:
Configuration | Minimum Values | Display Cross-Sell Products - This is 
the minimum number of configured Cross-Sell products required in order to 
cause the Cross-Sell information to be displayed. 
•
•
•
 

Promotions and Public Relations
[ 174 ]
Configuration | Maximum Values | Display Cross-Sell Products:This is the 
maximum number of configured Cross-Sell products to be displayed.
Configuration | Product Info | Cross-Sell Products Columns per Row:  
This refers to the Cross-Sell Products Columns to be displayed per Row.  
A value of 0 means off. You can set a sort order.
Configuration | Product Info | Cross-Sell - Display Prices?: Select whether 
to display prices in the list of cross-sell products.
Once you have configured these options, you can start using the Cross-Sell module 
from Catalog | Cross Sell Products. The screen will list all the available products. 
Select a product for which you want to assign cross-sells. Another screen will appear, 
where the selected product will be shown at the top, and you will have the option 
to check the products that you want to sell with the selected product. Select all the 
related products and click the update button.
Once you have configured the cross-sells, you can work on the product details page. 
Click on the product for which you have configured Cross-Sell, for example, Matrox 
G200 MMS. Another centerbox, which looks like the following, will be displayed at 
the bottom of product description page:
•
•
•
 

Chapter 6
[ 175 ]
One of the limitations of the Cross-Sell module is that the cross selling is configured 
one way. If you configure product A to sell with product B and product C, you will 
get cross-sell listing only for product A. When a customer clicks on product C, she 
will not see product A as a recommendation. This can be solved by using Cross Sell 
- Just Another Cross Sell Mod, available for download from the Zen Cart website. 
The Read_me.txt file with this package describes the installation of this Cross-Sell 
module. Before installing this module, you must have installed Cross-Sell module 
first. Upload all the files to the admin and js folders. Then, apply sql_patch.sql 
through Tools | Install SQL Patches. With the patching of SQL, the installation 
would be complete, and you will see one option in Configuration | Cross Sell and a 
set of options under Catalog | Advanced Cross Sell.
 

Promotions and Public Relations
[ 176 ]
In Configuration | Cross sell, you will find the field Input type to be used in form. 
If you set this to id, you have to use the product ID when you insert new cross-sell in 
the cross-sell form at Catalog | Advanced Cross-Sell. If you set this to model, you 
have to use the product model when you insert a new Cross-Sell. You can insert all 
Cross-Sells from Catalog | Advanced Cross-Sell. The screen looks like this:
Up-Selling
Now, let's talk about up-selling. You may have seen up-selling several times in 
your life. When you go to buy a dress, the salesperson may recommend you buy a 
dress that is of a better quality and higher price. So, up-selling is a sales technique 
where a salesperson attempts to have the consumer purchase more expensive items, 
upgrades, or other add-ons in an attempt to make a more profitable sale. 
Upselling in Zen Cart can be implemented by the Cart Upsell/Cross sell module 
available from the Zen Cart website's download section. The installation process for 
this module is described in the install.txt file. First, you have to upload all the 
files as per the directory structure. Then, edit the tpl_shopping_cart_default.php 
file and add the following code before the last </div> tag:
<?php 
require(DIR_WS_MODULES . zen_get_module_directory(FILENAME_CART_
UPSELL)); 
?>
The last thing you have to do is edit the includes/modules/YOUR_TEMPLATE/ 
cart_upsell.php file, and replace YOUR_TEMPLATE with the name of your 
template, for example, packt. You will find the following set of variables defined in 
this file:
 

Chapter 6
[ 177 ]
// number of upsells/xsells to display
define('NUMBER_UPSELLS_DISPLAY', '9');
define('NUMBER_XSELLS_DISPLAY', '9');
// number of upsells/xsells columns to display
define('UPSELLS_COLUMNS_DISPLAY', '3');
define('XSELLS_COLUMNS_DISPLAY', '3');
// upsells/xsells box title to display
define('UPSELLS_TITLE_DISPLAY', 'Customers who selected the items in 
your cart also chose...');
define('TEXT_XSELL_PRODUCTS', 'To go with the items in your cart we 
also recommend...');
Among these some are for displaying the number of up-sells, and some are for 
defining texts for the up-sell headings. Change these to suit your needs. 
If you have installed the Cross-Sell module, edit the includes/languages/
english/packt/product_info.php file, and add the following line (if it is already 
not there):
define('TEXT_XSELL_PRODUCTS', 'We Also Recommend For: ');
By doing this, your installation is complete. Now, you can see the up-sell feature 
in the product info page. Just below the product description, you will find the 
'Customers who purchased this item also purchased…' box as shown here: 
 

Promotions and Public Relations
[ 178 ]
Don't panic if you do not see the box for up-sell after installing this 
module. If you have no successful record of a completed order, then the 
'also purchased' box will not be displayed. As there is no buying history 
based on which "customers who purchased this item also purchased..." 
can be displayed. Add some orders first, and then you will see this box.
The single configuration of this module is setting the number of columns per row to 
display in the up-sell box which is done under Configuration | Product Info. Set the 
appropriate number in the Also Purchased Products Columns per Row field.  You 
can also change this value by editing the includes/modules/YOUR_TEMPLATE/ 
cart_upsell.php file.
Better-together
If you have ever visited Amazon.com, you will know what 'Better Together' is. 
Whenever you view a product description, the 'Better Together' title will suggest 
more products to be bundled with your chosen product. Packt online shop  
(www.packtpub.com/books) also suggests better-together products. You can 
implement this feature in Zen Cart by using the Better Together module written by 
Scott Wilson and available from the Zen Cart website's download section.
For installing this module, upload all the files as per their directory structures. Then, 
login to the administration panel. In Modules | Order Total, you will see Better 
Together listed along with all the other modules available. Click on Better Together 
to highlight the module, and click on Install. Then, you have to assign a sort order. 
You may also decide whether to show taxes with the Better Together offer, or 
whether taxes will be calculated based on the better together price offer.
One of the pitfalls of this module is that you cannot configure the discounts from  
the Administration panel. For this, you need to edit the includes/modules/ 
order_total/ot_better_together.php file. You have to provide links for the 
products and mention discounts. Find function setup() at line 497 in this file. You 
will see some commented examples. First, uncomment the examples and provide 
your product ids and discounts. You may add the discounts as follows:
// Buy product 10, get product 11 at 50% off 
$this->add_prod_to_prod(10, 11, "%", 50); 
// Buy product 21, get one free 
$this->add_prod_to_prod(21, 21, "%", 100); 
 

Chapter 6
[ 179 ]
// Buy product 1, get an item from category 3 free 
$this->add_prod_to_cat(1, 3, "%", 100); 
// Buy an item from category 1, get an item from category 2 free
$this->add_cat_to_cat(1, 2, "%", 100); 
// Buy item 14, get a second one free.
$this->add_twoforone_prod(14);
// Buy any item from category 3, get a second identical one free
$this->add_twoforone_cat(19);
// buy two and get one free
$this->add_prod_to_prod(11, 12, "%", 100); 
//buy 14 & 15, get 50% discount on 15
$this->add_prod_to_prod(14, 15, "%", 50); 
// buy item 16 & 17, get 25% discount on item 17
$this->add_prod_to_prod(16, 17, "%", 25); 
         
//buy two items from category 2 & 3, and get another item from these 
categories free
$this->add_cat_to_cat(2, 3, "%", 100); 
      
//buy two and get another item at 50% discount
$this->add_prod_to_prod(22, 25, "%", 50);
After adding the discounts, save the file. Now, you need to edit tpl_product_info_
display.php to advertise your discounts. Add the following code in this file below 
the product description block:
<?php 
require($template->get_template_dir('/tpl_better_together_marketing.
php',DIR_WS_TEMPLATE, $current_page_base,'templates'). '/tpl_better_
together_marketing.php');
?>

[ 180 ]
Save the file in the includes/templates/<Your Template>/templates directory. 
Replace <Your Template> with your custom template directory, for example, packt. 
Be sure that you have installed tpl_better_together_marketing.php in this same 
directory. Now, the better together module is ready for use. Browse to a product and 
you will see the following:
Remember that you have configured to give DVD free with a Matrox G200 MMS. You 
can make it vivid by adding the following declaration in the stylesheet.css file:
#betterTogetherDiscountPolicy {

font-size: 1.5em;

Now, the better together discounts screen will look like this:
When you order both Unreal Tournament and Microsoft Internet Keyboard PS/2 
together, you get a 50% discount on Microsoft Internet Keyboard PS/2. This discount 
will be shown in the Order Total Section in the Payment Information Step (Step 2) 
during checkout:

SaleMaker
Online shops often introduce a sale for special events, or a season, to attract  
more customers, or to clear stock quickly. For example, a book shop may offer  
a 35% discount on all books for the New Year. Zen Cart has an excellent tool  
called SaleMaker to manage such sales. You can access SaleMaker from  
Catalog | SaleMaker.
In the SaleMaker screen you will see the list of sales including the deduction 
amount, the Start Date and the End Date, and the status of those sales. Selecting 
one Sale will give you the option to edit, copy to or delete that sale. You will also get 
information about that sale by selecting it.
You can add a new sale by clicking on the new sale button. It opens a screen that 
looks like this:
 

Chapter 6
[ 183 ]
Suppose that you want to offer special discounts on all books during Christmas for 
two weeks. Type the sale name, Christmas Book Discount, in the SaleName field. 
Then, type the discount. You can specify the discount as a percentage of the price, or 
as an absolute amount. For example, if you want to offer a 35% discount, type 35 in 
the Deduction field, and select Percent from the Type drop-down list. You will get 
three options here: Deduct Amount, Percent, and New Price. This means that you can 
specify a new price for the product. In the product price range field, you may specify 
the product price range for which the discount is applicable. For example, you may 
want to apply a 35% discount on books whose price ranges from $ 30 to $ 150. 
Some products may already be having specials. In that case, the sale discount to 
be applied can be configured from the If product is a special drop-down list. You 
have three options: Ignore Specials Price – apply to product price and replace 
special, Ignore Sale condition – No Sale applied when Special exists, and Apply 
SaleDeduction to Specials Price – Otherwise Apply to Price. Choose one option 
from these.
Then select the Start Date and the End Date of that sale. If your sale is open-ended, 
keep the End Date blank. Keeping the Start Date field blank will activate that  
sale immediately.
You may apply the sale to a whole product catalog or some specific categories. If the 
sale is only for books, then check the Books category. Remember that applying the 
sale to a parent category automatically applies it to its child categories. Therefore,  
if you apply a sale to the Books category, that will also be effective for other  
sub-categories under Books. While selecting categories, you can also see the 
categories that are already on sale. A more link will be shown beside such categories 
to display the details of the products on sale.
Special, Featured, and New Products
By this time, you may have already noticed on the homepage a center box that shows 
New Products for that month. It also shows a center box called Monthly Specials 
for that month. New products are displayed according to the date when they were 
added to the product catalog. But for Specials, you have to specify the products that 
fall under that category. Specials often have discounted prices. This is another way of 
attracting customers.

[ 184 ]
You can decide whether New Products, Special Products, Featured Products, and 
Upcoming Products center boxes should be displayed in the main page or not. To do 
this, select Configuration | Index Listing from the Administration panel and find 
the following options:
Show New Products on Main Page 
Show Featured Products on Main Page 
Show Special Products on Main Page 
Show Upcoming Products on Main Page 
A value of 0 means that the center box will not be displayed. If you want to show 
the box, just type the sort order. A lower sort order will display that center box in a 
higher position.
As said earlier, new products are chosen based on the date they were added to the 
catalog. However, you can define what the New Products, Featured Products, and 
Specials Products mean. Select Configuration | Maximum Values and find the 
following options:
Products on Special: From here, you can configure the number of products 
that will be displayed on the Specials box. The default is 9, and you can 
change it to another value.
New Products Module: From here, you can define the number of new 
products which will be displayed in the New Products Module. 
Upcoming Products: Assign the number of upcoming products to be 
displayed. The default is 10.
New Products Listing- Number Per Page: Assign the number of products to 
be listed per page. The default is 10.

Products, 1 means Current Month, 7 means 7 Days, 14 means 14 days, 30 
means 30 days, and a value of 60 means 60 days, 90 means 90 days, and 120 
means 120 days. Therefore, if you want to show new products for that month 
assign a value, 30.
Special Products
You can manage Special products from Catalog | Specials. The screen will list the 
products on Specials and display their special prices. You can add, edit, or delete a 
product from Specials, or manage special prices from this screen.

expiry date. Special Price can be set as a new price or as a percent deduction (for 
example, 14.70 or 25%). Once the values are set, click on the insert button.
Featured Products
Featured products are like special products but they have no discount price. You 
can add some products to the Featured Products to draw the customers' attention to 
them. Featured Products are managed from Catalog | Featured Products. The screen 
is similar to the Specials screen. You can add a new product to the featured list by 
clicking on the new product button. Then, you have to select the product, assign an 
availability date and an expiry date.
 

Chapter 6

For a large product catalog, it's difficult to select a product from a list. For such 
product catalogs, you can add a product to the featured and specials list by clicking 
on the select button on Catalog | Specials or Catalog | Featured Products screen, 
and then typing the product id. 
New and Upcoming Products
New Products and Upcoming Products lists are built dynamically based on the 
product availability. When you add a product to the catalog, you assign Product 
Availability Date. If the product is already available, it will be shown in the New 
Products list. If it is expected to be made available in the future, then that product 
will be added in the Upcoming Products list. You can see a list of Upcoming 
Products from Catalog | Products Expected.
Gift Certificates & Discount Coupons
Gift certificates and coupons are excellent ways to attract customers to your shop and 
to make them buy your products. Zen Cart has built-in features for Gift Certificates 
and Discount Coupons.
Gift certificates are sent by the shop owner to a group of customers. Customers can 
use that certificate while buying from that shop. Gift certificates can also be sold as a 
product, where customers can use them later for purchasing products from that shop.
Discount coupons are slightly different from gift certificates. Shop owners can give 
discount coupons to both individuals and a group of customers. Customers can use 
the coupons to get a discount while purchasing products from that shop. Unlike gift 
certificates, a customer cannot buy a product using only the discount coupons.

[ 188 ]
You can configure the discount coupon options from Configuration | GV Coupons. 
Here, you can configure the default Order Status when a gift voucher has a zero 
balance. By default, it is set to Processing[2]. You may change it to Pending[1]. Also 
configure Length of the Redeem Code. Remember that the longer the redeem code, 
the more secure it is. The default value is 10, You can change it to 20 or more. You 
may also like to offer a discount coupon to new customers who sign up. If you  
want to do so, select the gift voucher in New Signup Discount Coupon ID#, and 
assign the amount you want to give through this voucher in New Signup Gift 
Voucher Amount.
Sending a Gift Certificate
As a shop owner, you can send Gift Certificates to any customer, whenever you 
want. To send a Gift certificate, go to Gift Certificates/Coupons | Mail Gift 
Certificate. The Send Gift Certificate to Customers screen will be displayed. 
 

Chapter 6

Fill in the following fields:
Customer: Select the individual customer or the appropriate group to whom 
you want to send this Gift Voucher. Options in this drop-down list are – All 
Customers, All Newsletter Subscribers, Dormant Customers (>3 months)

Customers in Past 3 Months (Regardless of Subscription Status), and then 
individual customer names. Select the appropriate option for sending the 
Gift Voucher.
Email To: If you want to send the Gift Certificate to a non-customer, then 
type his/her email address in this field. This will go to a single person. For 
sending to multiple customers, select the drop-down in Customer field.

in this field. You may type a separate address in this field.
Subject: Give a subject to your Gift Voucher email. For example, Special Gift 
from Packt Publishing.
Amount: Specify the amount you are giving to the customer by this gift 
voucher. The amount you type in this field will be in the default currency of 
the shop. Remember that your total gift amount will be the amount typed in 
this field multiplied by the number of customers you are sending it to. 
Rich Text Message: If you are using Rich Text Editor, such as HTMLArea or 
FCKEditor, then type the formatted text in this field. This field may contain 
graphics, links, and so on.
Text Only Message: As all email clients may not render the rich text 
message, it is always advisable to type the message in a text-only format. The 
message typed in this field will be shown to the text-only email clients.
Once all these fields are filled up, click on send mail to send the gift voucher to  
the customer.
Creating Gift Certificate Products
You can sell Gift Certificates through your shop, just like your other products. 
Customers who buy Gift Certificates can redeem it and pay for their purchases. They 
can also send that Gift Certificate to others. Therefore, it is a convenient way to send 
gifts to friends and family members—you send the Gift Certificate—and your friends 
and family members can buy the product of their choice.

module is enabled in Modules | Order Total, that will be displayed in the catalog. 
Customers can see it through the Gift Certificates category in the main page. 
However, you may draw attention to gift certificates on your store by creating a 
homepage graphic with a link to your Gift Certificate category. A new sidebox for 
displaying such graphics can also be used. 
Customers can buy a gift certificate just like the other products. They can add it 
to the cart and pay for it through the checkout process. When Gift Certificates are 
purchased, as an Administrator, you have to log into your administration area and 
release them. Once a Gift Certificate is released by an Administrator, funds will be 
made available to the customer.
Upon the release/approval of Gift Certificates, emails with a redemption code are 
sent to the customers. Then customers can redeem that code either by clicking on the 
link, or by keying in the code on the checkout-payment page (or the Gift Voucher 
Redemption screen). Once a gift voucher is redeemed, funds for that gift voucher 
will become available to the customers, and they can use them in future transactions. 
Customers will see their gift voucher balance in their My Account page.

Customers can use those funds for themselves, or send it to their friends and family 
members. They can email as much as they want, to various people, for the amount 
they have purchased. Whoever they email it to will receive a new redemption code 
and must follow the same redemption process. They can in turn email the code 
whoever they wish to.
Coupon Administration
In Zen Cart, discount coupons are managed from Gift Certificates/Coupons | 
Coupon Admin. The coupon list is  displayed in this screen. You can insert a new 
coupon, delete old one, send a coupon already configured, and view Report of 
coupon usage.
 

Chapter 6
[ 193 ]
You can edit, copy or delete a coupon by clicking on the edit, delete or copy button 
respectively. Click on the email button to mail a coupon to the customers. You can 
also assign restrictions on the usage of this coupon.
To create a new coupon, click on the insert button. The Discount Coupons screen 
will be displayed as follows:
The following fields have to be filled up for a new coupon:
Coupon Name: Give a short name for the coupon, for example, Happy New 
Year Discount.

Coupon Minimum Order: Specify the minimum order value for which the 
coupon will be considered valid. For example, if you want to give a 35% 
discount to customers who buy books for US$ 100 or more, the discount 
coupon cannot be used for a sale value lower than US$ 100. .
Free Shipping: You may use this coupon to give customers free shipping on 
the purchase of some products. If you want to do so, check this checkbox. 
While using the coupon for free shipping, the discount amount will be 
overridden,  that is, the customers will get only free shipping, not discounts 
on purchases.
Coupon Code: Every discount coupon needs a unique code. You may type 
your own code, or keep it blank to auto generate the code. It's better to auto 
generate the coupon code than write your own. Auto generation ensures 
uniqueness.
Uses per Coupon: Specify the number of times a coupon can be used. 
Leaving it blank implies that it can be used without limit.
Uses per Customer: Specify the number of customers can use the same 
coupon. Generally, a single coupon is for a single customer. It is better to 
keep the default value 1 in this field.
Start Date: Specify the date from which the coupon will be valid.
End Date: Specify the date the coupon will expire on. The coupon will never 
expire if you keep this field blank.
Coupon Zone Restriction: The coupon can be restricted for a specific zone. 
Select a Zone from the drop-down list. Keeping this field blank will allow the 
coupon to be used for all zones.
Once the above fields are configured, click on preview to see the discount coupon, 
and click on the confirm button to save it.
Creating a coupon does not send it to customers instantly. To send a coupon to 
customers, select that coupon, and click on the  email button in Gift Certificates/
Coupons | Coupon Admin screen.  The Discount Coupons screen will be displayed. 
Select an individual or a group of customers, just as in Gift Vouchers, type, subject 
line, and a message. Then click on the send mail button to send it to the customers.
Another way of creating similar discount coupon is to copy that coupon and change 
some properties as needed. You can copy a coupon by selecting that and then 
clicking on the copy button.
As a shop owner, you may want to see which of your discount coupons are used. 
You can see uses of discount coupons by clicking on the report button. You will be 
able to know which customer has redeemed the coupons, and on which date, and 
from which IP address.

books, limit the use of this coupon to the Books category—allow for this category 
and deny for all other categories.
Newsletters/Product Notification
Newsletters/Product notification is an excellent feature of Zen Cart for keeping 
the customers informed about new products and products of interest to them. Zen 
Cart's built-in newsletters/product notification management system allows you to 
send newsletters and product notifications to your customers as and when required. 
Effective use of this tool may boost your sales. You are going to learn about the 
newsletters/product notifications feature of Zen Cart in this section.
Product Notification Subscription
Product notifications can be sent to customers who have opted to receive them. 
While browsing products, customers can sign up for product notifications via the 
notifications sidebox. This sidebox is visible only on actual product pages (if it is 
enabled by administrator). 
 

Promotions and Public Relations
[ 196 ]
You can also subscribe to product notifications by clicking the checkboxes shown 
upon checkout success. Checking the boxes and clicking the submit button will 
allow the customers to view the notifications for a product. For this, the customers 
should have an account with the online shop. The customers can also manage the 
products for which they want to receive notifications. 
As an administrator, you can also enable/disable the Product Notification System 
for the customers. To enable/disable the Product Notification System, go to 
Configuration | Customer Details. Change the setting for Customer Product 
Notification Status to on or off. If Customer Product Notification Status is on, the 
customer will be asked about product notifications after checkout success and in 
account preferences.
Customers themselves can modify their product notification subscriptions from 
their My Account area. Click on View or change my product notification list link to 
edit the subscription to product notifications. If you have subscribed to any product 
notification, it will be shown here. You may subscribe to Global Product Notifications 
by checking the Receive notifications on all available products checkbox.
Creating Newsletters/Product Notifications
Newsletters/Product notification system is not automatic. You have to send 
newsletters/notices to the people who have subscribed to newsletters and  
product notifications.
 

Chapter 6
[ 197 ]
To send notifications to those who have signed up, go to Tools | Newsletter & 
Product Notifications Manager. Then, create a newsletter/notice by clicking new 
newsletter button, choose product notification as the module. While sending the 
notifications, it will ask you for the products which the notice applies to. Select 
products to which the notification applies and click on the send button. You may 
click on the Global button to indicate that the notification is for the whole  
product catalog.
Sending Newsletters
Newsletters also need to be created and saved first. The process of creating a 
newsletter is the same as creating a product notification, except that you have to 
select newsletter in the Module field. Then, you will see the newsletter on the Tools 
| Newsletter and Product Notification Manager screen. Select the newsletter you 
want to send, and click on the send button. Then, you have to select an audience 
to whom the newsletter will be sent. The options in this drop-down list are: All 
Newsletter Subscribers, Dormant Customers (>3 months)(Subscribers), Active 
Customers in the past 3 months (Subscribers), Active customers in the past 3 
months (Regardless of subscription status). Once a customer group is selected, click 
on the select button. A preview of the newsletter will be displayed in the next screen. 
Click on the send mail button to mail it to the customers.

Product Reviews
The Product Review system in Zen Cart can be used as a promotional tool. 
Customers registered with the shop can write reviews for a product. It also has a 
rating system. The reviews by customers help attract other customers to the product. 
You may encourage customers to write product reviews and award gift vouchers to 
top reviewers. 
Customers can write a product review while they are in the Product Details page. 
Clicking on the Write a review on this product link in the Reviews sidebox will 
open up a Reviews screen.
Select a ranking (1 to 5 stars) and write your review in the text box. Then, click on the 
submit button. Remember that customers cannot use HTML tags in writen product 
reviews. This is disabled to strengthen the security of the shop. Review needs to be a 
minimum 50 characters. Once a review is submitted, the review will be available to 
other customers only after approval by the administrator.
 

Chapter 6
[ 199 ]
As an administrator, you can approve the reviews from Catalog | Reviews. All 
product reviews are listed in this screen indicating their status. A red box indicates 
disabled. You need to read the review first to approve it. Select the review from the 
list and click on the edit button. The Reviews screen will show the product review. 
Here, you can edit the review and ranking, and change its status. To publish the 
review, select Approved in the Status drop-down list. 
Once the product review is approved, it will be displayed in the Reviews sidebox 
while the customer is in the Product Detail page of that product.
Once written and submitted by the customers, Product Reviews can be published 
instantly. To do this, you have to change the option in the Configuration | Product 
Info screen. Click on the Product Reviews Require Approval option, click the 
edit button and set its value to 0 =Off. If you want to approve the reviews before 
publishing, set its value to 1 =On.

Search Engine Optimization
People come to know about your online shop mostly through search engines. 
Therefore, it is imperative to have a good ranking in the search engines, or at least 
ensure that your site can be found through a search engine. Some techniques are 
used to optimize your site so that it gets listed in a search engine and appears first 
in the search results. Using meta-tags for products and categories is one way of 
optimization. Another way is to use search engine friendly URLs. We are going to 
learn about these in this section.
Using Meta-tags
The first step in search engine optimization is to use meta-tags properly. Zen Cart 
has a built-in feature for adding meta-tags for categories and products. You can  
add meta-tags to each product and category so that a search engine can index  
them appropriately.
Site-Wide meta-tags
You can define site-wide meta-tags such as charset, keywords and description from 
the includes/languages/english/meta_tags.php file. Edit the file for keywords, 
site title, site tagline and site description and save them to your override template 
directory, for example,  packt.
Some of the meta-tags you want to add may not be present in the above file. To 
adding your custom meta-tags, copy the includes/templates/template_default/
common/html_header.php file to your includes/templates/packt/common/ 
folder. Open it and add your own meta-tags to those already there by default.
Meta-tags for Categories
You can define meta-tags for each category from Catalog | Categories/Products. 
Here, you will find a list of all defined categories. Now, click on the meta tag icon, 
which is the last one to the right. A new screen will be displayed where you have to 
provide the following information:
Title: The title of the page will be defined in this field.
Keywords: Add the keywords that will be used for searching products in 
that category. These are the keywords that are going to be used during a 
search. Appropriate keywords result in better search results.
Description: Give a description of the category. Try to accommodate as many 
keywords as you can. The description should be brief, but comprehensive, so 
that customers know exactly what is in a category.
•
•
•
 

Chapter 6
[ 201 ]
A meta-tag must contain keywords and a description, or it will not be 
considered complete, and will eventually be ignored. Do some research 
about the keywords for each category beforehand. You may use some 
online tools for such keywords and get synonym keywords. One such tool 
can be found at: http://www.webmaster-toolkit.com/keyword-
research-tool.shtml.
Meta-tags for Products
You can also define meta-tags for each product. Go to Catalog | Categories/Products 
and browse to the individual product lists. Then, click on the meta-tag icon to 
define it. Here also, you have to define the title, keywords and description. Your 
descriptions need to be content-rich and keyword-rich. There are custom settings 
in Product Types that can include the Product Name, Title, Model, Price and Title 
tagline in the meta-tag title. You have to select Yes/No for these fields.
Generally, search engines will index all your pages in the shop. Therefore, 
build your pages with proper text to increase their content value for 
search engines. Although meta-tags are helpful, they are not the be all and 
end all. Content is more significant than meta-tags. The content should 
also be relevant to the meta-tags. If there is a difference between the 
keywords used in meta-tags and the actual content, a search engine may 
consider it keyword spamming. Remember that the lack of content is the 
major issue if your site is not getting good search engine rankings.
Using Search Engine Friendly URLs
If you are a long time user of the internet and have some interest in search engine 
optimization, you will find that one of the drawbacks of using shopping carts such 
as Zen Cart is its URLs. If you look into your browser's address bar, at the first sight, 
you may be perplexed. The URL reads something like: http://www.yourdomain.
com/ /index.php?main_page=product_info&products_id=12. In fact it is a link 
to a DVD titled Die Hard. As a human, you cannot remember the URL. On the other 
side, robots from Google and other search engines also dislike these types of URLs. 
URLs with ‘?' are usually not indexed by search engines. This means your shop may 
be out of the search engine, or in the worst case, Google may index only your store's 
homepage, and not all the products. This is awful!

[ 202 ]
Several attempts have been made to use Search Engine Friendly (SEF) URLs in such 
shopping carts. Although other CMSs like Joomla! have built-in SEF feature, Zen 
Cart is yet to develop such SEF URLs on its own. However, third-party contributions 
are available for implementing SEF URLs in a Zen Cart shop. We will know how to 
use the Ultimate SEO URLs module in Zen Cart.
The Ultimate SEO URLs module can be downloaded from Zen Cart's download 
section. It is located in the Other Modules category. Its installation is simple, and 
works perfectly in most of the cases. 
After downloading this from the web, extract it on to your computer. Then, upload 
the files from _zen_cart_folder to your Zen Cart installation directory. Now 
see the files in the v137-specific-files folder. Backup these files in your Zen 
Cart installation. Then, upload these files to your Zen Cart installation. A sample 
.htaccess file is included with the package. Rename it to .htaccess, and edit the 
word /shop to reflect your site's installation directory. Once done, you can configure 
this module from Configuration | SEO URLs.
 

Chapter 6
[ 203 ]
You have to configure the following options for Ultimate SEO URLs:
Enable SEO URLs?:  You can enable or disable search engine friendly URLs 
from this option. Select true to enable, and false to disable SEO URLs.
Add cPath to product URLs?:  Selecting true in this option will append 
the category path to the product URL. In such cases, the URL will look like 
http://yourdomain.com/matrox-g400-32mb-p-2.html?cPath=xxx. Keep 
this setting to false.
Add category parent to beginning of URLs?:  This setting will  
add the category parent name to the beginning of the category URLs  
(that is—parent-category-c-1.html).
Filter Short Words:  This setting will filter words less than or equal to 
the value from the URL. For example, you want to keep the filenames 20 
characters long. Then type a value of 20 in this field. Longer product names 
will be shortened to that having 20 characters.
Output W3C valid URLs (parameter string)?:  Enabling this setting will 
output W3C valid URLs.
Enable SEO cache to save queries?:  This is a global setting and will turn 
on/off caching completely.
Enable *** cache?: There are five options for enabling cache for. These 
settings will enable/disable cache for products, categories, manufacturers, 
articles and information pages. 
Enable automatic redirects?: Enabling this will activate the automatic 
redirect code and send 301 headers from old to new URLs.
Choose URL Rewrite Type: Choose which SEO URL format to use. At 
present you will get only one option, Rewrite. In future, there may be  
more options.
Enter special character conversions: This setting will convert special 
characters in URL into normal characters. The format must be mentioned in 
the form char=>conv,char2=>conv2, etc.
Remove all non-alphanumeric characters?: This will remove all non-letters 
and non-numbers from rewritten URLs. This should come in handy while 
removing all special characters with one setting.
Reset SEO URLs Cache: This will reset the cache data for SEO. From time to 
time, you may need to refresh the SEO URLs to get updated SEF URLs.
Enter pages to allow rewrite: This setting will allow the rewrite only in 
the specified pages. If it is empty, all the pages will be rewritten. The pages 
must be mentioned in the following for at: page1,page2,page3. The pages 
mentioned by default will be alright in most cases.

Once you have configured the SEF URLs, you can browse products in your store and 
see their rewritten URLs. These will look like:  yourdomain.com/matrox-g200-mms-
p-1.html, yourdomain.com/hewlett-packard-laserjet-1100xi-linked-p-
27.html, and so on.
There are some other modules for SEF URL in Zen Cart. For example, 
SEFU is one of the modules which modifies Zen Cart core files and 
database tables. While using any third-party module, always keep track of 
the files which are being modified. Module which do not modify any core 
files or database tables are safer to use. For Ultimate SEF URLs module,  
it only replaces three files for v.1.3.7: admin/categories.php,  
admin/product.php, and includes/functions/html_output.
php. Before uploading these files to the server, rename the original files 
with a suffix .SEO. When you want to remove SEF URLs, you can get 
back to the original files by changing their names to their original ones.
Summary
In this chapter, you have learned about several promotion and public relations 
tools available for a Zen Cart shop. Use of these tools effectively, and in a planned 
manner can enhance your sales dramatically. Amongst the tools, Featured Products, 
Special Products, SaleMaker, Cross-sell, Up-Sell, Gift Certificates, and Gift Vouchers 
can be used for the promotion of your products. On the other hand, tools such as 
Newsletters/Product Notifications manager can be used to communicate with 
your customers and inform them about new offers. The Review system can also 
contribute in promoting your products and acting as testimonials. Finally, you have 
learned how to get the attention of the search engines by using meta-tags for the site, 
category, products, and using search engine friendly URLs in your online shop.
After knowing all these attractive features of Zen Cart you may be tempted to move 
your existing shop to Zen Cart. In the next chapter, you are going to learn how to 
migrate from osCommerce to Zen Cart.
 

Migrating from osCommerce 
to Zen Cart
For several reasons, you may think of migrating from osCommerce to Zen Cart. In 
fact, people often install osCommerce when start their business. After some time, 
they discover Zen Cart and find that it has more features to offer than osCommerce. 
This chapter will show you how to migrate from osCommerce to Zen Cart.
On completion of this chapter, you will learn:
Why you need to migrate from osCommerce to Zen Cart.
What points you need to consider before migrating to Zen Cart.
How to migrate the database, the product catalogue, the product images, and 
other files in addition to the look and feel of the site.
How to minimize interruption to service during migration.
How to convert an osCommerce module to a Zen Cart module.
What the common problems during migration are, and how to overcome them.
This chapter will show you a step-by-step migration process from osCommerce to 
Zen Cart.
The Need for Migrating to Zen Cart 
Most of the time, the first-time online entrepreneur starts their shops using 
osCommerce. They choose it because osCommerce has been around for a long time, 
and is widely used. But after some time, administrators of osCommerce find that it is 
difficult to customize and lacks so many essential features. They often need to install 
contributed modules for osCommerce.

Migrating from osCommerce to Zen Cart
[ 206 ]
osCommerce administrators face the greatest difficulties in customizing its look and 
feel. As discussed in Chapter 1, osCommerce does not follow an easy to understand 
template system. Conversely, Zen Cart has improved on its templating system. In 
Zen Cart, you can apply a new template without modifying the original core files.
osCommerce templates also use extensive HTML which is difficult to edit. The tables 
are buried in PHP codes. The CSS also needs refining. Zen Cart's HTML is more  
up-to-date, and easier to edit. Considering this, many developers prefer Zen Cart  
to osCommerce.
One may migrate to Zen Cart after observing the differences between osCommerce 
and Zen Cart. The features of Zen Cart and osCommerce are discussed in Chapter 1, 
Introduction to Zen Cart. You may revisit those and find out why many online shop 
owners want to migrate to Zen Cart.
Migrating data from one database to another needs some experience 
in database systems. In the case of migrating osCommerce to Zen Cart, 
we assume that you are familiar with MySQL and phpMyAdmin. You 
know how to connect to a database, create/modify tables, and insert data 
into the tables. Knowledge of relational database management system 
concepts is a must before attempting the procedures explained in  
this chapter.
Points to Consider Before Migration
Every migration is complicated. Before migrating data to a new shopping cart, you 
have to consider the following points:
Ensure that your product data is migrated in its original form (as it was in 
the osCommerce shop).
Ensure that critical data, for example, customers, orders, products, product 
options, prices, and so on are retained as in the original.
Ensure that no data is lost during the migration.
Always backup your database before you attempt to modify any tables. 
As this exercise will deal with two of them, we recommend backing up 
both databases before proceeding to migration.

Chapter 7
[ 207 ]
Depending on the types of shops you are using, you may fall into one of the 
following cases:
1.	 Migrating from a live osCommerce shop to new Zen Cart shop: You have 
an osCommerce shop online. You have been using it for years or months, 
and now you want to migrate to Zen Cart (maybe after reading this book and 
knowing about Zen Cart's advantages). In this case, migration will be simple. 
Once you extract data from an osCommerce shop, you can insert it to a new 
Zen Cart shop database. There will be no issues of conflicting data for the 
two databases, as the Zen Cart database will have no existing data.
2.	 Migrating from a live osCommerce shop to a live Zen Cart shop: Suppose 
you have two shops running: one on osCommerce, and another on Zen Cart. 
Now you want to merge these two shops and want to continue with the 
Zen Cart shop only. In this case, you have to migrate osCommerce data to 
Zen Cart and at the same time ensure that the Zen Cart shop has minimum 
interruption. You also have to consider existing data items in Zen Cart. 
Conflicts may arise during exporting data from osCommerce to Zen Cart  
as there are some data items already. Problems of duplicate IDs are 
prominent in this case. You have to resolve these conflicts in order to  
migrate successfully.
You have to consider some other aspects of migration, depending on what you are 
migrating – only products and categories, or other data as well. The more data you 
are trying to migrate, the more complex the process will be.  The following sections 
discuss some other aspects which need to be considered before migration.
Product Catalogue
Zen Cart product catalogue includes product categories and product information 
including descriptions for the products. osCommerce also follow the same database 
structure, but product tables in osCommerce have fewer fields than in Zen Cart. 
This structural difference should be taken into consideration while migrating from 
osCommerce. 
While migrating the product catalogue from osCommerce to Zen Cart, you should 
also be aware that besides migrating the database we also need to migrate the 
product images to appropriate folders from osCommerce to Zen Cart.
osCommerce does not support product types. So the default value for the products 
type field will be used for products imported to Zen Cart. This means that all 
products will belong to the Product – General type.
 

Migrating from osCommerce to Zen Cart
[ 208 ]
If you are migrating other data, such as customers, orders, and so on, besides 
product catalogues, you have to consider interrelations among these tables. 
Remember that products are related to orders and orders are also related to 
customers. Thus, customers are related to some products. These interrelations must 
be understood beforehand and planned accordingly to decide which tables need to 
be migrated.
Database Structure
You have to remember that Zen Cart and osCommerce databases are not identical. 
Some of the tables in Zen Cart database have more fields. However, the fields 
available in osCommerce tables are mostly available in Zen Cart tables with similar 
names. For some fields, the data type or length is different. However, this will not 
create a problem while migrating data from osCommerce to Zen Cart, as new field 
types and their length in Zen Cart tables can accommodate the original data types 
and the length of the osCommerce table fields.
Considering the differences in both the databases, you have to understand that all 
fields in Zen Cart tables will not have values except the default values for those 
fields. For example, osCommerce categories have no descriptions, but Zen Cart 
categories have. While exporting osCommerce categories data to Zen Cart, the 
description field will remain blank. You have to add the descriptions to these  
fields manually.
Look and Feel
The general look and feel will not be exported to the Zen Cart shop. Usually, Zen 
Cart shops have their own look and feel, and you can adapt their look and feel to the 
old osCommerce shop by modifying the Zen Cart template. Customizing the Zen 
Cart template has been discussed in detail in Chapter 4 , Customizing Look and Feel.
Some other elements of look and feel are the display of product categories, display 
of product images, and so on. osCommerce cannot have images for categories. 
Therefore, in Zen Cart, you need to assign icons for categories manually after 
migration. You also need to transfer the product images to the images directory of 
Zen Cart installation.
Uninterrupted Service
While migrating your osCommerce products to Zen Cart, you have to ensure that 
service on both shops remains uninterrupted. If you are migrating from a live shop, 
ensure that the interruption to the shop is minimal. And also for migrating to a live 
shop, you have to pay special attention to ensure minimum interruption to services.
 

Chapter 7
[ 209 ]
It is best to do all preparatory work beforehand and then make the shop offline for 
some time to complete the migration. Before the actual migration, do some testing on 
your local server.
As taking the shop offline will not be possible all of the time, you can run the shop 
in its original location and make a copy in another folder. Then, try to migrate to 
the new instance of Zen Cart. This will allow you more time to migrate data from 
osCommerce. Once the instance works fine after migration, make this instance the 
main shop. 
osCommerce versus Zen Cart Database 
Structure
By now, you will have understood that migration from osCommerce to Zen Cart 
mainly involves migration of osCommerce categories and products data to the 
Zen Cart database. Generally, exporting osCommerce data and importing that to 
Zen Cart database will work if the structures of both the databases are similar, or 
compatible to each other. In this section, we are going to explore the similarities and 
differences of the data structure of Zen Cart and osCommerce tables for categories 
and products.
You can explore the database structure by exporting the structure of both the 
databases into a .sql file. For this, you can use phpMyAdmin. To export the Zen 
Cart data structure, login to cPanel (if applicable) and open phpMyAdmin. Then,  
select the Zen Cart database. Click on the Export tab. Now, select all the tables 
beginning with:
categories_*
products_*
In Zen Cart, you have to select the following tables:
categories
categories_description
products
products_attributes
products_attributes_download
products_description
products_discount_quantity
products_notifications
products_options

the other options. At the bottom of the page, check Save as File. Now, click on the 
Go button and save the file with a name such as zendb_structure.sql.
Exporting the osCommerce data structure is similar to exporting the osCommerce 
data structure. Similarly, you can do it from phpMyAdmin. Select the existing

name, say osc_structure.sql.
Now, open the files in a text editor and compare the tables. An analysis of the tables 
will show the differences as discussed in the following sections.
You can also use a file comparison utility such as WinMerge or Kompare. 
Another commercial file comparison tool is Beyond Compare. Use any of 
these tools, or just open it in text editor and compare manually.
I have used WinMerge to compare Zen Cart v.1.3.8 and the osCommerce 
MS2.2 database structures. The following sections are based on these 
findings. Please remember that you may get different results when 
comparing different versions (different from those I have used).
Tables for Categories
First, compare the categories tables for osCommerce and Zen Cart. The tables are 
almost similar, except for one field. Zen Cart's categories table has an extra field 
named categories_status. So, while migrating data from the osc_categories 
table, you will not get data for this categories_status field. However, this will not 
create a problem as it takes a default value of 1 (meaning active).

The categories_descriptions table contains descriptions of each category. Both 
zc_categories_descriptions and osc_categories_descriptions tables are 
identical. So, migrating data from osc_categories_descriptions table to  
zc_categories_descriptions will be straightforward.
Tables for Products and Attributes
There are many differences between the zc_products and the osc_products tables. 
There are at least 22 extra fields in the zc_products table. Fields available in the 
osc_products table are also available in the zc_products table, although, there 
are differences amongst common fields. For example, the products_model field in 
zc_products table is varchar(32) whereas same field in osc_products table is 
varchar(12). This means that exporting data from osc_products to zc_products 
is not a problem for this field, but exporting from zc_products to osc_products 
may create a problem as the zc_products.products_model field is larger than the 
osc_products.products_model field. On the otherhand, zc_products.product_
weight is of float type which is decimal in osc_products. As a float type can 
accommodate a decimal type, it will not be a problem. Analyzing the structure of 
both the tables, you can see that exporting data from osc_products to zc_products 
will be not a problem, but the reverse may be.
Similarly, zc_products_attributes table has 27 fields, whereas the 
osc_products_attributes table has only 6 fields. These 6 fields are also  
available in the zc_products_attributes table in an identical form. So, there  
will be no problem exporting data from osc_products_attributes to the  
zc_products_attributes table. 
Product options are stored in the product_options table. Zc_product_options 
table has 11 fields while the osc_product_options table has only 3 fields, which are 
identical to the 3 fields available in the zc_product_options table.
Regarding product options, Zen Cart has an extra table – products_options_types. 
This table contains three fields: products_options_values_id, language_id, and 
products_options_values_name. osCommerce has no such table and you will not get 
these fields. 
The Zc_products_options_values table has one extra field -  products_options_
values_sort_order. The other two fields are identical to osc_products_options_
values.
 

Migrating from osCommerce to Zen Cart
[ 212 ]
The following tables in both Zen Cart and osCommerce are identical: 
products_attributes_download 
products_description
products_notifications
products_options_values_to_products_options
products_to_categories tables are identical
Product types are not supported in osCommerce. So, you will not find the product_
music_extra, product_types, product_types_to_category, and product_type_
layout tables in osCommerce. 
Migrating Databases
First, you have to migrate categories and product data from osCommerce to Zen 
Cart. We assume that you have installed both osCommerce and Zen Cart, and 
both are in operation. Now, you want to migrate the product data to Zen Cart. The 
following is a step-by-step guide for migrating categories and product data from 
osCommerce to Zen Cart.
Step 1: Backup Existing Data
Back up both the osCommerce and Zen Cart databases. It is always recommended 
that whenever you make any change manually to the database, you back it up first. 
Once the data is lost you cannot get it back unless you have a recent backup. For both 
the databases, backup at least the categories and the products tables. You can do it 
easily from phpMyAdmin tool by exporting the whole database.
Step 2: Export osCommerce Data
Login to cPanel (if applicable), and open phpMyAdmin. Select the existing 
osCommerce database that you want to extract information from. Now, click on the 
Export tab.
Under the Export section, highlight all tables that start with categories_ and 
products_. You have to select at least the following tables:
categories
categories_description
products
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
 

Chapter 7
[ 213 ]
products_attributes
products_attributes_download
products_description
products_notifications
products_options
products_options_values
products_options_values_to_products_options
products_to_categories
Under the SQL options on the right hand side of the page, check Data and Complete 
Insert options.
Now, at the bottom of the page, check Save as File. Click on Go, save the file on your 
hard disk and name it something like osc_data.sql.
Step 3: Import osCommerce Data to Zen Cart
You have already extracted information from the osCommerce database, which 
needs to be imported to the Zen Cart database. Now, importing to Zen Cart can be 
simple or complex depending upon your situation:
1.	 You may want to migrate osCommerce product data to a new Zen Cart shop. 
In that case, the Zen Cart shop has no product data. This makes the import 
from osCommerce simple, as there will be no conflict between the existing 
and imported categories_id and products_id. 
2.	 You may want to migrate from an osCommerce store to another Zen 
Cart shop which already has some categories and products. In that case, 
importing osCommerce data adds some complexities as you have to 
consider unique id issues for categories_id and products_id. As there are 
categories and products already in the Zen Cart shop, some of the ids used 
by osCommerce categories and products may already be used by the Zen 
Cart categories and products. You have to ensure that all categories  
and products have unique ids and the ids are appropriately changed in  
all related tables.
We will discuss importing data for both cases, but start with the simple  
migration process.

Migrating from osCommerce to Zen Cart
[ 214 ]
Migrating to a Zen Cart Shop that does Not 
have Products
First, let us suppose that we are migrating our osCommerce categories and products 
to a new Zen Cart shop which has been installed and configured, but no categories or 
products have yet been added to it. In that case, the categories_* and products_* 
tables are empty. It may also happen that you have installed sample data, and these 
tables are populated with the data. In that case, just delete the records from these 
tables and make them empty.
Once you find the tables empty, you are ready to import the osCommerce data. 
Start phpMyAdmin, and go to the Import tab. In the File to Import section, click on 
the browse button and select the osc_data.sql file on your hard disk (which you 
have saved in Step 2). Then, click on the Go button. Your data will be imported if 
everything is alright. Otherwise, some error messages will be thrown up, and from 
those messages, you will get clues to look into the problems.
On the successful completion of the import of the osCommerce product data into 
the Zen Cart database, you need to import product images from osCommerce. 
Generally, product images in osCommerce are stored in the /images directory 
under osCommerce installation root. Copy the images and sub-directories (e.g. dvd, 
matrox, sierra, and so on) to the /images directory under the Zen Cart installation 
root. Both the images for categories and for products need to be imported.
You can download two contributions from the Zen Cart website. The first one is 
osCommerce Data importer contribution by Albert Savage, available for download 
from http://www.zen-cart.com/index.php?main_page=product_contrib_
info& cPath=40_41& products_id=918. This package includes three separate 
scripts which import customers, products, product description, categories, category 
descriptions, category structure, specials and reviews. You have to extract the zip file 
and upload these three scripts to the Zen Cart installation directory. For all the three 
scripts, you have to configure the following variables:
//Source Database with OSC records
$source_db_host = 'localhost';
$source_db = 'database';
$source_db_username = 'user';
$source_db_password = 'password';
$source_db_table_prefix = '';
 

Chapter 7
[ 215 ]
The above variables are for the source database, that is, the osCommerce database 
from which data will be imported. Then, you have to configure variables for the 
destination database, that is the Zen Cart database to which you want to import  
the data.
//Target Database with ZEN records
$target_db_host = 'localhost';
$target_db = 'database';
$target_db_username = 'user';
$target_db_password = 'password';
$target_db_table_prefix = '';
After changing the configurations and saving the file, point your browser to one of 
the above files, for example,  http://yourdomain.com/import_osc_customers.
php to run the script. 
The script will display the progress of exporting and importing data, and finally 
notify you of its success. You have to run the other two scripts: import_osc_
products.php, and import_osc_orders.php as well.
Warning
Remember that running these scripts will erase all product data in the 
target database. Therefore, use these scripts in a new store only when no 
product or category data is available.
The second contribution that can be used for importing data from osCommerce to 
Zen Cart is osCommerce to Zen  Cart Conversion Script by Michael Morris, available 
from http://www.zen-cart.com/index.php?main_page=product_contrib_
info& cPath=40_41&products_id=946. This package contains a single script 
named oscommerceimport.php. Once downloaded, extract the zip package and 
upload the oscommerceimport.php file in your admin directory. Now, point your 
browser to the file, that is, http://yourdomain.com/admin/oscommerceimport.
php. The page will ask you for the osCommerce database name and the table prefix. 
Enter this information and click on the Go button. The data from osCommerce will 
be imported to the Zen Cart database. Like the other script, it will destroy all the 
product, category, and order data in Zen Cart. As you need to use this script only 
once, delete the file once the data import is complete.
 

Migrating from osCommerce to Zen Cart
[ 216 ]
Migrating to a Zen Cart Shop that has 
Products
We have already mentioned that when your Zen Cart shop has existing categories 
and products, importing categories and products from osCommerce database 
becomes more complex. This is because the Zen Cart categories and products use 
the same category and product IDs, which results in conflicts of uniqueness of these 
primary keys. Before importing osCommerce data, we have to modify them in 
osCommerce to avoid conflict with the Zen Cart table IDs.
First, check the highest ID assigned to categories and products. For example,  
your existing Zen Cart shop has 66 categories, and the highest value of the 
categories_id field is 66. You can determine this by running the following query  
in the Zen Cart database:
SELECT MAX( categories_id )  
FROM categories;
This will return the highest value for the categories_id field. Similarly you can get 
highest value for products_id field:
SELECT MAX(products_id ) 
FROM products; 
It may return something like 181. Now, we have got the values which we cannot 
have in osCommerce data. In our osCommerce data file, we must not have any 
category whose categories_id is less than 67, and any product whose  
products_id is less than 182. 
Backup your osCommerce database tables before trying any of the 
following methods. As the following instructions are going to change 
the primary keys of some tables, it is crucial that you back up your entire 
database so that you can get the original data if something goes wrong.
Changing the values of the categories_id and products_id fields is tricky, as 
these are also used to link to the other tables. The following tables we have selected 
from the osCommerce database use the categories_id field (as the primary or  
foreign key):
categories (Primary key)
categories_description (foreign key)
products_to_categories (foreign key)
•
•
•
 

Chapter 7
[ 217 ]
So, if we change the value of the categories_id for one category, we have to change 
that value in all these three tables simultaneously. We can use the UPDATE statement 
for this. As a rule, we may increase the value of all category ids by 100. So we will 
add 100 to the value of the categories_id field. We can do this by running the 
following query in the osCommerce database:
UPDATE categories SET categories_id = categories_id + 100;
UPDATE categories_description SET categories_id = categories_id + 100;
UPDATE products_to_categories SET categories_id = categories_id + 100;
These three UPDATE statements will add 100 to the value of the categories_id field.
Warning
Run the above queries only once. Running any of the queries above more 
than once will give unexpected results, and the relationship between 
tables will be lost or misleading.
Now, we will update the values of the products_id field. The following tables use 
the products_id as the primary/foreign key:
orders_products (Foreign Key)
products (Primary Key)
products_attributes (Foreign Key)
products_description (Foreign Key)
products_notifications (Foreign Key)
Similar to the categories_id, we will change the products_id in these tables by 
executing the following queries:
UPDATE orders_products SET products_id = products_id + 200;
UPDATE products SET products_id = products_id + 200;
UPDATE products_attributes SET products_id = products_id + 200;
UPDATE products_description SET products_id = products_id + 200;
UPDATE products_notifications SET products_id = products_id + 200;
UPDATE products_to_categories SET products_id = products_id + 200;
These queries will update the products_id values in related tables. 
Warning
Run the above queries only once. Running any of the queries more than 
once will produce unexpected results, and the relationship between tables 
will be lost or misleading.

Migrating from osCommerce to Zen Cart
[ 218 ]
There is another thing that we have to update in the categories table. The parent_id 
field in the categories table indicates the parent category ids. If the value of  
parent_id is 0, it is the root category, and if it has a value, it is under some category. 
As we are changing the category's id, we must also change the value of the  
parent_id to reflect the exact category id. But for root categories, we will not  
change the parent_id. So, we have to run the following UPDATE statement:
UPDATE categories SET parent_id = parent_id + 100 WHERE parent_id > 0;
We also need to update the products_options_* tables. As the product_options_
id field may have duplicate values with Zen Cart the products_options_* tables, 
we need to increment the values in osCommerce first. Similar to categories and 
products, determine the highest value of products_options_id in Zen Cart, say 90. 
Then increment the value of products_options_id in osCommerce tables  
as follows:
UPDATE products_options SET products_options_id = products_options_id 
+ 100;
UPDATE products_options_values_to_products_options SET products_
options_id = products_options_id + 100;
And for updating products_options_values_id, run the following queries 
(assuming that existing highest value of this field is 95):
UPDATE products_options_values SET products_options_values_id = 
products_options_values_id + 100;
UPDATE products_options_values_to_products_options SET products_
options_values_id = products_options_values_id + 100;
After these updates, you are ready to export data from the osCommerce database. 
Follow the procedures described in Step 2 to export data from osCommerce. Save the 
exported data file as osc_data2.sql.
Now, it is time to import osc_data2.sql into the Zen Cart database. Start 
phpMyAdmin and go to the Import section. In the File to Import section, click on 
Browse and select the osc_data2.sql file. Then click on the Go button. All data will 
be imported to the Zen Cart database.

Adjusting the Look and Feel
During migration from osCommerce to Zen Cart, you are actually migrating 
the product, category, order and customer data only, not any .php files from 
osCommerce. The Zen Cart shop will use its own templates for look and feel. 
However, you may customize the Zen Cart template to have the same look and feel 
of the osCommerce store. Customizing of Zen Cart templates has been discussed  
in Chapter 4, Customizing Look and Feel.
Another thing about look and feel is that osCommerce categories do not use  
images, but in Zen Cart, you can use images for categories. Assign these icon  
images for categories. 
 

Migrating from osCommerce to Zen Cart
[ 220 ]
When you import categories from osCommerce, they do not have images assigned. 
For a consistent look with other Zen Cart categories, you need to add the category 
images manually. The following picture shows that only the Fisher Price category 
shows an image, which has been added manually. But other categories shown have 
no images, as they have not been imported from osCommerce.
Also, you have to move the product images to the appropriate directories. In Zen 
Cart, product images can be stored in separate sub-directories. But in osCommerce, 
no subdirectory can be used. You have to put all osCommerce product images into 
your Zen Cart product image folder's root that is, in the images directory. So, move 
the images from the osCommerce's images directory to Zen Cart's images directory. 
Then the products will display pictures as shown in the following screenshot:
 

Chapter 7
[ 221 ]
Converting osCommerce Modules
In Chapter 1, Introduction to Zen Cart, we discussed some programmatic 
differences between osCommerce and Zen Cart. These programmatic differences 
prevent osCommerce modules from working with Zen Cart. If you want to use a 
osCommerce module in Zen Cart, you need to modify that module first. There are 
a few general rules for converting osCommerce code to Zen Cart code. You must 
follow the rules of conversion.
Most of the essential modules are available on the Zen Cart website 
for your download. Before trying to convert any osCommerce module, 
first check the Zen Cart website and search for equivalent or alternative 
modules. Converting an osCommerce module may be your last resort. 
However, you are always encouraged to do so if you really want to learn 
how Zen Cart modules work, and if you have enough time to invest in it.
First, osCommerce uses the tep_db_query() and tep_db_fetch_array() functions 
to run queries on a database and assign the query results to some variable or array. 
You will find some codes like this:
$my_var_query = tep_db_query("query stuff"); 
$my_var = tep_db_fetch_array($my_var_query);
In the first line, the query result has been assigned to the $my_var_query variable. It 
seems that the query result will be a scalar variable. But for the second line, the result 
is expected to be an array and will be assigned to $my_var. For running queries in 
Zen Cart, the $db->Execute() function is used. So, whenever you see lines like the 
above code, replace them with something like the following:
$my_var = $db->Execute("query stuff");
Remember that in Zen Cart, one statement is enough for both scalar and array 
variables. You do not need to use different functions such as tep_db_fetch_array() 
just for the arrays.
In osCommerce, both the tep_db_query() and tep_db_fetch_array()functions 
are used with if and while statements to loop through the results. You will often 
find the following codes in osCommerce:
$my_var_query = tep_db_query("query stuff"); 
if ($my_var = tep_db_fetch_array($my_var_query))  {
   do_stuff;
}
 

Migrating from osCommerce to Zen Cart
[ 222 ]
and
$my_var_query = tep_db_query("query stuff"); 
while ($my_var = tep_db_fetch_array($my_var_query)) { 
    do_stuff; 
}
As Zen Cart does not use those functions, you have to rewrite the above codes  
as follows:
$my_var = $db->Execute("query stuff"); 
if (!$my_var->EOF)  {
 do_stuff;
}
and
$my_var = $db->Execute("query stuff"); 
while (!$my_var->EOF) { 
  do_stuff; 
  $my_var->MoveNext(); 
}
Note that, in both cases, you have used !$my_var->EOF, which means that until you 
reach the end of the variable, you have to execute the following instructions.
There is also a difference in referencing query fields. In osCommerce, query fields are 
referenced as follows:
$my_var_query = tep_db_query("query stuff");
$my_var = tep_db_fetch_array($my_var_query);
$i = $my_var['db_key'];
In Zen Cart, you have to reference the query field as follows:
$i = $my_var->fields['db_key'];
In osCommerce, the number of rows is returned by the tep_db_num_rows($my_var) 
function. In Zen Cart, you simply use $my_var->RecordCount(). For a new insert 
id, osCommerce uses the tep_db_insert_id() function, whereas Zen Cart uses a 
simple $db->Insert_ID() function. Another difference is in declaring $db. In Zen 
Cart, for every function you have to declare global $db, as all functions refer to $db.
In osCommerce, the session id is referenced by $osCid, which must be changed to 
$zen_session_id() in Zen Cart. Also, change all the tep_ prefixes in the remaining 
functions to the zen_ prefixes in Zen Cart.
 

Chapter 7
[ 223 ]
osCommerce uses registered globals which Zen Cart does not. Instead, Zen Cart  
uses $_SESSION superglobal. For every registered globals $var, replace it with  
$_SESSION['var']. Also replace all $HTTP_x_VARS with $_x in Zen Cart. For 
example, $HTTP_POST_VARS will be $_POST, and $HTTP_GET_VARS will be $_GET. You 
also need to remove any global $HTTP_x_VARS declaration inside the functions, 
because new superglobals do not need a global declaration.
These are the changes you need to make to an osCommerce module port into Zen 
Cart. However, simply importing products from osCommerce to Zen Cart will not 
need conversion of modules, as Zen Cart has most of the essential modules needed 
for the online store.
Common Problems during Migration
You may face some problems during migration, most of which are related to the 
export/import of data. These problems occur when there is a mismatch in your data 
fields, or there is some existing data with the same primary keys.
As we have discussed earlier, it is more difficult to import data from osCommerce 
to a Zen Cart shop when it has some categories and products. In this case, you have 
to ensure that the primary keys for the categories and products tables are unique. 
Otherwise, conflicts will arise during import. Possible ways to avoid these unique id 
conflicts are discussed earlier in this chapter.
There may be a problem in displaying products in the appropriate categories. 
Products in categories may be misplaced if products_id are not appropriately 
updated in the products_to_categories table. Entries in this table maintain 
relationships with the products and categories table. So be careful about maintaining 
these relationships while migrating from osCommerce to Zen Cart.
Summary
In this chapter, you have learned about migrating from osCommerce to Zen Cart. 
First, you learned about the various scenarios in which you may need to migrate, and 
points to be considered before migration. Then, you learned the differences between 
the osCommerce and Zen Cart database structures. Finally, we discussed the actual 
data migration from osCommerce to Zen Cart, converting osCommerce modules for 
Zen Cart, and common problems during migration. This chapter discussed only the 
migration of categories and products data, but other data on customers and orders 
can also be migrated similarly.
 

Integrating Zen Cart  
with Other CMS
There are various types of Content Management Systems (CMS) which are widely 
used for building and managing a website. Although Zen Cart is very good for 
running an online shop, it cannot be used for building a company website. Your 
organization may have a website running a CMS, and as you are going to open an 
online shop, you may need to integrate Zen Cart with that existing CMS.
In this chapter, you will learn:
In which cases you can integrate Zen Cart with a CMS
What you need to consider before integration
What the basic principles of integration are
How to integrate Zen Cart with popular CMSs
This chapter will give you the conceptual and practical know-how required to 
integrate Zen Cart with other CMS.
Why should you Integrate Zen Cart with 
CMS?
Every CMS has its own merits. If you consider the features of other CMSs, you will 
find a particular one that you like the most. After having tested so many CMSs you 
may be interested in getting all the best features of your favorite one. In spite of this, 
you may also need to add shop functionality to your existing website, or you may 
need more than a shop. You may be tempted to use the best CMS in order to have a 
better website and may want to start an online shop later. In these cases, you need to 
use both Zen Cart and a CMS.

Integrating Zen Cart with Other CMS
[ 226 ]
The general principles of integrating web-applications are as follows:
Seamless integration: The Integration of any two CMSs should be such 
that users see it as a single application. Both applications' look and feel and 
workings should be integrated to give this impression to the users.
Data integrity: Data of both applications should be synchronized instantly. 
For example, when a user registers at a Zen Cart shop, the same user should 
be created or replicated to the other CMS. Attempts to synchronize databases 
by running periodic updates such as cron or scheduler applications should 
be avoided.
Integration codes should be as simple as possible: For all integration 
attempts, code should be minimized. This will help maintain the code as well 
as develop the integration quickly.
No forking: All the applications should maintain their own code and should 
support their own upgrade path. The core files for the applications should 
not be modified. Instead, attempts should be made to develop some plug-ins 
for which code will be maintained separately.
The following sections illustrate some scenarios where you may need to integrate 
Zen Cart with a CMS.
A Well Established Site Starts a Shop
You may have been running a website for a long time and now you may want to 
sell products from this site. As you want to sell products directly from your site, you 
may think of adding Zen Cart.
In real life, it is most likely that your organization will establish a website first, to 
prove its online presence. When the website becomes popular and your organization 
observes the benefits of the website, it may be tempted to start an online shop. If the 
website has been established for a long time, it becomes branded for your company. 
Switching over from that site may become harder due to various other reasons. Now, 
you may want to start the online shop and integrate that shop with the existing site 
with a similar look and feel.
Increase the Scope of Your Shop
Zen Cart or osCommerce is well suited for running an online shop. But in some 
cases, you may want to establish a site which is more than a shop. Suppose that  
you are producing e-books and selling those in a Zen Cart shop. Now you think  
that adding a blog will be appropriate as authors will be able to write articles on  
their favorite topics, and these articles will add value to the e-books you publish.

Chapter 8
[ 227 ]
In that case, keeping the online shop intact, you have to establish a blog. From 
your experience, you know that WordPress is feature-rich and will meet your 
expectations. Now the challenge is to integrate Zen Cart with WordPress. You have 
to integrate these two so that customers think that the blog and the shop are the same 
site—it is crucial for your web branding.
Single Sign-in Benefits
One of the benefits of integrating one or more CMS or shopping carts is a single  
sign-in facility. A single sign-in provides users with the benefit of having logged into 
one CMS and use the other CMS without logging in again. If we integrate Zen Cart 
with some other CMS, it may happen that logging in into either Zen Cart or the CMS 
will allow you to use both Zen Cart and that CMS. You may want to integrate both 
Zen Cart and the existing CMS to give a single sign-in facility to your visitors.
How to Integrate with CMS?
While attempting integration of one CMS with another, some simple principles 
should be remembered. For all integration attempts, you have to consider the 
following aspects:
Master–slave relationship: While integrating one CMS with the other, one of 
the applications act as the master and the other as the slave. If you integrate 
application A to application B, then application B will be considered as 
master. Master applications maintain authentication and sessions for both 
applications. While integrating Zen Cart with some other CMS, first consider 
whether Zen Cart will be the master or the slave. If you are integrating Zen 
Cart with an existing website, Zen Cart is going to be the slave. On the other 
hand, when you are adding blogging functionality to the Zen Cart shop by 
integrating WordPress with Zen Cart, Zen Cart is going to be the master.
User and Group Management: One purpose of integrating two CMSs is to 
have a common user and group management system. Zen Cart integration 
may be tight, where both Zen Cart and an other CMS will use the same 
database for user and group management. On the other hand, loose 
integration will allow periodic or event-based synchronization of user or 
group databases. Tight integration becomes easier when both CMSs use the 
same type of user database. If the user databases are very different from each 
other, then tight integration may not be possible and some sort of fallback 
solution such as synchronizing the databases may be used.

Integrating Zen Cart with Other CMS
[ 228 ]
Visual integration: Users see the integration only through the visual 
integration. In fact, visual integration should be such that users will be 
unaware of integration attempt. While integrating the two CMSs, the visual 
template of the master should preferably be used for both CMSs. However, 
using a master's template system is difficult and a central template system 
should be developed which can be used for both applications.
Now, we will see how to integrate Zen Cart with other CMSs. You will notice that at 
least one of the above-mentioned aspects is present in such integrations.
Joomla!/Mambo
 If you are using Joomla!/Mambo and want e-commerce functionality, you have a 
number of choices. Among these, the best one is using the VirtueMart component. 
The VirtueMart component for Joomla!/Mambo is quite similar to Zen Cart or 
osCommerce. Only a few features of Zen Cart or osCommerce are missing in 
VirtueMart. However, if you still want to integrate Zen Cart into the existing 
Joomla!/Mambo website, you have two options—and neither is easier than the other: 
Use Zen Cart as a wrapper or, develop a component based on Zen Cart.
Using Zen Cart as a wrapper is in its true sense not an integration. It runs separately 
and Joomla! provides a menu link. Clicking on this link will show Zen Cart in a 
wrapper window. If you are experienced with Joomla! or Mambo, you can figure 
out how a menu item can be added to show the application in a wrapper. However, 
adding a wrapper may appear to be an integration if you modify the Zen Cart 
template accordingly. As the Zen Cart shop appears in the wrapper, it would be wise 
not to use headers and sidebars in the Zen Cart template. Links to the categories and 
other menus can be provided in the headers. A separate login mechanism should 
also be provided in the Zen Cart template.
Developing a bridge for Zen Cart and Joomla! is a hot topic in the Zen 
Cart forum. Users of both Joomla! and Zen Cart agree that integration 
or bridging of these two will be of great value. However, due to the 
framework of these two systems, developing such a bridge has some 
complexities and takes some time. Recently, a discussion on this topic has 
led to the development of such a bridge by the open-source enthusiasts. 
Please watch the following thread: http://tinyurl.com/65ypyu.
Another possibility is JFusion plug-in for Joomla! (available at  
www.jfusion.org) which is a framework for integrating several forums 
to Joomla!. The developer of JFusion has proposed developing such a  
plug-in for Zen Cart as well. It is hoped that JFusion will be able to 
integrate Zen Cart to Joomla! soon.

Drupal
Drupal is a powerful CMS and is widely used. There are a wide range of modules 
available for Drupal and it is used for different types of websites. There are a great 
number of Drupal users who want to integrate Drupal and Zen Cart—as both are 
considered useful in their category. Until recently, there was no easy way to integrate 
Drupal and Zen Cart. Very recently, Zen Cart Integration module has been released 
as a development version. For now, it works on Drupal 5.x and Zen Cart 1.3.7. 
Once this module is installed and configured, you can create Zen Cart categories 
and products from Drupal. As other nodes, these products and categories will be 
displayed as nodes in Drupal. When visitors click on these products they see product 
details as a Drupal node, but when the product is added to cart, it redirects to the 
Zen Cart shop. This module also provides a single sign-on facility.
For integrating Zen Cart into Drupal, download the module from http://drupal.
org/project/zencart. Before we proceed with the integration of Drupal and Zen 
Cart, assume that you have installed Drupal and Zen Cart on the same server. Let  
us suppose, Drupal is installed in e:\www\drupal57 directory and Zen Cart 1.3.7  
is in e:\www\zc directory, and these two uses separate database on the same  
MySQL server.
Follow these steps:
1.	 Download and unzip Zen Cart integration module: For integrating Zen Cart 
into Drupal, download the module from http://drupal.org/project/
zencart. On your computer, unzip the zencart-5.x-1.x-dev.tar.gz 
package. You will get a folder named zencart, under which there are some 
files and a subfolder named zencart.
2.	 Copy files for Zen Cart: Inside the zencart subfolder you will find the 
includes folder. Copy this subfolder, that is /zencart/includes, to your 
Zen Cart installation directory, that is e:\www\zc. This will overwrite the  
e:\www\zc\includes directory, but will not overwrite any files. Once you 
have copied all the files in this folder, you are finished with Zen Cart.
3.	 Install Zen Cart installation module in Drupal: Copy the zencart  
directory with all the files inside it, except the zencart subfolder, to Drupal's 
installation directory, that is e:\www\drupal57. As an administrator in Drupal, 
you can install this module from Drupal's Administer | Site Building | 
Modules section. In the module list you will see the Zen Cart Integration 
module group. You will find the following modules in this group:
Zencart—This is the main module for integrating Zen Cart shopping 
cart to Drupal. This is required by other modules in this group.
•
 

Integrating Zen Cart with Other CMS
[ 230 ]
Zencart Catalog—This module allows creation of Drupal nodes for Zen 
Cart products and categories.
Zencart Category Node Hierarchy—This module depends on the Node 
Hierarchy module and organizes Zen Cart products and categories. 
Download the Node Hirarchy module from http://drupal.org/
project/nodehierarchy and install it before enabling this module.
To enable these modules, select checkboxes in Enabled column and click 
Save configuration button at the bottom of the list.
4.	 Configure Zencart Integration module in Drupal: After enabling the 
modules, you can configure those from Administer | Site Configuration | 
Zencart Integration screen.
•
•
 

Chapter 8
[ 231 ]
The Zencart Integration screen has the following sections:
The Zen Cart Status section will provide you information about your 
Zen Cart installation. The module will search and find the Zen Cart 
installation and show its version, path to Drupal installation and  
other information.
The Zen Cart Settings section will give you the opportunity to mention 
the Zen Cart installation directory path. Type it into the Path to  
Zencart field.
The Zen Cart Page Redirects section allows you to configure page 
redirects from the Zen Cart page to Drupal node.
•
•
•
 

Integrating Zen Cart with Other CMS
[ 232 ]
Zen Cart Catalog section allows you to configure redirect from the Zen 
Cart catalog items to Drupal. While using this integration module, you 
create Zen Cart catalog and products from Drupal. If you want to create 
these categories and products from inside Zen Cart and synchronize 
those with Drupal, then check Update product info on cron. This will 
synchronize product information both on Drupal and Zen Cart by 
running cron command on linux/unix. Checking Redirect Product Info 
Pages will automatically redirect visitors from the Zen Cart product 
info pages to equivalent Drupal nodes. Similarly, checking Redirect 
Category Listing Pages will automatically redirect visitors from the Zen 
Cart category pages to equivalent Drupal nodes.
The Zen Cart Users section allows you to configure single sign-on 
options for Drupal and Zen Cart. If you want to allow Zen Cart existing 
customers to login to Drupal, then check the Allow Zen Cart Customers 
to login to Drupal checkbox. On the other hand, if you want to allow 
Drupal users to login to Zen Cart as customers, check Allow Drupal 
Users Customers to login to Zen Cart as Customers. Checking Allow 
Single Sign-On will allow users to login once and access both Drupal 
and Zen Cart.
Once you have configured these options, click the Save configuration button, 
or revert to defaults by clicking the Reset to defaults button.
5.	 Create Content Type in Drupal for Zen Cart categories and products: If you 
have ever used Drupal, you know how to create content types in Drupal. 
You can add new content type from Administer | Content Management 
| Content types | Add content type. Now you will get a Zen Cart Catalog 
group. From this section you can define whether this type will be used as 
a Zen Cart product or category. You can also configure node hierarchy—
ability to be parent or child (default is parent). In the Identification 
section, type a human readable name, for example Zen Cart Product, in 
the Name field. Then type a machine readable name of this content type, 
for example zc_product, in the Type field. Provide a description of this 
content type in the Description field.
In the Submission Form section, provide a label for the title and body 
field, minimum number of words, and explanation or submission  
guidelines. Configure default options in the Workflow section. Finally, 
click the Save content type button.
Create two content types—one for the Zen Cart category and another for the 
Zen Cart product.
•
•
 

Chapter 8
[ 233 ]
6.	 Add Category and Product in Drupal: You can create categories and 
products from Create Content section. In the list, click on Zen Cart Category. 
This will open Submit Zen Cart Category form. In this form, type the 
category name in Title field, type a description of this category in Body field. 
In the Node Hierarchy section, you can select a parent category.  Check 
Category is Active to make this category visible. Configure other options like 
Menu settings, URL path settings, Publishing options, and so on and click 
the Submit button to create the category.
Similarly, you can create Zen Cart products by clicking on the Zen Cart  
Product content type. This will display the Submit Zen Cart Product form.
 

Integrating Zen Cart with Other CMS
[ 234 ]
Fill in the Submit Zen Cart Product form with appropriate information, such 
as product name, model, quantity in stock, tax class, base price, and so on. 
You can select its parent category in the Node Hierarchy section. Check the 
Create Menu option to make a menu item for this product. Configure other 
options like Menu settings, URL path settings, Publishing options, and so 
on and click the Submit button to create the product.
7.	 Test Zen Cart Integration to and from Drupal: Now it is time to test whether 
the Drupal-Zen Cart integration is working or not. First, go to your Zen 
Cart shop, for example, http://localhost/zc. There you will find the 
categories and products you have added. Click on any of these, and you will 
be redirected to the respective Drupal node. Again, in the Drupal, click on 
a product link, type a quantity and click the Add to Cart button. That will 
redirect you to the Zen Cart shop's Your Shopping Cart Contents page.
Similarly you can test single sign-on features by signing in to either Drupal or Zen 
Cart and trying to purchase items from these two shops.

Gallery 2
Gallery2 is a web-based software product that lets you manage photos on your own 
website. It creates a catalog of photos which visitors can view as thumbnails as well 
as in its original size. It has an intuitive interface to create and maintain albums. It 
can create thumbnails automatically and can be used for image resizing, rotation, 
ordering, captioning, searching, and some other functions.
You can use Gallery2 to build a community site for sharing photos. You can create 
the community using Gallery2 and registered users can share their photographs by 
uploading their own photos.
You need to integrate Gallery2 with Zen Cart if you want to sell photos from 
your photo gallery. Gallery2 has a great mechanism to integrate with Zen Cart. 
The Gallery2/Zen Cart integration module is available at the Gallery2 download 
site http://dakanji.com/g2stuff/zcg2-3_2_1a-full.zip. Using it, users can 
organize their photos and other multimedia files into Gallery2, and offer them for 
sale through Zen Cart.
In integrating Gallery2 with Zen Cart, you have to configure Zen Cart first. Follow 
these steps for Zen Cart:
1.	 Download the Gallery2/Zen Cart Integration module and extract it.
2.	 Copy the zencart/includes folder into your Zen Cart installation directory. 
This directory contains some templates for Zen Cart. Copying these files will 
not overwrite any existing file.
3.	 Login to your Zen Cart administration panel and create a new product 
category, such as Photographs. Photo items from Gallery2 will go to  
this category.
4.	 Select Tools | Template Selection and choose one of the Gallery2  
Integration templates provided. You can take a copy of the template folder 
(../includes/templates/pgxxx) and modify stylesheet.css. You can 
modify these templates as described in Chapter 4, Customizing Look and Feel.
5.	 Edit ../includes/languages/pgxxx/english.php if you want to change 
language strings or date formats.
6.	 Replace ../includes/templates/pgxxx/images/logo.gif with your  
site's logo. 
Remember that for Gallery2/Zen Cart integration, both Zen Cart and Gallery2 data 
tables need to be in one database.
 

Integrating Zen Cart with Other CMS
[ 236 ]
In Gallery2, you need to make the following changes:
1.	 Upload the module files in the gallery2/ directory to your Gallery2 
installation's modules directory.
2.	 In Gallery2 Site Administration, click on Plugins and find Zen Cart under 
the Commerce heading. Then click Install.
3.	 After Installation, click Configure.
3.	 Enter the entire server path to your Zen Cart installation, for example,  
/home/your_name/public_html/zencart/.
 

Chapter 8
[ 237 ]
4.	 Select the category you created in Zen Cart earlier (for example Photographs) 
from the drop-down menu.
5.	 Click activate next to the Zen Cart listing on the module page. 
 

Integrating Zen Cart with Other CMS
[ 238 ]
6.	 Refresh the page and click on the Zen Cart link under Admin Options to edit 
product details.
6.	 Edit permissions for the individual items as you wish. The module will have 
assigned permissions to non-album items on activation.
If you do not want to sell an item, you will need to disable that item in Zen Cart as 
the module adds all data items in your gallery to Zen Cart. 
You can add photograph items from Gallery2. Adding any item to the Gallery2 
album will simply show that item in Zen Cart. You can add product options from 
Gallery2 by clicking on the Zen Cart link in your Gallery2 site administration menu.
When you have installed the Gallery2/Zen Cart bridge, you will find a product type 
in Zen cart named Product-Gallery. All the items from Gallery2 need to be of this 
type. If you edit any item from Zen Cart and change the product type of any Gallery2 
item, the link with the Gallery2 will be broken. Also, note that the Gallery2 bridge 
will co-exist with Zen Cart image handler and lightbox add-on for Zen Cart. These 
will handle product images for Zen Cart, whereas Gallery2 add-on only handles 
images added in Gallery2.
 

Chapter 8
[ 239 ]
You cannot assign the Main category in Zen Cart as the root product 
category for Gallery2. The category you are selecting in the Gallery2 
bridge configuration must be a sub-category product.
Once the configurations are done, you can see the photographs from Zen Cart. Visitors 
can also order photographs from Zen Cart. While you are in Gallery2, you can also 
place an order by clicking the add to cart link, which is redirected to Zen Cart.
WordPress
WordPress is an extremely powerful and widely used open-source blogging 
platform. It has a wide community of developers and users, and almost all kinds 
of plugins are available for it. Although there are some shopping cart plugins for 
WordPress, they are not full-blown shopping carts like Zen Cart or osCommerce.  
E-commerce plug-ins available for WordPress have limited features.
Those who are running blogs using WordPress may want to integrate it with  
Zen Cart to provide e-commerce functionality to their blogs. In fact, there is a  
Zen Cart module for integrating these two. You can download that module from 
www.zen-cart.com.
After downloading the plug-in WordPress on Zen Cart, you have to install it on 
the webserver. You can install the plug-in in two ways: first, in an environment 
where you have a working WordPress installation, and second, when you have not 
installed WordPress.
WordPress and Zen Cart Installed in Separate 
Directories
When you have an existing installation of WordPress, generally it will be in a 
separate directory from that of the Zen Cart installation. If your web document root 
directory is public_html, then the installation directories may be: /public_html/
blog and /public_html/shop. Follow these procedures to install WordPress on 
Zen Cart plug-in:
 

Integrating Zen Cart with Other CMS
[ 240 ]
Step1: Install WordPress
If you have not installed WordPress yet, then download the WordPress files from 
www.wordpress.org and unzip the files. Then, upload the files to your webserver's 
/public_html/blog directory. Now, change the permission of this directory to  
777 and point your browser to http://yourdomain.com/blog/wp-admin/ 
setup-config.php. The installation wizard for WordPress will be displayed. Follow 
the instructions on the wizard and give the necessary information. Once all of the 
information is given, WordPress will be installed.
Step 2: Configure WordPress
During installation, an administrative account will be created. Note the username 
and password for this account. Then, point your browser to http://yourdomain.
com/blog/wp-admin/. The login page will be displayed. Type the username and 
password for the administrative account and click on the Login button.
You will see the dashboard for administering WordPress. Go to Options | General. 
Now, change the Blog Address (URL) to Zen Cart's URL http://yourdomain.com/
shop/. From the administration dashboard, go to Presentation | Themes and select 
WordPress Default 1.6.
Step 3: Upload WordPress on Zen Cart
When you unzip the WordPress on Zen Cart plug-in zip file, you will find that there 
is a directory called ZC_ROOT and WP_ROOT. Now, upload the contents of ZC_ROOT 
directory to Zen Cart's installation path on the server, that is, /public_html/shop/. 
Similarly, upload the contents of the WP_ROOT directory to WordPress' installation 
path, that is, /public_html/blog. Before uploading the contents of the ZC_ROOT 
directory, please change the name of the /ZC_ROOT/includes/templates/MY_TEMP/ 
directory to that of the template directory you are using for your Zen Cart shop.
Step 4: Edit WordPress File
For older versions of WordPress, you may need to edit the /wp-include/template-
loader.php file. Open the file in a text editor and replace all exit; with return;. 
However, you may not need this for the newer versions of WordPress. WordPress 
2.3.1 can work without this modification. First, try without this modification. 
Step 5: Edit Zen Cart File
You also need to edit another file in the Zen Cart installation. Open the /includes/
extra_configures/wordpress-config.php file under the Zen Cart installation 
folder and find the following line:
define ('ABSPATH','/var/www/vhost/example.com/public_html/blog/');
 

Chapter 8
[ 241 ]
Type the appropriate WordPress path, that is, /home/username/public_html/
blog/. The above line will look like this:
define ('ABSPATH','/home/suhreed/public_html/blog/');
If you are trying it on Windows, you may need to put the absolute path, as in,  
e:/www/blog.
Step 6: Configure Sideboxes from Layout Boxes Controller
Once the file modifications have been done, login to the Zen Cart administration 
panel. Go to Tools | Layout Boxes Controller. The screen will notify you that some 
new sideboxes—wp_cats.php, wp_archives.php, wp_pages.php, wp_links.php, 
and wp_sidebar.php—have been found. To use these sidebars, click on the reset 
button at the bottom. To show these sideboxes on your Zen Cart shop, click on the 
sidebar and change its left/right column status.
Step 7: Test your Integration
Now, it's your time to see how the Zen Cart and WordPress integration works. Point 
your browser to your Zen Cart shop, that is, http://yourdomain.com/shop/. If 
everything is ok, you will find the screen as shown in the following screenshot:
If the ABSPATH value in wordpress-config.php file is not entered appropriately, 
you will get a message saying that wp-config.php file in a particular path is not 
found. In that case, edit the wordpress-config.php file and enter the correct path to 
the WordPress installation.
 

Integrating Zen Cart with Other CMS
[ 242 ]
Note that a left sidebox named Blog Sidebar is shown in your Zen Cart shop. You 
will find links to pages in the blog, links to archives, and links to categories. Click on 
a link and that category, archive or page will be displayed.
You may be disappointed when you look at the result because the whole WordPress 
page with headers, footers, and sidebars is displayed. If you have some knowledge 
of customizing WordPress themes, you can work out a nice solution by removing the 
header, the footer, and the sidebar from the theme layout.
For learning WordPress theming, check the excellent tutorials at  
www.wordpress.org. You can also read WordPress Themes,  
published by Packt.
 

Chapter 8
[ 243 ]
WordPress and Zen Cart Installed in the Same 
Directory
You can also install WordPress and Zen Cart in the same directory. In such a  
case, install  Zen Cart first. Configure it for normal use, and then proceed with  
the installation of WordPress. For example, if your Zen Cart installation is in  
/public_html/shop/, then WordPress will also be installed at /public_html/
shop/. First, download the WordPress installation package, unzip it, and upload all 
files, except index.php.
After uploading the files to the Zen Cart directory, i.e. /public_html/blog/,  
change the access permission of these to 777. Now, point your browser to  
http://yourdomain.com/shop/wp-admin/setup-config.php. The installation 
wizard for WordPress will be displayed. Follow the instructions of the wizard 
and provide the necessary information. Once all information is made available, 
WordPress will be installed.
Now, follow Steps 2 to 7 as described in the previous section. In this case, the paths 
to Zen Cart and WordPress will be same.
When you use other themes, it is necessary to revise the header of the 
WordPress theme, a footer, a sidebar, and a style sheet.
XOOPS
XOOPS is a CMS written in PHP. It uses a modular architecture allowing users to 
customize, update, and theme their websites. XOOPS is an acronym of eXtensible 
Object Oriented Portal System. It aims to serve as a web framework for use by 
small, medium, and large sites through the installation of modules. For example, a 
small XOOPS installation can be used as a personal weblog or journal, but this can 
be expanded upon and customized. For example, users might add the appropriate 
modules (freeware and commercial) to store content in news, forums, downloads, 
and more.
If you have a XOOPS-based website and want to add e-commerce functionality 
to that website, you can use Zen Cart with XOOPS. There is a Zen Cart XOOPS 
Integration module which can be used to integrate Zen Cart with XOOPS.
After downloading the module, upload the files to your XOOPS installation 
directory. Then, install it as a normal module for XOOPS. Ensure that the Use 
custom session value in Preferences | System | General Settings is on.
 

Integrating Zen Cart with Other CMS
[ 244 ]
You need to change the permissions of some files and folders. CHMOD the following 
folders to 777:
shop/images
shop/images/banners
shop/images/categories/
shop/images/uploads
shop/blocks/cache/english
shop/blocks/cache/additional_language
The default admin URL for the Zen Cart shop will be shop/admin with username 
and password admin.
XOOPS Zen Cart has a built-in Zen Cart installation. Zen Cart files are included  
with this module and are installed as a module of XOOPS. This module has the 
following features:
It integrates the languages of both XOOPS and Zen Cart. When selecting a 
language at the XOOPS site, Zen Cart's language is also changed. However, 
the same language needs to be installed in both XOOPS and  
Zen Cart. Extra language packs for Zen Cart can be downloaded from  
www.zen-cart.com.
It also integrates the XOOPS theme with Zen Cart. The template applied 
to XOOPS site also applies to the Zen Cart shop. You can use the template 
variable $isshop to determine if the module is currently open through  
your theme.
It also integrates blocks. You can select all the static sideboxes of Zen Cart 
which can be seen through the Zen Cart blocks. Once the blocks are assigned 
to show in Zen Cart blocks, these must be rebuilt in the Zen Cart XOOPS 
administration panel through Tools | Layout Boxes Controller.
This module is based on Zen Cart v.1.2.7d and supports the feature of Zen 
Cart v.1.2.7d.
e107
e017 is a comparatively new CMS with lots of features, and ease of use. It has 
hundreds of plug-ins through which you can extend its capability. You will find a 
plug-in to bridge with Zen Cart too. Bridging through this plug-in is easier for  
the layperson.

folder in your e107 installations e107_plugins folder. Then, install the plug-in 
from the administration panel's Plugins | Plugin Manager. You will see the list 
of installed and available plug-ins. Click on the Install button beside the ZenCart 
Bridge plug-in. It will be installed without any prompt.
Once the Zen Cart bridge is installed, you will see the list of installed plug-ins in the 
main administration panel. You can also access configuration options by selecting 
Plugins | ZenCart Bridge. You have to configure the following options:
Try to create ZenCart user account on e107 signup event: Selecting Yes will 
create a Zen Cart user account when a user registers on e107 CMS.
•
 

Integrating Zen Cart with Other CMS
[ 246 ]
Try to update existent ZenCart user account when found on e107 signup 
event: Select Yes if you want to update the existing user account in Zen Cart 
when a user registers with the same name in e107. For example, suppose that 
a user registers with the name 'borhan' in e107, and Zen Cart has an account 
named 'borhan'. Zen Cart bridge will update user 'borhan' in Zen Cart. If 
the password chosen for e107 user is different from that of the Zen Cart user 
password, the password in Zen Cart will be changed for that user.
Try to update existing ZenCart user account on e107 profile update event 
(Zen Cart password will be synchronized only if the user changes his or her 
e107 password): Select Yes if you want to update the Zen Cart user profile 
from e107. Whenever a user in e107 changes profile information, including 
password, the user profile at Zen Cart will also be changed.
Go online—Try to synchronize e107 and ZenCart user sessions on e107 
login/logout events: Select Yes if you want to keep e107 and Zen Cart user 
databases synchronized always. Selecting Yes in this field will automatically 
synchronize user accounts when the user logs in or logs out from e107.
Synchronize e107 site admins as well: Selecting Yes for this option will also 
synchronize administrative accounts in e107 with Zen Cart. If you want the 
administrators to be the same for both e107 and Zen Cart, select Yes in this 
field.
Gender: This field indicates what will be the default value for the Salutation 
field in Zen Cart while synchronizing the accounts between e107 and Zen 
Cart. If the account in e107 does not have a gender indication, this default 
value will be used.
Disable ZenCart Newsletter (no matter the user's choice): Both e107 and 
Zen Cart have newsletters. While registering, you may decide to use only 
e107 newsletters. Selecting Yes in this field will disable Zen Cart newsletters 
for the user accounts. Select Yes only when you use e107 newsletter for 
advertising your products.
Default value for missing Extended User fields: If your e107 users have 
extended fields, specify the defaults for those.
The main configuration for bridging e107 and Zen Cart is configuring the database 
options. However, it is also automated, and can be used easily. You can configure 
the Zen Cart database connection from Plugins | ZenCart Bridge | ZenCart 
Connection.

The following are the options for the database configuration:
ZenCart server root path for auto-detection: You can use auto detection 
for Zen Cart database connection settings by mentioning the Zen Cart 
installation path. For example, if your Zen Cart installation is in the  
/shop directory of your webserver root, then you have to type  
http://yourserver.com/shop/ in this field. Then, click the autodetect 
button.  It will locate the configuration.php file and read the database 
connection information from this file. Once it is detected, you are done.
Host: If auto-detection does not work, type the database host name, for 
example, localhost, in this field.
User: Type the database username in this field. This username will be used to 
connect to the database. So, make sure that this user has permission to do so.
Password: Type the password used for the above user account.

Database: Type the name of the database. If you are using cPanel and a 
shared Linux server, remember that the database names are prefixed with 
usernames. For example, if you have an account named bob, the database 
will be named bob_zencart.
ZenCart Table Prefix: Your Zen Cart tables may use a prefix. If so, type the 
prefix in this field. Generally, for separate databases, table prefixes are not 
used. But when you are using the same database for separate CMSs, table 
prefixes, such as zen_ are used.
The Zen Cart Bridge works well with e107. However, it acts only as bridge. Using 
e107, users can also login and purchase products from the Zen Cart shop. This kind 
of bridge is good when you have kept the shop as a linked site with the e107 site. 
For better performance, it is suggested that you use the same database 
both for Zen Cart and e107. But, don't forget to use the zen_ prefix for the 
Zen Cart tables.
phpBB
phpBB is a bulletin board service for creating communities of common interest. This 
is widely used on the Internet, and I hope you have seen one or two by this time. You 
can integrate a phpBB bulletin board service with a Zen Cart shop. This can be done 
while you are installing Zen Cart.
If you want the forum or bulletin board service, download and install phpBB. You 
can download phpBB2 or phpBB3 from www.phpbb.com/downloads/. Install phpBB 
on the same server. Then, start installing Zen Cart. There will be a step asking you 
whether you want to integrate phpBB or not. Choose Yes in this screen, and then 
specify the phpBB directory path. This way, phpBB will be integrated to Zen Cart 
during installation.
If you do not integrate phpBB during the Zen Cart installation, you can do it at a 
later stage. Whenever you think that you need to add a forum to your shop, just 
install the phpBB forum and follow these instructions to integrate it with the Zen 
Cart shop.
1.	 Install phpBB and test whether it works properly. For ease of configuration, 
it is recommended that you install phpBB to the root of your server, perhaps 
like this: 
http://mysite.com/forums or http://mysite.com/phpbb.

2.	 Edit the /includes/configure.php file for Zen Cart and enter the path to 
your phpBB folder on this line:
	
define('DIR_WS_PHPBB', '/phpBB2/');
It needs to be the full exact path to your forum folder, including the  
/var/www/client/public_html/ (or whatever it is on your server). Look at 
your DIR_FS_CATALOG for a hint, and then adjust by adding your phpBB 
or forum to that. Or it may be in a different folder. If it is in different folder, 
you can just mention ../phpBB2/, or something similar. Remember to  
include the '/' at the end.
3.	 In Zen Cart's Admin area, go to Configuration | My Store, and set Enable 
phpBB Linkage? to True. Now, any new user created will be asked to select 
a forum username during signup.
Integration with phpBB means, when a user registers with Zen Cart, the same 
account is created on the phpBB. While creating an account on Zen Cart, the user is 
prompted to choose a nickname for the phpBB forum. Users can also see a link to the 
phpBB in the Information sidebox. Clicking on this link will take you to the phpBB 
forum where a user can login using his or her nickname and password.
Summary
In this chapter, we have learned about the integration of Zen Cart with other 
CMSs. We have discussed the necessity of integration, characteristics of successful 
integration, and ways to integrate CMS. Then, we have seen ways to integrate Zen 
Cart with other CMSs such as Drupal, WordPress, Gallery2, e107, and phpBB. Bridge 
or connectors are used for such integration. The development of such bridges or 
connectors for other CMSs such as Joomla! are under consideration. Keep an eye on 
those community forums for solutions.
In the next chapter, we are going to discuss maintenance and troubleshooting tasks 
in Zen Cart. 
 

Maintenance and 
Troubleshooting
Maintenance and troubleshooting are important aspects for any web application. 
You need to perform some regular maintenance activities to keep your Zen Cart 
shop active, and trouble free. Sometimes, you also may face problems operating the 
shop. This chapter discusses maintenance and troubleshooting issues in Zen Cart. In 
this chapter, you will learn:
How to backup and restore files and databases for Zen Cart
How to harden security for Zen Cart
How to solve common problems
Only common problems and troubleshooting techniques are discussed in this 
chapter. As a user of Zen Cart you may face different types of problems. For more 
information and solutions of such problems, the best place to raise the issues is Zen 
Cart Forum (http://www.zen-cart.com/forum). You may also consult the sites 
listed in the Appendix.
Website Maintenance Settings
Some maintenance activities to your Zen Cart online shop may interrupt its service. 
For example, when you are backing up or restoring databases and files, and 
installing and configuring some third-party contributions , the site may become 
unavailable to the customers, or it may be malfunctioning. Plan the maintenance 
activity in advance and schedule the activity for the time when the website traffic is 
expected to be minimal and the least number of customers will be affected.

Maintenance and Troubleshooting
[ 252 ]
Zen Cart has a built-in mechanism to notify visitors about scheduled maintenance. 
You can configure these settings in the administration panel from Configuration | 
Website Maintenance.
Taking the Shop Down for Maintenance
Whenever you want to do some maintenance, first take the shop offline. Click on 
Down for Maintenance: ON/OFF and set its value to true. Visitors to your site will 
then see a message on the front page about the maintenance.
 

Chapter 9
[ 253 ]
Customizing for Maintenance Messages
By default, the name of the file displayed during maintenance is down_for_
maintenance. You can change the messages shown in this page by editing its 
language file, /includes/languages/english/down_for_maintenance.php. Its 
display can be customized by editing a corresponding template file /includes/
templates/template_default/templates/tpl_down_for_maintenance.php. 
You can also decide whether the header, footer, left column, right column, and 
the product price will be displayed or not by configuring these options from the 
Configuration | Website Maintenance page.
Excluding the Admin from being Blocked
Bringing the shop down for maintenance means you want to do some activities and 
also experiment with the shop. Therefore, it is necessary that at least you access the 
shop while it is blocked for the others. You can exclude yourself (admin) from being 
blocked during this down period by entering your IP address into the Down For 
Maintenance (exclude this IP-Address) field. You can type multiple IP addresses 
separated by a comma (,).
 

Maintenance and Troubleshooting
[ 254 ]
Notice for Maintenance
It is good to inform the visitors about your scheduled maintenance in advance. Set 
the NOTICE PUBLIC Before going Down for Maintenance: ON/OFF field to true. 
By default, it is false, and whenever you set the Down for Maintenance: ON/OFF 
field to true, the value of this field becomes false automatically. Setting this value 
to true will display a notice for scheduled maintenance. Now is the time to set the 
schedule. Click on the Date and hours for notice before maintenance field, and set 
the date and time of maintenance. Then, a notice will be displayed in the header of 
your online shop before taking it down for maintenance.
Showing Downtime
You can show visitors when the shop was taken down for maintenance and what the 
estimated downtime is. Informing your visitors about this will encourage them to 
come back. Set the fields, Display when webmaster has enabled maintenance and 
Display website maintenance period, to true. You can also set the duration of the 
maintenance period in the Website maintenance period field.

Backing Up Files and Databases
Backing up files and databases is the first step in maintenance activities. While 
setting up the Zen Cart shop and customizing it, you will change a lot of files 
which will not be the same as the original ones that came along with the Zen Cart 
installation package. By this time, you also know that all information you enter into 
your Zen Cart shop are stored in the database. Therefore, to be on the safe side, it is 
better to back up the files and databases regularly.
Why do you Need a Backup?
Backup has no value in normal time, but it seems invaluable when you have a 
problem. When your store is not working due to some recent changes in the files or 
databases, and you want to revert to the previous version of files and/or database 
(which was working fine), backup seems to be worth a million dollars.
For the following reasons you need to back up your files and databases regularly:
Your web server may be compromised, or it may be out of order any time. In 
that case, you can start your online shop on another web server if you want 
to have a back up of all the files (modified .php files, product images, and so 
on) and databases.
Sometimes, you may have a problem after modifying files. For example, you 
are customizing the look and feel of your Zen Cart shop, and suddenly you 
find that after editing some files and uploading them to the web server, your 
Zen Cart shop is not displaying the front page but is throwing errors. The 
backup of the files will help you revert to the previous version of files, and 
resolve the problem.
Problems may also occur after installing third-party contributions. Some 
third-party contributions may overwrite some core files of Zen Cart. In which 
case, the backed up files will help you revert to the working version.
Backing Up Database
There is no built-in mechanism in Zen Cart to backup its database. You have to use 
phpMyAdmin, other MySQL tool, or third-party contributions to back up whole 
databases for Zen Cart. If you have access to phpMyAdmin, please follow these steps 
to backup your Zen Cart database:
1.	 Login to phpMyAdmin.
2.	 From the list of databases, select the Zen Cart database. Usually, it is zencart.
3.	 Click on the Export tab.

[ 256 ]
4.	 In the Export section, click on Select All, or select your desired tables by 
clicking on the table names. For selecting multiple tables, press Ctrl and click 
on the table names in the list.
5.	 Uncheck the Structure checkbox for not including table structures. If you 
want to include a table structure, select Add IF NOT EXISTS in the Structure 
section. This will add a statement which will ensure that a table is created 
only when it does not exist. Selecting this option is especially advantageous 
for backups.
6.	 In the Data section, keep the default settings, that is, Complete Inserts, 
Extended Inserts, Use Hexadecimal for Blobs checked.
 

Chapter 9
[ 257 ]
7.	 Click on Save as File, as you are going to save the export on your computer. 
You can also use a template for the filename. The default is __DB__, which 
names the file after the database. You can save the file as zipped or gzipped 
by selecting these options in the Compression field.
8.	 Click on the Go button. If you have selected Save as File, a Save To dialog 
box will be displayed. Browse a location on your computer to save the file.
There is a third-party contribution for Zen Cart to facilitate backing up of the Zen 
Cart database from within Zen Cart. Download Backup Admin MySQL Plugin v.1.3 
from Zen Cart website's download section. Installation is as simple as extracting and 
copying the admin folder to the Zen Cart root folder.
Backup Admin MySQL Plugin v.1.3 uses two MySQL programs: mysql and 
mysqldump. These two programs usually reside in the /usr/bin directory. This path 
is indicated in the /admin/includes/languages/english/backup_mysql.php 
file. If you are using a windows server, you may need to edit this. If MySQL backup 
Admin Tool is not working, open the /admin/includes/languages/english/
backup_mysql.php file and change the following lines:
define('LOCAL_EXE_MYSQL',     '/usr/bin/mysql');
define('LOCAL_EXE_MYSQLDUMP', '/usr/bin/mysqldump');
Usually, on a Windows server, these paths will look like c:/mysql/bin/mysql.exe 
and c:/mysql/bin/mysqldump.exe. Be sure about the actual path on your Windows 
server and replace the previous lines accordingly.
For creating backups, the admin/backups directory should have read/
write permission. If you are using a Linux server, apply CHMOD 777 on 
the admin/backups directory.
You can run this backup tool from the administration area. Select Tools | Database 
Backup – MySQL. The Database Backup Manager – MySQL screen will  
be displayed.
 

Maintenance and Troubleshooting
[ 258 ]
If you are not using SSL, a warning message will be displayed saying that any 
downloads from this page will be unencrypted. Click on the backup button to 
create a new backup of the Zen Cart database. The New Backup dialog box will be 
displayed. If you want to skip the locking of the database during a backup, check 
the Skip Lock option radio button. Generally, the backup generated is stored in the 
admin/backups folder, and you can download that by clicking the down arrow icon 
before the name of the backup. If you want to download the backup file directly 
to your computer without storing it on the web server, check Download without 
storing on server.
Backing up Files
Backing up files is as simple as backing up any web application. You may need to 
keep a backup of the initial snapshot, then do some backup for only the changed 
files. Once you have set up a Zen Cart shop, take the base snapshot. Then after 
customizing the shop, that is customizing the look and feel and installing third-party 
modules, you need to take backups.
Zen Cart themes are using overrides, and this override system does not modify or 
replace original files. Therefore, while adding a new template, you can just care 
about those new files in the template. Similarly, after adding Zen Cart third-party 
contributions, you can take a backup of the new files.
Although, in principle, no third-party contribution is supposed to touch 
the files in the original installation, some contributions still do some 
modifications to the original files. Be sure about such overwrites or 
modifications before installing the contributions. Also, keep a backup of 
the original files before installing such contributions.

[ 259 ]
Product data are very much important for any online shop. You must ensure that 
product data are always backed up and readily available for restoration whenever 
necessary. While product information such as description, price, and so on are stored 
in the database, product images are not stored in the database. Generally, product 
images are stored in the images directory under the Zen Cart installation directory 
of your web server. Therefore, you also need to backup this folder whenever you see 
that a large number of products have been added to the catalogue.
If you are using Linux hosting and cPanel, you can back up files (and also Zen Cart 
database) easily from cPanel. Follow these steps to backup files and database  
from cPanel:
1.	 Login to cPanel.
 

Maintenance and Troubleshooting
[ 260 ]
2.	 Click on the Backups icon in cPanel's main page. The Backups page will be 
displayed. You can download the directory and database backups from  
this page.
3.	 In the Home Directory section, click on the Download a home directory 
Backup link. This will start download of the backup. Save the file on  
your computer.
4.	 To back up the database, click on the Zen Cart database name under the 
Download a MySQL Database Backup section. This will save the SQL dump 
of the database in a compressed format. Save the file on your computer.
Restoring Database and Files
If you have backed up the database using phpMyadmin or Database Backup Tool 
Plugin, you can restore those backups from phpMyAdmin, or the Database Backup 
Tool Plugin.
 

Chapter 9
[ 261 ]
Restoring database from phpMyAdmin is actually executing a query or importing 
the dump. Follow these steps to restore from a backup:
1.	 Login to phpMyAdmin.
2.	 Select the zencart database.
3.	 Click on the Import tab.
4.	 In the File to Import section, click on the Browse button and select the 
backup file which you want to restore.
5.	 Click on the Go button.
The database will be restored. If there is any record existing in the database, an error 
message will indicate the problem with that record. Remember that importing a 
large database may take some time. 
 

Maintenance and Troubleshooting
[ 262 ]
Restoring database backups made by Database Backup Tool Plugin is much easier. 
Once the backup is generated, that will be listed on the Database Backup Manager 
– MySQL screen.
For restoring a database backup follow these steps:
1.	 Click on the database backup which you want to restore. On the right side, 
two options will be shown: restore and delete. 
2.	 Click on the delete button to delete the database backup. You may delete it if 
you are sure that you will never need the backup in future. 
3.	 Click on the restore button to restore that database backup. Details of 
information about that backup set will be shown. 
4.	 Again, click on the restore button on this dialog box to restore the backup.
Finally, the database will be restored. It may take some time depending on the size of 
the database you are restoring.
 

Chapter 9
[ 263 ]
Note that, you have to click on the restore button shown to the right side box. If  
you click on the restore button shown in the following screenshot, the list of  
backups will show you options to restore from a file on your computer. Click on the 
Browse... button, select the .sql file from where you want to restore, and click on the 
restore button.
Restoring file backups is as simple as uploading the files from the backup set to Zen 
Cart's directory on the web server. You can do this using web-based uploading tools 
or FTP programs. 
As you have seen you can use cPanel for database and files backup and restoration. 
We have discussed how to backup home directory and Zen Cart database from 
cPanel. Follow the steps below to restore those backups:
1.	 Login to cPanel.
2.	 Click on the Backups icons in the cPanel main page. The Backups page will 
be displayed.
 

Maintenance and Troubleshooting
[ 264 ]
3.	 To restore files, click on the browse button in the Restore a Home Directory 
Backup section, select the backup file saved on your computer, and then click 
the Upload button. The file will be uploaded, extracted and restored as per 
the directory structure. 
4.	 To restore a database, click on the browse button in the Restore a MySQL 
Database section, select the database backup file saved on your computer, 
and then click the Upload button. The database will be restored to  
its original. 
From cPanel backup, you cannot backup or restore selectively. As an 
alternative to this, you can use the FTP programs to download the 
backups and upload to the web server for restoring old files.
Auditing and Hardening Security
Auditing is the process of examining logs to ensure that there is no security breach 
or attempts to compromise security. While using Zen Cart for online stores you must 
ensure that it is secure and safe for both the customers and the owner. The following 
sections discuss ways to ensure security of your Zen Cart shop.
Common Security Settings
After installation and configuration of Zen Cart, you need to take appropriate 
security measures to protect your online shop. The following sections highlights 
some common steps for securing your online shop.
Use SSL whenever Possible
Secure Socket Layer (SSL) enables your site to communicate securely over 
the internet. Plain HTTP is not secure as it sends information over the internet 
unencrypted. Anybody on the internet can capture the data stream and know what 
you are sending or receiving. This is especially insecure for changing the passwords 
for the Zen Cart admin account. As you know, the Zen Cart admin account password 
is the key to controlling your online shop. If anybody can capture this password, he 
or she gets the controls of your shop.
For safeguarding communication over your online shop, use SSL. SSL sends and 
receives data, which you exchange with your online shop. It ensures that the 
configuration options you are using and the changes you are making to your site 
remain confidential by encrypting all transmissions from and to your computer.
 

Chapter 9
[ 265 ]
For using SSL on your Zen Cart shop, you need a SSL certificate. Some hosting 
providers give you the shared SSL certificate at economy rate. But using such 
certificates is not secure, as compared to using a dedicated SSL certificate. Although 
there are some added expenses, it is recommended that you use a dedicated SSL 
certificate for your online shop. While you are searching for hosting for Zen Cart 
shop, also check whether that host supports SSL, and can install the SSL certificate. 
Whenever possible, also try to have a Secure FTP service such as FTP over SSL/TLS 
(FTPS) instead of the non-secure FTP.
Delete/Rename Sensitive Folders
Some folders in Zen Cart are more sensitive than the others. The first folder you 
should take care of is zc_install. The installation scripts remain in this folder, and 
anybody can start the installation of Zen Cart by pointing the browser to this folder. 
This folder should be removed from your web server on finishing the Zen Cart 
installation. Delete this folder completely instead of renaming it.
The second folder that you should take care of is the admin folder. This is the 
administration area for your Zen Cart shop. As hackers know that Zen Cart uses 
this folder as an administration area, they may attempt to access this often. You can 
make their attempts unsuccessful by renaming this folder. Give a name that is hard 
to guess; do not rename it as myadmin, or newadmin. Instead, use some randomly 
generated names, say ctkobn. You also need to reflect the name in the /admin/
includes/configure.php file. Open this file in text editor, and find all instances of 
admin and replace them with the new name, that is, ctkobn. You need to change the 
following sections:
define('DIR_WS_ADMIN', '/admin/');
define('DIR_WS_CATALOG', '/');
define('DIR_WS_HTTPS_ADMIN', '/admin/');
define('DIR_WS_HTTPS_CATALOG', '/');
define('DIR_FS_ADMIN', '/home/suhreed/public_html/admin/');
define('DIR_FS_CATALOG','/home/suhreed/public_html/');
After the admin folder is renamed, the previous lines will look as follows:
define('DIR_WS_ADMIN', '/ctkobn/');
define('DIR_WS_CATALOG', '/');
define('DIR_WS_HTTPS_ADMIN', '/ctkobn/');
define('DIR_WS_HTTPS_CATALOG', '/');
define('DIR_FS_ADMIN', '/home/suhreed/public_html/ctkobn/');
define('DIR_FS_CATALOG', '/home/suhreed/public_html/');
 

Maintenance and Troubleshooting
[ 266 ]
Always remember to keep the ending '/' intact while you are typing  
the new folder in the above lines. Deleting the ending '/' will  
create problems.
You have to use new URLs to access the administration area after renaming 
the admin folder. Point your browser to the new URL such as, http://www.
yourdomain.com/ctkobn and check whether you can access the administration area.
Set Appropriate Permissions to Files and 
Directories
Permissions set to sensitive folders are files that can enhance security of your 
online shop. Some files needs to be read-only while some folders may have write 
permission. The first file you should secure is configure.php. If you are using 
Linux hosting, then apply CHMOD 644 on both /admin/includes/configure.php 
and /includes/configure.php. If you need to change these file in future, first 
change these permissions, and then edit and save. Once the changes are made, apply 
CHMOD 644 on them again. On the Windows server, set permissions to these files 
as read-only. Also ensure that the IUSR_machine_name account has limited access 
permissions to these files.
For all other directories and files, set them as read-only, except for the /images and 
/cache directories. The /images directories and sub-directories under it should be 
writable by the server process as product images are uploaded to these directories. If 
you make these directories read-only, you will not be able to upload product images 
while adding a new product from the administration area. The /cache directory is 
used to cache queries; therefore, it needs to be writable by the server process.
From the Tools | Define Pages Editor in the administration area, you can edit 
pages for Zen Cart. Once you have finished editing define pages, you should make 
the /includes/languages/english/html_includes/ directory read-only. When 
you make them read-only, others cannot change them. However, if you want to 
modify some files from Tools | Define Pages Editor again, you have to make those 
directories and files writable first.
Another way to protect your folders from being browsed directly is by using the 
.htaccess file. In several directories, you will find that there is a .htaccess file and 
a blank index.html file. These are there to ensure security for those folders. The 
.htaccess file in a particular folder generally prevents direct access to that folder 
or some .php files. The blank index.html file is there for added security. In case 
.htaccess is not uploaded to that directory, index.html protects the directory 
from being browsed directly.
 

Chapter 9
[ 267 ]
Always Use Secure Passwords
As mentioned earlier, security of your whole online shop depends entirely upon the 
strength and privacy of your admin password. If the password is well publicized 
and/or can be guessed easily, then the security of your entire online shop is 
thwarted. For strengthening the security of your shop, follow these guidelines  
for passwords:
1.	 Always use a complex password—a complex password should contain 
alphanumeric characters and some special characters.
2.	 Never use your name, or the names of your spouse, son, or daughter as the 
password. Do not use a birth date, telephone number, social security number, 
and so on for the password. These are known to others and can be guessed 
easily.
3.	 Do not write down your password in front of your computer, or in public 
places. Always keep the password memorized. If you really need to keep it in 
writing, keep it under lock and key.
4.	 Do not share your password with others. If necessary, create separate admin 
account for others and ensure that they are also aware of the security and 
importance of their password.
5.	 Generate random passwords. There are lots of free password generators that 
can be used for this purpose. You may also use some tools to test the strength 
of your password.
6.	 Change your password time to time. Changing it frequently lowers the risk 
of being discovered by others.
7.	 Do not send your password to someone by email, or over the telephone.
Remember that your online shop is secure as long as you protect your administration 
area by maintaining a strong and secret password for your admin account.
Securing Access to the Administration Panel
Unlike osCommerce, the administration area of Zen Cart is well protected by default. 
Whenever anyone wants to access the administration area, he or she needs to 
provide the username and password for an administrative account. Normal users or 
shoppers cannot login to this area. You do not need to edit .htaccess or any other 
file for securing this area.
The main administrative account is created during installation. The master 
administrator has full access to all areas of the administration area. Using this 
account name and password, you can login to the administration area.
 

Maintenance and Troubleshooting
[ 268 ]
It is not wise to use the same username and passwords for all people administering 
the online shop. Instead, create a separate administrative account. Once you are 
logged in to the administrative username and password, you can create other 
administrative accounts. Follow these steps for creating administrative accounts:
1.	 Login to the administrative area.
2.	 Select Tools | Admin Settings.
3.	 Click on the insert button.
4.	 In the New box, type the name of the account, the email address, the 
password, and confirm the password. The email address used for this 
account is very important for the retrieval of the forgotten password.
5.	 Finally click on the save button when done.
You can also reset the password for administrative accounts. For resetting the 
password for any administrative account, select that account and click on the 
reset pwd button. Then, the Reset Password box will be displayed. Type the new 
password and confirm that by retyping it. Then, click the save button.
 

Chapter 9
[ 269 ]
Do not use the same admin account for multiple people sharing the 
password. Instead, create separate admin accounts for each user and 
ask that person to keep his or her password a secret. Make each person 
responsible for maintaining their login secret.
User Authentication and Security
Zen Cart has built-in user authentication and security mechanisms for controlling 
access to catalogues. You can configure your store to allow product browsing by 
all—both registered and unregistered users. At the same time, you can configure 
your store to require registration for placing orders. Unregistered users can browse 
the products, and even add products to their carts, but they must register and log in 
to Zen Cart to check out. This is a standard setting for online shops.
Register Globals Setting
Unlike osCommerce, Zen Cart runs with Register Globals on or off. It is not required 
to be on, as it is in osCommerce. Although, Zen Cart can run with register globals 
on, for better security, it is recommended that you keep it off. However, you may 
find some hosts which enable this setting to support other applications.
During Zen Cart installation, you will be notified whether Register Globals is on or 
not. If it is on, you may make it off through editing .htaccess. In the .htaccess file 
in the webroot, you have to add the following lines:
 # to turn off register_globals
 php_value register_globals 0
 

Maintenance and Troubleshooting
[ 270 ]
Session Handling
Session handling is an important aspect for any web application such as a shopping 
cart. Zen Cart has its built-in mechanism to handle session. In fact, Zen Cart uses 
session handling infrastructure of PHP. It handles login security and keeps the 
information on each visitor to the Zen Cart shopping cart separately.
Session Save Path
Zen Cart stores session information in a directory. This directory needs to be writable 
by the web server process. The session save path is configured during installation. 
If you forget the path and want to know the session save path, open phpMyAdmin, 
click on SQL tab and run the following query:
SELECT configuration_value FROM configuration WHERE configuration_key  
                                         = 'SESSION_WRITE_DIRECTORY';
As a result of this query, a directory path will be displayed. This is the session save 
path. If you see that the directory does not exist, or you want to change the path, just 
replace /path/to/session/save in the following query and run it:
UPDATE configuration SET configuration_value =  
                   '/path/to/session/save' WHERE configuration_key =  
                                           'SESSION_WRITE_DIRECTORY';
When you have the correct session save path set, you need to make sure that you 
have the correct permissions set for it. Set permissions to 777 for this directory. 
Remember that if you are using a prefix for your database tables, you will need to 
apply that to the above queries.
Session Referer Setting
Make sure that session.referer_check is disabled. You can check this with 
phpinfo(), or from Tools | Server Info. If it is enabled, turn it off. You can disable 
session.referer_check by any of the following methods:
php.ini file: Edit your php.ini file and set session.referer_check = off.
.htaccess file: In your .htaccess file, add php_value session.referer_
check none.
ini_set() command: You can also use the ini_set() command to disable 
it. Open the includes/application_top.php and admin/includes/
application_top.php files, and add ini_set('session.referer_check', 
''); after the license information in these files.

By default, Zen Cart will be able to handle the session correctly unless the session.
use_trans_sid setting is enabled on your server. If this setting is enabled, Zen Cart 
will not be able to hook into it properly to access its services in a way that lets it 
identify data related to Zen Cart.
As it is absolutely required for proper session handling of Zen Cart, you must keep 
this turned off on your server. Sometimes, your webhost provider may permit  
you to configure it through .htaccess. In that case, you may resolve this issue  
as follows:
1.	 In the webroot, that is the directory where index.php and install.txt 
are located, create a new file named .htaccess. If you have an existing file 
named .htaccess, then you just need to modify it as stated in the next step.
2.	 In the .htaccess file, add the following lines:
	
# to turn off session-trans-sid
	
php_value session.use_trans_sid 0
Adding the above lines and saving it will allow your server to allow Zen Cart to use 
PHP session handling mechanism.
Common Problems and Troubleshooting
While running your Zen Cart shop, you may face some common problems which 
can be broadly categorized as PHP and configuration related problems and Zen Cart 
related problems. The following sections highlight such problems.
PHP Related Problems
If there is any problem in configuring your Zen Cart shop, you may encounter 
various error and warning messages. Some of the common warning messages, their 
causes and remedies are discussed below.
Warning:
Cannot modify header information—headers already sent by (output 
started at <path/to/output_file>:<line number>) in <path/to/
current_file> on line <number>.
 

Maintenance and Troubleshooting
[ 272 ]
You may encounter this message after modifying some .php files. This warning 
shows up if you leave a space or extra line at the beginning, or the end of a .php file. 
The file causing a problem is indicated by its name and line number. Look at after 
output started at and within brackets in the error message above. Fixing this error is 
as easy as removing that extra space or extra line. Open that file and go to the line 
number as reported in the error message. Then ensure that no space or extra line is 
present before <?php or after the ?> tag.
Usually this kind of error happens when you are working with some custom editors 
such as Dreamweaver. For example, you have edited files using Dreamweaver and 
uploaded the files via Dreamweaver without using check-in features. You can avoid 
this error by using  check-in features in Dreamweaver.
Sometimes 'header already sent' error appears after other error messages. In that 
case, always resolve other errors first, as the other error messages may cause the 
'header already sent' error.
Warning:
Variable passed to each() is not an array or object in .../includes/
classes/db/mysql/query_factory.php on line 100
This error may be displayed if magic_quotes_runtime is enabled. To be sure, check 
your phpinfo and see if magic_quotes_runtime is enabled. If it is enabled, you 
need to turn it off. You can do this by editing the following files:
includes/application_top.php 
admin/includes/application_top.php
Open the files in the editor, and just after the licensing terms, add the following lines:
if (get_magic_quotes_runtime()) { 
        set_magic_quotes_runtime(0); 
   }
Warning:
main(<...>): failed to open stream: No such file or directory in <...>
This error occurs when some files included in the.php files are not found in the set 
path. For correcting this, first ensure that you have uploaded all files and set correct 
permissions, especially for the file in question. If that does not fix the problem, check 
your PHP include_path. You can see these paths along with the error messages you 
have received. You can also check this setting with phpinfo().
 

Chapter 9
[ 273 ]
On a Windows server, the include_path needs to start with .; and on a Unix/
Linux server, it must start with .:. If the include_path does not contain this, you 
must configure it in php.ini, or in a .htaccess file.
In the php.ini file, add the following lines:
include_path = ".;Drive:\path\to\php\includes" //for windows server 
include_path = ".:/path/to/php/includes" //for linux/unix server
Similarly, you configure it by editing the .htaccess file.
For Windows host, add the following line in the .htaccess file:
php_value include_path ".; Drive:\path\to\php\includes"
For Unix/Linux host, add the following line in the .htaccess file:
php_value include_path ".:/path/to/php/includes"
Warning:
<restricted function>: open_basedir restriction in effect. File 
(<path to file>) is not within the allowed path(s): (<allowed 
paths>) in <file producing the error> on line <line>
This error occurs when you try to access a directory on which you do not have access 
permission. To get rid of this error message, ensure that the directories listed in the 
error messages are configured to be accessible by Zen Cart. On a Windows server, 
the directories are shown separated by a semi-colon (;) and on Unix/Linux servers, 
these are separated by a colon (:).
You entered the wrong username or password. 
This may happen when you are typing a wrong username or password. Remember 
that passwords are case-sensitive. So, ensure that the Caps Lock is not ON while you 
are typing your passwords. If you have really forgotten your password there is still 
hope to recover it, even if it is your admin account password.
The first attempt to recover a forgotten password will be to click on the Resend 
Password button and enter the admin email address. You will find this button on 
the admin login screen. Usually, you will get the password in your email box. If, for 
some reason, you do not receive the password, you can create a temporary password 
to login only if you have access to a Zen Cart database. 
 

Maintenance and Troubleshooting
[ 274 ]
Login to your webhosting control panel, open phpMyAdmin, select the Zen Cart 
database and click on the SQL tab. In the query box, type the following query and 
click on run:
DELETE FROM zc_admin WHERE admin_name = 'Admin'; 
INSERT INTO zc_admin (admin_name, admin_email, admin_pass,  
                     admin_level) VALUES ('Admin', 'admin@localhost',  
                    '351683ea4e19efe34874b501fdbf9792:9b', 1);
Here zc_ is the prefix for the Zen Cart tables. Your database may use different 
prefixes or none. In that case, replace zc_ with the prefix you are using. Running 
this query will create a temporary admin account with a username admin and 
a password admin. You can now login to the administration area using these 
usernames and passwords.
It is important that, after you log in, delete this temporary admin account and create 
a new one from Tools | Admin Settings. Click on the insert button to create a new 
admin account. You have to provide the username, email address, and password for 
creating a  a new admin account.
Warning:
session.auto_start is enabled—please disable this PHP feature in 
php.ini and restart the web server.
Enabling the session.auto_start setting starts a session automatically which 
creates a problem with proper session management. If you receive this warning,  
you have to disable this setting. You can do this by editing php.ini or the 
.htaccess file.
If you have access to the php.ini file, set the directive session.auto_start to 0,  
as follows:
session.auto_start = 0
In most of the cases you can edit the .htaccess file. If you do not see the .htaccess 
file in your Zen Cart directory, create one. Then add the following line to that 
.htaccess file and save it:
php_value session.auto_start 0
Your last resort will be to contact your host provider and ask them to disable this 
setting on the server.

Parse Error:
syntax error, unexpected T_CONSTANT_ENCAPSED_STRING in /
home/Suhreed/public_html/zencart/includes/languages/
english/packt/product_info.php on line 17
This error occurs when you forget to put a backslash (\) before a single quote (') in 
one of your define() statements in the language file. For example, the following line 
will result in similar error:
define('TEXT_SOMETHING','This is something simple that's used as an  
        example');
Here a ' is not escaped, so this will fire an error message. To correct this error, escape 
the character as follows:
define('TEXT_SOMETHING','This is something simple that\'s used as an  
        example');
This page contains both secure and non-secure items. Do you want to 
display the non-secure items?
Sometimes, you may have a symptom whereby clicking on a login link will result in 
a message saying that the page contains both secure and non-secure items. Usually 
this happens on all secure pages, especially in My Account and Checkout areas.
This problem occurs when:
You have hard-coded actual URL links such as http://xxxxxx in your 
templates, instead of using relative paths to objects.
You have added banners with the http:// links and not marked them to 
skip display on the SSL pages
You have added click-tracking tools to your site via JavaScript, which link to 
http:// pages somewhere.
To solve the problem on your browser, view the source of the pages creating 
the problem and search for src=http://. When you find the links, edit the 
corresponding template files, and remove the hard-coded links. If they are caused by 
click-tracking scripts somewhere, try converting them to https:// links, or contact 
the vendor for assistance with alternate scripts.
•
•
•
 

Maintenance and Troubleshooting
[ 276 ]
To be on the safe side, never hard-code a http:// URL into any page  
on your site, always use the relative URL in such links. You can  
hard-code such URLs only when you are sure that doing so will not 
produce this sort of error, or when you are using only a non-secure mode, 
that is, without SSL. Be especially careful about the  <img src=...> and 
<script src=...> tags.
Login Related Problems
You may face problems during login as a customer, or in the administration area. 
These problems are mainly due to some settings which control session handling and 
the authentication of users. The following sections highlight some common problems 
related to login.
Session Handling in Admin Area
It has been said earlier that Zen Cart's sessions are managed using the PHP session 
handling features. In general, it works as follows:
1.	 A session is generated upon login of a user. For customers, the session's 
name is zenid, and for admin users, it is zenAdminId. 
2.	 On starting the session, PHP attempts to set a cookie in your browser. The 
cookie stores that session ID so that it does not need to be shown in the 
browser URL all the time. If the session ID is not in the cookie, it is shown 
as part of the URL; something like &zenAdminID=243524524524525 is 
appended to the URL. If a cookie is set, the session ID is in the cookie, and 
the session name and number don't need to be appended to the URLs. Zen 
Cart needs this session ID to keep you logged in.
3.	 When you log out, or the session ID is lost, the session data is reset and your 
authentication data is removed. As the session ID is lost, you need to login 
again. This generates a new session ID.
Starting from Zen Cart v 1.3.8, a security token is generated, and 
embedded in the login form to identify that same person while  
logging again.
 

Chapter 9
[ 277 ]
Understanding this session management helps you identify the cause. As discussed 
earlier, you may identify a problem while generating session ID, storing it in cookies, 
retrieving it from a cookie, or while re-using it. Session management problems may 
occur when Zen Cart cannot recognize the user's session ID:
When cookies are blocked by a firewall, or a browser configuration. If you 
are using a firewall, first check whether it blocks cookies. If not, suspect 
the browser. By default, browsers receive cookies. However, in case of a 
problem, you should check the browser's configuration options. 
When PHP is configured wrongly, or has certain session settings set to 
methods incompatible with Zen Cart, such as session-auto-start and 
transitive-sid. You will get warning messages during installation if 
these PHP settings are found at that time. However, these may change after 
installation, and create problems to your Zen Cart's session management.
When you have configured your site to store session data in files but your 
file system does not have permissions to write on the files. Appropriate 
permissions to the session file may be the problem.
When you have configured your site to store session data in the database but 
the database table (that is zc_sessions) is corrupt, or the database storage is 
full and new records cannot be added.
Sometimes this may occur that you cannot remain logged in to the admin area. This 
shows the problems of handling PHP sessions in Zen Cart's administration area. 
First, try closing the browser windows, clearing the browser cache, cookies, and 
restart your computer. In most of the cases, this will solve your problem if that is 
due to caching of cookies in the browser. If the problem is not related to caching, it 
may also be due to incorrect SSL configuration. To solve such problems, edit your 
/admin/includes/configure.php file and change ENABLE_SSL_ADMIN to false. 
Then, clear browser cache, cookies, and try again.
Security Error during Login as Customer
If you have upgraded to Zen Cart v 1.3.8, you may receive an error message while 
trying to login, "There was a security error when trying to login".
This happens due to the fact that Zen Cart v1.3.8 has an added security feature to 
prevent spoofed external logins. All login forms have been designed to include a 
security token field. When a user tries to login, the security token is also submitted 
with the username and password. This security token needs to be current in order 
to login successfully. If the security token field is not the current one, or is outdated, 
then an error will be thrown.
•
•
•
•
 

Maintenance and Troubleshooting
[ 278 ]
If you have a customized template's login files, there is a possibility that the old files 
don't have that security token field with the login form. You need to merge new 
security features into the login file template.
In general, the following files are affected by this new security feature:
/includes/templates/CUSTOM_TEMPLATE/templates/tpl_login_
default.php
/includes/templates/CUSTOM_TEMPLATE/templates/tpl_timeout_
default.php
And for admin area the file will be: /admin/login.php.
In tpl_login_default.php, you find the following code block:
<label class="inputLabel" for="login-password"> 
  <?php echo ENTRY_PASSWORD; ?></label>
<?php echo zen_draw_password_field('password', '',  
  zen_set_field_length(TABLE_CUSTOMERS, 'customers_password') . '  
                       id="login-password"'); ?>
<br class="clearBoth" />
</fieldset>
You have to insert the following line of code before the code block shown above:
<?php echo zen_draw_hidden_field('securityToken',  
                                 $_SESSION['securityToken']); ?>
Similarly, you have to add the above line in the tpl_timeout_default.php file.
Additionally, if you have customized your /includes/functions/sessions.
php file for some reason, you'll also need to merge the new changes for this core 
file into your customized version. In your old customized /includes/functions/
sessions.php file, you will find the following code block:
function zen_session_start() {
    @ini_set('session.gc_probability', 1);
    @ini_set('session.gc_divisor', 2);
    if (defined('DIR_WS_ADMIN')) {
      @ini_set('session.gc_maxlifetime', (SESSION_TIMEOUT_ADMIN < 900  
           ? (SESSION_TIMEOUT_ADMIN + 900) : SESSION_TIMEOUT_ADMIN));
    }
    return session_start();
  }
•
•
 

Chapter 9
[ 279 ]
For Zen Cart v 1.3.8, you need to change the line return session_start();. Now 
the code looks like this:
function zen_session_start() {
    @ini_set('session.gc_probability', 1);
    @ini_set('session.gc_divisor', 2);
    if (defined('DIR_WS_ADMIN')) {
      @ini_set('session.gc_maxlifetime', (SESSION_TIMEOUT_ADMIN < 900  
           ? (SESSION_TIMEOUT_ADMIN + 900) : SESSION_TIMEOUT_ADMIN));
    }
    $temp = session_start();
    if (!isset($_SESSION['securityToken'])) {
      $_SESSION['securityToken'] = md5(uniqid(rand(), true));
    }
  	 if (ereg_replace('[a-zA-Z0-9]', '', session_id()) != '') session_
regenerate_id();
    return $temp;
  }
The best way to reflect these changes in your custom template file is by 
using a file comparison, or a merging tool such as WinMerge. You can see 
the differences and merge them using this tool.
Forgotten Admin Password
The password for the administrator account is assigned during the installation 
of Zen Cart. Once the installation of Zen Cart is finished, you can log in to the 
administration area by using the admin account and its password. If you forget the 
password for the admin account, there is an easy way to get a new password. In 
the admin login page, click on Resend Password, and then type the administrator's 
email address and click on the resend button. A new password will be sent to that 
email address. You then can log in using that password.
 

Maintenance and Troubleshooting
[ 280 ]
If for some reasons you cannot retrieve the admin password using the Resend 
Password feature, you have to create a temporary admin password for logging 
into the administration area. However, you need access to your MySQL database. 
Usually, you get cPanel and phpMyAdmin installed on your server.
For creating a temporary admin account and password to login to the administration 
area, follow these steps:
1.	 Login to cPanel and run phpMyAdmin.
2.	 Click on the SQL tab and run the following query:
	
DELETE FROM admin WHERE admin_name = 'Admin';
	
INSERT INTO admin (admin_name, admin_email, admin_pass,  
	
    admin_level) VALUES ('Admin', 'admin@localhost',  
	
    '351683ea4e19efe34874b501fdbf9792:9b', 1);
	
If you are using a prefix to the Zen Cart database tables, add that prefix with 
the table name, for example, INSERT INTO zc_admin.
3.	 Running the above query will create an admin account with the password as 
admin. Now, you can log in to the admin area using the username admin and 
password admin.
4.	 Change the password and email address once you have logged in to the 
administration area.
Template Related Problems
Zen Cart templates are located in the /includes/templates/ folder. Under this, 
you will find a folder named classic, the files that exist there can be overridden by 
placing a copy of the file you wish to alter inside another folder named after your 
custom template. The name of custom template is defined in the template_info.
php file.
The folder with the template_info.php file, a css folder and the .css files needs 
to be located at includes/templates/your_template. The other folders that are in 
the template_default can be created in your_template folder, such as  includes/
templates/your_template/css and so on. 
Once this is done, you should be able to see the template name from your 
administration area in Tools | Template Selection. If you do not see it there and 
cannot select it, you have done something incorrectly.
Remember that you need to put only the edited files in an override folder. As you 
edit more files in other locations, you will have several folders that are named after 
your template name. Note that, wherever there is a classic folder, you can create a 
template folder to keep your copied and edited files to have an override effect.
 

Chapter 9
[ 281 ]
Image Related Problem
Sometimes, the images shown on your online shop may have problems due to 
inappropriate configurations related to image display or changes in the images 
directory. The following sections highlights two categories of problems related to 
images in the Zen Cart online shop.
Catalog Images Directory
When you are adding products to the catalogue and uploading the product image 
which is uploaded to the /images directory, or a sub-directory under the /images 
directory, the /images directory needs to be writable by Zen Cart. In other words, it 
means that you need to apply CHMOD 777 on this folder (including sub-directories) 
for write access. This should include all subdirectories for /images as well as their 
subdirectories such as:
/images/large
/images/medium
/images/attributes
/images/dvd
/images/large/dvd
/images/medium/dvd
If you do not set appropriate permissions (that is write access), you will not be able 
to upload product images.
The sub-directories in the /images directory needs to be created manually to be 
shown in the drop-down list while selecting image upload location, when adding 
products. Whenever you add a sub-directory, make sure that the sub-directory is 
writable to Zen Cart.
Image Distortion
Sometimes product images on your online shop may appear distorted. This happens 
when the size of your product image is large, but in your configuration display sizes 
have fixed height and width specifications. Distortion happens when your product 
images are not sized in the ratio of the specified height and width.
•
•
•
•
•
•
 

Maintenance and Troubleshooting
[ 282 ]
To get rid of image distortion, first set the image height and width proportions that 
you want to use throughout the online shop catalogue. Then, specify the height and 
width in the administration area from the Configuration | Images screen. Problems 
occur when any of the value for the following option pairs is set to 0:
Small Image Width & Small Image Height
Subcategory Image Width & Subcategory Image Height
Category Icon Image Width—Product Info Pages & Category Icon Image 
Height—Product Info Pages
Product Info—Image Width & Product Info—Image Height
Image—Product Listing Width & Image—Product Listing Height
Image—Product New Listing Width & Image—Product New Listing Height
Image—New Products Width & Image—New Products Height
Image—Featured Products Width & Image—Featured Products Height
Image—Product All Listing Width & Image—Product All Listing Height
Also ensure that Calculate Image Size is set to true, and Use Proportional Images 
on Products and Categories is set to 1. Choosing these options will allow your 
images to be resized according to their own proportions.
Trouble with E-mails
Emails are very important for an online shop. Customers are notified about the status 
of their orders through emails, administrators are also notified by e-mail about new 
orders. Email communication in Zen Cart works fine, once it is configured correctly. 
However, sometimes you may experience troubles in communicating through 
emails. The following sections highlight the email related problems in Zen Cart.
Emails are not Arriving
Sometimes you may face problem in sending emails from your Zen Cart shop. This 
may happen for various reasons. Mostly, it is related to mail server configuration. 
Sometimes, your mail server configuration requires a particular format in which 
messages are to be sent. In such cases, you may try the following options:
1.	 First check whether email transport methods are configured correctly. You 
can see email configuration options from Configuration | E-mail Options. 
2.	 Enable the Emails Must Be Sent From Known Domain? option and also set 
the appropriate email address in the Email Address (sent FROM) field. Zen 
Cart will only send emails from domains specified in your from address.

Chapter 9
[ 283 ]
3.	 Try a different E-mail Transport method. First try php. If that does not solve 
your problem, try SMTP and other methods. If you are using sendmail, try 
using sendmail -f. If SMTP does not work, try SMTPAUTH and provide 
correct login credentials for the SMTP server account.
4.	 Try to send the email to more than one email account. It may so happen that 
the problem resides in the receiving server. Try to send emails to a non-free 
email address; do not test only with Yahoo, Hotmail, or Gmail accounts. 
These email servers have built-in spam protection, and it is likely that the 
mail sent from your Zen Cart shop is redirected to a spam folder, or blocked 
entirely. Checking with some other email accounts will possibly help you 
find the exact cause.
5.	 If your email system has junk mail filters or spam protection, try searching 
for your mail in junk mails or spam folders. Try disabling the protection or 
filter temporarily, and send mails from Zen Cart again.
6.	 Another way to check whether a mail has been sent from your Zen Cart shop 
is to look at email archives. First, enable email archiving by setting the E-mail 
Archiving Active? option value to true. Enabling this will archive all emails 
you are sending from Zen Cart. However, there is no built-in mechanism 
to see archived emails from within the Zen Cart administration area. A 
contribution named Email Archive Viewer can be used for viewing archived 
emails. Download this contribution from the Zen Cart website, install it, and 
use it to see whether Zen Cart has really processed the email for sending. If 
it has been sent, and the email is not delivered to the recipient, the problem 
may be in some other place.
Remember that sending a mail involves PHP script for processing the email, email 
transport and network connectivity. You have to investigate and find the cause for 
non-delivery of the mail, and then take appropriate action to resolve the problem.
Email Transport Methods
Your emails may not be transmitted if you have not configured appropriate 
email transport. You can select email transport in the administration panel from 
Configuration | Email Options. In the E-mail Transport Method field, you can 
select the following methods:
1.	 php: If you choose this method, Zen Cart will send emails using the email 
transport method your web server is configured to use for PHP mail 
commands. In most cases, this will work fine. If this does not work, it is 
possible that the mail host for PHP is not configured.
 

Maintenance and Troubleshooting
[ 284 ]
2.	  smtp or smtpauth: Selecting this transport method will use simple mail 
transfer protocol (SMTP). Use smtpauth if your SMTP mail server requires 
authentication. If you are running your web server on a windows operating 
system, then smtp or smtpauth is your only choice. Remember that when 
you are using the smtp or smtpauth methods, you have to configure mail 
server address in SMTP E-Mail Mail Host and SMTP E-Mail Mail Server 
Port. For smtpauth, you need to configure SMTP E-mail Account Mailbox 
and SMTP E-mail Account Password. Double check these settings if  
you have problems with sending email using smtp or smtpauth  
transport methods.
3.	 sendmail: If you are not running the Windows web server, and the php 
transport method is not working, then you can try sendmail. Selecting this 
method will use sendmail as the email transport method. Before trying this 
method, be sure that your web server has sendmail installed. If you are using 
cPanel for linux hosting, you can see the sendmail path and be sure that it is 
installed and configured for email transportation.
4.	 sendmail –f: You should not try this at first. Use it when sendmail transport 
has some difficulties. This is usually used in some cases where your web 
server configuration has some tighter security requirements. For example, 
busy shared-hosting environments may need this option.
Bounce Handling
You may face problems with bounced emails from newsletter subscribers. By default, 
Zen Cart has no mechanism to handle bounced emails. If you see that newsletters/
emails have bounced back, the first thing you should do is turn off that particular 
subscriber. You can unsubscribe someone by going to the Customers | Customers 
screen. Enter email address in the search box in the upper right corner, and then 
press Enter. When you find the customer with that email address, click on that and 
edit the settings for that customer. Turn off subscription to newsletters.
 

Chapter 9
[ 285 ]
When you find that a customer's email address is not active, or 
newsletters bounce from a particular address, you can email that 
customer directly to test whether their account is really active or not. For 
your store's security, you should not allow any user without a valid  
email address. 
Database Related Errors
Database connection errors are very rare if you continue to use the same server after 
installing Zen Cart. However, connection errors may occur when you are migrating 
to another server, or when you have upgraded your MySQL database server.
In case of database connection errors, you will get exact error messages indicating 
connectivity problems. This error may be connected to the server, or a specific 
database. You will find database connectivity related configurations in the  
/includes/configure.php file. Check the following settings in this file:
// define our database connection
  define('DB_TYPE', 'mysql');
  define('DB_PREFIX', '');
  define('DB_SERVER', 'localhost');
  define('DB_SERVER_USERNAME', 'root');
  define('DB_SERVER_PASSWORD', '');
  define('DB_DATABASE', 'zencart');
  define('USE_PCONNECT', 'false'); // use persistent connections?
The above defines mean:
DB_TYPE : Database type – this is mysql in most of the cases.
DB_PREFIX: If you are using the same database for some other application, 
using a prefix for Zen Cart tables will be useful. If you are using a separate 
database for Zen Cart, you may keep this blank.
DB_SERVER: This is MySQL database server name. If the MySQL database 
server and the web server are the same, the value of this field will be 
localhost. If the servers are separate, mention the hostname of that server.
•
•
•
 

Maintenance and Troubleshooting
[ 286 ]
DB_SERVER_USERNAME: This is the username which will be used to connect to 
the database. Ensure that this user has appropriate permissions to connect to, 
select from, insert into, delete from, and update from the Zen Cart database. 
If you are using cPanel in Linux hosting, a prefix is used before each database 
username. For example, if your hosting account name is suhreed, and you 
create a database user named user1, then the full name of the database user 
becomes suhreed_user1. Also remember that while installing Zen Cart from 
Fantastico, a database user and corresponding password are automatically 
generated which are used for connecting to Zen Cart database. This user 
account is automatically deleted when you uninstall it using Fantastico. 
DB_SERVER_PASSWORD: This is the password for the username mentioned in 
DB_SERVER_USERNAME. Always remember that passwords are case sensitive, 
so you need to type them carefully. The key thing in any connectivity 
problem should be to ensure the password's validity.
DB_DATABASE: This is the type name of the database used for Zen Cart. 
Generally, it is named as zencart or zc. Be sure that database name is 
correctly mentioned in this field.
USE_PCONNECT: Database connection can be persistent or non-persistent. 
Persistent connection remains open for some time. For a small number of 
users, this saves time in establishing connections again and again, and thus 
improves performance. But for a large number of requests to a database, a lot 
of memory may be used for maintaining persistent connection to database. 
If you see that a lot of memory is used up for a database, you may check this 
setting and set it to false.
If you are facing a problem with database connectivity, check whether the database 
itself is running. Try connecting to the database from another application. If you 
can connect to the database from other applications, then it is likely that you have a 
problem with the database configuration for Zen Cart. Check the above variables and 
test the results.
Summary
In this chapter, you have learned about common maintenance and troubleshooting 
activities in a Zen Cart online shop. Once you have set up, configured, and 
customized your online shop and taken it to live production, you need to carry out 
some routine maintenance tasks to keep it running. During maintenance, your shop 
may be down, which can be notified to your customers, from Zen Cart configuration. 
Regular maintenance activities help your shop to run smoothly. However, trouble 
may crop up any time. We discussed some common problems that you may face, in 
this chapter. This chapter has also introduced you to some security features of Zen 
Cart and ways to improve security.

Resources for Zen Cart
In the main text of this book, we have discussed how to install, configure and 
customize a Zen Cart shop. As you are customizing the Zen Cart shop, it is 
recommended that you do all development work in a development environment. 
In the whole process of customizing the Zen Cart shop, we have referred to several 
third-party contributions and web resources. This Appendix shows you how to 
setup a development environment in Windows PC and where to get the third-party 
contributions and other resources on the web.
Setting WAMP server
You need Apache-MySQL-PHP for running Zen Cart. You can use a hosting 
server for hosting Zen Cart shop. However, it is recommended that you do the 
customization of Zen Cart in a development environment. If you are using Windows 
PC, you can use one of the Apache-MySQL-PHP packages. Here we are going to 
discuss how you can set up and configure WAMP on your Windows computer. 
Step 1. Get WAMP Server. WAMP server gives you Apache-MySQL-PHP. Point 
your browser to www.wampserver.com and download the latest version of  
WAMP Server. 
Step 2. Install WAMP Server. Once WAMP Server is downloaded to your computer, 
double click on the installation file. It will be installed, by default, on C:\wamp.  
Under that, there will be a www directory, which is known as the web directory.  
This means all web applications you want to run, should be put inside this folder 
(c:\wamp\www).

[ 288 ]
Step 3. Run WAMP Server. You can configure your WAMP Sever to run when 
Windows starts. Alternatively, you can run it as and when needed. You can start 
WAMP Server from Start | All Programs | Wamp Server | Start Wamp Server. 
When WAMPServer started, you see WampServer icon in the system tray. Click on 
that icon, and you get the Wamp Server menu: 
For starting all services (Apache, MySQL and PHP), click on Start All Services. For 
configuring PHP, go to PHP. You can create databases through phpMyAdmin. To 
see the default page in the web root, click on Localhost, or type http://localhost/ 
in your browser's address bar. It will display a page like this:
 

Appendix A
[ 289 ]
If it works fine, you are done! Your Wamp Server is working – so get ready for the 
next step. 
Step 4. Get Zen Cart installation package. Now it is time to get Zen Cart installation 
package, by which you will install Zen Cart on your local computer. Open your 
browser, and type www.zen-cart.com in the address bar. You will see the Zen Cart 
home page. On the right side there is a download link for latest release (at present 
v.1.3.8a). Click on this link to download the latest release of Zen Cart. 
If you want to download another version of Zen Cart, for example Zen Cart v.1.3.7, 
then go to http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=83781. 
Here you will get download links for all previous versions of Zen Cart. Click one of 
your choices and wait for completion of download. 
Step 5. Unzip Zen Cart package files. Once download is complete, extract the Zip 
file on to your local disk. Generally, you will get a file named zen-cart-v1.3.8-full-
fileset-11302007.zip. I hope that WinZip, WinRAR or some other compression utility 
is installed on your computer. If so, right click on the file and choose Extract here. It's 
better to copy the file in a folder named zencart. Unzipping the files will take some 
time. When finished, go to that zencart folder. You will see the admin, includes, 
and so on folders and some .php files. These all are needed for installing Zen Cart.

[ 290 ]
Step 6. Copy Zen Cart installation files to WAMP web root. Once you have 
unzipped the installation package, the whole folder should be copied to WAMP 
Server's webroot, i.e. C:\wamp\www. Wait until all the files are copied. 
Step 7. Create database for Zen Cart. Before proceeding to Zen Cart installation, first 
create a database for Zen Cart. To create a database, click on WAMP Server icon and 
choose phpMyAdmin or type http://localhost/phpmyadmin/ in your browser's 
address bar. This will open up phpMyAdmin.
In the Create new database text box type the name of database you want to create. 
In this instance, type zencart. Now select collation from the next dropdown field. 
For the zencart database, select utf8_general_ci. Then click Create. You will see 
the zencart database listed in the left pane. You are done with creating the database, 
although no table has yet been defined. Zen Cart installation routine will create the 
necessary tables in this database. 
Step 8. Start installation of Zen Cart. Now it is time to start installation of Zen 
Cart. Open your browser and type http://localhost/zencart/zc_install/ in 
the address bar. This will start Zen Cart installation. Most of the options you can 
configure easily. In the database setup step, type the database name as zencart, and 
username root. Password will remain blank. The whole process of installing Zen Cart 
is detailed in Chapter 2, Installation and Basic Configuration.
