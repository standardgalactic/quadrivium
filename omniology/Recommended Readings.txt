Recommended Readings
A Mathematical Mosaic
Ravi Vakil
One of my favorite books for beginners, an absolutely joyous excursion
through many topics. Vakil is one of the best contest problem solvers in
history, but only modesty and generosity come across in this remarkable
little book.
Martin Gardner's Mathematical Games (CD-ROM)
Martin Gardner
Gardner, who edited the Mathematical Games column of Scientific
American magazine from 1956 to 1981, is, in my opinion, the greatest
English-language mathematical expositor of modern times. He published
dozens of books based on his columns (all now collected on this single
CDs); any of these books contains a wealth of recreational problems along
with many fun and deep essays, always written for the intelligent layperson.
How to Solve It, 2nd Edition
G. Polya
This is the classic book about problem solving. All later books, mine
included, owe a tremendous debt to Polya's pioneering work and writing.
The Art and Craft of Problem Solving, 2nd Edition
Paul Zeitz
My book parallels many of the topics in this course, and has a wide variety
of problems of many levels of difficulty.
