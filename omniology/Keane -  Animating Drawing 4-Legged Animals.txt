Animating Four Legged Creatures
2
The purpose of these notes
is to give a simple approach
to animating a four-footed
creature.
An animator should feel
conﬁdent in the character
he is animating. If not, his
work will lack strength and
conviction.
He needs to feel "free" to
animate and not get
bogged down in complex
anatomy.

Animation Approach
3
3 basic solid masses
connected by a ﬂexible spine.
Note: Leg bones
parallel each other like
a folding chair.
Keep the shapes simple when animating
Overlap shapes for Dimension

Attitude
4
Attitude is ﬁrst, then put it on model
If you aren’t sure
how to draw an
attitude - draw it
using a simpler
2-legged character
ﬁrst.
Let the Entire body reﬂect the attitude.
Follow rhythm from head to tail

Comparative Anatomy

Note angle of thigh bones
of humans points inward...
But when we stand on
our toes the angle points
outward as the heels
point  inward...
...Just as a dogs
Note tuck after ribcage.
(Cats tend not to have this "tuck")
Ribcage same shape/ Necks curve in
the opposite direction due to dog
having to hold head out.

Comparative Anatomy
6
A dogs scapula is located on the side of the
ribcage
Human scapula is
located on the back of
the ribcage.
This placement of the
scapula is why a  dog has
very limited lateral
movement with its front
legs, as compared to the
degree of freedomwe have
with our arms.
Rhythm of human
legs reﬂected in
rear legs of animals.
Longer rear legs give hind end a lift.
Rhythm of arm
bones same as in
dogs.
Horizontal
human ribcage
Vertical animal
ribcage.
Lateral movement on
dogs elbows.
Dogs rear legs are longer than front as are
humans legs longer than the arms.

Comparative Anatomy
7
An animal walks in basically the same pattern as a human crawls.
In a relaxed attitude a dogs
legs are not bent in a
crouching position, just as a
mans are not.
Note straightness of
backlegs particularly.
If they are animated
already bent in a walk
it will be difﬁcult to
show any subtle
squash and stretch.
An animal walks on his toes and "ﬁngers".
This gives his walk a springy, light feel.

Squash & Stretch
8
Build up chest mass in anticipation.
A straight leg will give a better
chance for a subtle squash in
following action.
As weight comes down on the
foreleg, the scapula rises
above backline.

Animation Drawing Points
9
Line of action reverses in animal walks
As animal shifts weight from one leg to the next in a
walk, the hip will drop to the side that has no support.
Opposing tilts
add interest
Note: Angle of hip.
