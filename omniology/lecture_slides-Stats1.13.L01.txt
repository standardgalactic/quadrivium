Lecture 1 ~ Segment 1 
Example 1: Polio Vaccine 
3 
Polio Vaccine 
•  In the first half of the 20th century there 
were approximately 20,000 cases of polio 
per year in the USA 
•  In 1952, there were 58,000 cases

Polio Vaccine 
•  In 1952, the first effective polio vaccine 
was developed by Dr. Jonas Salk 
– How do we know that it was effective? 
•  Experimental research! 
•  Randomized Controlled Experiments 
5 
Polio Vaccine 
•  Sample 
–  Initial 
•  4,000 children from Virginia 
–  Final 
•  1.8 million children from 44 states 
•  Population 
–  All children in the USA 
6 
Polio Vaccine 
•  Independent variable 
– Treatment 
•  Vaccine 
•  Placebo 
•  Dependent variable 
– Polio diagnosis (measure of an individual 
child) 
– Rate of polio (measure of a group of children) 7 
Polio Vaccine 
•  Double-blind experiment 
– Experimenter did not know if the treatment 
was vaccine or placebo 
– Child (and parents) did not know if the 
treatment was vaccine or placebo

Polio Vaccine 
•  Results 
– Rate (per 100,000) 
•  Treatment: 28 
•  Control: 71 
9 
Polio Vaccine 
•  By 1994 polio had been completely 
eradicated from all the Americas 
10 
Segment Summary 
•  The major benefit of randomized 
experiments is they allow for strong claims 
about causality 
– Why stuff happens! 
•  Predict stuff 
•  Prevent bad stuff 
•  Promote good stuff 
11 
Segment Summary 
•  Strong causal claims require: 
– True independent variables  
– Random and representative samples 
– No confounds (impossible, but we try our 
best)

Lecture 1 ~ Segment 2 
Example 2: Memory Training 
14 
Memory Training 
•  Is it possible for adults to enhance their 
intelligence by training their working 
memory? 
– Promote good stuff! 
15 
Memory Training 
•  Sample 
– College students 
•  Population 
– Healthy adults 
16

Memory Training 
•  Independent variable 
– Training 
•  Memory training 
•  No training 
•  Dependent variable 
– Gain in score on an intelligence test  
•  IQ gain 
17 
Memory Training 
•  Procedure 
– Treatment group engaged in memory training 
for a half hour every day for weeks  
•  See next slide 
– IQ  
•  All subjects completed a test of intelligence before 
and after training

Memory Training 
21 
Memory Training 
•  Does it really work? 
– Potential confounds? 
22 
Segment Summary 
•  The major benefit of randomized 
experiments is they allow for strong claims 
about causality 
– Why stuff happens! 
•  Predict stuff 
•  Prevent bad stuff 
•  Promote good stuff 
23 
Segment Summary 
•  Strong causal claims require: 
– True independent variables  
– Random and representative samples 
– No confounds (impossible, but we try our 
best)

Lecture 1 ~ Segment 3 
The concept of random 
26 
Random 
•  Experimental research requires: 
– Random selection 
– Random assignment 
27 
Random 
•  Random selection 
– Individuals included in a sample should be 
randomly selected from the population

•  Random assignment 
– Individuals are randomly assigned to 
conditions
