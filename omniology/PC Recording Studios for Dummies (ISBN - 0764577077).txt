Author’s Acknowledgments
This book wouldn’t have happened without the inspiration and vision of
Senior Acquisitions Editor Steve Hayes. This is my third book with Steve; this
one was just as much fun to do as the first. A hearty thanks to my agent Carol
Susan Roth for making sure I get what’s coming to me.
Books, by nature, are a team effort — and this book is the result of an
extremely talented and dedicated team of professionals: Project Editor Paul
Levesque (my partner in crime for the third time), who reminded me what a
great editor can do for a writer; Technical Editor Erik Scull, who kept me on
the straight and narrow; and Copy Editor Virginia Sanders, whose dry sense
of humor put a smile on my face more than once during this process.
I am especially grateful for the love and support of my wife Beth and my
daughter Tovah, who never cease to amaze me in their capacity to endure
non-stop recording talk.

Introduction
A
s computers have gotten more powerful, they’ve become the standard
tools for recording, editing, and mixing audio. More and more profes-
sional studios are using them because of their power — and more and more
amateurs are using them because they’re also relatively inexpensive and easy
to use.
For many people — especially any technophobic musicians out there (you
know who you are) — the thought of recording on a computer is daunting.
You have to deal with hardware issue (what kind of computer do I get?) and
software issue (how do I work this #@*% thing?). Add to this the sometimes-
complicated workings of the non-audio computer software and you get a
deer-in-the-headlights look from otherwise intelligent, articulate people.
Well, I hear ya. I don’t consider myself a techy (although I fear I might be turn-
ing into one), and getting up-to-speed when it came to recording into a com-
puter left me scratching my head a few times. Luckily for you, I’ve stopped
scratching my head and have managed to make some semblance of sense out
of the whole thing.
About This Book
PC Recording Studios For Dummies is an introduction into the world of 
computer-based audio recording. This book takes the mystery (and frustra-
tion) out of recording into a computer. You discover tips to help you make
the process of recording music easy and the final product sound as good as
possible.
PC Recording Studios For Dummies gets you going quickly so that you can
spend your valuable time recording music — not tweaking your computer
settings.
Here’s a quick rundown of what you can find in this book:
 You discover the basic components of a computer-based recording
studio.
 You find out what hardware and software you need.

 You get hands-on steps guiding you through the computer-based record-
ing process.
 You explore the many powerful add-ons that you can use to take basic
tracks and turn them into the music you hear in your head.
 You discover free (or really cheap) software that you can use to create
your next masterpiece.
The best thing about this book is that you get all this information without
the brain-numbing technical jargon and posturing that you find in so many
computer-related books. After all, the computer should be a tool that you
use to create your art, not an obstacle to it.
Not-So-Foolish Assumptions
As much as I hate to admit this, I made some assumptions about you, the
reader, when I wrote this book. Actually, I think you’ll be glad I did. First, I
assumed you want to record audio into a computer (hence the title: PC
Recording Studios For Dummies) and I assumed that you aren’t a techy but
you know the basics about using a computer, such as how to use a mouse,
load software, and other rudimentary skills. I also assumed that you have
some basic idea of how music is recorded. (If you don’t have any idea about
what the music-recording process entails, you might want to check out one
of my other recording books: Home Recording For Musicians For Dummies —
that is, if you haven’t already read it.)
Aside from these very basic assumptions, I don’t assume that you’ve ever
used a computer to record music before or that you even play any musical
instrument. If you’re a musician, I don’t assume that you make a specific type
of music. Whether you’re making music from the sounds of whales mating or
you’re composing the next top-ten smash hit, the info in this book is equally
relevant. I also assume that when I say “electric bass” you know I’m not refer-
ring to a plastic fish singing “Take Me to the River.”
How This Book Is Organized
PC Recording Studios For Dummies is organized so that you can find the infor-
mation that you want quickly and easily. Each part contains chapters that
cover a specific aspect of the computer recording process.

Part I: Computer Recording Basics
Part I covers the basics of computer-based recording. Chapter 1 introduces
you to the individual components of a computer studio and explains what
everything is for. Chapter 2 shows you how to set up a system so that it is
easy to work with and sounds good. You also look into how you can set up
your studio to sound as good as possible without having to spend a fortune
on acoustical treatments.
Part II: Choosing and Installing
Computer Hardware
Part II gets into gear talk. Here I focus on the hardware you need to have around
if you want to record into your computer. Chapter 3 explores the core of your
system: the computer itself. This chapter covers both Mac and Windows sys-
tems and shows you what to look for when buying or upgrading your computer.
Chapter 4 examines the audio-based hardware you need, such as the audio
and MIDI interface and other components that get the sound in and out of the
digital domain. Chapter 5 walks you through the process of getting all this
hardware hooked up and running properly.
Part III: Choosing and Installing
Recording Software
Part III digs into the software that you need if you want to record audio inside
your computer. Chapter 6 explains the different functions of audio and MIDI
recording programs so you can decide what features you need for your
system. Chapter 7 gives you a look into some of the most popular programs
used for recording, editing, and mixing your music. Chapter 8 guides you
through the process of installing your software into your computer. I cover
both Windows XP and Mac OS X. This chapter gives you the settings you
need to get you up and running, and you find tips to keep your system stable.
Part IV: Revving Up the Recording Process
Part IV kicks your recording process into high gear. Chapter 9 covers the
basics of getting a decent sound from the source and making sure that it
stays decent as it enters your computer. Chapter 10 focuses on the specifics

Introduction

of recording and editing audio, and Chapter 11 keys into this same process
with recording and editing MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface).
Chapter 12 looks at working with loops (short musical snippets that you
can use to compose your songs), and Chapter 13 digs into recording with
software instruments called soft-synths. Chapter 14 gives you information
on mixing and mastering all your tracks within your computer.
Part V: Playing with Plug-Ins
Part V explores the role of plug-ins (software processors that you “plug in” to
your instrument tracks) in computer-based recording. Plug-ins are one of the
most versatile tools for recording in a computer, and you need to understand
them so that you can use them effectively. So, Chapter 15 introduces you to
these powerful tools and shows you the basics of using them in your songs.
Chapter 16 looks at equalizer plug-ins, which you can use to sculpt the fre-
quencies of your tracks. Chapter 17 examines the process of adding effects —
such as reverb and delay — to your recordings. Chapter 18 demystifies
dynamics processors and shows you how to use them to add that certain
je ne sais quoi to the sound of your music.
Part VI: The Part of Tens
A staple of every For Dummies book, this Part of Tens contains some chap-
ters to help you along the way. This section contains three chapters: Chapter
19 offers tips to improve the performance of your system and keep it running
smoothly. Chapter 20 points you to some Internet resources that I’ve found to
be helpful for rounding out my computer recording knowledge. Chapter 21
lists free (or really cheap) software that you can use when you record.
Icons Used in This Book
As with all For Dummies books, I use a few icons to highlight certain informa-
tion that I feel is especially valuable.
Certain techniques are very important or can come in handy on a regular
basis. This icon gives you gentle nudges to put these foremost in your mind.
Throughout the book, I include technical background on certain subjects that
isn’t necessary but can be useful if you like to know the techier side of things.
This icon shows up so that you know to shift mental gears for some dense

Where to Go from Here
I set up this book so that you can either read it cover to cover or jump around
and read only those parts that interest you at the time. For instance, if you’re
getting ready to buy a computer to record on, check out Chapter 3. If you
already have a computer and want to know what software to buy, jump to
Chapters 6 and 7. If you’ve set up your hardware and software and you want
to see how to add effects to your song, go to Chapter 18.
For the most part, starting at Chapter 1 gets you up to speed on this whole
computer-based audio thing and helps you understand where to start down
this road.

Recording Basics

In this part . . .
P
art I gets you started by introducing you to the
basics of computer-based recording. Chapter 1
explores the individual components of a computer studio
and shows you what everything is designed to be used
for. Chapter 2 helps you set up the physical space in
your studio so that you can get the best sound from it.

Chapter 1
Discovering What You Need
In This Chapter
 Understanding the components of a computer-based studio
 Discovering how each component contributes to the final sound
W
hether you use a Windows or Macintosh computer for your home
recording studio, your system of choice employs much of the same
basic technology. In fact, your simple computer-based studio consists of
the same basic components as a typical million-dollar professional studio
complex — they’re just in a different physical format. For example, instead
of the huge mixing board that you see in a commercial studio, you’re going
to be working with a piece of software in your computer. It might not look as
imposing, but it performs the same functions (and then some).
In this chapter, you discover the purpose of each individual component of a
computer-based recording studio — and you also discover how each of these
components relates to the quality of sound that you ultimately get from your
studio. This knowledge will definitely help you when it comes to spending the
right amount of money on the right stuff. (See Chapters 3, 4, and 8 for more
on purchasing gear.)
I use the term component pretty broadly in this chapter and include every-
thing you may use in your studio from preamps and microphones that you
need to capture the sound to the software you use for editing to the blank
CDs you use to store your musical data on.
Looking at the Larger Picture
At first glance, trying to figure out what you need to record your music with
a computer can be confusing. Taking a quick look through this chapter will
probably reinforce this perspective — at least initially. Before you get a brain
cramp trying to figure out the more arcane jargon, here’s a short list of what
a typical computer-based home studio consists of:

 Audio interface: The audio interface is a piece of hardware that allows
you to get sound from the outside world into your computer. Most audio
interfaces contain everything you need to accomplish this task, includ-
ing preamps, direct boxes, AD and DA converters, and a sound card.
Confused by all these components? You won’t be for long — as you read
this chapter, all these items will start making sense to you. Many types
of interfaces are available, each with different features. At least one
option will surely meet your particular needs.
 Computer: This is an obvious one, but it’s an item that confuses a lot of
people. Of course you know you need a computer to make music with a
computer, but the question that always comes up is, “What kind of com-
puter?” I describe the basics of an audio-recording computer later in this
chapter and even dedicate an entire chapter to this seemingly innocent
question (see Chapter 3).
 Input device: Input devices include instruments, mics, and any other
device that lets you input sound into your computer.
 Mastering media: The mastering media is where you put your finished
music. This can be CDs, or it can be in the form of computer files such
as MP3, WAV, AIFF, and others.
 Monitors: Monitors consist of speakers or headphones. These are
important because you need to hear what you’re recording or mixing.
 Software: Music software can vary considerably. You can find simple
programs that let you assemble pieces of pre-recorded music (called
loops) such as Apple’s GarageBand or basic recording programs such as
Guitar Tracks Pro by Cakewalk. You can also find more sophisticated
programs such as MOTU’s Digital Performer or Steinberg’s Cubase —
ones that allow you to record and mix hundreds of audio and MIDI
(Musical Instrument Digital Interface) tracks, software synthesizers, and
limitless effects.
Software can also exist in the form of synthesizers, samplers, and digital
signal processors (DSPs) such as effect plug-ins.
As you’re probably aware, a recording studio can have lots of gear — from a
locker full of microphones and roomful of instruments to a pile of electronic
gear such as preamps, compressors, mixers, and speakers. All this equipment
is seductive, and you could spend all your time fussing with gear and not get
any recording done. (In fact, this happens a lot.) Try not to focus too much
on the equipment. Instead, put your energy into making music.
As you get more and more involved in recording, you’ll find that you can add
almost any of the individual components that I describe in this chapter to
your existing system to expand and enhance what you can do. For example,
even if your audio interface comes with a preamp (or two, or four, or more),
you might want to get hold of a dedicated external preamp to improve the
sound or create a specific effect from your microphones.
10
Part I: Computer Recording Basics 

Interpreting Input Devices
All your expensive recording gear is useless if you have nothing to plug in to
it. This is where the input device comes into play. An input device is, simply,
any instrument, microphone, or sound module that produces or delivers a
sound to the recorder.
Instruments
Your electric guitar, bass, synthesizer, and drum machines are typical of the
instruments that plug in to the interface and represent most of the input
devices that you use in your studio. The synthesizer and drum machine can
plug directly into the Line In inputs of your interface, whereas your electric
guitar and bass need a direct box (or its equivalent) to plug in to first. (Most
audio interfaces allow you to plug directly into one of the preamps, so you
don’t need a separate direct box.)
A direct box is an intermediary device that allows you to plug your guitar
directly into the mixer without going through your amp first. (For more on
direct boxes, see the upcoming section “Deciphering direct boxes.”) Check
out Figure 1-1 for an example of an instrument-input device.
Microphone
A microphone (abbreviated mic) enables you to record the sound of a voice
or an acoustic instrument — sound sources that, last time I checked, couldn’t
be plugged directly into the interface. A mic (shown in Figure 1-2) converts
sound waves into electrical energy that can be amplified by the preamp and
understood by the interface. As you find out in Chapter 3, a lot of different
types of mics are available, and choosing the best one for a particular appli-
cation is like choosing the color of paint to put on a canvas.

Chapter 1: Discovering What You Need

Sound modules and soft-synths
Sound modules are special kinds of synthesizers and/or drum machines. What
makes a sound module different from a regular synthesizer or drum machine
is that these contain no triggers or keys that you can play. Instead, sound
modules are controlled externally by another synthesizer’s keyboard or by
a Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI) controller (a specialized box
designed to control MIDI instruments). Sound modules have MIDI ports (MIDI
jacks) to enable you to connect them to other equipment.
Often sound modules are rack-mountable, meaning they have screw holes and
mounting ears so that you can put them into an audio component rack. Some
controllers, however, are not rack-mountable. Figure 1-3, for example, shows
a drum module that rests on a stand or tabletop.

12
Part I: Computer Recording Basics 

Soft-synths are software versions of sound modules, housed in your computer
as programs. These software programs have no need of external MIDI connec-
tions because they’re virtual sound modules — they live on your computer’s
hard drive. You just insert them into your recording program as plug-ins.
Examining the Audio Interface
In order to record into a computer, you need a device called an audio inter-
face. The audio interface is a piece of hardware that acts as an intermediary
between the analog world of your mics and instruments and the digital world
of your computer. Traditionally (if there can be traditions in such a new tech-
nology), you needed the following pieces of gear:
 Sound card: This card — also called a PCI card because it fits in the
Peripheral Component Interface (PCI) slot in your computer — allows
your computer to read and understand the digital information coming
from and going to the converters. Without a sound card, your computer
doesn’t know what to do with the musical data that it receives (or that
your hard drive stores).
 Analog-to-digital (AD) and digital-to-analog (DA) converters: These
converters allow you to get the sound from your instrument, direct box,
or preamp to the sound card (the AD converter’s job) and from your
computer back out to your monitors (the DA converter’s job).
Nowadays, both the sound card and converters are usually part of the audio
interface, so you don’t have to buy them separately.

Chapter 1: Discovering What You Need

An audio interface also generally contains everything else you need to get
your instruments and mic signals into your computer properly. These compo-
nents include:
 Direct box: A direct box (technically called a Direct Induction Box or DI
box for short) lets you plug your guitar directly into your recording
device (in this case your computer) without having to go through your
amp first.
 Microphone preamp: This is a requirement if you want to plug your mic
into your recording device. The preamp amplifies the signal coming from
your mic so that it can be recorded.
Audio interfaces have different ways of handling both these components. Some
contain preamps that can act as both a microphone preamp and a direct box,
but others also have instrument inputs that function like a direct box and allow
you to plug guitars directly into them. Most audio interfaces have at least two
and as many as eight inputs with preamps. (Chapter 3 shares more on instru-
ment inputs and preamps.)
Audio interfaces come in many varieties — varieties that use one of the three
following ways to connect to your computer:
 Through a PCI card connected to your computer’s PCI slot: This method
is the old standard for getting audio in and out of a computer. PCI-based
interfaces come in several varieties, which include the following:
• Separate sound cards with no analog inputs and outputs.
• Analog inputs and outputs within the card.
• Analog inputs and outputs housed in a separate box (called a
break-out box).
If you want to go the PCI route, make sure that your computer has PCI
slots that are compatible with the PCI interface that you’re considering.
(Not all are; the Digidesign 001, for example, doesn’t work in Mac G5
computers.)
 Through an interface connected to the USB port: This method is handy
because most computers have at least one USB port. The only problem
with USB for recording audio is the relatively slow transfer speed. USB 1.1
generally limits you to two inputs (although you can find some interfaces
with as many as six inputs) and two outputs. It also introduces more
latency — the delay from the audio going in and coming back out of
your computer — than the PCI or Firewire (see the next bullet) options.
(Dealing with latency definitely adds some steps to the recording
process; I spell out the steps for overcoming this problem in Chapter 10.)
14
Part I: Computer Recording Basics 

USB 2.0–compatible interfaces are just beginning to hit the market. USB
2.0 offers a much faster transfer rate than USB 1.1, so the limited input
and latency issues won’t be a problem in the not-too-distant future
(assuming you have both a computer and USB audio interface that func-
tion with USB 2.0).
 Through your FireWire port: FireWire is preferable to USB because
the transfer speed is fast enough to keep latency down to a minimum.
FireWire ports are inexpensive and available on laptop computers as
well as desktop ones, which makes Firewire interfaces more versatile
than PCI-based systems.
Because you have so many audio interface options to choose from, I detail
what to look for in Chapter 3.
Singling out a sound card
A sound card is necessary for your computer to be able to record or play-
back digital audio data. All computers come with a basic sound card, but
for recording music you most likely need to get a better one. Keep in mind,
though, that buying a soundcard separately isn’t your best option because
you’ll still need to get the AD and DA converters and other components that
are included in an audio interface. And all audio interfaces come with a (usu-
ally pretty good) soundcard so a separate sound card isn’t necessary.
Examining AD and DA converters
When you play your instrument or sing into a mic, the signal that you’re pro-
ducing is an analog one. It consists of electrical impulses representing sound
waves. In order for you to record, store, or playback these impulses in your
computer, you need to convert these impulses into and out of digital bits.
(You know, 1s and 0s.) You do this with AD and DA converters.
The quality of the sound of your recordings is hugely influenced by the quality
of your sound card and converters. Because this is such an important part of
the recording puzzle, I explain the intricacies of digital audio conversion,
recording, and playback in Chapter 3. (I make it easy to understand, I promise.)
Before you go out and buy an audio interface, I highly recommend that you
read Chapter 3.
Deciphering direct boxes
A direct box (or DI box, short for Direct Induction) is traditionally used to
connect your guitar or bass directly into the mixer without having to run it
15
Chapter 1: Discovering What You Need

through your amp first. A direct box’s purpose is twofold: to change the
guitar’s impedance level (a guitar has a high impedance, and a mixer has a
low impedance) so it matches your mixer to create the best sound possible,
and to change the nature of the cord connection from unbalanced (quarter-
inch) to balanced (XLR) so you can use a long cord without creating noise.
(For more on cord types and balanced signals versus unbalanced signals, go
to Chapter 5.)
Because you’re unlikely to need a long run of cords from your guitar to your
mixer (the main reason for going from an unbalanced to a balanced connec-
tion), your main purpose in using a direct box is to act as an impedance
transformer (it changes your guitar’s signal from high to low impedance).
Without a direct box changing your impedance levels, your guitar signal
might sound thin or have excess noise.
Depending on how many mics and guitars you want to plug in to your audio
interface (and depending on which interface you have), you might not need
to buy a separate direct box. Most audio interfaces have inputs that can
handle any and all impedance-transforming chores associated with the signal
from your guitar or bass. These are usually the inputs with the preamps
already built in. (See the next section.)
Perusing the preamp
Microphones produce a lower signal level than do line-level devices (synthe-
sizers, for example); thus they need to have their signal level increased.
For this purpose, you need a preamp, a device that boosts a mic’s output.
Preamps can be internal or external, meaning they could reside within your
audio interface or exist as a separate unit that you plug in between your mic
and audio interface.
The preamp is one of the most crucial elements of a recording system. It can
affect your instrument’s sound significantly. Most professional recording stu-
dios have a variety of preamps to choose from, and engineers use a particu-
lar preamp based on the type of sound they’re trying to capture.
The three basic types of preamps available are solid-state, tube, and hybrid.
Solid-state
Solid-state preamps use transistors to boost the level of the mic or instru-
ment. Top-quality (expensive) solid-state preamps are generally designed to
produce a sound that’s clear and accurate (GML and Crane Song brands, for
instance). Solid-state preamps can also be designed to add a pleasing distor-
tion to the music (Neve, API, and Neve-clone preamps, for example). Many
recording professionals prefer the clear and accurate sound of a solid-state
16
Part I: Computer Recording Basics 

preamp for acoustic or classical music or any situation when capturing a
very natural sound is important. The preamps in your audio interface are
solid-state — though certainly not as high a quality as many of the more
expensive external preamps — and are usually designed to more on the
“clean sound” side of the spectrum, rather than the “pleasingly distorted”
side.
Tube
Since the beginning of the digital recording revolution, professionals have
been complaining about the harshness of digital recording. As a result, many
digital-recording pros prefer classic tube preamps because they can add
warmth to the recording. This warmth is actually a distortion, albeit a pleas-
ing one. All-tube preamps are generally very expensive, but they’re highly
sought after among digital recording aficionados because of their sound.
Tube preamps work well with music when you want to add color to the
sound (for example, adding some distortion to your sound source or enhanc-
ing certain pleasing tones in your instrument). No wonder they show up a lot
in rock and blues — and they’re great for recording drums. You can also find
tube preamps that are clean and open, such as those made by Manley Labs.
Hybrid
A hybrid preamp contains both solid-state and tube components. Most of
the inexpensive tube preamps that you find in the marketplace are actually
hybrids. (These are also called starved-plate designs, because the tubes don’t
run the same level of voltage as expensive tube designs.) These types of pre-
amps are usually designed to add the classic tube warmth to your instrument’s
sound. How much the sound is colored by the tubes — and how pleasing that
colored sound is to the listener’s ears — depends on the quality of the preamp.
Most hybrid preamps allow you to dial in the amount of character (pleasing dis-
tortion) that you want. You won’t find a hybrid preamp that sounds as good as
a great (or even pretty decent) solid-state or tube preamp, but you might find
one that works well enough for your needs.
Your audio interface comes with a limited number of solid-state preamps
(usually two to four, but sometimes as many as eight). If you want to plug in
more mics than the number of preamps you have or if you want to be able to
produce different sounds from your preamps, you need to buy one or more
external preamps, such as the one shown in Figure 1-4.

Chapter 1: Discovering What You Need

Clueing In to the Computer
No matter which platform of computer you choose, Mac or PC, the stuff you
find inside your computer plays a major role in determining how smoothly (or
how less-than-smoothly) your computer recording system runs. (Chapter 3
details the best computer setups for audio.)
To set up a computer to record audio properly, you need several things:
 A computer (Preferably with a speedy processor.)
 Bunches (BIG bunches) of memory (The words too much don’t apply.)
 Dual hard drives (One just won’t cut it.)
 An audio interface (See the “Examining the Audio Interface” section ear-
lier in this chapter and also see Chapter 4.)
 The software (See the “Signing On to Software” section later in this
chapter and also see Chapter 3.)
The following list clues you in on the various pieces of hardware that you find
in your computer:
 The CPU: The CPU (processor) is the heart of your computer studio.
The speed of your CPU ultimately dictates just how well any program
runs on it. As a general rule, for audio, get the fastest processor that you
can afford. For most audio software, you need at least a Pentium III for
the PC or a G3 for Mac. If you can afford it, get a dedicated computer —
one that you have specifically set aside for recording audio — because
running other types of applications (such as home finance, word proces-
sors, or video games) can cause problems with your audio applications
and reduce the stability of your system.
 Memory: Computer-based audio programs and all their associated plug-
ins are RAM (random access memory) hogs. My advice: Get a lot of
RAM. Okay, that’s not very specific, but how much you really need
depends on your recording style. If you do a lot of audio tracks and want
reverb or some effect on each track, you need more RAM (and a faster
processor).
Many recording software programs recommend a minimum of 384MB
of RAM, but you should really get a lot more. And I mean a lot more. At
least a gigabyte, but you can never have too much. Also, don’t skimp on
the quality of the RAM you use. Cheap RAM is worse than no RAM at all,
so I recommend that you buy name brand RAM.
Regardless of the platform you choose (PC or Mac), keep in mind that
you can never have too fast a processor or too much memory.
18
Part I: Computer Recording Basics 

 Hard drives: To record audio, be sure you get the right type of hard
drives. Notice how I said hard drives (plural). Yep, you should get more
than one if you want to record more than a few tracks of audio. You want
one hard drive to hold all the software and the operating system — and
another drive just for the audio data. Having two greatly increases the
likelihood that your system remains stable and doesn’t crash on you,
especially if you try to run 16 or more tracks.
As for the size of the hard drive, bigger is better, at least in the audio
drive where you store your music. For the core system drive, you can
get by with a 10GB (gigabyte) drive; for the audio, 20GB is still pretty
conservative because audio data can take up a ton of space. For exam-
ple, a 5-minute song that has 16 audio tracks recorded at a 24-bit resolu-
tion and 44.1-kHz bandwidth would take up about 600MB of hard drive
space (that’s about 7.5MB per track minute).
Choose your hard drives wisely. For the software hard drive, you can
get away with a stock drive (usually the one that comes with your com-
puter). But for the audio, you need a drive that can handle the demands
of transferring audio data at high speed. The main things you want to
look for are
• Spindle speed: Also called rotational speed, this is the rate at which
the hard drive spins. For the most part, a 7,200 rpm (rotations per
minute) drive works well for recording and playing back audio.
• Seek time: This is the amount of time the drive takes to find the
data stored on it. You want an average seek time under 10 ms 
(milliseconds).
• Buffer size: Often called cache buffers, these memory units store
data as it’s being transferred. You want a buffer size of at least 2MB.
The track count that your system can handle is directly related to the speed
of your hard drive — the faster the drive, the more tracks you can record and
play back at once. (Of course, the type of drive you get determines how large
a role your processor plays.) My current choice for a drive is a Maxtor 7,200
rpm ATA IDE drive with an 8.5 ms seek time and 2MB cache buffer. A 100GB
drive currently costs around $100.
Signing On to Software
One thing I guarantee is that you won’t have a hard time finding a piece of
software that meets your musical needs. Heck, I’ll even go so far as to guaran-
tee that choosing the best software among the plethora of options won’t be
easy. I’m sorry if this bursts your bubble, but someone had to say it. Yep, the
options for audio are endless. (Well, almost endless.) Even though I explore
19
Chapter 1: Discovering What You Need

audio software in detail in Chapters 7 and 8, here’s a quick rundown on the
basic components of audio recording software:
 The mixer: The mixer lets you adjust the level (volume) of your instru-
ments, route your signals where you want them, and add effects or other
digital signal processing to your tracks. The mixer is one of the most
important pieces of gear in a recording studio — even a computer-based
one. All audio recording software contains a mixer.
 The arranger: The arranger is where you can organize your musical
ideas. All audio recording software has some sort of arrange function.
 The editor: One of the best things about computer-based recording is
that you can generally do sophisticated editing of the audio data. The
editing capabilities of the many software programs vary considerably.
Some — such as Pro Tools — have very powerful audio editing while
others — can you say “Logic Pro” — have very powerful MIDI editing.
 MIDI sequencer: MIDI (short for Musical Instrument Digital Interface —
a communication protocol for musical instruments) is often part of
audio recording software and — like editing capabilities — the MIDI
capabilities in the different programs vary. Pro Tools, for example, is
known for having rudimentary MIDI capabilities, whereas SONAR and
Logic Pro have powerful MIDI features.
 Digital signal processor: Digital signal processing (DSP) is anything you
do to the sound of your audio data other than adjust the volume. This
includes equalization, dynamics processing, and effects processing (and
many other kinds of tweaks).
Meeting the mixer
The mixer is the heart of any recording system. Although the mixer might
seem daunting with all its knobs, buttons, sliders, and jacks — take a look at
Figure 1-5 to see what I mean — it’s really one of the most interesting and ver-
satile pieces of equipment in your studio. With the mixer, you can control the
volume level of the incoming signal, adjust the tonal quality of an instrument,
blend the signals of two or more instruments together, and a host of other
things. And don’t worry; as you read through this book, you get the hang of
all those knobs in no time.
For the computer-based home recordist (that’s you), the mixer is incorpo-
rated into your computer software. (Of course, you can always use an exter-
nal hardware mixer if you want, but it’s not necessary.)
20
Part I: Computer Recording Basics 

The mixer in all the audio recording software programs does the job well
enough that you don’t need an external mixer, although some people prefer
having physical faders and knobs to mess with. If you’re a knob-turner and
like to physically touch the instrument you’re playing (or, for that matter,
the gadget you’re tweaking), I heartily recommend that you get a dedicated
computer-control surface, such as the Mackie Control (shown in Figure 1-6).
A computer-control surface is a unit that lets you get your knobs and faders
while still using the internal mixer in your recording software. This can be an
advantage because it eliminates the need for lots of analog-to-digital conver-
sions (ADCs) and digital-to-analog conversions (DACs). (And that’s not count-
ing the actual converters, which can cost a lot of money.) On the other hand,
if you prefer clicking a mouse or typing on a keyboard (the kind with letters
on the keys), choose a software version.

Accessing the arranger
Audio software makes arranging your musical ideas very easy. Usually with just
a click-drag of your mouse you can move sections of data around. Figure 1-7
shows a screen shot of a typical arrangement window. From this window you
can perform any number of functions, including trying alternate arrangements
for your song; taking the best parts of your performances and placing them
exactly where you want them; and countless others.
Exploring the editor
Being able to make miniscule edits to your recorded performances is one of
the reasons many people want to record on a computer. Between the usually
large video monitor that most people have and the functions of most audio
recording programs, editing is a breeze. Check out Figure 1-8 for a look at the
editing window for a popular brand of software. From this window you can
improve the quality of your music dramatically with the help of a few editing
tricks — getting rid of unwanted noise (those darned chair squeaks, for

example) or fixing the occasional bad note in an otherwise inspiring perfor-
mance, to name a few. Of course the downside is editing too much and sucking
the life out of a performance, but you wouldn’t do that (would you?). Chapter 6
talks about editing capabilities in some of the more popular brands of software,
and Chapter 11 explores how to use these capabilities with your music.

Chapter 1: Discovering What You Need

Managing the MIDI sequencer
A MIDI sequencer is where you can record MIDI performance data into your
computer for playback and editing. MIDI sequencing allows you to record
your performance and choose the sound that accompanies it later on. The
MIDI data that you record is simply performance information, such as when
a note is played, the velocity (volume) of the note, and when the note was
released, to name a few.
MIDI (Music Instrument Digital Interface) is a protocol that musical instrument
manufacturers (in a rare moment of cooperation) developed to allow one digi-
tal instrument to communicate with another. MIDI uses binary digital data, in
the form of 1s and 0s, to tell an instrument to play or release a note, to change
sounds, and a host of other messages. Chapter 4 explains more about the other
gear you need to do MIDI in your studio, and Chapter 11 lays out how to use
MIDI for your musical ideas.
Most audio recording software contains some sort of MIDI sequencing capa-
bilities. Some are fairly simple and let you record, playback, and edit the
data, but others offer much more advanced features that let you work with
the data in intricate ways. Check out Figure 1-9 to see a couple MIDI windows
in a MIDI powerhouse program.
Digging into digital signal
processors (DSPs)
Part of the recording process involves making adjustments to a sound either
before or after it’s been recorded. This is the job of the signal processor.
Signal processors come in three varieties — equalizers, dynamic processors,
and effects processors. They can be incorporated into the system or work as
separate, standalone units. For most home recordists, the signal processors

MIDI is easy
to use in
most audio-
recording
software
programs.
24
Part I: Computer Recording Basics 

of choice are integrated into the software as plug-ins, although you can also
use external processors by sending the audio out of your computer and back
in again.
Equalization (EQ)
Equalizers enable you to adjust the frequencies of a sound in a variety of
ways. In effect, you tell the frequencies to
 Go away: You can get rid of unwanted noise or an annoying ringing by
reducing select frequencies.
 Come hither: Add life or presence to an instrument by bringing the best
characteristics of that instrument forward.
 Scoot over: You can make room within the frequency spectrum for each
of the instruments in your mix by selectively boosting or cutting certain
frequencies.
You can find out more about EQ (and discover some great EQ tips and tricks)
in Chapter 16. The three main types of EQ are graphic, shelf, and parametric.
Here’s the rundown:
Graphic EQ
Use graphic equalizers to choose a specific frequency to increase or decrease
by a certain amount, generally up to 6 or 12 decibels (dB). Doing so enables
you to eliminate an offending frequency from the signal or make other adjust-
ments to the tonal quality of the source signal. The graphic EQ will have a
certain number of frequency bands that you can adjust. You’re limited to only
those frequency bands that your EQ has available. Figure 1-10 shows a typical
graphic EQ.
Shelf EQ
A shelf equalizer affects a range of frequencies above or below the target 
frequency. Shelf EQs are generally used to roll off the top or bottom end of
the frequency spectrum. For example, you can set a shelf EQ to roll off the

25
Chapter 1: Discovering What You Need

frequencies below 250 Hz (hertz) to reduce the amount of rumble (low-
frequency noise) in a recording. You can see how this looks in Figure 1-11.
Notice how the shelf EQ gradually reduces the amount of energy (sound)
below the set point and then levels off: hence, the shelf in its name.
Parametric EQ
The parametric equalizer enables you to choose the specific frequency that
you want to affect, as well as the range of frequencies to put around that fre-
quency. With a parametric EQ, you dial in the frequency that you want to
change, and then you set the range (referred to as the Q) — that is, the
number of octaves that the EQ will affect. Check out Figure 1-12: The two 
diagrams show how the Q relates to the range of frequencies affected. (The
higher the Q setting, the narrower the band of frequencies affected.)
The beauty of a parametric EQ is that you can take a small band (range) of
frequencies and add or cut them. Doing this allows you to get the various
instruments in a mix to fit in with one another (called carving out frequencies).
For example, a lot of times the bass guitar gets lost behind the booming fre-
quencies of the kick drum (200–500 Hz). By setting the Q to cover this fre-
quency range and setting the level at about –6dB (reducing by 6 decibels),
you effectively make room for the bass guitar to be heard in the mix.
You’ll find that the parametric EQ is one of your most useful tools when
mixing all your individual tracks into a stereo pair (part of the mixing process
covered in Chapter 14). I describe this tool in detail in Chapter 16.
Dynamic processors
Dynamic processors are devices that regulate the amount of sound (energy)
that passes through them. This amount is defined as the dynamic range — the
range between the softest sound and the loudest sound. Dynamic processors
come in three varieties: compressors/limiters, gates, and expanders. I explain
each variety in the following sections.
−4dB
250Hz
0dB
Figure 1-11:
A shelf

works this

26
Part I: Computer Recording Basics 

Dynamic processors are useful in a variety of ways. Use them to
 Control the signal going into the mixer and recorder.
 Tame the levels and correct the effects of an erratic musical perfor-
mance when mixing.
 Optimize the levels of the finished stereo tracks when mastering — the
final step in making your music. (Chapter 14 covers mastering in greater
detail.)
Dynamic processors are some of the most useful tools that you have in your
home studio. See Chapter 18 for more on dynamic processors.
Compressors/limiters
The compressor’s job is to compress the dynamic range of the sound being
affected. The purpose of the compressor is to eliminate transients (unusually
loud notes) that can create clipping (digital distortion). The compressor
limits not only how loud a note can be, but it also reduces the difference
between the loudest and softest note (compressing the dynamic range).
Compressors are used extensively on vocals; the device keeps transients at
bay by gently reducing the highest level that goes through it. Compressors

are also used in mastering to raise the overall volume of a song without creat-
ing distortion. The device does this by reducing the overall dynamic range,
and as a result, a compressor effectively raises the volume of the softer notes
without allowing the louder notes to be too loud and distorting.
A limiter works much like the compressor, except that it severely limits the
highest level of a sound source. The limiter is basically a compressor on
steroids: It gives you beefed-up control over volume. Any signal above a cer-
tain level, called the threshold, gets chopped off rather than compressed (as
with the compressor). A limiter is a good choice in extreme situations, such
as when you want a really in-your-face snare drum sound. In this instance,
the limiter essentially eliminates any dynamic variation from the drummer’s
snare drum hits and makes them all as loud as possible.
Gates
A gate is basically the opposite of the limiter. Rather than limiting how loud a
note can get, the gate limits how soft a note can get. The gate filters out any
sound below a certain setting (the threshold) while allowing any note above
that threshold to be heard.
Recordists often use gates on drums to keep unwanted sounds from the cym-
bals from bleeding through to the tom-tom or snare drum mics, or on guitars
by refusing to allow the noise generated by guitar effects to be heard when
the instrument isn’t playing.
Expander
The expander is basically the opposite of a compressor — instead of attenuat-
ing (reducing the volume of) the loudest notes in a performance, an expander
attenuates the softest notes. For example, if you have a singer whose breath
you can hear in the mic and you want to get rid of that particular blemish,
just set the expander to go on at a level just above the annoying breath
sounds, and it will subtly drop out the offending noise.
Effects processors
Effects are historically used to mimic real-world situations. As a home
recordist, you’ll likely discover a great affinity toward your effects processors
because they enable you to create sonic environments without having to rent
some great recording room. For example, imagine dragging your drums and
all your recording equipment into a large cathedral, setting them up, and
spending several hours getting the mics placed just right. Sounds like a lot
of work, right? (I get tired just thinking about it.) Well, how about recording
your drums in your modest home studio and simply choosing the “cathedral
hall reverb” patch instead? Now that’s much easier.
I can practically guarantee that you’ll use effects processors all the time in
your studio. Scope out Chapter 17 for how to use them effectively.
28
Part I: Computer Recording Basics 

In the world of effects processors, you have many choices, and many more
show up every year. The most common effects processors are (in no particu-
lar order) reverb, delay, chorus, flanger, and pitch correction. Read on for the
lowdown on each type.
Reverb
Reverb is undoubtedly the most commonly used effects processor. With
reverb, you can make any instrument sound as if it were recorded in almost
any environment. Reverb, a natural part of every sound, is the result of the
sound bouncing around inside a room. The larger the room, the more pro-
nounced the reverb. The purpose of a reverb in audio production is to make
an instrument sound more natural (especially because most instruments are
recorded in small, non-reverberant rooms) or to add a special effect. Reverb
can make almost any recorded instrument sound better — if used correctly.
Delay
Think of delays as the recording studio’s version of an echo. The delay can be
set to happen immediately after the original sound or be delayed much longer.
Delay can sound natural or be used as a spacey special effect. You can have a
single echo or multiple delays (very common with the snare drum in reggae
music, for instance). Delays are commonly used on vocals and guitar, although
you can hear them on just about any instrument, depending on the style of
music.
Chorus
A chorus effect can make one instrument sound like several. Chorus effects
add very-slightly-off-tune versions of the unaffected sound, which results in a
fuller sound. You find chorus effects used on vocals, guitars, and lots of other
melodic instruments.
Flanger
A flanger (pronounced flanj-er) effect is similar to a chorus effect in sound
except that the flanger gets its sound from delaying part of the affected sound
in relation to the original, rather than altering its pitch. Recordists sometimes
use flangers on background vocals and solo instruments to add an interesting
texture. This is a unique sound that you recognize almost immediately upon
hearing it.
The flanger effect comes from the early days in recording. You create the
flanger effect the old-fashioned way by using a two-track recorder to record
a duplicate track of the track that you want to flange. You then play the two
identical parts back at the same time and gently press against the edge of
the two-track tape (the one with the duplicate part) while it’s running. This
delays certain parts of the sound slightly and drastically changes the charac-
ter of the instrument.
29
Chapter 1: Discovering What You Need

Nowadays, you can just choose the flanger patch (sound) on your effects
processor to get this sound. Isn’t technology great?
Pitch correction
Pitch correction, like its name suggests, is used to correct an out-of-tune note.
You can use this effect to help a singer or an instrument player sound better
by fixing those notes that are slightly out of tune. Pitch correction (also called
auto-tune) has gotten a bad rap lately (mainly from its overuse and potential
for abuse with a singer who can’t sing in key). When used sparingly and appro-
priately, pitch correction can make an otherwise decent vocal performance
really shine. It can also be used to create some interesting effects, such as that
robotic vocal sound that you hear on so many of the pop songs on the radio
nowadays. An easily distinguished example would be the lead vocal on Cher’s
“Believe.”
Monitors
To record and mix music, you need to be able to hear it. (Hey, obvious facts
need love, too.) Monitors make this happen. You can use headphones or
speakers as monitors; most home studios use both. Monitors are an essential
part of a recording studio because you need to get what you’re recording and
mixing into your ears for you to make sure that it sounds good.
Without good speakers, you won’t know what your mixes are going to sound
like on other speakers. (Find out more about mixing in Chapter 14.)
Headphones
Chances are that your first home studio will be in a spare bedroom or a
corner of your garage or basement. All your recording, monitoring, and
mixing will be done in this room. If that’s the case, you’ll find that a set of
headphones is indispensable. When you use headphones, you can turn off
your speakers and still hear what’s being (or has been) recorded. When you
go to record a guitar with a mic in front of the guitar amp, you want to hear
only the guitar — not the guitar amp and the guitar amp coming back through
your monitors. A good pair of headphones will allow you to do this. (See
Figure 1-13.)
30
Part I: Computer Recording Basics 

Speakers
For most home recordists, the first set of monitors consist of the home stereo
system, but sooner or later you’re gonna want a real set of monitors. Studio
monitors come in many varieties, but the home recordist’s best bet is a set of
near-field monitors. Near-field monitors are designed to be positioned close to
you (which is often the case anyway because most home recordists have very
little room in which to work).
Near-field monitors come with or without an amplifier. The amplified moni-
tors are called active monitors, and the non-amplified monitors are referred
to as passive monitors. Which type of monitor you choose depends on your
budget and whether you like the idea of the amp coming with the speakers or
prefer to purchase the amp separately. Figure 1-14 has a picture of an active
near-field monitor. The amplifier is located inside the speaker cabinet.
Figure 1-13:

31
Chapter 1: Discovering What You Need

If you end up getting passive monitors, you need to buy an amplifier to send
power to the speakers. The amplifier connects to the outputs of the mixer
and boosts the signal to the speakers. A good power amp should be matched
in power to work well with whatever speakers you have.
Mastering Media
After you mix your music, you need to put your final music on something. The
two most common media for home recordists are CDs and raw computer files.
Which medium you choose depends on what your goals are. For instance, if
you intend to send your finished mix out to a mastering house, you’re better
off saving it as raw audio data in a computer file. On the other hand, if you
master your music yourself and just want to have it duplicated (or you want
to give copies for your friends to play), you would want to use a CD.

Part I: Computer Recording Basics 

CD
With the cost of CD-R (write) and CD-RW (rewrite) drives plummeting, CD
mastering is the only choice for most home recordists. With CDs, you can
back up large amounts of data at a very low cost and burn audio CDs that
can play in any CD player. You can even send out your mastered CD to be
duplicated and packaged for retail sale. (Chapter 14 explains the process for
burning CDs.)
Computer files
Sometimes you won’t want to master your music directly to CD. You might
decide to have a professional mastering house do it, or maybe you want to
put your music on the Internet. In those situations, store your recordings as
computer files. The following sections describe the most commonly used file
formats for storing recorded music.
WAV and AIFF
WAV and AIFF (Audio Interchange File Format) files are the formats for audio
files found with most professional audio software. The advantage to saving
your music to WAV or AIFF is that when you hand over a CD containing your
WAV and/or AIFF files to a mastering house, the recorded sound is actually in
a higher-quality format than that of the finished CD (provided your recorder
records in 20 or 24 bit, which most do). You can also take your music files to
any other studio that supports these file formats and work with them there.
MIDI
A MIDI file isn’t an audio file; rather, it’s a data file that contains MIDI informa-
tion that can be transferred from one computer to another. An advantage to
MIDI files is that they take up less room than an audio file. The disadvantage
is that they contain only the MIDI information and no sound. To play a MIDI
file, you have to have a sound module. And the sound you get from the file
depends entirely on what sound source you use, such as the particular key-
board or soft-synth.
MP3
MP3 is a file format that has become quite popular on the Internet. Its advan-
tage over audio CDs and other computer files is that it takes up less room. Its
disadvantage is that the data is compressed, and the sound quality isn’t nearly
as good as that of commercial CDs (contrary to what MP3 proponents claim).

Setting Up Your Recording Space
In This Chapter
 Creating an efficient space in which to work
 Making your room sound good
M
aking great-sounding recordings requires many things: good music and
musicians, decent gear, solid engineering skills, and a room that sounds
good. Let me repeat that last one because this is the most overlooked aspect
of making great-sounding music for home recordists — a decent-sounding
room. Although most professional studios spend tons of money on making
their rooms sound great, you don’t have to (as if you could). With a little
elbow grease, some rudimentary carpentry skills, and the tips contained in
this very chapter, you can make whatever room you set up as your recording
space sound pretty decent. In fact, the ideas and strategies I offer here can
make your room sound as good as a professionally-designed studio (well,
almost). Because it’s unlikely that your room is perfect for all your recording
needs, I also offer some ideas to get great sounds without the big budget
found in professional circles.
Professional studios also take great care to create an environment that is con-
ducive to working efficiently. Most home recordists, on the other hand, put
their computer in the corner of a bedroom, hook up a mic or instrument, and
call it a studio.
The “pile it up in a corner and call it a studio” approach isn’t the only way to
go. In this chapter, I help you set up your space so that it has the ergonomic
feel that’s needed to get a lot done (and get a lot done quicker). Regardless of
whether you set up in your bedroom, in your basement, or in the corner of
your living room, you’ll be able to work as efficiently as possible.
Preparing Your Room
Whether your studio is in the corner of your bedroom, in a spare room, a
basement, or a garage, getting it set up so that you can work there efficiently
will save you tons of time and aggravation down the road. This section offers

some tips for getting the most out of the limited space that you have available.
(I’m assuming your space is limited. I know mine is — it seems that no matter
how much I have I still don’t have enough.)
Creating an efficient working environment
I hope you’ll spend a great number of hours in your studio creating some
excellent music (possibly to the dismay of the rest of your family). One
important thing to keep in mind is that you need to be comfortable.
Setting up your workstation
First, get a good chair and set up your workstation to be as easy to get
around as possible. Figure 2-1 shows a classic L setup. Notice that everything
you need is within arm’s reach. If you have enough room, you might want to
consider a U-shaped setup instead. You can see that in Figure 2-2.

Part I: Computer Recording Basics 

Monitoring your monitor placement
If you have a set of near-field monitors — the kind that are designed to be
placed close to you — set them up so that they’re the same distance from each
other and from you, at a height that puts them level with your ears. Figure 2-3
illustrates the best placement for your monitors. Placing your monitors this
way ensures that you hear the best possible sound from them and can accu-
rately hear the stereo field. (For more on the stereo field, see Chapter 14.)
Working efficiently
Aside from creating a basic equipment layout that works for you, here are
some additional things to consider when setting up your studio (and working
in it):
 Get organized. Spend some time finding (or creating) places for all your
gear and put the gear in those places. Make labels for items like mic and
instrument cords (colored tape or tags work well).

Chapter 2: Setting Up Your Recording Space

 Eliminate distractions. Turn off the phone, get off the Internet, close the
door, and don’t answer if anyone knocks. These are a few of the many
things you can do to get rid of distractions that will inevitably pop up
when you try to do some work in your studio.
 Keep essential gear handy. For example, I record a lot of drums (and I
mean a lot), and they need to be miked properly to get the best sound.
Because I’m also composing as I work, I keep several mics up on stands
and plugged in so that if I’m inspired to lay down a bodhran part all I have
to do is grab the drum off a rack, get in front of the right mic, make a
minor adjustment to the preamp level (and turn on phantom power to
power up the mic if it’s not already on), and play. Compare this sequence
with having to dig around for the right mic, locate a cord, plug it in to the
mic, find a stand and attach the mic to it, connect the cord to the preamp,
dial in the preamp level, adjust the mic placement, readjust the preamp
level, and so on.
 Distinguish between the producing, engineering, and creating tasks.
Because most home recordists take on all these roles in their studios,
you need to be diligent in keeping tabs on which one you perform at a
given time. For example, on some days you want to work out ideas for
your next song. On these days, take off your engineering hat and stop
tweaking knobs. If you don’t, before you know it the time you set aside
for working out ideas has been spent, and all you have to show for it is
a perfectly dialed-in preamp.

Part I: Computer Recording Basics 

Inspiring creativity
It’s easy to forget in the midst of all this recording-gear talk that making music
is a creative endeavor. It’s also easy to forget that creative juices need to flow in
order to actually get anything done. As any artist worth his or her salt will tell
you, the muse is fickle, and accessing inspiration can be tough. The last thing
you need is to create an environment or approach to recording that saps your
creativity.
I can’t tell you how many home studios I walk into that are about as inspiring
to work in as a prison cell (not that I know anything about the aesthetic of
prison cells, mind you). Anyway, I highly recommend that you spend some
time and money creating a place that you want to go into, a place that helps
get you in touch with your muse. For some people, it’s candles, incense, and
lava lamps. For someone else, it might be stark white walls and angular metal
furniture. Get in touch with your own inner interior designer and get creative
in making a special place that says, “Creativity happens here.” This way you’ll
want to go to your studio and you’ll feel inspired when you get there.
Taming heat and dust
The number-one enemy of electronic equipment is heat. Dust is a close second.
Try to set up your studio in a room that you can keep cool and fairly dust-free.
Air conditioning is a must for most studios. Be careful with a window air condi-
tioner, though; it can make a lot of noise, requiring you to shut it off when you
record. Depending on where you live, this could heat up your room really fast.
To deal with dust, try to cover up your equipment when you’re not using it,
especially your mics. A plastic bag placed over the top of a mic on a stand
works well.
Quieting your computer
Unless you work on a laptop that doesn’t have a fan, you’re going to find that
your computer makes quite a bit of noise. In fact, why don’t you go give it a
listen right now. I’ll wait. . . .
It’s noisy isn’t it? This is a problem because most people are used to putting
their computer’s CPU unit either on or under their desks. If you record with a
microphone in your room, all the computer noise is going to end up on your
track. This can cause problems even if you don’t use mics when you record.
The constant whirring of the fans and hard drives will make it difficult for
you to properly hear what’s coming out of your monitors. This can result in
you recording tracks that don’t sound right or mixing your music less than
optimally.
39
Chapter 2: Setting Up Your Recording Space

You can reduce the sound from your computer in three basic ways:
 Put the computer’s CPU unit in another room. If you have a closet or an
adjoining room that you can put your CPU unit in, this is the easiest and
safest solution. For most computers, all you have to do is get extension
cords for your video monitor(s), keyboard, and mouse and run the cords
through a hole in the wall. The cords cost only a few dollars. (I have a
Mac tower with an LCD screen — the most expensive configuration for
extending video cables — and it cost me under $100 to run two video
monitors an extra 8 feet.)
 Put the main CPU unit in an isolation box. You can create a box (much
like the amp isolator box that I describe later in this chapter) to put your
computer into. This approach isn’t quite as simple as putting an amp in a
box because you need to make sure that computer gets cool air to keep it
from overheating. This requires insulated ducts and fans that are sized
properly for your computer. It can and has been done, so if you don’t
have the option of putting your CPU in another room, you can use this
approach. Just make sure that you don’t let your computer overheat —
otherwise, you might fry the internal components such as hard drives,
motherboard, or CPU board. You can find some links to articles about
boxing a computer on my Web site at www.jeffstrong.com.
 Liquid cool it. For many hardcore users, liquid cooling is preferable to
boxing the computer. (Using a separate room is still the preferred option
if it’s at all possible.) Liquid cooling means eliminating the fans in your
computer and replacing them with components that allow you to run
cool water over your computer’s critical components such as hard
drives, motherboards, and processor chips. For some computers, that
process is relatively easy because the parts are readily available. For
others — computers such as the Mac G4 or G5 towers — finding the
parts can be a hassle. You can expect to spend a few more dollars on
liquid cooling than you would spend on running longer cords and
drilling small holes into an adjoining room. For some links to resources
on liquid cooling, go to my Web site at www.jeffstrong.com.
Whichever option you choose, you’ll benefit because your music will sound
better, so I encourage you to adopt one of these three approaches.
Optimizing Sounds in Your Room
Chances are that your studio occupies a corner in your living room, a spare
bedroom, or a section of your basement or garage. All these spaces are less-
than-ideal recording environments. Even if you intend to record mostly by
plugging your instrument or sound module directly into the mixer, how your
room sounds will have a big effect on how good your music turns out to be.
40
Part I: Computer Recording Basics 

As a home recordist, you’re unlikely to have easy access to the resources that
create a top-notch sound room. Commercial studios spend serious cash — up
to seven figures — to make their rooms sound, well, professional. You don’t
need to spend near that amount of money (you mean you don’t want to sell off
your private jet?) to get great-sounding recordings. All it takes is a little under-
standing of the way sound travels, some ingenuity, and a little bit of work.
Keeping the sound in or out of your room
One of the concerns that you (and your neighbors) are probably going to have
when you start recording in your home is the amount of sound that gets in
and out of your room. Sound waves are nasty little boogers. They get through
almost any surface, and there’s not a lot you can do to stop it from happening.
You’ve probably noticed this phenomenon when somebody with a massive
subwoofer in his car drives by blasting some obnoxious music. (Ever notice
how someone else’s music is obnoxious whereas your music never is, no
matter how loud you play it? Amazing.) Your windows rattle, your walls
shake, and your favorite mug flies off the shelf and breaks into a thousand
pieces. Well, this is one of the problems with sound: It’s physical energy.
The best (and classic) way to isolate your studio room from everything around
it is to build a room within a room. This essentially involves building a six-sided
box just inside the floor, ceiling, and walls of your existing room. The trick with
this approach is that the box you build in your room has to be isolated from
the structure of the room itself. If it’s not, the vibration simply travels from
your inner room to the outer one — or vice versa. Most pros use rubber mem-
branes to create this isolation. The process can get pretty involved, so I don’t
go into detail here, but you can go to my Web site (www.jeffstrong.com) to
find some links to resources to get you started.
For the purpose of most home recordists — folks who usually don’t have the
money or space to build a room within a room — the best thing you can do is
to try to understand what noises are getting in and getting out and deal with
those. For example, if you live in a house or apartment with neighbors close
by, don’t record live drums at night. You could also consider using a drum
machine or electronic drum set (plugged directly into the recorder) instead.
Another idea is to try to choose a room in your house or apartment that is
farthest away from outside noise (an interior room, for instance). Basements
also work well because they’re underground, and most of the sound gets
absorbed by the surrounding dirt and earthworms. Installing a little fiber-
glass batting insulation in the ceiling — typical house insulation that you can
find at your local home center — can isolate you pretty well from anyone
above the basement. Detached garages are generally farther away from other
buildings, so sound has a chance to dissipate before it reaches your neigh-
bors (or before your neighbors’ noise reaches your garage).

Chapter 2: Setting Up Your Recording Space

Also keep these things in mind when trying to isolate your studio:
 Dead air and mass are your friends. The whole concept of a room
within a room is to create mass and still air space so that the invading or
escaping sound gets trapped there. When you work on isolating your
room, try to design in some space that can trap air (creating dead air) —
such as a suspended ceiling or big, upholstered furniture — or use
double layers of drywall on your walls (creating mass).
 Don’t expect acoustical foam or carpet to reduce the noise. Using these
can help reduce the amount of sound that bounces around inside the
room, but it doesn’t do much to keep sound in (or out of) the room.
 Isolate the instrument instead of the room. Isolating the sound of your
guitar amp can be much less expensive than trying to soundproof your
whole room. Most commercial studios have one or more isolation booths
for recording vocals and other acoustic instruments. You can use that
concept to create your own mini-isolation booths.
One idea for a truly mini-isolation booth is to make an insulated box for your
guitar (or bass) amp. If you just have to crank your amp to get the sound you
want, you can place it inside the insulated box to reduce the amount of noise
that escapes to the outside world. Check out Figure 2-4 to see what I mean.
You can also create an isolated space in a closet by insulating it and closing the
door when you record (I’ve known people who’ve put a window in the door and
used the insulated closet for a vocal booth), or you can put your guitar amp (or
drums) in another room and run a long cord from there to your recorder. If you
do this, remember that for long cord runs you need to use balanced cords
rather than unbalanced ones (see Chapter 5); otherwise, you might get a bunch
of noise, and your signal might be too low to record very well.
Getting the sound in your 
room under control
After you create a room that’s as isolated from the outside world as possible,
you need to deal with the way sound acts within your room.
Sound travels through the air in the form of waves. These waves bounce
around the room and cause reflections (reverberations or echoes). One prob-
lem with most home studios is that they’re small — and sound travels very
fast (1,130 feet per second, to be exact). When you sit at your monitors and
listen, inevitably you hear the reflected sound as well as the original sound
that comes out of your speakers. With big rooms, you can hear the original
sound and reflections as separate sounds, meaning that the reflections them-
selves become less of a problem. For a good home studio, you have to tame
these reflections so they don’t interfere with your ability to clearly hear
what’s coming from the speakers.
42
Part I: Computer Recording Basics 

How all these reflections bounce around your room can get pretty compli-
cated. Read up on acoustics (the way sound behaves) to discover more
about different room modes: axial (one dimension), tangential (two dimen-
sions), and oblique (three dimensions). Each relates to the way sound waves
interact as they bounce around a room. Knowing your room’s modes can
help you come up with an acoustical treatment strategy, but some very com-
plicated formulas exist for figuring out your room’s modes, especially those
dastardly tangential and oblique modes.
You can find out more on room modes and find some room mode calculators
on the Internet by using your favorite search engine and entering room modes
as a search term. Go to the Web site matches, and you’ll see quite a few places
to start looking. (One great resource is Ethan Winer’s forum at www.music
player.com/cgi-bin/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=forum;f=26;DaysPrune=30.)
I recommend that you research room modes; this topic alone could fill an
entire book.

Chapter 2: Setting Up Your Recording Space

So, at the risk of offending the professional acoustical engineers in the world,
I’m going to share some tricks that I’ve been using in my studios. My main
goal has been to create a room with a sound I like and that gives me some
measure of control over the reflections within the room. Because I record and
mix in one room (as do most home recordists), I find it helpful to be able to
make minor adjustments to the sound to accommodate what I’m trying to
accomplish.
Sound control plays a major role in two aspects of recording: tracking and
mixing. Each requires different approaches for you to get the best possible
sound out of your recordings. I cover both these aspects in this section.
Sound control during tracking
Tracking is what you’re doing when you’re actually recording. Two things
can make a tracking room a bad environment for tracking: not enough sound
reflection and too much sound reflection. The goal when tracking is to have
a room that’s not so dead (in terms of sound reflection) that it sucks the life
out of your instrument and not so live that it colors the sound too much. The
determining factor in how much reflection you want in your room is based on
the instrument that you record and the way it sounds in the room.
If your room is too dead (not enough sound reflection), try adding some reflec-
tive surfaces to liven things up (the room, that is). On the other hand, if your
room is too live (too much sound reflection), you need to add some absorptive
materials to tame those reflections.
You could go out and buy a bunch of foam panels to catch the reflections, or
maybe put in a wood floor or attach some paneling to the walls to add some
life, but you’d be stuck with the room sounding only one way. It might end
up sounding good for recording drums or acoustic guitar, but then it would
probably be too live for getting a great vocal sound — which requires a
deader space. One solution that I’ve found to work well is to get (or make)
some portable panels that can either absorb or reflect the sound.
Figure 2-5 shows an absorber/reflector that I’ve used and have found to work
quite well. (Go to my Web site, www.jeffstrong.com, for plans to build your
own.) One side has an absorptive material (dense fiberglass insulation) and
the other a reflective surface (wood). They’re put together in an attractive
frame and designed to stack easily when you want them out of the way. Even
with very little woodworking experience, you can crank out a set of them in a
weekend for very little money (about $30 per panel). I guarantee that if you
make them (or hire someone to make them for you), you’ll find dozens of
uses for them around your studio.
44
Part I: Computer Recording Basics 

Sound control during mixing
Your first step in getting control of the sound of your (probably less-than-
perfect) room during mixing is to get a good pair of near-field monitors. Near-
field monitors are designed to be listened to up close (hence the near in their
name), and they lessen the effects that the rest of the room has on your abil-
ity to hear them accurately and get a good mix.
The next step to mixing in an imperfect room is to mix at low volumes. I
know; that takes the fun out of it, right? Well, as fun as it might be to mix at
high volumes, it rarely translates into a great mix. Great mixing engineers
often listen to their mixer at very low levels. Yes, they occasionally use high
levels, but only after the mixing is pretty much done — and then only for
very short periods of time. After all, if you damage your ears, you blow your
career as a sound engineer. (Hey, that rhymes! Or is there an echo in here?)
I don’t want to sound like your mother, but try to resist the temptation to
crank it up. Your ears last longer, and your mixes sound better.

Chapter 2: Setting Up Your Recording Space

Even with these two things (near-field monitors and low mixing levels), you
still need to do one more thing to your room to make it work better for you.
The secret to a good mixing room is to tame the reflections of the sound
coming out of your speakers.
Dealing with high- and mid-range frequencies is pretty easy — just put up
some foam panels or the absorptive side of the panels you see in Figure 2-5.
(See? I told you that you’d have a use for those panels.) Start by hanging two
from the ceiling (or putting them on a stand or table) so they’re level with
your speakers on the wall behind you. Also put one on each side wall right
where the speakers are pointed, as shown in Figure 2-6. This positioning gets
rid of the higher frequencies and eliminates much of the echo.

You might also need to put something on your ceiling right above your head,
especially if you have a low (8 feet or less) or textured ceiling. (You know, one
with that popcorny stuff sprayed on.) You might not want to mount one of
the absorption panels over your head because they’re fairly heavy. (And acci-
dents do happen.) Try wrapping up a couple of 2-x-4-foot panels made of dense
fiberglass (the same ones used in the absorber/reflectors) in fabric and hang
those instead; they would work just about perfectly. In fact, you can make
some overhead diffusers like the ones shown in Figure 2-7 very easily. (The
plans for these are also on my Web site at www.jeffstrong.com.)
You can also place a set of these overhead panels in the corners of your room
behind the speakers. Just hang them at the same height of your speakers so
that they cut off the corner of the room. If you don’t have enough room to fit
the panels at an angle in the corner, you can eliminate the backing from the
fiberglass and bend the fabric-covered panel to fit right in the corner. Either
approach absorbs any sound that bounces around behind the speakers.

Chapter 2: Setting Up Your Recording Space

Another thing that you need to consider when you’re mixing is standing waves.
Standing waves are created when bass tones begin reflecting around your room
and bounce into each other. Standing waves have a weird effect on mix quality.
They can over-emphasize the bass from your speakers (resulting in mixes that
are short on bass) or cancel out some — or all — of the bass coming out of
your speakers (resulting in mixes with too much bass). One of the problems
with standing waves is that they can really mess up your mixes, and you might
not even be aware that they’re there until you listen to your mix in another
room and the bass is either too loud or too soft.
To find out whether you have a problem with standing waves in your studio,
sit in front of your monitors and put on one of your favorite CDs. Now listen
carefully. Okay, now lean forward and backward a little bit. Does the amount
of bass that you hear change as you move? Next, get up and walk around the
room. Listen for places within the room where the bass seems to be louder
or softer. You might find places where the bass drops out almost completely.
If either inspection gives you a variable experience of the bass, you’re the
proud owner of standing waves. Don’t worry, though. You can tame that
standing-wave monster with a pair of bass traps.
Bass traps absorb the energy in the lower frequencies so they don’t bounce
all over your room and throw off your mixes. You can buy bass traps made
of foam from some music stores or (yep, you guessed it) you can make your
own out of wood and insulation. Check out Figure 2-8 for a look at some
homemade bass traps. (The plans to make these are — you guessed it —
located on my Web site: www.jeffstrong.com.)
The most common placement for bass traps is in the corners behind you
when you’re sitting at your mixer (as in Figure 2-9). You might also find that
putting a set in the other corners of the room helps even more.
After you place the bass traps, do the listening test again. If you notice some
areas where the bass seems to get louder or softer, try moving the bass traps
around a little. With some trial and error, you’ll most likely find a place where
they seem to work best.
Try not to get stressed out about the sound of your room. As important as your
room’s sound is, it has less impact on the quality of your recordings than good,
solid engineering practices. I know, I keep saying this, but it’s important to
remember. So do what you can and then work with what you’ve got.

hances are you already have a computer, and you plan on using it for
recording your music. Before you do that, remember that the computer
you choose to use for recording your music is one of the most important pur-
chases you’ll ever make when it comes to capturing a CD-worthy performance.
Recording, editing, and mixing audio are processor-intensive, and with all the
different types of software and recording hardware available, having the right
computer for your needs is very important.
In this chapter, I guide you through the main considerations you need to
make when purchasing a computer for recording your music. I examine the
core components of both Windows and Mac-based machines and help you
find the best solution for your needs.
An almost infinite variety of computer components are available for each
part of your system. Add to this fact the many options for audio recording
hardware and software, and it becomes nearly impossible for me to tell you
exactly what components will work with the software and hardware you
choose. Given this fact, here are some suggestions:
 If you’re starting from scratch and you’re planning on buying a computer
for running your audio, choose your software first and build the rest of
your system around that choice.
 If you already have a computer that you want to use for recording audio,
check with the different software and audio interface makers to see
whether your current system will work for you. If you discover that your

system isn’t up to par for recording audio, upgrade your system before
you spend your money on the recording gear.
 Visit Web sites for each of the audio recording software makers (Chap-
ter 7 lists many of them) to see what hardware they recommend for their
systems.
 Check one of the many Internet forums out there for recommendations
from people who are using the software or audio interface you want to
use. You can generally find a forum for each of the popular recording
programs on the manufacturer’s Web site or by doing a Web search with
the software name and forum as your keywords.
 Go to the Digidesign User’s Conference (DUC) for help finding the best
hardware and operating system (OS) for your needs. This forum has a
topic dedicated to building a recording PC. Although this particular
forum topic focuses on computers that work with Pro Tools — a
Digidesign product — most of the information provided applies to any
recording system. The topic is located at

Selecting a Windows PC
Getting set up with a PC is a little more complicated than it is with a Mac (see
the “Choosing a Mac” section later in this chapter), simply because you have
to deal with a lot more hardware variables. But as long as you keep the basic
system requirements in mind, you can set yourself up with a very powerful
system. In this section, I offer several options for getting a Windows PC for
recording audio.
Understanding minimum requirements
Windows PC system requirements differ slightly depending on the software
and audio interface that you use. Although every audio recording program
differs in the minimum system requirements, here’s a list that covers the
basic minimums for a system that records both audio and MIDI and offers
typical editing and plug-in capabilities:
 Processor: Most manufacturers recommend a Pentium 4 or AMD Athlon
XP. These are both fine, but I say get the fastest speed you can afford —
a single processor would be good, but a double processor would be
even better.
54
Part II: Choosing and Installing Computer Hardware 

 Operating system: Current audio recording programs require Windows
XP. This is the first really stable OS that Microsoft has made. As far as
I’m concerned, this is a no-brainer — even if your choice of software lets
you use an earlier version.
 RAM: Most manufacturers recommend 384 megabytes (MB) of random
access memory (RAM). That’s is the absolute lowest that I’d get. In fact,
I’d double it if you want a system that doesn’t get slow and glitchy as
you work.
 Hard drives: Get two — one for the system drive and one for your audio
files. I’d recommend 7,200 rpm IDE/ATA drives for at least the audio drive.
You can get by with a slower one (such as 5,400 rpm) for your system
drive if necessary (in the case of the internal drive in a laptop, for
instance).
Note: The rpm doesn’t refer to that prehistoric recording storage device
known as the vinyl LP (331⁄3 rpm) or the single (45 rpm). It refers to the
rotations per minute of the drive mechanism.
 Optical drives: An optical drive is a drive that can read or write from
either CDs or DVDs. (They’re called optical because the data is written
and read by a laser.) My advice to you? Get both a CD-R and a DVD-R
drive. A combination drive is fine. It lets you burn CDs of your finished
music and make DVD backups of your audio data.
Opting on the operating system
For PC users, Windows XP is the way to go. It is by far the most stable operat-
ing system Microsoft has released to date. This difference in stability between
Windows XP and the previous version is significant enough that I believe it’s
worth whatever hassle you need to go through (such as upgrading your PC) to
skip the earlier version of Windows.
Both the Home and Professional versions of Windows XP work just fine. The
main difference between the two is that the Professional version can run
dual-CPU systems. (The central processing unit, or CPU, is the main computer
brain, so essentially it’s a Mutant Computer with Two Brains.) Depending on
the software you use, this feature can offer significant performance improve-
ments over a single processor, or it can make no observable difference at all.
Check with the manufacturer of the recording software you use to find out
whether it supports dual processor computers.
Unless you already own a dual-CPU-equipped computer — or plan to purchase
(or build) one in the not-too-distant future, save yourself a few bucks and go
with the Windows XP Home edition.
55
Chapter 3: Choosing Computer Components

Viewing internal components
When you buy or build a Windows PC for recording, you’d better have a basic
understanding of the main components in your system. These components
include:
 Central processing unit (CPU): The CPU is a small chip that is responsi-
ble for processing all the data in your computer. It’s essentially the com-
puter’s brain. Two major CPU manufacturers exist in the PC world —
Intel and AMD. Most audio hardware and software support both, and
each can work fine as the core of your audio computer. For Intel sys-
tems, I recommend going with a Pentium 4, and for AMD systems, the
Athlon XP. (If you’ve got some bucks to spare, you might even go for two
of your choice and build a dual-processor machine.)
Avoid the lower-cost (and lower-performance) Intel Celeron and AMD
Duron processors.
 Motherboard: The motherboard is the main circuit board in your com-
puter and holds the CPU, memory, and other peripheral cards. The
motherboard you choose depends on whether you’re running the Intel
or AMD CPU (see the preceding bullet). Each CPU type has its own
motherboard requirements, and many choices are available for each,
with new motherboards being released all the time. I’ve had good results
over the years with Asus brand motherboards, although other brands
can also work well.
When you select a motherboard, your main concerns are that it (a) sup-
port the CPU you plan on using and (b) have a chipset (a series of chips
attached to the motherboard that control data flow) that’s compatible
with your desired hardware and software.
 Graphics card: The graphics card is responsible for displaying your soft-
ware’s graphics smoothly. Audio recording programs don’t place the
same demands on your graphics card that modern game software does,
so you don’t need the highest end graphics card for your audio com-
puter. A simple 2X or 4X AGP graphics card will work just fine. Make sure,
however, that the graphics card you use is compatible with your mother-
board. In most cases, the graphics card isn’t going to be an issue — but
check it out anyway as a hedge against Murphy’s Law.
Most audio recording software programs available on the market use
two primary workspace windows. Although it’s easy enough to switch
between the two windows, life can be much easier if you have two moni-
tors so you can see both windows at the same time. Choosing a graphics
card that has dual-monitor support can allow you to do switch between
windows without hassle. I talk a bit more about the two-monitor option
in the “Viewing Video Monitors” section later in this chapter.
56
Part II: Choosing and Installing Computer Hardware 

Making your choice
You can get a Windows computer for recording audio in four ways:
 Use the one you already have. If you already have a computer, this might
be your least expensive solution. Depending on the speed and specific
components in your system, you might be able to buy an audio interface
and a piece of software and get right down to the job of recording . . . or
you might need to do some upgrading before you can record.
 Build it from scratch. This means buying all the parts separately and
putting them all together in a computer case. This option often provides
the most powerful computer for the least amount of money. The down-
side is that you have to find the parts, make sure they’re compatible,
and get your hands dirty. This process isn’t very hard, but it does
require some skill and confidence. If you’re unsure how to build a PC, I
recommend checking out Mark L. Chambers’ Building a PC For Dummies,
4th Edition (Wiley Publishing, Inc.).
If you want to build your own PC from the ground up, I recommend
checking out the Web site for the software you intend to use before you
start buying anything. Most manufacturers offer some guidelines —
some even have specific systems that are approved for use with their
products.
The Digidesign Users Conference (DUC), a user forum for fans of all
things Digidesign (including Pro Tools), has a forum topic that includes a
comprehensive guide to building a PC for the express purpose of audio
recording. Although this information applies specifically to Pro Tools
systems, these recommendations generally work well for all recording
57
Chapter 3: Choosing Computer Components
Mac or PC: Which one is for you?
It used to be that professional recordists used
Macs and only Macs. That isn’t the case any-
more. Professionals use either platform, Mac or
PC (or both, depending on who you talk to). You
can find good software and compatible audio
hardware for both platforms, so your choice is
going to come down to your comfort level and
budget. Don’t let anyone convince you that you
need either a Mac or a Windows PC to record
audio. It’s just not true. Choose the one you’re
familiar with or are drawn to. Unless you have a
strong bias one way or the other, I recommend
that you choose the software first and get the
computer that works well with it. If you do prefer
a Mac or a Windows PC, your choices for soft-
ware are narrowed down, but you still have lots
of good options for both platforms.

systems. If you really want to go the DIY route, I recommend that you
check out this particular forum topic, located at

umber=360675&page=0&view=collapsed&sb=5&o=7&fpart

 Buy an off-the-shelf system. Many computers that are available at your
local computer store can work fine for recording audio. This option rep-
resents the easiest way to get a computer. The downside is that you
often pay for features you don’t need, and the extra features might slow
your system down a bit. This is also generally the most expensive option
for a recording computer.
 Have one built for you. If you don’t have the skills (or stomach) for
building your own computer but you want the most performance out of
a computer, having one built by a company that specializes in audio
computers might be the best solution. This option costs more than
building one yourself, but with it you often get a warranty and are
assured of a system that will work for your needs. Having an audio com-
puter built for you from scratch costs about the same as buying an off-
the-shelf computer of the same overall quality. Here are a couple of
places that build quality audio PCs:
• Alienware: This company builds custom Windows PCs for a vari-
ety of creative pursuits. You can find it at: www.alienware.com/
Product_Pages/workstation_audio.aspx.
• MusicXPC: You can find some Windows PCs built specifically for
audio on its site at: www.musicxpc.com.
• Digital Audio Wave: These guys make some powerful audio com-
puters, too. Check out: www.digitalaudiowave.com.
Choosing a Mac
Choosing a Mac is easy because you don’t have nearly as many options to
consider and you don’t have to worry about the compatibility of the guts of
the computer. The downside is that you’ll likely end up spending a bit more
money compared to building your own Windows PC from scratch. (If you buy
an off-the-shelf PC or have one built for you, the cost is going to be similar to
that of a comparable Mac.)
58
Part II: Choosing and Installing Computer Hardware 

Making sense of minimum requirements
All audio hardware and software manufacturers provide a list of minimum
system requirements. These requirements are vital to installing and using
their products. Here’s an example of the typical current minimum require-
ments that an audio recording software company would require for Macs:
 Processor: Most manufacturers recommend a G4 or G5. For most pro-
grams, you can get by with a G4, but a G5 might open the throttle on
some programs.
 Operating system: You need OS X. The specific version is negotiable
with many manufacturers, but as long as you’re going with OS X, get the
latest version to be safe.
 RAM: The minimum here is the same as for a Windows system — 384
megabytes (MB). That’s is the absolute lowest that you should get.
Instead, shoot for the 1-gigabyte (GB) route if you can swing it.
 Hard drives: As with all audio recording systems you need two — one
for the system drive and one for your audio files. I’d recommend 7,200
rpm IDE/ATA drives for at least the audio drive. You can get by with a
slower one for your system drive if necessary (in the case of the internal
drive in a laptop, for instance).
 Optical drives: Optical drives are drives that can read or write from CDs
or DVDs. If I were you, I’d get both a CD-R and a DVD-R drive. A combina-
tion drive is fine. It lets you burn CDs of your finished music and make
DVD backups of your audio data.
For the most part, the minimum is exactly that: the absolute minimum. Don’t
expect to have a powerhouse system if you settle for just the minimum
requirements. To record more than a few tracks or run more than a couple
instances of plug-ins, you need as much power as you can get. I recommend
that you buy the fastest computer you can afford, especially if you intend to
record your entire band or if you want to use a bunch of soft-synths or plug-
in effects in your music.
Opting on an operating system
Even though many people still get by using OS 9, OS X is the operating system
that you really need to use to get the most out of the newest audio recording
software. All new Macs are being shipped with OS X, and some audio hardware
and software won’t work on OS 9.
59
Chapter 3: Choosing Computer Components

If you have an older computer that runs OS 9 and you can’t upgrade to X,
you’re stuck using an older version of an audio recording program because
the newer versions aren’t being written for OS 9. These options work fine, but
I’ve got to tell you that OS X is a much better operating system than OS 9. In
fact, the improvement from OS 9 to OS X is so dramatic that I’d upgrade my
entire system if I had to rather than deal with the limitations present in OS 9
(but then I’m hardcore).
Understanding Mac configurations
Macs come complete, so it’s much easier to make a decision on which Mac to
buy compared to the many variables you have to contend with when using a
Windows PC. The main consideration that you have to face is what audio inter-
face technology you use. For example, the iMac (and the eMac, Powerbook or
iBook for that matter) doesn’t have a PCI slot, so you can’t use a PCI-based
audio interface with it.
Following is a quick rundown of the basic configurations of the various Apple
offerings and how they work for audio:
 Power Mac: This is the top-of-the-line Apple computer. The Power Mac
is a desktop computer that has several PCI slots, room for four drives,
an option for two processors, and room for tons of RAM. If you have the
means, this is the most powerful solution, and you can expand it as
needed. Another advantage is that you can put the main CPU unit in a
room away from your monitor, which keeps the noise of the computer
out of your recordings.
 iMac: The iMac is available with quite a bit of power (single processor
G5 as of this writing), so it can handle most people’s audio needs. It’s 
relatively inexpensive so it fits the budget for many users. It does have
some disadvantages (aside from the single processor limit). It lacks PCI
slots and doesn’t have any room for internal drives beyond the included
hard drive (fine for your system drive) and optical drive (get one with
both CD-R and DVD-R capabilities). So to use this computer for audio
you need to use either a USB or FireWire interface and you need an
external FireWire drive. You also really should max out the RAM right
away because the machines don’t come with very much. One other dis-
advantage is that the monitor is part of the unit, so your hard drive and
fan noise will be in the same room that you record in. This fact might
present a noise-bleed problem if you record with microphones, espe-
cially when recording quiet instruments.
60
Part II: Choosing and Installing Computer Hardware 

If you get creative, you can get past the noisy-fan-and-hard-drive deficit.
For example, you can use a control surface (a unit that lets you control
your recording software without using the mouse or keyboard) and put
it as far away as possible with a sound-absorbing baffle (a thick blanket
hung on a stand works well) between you and the computer when you
record.
 eMac: The eMac has many of the same characteristics as the iMac
except it’s in a less attractive container. The advantage with the eMac is
that it’s pretty inexpensive and has all the power of the more expensive
iMac. Like with the iMac, if you intend to use an eMac for recording, you
need to max out the RAM, add an external FireWire drive, and use a
FireWire or USB audio interface.
 PowerBook: The PowerBook is Apple’s best laptop computer. As of this
writing, PowerBooks aren’t available with a G5 processor, so the best
you can do is a G4 — which is fast enough for most users, anyway.
Because laptops don’t have a PCI slot or room for any extra hard drives,
you’ll need to get a FireWire-based unit. (You can use a USB audio inter-
face, but I wouldn’t recommend getting a USB drive. They just aren’t fast
enough — even the USB 2 versions.) Also, make sure that you get more
RAM than is standard and get at least a CD-R optical drive, if not a DVD-
R/CD-R combo drive.
 iBook: The iBook is a less expensive laptop that usually is a couple
steps slower in processor speed than the PowerBook. (The G4 iBooks
just became available.) Keep in mind as well that you don’t have as
many ports or RAM capabilities. Still, a G4 iBook can work for many
people. In fact, because the iBook is so quiet, I prefer it over the eMac
or iMac for recording. Sure, you’ll spend a bit more for the iBook than
the eMac or iMac, but you’ll end up with a portable recording studio.
Remember that, with an iBook, you still need to use a USB or FireWire
interface, an external FireWire drive, and maxed-out RAM. You might
also need to get a FireWire optical drive to record your CDs and DVD
backups.
You don’t need the newest, fastest computer ever made to record your
music. Get what you can afford (or use what you have) and get to work.
When you hit the limits of your system, then consider upgrading. As of this
writing, I’m still using a G4 single processor Power Mac and a PowerBook for
all my music. I’m not planning on upgrading the main computer units for a
while yet because I have yet to feel in any real way limited by them. I regu-
larly upgrade the software and operating system, but the hardware waits
until I can’t get what I want to get done with what I’ve got. I usually last about
four to five years between major hardware upgrades. Remember that you still
need to spend good money on things like microphones and preamps, so don’t
blow you whole wad on the latest greatest computer hardware.
61
Chapter 3: Choosing Computer Components

Making your choice
For the most part, any PowerBook, Power Mac G4 with the AGP graphics
card, and of course the Power Mac G5s would do quite nicely. In addition to
these models, an iMac, iBook or eMac could work well, but you’ll need to
check out the compatibility documents for the hardware and recording pro-
gram you intend to use.
The audio interface you have dictates what type of computer you can use.
For example, if you have a Digi 001, you need a computer with an open PCI
slot. This eliminates everything except the G4 or G5 because these are the
only Macs with PCI slots. Come to think of it, with the Digi 001 you have to
take the G5 off the list as well, because it uses a PCI configuration that’s
incompatible with the Digi 001. Other PCI interfaces, such as the RME or
MOTU brands, are compatible with both the G4 and the G5. If you want to use
a FireWire interface, such as the MOTU 828, or a USB interface, such as the
Mackie Spike, you can use any of the Macs because all new Macs have USB
and FireWire ports.
Make sure that you have the necessary connectors (and that they’re compati-
ble) in your computer to run the type of interface you want to use.
Getting a Handle on Hard Drives
To record audio effectively, you need to have more than one hard drive. This
is pretty much non-negotiable if you intend to do any amount of recording,
editing, erasing, and re-recording. You need at a minimum two hard drives in
your system: one for your system files and applications and the other for all
your audio and MIDI files. Here’s a look at how to organize them:
 Drive one: The system drive. For your system drive, you can use the
stock drive that came with your computer — but if you have a choice, I
recommend getting one with a spindle speed (also known as rotational
speed, the speed at which the hard drive spins) of 7,200 revolutions per
minute (rpm). You’ll be much happier, and your audio recording pro-
gram will be much happier, too. And get a big one — hard drive, that is.
There’s no need to partition your drive, even if you have other programs
such as finance or word-processing software on your computer. In fact,
doing so might slow down your system.
 Drive two: The audio drive. Back in the old days, you needed a good
high-speed SCSI drive to record and play back audio reliably, but this
isn’t the case anymore. You can use both IDE and FireWire drives for
storing audio, but make sure that you have a drive with the following (or
better) specs:
62
Part II: Choosing and Installing Computer Hardware 

• Spindle speed: Also called rotational speed, this is the rate at
which the hard drive spins. For the most part, a 7,200-rpm drive
will work well for recording and playing back audio.
• Seek time: This is the amount of time that the drive takes to find
the data that’s stored on it. You want an average seek time under
10 milliseconds (ms). Get as low as you can. (I prefer a seek time of
8 to 9 ms.)
• Buffer size: Often called a cache buffer, buffers are memory units
that store data as it’s being transferred. You want a buffer size of at
least 512K, but get one as big as you can. I recommend a drive with
an 8MB buffer.
• Chipset: If you use a FireWire drive, make sure that it comes with
at least the Oxford 911 bridge chipset. The chipset is necessary to
get the most bandwidth out of the drive and results in more tracks
in your session.
A drive with these specs in a good size (100GB or so) will run you about
$100, so there’s no reason not to spring for the second drive.
If you use a FireWire interface for your system, you’re best off using an ATA/IDE
drive as your audio drive because a FireWire drive will compete with the inter-
face’s FireWire connection for bandwidth. If you want to use a PowerBook or
other Mac that doesn’t have room for a second internal ATA/IDE drive, you
might need to get either a PCI (for desktops) or Cardbus (for laptops) FireWire
adapter. Using an adapter will let you record and play back more tracks and
essentially make your sessions run smoother.
I don’t recommend the older USB drives for your audio drive. The connection
speed is too slow to record or play back lots of tracks smoothly. The newer
USB 2 drives have a connection speed similar to FireWire, so this might be an
option if your computer has a high-speed USB-2 port.
Recognizing Your RAM Needs
Most audio recording programs require at least 384MB of RAM (random
access memory), but I say go for broke here. Get as much RAM as your
system can hold. And don’t buy the cheap stuff — get high-quality RAM.
I recommend getting at least 1GB of RAM for music, more if you want to
use software samplers or soft-synths because they use a lot of RAM to run
efficiently.
63
Chapter 3: Choosing Computer Components

Opting for Optical Drives
An optical drive is a drive that can read from or write to CDs or DVDs. These
types of drives are important for backing up data and burning a CD of your
finished music.
I recommend that you get a combination drive — one that can read and write
from both CDs and DVDs. Even though you won’t be putting your music on
DVD, the capacity of a DVD-ROM disc makes backing up your audio files much
easier because you can get a lot of data on one DVD. (How much data? Well,
you can cram all the data from six CDs onto just one DVD.)
Viewing Video Monitors
When it comes to choosing a monitor, almost any one will do in a pinch, but
I recommend the newer LCD monitors because they don’t emit any electro-
magnetic fields (EMFs) that some recordists have complained interfere with
recording. I personally haven’t had any problems with the audio while using a
standard cathode ray tube (CRT) monitor, but I do find that my eyes get tired
a lot quicker with them than when using an LCD monitor.
One final consideration concerns your choice of graphics cards: You might
want to consider a dual-head AGP (Accelerated Graphics Port or Advanced
Graphics Port) graphics card. These work just like any other graphics card,
but support the use of dual monitors. Because many audio recording pro-
grams use two main display screens, having a dual-display-capable graphics
card allows you to hook up two monitors so that you can see both screens
without having to toggle between them. Okay, it’s certainly not a require-
ment, but many people find that it’s a nice convenience.

B
ecause of all the hoopla that computer-based recording has been getting
in the press over the last couple of years, more people figure that because
they have a computer they might as well use it to record. Unfortunately, many
of these people go to their local musical instrument superstores or favorite
online retailers, buy the cheapest recording doohicky possible (after all, the
specs are all the same, right?), get home, install it, and proceed to spend count-
less hours trying to figure out why they can’t record anything with it or find 
out that what they do manage to record sounds worse than the 20-year-old 
cassette deck they’ve been using to put their musical ideas down on.
Well, this chapter is designed to save you the frustration (and expense) of not
getting the right bits of hardware you need to successfully record with your
computer. In this chapter, I guide you through the overwhelming options in
audio interfaces and help you find the right one for your needs (and not the
seller’s need for a big, fat commission). I also explain the other audio compo-
nents you might want for your home studio, such as MIDI gear, microphones,
and monitors (speakers, to you newbies).
Examining the Audio Interface
The audio interface is the key to being able to record into a computer. The
interface takes all your analog sources (this includes all your instruments
and mics) and turns them into digital bits that your computer can under-
stand and work with. Without the interface, your instruments and computer
are speaking two entirely different languages with no hope of understanding
one another.

Understanding the interface
Audio interfaces come in a variety of configurations that might or might not
contain the following components:
 A sound card: A sound card — also called a PCI card because it fits in
the PCI (Peripheral Component Interface) slot in your computer —
allows your computer to read and understand the digital information
coming from and going to the converters (see next bullet). Without a
sound card, your computer doesn’t know what to do with the musical
data that it receives (or that your hard drive stores).
 Analog-to-digital (AD) and digital-to-analog (DA) converters: These
converters allow you to get the sound from your instrument, direct box,
or preamp to the sound card (the AD converter’s job) and from your
computer back out to your monitors (the DA converter’s job).
The division between sound card and AD and DA converters is very
slight. In fact, these two components are often bundled together and 
collectively called a sound card. However, because you can buy these
components separately — if and when you get really hard core about
recording audio — I list them separately.
 Analog inputs: These let you plug your instruments into the interface
without needing a mixer or any other gear. The analog inputs include:
• Microphone preamps: A microphone preamp is necessary for you
to plug your microphone into your recording device. A preamp
amplifies the signal coming from your microphone so that it can be
recorded. Microphone preamps in most audio interfaces can also
accept your guitar or bass without having to go through your amp
first — much like a direct box would. (For more on direct boxes,
see Chapter 1.)
• Instrument inputs: In addition to microphone preamps, most inter-
faces also have 1⁄4-inch TS or TRS inputs that you can plug your key-
boards, drum machines and other instruments into. (Not sure
about this TS or TRS business? Chapter 5 has more on these and
other types of connectors.) Many interfaces also let you plug your
guitars directly into these inputs as well so you don’t need a direct
box. (Again, Chapter 1 has more on direct boxes.)
 Analog outputs. Audio interfaces all come with at least two analog out-
puts as well as a headphone jack. These outputs let you plug in your
monitors and headphones so that you can hear your recordings. Many
interfaces also have additional outputs that allow you to plug your
unmixed tracks into an external mixer if you choose. (Though most
home recordists don’t bother — they choose to mix inside the com-
puter’s software instead. Chapter 14 covers mixing in more detail.)
66
Part II: Choosing and Installing Computer Hardware 

Even though it’s really handy to have all the pieces of equipment making up
your audio interface housed together in one unit, there’s a downside — such
all-in-one audio interfaces aren’t going to perform as well as higher quality
components that you can buy separately. For example, the preamps that
come in most interfaces might be serviceable, but they don’t offer the clarity
that a well-made external preamp can.
Quality is the price you pay for having everything in one unit and having that
unit cost less than the individual components would cost separately. The
reason I mention this is that, as you build up your engineering skills, you
might find that you hit the limits of your equipment. When this happens, you
might want to consider adding separate components to improve the quality
of your audio chain. (The chain is the line of gear that your signal has to travel
to get to the hard drive — your voice to the mic to the preamp to the AD con-
verter to the sound card to the hard drive, for example.)
Exploring digital audio specifications
When you start looking at audio interfaces, you’ll notice all the specifications
thrown around like beaded necklaces at a Mardi Gras celebration. To keep you
from getting confused by all the hype produced by the companies trying to
sell their particular interface, here’s a quick description of the two specs — bit
depth and sample rate — that you need to get your mind around if you want
to intelligently compare competing products.
Bit depth
When you start looking at audio interfaces, you’ll hear jargon such as 16-bit
(the bit depth of audio CDs), 20-bit, 24-bit, and so forth. This is the bit depth,
which is described in terms of bits. (A bit, short for BInary digiT, is the basic
unit of information in the binary numbering system used by computers.) The
numbers 16, 20, and 24 relate to the amount of digital information that can be
contained in each of the sample rates that I describe in the next section. The
higher the number, the more dynamic range — the difference between the
loudest and softest sound you want to record and the level of noise in your
recording — you can have. Most professional audio gear now records at a 
24-bit resolution, which translates to 144dB of dynamic range. (Theoretically,
at any rate. In the real world, this dynamic range is slightly lower, ranging
around 112dB or even 106dB). With that higher number, however, the sound
is going to take up more of your digital storage space. This usually isn’t a big
deal, though, considering the low cost of huge hard drives.
67
Chapter 4: Examining Audio Components

Sampling rate
The sampling rate refers to the frequency at which the converter samples the
incoming and outgoing sound source. When a converter samples a sound, it
actually takes a small snapshot of the audio signal. Typical sample rates for
digital recorders are 44.1 kHz (the sample rate for audio CDs), 48 kHz, 88.2
kHz, and 96 kHz (the sampling rate for DVD audio). The higher the number,
the more samples that are taken each second, and the larger the frequency
range that’s captured.
This is one of the key aspects of using higher sampling rates and is called
the Nyquist frequency. The Nyquist frequency (named after Harry Nyquist, the
guy who discovered this) is the highest frequency that a digital sample can
represent — and that frequency works out to be exactly half the sample rate.
For instance, a 48-kHz sampling rate (the most common rate for professional
audio equipment at the time of this writing) can accurately represent fre-
quencies up to 24 kHz. (Not bad, considering that humans can only hear a
maximum of 20 kHz — and for musicians who’ve played in a loud band for a
while, that figure might be as low as 17 kHz.) Any frequencies higher than 24
kHz just aren’t audible to us, so they’re cut off. This range of frequencies is
called the bandwidth — 48-kHz sampling rate has a bandwidth of 24 kHz.
If this were the only issue, your sampling rate choice would be a no-brainer:
Simply use 44.1-kHz sample rate for audio that you’ll eventually put on a CD
because CDs use a 44.1-kHz sample rate and humans can’t hear beyond about
20 kHz anyway. Unfortunately, the real issue with the sample rate has to do
with the way the converter filters the audio above the Nyquist frequency.
Cheap converters don’t have great filters, so the audible sound (the stuff below
20 kHz) can be distorted by the filter even though the converter can capture
music beyond what you can hear. For some people, the workaround for this
problem is to record at a higher rate, thus putting the filter higher up into the
inaudible range where it can’t mess with your audible music, and then convert-
ing the sample rate later on before you put your music on a CD. And if you do a
lot of DSP (digital signal processing, as I describe in Chapter 1), having a higher
sample rate can help reduce any degradation in the sound of your music from
all the math your computer has to do to process the audio. (Math is inherently
hard work — remember Algebra in high school? — but the math that your com-
puter has to do during audio processing is especially a bear because it often
has to deal with very small errors [called rounding errors] that can eventually
add up.) One other advantage with higher sample rates is that the latency —
the delay caused by digital conversion of DSP functions — is reduced as the
sample rate increases.
To take your analog sound — the signal from your mics, guitars, or 
keyboards — and turn it into digital information, your AD converter takes
small snapshots of the incoming signal (at whatever sampling rate the 
converter uses) and then applies a number to that sample (based on the
bit depth).
68
Part II: Choosing and Installing Computer Hardware 

For example, suppose that you have a 24-bit converter with a 48-kHz sam-
pling rate. When it senses an auditory signal — a vocal perhaps — the AD
converter takes a snapshot (measurement) of that signal 48,000 times per
second (48 kHz). Each of these snapshots is given a value between –8,395,008
and +8,395,008 (a 24-bit resolution has 16,790,016 possible levels), which 
puts the vocal sound somewhere on a chart corresponding to a waveform
shape. The recorder in turn reads these numbers, and the DA converter
translates these numbers back into an analog waveform again (whew!).
Converting an analog signal into digital data and back again is a highly tech-
nical process. You could spend months or even years reading about the intri-
cacies of audio conversion. (Check out Principles of Digital Audio by Ken C.
Pohlmann, or The Art of Digital Audio by John Watkinson if you’re into this
techy stuff.) The most important thing to remember when considering AD
and DA converters is how well you like the sound. Even though the digital
information might be treated the same way in different converters, the sound
might be different for reasons beyond the scope of this book.
Taking a look at interface types
You can get an interface to connect with your computer by using one of
three basic interfaces: PCI, FireWire, or USB. Although I cover these types
in Chapter 1, here’s a rundown on the differences between the three:
 PCI: PCI interfaces are inserted into one of the PCI slots located inside
your computer’s case.
 FireWire: FireWire interfaces connect to one of the FireWire ports in
your computer.
 USB: USB interfaces connect to your computer — you guessed it —
through one of the USB ports in your computer.
PCI interfaces
PCI is the old standard for getting audio in and out of a computer and has an
advantage over the other interface types because of the fast transfer speed
of PCI technology. This type of interface isn’t without its problems, however.
First, many computers don’t have a PCI slot (laptops, for example, and all
Macs except the Power Mac) and second, because PCI technology is changing
not all cards fit in all computers. This can make finding the right PCI interface
more challenging. (Though finding it certainly isn’t impossible — besides, I
help you out later in this chapter.)
69
Chapter 4: Examining Audio Components

The advantage with PCI interfaces is that the PCI (the river in which the data
flows) is the fastest of the currently available ways to get audio into and out of
your computer. This means that there is less delay (called latency) between
the origin of the sound (when you hit a drum, for example) and when it gets
into the computer and then back out again to your monitors. This is why
many pros still prefer PCI to FireWire or USB.
This doesn’t mean that the delay you can get with FireWire or USB has to be
noticeable or can’t be dealt with. You can in fact deal with it in a number of
ways, as you find out in FireWire and USB sections later in this chapter. The
latency issue, therefore, isn’t the reason to go with PCI. Your decision is going
to come down to what interface you find that you like.
PCI interfaces come in the following varieties:
 Separate sound card with no analog inputs and outputs: In this case, you
need to buy separate preamps, direct boxes, and AD and DA converters.
For most home recordists, the separate sound card route isn’t the best
solution. In fact, even for the pros this isn’t the most popular choice —
so much so that this option is quickly falling from the marketplace.
(See Figure 4-1.)
Figure 4-1:

cards, such
as the RME

inputs and

70
Part II: Choosing and Installing Computer Hardware 

 Analog inputs and outputs within the card: It used to be the case that
having the analog connection located in the card caused interference
with the other components in the computer’s housing (such as fans
and hard drives) which caused low-level hums in the recorded audio.
(Not a sound you’d want, I can assure you.) This generally isn’t the
case anymore unless it’s a really inexpensive card, but the bad rep led
buyers to shy away from this approach, and it has become uncommon
as a result. You can find some less expensive audio interfaces configured
this way, but the higher end of the market has pretty much abandoned
it. (See Figure 4-2.)
 Analog inputs and outputs housed in a separate box, called a break-
out box: Because of the low-level hum problems in the early interfaces
(see the preceding bullet point), most manufacturers of PCI-based audio
interfaces put their analog circuitry in a separate box with a cord attached
to the PCI card. One advantage to this — besides eliminating the hum in
early models — is that you can tweak the input and output levels without
having to go into a software menu. The dials for the levels are placed on
the break-out box within easy reach. (See Figure 4-3.)

Chapter 4: Examining Audio Components

If you have a laptop and can’t go with a PCI-based system and you want the
high transfer speed of PCI, some makers of audio interfaces have a card that
uses the PCMCIA card-slot. Of course, this works only if you have a laptop
equipped with a PCMCIA jack.
If you want to go the PCI route, make sure that your computer has PCI slots
that are compatible with the PCI interface that you’re considering because
not all computers have such slots. For example, the Digidesign 001 doesn’t
work with the PCI slots that you find in the Mac G5 computers.
Quite a few PCI-based audio interfaces are available on the market, and they
range from just a couple hundred dollars up to a couple thousand.
FireWire interfaces
FireWire interfaces connect to the FireWire port in your computer. (Figure 4-4
shows a typical FireWire interface.) FireWire ports are inexpensive and avail-
able on laptop computers as well as desktops, which makes FireWire interfaces
more versatile than PCI-based systems. For example, you can move the inter-
face from computer to computer easily. If you have a laptop and a desktop
computer, using a FireWire interface allows you to switch between the two
computers by simply moving the FireWire cable from one to the other. If you
want to do some location recording, this is a big plus because you can take
your interface and laptop to a great recording room, record the drums or what-
ever, and then bring it all back home for mixing and editing in your studio.
Even though PCI-based systems have a faster pathway for sending and receiv-
ing audio data, FireWire is fast enough for most users. With FireWire, the
latency that you can expect — the delay between the origin of the sound and
when it gets into the computer and then back out again to your monitors —
is only marginally more than what you’d get with PCI-based systems.

Part II: Choosing and Installing Computer Hardware 

FireWire interfaces generally come with 8 to 10 inputs and outputs and run
from around $500 to $1,500.
The only thing to be aware of when using a FireWire interface — and you
want a lot of inputs and/or outputs — is the potential problem that might
arise if you also have a FireWire hard drive that you want to record audio to.
Basically, having the FireWire interface and the Fire Wire hard drive on the
same FireWire bus is asking for trouble because you’re sure to hit the limits
of the speed of FireWire data transfer. So make sure that the two FireWire
devices are on different busses (data channels).
USB interfaces
USB interfaces (see Figure 4-5) are handy because most computers have at
least one USB port, so finding a place to plug one in is easy. They also repre-
sent a low-cost solution for people needing only a couple inputs and outputs.
The only problem with USB for recording audio is the relatively slow transfer
speed. This slower transfer speed translates into latencies higher than either
FireWire or PCI-based interfaces. The latency is significant enough that you’re
very likely to hear it when you record.
To get around this deficit, most makers of USB interfaces have incorporated
some sort of “no latency monitoring” option. With such an option, you can
record without hearing a delay between the tracks that you’ve already
recorded and the one you’re currently recording. The problem here is that,
with such an option, your newly recorded track gets placed out of synch with
the previously recorded tracks. Correcting the synchronization requires you to
move your overdubbed tracks within your song file. Admittedly, this process
is pretty easy, but it does take time. (I explain how to do this in detail in
Chapter 11.) If you don’t want the hassle of messing with the latency in USB
interface-based systems, your best bet is to go either the PCI, FireWire, or (see
the next paragraph, please) the soon-to-be-readily-available USB2 route.

Chapter 4: Examining Audio Components

USB2 interfaces, at the time of this writing, are just becoming available. USB2
has a much higher transfer speed, so the latency issue is, well, a non-issue.
As more options appear, you might find that USB2 is the way you want to go.
USB interfaces can be found for under $200, and USB2 interfaces (well, the
only one currently available) run about $700.
Controller-based interfaces
Both FireWire and USB interfaces are offered with additional functionality
in the form of controllers. These can be keyboard controllers or mixer 
controllers.
A keyboard controller interface is usually USB-connected and has a couple
octaves of keyboard keys as well as two inputs (with preamps) and two out-
puts. This can be a handy solution if you intend to do a lot of recording with
software-based keyboard sounds (called soft-synths — Chapter 13 has more
on this) because this type of controller doesn’t actually contain any keyboard
sounds — the keyboard simply triggers the MIDI sequencer within your
recording program. Figure 4-6 shows this type of controller.

Mixer controllers, like the one shown in Figure 4-7, contain multiple audio
inputs and outputs along with typical mixer functions — track faders and
transport functions, to name just two — that give you the feel of an analog
mixer while at the same time allowing you to use your audio recording soft-
ware program to control the mixer parameters.

Chapter 4: Examining Audio Components

Finding the right interface for you
Over a hundred different audio interfaces are available on the market, with new
ones coming out almost daily. As you can imagine, having so many choices out
there can make deciding on the perfect one for your studio rather difficult. This
section offers some insights based on your needs, the available options, and
my ideas about what’s important.
Exploring your needs
To help you get clear on your needs and desires — well, at least your audio
interface needs and desires — here are some things to consider:
 Budget: For most people, cost is the primary consideration when look-
ing for a computer interface. Just remember that, when you tote up the
price for your new interface, you need to figure in the additional cost of
a decent audio recording program. Many people think that the free pro-
gram that comes with many interfaces is going to be adequate for their
needs — and it usually doesn’t take long for them to be proven wrong.
Most interfaces (aside from the Digidesign ones) come with a basic,
entry-level program that you’ll likely outgrow very quickly.
 Musical style: The style of music that you want to record can have an
impact on the type of interface that you can use. For example, if you’re
in a rock band and see yourself recording live — just so you can get the
feel of the music to come through in all its in-your-faceness — you might
need a lot of inputs and outputs. This pretty much necessitates a PCI or
FireWire interface with at least eight analog inputs. On the other hand, if
you’re into electronic music, a USB keyboard controller interface might
be the best solution.
 The computer: Your choice of computer will play a role in your final
decision on an interface. For example, if you have a laptop, you won’t be
able to go the PCI route, and if you have an older computer without a
FireWire port, you obviously can’t go that route unless you put one in
your computer. In this case, you can use a USB interface, assuming that
you have USB ports in your computer or you use one of the very few
PCMCIA cards if your laptop has one of these connectors.
 Audio and MIDI capabilities: Your decision on whether or not you want
to do any MIDI recording is going to determine what type of gear you
need. Many interfaces come with a single MIDI port. For some people, a
single port is just fine, but if you intend to do a lot of MIDIing, you might
need more than that. In this case you’ll need to budget in a separate
MIDI interface.
76
Part II: Choosing and Installing Computer Hardware 

Examining some options
The following list clues you in on some of the major manufacturers of audio
interfaces, and it highlights the flagship products in their lines:
 Aardvark: (www.aardvarkaudio.com) Aardvark makes several different
audio interfaces, most of which are PCI-based. (Okay, they do have one
USB interface.) All their interfaces come bundled with the Cubase LE
audio recording software program and cost from about $300 to over
$1,000. (Cubase LE is the entry-level version of Cubase. Check out
Chapter 7 for more information about Cubase software.)
 Digidesign: (www.digidesign.com) Digidesign is the maker of Pro Tools
software. (See Chapter 6 for more on Pro Tools.) Currently, Digidesign
makes two FireWire interfaces (the Digi 002 and Digi 002 Rack) and one
USB interface (the Mbox). The Digi 002 interface is also a mixer con-
troller. All these interfaces come bundled with Pro Tools LE software
(the entry-level version of Pro Tools), and individually they range in
price from about $500 to $2,400.
 ECHO: (www.echoaudio.com) ECHO makes PCI-based interfaces as well
as PCMCIA interface cards for laptop computers. Their prices range from
under $200 for a PCMCIA 2 input/2 output card to almost $1,000 for an
8 input/8 output system. ECHO interfaces come bundled with Tracktion
software.
 Edirol: (www.edirol.com/products/audio.html) Edirol makes several
interfaces, including USB versions, FireWire versions, and the only USB2
interface on the market. Edirol also has some interfaces with effects units
built inside them and a keyboard controller interface. As of this writing,
Edirol products don’t come with any bundled software and run from
about $300 to $1,000.
 E-Mu: (www.emu.com) E-Mu makes a number of PCI-based interfaces, some
with analog inputs and outputs in the card itself and others with a sepa-
rate break-out box for the analog components. A FireWire port is also
included with the highest-end model (the 1820M) that lets you plug in a
peripheral such as a hard drive. Prices range from under $200 to $600,
depending on the number of inputs and outputs you want. Recording soft-
ware isn’t included, but E-Mu includes effects processors that don’t rely
on the processor power of your computer — the effects use a DSP card in
the 1820 model instead.
 Lynx Studio Technology: (www.lynxstudio.com) Lynx Studio
Technology makes high-end PCI cards. These cards consist of 2, 4, or 6
analog inputs and outputs and no preamps. The lack of preamps isn’t a
problem for most of their users because the kind of folks interested in
such high-end cards usually want to use their own converters and
analog components (preamps, compressors, and so on) and therefore
77
Chapter 4: Examining Audio Components

get these cards to act as the sound card only. All but one of its cards has
two digital inputs and outputs. Prices range from around $500 to well
over $1,000 depending on your input and output needs. These cards
don’t come with any software.
 M-Audio: (www.m-audio.com) M-Audio makes quite a few interfaces,
including PCI, FireWire, USB, and keyboard controller options. Prices
range from under $200 to around $600. The M-Audio interfaces come
bundled with some software — usually Abelton Live Delta, Reason
Adapted, and/or others. Check with your dealer to see which software
is being offered.
 MOTU (Mark of the Unicorn): (www.motu.com) MOTU makes both PCI
and FireWire interfaces. MOTU is at the higher-end of the complete inter-
face spectrum, which gets reflected in its cost — from about $750 to
around $1,800, depending on the number of inputs, outputs, and preamps
you want. MOTU interfaces come bundled with the Audio Desk software
program, which can be upgraded to Digital Performer for a couple hun-
dred dollars. (Chapter 7 has more on these software programs).
 RME: (www.rme-audio.com) RME originally made only high-end PCI
sound cards that use just digital inputs and outputs. Lately, it has
included analog inputs and outputs in some of its products and has
added both a PCMCIA card for laptops and a FireWire interface to its
line. Prices range from under $300 for the PCMCIA card to over $1,000
for a PCI-based interface with analog input and outputs. RME products
don’t come with any recording software.
 TASCAM: (www.tascam.com) TASCAM makes several USB and FireWire
interfaces — and many with a mixer controller included. Prices range
from about $200 for a simple 2-channel USB interface to around $1,300
for a mixer controller FireWire unit. TASCAM units come with an entry-
level version of the Cubasis recording software.
Making your choice
Choosing between all the options out there can be difficult. My advice is
pretty simple: Choose the software and get hardware that works with it. The
software is where you’re going to do your work. The interface is just the way
to get the sound to and from the software. If you choose the best software for
your long-term needs, you can update and upgrade your hardware as your
budget and experience allow.
Check out how your initial decision about what software to use can help you
focus on the right interface for you. If you want to work with Pro Tools soft-
ware, for example, you need to use Digidesign hardware, so right there you’ve
narrowed down the wide world of interface choices to just three models.
(Okay, okay, this probably isn’t that fair an example because most software
is much more forgiving when it comes to the hardware you can use, but it
78
Part II: Choosing and Installing Computer Hardware 

makes a dramatic point, so I use it anyway.) Now if your budget is tight or
you need only two inputs at a time, your three choices have suddenly
become just one — an Mbox from Digidesign will get you going just fine.
Here’s the beauty of it: As your needs grow — say that you decide that you
want to record your whole band and need eight inputs — all you have to do
is upgrade your hardware to a Digi 002 or Digi 002 Rack. By choosing an inter-
face based on the software, your transition from the two-input USB interface
to the eight-input (analog) FireWire interface is as simple as unplugging the
Mbox and plugging in the Digi 002 (or Digi 002 Rack). All your existing songs
are still accessible to you, and you don’t have to learn new software.
On the other hand, if you choose an interface based solely on the hardware
features — on the specs, how cool it looks, or what it costs — you might find
that the software you want to run doesn’t work so well with the interface you
bought (or doesn’t work at all in the case of Pro Tools). And, as I discuss in
Chapter 7, not all software or hardware works well on both computer plat-
forms (Mac and Windows).
Choose the software first. This will dictate, depending on your choice, which
computer platform you’ll use and will steer you in a direction for an audio
interface. The maker of the software lists the types of computers and hard-
ware that will work with its program. Check out the manufacturer’s Web site
to help you narrow down your choices.
Also, in most cases, the software that’s bundled with the audio interface is
worth precisely what you paid for it — nothing, or at least close to it. If you
plan on recording for months or years to come, you’ll find that most of these
bundled programs are severely limited, and you’ll outgrow them about as fast
as you get comfortable using them.
I don’t mean to sound negative, but in my experience with helping people set
up their studios, I’ve seen too many people end up spending a lot of time fig-
uring out the free software only to have to start over again with a new pro-
gram. I suggest that you spend some time going through Chapters 6 and 7
and researching the best software for your needs before you choose the hard-
ware to run it. (This includes computers as well as audio components.)
Making Use of MIDI
Many people who want to record on a computer end up recording MIDI as
well as audio. MIDI stands for Musical Instrument Digital Interface and is a
way for you to control one MIDI-equipped instrument from another or from a
79
Chapter 4: Examining Audio Components

computer that has MIDI sequencing software. (See Chapter 6.) This lets you
record your musical ideas into your computer and edit the data later on. This
can be an advantage when the time comes to edit out any performance mis-
takes you might have committed. Because a MIDI recording is simply perfor-
mance information — no sound is contained in the files — you can edit any
clonkers pretty easily. For example, say you play your part with incredible
feeling but you missed a couple notes here and there. With a MIDI recording,
you can simply change those incorrect notes into the right ones by dragging
them with your mouse. (See Chapter 11 for more details.) If this happens with
an audio file, you have to re-record the botched notes by using a punching
process, a procedure that I talk about in more detail in Chapter 10. This
process takes more time and is more work than fixing a bad MIDI note.
Understanding MIDI
MIDI is a protocol (a set of agreed-upon standards) for issuing commands to
MIDI-equipped devices (such as your keyboards and your computer) through a
cabled connection and a common digital language. This arrangement allows
each MIDI device to understand the other, regardless of manufacturer or instru-
ment. All that’s required is an instrument equipped with MIDI ports (jacks).
MIDI data is different from an audio recording because it contains no sound
as such; rather, it’s limited to performance information. This can be informa-
tion about various performance characteristics, which (for keyboards, at
least) includes the following:
 Note-on and note-off: What note is played and when.
 Velocity: How hard someone presses a key.
 After-touch: Whether the key pressure changes after the initial press.
 Vibrato and pitch bend: Whether the pitch changes while a key is
pressed.
This information allows the MIDI musician to potentially create a perfor-
mance that is as rich in texture as those of the world’s finest players.
Digital messages sent from one device to another across a cable (called the
MIDI cable, of course) create MIDI data. The cable connects to MIDI ports on
each device, and the messages are sent in the form of binary digits. Each
instrument can understand and respond to these messages.
80
Part II: Choosing and Installing Computer Hardware 

Gearing up
Okay, so this MIDI thing sounds kind of interesting to you, and you want to
know just what you’re going to need to buy to do some MIDIing yourself.
Because you’re going to use a computer to record, this can be pretty simple.
Here’s a list of the basics for a computer-based system:
 A sound generator: This device has locked within it all the wonderful
sounds that you want to use to create beautiful music together; it can be
a synthesizer, drum machine, sound module, software synthesizer, sam-
pler, or any other MIDI-equipped sound-making device.
 A MIDI interface: You use a MIDI interface to enable your computer to
send and receive MIDI data to external MIDI instruments. A number of
audio interfaces contain MIDI ports (jacks for connecting MIDI cables;
see Chapter 5), but you’ll come across some that don’t. If the interface
has one, it’ll generally contain just one input and output. For many
people this is enough to get the job done, but for people who want to do
a lot of MIDI work, you might need to get a dedicated MIDI interface.
 A MIDI controller: This is the device you use to control the sound gen-
erator (“playing” it, essentially) as part of recording your MIDI perfor-
mance data. This can be a synthesizer, any MIDI-capable keyboard, or
one of a number of controllers created specifically to control the soft-
synths in your computer.
 A sequencer: This device records and plays the MIDI performances that
are programmed into it. The sequencer allows you to program your part
into the synthesizer and have it play back automatically (much like the
old-time player piano). The sequencer will be part of your audio/MIDI
recording software. Check out Chapters 6 and 7 for suggestions on find-
ing the right software for your needs.
In the following sections, I detail each of these basic components so that
you have a better sense of what features to look for when you do your MIDI
shopping.
Sound generators
The sound generator is the core of the MIDI studio. This is what produces the
sounds that you hear. Without it, you might as well skip the rest of the stuff
because, of course, you won’t hear any of your work.
Sound generators can come in many different shapes and sizes: software 
synthesizers (soft-synths), the fully functional keyboard synthesizer, the inde-
pendent drum machine, the standalone sound module, and samplers. Each of
these devices has its strengths and weaknesses. (Continue on for the details.)
81
Chapter 4: Examining Audio Components

Soft-synths
If you’ve chosen a computer-based system to run your home studio on, your
DAW (digital audio workstation) software enables you to produce great sounds
by using soft-synth plug-ins. Soft-synths are basically software equivalents of
standalone synthesizers, sound modules, or samplers. As you can see in Fig-
ure 4-8, a soft-synth’s GUI — its graphical user interface, the smiling face that
the software shows to the world — is often designed to look just like a piece of
regular hardware, complete with virtual buttons and knobs.
As in all things, soft-synths have their advantages and disadvantages:
 Advantages: Soft-synths cost less than standalone units because no
hardware is involved. In addition, changing sounds or even synthesizer
types is quick and easy from within your recording program. Chapters 6
and 7 spell this out in greater detail.
 Disadvantages: Unlike regular synthesizers, soft-synths use up proces-
sor power. This can slow down your computer system and prevent you
from recording as many audio tracks or applying as many effect patches
as you’d like. The way around this is to get an extra hard drive to house
all your soft-synth sounds. This keeps them separate from your audio
files and often results in you being able to have more playback tracks.
(I say often because there are a lot variables that come into play here.
For the complete scoop on processor demand, see Chapter 3.)
If you don’t already own a bunch of synthesizers, I recommend going the soft-
synth route. The advantages far outweigh the disadvantages, and the number
of options with truly astounding sound is simply staggering (say that fast ten
times).

based DAW

82
Part II: Choosing and Installing Computer Hardware 

Synthesizer
A synthesizer, like the one shown in Figure 4-9, consists of sounds as well as a
keyboard for playing those sounds. Synthesizers come in a variety of sizes and
configurations. For example, some keyboards come with 61 keys (5 octaves),
and others provide as many 88 keys — the same number of keys that you find
on an acoustic piano keyboard.
If you’re in the market for a synthesizer, you need to consider several things:
 Polyphony: Polyphony is the number of notes that sound at one time.
Most decent synthesizers nowadays have at least 16 notes of polyphony,
although models that can produce 32 notes at once are not uncommon.
Each manufacturer treats polyphony differently, and the GM standards
allow some variations on the effective use of this parameter. (GM stands
for General MIDI — a set of sounds common to all MIDI instruments.
These sounds let you play a recorded performance on any device and
hear the sounds that the composer intended for the piece.) For instance,
a synth patch (sound) might use more than one digital sound to create
the actual sound you hear. The synth patch that you love so much might,
in fact, consist of four different sounds layered on top of one another. In
such a case, you just reduced your polyphony by 3⁄4, just by using that one
patch. If your synthesizer has 16-note polyphony, it’s now down to 4-note
polyphony because each of those 4 notes has 4 “sounds” associated with
it. If you use this patch, you can play only 4 notes (a simple chord) at a
time, not the 16 that you thought you had to work with.
Your best bet is to buy a synthesizer (or sound module) with the highest
polyphony you can get (32 notes would be nice), especially if you want
to layer one sound on top of another or do multitimbral parts (see next
bullet) with your synth.
Figure 4-9:

synthesizer

83
Chapter 4: Examining Audio Components

 Multitimbrality: Most decent keyboards allow you to play more than one
sound patch at a time. This is called multitimbrality, which basically allows
you to have your keyboard divided up into several groups of sounds. For
example, a multitimbral synth can divide a song’s chords, melody, bass
part, and drum-set sounds into different groups of sounds — and then
play all those groups at once.
If you do any sequencing (recording or playing back MIDI data), a multi-
timbral synth is a must-have. Otherwise, you would need a separate syn-
thesizer for each type of sound that you want to play. Fortunately, with
the GM standards, compatible synthesizers made in the last ten years
have the ability to play at least 16 sounds at once.
 Keyboard feel: Some keyboards have weighted keys and feel like real
pianos, but other keyboards have a somewhat spongy action. If you’re a
trained piano player, a spongy keyboard might feel strange to you. On
the other hand, if you have no piano training and don’t need weighted
keys, you don’t necessarily have to pay the extra money for that feature.
 Sound quality: This is a subjective thing. Choose the synthesizer that
has the sounds you think you’ll use. I know this seems kind of obvious,
but it means that you should buy the synthesizer whose sounds you
actually like — even if this means waiting and saving up some more
money before you can buy. If you buy a synth based solely on the belief
that it was a good deal but don’t love the sounds, you’ve wasted your
money because you’ll just end up buying the more expensive one later
anyway.
 Built-in sequencer: Many keyboards contain a built-in sequencer, which
will allow you to program and play back your performance. Units like
these are usually called keyboard workstations or MIDI workstations
because they contain everything you need to create a song. If you’re
considering one of these complete workstations, take a good, hard look
at the sequencer and the user interface — make sure that you like the
way these features work for you. Each manufacturer treats the process
of sequencing a little differently; you can probably find one that fits your
style of working.
Drum machine
A drum machine contains not only the sounds of the drum set and other
more exotic drums, but also a sequencer to allow you to program rhythms.
Figure 4-10 shows you what a typical drum machine looks like.
Most drum machines contain hundreds of drum sounds, numerous preset
rhythm patches, and the ability to program dozens of songs. In addition, all
standalone drum machines have pads on which you can play the part. The
more advanced drum machines can give your rhythms a more human feel.
Effects, such as reverb and delay, are also fairly common on the more
advanced drum machines.
84
Part II: Choosing and Installing Computer Hardware 

Sound module
A sound module is basically a stripped-down version of a synthesizer or drum
machine. Sound modules don’t contain triggering devices (such as the keys
for the keyboard, hex pickups for the guitar, or pads for the drum machine).
What they do contain are a variety of sounds (often hundreds) that a master
controller or sequencer can trigger. The advantage to sound modules is that
they take up little space and cost considerably less than their fully endowed
counterparts (the synths and drum machines, that is).
If you already have a master keyboard, you might find that adding sound
modules is a cost- and space-effective way to add more sounds to your
system.
Samplers
A sampler is a sound module that contains short audio samples of real instru-
ments. Most samplers come with sound libraries containing hundreds of dif-
ferent types of sounds, from acoustic pianos to snare drums to sound effects.
These sounds are often much more realistic than those that come in some
synthesizers.

Chapter 4: Examining Audio Components

The real purpose of a sampler is to allow you to record your own sounds. For
example, in the ’80s, it was cool to make a drum set out of unusual percussive
sounds. A snare drum could be the sound of a flushing toilet (don’t laugh, I
actually did this) or breaking glass. Tom-toms could be vocal grunts assigned
to certain pitches. You’d be amazed at the strange stuff that people have
turned into music — all with the help of a sampler.
Another common use of a sampler involves recording short sections of already
recorded songs. This can be a melodic or rhythmic phrase, a vocal cue, or a
single drum or synth sound. Sampling other songs is common in electronic
music, rap, and hip-hop. (Be careful of copyright issues before doing this, how-
ever.) If you’re into electronic music or hip-hop, you might find a sampler a nec-
essary addition to your studio.
MIDI interface
The MIDI interface allows you to send and receive MIDI information from a
computer. Many audio interfaces come standard with a MIDI port, but if you
end up doing a lot of MIDI sequencing and use more than one sound module
or external controller — or if you lucked out and your audio interface doesn’t
have a single MIDI port — you need a separate MIDI interface, such as the
one shown in Figure 4-11.
MIDI interfaces come in a staggering variety of configurations, so you need to
consider several things when you buy a MIDI interface. The following ques-
tions can help you to determine your needs:
 What type of computer do you own? MIDI interfaces are configured to
connect to a serial, parallel, or USB port. You determine which one to
use by the type of port(s) you have in your computer. For example, new
Macs have only a USB port (although you can add a serial port if you
remove the internal modem). A PC has either a parallel port or a USB
port (sometimes both). PCs also have a joystick port that accepts a spe-
cial MIDI joystick cable (no MIDI interface is needed).
 How many instruments do you intend to connect? MIDI interfaces come
with a variety of input and output configurations. Models can come with
two, four, or even eight ins and outs. There are also thru boxes that have
one or more inputs and several outputs. If you have only one or two
instruments, you can get by with a smaller interface. (In this case, a 2 x 2
interface — two ins and outs — would work great.) If you have many
instruments that you want to connect, you need a larger box.
If you use a keyboard controller such as the M-Audio Oxygen8 shown in
Figure 4-12, you don’t need a separate MIDI interface because it has one
of its own. This type of device connects to your computer’s USB port
instead of through a MIDI port. This keeps you from having to get a MIDI
interface in addition to the keyboard controller. Many controller options
use this USB connection.

Chapter 4: Examining Audio Components

MIDI controller
A MIDI controller is essentially what its name describes — it’s a device that
can control another MIDI device. MIDI controllers come in many different for-
mats. In fact, a MIDI controller can be anything from a synthesizer to a drum
machine, a USB keyboard to a xylophone.
When MIDI first came out, your controller choice was limited to a keyboard,
but now you can choose between keyboards, wind controllers (for saxo-
phones or other wind instruments), guitars, or drums. So if you don’t play
piano, you’re not stuck trying to fake your way through a keyboard just so
you can use MIDI; you can find a controller that resembles an instrument that
you know how to play. Look around, and you might find one (or more) MIDI
controllers that allow you to create music your way.
Nowadays you can find MIDI controllers with the following types of 
connections:
 MIDI ports: All MIDI-compatible instruments, such as a standalone syn-
thesizer, have MIDI ports. To use this type of controller with your com-
puter, you need to have a MIDI or audio interface with MIDI ports in it.
 USB: The trend for many manufacturers is to skip the MIDI ports and to
use USB ports instead (Refer to Figure 4-12 for a look at one such con-
troller.) This action allows you to plug your controller directly into your
computer without the need for a separate MIDI or MIDI ports in your
audio interface.
In addition to controllers with MIDI ports or USB connections, you can also
find some MIDI controllers that contain audio interfaces in them. (The M-
Audio Ozone, for example, is a MIDI interface, a MIDI controller, and an audio
interface all in one.)
Sequencer
Although you can get standalone sequencers as well as sequencers inte-
grated into a synthesizer, you probably want to just use the sequencer in
your audio recording software. The reasons for this are many, but the over-
riding factor is that using the software sequencer lets you keep your MIDI and
audio tracks in one place, and most computer MIDI programs offer you more
powerful editing capabilities than a sequencer that’s contained in a box and
that uses a tiny LCD screen.
Not all recording software has MIDI capabilities. Moreover, keep in mind that
not all software programs that do support MIDI can accomplish the whole
MIDI implementation thing equally well. (In fact, you’re going to see big differ-
ences in quality.) If MIDI is important to you, make sure you get a program
that has the functions that you need. (I explain the various recording soft-
ware programs and where they stand on MIDI in Chapters 6 and 7.)

Adding Microphones to Your Studio
If you’re going to want to record any singing or any acoustic instruments,
you’re going to need at least one microphone. A mic’s job is generally to
try to capture, as closely as possible, the sound of an instrument. But you
can also use a microphone to infuse a specific sound characteristic into a
performance.
Making sense of microphone types
This section explores your microphone options and helps you make sense of
them.
Construction types
Whether a mic is a $10 cheapie that has a cord permanently attached to it
or a $15,000 pro model with gold-plated fittings, all mics convert sound waves
to electrical impulses that the preamp or mixer can read and the recorder
can store. Each of the three construction types — ribbon, dynamic, and 
condenser — captures this auditory signal in a different way, and as such,
each adds certain characteristics to the sound. Here’s how the different mics
affect sound:
 Ribbon: Adds silkiness to the recorded sound because it rolls off the
higher frequencies slightly.
 Dynamic: Tends to accent the middle of the frequency spectrum.
 Condenser: Tends to have a well-rounded frequency response.
I detail these aspects in the following sections. In most cases, the type of con-
struction dictates the general cost category in which the mics fit.
Condenser microphones
The condenser microphone is, without a doubt, the most popular style of mic
used in recording studios (home or commercial). Condenser mics are sensi-
tive and accurate, but they can also be expensive. Recently, however, con-
denser mics have come down in cost, and you can buy a decent one for
around $200. Very good ones start at about $500.
The condenser mic has an extremely thin metal (or metal-coated plastic or
Mylar) diaphragm (the part that senses the signal). The diaphragm is sus-
pended in front of a metal plate (called a backplate). Polarizing voltage is
applied to both the diaphragm and the backplate, creating a static charge in
the space between them. When the diaphragm picks up a sound, it vibrates
89
Chapter 4: Examining Audio Components

into the field between it and the backplate. This produces a small signal that
can then be amplified. Figure 4-13 shows how a condenser mic is constructed.
Dynamic microphones
Chances are you’ve had a chance to use a dynamic mic. Two hugely popular
Shure models characterize this type of mic — the SM57 and the SM58, which
has a silvery ball of gridded wire at one end and an XLR connector at the
other. Dynamic mics have several qualities that make them unique. First, they
can handle a lot of volume (technically known as SPL, meaning Sound Pressure
Level), which makes them perfect for extremely loud signals, such as drums,
amplifiers, and some rock vocals. Dynamic mics aren’t as transparent as con-
denser mics (they don’t represent high frequencies as accurately), so they
often impart a dirty or gritty sound to the signal.
The dynamic mic uses a magnetic field to convert the sound impulse from the
diaphragm into electrical energy (as in Figure 4-14). The diaphragm, often
made of plastic or Mylar, is located in front of a coil of wire called a voice
coil. The voice coil is suspended between two magnets. When the diaphragm
moves (the result of a sound), the voice coil moves as well. The interaction
between the voice coil’s movement and the magnets creates the electrical
signal.
The sound of a dynamic mic can be described as somewhat boxy, meaning
that these mics don’t represent the highest or lowest frequencies of your
hearing spectrum accurately (not necessarily a bad thing). They’re also

durable. Rough treatment probably won’t damage them much (aside from the
diaphragm), and a tough metal screen protects it. Dynamic mics are the type
used most often for live shows. They tend to be inexpensive to buy and easy
to maintain; you can get a good dynamic mic for around $100.
Ribbon microphones
A ribbon microphone produces its sound in much the same way as a dynamic
mic. The diaphragm is suspended between two magnets (sound familiar?) but
this type of mic uses a thin ribbon of aluminum (see Figure 4-15) instead of
the plastic or Mylar you’d find in a dynamic mic. Although ribbon mics were
very popular from around the 1930s to the 1960s, they’ve mostly taken a
backseat to condenser mics in today’s studios. This is mainly because ribbon
mics are fragile, expensive, and aren’t as transparent as condenser mics. In
fact, a gust of wind or a strong breath into the diaphragm is all it takes to
break a ribbon mic.
Ribbon mics are experiencing a renaissance because a lot of recording engi-
neers are searching for an old, vintage sound. Ribbon mics have a unique
sound that is often described as silky or smooth. This essentially means that
the high frequencies tend to roll off (gradually reduce) slightly, and the lower
frequencies smear together a bit.
Ribbon mics are fairly expensive. You’d be hard pressed to find a new one for
much less than $1,000.

Polarity patterns
Microphones pick up sounds in different ways, which are known as polarity
patterns. Here’s how the various patterns work:
 Omnidirectional mics can capture sounds all around them.
 Cardioid (or directional) mics pick up sounds just in front of them.
 Figure-8 (or bidirectional) mics pick up sounds from both the front and
back.
The polarity patterns on mics are represented on a chart that often comes with
the mic (or as part of its spec sheet). This chart (often called a polar graph)
shows how well the mic picks up various frequencies in front of or behind it.

You can say a lot about polarity patterns — in fact, you can find lots that I’ve
said about polarity patterns in the second edition of my Home Recording For
Musicians For Dummies — but I don’t have the space in this book to cover
everything. (Besides, the editors told me to concentrate on the PC stuff.)
Choosing mics
Getting the right mic for the right recording situation is a bit of an art form —
an art form I describe in some detail in Home Recording For Musicians For
Dummies. The following highly condensed version of my What Microphone
to Use When spiel sums it all up in just three simple questions:
 What type of music will you record? If you play rock or pop music, you
probably want to start with dynamic mics because they’re inexpensive
and their limitations in high or low frequencies don’t matter as much as
they would if (for example) you wanted to record your string quartet. In
this case, a pair of condenser mics would do the trick.
 What instruments will you record? Loud amps, drums, and screaming
singers beg to be recorded with dynamic mics, whereas light percussion,
vocals, and stand-up basses shine through with large diaphragm con-
denser mics.
 How many mics will you use at once? If you need to record your whole
band at once, budget constraints might dictate your choice between
dynamic and condenser mics or a condenser or ribbon mic for vocals.
If you need only a couple mics to record the occasional vocal or instru-
ment, you can invest more in each mic.
Monitors
The last bit of audio component gear you need is some sort of monitor. This
can be speakers or headphones. In fact, I recommend that you get both.
Headphones allow you to hear yourself while you record, and speakers let
you mix more effectively.
Without good monitors, you’re mixing in the dark because you don’t know
what your music is going to sound like on someone else’s system. Good moni-
tors let you hear your music clearly enough so that you can create mixes that
translate well (meaning they sound good on many playback systems). I dis-
cuss this concept in more detail in Chapter 14.
93
Chapter 4: Examining Audio Components

If your budget is really stretched tight and you can’t yet afford a decent set of
monitor speakers, I recommend that you get a good set of headphones and
use them exclusively until you have the bucks for some decent monitors.
Another option is to use your stereo speakers as your studio monitors until
you can get a real set (still get the good headphones, though).
Headphones
Chances are that your first home studio will be in a spare bedroom or a
corner of your garage or basement. All your recording, monitoring, and
mixing will be done in this room. If that’s the case, you’ll find that a set of
headphones is indispensable. When you use headphones, you can turn off
your speakers and still hear what’s being (or has been) recorded. When you
go to record a guitar by using a microphone in front of the guitar amp, you
want to hear only the guitar — not the guitar amp and the guitar amp coming
back through your monitors. Headphones allow you to do this.
Headphones can range in price from about $20 up to several hundred, so
surely one is within your price range. Before you buy a set of headphones
you need to consider one main issue: bleed.
Bleed is the sound from the headphones coming out into the room. This isn’t
a big deal when you mix or monitor an already recorded track, but it can
mess up your music when you record. If you’re going to use headphones
while you track (record) with a mic, make sure you get headphones with a
closed back, such as the AKG 240. Open-back headphones often bleed too
much for this purpose. The problem is that you can’t always see the differ-
ence between open- and closed-back headphones. You need to look at the
specs of the headphones to find out.
Monitor speakers
For most home recordists, the first set of monitor speakers (often simply
referred to as monitors) consist of the home stereo system, but sooner or
later you’re gonna want a real set of monitors. Studio monitors come in many
varieties, but the home recordist’s best bet is a set of near-field monitors.
Near-field monitors are speakers that are designed to be positioned close to
you (which is often the case anyway because most home recordists have
very little room in which to work).
94
Part II: Choosing and Installing Computer Hardware 

Near-field monitors come in two varieties:
 Passive: Passive monitors are just the speakers themselves, which means
that you’ll need to buy a separate amplifier to use them. If you go this
route, make sure to save some bucks for the amps because they can cost
as much as the speakers. Also keep in mind that the kind of amp you get
will impact the sound of the speakers — not all amps sound the same.
 Active: These monitors come with their own amplifiers. Going the active
route has a couple advantages: First, the amps are matched to the speak-
ers so you can (theoretically) get a better sound from them, and second,
you don’t have to buy amplifiers separately. This keeps you from having
to make yet another difficult decision when gearing up your studio. (Do
you have any idea how many amps are out there? Yep, tons.)
Whatever monitors you get, they only work for mixing your music as well as
you can hear them properly. I can’t stress enough how important it is to get
used to your monitor (see Chapter 14) and to make sure your room sounds
as good as possible (see Chapter 2).

S
o, you’ve got a pile of shiny new gear sitting in your recording space and
you’re ready to start plugging it all in. The problem is that there might be
a bunch of cords and jacks that you don’t know what to do with. No problem.
In this chapter, I help you make sense of all those connectors that you end up
using — and help you get them all plugged in properly.
Making Connections
No matter what type of home recording equipment you have, one thing’s for
sure — you’re gonna have to plug in some cords somewhere. Exactly where
depends on the particular system you own, so read through this section to
make sense of all those different cords and connectors, whether analog or
digital.
You probably have a lot of experience with analog connectors and cords,
such as the ones on your stereo system. But you might never have come in
contact with digital connectors, unless you’ve plugged in a DVD player to
your TV or had a chance to go into a recording studio that uses digital gear.
Analog
No doubt you’ve had a chance to see and use a variety of analog connectors.
If you play an electric guitar or keyboard (synthesizer), for example, you’re
familiar with a quarter-inch analog plug. And if you’ve used a variety of differ-
ent microphones, you’ve probably come across one with an XLR analog plug.

Keeping the different kinds of analog plugs straight can be a little confusing,
however. Why do you have to use one plug for one thing and another for
something else? And what’s a TRS plug, anyway?
Read on to decipher the secrets of the most common analog connectors:
quarter-inch (TS and TRS), XLR, and RCA.
The quarter-inch analog plug
The quarter-inch plug is the most common audio connector and one of the
most versatile as well. (You see it on cables strung all over the studio to con-
nect instruments, amps, speakers, headphones, and mixers.) Quarter-inch
plugs come in two varieties: TS or TRS.
TS
The humble plug at the end of the cord you use for your guitar or synthesizer
is an example of a TS plug (short for Tip/Sleeve): The tip is the very tip of the
plug, and the sleeve is the rest of the cylindrical metal part. A plastic divider
separates the two sections, each of which is connected to a different part of
the cable. Check out Figure 5-1 to see this familiar plug.
TS plugs are used for a variety of purposes — to go from your guitar to your
guitar amp, from your synthesizer to your mixer, from your mixer to your
power amplifier (amp), and from your power amp to your speakers. You’d
expect that one cord could work for all these applications. After all, a TS plug
is a TS plug is a TS plug, right? Well, not really. The same plug can be wired
differently, and it can carry different levels of power. For example, an instru-
ment cord (the one you use for your synthesizer or guitar) contains one wire
and a shield — the wire is connected to the tip, and the shield is connected
to the sleeve. A speaker cord, on the other hand, contains two wires and no
shield — one wire is connected to the tip and the other to the sleeve.
Figure 5-1:

inch plug

Part II: Choosing and Installing Computer Hardware 

The speaker cord also carries a lot more current (power) than the instrument
cable; that’s the reason it doesn’t have a shield. The high signal level covers
up any noise present in the cord. Because there isn’t nearly as much current
present in an instrument, you don’t want to use a speaker cord for your
instrument; you need the instrument cable’s shield to keep the noise down. If
you do use a speaker cord for your instrument, you might end up with some
noise — a hiss, buzz, or even a radio broadcast coming out of your amp (or
wherever you’ve plugged in your instrument).
When you buy cords with TS plugs, first be sure to look at (or ask) what pur-
pose the cord is designed for. Then, when you get it home, be sure to make a
note of what type of cord it is so that you use it correctly. You can mark your
cord a number of ways: You can put colored tape on it (red for speaker or
blue for instrument, for example), put a tag or label on it, or, gasp, dot it with
nail polish.
You generally don’t need to worry about which end of the cord you plug in
to your instrument — the signal will travel equally well in either direction.
However, currently (so to speak), you can buy cords that are designed to send
the current in one direction. (The cord has an arrow on it designating which
direction the signal should flow.) I call these designer cords, and two of the most
common brands are Monster and Planet Waves. The theory behind these cords
is that they do a better job of preserving the sound qualities of the instrument
for which they’re designed. These cords are specifically designed for almost
every instrument and application known to humankind.
Instrument cords are often called unbalanced lines because of the way they’re
wired. An unbalanced cord has one wire surrounded by a braided shield; the
wire is connected to the tip of the TS plug, and the shield is connected to the
sleeve. The signal is sent through the wire, and the shield is used for the
ground. (It keeps the noise down.) There are balanced lines as well, which I
explain in the upcoming section on TRS plugs.
TRS
A TRS (short for Tip/Ring/Sleeve) quarter-inch plug looks like a stereo head-
phone plug (take a look at Figure 5-2). The tip is at the very end of the plug,
the ring is the small middle section located between the two plastic dividers,
and the sleeve is the rest of the cylindrical metal part of the plug. A TRS plug
can be used several ways: as a stereo cord for headphones, a balanced cord
or with a Y cord.
A balanced cord is used on professional audio gear to connect the various
pieces of equipment (the mixer to the recorder, for example). The advantage
with a balanced cord is that you can have longer cord runs without creating
noise.
99
Chapter 5: Connecting Your Hardware

Why is it that balanced cords are so conveniently noise-free? The balanced
cord has two wires and a shield inside, and is wired with the same signal 
running through both wires. One is 180 degrees out of phase with the other
(their waveforms are exactly opposite) — the crest of one wave occurs at
exactly the same time as the trough of the other, so they cancel each other
out. When they get to the mixer (or wherever they’re plugged into), one of
the signals is instantly flipped and added to the other. Any noise that was
built up in the signal is cancelled out. (Yep, it’s wave cancellation from high-
school physics. Who knew it also rocks?)
A Y cord consists of a TRS plug on one end and two TS plugs on the other,
forming — you guessed it — a nice representation of the letter Y. The pur-
pose of this cord is to allow you to insert an effects processor (a compressor
or equalizer, for example) into the line-in insert jack of a mixer. The TRS plug
both sends and receives a signal. The Y cord is wired so the tip sends the
signal and the ring receives it (see Figure 5-3). The sleeve is connected to the
shield of each cable.
XLR
The XLR connector is used for microphones and some line connections
between professional gear. This cable has a female and a male end. (See
Figure 5-4.) The cord is wired much like a TRS connector and is balanced to
keep the noise down. The XLR microphone cable is also called a low-Z cable
because it carries a low-impedance signal.
RCA
RCA plugs — named for good old RCA, also called phono plugs — are common
on home stereo (and some semi-pro) audio gear. (See Figure 5-5.) They function
much like a TS plug and aren’t very common in professional audio equipment.

Some mixers include them, however, so you can connect a tape deck. They’re
also used for digital S/PDIF signals. (See the next section for more on these
babies.)

Digital
Because you’re sure to be using a digital audio interface in combination with
your computer when recording, you’re going to get comfortable with digital
connectors. Digital audio equipment is a recent invention — no one standard
has emerged. Because of this lack of standardization, a variety of digital con-
nectors are on the market, only a few (or one) of which might be equipment
that you own or intend to purchase. Regardless, knowing about the most
common connectors and their purposes will help you decide what equipment
is right for you.
MIDI
MIDI, short for Musical Instrument Digital Interface, is a handy communica-
tion protocol that allows musical information to pass from one device to
another. To allow for the free passage of such information, MIDI jacks are
located on a whole host of electronic instruments — synthesizers, drum
machines, sound modules, and even some guitars have MIDI jacks. And, in
order to connect all these instruments, you need some MIDI cables. The MIDI
cable contains five pins (male) that plug in to the female MIDI jack (port) on
the instrument or device. (See Figure 5-6.)
Some audio interfaces, such as the Digidesign Digi 002, have MIDI ports in
them, but others, such as the MOTU 896, don’t. If you want to use MIDI and
you have an interface without MIDI ports, you obviously need to buy a sepa-
rate MIDI interface. Regardless of which audio or MIDI interface you have,
you will need to buy the cable for those ports separately.

Part II: Choosing and Installing Computer Hardware 

AES/EBU
AES/EBU (Audio Engineering Society/European Broadcasting Union) cables are
much like S/PDIF cables (see the following section). The AES/EBU standards
require that these cables transmit two channels of data at a time. They differ
from S/PDIF connectors in that they consist of XLR plugs and use balanced
cables. (See Figure 5-7.) The AES/EBU standards were developed to be used
with professional audio components, hence the use of balanced connections —
the kinds used in professional-level equipment.
S/PDIF
S/PDIF (short for Sony/Phillips Digital Interface Format) connectors consist
of an unbalanced coaxial cable (one wire and a shield) and RCA plugs. (See
Figure 5-7.) They can also be made from fiber-optic cable and a Toslink con-
nector (also called an ADAT optical connector; see Figure 5-8). The S/PDIF
format can transmit two channels of digital data at once. S/PDIF protocols
are very similar to AES/EBU standards, except S/PDIF was originally designed
for the consumer rather than the professional market — which explains why
unbalanced cords are used. Even so, you can find S/PDIF connectors on a lot
of pro recording gear along with (or instead of) AES/EBU.
If you want to use cords longer than about 3 or 4 feet when you’re using a
S/PDIF connection — or about 15 feet for AES/EBU connections — your best
bet is to use video or digital audio cables. Regular audio cables degrade the
sound at longer distances because they can’t transmit the type of signal that
digital equipment produces without affecting the quality of the sound. If you
use regular audio cables for longer distances, the sound loses some defini-
tion, becoming what some people describe as grainy.

ADAT Optical
The ADAT (Alesis Digital Audio Tape) Optical (also known as lightpipe) format
can send eight tracks of digital audio at once. Developed by Alesis, ADAT
Optical has become a standard among digital audio products. It consists of a
fiber-optic cable using a special Toslink connector (see the “S/PDIF” section
earlier). Audio interfaces allow you to use the ADAT optical for either eight
channels of ADAT information or for Optical S/PDIF connections — but you
can generally only use one or the other at one time. You choose your prefer-
ence from your audio recording software hardware menu.

USB
USB stands for Universal Serial Bus and is a common component of nearly all
computers currently made. Chances are good that your computer has more
than one USB jack and you’ve plugged a USB cord into a jack more times that
you’d like to remember.
In case it’s been a while since you’ve had to mess with your USB connection,
take a look at Figure 5-9. As you can see, USB has two different plugs for two
different jacks: rectangular and square. The rectangular connection is called
the “A” connection and is for any receiving device such as your PC or a USB
hub. The square connection is called the “B” connection and is used for a
sending device, such as your USB audio interface or printer.
Aside from two different types of jacks and plugs, USB also has two different
standards: USB 1.1 and USB 2. USB 1.1 can handle a data rate of up to 12 Mbps
(megabits per second), and USB 2 can handle 40-times that rate — 480 Mbps.
Currently, USB interfaces primarily use USB 1.1 and, because of the relatively
slow transfer speed, have limited input and output options. USB 2 has consid-
erable faster transfer rates, so expect audio interfaces to use this approach
more in the future. (Chapter 4 has more on audio interfaces.)

FireWire
Developed by Apple Computer, FireWire (also known as IEEE 1394 or iLink) is
a high-speed connection that many audio interfaces, hard drives, digital cam-
eras, and other devices use. Even though FireWire was developed by Apple,
you can find FireWire ports on devices from many manufacturers. FireWire
connectors (see Figure 5-10), unlike USB connectors (see the preceding sec-
tion), are the same on both ends.
Like USB, FireWire supports two types: FireWire 400 (the regular one) and
FireWire 800. FireWire 400 supports data transfer speeds up to 400 Mbps, and
FireWire 800 can handle transfer rates of, yep, you guessed it, 800 Mbps. A lot
of audio interfaces currently use FireWire 400 as a way to connect with your
computer. These interfaces can handle quite a few inputs and outputs with-
out any problems. I expect that you’ll soon see interfaces supported by
FireWire 800 in the not-too-distant future. (I’ll admit that this isn’t exactly a
risky assumption.)

Getting Hooked Up
Hooking up all your gear can be a truly rewarding experience. That is, if you
get everything working without a hassle. Getting hooked up properly isn’t
rocket science, you need to take some issues into consideration when doing
it to make sure that you don’t break anything and that you don’t degrade the
sound of your system. This section walks you through the process.
Connecting your computer
A computer has lots of different connectors; which ones you actually have to
mess with depends on the type of other gear (such as an audio interface) that
you have. Here are some things to remember when plugging into and unplug-
ging from your computer:
 USB and FireWire can be hot-swapped. In other words, you can plug
and unplug stuff from these ports without having to turn off your com-
puter. You computer senses the change in components when you switch
and adjust accordingly.
 Always turn off and unplug your computer before opening the com-
puter’s case. Your computer has a lot of electrical components inside
it, and touching them when your computer is plugged in can cause 
electrocution.
For many audio interfaces, you don’t need to worry about opening your
computer. However, in the case of adding RAM or connecting a PCI inter-
face (see Chapter 4) you need to open the case.
 De-static yourself before touching any internal components. Before
you touch any of the computer components inside the computer case,
touch the metal of the computer’s case to ground yourself and release
any built-up static electricity. Touching a component without releasing
the static first can case a static charge to damage the component.
If you put your computer’s CPU unit in another room (Chapter 2 has more on
this), make sure that you get the proper cable and signal boosters so that
your signal doesn’t degrade. For example, USB cables can be run for about
15 feet before you need a powered hub to boost the signal. Likewise, the Mac
LCD displays are powered by the computer and can only handle a 10-foot
extension to the cable before the signal drops to the point of being unreliable.

Chapter 5: Connecting Your Hardware

Interface
The audio interface is the core of your audio recording computer. It contains
all the components that you need to turn your analog music into something
your computer can work with. And it also turns the digital bits back into your
music again. As important as this piece of equipment is, it’s extremely easy to
hook up.
As I describe in Chapter 4, several different types of audio interfaces exist,
and each one connects to your computer differently. The following sections
describe each type and show you how to connect the interface to your 
computer.
PCI-based systems
PCI-based interfaces require that you install the PCI card into an available PCI
slot inside your computer. For some people, opening up a computer to con-
nect the PCI card can be nerve-wracking. These instructions cut the problem
down to size:
1. Shut down your computer and unplug it from the wall outlet.
You’re going to be messing around inside the computer case and you
really don’t want any power connected to it.
2. Open the case.
This step usually requires removing a couple screws from the rear of the
case to allow removal of the side panel on the left.
3. Touch the metal frame of your computer.
This step discharges any static electricity you might have built up.
It takes only a small spark of static electrical discharge to ruin sensitive
electronics on the card or in your computer. So, whenever you handle
electronic components, be certain to discharge any built-up static
charges, and never touch anything inside your computer case — or
on the PCI card — that you don’t absolutely have to.
4. Remove the interface’s PCI card from its static-free bag.
Grip it from the edges (like holding a CD of your favorite music) and be
careful not to drop it.
5. Locate an open PCI slot (consult your computer’s manual if you don’t
know where this is) and gently push the PCI card into the slot — it
goes in only one way.
Be careful not to bend the card or use excessive force, but make certain
you have it fully seated into the PCI slot. If you’re unsure where the PCI
slots are or how the PCI card fits, consult both your computer’s manual
as well as the manual that came with the audio interface you’re using.
108
Part II: Choosing and Installing Computer Hardware 

Take your time and don’t rush this step. I’ve seen more than one audio
interface that had intermittent problems because of an improperly
installed card.
6. Screw in the screws for the PCI card to fully seat the card.
7. Close your computer case.
If your interface doesn’t have a break-out box, you’re ready to boot up and
install your software. Chapter 8 has the details for this procedure.
On the other hand, if your PCI interface consists of a PCI card and a break-out
box (Chapter 4 has more on these items), you need to connect the PCI card
to the break-out box. This particular type of audio interface unit comes with a
special cable to do this and involves these simple steps:
1. Attach one end of the cable to the long connector on the back of the
PCI card (which you can now find at the back of your computer).
2. Connect the other end to the connector (generally labeled Computer)
on the back of the break-out box.
3. Double-check your connections to make sure the cable is securely
connected.
4. Plug in your computer’s power cord and boot up your computer if you
don’t have any other installations to make.
You’re ready to install the software. Consult Chapter 8 (or your interface and
software manuals) for the specifics.
FireWire
Compared to connecting a PCI interface, hooking up a FireWire interface to
your computer is child’s play:
1. Shut down your computer.
Although FireWire can be hot-swapped, your system needs to be turned
off before you make the connection the first time. The disconnection
allows your computer to find the new device when you turn it on. After
the first time, you can plug and unplug the interface even with the com-
puter turned on.
2. Attach the FireWire cable to the FireWire connector on the back of
the interface.
3. Plug in the other end of the cable to the FireWire connector on your
computer.
109
Chapter 5: Connecting Your Hardware

4. Connect the power cable to your FireWire interface and plug it into
the wall power socket.
5. Turn your computer back on and install your software.
Most manufacturers recommend that you avoid using any FireWire hubs and
instead connect the interface directly to a FireWire port on your computer.
USB
Even though USB ports are hot-swappable, it’s a good idea to turn off your
computer before you install your USB interface for the first time. Here are
the steps:
1. Shut down your computer.
2. Attach the included USB cable to your interface’s USB jack.
3. Plug in the other end of the cable to the USB connector on your 
computer.
Don’t use a USB hub; plug the cable directly into your computer. This
keeps your signal from being interrupted by having too much data trying
to get through one USB line.
4. Turn your computer back on and install your software.
Input devices
Your keyboard, guitars, and mics need to be plugged in somewhere. For most
home recordists just starting out — people unlikely to have external mixers,
preamps, and direct boxes — the plug-in place of choice will be the audio
interface. Here’s a quick rundown on how to connect these input devices:
 Keyboards and other electronic instruments: Plug an instrument cable
from the output of your instrument to one of the instrument inputs of
your interface. This type of input usually lacks a preamp and sometimes
doesn’t even have an input gain (volume) control, but depending on your
interface it might be an input with a preamp and/or gain control in it.
If your interface’s input doesn’t have a gain control, you use the main
volume control on your instrument to control the volume level going
to your computer. If your interface’s input has a gain control — either
with a preamp or not — you need to balance the level of your instru-
ment output to the level of your input gain control so that you get a
good sound. Chapter 9 details this process.
 Guitars and other string instruments with electric pick-ups: Plug a
guitar cable from the output of your guitar (or other instrument) to an
input in your interface that can handle guitar signals. Which type of
110
Part II: Choosing and Installing Computer Hardware 

input this ends up being depends on your interface. Most interfaces can
handle a guitar in one of the preamp inputs, but many can also handle it
in one of the instrument inputs. (You can often tell whether this is the
case by the instrument inputs having a gain (volume) control on them —
no gain no way, yes gain yes way.) Check your interface’s manual to see
which inputs can handle the signal from a guitar.
When you record, you adjust both the guitar output and the interface’s
input gain to get the level you want. Chapter 10 offers more detail on
this process.
 Microphones: Plug an XLR microphone cable from the output of your
mic to one of the preamp-equipped inputs of your interface. You use the
gain control on your interface and the placement of your mic to set the
level of your mic signal. Again, check out Chapter 10 for tips on getting a
good signal level all the way to your computer.
If you use an external preamp to record your mic signals, you plug your
mic cable’s output into the preamp’s input and run the appropriate cable
(usually an unbalanced TS or a balanced TRS, depending on your equip-
ment) from the output of your preamp to one of the instrument inputs of
your interface. The level is adjusted at the external preamp and not your
audio interface.
Monitors
Hooking up your monitors is the last step in the process of being able to
get your sound into and back out of your computer. How you connect your
monitors to your audio interface depends on whether you have powered or
unpowered monitors and the type of connectors that are included in your
monitors.
Powered
Powered (active) monitors can be connected directly to your audio inter-
face’s main outputs. For most home recording equipment, this means using
either a TS instrument cable or balanced TRS cable. Some interfaces and
monitors can handle both — check the manual for each of these components
to see what you need to buy.
If your interface and monitors only use TS connectors, keep the length of
your cords as short as possible because long runs of unbalanced cords can
develop noise. If you have the option of balanced cords, go that route. Also,
and this is getting kinda tweaky, use the same length cords for both monitors
even if one monitor sits closer to the interface than the other. This ensures
that the sound gets to both monitors at the same microsecond. (I told you
this is kinda tweaky.)
111
Chapter 5: Connecting Your Hardware

Some monitors also have balanced XLR connectors, but you won’t find them
on many of the interfaces currently available. They’re used primarily on pro-
fessional gear such as separate high-end converters.
To make the connection, simply run the cord from the main outputs of your
interface to the inputs of your speakers. Pretty simple, huh?
Unpowered
Unpowered (passive) monitors require an amplifier between your audio inter-
face and the speakers. In this case, you run unbalanced TS or balanced TRS,
depending on your interface and amp specifications (check your owner’s
manuals for details), from the main outputs of your interface to the inputs
of your amp. Then run speaker cables from your amp to your monitors. The
jack/plug configuration — and in turn the cords — will depend on your equip-
ment. Some amps use banana plugs (two-pronged connectors used for pro-
fessional speakers) for the outputs while others use TS plugs. Monitors might
use either of these as well.
If you use your home stereo speakers as your studio monitors, you need to
get some special cords because your interface will have either TS or TRS
jacks, and your stereo receiver will have RCA jacks. In this case, get cords
that have TS on one end and RCA on the other. Plug the TS end into the main
outputs of your interface and the RCA end into one of the Aux inputs of your
stereo receiver. Then just hook up your speakers (if they aren’t already
hooked up), and you’re set to go.
If you use your home stereo to power your speakers, you need to turn the
volume on your receiver up a bit to get sound from your interface. Because
your interface also has an output level adjuster, you need to do some experi-
menting with the volume of both the interface output and the receiver volume
to get a decent sound. If your stereo receiver’s volume is too low, you need to
crank your audio interface output to get your music loud enough. This can
result in a thin sound or in distortion. Likewise, if you have your stereo
receiver’s volume too high, that can make the volume control on your audio
interface too touchy, and you can easily end up with distortion. Finding the
right balance between the two volume levels will take some time. You know
when you’ve got it right when you can get a good solid sound without distor-
tion at a volume that is comfortable to listen to.

O
ne of the first things you’ll notice when you start digging through all the
software options available for audio recording programs is that much of
this stuff pretty much performs the same basic functions. All the major pro-
grams let you record and edit audio, record and edit MIDI data, add effects,
and process audio a number of ways, and they also let you mix and master
your audio to make your music sound the way it does in your head. The dif-
ference is the degree to which you can perform the various functions in your
chosen program and the ease at which you can perform these functions.
With so many different programs out there, it’s hard to keep them all straight.
In this chapter, I offer what assistance I can by introducing you to many of the
basic functions available in computer-based recording software and showing
you what to look for so that you can choose the best program for your needs.
Even though you might find that certain programs share similar basic features,
not all audio recording software is equal. In fact, as you look around and dig
into the specifications of each program, you’ll discover some big differences
among the various contenders. This chapter explores the many different func-
tions that are available in audio recording programs so that you can determine
which features are important to you when you buy a program. Chapter 7
details some of the most popular programs and explains what each can and
can’t do. Between these two chapters, you can get a good idea of which pro-
grams you want to try out.

Audio Recording and Editing Basics
Audio recording is one of the primary recording functions in a computer. With
that fact out of the way, you should also know that you need to consider three
main areas when looking at the audio capabilities of a program: track counts,
recording formats, and editing functions. This section details these functions.
Track counts
Even though the overall number of tracks you can record and play in your
computer system is dictated by the power of your processor and your hard
drive speed, some programs constrain you even further by limiting the
number of audio tracks that you can have active in a song. This limitation is
generally seen on the lower-end programs offered by software manufacturers
and is simply a way for manufacturers to give you an incentive to upgrade to
one of their higher-priced versions. For example, Pro Tools LE has an active
track limit of 32 tracks, whereas Pro Tools TDM extends this limit to 192
audio tracks.
If you plan to work on music that requires a lot of instruments and/or effects,
you need to think long and hard about track limitations before purchasing.
Although many people consider it excessive, pop tunes often have as many
as 100 or more tracks (dozens of which are for just the vocals), so filling up
32 isn’t as difficult as you might imagine.
Recording
All audio recording programs record audio (if you find one that doesn’t, don’t
buy it), but how they do it differs. These differences involve the following
options:
 Sample rate: The sample rate refers to the number of times per second
that the audio is sampled. This relates to the frequency range that can
be captured by your computer. Sample rates typically include 44.1 kHz,
48 kHz, 88.2 kHz, and 96 kHz. Some programs, such as Logic, can go as
high as 192 kHz or higher. For audio work that ends up on CD, 44.1 kHz is
fine, but if you want to record audio for DVD, you need to have the capa-
bility to record at 96 kHz. Some other reasons to record at a higher
sample rate exist — the most relevant being that as your sample rate
goes up, your latency (the delay between the sound entering your
system and coming back out to your ears) goes down.
That said, most musicians still record at 44.1 kHz. This sample rate cap-
tures a sufficient frequency range — well beyond the human hearing
limit — and keeps you from having to do a sample rate conversion (SRC)
116
Part III: Choosing and Installing Recording Software 

process to get your music to CD level. In addition, this lower sample rate
puts less stress on your computer because half as much data is moving
through your system at a given time compared to 88.2 kHz. As an added
bonus, recording at 44.1 kHz means half as much hard drive space is
needed for your audio files.
 Bit depth: As I describe in Chapter 4, bit depth is the amount of informa-
tion contained in each of the samples (see the sample rate bullet) taken
of your audio. You find two different bit depths in current audio record-
ing software: 16 bit and 24 bit. There is no comparison between these
two — go with 24 bit. Even though 16 bit is the bit depth of CDs and your
music most likely will end up there, having the extra 8 bits available to
mess around with is important if you do any processing of your signal.
Audio recording programs also have what’s called internal bit depth.
This is the bit depth that the programs use when performing digital
signal processing tasks such as volume changes and EQ. This internal
rate is set much higher than the bit depth you record at so that your
system can process your audio when you do things like equalizing or
changing the volume of your track. Typical rates you see in recording
programs include 48-point fixed rate or 32-point float. Don’t buy into the
hype about one approach being better than another. They all work simi-
larly, and all the professional-level programs sound very much alike.
Make your choice based on the computer platform you use and the fea-
tures you want in a program.
 File format: Most recording programs let you choose from a variety of
file formats in which to record. Although no universal file format exists
to ensure compatibility between different programs, most programs can
record and play back Broadcast Wave (.bwav or .wav extension). This is
an important function because as you grow in your music-recording
skills — and as recording programs develop — you might find that you
want to use a different program to continue recording or to mix your
songs. By using a program that has the ability to work with Broadcast
Wave files, you future-proof yourself (a bit anyway).
Editing
All audio recording programs can edit audio, but the way they do it and the
degree to which you can make difficult edits (such as replacing a single note
within a complex musical phrase) vary a lot.
Pro Tools, the heavy-weight champion of the audio editing world (in my expe-
rience, anyway), has some very thoughtful features that make editing audio
very fast and easy. These include:
117
Chapter 6: Understanding Computer Recording Software

 Shuffle: This is an editing mode that lets you move sections of audio
around while keeping the beginnings and endings of adjoining sections
lined up tightly. (See Figure 6-1.) This particular feature is showing up in
more programs — Logic Pro 7 just added some features similar to the
shuffle feature, for instance — and is useful for working on your song’s
arrangements, especially the drum parts where there’s no break
between sections.
 Tab to Transient: This is by far my favorite feature. It’s a real time-saver
when you have to cut up sections of a recorded audio. Tab to Transient
lets you move from one transient peak (the start of a vocal phrase or the
initial crack of a drum hit, for example) to another, as shown in Figure
6-2. In programs without this feature, you have to zoom way in to the
waveform display of your audio and manually locate the very start of a
section. This can take a lot of time. The Tab to Transient feature makes 
it as easy as pressing Tab on your computer keyboard.
 Spot: This is an essential feature if you want to link an event to a specific
point of another event in your song. For example, if you have a piece of
video that needs a sound effect added, you can place the start of the
sound effect to the exact spot in the video using this feature. Then if you
move the video over one way or the other, the spotted audio moves with
it automatically. This feature is common in programs like Nuendo and
Logic — ones that work well with video, in other words.
 Scrub: In the olden days of tape decks, if you wanted to find a specific
place in your song, you rocked the tape against the playback head of
your tape deck to hear your audio. This action, called scrubbing, allowed
you to find the start of a drum hit, for instance. Most self-respecting
audio programs have a scrub feature. (See Figure 6-3.) Some scrub fea-
tures are a bit cumbersome to use, but others mimic the process of
scrubbing on a tape deck very well. If you plan on doing any audio edit-
ing, make sure that the program you’re considering has a scrub function
and that it works well for you.

ments easy.
118

You can find many other audio editing functions in the gazillion different
audio recording (and editing) programs out there. If the multitrack recording
program you like to use doesn’t have all the editing capabilities that you find
you need, you don’t need to trash your current program. Instead, you com-
plement it by getting a stereo audio editor program such as WaveLab or Cool
Edit Pro.
The Scrub feature lets you hear a certain section.

Chapter 6: Understanding Computer Recording Software

Making Sense of MIDI Capabilities
Most recording programs have some sort of MIDI capability. Some are pretty
rudimentary (Pro Tools, anyone?), but others (such as Logic or Sonar) are
quite extensive. Regardless of what recording program you’re looking at, if it
has MIDI capabilities it’s going to let you record MIDI data, play the data back,
and edit it. So if you intend to use only an occasional soft-synth or keyboard
in your music, just about any recording program that has MIDI capabilities
will meet your needs. If you see yourself using a lot of MIDI or if you want to
be able to do extensive edits or perform MIDI operations on your data, you
need to look closely at your options to find the program that meets your needs
(and desires).
Here are some things to look for in MIDI-capable recording programs:
 Quantization: Quantization is the ability to adjust the timing (rhythm) of
your performance to match a grid. Basic programs let you use a fairly
simple grid — such as 16th notes — whereas more sophisticated pro-
grams allow you to quantize to a grid and keep the feel of your music by
not adhering strictly to the grid lines. Instead, these programs can fix
your timing mistakes while injecting a bit of human-type feel to your per-
formance. If your sense of rhythm isn’t that great, being able to quantize
with feel can mean the difference between a track that kinda works and
one that rocks.
 Multiple windows: The most rudimentary MIDI programs offer a simple
piano roll window (the graphic looks like the roll of paper with holes
punched in it that old-time player pianos used). This window shows the
MIDI notes as small rectangles representing the pitch, time location in the
song, and duration. You can edit within this window, but if you do much
editing this is a cumbersome way of going about it. MIDI-intensive pro-
grams give you the ability to edit your MIDI data by using a window that
looks like a piece of sheet music and/or has a list of MIDI events in column
form. Having several windows to choose from allows you to use the one
that best fits the type of editing you want to do, thus speeding up the
process. Figure 6-4 shows a couple alternative windows in Logic — one
of the most capable MIDI programs available.
 Transposition: Being able to change (or transpose) the key of a perfor-
mance is high on the list of must-have functions for many people. Most
MIDI-capable programs offer this option. The difference you find between
the various programs is in the ease with which you can do this and the
specific steps you need to take to get it done.
 Scoring: Scoring is the ability to take your MIDI data and print it out as a
piece of sheet music. If you’re a composer that creates your music to be
played by other musicians, being able to score your music from MIDI
data might be an important feature.
120
Part III: Choosing and Installing Recording Software 

Looking at Looping
Looping, simply put, is the ability to take a short snippet of music (called,
logically enough, a loop) and arrange it with other loops in a song until you
have a composition that you like. Loops can be snippets that you make from
your recorded performances, or they can be pre-recorded files that you can
buy from a large variety of loop makers.
I’ve got mixed feelings about looping. On the one hand, you can take a pre-
recorded snippet of audio and put it in your song and create a composition
without having to actually play an instrument. This can be a real time-saver
when composing. On the other hand, you don’t need to learn how to play an
instrument to do this. This can result not only in not taking the time to learn
how to play an instrument, but also in not taking the time to really under-
stand music composition and theory. Don’t get me wrong. I’ve never been a
rule follower (musically, anyway), but I’ve found that breaking the rules
Figure 6-4:
Powerful
MIDI
programs
tend to 
have
several
windows
that you 
can work in.
121
Chapter 6: Understanding Computer Recording Software

works only if you know the rules in the first place. My experience is that, with
looping, the temptation is to skip the rule-learning process, which makes
breaking the rules less of a creative decision and more of a decision made
because the recordist doesn’t know any better. But I digress.
Anyway, I’ll leave the ethical struggle to you over whether using loops in
music constitutes a real musical composition or a fast-food version of music-
making. (I have no bias, really. No really, I mean it. Really. . . .)
Loops, whether you like them or not, are here to stay. In fact, looping has
become pretty much standard in songs that you hear on radio stations favored
by the teen set, and it’s even gaining popularity among serious composers.
Most audio recording programs have some ability to use loops. At the very
minimum, almost all programs let you insert loops into your song and arrange
them to meet your needs, as shown in Figure 6-5. Here the loop automatically
adjusts its tempo to fit your song and can be transposed up or down to fit the
key of your composition.
Beyond these basics, many programs — ACID is one example — offer you
ways to manipulate the loops to make them unique. A short sampling of what
you can do includes the following functions:
 Edit: The contents of the loop often show up in your program either as
MIDI data or as audio waveforms. If it’s MIDI data, you can edit the notes
just like you would any other MIDI data, including changing duration,
placement in time, and pitch. Audio waveform data can be cut and
pasted and otherwise edited by using the same techniques you’d use to
edit standard audio data.
Sophisticated looping programs give you more editing power to create
your own unique loops and effects from the included loops.
Figure 6-5:
Using loops
is as 
simple as
clicking and
dragging
one into

122
Part III: Choosing and Installing Recording Software 

 Quantize: You can adjust the timing of your loops in many loop programs
(quantize is the term of choice here). Basic programs allow you to quan-
tize only MIDI-based loops, but full-featured programs offer the ability to
quantize audio loops as well. This can be handy because adding a bunch
of loops together — where each has a slightly different feel — can result
in a sloppy-sounding groove. Quantizing all the loops in one fell swoop
can fix the problem.
You can also find groove-quantizing features that make it easy for you to
morph existing loops into a different feel. This tool makes your loop
library go further and allows you to create even more unique music.
 Lots of loops: More powerful loop programs come with more extensive
loop libraries. Of course, if you buy a less expensive looping program,
you can always add more loops.
 Beat mapping: This feature is handy for remixing. With this tool, you can
map the tempo of an existing song so that you can add looped passages
to it easily. You’re not likely to find this feature in lower-end programs;
it’s been relegated to more powerful loop programs.
 Effects: Some programs offer the ability to create effects such as real-
time reverse of your loop, DJ stuttering effects, and many others. More
likely than not, the more powerful the program, the more powerful the
effects you can perform on your loops.
123
Chapter 6: Understanding Computer Recording Software
Connecting two (or more) programs
Chances are that, as you build your computer-
based studio, you’ll find more than one program
that you want to use. And chances are good
that you use one program for one thing and the
other for something else. For example, maybe
you want to use Pro Tools for recording and
mixing audio and ACID for composing with
loops. (Chapter 7 has more about these and
other programs.)
To top it off, you’re probably going to want to 
use both these programs at the same time and
you’re going to want them to synchronize with
one another. If this is the case, you’re in luck
because there’s a program that is made to
handle this scenario. It’s called ReWire
(www.propellerheads.se/
technologies).
If you have a vague inkling that you might one
day want to hook one program to another, make
sure that it’s ReWire capable, because as the
audio recording world stands now, the ReWire
way is becoming the standard way to connect
programs.

Making Use of Mixing
Mixing is one of the essential elements of all audio recording programs. Mixing
is the ability to blend your individual tracks together into a single pair of
stereo tracks. Simple mixers let you control the volume and panning informa-
tion (left to right positioning in the stereo field), whereas full-featured mixers
give you nearly complete flexibility over numerous elements of your tracks.
These include
 Automation: Being able to automate your mix — changing volumes, pan-
ning, effects send levels, and others — is important because when you
mix with your mouse you can adjust only one thing at a time. To have a
complex mix where each of your tracks has changes throughout the
song requires decent automation capabilities. Powerful programs let you
adjust everything: volume, panning, muting, soloing, send levels, effects
parameters, and so on.
 Send effects: Sends are signal routing functions that let you send part of
your audio signal to a different place in the mixer. Basic programs limit
the number of Sends available to you for each track to as few as 5,
whereas more sophisticated programs raise this limit to 64 or more. This
feature is important if you do complex mixes that use numerous effects.
(For this, you also need a very powerful computer or a host-based
effects processor. Chapter 15 has much more on Sends, including host-
based plug-ins).
 Inserts: Inserts are signal routing functions that let to place an effect
inline with the audio signal as it works its way through the mixer. Like
Send limitations (see preceding bullet) many basic programs have low
limits on the number of insert effects you can plug in to each track. Full-
featured programs raise this limit to where you have much more flexibil-
ity in what you can do.
 Surround mixing: Being able to mix beyond a two-channel stereo format
can be helpful if you mix for video or DVD audio. Basic programs don’t
offer this option, so if this important to you, you need to look for a full-
featured (read: more expensive) solution.
 Offline bouncing: Offline bouncing lets you mix your song as quickly as
your computer’s processor can process the data rather than in real time.
This is a handy feature if you have a lot of songs to mix or if your songs
are long. The alternative is real-time bouncing, where your song plays at
regular speed (and you hear it all through your speakers). With long
songs, the wait can be agonizing (for me anyway). This feature is one I
consider a necessity, though it might not be one for you.
124
Part III: Choosing and Installing Recording Software 

Digging Into Digital Signal Processing
Being able to digitally process your audio after you’ve recorded it is one of
the pluses that computer-based recording has going for it. This processing is
either done with plug-ins that you can add to your chosen audio recording
program (see Chapter 15) or is one of the functions available in the program
you buy.
Plug-ins can easily be added to any program, so the digital signal processing
(DSP) abilities contained in a program are going to be only a minor concern
for you when you’re program shopping. Regardless, here are some processing
functions that you might find in your audio recording programs:
 Duplication: Being able to quickly and easily duplicate a selection
allows you to mess with your audio data without the risk of losing your
original data. Even though most audio editing operations are done non-
destructively (meaning they don’t change the original audio data), many
DSP functions do alter your data, so you need to make sure you work on
a duplicate in case you do something that you dislike and want to go
back to the original.
 Consolidation: As you edit your audio tracks, you often end up with a
bunch of short snippets arranged end to end to make your song. Although
you can leave these individual sections separate, it’s often better to con-
solidate them into one continuous audio file when you mix. This takes
some of the load off your hard drive and makes it easier later on if you
want to export or import the track to another program to work on it
there (such as taking it to a professional mixer). In this case, being able
to consolidate is important. Not all programs have this function, so look
closely if you want to be able to do this.
 Quantization: Being able to quantize MIDI is a common feature, but
quantizing audio files requires a more elaborate program. This feature is
easily abused, but when you need it (you’ve recorded a track that you
know you can’t replicate, but it needs some timing adjustment, for 
example), it can save you tons of hassle.
 Transposition/pitch shifting: Like quantization, being able to transpose
a MIDI phrase is a no-brainer, but being able to do this to an audio file
takes a more sophisticated program. Having this option can save you
from having to re-record all your tracks when you finally realize (or admit)
that you can’t sing your song in the key you recorded it in.

Chapter 6: Understanding Computer Recording Software

Finishing Up with Mastering
The final step in recording your music is to master it. Mastering is the process
of optimizing the dynamics and tonal balance of your music, arranging the
sequence of your songs, and getting it to the format needed to make copies
for distribution.
For an audio recording program to be able to do mastering, you need the fol-
lowing capabilities:
 Parametric equalizer: A parametric equalizer is an EQ where you can
adjust precise frequencies. This type of EQ is necessary in mixing as well
as mastering. Because of this, most audio recording programs have one.
If not, or if the one supplied with the programs doesn’t sound very good
(all too common, unfortunately), you can get a third-party plug-in to do
the job in your existing program. Chapter 15 has more about finding
third-party plug-ins.
 Multiband compressor: A multiband compressor is a compressor that
lets you apply different levels of compression to specific frequency
ranges. You won’t find a multiband compressor in many of the audio
recording programs, so you might need to get a third-party plug-in for this.
 Limiter: A limiter is essential if you want to squeeze out a bit more
volume in your music. Most audio recording programs come with a lim-
iter; the question is going to be whether the limiter included with the
program is good enough to do the job necessary in mastering. A master-
ing limiter should be absolutely transparent — it should have no sound
of its own when plugged in.
 Dithering: If you follow my recommendations, you’ll get a program that
can record in 24 bits. This means that when you’re done recording,
mixing, and mastering your music, you need to get your music from 24
bits to 16 bits so you can put it on a CD. You want to do this without
messing with the sound of your music, so you want to have the option of
being able to apply dither — a process that adds random noise to your
music to make it sound better as it fades out. Most full-featured pro-
grams come with a decent selection of dithering algorithms that you can
apply when you create a bounce of your mix. 
Most audio recording software can handle most of the basic tasks you put
before it, but audio recording programs aren’t often set up to handle the last
step — putting your music on CD. In this case, you need to get a CD-burning
program that can create Red Book audio CDs from your CD-Rs. I cover the
elements of mastering and provide a list of programs you can use for this last
step in Chapter 14.

Finding the Right 
Software for You
In This Chapter

 Checking out the major players: Pro Tools, Logic, SONAR, and Nuendo
 Looking at other options: ACID, Cubase, Digital Performer, and Cakewalk
T
he most important decision you can make when getting a computer-based
recording system up and going involves choosing which software you want
to use. The software plays an important role in how you do your day-to-day
audio recording work, but it also impacts lots of other facets of your recording
experience — what hardware you can use, the types of recording and editing
you can do, and the number of tracks you can work with, to name just a few.
Understanding how you work and the strengths and weaknesses of the vari-
ous software programs that are on the market can keep you from spending
your money on a program that doesn’t fit your needs.
In this chapter, I help you clarify your needs and goals and offer you an
overview of many of the most common software programs available. I cover
audio and MIDI capabilities, maximum track counts, editing abilities, and the
compatibility of software and hardware, among others. In all, this chapter
helps you easily find the right software and hardware for your needs.
Audio recording software can have many different types of features. Not all
software programs have all the features you want, so you might end up need-
ing to get more than one program to do what you want. This is just one of the
inevitable facts of life. Don’t stick with just one software program that does a
lot of things well and a few things badly; go out and plunk down some cash to
get a program that fills in the holes for you. Almost all programs let you save
your audio files as BWAV (Broadcast Wave) files, so you can freely share files
among programs.

In this chapter, I discuss the different tasks for which you use recording soft-
ware, such as recording, editing, looping, processing, and so on. If any of
these tasks are unfamiliar to you, check out Chapter 6, where I explain these
different areas in detail.
Determining Your Needs
Before you go out and buy a recording program, take a few minutes to clarify
what you need and want in a program. Doing so can save you a ton of hassle
because not all programs are made alike — each program offers different fea-
tures and has its own particular strengths and weaknesses. Knowing your
needs and how they relate to a program’s available features can keep you
from getting the wrong program and having to learn a whole new program
that does meet your needs.
Here are some things to consider before buying any software:
 Setting your budget: Recording software runs from free to over a thou-
sand dollars. That’s quite a range, so narrowing down your budget to,
say, around $100 can weed out a lot of options. When setting your
budget, think about all the aspects of recording that you want to cover
with your system. For example, if you set a budget of $300 for a software
program and also plan on forking over $800 for soft-synths or a hard-
ware synthesizer, getting a program such as Logic Pro — which gives
you both the soft-synths and the recording program in one fell swoop —
might actually put you back less than buying everything separately.
 Examining your musical style: The style of music you make and the way
you work can narrow down your software options. For example, if you
intend to record mostly soft-synths and you do a lot of MIDI work, Pro
Tools wouldn’t be your best choice because it’s more aligned with people
who want to record live instruments and edit and mix audio tracks rather
than MIDI tracks. Plugging in soft-synths and running MIDI-intensive
music isn’t what Pro Tools does best. If this is your desire, you’re better
off with Logic Pro (on a Mac) or SONAR (on a Windows PC).
 Exploring computer platform compatibility: Certain software runs on
only one computer platform. Logic Audio or Digital Performer, for exam-
ple, can only run on a Mac, whereas SONAR requires a Windows machine.
Other software, such as Pro Tools or Cubase, can run equally well on
both platforms. So if you already have a computer or know which type
you intend to get, your choices do narrow down a bit. In the sections
that follow I explain the platform limitations (if any) of each program.
 Exploring hardware compatibility: Some software programs do require
specific hardware in order to run. For example — and this is the most
extreme example — Pro Tools simply won’t run without Digidesign hard-
ware. If you have hardware other than Digidesign, Pro Tools won’t boot
128
Part III: Choosing and Installing Recording Software 

up. In less extreme cases, you might find that certain programs don’t
work very well with certain types of hardware. This is becoming less of
an issue as manufacturers work to keep their products compatible with
other products, but hardware compatibility is something to keep in
mind as you decide on the particulars of your system. Pay special atten-
tion to your hardware’s drivers (the software that comes with your
audio interface hardware) — make sure that the software you intend to
use supports those drivers.
Because there are so many variables in hardware and software, not all
manufacturers of software can test all the hardware variations. The best
thing you can do to ensure that certain hardware works with certain
software is to see whether other users have had success with the combi-
nation. Internet forums are good places to find this information. (Check
out Chapter 20.) The Web site of the hardware and/or software manufac-
turer is another great place to look for compatibility issues. Be sure to
do your footwork before you buy. This action will minimize the chances
of you not being able to get your system working.
 Exploring software compatibility: Many people want to run more than
one audio recording program at a time or they want to use third-party
plug-ins with their main program. If this describes you, make sure you
understand what other software is compatible with your main recording
program. For example, there are several plug-in formats (see Chapter 15),
and each recording program uses one (or sometimes two) of them. So if
you want to use a compressor that is in, say, VST format, you need to
make sure that you get a recording program that supports VST plug-ins.
 Planning for the future: If your budget is limited or you aren’t sure how
deeply you want to get into computer-based recording, you’ll probably
be tempted to get a basic, entry-level recording program to give you a
taste of the process. This is well and good, but I encourage you to think
about the future and choose an entry-level program that has an upgrade
path built in to it. I say this because software makers fashion their pro-
grams with a certain workflow and graphic look, and having to abandon
that workflow and look just because you’ve outgrown a particular soft-
ware version would be a pain.
Need more convincing? If you get used to a program that doesn’t have
an upgrade option, you’ll be forced to learn a new program’s ways of
working, which could take you weeks to figure out. On the other hand, if
you think ahead, you can get into a basic program for very little money
and upgrade to a fuller-feature version of that same program, saving you
the hassle (and headache) of learning a program from scratch. In the fol-
lowing sections, I foster this idea of “planning for the future” by describ-
ing several recording program options for each manufacturer so you can
find an entry-level program that has a simple upgrade path.
129
Chapter 7: Finding the Right Software for You

Tons of audio recording programs are available. Because I believe in being
able to upgrade to a better program as your needs grow, I include only the
most popular programs that have a decent upgrade path. I believe this saves
you money and hassle in the long run. Because developing software is expen-
sive and risky for the manufacturers, buying a product from a company that
has several versions of its program for different users increases the chances
that the software you get good at using is available down the road.
Examining Popular Programs
As you’ll see when you scope out the many (and I mean many; hundreds of
different programs are available) audio recording programs that are out there,
they all offer different features, and each has strengths and weaknesses to
contend with. This section explores the most common programs and gives
you a good sense of what they offer.
Because I can’t possibly cover all the different programs available, I encour-
age you to go online and look for other programs. You might find the perfect
program for you — one that I don’t even list here. (Okay, okay, that’s highly
unlikely given my masterful command of all things audio, but stranger things
have happened.) Also, because space is limited in this chapter, I can’t go into
great depth about the programs I do describe. Before you buy, take some
time to check out the Web sites of the programs that look good to you. There
you can find a much more comprehensive description, some screen shots of
the programs, and more often than not, a free trial download.
If at all possible, try the software you’re interested in before you buy. If you
can’t get your hands on a demo, try to find someone in your area that uses the
program and ask to see it in action. (Many local music stores have demos
ready to go and will walk you through the program.) This is an important step
in the decision-making process because each software program operates differ-
ently and what’s intuitive for one person might be counter-intuitive for another.
A perfect example here is Logic Audio. For whatever reason, some people have
trouble wrapping their puny brains around the way it works, but others find
the way it works completely logical and truly the only intelligent way of ever
doing anything (Sorry, I couldn’t help myself.) Fifteen minutes spent fiddling
around with the various windows is usually enough for many people to get a
grasp of the program and to see whether it makes sense to them.
Pro Tools
Chances are good that you’ve heard of Pro Tools. Pro Tools is the most-used
audio recording program in professional studios. Does this mean it’s the 
best audio program available? Of course not. Pro Tools became the most-used
130
Part III: Choosing and Installing Recording Software 

program because, when it first came out, Digidesign (the maker of Pro Tools)
was one of the first companies to develop hardware that guaranteed a certain
level of stability and performance. The company did this at a price point that
was attractive to commercial studio owners at the time. And the company
had a very good (make that excellent) marketing department.
Pro Tools comes in two versions:
 TDM: Pro Tools TDM uses DSP (digital signal processing) chips that you
install into your computer. These chips run Pro Tools, so your com-
puter’s own CPU never actually does any processing of your audio.
Using DSP chips guarantees certain track and plug-in counts, so TDM is
the version that many commercial studios use. The advantage of this
system was dramatic when computers were slower, but now, for most
people, it’s not needed. The only advantage to TDM now (unless you
record and mix over 100 tracks at a time) is in the quality of some of the
plug-ins you can find, such as equalizers, reverbs, and compressors.
This is because the DSP chips in the TDM system allow for some power-
hungry, great-sounding plug-ins and also because having these plug-ins
run on the DSP chips keeps them from being cracked (counterfeited).
Complete TDM systems start at around $10,000.
 LE: Pro Tools LE is a host-based version of Digidesign’s popular product.
Host-based means that the software runs off your computer’s processor,
so the number of tracks and plug-ins you can have is dictated by the
power of your computer. With the speed of today’s computers Pro Tools
LE is plenty powerful enough for the needs of most recordists.
Unfortunately, Digidesign has chosen to limit the capabilities of Pro Tools
LE by imposing a pretty arbitrary track count limit of 32 audio tracks on
the program. Still, 32 audio tracks is plenty for most people. You can get
an entire LE system for under $500, including both the software and the
audio interface to run it. (Chapter 4 has more on audio interfaces.)
Seeing the strengths of Pro Tools
Pro Tools excels at several things, including
 Audio recording: Pro Tools began its life as a no-frills audio recorder
and editor and was therefore set up with audio recording in mind. The
layout of the interface is similar to that of a tape deck and analog mixing
board, as shown in Figure 7-1 — which means that if you’re an analog
dinosaur and you want to get into digital recording, this interface might
be the easiest for you to get used to. Also, if you plan to record mostly
audio with only the occasional MIDI track to spice things up, this program
might be the easiest way to get started.
 Audio editing: Editing audio is Pro Tool’s strongest suit. With this pro-
gram, you can make even the most exacting edits quickly and accurately.
131
Chapter 7: Finding the Right Software for You

Frankly, editing audio is the only reason I use Pro Tools in my studio. I
record into another program, import the tracks into Pro Tools if they
need editing, edit them there, and import the edited version back into
my other program to mix. As crazy as it might seem, this process saves
me tons of time and makes editing a joy instead of a chore. (It’s “crazy” if
you call using the best tool for the task at hand “crazy,” which, come to
think of it, doesn’t sound that crazy after all.) If you anticipate doing a
lot of audio editing (for example, say you want to create your own per-
sonal loop library), Pro Tools is the best program available.
 Integrated hardware: Pro Tools requires that you use one of Digidesign’s
audio interfaces for it to run. This can be advantageous because you’re
pretty much guaranteed that you won’t run into any hardware problems.
This can offer some peace of mind for people new to digital recording. Of
course, you still need to think about the compatibility of your computer
hardware, but at least by using Pro Tools you can be assured that your
interface will work as advertised. (Chapter 3 has details about computer
hardware compatibility.)
 Compatibility with commercial studios: Most commercial recording
studios use Pro Tools TDM. Because Pro Tools LE is essentially the same
software, you can take your Pro Tools sessions (song files with all the
editing, plug-in, and mixing data added) to a commercial studio to record
without hassle. This means that if you don’t have a good room in which
to record drums, you can go to a studio that has a top-notch drum room
and record your rhythm tracks. You can then go back home and record the
Figure 7-1:
Pro Tools in
all its glory
132
Part III: Choosing and Installing Recording Software 

tracks that you can do well at home. You can also send all your recorded
and edited tracks to a professional mix engineer to mix without having
to convert them. (Check with your mix engineer about this because he
might want you to send him raw data files instead of a Pro Tools session
even if he uses Pro Tools to mix. It’s often easier this way for him.)
Compatibility between different software programs is quickly becoming a non-
issue. Most programs can record in the Broadcast Wave format (BWAV or WAV
extensions). Almost any audio recording program can read Broadcast Wave
format, which means that you can record into one program and import the
audio file into another program to do other work. (See my example in the
“Audio editing” bullet earlier in this section.)
Waking up to Pro Tools weaknesses
Like all audio recording programs, Pro Tools has some areas where it isn’t
perfect. Here are the major issues working against Pro Tools:
 Limited MIDI capabilities: Pro Tools didn’t start with MIDI capabilities
and (unfortunately) the MIDI implementation that got added in to Pro
Tools at a later date is less than optimal for people who use MIDI a lot.
The basic functions are okay if all you want to do is record some MIDI
performances and maybe do some simple editing of it, but if you’re a
MIDI power-user, this isn’t the best program for you. (In this case, look
to Logic or SONAR.)
 Limitations of track counts: Digidesign has put an arbitrary track limita-
tion in Pro Tools LE of 32 voices (mono tracks playing). This means you
can have up to 32 mono tracks or 16 stereo tracks (or any combination
adding up to 32 total voices) playing at one time. For many people, this
track limit doesn’t seem like a, well, limitation because 32 tracks are still
quite a bit for a home recordist.
 No plug-in delay compensation: Most of the other professional-level
programs, such as Digital Performer, Logic, and SONAR, automatically
compensate for the delay that’s introduced in a track by a plug-in
(Chapter 15 has more about this feature), but so far Pro Tools (currently
up to version 6.7) doesn’t. This can be a big deal for some users depend-
ing on their choice and use of plug-ins, so be aware that this is an area
that Digidesign doesn’t see as a priority.
 No hardware choice: If you use Pro Tools, you’re stuck with Digidesign’s
hardware. This has its advantages (as I describe in the preceding section)
but the downside is that you’re left without a choice in the matter. It’s
generally accepted that Digidesign’s interfaces for Pro Tools LE aren’t
the best quality you can find, so if you want the best possible sound
from your system and you want to use Pro Tools software, you need to
shell out for some external preamps and converters (which is what I did).
This will cost you quite a bit more than if you just bought the high-quality
components, so factor the external preamps and converters into the
cost of your system.
133
Chapter 7: Finding the Right Software for You

In reality, the sound quality of Digidesign hardware is plenty good enough for
most home recordists starting out and isn’t that much different than the qual-
ity of any of the all-in-one audio interfaces. (See Chapter 4 for more on inter-
faces.) More important than the sound quality of any Digidesign hardware are
your skills as a recordist. So if you want to go the Pro Tools route, you don’t
have to get external devices to record music that sounds pretty darn good.

has all the available product information as well as the DUC (Digidesign Users
Conference) forum for Pro Tools users.
ACID
Produced by Sony Media Software (and originally created by Sonic Foundry),
ACID is the most popular loop-based recording program. (See Chapter 12 for
more on looping.) ACID and similar loop-based programs use pre-recorded
musical snippets that you can manipulate a number of ways to create your
musical compositions. ACID is available for Windows PC only and comes in
three iterations:
 ACID Xpress: This is a free version of ACID and as such is a very limited
edition compared to the other versions. ACID Xpress has a limit of 10
tracks and supports only 16-bit recording. Both these limitations make it
a less-than-ideal choice for any professional work. Still, it’s a great way
to get an idea of how ACID works for free.
 ACID Music Studio: The next step up, ACID Music Studio, is a much
more featured program than ACID Xpress. Even though it adds a lot of
functionality, it’s still handicapped by being limited to working at a bit
depth of 16 bits. This makes it unsuitable for professional work.
 ACID Pro: ACID Pro is the flagship looping program. ACID Pro has tons
of great features and is used by many professionals who create their
music in a loop-based format and extends the bit rate to the current
industry standard of 24 bits. ACID doesn’t limit the number of tracks you
can record and mix, so the sky (and your computer) is the limit here.
This style of working is commonly used for musical genres such as hip-
hop and techno.
Examining the advantages
ACID has some real advantages for some composers. These include:
134
Part III: Choosing and Installing Recording Software 

 Loop-based recording: For many composers, working with loops makes
creating music easy. Because the loops contain audio that sounds good
right from the start, you don’t need to learn basic recording skills to
start making music. You don’t even need to learn how to play an instru-
ment very well. For artists whose goal is to quickly create “listenable”
music, this can be a real asset.
 Huge number of loop libraries: Because ACID was the first powerful
and successful loop-based program, it has had the time and money to
develop an extensive loop library. These loops can be used in most loop-
based programs, so you’re not restricted to using ACID in order to bene-
fit from this library. Still, because they were developed for ACID, it puts
ACID at an advantage overall.
 Powerful loop-manipulation functions: ACID lets you do some pretty
cool things with loops. Like all loop-based programs, you can speed up
or slow down the loops, but beyond that you can customize the loop’s
sound in your songs in ways that many other programs don’t allow. For
example, ACID offers a sophisticated groove mapping function that lets
you apply different groove templates (timing maps) to your loops quickly
and easily. It also lets you extract the timing from a loop and apply it to 
a different loop and lets you manipulate your groove templates in many
different ways.
Detailing the disadvantages
For all the advantages that ACID has, you should be aware of some disadvan-
tages if you’re considering using this program. These include:
 Windows PC only: If you’re a Mac user, you can’t use this program
(unless, of course, you buy a Windows PC).
 Loop-based: I include this feature in both the Advantages as well as 
the Disadvantages list because if you aren’t interested in working with
loops, many of the features in this program are useless to you. If you’re
more interested in recording and editing audio and MIDI, you have many
more appropriate choices.
 Limited audio and MIDI functionality: Don’t get me wrong — you can
record and edit audio and MIDI by using ACID, but because most of the
focus for this program is on loops, audio and MIDI functions take a back
seat. Such functions are clearly best done in other programs — programs
whose strong suit is audio or MIDI (or both like Logic and SONAR).

information and downloads (both free versions and demos) on its products
including ACID. The site also has a user forum.

Chapter 7: Finding the Right Software for You

Cubase
Cubase is made by Steinberg and is one of the most popular audio and MIDI
recording programs available. Cubase has been around for a while and is used
by many hobbyists and professionals. This program runs on Windows PCs as
well as Macs, although it’s been historically more stable on Windows PCs.
Cubase comes in several versions. These include
 Cubase LE: This is the entry-level offering. As with all entry-level prod-
ucts, it has its limitations. These include maximum tracks counts (48
audio and 64 MIDI), a limited number of physical inputs and outputs (4),
a limited number of inserts (2), and others. The one area that Steinberg
doesn’t limit their entry-level version is in bit depth. With this low-cost
version, you can record in 24 bits.
 Cubase SE: As you might expect, Cubase SE is a step up from the LE edi-
tion. Cubase SE still has limitations, but they are markedly fewer than
what you find in LE. In this version, you can have 48 audio tracks and an
unlimited number of MIDI tracks. You also get more inputs and outputs
(eight) and more inserts (five), among other extras. This is a decent
starter program if your needs are modest.
 Cubase SL: Stepping up to Cubase SL adds a lot of functions that you
don’t get in the slimmer versions. In this version, you have an unlimited
number of both audio and MIDI tracks at your disposal and you can have
up to 128 physical inputs and outputs, more than enough for most users.
You also get improvements such as an unlimited Undo feature, an addi-
tional Mix window, and many others.
 Cubase SX: This is Steinberg’s top Cubase option. You are going to find
all the basics here in spades, but you also find functions that professional
users need, such as improved automation functions, surround mixing,
beefed-up mixing and editing capabilities, and video functions. This is a
top-notch professional product.
Cubase: What works well
Cubase is a great program that clearly has some areas where it excels. These
include:
 Cross-platform capabilities: Cubase can work on both Windows PCs and
Macs. It seems that the Windows version is still more stable, but I don’t
hear a lot of complaints about the Mac version, either. This is one of the
few programs that is truly cross platform.
 MIDI integration: The MIDI functionality of Cubase is very good. It ranks
between Sonar and Logic (on the excellent end) and Pro Tools (on the no-
frills but functional end). Working with soft-synths and MIDI instruments
136
Part III: Choosing and Installing Recording Software 

is easy, and you have a lot of flexibility in how you can work. This is a
good program for anyone who’s looking for a decent blend between
audio and MIDI capabilities.
 Easy to get started on: I found that Cubase was easy to get going on
when I first tried it out. Its layout is logical, and the functions are rela-
tively easy to grasp. (Actually, the look of the layout drives me nuts. See
the following section.) Cubase is a good program for people who aren’t
well-versed in computer-based recording and want to get going rela-
tively painlessly. In addition, the introductory versions record in 24 bit
so they tend to stand out in my mind as decent beginner applications
because you can get decent raw tracks to import into full-function pro-
grams later on.
Cubase: What doesn’t work well
Like all audio recording programs, Cubase ain’t perfect. Here are some areas
where it isn’t the top contender:
 Cluttered interface: Call this a personal problem, but I find the visual
look of Cubase to be cluttered and distracting. It might be because of the
relatively little time I spend using it compared to some other programs,
so take a gander at it for yourself to see whether you like the way it
looks. Even though the look of a piece of software doesn’t affect its func-
tionality, you spend a lot of time looking at a program’s windows,
palettes and menus when you work. If you find a program distracting to
look at, it makes getting work down more difficult.
 Audio editing: Audio editing in Cubase leaves a bit to be desired. It
seems to me that Steinberg might have intentionally chosen to leave this
an area where Cubase lacks functionality, given that the audio editing
capabilities in one of its other programs, Nuendo, is far superior. So,
they know how to do it well, they just chose not to do it well in Cubase.
This might not be a big deal for the users out there who just want to do
some basic editing, but if audio editing is a priority for you, consider
trying some other programs in addition to (or instead of) Cubase before
you settle for Cubase.
 Automation: The automation in Cubase isn’t up to the same standard as
some of the other audio recording programs. (Logic would be a good
example here.) Because most people record within the computer,
automation is an important part of the mixing process, and the limited
automation features in Cubase can slow you down a bit. However, I do
expect Steinberg to improve on its automation features soon — soothe
Steinberg folks have received too many complaints to ignore. Keep an
eye on future versions of Cubase for these improvements. (Version 5 is
current as of the writing of this book.)

Cakewalk
Cakewalk makes several different recording programs. These are divided into
the home recoding and professional lines. The home studio line includes
these popular products:
 Guitar Tracks Pro: As its name suggests, Guitar Tracks Pro is geared
toward guitar players and focuses on audio rather than MIDI or a combi-
nation of the two. This program has a track limit of 32. On the plus side,
it records at 24 bits and lets you record in file formats that you can always
import into a more feature-rich program later if you want. It also sup-
ports using loops. (Figure 7-2 gives you a look at Guitar Tracks Pro.)
 Home Studio 2: This is a MIDI, loop, and audio recording program 
that records at 24 bits. This is a decent basic system for people just 
getting into home recording because it gives you an unlimited number 
of audio and MIDI tracks. There is an XL version that adds some soft-
synths and effects.
 Music Creator Pro: This program is a step up in features from the 
Home Studio 2 version. The 24-bit recording and unlimited tracks in 
conjunction with loop-based composition tools make this a fairly full-
featured program.
Cakewalk plusses
The Cakewalk home studio programs excel in certain areas including
 Easy to use: The Cakewalk programs are designed with the beginner in
mind, and so they’re easy to understand, and getting some recording
done quickly is a snap.
 Inexpensive: The programs are relatively inexpensive for the features
they offer, and they’re a good value for the home recordists who are just
getting started.
Cakewalk minuses
Programs made by Cakewalk are designed for people starting out and can’t
really be compared with powerhouse programs such as Pro Tools, Logic,
Digital Performer, and SONAR. But even when you compare Cakewalk pro-
grams with its basic home recording program peers, it could still stand to
improve in some areas, including

Part III: Choosing and Installing Recording Software 

 Limited editing functions: Although you can edit both audio and MIDI in
these programs (except Guitar Tracks Pro, which doesn’t have MIDI
capabilities), you’re limited at what you can do and how quickly you can
do it. In all honesty, though, for the price you really can’t expect the
power of some of the other programs.
 Scaled-down user interface: These programs don’t offer much in the
line of windows in which to work. Don’t get me wrong, you can do all
you need to with the windows, but certain windows, such as the MIDI
piano roll window, make working with Cakewalk programs less than ideal.

SONAR
Although SONAR is a Cakewalk program and could easily be put in the
Cakewalk section in this chapter, I separated SONAR from the other Cakewalk

Chapter 7: Finding the Right Software for You

offerings because it’s in a different league. Unlike Guitar Tracks Pro, Home
Studio 2, and Music Creator Pro, SONAR is a full-featured professional pro-
gram set that competes with the other heavy-hitters such as Pro Tools, Logic,
and Cubase.
SONAR comes in two configurations:
 SONAR Studio Edition: SONAR is an audio and MIDI program that also
supports loops. This program is on par with the other professional-level
programs such as Logic, Digital Performer, Cubase, Pro Tools, and
Nuendo. SONAR Studio Edition offers unlimited audio and MIDI tracks.
 SONAR Producer Edition: This edition of Sonar is essentially the same
as the SONAR Studio Edition except that it adds some functions such as
improved surround sound support, more plug-ins, and an enhanced
mixing environment, a shown in Figure 7-3.
Examining SONAR’s strengths
SONAR is a top-notch program that has some definite strengths. These
include
Figure7-3:

Part III: Choosing and Installing Recording Software 

 Plug-in delay compensation: This is an important feature for people who
use a lot of plug-ins on their tracks because the program automatically
compensates for any delay that is introduced by processing the plug-in.
 Looping: Even though all the better (and beyond) programs have loop-
ing functions, SONAR’s loop manipulation abilities are on par with ACID,
the “Loop Master” program.
 Freeze function: Logic started the freeze function trend (and I’m glad
Logic did so — it’s a great feature), and SONAR has included it as well.
The freeze function lets you apply the plug-ins you’ve assigned to a track
(you create a new file with the plug-in applied to the track) and play it
back without having to process the plug-in while the song plays. This
function is handy if you have lots of tracks with plug-ins and you want to
take the stress off your system. SONAR makes this process easy.
SONAR weaknesses: The gory details
Some parts of SONAR could be improved upon, including:
 Windows PC only: Sorry Mac users, SONAR is available only for
Windows PCs. I wouldn’t expect this to change, so if you’re a Mac 
user. I recommend trying Logic.
 Not very customizable: This is a key feature if you spend a lot of time
recording (or plan to). SONAR still isn’t where some of the other pro-
grams are in this regard. (Logic and Nuendo, for example, are markedly
better in this regard.)
 Audio editing: Because I’ve complained about the audio editing capabil-
ities (or workflow styles, anyway) of many of the programs that I list in
this chapter, I have to be consistent and say that SONAR is no better. In
fact, in some ways SONAR is behind most of the other programs when it
comes to audio editing. If extensive audio editing is a top priority for
you, you may want to look at Pro Tools or Nuendo.
 File management: Managing your files in SONAR is definitely harder than
in programs such as Pro Tools and Logic. This can be a time-suck for
people who do a lot of recording or who share audio clips between songs.

walk.com/professionals.asp. This site also has an excellent user forum.
Logic
Logic is one of the most-used and most powerful audio/MIDI recording pro-
grams available. Logic has been around for quite a while; it started out as
Emagic’s baby, but has since been bought by Apple. Logic is available in 
two forms:
141
Chapter 7: Finding the Right Software for You

 Logic Express: Logic Express is the introductory version of Logic. It has
many of the functions of Logic Pro except for a couple of very important
distinctions — at least they’re important for professional users. First,
Logic Express doesn’t support Broadcast Wave or AIFF file types, which
means you can’t import or export files from and to other programs.
(Importing into Logic Pro is no problem.) Second, it has a limit of 12
hardware inputs. On the other hand, Logic Express does record 24-bit
files, so you can record high-quality tracks in this program and easily
upgrade to Logic Pro later on if you want.
 Logic Pro: Logic Pro is one of the most feature-rich programs available.
With Logic Pro, you have unlimited tracks and hardware inputs, awe-
some automation, MIDI, and software synthesizer features (including
many included soft-synths). This is one of the top professional recording
programs and is used by many commercial studios and professional
composers.
Logic: The strengths
Logic is a powerful program that offers some great features. Some of the most
important are
 Extensive MIDI capabilities: Logic started out as a MIDI sequencing/
editing program. As a result, it has functions that many of the other pro-
grams don’t have. Because of this, working with MIDI is a joy in Logic, as
is working with software synthesizers. (See the “Soft-synth support”
bullet in this list.) If MIDI is high on your list of functions, you have to
give Logic a try. (If you use a Mac, see the following section.)
 User flexibility: Logic is a powerhouse of a program. One of the big
advantages for some users is the ability to customize your working envi-
ronment to your needs. (Such flexibility is also a hindrance for some
users — see the following section.) Being able to make these customiza-
tions can save power-users a boatload of time. (Need I say that this is
one of the things I love about this program?)
 Soft-synth support: Logic is one of the best programs out there for using
software synthesizers. Plugging in soft-synths and actually using them is
easy with this program. In addition, Logic Pro ships with a ton of really
good software synthesizers and samplers, which can save you a lot of
money. If you intend to use soft-synths in your music, definitely check
out this program.
 Freeze function: The freeze function allows you to freeze a track with its
plug-ins. This is a quick way to create a new file of your track with its plug-
ins recorded to it so that your system isn’t processing the plug-in in real
time. This takes a lot of strain off your system, especially if you use several
plug-ins and have numerous tracks in your mixes. This function was intro-
duced by Logic and quickly copied by a bunch of other programs because
it started to level the playing field between host-based recording systems
(such as Pro Tools TDM) that have their own processors and native
recording systems (ones that use the computer’s processor to function).
142
Part III: Choosing and Installing Recording Software 

 Linking computers: As of version 7, Logic added the ability to link more
than one computer together to share the processing burden among them.
This allows you to have more plug-in and soft-synths happening before
your system starts to bog down. Other program designers had tried to
add this feature before, but they never made it stable or easy to use.
Apple seems to have done this, and the ability (currently) puts Logic
above all the other native systems for people who need lots of power.
 Tight integration with Mac OS: As of version 6, Logic is owned by
Apple. This means that, as the program develops further, you can be
assured that it will be as tightly integrated into the Mac OS as any pro-
gram can be. This translates into more available power, unique features
tied to the OS, and improved stability. (Not that Logic is unstable now; 
in fact, it’s very stable, but so are most programs.)
Logic: The weaknesses
On the flip side, Logic has some limitations for some users. These include
 Mac only: Windows PC users can’t use the latest versions of Logic 
(versions 6 and up). Earlier versions (5 and down) were supported for
Windows PCs, so if you don’t need the latest features, you could go with
an older version of Logic. This isn’t something I’d recommend because
the features introduced since version 5 are the ones that set Logic apart
from many of the other programs.
 Cumbersome audio editing: By cumbersome, I mean that it just can’t
compete with Pro Tools when it comes to audio editing flexibility. This
doesn’t mean that it won’t do the job or that it doesn’t do it well; it’s just
that, when compared to the superb audio editing capabilities of Pro
Tools, Logic is harder to work with. If intricate editing of your audio is a
priority for you, I recommend that you try Logic for yourself to see
whether you can work it the way you want to — and while you’re at it,
try Pro Tools if possible so that you can compare it with Logic.
 The Environment: Logic uses a concept called the Environment to work
in. Basically, the Environment is a display feature that allows you to cus-
tomize your working environment in an almost unlimited number of
ways. As you might imagine, it’s a unique way of working that takes some
people some time to get a handle on. Many people don’t take the time to
learn how to use the Environment effectively and walk away in disgust
with this program. I included the user flexibility of the Environment in
the Advantages list, too, because when you get it figured out you’re able
to harness the awesome power of this program. If at first glance the
Environment is confusing to you, I recommend finding someone in your
area who’s well-versed in Logic to get you going with it or try one of the
excellent resources offered for this program. (Check out the Apple Web
site for one such resource.)

Digital Performer
Digital Performer (shown in Figure 7-4) is made by MOTU (Mark of the
Unicorn), the people who make the MOTU audio and MIDI interfaces. Digital
Performer is a full-featured program for Macs that does both audio and MIDI
well. Digital Performer is available in only one edition, but MOTU includes 
a distant cousin (and extremely stripped-down) version called Audio Desk
with its interfaces. You can upgrade to Digital Performer (DP) for just a few
hundred dollars.
Surveying DP’s strengths
Digital Performer is a solid program that offers the following strengths:
Figure 7-4:
Digital
Performer
piles on the
features.
144
Part III: Choosing and Installing Recording Software 

 Tight hardware integration: MOTU makes audio interfaces as well as
the Digital Performer software program. As a result, its hardware and
software products work well together. Even though most programs have
solid hardware support, having one manufacturer make both hardware
and software reduces the possibility of compatibility issues.
 MIDI capabilities: MIDI is one of the areas where DP excels. If you do a
lot of MIDI recording and, more importantly, editing, you’ll find that
Digital Performer offers plenty of functions that make working with MIDI
easy and fast.
 Soft-synth support: DP, like Logic, is a soft-synth users dream.
Incorporating software synthesizers into your song is simple. (In addition,
MOTU makes some decent software synthesizers such as the sampler
MachFive.)
 Customization: DP can be customized for your working style. As far as
I’m concerned, for people who do a lot of recording this is undoubtedly
one of the most important functions of an audio recording program. By
being able to customize your working environment, you can save your-
self quite a bit of time performing the tasks that you do often.
Exploring DP’s weaknesses
Digital Performer has some areas where it could be improved on. (But don’t
we all?). These include:
 Mac only: Digital Performer is limited to Mac users only. This program
has never been available for Windows PC users, and there’s no plan to
expand beyond Macintosh computers.
 Audio editing: Compared to Pro Tools and Nuendo, Digital Performer is
weak when it comes to audio editing. As was the case with Logic, DP’s
audio editing capabilities do exist, but performing tight edits takes time.
If it turns out that you do only an occasional intense edit (for example,
cutting a single drum hit in a track with a complex part), you’ll do fine
with DP, but if you intend to do a lot of this type of edit, you might be
better off using Pro Tools or Nuendo.
 Cluttered interface: Digital Performer has a lot of eye candy. This might
look nice to some people, but it creates a couple of potential problems:
It can slow down your system and it can cause you to divert your atten-
tion from what your music sounds like to what it looks like.

Chapter 7: Finding the Right Software for You

Nuendo
Nuendo is made by Steinberg, the maker of Cubase. Nuendo is designed and
marketed as a media production program and is used most often by people in
post-production sound design. Nuendo is available only in one edition. This
line has no entry-level products; only the top-of-the-line version is available
(which I guess would make it the only-one-in-the-line version).
Surveying Nuendo’s strengths
Nuendo is becoming the professional’s choice for post-production work. It
handles audio beautifully. Here are some of its strengths:
 Audio editing: Nuendo rivals Pro Tools in the audio editing department.
Although it works differently, Nuendo does many of the same basic func-
tions, so you can swiftly make intricate audio edits. If you intend to do a
lot of audio editing, this program is definitely worth looking at.
 Customization: Nuendo, like Logic, offers users considerable flexibility
in how the program looks and functions. Being able to customize your
working environment is important to working quickly. If you like being
able to tweak your settings, you might like working in Nuendo.
 Network linking: Nuendo, like Logic, offers the ability to link more than
one computer together. This lets you share the processing duties between
two computers. Even though it came up with this function before Logic,
getting it working in Nuendo isn’t as easy or intuitive (to me anyway).
Still, this ability can make complex songs easier to work with (assuming
you have more than one computer).
 Surround mixing: For surround mixing, Nuendo is great. Surround
mixing lets you place the tracks in your mix in a variety of locations
beyond just the left and right possible with stereo mixing. Surround
mixing isn’t common yet for music, but it’s necessary if you work on
video. Nuendo version 3 adds quite a few enhancements over previous
versions, so Steinberg has clearly made surround mixing a priority for
this program. You can expect this strength to be amplified in future 
versions. If you want to mix for film, this program is one of the best 
(also check out Logic if you use a Mac).
 Cross platform: Nuendo works on both Macs and Windows PCs. Most
power-users are using Windows PCs when they work in Nuendo. I’ve
heard of complaints about stability on Macs in version 2. Given the
number of complaints and the cost of the program, I expect that
Steinberg fixed this for version 3 (which hasn’t yet been released as I
write this section).
146
Part III: Choosing and Installing Recording Software 

Exploring Nuendo’s weaknesses
Nuendo has some weaknesses. These include
 Limited MIDI capabilities: Like Pro Tools, Nuendo doesn’t have the best
MIDI implementation. Because it’s designed as a post-production program,
Steinberg assumes that MIDI isn’t a priority for its users, so it hasn’t
endowed this program with the kind of MIDI capability that you find in
programs such as Logic or SONAR. So if you want to do any MIDI work,
you’re better of with a different program.
 Expensive: Nuendo retails for $2,000. This is more than double the price
of many of the other professional-level audio recording programs. The
reason this is the case is a mystery, but that’s the reality. If you want to
focus your work on film-based post-production, the cost shouldn’t be a
deterrent, but for basic audio recording (which is where this program
excels) you can find other options for less that work just as well.

Installing Your Software

I
nstalling recording software is pretty much the same as installing any other
type of program on your system. The only difference is in how you get your
system ready for the software installation. Without optimizing your system
settings — getting it so that it can deal with the high demands that come with
audio recording — you can run into problems down the line with audio
dropouts (silences), clicks and pops, and limited track and plug-in counts.
In this chapter, I guide you through the process of getting your system ready
and optimizing your operating system’s settings to ensure (as much as possi-
ble, anyway) that your system will be stable and will perform at its best. Just so
you know that I’m not necessarily choosing sides in the platform wars, I go out
of my way in this chapter to take you step by step through both a Macintosh
OS X and a Windows XP system.
Getting Ready to Install
Before you install your audio programs, you really need to do a few things to
make the process quick and easy. These are:
 Update your system software to the most recent version. This doesn’t
necessarily mean buying the most current version available (though this
is often a very good idea); instead, it means that you download and install
the most recent iteration of the version you have. For example, if you have
Mac OS 10.2.1 on your computer, an update is definitely in order.
 Check the documentation on the packaging of the recording software
you intend to install. There might be restrictions on what operating
system versions you can use. For example, Pro Tools 6.3 won’t work
with Mac OS 10.2 — it needs at least version 10.3. In this case, you might

need to upgrade your OS version. Be sure to check the documentation on
the side of the box before you buy your recording software and budget in
the OS upgrade if necessary. Trust me on this one: It’s a bummer to have
a program you can’t install until you get other software installed first.
 Make sure your hardware is up to snuff. Check with the manufacturer
of your software to make sure that your computer and audio interface
components are compatible with the program. Depending on the age and
composition of your computer, you might need to make some upgrades.
Chapter 3 discusses the whole hardware upgrade issue in greater detail.
 Get the drivers for your audio interface ready. You’re going to install
your audio interface drivers before you install the audio program itself,
so have the discs with the drivers ready. (I cover the actual process of
installing these drivers later in the PC and Mac sections.)
 Reboot your computer. You want to install the programs from a fresh
boot, so if you’ve been doing other tasks on your computer, turn it off
first. When it’s booted up, you can move on to the steps that I list in the
next section.
After you take care of the stuff that I list here, you’re ready to move on to
configuring your operating system and installing your programs. If you use a
Windows PC, go to the next section. If you use a Mac, skip to the Mac section
later in this chapter.
Putting Software on a Windows XP PC
Getting your PC ready to face any and all audio recording tasks will take you
a few minutes, but it’s well worth your time because it makes your system
both more stable and more efficient. In this section, I cover some basic things
to keep in mind when you’re configuring (or purchasing) a PC system for use
with audio recording software programs.
Configuring the Windows XP 
operating system
Before you can actually install your audio recording software, you need to get
your system configured for it. This section describes the procedures and
helps you make sure that your system will run trouble-free (at least as much
as can be expected).
150
Part III: Choosing and Installing Recording Software 

After you make all the adjustments in this section, you need to reboot your
computer for them to take affect.
Windows settings
Although for the most part you can run almost any audio program just fine
on a standard Windows XP configuration, a few system adjustments will free
up system resources, allowing more of your computer system’s power to be
available for use by your music programs. This is important because almost
all the audio programs that you could possibly install on your computer are
designed to transform your system into a native DAW (Digital Audio
Workstation) — one that relies solely on the host computer’s processing
power with no additional DSP (digital signal processor) cards for support.
(The exceptions that prove the rule are the Pro Tools TDM systems, which
have their own computer chips to take the load off your computer; you can
see Chapter 7 for more on this particular animal.) Some of the adjustments I
recommend here — such as enabling direct memory access (DMA) for all
your IDE hard drives — are crucial for running audio programs successfully.
The sections that follow lay out the basic system settings that I recommend.
Windows XP Classic mode
You can accomplish the same basic housekeeping and setup tasks in
Windows XP in many ways. Because I don’t know how your system is set up
right now, I lead you through the process from square one. The first thing you
want to do is set your system display — the way stuff looks on-screen — to
Windows Classic mode. Here’s how:
1. Choose Start➪Settings➪Control Panel. 
The contents of the Control Panel folder appear on-screen.
2. Double-click the Display icon.
The Display Properties dialog box appears.
3. Select the Themes tab and then select Windows Classic from the
Theme drop-down list, as shown in Figure 8-1. 
This resets your system to its classic theme and disables your active
desktop setup.
4. Click the Apply button.

5. Select the Desktop tab and then select None from the Background list
box, as shown in Figure 8-2.

This procedure disables the active desktop in Windows, which might free up
some valuable system resources depending on how your system was set up
to begin with.

Choosing Control Panel settings
Windows XP is remarkably stable, but for those rare times when it (or a pro-
gram running under Windows) crashes, it generates an error report and asks
whether you want to send the report to Microsoft. This feature, called Error
Reporting, takes system resources to run — and because you’d rather have
those resources working hard to keep your recording software running
smoothly, you need to disable Error Reporting. Here’s the drill:
1. Choose Start➪Settings➪Control Panel.
The contents of the Control Panel folder appear on-screen.
2. Double-click the System icon.
The System Properties dialog box appears.
3. Select the Advanced tab.
4. Click the Error Reporting button. 
The Error Reporting dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 8-3.

Congratulations! You’ve just configured your system settings.
Enabling DMA
All IDE hard drives on your system must have DMA (direct memory access)
enabled before your recording program can effectively write and read data to
and from your hard drives. This takes the central processing unit (CPU) out
of the process and improves the transfer of data from your RAM to your hard
drive. To enable DMA, do the following:
1. Right-click the My Computer icon on the Windows desktop.
2. From the contextual menu that appears, choose Properties to access
the Properties dialog box, and then click the Hardware tab.
3. On the Hardware tab of the Properties dialog box, click the Device
Manager button.
4. In the Device Manager dialog box, double click the IDE ATA/ATAPI
Controllers branch of the navigation tree.
The navigation tree expands to show the controllers associated with
your system.
5. From the listing, double click the Primary IDE Controller branch and
select the Advanced Settings tab.
If it doesn’t already say DMA If Available under the Transfer Mode
option, change it so that it does. If you have several disk drives on your
system, you have to do the same for each drive.
6. Click OK and repeat the same steps for the Secondary IDE controller.
It’s in the Device Manager navigation tree, directly below the Primary
controller.
Disabling AutoPlay
AutoPlay is a feature of Windows XP that automatically runs certain programs
or plays music on a CD when you insert it into your computer’s CD drive. This
is a handy feature in everyday life, but can cause problems with audio record-
ing software because resources are used in your computer to run this feature,
which can slow your system down. In addition, AutoPlay has been known to
cause glitches in audio recording or playback on some systems. For the sake of
your music, disable AutoPlay for all CD drives on your system. Here’s the drill:

Chapter 8: Installing Your Software

1. Double click the My Computer icon on the Windows desktop.
The My Computer window duly appears.
2. In the My Computer window, right-click the icon for your CD drive.
3. From the contextual menu that appears, select Properties to access
the Properties dialog box and then select the AutoPlay tab.
4. On the AutoPlay tab, select Music Files from the Select Content Type
drop-down list.
5. At the bottom of the Properties dialog box, select the Prompt Me Each
Time to Choose an Action option.
6. Repeat Steps 4 and 5 with the Pictures, Video Files, Mixed Content,
Music CD, and Blank CD options for the Select Content Type drop-
down list.
7. Click OK.
8. Repeat Steps 2 through 7 for each CD or DVD drive on your computer.
Disabling virus protection
Virus protection is an important thing to have on any computer that con-
nects to the Internet, but virus protection can also adversely affect audio
recording performance. Ideally, your computer would be dedicated to record-
ing, editing, and mixing your music. However, you will likely be using an all-
purpose computer that you will use for many tasks, such as surfing the Web
for business, pleasure, and/or helping with your children’s homework. In that
case, be sure to turn off your virus protection whenever you’re running any
audio recording program. Check with the documentation that came with your
virus-protection software for the best way to do this. (And don’t forget to 
re-enable virus protection before you log on to the Internet again.)
I hate to repeat myself, but I will: If you’re really serious about having a
bulletproof system, try to keep any extra software (such as games, finance,
publishing, graphics, and so on) off your audio computer. At the very least,
keep all other applications closed while you work on your music.
Connecting your hardware
When you have your system fine-tuned (which I cover in the previous section),
you can connect your hardware. Shut down your computer and do what needs
to be done to connect your audio interface. (Not sure what needs to be done?
Each piece of hardware has its own installation procedure, as spelled out in
it’s accompanying manual, but I do give you some general guidelines in
Chapter 5.) When you have the hardware connected, turn on your computer.
158
Part III: Choosing and Installing Recording Software 

Then, after the Windows desktop appears, turn on the power to your audio
interface. (If you’re using a product that doesn’t have a power switch, you can
obviously ignore this particular step.)
On Windows PCs, it’s important to wait to install any software until after
you’ve attached your hardware, and, if needed, powered it on. The complete
details for attaching hardware are located in Chapter 5.
Installing your software
After you complete the Windows system-setup adjustments that I list in ear-
lier sections, you can install your audio program. You need to check the doc-
umentation that came with your software for the specific procedure, but
most software installations work pretty much the same way. With that in
mind, here’s a rundown on the steps involved when installing Pro Tools, one
of the more popular audio programs out there. As you can see, it’s pretty
simple. Just follow these steps:
1. Connect your interface to your computer.
As I explain in Chapters 5 and 7, Pro Tools runs only with Digidesign
hardware, so your interface of choice had better be a Digidesign model.
If you have a 002 or 002 Rack, this means connecting the FireWire cable,
whereas the Mbox requires a USB connection, and the 001 requires plug-
ging in the PCI card into an open PCI slot and making the connection
between the PCI card and the break-out box — the rest of the 001 system.
2. Boot up your PC.
The Windows desktop appears.
3. If your Digidesign interface has a separate power switch, this is the
time to turn on the interface.
If it doesn’t have a separate power switch, jump right to Step 4.
4. Insert the Pro Tools software CD in your computer’s CD drive.
5. Double-click the My Computer icon on the Windows desktop.
The My Computer window appears.
6. In the My Computer window, double-click the icon for your CD drive.
The contents of the CD are displayed in a new window.
7. Double click the Pro Tools LE Installer folder.
The contents of the Pro Tools LE Installer folder are displayed for all 
to see.
8. Double-click the Setup icon.
159
Chapter 8: Installing Your Software

9. After the Installer dialog box appears, click Next to continue.
10. Accept the default paths for installation — they’re fine, and it’s less
hassle — and then click the Install button.
11. Wait for the installation to complete.
12. Restart your computer.
Installing Software on a Mac
Getting up and going on a Mac is easy. When you have a computer that has the
right specs (I spell out specs in Chapter 3), it will take you less than 15 minutes
to be ready to plug in your hardware (Chapter 5 covers this) and start record-
ing (as Chapter 10 details). This section takes you through, step by step, the
process of turning your Mac into a lean, mean, audio recording machine.
Recording, editing, and mixing audio on a computer takes a toll on your
system’s resources. The best (and time-tested) way to ensure that you have
as few problems as possible is to keep your computer lean by dedicating it to
audio only. Use a different computer for all your other chores such as home
finance, word processing, or games. If you have only one computer, I strongly
suggest that you keep all other applications turned off while you record.
That said, I’m going to contradict myself and tell you that I’ve done a lot of
testing by using audio programs on different Mac computers with OS X and
my experience is that it’s a very robust operating system that seems to
handle having more than just audio on the computer. In fact, I’ve successfully
run an Internet browser while downloading music, a graphics program, a
photo-editing program, a word processor, and an e-mail program while mixing
8 tracks of audio and didn’t have any problems. I don’t recommend that you
have these other programs on while you work, but my experience is that OS X
seems to be up to the task of at least having other programs on your system.
If you decide to use your everyday computer for recording audio, use a dedi-
cated hard drive for the audio data and defragment it frequently. Also, don’t
put any other data on this drive — ever. If your system gets sluggish and you
start to experience audio clicks, pops, or dropouts, it’s time to defragment
your drive.
Setting system settings
Before you install any audio recording software, check to make sure that you
have the latest version of OS X. (Also check your software manufacturer’s
Web site to make sure the latest version of OS X is supported.) Then follow
these steps to prepare your system for the software installation:
160
Part III: Choosing and Installing Recording Software 

1. Log on to your computer by using an administration account.
Your OS X documentation spells out this procedure for you.
2. Choose Apple➪System Preferences, as shown in Figure 8-8.
The System Preferences dialog box appears.
3. Under the Hardware Options, click the Energy Saver icon.
A new dialog box opens.
4. Under the Sleep tab, slide the slider for Put the Computer To Sleep
When It Is Inactive For option over to Never, as in Figure 8-9.
This keeps your computer from shutting down if you record a long song
because you don’t touch any keys while recording.

5. Leave the Put the Hard Disk to Sleep When Possible option deselected.
This keeps your computer from going to sleep during long sessions.
6. Go back to the main Systems Preferences dialog box by pressing the
Show All button in the upper-left corner of the dialog box.
7. Select Software Update from the System options at the bottom of the
dialog box.
8. When the new Software Update dialog box opens, deselect the
Automatically Check for Updates When You Have a Network
Connection option, as shown in Figure 8-10.
This keeps your system from dedicating resources to look for and 
download software updates.
9. Close the dialog box by clicking the red button in the upper-left
corner of the dialog box.
Installing your software
After you complete the system-setup requirements in the preceding section,
you can install your audio program. You need to check the documentation
that came with your software for the specific procedure, but most software
installations work pretty much the same way. I highlight the Pro Tools soft-
ware program as an example of a Windows-base software program earlier in
this chapter, so for the sake of consistency I’m sticking with Pro Tools for the
Mac section as well. Here’s a rundown:
Figure 8-10:

Part III: Choosing and Installing Recording Software 

1. Insert the Pro Tools software CD in your computer’s CD drive.
2. In the new window that appears, double-click the Install Pro Tools icon.
The OS X Administration window appears, asking you to enter your
password.
3. Enter your OS X administration password and click OK.
The Pro Tools installer opens.
4. Select the Startup hard drive as the destination drive.
The installation path is set.
5. Click the Install button.
Pro Tools is installed on your computer. (This might take a few minutes,
so sit back and contemplate the fun you’re going to have once it’s fin-
ished installing itself.)
6. Restart your computer.
Wait to open the program until after you attach your hardware. The complete
details for attaching hardware are located in Chapter 5.
Configuring Your Hardware
If you think that after installing your software you can start documenting your
musical genius right away, think again. Before you can do any recording, 
you need to configure your hardware in your audio recording program. This
involves several steps, including installing hardware drivers and choosing
hardware settings, choosing I/O buffer settings, and selecting input and
output routing. These steps are detailed in this section.
Setting up your interface
Hardware settings are the configurations that relate to your audio interface
and include such things as the clock source, bit depth, sample rate, and digi-
tal input/output routing selections. The options that you have to choose from
as well as the steps you perform to select these settings vary depending on the
hardware you use. To give you an idea of this process, I detail the set up pro-
cedures for two interfaces — a Digidesign model and a MOTU model — in
this section. And because I use a Mac for most of my recording, the steps 
in this section use a Macintosh running OS X. The procedures for Windows
XP are similar.
163
Chapter 8: Installing Your Software

Installing interface software
Every audio interface comes with software that allows you to run it with your
audio application. Unless the maker of your audio recording software is the
same as the manufacturer of your audio interface, you need to install this
software separately from your audio recording software. To do this, follow
the steps that I list in “Installing your software” section of the Mac OS X and
Windows XP sections of this chapter — depending, of course, on which oper-
ating system you have installed on your computer.
After you have the interface software installed and have restarted your com-
puter, you’re ready to perform the setup procedure.
Opening the Hardware Setup dialog box
Depending on your hardware/software choice, you need to open your audio
recording application or your audio interface software program. For example,
if you use Pro Tools software (which requires one of the Digidesign audio
interfaces), follow this procedure to open the Hardware Setup dialog box:
1. Turn on your interface by depressing the power button located on the
front panel.
2. Double-click the Pro Tools icon in the Applications folder of your 
computer — or wherever Pro Tools is installed on your system — to
launch Pro Tools.
Pro Tools boots up without any open windows.
3. Choose Setups➪Hardware Setup from the menu at the top of 
your screen.
The Hardware Setup dialog box opens. (See Figure 8-11.) You’re now
ready to adjust the settings.
Figure 8-11:
The

Setup dialog
box is
where you

164
Part III: Choosing and Installing Recording Software 

If you use an audio interface that isn’t joined at the hip with your audio pro-
gram, you need to open the interface’s software to make the hardware setting
adjustments, rather than adjusting your audio program. As an example,
here’s how you adjust hardware settings when using a MOTU application:
1. Turn on your interface by flipping the switch on the front panel.
2. Double-click the MOTU icon in your application folder to open the
software.
The setup dialog box for your particular device opens.
3. Click on the tab for the interface you have to access your setup
options, as shown in Figure 8-12.
Making your selection
Getting to the Hardware Setup dialog box is only half the battle. You still have
to actually change some of the settings. This section gives you some guide-
lines on what to do.
With the hardware setup dialog box open, you can see a bunch of settings
you can tweak. Each device’s setup dialog box has different options. The
most common settings include the specific hardware device, clock source,
sample rate, and digital/optical inputs and outputs. Some devices, such as
the MOTU interfaces (see Figure 8-12), give you monitoring options for some
version of low-latency monitoring. (Latency refers to the delay caused by
your audio being converted from analog to digital and back again so you can
hear what you play, and low latency refers to a setting that reduces this
Figure 8-12:

settings you
want to use.
165
Chapter 8: Installing Your Software

latency by routing your signal to skip either part of the software or part of
the hardware in your system. Chapter 10 has more on low-latency monitoring).
Here’s a rundown of the most common (dare I say, important) selection areas:
 Device: The device is the piece of hardware you have. If the manufac-
turer of your interface makes more than one device, you might have the
option of choosing from their various models. As you can see in Figures
8-11 and 8-12, the dialog box lists the device (or devices) that you have
connected to your system. If you have more than one device, you need
to select the one whose settings you want to adjust. This is as easy as
clicking the name of the device. For the Pro Tools example, you can find
the device name in the Peripherals list box (refer to Figure 8-11); in the
MOTU example, the device selection option is located as a tab at the top
of the Hardware Setup dialog box. (Refer to Figure 8-12.)
 Clock Source: The clock source is the device that controls the digital
clock (the exact time that each sample takes place). This drop-down list
allows you to choose your source for the digital master clock, thus making
sure that if you have more than one device (a separate A/D converter
connected to your interface, for example), all devices are synchronized.
If you use just your connected interface, simply choose Internal in this
menu, but if you have other digital devices, such as a digital mixer or
external converter, select your clock source based on the device that
has the best clock. Your choices here depend on your interface and 
how it defines the different possibilities. For example, the Digi 002 (see
Figure 8-13, left) includes these options:
• Internal: Uses the digital clock inside the Digidesign interface.
• ADAT: Synchronizes from a signal sent into the ADAT input of your
interface. ADAT stands for Alesis Digital Audio Tape. (For more on
ADAT inputs, see Chapter 5.)
• S/PDIF: Synchronizes to a signal sent via the coaxial S/PDIF input.
S/PDIF stands for Sony/Phillips Digital Interface Format. (For more
on S/PDIF inputs, see Chapter 5.)
• Optical (S/PDIF): Synchronizes to a S/PDIF signal coming in the
ADAT optical input. You can choose this last one only if you have
the lower option selected in the Digital Input check box. (See the
“Digital/Optical Input and Output” bullet.)
The MOTU 828 (Figure 8-13, right), on the other hand, contains 
these options:
• Internal: Uses the digital clock inside the MOTU interface
• ADAT 9-pin: Synchronizes from a signal sent into the 9-pin ADAT
connector of your interface.
• Toslink: Synchronizes to a signal coming in the optical ADAT or
S/PDIF input. (For more on Toslink connections, see Chapter 5.)
166
Part III: Choosing and Installing Recording Software 

With some interfaces, such as the Digidesign units, you have to connect
your desired device to your Digidesign hardware before opening the
Hardware Setup dialog box if you want to use one of the digital connec-
tions as a clock source. If the device isn’t connected beforehand, it won’t
show up in the dialog box.
If you have more than one digital device connected (such as a digital
mixer connected to your Digidesign interface), do some experimenting by
recording with different clock sources; compare the chosen sources to see
which one gives you the best sound. (Digital clocks vary in quality.) Also,
if you have more than three digital devices connected to your system,
consider using a specialized master clock and distribute this clock source
to all your devices. This will likely give you a better sound because it
ensures that all your devices are following the same clock timing.
 Digital/Optical Input and Output: The digital/optical input and output
parameters let you choose how the digital/optical inputs on your inter-
face function. Most devices that have an optical input and output let you
select how they function. The optical jacks are able to handle either
ADAT (eight channels of digital audio) or S/PDIF (two channels of digital
audio) signals, but not both. Aside from being able to select between the
two data types, some interfaces also allow you to select None for this
parameter. Figure 8-14 shows you the options that the Digidesign and
MOTU hardware setup dialog boxes have to offer.
 Sample Rate: The Sample Rate drop-down list allows you to choose the
sample rate — how many times every second digital data is collected — in
which to work. Depending on your interface, you might be able to choose
from 44.1 kHz, 48 kHz, 88.2 kHz, or 96 kHz. Figure 8-15 shows you your
options in both the Digidesign and MOTU hardware setup dialog boxes.

167
Chapter 8: Installing Your Software

For some devices, such as the Digidesign interface, the Sample Rate
drop-down list is editable only when you don’t have a song file open. If
you have a song file open, this drop-down list box shows the sample rate
chosen when this song file was created but won’t allow you to make any
changes. To choose a different sample rate for any future song files,
close the song file you have open and then choose Setups➪Hardware
Setup from the main menu, make your choice, and then click OK. Then
open a new song file. This new song file is in the sample rate that you
just chose.
After you make your selections, you can close the Hardware Setup dialog
box. This can be accomplished by either clicking the OK button, as with the
Digidesign device, or by clicking on the Close button at the top of the window
(the red button on the left side for Mac OS X and the X button on the right
side for Windows XP).

Part III: Choosing and Installing Recording Software 

Configuring your audio application 
hardware settings
You need to adjust a few settings in your audio application to get your system
up and running and to give you the best performance possible. For example,
you need to assign drivers and adjust buffer settings. This section outlines
these areas.
Setting up your hardware
If you use an interface and audio recording program from different manufac-
turers, you need to set up your interface within the recording program in
addition to setting it up in its own software. Just to give one example, if you
use Logic Pro, follow these steps:
1. Double-click the Logic Icon in your application folder (or wherever
Logic is located in your computer) to launch the application.
Logic opens with a new song file. (Chapter 10 has more about opening a
song file.)
2. Choose Audio➪Audio Hardware & Drivers, as shown in Figure 8-16.
The Audio Hardware and Drivers panel of the Preferences dialog 
box opens.
3. Select the check box for the type of driver that your interface uses.
The driver type expands to show the hardware options.
Note: The MOTU 828 and the Digidesign Digi 002, the two interfaces I’ve
been using as examples in this chapter, both use Core Audio drivers in
Mac OS X as well as in Windows XP.

Chapter 8: Installing Your Software

4. Select your audio interface from the Driver drop-down list, as shown
in Figure 8-17.
5. Click OK to accept your selection and close the Audio Hardware and
Drivers dialog box.
Adjusting buffer settings
Audio recording programs allow you to control to some degree the amount 
of stress you put your computer through. These settings are in the form of
buffers, which store data and parcel it out as appropriate to help your system
run most efficiently. Buffers come in several varieties, depending on the par-
ticular software you use, but I cover the most important ones in the following
sections.
Inputs and outputs
In Logic, this particular buffer is called the I/O buffer; in Pro Tools, it’s
referred to as the H/W buffer size. Regardless of what you call it, this setting
lets you determine how many samples are placed in memory before being
written to disk. The specifics of each recording program vary, but the bottom
line here is that tweaking this setting determines how much latency (delay)
you have from the audio coming in to your system and the audio going out
again to your headphones or speakers.
This is an important setting because this latency can be noticeable when you
record and can easily make it harder for you to get into a groove. (Chapter 10
has more on latency and recording.)
Figure 8-17:
Select your
audio
interface
from the
Driver drop-
down list.
170
Part III: Choosing and Installing Recording Software 

Every audio recording program offers you several settings to choose from.
These can be as low as about 64 to as high as 1024 or more. (These numbers
refer to the number of audio samples that are placed in the buffer at a time.)
Here, lower numbers mean a lower degree of latency — with an accompany-
ing greater strain on your processor — whereas higher numbers mean 
more latency.
To adjust the hardware buffer size, follow these steps:
In Pro Tools:
1. Choose Setups➪Playback Engine.
The Playback Engine dialog box opens.
2. Select the setting that you want from the H/W Buffer Size 
drop-down list.
3. Click OK to accept the setting and close the dialog box.
In Logic Pro:
1. Choose Audio➪Audio Hardware and Drivers.
The Audio Hardware and Drivers dialog box opens.
2. Select the setting that you want from the I/O Buffer drop-down list.
3. Click OK to accept the setting and close the window.
I suggest that you keep this setting as low as possible while recording (espe-
cially when you do overdubs). How low you can go depends on how many
tracks you record at once — and whether you want to use plug-ins such as
reverb while recording. Using lots of tracks and lots of plug-ins requires lots
of memory, which might force you (rats!) to bump up the hardware-buffer size.
Higher buffer sizes mean higher latencies, which can make overdubbing tracks
more difficult, so I reserve high buffer sizes until after I’m done recording all
my tracks.
When you’re ready to mix, go ahead and raise the buffer size — it doesn’t
matter if there’s a delay within your system because you’re not trying to record
a new track to it. This puts less stress on your system and allows you to have
more plug-ins going at a time before you run into performance problems.
Playback or disk/process buffer
The playback or disk/processor buffer deals with the amount of memory the
audio engine uses to manage the hard drive’s buffers. As with the hardware
buffer, you want as low a setting as you can get without sacrificing system per-
formance. If the setting is too high, you experience a delay between when you
hit the Play command and when your program starts playing the recording.
171
Chapter 8: Installing Your Software

Too low a setting, on the other hand, can create problems such as audio
dropout when you record or play back tracks — the sound can just cut off.
Start with the default setting and make adjustments as needed. To set this
buffer, follow these steps:
In Pro Tools:
1. Choose Setups➪Playback Engine.
The Playback Engine dialog box opens.
2. Select the setting that you want from the DAE Playback buffer size
drop-down list.
3. Click OK to accept the setting and close the window.
In Logic Pro:
1. Choose Audio➪Audio Hardware and Drivers.
The Audio Hardware and Drivers dialog box opens.
2. Select the buffer setting that you want from the Process Buffer Range
drop-down list.
3. Click OK to accept the setting and close the window.
Congratulations! Your system is ready to start recording.

Revving Up the
Recording Process

In this part . . .
P
art IV explores the computer-based recording
process. Chapter 9 gets basic with an exploration of
ways to get the best source sound, whether it’s from a
guitar, a keyboard, or a microphone. In Chapter 10, you
start the recording process by discovering ways to record
and edit audio data. Chapter 11 focuses on the process of
recording and editing MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital
Interface) performance data. Chapter 12 introduces you
to the world of loops and helps you get set up to use them
in your music. Chapter 13 ups the ante by helping you
understand and use software instruments (called soft-
synths) in your music. Chapter 14 completes this section
by walking you through the process of mixing and master-
ing your music in your computer.

Chapter 9
Getting a Great Source Sound
In This Chapter
 Understanding the signal chain
 Making your guitar sound great
 Getting the best sound from your keyboards
 Finding the right sound for your microphones
T
he quality of your recording relies heavily on two things: the sound of
your instruments and how well you do getting that sound into your com-
puter without messing it up. The problem is that anyone can easily mess up
the sound or at least fall short of getting the best possible sound.
This chapter gives you the knowledge to keep bad sound — or sound that’s
not as good as it could be — from happening. In this chapter, I describe signal
flow and the role that it plays in shaping the sound of your instrument. I also
give you tips on how to get great guitar sounds and killer keyboard sounds
without hassle. To top it off, I spend a few pages getting you up to speed on
miking effectively.
Making Sense of the Signal Chain
The signal chain is the path that your sound travels from its creation (your
guitar, keyboard, or voice) to your recorder (the computer). This path often
includes several steps — and pieces of gear — that need to have their levels
optimized so that you don’t end with too much or too little sound going to
your system. Figure 9-1 shows a typical signal chain for a mic.

In this example, the sound originating from your voice, enters the micro-
phone, travels to the preamp where it’s amplified, is sent to the interface
where it’s turned into digital information, and finally it gets sent into your
computer’s recording software program and the hard drive where it’s stored.
The key to a good instrument or mic sound is getting the levels of each step
in the chain set to its optimal level. This chapter focuses on three distinct
steps in the chain:
 The source: In the example you see in Figure 9-1, the microphone’s place-
ment has a huge effect on the signal level that goes into your computer.
Moving the mic just a couple inches can have a significant impact on
your signal level at the preamp. A good, solid level keeps you from having
to crank up your preamp too far, which causes noise. If the level is too
hot though — hot in the sense of a solid signal between –12dB and –6dB,
not in the sense of “burn your fingers” hot — you risk getting distortion
at the mic. This same concept holds true for keyboards or other elec-
tronic instruments, as well as guitars plugged directly into your interface.
 The preamp/interface: You adjust this level so that the level at your
software is where you want it (see next bullet). The trick here is that you
don’t want the level set so high that it creates noise in your track, but
you don’t want it so low that you’re forced to set your source volume so
high that it creates distortion.
 Your software: If you record at a 24-bit rate (Chapter 4 has more about
bit rates), you want your levels peaking at about –10 to –12dB. This
approximate level gives you the necessary headroom (room for tran-
sient peaks) so that your signal doesn’t overdrive your converters and
software and produce distortion. If you record at a 16-bit rate, you need
to raise this level a bit (peaks no higher than –6dB) and keep a very
close watch to make sure that you don’t clip (distort) the signal.
Setting the best level for each stage of your signal chain is more of an art than
a science. You need to use your ears and carefully listen as you make adjust-
ments to each stage. Having one level set too high increases the likelihood of
distortion, which ruins your sound, and it forces the next stage to be too low,
which often results in a thin sound. Take your time setting the levels and use
your ears.

Do you wanna know how to get the absolute best, most rich, engaging guitar
sound? Well, I wish I could tell you, but alas I can’t. This is something you’re
going to need to figure out by listening as you tweak your gear. That said, you
can get your sound into your computer in four ways, and each way has its
plusses and minuses:
 Directly from your guitar into your interface: This assumes that your
interface can handle a direct connection from a guitar. (Most can, but
check to make sure that the one you have or want has this capability. If
it doesn’t, you need to get a direct box to put between your guitar and
your interface. I talk about direct boxes in Chapter 1.) By using this
method, the sound you get from your guitar is pretty much the same
sound you’re going to get recorded.
You might not like the sound. In fact, I’ll bet that you won’t. The solution
to this unfortunate state of affairs is to use a plug-in (or more than one)
in your recording program to get the sound you want. This is a common
way to get a guitar sound, and tons of good plug-ins can help, including
plug-ins for providing distortion, delay chorus, and even special amp
simulators that are designed to sound like popular guitar amplifiers. One
advantage to this approach is that you can tweak the sound of your
guitar as much as you want after it’s recorded. The disadvantage is that
you can easily become afflicted with indecision disorder and be unable
to pick the sound you want. Also, many guitar-tone connoisseurs feel
that the sound this way isn’t as good as miking up an amp with the
sound you want.
 From your guitar to an amp simulator, from the amp simulator into
your interface: Amp simulators are like the plug-ins that you can get for
your software, only they’re standalone units that have the various sounds
in them already. A bunch of standalone amp simulators are available on
the market, and most offer decent simulations of the most popular guitar
amps. This can be a good solution for many people, but the disadvan-
tage of doing this instead of adding your effects in the computer is that
after you record your sound through an amp simulator, that’s the sound
you’re stuck with. Of course, if you often get hit with indecision disorder,
this might be a good solution for you.
 From your guitar into your amp and from your amp’s line output to
your interface: Recording a guitar this way is great for people who have
an amp that they like the sound of but who don’t want to mic a speaker.
When you follow this approach, you have three volume controls to
adjust to get your level into your recorder — your guitar, your amp, and
your interface. You might have to take some time tweaking these settings
to get the best possible sound.

Chapter 9: Getting a Great Source Sound

 From your guitar into your amp with a mic picking up the speaker’s
sound: This is the old standby approach because you get to record the
actual sound you’re used to hearing coming out of your amp. With this
method, having the right mic and mic placement makes all the difference
in the world. I offer some specific guitar-amping mic techniques later in
this chapter.
There is no one way to get a great guitar sound. Don’t be afraid to experiment.
You might just come up with a sound that really moves you.
Creating a Killer Keyboard Sound
They key to a killer keyboard sound is making sure that you get the sound
into your system without messing it up (no pressure here). Depending on
your gear, keyboard sounds can be brought into your system one of two ways:
 Using an external keyboard: For an external keyboard containing the
sounds you want to record, plug an instrument cord from the main out-
puts of your keyboard to the corresponding number of inputs in your
audio interface. Turn your keyboard volume up between 1⁄2 and 3⁄4 or until
you get a decent signal to register in your software. If your interface
input has a volume (gain) control, adjust it and the volume of your key-
board until you get a solid sound without distortion.
 Using a soft-synth: If you want to record a software synthesizer, you first
need to connect a MIDI controller to your system. This can be in the
form of a MIDI connection (through a MIDI port), or it can be a USB con-
nection if you have a USB-equipped keyboard. Chapter 5 explains how to
make the connections for this. After you have your keyboard hooked up,
you need to set up a soft-synth in your song. The steps vary depending
on the particular software that you use. I detail some specific soft-synths
in Chapter 13.
Follow the guidelines that I list in the “Making Sense of the Signal Chain” 
section, earlier in this chapter, to get your signal levels to be optimal.
Making the Most of Microphones
Finding a great sound from a mic is key to getting a great-sounding recording.
To do this, you need to use the best mic for the application and place it
where it can sound its best. This requires not only knowledge of the different
types of mics that are available, but also how these mics are used for a vari-
ety of instrument. In this section, I give you a quick tutorial on microphones
and mic-placement techniques to get you started.
178
Part IV: Revving Up the Recording Process 

There are as many different ways to mic an instrument as there are people
doing the miking, so the following sections just provide some general guide-
lines. (If you want more detail — including some cool drawings — check out
my Home Recording For Musicians For Dummies, 2nd Edition, also published
by Wiley.) Most importantly, don’t be afraid of the experiment; let your ears
be the judge of what works for your instrument in your song.
Tracing typical microphone techniques
Regardless of the style of microphone you use — or the type of instrument
you record — you can use one or more of the following mic-placement tech-
niques to capture the sound you want:
 Spot (or close) miking: Spot miking (also called close miking) involves
placing your microphone within a couple feet of the sound source.
People with a home-recording setup use this technique most often
because it adds little of the sound of the room (the reverb and delay) to
the recorded sound.
 Distant miking: When you use distant miking, you place mics about 3 or
4 feet away from the sound source. Distant miking enables you to cap-
ture some of the sound of the room along with the instrument. An exam-
ple of a distant-miking technique is the overhead drum mic. With it, you
can pick up the whole drum set to some extent. Coupled with a few
select spot mics, you can record a natural sound.
 Ambient miking: Ambient miking is simply placing the mic far enough
away from the sound source so you capture more of the room sound
(the reverb and delay) than the sound of the actual instrument. You
might place the mic a couple feet away from the source but pointed in
the opposite direction, or you might place the mic across the room. You
can even put the mic in an adjacent room, although this is an unortho-
dox technique, I’ll admit. The distance that you choose varies from
instrument to instrument.
Ambient mic placement works well in those places where the room adds
to the sound of the instrument. (Home recordists sometimes use stair-
wells, bathrooms, or rooms with wood paneling to liven up the sound.)
The sound that you record is ambient — steeped in the sonic qualities of
the surroundings (hence the name ambient miking). If you mix this in with
a spot mic, you can end up with a natural reverb. If your room doesn’t
add to the sound of the instrument, you’re better off not using any 
ambient mics. You can always add a room sound by using effects in 
the mixing process. (See Chapter 17.)
179
Chapter 9: Getting a Great Source Sound

 Stereo miking: Stereo miking involves using two mics to capture the
stereo field of the instrument. A variety of stereo miking techniques
exist, and things can get pretty complicated when using two mics to
record. (For all the details, check out my Home Recording For Musicians
For Dummies, 2nd Edition, also published by Wiley.) You can also find
stereo mics that — on their own — do a good job of capturing the stereo
field of an instrument.
Stereo miking has the advantage of capturing a natural stereo image.
When you listen to performances that were recorded with well-placed
stereo miking, you can hear exactly where on the stage each instrument
performed.
 Combined miking strategies: Many times you’ll want to use more than
one mic. The possible combinations are almost limitless: You can use
several spot mics on one instrument, you can use a spot mic and an ambi-
ent mic, you can have a distant mic and a spot mic, or . . . Well, you get
the point.
Taming transients
The single most difficult part of getting a good sound by using a microphone
is dealing with sudden, extreme increases in the sound signal. These blips are
called transients, and they regularly happen when a drum is first struck; when
a vocalist sings certain syllables (for example, those that begin with p); and
when a guitar player picks certain notes. In fact, because you can’t always
control the amount of force that you apply to an instrument, transients can
happen at any time, with any instrument, and without warning. (Highly
trained musicians produce fewer transients because they have a greater 
mastery over their muscular movements.)
In digital recording, all it takes is one slight, unexpected note to cause clip-
ping and distortion, ruining what might be a perfect musical performance.
Believe me, nothing is so heart-wrenching as listening to the perfect take
(recorded performance) and hearing the unmistakable sound of digital distor-
tion. Although you can’t eliminate transients completely (they’re part of an
instrument’s character), you can tame the extreme transients that often
cause digital overs (a thick signal at too high a level, resulting in distortion).
You can lash ’em down in three ways:
 Level ’em. Set your levels properly so the transients don’t overload the
converters. Transient are fast. So fast, in fact, that the meters in your
preamp (assuming it has meters), interface (if it has any meters), or
your computer often don’t show transients, so be sure to set your levels
low enough to accommodate these extra signals since they’re also
higher in level than the body of the sound. This is especially important
for transient-rich instruments such as the acoustic piano. I recommend
giving yourself an extra 6dB of room for these transients.
180
Part IV: Revving Up the Recording Process 

 Mic ’em. Make sure you have proper mic placement. A microphone
that’s too close to a loud sound source (or pointed too directly at the
point of attack) can easily pick up extreme transients. In most cases, all
you have to do is to pull the mic away from the instrument a little or
turn it ever so slightly so that it avoids picking up too high a signal. 
(I cover mic setup thoroughly in the following section.)
The main thing to keep in mind when placing your mics is to experiment.
Don’t be afraid to spend time making small adjustments. After all, the
track you save could be your own.
 Run ’em through. Run the signal through a compressor when recording.
A compressor is a piece of hardware (not included in your audio inter-
face) that controls the dynamics of your signal to keep your levels from
getting too high. However, to do this with a computer-based system and
an all-inclusive audio interface (one with preamps in it), your interface
has to have line inserts — doohickies that let you insert a compressor
between the preamp and the converter within the interface. (Check the
specs of your interface to see whether you have this option.) If your
interface doesn’t have inserts (most of them don’t), you need to use an
external preamp and plug the compressor between the preamp and the
interface.
If you follow my advice in the “Making Sense of the Signal Chain” section
earlier in this chapter and you keep your recording levels peaking no
higher than about –10 to –12dB, you don’t need a compressor to take
care of the transients because they likely won’t exceed the maximum
level that your system can handle.
Setting Up Your Mics: Some Suggestions
When you start to record, you discover an almost infinite number of ways to
set up your mics. I can’t go into all of them here (as if I really knew all of them
anyway), but what I can do is share the miking approaches that I use and
have found to work for me. Okay, they’re not just my approaches; they’re
pretty common ways for miking a variety of instruments.
Vocals
Regardless of the type of studio you have or the style of music that you
record, you’ll probably record vocals at some point. And unfortunately, vocals
are one of the most challenging instruments to do well. First, you have to find
the right mic for the person who’s singing, and then you need to try different
approaches to get the best sound out of him or her. Fortunately, you’re in luck.
In this section, I lead you through the (sometimes complicated) process of
getting good lead and backup vocal sounds.
181
Chapter 9: Getting a Great Source Sound

You have a lot of options for miking vocals. The type of mic that you use dic-
tates where you place it. The following bullet list gives you the gist. (Need a
refresher on the different types of mics out there? Check out Chapter 4.)
 Dynamic mic: Dynamic mics sound best when you place them close to
the singer’s mouth. The effect that you get is gritty. (Huh? Okay, by
gritty, I mean dirty. That’s no help either? Let me see. . . .)
Dynamic mics produce a midrange-dominated sound because the high
frequencies aren’t reproduced well. When a singer sings with the mic
right in front of his or her mouth, the sound has even fewer high fre-
quencies due to the proximity effect — the close range enhances the
low-frequency response. What you get is a deep, bass-heavy sound that’s
often described as gritty or dirty. This type of sound can be great for
matching the mood of some styles of rock and blues music.
 Large-diaphragm condenser mic: Large-diaphragm condenser mics are
those most commonly used for vocals. These mics can clearly reproduce
the entire audible frequency spectrum, emphasizing the low mids slightly
at the same time. What you get is a nice, warm, full-bodied sound (that
sounds like I’m describing a wine). The proximity effect (how close the
singer is to the mic) determines how nice and warm-bodied the sound is.
The closer the singer is, the deeper and richer the tone can be.
When you set up a large-diaphragm condenser mic for vocals, place the
mic in such a way that the spiteful sibilants (the sound from singing s
and t sounds) and pesky plosives (the pops from singing p syllables)
don’t mess up your recordings. To deal with plosives and sibilants, you
can use a pop filter (a screen that reduces the impact of sibilants and
plosives going to your mic) or have the singer sing past the mic instead
of right into it. If you want the singer to sing past the mic, you can
• Place the mic above the singer and set it at an angle pointing away
from him or her (Figure 9-2, left).
• Put the mic off to the side and face it toward the singer (Figure 9-2,
center), but not squarely in the path of the vocal.
• Set up the mic below the singer and angle it away from him or her
(Figure 9-2, right).

Part IV: Revving Up the Recording Process 

 Small-diaphragm condenser mic: Small-diaphragm condenser mics
create a much brighter, airier sound than their large-diaphragm cousins.
You don’t get the low-mid warmth of the large-diaphragm beast, so the
small-diaphragm mic probably won’t be your first choice as a vocal mic —
unless (for example) you’re recording a female vocalist with a soprano
voice and you want to catch the more ethereal quality of her higher 
frequencies.
 Ribbon mic: The ribbon mic is a good choice if you’re looking for an 
intimate, crooner-type sound. (Think Frank Sinatra.) The ribbon mic is
thought to add a silky sound to the singer’s voice — produced by a
slight drop-off in the high frequencies (which aren’t as severe as you’d
get from a dynamic mic). To my drum-abused ears, ribbon mics have a
kind of softness that large-diaphragm condenser mics don’t have. The
sound is more even, without the pronounced low-mid effect.
Electric guitar
Miking your electric guitar is a personal thing. Every guitar player, it seems to
me (although I don’t play guitar, so what do I know?), spends an awful lot of
time getting his or her “sound.” If you’re a real guitar player, you undoubtedly
take great pride in getting your sound exactly right on tape, er, disc. You likely
spend countless hours tweaking your amp and adjusting the mic to get it just
right. On the other hand, if you’re not a (harrumph) real guitar player, you
might just want to record the part and get it over with. Either way, you can
start looking for that perfect guitar sound by placing your mics in one (or
more) of the ways that I outline later in this chapter.
The actual type of mic you choose depends largely on the type of sound
you’re looking for. For example, if you’re looking for a distorted rock guitar
sound with effects, you can get by just fine with a dynamic mic. If you favor a
clean sound, a small-diaphragm condenser mic might work better for you. If
you’re going for a warm, full-bodied sound, try using a large-diaphragm con-
denser mic.
No matter which type of mic you use, you get the best sound from your amp
speakers by putting the mic about 2 to 12 inches away from the cabinet,
pointing the mic directly at the cone of one of the amp speakers (specifically,
the center of the speaker, which is that cone-shaped thing in the box). You
can see this positioning in Figure 9-3.
If you can’t quite get the sound that you want from your amp with the one
mic pointed at the speaker cone, try adding a second mic about 3 or 4 feet
away — also pointed directly at the speaker cone — to get a more ambient
sound. This arrangement might also give your sound more life, especially if
you have a room with natural reverberation.
183
Chapter 9: Getting a Great Source Sound

Electric bass
When you mic an electric bass, getting a good sound can be a real bear. Your
two adversaries are muddiness (lack of definition) and thinness (a pronounced
midrange tone). These seem almost polar-opposite characteristics, but they
can both exist at the same time. Don’t be afraid to be creative. Try recording
your bass in different rooms or with different mic combinations. Look for a
room with a warm sound to it.
Because the bass guitar produces low frequencies, a dynamic mic or a large-
diaphragm condenser mic works well. I personally avoid small-diaphragm
condensers and ribbon mics for the electric bass, but try them if you want.
Who knows — you might end up with an awesome bass track.
Mic placement for the electric bass is similar to the guitar; you place a single
mic 2 to 12 inches away from one of the speakers. Sometimes, with bass, you
can angle the mic and let the speaker’s sound kind of drift past the diaphragm.
Potentially it’s a great sound. For a bass, skip the distant mic (which generally
just adds muddiness to the sound).

Part IV: Revving Up the Recording Process 

Acoustic guitars and such
At the risk of offending banjo, dobro, or ukulele players, I’m lumping all
guitar-like (strummed or picked) acoustic string instruments together. I know,
they all sound and play differently, but the microphone-placement techniques
are similar for all these instruments. Allow me to explain.
Because all these instruments have a resonating chamber and are played
with the instrument facing forward, you can pretty much use the same mic
placement for any of them. You use different types of mics for different instru-
ments, and I get to that in a minute.
I prefer to use condenser mics when recording acoustic instruments. The
type of condenser mic you use depends on the overall tonal quality that you
want to capture or emphasize. For example, if a guitar has a nice woody
sound that you want to bring out in the recording, a large-diaphragm con-
denser mic is a good choice. On the other hand, if you’re trying to capture
the brightness of a banjo, a small-diaphragm mic is a better choice.
You can position your microphone in a variety of ways, and each accents 
certain aspects of the instrument’s sound. Even a slight adjustment to the
mic can have a significant impact on the sound. You might have to experi-
ment quite a bit to figure out exactly where to put a mic.
To help with your experimentation, listen to the guitar carefully and move the
mic around (closer in and farther out, to the left and right) until you find a spot
that sounds particularly good. You need to get your ears close to the guitar to
do this. After some experimenting — and a great deal of patience — you should
be able to get the sound you want.
Drum set
If you’re like most musicians, getting great-sounding drums seems like one of
the world’s great mysteries. (You know, along the lines of how the pyramids
were built or how to cure noise hangover.) You can hear big, fat drums on
great albums, but when you try to record your drums, they always end up
sounding more like cardboard boxes than drums. Fret not (hey, at least I
don’t say that in the guitar section), for I have solutions for you.
First things first: Tuning your drums
The single most important part of getting killer drum sounds is to make sure
your drums are tuned properly and that they have good heads on them
(okay, that’s two things). Seriously, if you spend some time getting the drums
185
Chapter 9: Getting a Great Source Sound

to sound good in your room, you’re already halfway to the drum sound of
your dreams. There isn’t space to go into detail here (especially if you play a
large kit), but if you want specific drum-tuning guidance, you can do a search
on the Internet or (ahem) check out a copy of my book, Drums For Dummies
(Wiley Publishing, Inc.).
When the tuning of your drums is perfect, you’re ready to start placing some
microphones. You can choose from an unlimited number of miking configura-
tions, only a few of which I can cover here. (It would take a whole book to
cover them all.)
The room and the drums
The room influences the sound of the drums more than it influences that of
other instruments. If you’re looking for a big drum sound, you need a fairly
live room (one with lots of reflection).
I know you’re thinking, “But all I have to work with is a bedroom for a studio,
and it’s carpeted.” No worries — you can work with that. Remember, if you
have a home studio, potentially you have your whole home to work with.
Here are a couple ideas to spark your imagination:
 Buy three or four 4-x-10-foot sheets of plywood and lean them up against
the walls of your room. Also place one on the floor just in front of the
kick drum. This adds some reflective surfaces to the room.
 Put the drums in your garage (or living room, or any other room with a
reverberating sound) and run long mic cords to your mixer. If you have a
laptop-based system, you can just throw it under your arm and move
everything into your garage or, better yet, take all this stuff to a room
with great acoustics and record.
 Set up your drums in a great recording room and place an additional mic
just outside the door to catch some additional ambient sound. You can
then mix this in with the other drum tracks to add a different quality of
reverberation to the drums.
Kick (bass) drum
The mic of choice for most recording engineers when recording a kick drum
is a dynamic mic. In fact, you can find some large-diaphragm dynamic mics
specifically designed to record kick drums.
No matter where you place the mic, you can reduce the amount of boominess
that you get from the drum by placing a pillow or blanket inside the drum.
Some people choose to let the pillow or blanket touch the inside head. I
prefer to keep it a couple inches away from the inside head, but sometimes
it’s okay to let it touch the outside head.
186
Part IV: Revving Up the Recording Process 

That said, you can place your mic in several ways:
 Near the inside head: This produces a sharper sound with more of the
instrument’s initial attack.
 Halfway inside the drum. This works if you have just one head on your
drum and you want less attack and more of the body of the drum’s sound.
 Near the outside head: This is preferable if you have both heads on
your drum and you want a full-bodied sound.
Try all three ways and see what fits best with the kind of musical mood you
want to call up.
Snare drum considerations
The snare drum is probably the most important drum in popular music. The
bass guitar can cover the kick drum’s rhythm, and the rest of the drums aren’t
part of the main groove. A good, punchy snare drum can make a track, whereas
a weak, thin one can eliminate the drive that most popular music needs.
Because the snare drum is located so close to the other drums (especially
the hi-hats), a cardioid pattern mic is a must. The most common mic for a
snare drum is the trusty Shure SM57. The mic is generally placed between the
hi-hats and the small tom-tom about 1 or 2 inches from the snare drum head.
Point the diaphragm directly at the head. You might need to make some minor
adjustments to eliminate any bleed (sound) from the hi-hats. This position
gives you a nice punchy sound.
If you want a crisper tone, you can add a second mic under the drum. Place
this mic about 1 or 2 inches from the head with the diaphragm pointing at the
snares. Make minor adjustments to minimize any leakage from the hi-hats.
Tom-toms
The tom-toms sound best when you use a dynamic mic. For the mounted
toms (the ones above the kick drum), you can use one or two mics. If you use
one mic, place it between the two drums about 4 to 6 inches away from the
heads. If you use two mics, place one above each drum about 1 to 3 inches
above the head.
If you want a boomy sound with less attack, you can place a mic inside the
shell with the bottom head off the drum.
Floor toms are miked the same way as the mounted tom-toms:
 Place a single mic a couple inches away from the head near the rim.
 If you have more than one floor tom, you can place one mic between
them or mic them individually.
187
Chapter 9: Getting a Great Source Sound

Hi-hats
The hi-hats are generally part of the main groove — as such, they’re impor-
tant enough that you want to spend some time getting a good sound. You’ll
probably have problems with a few other mics on the drum set picking up
the hi-hats, particularly the snare drum mic and overhead mics. (Some people
don’t even bother miking the hi-hats for this reason.)
You can use either a dynamic mic or, better yet, a small-diaphragm condenser
mic for the hi-hats. The dynamic mic gives you a trashier sound, and the
small-diaphragm condenser mic produces a bright sound. Place the mic
about 3 to 4 inches above the hi-hats and point it down. The exact placement
of the mic is less important than the placement of the other instrument mics
because of the hi-hats’ tone. Just make sure your mic isn’t so close that you
hit it instead of the cymbal.
Cymbals
Small-diaphragm condenser mics capture the cymbals’ high frequencies well.
You can mic the cymbals by placing mics about 6 inches above each cymbal
or by using overhead mics set 1 to 3 feet above the cymbals. (See the next
section for more on mic placement.)
The whole kit
Most of the time, you want to have at least one (but preferably two) ambient
mics on the drums — if for no other reason than to pick up the cymbals.
These (assuming you use two mics) are called overhead mics, and (as the
name implies) you place them above the drum set (usually by means of a
boom stand). The most common types of mics to use for overheads are large-
and small-diaphragm condenser mics because they pick up the high frequen-
cies in the cymbals and give the drum set’s sound a nice sheen (brightness).
To mic the drum set with overhead mics, do one of the following:
 Use X-Y mics. Place two mics right next to each other so that the
diaphragms are at almost right angles about 2 feet above the 
drummer’s head.
 Use a spaced pair. Place the two mics so that they’re 3 feet apart 
(if 1 foot above the cymbals) or 6 feet apart (if 2 feet above the cym-
bals). Point the spaced mics down toward the drums, and you’re ready
to record.
Figure 9-4 shows both of these setups.

Recording and Editing Audio
In This Chapter
 Setting up a song to record
 Recording your first track
 Adding more tracks to your song
 Editing your takes
I
’m sure you remember how to record to a regular tape deck: Turn it on, 
plug everything in, and click the Record button. One of the problems with
computer-based recording is that nothing is as simple as recording to a tape
deck. (Of course, the advantages far outweigh the disadvantages here.) For
many musicians (and I don’t necessarily mean you) the added complexity of
recording to a computer can end up pushing the limits of what they feel com-
fortable doing when trying to get their ideas down on tape (oops, I mean disc).
What could be a problem for others isn’t going to be problem for you for one
simple reason — you have this book (and this chapter, in particular) to help
you out. In this chapter, I walk you through the process of getting a song up
and going in your audio program and I help you perform the necessary steps
to turn your ideas into finely shaped bits of digital information.
Each recording program has its own way of working, and each has its own set
of quirks and features. Because I can’t possibly detail how to carry out every
task possible in each program on the market, I concentrate on Logic and Pro
Tools, two popular programs that put their own distinctive spin on the
recording and editing processes. The examples I use should give you a gen-
eral idea of the range of approaches out there when it comes to using record-
ing software. You still might find that the program you use requires a look-see
into the manual for specifics.

Setting Up a Song to Record
The first step in the recording process is to create a new song file in which to
record. This is a pretty simple process in both Logic and Pro Tools — all you
really have to do is open a new song file and adjust your hardware settings
for your interface.
Creating a new song file
To open a new song file in Pro Tools, do the following:
1. Double-click the Pro Tools icon to boot up the software.
The main menu appears.
2. Choose File➪New Session.
This opens the New Session dialog box, as shown in Figure 10-1.
From this dialog box you have a bunch of settings to make for your song file.
Here’s a rundown of the different parameters and what they mean:

file.

Part IV: Revving Up the Recording Process 

 Save As: This is where you type the name of this new song.
 Where: You can use this drop-down list to choose where you want to
save the file on your hard drive. I recommend that you use the handy
New Folder button to create a new folder for storing the session file and
that you name the folder the same as your session file. This makes your
session file easy to find on your hard drive — especially if you haven’t
worked on the session for a while.
 Audio File Type: This drop-down list lets you choose among BWF
(Broadcast WAV File), AIFF, or SD2 file types. Choose the one that works
best for you. (I always use BWF files because they’re compatible with
other software I use. Your needs might be different.) If you aren’t trans-
ferring your files from one program to another, I suggest using the
default BWF option.
 Sample Rate: Here you choose the sample rate of your session. In Pro
Tools, your options depend on the Digidesign hardware you have. For
example, if you have the Digi 001 or Mbox, your choice is between 44.1
kHz and 48 kHz, whereas if you have a Digi 002 or 002R, you can choose
among 44.1 kHz, 48 kHz, 88.2 kHz, and 96 kHz.
The higher the sample rate, the more work your computer’s processor
has to do. Often you have to balance your desire for the highest-resolution
music possible against the capabilities of your system.
I recommend getting to know your system before you record a lot of
music with it. Experiment with different sample rates and track counts
to see what your computer can handle. With this information, you can
get a good sense of how hard you can push your system before you
reach the limits of its performance.
 Bit Depth: In this area, you can choose between 16- and 24-bit rates.
Choose 24 bit.
 I/O Settings: In this drop-down list, you can choose between the most
recently used setting or a stereo-mix setting of the physical inputs and
outputs of your interface.
 Enforce Mac/PC Compatibility: Selecting this check box ensures that if
you transfer your session from a Mac computer to a PC, you can still
open the session and work in it. Leave this check box selected.
After you make all your choices and click the Save button, a new song file
(session) opens in Pro Tools. This session doesn’t have any tracks yet for
recording your music, so before you actually start to record you need to
create some tracks. I describe this procedure — along with all the intricacies
associated with the various kinds of tracks — in the “Taking a look at tracks”
section, later in this chapter.
193
Chapter 10: Recording and Editing Audio

In contrast to Pro Tools, opening a new song file in Logic Pro (choose File➪
New) automatically opens the Autoload song. The Autoload song is a song
template you can create that already has the number of the various track
types embedded in it that you want in your song. (If you haven’t created an
Autoload song, don’t worry; Logic Pro opens a basic song file with a bunch
of tracks in it to get you started.) You can still make changes to these tracks,
but it saves you time from having to put them in your new song manually.
You also don’t have to choose the settings that Pro Tools offers in its New
Session dialog box. These settings are scattered throughout a variety of menus.
For example, you set the sample rate by choosing Audio➪Sample Rate.
Logic Pro also doesn’t force you to immediately name and choose a location
for your new song. If your program takes this live-and-let-live approach, I
highly recommend that you immediately save your new song right away so
that if something happens and your program shuts down on you nothing gets
lost. It also gets the whole song-naming thing out of the way because the first
time you click Save, you’ll be asked to type in a name and file location. If
you’re in a groove recording, the last thing you want to do is stop and think
about what to call your song and where to put it.
Each audio recording program has its own peculiarities when you open and
work with a song, so check your manual to find out the exact procedures for
your software.
Taking a look at tracks
Within your song file, all your work is done with tracks. Tracks are like the
channels in your mixer or physical tracks on a tape deck. These tracks repre-
sent your audio data in your song. The one big advantage with computer-
based recording is that you can choose how many and what kind of tracks
you want in your song.
Understanding track types
To repeat the mantra throughout the book, every program is different (is
there an echo in here?), but many programs use certain basic types of tracks.
The basic track types include the following:
 Audio Instrument Tracks: These are like MIDI tracks — they record MIDI
data — but they don’t send the MIDI signal back out of your system again.
Instead you route the signal to a software synthesizer. These tracks can be
mono or stereo.
 Audio Tracks: An audio track contains audio files and can be mono or
stereo.
194
Part IV: Revving Up the Recording Process 

 Bus, Aux, or Auxiliary Input Tracks: Tracks with these names are used
as effects sends, for submixes, or for other routing purposes. These can
be mono or stereo.
 Master or Master Fader Tracks: This track type contains the summed
output for all the tracks routed to it or that are in your song, depending
on your audio recording application. Master Fader tracks can be mono
or stereo, although stereo is most common.
 MIDI Tracks: MIDI and audio instrument tracks contain MIDI data —
instructions to MIDI devices on how to create specific digital sounds.
(For more on MIDI, check out Chapters 4 and 11.) These tracks are avail-
able only in mono.
 Output Tracks: These tracks control the signals that are routed to the
physical outputs of your interface. In Pro Tools, this can also be the
Master Fader track. Output tracks can be either mono or stereo.
Creating tracks
If you use Pro Tools to record your music, you first need to create some tracks
in a new song because no tracks were included by default when it was created.
(Non-Pro Tools users shouldn’t skip over this section. Even if your song opens
with some tracks already in it, as with Logic Pro, you might want to create
some new tracks in your song. This section explains how to do this.)
To create a new track in Pro Tools:
1. Choose File➪New Track or press Ô+Shift+N on a Mac (or Ctrl+Shift+N
on a PC).
The New Track dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 10-2.
2. Select the number, format, and type for your track.
These options include:
• Number of new tracks: The default here is 1, but you can pretty
much create as many new tracks as you like. Just keep in mind that
you can have only 32 voices playing at one time in your session.
• Track format: Here you choose stereo or mono.
• Track type: Clicking the arrows opens a menu that lets you choose
between an Audio, Auxiliary Input, Master Fader, or MIDI track.
3. Click the Create button to create your new track.
This track then appears in your screen.
195
Chapter 10: Recording and Editing Audio

Creating a new track in Logic Pro is almost as easy:
1. Choose Functions➪Track➪Create from the menu at the top of the
Arrange window, as shown in Figure 10-3.
A new track appears in your song in the same format (and with the same
name) as the track directly before it.
Note: If the Arrange window isn’t showing, choose Windows➪Open
Arrange to make it appear.
2. To assign an audio object to the new track, click and hold on the track
name in the Arrange window.
A pop-up menu appears, as shown in Figure 10-4.
3. Drag your mouse to the Audio menu option and then to the type of
audio object you want.
Your choices here are Audio Instrument or Audio Track. Choose Audio
Track if you want to record a miked instrument that’s plugged in to your
audio interface, and choose Audio Instrument if you want to use a soft-
synth. Select one of the options from your audio object list to assign an
audio object.

4. Release the mouse.
Your new track is assigned to the selected audio object.
You can change the type of any new track you create by clicking and holding
over the track name in the Arrange window until the Track Type Selector
pop-up menu appears. Then just drag your mouse to the track type that you
want and release.
Naming tracks
As you start recording your ideas — and as you build up a pretty impressive
list of tracks — you have to find a way to keep (ahem) track of what you
recorded on each of them. The best way to do this is to give each of your
tracks a unique name — something that gives you some idea of what exactly
you recorded (lead guitar, kick drum or whatever). Naming tracks is essential
for a multitracking musician. It’s also very easy.
In Pro Tools, follow this simple procedure:
1. Double-click the track name within either of the main windows in
your session.
The Name Track dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 10-5.
2. Type the name of your track in the Name the Track text box.
If you want, you can also use the Comments text box to type in any
notes that might help you later on.
3. Click OK to close the dialog box and accept the name and notes.

Chapter 10: Recording and Editing Audio

In Logic Pro, the track-naming procedure differs (as usual):
1. In the Arrange window, click the track you want to rename.
The track becomes highlighted, and the track’s fader and name appear
on the left side of the window.
2. Click the track name on the far-left side of the Arrange window.
The track name becomes highlighted, as shown in Figure 10-6.
3. Type in your new name in the Name text box and press Return or
Enter to accept it.
Your new name appears for your track.
Routing your input and output signals
With a new song file and a bunch of tracks to work with, you’re ready to route
the inputs from your audio or MIDI interface into the tracks that you want to
record into. This process is pretty simple and is similar for most programs.
Here’s how you do it in Pro Tools:

Part IV: Revving Up the Recording Process 

1. Choose Display➪Edit Window Shows➪I/O View to open the I/O sec-
tion of the Edit window.
The I/O section of the Edit window shows the inputs and outputs for
each of your tracks.
2. Within the I/O section of your track in the Edit window, click and hold
on the Input selector until the Input contextual menu pops up.
3. While still holding down your mouse button, move the mouse over the
Input menu until it rests on the input listing you want, as shown in
Figure 10-7.
4. Release the mouse button to select the input listing.
This menu closes, and the input you’ve selected appears in the Input
selector.
Choosing your outputs requires pretty much the same procedure, although
now you start things off by clicking and holding the Output selector instead.
Logic Pro has slightly different procedures for assigning your inputs and 
outputs:
1. In the Arrange window, click the track whose inputs and outputs you
want to assign.
The track becomes highlighted, and the track’s channel strip appears on
the left side of the window.
2. Within the I/O section of the track’s channel strip (located directly
above the track’s fader on the left side of the Arrange window), click
and hold on the Input selector until the Input contextual menu pops up.

Chapter 10: Recording and Editing Audio

3. While still holding down your mouse button, move the mouse over the
Input menu until it rests on the input listing you want, as shown in
Figure 10-8.
4. Release the mouse button to select the input listing.
The Input menu closes, and the input you’ve selected appears in the
Input selector.
Assigning your track’s output follows the same basic procedure, although
now you click and hold the Output selector in Step 2 instead.
Preparing to Record
I’m sure you’re just itchin’ to click the Record button and start getting your
ideas into your computer. Before you can do this, however, you need to cover
some basics, such as enabling your tracks to record and setting proper levels.
There’s also a few more things you can do to make sure that you not only get
your best possible performance, but also make the inevitable editing and
mixing easier — things like creating a monitor mix and developing a song map.
This section covers these details.
Enabling recording
For many computer audio applications, you need to enable recording in a
track before you can hear the input source through your system.
Make sure that your instruments are plugged into your interface before you
enable recording. I like to keep the volume off or set very low before enabling
recording so that when I play my instrument it doesn’t overload the system.
You can turn up the volume when you have your track enabled.

Part IV: Revving Up the Recording Process 

Enabling a track for recording (the audio buzzword is record-enabling) is usu-
ally pretty easy: In Pro Tools and Logic Pro, for example, all you need to do is
click the handy Record Enable button (labeled R) for that track. Figure 10-9
shows the Record Enable button in Pro Tools (left) and Logic Pro (right).
After clicking, the button blinks a nice shade of red.
Depending on your recording application, your track will either stay enabled
for recording when you click another track’s Record Enable button (in Logic
Pro, for example) or it won’t stay enabled (enable will turn off) when you click
the Record Enable button on another track. (Pro Tools takes the “enable will
turn off” route unless you hold down Shift as you enable additional tracks for
recording.)
Make sure that you understand how this whole enabling business works in
your particular recording program. Check (and double-check) your applica-
tion’s manual to see how it treats this process. I can’t tell you how depressing
it is when you think you’ve recorded a track only to discover that, in fact, it
wasn’t enabled. I’ve lost some really good takes (performances) this way.
When your track is enabled for recording, you should be able to hear (and
see in your track’s channel strip window) a signal when you play your instru-
ment. If you can’t see or hear anything, you need to check the following:
 Is your instrument plugged in?
 Is the track you’ve record-enabled set for the correct input and output?
 Are the volume controls on each of your pieces of gear (the guitar and
the interface, for example) turned on at least a little?

Chapter 10: Recording and Editing Audio

 If you’re recording with a condenser mic, is the phantom power — the low
level of current necessary to get the microphone to produce a signal —
turned on in your interface or external preamp?
 Are your monitors or headphones plugged in and the monitor or main
output level on your interface turned up?
If you don’t get a signal even after making sure that these conditions are met,
go to the Hardware Setup window and make sure that your interface is dis-
played in the window and is selected. (In Logic Pro, choose Audio➪Audio
Hardware and Drivers, and in Pro Tools choose Setups➪Hardware Setup.)
Setting recording levels
Setting the proper levels for recording is crucial if you want to record your
music successfully. If you set your level too high, you get distortion; too low
and you might end up with a weak signal that lacks fidelity. I discuss how to
get your instrument levels into and through all your hardware at their proper
levels in Chapter 9, so if you’re not sure how to get your levels right, check
back there. I’ll wait here.
Hardware levels all set up? Now you need to adjust the most important level of
all — the level going into your software. This level is displayed in the channel
strip of your record-enabled track. (Figure 10-10 shows this channel strip in Pro
Tools (left) and Logic Pro (right) when a level is coming into your system.)
For most computer-based recording systems, this is the only level that you
can actually see as well as hear because most interfaces don’t have input
meters on them.
After you can both hear your instrument’s signal and see it in the channel
strip, you can make the final adjustments to your level until you get a good,
hot (substantial) level without going over. This level is adjusted from outside
the computer. That means tweaking your interface and messing with your
other hardware — you know, twirling the knobs on the electric guitar, experi-
menting with mic placement, playing with your external preamp level, and so
on. The fader in your software on your computer controls only the output
volume of the track. Turning it up or down affects how loud the signal is to
your ears, but it doesn’t change the level going into your system.
Make your level adjustments on your hardware and leave the fader in your
software set at unity gain (0 on some systems). (Refer to Figure 10-10 to see
a fader set at this level in both Pro Tools (left) and Logic Pro (right) if you’re
not sure where unity gain is.)
202
Part IV: Revving Up the Recording Process 

The meter in your enabled track’s channel strip should peak at –12dB to –10dB.
Many programs — Logic Pro, for example — have a Peak Level display at the
top of the meter that shows you the highest level achieved by the meter. Keep
an eye on this as you set you levels. If your level gets too high and you reduce
the gain into your system to compensate for that, you can then click the Peak
Level display to zero it out again.
When you set your levels, set them a little on the low side because the ten-
dency when recording is to get slightly nervous (okay, some people get really
nervous), and this often results in playing that’s a little louder. This is espe-
cially the case with vocalists. It’s not uncommon for me to set the level as low
as –18dB to –20dB for vocalists to start with.
Monitoring your inputs
The difference between a decent performance and a truly stellar one is based
on inspiration. An inspired artist can perform at a level beyond his or her
imagination. This is when magic happens. Well, when you have a set of head-
phones on and you’re trying to record your ideas, you sometimes need a

Tools, left,

203
Chapter 10: Recording and Editing Audio

little extra push to get the inspiration faucet turned on. The best way to do
this is to make sure that what you hear in your headphones as you play actu-
ally makes you want to play — and play better. You need to confront two
issues when using a computer-based system:
 Getting the latency down to a manageable size.
 Creating an inspirational monitor mix.
The following two sections lay out how to accomplish both of these goals.
Getting a handle on latency
Latency, as I say a few times in this book, is the delay caused by the analog
signal turning into digital bits and back into an analog signal so you can hear
it. If your latency levels are high, what you hear in your headphones is going
to sound out of sync with what you want to play — which can really mess up
your mind (and more than likely your ability to play well). Latency is the
Achilles heel of computer-based recording for many people.
Because this has been an area of concern, makers of both the hardware and
software used for computer recording have spent a lot of time trying to fix
this problem. Because of this, several approaches exist for reducing the
latency in your system — each with its own advantages and disadvantages.
These approaches are
 Get a faster computer. A fast computer allows you to use the lowest
possible I/O or Hardware buffer settings. Lower buffer settings mean
lower latency. (Chapter 8 has more on buffer settings).
 Record at a higher sampling rate. Because latency is determined by
the total number of samples taken, increasing the sample rate of your
recordings reduces that actual time of the latency. For example, when
you use a 64-sample buffer setting and record at 96 kHz (the highest rate
many interfaces can handle right now), your latency within your system
drops in half.
 Use the software’s Low Latency or Software monitoring options. Using
one of these options can reduce latency a bit because you’re monitoring
off the software and not the hard drive. This can reduce latency to
pretty low levels. One disadvantage with this option is that you might
not be able to add any effects to your tracks and hear them while you
record. This can make for a less-than-inspiring monitor mix.
 Use the hardware’s Direct Monitoring option. Most audio interfaces have
some sort of direct-monitoring option. That is, they split the incoming
signal so that it is sent through the converters and on to the computer
while sending the signal at the same time to the output monitor of the
204
Part IV: Revving Up the Recording Process 

interface. While this is happening, the previously recorded tracks in your
system are sent to your monitors with the unconverted signal, giving you
a mix of the input signal and the previously recorded tracks in your head-
phones. This reduces the latency of your input signal down to effectively
zero.
One problem with this approach is that you can’t add any effects to the
instrument that you’re recording. (You can hear any effects placed on
previously recorded tracks, though.) You can fix this by using an exter-
nal effects box for monitoring purposes.
 Use an external mixer or monitoring unit. This approach is similar to
using the direct monitoring option available on most interfaces. The
only problem beyond those that come standard with direct monitoring
is that you add another piece of hardware to your signal chain that, if it’s
not of high quality, will compromise the sound of your instrument. Also,
if you use any of the preamps and such in your audio interface for your
instruments, it’s all but impossible to insert one of these units in the
signal chain. To be honest, I recommend skipping the external mix/moni-
toring unit and going with one of the other options instead. It’s just not
worth the hassle.
Creating an inspirational monitoring mix
A monitor mix refers to an initial mix of tracks that you use as the foundation
for adding more tracks. You could keep a monitor mix pretty bare bones —
no effects, no prettifying whatsoever — but I recommend putting some effort
into creating a monitor mix that actually sounds good.
To me, a good monitoring mix is one of the most important parts of the
recording process. If you can make your voice, for instance, sound like you
can actually sing (I know this is a stretch for many people), you’ll be more
likely to give the vocal a little extra and maybe end up surprising yourself
when you listen to your performance. Here are some things you can do to
make a monitor mix that encourages you to sound your best:
 Add some effects. Most vocalists love to hear some reverb on their
vocals when they sing. Depending on the monitoring scheme you choose
(see the preceding section), you might be able to do this within your
software program. (Chapter 15 explains how to insert an effects plug-in
into a track.)
 Create a pleasing balance. Take a few minutes to get a good mix of the
tracks that you already have recorded so that it sounds as much like a
complete song as possible. If you don’t take the time to get a good moni-
tor mix up front, you might end up wasting time when you have to re-
record an uninspired part.
205
Chapter 10: Recording and Editing Audio

 Mute distracting parts. If any instruments distract you from the part
you’re trying to record (a counter melody to your guitar solo, for exam-
ple), don’t be afraid to turn them down or off in your mix. Use only the
parts that make you play better.
 Get quality headphones. Because you’ll often be wearing headphones
when you record, I highly recommend that you get a decent pair — ones
that you like the sound of because yucky-sounding headphones aren’t
very inspiring.
Following these tips will make the recording process much more enjoyable
for you (and for your listeners when they finally hear your music).
Creating a click track
A click track is a metronome that you can listen to while you record — it
ensures that you stay in time with the session. Recording to a click track can
have many advantages, including being able to match the song’s sections to
particular bars or beats within the session. It also makes finding edit points
and performing certain edits much easier. I always spend a few minutes set-
ting up a click track for my songs, and I recommend that you give it a try, too.
All audio recording programs have some sort of metronome function. And all
these programs have a way to create a click track within your system. Some
are easy and some are, well, less intuitive. To help you out, I offer the basic
steps for creating a click track and getting it to sound right in the two popular
programs that I detail throughout this book — Pro Tools and Logic Pro.
The first thing you need to do before setting up your click track is open the
dialog box that has the tempo/time signature data on it. Here’s how you do it:
1. Make sure the Transport window is showing in your song.
In Pro Tools, choose Windows➪Show Transport; in Logic Pro, choose
Windows➪Open Transport if the Transport window isn’t already showing.
2. Open the MIDI/Time signature section of the Transport window. 
In Pro Tools, choose Display➪Transport Window Shows➪MIDI Controls.
In Logic, click the drop-down list arrow on the far-right side of the
Transport window to open the Transport View Options menu. Select
Tempo/Signature Display from the list. The tempo/time signature is dis-
played, as shown in Figure 10-11.
You’re ready to start setting up your click track.
206
Part IV: Revving Up the Recording Process 

Setting the tempo
To set the tempo in these programs, follow these steps:
In Pro Tools:
1. With the little Conductor icon engaged — it’s blue — double-click the
Time Signature icon (labeled 4⁄4, as shown in Figure 10-11) or choose
Windows➪Show Tempo/Meter.
The Tempo/Meter Change dialog box appears.
2. Select Tempo Change from the drop-down list.
The Tempo tab of the Tempo/Meter Change dialog box appears.
3. On the Tempo tab, enter the data you want for your tempo.
This includes the location (enter 1/1/000 to set it at the beginning of the
song), the tempo, the resolution (the note duration getting one beat,
such as 1⁄4 note), and whether the tempo starts at the beginning of the
bar (called Snap to Bar).
4. Click the Apply button to accept these settings and close the dialog box.
You now have a tempo for your song.
In Logic Pro:
1. Use the Transport window or the Timeline to go to the location in
your song where you want the tempo to begin.
Double-click the Stop button in the Transport window to get to the start
of your song or click and drag along the Timeline (the numbers at the
top of the Arrange window) to go to another location. You can also let

Chapter 10: Recording and Editing Audio

the song play until it reaches the point where you want the tempo change
to start and just stop the song there. Logic Pro puts the starting point for
the tempo change wherever your song cursor is located, so make sure it’s
where you want it before you set the tempo.
2. Double-click the Tempo field in the Transport window to highlight it.
In Figure 10-11, shown earlier, the Tempo field in Logic Pro’s Transport
window is showing 120.
3. Type in the tempo value you want for your song and press Return or
Enter to accept it.
Choosing the time signature
Setting up a time signature (meter) for your click track is similar to setting
the tempo. The basic steps are outlined in this section.
In Pro Tools:
1. Double-click the time signature icon (labeled 4⁄4, as shown earlier in
Figure 10-11) or choose Windows➪Show Tempo/Meter.
The Tempo/Meter Change dialog box appears.
2. Select Meter Change from the drop-down list.
The Meter Change tab of the Tempo/Meter Change dialog box appears.
3. On the Meter Change tab, enter the data you want for your time 
signature.
This includes the location (enter 1/1/000 to set it at the beginning of the
song), the meter, the click (the note duration getting the click from the
metronome, such as 1⁄4 note), and whether the meter change starts at
the beginning of the bar (called Snap to Bar).
4. Click the Apply button to accept these settings and close the window.
You now have a time signature for your song.
In Logic Pro:
1. Use the Transport window or the Timeline to go to the location in
your song where you want the meter change to begin.
Click the Stop button in the Transport window twice to get to the start
of your song or click-drag along the Timeline (the numbers at the top of
the Arrange window) to go to another location. You can also let the song
play until it reaches the point where you want the meter change to start
and just stop the song there. Logic puts the starting point of the meter
change wherever your song cursor is located so make sure it’s where
you want it before you set the meter change.
208
Part IV: Revving Up the Recording Process 

2. Double-click the numerator (top number) of the time signature in the
Transport window to highlight it.
In Figure 10-11, the time signature in Logic’s Transport window is show-
ing 4/4.
3. Type in the beats per measure value you want for your song and press
Return or Enter to accept it.
4. Double-click the denominator (bottom number) of the time signature
in the Transport window to highlight it.
5. Type in the note division for the measure you want for your song and
press Return or Enter to accept it.
6. Double-click the subdivision value (the note value that the measure is
divided into) of the time signature (this is marked as 16 in Figure 10-11,
shown earlier) in the Transport window to highlight it.
7. Type in the subdivision value you want for the measure.
This tells the click how many times each measure to play. For example,
entering 16 tells the click track to play at 16th note intervals.
You now have your time signature set up for your click track.
Getting your click track to play
If you want to get your click track rolling and you’re working with Logic Pro,
just do the following:
1. In the Transport window, click and hold the little Metronome icon
and choose Metronome Settings from the pop-up menu that appears.
The Metronome Settings section of the Song Settings dialog box opens
up, as shown in Figure 10-12, where you can choose various settings for
your click track.
2. Select the Klopfgeist check box (located in the upper-right corner on
the Metronome Settings tab) to enable the internal metronome.
Note: You have to enable the internal metronome before you can actu-
ally use it.
3. Close the dialog box by clicking OK.
Your metronome settings are saved.
4. In the Transport window, click once again on the Metronome icon to
highlight it (it glows blue).
Your metronome is turned on and will play when your song starts.
209
Chapter 10: Recording and Editing Audio

To turn off the metronome, click the Metronome icon to deselect it.
Contrast this relatively simple procedure with the way you get a click track
going in Pro Tools.
Start by configuring your click track device. Follow these steps:
1. Choose MIDI➪Click Options or double-click the Click button or the
Countoff button in the Transport window.
The Click/Countoff Options dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 10-13.
2. Set when your click track plays by selecting one of the three options
at the top of the dialog box.
The default is During Play and Record. This is usually where I leave it.
However, if the click track is distracting when you play back your track,
you might prefer the Only During Record option.
3. In the Click/Countoff Options dialog box, click the Output drop-down
list to select the device that will play your click track.
Choose None to use the click plug-in. The alternative is to select a MIDI
device such as a drum machine. I’d go with the click plug-in because it’s
simple and it’s included with Pro Tools so you don’t have to buy any
separate gear in order to use it.

Part IV: Revving Up the Recording Process 

4. Adjust the pitch and/or the volume of your click by filling in the note
(for pitch) and/or velocity (for volume) fields in the middle of the
window.
5. Designate the duration of each click in the Duration field.
Increasing or decreasing the duration of the click can be helpful if you
use a different sound (such as an external keyboard or a soft-synth)
that’s hard to hear with the default setting. If you use the click plug-in,
the default setting works just fine.
6. Enter the countoff amount in the Countoff field at the bottom of the
dialog box and select or deselect the check box to the left.
If you want the countoff to play only when you record, select the check
box. If you want the countoff to play during both record and playback,
make sure that the check box is deselected.
Next you need to insert the click plug-in into an Auxiliary Input track. Follow
these steps:
1. Create a new auxiliary track by choosing File➪New Track or by press-
ing Shift+Ô+N (on a Mac) or Shift+Control+N (on a PC).
The New Track dialog box makes an appearance.
2. Use the three drop-down lists to set up a single Mono Aux Input track.
3. Click the Create button.
Your track appears in the Edit and Mix windows.
Figure 10-13:
The
Click/Count

menu lets

211
Chapter 10: Recording and Editing Audio

4. In either the Edit or Mix window, use the Input drop-down list for
your new track to select any one of your hardware inputs.
5. Using the Output drop-down list for your new track, set your output to
the main stereo outputs of your session.
6. Display your inserts options by choosing Displays➪Mix Window
Shows➪Inserts.
The Inserts section for each channel strip appears in the Mix window.
7. Choose Click Plug-in from the Inserts drop-down list for the track you
just created.
The Click Plug-in dialog box opens. Here you can choose the volume for
your accented and unaccented notes. Adjust them to taste, then close
the window by clicking the Close button in the upper-left corner.
Wait, you’re not done yet. You still have to enable the click track. This part is
easy and can be done a couple ways:
 Choose MIDI➪Click.
 Click the Click button in the MIDI section of the Transport window.
When Click is engaged, this button is blue.
Okay, now you’re ready to hear the click track when you play your song.
Hitting the Record Button
At last, the moment you’ve been waiting for: recording your music. This is the
easy part. Well, at least the computer end of it is easy — you still have to
create the performance of your life (no pressure).
Recording your first take
With your track record enabled, you can get to the business at hand. (If
your track is not enabled yet, simply click the Record Enable button for
your track — see the “Preparing to Record” section earlier in this chapter for
details.) Because this is your first take, you probably want to start recording
from the very start of the song. You have several ways of doing this, depend-
ing on your recording program. In Logic Pro, click the Stop button in the
Transport window. (If the song is playing, you need to double-click the Stop
button.) In Pro Tools, click the Zero Return button in the Transport window.
212
Part IV: Revving Up the Recording Process 

To start recording:
1a. In Logic Pro, click the Record button.
Your session kicks into gear.
or
1b. In Pro Tools, click the Record button, and then click the Play button.
Your recording session starts.
2. Click the Stop button to stop recording. 
Your session stops.
How’d ya do? If you’re not sure, you can play your track back to hear your
performance. The following section details how to do this. If you know you
messed up and want to fix a part or two, check out the “Punching in and out”
section later in this chapter. If your performance was perfect, well, then con-
gratulations; now you can go to the “Doing overdubs” section later in this
chapter to add some more tracks.
Listening to your take
To hear what you’ve recorded (called your take), all you have to do is disen-
gage the Record Enable button in the track you just recorded and click the
Play button. You can adjust the volume level of your playback with the fader
for the track in your software.
Some programs — Pro Tools would be an example — allow you to hear your
take while your track is still record-enabled. If you have Pro Tools and you’d
like to monitor your tracks this way, you just need to make sure that you
have the Auto Input monitoring option selected in the Operations menu at
the top of your screen.
Punching in and out
Punching in and out is the process of re-recording a section of your track,
thus replacing the original take with a new one. Punching in and out (often
simply referred to as punching) is a mainstay of the multitrack recording
process. In the bad old days of tape-based recording, punching in and out of
a track to make corrections was a touchy process. Some tape decks could
handle a tight punch (one where you have little room for error), but others
213
Chapter 10: Recording and Editing Audio

were, to put it nicely, not as well calibrated. (Okay, they were sloppy and frus-
trating to use.)
This isn’t the case with computer-based recording systems. In fact, the power
of nearly all the audio recording programs available for punching makes it a
joy to use. You also get lots of options when it comes to how you can punch.
The following sections spell out the Big Three — Manual, Auto, and Loop.
Manual punching
Manual punching is where you play your song, manually press the Record
button when you want to start the punch, and manually press the Stop button
when you’re done. (I wondered why it was called manual.) This is the old-
fashioned way of punching that only really works if you have lightning-fast
hands for mashing buttons.
I honestly don’t know many home recordists who use this approach, for the
simple reason that, when you’re both engineer and the artist (as most home
recordists are), it’s darned difficult to do the punch and get ready to play
without making a mistake.
Auto punching
Auto punching is the process of letting your computer do the punching in
and out for you. This requires telling your recording program (Pro Tools or
Logic Pro, for example) when to punch in and out.
Before you create your Start and End points for a punch, you need to decide
where these points are going to be. To make this decision, you most likely need
to play the track back to find the exact point where you want to punch — and
then write down the coordinates, whether it be in bars and beats, minutes and
seconds, or frames. If you’re not sure how to do this, the “Listening to your
take” section earlier in this chapter gives you the details on this process.
In Pro Tools, you can set up Auto punching one of several ways, but one of
the easiest ways is to do it is by using the Transport window. Here’s how:
1. Select the Expanded view option of the Transport window by choos-
ing Displays➪Transport Window Shows➪Expanded.
2. Click in the Start text box in the Basic Controls section of the Transport
window and type in the beginning of the punch section you want.
The Start text box appears in the same format as the Main counter located
at the top of the Edit window. In the case of Figure 10-14, it shows bars and
beats. You might also have the options for minutes and seconds or for
frames and subframes.
214
Part IV: Revving Up the Recording Process 

3. Press Enter or Return.
4. Click in the End text box and type in the end of the range.
This text box, too, appears in the format selected for the main counter.
5. Press Enter or Return.
You’re now ready to perform a punch. Check out the “Performing the
punch” section, later in this chapter, for steps on how to actually per-
form the punch.
In Logic Pro, do the following to set up Auto punching:
1. Start by clicking and holding the arrow in the lower-left corner of the
Transport window.
The Transport Views pop-up menu appears.
2. Select the Locator Display check box on the Transport Views pop-up
menu.
The locator fields appear.
3. Click in the Start Point field in the Transport window and type in the
Start point you want, as shown in Figure 10-15.
This text box is displayed in the same format as the main counter. In the
case of Figure 10-15, the format is bars and beats.
4. Press Enter or Return.
5. Click in the End Point text box and type in your desired value.
This, too, is displayed in the format selected for the main counter.
6. Press Enter or Return.
7. Click the Autodrop button in the Transport window to engage the
auto punch function. (In Figure 10-15, the button has the icon with two
arrows — one facing down and one facing up — positioned over a bar.)
Figure 10-14:

and End

text boxes.
215
Chapter 10: Recording and Editing Audio

To make the punch itself a bit easier, I recommend that you set a pre-roll. A
pre-roll is a designated number of bars before the punch actually happens
that your song starts playing from. This allows you to get into the groove of
the song before you actually have to record. To create a pre-roll in your song,
follow these steps:
In Pro Tools:
1. Choose Displays➪Transport Window Shows➪Expanded View.
The Pre-Roll and Post-Roll text boxes appear beneath the basic trans-
port controls.
2. Click in the Pre-Roll Counter text box in the Transport window and
type in the length you want, as shown in Figure 10-16.
This text box is displayed in the same format as the main counter. In the
case of Figure 10-16, the format is bars and beats.
3. Press Enter or Return.
4. Click in the Post-Roll Counter text box and type in your desired value.
This value, too, is displayed in the format selected for the main counter.
5. Press Enter or Return.
6. Click the Pre-Roll and/or Post-Roll button in the Transport window to
enable them. (The buttons are to the left of the counter text boxes that
you used in Steps 2 and 4.)
All enabled buttons are highlighted.

Part IV: Revving Up the Recording Process 

Logic Pro doesn’t have pre- and post-roll text boxes. Instead, you can start
playing your song anywhere before your punch-in point by simply clicking
along the timeline (the location numbers at the top of the Arrange window).
Instead of a post-roll, the song continues playing until you click the Stop
button in the Transport window. (Note that recording itself stops at your 
designated End point.)
Performing the punch
Once you have set the Start and End points for your punch as well as your
pre-roll and post-roll, you can record to that section using the standard edit-
ing features of your audio recording program. In Pro Tools, for example,
you’d do the following: 
1. Choose either Non-Destructive or Destructive Record mode. 
Non-destructive record mode is the default mode and is active if you
have a Record button without any icon in it. The Destructive Record
mode is selected from the Operations menu (Choose Operations➪
Destructive Record from the main menu). When you have this mode
selected a small “D” is visible in the center of the Record button in the
Transport window.
Only use the Destructive Record mode if you’re really sure you don’t
want to keep the previous take in the selected section.
2. Click the Record Enable button for the track you want to record onto. 
The button will shine red. 
3. Click the Record button. 
The Record light flashes red.
4. Click the Play button when you’re ready to record.
The session will start at the pre-roll time, the Record button will flash
red, and you’ll hear the previously recorded track until the pre-roll is
over. The monitoring will switch to the input source and the Record light
stops flashing — but remains red.
When you hit the end of the recording range, the session either stops playing
or — if you have the post-roll enabled — stops recording. At that point, the
Record button starts flashing again — and the monitoring switches back to
the recorded region until the end of the post-roll period. When the session
reaches that point, it stops playing.
Loop punching
Loop punching is basically an Auto punch that repeats until you press the
Stop button. This allows you to do multiple takes of a section until you get it
217
Chapter 10: Recording and Editing Audio

right. The process of setting up the Start and End points of the loop are the
same as for Auto punching. The only difference here is you have to select the
Loop Record mode before doing the punch. This is done by:
1. Record-enabling the track you want to punch in and out of.
The “Enabling recording” section earlier in this chapter lays out how to
do that.
2. Engage the loop recording function (most audio recording programs
have one).
In Pro Tools, choose Operations➪Loop Recording. In Logic Pro, click the
Loop icon in the Transport window.
3. Set the Start and End points.
Check out the preceding section for specifics.
4. Click the Play button for your track.
This starts the session. After the track reaches the Start point, your song
automatically starts recording until you reach the End point, where you
are instantly brought back to the Start point (or the pre-roll — see the
Tip icon in the “Auto punching” section for details) so you can go over
the section again. This process keeps repeating until you get it right —
or until you give up and settle for what you can get.
5. Click the Stop button in the Transport window to stop the loop record-
ing process.
Depending on your choice of audio recording programs, these recorded loops
show up in your session a number of ways. In Pro Tools, for example, each
repetition through the loop shows up as a separate playlist in your track. In
Logic Pro, the takes are each placed into a new track in your session.
Doing overdubs
Overdubbing is the process of recording additional tracks to the ones you’ve
already put down. This process is at the core of what most home recordists —
who act as engineer, producer, songwriter, guitar player, drummer, bassist, key-
boardist, and so on — do day by day. Most people can play only one instru-
ment at a time, so unless you’ve got a band at your beck and call you’re going
to have to record each instrument in its own pass. Luckily, this process is
simple: Follow the steps to record your first take for the new track, and then
create a monitor mix that makes it easy (or at least easier) to play and record
your other instruments correctly and with feeling. For details on creating a
monitor mix, check out the “Monitoring your inputs” section earlier in this
chapter.
218
Part IV: Revving Up the Recording Process 

Editing Audio
Being able to make edits to a recorded performance has long been an impor-
tant part of the multitrack recording process. Early tape-based recording sys-
tems required a deft hand and an acceptance of many limitations on what
editing you could perform. The introduction of computer-based recording
means that changing your recorded audio is now easy.
Some programs make editing audio easy — Pro Tools is an obvious example —
whereas some programs require a little more finesse on the part of the user —
Logic Pro, anyone? No matter which program you use, however, you’re going to
discover quite a few options for manipulating your tracks in ways that were
unheard of when using tape.
Regardless of the specifics involved in making edits, some commonalities
exist when it comes to using a computer to edit audio. These are
 Selecting audio to edit: Audio is represented visually in your recording
program and can be selected for editing in a number of different ways.
You can find a variety of different selection tools in most audio programs
for making your selections.
 Editing regions: Regions are sections of your recorded audio. Editing
regions involves taking sections of an audio file and moving them around
in your song. In most audio programs, editing regions doesn’t change the
actual audio recorded in your computer — it simply changes the way your
program plays it back within your song. Most programs allow you to save
this region as its own unique audio file without altering the original file.
 Editing audio data: Editing audio data means changing the audio data
that you’ve recorded. This alters the original audio file.
The upcoming sections examine these commonalities in a bit more detail.
Selecting audio to edit
The first step in editing audio is selecting what you want to edit. Making a
selection in an audio recording program is very similar to making a selection
in any computer program: Click and drag your mouse over the section you
want, and then release the mouse. (See Figure 10-17.)
219
Chapter 10: Recording and Editing Audio

This type of procedure is pretty handy and is just the thing for a lot of simple
procedures, such as selecting a section of a vocal that has some silence
before and after it. But if you want to make more precise selections, such as
fixing a single drum hit or editing a bad guitar note, you’re going to need to
fall back on more precise tools and features. Fortunately, most audio record-
ing programs offer some very cool features and tools to help you select the
exact audio you want to edit.
Because Pro Tools is the undisputed heavy-weight champion of editing audio,
I list some ways that you can select material by using this program. If editing
audio is important to you, make sure that whatever program you’re consider-
ing for your studio can perform these tasks at least as easily.
Selecting an entire track
In Pro Tools, you can select all the regions in a track one of two ways:
 Triple-click one of the regions in the track.
 Click in the track with the Selector tool and choose Edit➪Select All or
press Ô+A on a Mac or Ctrl+A on a PC.
You call up the Selector tool by clicking the Selector button located at the top
of the Edit window.
Selecting on the fly
You can make selections while your session is playing by using the arrow
keys. Follow these steps:
1. Engage the Link Edit and Timeline Selection button or choose
Operations➪Link Edit and Timeline Selection. Alternatively, you can
engage the Edit and Timeline Link button in the upper-right of the
Edit window.
The button becomes highlighted.
Figure 10-17:
Selecting
audio to edit
is as simple
as dragging
over the
section you
want to edit.
220
Part IV: Revving Up the Recording Process 

2. Click the track somewhere before the place you want to start your
selection.
This is where the session will start playing back. If you want to select a
point near the beginning of the session, you can skip this step and just
start playing from the beginning.
3. Either click Play in the Transport window or press the spacebar to
start playing the session.
4. Press the down-arrow key when your playback reaches the point
where you want the selection to begin.
5. Press the up-arrow key when your playback reaches the point where
you want the selection to end.
6. Click the Stop button in the Transport window or press the spacebar
to stop the session.
To scroll back to the selection Start point, press the left-arrow key; to scroll
to the selection End point, press the right-arrow key.
Making a selection with the Tab to Transients function
Transients are the initial attack in an instrument. In Pro Tools, you can move
from one transient in a region to another by engaging the Tab to Transients
button and pressing the Tab key. This is one of the most useful functions in
Pro Tools for editing, and it’s the main reason that I use this program for
audio editing. Tabbing to transients lets you quickly find the exact beginning
of a phrase to edit. To use this function to choose Start and End points for a
selection, do the following:
1. Enable the Tab to Transients button.
The button here in the margin shows you what to look for.
2. Make sure that you have the Edit and Timeline Selection option
enabled by selecting the Link Edit and Timeline Selection check box
on the Operations main menu at the top of your screen or engaging
the Edit and Timeline Link button.
3. Using the Selector tool, click in the audio track somewhere before the
Start point of the area you want to select.
4. Press Tab repeatedly to move from transient to transient until you get
to the Start point.
If you go too far, you can back up by pressing Ctrl (on a PC) or Option
(on a Mac) when you press Tab.
5. Press Shift as you tab through the transients to the End point.
If you go too far, you can back up the End point by pressing
Shift+Ctrl+Tab (on a PC) or Shift+Option+Tab (on a Mac).
221
Chapter 10: Recording and Editing Audio

Editing regions
Regions are visual representations of your audio within your song file. These
are the waveform blocks you see in the Arrange window in Pro Tools (see
Figure 10-18, top) and Logic Pro (see Figure 10-18, bottom). These regions can
be sliced and diced, shuffled, deleted, copied, and pasted, to name but a few
of the things you can do with them when you have them selected. (See the
preceding section for all the selection stuff.)
Being able to edit these regions without altering your original audio file lets
you take sections of your performances and move them around at will. For
example, say you have drum performance that you like for the first verse that
you want to use again during the second verse. With a good audio recording
program, you can get this job done in a few simple steps.
Pro Tools does it this way:
1. Select the section you want to duplicate.
Check out the preceding section for directions on how to select material.
Figure 10-18:
Regions are
the visual
representa-
tions of the
audio you
recorded for
your song.
222
Part IV: Revving Up the Recording Process 

2. Separate your selection from the existing region by choosing Edit➪
Separate Region.
You now have three regions: the stuff leading up to the Start point you
selected; the stuff between the Start and End points (the verse, in this
example); and the stuff after the End point of your verse. Your selection —
which is now its own region — is highlighted.
3. Choose Edit➪Copy to make a copy of the selection.
4. Click the Slip icon in the upper-left section of the Edit window to
make sure you’re in Slip edit mode.
In case you’re curious, the other modes are Shuffle, Spot, and Grid. You
don’t want those modes — you want Slip.
5. Click the start of the second verse where you want to put your drum
section.
6. Choose Edit➪Paste to place the first verse into the second.
Your first verse is placed in your track, and your original second verse is
eliminated as a region, but the original audio data is still there if you want
to use it later. The material before and after the place where you put your
selection is turned into two more regions. At this point, your drum track
now has five regions instead of the one it started with. These are: the stuff
from the beginning of the song to the start of the first verse; the first
verse; the stuff between the first and second verse, the second verse
(which now has the same audio data as the first verse); and the material
from the end of the second verse to the end of the song.
Editing regions involves these basic skills and can be done in almost all audio
recording programs. The steps are obviously a little different, but the end
result is the same.
Being able to edit regions like this without changing your original audio data
makes it possible for you to try a variety of different arrangements in your
songs. It also lets you restore your performance to the way they were without
any loss in sound quality. This is called nondestructive editing. In the olden
days of analog recording, by the time you’ve cut up a section of your perfor-
mance you’ve essentially shredded the tape to the point that putting it all
back together again is very difficult. (And even if you are physically able to
do it, you’ll discover that the sound of your track has been compromised to
a great degree.)
Nondestructive editing is the single biggest advantage of computer-based
recording and one that can be abused very easily if you’re not careful. By
being able to cut and paste your performances at will, you might be tempted
to try to make your tracks “perfect” from a technical perspective. The danger
in this is that you run the risk of making your performance soulless. When
223
Chapter 10: Recording and Editing Audio

you start editing regions in your songs, be aware not only of the technical
aspects of what you’re doing, but also of the artistic side. Sometimes the less-
than-perfect performance has the most feel and makes the best artistic state-
ment. I’m a big fan of erring on the side of the artistic over the technical when
it comes to editing regions.
Editing audio data
Aside from being able to edit the regions representing your audio data, you
can edit the audio data itself, if you so choose. Depending on your audio
recording program, you can perform a stunning variety of audio editing oper-
ations. These include such things as:
 Copying data: This makes a copy of your original file.
 Redrawing the waveform: This changes the shape of the sound-wave
that is recorded.
 Stripping silence: This erases a section of your track to get rid of
unwanted noise.
 Normalizing: This changes the volume of your tracks at the data level.
 Quantizing: This adjusts the timing of a section of your data to fit a grid.
 Reversing: This makes a section play in reverse.
Copying your track data
Performing editing operation alters your original audio data file permanently.
Before you do this and end up regretting what you’ve done, make a copy of
your file to work from. This gives you a backup of the original file in case you
don’t like what your edits have done to your music. Every audio program
does backups a little differently. Here’s how it’s done in Pro Tools:
1. Select the region you want to work on.
2. Choose AudioSuite➪Duplicate.
The Duplicate dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 10-19.
Figure 10-19:
The
Duplicate
dialog box.
224
Part IV: Revving Up the Recording Process 

3. Enable the Use in Playlist option on the right; make sure that the
Playlist option (located in the top center) is enabled.
4. Click the Process button at the lower right.
You now a have a copy of the original region — a copy that’s put in the
track in place of the original.
When you have your copy, you can edit at will and not risk losing your origi-
nal data.
Redrawing a waveform
Being able to redraw a waveform lets you get rid of a clipped note (distortion
from overloading the converters in your computer). In Pro Tools, you take
care of this little task with the help of the Zoomer and Pencil tools:
1. Find the area in the region that you want to edit.
2. With the Zoomer tool enabled, click repeatedly on the spot you want
to edit until you get into the sample level.
The waveform looks like a single wavy line. (See Figure 10-20.)
3. Select the Pencil tool.
4. Locate the exact spot to edit.
Your target, typically a moment of distorted sound, is usually easy to see
because it looks like a sharp peak in the waveform. (See Figure 10-21,
left.)
If you have trouble seeing the problem, use the Scrub tool to listen to
the audio.
5. Draw over the waveform to round over the spot that was chopped off
when the note got clipped (as shown in Figure 10-21, right).
Take it easy on making changes to the waveform. All you want to do is
smooth out the peak, not change the sound too much.

Chapter 10: Recording and Editing Audio

Silencing a section of your track
Many times when you record you get unwanted noises on your tracks. These
can include chair squeaks, coughs, loud breathing, and other distractions
during the sections where you don’t play your instrument. The quick-and-
easy way to get rid of these sounds is to silence them at the audio data level.
This saves you from having to use the faders while you mix, and it reduces
the size of the data file on your hard drive, giving you more room for other
things. This process is very easy (in Pro Tools, anyway). Here’s how it’s done:
1. With the Selector tool enabled, click and drag across the section of
the region you want to select.
Note: You access the Selector tool by clicking the Selector button at the
top of the Edit window.
2. Choose Edit➪Insert Silence or press Shift+Ô+E (on a Mac) or
Shift+Ctrl+E (on a PC).

The two preceding editing sections give you a good idea how easy it is to
do some pretty useful editing operations by using a computer-based audio
recording program. I’d love to walk you through how to perform a bunch
of other operations, but I have to pass due to space limitations. (What? No
700-page book?)
I encourage you to look closely at the audio recording software you’re consid-
ering for your studio to see what types of audio editing it can do. Most pro-
grams available can do a lot (probably more than you’re going to do regularly).
I cover the basics of the editing capabilities of the most popular programs in
Chapter 7 insofar as how well they do compared to other programs out there,
so check out that chapter for more insight into this area.

M
IDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) is a digital communication
protocol that allows your MIDI-equipped gear to send information back
and forth through your system. MIDI handles the transmission of performance
and system data; you, in conjunction with your recording program, can then
record, edit, and transform this data into the music you hear in your head.
In this chapter, I introduce you to MIDI recording and editing within a com-
puter program. I offer some basic information about MIDI ports and channels
and help you get your system configured so that you can record MIDI in your
computer. I also walk you through the process of recording your tracks, over-
dubbing, and editing your data. Finally, this chapter offers a brief discussion
of some of the many ways you can manipulate your MIDI data when it’s in
your computer.
Not all recording programs are equal in their implementation of MIDI. Some
programs, such as Logic, are MIDI powerhouses; others, such as Pro Tools,
are of the more minimalist variety. If MIDI recording and editing is important
to you, make sure that you get a program that can do what you want it to do.
Check out Chapter 8 for a look at many of the popular recording programs
available and how they do MIDI.
Making Sense of MIDI
MIDI has been around for a while (about 20 years) and, even though it’s con-
sidered old technology by today’s standards, it’s still employed a lot in music-
making. This section gets you up to speed on the basic concepts of MIDI.

Perusing MIDI ports
Three types of MIDI ports exist: In, Out, and Thru. The In port receives incom-
ing messages, and the Out port sends those messages further on their way.
You use the Thru port when you create a daisy chain, which means you con-
nect more than two MIDI devices together. The Thru port sends the messages
that one device receives directly to the In port of another instrument.
You can connect MIDI gear in various ways by using these three ports, but
for most recordists recording into a computer, a MIDI configuration usually
consists of an external keyboard or controller (Chapter 4 details these pieces
of hardware) connected to a MIDI interface attached to your computer.
Depending on which type of device you use, you make the physical connec-
tion one of two ways:
 By using an external keyboard/synthesizer: An external keyboard is a
keyboard that has MIDI ports in it and produces its own sounds. In this
case, you make the connection by using a MIDI cable plugged into the
Out port of your keyboard which is then plugged into the In port of your
MIDI interface. Your interface is then connected to your computer. How
that connection actually gets made depends on the type of MIDI device
it is. For example, a USB MIDI interface attaches to one of the USB ports
in your computer.
This connection does get the MIDI data into your computer, but if
you want the computer to actually play the sounds located in your 
keyboard — what a concept — you need to make sure that you have a
MIDI cable going from your MIDI interface’s Out port to the In port of
your keyboard.
Also, in order to hear the sound of your keyboard in your computer, you
need to connect the analog outputs from your keyboard to the analog
inputs of your audio interface.
 By using a MIDI controller: Unlike an external keyboard, a MIDI controller
doesn’t contain its own sounds. Instead, you use the controller to trigger
(play) the sounds of software synthesizers in your computer. (Chapter 13
has more on soft-synths.) The connection you make depends on the type
of controller you have. Most external controllers use either USB connec-
tions or MIDI Out ports (many have both). If you use the USB connection,
just plug a USB cable from your controller to your computer. You don’t
need a MIDI cable or other hardware. If you use the MIDI Out port, though,
you do need a MIDI cable and some sort of external MIDI interface.
Understanding MIDI channels
MIDI protocol allows you to have a bunch of different MIDI devices hooked
up at the same time using the same MIDI cables and have them play only the
228
Part IV: Revving Up the Recording Process 

data that you want each device to play. To accomplish this stunning feat, MIDI
uses 16 different channels, where each device is assigned a different channel
and responds only to MIDI messages that are sent along that channel.
If you have an external keyboard and use it to play back more than one MIDI
track at a time, you need to assign a MIDI channel to each track in your song.
I describe this procedure in the “Setting inputs, outputs, and MIDI channels”
section later in this chapter.
Setting Up MIDI in Your Computer
The process of setting up your MIDI device varies according to whether you
use a Mac or a PC. Either way, though, setting up a MIDI device takes only a
couple minutes. This section walks you through the process.
Enabling MIDI devices in Mac OS X
Before you can record MIDI in Mac OS X, you need to do three separate things:
a) set up your MIDI devices in OS X, b) enable the MIDI channels so you can
choose the MIDI channels that each device receives and sends data on, and c)
enable the input devices in your recording software so that you can use those
devices in your computer.
To configure your MIDI devices in OS X, follow these steps:
1. Use your MIDI cables to connect the devices you want to use with your
computer to your MIDI Interface.
Chapter 4 has more on the different types of MIDI interfaces.
2. Click the Audio MIDI Setup icon (see margin) in the Dock.
The Audio MIDI Setup window opens.
3. Click the MIDI Devices tab of the Audio MIDI Setup window.
A message appears telling you that your system is being scanned. After
the scan is complete, your MIDI interface should appear in the tab’s
window, along with any devices connected to it, as shown in Figure 11-1.
4. If any of your devices don’t appear, double-check your cables to make
sure they’re properly connected and then click the Rescan MIDI icon.
5. If your device still doesn’t appear, click the Add Device button.
6. In the dialog box that appears, enter the name, manufacturer, and
model number of the device in the appropriate fields, and then
click OK.
229
Chapter 11: Using MIDI

7. After your devices appear on the MIDI Devices tab of the Audio MIDI
Setup window, close the window by choosing Audio MIDI Setup➪
Quit Audio MIDI Setup.
You can also close this window by pressing Ô+Q or clicking the red X in
the upper-left corner.
After configuring your MIDI devices, you still need to enable their MIDI chan-
nels. The following list shows you how:
1. Click the Audio MIDI Setup icon (see margin) in the Dock.
The Audio MIDI Setup window opens. (Refer to Figure 11-1.)
2. Click the MIDI Devices tab of the Audio MIDI Setup window.
All MIDI devices connected to your MIDI interface should appear in the
tab’s window.
3. In the MIDI Devices tab of the Audio MIDI Setup window, double-click
the device for which you want to activate MIDI channels.
The device window appears.
4. Click the More Properties tab to expand the window.
The window expands to include Basic and Expert tabs containing a
broad range of settings for your device.
5. Click the Basic Tab.
6. In the Transmits and Receives section of the Basics tab, click the chan-
nel number(s) that you want to be able to transmit and receive data
through.
Figure 11-1:

Part IV: Revving Up the Recording Process 

Blue-highlighted channels are active.
7. Click OK to close the device window.
8. Close the Audio MIDI Setup window by clicking the red X in the
upper-left corner or by pressing Ô+Q.
Some recording programs — Pro Tools, for example — add a few steps to this
process because you need to enable the devices in your system within the
program. Here’s how you do it in Pro Tools:
1. Choose MIDI➪Input Devices.
The MIDI Input Enable dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 11-2, dis-
playing all the MIDI ports in your system.
2. Select the check boxes for the devices you want to use.
3. Click OK.
Enabling MIDI devices in Windows XP
Enabling MIDI devices is as easy as adding a printer to your system.
To configure MIDI devices in Windows XP:
1. Install the drivers for your MIDI device as the device’s manual
describes.
If your audio interface has MIDI ports (such as the Digidesign 002), this
step was already done when you installed the software, as I describe in
Chapter 8.
Figure 11-2:
The MIDI
Input Enable
dialog box
lets you
select your
MIDI
devices.
231
Chapter 11: Using MIDI

2. Use your MIDI cables to connect the devices you want to use with your
software to your MIDI interface.
3. Turn on the power for the device.
At this point, your device should show up in your MIDI tracks’ Input and
Output selector pop-up menus. If not, restart your computer. If this still
doesn’t work you, you might need to go into the Device Driver menu and
manually move the driver for your device into the Device Driver folder.
Some programs, such as Pro Tools, require that you enable your input devices
before you can use them in your program. This process is the same for
Windows XP as it is for a Mac. To wit:
1. Choose MIDI➪Input devices.
The MIDI Input Enable dialog box opens, showing the MIDI ports in your
system.
2. Select the check boxes for the devices you want to use.
3. Click OK.
Getting Ready to Record
Setting up MIDI tracks involves first creating the tracks for your session and
then setting the inputs, outputs, and MIDI channels for the tracks you cre-
ated. This section spells out how to do all these tasks.
Creating MIDI tracks
Of course, before you can manipulate a MIDI track, you’ve got to have one.
Creating a MIDI track is a pretty easy task in most recording programs. In Pro
Tools, for example, you just do the following:
1. Choose File➪New Track.
The New Track dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 11-3.
2. Enter the number of tracks you want to create.
3. Select MIDI Track from the middle drop-down list.
4. Click Create.
Your new track(s) appear in both the Edit and the Mix windows.
232
Part IV: Revving Up the Recording Process 

When you create a new track in Pro Tools, the track receives a default name —
something not entirely useful (like MIDI 1). You can rename this track by follow-
ing these steps:
1. Double-click the track name in the Pro Tools Edit window.
The Name Track dialog box appears.
2. Type in the new name and add any comments about the track in the
appropriate places.
3. Click OK to close the window.
Your track gets a — hopefully more helpful — new name.
Some programs — Logic, for example — open with a bunch of MIDI tracks
already created so you don’t have to go through these steps before recording
your MIDI performances.
Setting inputs, outputs, 
and MIDI channels
For MIDI tracks, like with audio tracks, you need to select the input and out-
puts sources for your MIDI data in order to be able to record and play back
your tracks. MIDI tracks differ from audio tracks in that, depending on your
recording program, you might also need to set the MIDI channel(s) through
which the MIDI data for each track travels. Here’s how you do it in a program
like Pro Tools:
1. Choose Display➪Edit Window Shows➪I/O View to open the I/O sec-
tion of the Edit window.
The I/O section shows the inputs and outputs for each track.
Figure 11-3:
The New
Track dialog
box in Pro
Tools lets
you create
new MIDI
tracks.
233
Chapter 11: Using MIDI

2. Within the I/O section of your track in the Edit window, click and hold
on the Input selector until the Input contextual menu pops up.
3. While still holding down your mouse button, move the mouse over the
Input menu until it rests on the MIDI port and channel you want, as
shown in Figure 11-4.
4. Release the mouse button to select your choice.
The Input contextual menu closes your selection appears in the Input
selector.
Choosing your outputs requires pretty much the same procedure, although to
do that you start things off by clicking the Output selector in Step 2 instead.
Logic offers a variety of ways to assign your inputs and outputs. Here’s the
one I use:
1. In the Arrange window, click the track whose inputs and outputs you
want to set.
The track becomes highlighted, and its channel strip appears on the left
side of the window.
2. Within the Subchannel section of the track’s channel strip (located on
the leftmost side of the Arrange window) click and hold on the Port
selector until the MIDI Port menu pops up.
3. While still holding down your mouse button, move the mouse over the
MIDI Port menu until it rests on the MIDI port that you want, as shown
in Figure 11-5.
Figure 11-4:

an input (or

menu.
234
Part IV: Revving Up the Recording Process 

4. Release the mouse button to select your choice.
The menu closes, and your selection appears in the input selector.
Assigning your track’s output follows the same basic procedure, although
you click and hold the Output selector in Step 2.
You use the output of the MIDI track only if you want to send the MIDI data
back out of the computer again to use the sounds contained on an external
keyboard. If you use a software synthesizer, follow the procedures listed in
Chapter 13.
Recording MIDI Performances
Chapter 10 pretty much tells you the basics about recording MIDI 
performances — the process is very similar to recording audio tracks.
The only significant difference is that you can set your system to wait until
it receives MIDI data before starting to record. (This keeps you from having
to press the Record button in the Transport window.) You also have to go
through a few steps so that you can actually hear the sound from your MIDI
device while you record.

235
Chapter 11: Using MIDI

Enabling recording for MIDI tracks
You can record-enable your MIDI tracks the same way you enable recording
for audio tracks. This process is simple: Just click the Record Enable button
(labeled R) for that track. Figure 11-6 shows the Record Enable button in Pro
Tools (left) and Logic (right). After you click it, the button glows red.
As I describe in Chapter 10, how your enabled tracks act when you enable
another track to record depends on your particular recording program. For
example, in Logic your track stays enabled for recording when you click
another track’s Record Enable button, and in Pro Tools the default is that it
doesn’t remain enabled (enable turns off) when you click the Record Enable
button on another track.
This is an important aspect of your recording program to understand. Check
your application’s manual to see how it treats this process. I can’t tell you
how depressing it is to think you’ve recorded a track when, in fact, it wasn’t
record enabled. I’ve lost some really good takes (performances) this way.
Monitoring MIDI inputs
Some recording programs contain internal sounds that allow you to hear
your MIDI performances without having to plug in your external sound
source, such as your synthesizer keyboard. I cover the steps to get sound
from this approach in Chapter 14. Some programs, such as Pro Tools, require
that you connect your external keyboard’s analog outputs to your computer
Figure 11-6:

236
Part IV: Revving Up the Recording Process 

in order to hear what you’re playing. You do this by connecting your key-
board to an analog input in your audio interface and routing the input to an
audio track in your recording program. Here’s the process for Pro Tools:
1. Connect the analog output of your MIDI device to one of the analog
inputs in your Digidesign hardware.
2. Choose File➪New Track.
The New Track dialog box appears.
3. Use the drop-down lists of the dialog box to enter the number of tracks
you want (1), the type (Audio), and whether you want your track in
mono or stereo.
4. Using the new track’s Input selector, select the analog input that your
device is connected to in your Digidesign interface.
5. Using the new track’s Output selector, select the main outputs for 
your session.
See the “Setting inputs, outputs, and MIDI channels” section earlier in
this chapter for more on Steps 4 and 5.
6. Record-enable this track by clicking the Record Enable button in
either the track’s channel strip (Mix window) or the track menu 
(Edit window).
Now you should hear the sound coming out of your MIDI device as
you play your MIDI performance. Yes, it’s an extra track, and it is being
recorded at the same time as your MIDI track. But this I’ve-got-to-hear-
what-I’m-playing track is separate; you can erase it without fear after
you’re done recording the take.
Recording MIDI tracks
After you’ve record-enabled your MIDI track(s) (see the “Enabling recording
for MIDI tracks” section, earlier in this chapter), you can begin recording.
Follow these steps to record one or more MIDI tracks:
1. Click the Record Enable button located in either the track channel
strip (Mix window) or track menu (Edit window) to record-enable 
the track(s).
2. To make sure you’ll hear your music the way you want to hear it, set
the level of the instruments in your session by using the fader for
each audio track associated with your MIDI devices.
The faders are found in the Channel strip located in the Mix window.
237
Chapter 11: Using MIDI

3. Enable the click track and the pre-roll if you’re using them.
See Chapter 10 for more on click tracks and pre-rolls.
4. Click the Return to Zero button in the Transport section of the
Transport window.
Doing so ensures that you start recording at the beginning of the session.
5. Click the Record button in the Transport section of the Transport
window.
This step gets you ready to record; it doesn’t start the actual recording
process.
6. Click the Play button in the Transport section of the Transport
window.
Pro Tools starts recording.
7. When you’re done recording, click the Stop button in the Transport
section of the Transport window or press the spacebar.
The finished take appears in the MIDI Regions list as a new region.
Playing Back Your Tracks
After you record a track, most likely you’ll want to listen to it to make sure
that it sounds the way you want it to sound. You do this by toggling off the
Record Enable button on your MIDI tracks — click it to make the red light 
disappear — and then clicking the Play button. If you routed your external
keyboard to an audio track in order to hear yourself, leave the audio tracks
associated with the MIDI devices in Record-Enable mode. Doing so allows you
to hear the playback of the MIDI device from the recorded MIDI data instead
of hearing the audio that you recorded as a result of monitoring the analog
output of your external keyboard. You can adjust the volume by moving the
fader in the channel strip for the audio track associated with your MIDI
device up and down.
Overdubbing MIDI Performances
After you record some MIDI performances, you can easily add to or change
them. The time-honored name for this kind of recording is overdubbing.
Overdubbing MIDI performance data is similar to overdubbing your audio
data. Most programs allow you to overdub in several ways: manually punch-
ing in and out, punching automatically, and loop punching. In addition,
238
Part IV: Revving Up the Recording Process 

because MIDI is strictly performance information without any actual sound,
most recording programs offer you the ability to either replace or merge
existing MIDI data when you overdub.
Using MIDI Merge/Replace
When you overdub to a MIDI track, many recording programs offer you the
option to either replace existing material or add new data to it. For example,
in Pro Tools you make this selection by using the MIDI Merge/Replace button.
This button is located in the Transport window, as shown in Figure 11-7.
Here’s how it works:
 When the Merge/Replace button is engaged (MIDI Merge mode), new
material is merged with any existing MIDI data on the record-enabled
track(s).
 When the Merge/Replace button is disengaged (MIDI Replace mode),
new MIDI data replaces any existing information on record-enabled
track(s).
To engage MIDI Merge in Pro Tools, do the following:
1. Open the MIDI controls section of the Transport window by choosing
Display➪Transport Window Shows➪MIDI Controls.
The Transport window expands to include the MIDI controls section.
2. Click the MIDI Merge button.
The button becomes highlighted.
Logic has a similar function, but by default any overdubs you do are placed in
a new sequence — leaving the original intact. You do have the choice, how-
ever, of having your overdub replace or merge with existing material. To
merge your overdub, follow these steps:
Figure 11-7:
Add new
data without
erasing

there.
239
Chapter 11: Using MIDI

1. Choose File➪Song Settings➪Recording Options to open the Recording
Options toolbar.
2. Select the Merge New Recording With Selected Sequences option at
the top of the Recording Options toolbar, as shown in Figure 11-8.
3. Click OK to accept the setting and close the window.
Now when you record, your new data is merged with the old.
To replace existing data, follow these steps:
1. Click and hold the arrow at the bottom-right corner of the Transport
window and select either All Elements Horizontal or All Elements
Normal from the pop-up menu that appears.
The Recording Options toolbar appears in the Transport window.
2. Click the Replace button on the Recording Options toolbar to engage
the Replace function, as shown in Figure 11-9.

Part IV: Revving Up the Recording Process 

Punching in and out
If you like some of your initial take and want to record over only part of it,
you can set points at which to start and stop recording within the session.
This is called punching in and out, a process that I cover in some detail in
Chapter 10 — although there I spell out how to punch in and out of audio
tracks.
As is this case with audio tracks, most programs allow you to punch in to
MIDI tracks in several ways. These include punching in and out manually,
automatically, and repeatedly (looping).With the exception of being able to
choose to merge your punched data with your original performance or being
able to replace it, punching into and out of MIDI tracks is the same as punch-
ing into and out of audio tracks. I detail the exact procedures for performing
these punches in Chapter 10.
Editing MIDI Data
MIDI editing has two basic types of functions: You can edit the notes manu-
ally or you can perform certain MIDI operations/functions, such as quantizing
and transposing. This section offers an overview of these different functions.
Manual MIDI editing
Editing your MIDI data manually is a great way to go if you want to do any of
the following tasks:
 Add notes or controller data.
 Delete notes or controller data.
 Change pitch.
 Change duration.
 Change velocity (volume).
 Change time location.
Depending on your recording program, you can make these edits a number of
ways. I describe a simple way to do this in Pro Tools — one of the more basic
MIDI applications — later in this section. Aside from the simple way, many
programs offer a variety of different editing windows to help you work the
way you want. For example, Logic — one of the more powerful MIDI programs
out there — offers several windows. These include:
241
Chapter 11: Using MIDI

 Matrix: No, not that Matrix. This Matrix is the basic window that shows
MIDI data in a piano roll format. (See Figure 11-10.) The MIDI notes show
up as blocks in a timeline that rolls across the screen as your song plays.
This is a standard format for MIDI editing; you find it in most recording
programs.
 Score: The Score window shows your MIDI data in the form of a musical
score. You see the notes laid out as if they were written on paper. The
window is great for people who like to see their music in written form,
but this window isn’t available on all recording programs. (Pro Tools, for
instance, doesn’t yet offer this window in version 6.) Figure 11-11 shows
Logic’s version of this window.
 Hyper Edit: The Hyper Edit window shows your MIDI data in separate
rows, making it easy to adjust parameters such as velocity, modulation,
pan, and others. This window — see Figure 11-12 — is handy for making
more involved changes to your MIDI data — changes other than those
involving pitch, duration, or location. Not all programs have a window
like this.
Adding MIDI events
You can add MIDI notes or controller data (collectively called MIDI events) to
a MIDI track by using one of your program’s editing tools. In Pro Tools, for
example, the editing tool of choice is called the Pencil tool.
Figure 11-10:

Part IV: Revving Up the Recording Process 

To insert a note using the handy Pro Tools Pencil, do the following:
1. Click and hold the Track View button in the Track Controls section of
the Edit Window to access the pop-up menu and then drag to the
Notes view. Release your mouse button to accept this view.
2. Click and hold the Pencil button, and then select the Freehand Pencil
tool from the Pencil Tool pop-up menu that appears.
3. Locate the place in the track’s playlist area where you want to add
your MIDI note.

243
Chapter 11: Using MIDI

4. By using the Pencil tool that you selected in Step 2, click and drag in
the playlist to insert a note.
You determine the pitch of this note by where you place it (from top to
bottom). You can use the small keyboard display on the left side of the
playlist to see what pitch relates to which location in the playlist. To
determine the note’s duration, drag to the right as you draw it. The
velocity of the note defaults to the maximum of 127. (You can change the
velocity later if you choose.)
Because MIDI performance data has no sound, most MIDI-capable recording
programs allow you to add MIDI program change information, which tells
your MIDI instrument to change the sound that it plays. This is called insert-
ing a MIDI program change. Here’s how you do it in a program like Pro Tools:
1. Click and hold the Track View button and select Program Change
view from the menu that appears.
2. Click and hold the Pencil button, and then select the Freehand Pencil
tool from the menu that appears.
3. Click in the track’s playlist at the location you want the change to occur.
The Patch Select dialog box opens. This dialog box lets you select the
sound (called the patch) that your MIDI data plays in your sound module
(soft-synth or external keyboard).
4. Select the patch number or name in the main section of the dialog box.
5. Click Done.
The program change is inserted, as shown in Figure 11-13.
Deleting a MIDI note
To delete a MIDI note in Pro Tools, do the following:
1. Click and hold the Track View button and select Notes from the menu
that appears.
2. Using either the Grabber tool or the Selector tool, select the note in
the playlist you want to delete.
Figure 11-13:

244
Part IV: Revving Up the Recording Process 

3. Press Delete on your keyboard or choose Edit➪Clear.
Instead of Steps 2 and 3 in the preceding list, start out with the Pencil tool.
Then press Alt (on a PC) or Option (on a Mac) to change the pencil into an
eraser, and then click the note to delete it.
Changing a note’s pitch
To change a note’s pitch in Pro Tools, do the following:
1. Click and hold the Track View button and select Notes from the menu
that appears.
2. Select the Pencil or Grabber tool.
3. Press Shift to keep the note’s start point from changing as you move it.
4. Click the note and drag it up (higher pitch) or down (lower pitch) in
the playlist. 
5. Release the mouse button when the note is where you want it.
Changing a note’s duration
To change a note’s duration — its Start or End points — in Pro Tools do the
following:
1. Click and hold the Track View pop-up menu and select Notes from the
menu that appears.
2. Select the Shuffle edit mode by clicking the Shuffle button on the
upper-left side of the Edit window.
3. Select the Pencil tool.
4. Using the Pencil tool, click the note you want to change.
Press Shift as you click to select more than one note.
5. Click the Start or End point of the note and drag it left or right.
6. Release the mouse button when the note is where you want it.
Changing a note’s velocity
In the MIDI world, velocity means volume. To change a note’s velocity in Pro
Tools, do the following:
1. Click and hold the Track View pop-up menu and select Velocity from
the menu that appears.
2. Select the Grabber tool.
245
Chapter 11: Using MIDI

3. Click the diamond-shaped icon at the top of the velocity stalk (the ver-
tical line with a diamond at the top representing the velocity level) in
the track’s playlist and drag it up or down.
4. Release the mouse button when the velocity is where you want it.
Changing time locations
Time locations are where the start points of your notes are placed within
your session. To change a note’s time location in Pro Tools, do the following:
1. Click and hold the Track View pop-up menu and select Notes from the
menu that appears.
2. Select the Slip edit mode by clicking the Slip button on the upper-left
side of the Edit window.
3. Select the Pencil or Grabber tool.
4. Press Shift to keep the note’s pitch from changing as you move it.
5. Click the note and drag it left or right.
6. Release the mouse button when the note is where you want it.
Performing MIDI operations/
editing functions
Most recording programs offer a host of operations you can perform on your
MIDI data to make it sound the way you want it to sound. These functions
vary from program to program, and I can’t list them all here. As an example,
though, a program with arguably the slimmest MIDI capabilities (Pro Tools)
offers the following MIDI operations (Figure 11-14 shows the MIDI Operations
window in Pro Tools):

 Quantize: Lets you adjust the timing of your selected notes.
 Groove Quantize: Similar to the Quantize operation, except you use a
groove template (a file that contains timing data with a specific feel) to
create a grid to quantize to.
 Restore Performance: Lets you return to previously saved performance
settings.
 Flatten Performance: Lets you tweak performance data and lock it in
before you do any more tweaking.
 Change Velocity: Lets you adjust the volume of the attack or the release
of selected MIDI notes.
 Change Duration: Lets you alter the length of recorded MIDI notes.
 Transpose: Lets you change the pitch of selected notes.
 Select Notes: Lets you choose specific MIDI notes or a range of notes in
a selection.
 Split Notes: Lets you select a note or range of notes — but also lets you
copy or cut the selected notes.
 Input Quantize: Lets you set a Quantize value that your recorded perfor-
mance is adjusted to automatically as you record it.

L
oops are pre-recorded musical snippets that you can put in your song
and manipulate to create your music. Looping has become very popular
because it makes composing music easy and saves you from having to learn
to play an instrument well or hire a professional to play for you. (Purists take
note: Looping is here to stay.)
In this chapter, you discover the role of loops in composing music and find
out how to get decent loops to work with. This chapter also shows you how
to create your own unique loops.
Not all recording programs have looping capabilities, and not all those that
do have them offer ways to manipulate the loops in your program the way
you might want. If this function is important to you, make sure that the pro-
gram you buy has the capabilities that you want. Chapter 6 has more about
how programs work with loops, and Chapter 7 looks at the looping capabili-
ties of some of the major recording programs out there.
Understanding Loops
Loops really aren’t that complicated. Think of them as short musical snippets
that you can line up in various ways, and then you have them play in your
song. A typical loop is a drum pattern that plays during the verse of your
song or serves as the bass line of your chorus. In the simplest form of loop-
ing, you assemble your loops — one after another — to fill up the section you
want them to play in. And you can often change the tempo and pitch of your
loops to fit your vision of your song.

On a more sophisticated level, you can manipulate, edit, and create loops in
a variety of ways, depending on the capabilities of your particular recording
program (another reason to investigate the looping capabilities of your pro-
gram before buying).
Loops come in two formats:
 MIDI-based loops are recorded as MIDI data by using soft-synths or gen-
eral MIDI instruments. These loops appear as MIDI data in your track
and can be edited like any other MIDI performance. (Chapter 4 has more
on general MIDI stuff, and Chapter 11 has more about actually editing
MIDI data.)
 Audio-based loops are created from audio files and are seen as wave-
form displays of the audio data. They act just like any other audio file
except that they have a tempo grid and a key signature attached to
them. This means that when you place them in a song, they conform to
the song’s tempo as well as to the designated key signature (if your song
has one).
Not all looping programs can handle MIDI-based loops as MIDI data. Instead,
these loops are treated as audio-based loops. If you’re working with such a
program, you’ll find that the editing capabilities of the loops conform to the
audio format — you can’t change the pitch of individual notes that are part of
a group of notes (a chord, for instance).
Using Loops in Your Song
Using loops is easy — which is why they’re so commonly used. This section
describes how to use them in your song.
Creating a loop track
The type of track you create for your loops depends on the type of loop you
want to use. If you want to use a MIDI-based loop, you need a MIDI track (or
audio instrument track if you use Logic). If you intend to use an audio-based
track, you need to create an audio track. This section describes how to set up
each of these track types.
Making a MIDI-based loop track
In Logic — one of the more robust recording programs in terms of looping
capabilities — the easiest way to make a MIDI-based loop track is to use an
250
Part IV: Revving Up the Recording Process 

audio instrument track. This way you can use a soft-synth to play the loop
and not have to hook up an external MIDI sound module. This is how you
make one:
1. Choose Functions➪Track➪Create from the menu at the top of the
Arrange window, as shown in Figure 12-1. (If the Arrange window
isn’t showing, choose Windows➪Open Arrange.)
A new track appears in your song in the same format (and with the same
name) as the track directly before it.
2. To distinguish the new track from the track above it, assign an audio
instrument to the new track by first clicking and holding the track
name in the Arrange window.
A pop-up menu appears, as shown in Figure 12-2.
3. Drag your mouse to one of the audio instruments in the list.
4. Release the mouse.
Your new track is assigned to the selected audio instrument.
You now have a track for your MIDI-based loops.
In Logic, you can drag a MIDI-based loop into an audio track. If you take this
route, it acts like an audio-based loop instead of a MIDI-based loop. That is,
you aren’t able to edit the individual notes as MIDI data.
Adding an audio-based loop track
The process for creating a new audio track in Logic is the same as for creat-
ing a new audio instrument, except you choose an audio track instead of an
audio instrument (duh).
Figure 12-1:

251
Chapter 12: Using Loops

If all your available audio objects are used in your song, you need to create a
new one. Creating a new track adds an extra step to the process of creating
an audio-based loop track. Here’s how you do it:
1. In the Environment’s local menu (see Figure 12-3), choose New➪
Audio Object. (If the Environment window isn’t open, open it by
choosing Windows➪Environment.)
The Settings Parameter dialog box appears, displaying settings for Icon,
Device, and Channel, to name a few.
2. In the Settings Parameter box, click and hold the arrow in the Channel
Parameter field to open the drop-down menu and select Track➪
Track x. (x is any one of the unbolded tracks that appear in the list.)
3. Release your mouse to accept this selection.
Your new audio object now appears in the Audio Track submenu; you
can choose this new object from the submenu when you create your
new track.
Choosing loops
Most loop-capable programs have a special loop browser function to help
you find the loops you want to use in your song. In Logic, the browser lets
you choose from categories that include the instrument type, musical genre,
and mood. (Figure 12-4 shows the Loop browser in Logic.) Browsers like this
make it easy (or at least easier) to find the loop you want. This is especially
important because most people end up with tons of loops in their libraries.

252
Part IV: Revving Up the Recording Process 

Follow these steps to choose a loop to insert in your song:
1. Click the instrument category you want.
The instrument becomes highlighted, and a list of loops featuring that
instrument appears on the right side of the window. (Figure 12-4 shows
the Drums category selected.)
2. You can narrow your list down a bit further by clicking buttons asso-
ciated with the genre, mood, or style you want.
In Figure 12-4, your options include Rock/Blues, Acoustic, and Dark, to
name a few. The more you specialize your categories, the narrower your
list of loops becomes.

ment’s local

253
Chapter 12: Using Loops

3. Click one of the loops in the list on the right to select it.
In Logic, your chosen loop automatically starts playing, but some pro-
grams require you to click an Audition button (it might look like a speaker
or a play button) to play the loop. To stop the audition, press the space-
bar once. Pressing the spacebar a second time restarts the loop.
When you know which loop you want in your song, follow the steps in the
next section to actually place the loop in your track.
Assembling loops in your song
When you insert a loop in your track, it automatically conforms to the tempo
and key of your song. This means that you need to assign a key (if your pro-
gram allows this), a time signature, and a tempo for your song before you
start adding loops to it. I explain the process of setting a tempo and time sig-
nature in detail in the click track section in Chapter 10. In Logic, you assign a
key signature to your song by using the Signature/Key Change List Editor.
Here’s how you do it:
1. Choose Options➪Signature/Key Change List Editor. 
The Signature/Key Change List Editor window opens, as shown in Fig-
ure 12-5.
2. Double-click in the Key section of the list to highlight it.
3. Type in the key signature you want.
4. Click Return to accept the entry.
5. Close the window by clicking the red button in the top-left corner of
the window.
Figure 12-5:
You can
designate
the key
signature of
your song
in the
Signature/
Key Change
List Editor
window.
254
Part IV: Revving Up the Recording Process 

You don’t have to maintain a constant key and time signature for the entire
song. You can enter any key and time signature changes for a song in this list
by leaving the window open and adding them. (Repeat Steps 2 through 4.)
Just be sure to include the position for the start of the change in the Position
field. To enter data in this field, click the row of the time or key signature to
highlight it and then double-click that row under the Position column to open
the Position Indicator field.
After you set up your time and key signature parameters, you can start putting
loops into your track. This process is often as simple as dragging loops from
the loop browser into your track. You can then arrange them by shuffling them
around in your song’s Arrange window.
Editing loops
Editing loops involves the same basic procedures as editing any audio or
MIDI file. Chapters 10 and 11 provide the specifics on these basic editing 
procedures, so if you want to get hardcore and chop up your loops, you can
find out how to do it in those chapters.
Aside from the hardcore-chopping type of editing, you can make simple
adjustments in your loops by dragging the Start and End points with your
mouse. Here’s how you do this in GarageBand (arguably one of the simplest-
to-use loop programs):
1. Open GarageBand by double-clicking the GarageBand icon in the
Application folder.
2. Drag the loop you want to edit into your song.
A new track is created, and the loop is placed in the track.
3. Select the loop you want to edit by clicking it in your song.
The loop becomes highlighted.
4. To alter the Start point, position your cursor over the beginning edge
of the loop. To alter the End point, position your cursor over the end
of the loop.
An Edit icon appears.
5. Click and drag the Start point to the right to have playback begin later
in the loop sequence. Or click and drag the End point to the left to have
playback end before the loop’s actual ending.
255
Chapter 12: Using Loops

6. Release the mouse when you have the Start point (or End point)
where you want it.
This operation is non-destructive — meaning it doesn’t change your original
loop in any way. You can adjust the Start or End point again by clicking and
dragging the point back and forth at will.
Creating Your Own Loops
Most looping programs let you create your own loops from your audio files.
The difference between loops and simple snippets of audio data is that loops
contain metadata (basically, data about data) that identify the key and time
signature of the loop as well as categorical data — instrument type, musical
style, mood, and so on — that helps you find it in your loop browser. (Check
out the “Choosing loops” section, earlier in this chapter, for more on loop
browsers.)
Your first step in creating a loop is to edit your audio file to the point where
it contains the musical selection that you want to use. (You can find more
details for this in Chapter 10 and in your program’s manual.) When you have
your musical snippet, you turn it into a loop by adding the metadata to the
file. This process varies (of course) according to the program you use, but in
Logic you do it this way:
1. Select an audio region (for example, your snippet) in the Arrange
window by clicking it with the Selector tool (the little arrow located in
the upper-left corner of the Arrange window).
The audio region becomes highlighted.
2. Choose Audio➪Soundtrack Loop Utility➪Open to open the Soundtrack
Loop Utility window.
The window makes an appearance, as shown in Figure 12-6.
3. Enter your data in the appropriate text boxes in the window.
Typically, this would include the number of beats as well as the key and
time signatures, among other things.
4. Click OK to accept your settings and close the window.

Finding Loop Libraries
You can find an almost mind-boggling number of good — even great — loop
libraries that you can buy for your compositions. Although I’m a self-admitted
skeptic of looping, I have had a chance to use a variety of different loop
libraries over the years and have created a library of over 500 loops of my
own (don’t ask). As a result, I have a few (ahem) strong opinions about some
of the available loop libraries. This section lists a bunch of the better/more
unusual ones I’ve found.
 Dirt Keeps the Funk, by Primesounds: This CD contains a ton of great
funk grooves with drums, Fender Rhodes, bass, and other instruments.
You can find it at www.bigfishaudio.com/4DCGI/detail.html?914.
 Metamorphosis, by Spectrasonics: Spectrasonics makes great sample
and loop libraries (not to mention some awesome soft-synths — check
out Chapter 13). Metamorphosis is perfect for electronic, techno, or
house music. Describing this CD is difficult, so check out www.spectra
sonics.net/libraries/metamorphosis.html and you can download
some samples to hear it for yourself.

Chapter 12: Using Loops

 Mick Fleetwood: Total Drumming, by Sony Media Software: Good rock
drums can make a song. This library has some great classic rock drum-
ming by one of the best rock drummers around. If you need good drums,
this is one of my favorites. You can find it at http://mediasoftware.
sonypictures.com/loop_libraries/default.asp?cid=62.
So many loop libraries exist that narrowing it down here is impossible, and
this list could get huge, so here are a couple places where you can find loop
libraries on the Internet:
 www.bigfishaudio.com: This site has tons of loops and samples that
you can download or buy.
 www.mi7libraries.com/main/samples: Another site just chock full
of loops and samples worth looking into. Be careful, though: Once you
start checking out the samples, you might never get any real work done.

 Understanding software synthesizers
 Incorporating soft-synths into your music
 Finding soft-synths for your system
C
omputer-based recording allows your computer’s processing power to
take the place of racks full of equipment. The world of software synthe-
sizers is an area where this ability has fully blossomed. Just a few years ago
you needed a rack (or a keyboard stand) full of hardware to get just a sam-
pling (ahem) of the types of synthesizers and samplers that you now can
store in even a small hard drive on your computer.
In this chapter, I introduce you to the wonderful world of software synthesiz-
ers (soft-synths), and help you get started using them in your music. I detail
the steps of installing them in your system, show you how to create tracks in
which to use soft-synths, walk you through recording your performance, and
share with you how to change the sound to suit your needs. If that’s not
enough, I also offer some suggestions for good soft-synths that you can buy
and add to your system.
Understanding Software Synthesizers
Software synthesizers, known as soft-synths, are sound modules that live in
your computer. You can plug soft-synths into your songs and then trigger
them with MIDI performance data that you’ve added to your song.
Soft-synths are plug-ins, and as with other types of plug-ins (see Chapter 15),
soft-synths come in different formats. These include
 Audio Units: Audio Units (AU) is a format developed by Apple for OS X.
This format is just beginning to gain a wider share of available third-
party plug-ins and is used in programs that run on Mac OS X, such as
Logic and Digital Performer.

 Direct X: Direct X (DX) is a format developed by Microsoft for Windows
systems. The DX format is one of the most common plug-in formats, and
DX plug-ins are employed in programs such as ACID and SONAR, among
others.
 MAS: The MAS format was developed by MOTU for Digital Performer.
This plug-in format isn’t as common as many of the others — even
Digital Performer now uses Audio Units in its program.
 RTAS: Real Time Audio Suite is Digidesign’s proprietary plug-in format.
Pro Tools software uses this format.
 VST: Developed by Steinberg (the maker of Cubase and Nuendo, among
other programs), VST plug-ins are used on both Mac and Windows com-
puters. This is by far the most popular plug-in format and as such you
find a plethora of options.
Most soft-synths are available in several different formats, so you should be
able to use the one you want in whatever audio recording program you have.
If you have to have a particular soft-synth and it isn’t supported by the plug-
in format that your system uses, you can get a wrapper to act as a bridge
between your recording program’s supported format and that of the soft-
synth. Chapter 15 has more on plug-in wrappers, including a list of the most
common ones.
Using Soft-Synths
If you want to use soft-synths in your songs, you can’t just wave your magic
wand and wish it so — you need to follow a few steps to use them. You start
by installing them in your system, and then you insert them into your tracks.
This section details both steps.
To use soft-synths in your songs, you need two things: an audio recording
program that supports MIDI sequencing, and a soft-synth program installed
in your computer.
Installing soft-synths
Your audio recording program likely comes with some plug-ins. The quality of
these included plug-ins ranges from merely okay to exceptional. If you want
to buy or download additional plug-ins to use in your program, you need to
install them so that your audio recording program can recognize and use
them. This process is usually as easy as clicking the Install icon that pops up
on-screen after inserting the CD you bought or double-clicking the folder of
the plug-in that you just downloaded.
260
Part IV: Revving Up the Recording Process 

There might come a time, however, when you’ll want to install these plug-ins
by hand. This situation could arise, for example, if you have more than one
audio recording program in your computer and you want to use the plug-ins
on all of them. (An automatic install might circle in on just one program and
ignore the others.) To avoid such a partial success, you need to do a custom
install so that you can designate which applications should be targeted.
Check your manual for details.
Recording soft-synths in your song
Soft-synths record like any MIDI instrument — the only difference here is that
the sound you hear is created within your computer, rather than originating
in a separate sound module like your external synthesizer or keyboard. To
use a soft-synth in your song, you need to follow a few steps. This section
describes the process.
Creating a track for your soft-synth
First things first. To record with a soft-synth, you need to create a track in
which to insert the synthesizer plug-in. Regardless of the program you use,
the process remains basically the same. The difference lies in the type of
track you create, but the basic steps — at least in Logic — look like this:
1. Choose Functions➪Track➪Create the top of the Arrange window, as
shown in Figure 13-1. (If the Arrange window isn’t showing, choose
Windows➪Open Arrange.)
A new track appears in your song in the same format (and with the same
name) as the track directly before it.
2. Assign an audio instrument to your new track to separate it from the
track above it by first clicking and holding the track name in the
Arrange window.
A pop-up menu appears. (See Figure 13-2.)
3. Drag your mouse to one of the audio instruments in the list.
4. Release the mouse.
Your new track is assigned to the selected audio instrument.
You now have a track for your soft-synth.
Connecting a keyboard controller
To record with a soft-synth, you need to have a way to trigger the sound.
You’ll usually want to do trigger the sound by using an external keyboard. If
you’ve set up your system for MIDI devices, all you need to do is plug in your
keyboard controller and assign it to your instrument track.
261
Chapter 13: Exploring Software Synthesizers

Chapter 11 explains the process of setting up your MIDI devices in both
Windows XP and Mac OS X. If you haven’t set up a MIDI device yet, take a few
minutes to do so. Then follow the steps in the rest of this section to assign
the device to your track.
1. Click your soft-synth’s track in the Arrange window to highlight it.
The track’s channel strip appears on the left side of the window.
2. Within the Subchannel section of the track (located on the leftmost
side of the Arrange window) double-click the MIDI Channel selector.
The MIDI Channel selector becomes highlighted, as shown in Figure 13-3.
3. Type the MIDI channel you want to use.
4. Press Return to accept this MIDI channel.
Make sure that your MIDI device is set to the same MIDI channel — or set to
all MIDI channels — otherwise the MIDI device won’t trigger the track.

Part IV: Revving Up the Recording Process 

Assigning a soft-synth to your track
Inserting a soft-synth into a track is as simple as inserting an effect. Depending
on your audio recording program, where you do the actual inserting varies.
For example, in Logic, you set the input of your audio instrument track to the
soft-synth, and in Pro Tools you insert the soft-synth into a MIDI track from
the plug-in Insert menu.
The steps involved are as follows:
 In Logic, click and hold over the track’s Input selector (see the left side
of Figure 13-4) in the Arrange, Environment, or Global Mixer window and
drag your cursor to the soft-synth you want from the pop-up menu.
Release the mouse to accept this selection.
 In Pro Tools, click and hold over the track’s Insert selector (see the
right side of Figure 13-4) in either the Edit or Mix window, and then drag
to the soft-synth you want from the contextual menu. Release the mouse
to accept the soft-synth.
Recording your performance
With your MIDI device set up and your soft-synth assigned, recording is easy.
Simply click the Record Enable button for the track and click the Record
button to start the process. (At least that’s how it works in Logic; in Pro Tools
you need to click Play after clicking Record.) Click Stop to stop recording.
To hear what you’re playing, all you have to do is turn up the Volume fader
located at the bottom of the track’s channel strip in the Mix window (Pro
Tools) or in the Environment or Global Mixer window (Logic).

I explain the recording process in more detail in Chapters 10 and 11. So if you
want to know the specifics of adding click tracks, doing overdubs, and punch-
ing in and out, check out those chapters.
Playing back a recorded track
When you’re done recording, you can hear your performance by following
these steps:
1. Disable your track by toggling off the Record Enable button.
2. Click either Zero (Pro Tools) or Stop (Logic) in the Transport window
to return your song to the Start position.
3. Click Play in the Transport window.
Your song starts playing.
4. Press Stop to stop your song when you’re done listening.

Part IV: Revving Up the Recording Process 

Changing sounds
When your soft-synth is plugged in, you can edit the sound much as you
would adjust the parameters of any plug-in. Because the performance data
for your soft-synth is MIDI, you can make the decision for your final sound
after you’ve recorded your part. (I rarely do this because the sound of the
instrument dictates to a large extent the way I play my part, but you might
work differently.)
Anyway, to change the parameters of your soft-synth
1. Double-click the name of your soft-synth in the Input section of the
track that it’s plugged in to.
The soft-synth’s window opens. Figure 13-5 shows a typical soft-synth
window in Logic.
2. Make your adjustments.
For example, twirl the knobs or slide the sliders or whatever to adjust
the modulation pitch or the filter.
The sound change might be immediate, depending on your computer’s
speed and whether your song is playing while you make the change.
3. Click OK to accept the new parameters and close the window.
If you think you’re going to make a lot of adjustments, you may want to keep
the window open as the song plays and simultaneously make your adjust-
ments. If you do this, though, keep in mind that it does put stress on your
processor, so your changes might take a while to go into effect.

Finding Soft-Synths
Lots of great soft-synths are available on the market. This is one of the most
exciting aspects of a computer-based recording. Instead of having to spend
$2,000 on a hardware synthesizer with limited sounds, you can buy a hard
drive full of soft-synths and end up with a huge variety of sounds at your dis-
posal for about the same amount of money.
I offer a short list of free, downloadable soft-synths in Chapter 21 to get you
started. The following list includes my favorite for-purchase options.
 Atmosphere, by Spectrasonics: If you want ambient synthesizer pads —
background sounds that create a soundscape — these are the best I’ve
found. You can find them at www.spectrasonics.net/instruments/
atmosphere.html.
 MachFive, by MOTU: MachFive is one of the best software samplers
around. A soft-sampler lets you use pre-recorded audio sample libraries
or use your own. You can find out more at www.motu.com/products/
software/machfive/body.html/en.
 ReBirth, by Propellerhead: ReBirth is a soft-synth of old analog hard-
ware devices that are used in electronic music, including the TB-303, TR-
808, and TR-909 synthesizers. ReBirth is great for classic bass synth lines
and drum parts. You can find out more at www.propellerheads.se.
 Absynth, by Native Instruments: Absynth is a fun and immensely pow-
erful soft-synth. Absynth helps you to create some innovative sounds.

turned into an honest-to-goodness song. This process involves blending
(mixing) all your individual musical ideas into the song that you hear in your
head and then mastering that final mix — the last stage in the recording
process — so that your song is transformed into something worth sharing
with the world. These parts of music-making aren’t rocket science (what is,
though, except maybe rocket science), but both processes do have a set of
objectives and common steps that you can follow.
In this chapter, I walk you through the basics of mixing your tracks. More
importantly, I show you how you can do it all by using the automation fea-
tures found in computer-based recording systems. I also give a step-by-step
guide through the bounce procedure — the actual process of taking all your
tracks and turning them into a single stereo file. Finally, this chapter takes
you into the often-misunderstood world of audio mastering. Here, I first show
you what mastering is supposed to do to your music, and then I lay out the
steps to do it in your audio recording program.
Mixing and mastering are art forms. As such, no one way to do them exists;
you probably need to take some time to get a feel for each process. Don’t be
afraid to make mistakes. One of the benefits of computer-based recording is
that, as you strive for just the right mix, you can make as many mixes of your
music as your hard drive space allows and not degrade the music’s sound.
(This isn’t the case with tape-based recording, where you can hear the sound
degrade as you make your way one more time — and then one more time —
through the tape.)

Understanding Mixing
The goal of mixing is to make sure each instrument can be heard in the mix —
the recorded whole that results from blending all your recorded parts
together — without covering up something else or sounding out of place. You
can pull this off in several ways:
 Think about the emotion of the song. Choose the recorded parts that
add to the emotional impact of the music and build intensity throughout
the song. By necessity, this also means choosing not to use parts that
are unnecessary, or which clash with parts that have a greater impact.
This involves muting the track, dropping its level, or editing out the
parts you don’t like. I cover editing in Chapter 10.
 Create volume balance. Set the level (volume) of each instrument rela-
tive to the others so that nothing is buried so far back in the mix that
you can’t hear it — and no instrument is so loud that it overpowers the
other instruments. Be aware that your levels often change throughout
the song, so settings that you’ve made for the ending of the first verse
might not be appropriate for the fourth chorus. You can, however, set up
your audio recording program so that it automatically deals with such
variations. I discuss this process later in this chapter.
Another way to affect the levels of your tracks is to use dynamics pro-
cessing to even out inconsistent performances. Essentially, dynamics
processing lets you control the difference between the loudest and qui-
etest parts of your recording so that you end up with a more interesting
or even performance. I talk about dynamics processing in Chapter 18.
 Create tonal clarity. Adjust the equalization (also called EQ or frequency
response) of each instrument so that each one leaves room for the other
instruments in the mix. This means getting rid of any frequencies of an
instrument that clash with those of another, or emphasizing certain fre-
quencies that define the sound of an instrument so it can be heard
clearly in the mix. I cover equalization in detail in Chapter 16.
 Put instruments in their places. Take advantage of stereo panning
(movement from left to right) to put each instrument in its proper place
in the stereo field — toward the left or right — where it can either sound
as natural as possible or produce a desired effect. Also, stereo panning
allows you to make room for each instrument in the mix, especially
those with similar frequency ranges.
 Use effects effectively. Add effects (such as reverb or delay) and dynam-
ics processors (such as compression) to the instruments in the mix to
either place them “in front” or “in back” relative to other instruments or
to create a desired sound. Chapter 17 covers effects in detail, and you
discover dynamics processors in Chapter 18.

Part IV: Revving Up the Recording Process 

The mixing process is where you can get really creative in crafting your song.
The stress of capturing great performances is over — all that’s left for you to
do is to massage all the parts of your song into a cohesive whole. Don’t be
afraid to try new things. Experiment with different EQ, panning, and effect
settings. Take your time and have fun. The great thing about mixing is that
you can make as many versions as you want — and you can always go back
and try again.
Mixing with Automation
One of the great assets of computer-based recording is the ability to make
a mix that you can then perform without any mistakes and repeat as many
times as you want. This involves using the automation features included in
your audio-recording program. All audio recording programs have some sort
of automation, so the basics I outline in this section apply to all programs
even though the specific steps and vocabulary used by each program may
be slightly different.
Unless you have an external controller such as a digital mixer or MIDI-based
DAW controller (like the Mackie Control or the Digi 002 control surface) you
have no choice but to use some automation when you mix more than a couple
tracks within your computer. This is because your mouse can control only one
thing at a time. So if you want to fade out your guitar lead while you bring in
the backup vocals, you need to program these changes into your computer.
Knowing what you can automate
Most audio recording programs let you automate quite a few parts of your
mix. For example, when working with audio tracks in Pro Tools you can auto-
mate the following:
 Volume: This parameter controls the overall volume of the track.
 Pan: This lets you set the left/right balance of the track in the stereo field.
This allows you to place your instrument where you want on the virtual
soundstage, giving your music a sense of spaciousness or dimension.
 Mute: This allows you to turn the track on and off.
 Send: This includes volume, mute, and panning settings for the send —
the routing section that lets you send part of your track’s signal to an
effect. Chapter 18 has more about Sends and effects.
 Plug-in parameters: You adjust these parameters within the Plug-In
window. Chapter 15 has all the details about plug-ins.
269
Chapter 14: Mixing and Mastering Your Music

Automation data for each of these parameters resides in a playlist that’s sep-
arate from the regions that contain your edits for that track. This allows you
to move the regions in and out of the track’s playlist without changing the
automation data for that track.
MIDI tracks are equally amenable to automation. Pro Tools, for example, lets
you automate the following parameters:
 Volume: This parameter sets the overall volume of the MIDI data.
 Pan: You can place your tracks anywhere from left to right in the stereo
field to give your music a sense of dimension.
 Mute: This allows you to turn the track on and off.
 Controller data: This includes a number of MIDI settings, including
options such as the modulation wheel, breath controller, and sustain.
Pro Tools stores the automation data for MIDI tracks — with the exception of
Mute settings — within the MIDI region for that track. So when you move a
region within a track’s playlist, the automation data (except for any mute set-
tings) moves along with the region.
Getting to know automation modes
Most audio recording programs offer several different automation modes.
These allow you to record, play back, and change your automation data so
that you get the “performance” that you want from each track. Here’s a look
at some of the typical automation modes you’ll find in most audio recording
software:
 Auto Off mode turns off all automation data for the selected track.
 Auto Read mode plays back the automation data for the selected track.
 Auto Write mode writes automation data for the selected parameter(s)
while the session plays — overwriting any pre-existing automation data
in the process. When you stop playback after writing automation in this
mode, most programs (such as Pro Tools) automatically switch the
automation mode to Auto Touch (see next bullet) so you don’t acciden-
tally erase this data next time you play back the session.
 Auto Touch mode writes automation data only when you click a param-
eter with your mouse; it stops writing when you release the mouse button.
270
Part IV: Revving Up the Recording Process 

At this point, your automated parameter returns to any previously auto-
mated position. By using Auto Touch, you can fix parts of your previously
recorded automation data without erasing the stuff you want to keep.
 Auto Latch mode works much like Auto Touch mode (see previous
bullet) — when you touch or move a parameter, new automation data is
written. The difference is that Auto Latch mode continues to write new
automation data until you stop playback.
Recording your automation data
Recording your automation moves is a simple process and is the same regard-
less of the parameter you want to automate. This process involves selecting
the parameter you want to automate, choosing the proper automation mode
to record your data, and letting the song play as you record your automation
data. These steps are outlined in this section.
When I work on my mixes, I always start setting up some basic level and 
panning settings. After I have a rough mix with these settings, I move on to
adjusting EQ and then adding effects and dynamics processing. After these
settings are recorded, I go back to the level and panning settings and adjust
them some more. Next it’s back to the EQ, effects, and dynamics processing.
This circular process continues until I have everything just the way I want it.
Enabling automation
The first steps in recording your automation moves is choosing the automa-
tion you want and enabling it for the track you want to record. This process
is simple. For example, here’s how you enable automation in Logic:
1. Make sure the Arrange window is open. (If it isn’t open, choose
Windows➪Open Arrange to open it.)
2. Click and hold over the automation mode selector in the track and
drag your cursor to the mode that you want, as shown in Figure 14-1.
For a reminder of the different automation modes and how they work,
check out the “Getting to know automation modes” section, earlier in
this chapter.
3. Release the mouse button to make your selection.
The automation mode that you selected is listed in your track’s display.
271
Chapter 14: Mixing and Mastering Your Music

Recording your mix performance
Most audio recording programs offer you several ways to record and edit
your automation moves. These often include the following:
 Mousing: Mousing involves using your mouse to adjust your chosen
parameter (fader level, pan, send level, and so on) as your song plays.
This method has the disadvantage of allowing you to make only a single
automation move at a time.
 Drawing: This approach is where you “draw” the automation data right
in your track. As you can see in Figure 14-2, this process is as simple as
drawing with the appropriate tool in the track you want to automate. (In
Pro Tools, for example, you use the Pencil tool.) For this to work, you
need to have the parameter you want to automate displayed in the
track. (In Pro Tools, click and hold the Track Display menu and drag to
your selection to have that selection displayed in your track.)
As was the case with mousing, you can adjust only one parameter at a
time. This isn’t that much of a drawback, however, because it’s more
than likely that you’ll want to do your automation drawing while your
song isn’t playing. Here, you most likely want to draw in order to edit
existing automation data. (You do this by drawing over the existing data
in your track.)
 Controlling: If you have an external controller, such as the Logic Control
for Logic, you can use it to write your automation data. With a controller
that’s well-integrated with your software, you can write a large variety of
parameters by using the controller, and you can write as many at the
same time as your hands and fingers (and brain) allow. This can signifi-
cantly speed up the mixing process, especially if you have a lot of tracks
to mix.
I tend to write my automation in stages. I start with volume and panning for
all tracks, then move on to the extras such as plug-in parameters and send
levels. As you work, don’t worry about how your automation looks on the
screen. Use your ears instead. This seems like a logical thing, but I have to
Figure 14-1:
In Logic, you

mode from
the pop-up
menu in the
Arrange
window.
272
Part IV: Revving Up the Recording Process 

tell ya, with all the fancy graphics on-screen you might end up having to put a
towel over your computer’s monitor while you work (that is, if you use a con-
troller or your mouse — it’s kind of hard to draw automation when you can’t
see it).
Making Your Mix
You have a couple options when you actually create your mix with a computer-
based recording system: You can mix in-the-box (within the computer) or
you can mix to an external recorder. Mixing in-the-box involves performing a
bounce procedure. This is a simple process regardless of the audio recording
software that you use. Mixing to an external recorder is also relatively straight-
forward, but it does require that you have some sort of external recording
device — a tape deck, for example, or a digital recorder such as an Alesis
Masterlink. This section lays out the process for making your mix either way.
Mixing in-the-box
Mixing in-the-box refers to using the Bounce feature in your audio recording
program to create your final mix. (Bounce is the term Logic and many other
audio recording programs use, but you’ll find that Pro Tools refers to it as
“Bounce to Disk.”) The Bounce feature processes your audio tracks into one
stereo track. Essentially, this means that your computer creates a new file
with the settings you choose in the Bounce dialog box. This gives you a
stereo file that you can then master or burn onto a CD.
When you use the Bounce feature in your recording program, all the mixing
and routing instructions that you designate by using the steps I describe ear-
lier in the chapter are followed to create your final mix. This includes any EQ
or effects that you have plugged in and turned on in your tracks, any fader
levels (volume) you have for each track, and all automation settings you
assigned to your tracks (and have turned on).

as drawing

273
Chapter 14: Mixing and Mastering Your Music

Examining bounce options
Although each program is a little different, the process of making a bounce is
fairly similar and involves choosing settings such as the bounce source, file
type, format, bit depth, and sample rate. For example, when you select the
bounce procedure in Pro Tools (choose File➪Bounce), a dialog box opens so
that you can make these selections. (Check out Figure 14-3.) Here’s a look at
the Pro Tools options you have to choose from:
 Source: You can use the Bounce Source drop-down list to select any
output or bus path as your source for the bounce. (Figure 14-4 gives you
a peek at some of the choices.)
 File Type: This drop-down list sets the file type for the bounced file. You
have many choices, but for your final mix the following common file
types are the ones to choose from:
• BWF (WAV): This file type is the standard for older, PC-based Pro
Tools systems — and it’s currently the most commonly used file
type. (One reason: BWF files are compatible with both Macs and
PCs.) This is the type I generally choose because it increases that
chances that my files are compatible with other systems.
• AIFF: This stands for Audio Interchange File Format and used to be
native to Macs. AIFF files can be imported into any Pro Tools ses-
sion without any prior converting — including sessions on a PC —
but because BWF is becoming the standard I skip this type. If you
use a Mac and you plan to do your mastering on your Mac with Pro
Tools, this file type is a fine choice.
Figure 14-3:
The Bounce
dialog box
lets you
select
several
bounce
options.
274
Part IV: Revving Up the Recording Process 

You get the same sound quality in BWF and AIFF files. Choose based on
your computer platform and whether you intend to send your music out
to a mastering house or do it yourself.
If you intend to have your music professionally mastered, make sure
that you contact the folks at the mastering studio ahead of time to see
what file type they prefer.
 Format: This drop-down list determines whether your bounced file is in
Mono, Multiple Mono, or Stereo Interleaved. These formats do have
some differences that are good to know:
• Mono (Summed): Selecting this option creates a single audio file
that contains all the material without any panning information.
Because any stereo information is summed when using this option,
it’s easy to get too high of a combined signal. This might result in
clipping (distortion) depending on your software and your overall
summed levels. If you want to record with this format, I recommend
that you reduce your levels so that the left and right channels peak
at no more than –3dB, although –6dB is better. This reduces the
chances of creating distortion. You can make this level up during
the mastering stage if you feel your mix isn’t loud enough.
• Multiple Mono: This format puts the left and right channels of your
stereo mix in separate files, labeling the files with (respectively)
the .L and .R filename extensions.
Multiple mono is the file format supported by most audio recording
programs — which makes it the one to use if you intend to master
your music yourself in a different program from the one you recorded
it in. If you plan to use a professional mastering engineer, call him
or her to see what file format works with the mastering equipment.
(It will either be multiple mono or stereo interleaved.)
• Stereo Interleaved: This format contains all stereo information in a
single stereo file. Panning information is retained. Any tracks set to
even-numbered outputs end up on the right side of the stereo file;
Figure 14-4:
The Bounce
Source
drop-down
list shows
you your
choices.
275
Chapter 14: Mixing and Mastering Your Music

tracks set to odd-numbered outputs go to the left side of the stereo
field. This is the file format to use when you make your final master
to 16 bit because stereo interleaved files are required to burn a CD.
 Resolution: This setting lets you choose one of three bit rates for your
bounced files: 8, 16, or 24. (Chapter 4 has more on resolution.) For your
final mix, choose 24 bit (maximum resolution). You can reduce the reso-
lution as needed later on when you master your music yourself or when
you have a professional do it for you.
 Sample Rate: You can save your file with any of several sample rates,
but I recommend saving it with the same rate as the files in your session.
Check out Chapter 4 for all the details about sample rates.
If you intend to have your music mastered by a professional, make sure
to ask her what she prefers. Some mastering engineers want the files at
the highest sample rate possible, but others would rather you not change
the rate.
 Conversion Quality: If you select a sample rate different from the files in
your session — which I don’t recommend — you’re prompted to choose
a level of quality for the conversion. Choose the highest quality possible
for your mix material, but keep in mind that the higher the quality you
choose, the longer it takes to do the conversion process.
Performing the bounce
To use the Bounce feature in any program, first make sure that all your tracks
are the way you want them. Check all routing, automation, effects, and EQ
settings to make sure they’re right.
When it comes to actual bouncing in Pro Tools, do the following:
1. Choose File➪Bounce to Disk.
The Bounce dialog box appears. (Refer to Figure 14-3.)
2. Set your Bounce options to the settings you want.
Check out the “Examining bounce options” section earlier in this chap-
ter for the scoop on these options.
3. Click the Bounce button.
The Save Bounce As dialog box opens.
4. In the dialog box, select a destination point for this file, enter the
name of this mix, and then click Save.
The session plays while the bounce happens.
276
Part IV: Revving Up the Recording Process 

When bouncing in Logic, follow these steps:
1. Click the Bounce button in the lower-right corner of the channel strip
of the output that you want to bounce.
The Bounce dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 14-5.
2. Make your selections for the bounce settings you want.
For a general introduction to possible bounce settings, check out the
“Examining bounce options” section earlier in this chapter.
3. Click the Bounce button.
The Save Bounce As dialog box opens.
4. Using the dialog box, select a name and destination point for this file
and then click Save.
You have a choice of having the session play while the bounce happens
(online) or skipping the whole playing business (offline). If you choose
offline bouncing, your bounce will take less time than if you choose
online, but you obviously won’t hear your song as it bounces.
Mixing to an external recorder
You can mix to an external device instead of mixing solely within your com-
puter. This section explains how to mix to both analog and digital recorders.
Before you make your mix, you need to have all your mix settings created in
your song. Even though you’re mixing to an external device you can still auto-
mate your mix in the same way you would for mixing in-the-box. The “Mixing
with Automation” section earlier in this chapter explains the process.
Figure 14-5:

dialog box in
Logic is

277
Chapter 14: Mixing and Mastering Your Music

You can mix to an external digital device such as a DAT (Digital Audio Tape)
deck — or, for you classic technology fans, to an analog device such as a reel-
to-reel tape recorder — by following these steps:
1. Connect your device to your audio interface.
For digital recorders, run a cable from the digital outputs of the interface
to the digital inputs of your device. You need to use an optical or coaxial
connection, depending on the interface.
For analog recorders, run cables from two of the analog outputs of the
interface to the inputs of your device.
2. If you want to be able to monitor this device as it records, connect the
device’s outputs to your monitor speakers or plug your headphones
into the headphone jack (if your device has one).
3. Using the Output selectors, set the outputs of your tracks, auxiliary
inputs, and master fader to the physical outputs of your interface.
These must correspond to the outputs you connected your device to.
4. Enable recording in your external device.
This usually involves clicking the Record Enable button for the track
that you want to record to and then clicking the Record button.
5. Click the Play button in the Transport window of your song.
6. Adjust your input levels on your external device.
The level you set depends on your type of device. For example, if you
use an analog tape deck, you can get away with a level that runs into the
red if you want to fully saturate the tape. For a digital device, keep your
levels from hitting digital zero (0dB); otherwise you’ll end up with digital
distortion. I usually set my mix level so that it peaks at between –6dB
and –3dB when I mix to an external digital recorder. You can make up
the volume a little when you master your song. The following section,
“Mastering Your Music,” details this process.
7. Rewind the session.
8. Start recording on the external device and immediately press the
spacebar or click the Play button in the Transport window.
The session plays, and you record it into your external device.
9. Click the Stop button in the Transport window or press the spacebar
when the music is done.
You now have a mix recorded into your external device.
278
Part IV: Revving Up the Recording Process 

Mastering Your Music
The final step in recording your music is to master it. Mastering involves taking
your stereo mix and tweaking it so that it sounds the best it can. Mastering
isn’t a mysterious process — it’s pretty simple, really. But it does require cer-
tain skills. That’s where this section comes in.
The mastering steps I present in this chapter use the Bounce feature in your
audio recording program. You don’t necessarily have to go this route. If you
want, you can also send your mastered tracks out to a digital device by follow-
ing the steps in this section — and then use the steps that describe mixing to
an external digital device (found earlier in this chapter).
Demystifying mastering
The mastering process of recording involves preparing your music for dupli-
cation. Five basic steps are involved in this process:
1. Optimize the dynamics.
This doesn’t mean making your music as loud as possible. Instead, this
step in the mastering process consists of finding the best volume and
dynamic range for your music. This is the most critical part of the mas-
tering process and the one that is abused the most.
2. Perfect the tonal balance.
Because your songs were probably recorded and mixed over a long
period of time, they’re unlikely to have the same tonal characteristics.
This is a good thing, but for a group of songs to be an effective CD, you
want the tones of your songs to be similar enough that your listener
doesn’t have to make adjustments to his stereo’s EQ as he listens. This
step involves using parametric EQs to get all your tunes to sound good
together.
3. Match the volume of your songs.
Having consistent levels from song to song helps with the cohesiveness
and flow of a CD and keeps your listener from having to adjust her player’s
volume from song to song. You do this with simple gain adjustments, com-
pressors, and/or limiters — and by making those processes consistent,
audio recording programs give us mere mortals a crack at doing it right.
4. Select the order of your songs.
This is called sequencing and involves putting your songs in the order
that you want on your duplicated CD and setting the blank space between
279
Chapter 14: Mixing and Mastering Your Music

each song so that the CD flows well from one song to another. Because a
CD is supposed to represent a cohesive body of work, this is one of the
most important aspects of mastering.
5. Put it on CD.
This is the process of burning an audio CD so that you can listen to your
song in any stereo or create multiple copies to give away or sell.
Following these steps isn’t a linear process. Most of the time you need to go
back and forth between a few steps — optimizing the dynamics, matching the
volume, and perfecting the tonal balance — before you get everything the
way you want it. Take your time in the mastering process and take a second
listen after you think you have it right to make sure it’s the best you can do.
I recommend taking a first crack at the mastering and then re-evaluating it
again after a few days have passed.
If you have to do a lot to master your song to make it work, you might want
to consider going back to the mixing stage and tweaking it instead. You
should have to make only minor adjustments during mastering — if you do
more than that, your time is best served remixing your music first. Every
adjustment you make during mastering is a compromise. Adding a bit of high-
end (frequencies above 10 kHz) to your vocal adds high-end to everything
and what might be just enough to make the vocals sound right might make
the bass guitar too twangy (a highly technical term). In this case, go back to
your mix and add the high-end to only your vocal track before you master the
whole song.
Setting up a mastering session
The first step in mastering your music in your computer is to set up a master-
ing session. This involves creating a new song in your audio recording pro-
gram and importing the mixed tracks from each song you want on your CD.
This section details that process.
In Pro Tools, you start by creating a new session for mastering:
1. Choose File➪New Session.
The New Session dialog box appears.
2. Type in the name of the file in the Save As text box.
I usually call the file mastering and include the name of the CD project
that I’m working on.
280
Part IV: Revving Up the Recording Process 

3. Using the File browser, navigate to the location where you want to
place the new session, and then select the location.
I usually create a new folder called Mastered Mixes so I can easily find
the files later when I burn them to CD.
4. Select the session parameters that match the mixed files for your
songs.
You set audio file type, sample rate, I/O settings, and bit depth here.
Chapter 10 has more on the basics of setting up a new session.
5. Click Save.
Your new session opens.
Okay, at this point you have a general “same place” to put the songs. Next,
create tracks to import the mixed song files into:
1. Choose File➪New Track.
The New Track dialog box appears.
2. In the Create text box, enter a number corresponding to the number
of songs you want on your CD.
3. Choose Stereo and Audio Track from the drop-down lists.
4. Click the Create button.
Your session now has the necessary tracks for importing your audio.
With tracks created, you can now import your mixed tracks into this session:
1. Click and hold the Audio title in the Audio Regions list located on the
right side of the Edit window.
If the Audio Regions list isn’t visible, click the double arrow at the
bottom-right corner of the Edit window.
2. Choose Import Audio from the menu that appears or press Shift+Ô+I
(on a Mac) or Shift+Ctrl+I (on a PC).
The Import Audio dialog box opens.
3. Using the Look In text box, navigate through your folder structure to
find and select the song file you want to import.
4. Click Done.
The file appears as a region in the Audio Regions list.
5. Repeat Steps 1 through 4 for each song you want to master in this 
session.

Part IV: Revving Up the Recording Process 
Using a mastering pro
Mastering your music is no mystery, but often the
fresh perspective and top-notch gear that a pro-
fessional mastering engineer has can take your
final product from good to truly stellar. If you want
to hire a pro to master your music, here are some
suggestions that can help the process along:
 Ask around for referrals. If you know local
bands or musicians whose music you like
and whose CDs sound great, ask them who
mastered their music. Call local studios and
find out whom they recommend for master-
ing in your area. Also check out resources
on the Internet. Two great Internet forums
are www.musicplayer.com/cgi-bin/
ultimatebb.cgi
and http://rec
forums.prosoundweb.com. In a forum,
do a search for the term mastering or post a
new topic and ask your question. Try to get
referrals from people who work with your
type of music.
 Listen to other recordings that the mastering
house has done in a style of music similar to
yours. If you’re entrusting your artistic vision
to someone else, make sure that this person
is the right person for the job. If you like what
the prospective mastering engineer has done
on other people’s music, you’ll probably like
what he or she does with yours. If this person
has never worked with music similar to
yours — or has mastered someone else’s
music but you don’t like the way it came
out — you’d probably better keep looking.
 Clarify the fee for your project before you
actually start working together. Most mas-
tering engineers charge by the hour and
can give you a pretty good estimate of how
many hours they’ll need to do the job. You’ll
also be expected to pay for materials (ref-
erence CDs, for example).
Tip: Many mastering engineers will do a demo
for you, tooling up one or two songs so you can
hear what kind of job they can do for your music
before you hire them. Ask whether the master-
ing engineer you’re interested in offers this ser-
vice. This simple step can save both you and the
engineer a lot of time and energy if he or she
isn’t right for the job. It can also help you deter-
mine whether your mixed music is ready for
mastering — if you need to go back and make
adjustments, now’s the time to find out.
After you choose the mastering engineer that
you think will work well for you and your music,
you can make the process much easier and less
stressful (for both you and the engineer) if you
follow a few guidelines:
 Discuss your expectations and desires.
This is the best way to ensure that your
mastered music turns out the way you
want. People who are unhappy with the job
that the mastering engineer does usually
aren’t clear about what they want or don’t
understand what is possible in the master-
ing process.
 Take a few CDs whose sound you like with
you to the mastering session. Talk with the
engineer about how you can get your music
to sound similar. A skilled engineer can let
you know right away whether the sound
you want is possible.
 Try to be present at the mastering session.
Many people send their music to a master-
ing engineer and expect him or her to do the
job without their presence in the studio. Try
to go to the studio, but if you can’t, be sure
that the engineer clearly understands your
desires and expectations.

Finally, place your audio regions into the tracks in the session:
1. Click and drag the region from the Audio Regions list into the playlist
of the track you want the song in.
2. Repeat Step 1 for each of your songs.
You end up with only one song in each of the available tracks.
You now have a session that contains all the songs for your project. Having
them all in one session allows you to switch from one song to the next as you
master your tunes and makes it easy to check loudness levels and EQ balanc-
ing as you work. (See the “Perfecting tonal balance” and “Balancing levels”
sections later in this chapter.)
Optimizing dynamics
Okay, this is where the magic in mastering happens. This is where you can
make your music shine or where you can royally mess it up. (How’s that for
adding a little pressure?) Before you get tense (okay, breathe), remember that
you can always go back and try again. Oh, did I mention that you should make
backup copies of your individual tracks and your final mix? Well, if you haven’t
already done the backing up business, now would be a good time to do that.
I’ll wait.
You done? Okay, now to the job at hand — getting your music to be as loud as
possible. (I’m just kidding; see the sidebar “Turn it up!” to see why.) Seriously,
optimizing the dynamics of your songs doesn’t mean getting it loud enough to
level a city block, but rather getting it to have life and emotion. And, yes, this
also means getting it to be loud enough to sound good.
The style of your music and the arrangements that you use determine how you
optimize the dynamics of your music. For example, classical music has a much
broader dynamic range than rock music, and the infamous “wall of sound” type
of arrangement (producer Phil Spector’s approach to mixing) has a narrower
dynamic range than a song with sparse verses and thicker choruses.
When you’re optimizing the dynamics of your music, be sensitive to the song
and try not to get sucked into the idea that you need to get the most volume
out of your music. I know I’m beating this volume thing into the ground, but
you’d be surprised how seductive the lure of Big Volume can be. (“C’mon, let’s
get just a few more decibels out of the song . . .” Trust me, you’ll soon find out.)
You have two main types of tools to use when you work on the dynamics
during mastering in your computer — compressor plug-ins and limiter 
plug-ins — and each has its purpose. For the most part, if you’re trying to
283
Chapter 14: Mixing and Mastering Your Music

add punch or smoothness to your music, a compressor plug-in does the job
nicely. On the other hand, if you’re trying to squeeze a little more volume out
of a song and you don’t want to change the song’s sound quality, a limiter
plug-in is your best choice.
Here are suggestions that might help you to use compression and limiting
most effectively during mastering:
 Use a low ratio. A compression ratio between 1.1:1 and 2:1 keeps you
from over-compressing your music. Too high of a ratio increases the
chances that you’ll end up with artifacts that will mess with the sound
of your pristine music.
 Go easy. Apply only 1 or 2dB of compression or limiting at one time. If
you need more than that, chain more than one compressor together by
inserting more than one compressor plug-in in your track and use these
small amounts on each. If you compress or limit more than 1 or 2dB at a
time, you end up with artifacts (audible changes to your music caused by
the compressor or limiter).
 Spend time tweaking. Work with your attack and release times. An attack
that’s too short takes the punch out of your music by cutting off the ini-
tial transients. Likewise, a release time that’s too long doesn’t recover
quickly enough, and the dynamics of the vocal disappear. In contrast, if
the release time is too short, you hear distortion.
 Make your meters dance. Set the threshold so your compressor’s meters
dance (bounce) to the rhythm of the music. The meter you want to watch
in your compressor plug-in is the one labeled “reduction” located below
the input and output meters. Only the loudest notes (snare drum or lead
vocal accents, for example) should trigger the meters — and then only
by 1 or 2dB.
 Split the frequency spectrum. Use a multiband compressor to apply dif-
ferent amounts of compression to specific frequency ranges to bring out
individual instruments in the mix. For example, if the bass drum seems
to be getting lost, you can apply mild compression to the lower frequen-
cies (around 80 to 100 Hz). This brings the instrument forward in the
mix slightly.
Some audio recording programs, such as Pro Tools LE, come with a multi-
band compressor plug-in. If you want to use one on your music and your
audio recording program doesn’t come with such a plug-in, you’ll need to
go the third-party route. A quick search on the Internet for “multiband
compressor plug-in” should give you some options.
 Lay off. When you’re not sure whether what you’re doing actually sounds
better, don’t use the processor. Any dynamics processing is going to affect
the quality of your song’s sound to some extent. If adding this processing
doesn’t improve the overall sound, you’re better off not using it.
You can find out more about compression and limiting in Chapter 18.
284
Part IV: Revving Up the Recording Process 

When you’re testing your compressor plug-in or limiter plug-in settings (you
do this by comparing the processed and unprocessed versions), be sure to
have the volume of both versions exactly the same. Any difference in volume
defeats the purpose of a side-by-side comparison because you’re going to
think that the louder one sounds better even if it doesn’t. (See the “Turn it
up!” sidebar.)
Perfecting tonal balance
The tonal balance of a song is how the various frequencies of the music relate
to one another. You’re not concerned with how each individual instrument
sounds in the mix (that’s the job for the mixing stage); instead, what you’re
looking for is an overall balance of frequencies within the hearing spectrum.
For the most part, a tonal balance consists of an even distribution of frequen-
cies from 20 to 10 kHz with a slight drop-off (1 or 2dB) from 10 to 20 kHz or
higher. “That’s great,” you say, “but what does that sound like?” Well, listen to
any number of great CDs, and you’ll hear it.
When you master your music, you want to constantly compare what your
song sounds like to other CDs whose sound you like. Do this by switching
285
Chapter 14: Mixing and Mastering Your Music
Turn it up!
Everyone wants his or her music to be as loud
as possible. Louder sounds better. In fact, test
after test has shown that when people listen to
two versions of a song, they nearly always
prefer the louder one (whether or not it actually
sounds better).
Musicians, producers, and engineers seem to
be in the middle of a competition to see who can
make the loudest CD. If you compare a CD made
about ten years ago with one made this year,
you’ll notice that the newer one is much louder.
Give them both a good listen, though. Does the
louder one really sound better?
You can test this by setting them both to play at
the same volume and switching back and forth.
(You need to turn the volume up a bit on the
older CD to match the volume of the newer one.)
One way to do this is to record both songs into
your audio recording program and set the levels
of each so that they’re the same. At the same
volume, which song sounds better to you? I’m
willing to bet that, nine out of ten times, you’ll
prefer the older song. This is because older
recordings have more dynamic range than
newer ones. The variety is pleasing to listen to,
whereas the song with only a small dynamic
range quickly becomes tiring.
Do yourself and your listeners a favor and resist
the temptation to compress the dynamic vari-
ability out of your music. It will be much easier
to listen to and have a lot more life and excite-
ment. You can always turn the volume up on
your stereo if it’s not loud enough, but you can’t
add dynamic range after you’ve squashed it out.

between your song and someone else’s while you work. The easiest way to do
this is to import the song you want to compare your music to into your audio
recording program along with your songs.
When you work on adjusting the overall tonal balance of your songs, listen
carefully for any frequencies that seem too loud or too soft. You can find
these by listening to particular instruments in the mix or by using the para-
metric EQ plug-in and sweeping the frequency spectrum. To do this, set your
Q fairly wide (0.6, for instance) and move the Gain slider all the way to the
right. Start with the lowest frequency and slowly raise the frequency as the
song plays by moving the Freq slider from left to right. Adjust any annoying
frequencies by cutting them by a couple decibels to see whether your overall
mix improves.
As far as general EQ guidelines go, try these suggestions:
 If your mix sounds muddy, add high frequencies (above 10 kHz) or cut
low ones (200 to 400 Hz). Likewise, if your mix is too bright (common
with digital recording), try reducing the frequencies above 10 kHz by
using a shelf EQ or a Baxandall curve.
(To use a Baxandall curve, use a parametric EQ and set the threshold at
20 kHz with a Q setting around 1. This gradually cuts frequencies above
around 10 kHz. You can adjust the Q to reach as far down as you want.
Your EQ graph shows you what’s happening.)
 Use the same EQ adjustments for both the right and left channels because
this keeps the stereo balance intact and doesn’t alter the relative phase
between the channels. For example, if you add some bass frequencies
(100 Hz, for example) to the one channel and not the other, you might
hear a wavering or pulsating sound around this frequency go back and
forth between the speakers.
 If you used a multiband compressor on any specific frequencies, you
might need to adjust the EQ for those frequencies; compression tends
to mess with frequency response.
 If you need to adjust the EQ of certain instruments in the mix (the snare
drum is buried, for example), be careful and notice the overall effect of
your adjustments on the rest of the mix. If your adjustments aren’t fixing
the problem, go back to the mixing process and make your adjustments
there. You’ll be glad you took the time to do that.
Any adjustments you make to the EQ during mastering impact more
than just those frequencies. Such adjustments alter the entire frequency
spectrum — and the relationship between all the instruments. So listen
carefully as you make adjustments and back off on the additional EQ if
you don’t like what you hear.
286
Part IV: Revving Up the Recording Process 

For more specific information on EQ and inserting EQ in your tracks, go to
Chapter 16.
Some people employ some pretty sophisticated technology to check the
tonal balance of their songs against that of their favorite CDs. They do this
by recording a song into their mastering program and taking a look at its fre-
quency response by using a spectral analyzer. Not all audio recording pro-
grams come with a spectral analyzer. For example, Logic comes with one in
their Channel EQ plug-in but Pro Tools doesn’t — you need to find a third-
party plug-in in this case. (Chapter 15 has more about finding third-party
plug-ins.) Then do an analysis of your song and compare it to the spectral
analysis of a CD you like. This technique seems to work for many people.
(Not me — I like using my ears instead — but alas, I’m old-fashioned.)
Balancing levels
For a truly professional-sounding CD, you want all your songs to be at nearly
the same relative level so your listeners (I hope you have more than one) don’t
have to adjust the volume on their stereos from song to song.
Balancing the levels of your songs to one another is pretty easy. In fact, in
most cases, you have very little to do after you EQ and optimize the dynam-
ics of each song. You balance the levels from one song to the next in your
audio recording program by putting each track’s fader up to 0dB — this puts
them at the level you mixed them to — and then soloing (silencing all other
tracks in your song) Track 1 and comparing the level to Track 2 by soloing
back and forth.
If you use a mouse to mix, this can be kinda tricky because you can’t press
more than one button at a time. The best way I’ve found to deal with this 
situation — at least the best way in Pro Tools — is to follow these steps:
1. In the Track Controls section of Track 1, click the Solo button to solo
the track.
You hear only Track 1 in your monitors.
2. In the Track Controls section of Track 1, click the Mute button so both
the Solo and Mute buttons for Track 1 are engaged.
Track 1 is silent.
3. In the Track Controls section of Track 2, quickly click the Solo button.
You now hear Track 2.
287
Chapter 14: Mixing and Mastering Your Music

4. To switch back to hearing Track 1, click Track 2’s Solo button (disen-
gage it) and — as quickly as possible — click Track 1’s Mute button
(disengaging the Mute button and engaging the Solo button).
You hear Track 1 again.
You get a short bit of silence when following this procedure, but you can still
hear the relative volumes of the two.
Do this procedure for each of the tracks (Track 1 to Track 2, Track 2 to Track 3,
and so on) until you’ve checked all the tracks in your mastering session.
If you miss one of the buttons while you’re doing this quick-switch procedure,
you might end up with both tracks playing at the same time. This will be very
loud because the tracks are summed together in the mix bus. To avoid dam-
aging your speakers — and ears — keep your monitoring (speaker) volume
down pretty low.
If you notice any differences, just raise (or better yet, lower) the levels until
they are all roughly the same. Don’t get too finicky. Some variation from song
to song is okay. In fact, minor differences can help to make your CD more
interesting to listen to. When you’re balancing levels, just make sure that any
differences aren’t enough to make the listener run to his or her stereo to
adjust the volume knob. If one or two songs seem much lower in volume than
the rest, you might want to go back to the volume-optimizing stage and raise
those songs up a bit to make them more consistent with the rest of the songs
on the CD. That way you don’t lower the volume of the entire CD because one
or two songs are too quiet.
Mastering your mix
When you have all your songs dynamically optimized, EQed, and level-balanced
(see the preceding sections) you’re ready to record your final master. This
process is essentially the same as making your final mix, so check out the
“Making Your Mix” section earlier in this chapter for details on how to do this.
You need to do one more thing when mastering, however — this involves get-
ting your songs to the CD format.
Most likely, your session’s songs are recorded at 24 bits, using any number of
possible sample rates (44.1, 48, 88.2, or 96 kHz) — and your final master should
be 16 bit at 44.1 kHz. Making this change can reduce the sound quality of your
music if it’s not done right. This section details how to change the sample rate
and bit depth as you create a final master version of your music.
288
Part IV: Revving Up the Recording Process 

Making the most of your bits
Getting your music from 24 bit to 16 bit means dithering or truncating your files.
This section explains how these processes differ, and gives you pointers on
which one to use so your music sounds as good as possible.
Dithering is the process of adding random noise to your music when 8 bits
get cut from your pristine 24-bit files. This random noise helps keep the quiet
sections of your song (fade-outs, for instance) from sounding grainy when
those 8 bits are removed. Several types of dithering exist — each produces a
slightly different result in a piece of music.
The process of dithering is done differently in each audio recording program.
For example, in Logic you can choose the Dither option within the Bounce
dialog box when you make your bounce. Pro Tools, on the other hand,
requires that you use a dithering plug-in and insert it into the master fader
for your song. You do this by inserting one of the two dithering plug-ins into
one of the inserts in your master fader, and then following the steps for
mixing your music (which I detail in the “Making Your Mix” section earlier in
this chapter). The dithering happens automatically as your song is mixed (or,
in this case, mastered).
Truncation involves simply cutting off the last 8 bits of information. This option
works well for material that doesn’t have quiet sections (for example, hard
rock with punchy endings that don’t fade out).
To master your music using truncation in Pro Tools, for example, follow the
steps in the “Making Your Mix” section earlier in this chapter for mixing your
song and choose 16-bit as your Bounce to Disk resolution. This cuts off the
last 8 bits without otherwise processing the signal (which makes this process
different from dithering).
To dither or not to dither (and which dithering option to use)? That is the
question. No universal answer exists. The only way to know which sounds
better on your music is to try mastering with dithering and without it (in
which case your file is truncated instead). For the most part, songs with quiet
passages and fade-outs often sound better if you dither ’em.
Mastering to 16 bits
When you master — regardless of whether you’re using the dithering or the
truncating approach — make sure you select the 16-bit option under the
Resolution drop-down list. (In Pro Tools, for example, it’s located in the
Bounce dialog box, as shown in Figure 14-6.) If you have a dithering plug-in
inserted into your master fader, your music is dithered while it’s being
bounced; if you don’t use a dithering plug-in, your music is truncated.
289
Chapter 14: Mixing and Mastering Your Music

Settling on a sample rate
If you recorded at any sample rate other than 44.1 kHz, you need to do a
sample rate conversion (SRC) process. SRC can change the sound of your
song (and not for the better). Your best bet when bouncing from one sample
rate to another is to set the conversion quality as high as possible if your
audio recording program offers you the choice. The following steps show
how to do this in Pro Tools:
1. Choose Setups➪Preferences.
The Preferences dialog box appears.
2. Click the Edit tab of the Preferences dialog box.
3. Click the Conversion Quality drop-down list in the center of the Edit
tab, as shown in Figure 14-7, and select TweakHead if you want the
highest quality possible.
It takes a while to process (go get a cup of coffee or read your favorite
gear magazine while you wait), but I think it’s worth it.

290
Part IV: Revving Up the Recording Process 

You have several options for sample rate conversion quality. Don’t take my
anal-retentive word for which works best for your music. Do some experi-
menting on your own. One of the lower-quality conversion settings might
work just fine (and you won’t have to wait so long while your song is being
processed).
When you actually bounce your song to disk, you need to choose 44.1 kHz
from the Sample Rate drop-down list. In Pro Tools, it’s located in the center of
the Bounce dialog box, as shown in Figure 14-8.
I might sound a bit old-fashioned here, but I’m a big fan of recording all my
music to 44.1 kHz so I don’t have to do a sample rate conversion when I
master my music (assuming I’m mastering for CD release). To my ears, the
loss in quality is significant. The only time I ever record at a higher rate is if
I know I’ll be sending my music to be mastered by a professional. Most top-
notch mastering houses have top-notch sample rate conversion gear.
Burning Your CD Master
When you have your mastered mixes all done (see the mastering sections ear-
lier in this chapter), your last step in the process is burning all your songs on
a CD so that you can make the number of copies that you need. This process
involves sequencing your songs and burning them onto a blank CD in the
proper format. The following sections show you the way.

Chapter 14: Mixing and Mastering Your Music

I don’t go into detail about having mass quantities of your music made in this
book because there just isn’t enough room for it. You can find info on CD
duplication and replication in my Home Recording For Musicians For Dummies
book or you can do an Internet search using “CD duplication” or “CD replica-
tion” as keywords. A ton of places perform these services. Many offer lots of
information about the process.
Getting what you need
You need to own a couple things in order to burn your final master onto a CD.
These include
 A CD burner in your computer: Chances are you have one on your com-
puter. If you don’t, you need to get one. My recommendation is to get the
fastest burner you can find (and afford). You’ll likely be burning a lot of
CDs — various mix options for each of your songs to play in your home
stereo, boombox, or car, for example — and a fast burner will save you a
ton of time.
 CD-burning software that can burn Red Book CDs: Red Book CDs are
the industry standard protocol for audio CDs. Most CD-burning software
can handle burning audio CDs, but some software isn’t Red Book compli-
ant. They can burn a CD just fine for you to play in your various CD play-
ers, some data might be missing that your CD replicator (the people who
make mass quantities that you can sell) needs, such as PQ subcodes.
(PQ subcodes are data imbedded in the CD that provides time code infor-
mation on each track on the CD.)
 High-quality CDs that record well in your burner: Not all CD-Rs are cre-
ated equal. Some have flimsy reflective surfaces and are prone to getting
scratches that affect their playback, but others are much more durable.
Some CD-Rs also have a higher error rate in some CD burners. (I don’t
know why this is, it just is.) The best thing you can do is look for high-
quality CD-Rs (you can find “Gold” or “archive quality” discs that are
rated to last 20+ years) and try a few brands out in your burner. Just
don’t buy the cheapest CD-Rs you can find — they might not hold up for
the long run. If you find a brand that works for you, stick with it, and if
you find a brand that produces a high rate of coasters, skip it.
Sequencing your songs
Sequencing your songs consists of choosing the order of the songs on the CD
as well as the amount of silence between songs. Chances are that when you
292
Part IV: Revving Up the Recording Process 

wrote and recorded your songs, you had an idea about the order in which
you wanted them to appear on your final CD. If you don’t know how you want
to arrange your songs, here are some things to consider:
 Consider each song’s tempo in the sequencing equation. Some CDs work
well if songs with a similar tempo are grouped together, but others work
best when contrasting songs follow one another.
 Think about a song’s lyrics and how they relate to the lyrics from the
other songs on your CD. If you want to tell your listener a story, consider
how the order of the songs can best tell that story.
 Think about the chords that you used in each song and how they relate to
another song you might want to place before or after it in the sequence.
The ending chord of one song might conflict with the beginning chord of
another — or lead right in.
For most recordists, sequencing has more to do with the actual process of
placing each song in its proper place on the CD than with trying to decide
where that proper place might actually be. I cover the placement process in
detail in this section.
Most of the sequencing process involves deciding how much time to place
between the songs on your CD. No set amount of time has to be placed
between songs. Choose what seems right for the two songs you’re working
with. Sometimes you might want just a second or two; other times four or five
seconds is more appropriate. For example, if you have a mellow ballad fol-
lowed by an upbeat song, you might want to leave a little more time between
these two songs so the listener is prepared for the faster song. (Try leaving a
space that lasts about 4 to 6 beats at the slower song’s tempo, for instance.)
On the other hand, if you want two tunes to flow together, you can leave less
time in between. Use your ears and think about how you want your listener
to respond when the music moves from one song to another.
Making a CD for mass production
If you intend to send your CD-R to a duplication or replication company to
have it mass-produced, you need to do certain things. Here are a few things
to keep in mind:
 Check for physical defects to the CD-R before you try to burn to it.
Scratches, fingerprints, smudges, and other imperfections on the mirror
side (bottom) of the CD-R can cause errors in the data. Be sure to use a
clean and unblemished CD-R for burning your master. After all, CD-Rs are
cheap.
293
Chapter 14: Mixing and Mastering Your Music

 Always write your master CD by using the Disc at Once or Write Disk
mode. This allows the CD to be read as a Red Book audio CD. Your other
option when recording a CD is Track at Once. Track at Once burns one
song (track) at a time and produces more errors than Disc at Once, which
burns the entire CD at one time. Because of the errors present on CDs
burned with Track at Once, mass producer’s equipment can’t read — and
therefore summarily reject — CDs that people produce with this method.
(In fact, many older CD players for homes and cars can’t read these CDs
either.) So be sure that you use Disc at Once whenever you make a CD of
your mastered music.
 If you can, use an error-detection software program to check for errors
in your recorded CD. If you don’t have access to an error-detection pro-
gram, check the back of the CD for any blemishes (just like you did before
recording onto it).
 Listen carefully to your entire CD after you record it. Compare it with
your original file and make sure that the CD is perfect. Also, spend time
reevaluating the order of the songs. Make sure that they flow well
together.
 Use a felt-tip marker to label your finished CD master, not a ballpoint
pen or an adhesive label (paper or plastic). A ballpoint pen can damage
the surface of the CD. Adhesive labels can slow the rotation speed of the
CD and can cause errors in the duplication or replication process. They
have also been known to come off inside a duplication machine, clogging
the works.
 Label the CD master with the name of your album and all your contact
info. Use a felt-tip marker, of course, and write on the top of the disc. Your
contact information should include your name (or your band’s name),
your phone number, and the date the master was made.
 Make three CD-Rs of your mastered music. Keep one safe in your studio
and send two to the duplication or replication company. This ensures
that, if one of the two CDs that you send off for mass production has an
error, you don’t waste any time sending the company a replacement.
 Prepare a PQ subcode log. PQ subcodes are additional information
written on the CD that provides time code information, such as track
numbers and start and stop times of each track. If your CD burner soft-
ware doesn’t support PQ subcodes, make a list of the start and stop time
of each track (referenced from the start of the CD) on a separate piece of
paper — as well as the track number and length of each track — and
send it along with your CD masters. If your software program can gener-
ate a PQ subcode log, print it and send it with your CD master.
294
Part IV: Revving Up the Recording Process 

If you’re burning a CD for a major record label, first of all congratulations,
and secondly you need to supply ISRC codes with your CD. ISRC stands for
International Standard Recording Code, and it contains information about the
CD, such as the owner of the song, the country of origin, year of release, and
serial number. You enter ISRC codes into a dialog box on most CD-burning
programs, and the information is placed within the PQ subcodes.
Protecting your rights
Before you put your music out into the world, get it copyrighted. Getting a
copyright on your music is easy and relatively inexpensive, so there’s no
reason not to do it. If you’re a United States citizen, all you have to do is fill
out an SR (sound recording) form and send it into the copyright office at the
Library of Congress. You can find the form at www.loc.gov/copyright/
forms, or you can call the copyright office at 202-707-9100 to have it mailed
to you. Choose (or ask for) the Form SR with Instructions. The current cost for
filing the form is $30, but double-check this fee before you send it in, because
it’s been known to go up. (Hey, it’s the government.) You can fill out one form
for each CD, so the cost per song isn’t very high. (Citizens of other countries

P
art V introduces you to one of the most powerful
tools in the computer-recording world: plug-ins. 
Plug-ins are software processors that you plug in to your
instrument tracks. Chapter 15 provides the basics on
these these powerful tools and shows you how to (er . . .)
plug them in to your songs. Chapter 16 examines equal-
izer plug-ins that you can use to sculpt the frequency
characteristics of your tracks. Chapter 17 shows you how
to add effects — including reverb and delay — to make
your tracks shine. Chapter 18 digs into the role of dynam-
ics processors and shows you how to use them to improve
the sound of your tracks.

udio recording programs — nice programs that they are — let you use
plug-ins to alter the sound of your audio data. Plug-ins are digital signal
processing (DSP) tools that you can run your tracks through — as a send or
line effect or as an offline processor. Typical plug-ins include equalizers, com-
pressors, reverbs, and delays — all of which can be important parts of the
mixing process in multi-track recording. Such tools allow you to get all your
tracks to sound the way you want and help you get them to blend together in
a pleasing way.
In this chapter, I introduce you to plug-ins. I describe the role of plug-ins in
mixing your music and describe the many ways you can use them. I also shed
light on the many types of plug-in formats and processing approaches. This
chapter ends with a look at the differences between native and third-party
plug-ins and also steers you to some places where you can find third-party
plug-ins to fit your audio recording software.
Recognizing the Role of Plug-Ins
Plug-ins are an important part of your computer-based system and one of the
things that sets it apart from your old tape deck. Plug-ins allow you to process
the sound of your instrument in an almost unlimited variety of ways. These
can range from basic effects — stuff such as reverb or delay — to tricks such
as raising the overall volume of your track (called normalizing your track) or
changing the pitch of an instrument.

By using plug-ins, you can process your tracks in one of two ways:
 Real time: Real-time processing means that your audio is processed as
your song plays. This approach puts a load on your computer, so the
number of plug-ins you can run at one time depends on how powerful
your computer is. This is the approach you use when you actually mix
songs and you want to add effects to your tracks.
 Offline: Using plug-ins offline means you process the audio when your
song isn’t playing; you end up with a new audio file that includes your
newly processed audio. This is common for some usual processing
chores, such as normalizing, quantizing, transposing, and other new-
fangled audio processing approaches. The ways you can process your
audio offline depend on your audio recording program and the plug-ins
you have loaded into your system.
Some audio recording programs, such as Apple’s Logic, have a freeze function
that lets you apply your effect plug-ins (reverb, compression, and others) in a
manner similar to that of the offline approach. The difference is that you can
unfreeze your track, adjust your effect parameters, and freeze it again. This
offers the advantage of leaving your processor unburdened by the weight of
your effect as your song plays, thus allowing you to run more plug-ins in your
song without having to get a faster computer.
Taking a Look at Plug-In Types
Plug-ins come in many formats but follow only two different processing
approaches. These facets of plug-ins are covered in this section.
Figuring out formats
When audio recording software programs were first developed, they each
used their own formats for their plug-ins. Because originally no plug-ins were
made by third-party manufacturers, this wasn’t a problem. As recording pro-
grams became popular, third-party plug-ins starting becoming available, and
these third-party makers needed to make some decisions — including which
format to develop their programs in. (Figuring out a catchy name for market-
ing purposes was also high on their To-Do lists.)
The most popular plug-in formats are
 Audio Units: Audio Units (AU) is a format developed by Apple for OS X.
This format is just beginning to gain a wider share of available third-party
plug-ins; it’s used in programs that run on Mac OS X, such as Logic and
Digital Performer.
300
Part V: Playing with Plug-Ins 

 Direct X: Direct X (DX) is a format developed by Microsoft for Windows
systems (sorry Mac users, you can’t use these plug-ins) and is employed
in programs such as SONAR and other Cakewalk products. The DX format
is one of the most common plug-in formats.
 MAS: The MAS format was developed by MOTU for Digital Performer.
This plug-in format isn’t as common as many of the others, and Digital
Performer now uses Audio Units in its program.
 RTAS: Real Time Audio Suite is Digidesign’s proprietary plug-in format
used on Pro Tools LE software (and sometimes Pro Tools TDM).
Numerous RTAS plug-ins are available.
 TDM: TDM plug-ins are Digidesign’s DSP-based plug-ins for the Pro Tools
TDM system. (DSP stands for digital signal processing.) These plug-ins
are host-based plug-ins, which means they run off of the DSP chips for
Pro Tools instead of from the processor in your computer. This has a
couple advantages:
• Your system isn’t stressed by these plug-ins. This is less of an
issue now than it was, say, a couple years ago, because computer-
processing power has improved a lot.
• The makers are insured against piracy. Because these plug-ins
require a computer chip to run, they can’t be copied. This has
resulted in some very high-end plug-ins being developed in this
format.
The problem is that you need a Pro Tools TDM system (which is expen-
sive), and these plug-ins are much more expensive than their non-host-
based counterparts.
 VST: Developed by Steinberg (the maker of Cubase and Nuendo, among
other programs), VST plug-ins are used on both Mac and Windows com-
puters. This is by far the most popular plug-in format and as such you
find lots and lots of options.
You can find special adapters known as wrappers that allow you to use one
format of plug-in in a program that runs on another format. For instance, many
people who used Logic or Digital Performer before OS X (myself included) col-
lected a huge array of VST or MAS plug-ins for their work. When making the
switch to OS X, these plug-ins suddenly became useless. That is until the
FXpansion VST to AU wrapper was introduced (www.fxpansion.com/
product-auadapter-main.php). Now all you have to do is install the wrap-
per and you can run your VST plug-ins in a program that requires an AU plug-
in. This relatively inexpensive option saved many people from having to throw
away their old plug-in collections.
301
Chapter 15: Understanding Plug-Ins

Peeking into processing approaches
Plug-ins come in two varieties: those that run off your computer’s processor
(native) and those that have their own DSP chip to run from (host-based).
This section details the difference.
Native plug-ins
Native plug-ins are those plug-ins included in your audio recording program
and those that you get when you download or buy them as software. Native
plug-ins run off the processing power of your main computer. This used to
limit both the quality of the plug-in and the number of plug-ins you could run
at one time. Because computers are getting more powerful, this isn’t much of
limitation anymore.
Host-based plug-ins
Host-based plug-ins are plug-ins that run off a dedicated processor. Until
recently, unless you had a Pro Tools TDM system you couldn’t take advan-
tage of plug-ins that ran on their own processor chips. Now, with the help of
some savvy third-party manufacturers, no matter what types of audio record-
ing software you use, you can use plug-ins that don’t put stress on your com-
puter. Currently, two options are available:
 TC Powercore: The TC Powercore is available as a PCI card that you put
into one of the PCI slots in your computer or as a FireWire unit that you
plug in to a FireWire port in your computer. (The latter approach lets you
use the Powercore with a laptop.) This unit has lots of good plug-ins. The
reverbs stand out as some of the best available. You can find out more
about TC Powercore at www.tcelectronic.com/powercoreconcept.
 Universal Audio UAD 1: The UAD 1 is available only as a PCI card at this
time, so this option can’t be used unless you have a free PCI slot in your
computer. The UAD 1 is known for having some dynamite dynamics
processors, including a great limiter and compressor. Check out www.
uaudio.com for more information.
Host-based plug-ins are always sold with some sort of processor chip and can’t
be used without the host processor. These plug-ins often sound very good, but
you pay more for them because you’re buying hardware as well as software.
After you have the hardware in place, though, you can often buy more plug-ins
to run on your host’s processor, making this option expandable.
Using Plug-Ins in Your Songs
Plug-ins are easy to use. All you have to do is install them and route your
track into the one of your choice. This section lays out the process.
302
Part V: Playing with Plug-Ins 

Installing plug-ins
Your audio recording program already comes with some plug-ins pre-installed.
The included plug-ins range from merely okay to exceptional. If you want to
buy or download additional plug-ins to use in your program, you need to install
them so that your audio recording program can recognize and use them. This
process is usually as easy as clicking the Install icon that pops up on-screen
after inserting the software CD — or appears when you double-click the plug-in
folder that you downloaded. At times, however, you might have to install your
plug-ins by hand. For example, if you have more than one audio recording pro-
gram in your computer — and you want to use these plug-ins on all of them —
you’ll have to make sure that all your recording programs get clued in to the
presence of the plug-ins. (An automatic Install might circle in on just one pro-
gram and ignore the others.)
This process involves putting your plug-ins in the proper folder on your
system hard drive by dragging them there with your mouse. Here’s where
you put them:
 In Windows XP: The location depends on the plug-in format your pro-
gram uses. Check with your plug-in manufacturer for details. Here are
some examples:
• VST plug-ins in Cubase: Place these in C:\ProgramFiles\
Steinberg\Vstplugins.
• MAS plug-ins in SONAR: You can put these in any folder, such as
C:\ProgramFiles\plugins\.
 In Mac OS X: Place your plug-ins in Main User/Library/Application
Support/audio program folder such as Logic/Plug-ins.
If you use more than one audio recording program, you need to put copies of
your plug-ins in the Plug-ins folder of each of your programs. If the plug-ins
aren’t in the application’s Plug-ins folder, it won’t be able to find them.
Plugging in plug-ins
For the most part, you can plug the plug-ins into your track one of two ways:
by inserting them or by using a send. In case you aren’t familiar with these
approaches, here’s the lowdown.
Inserting
Inserting a plug-in involves placing the plug-in in line with your track. This
means that all of the signal from your track is sent through the plug-in, alter-
ing all of its sound. This is common for certain effects, such as dynamics
processors (see Chapter 18) and equalizers (see Chapter 16).
303
Chapter 15: Understanding Plug-Ins

You insert a plug-in into a track the following way (in Logic):
1. Choose Windows➪Show Arrange to make sure the Arrange window is
showing.
2. In the Arrange window, click the name of the track you want to insert
a plug-in into.
The track becomes highlighted, and a channel strip for the track appears
on the left side of the Arrange window.
3. Click one of the Insert bars in the Inserts section of the track’s chan-
nel strip.
The Insert pop-up menu appears, as shown in Figure 15-1.
4. Choose your desired plug-in type — EQ, Compressor, Delay, whatever.
5. Choose the plug-in from the expanded pop-up menu (Channel EQ in
the case of Figure 15-1).
6. Release the mouse to choose the plug-in.
The Plug-In window opens, as shown in Figure 15-2; here’s where you set
your parameters, such as frequency, gain/slope, and Q.
7. Play your track by clicking the Play button in the Transport window.
Your session plays, and you hear the effect of your plug-in on your track.
You can then tweak the parameters as your song plays.
Figure 15-1:

Part V: Playing with Plug-Ins 

You can use the Bypass button located in the upper-left corner of the plug-in
window to test the sound of your plug-in. Toggle (click with your mouse) the
Bypass button to turn the plug-in off and on. Toggling lets you compare the
unaffected and effected track. If the effected sound isn’t better than the unaf-
fected sound, you’re better off not using the plug-in for that track (or it might
be time to try some different settings).
Using a Send
A Send is a mixer-routing function that lets you apply an effect to only part of
the sound of a track and not to an entire signal as with an Insert. You do this
through a bus (audio terminology for the path that a send takes). Using a
Send to add the plug-in to your track’s sound lets you alter the sound sent
through the Send and then mix it with your original unaffected sound. This is
a common approach for plug-in effects such as reverb.
Follow these steps to use a Send for your plug-in (again, in Logic):
1. Select one of the buses from the Send selector in each track’s channel
strip that you want to route to the effect.
You can view a track’s channel strip in the Environment window (choose
Windows➪Environment if the window isn’t open) or in the Arrange
window. To open a track’s channel strip in the Arrange window, click the
track name in the Arrange window to highlight it. The channel strip
appears on the left.
When you release your mouse after selecting the bus, the bus is listed,
and a trim pot (knob) appears next to the bus number, as shown in
Figure 15-3.
Figure 15-2:

window

Insert menu.

Chapter 15: Understanding Plug-Ins

2. Adjust the trim pot to a moderate level.
I usually start with about –15dB.
3. Double-click the bus number.
You’re taken to the Bus Channel strip in the Environment window, where
you can choose the effect to insert into the bus.
4. By using the Insert selector pop-up menu in the Bus Channel strip,
select the effects plug-in you want to use from the Inserts pop-up
menu.
The Effect Plug-In window opens. Here you can set your parameters.
(For instance, if you’re working with a reverb plug-in, you can set the
pre-delay, reverb time, and room type.)
5. Play your track by clicking the Play button in the Transport window.
Your session plays, and you hear the effect of your plug-in on your track.
You can then tweak the plug-in parameters or the Send level for your
track as your song plays.
Processing your audio
In addition to plugging in processors directly into your tracks, many pro-
grams let you process your audio data by using a plug-in offline. This means
that you select your audio data from a track and process it while your song
isn’t playing.

Part V: Playing with Plug-Ins 

Processing your audio this way generally (depending on your audio record-
ing program, of course) alters your original file permanently. If you want to
keep your original file intact, you need to make a copy of your original data
from which to work. This process is pretty simple. In Pro Tools, for example,
just do the following:
1. Select the audio you want to duplicate in one of your tracks.
You do this by using the Selector tool and clicking and dragging over
your selection to highlight it.
2. Choose AudioSuite➪Duplicate.
The Duplicate menu opens.
3. Click Process to duplicate your track’s audio file.
This process might take a few minutes depending on the length of the
file and the power of your computer.
When the duplication is complete, you can work with this new file and not
have to worry about losing your original data.
Finding Good Plug-Ins
Finding quality plug-ins for any audio recording program is pretty easy. The
most difficult part is sifting between the decent ones and the garbage. The
following is a list of the most common third-party effects (Chapter 21 lists
some free or really cheap — as in inexpensive — plug-ins):
 Sonalksis: Sonalksis makes some nice EQ and compression plug-ins.
Check out www.sonalksis.com/index.php?section_id=17&area_id=8
for more information.
 PSP Audioware: PSP makes quite a few great plug-ins. I’ve been using its
Vintage Warmer tape saturation emulator for several years. This is a great-
sounding plug-in (as long as you don’t use too much, anyway) for adding a
nice approximation of the glue (the pleasing harmonic distortion that can
make sounds blend better) that analog tape imparts to audio tracks when
driven hard. You can find out more at www.pspaudioware.com.
 Voxengo: These are some really decent plug-ins. The only problem is that
they’re for Windows PCs only. I’ve used (and liked) its EQ plug-ins — it
has several. You can find out more about Voxengo at www.voxengo.com.
 Waves Audio Ltd.: The Waves plug-ins are some of the most popular,
and many people I know and respect use its compressors and reverbs
daily. They’re expensive, but for many users they’re worth it. You can
find out more at www.waves.com.

Chapter 16
Using Equalization
In This Chapter

 Getting to know EQ options
 Equalizing your tracks
E
qualization (EQ) is the process of changing the frequency response of the
data in the session’s track to make the track sound the way you want it
to sound. The main goal when EQing during the mix process is to get the
instruments in your song to smoothly blend together.
In this chapter, you discover the types of equalizers used in multi track
recording. Most audio recording programs handle their EQ tasks similarly so,
I use Pro Tools and Logic as examples, but they should be close to the pro-
gram you use. I also provide some basic EQ settings for a variety of instru-
ments to get you started EQing your songs.
Exploring Equalization
The most useful tool you have for mixing is equalization (EQ). You use equal-
izers to adjust the various frequencies of your instruments so that there’s
enough “room” for each instrument in your stereo mix. Basically, you want to
carve out a reserved space for each instrument in the sonic landscape you’re
creating so that there’s room for each instrument to get its point across with-
out stepping on the toes of the other instruments.
Audio recoding programs typically offer three types of equalizers — parametric,
low-shelf/high-shelf, and low-pass/high-pass. I outline these types of EQ in the
following sections. (The graphic equalizers I discuss in Chapter 1 are not avail-
able as plug-ins; you’ll only find them as standalone units.)

Parametric
The parametric equalizer (the Pro Tools icon for this EQ is shown in the
margin) allows you to choose the frequency that you want to change as well
as the range of frequencies around that frequency. With a parametric EQ, you
dial in the frequency that you want to change and then set the range itself
(referred to as the Q) that you want to affect.
The Q is a number that signifies the range of frequencies that the EQ affects —
traditionally between 0.5 and 2 octaves, but recently programs have been offer-
ing more. Pro Tools offers settings from 0.33 to 12, whereas Logic offers a range
between 0.10 and 100. The lower numbers universally allow larger ranges of fre-
quencies to be EQed, and the higher numbers affect smaller ranges of frequen-
cies. Unfortunately, no set formula exists for determining what these numbers
represent in octaves — you have to adjust each of them based on your ears
instead of the actual numbers.
You choose your Q setting based on what you hear in the mix. Just as you
can experiment with different frequencies to adjust in the mix, you can also
try different Q settings to find the best possible frequency range to use.
The beauty of a parametric EQ is that you can take a small band (range) of
frequencies and boost (increase) or cut (decrease) them. This enables you to
get the various instruments in a mix to fit in with one another. (Audio geeks
call this carving out frequencies.) When you’re mixing, the parametric EQ is
the most useful equalizer because you can adjust the frequency response of
each instrument so that you can clearly hear the other instruments in the
mix. The only downside to parametric EQs is that they need processing
power to run. If you have a lot of EQing to do, you might end up stressing
your system pretty hard — yet another reason to have a powerful computer.
Low-shelf/high-shelf
A shelf equalizer affects a range of frequencies above (high-shelf) or below
(low-shelf) the target frequency. Shelf EQs are generally used to roll off the
top or bottom end of the frequency spectrum. For example, you can set a
low-shelf EQ to roll off the frequencies below 250 hertz (Hz), which reduces
the amount of rumble (low-frequency noise) in a recording. You generally use
the shelf EQ to adjust the lowest and highest frequencies and the parametric
EQ to adjust any in-between frequencies when you mix.
In most audio recording programs, the low- and high-shelf EQs are designated
with the icons that you see here in the margin.
310
Part V: Playing with Plug-Ins 

Low-pass/high-pass
Believe it or not, sometimes your track just sounds better if you eliminate a
few carefully chosen frequencies. You just need to know which ones to target.
That’s where a couple computer-based audio recording program capabilities
can help with the needed audio acrobatics: low-pass (ducking the high frequen-
cies you don’t want) and high-pass (jumping over the low frequencies you don’t
want).
This type of EQ is actually called a filter — it filters out frequencies either
higher (low-pass) or lower (high-pass) than the target frequency. The high-
pass filter is useful for getting rid of unwanted low frequencies, and the low-
pass filter is used for eliminating unwanted high frequencies. In most audio
recording programs, the low- and high-pass filters are designated with the
icons that you see here in the margin.
Dialing In EQ
Before you start EQing your tracks, you need to know how to insert the EQ
plug-in into a track and how to actually make any adjustments by using the
EQ plug-ins in your recording program. Each program is going to do this a bit
differently, but they all follow the same basic idea. I’m hoping that if I show
how to do these tasks in two programs — the ever-popular Pro Tools and
Logic Pro programs — you’ll have something to go on when EQing in what-
ever program you’re working with.
Inserting an EQ plug-in in a track
To EQ a track, you first need to insert the plug-in into the track. To do this in
Pro Tools, follow these steps:
1. Choose Display➪Mix Window Shows➪Inserts to make sure that the
Inserts section is showing in the Mix window.
The Inserts section appears at the top of each track’s channel strip.
2. Click the top arrow on the left side of the Inserts section of the track’s
channel strip.
The Insert pop-up menu appears, as shown in Figure 16-1.
3. Choose either the Multi-Channel Plug-In or the Multi-Mono Plug-In
option, depending on what type of track you have.
If your track is stereo, use Multi-Channel; if it’s mono, use Multi-Mono.
311
Chapter 16: Using Equalization

4. Choose either the 1-Band EQ II or 4-Band EQ II option.
Your chosen EQ plug-in window opens. (The 1-Band EQ II option lets you
set one EQ parameter, whereas the 4-Band EQ II option lets you work
with four parameters. For more on which option would work best for
you, check out the following section.)
5. Adjust the parameters that you want to EQ.
You can find the particulars for each kind of EQ — parametric, low-shelf/
high-shelf, and low-pass/high-pass — later in the chapter.
If you want to EQ a bunch of tracks in Pro Tools at the same time and use the
same settings (submixes, for example), you can do this the following way:
1. Select one of the buses (the path that the Sends use to route a signal)
from the Output selector in each track that you want to submix.
2. Choose File➪New Track.
The New Track dialog box appears.
3. Use the drop-down lists to enter the number of tracks that you want
(1), the type (Auxiliary Input), and whether you want your track in
stereo.
4. Use your new track’s Input selector to select the bus that you used for
the output of the submix tracks as the input for this auxiliary track.
5. Insert one of the EQ plug-ins from the Insert pop-up menu in this aux-
iliary track.
The EQ Plug-In window opens.
6. Adjust the EQ settings to get the sound that you want.
You can find the particulars for each kind of EQ — parametric, low-shelf/
high-shelf, and low-pass/high-pass — later in the chapter.

Part V: Playing with Plug-Ins 

Examining EQ options
Using an EQ in computer-based audio recording programs consists of select-
ing one of the plug-ins, inserting it into the track that you want to affect, and
then setting your parameters. Most programs come with a nice selection of
EQ plug-in options. The most useful are multiband EQ, such as the 4-band EQ
in Pro Tools (see Figure 16-2) and the Channel EQ in Logic (shown in Figure
16-3). As its name suggests, multiband EQ lets you apply different levels of
equalization to specific frequencies, and is really great if you have to tweak
your bass guitar so that it doesn’t get lost behind the kick drum, for example.
All audio programs allow you to use third-party EQ plug-ins as long as they are
in the supported format (Pro Tools uses RTAS, and Logic uses AU; Chapter 15
has more on these format types), but any such plug-ins have to be purchased
separately. If you do an Internet search with the keywords RTAS plug-ins (Pro
Tools) or AU Plug-ins (Logic), you’re sure to find tons to choose from.
Pro Tools’ 4-band EQ
The 4-band EQ in Pro Tools, shown in Figure 16-2, lets you adjust up to four EQ
filters to a track. This type of EQ is useful when you have to do some major
EQing to a track. You can choose from a low-shelf, a high-shelf, and two para-
metric (Peak) EQs.
In the 4-Band EQ Plug-In window, the high-shelf is located at the top of the
window and the low-shelf at the bottom. The two parametric EQs are located
between the two shelf EQs.

Chapter 16: Using Equalization

Logic’s Channel EQ
Logic’s Channel EQ is an 8-band EQ with four parametric bands, one high-
shelf EQ, one low-shelf EQ, one high-pass filter, and one low-pass filter. As you
can see in Figure 16-3, the EQ types are listed at the top of the graph, but the
adjustments for these bands are located under the main graph.
Logic’s EQ has a really great feature where you can see the frequency response
of your track. This function is engaged by clicking the Analyzer button on the
left side of the plug-in window. This is handy because, with the Analyzer button
engaged, you can actually see the changes you’re making to your track as you
make them. This is also a potential problem because many people rely on their
eyes instead of their ears. Be careful not to let what you see affect what you
hear.
Using parametric EQ
To use the parametric EQ, click the Peak EQ button in the EQ plug-in window
you have open. You have three settings to adjust:
 Gain: This is the amount of boost (increase) or cut (decrease) that you
apply to the signal. In Pro Tools, you can either type in the amount in the
text box next to the Peak EQ button or use the slider to the right. In
Logic, to get your boost (gain) amount, you can either point your mouse
over the parameter and click and drag up or down or you can click in
the EQ graph above the parameter controls and drag up or down.
 Freq: This frequency is the center of the EQ. You select the range of fre-
quencies above and below this point by using the Q setting (see next
bullet). In Pro Tools, you can either type the frequency in the text box on
the left or you can use the slider to make your adjustment. In Logic, to
get the desired frequency you can either point your mouse over the

parameter and click and drag up or down or you can click in the EQ
graph above the parameter controls and drag left or right.
 Q: This is the range of frequencies that your EQ will affect. The higher
the number, the narrower the range that gets EQed. In Pro Tools, you
adjust this setting either by moving the slider or by clicking in the text
box and typing a value between 0.33 and 12. In Logic, you can point your
mouse over the parameter and click and drag up or down to get the Q
value you want. Your settings can be anywhere from 0.10 to 100.
Using low-shelf/high-shelf EQ
To use low-shelf/high-shelf EQ, click the Low Shelf and High Shelf buttons in
the EQ plug-in window. When you use low-shelf/high-shelf EQ, you have two
parameters to adjust in Pro Tools and three on Logic:
 Gain: This is the amount of boost or cut that you apply to the signal. In
Pro Tools, you can either type in the amount in the text box next to the
shelf button or use the slider to the right. In Logic, to set the boost (gain)
you can either point your mouse over the parameter and click and drag
up or down or you can click in the EQ graph above the parameter controls
and drag up or down.
 Freq: This is the starting frequency for the shelf. In Pro Tools, you can
either type in the frequency in the text box or use the slider to make
your adjustment. In Logic, to set your desired frequency you can either
point your mouse over the parameter and click and drag up or down or
you can click in the EQ graph above the parameter controls and drag left
or right.
 Q: This is the steepness of your EQ’s shelf in Logic. (Pro Tools doesn’t
have this option.) The higher the number, the steeper the shelf that’s
applied — meaning that you have a narrower range of frequencies that
are affected to create the gain change of the shelf. To adjust this parame-
ter, you can point your mouse over the parameter and click and drag up
or down to get the Q value you want. Your settings can be anywhere
from 0.10 to 2.
Using low-pass/high-pass EQ
Here’s where you tell your plug-in which frequencies to avoid in the course of
adjusting the EQ. The low- and high-pass buttons appear in the margin.
To use the low- or high-pass filter, click the appropriate button in the EQ
window. In Pro Tools, the only option to set is Freq, which is the frequency
that the filter begins filtering. Any frequency below (high-pass) or above (low-
pass) the setting is removed from the track. You can either type the frequency
in the text box or use the slider to make your adjustment.
315
Chapter 16: Using Equalization

In Logic, you have the same three settings — frequency, gain/slope, and Q —
as the rest of the EQ types. And as with the other EQ types, you adjust the set-
tings by pointing your mouse over the column of the setting and clicking and
dragging the parameter that you want to adjust. With the high-pass and low-
pass EQ (filters), the gain/slope parameter adjusts the slope of the filter — how
quickly it totally cuts off the frequency.
Equalizing Your Tracks
Only so many frequencies are available for all the instruments in a mix. If mul-
tiple instruments occupy a particular frequency range, they can get in each
other’s way and muddy the mix. Your goals when EQing during the mixing
process are to reduce the frequencies that add clutter and/or to enhance the
frequencies that define an instrument’s sound. To do this, make a little space
for each instrument within the same general frequency range, which you can
accomplish by EQing the individual tracks as you mix. The first part of this
chapter shows you how to get up to the point of doing some EQing. The rest
of the chapter gets your hands dirty with some real EQing experience.
Here’s a good trick to use when initially trying to decide which frequencies to
boost or cut: First, solo the track(s) that you’re working on and set your para-
metric EQ to a narrow Q setting (a high number). Next, turn the boost all the
way up (move the Gain slider all the way to the right) and sweep the frequency
setting as you listen. (To sweep, just move the Freq slider to the left and right.)
Noticing the areas where the annoying or pleasing sounds are located can help
you better understand the frequencies that your instrument produces. When
you find a frequency to adjust, experiment with the Q setting to find the range
that produces the best sound, and then adjust the amount of boost or cut until
it has the effect that you want.
After you determine the frequencies that you want to work with, do your
EQing to the individual track while the instrument is in the mix (not soloed).
You want to make the instrument fit as well as possible with the rest of the
instruments, and to do this you need to know how your instrument sounds in
relation to all the music going on around it.
Your goal when making adjustments in EQ is to make all the tracks blend
together as well as possible. In some instances, you might have to make some
radical EQ moves. Don’t be afraid to do whatever it takes to make your mix
sound good — even if it means having cuts or boosts as great as 12dB or more.

General guidelines
Although some instruments do call for specific EQ guidelines, you need to
think about some general considerations when EQing, regardless of the instru-
ment involved. When it comes to the audible frequency spectrum (which is
about 20 Hz to 20 kHz), certain frequencies have special characteristics:
 Frequencies below 100 Hz can either warm up an instrument or add
boominess to it.
 Frequencies between 100 and 200 Hz can be muddy for some instru-
ments and can add fullness to others.
 Frequencies around 400 Hz can sound boxy.
 Frequencies around 800 Hz can add depth or body.
 The 1-kHz to 2-kHz frequencies can add attack (initial signal) or punch
(pronounced attack) to some instruments and can create a nasally
sound in others.
 Frequencies from 2 kHz to 5 kHz can increase the presence of 
instruments.
 Frequencies of 5 kHz to 8 kHz can sound harsh on some instruments.
 Frequencies from 8 kHz to 17 kHz add airiness or brightness to an 
instrument.
You’re generally better off cutting a frequency than boosting one. This belief
goes back to the days of analog EQs, which often added noise when boosting
a signal. This can still be a factor with some digital EQs, but the issue is much
less. Out of habit, I still try to cut frequencies before I boost them, and I recom-
mend that you do the same (not out of habit, of course, but because if a noise
difference exists between cutting and boosting, you might as well avoid it).
The exact frequencies that you end up cutting or boosting depend on three
factors: the sound you’re after, the tonal characteristic of the instrument, and
the relationship between all the instruments in the song. In the following sec-
tions, I list a variety of frequencies to cut or boost for each instrument. If you
don’t want to follow all the suggestions, choose only the ones that fit with
your goals.
Use parametric EQ when you’re trying to get your tracks to fit together.
Parametric EQ gives you the greatest control over the range of frequencies
you can adjust. You can often successfully use the other EQ types (high-shelf,
low-shelf, high-pass, low-pass) for the top or bottom frequencies that I list in
the following sections.
317
Chapter 16: Using Equalization

To adjust frequencies by using Pro Tool’s EQ plug-ins, use the Frequency
slider to choose the frequency you want to EQ and the Gain slider to control
the amount of EQ that you boost (move the slider to the right) or cut (move
the slider to the left) from your track. In Logic, you can point your cursor the
frequency in the graphic section of the EQ window and click and drag up or
down to adjust the gain.
Vocals
For the majority of popular music, the vocals are the most important instru-
ment in the song. You need to hear them clearly, and they should contain the
character of the singer’s voice and style. One of the most common mistakes
in mixing vocals is to make them too loud. The next most common mistake is
to make them too quiet. (The second mistake most often occurs when a shy
or self-conscious vocalist is doing the mixing.) You want the lead vocals to
shine through, but you don’t want them to overpower the other instruments.
The best way to do this is to EQ the vocal tracks so they can sit nicely in the
mix and still be heard clearly. The following guidelines can help you do this.
Lead
The lead vocal can go a lot of ways, depending on the singer and the style of
music. For the most part, I tend to cut a little around 200 Hz and add a couple
decibels at 3 kHz and again at 10 kHz. In general, follow these guidelines:
 To add fullness, add a few decibels at 150 Hz.
 To get rid of muddiness, cut a few decibels at 200 to 250 Hz.
 To add clarity, boost a little at 3 kHz.
 For more presence, add at 5 kHz.
 To add air or to brighten, boost at 10 kHz.
 To get rid of sibilance, cut a little between 7.5 and 10 kHz.
Backup
To keep backup vocals from competing with lead vocals, cut the backup
vocals a little in the low end (below 250 Hz) and at the 2.5- to 3.5-kHz range.
To add clarity, boost a little around 10 kHz without letting it get in the way of
the lead vocal.
Guitar
For the most part, you want to avoid getting a muddy guitar sound and make
sure that the guitar attack comes through in the mix.
318
Part V: Playing with Plug-Ins 

Electric
Electric guitars often need a little cutting below 100 Hz to get rid of muddi-
ness. A boost between 120 and 250 Hz adds warmth. A boost in the 2.5- to 
4-kHz range brings out the attack of the guitar, and a boost at 5 kHz can add
some bite.
Acoustic
Acoustic guitars often do well with a little cut below 80 Hz and again around
800 Hz to 1 kHz. If you want a warmer tone and more body, try boosting a
little around 150 to 250 Hz. Also, try adding a few decibels around 3 to 5 kHz
if you want more attack or punch. A few decibels added at 7 kHz can add a
little more brightness to the instrument.
Bass
This instrument can get muddy pretty fast. The mud generally happens in the
200- to 300-Hz range, so I either leave that alone or cut just a little if the bass
lacks definition. I rarely add any frequencies below 100 Hz. If the instrument
sounds flat or thin, I boost some between 100 and 200 Hz. Adding a little
between 500 Hz and 1 kHz can increase the punch, and a boost between 2.5
and 5 kHz accentuates the attack, adding a little brightness to the bass.
One of the most important things to keep in mind with the bass guitar is to
make sure that it and the kick drum can both be heard. You need to adjust
the frequencies of these two instruments to make room for both. If you add a
frequency to the kick drum, try cutting the same frequency from the bass.
Drums
The guidelines for EQing the drums depend on whether you use live acoustic
drums or a drum machine. (The drum machine probably requires less EQ
because the sounds were already EQed when they were created.) The type
and placement of your mic or mics also affects how you EQ the drums. (You
can find out more about mic placement in Chapter 9.)
Kick
You want the kick drum to blend with the bass guitar. To do this, reduce the
frequencies that the bass guitar takes up. For example, if I boost a few deci-
bels between 100 and 200 Hz for the bass guitar, I generally cut them in the
kick drum (and maybe go as high as 250 Hz). To bring out the bottom end of
the kick drum, I sometimes add a couple of decibels between 80 and 100 Hz.
The kick drum can get boxy sounding (you know, like a cardboard box), so I
319
Chapter 16: Using Equalization

often cut a little between 400 and 600 Hz to get rid of the boxiness. To bring
out the click from the beater hitting the head, try adding a little between 2.5
and 5 kHz. This increases the attack of the drum and gives it more presence.
Snare
The snare drum drives the music, making it the most important drum in pop-
ular music. As such, it needs to really cut through the rest of the instruments.
Although the adjustments that you make depend on the pitch and size of the
drum and whether you used one mic or two during recording, you can usu-
ally boost a little at 100 to 150 Hz for added warmth. You can also try boost-
ing at 250 Hz to add some depth. If the drum sounds too boxy, try cutting at
800 Hz to 1 kHz. A little boost at around 3 to 5 kHz increases the attack, and
an increase in the 8- to 10-kHz range can add crispness to the drum.
If you used two mics during recording, you might consider dropping a few
decibels on the top mic in both the 800-Hz to 1-kHz range and the 8- to 10-kHz
range. Allow the bottom mic to create the crispness. I generally use a shelf
EQ to roll off the bottom end of the bottom mic below, say, 250 to 300 Hz.
Depending on the music (R&B and pop, for instance), I might use a shelf EQ
to add a little sizzle to the bottom mic by boosting frequencies above 10 kHz.
For many recording engineers and producers, the snare drum sound is almost
a signature. If you listen to different artists’ songs from the same producer,
you’ll likely hear similarities in the songs’ snare drum sound. Don’t be afraid
to take your time getting the snare drum to sound just right. After all, if you
become a famous producer, you’ll want people to recognize your distinct
snare drum sound. And you want it to sound good anyway.
Tom-toms
Tom-toms come in a large range of sizes and pitches. For mounted toms, you
can boost a little around 200 to 250 Hz to add depth to the drum. A boost in
the 3- to 5-kHz range can add more of the sticks’ attack, and for some addi-
tional presence, try adding a little in the 5- to 8-kHz range. If the drums sound
too boxy, try cutting a little in the 600-Hz to 1-kHz range.
For floor toms, you can try boosting the frequency range 40 to 125 Hz if you
want to add some richness and fullness. You might also find that cutting in
the 400- to 800-Hz range can get rid of any boxy sound that the drum might
have. To add more attack, boost the 2.5- to 5-kHz range.
Hi-hats
Most of the time, the hi-hats are pretty well represented in the rest of the
mics in the drum set, but depending on which mics are picking up the hi-hats,
you can use the mics to bring out their sheen or brightness. To do this, try
320
Part V: Playing with Plug-Ins 

boosting the frequencies above 10 kHz with a shelf EQ. You might also find
that cutting frequencies below 200 Hz eliminates any rumble created by other
drums that the hi-hat mic picked up.
Cymbals
With the cymbals, I usually cut anything below 150 to 200 Hz with a shelf EQ
to get rid of any rumbling that these mics pick-up. I also drop a few decibels
at 1 to 2 kHz if the cymbals sound kind of trashy or clanky. Adding a shelf EQ
above 10 kHz can add a nice sheen to the mix.
Overhead mics
If you used overhead mics to pick up both the drums and the cymbals, be
careful about cutting too much from the lower frequencies — doing so just
sucks the life right out of your drums. Also, if the drums coming through the
overhead mics sound boxy or muddy, work with the 100- to 200-Hz frequen-
cies for the muddiness and 400-Hz to 1-kHz frequencies for the boxiness.
Percussion
High-pitched percussion instruments (shakers, for example) sound good when
the higher frequencies are boosted a little bit, over 10 kHz for instance. This
adds some brightness and softness to their sound. You can also roll off many of
the lower frequencies, below 500 Hz, to eliminate any boxiness that might be
present from miking too closely. (See Chapter 9 for more on mic placement.)
Lower-pitched percussion instruments, such as maracas, can also have the
lower frequencies cut a little — use 250 Hz and lower. Try boosting frequen-
cies between 2.5 and 5 kHz to add more of the instrument’s attack. To brighten
them up, add a little bit in the 8- to 10-kHz range.
Piano
For pianos, you often want to make sure that the instrument has both a nice
attack and a warm-bodied tone. You can add attack in the 2.5- to 5-kHz range,
and warmth can be added in the 80- to 150-Hz range. If your piano sounds
boomy or muddy, try cutting a little between 200 and 400 Hz.

 Getting to know reverb
 Introducing delays
 Examining offline effects processing
U
nless you record your songs using a live band in a perfect acoustic
environment, your music is going to sound a little flat without the addi-
tion of some type of effects. Effects allow you to make your music sound like
you recorded it in just about any environment possible. You can make your
drums sound as if they were recorded in a cathedral or your vocals sound
as if you were singing underwater. Effects also have the ability to make you
sound better than the real you. For example, you can add harmony parts
to your lead or backup vocals, or you can make your guitar sound like you
played it through any number of great amplifiers.
In this chapter, you discover many of the most common effects processors
used in recording studios. (Signal processors are the neat software plug-ins
behind all the effects you can achieve in your computer-based studio.) You
discern the difference between Insert (that is, line) effects and Send/Return
effects. You also get a chance to explore ways of using these processors, and
I make recommendations for using reverb, delay, and chorus. To top it off,
you get a glimpse into offline effects processing, such as pitch-shifting.
The best way to find out how to use effects on your music is to experiment.
The more you play around with the different settings, the more familiar you
become with how each effect operates. Then you can get creative and come
up with the best ways to use effects for your music.
The Bypass button in your effects-processor Plug-In window is your friend.
With a click of the Bypass button, you can quickly turn off any effect in use
with your signal. Use this button to check your effect settings against your
original signal. Sometimes you’ll like the original sound better.

Routing Your Effects
Effects processors can be used as either Send effects, where you send part of
your track’s signal through the effect, or Insert effects, where you affect the
entire signal from your track. In both cases, you can work with the dry (unaf-
fected) signal and the wet (affected) signals separately. If you use the effect in
a Send/Return routing, you can adjust the wet and dry signals with two track
faders: Aux Send (opened by clicking the effect’s name in the Send list), and
Auxiliary. If you use the effect in a line configuration, the Plug-In window dis-
plays a Mix parameter where you can adjust the wet/dry balance.
You choose whether to insert an effect in a track or to use the Send function
based on what you intend to do. For example, if you insert the effect into a
track as I describe in the next section, that effect alters only the signal that
exists on the track it’s inserted into. On the other hand, using an effect send
for your effect allows you to route more than one track through that effect.
(You can adjust the individual levels going to the Send at each track so you
still have control over how much effect is applied to each track going to the
Send.) In addition, inserting an effect always puts the effect before the fader
in the track (pre-fader); if you use a Send, you can choose whether the effect
does its magic before (pre-fader) or after (post-fader) the signal enters the
fader that controls the track’s output. If you use a Send to apply the effect
to more than one track at a time, you also reduce the amount of processing
power the effect has to use. (Inserting the same effect into each track you
want to alter ends up using more processing power.)
Inserting effects
If you want to use an effect on only one specific track, you can insert it into
the track by using the Insert function. The procedure for inserting plug-ins
into a track is common among many, if not all, audio recording programs.
Here are the basic steps for Pro Tools and Logic:
1. Make sure that the Inserts section is showing in the Mixer window.
In Pro Tools, you do this by choosing Display➪Mix Window Shows➪
Inserts. In Logic, choose Windows➪Show Environment.
2. Click the top arrow on the left side of the Inserts section of the track’s
channel strip.
The Insert pop-up menu appears, as shown in Figure 17-1. Pro Tools is
on the left, and Logic is on the right.
324
Part V: Playing with Plug-Ins 

3. Choose your desired plug-in — D-Verb, Platinum Verb, Long Delay,
whatever — from the menu.
The Plug-In window opens, as shown in Figure 17-2. Here you can set
your parameters. (My professional advice on what settings to actually
tweak comes later in this chapter, when I cover the individual effects.)

Chapter 17: Using Effects Effectively

Sending signals to effects
Sometimes you want to route a bunch of tracks to a single effect (in the case
of reverbs, for instance). This involves using the Send in your track’s channel
strip and routing it to an auxiliary bus. The process for doing this is pretty
similar in most programs; here’s how you do it in Pro Tools:
1. Select one of the buses from the Send selector in the upper section of
each track’s channel strip that you want to route to the effect.
The Send Output window appears, as shown in Figure 17-3. The window
contains a handy channel strip for controlling the signal being sent to
the selected bus.
2. Choose File➪New Track.
The New Track dialog box appears.
3. Use the drop-down lists to enter the number of tracks you want (1),
the type (Auxiliary Input), and whether you want your track in mono
or stereo.
4. Using the Input selector pop-up menu, select the bus (the pathway
used for Send effects) you used for the Send of the tracks in Step 1 as
the input for this auxiliary track.

5. Select one of the effects plug-ins from the Inserts pop-up menu and
insert it into this auxiliary track.
The Effect Plug-In window opens.
6. Adjust the effect settings to get the sound you want.
Pro Tools makes it pretty easy to route a bunch of tracks to a single effect;
Logic takes a slightly different approach, but it’s just as easy:
1. Select one of the buses from the Send selector in the upper section of
each track’s channel strip that you want to route to the effect.
When you release your mouse after selecting the bus, the bus is listed,
and a trim pot (knob) appears next to the bus number in the track’s
channel strip, as shown in Figure 17-4.
2. Adjust the trim pot to a moderate level.
I usually start with about –15dB.
3. Double-click the bus number.
This takes you to the Bus channel strip in the Environment window,
where you can choose the effect to insert into the bus.
4. Using the Input selector pop-up menu, select the effects plug-in you
want to use from the Inserts pop-up menu.
The Effect Plug-In window opens.
5. Adjust the effect settings to get the sound you want.

Chapter 17: Using Effects Effectively

The “Inserting effects” section, earlier in this chapter, gives you the gory
details on inserting effects.
Chapter 16 further details plug-ins and how to route signals through your
system to them.
Rolling Out the Reverb
Reverb is undoubtedly the most commonly used effects processor. Reverb,
short for reverberation, is the natural reflection of sound, which occurs in
any enclosed room and is the result of sound waves bouncing off the walls,
floor, and ceiling. A small room produces reflections that start quickly and
end soon; in larger rooms, halls, or cathedrals, the sound has farther to
travel, so you get slower start times and a longer-lasting reverberation.
This room effect enables you to place your track closer to the imaginary “front”
or “back” of the mix. You do this by varying how much of the affected signal
you include with the unaffected one. For example, mixing a lot of reverb with
the dry (unaffected) signal gives the impression of being farther away, so your
instrument sounds like it’s farther back in the mix.
You have a ton of reverb choices in the computer-based recording world.
Every recording program comes with at least one, but to be honest, most of
them don’t sound very natural. This doesn’t mean they aren’t useful, but
don’t expect them to sound the same as a good room or an external reverb
unit. That said, some reverbs do sound pretty darn good to my ears. But
don’t take my word for it — read the next two sections to bone up a bit on
reverbs and then give the ones I recommend a shot.
Seeing reverb settings
Every reverb plug-in offers different parameters that you can adjust. As much
as I’d like to, I can’t possibly run down a comprehensive list of all the parame-
ters you’ll encounter. Instead, I’ve chosen a basic, fairly full-function, popular
reverb plug-in from Pro Tools. As you can see in Figure 17-5, a full-function
plug-in gives you quite a bit of flexibility.
328
Part V: Playing with Plug-Ins 

The following list explains how the parameters — most, but not all, visible in
Figure 17-5 — affect the sound of the reverb:
 Algorithm: This setting lets you choose the type of room that the reverb
sounds like. You have the option of a hall, church, plate (a type of reverb
that uses a metal plate to create its sound), two different rooms, ambient
(natural room sound), and non-linear (less natural) sound. Each choice
also sets the other parameters for the reverb, but you can adjust those as
you like to give your reverb a distinct sound.
 Size: This option refers to the room choices you have in the Algorithm
setting. You have three setting to choose from: Small, Medium, and
Large. Clicking one of these buttons adjusts the rest of parameters in
the window, except for the Algorithm setting.
 Diffusion: Diffusion affects the density of the reflections in the room
you’ve chosen. A higher diffusion setting results in a thicker sound.
Think of the diffusion parameter as a way to simulate how reflective the
room is. More reflective rooms produce a much higher diffusion. To sim-
ulate a less reflective room, use lower diffusion settings.
 Decay: The decay is the length of time that the reverb lasts. Larger or
more reflective rooms produce a longer decay.
 Predelay: A sound reaches your ears before the sound’s reverb does,
and the predelay is the amount of time from the sound’s beginning and
the start of the reverb, which is described in milliseconds (ms). Because
reverb is made up of reflections of sound within a room, the sound takes
time to bounce around the room and reach your ears. By then, you’ve
already heard the sound because it came directly to you. Predelay helps
to define the initial sound signal by separating it from the reverb. This
parameter is essential in making your reverb sound natural.
A small room has a shorter predelay than a large room.

Chapter 17: Using Effects Effectively

 HF Cut: This setting allows you to control the rate at which the high fre-
quencies decay. Most of the time the high frequencies decay faster, so
being able to control this effect can result in a more natural-sounding
reverb.
 Low Pass: This filter controls the level of the high frequencies within the
reverb. Setting this frequency gives the impression of a darker (lower-
frequency setting) or brighter (higher-frequency setting) room.
Getting started using reverb
Reverb is like garlic: The more you use, the less you can taste it. Just as the
new chef puts garlic in everything (and lots of it), many budding engineers
make the same mistake with reverb. Go easy. Remember: Less is more.
Here are some other useful tips to keep in mind:
 Mixes often sound better when you use reverb on only a few instruments
instead of them all. For example, often just the snare drum of the drum
set to have reverb on it. The rest of the drums and cymbals remain dry
(unaffected).
 Try using reverb to glue instruments together. Routing all your drum
tracks to the same reverb, for instance, can make them sound like they
were all recorded in the same room. When gluing instruments together,
make sure that you adjust the Send level for each instrument so that the
effect sounds natural. Also, use less reverb for all the instruments than
you would for just one. This keeps the sound from becoming muddy
from using too much reverb.
 Think about how you want each instrument to sit in the mix when you
choose reverb. Make sure the type and amount of reverb fit the song and
the rest of the instruments.
 Try putting the dry (unaffected) sound on one side of the stereo field
and the reverb on the other. For example, if you have a rhythm guitar
part that you set at 30 degrees off to the right of the stereo field, set the
reverb 30 degrees off to the left. This can be a nice effect.
 To keep the vocals up front in the mix, use a short reverb setting. A vocal
plate is a great choice because the decay is fast. This adds a fair amount
of the reverb to the vocal without making it sit way back in the mix.
 Experiment with room types, sizes, and decay times. Sometimes a long
decay on a small room reverb sounds better than a short decay on a
large room or hall reverb.

Detailing Delay
Along with reverb, delay is a natural part of sound bouncing around a room.
When you speak (or sing or play) into a room, you often hear not only reverb,
but also a distinct echo caused by the return of the original sound bouncing
off the walls of the room to your ears. This echo might be short or long
depending on the size of the room. The original sound might bounce back to
you as a single echo or as multiple, progressively quieter ones. These echoes
are created by a delay effect.
Digging into delay settings
Several types of delay effects exist, including a slap-back echo, tape delay, and
multiple delays, and each of them is designed to add dimension to your instru-
ment. To create these various effects, you adjust several parameters. The delay
plug-ins included with audio recording programs have a lot of similarities.
Figure 17-6 shows a delay plug-in that comes with Pro Tools so you can see
how this type of plug-in works. This plug-in offers the following parameters:
 Gain: This lets you set the signal level going into the delay.
 Mix: This parameter controls the output level of the effect. The higher
you set this parameter, the louder the delayed signal is relative to the
original signal.
 LPF: The low-pass filter (LPF) lets you filter out some of the high fre-
quencies from the delay.
 Delay: This parameter controls the amount of time between the initial
signal and the repeated sound. The time is listed in milliseconds (ms)
and can be as short as a few milliseconds or as long as several seconds.

Chapter 17: Using Effects Effectively

 Depth: This parameter lets you add modulation to the delay so that you
can create a chorus effect. (See the “Creating Chorus Effects” section,
later in this chapter, for more on chorus and flange effects.) The higher
the level on this setting, the greater the modulation.
 Rate: This setting lets you adjust the amount of time that the modulation
takes to go once through its cycle.
 Feedback: The Feedback parameter controls how many times the echo
repeats. A low setting makes the echo happen just once, and higher set-
tings produce more echoes.
Some delay plug-ins also offer the ability to set the delay to the tempo of your
song. The following list covers these settings:
 Tempo Match: This option allows you to set the delay to beat in time
with the music. The Tempo Match feature is referenced to the tempo
map that you set for the song. You can set this parameter to any note
division, from 16th notes to whole notes, if you want the delays to keep
time with your song. (Quarter- and eighth-note delays are the most com-
monly used note divisions.)
Set that tempo map before you start to record. If you didn’t bother to set
a tempo map — metronome settings for each section of the song — this
feature will be relatively useless to you because it won’t have a reference
point from which to draw. (For tips on creating and using tempo maps,
see Chapter 10.)
 Meter: This lets you set the meter of the song and the subdivision of the
measure, such as quarter note or eighth note, that you want the delay
to follow. When you change this parameter, the Delay parameter moves,
too.
 Groove: Use this parameter to adjust the rate of the delay in relation to
the tempo and subdivision you chose. By changing this setting, you alter
the delay (by percentages) away from the strict tempo and subdivision
settings. This can be useful if you’re adjusting the exact delay that you
want. When you adjust this parameter, the Delay setting changes as well.
Getting started using delay
Many mix engineers and producers use delay frequently in contemporary
music, and many times you don’t hear it unless you listen carefully. Other
times it’s prominent in the mix (for example, the snare drum in some reggae
music). Here are ways you can use delay in your music:
332
Part V: Playing with Plug-Ins 

 One of the most effective ways to use delay is as a slap-back echo on
vocals. A slap-back echo consists of one to three echoes spaced very
closely together, which fattens up the sound of the vocals. You generally
want to set your time parameter between 90 and 120 milliseconds. Set
the level so you barely hear the first echo when your vocal is in the mix
and adjust it from there until you like the sound. In pop music, a slap-
back echo and a vocal plate reverb are commonly used on lead vocals.
(It was really common in the 1950s, and shows up a lot — less subtly —
in rockabilly.) A good place to start is a slap delay (Pro Tools) or a tape
delay (Logic).
 Use the Tempo Match feature to have your delay echo in time with the
music. This can add some depth to the mix without creating a muddy or
cluttered sound. Be careful — if you use this too much, it can make your
music sound annoyingly repetitive.
Creating Chorus Effects
The chorus effect takes the original sound and creates a copy that is very
slightly out of tune with the original and which varies over time. This variance
is called modulation, and the result is an effect that can add interest and vari-
ety to an instrument. Many recordists use chorus quite extensively to add full-
ness to an instrument, particularly guitars and vocals. Some programs (Pro
Tools, for example) don’t come with a chorus plug-in, but other programs
(Logic) have several modulation effects to choose from.
If reverb is like garlic, chorus is cayenne pepper. You might get away with a
little too much garlic in your food without too much trouble, but if you add
too much cayenne, you run the risk of making your food inedible. Such is the
case with the chorus effect. Used sparingly, it can add a lot to your music;
overdone, it can wreak havoc on a good song. Keep the following tips in mind:
 To fill out a vocal track, try setting the rate at 2 Hz, the depth with a
value of about 20 to 30, and the delay at 10 to 20 ms. Keep the Feedback
level low.
 Use a chorus on backup vocals to make them much fuller and allow you
to use fewer tracks.
 Pan the chorus to one side of the mix and the dry (unaffected) signal to
the other. This can be especially interesting on guitars and synthesizer
patches.

In This Chapter

 Introducing gates and expanders
 Examining side-chain processing
D
ynamics processors allow you to control the dynamic range of a signal.
The dynamic range is the difference between the softest and loudest sig-
nals that a sound source produces. The dynamic range is listed in decibels
(dB). The larger the dynamic range, the more variation exists between the
softest and loudest notes.
The four types of dynamics processors are compressors, limiters, gates, and
expanders. This chapter gives you the lowdown on the different types and
how they can help you do several important adjustments to your music. You
can add punch, smooth out an instrument’s sound, even out an erratic per-
formance, eliminate noise from a track, and more.
Dynamics processors can be tricky to use. With just a minor change in set-
tings, you can go from no noticeable change in the source sound to supreme
ugliness in your track. The worst part is that you might not even notice it as
you tweak the settings. The best way to ensure that you don’t mess up your
mix with these processors is to make it a practice to switch the effect on and
off as you work by using the Bypass button in the Plug-In window. This lets
you check your effect settings against your original signal, reducing the possi-
bility that you’ll use too much processing. Don’t be afraid to skip the proces-
sor and go with the original sound if you don’t get it to sound better.
Connecting Dynamics Processors
Dynamics processors are Insert effects. This means you insert them into a
track so they become part of it, affecting the track’s entire signal. In most
computer-based recording programs, applying a dynamics processor usually

involves choosing the plug-in in the Insert section of your track’s Channel
strip. Here’s how you do it in Pro Tools and Logic:
1. In Pro Tools, choose Display➪Mix Window Shows➪Inserts to make
sure that the Inserts section is showing in the Mix window; In Logic,
choose Windows➪Environment to show the Mixer window.
2. Click the top arrow on the left side of the Inserts section of the track’s
channel strip (Pro Tools) or click and hold over the insert in the track’s
channel strip (Logic).
The Insert pop-up menu opens, as shown in Figure 18-1.
3. In Pro Tools, select the Multi-Channel Plug-In if your track is a stereo
track; select the Multi-Mono Plug-In option if your track is a mono
track. In Logic, choose Mono➪Logic➪Dynamic for a mono track or
choose Stereo➪Logic➪Dynamic for a stereo track.
4. In Pro Tools, select the Compressor, Limiter, Expander-Gate, or Gate
option. In Logic, choose one of several dynamic processors in the
drop-down list.
The chosen plug-in window opens, and you’re now ready to create your
settings. The rest of this chapter explains how and when to use the dif-
ferent processors. For example, you’d use a compressor to even out an
erratic performance. (Later in this chapter, you can see the Compressor,
Limiter, Expander-Gate, and Gate windows in Pro Tools in Figures 18-2,
18-3, 18-4, and 18-5, respectively.)

Part V: Playing with Plug-Ins 

Introducing Compressors
The compressor’s job is to compress (go figure) the dynamic range of the
sound being affected. The compressor not only limits how loud a note can be
but also reduces the difference between the loudest and softest note — which
is pretty much what I mean when I say something compresses the dynamic
range.
You use compressors for three main purposes (although other purposes cer-
tainly exist as well):
 They keep transients — the initial attack of an instrument — from creat-
ing digital distortion during tracking. This is common with drums that
have a very fast attack (initial signal), which can easily overload the
recorder (or converters or preamps).
 They even out any performance that shows signs of a high degree of
unwanted dynamic variation. An example of unwanted dynamic varia-
tion is a singer who might have great energy but poor mic control — for
example, jumping and dancing around in front of the mic. As a result of
all that movement, some recorded passages are too loud, and others
are too quiet. This type of compression is usually performed during the
tracking (see Chapter 10) or mixing (see Chapter 14) stage.
 They raise the overall apparent level of the music during mastering. For
example, compressing your mixed song just a couple of decibels brings
up the quieter parts of music and makes your entire song louder.
I cover Purpose 1 in Chapter 9, and you can find Purpose 3 in Chapter 14. So
that leaves Purpose 2 to explore (with sample settings) later in this section.
Getting to know compressor parameters
You can find hundreds of different compressor plug-ins for your computer-
based system, and many of those plug-ins have unique controls. Because I
can’t explain all of them in this section (it would take an entire book to do
that), I highlight a very common compressor setup from a very common
audio recording program: Pro Tools. You insert this plug-in into a track by fol-
lowing the procedures in the “Connecting Dynamics Processors” section at
the beginning of this chapter. This plug-in contains the following parameters
(listed top to bottom as they appear in Figure 18-2):
337
Chapter 18: Digging into Dynamics Processors

 Gain: The Gain slider allows you to adjust the level (volume) of the signal
going out of the compressor. This is listed in decibels (dB). Because
adding compression generally reduces the overall level of the sound, you
use this control to raise the level back up to where it was when it went in.
 Threshold: The Threshold setting dictates the decibel level at which the
compressor starts to act on the signal. This setting is often listed as
decibel below peak (0dB). In other words, a setting of –6dB means that
the compressor starts to act when the signal is 6dB below its calibrated
0dB mark. (In digital systems, 0dB is the highest level a signal can go
before clipping.)
 Ratio: The Ratio setting shows how much the compressor affects the
signal. For instance, a ratio of 2:1 means that every decibel that your
signal goes over the threshold setting the level of this signal is reduced
by two decibels. So if a signal goes 1dB over the threshold setting, its
output from the compressor will be only 0.5dB louder. With ratios above
10:1, your compressor starts to act like a limiter. (See the later section
“Looking into Limiters.”)
 Attack: The Attack slider controls how soon the compressor kicks in.
The attack is defined in milliseconds (ms); the lower the number, the
faster the attack.
 Release: The Release slider controls how long the compressor continues
affecting the signal after it drops back below the Threshold setting. Like
the attack, the release is defined in milliseconds. The lower the number,
the faster the release time.
 Knee: The Knee slider controls how the compressor behaves as the
input signal passes the threshold. The lower the Knee setting, the more
gradually the compressor acts as the signal passes the threshold.

Part V: Playing with Plug-Ins 

Getting started using compression
Regardless of the type of compressor or audio recording program you use,
I can tell you that this particular processor is one of the most useful — and
one of the most abused — pieces of gear in the recording studio. The most
difficult part of using compression is that every instrument reacts differently
to the same settings. In this section, I offer you some guidelines and ideas for
using the compressor effectively.
The following steps show you one good way to get familiar with the 
compressor:
1. Start with a high Ratio setting (between 8:1 and 10:1) and move the
Threshold slider all the way to the right.
2. While playing your track, slowly move the Threshold slider back to
the left; watch the meters and listen carefully.
As you reduce the threshold, notice where the meters are when you start
hearing a change in the sound of the track. Also notice what happens to
the sound when you have the threshold really low and the meters are
peaked. (The sound is very different from where you started.)
3. Slowly move the Threshold slider back to the right and notice how the
sound changes back again.
After you get used to how the sound changes as you adjust the Threshold
setting, try using different Attack and Release settings and do this procedure
again. The more you experiment and critically listen to the changes made by
the different compressor settings, the better you’ll understand how to get the
sound that you want. The following guidelines can also help you achieve your
desired sound:
 Try to avoid using any compression on your 2-track mix while you mix
your music. Compression is a job for the mastering phase of your project.
If you compress your stereo tracks during mixdown, you limit what you
can do to your music in the mastering stage. This is true even if you
master it yourself and think you know what you want during mixdown.
 If you hear noise when you use your compressor, you’ve set it too high.
What’s happening is you’re compressing the loud portions enough to
make the level of the softest sections of the music (including any noise)
much louder in comparison. To get rid of the noise, decrease the Ratio or
the Threshold settings.
 To increase the punch of a track, make sure that the Attack setting
isn’t too quick. Otherwise, you lose the initial transient and the punch
of a track.
339
Chapter 18: Digging into Dynamics Processors

 To smooth out a track, use a short Attack setting and a quick Release
time. This evens out the difference in level between the initial transient
and the body of the instrument. The result is a smoother sound.
Less is more when using compression. Resist the temptation to move those
sliders too much to the right — it just squashes your music. On the other
hand, if that’s an effect that you’re going for, don’t be afraid to experiment.
Looking into Limiters
The limiter works much like the compressor except that it limits the highest
level of a sound source. Any signal above the threshold is chopped off rather
than compressed. Limiters are great for raising the overall level of an instru-
ment and keeping transients from eating up all the headroom (maximum
level) of a track.
Understanding limiter settings
As is the case with compressor plug-ins, limiters come in many varieties. Still,
many of them use a few common controls. In this section, I detail the limiter
that comes standard with Pro Tools (shown in Figure 18-3). Again, you insert
this plug-in into a track by following the procedures in the “Connecting
Dynamics Processors” section at the beginning of this chapter. The limiter
contains the following parameters:
Figure 18-3:

340
Part V: Playing with Plug-Ins 

 Gain: The Gain slider allows you to adjust the level (volume) of the signal
going out of the limiter. The level is listed in decibels.
 Threshold: The Threshold setting dictates the level at which the limiter
starts to act on the signal. This is listed in decibels (dB). This setting is
often listed as decibels below peak (0dB). So a setting of –5dB means
that the limiter kicks in when the signal is 5dB below its calibrated 0dB
mark. (In digital systems, 0dB is the highest level a signal can go before
clipping.)
 Attack: The Attack slider controls how soon the limiter kicks in. The
attack is defined in milliseconds (ms); the lower the number, the faster
the attack.
 Release: The Release slider controls how long the limiter continues lim-
iting the signal after it drops back below the Threshold setting. The
release is defined in milliseconds. The lower the number, the faster the
release time.
Setting limits with the limiter
The limiter is essentially a compressor on steroids, so many of the settings
that you can use for a compressor work for limiters. The only difference is
that you don’t have the Ratio and Knee settings. Keep in mind these two tips
when using limiters on your tracks:
 When using limiters to raise the volume of a track or mix, limit only 2 or
3dB at a time. This way, the limiter doesn’t alter the sound of your signal;
it just reduces the highest peaks and raises the volume.
 To add grunge to a track, lower the Threshold setting so that you limit
the signal 6 to 12dB. Tweak the Attack and Release parameters to get the
sound you’re after. This creates distortion that might work for a particu-
lar track such as the snare drum.
Introducing Gates
A gate is basically the opposite of the limiter: Rather than limiting how loud a
note can get, the gate limits how soft a note can get. The gate filters out any
sound below the threshold and allows any note above it to be passed through
unaffected.
Gates are useful for filtering out any unwanted noise that might be present in
the recording environment. A classic situation for using gates is when you
341
Chapter 18: Digging into Dynamics Processors

record drums. You can set the gate to filter any sound (other drums, for
instance) except for the sounds resulting from the hits to the particular drum
that you have miked.
Getting to know gate parameters
Almost all gates use the same basic controls. Figure 18-4 shows the gate plug-
in that you get when you buy Pro Tools. As you can see, the various settings
that you get to play with are similar to the ones for compressors and limiters.
Insert a gate into a track by following the procedures in the “Connecting
Dynamics Processors” section at the beginning of this chapter and then play
around with the following parameters:
 Threshold: The Threshold slider sets the level (in decibels) at which the
gate opens (stops filtering the signal). The gate allows all signals above
the Threshold setting to pass through unaffected, whereas any signals
below the Threshold setting are reduced by the amount set by the Range
control.
 Attack: Like with the compressor and limiter, the Attack slider sets the
rate at which the gate opens (in milliseconds). Fast attacks work well for
instruments with, well, fast attacks, such as drums, whereas slow attacks
are better suited for instruments with slow attacks, like vocals.
For the most part, try to match the speed of the gate’s Attack setting
with the attack speed of the instrument that you’re gating. If you don’t
do this well, you might hear a click when the signal crosses the gate’s
threshold. This generally happens because the attack is set too slow for
the instrument. Adjust the attack until this click goes away.
 Hold: The Hold setting controls the amount of time that the gate stays
open after the signal drops below the threshold. When the hold time is
reached, the gate closes abruptly. This parameter is listed in milliseconds
Figure 18-4:
The gate
plug-in lets
you filter out
noise below
a certain
level.
342
Part V: Playing with Plug-Ins 

(ms). The Hold parameter allows you to get the gated drum sound that
was so popular in the 1980s. (Phil Collins, anyone?)
 Decay: The Decay setting dictates the rate at which the gate closes after
the signal hits the threshold (listed in milliseconds). Unlike the Hold fea-
ture, the Decay setting doesn’t close abruptly; rather, it slowly (accord-
ing to the Decay setting) closes, which produces a more natural sound.
You want to try to set the release time so that it matches the natural
decay time of the instrument. Otherwise you can get a clipped-off sound.
(If you want the clipped-off sound, use the Hold feature.)
 Range: The Range setting is similar to the Ratio setting on the compres-
sor except that you choose the decibels amount by which the gate atten-
uates (reduces) the signal. For example, a setting of 40dB drops any
signal below the Threshold setting by 40dB.
Getting started using gates
Noise gates can be extremely useful for getting rid of unwanted noise. The
most common use for a gate is to eliminate bleeding from drum mics. For
example, you might get bleed from your snare drum into your tom-toms mics.
When using noise gates, keep the following in mind:
 When the threshold is reached, the gate allows the signal through. If your
background noise level is high enough, when the gate opens you still hear
not only the intended sound but the background noise as well. This can
be a problem if you’re using gates to eliminate the noise of your hard drive
fan or other room noise. Your best bet is to use acoustic panels (rather
than gates) to eliminate the noise.
 When gating drums, be sure to set the attack very fast. Otherwise, the
initial transient is lost, and you end up with mushy-sounding drums.
 When setting the release time of the gate, adjust it until it sounds natural
and doesn’t clip off the end of your instrument’s sound.
 Set the range just high enough to mask any unwanted noise. If you set it
too high, the sound becomes unnatural because the natural resonance
of the instrument is filtered out.
Examining the Expander
The expander is the gate’s diminutive cousin — instead of reducing the volume
of notes below the set threshold by a specified amount, the expander reduces
them by a ratio. In other words, with the gate, you set a certain decibel amount
by which a signal is reduced, and with the expander, you reduce the signal by
setting a ratio. The ratio changes the signal gradually, making the affected sig-
nals sound more natural.
343
Chapter 18: Digging into Dynamics Processors

You use an expander when you want to subtly reduce noise from a track rather
than just filtering it out completely. A classic example is when you deal with
breath from a singer. If you use a gate, you get an unnatural-sounding track
because the breaths are filtered out completely. With the expander, you can set
it to reduce the breath just enough so that it’s less noticeable, but you can
leave a little of the sound in to make the singer sound normal. (I mean, every-
one has to breathe, right?) This is such a common use of an expander that I
explain this process in detail in the “Getting started using an expander” section
later in this chapter.
Playing with expander parameters
Given that Expander plug-ins usually contain similar parameters, the Expander
plug-in shown in Figure 18-5 should give you a good sense of what such a plug-
in looks like. (If you guessed that this expander is part of the Pro Tools pack-
age, you guessed right.) You can see pretty much the same basic controls as
you find on the compressors, limiter, and gates. They are as follows:
 Threshold: The Threshold setting in an expander works the same way
as with the gate — anything below the threshold is affected, and any
signal above the threshold passes through unaffected.

Figure 18-5:

parameters
to set.
344
Part V: Playing with Plug-Ins 

 Ratio: The ratio dictates how much the signal is attenuated by the
expander. When using a ratio of 2:1, for instance, the expander reduces
any signal below the threshold by two times. In this case, a signal that is
10dB below the threshold is reduced to 20dB below it; likewise, a signal
that’s 2dB below the threshold is reduced to 4dB below it.
 Attack: As with the compressor and limiter, the Attack slider sets the rate
at which the expander opens (in milliseconds). Fast attacks work well for
instruments with fast attacks, such as an acoustic piano, whereas slow
attacks are better suited for instruments with slow attacks, such as a
bass guitar.
 Hold: The Hold setting controls the amount of time that the expander
stays open after the signal drops below the threshold. The hold time is
listed in milliseconds (ms).
 Decay: The Decay setting dictates the rate at which the expander closes
after the signal hits the threshold (listed in milliseconds). Unlike the
Hold feature, the Decay setting doesn’t close abruptly; rather it slowly
(according to the Decay setting) closes. This produces a more natural
sound. I recommend setting the release time so that it matches the nat-
ural decay time of your instrument.
 Range: The Range setting is similar to the Ratio setting on the compres-
sor except that you choose the decibel amount by which you want the
expander to be attenuate (reduce) the signal. For example, a setting of
30dB drops any signal below the threshold setting by 30dB.
You also have two settings that you can make if you use an external key to trig-
ger the expander. (I discuss external keys in the “Signing On to Side-Chains”
section at the end of this chapter.) These settings include
 Key HPF (High-Pass Filter): This setting allows you to choose the lowest
frequency that can affect the expander. Setting this parameter at 50 Hz,
for example, keeps any frequencies lower than that from triggering the
expander.
 Key LPF (Low-Pass Filter): This setting lets you determine the highest
frequency that can trigger the expander when you use a key input to
trigger the expander.
Getting started using an expander
Because the expander works much like a gate, you can use the same basic
starting points. Choose between a gate or an expander based on the type of
overall attenuation that you want of the signal. For example, the expander is
345
Chapter 18: Digging into Dynamics Processors

a good choice if you have an instrument that contains sounds that are too
loud but you don’t want to get rid of them completely — you just want to
reduce them a little.
Adjusting for a vocalist’s breath is the perfect situation for using an expander
rather than a gate. In this case, you can set the expander’s threshold just
below the singer’s softest note and start with a low ratio (1.5:1 or 2:1, for
instance). See whether the breathiness improves, and if it doesn’t, slowly
move the Ratio slider until you get the effect that you want. Be careful not to
overdo it, though. If the breath is too quiet compared to the vocal, the vocal
sounds unnatural.
If you use a high ratio in your expander (6:1 or above), the effect that you get
is similar in sound to the gate, but you end up having less control over the
sound because you don’t have the Hold or Release settings to adjust. So if
you find yourself using a high ratio on a signal, a gate might be a better
choice for that situation.
Signing On to Side-Chains
A side-chain is a mixing technique where you trigger your dynamics proces-
sor with another device such as an EQ. Using a side-chain means that the
signal from another track (through one of the buses) or from one of your
interface inputs triggers your dynamics processor into action. The signal that
you choose to do the triggering is called the key input in Pro Tools and a side-
chain in Logic.
Side-chains are great for de-essing (getting rid of “s” sounds) a vocal track,
making tracks fit together better in a dense mix, or letting a kick drum be
heard when it plays at the same time as the bass guitar. Not sure how to do
this? Don’t worry; I provide some examples later in this section.
Setting up a side-chain
Setting up a side-chain in an audio recording program involves some simple
steps. To illustrate, here’s how you do it in Pro Tools:
1. Using the Key Input pop-up menu (click the drop-down list located
next to the little Key icon at the top of the Plug-In window to get
there), choose the interface input or bus that has the signal that you
want to use to trigger the dynamics processor.
This step routes the signal from that input or bus to the processor.
346
Part V: Playing with Plug-Ins 

2. Click the External Key button to engage the side-chain.
The External Key button is located near the bottom-left corner of the
various plug-in windows. (Refer to Figure 18-5.)
3. Click the Key Listen button — located to the right of the External Key
button — to hear the signal coming through your selected key input.
The side-chain is now happily set up and minding its side-chain business.
4. Play your session and adjust the processor’s parameters until you get
the sound that you want.
A couple common side-chains
The uses for side-chains are numerous, and only your creativity limits how
you end up using your side-chain. In the following two step lists, I give just a
couple examples of using a side-chain.
The most common use for side-chains is to create more room for your instru-
ments in the mix. You do this by EQing (see Chapter 16) the Key Input signal
and letting that EQed signal trigger a compressor or limiter. To make room for
a vocal in a dense mix, follow these steps (when you use Pro Tools):
1. Route all your instruments in the mix (except the vocal) to Bus 15
and 16.
2. Insert the Compressor plug-in in this bus and set the Key Input to
Bus 14.
3. Make a copy of your vocal tracks and assign their outputs to Bus 14.
4. Shift the copied vocal tracks ahead (to the right) a few milliseconds.
For example, in Pro Tools, you do this by choosing the Slip edit mode
from the upper-left corner of the Edit window. Then you click and drag
the audio region in your track.
5. Adjust the settings on the compressor so that the volume of the instru-
ments drops slightly whenever the vocals come in.
You can also use a special trick to make the bass guitar drop slightly in the
mix whenever the kick drum is played. This helps you hear the kick drum
when the bass guitar and kick drum occupy the same basic frequencies.
Follow these steps:
1. Insert the compressor plug-in into the bass guitar track and set the
Key Input to Bus 16.
347
Chapter 18: Digging into Dynamics Processors

2. Make a copy of the kick drum track and set the output for the copied
track to Bus 16.
The kick drum signal will trigger the compressor that’s assigned to the
bass guitar track.
3. Use fast Attack and Release settings on the compressor.
You want the compressor to activate only when the initial strike of the
kick drum happens. The bass guitar drops in volume when the kick
drum plays. This means that the kick drum creates the attack, and the
bass guitar produces the sustain.
This trick works really well for music that has a kick drum and bass guitar
that play similar patterns.

Chapter 19
Ten Tips for Improving the
Performance of Your System
In This Chapter
 Speeding up your system
 Working effectively in your audio programs
C
omputer-based recording systems can be finicky. If you’re not diligent
about taking some basic precautions, your system will get sluggish and
eventually become unstable. This gradual slow-down doesn’t have to happen,
however. With some simple housekeeping tasks and system tweaks, you can
keep your computer running without a hitch. (Okay, so it actually runs with-
out as many hitches as you might otherwise encounter — how’s that for a
disclaimer?)
This chapter contains ten simple tasks that you can do to make and keep
your system running as smoothly as possible, regardless of the platform —
Mac or Windows — that you use.
Keep Your Drives Clean
Hard drives can get sluggish after you’ve recorded heaps of data on them,
erased some of it, edited still other parts, and recorded more. Over time, as
you write and rewrite, your system writes the new data on the drive ineffi-
ciently, and your system might slow down a bit, or you might experience
audio problems such as dropouts, clicks, or pops.
The best and easiest solution is to occasionally wipe your drives clean. You
can do this in several ways. Here’s one:
1. Back up all your files.
You should be doing this regularly anyway.

2. Reformat your audio drive.
Windows XP. Note: These steps assume that your hard drive file format
is set to FAT32. See your manual to find out how to check your hard
drive file format.
a. Open the Windows Recovery Console by using the Windows Setup
floppy disks or the Windows CD-ROM that came with Windows XP
to start your computer.
b. Press F10 or press R when the Welcome to Setup screen appears.
The Windows Recovery Console opens.
c. Type your Windows application number. (It’s usually 1.)
d. Enter your administrator password to log in to your computer.
(If you didn’t set up an administration account when you installed
Windows XP, your password is probably blank. Simply press Enter.)
e. Type map and press Enter.
f. Type format d and press Enter to reformat your D drive. This
assumes that your audio drive is your D drive. If it isn’t, enter the
letter for the drive in place of the d in the prompt for this step.
g. Type y and press Enter. This starts the formatting process. Go ahead
and read a novel for a few minutes while your system erases and
reformats your hard drive.
h. When the formatting is finished, type exit and press Enter. Your
computer restarts, and your drive is reformatted.
Mac OS X.
a. Open the Disk Utility application by choosing Macintosh HD➪
Applications➪Disk Utility from the Finder menu.
b. Click the Erase tab to open the Disk Erase window.
c. Choose your audio drive from the list by clicking it.
Be sure not to choose your system drive — that will erase your
operating system and all your application files.
d. In the Disk Erase window, choose Mac OS Extended (Journaled)
from the Volume Format drop-down menu.
e. Enter a name for your drive, such as Audio Files, in the Name
text box.
f. Click the Erase button to erase and format your drive. Because
this process takes a few minutes, I usually take this time to glance
through one of my favorite gear catalogs. (Of course this always
leads me to spend more money, so maybe this isn’t the best idea.)
3. Reload your files.
352
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

I suggest performing this procedure every month or so and definitely when-
ever you start hearing dropouts, pops, or clicks coming from your audio.
Keep Your Hard Drive Free of
Unnecessary Applications
Using your computer for tasks other than recording and adjusting audio can
clutter up your hard drives and slow down your system. This saps resources
that could go toward an extra plug-in or audio track. Some particularly sneaky
software programs, such as appointment calendars, run in the background
and drain power even when they’re not launched.
If you do use a computer with other programs on it, put all the data from the
other programs on a separate hard drive from your audio files and try to avoid
installing programs such as calendars, Internet programs (both browsers and
e-mail — getting a virus is as easy as clicking a Download button), or any pro-
gram that constantly runs in the background.
You basically have two solutions for this dilemma:
 Get a computer and use it only for audio.
 Get a super powerful computer and accept the hit you’ll take by having
these applications on your system.
Keep an Eye on Buffer Settings
Low buffer settings put a huge burden on your computer — especially if you
use a lot of plug-ins. Here’s what I recommend:
 When you record, use as few plug-ins as possible so that you can keep
your buffer settings as low as you can. Using a low buffer setting mini-
mizes your latency when tracking, making it easier to play along with
previously recorded tracks and have everything line up within your
single file.
 When you mix, raise the buffer setting so that your processor doesn’t
have to work as hard. Changing your buffer setting from 128 samples
(common for recording) to 512 or 1,024 samples when you mix might
even allow you to add a couple extra plug-ins when mixing.
353
Chapter 19: Ten Tips for Improving the Performance of Your System

Adjusting your buffer settings depending on your needs can make your record-
ing process go much smoother. I cover the steps for making buffer setting
adjustments in Chapter 8.
Use the Freeze Function
Some programs have a function that lets you render your effects to a track,
thus taking the load off your processor for that track. In Logic, this function
is called freeze. This freezes the effect settings in your designated track. With
this function, you can use as many plug-ins as you want without choking your
processor. To change the plug-in setting for a frozen track, you have to unfreeze
it first. This puts your track’s effects back on the processor’s workload, so after
you change the setting you need to refreeze the track.
If your program doesn’t have the freeze function or something similar (Pro
Tools version 6, for example, has no equivalent), you can approximate the
Freeze function by creating a submix of your track with the effects plugged in
and then using the submix in your mix. To change any effects setting, you have
to submix the raw track and effects again after you make your adjustments.
Keep Other Programs Turned Off
This almost goes without saying. Running other programs while you record is
asking for trouble. These programs use up RAM and bog down your proces-
sor. Running these programs while you work with audio increases the likeli-
hood that you’ll encounter some glitches. The most common glitches are:
 Program or system crashes: Your audio application or the other pro-
grams might freeze up. If anything freezes, your computer might try to
do an impression of road kill.
 Audio clicks, pops, or dropouts: Having your RAM used up by another
active program can cause access problems with your audio hard drive.
 Slow graphics: One of the first places you can see stress on your com-
puter is with the graphic redraw in your recording program. (The graphic
redraw is the refreshing of the visual images on your screen.) If the visu-
als start getting jerky, you need to be careful because other problems will
likely appear soon after this.
 Errors in accessing your audio or MIDI hardware: Aside from audio
problems such as pops, clicks, and dropouts, hardware errors are the
most common result of an over-stressed computer. These interruption
errors can cause the audio problems, but most often they abort record-
ing or playback.
354
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

The best way to avoid these problems is to keep other applications turned off
while you work with audio.
Exercise Some Discipline
A lot of the pop songs that you hear on the radio use over 100 tracks. And you
know what? They often don’t sound that good. Exercise some discipline and
keep your songs to a minimum on track counts. You don’t need 24 tracks of
backup vocals or 12 tracks of guitars, or 16 tracks of a 5-piece drum set. The
only reason to have this many tracks is that you’re unable to make a decision
on what to use in your mix. No way will 100 or more tracks of audio sound
good. There just isn’t enough auditory real estate available in the human hear-
ing spectrum. (Trust me on this; I research this stuff for my day job.)
If you have a clear vision of your music, you don’t need 100 tracks of material
to get your message across. Record and use only those tracks that you
absolutely need in order to make your song fit the sound you have in your
head. Chances are that you’ll be topping at 24 to 32 tracks for most songs.
Having fewer tracks stresses your system less and improves its performance.
Use Submixes
If you do have more tracks than your computer can play back without hiccup-
ping, your best bet is to submix groups into stereo tracks. For example, take
the four or five tracks (I hope you didn’t use more) that you used to record
your drums, add effects to each drum or group of drums, and then mix all this
down to two tracks. This can reduce your total track count, which in turn
reduces the work your computer has to do.
If you use lots of plug-ins in your music, your computer is even more likely to
start hiccupping. By submixing, you bounce your grouped tracks (including
the plug-ins for them) into a set of tracks that have no plug-ins. This takes
even more stress off your computer, leaving it relaxed enough to achieve a
state of audio Zen.
Clean Up Your Tracks
The problem: As you cut up your takes and assemble them together, your
computer plays your assembled data from the original files. This means that
it often reads from various parts of the hard drive at the same time (well, not
exactly the same time — it can’t multitask). This puts extra stress on your
355
Chapter 19: Ten Tips for Improving the Performance of Your System

hard drive and, if you have tracks with lots of chopped-up parts, it can slow
your system down or limit the number of tracks you can play back before
causing drop-outs, clicks, or pops.
The solution: Consolidate your parts into one continuous audio file after you
finish making your edits to the individual tracks. This way your hard drive
has all the data for your track in one place, making it easier to play back.
Turn Off Unused Tracks
Some programs, such as Pro Tools, use processing power in tracks even if no
data is playing. These programs also usually offer the option of being able to
turn off the tracks. In Pro Tools, this is called deactivating them. By deactivat-
ing your tracks, you might be able to free up some processing resources,
depending on your program.
Bypass Plug-Ins
Plug-ins use resources when they are inserted into a track even if no data is
flowing through them. Granted, they don’t use as much of the resources as
when data is going through them, but they do use some resources, nonethe-
less. When you mix, automate your plug-in bypass (simply click the Bypass
button to send your audio past the plug-in) for times when no signal is being
sent to it. This reduces the work your processor has to do and might allow
you to add another plug-in somewhere or include an extra audio or MIDI
track playing back during your mix.

Chapter 20
Ten Great Internet Recording
Resources
In This Chapter
 Finding online forums
 Getting to know gear reviews
 Discovering online educational resources
T
he Internet is a home recordist’s dream: It has tons of great information
and plenty of support to help you make the best music you can. The only
problem with the Internet is weeding through all the garbage (and there’s a
lot of garbage out there) to find the places that provide quality resources and
information.
In this chapter, I list ten (more, actually) of my favorite places to go on the
Internet for recording information and resources. These include forums, edu-
cational sites, and entertainment to inspire my creativity. These sites are just
a small sampling of what’s available on the Internet, but they can get you
started and give you some ideas for digging deeper.
Checking Out Online Chats
Being able to talk with other musicians and home recordists is one of the
biggest assets of the Internet. Tons of great online forums focus on music and
recording. Here are two of the most popular:
www.musicplayer.com/cgi-bin/ultimatebb.cgi
www.homerecording.com

Gearing Up for GAS
One thing that almost all home recordists (or any recordist for that matter)
can’t stop talking about is gear, and because of this, many develop a bad case
of GAS. Gear Acquisition Syndrome (GAS) is a prevalent problem, and the best
way to deal with it is to talk to other people who have it and to feed your need
to know about all the gear out there. Here are some Web sites that cater to (or
create) people with GAS:
www.gearslutz.com/board
www.musicplayer.com
www.harmony-central.com
Getting Help with Mastering
Mastering music is often misunderstood. I cover the basics of this process
in Chapter 14, but I don’t have enough space in this book to go into more
advanced details. Fortunately, a couple Web sites can help you make sense
out of this process and even find a good mastering engineer to help you with
your music.
For a great source of information from one of the legends of mastering, check
out Bob Katz’s Web site at:
www.digido.com
If you have specific questions and don’t know who to ask, mastering engineer
Brad Blackwood has a great forum dedicated to mastering at:
http://recforums.prosoundweb.com/index.php?t=thread&SQ=0&foru
m_redr=1&frm_id=31
Finding Support for Setting 
Up Your Studio
Some Web sites offer great pictures and designs of recording studios. For a
home recordist who doesn’t have a million dollars to spend setting up a
358
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

studio, most photos of commercial studios are depressing and not at all help-
ful. So, to counteract this and to offer you some inspiring ideas, here’s a great
Web site run by studio designer John Sayers:
http://johnlsayers.com
You can find photos of various studio construction projects as well as tons of
information about studio design and construction. The site even includes a
forum where you can post your questions.
You can also find some other forums for information about building a studio
on the Internet. One of the most informative is Ethan Winer’s forum. Here’s
the address:
www.musicplayer.com/ubb/ultimatebb.php?ubb=forum;f=26
Discovering CD Duplicating
If you want to get your music out to other people and even sell some copies
of your finished CD, your computer isn’t the best option for burning the
discs. Instead, you’re better off going to a company that can make them
“retail ready” (professional printing and graphics, shrink wrap, even a UPC
code so you can sell it in retail stores such as Amazon.com or your local
record store). The company does this in two ways:
 Duplication is copying your CD-R onto multiple CD-Rs. This approach is
great for runs under 500 (sometimes even under 300) because the initial
setup costs are lower than with replication.
 Replication involves making a special master CD (called a glass master)
of your CD-R and creating mass quantities of CDs from the glass master.
Replication is the best choice for amounts of 500 or more CDs. Thanks to
the replication process, you can produce CDs that look just like the major
or indie labels — with high-quality, direct-to-CD printing (no paper labels).
Most companies that create retail-ready CDs can offer either duplication or
replication, depending on the number of copies that you want (and can
afford). Here are some Web sites with info on this process:
www.discmakers.com
www.groovehouse.com
www.oasisduplication.com

Finding Industry Connections
Indie musicians need connections. Whether you need to find other musicians
to work with, get feedback from professionals on your music, or discover
ideas for promoting yourself, several Web sites can help you further your
career. These include

Discovering Inspiring Indie Music
Most creative people need inspiration from which to draw. I find that listen-
ing to as much music as possible inspires me to try new tricks and improve
my old ones. As far as I’m concerned, the major record labels by and large
put out less-than-inspiring music. So I seek out independent musicians and
small labels to feed my muse. Here are some places to start looking:

Ten (Or So) Free or Really Cheap
Software Programs
In This Chapter
 Getting your hands on low-cost recording software
 Finding free plug-ins
 Introducing inexpensive MIDI programs
 Discovering free MP3 software
B
ecause you’re recording into a computer, you need software to do any
work. This can get expensive, especially if you want to use lots of plug-
ins or make your music available in a variety of formats, such as CD or MP3.
This chapter lists several software titles that you can use for free or for just a
few bucks. Some of these programs don’t have the features that a more costly
program has, but many offer enough power to do the basics until you can
afford to buy something else. Also, you can find tons of shareware plug-ins
floating around that sound pretty good even compared to the ones you have
to pay for. This chapter puts them at your fingertips.
Creating high-quality software takes a lot of time and energy, and the
people who go through all this effort need to be compensated for their
work. Although you might find cracked (pirated/illegally copied) copies of
almost all programs that you can download, I implore you not to do this: It’s
illegal, but worse, it devalues intellectual property (including your music). If
people don’t get paid for their work, eventually you’ll see the good programs
disappear because the creators can’t keep giving it away for free. Another
reason to avoid cracked software is that it’s inherently buggy, and if you put
it on your computer, I almost guarantee you that your system will crash.
Please avoid cracked software — your computer will be happier, and your
conscience will be clean.

On the Web, freeware, shareware, and demo programs are as common as
flies. The best place I’ve found for many of these options is Shareware Music
Machine (www.hitsquad.com/smm). This Web site has an easy search func-
tion that can help you find the titles or applications you want. Much of the
software I link to in this chapter can be found on this site (among others).
Recording Programs
When you buy an audio interface — almost any interface — it comes with
some software. This is often your best free option because these programs
are often simplified versions of very powerful products. You can get to know
the approach that the designers used in all their products, and when you out-
grow it you can upgrade without having to figure out a new application. When
you look for an audio interface, I recommend that you consider the software
that is included as well as the cost to upgrade to the full version later.
That said, you can cheaply acquire some other recording software programs
to start you out. These include
 n-Track Studio: This is a really inexpensive program for audio and MIDI
recording. It’s for Windows computers only, but for a mere $75 you get
lots of features and an easy-to-use interface. You can download a demo
version for free from www.fasoft.com.
 Tracktion: This program is free with the Mackie USB audio interface but
can be purchased separately for $80. This program is really easy to use
and is available for both Windows and Mac computers. You can down-
load a free demo from www.mackie.com/products/tracktion.
 GarageBand: GarageBand is free with all new Apple computers. (You
can get it as part of iLife for $49 if you have an older Mac.) This program
is great for composing with loops. The only downside is that it doesn’t
work on Windows computers.
Audio Editing Programs
Many programs are designed with audio editing in mind. Depending on the
program that you use for day-to-day recording, you might find that having a
program specifically for your occasional tough edit can come in handy. Here
are some free versions:
362
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

 Audacity: This is a great audio editor that’s easy to use. It’s available for
both Windows and Mac computers. You can download it at http://
audacity.sourceforge.net.
 soundhack: This is a audio spectrum editor that you can use to create
some bizarre effects. This is freeware and for Mac only. It’s definitely
worth a look. It’s available here: www.soundhack.com/freeware.php.
MP3 Programs
If you want to put your music on the Internet, you need to be able to convert
it to MP3 format. Before you get your checkbook ready or pull out the plastic,
be aware that plenty of free programs can get the job done. These include:
 BladeEnc: This is a free encoder for Macs. You can download it here:
www.mp3machine.com/software/BladeEnc_mac.
 iTunes-LAME Encoder: This is a Mac program only and is free. You can
download it at www.mp3machine.com/software/iTunesLAMEEncoder.
 001 MP3 Encoder: This encoder is for Windows computers. It’s free and
really easy to use. You can find it at www.mp3machine.com/software/
001MP3Encoder.
 Power MP3 Cutter: This program encodes MP3s from WAV files like the
other programs, but it also allows you to cut sections from MP3 or WAV
files if you want to create short snippets. This program costs $20 and
is for Windows only. You can download it at www.mp3machine.com/
software/MP3Cutter.
When you have your MP3s, you might want to mix some together and create
something new. A great program for this is Acoustica MP3 Audio Mixer. This
program is a simple mixer for MP3s. It’s not free but it’s pretty cheap (it costs
$25). It’s for Windows only. Here’s where you can download a demo of it:
www.acoustica.com/mp3-audio-mixer/download.htm.
MP3 programs are bountiful on the Internet. You can find more at www.
mp3machine.com.
Plug-Ins
There’s an old saying in computer-based audio: You can never have too many
plug-ins. (Okay maybe it’s not that old, but I have to tell ya that even the
363
Chapter 21: Ten (Or So) Free or Really Cheap Software Programs

worst-sounding plug-in has its uses — for something.) Buying plug-ins can get
expensive, but as surprising as it might sound, some decent-sounding free
plug-ins are available. Here are a few that stand out:
 The fish fillets: These are dynamics processor plug-ins that rival the
ones you pay for. I find myself using these a lot. You can download them
at www.digitalfishphones.com/main.php?item=2&subItem=5.
 SimulAnalog Guitar Suite: This is an analog guitar amp simulator. It’s
available only for PC users, but it’s free and sounds good. You can get it
at www.simulanalog.org/guitarsuite.htm.
 RoomMachine 844 and RubyTube: These are free plug-ins from
Silverspike software. RoomMachine is a room simulator and reverb 
plug-in, and RubyTube is a tube preamp simulator. These are both really
good plug-ins, especially for the price. They’re available for both Mac
and Windows computers. You can download them at www.silverspike.
com/download.html.
Tons more good plug-ins are available, so check out Shareware Music Machine
for more options.
MIDI Programs
Recordists use MIDI a lot for music composition. MIDI can be handy if you
want to sketch out some ideas without buying a powerful computer or expen-
sive software. Most audio recording programs come with some sort of MIDI
implementation, but if yours doesn’t or if you want to be able to do some
nifty things such as convert a MIDI file into a WAV file without hassle, here are
some options:
 Audio Compositor: This program creates audio WAV files from your MIDI
files. (Remember, MIDI files don’t contain any sound — only performance
information.) This software is $40 and is for Windows only, but if you need
to convert your MIDI into WAV, this is great way to do it. You can down-
load it at www.sonicspot.com/audiocompositor/audiocompositor.
html.
 MID Converter 3.3: Here’s another program that converts MIDI files
to audio WAV files. You can download a free demo, which you can regis-
ter for unlimited use for $25. Here’s a link to download from: www.
mp3machine.com/software/MIDConverter.
364
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Software Synthesizers
Soft-synths are becoming about as commonplace as all the other types of plug-
ins used in recording. These make playing back MIDI data exciting because you
can create an almost unlimited variety of sounds. You can pay a lot for great
soft-synths, but the following are free ones to get you started:
 Delay Lama: This soft-synth is a riot. Its interface is a singing monk, and
it creates some really cool sound. It’s definitely worth checking out. It’s
for both Macs and Windows PCs. This program is free. You can down-
load it at www.audionerdz.com/index2.htm.
 Crystal: This is one of the most popular free soft-synths available. Mac
and Windows versions are both available, but it does use quite a bit of
power to run. Still, it sounds great. You can download it at www.green
oak.com/crystal/download.html.
