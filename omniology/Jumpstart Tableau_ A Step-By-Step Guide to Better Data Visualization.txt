 Introduction 
 Jumpstart Tableau aims to teach novices the basics of Tableau software so that they can quickly develop 
simple reports and visualizations. Tableau is a very powerful software with a very rich set of features and 
functionality. However, to get started, users need to learn only a few key functions, which are widely used 
in every type of business. This book aims to teach those basic functions through a series of exercises, which 
are based on step-by-step instructions. Learning these exercises will not make anyone an expert. However, 
they will provide enough knowledge and hands-on capability to novices so that they can quickly develop 
powerful and professional-looking visualizations. 
 Jumpstart Tableau contains 40 exercises. Of these, one explains the Tableau interface, while the others 
provide step-by-step instructions for performing various functions. Functions covered include swapping, 
sorting, drill down, grouping, hierarchies, aggregation, filtering, formatting, and trending. The exercises 
show how to delete, copy, and save workbooks, export the data/results to Excel or PDF, and display the 
detailed underlying data. They also demonstrate analysis functions, including Top N and forecasting. 
 Jumpstart Tableau also contains step-by-step exercises that demonstrate how to create a dashboard, 
incorporate quick filters in dashboards, and use layout formatting, as well as how to cascade worksheet 
changes in a dashboard. 
 The exercises in this book are based on two sample data files provided by Tableau Software. These files 
can be downloaded from    www.apress.com/9781484219331  .

 The  intermediate screen , which flashes and then disappears, is followed by the  Welcome screen 
displayed in Figure  1-3 . 
 Figure 1-2.  Intermediate screen 
 

CHAPTER 1 ■ LOG ON TO TABLEAU
3
 The left-hand pane is called the  Connect pane ; it lists the various data sources that you can connect to. 
These sources include relational databases, online data sources, text files, as well as Excel. An Excel sheet is 
considered a database table. It is possible to join one or multiple tables (or sheets) in Tableau. 
 The middle section of the window with the light background, under  Open , lists the workbooks that 
were used recently. A workbook in this area can be launched by just clicking it. The three items listed under 
 Sample Workbooks are provided by Tableau and show up by default. 
 The right section,  Discover , contains links for getting started in Tableau. 
 In our exercise, we will connect to an Excel spreadsheet:
• 
 Click  Excel , as shown in Figure  1-3 , which pops up the window displayed in Figure  1-4  
 Figure 1-3.  Tableau  Welcome window 
 

CHAPTER 1 ■ LOG ON TO TABLEAU

 The file that you want to connect to is at a lower level. Therefore, you need to drill down into the folder 
structure until the desired file is displayed. 
 Navigate to the desired spreadsheet as follows:
• 
 My Tableau Repository ➤  Datasources ➤  9.1 ➤  en_US-US 
 When the drilldown has completed, the display is as shown in Figure  1-5 . 
 Figure 1-4.  Datasource folder

 This spreadsheet has three sheets: Orders, People, and Returns. We can connect to one or more of the 
sheets or tables, such as Orders. 
 The Orders sheet can be opened for analysis using one of two methods:
• 
 Double-clicking the  Orders sheet 
• 
 Dragging and dropping  Orders  onto the canvas    
 To drag and drop:
• 
 Click the  Orders sheet, as shown in Figure  1-8 
 Figure 1-7.  Data Connection window 
 

CHAPTER 1 ■ LOG ON TO TABLEAU

• 
 Drag  Orders onto the blank canvas area, as shown in Figure  1-8 , which leads to the 
display shown in Figure  1-9 
 Figure 1-8.  Selecting the  dataset 
 Figure 1-9.  Data  imported from the Orders sheet 
 
 

CHAPTER 1 ■ LOG ON TO TABLEAU
9
 Figure  1-9 shows that the  Orders sheet of  the  Sample – Superstore data source (Excel spreadsheet) 
is connected to Tableau. The lower section of the display shows the data contained in the selected sheet 
(Orders). The first row contains the column headers. The table itself contains sales data for customers 
buying specific products. 
 The exercises in this book are primarily based on the Sample – Superstore spreadsheet, which is a 
subset of the  Global Superstore spreadsheet , which has also been used in some exercises. However, the 
Global Superstore has been used in most of the Tableau sample workbooks.

 CHAPTER 2  
 Connecting to Two Data Sources 
 Objective: This exercise demonstrates how to connect to two data sources 
 Figure  2-1 shows the  Tableau Welcome screen after it is launched. The left-hand pane, under  Connect , 
lists the various data sources to which Tableau can connect. These are split into three  groups of data sources: 
• 
 To a file 
• 
 To a server 
• 
 Saved data sources 
 For this exercise as well as subsequent exercises, we will only use the first option,  To a file , because the 
Excel data source we will use is available there. The second option can be used when we need to connect to 
external data sources, which primarily are databases. 
 Figure 2-1.  Tableau  Welcome  screen 
 

CHAPTER 2 ■ CONNECTING TO TWO DATA SOURCES
12
 To display more data sources:
• 
 Click  More Servers , as shown in Figure  2-1 , which leads to Figure  2-2 , where the 
additional data sources are listed 
 For this exercise, you need to connect to the  Sample – Superstore Excel spreadsheet data source:
• 
 Connect to the  Sample - Superstore data source, using the method demonstrated in 
Chapter   1 
• 
 Drag the  Orders sheet onto the canvas, which leads to the display shown in Figure  2-3  
 Figure 2-2.  Additional data sources 
 

CHAPTER 2 ■ CONNECTING TO TWO DATA SOURCES
13
 The source data can be used as-is. However, in some cases, data may need to be prepared so that it 
can enable better and/or easier analysis. For example, field names can be renamed so that they are easily 
understood by the business users. In some cases, a complex field may need to be split. 
 To rename the  Order ID field:
• 
 Hover over the  Order ID field, as shown in Figure  2-3 , which displays the pull-down 
arrow (shown next to the field name) 
• 
 Click the pull-down arrow for the  Order ID field, which pops up the menu tree 
displayed in Figure  2-4 
 Figure 2-3.  Sample data source 
 

CHAPTER 2 ■ CONNECTING TO TWO DATA SOURCES
14
• 
 Click  Rename , as shown in Figure  2-4 , which pops up the  Rename Field window 
displayed in Figure  2-5 
• 
 If the data type needs to be changed in a column, click the icon below the column 
header, as indicated in Figure  2-4 
 Figure 2-4.  Renaming or changing data type for a field 
 

CHAPTER 2 ■ CONNECTING TO TWO DATA SOURCES
15
• 
 Enter the new field name in the  Name field in the  Rename Field popup box, as 
shown in Figure  2-5 
• 
 Click  OK , which renames the field 
 There are two ways in which data can be accessed and used by Tableau. In  Connect Live , a direct 
connection is made with the data source. In this mode, if the source data changes, it is immediately reflected 
in the visualizations and any analysis being performed. 
 Tableau also supports the  Extract mode , in which data is pulled into the Tableau data engine, which 
takes the data offline. No live connection is maintained with the source system (from which the querying 
load is offloaded). However, in Extract mode, analysis can only be performed up to the time when the extract 
was pulled. When real-time data needs to be analyzed, this option will not work. 
 Figure 2-5.  Rename popup window 
 

CHAPTER 2 ■ CONNECTING TO TWO DATA SOURCES
16
 In Figure  2-6 , the  Extract mode is selected. 
 To switch to  Live mode:
• 
 Click the  Live radio button , as shown in Figure  2-6 
 To access the worksheet:
• 
 Click the  Worksheet tab (Sheet 1), as shown in Figure  2-6 , which leads to the 
worksheet displayed in Figure  2-7 
 Figure 2-6.  Selecting  Extract mode 
 

CHAPTER 2 ■ CONNECTING TO TWO DATA SOURCES
17
 If you are working with a worksheet and need to go back to the data source:
• 
 Click the  Data Source tab, as shown in Figure  2-7 , which opens the data source 
window 
 Additional data sources can be added to an existing data source. Figure  2-8 shows three data sources: 
Orders, People, and Returns.  Orders is already connected. 
 Figure 2-7.  Going back to the data source in  data connection window 
 

CHAPTER 2 ■ CONNECTING TO TWO DATA SOURCES
18
 To add the second data source,  Returns :
• 
 Drag and drop the  Returns sheet onto the canvas next to  Orders , as shown in 
Figure  2-8 , which leads to the display shown in Figure  2-9 
 Figure 2-8.  Selecting a second spreadsheet  tab 
 

CHAPTER 2 ■ CONNECTING TO TWO DATA SOURCES
19
 Tableau automatically joined the  two  tables,  Orders and  Returns , as an inner join.
• 
 Click the  Join icon, as shown in Figure  2-9 , which displays the join details, as shown 
in Figure  2-10 
 Figure 2-9.  Two selected data sources combined with a join 
 

CHAPTER 2 ■ CONNECTING TO TWO DATA SOURCES
20
 Tableau automatically determined that  Order ID is a common field in the two tables,  Orders and 
 Returns , as shown in Figure  2-10 . It also provides the option to select a different field to join two tables. 
 To use a different field for joining  the  two tables:
• 
 Hover over the  Order ID field, as shown in Figure  2-10 , which displays its pull-down 
arrow, shown in Figure  2-11 
 Figure 2-10.  Table joins 
 

CHAPTER 2 ■ CONNECTING TO TWO DATA SOURCES
21
 To use a different field for  joining the two tables:
• 
 Click the  Order ID pull-down arrow shown in Figure  2-11 , which leads to the display 
shown in Figure  2-12 
 Figure 2-11.  Displaying the fields to change the join 
 

CHAPTER 2 ■ CONNECTING TO TWO DATA SOURCES
22
 To select a different field to join the two tables:
• 
 Click the desired field from the list displayed in Figure  2-12 , which changes the join 
field to the field that is clicked (instead of  Order ID) 
 This step was performed in the  Data Source tab. To see how the worksheet was impacted due to the 
addition of the second data source:
• 
 Click the  Sheet 1 tab, as shown in Figure  2-12 , which leads to the display shown in 
Figure  2-13

 CHAPTER 3  
 Exploring the Tableau Interface 
 Objective: This exercise provides an overview of the Tableau interface 
 After connecting to a data source, you see a blank sheet, as displayed in Figure  3-1 , where data 
visualizations can be developed. Through the Tableau interface shown in Figure  3-1 , many powerful and 
useful features can be accessed. 
 Figure 3-1.  Tableau interface 
 

CHAPTER 3 ■ EXPLORING THE TABLEAU INTERFACE
28
 The  menu bar at the top of the window provides access to many powerful features. Below it is the 
 toolbar , which contains many buttons, such as  Save ,  Undo ,  Redo ,  Add New Data Source , and  Duplicate 
Sheet . These buttons are contextual, therefore, only the relevant ones are highlighted—based on the current 
state of the worksheet. 
 The  Marks  card contains additional shelves on which fields can be placed directly (through drag 
and drop).  Shelves  include  Color ,  Size ,  Text ,  Detail , and  Tooltip . Clicking these shelves activate pop-up 
windows that enable their characteristics, such as labels to be edited. The default  Marks type is  Automatic , 
as shown in Figure  3-2 . However, many Mark types can be used instead of the default (Automatic). 
 The  Data window, highlighted in Figures  3-1 and  3-2 , has two tabs:  Data and  Analytics . The default 
tab is  Data , which displays the Dimensions and Measures used to develop visualizations. The  Analytics tab 
displays a completely different set of options, which are focused on analysis . 
 The open data connection is shown at the top of the Data window pane. In Figure  3-2 , the data 
connection displayed is  Orders (Sample – Superstore) . 
 Figure 3-2.  Data and Analytics windows 
 

CHAPTER 3 ■ EXPLORING THE TABLEAU INTERFACE
29
 Views are built by dragging and dropping fields from the  Data  window onto the canvas or directly onto 
the shelves. The  shelves , which are also sometimes referred to as  cards , are as follows:
• 
 Columns shelf 
• 
 Rows shelf 
• 
 Filter shelf 
• 
 Pages shelf 
• 
 Marks  card 
 The layout that is displayed when a  Dashboard tab is selected is somewhat different compared to the 
 Worksheet tab  layout. When a Dashboard window is active…
• 
 The Data window (used in Worksheets) is replaced by the Dashboard Window 
• 
 It lists all the sheets available (in the left-hand window)  
• 
 It lists the Dashboard objects 
• 
 It displays the controls for the objects

 The following should be noted:
• 
 Tableau does not save a worksheet automatically; hence, you must save your work 
before exiting 
• 
 Buttons are contextual; hence, the functions available depend on what is going on in 
the sheet 
 

CHAPTER 3 ■ EXPLORING THE TABLEAU INTERFACE

 To undo or reverse an action, use the  Back arrow. The  Back and  Forward  arrows, highlighted in 
Figure  3-9 , can be used to navigate and go back/forward as visualizations are developed and/or modified. 
 The  Sheet tabs at the bottom of the window, highlighted in Figure  3-9 , are used to create new 
worksheets, dashboards, and stories. Sheets can be moved around (by dragging), renamed, and duplicated. 
By right-clicking the appropriate sheet, a menu tree pops up, which enables the following:
• 
 Copying a sheet 
• 
 Renaming a sheet 
• 
 Deleting a sheet 
• 
 Exporting a sheet 
• 
  Creating a new worksheet, dashboard, or story

 Country Codes 
• 
 Global Superstore 
  Figure 3-10.  Data connections 
 

CHAPTER 3 ■ EXPLORING THE TABLEAU INTERFACE
38
 The view that is displayed in the  Data window—the list of dimensions and measures—depends on 
the data source that is selected. For example, if the  Global Superstore is selected, then its dimensions and 
measures are displayed in the Data window. In Figure  3-10 , the dimensions and measures displayed belong 
to the  Global Superstore data source. 
 If  Country Codes  is  clicked, it changes the view, as shown in Figure  3-11 , where the list of dimensions 
and measures reflects the data contained in the  Country Codes data source.

• 
 Hover over the  Sales bar, as shown in Figure  6-2 , which displays the total sales 
shown in Figure  6-3 ($2,297,201) 
 

CHAPTER 6 ■ USING BASIC ANALYSIS FUNCTIONS
59
 The Tooltip in the Marks card, which can be seen in Figure  6-2 , allows you to customize the information 
displayed when you hover over the visualization. 
 To view results over time:
• 
 Drag and drop  Order Date onto the  Columns  shelf, as shown in Figure  6-3 , which 
leads to the display shown in Figure  6-4 
 Figure 6-3.  Displaying  total sales figure 
 

CHAPTER 6 ■ USING BASIC ANALYSIS FUNCTIONS
60
 Date fields in Tableau, depending on their level of granularity, are automatically brought into the view 
as hierarchies. For example, when you drag Order Date to the Column shelf, Tableau plots the data by Year 
and shows a + symbol next to it, which indicates that you can drill down.
• 
 Expand the  + sign, located just before the  Year (Order Date) in the  Columns shelf, 
as shown in Figure  6-4 , which leads to the display shown in Figure  6-5

 CHAPTER 7  
 Adding, Removing, and Renaming 
a Dimension 
 Objective: This exercise demonstrates how a dimension or measure is added or deleted from a visualization, 
and explains how to rename a dimension 
 We start with the visualization shown in Figure  7-1 , which includes one dimension ( Region ) and one 
measure ( Sales ). 
 Figure 7-1.  Visualization to be modified 
 To add the  Order  Date dimension:
• 
 Drag and drop  Order Date from the  Data  window onto the  Columns shelf, as shown 
in Figure  7-1 , which leads to the display shown in Figure  7-2 
 

CHAPTER 7 ■ ADDING, REMOVING, AND RENAMING A DIMENSION
78
 To remove the  Region  dimension :
• 
 Drag and drop  Region from the  Columns shelf onto the  Data window or below the 
 Marks  card, as shown in Figure  7-2 , which leads to the visualization displayed in 
Figure  7-3

CHAPTER 7 ■ ADDING, REMOVING, AND RENAMING A DIMENSION
79
 The procedure to add and/or  delete a measure is similar to the one used to add/delete a dimension, 
which was demonstrated earlier in this exercise. 
 Renaming  is another useful feature. Sometimes, the dimensions and measures in the source files have 
names that are not clear to end users. Therefore, renaming them can make the system less confusing and 
more user-friendly. Tableau provides the ability to rename dimensions and measures in the Data window, 
where they are displayed.

 CHAPTER 11  
 Crosstab Display and Swapping 
 Objective: This exercise demonstrates how to display visualization data in a crosstab format, how to swap 
axes so that data can be viewed from a different perspective, and how to resize a view 
 We start this exercise with Figure  11-1 , which is based on two dimensions ( Category and  Order Date ) 
and one measure ( Sales ).

 To expand the visualization:
• 
 Click the pull-down arrow, as shown in Figure  11-6 , which displays the available 
screen size options shown in Figure  11-7 
 Resizing 
 Sizing a view can be done quite easily in Tableau. The following steps demonstrate how to size a view. We 
start with Figure  11-6 , which displays a visualization that covers only part of the available window. It does 
not cover the full screen, and therefore, valuable real estate is wasted. Hence, we resize the display so that it 
covers the width of the window.

 CHAPTER 18  
 Exclude and Keep 
 Objective: This exercise demonstrates how the  Exclude and Keep functions are used 
 Figure  18-1  shows a chart with the sum of sales for four regions. 
 Figure 18-1.    Visualization to be modified       
 

CHAPTER 18 ■ EXCLUDE AND KEEP
168
• 
 Click  Exclude , as shown in Figure  18-2 , which leads to the display shown in 
Figure  18-3 , where the results are limited to the remaining three regions     
 Suppose we want to exclude the sales for a specific region and only focus on the sales for the remaining 
three regions. In other words, we want to “exclude” one region from the analysis. The following steps show 
how this is done. 
 To exclude the  West region:
• 
  Right-click the fourth bar (i.e., for the West region, which needs to be excluded), as 
shown in Figure  18-1 , which pops up the menu tree displayed in Figure  18-2 
 Figure 18-2.  Menu tree with the Exclude  option 
 

CHAPTER 18 ■ EXCLUDE AND KEEP
169
 Figure 18-3.    Display after executing the Exclude  function         
 When the  Exclude or  Keep option is used, Tableau creates a filter for the selected dimension. This is 
shown in Figure  18-3 , where the  Region filter has been created. What this does is exclude/filter out all the 
data for the West region from the view. 
 

CHAPTER 18 ■ EXCLUDE AND KEEP
170
 Suppose that you want to analyze the sales for only two items: chairs and tables.
• 
 Hold down the  Ctrl key on the keyboard and then:
• 
 Click the  Chairs bar 
• 
 Click the  Tables bar 
 This leads to the display shown in Figure  18-5 , where two bars are selected and highlighted. Notice the 
small pop-up window that displays the  Keep Only and  Exclude options. 
 Another useful Tableau function is  Keep . It retains selected items while excluding all the other 
displayed items. The following steps show how this is done. 
 Figure  18-4  displays the sum of sales for various sub-categories.

 Items in the Quick Filter can be selected or deselected by adding or removing a check mark next to the 
desired item. For example, the check marks next to  Central and  West can be deselected, which limits the 
analysis to the remaining two regions ( East and  South ). 
 Figure  20-6 shows that two items have been deselected from the  Region Quick Filter: Central and West. 
Hence, the displayed results are limited to the remaining two regions: East and South.

 CHAPTER 24  
 Dependency in Quick Filters 
 Objective: This exercise demonstrates how two filters can be made dependent, which is also known as 
cascading filters 
 If there are two Quick Filters on a worksheet, the items displayed in the second filter can be made 
dependent on the item selected in the first filter. The filters can be set up so that, for example, if Africa is 
selected as the  Region in the first filter, only the countries in Africa will be displayed in the  Countries Quick 
Filter—instead of every country in every region. 
 Figure  24-1 displays a visualization based on  Sales by  Region .

 CHAPTER 37  
 Creating a Dashboard 
 Objective: This exercise demonstrates how to create a dashboard 
 Dashboards can present one or more views, so that a consolidated view is provided. A view 
incorporated into a dashboard is just a window to the underlying worksheet. Dashboards tie together 
different views and frequently offer filters, legends, and interactivity. They can include worksheets, images, 
text, and web pages. Stories are walk-throughs of one or more dashboards or sheets. Dashboards answer 
“What?” whereas stories answer “Why?”. 
 Figure  37-1  shows the following  five sheets that can be incorporated into a dashboard:
• 
 Sales Seasonality 
• 
 Crosstab 
• 
  Global Sales and Profits 
• 
 Sales by Category 
• 
 Customer Breakdown 

CHAPTER 37 ■ CREATING A DASHBOARD
338
• 
 Click the  New Dashboard icon, as shown in Figure  37-1 , which leads to the display 
shown in Figure  37-2 , where a new dashboard sheet ( Dashboard 1 ) has been added 
 Figure 37-1.  View with  five sheets

 The size to be selected depends on the device(s) used for viewing the dashboard, which includes 
devices as diverse as desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones.
• 
 Click  Laptop (800 × 600) , as shown in Figure  37-3 , which leads to the display shown

in Figure  37-4 , which leads to the display in Figure  37-5 
 

CHAPTER 37 ■ CREATING A DASHBOARD
342
 When the first view is brought into a dashboard, it automatically takes up the entire view. However, any 
subsequent worksheet can be placed in specific areas of the screen. If the mouse button is held down as it is 
moved around the dashboard, gray areas indicate where the dragged view will be located when the mouse 
button is released. If the view is brought all the way down to the bottom of the screen, it fills the entire width.
