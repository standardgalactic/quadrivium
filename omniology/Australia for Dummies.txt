About the Authors
Sydney resident Marc Llewellyn is one of Australia’s premier travel writ-
ers and the winner of several writing awards. He is the president of the
Australian Society of Travel Writers. He’s written two travelogues; Riders
to the Midnight Sun tells of his journey from the Ukrainian Black Sea to
the Russian Arctic on a cheap bicycle. His latest manuscript, with the
working title Islands of the Winds, tells the story of a year working as a
peasant farmer and shrimp fisherman on an island off Sicily. He is the
coauthor of Frommer’s Australia.
Lee Mylne has spent almost all her working life as a journalist — in news-
papers, magazines, and radio — and has travelled to more than 40 coun-
tries. Born and raised in New Zealand, she has lived in Australia since
1986 and is currently based in Melbourne. In 2006, she was awarded Life
Membership of the Australian Society of Travel Writers, of which she is 
a past president. She is the coauthor of Frommer’s Australia, the author
of Frommer’s Portable Australia’s Great Barrier Reef, and a contributor to
Frommer’s Dream Vacations. She is also the coeditor and a contributor to

Introduction
S
o you want to go to the Land Down Under! We heartily concur with
your choice, because we live here, we love it, and we want to show
you what makes Australia such a special place.
Traveling halfway around the world (which most readers of this book
will be doing) is a big undertaking, and we’re here to help you break it
into doable parts. We help you decide where in Australia you want to go,
tell you how to get there, and give you the scoop on what to do after you
arrive.
From the Outback to the Great Barrier Reef to glorious cities like Sydney
and Melbourne, we give you options so you can find the experiences
that are right for you — whether you want to cuddle a koala, explore a
shipwreck, or climb the Sydney Harbour Bridge (or all three!).
About This Book
Australia For Dummies is a concise and precise guide to the top destina-
tions in Australia. In addition to the “Big Three” of Sydney, the Great
Barrier Reef, and Uluru (Ayers Rock), we offer an overview of the other
major cities, activities, and resorts throughout the country. We give you
information about all the Australian states, in case you find yourself
wanting to hop over to Tasmania or up to Kakadu, for example.
We’ve done the legwork for you. We give you only the info you need —
from what to do before you leave, to what you need to know when you
get here.
This is a guidebook and also a reference book. You can read it cover to
cover, or you can jump in anywhere to find the information you want
about a specific city or region. Whether you’re sitting in your living room
figuring out how many vacation days you’ll need for the trip, or looking
for a sushi restaurant in Sydney, Australia For Dummies is set up so you
can get the facts, descriptions, and recommendations you want, quickly.
You can open it to any chapter and dig in to get the information you
need without any hassles.
Please be advised that travel information is subject to change at any
time — and this is especially true of prices. We suggest that you write or
call ahead for confirmation when making your travel plans. The authors,

editors, and publisher cannot be held responsible for the experiences of
readers while traveling. Your safety is important to us, so we encourage
you to stay alert and be aware of your surroundings. Keep a close eye 
on cameras, purses, and wallets — all favorite targets of thieves and
pickpockets.
Conventions Used in This Book
In this book, we include lists of hotels, restaurants, and attractions. As
we describe each, we often use abbreviations for commonly accepted
credit cards. Take a look at the following list for an explanation of each:
AE: American Express
DC: Diners Club
MC: MasterCard
V: Visa
Note: The Discover card is not accepted in Australia.
We divide the hotels into two categories — our personal favorites and
those that don’t make our preferred list but still get our hearty seal of
approval. Don’t be shy about considering the runner-up hotels if you
can’t get a room at one of the favorites or if your preferences differ from
ours. The amenities that the runners-up offer, and the services that each
provides, make all these accommodations good choices to consider as
you determine where to rest your head at night.
We also include some general pricing information to help you decide
where to unpack your bags or dine on the local cuisine. We use a system
of dollar signs to show a range of costs for one night in a hotel (in a
double room) or a meal at a restaurant (included in the cost of each
meal is an appetizer, entree, and nonalcoholic beverage). Check out the
following chart to see what range we’re using (in U.S. dollars):
Cost
Hotel
Restaurant
$
Less than $80
Less than $25
$$
$81–$160
$26–$40
$$$
$161–$240
$41–$55
$$$$
$241–$320
$56 and over
$$$$$
$321 and over
Prices in this guide for hotels, restaurants, attractions, and services are
given first in Australian dollars (A$), and then converted into U.S. dollars
(US$) and British pounds (£).
Australia For Dummies, 1st Edition

The exchange rate used throughout the book is A$1 = US$0.80/£0.40,
US$1 = A$1.25, or £1 = A$2.45. You can find a chart giving examples of
how much various things cost in all three currencies in Chapter 5.
Foolish Assumptions
As we wrote this book, we made some assumptions about you and what
your needs may be as a traveler. Here’s what we assumed about you:
 You may be an inexperienced traveler looking for guidance when
determining whether to take a trip to Australia and how to plan it.
 You may be an experienced traveler who hasn’t yet been to
Australia and wants expert advice on how to best plan your trip
and enjoy the country.
 You’re not looking for a book that provides all the information avail-
able about Australia or that lists every hotel, restaurant, or attraction
available to you. Instead, you’re looking for a book that focuses on the
places that give you the best or most unusual experience in Australia.
If you fit any of these criteria, Australia For Dummies gives you the infor-
mation you’re looking for!
How This Book Is Organized
This book is divided into eight parts covering the major aspects of your
trip and the regions of Australia. Each part is broken down into specific
components so you can go right to the subtopic you want. (If you want
to go to the Great Barrier Reef, you don’t have to read all about the Red
Centre, for example.) Following are brief summaries of the parts.
Part I: Introducing Australia
Get a panoramic view of Australia as we scan the continent’s highlights,
the not-to-be-missed attractions and activities. We give you a thumbnail
sketch of Australia’s history and culture. Then we help you decide when
to go, based on the seasons and events, and offer some itineraries based
on time and interests.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Australia
Australia isn’t a spur-of-the-moment destination. And part of the fun of
planning a trip to such a huge, remote place is figuring out where you want
to go and what you want to do. Ah, the possibilities! We help you get off on
the right foot, and let you know about things you need to do (like getting a
visa) before you leave. We can give you ideas on how to budget for the trip,
Introduction 3

the different ways to get here, and how to get around after you’re here. We
also provide resources for those with special travel needs and interests.
Part III: Sydney, Melbourne, and the 
Australian Capital Territory
Sydney and Melbourne are two of the largest cities in Australia, each
with world-class hotels, dining, arts, and nightlife. We have lots of good
advice about visiting these cities and their environs. Located between
Melbourne and Sydney is the nation’s capital, Canberra, in a federal dis-
trict called Australian Capital Territory.
Part IV: Brisbane, Queensland, 
and the Great Barrier Reef
Brisbane is the closest major city to the Great Barrier Reef; in this part,
we give you the highlights. From Brisbane, you can make your way to
one of the natural wonders of the world: the Great Barrier Reef. We give
you the lowdown on the top resorts along the coast and on the Reef
itself, as well as information about the many activities you can partici-
pate in.
Part V: The Red Centre and the Top End
Mysterious Uluru (Ayers Rock) stands tall in the Red Centre, where it’s
been the object of curiosity for thousands of years. We tell you the best
way to get to this remote part of Australia, where to stay, and about the
charming town of Alice Springs, as well as the other natural wonders in
the area. The Northern Territory, just above the Red Centre, is known as
the Top End, and we introduce you to its capital city of Darwin, as well
as the mammoth Kakadu National Park.
Part VI: The South and West
These regions offer smart cities and great natural beauty, and they pro-
duce some of the finest wines in Australia (and the world). Adelaide is a
great starting point for touring the south, and there’s nowhere better
than Kangaroo Island for seeing marsupials in the wild. Perth is the
major city in Western Australia, providing an excellent base for wine
tours and wildflower watching.
Part VII: Tasmania
The island-state is home to colonial cities, beautiful parks, and unique
wildlife, including the endangered Tasmanian devil. It’s also a more 
manageable size than some of the great expanses of the mainland.
Part VIII: The Part of Tens
Every For Dummies book has a Part of Tens. These fun and pithy chap-
ters are a list of what makes a place special. In this case, we take a look
Australia For Dummies, 1st Edition 
4

at ten sites that are part of Australia’s convict history, and then give you
ten Australian expressions you need to know!
In the back of this book, we include an appendix — your Quick
Concierge — containing lots of handy information you may need, rang-
ing from area codes to customs regulations, electricity, and driving rules
(there are individual “Fast Facts” sections in most chapters with impor-
tant local information). Check out this appendix when searching for
answers to lots of questions that may come up as you travel. You can
find the Quick Concierge easily, because it’s printed on yellow paper.
Icons Used in This Book
These icons appear in the margins throughout this book:
Keep an eye out for the Bargain Alert icon as you seek money-saving tips
and/or great deals.
The Best of the Best icon highlights the best that Australia has to offer.
Watch for the Heads Up icon to identify annoying or potentially danger-
ous situations, such as tourist traps, unsafe neighborhoods, budgetary
rip-offs, and other circumstances to beware of.
Look to the Kid Friendly icon for attractions, hotels, restaurants, and
activities that are particularly hospitable to children or people traveling
with kids.
This icon highlights those only-in-Australia places that are unique to the
Land Down Under.
The Tip icon highlights useful advice on things to do and ways to sched-
ule your time.
Where to Go from Here
Your next stop is Australia, a living, vibrant, wonderfully diverse country
that offers something for every taste, inclination, or budget. It’s a place
that’s worth traveling halfway around the world for!

Introducing
Australia

In this part . . .
I
t’s a country . . . it’s a continent . . . it’s got beaches,
deserts, mountains, and great cities. Australia is a place
that’s both ancient and modern, with remote wilderness and
teeming urban areas. In this part, we give you glimpses of all
the above, with some of our personal bests in lodging, dining,
attractions, and activities. We also offer up a brief history of
human presence on the continent, add some advice on the
seasons (they go by opposites!), and provide four suggested
itineraries for your stay.

Chapter 1
Discovering the Best 
of Australia
by Marc Llewellyn and Lee Mylne
In This Chapter
 Discovering the best lodgings, dining, and attractions
 Experiencing the best of Aboriginal culture
 Viewing the best Australian flora and fauna
 Kicking back on the best beaches and hiking the best trails
B
est means different things to different people. So the best we can
do is share with you our personal favorites. Australia’s scenery,
wildlife, culture, beaches, lodgings, food, and weather can all — in vari-
ous guises — lay claim to being world-class. The landscape, in places, is
almost unbelievable, all bathed in a special light that’s found nowhere
else in the world.
There are, of course, the “big three” — Sydney, the Great Barrier Reef,
and the magnificent monolith Uluru, known affectionately as “the Rock.”
These should be on your list, but don’t forget that Australia has so much
more to offer: charming country towns, isolated and pristine beaches,
rustic sheep stations, rain forest villages, and mountain lodges. To find
out what you’ll be missing if you don’t — even occasionally — take the
road less traveled, check out this chapter, in which we try to narrow our
personal choices in the “Best of” stakes.
The Best Luxury Hotels
The big cities offer the high-end chains as well as boutique hotels. The
resorts on the Great Barrier Reef, both onshore and on their own islands,
are gorgeous and loaded with amenities as well as natural beauty.
 Park Hyatt Sydney (Sydney, New South Wales): This artistically
curving property on The Rocks foreshore is the best-positioned
hotel in town. It’s right on the water, and some rooms have views

across the harbor to the Sydney Opera House. The building is a
pleasure to look at, and from a ferry on the harbor, it looks like a
wonderful addition to the toy-town landscape of The Rocks. Each of
the 33 executive suites has two balconies equipped with a tele-
scope. See Chapter 11.
 Sebel Reef House (Cairns, Queensland): Drop-dead gorgeous —
that’s the only way to describe this period piece from the colonial
era. This is one of the most romantic hotels in Australia. The white
walls are swathed in bougainvillea, and the beds with mosquito 
netting. Airy interiors feature rustic handmade artifacts and white
wicker furniture. The Verandah Spa rooms, which have Jacuzzis on
the balconies within earshot of the ocean, overlook the pool, water-
falls, and lush gardens. See Chapter 17.
 Longitude 131 (Uluru/Ayers Rock, Red Centre): You can find this
African-style luxury safari camp, with perfect views of Uluru, in the
sand dunes a mile or two from the main complex. It offers 15 top-
class air-conditioned tents, each with a private bathroom and a 
balcony overlooking the Rock. The resort is promoting them as 
“six star.” A central facility, Dune House, holds a restaurant (with
superb food), bar, library, and shop. See Chapter 18.
 Hayman Island Resort (Whitsunday Islands, Queensland): This 
is the most luxurious and glamorous resort in Australia. Check-in is
done over a glass of bubbly aboard the resort’s sleek launch as you
travel from Hamilton Island Airport. You soon find your way through
the open-air sandstone lanais, cascading ponds, and tropical foliage
to the fabulous hexagonal complex of swimming pools by the sea.
Dress is beachwear by day, smart casual at night. Every room, suite,
villa, and penthouse has a balcony or terrace, bathrobes, and valet
service (and butler service in the penthouses). See Chapter 17.
The Best Moderate and Alternative
Accommodations
With a decent exchange rate and a good supply of moderately priced
places to stay, you can find both comfort and bargains throughout
Australia. We also include some unique places to stay.
 North Adelaide Heritage Group (Adelaide, South Australia): It’s
worth coming to Adelaide just for the experience of staying in 
one of these out-of-this-world apartments, cottages, or suites. Each
of the 21 properties is fabulous. We particularly recommend the
former Friendly Meeting Chapel Hall, once the headquarters of 
the “Albert Lodge No. 6 of the Independent Order of Oddfellows,
Manchester Unity Friendly Society, and the Court Huntsman’s Pride
No. 2478 of the Ancient Order of Foresters Friendly Society.” See

 Underground Motel (Broken Hill, New South Wales): Making the
trip out to White Cliffs is worth the effort, just to stay here for the
night. All but two of the rooms are underground; they’re reached 
by a maze of spacious tunnels dug out of the rock and sealed with
epoxy resin. The temperature below ground is a constant 72°F
(22°C), which is decidedly cooler than a summer day outside.
Rooms are comfortable though basic, with shared toilets and 
showers. Turn the light off, and it’s dark as a cave. See Chapter 12.
 Freycinet Lodge (Freycinet National Park, Tasmania): We can’t
praise this ecofriendly lodge enough. Comfortable one- and two-
room cabins spread unobtrusively through the bush, connected by
raised walking tracks. The main part of the lodge houses a lounge
room and an excellent restaurant that sweeps out onto a veranda
overlooking the limpid green waters of Great Oyster Bay. The lodge
is right next to the white sands of Hazards Beach, and from here 
it’s an easy stroll to the start of the Wineglass Bay walk. See
Chapter 23.
 Reef Retreat (Cairns, Queensland): A low-rise collection of contem-
porary studios and suites built around a saltwater swimming pool
in a peaceful grove of palms and silver Paperbarks, Reef Retreat has
36 units, including studios (which are much larger than the average
hotel room and offer terrific value). See Chapter 17.
The Best Dining Experiences
From gloriously fresh seafood to traditional Australian “bush tucker,”
you’ll find Australia’s culinary offerings are as diverse as the landscape.
Waves of immigration have brought tastes from around the world into
the native cuisine, and you’ll find ethnic restaurants all over. Don’t forget
to try the world-class wines, and hoist a brew or two!
 Spirit House (Yandina, Queensland): Walk along the jungle paths to
the hidden building and you’ll start to get an idea of what’s in store at
this amazing restaurant on the Sunshine Coast. Tables are set around
a lagoon and among the trees, with massive statues and other art-
works scattered throughout. The flavors that come out of this kitchen
are mainly Thai but with other Asian influences. See Chapter 17.
 Tetsuya’s (Sydney, New South Wales): Tetsuya’s was named the
fifth best restaurant in the world in Restaurant Magazine’s annual
list of the world’s 50 best eateries in 2007. So what makes Tetsuya’s
so good? On a recent visit, we secured a table next to the ceiling-to-
floor windows and had an intimate view across a Japanese-inspired
courtyard with maples and waterfall. The service is impeccable;
the food, truly inspired. See Chapter 11.
 e’cco bistro (Brisbane, Queensland): Simple food, done exception-
ally well and with passion. That’s the winning philosophy behind
Chapter 1: Discovering the Best of Australia 11

the food at e’cco, one of Australia’s top restaurants. Housed in a
former tea warehouse on the city fringe, the bistro has large win-
dows, bold colors, and modern furniture. Dishes include such
delights as duck breast with Peking duck consommé, wombok,
broccolini, chilli, and ginger; or grilled white fish with a cassoulet of
white beans, clams, mussels, parsley, and peppers. See Chapter 16.
 Mures Upper Deck (Hobart, Tasmania): This large and bustling
waterfront restaurant offers great views of bobbing yachts as well
as very fine seafood caught on the owner’s own fishing boats. I 
recommend starting with a bowl of the signature Mures Smokey
Chowder or some local oysters. A real treat is the seafood platter.
The best summer dessert is the restaurant’s famous summer pud-
ding, which almost bursts with berries. See Chapter 22.
The Best Museums
Australia charts its tumultuous history in some fine museums; here are a
few of the ones we find most interesting:
 National Museum of Australia (Acton, Australian Capital Territory):
Using state-of-the-art technology and hands-on exhibits, the museum
concentrates on three themes: Australian society and its history
since 1788; the interaction of people with the Australian environ-
ment; and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander cultures and histo-
ries. It relies more on images and sound than on historical objects
to tell the stories. See Chapter 15.
 The Australian Aviation Heritage Centre (Darwin, Northern
Territory): This museum has a B-52 bomber as its most prized
exhibit but also boasts a B-25 Mitchell bomber, Mirage and Sabre
jet fighters, and rare Japanese Zero fighter wreckage. Even if you
aren’t a military or aircraft buff, you may enjoy the funny, sad,
heartwarming, and sometimes heart-wrenching displays on World
War II and Vietnam. See Chapter 19.
 The National Gallery of Victoria (Melbourne, Victoria): The inter-
national branch of the National Gallery (in St. Kilda), and its Ian
Potter Centre, off Federation Square, combine to offer a collection
of international art, including works by Gainsborough, Constable,
Bonnard, Delacroix, Van Dyck, El Greco, Monet, Manet, Magritte,
and Rembrandt, and more than 20 rooms dedicated to Australian
art. See Chapter 13.
The Best of Aboriginal Culture
Australia has many places in which you can learn more about the cul-
ture of the indigenous people who have lived on this land for millennia.
The best places are in the Red Centre, at Alice Springs and Uluru-Kata
Part I: Introducing Australia 
12

Tjuta, and in the Northern Territory. Some take the form of tours, others
are cultural centers. Aboriginal art can also make a unique souvenir.
 You’ll taste bush food, throw boomerangs, and learn about
Aboriginal family values during a half-day tour of the Aborigine-
owned Aboriginal Art & Culture Centre in Alice Springs. Anangu
Tours run a series of walks around and near Uluru (Ayers Rock).
The Anangu are the traditional owners of Uluru. Join them for walks
around the Rock as you learn about the “snake men” who fought
battles here, pick bush food off trees, throw spears, visit rock paint-
ings, and watch the sun set. See Chapter 18.
 Manyallaluk, The Dreaming Place, is an Aboriginal community
near Katherine, in the Northern Territory, which welcomes visitors
and teaches them to paint, weave, throw boomerangs, and perform
other tasks of daily life. It’s a low-key day and the chance to chat
one-on-one with Aboriginal people in their home. Mike Keighley of
Far Out Adventures takes tours to Elsey Station (a ranch) near
Katherine, where you can visit with the children of the Mangarrayi
people, sample bush tucker, learn a little bush medicine, and swim
in a natural “spa pool” in the Roper River. See Chapter 19.
 Tjapukai Aboriginal Cultural Park, in Cairns, is a multimillion-
dollar center showcasing the history of the Tjapukai people —
their Dreamtime creation history and their often-harrowing experi-
ences since the white man arrived — using a film, superb theatrical
work, and a dance performance. Its Aboriginal arts-and-crafts gift
shop is one of the country’s best, and there is also an outdoor “cor-
roboree” experience at night. See Chapter 17.
 Tandanya Aboriginal Cultural Institute in the South Australian
capital, Adelaide, is a good place to find out more about Aboriginal
culture. At the Institute, they offer boomerang- and spear-throwing
instruction, painting with natural ochers, discussions on Aboriginal
culture, and guided walking tours. See Chapter 20.
The Best Natural Scenery
Australia offers some of the most diverse landscapes in the world. From
long sweeps of pristine beach to the red dust of the Outback, the lush
green rain forests of the Tropics, and rugged mountain ranges, some-
where you’ll find a landscape to tear at your heart.
 The 74 islands of the Whitsundays are best seen from the deck of
your own private yacht. Bareboat sailing (or skipper-yourself) is
one of the most popular pastimes here, and it’s easy to see why as
you explore the deserted bays, snorkel over dazzling reefs, fish for
coral trout, and feel the wind in your sails. It’s on the same latitude
as Tahiti, and on the same level of beauty. See Chapter 17.
Chapter 1: Discovering the Best of Australia 13

 Kata Tjuta (the Olgas) and Uluru (Ayers Rock) are mysterious and
magnetic. Uluru has an impact that’s hard to describe — and even
the photos you’ll see won’t prepare you for it. Just as awesome are
the red domes of Kata Tjuta, just 50km (31 miles) from the Rock.
These are even more significant to Aboriginal people than Uluru,
and more intriguing to many visitors. See Chapter 18.
 Vast fields of wildflowers — pink, mauve, red, white, yellow, and
blue — cover much of Western Australia every spring, from around
August through October. Join the Australians who flock here for the
spectacle, but make sure you book ahead. See Chapter 21.
The Best Places to Snorkel and Dive
It goes without saying that the best places to snorkel and dive in
Australia are on the Great Barrier Reef, right? Well, not quite. It’s true,
but the important thing is to realize that Australia offers divers and
snorkelers many other options, depending on which part of the country
you’re visiting. Second only to the Reef is the lesser-known Ningaloo
Reef in Western Australia, so put that on your list, too.
 Heron Island is the top snorkel and dive site in Australia. If you
stayed in the water for a week, you couldn’t snorkel all the acres of
coral stretching from shore. Take your pick of around 20 dive sites,
about half of them within a 15-minute boat ride from the island’s
jetty: the Coral Cascades, with football trout and anemones; the
Blue Pools, favored by octopus, turtles, and sharks; Heron Bommie,
with its rays, eels, and more. See Chapter 17.
 Off Cairns, the gateway to the Great Barrier Reef for most 
people, are Moore, Norman, Hardy, Saxon, and Arlington reefs and
Michaelmas and Upolu cays — all about 90 minutes by boat. You
can explore them on a day trip from Cairns or join a live-aboard
boat. Among the fabulous dive sites off Port Douglas, north of
Cairns, are Split-Bommie, with its fan corals and schools of fusiliers;
Barracuda Pass, with its coral gardens and giant clams; and the
swim-through coral spires of the Cathedrals. See Chapter 17.
 Lady Elliot Island, off the Queensland coast near Bundaberg, is a
coral cay island with gorgeous coral lagoons, perfect for snorkeling.
Boats take you farther out to snorkel above manta rays, plate coral,
and big fish. Divers can swim through the blowhole, 16m (52 ft.)
down, and see gorgonian fans, soft and hard corals, sharks, barra-
cudas, and reef fish. See Chapter 17.
Part I: Introducing Australia

The Best Wildlife Viewing
Australia’s wildlife is unique. Isolation has given the continent some of
the world’s most unusual animals — the kangaroo, the platypus, and the
koala to name just three. Add to that abundant birdlife, reptiles, and
marine life and you’ve got more than enough to keep the most avid
wildlife watchers happy.
 You’ll see more native animals on South Australia’s Kangaroo
Island — including koalas, wallabies, birds, echidnas, reptiles,
seals, and sea lions — than anywhere else in the country, apart
from a wildlife park. And the distances between major points of
interest are not great, so you won’t spend half the day just getting
from place to place. See Chapter 20.
 If cuddling a koala is high on your list, head to Brisbane’s Lone
Pine Koala Sanctuary. This is the world’s first and largest koala
sanctuary. Along with 130 koalas, lots of other Aussie wildlife —
including wombats, Tasmanian devils, ’roos (which you can hand-
feed), and colorful parakeets — are on show. You can even have
your photo taken with a koala in your arms. See Chapter 16.
 Kakadu National Park in the Northern Territory is home to one-
third of Australia’s bird species. It’s also the favored habitat of 
lots of saltwater crocodiles, which you can see on a cruise on the
Yellow Water Billabong. See Chapter 19.
 Head into Queensland’s World Heritage–listed Wet Tropics
Rainforest behind Cairns or Port Douglas with Wait-a-While
Rainforest Tours to spotlight possums, lizards, pythons, or even
the shy and elusive platypus. Groups regularly spot the rare,
bizarre Lumholtz’s tree kangaroo. See Chapter 17.
The Best Beaches
Australia is blessed with thousands of beaches, some deserted and
some more popular. So bring your cozzie (Australian for “swimsuit”) and
take the plunge!
 The sea is turquoise, the sun is warm, the palms sway, and the 
low-rise hotels beside Four Mile Beach can’t spoil the feeling that 
it is a million miles from anywhere. But isn’t there always a serpent
in paradise? In this case, the “serpents” are North Queensland’s
Chapter 1: Discovering the Best of Australia 15

seasonal, potentially deadly marine stingers. Come from June
through September to avoid them. See Chapter 17.
 Azure water, islands dotting the horizon, and white sand edged by
vine forests make Mission Beach a real winner. The bonus is that
hardly anyone comes here. Cassowaries (giant emulike birds) hide
in the rain forest, and the tiny town of Mission Beach makes itself
invisible behind the leaves. See Chapter 17.
 Perth has 19 great beaches, but the petite crescent of Cottesloe
Beach is the prettiest. After you’ve checked out the scene, join the
fashionable set for brunch in the Indiana Tea House, a mock-
Edwardian bathhouse fronting the sea. See Chapter 21.
The Best Places for a Bushwalk
 Many bushwalks in the Blue Mountains National Park offer awe-
some views of valleys, waterfalls, cliffs, and forest. You get to walk
beneath dripping tree ferns, underneath pounding cascades, and
through areas skirted by wilderness. All are easy to reach from
Sydney. See Chapter 12.
 You can start from Alice Springs and walk the 250km (155-mile)
semi-desert Larapinta Trail, which winds through the stark crim-
son McDonnell Ranges. You don’t have to walk the entire length —
plenty of day-length and multiday sections are possible. This one’s
for the cooler months only (Apr–Oct). See Chapter 18.
 Whether a wetlands stroll or an overnight hike in virgin bushland,
you can find it in the World Heritage–listed Kakadu National Park.
You’ll see red cliffs, cycads, waterfalls, lagoons hiding man-eating
crocodiles, what sometimes looks like Australia’s entire bird popu-
lation, and Aboriginal rock art. See Chapter 19.
 The 80km (50-mile) Overland Track between Cradle Mountain &
Lake St. Clair National Park is arguably the best hike in Australia.
The trek, from Cradle Mountain to Lake St. Clair, takes five to ten
days, depending on your fitness level. Shorter walks, some lasting
just half an hour, are also accessible. See Chapter 23.

T
his chapter helps you find out more about Australia’s history, cul-
ture, and people. Starting from prehistoric times, we give you a
thumbnail sketch of Australian history, introduce some of the country’s
unique animals and landscapes, and talk about the people who make 
up the diverse Australian population. We also give you some tips on
Australian cuisine and potent potables, because Australia is world
famous (and rightly so!) for its fabulous beers and wines.
History 101: The Main Events
In the beginning, there was the Dreamtime — at least according to the
Aborigines of Australia. Between then and now, perhaps, the supercon-
tinent referred to as Pangaea split into two huge continents called
Laurasia and Gondwanaland. Over millions of years, continental drift
carried the landmasses apart. Gondwanaland divided into South America,
Africa, India, Australia and New Guinea, and Antarctica. Giant marsu-
pials evolved to roam the continent of Australia: Among them were a
plant-eating animal that looked like a wombat the size of a rhinoceros; a
giant squashed-face kangaroo standing 3m (10 ft.) high; and a flightless
bird the same size as an emu, but four times heavier. The last of these
giant marsupials is thought to have died out 40,000 years ago, possibly
helped toward extinction by Aborigines.
The existence of Australia had been in the minds of Europeans since the
Greek astronomer Ptolemy drew a map of the world in about A.D. 150

showing a large landmass in the south, which he believed had to be
there to balance out the land in the Northern Hemisphere. He called it
Terra Australia Incognita — the unknown southland.
Evidence suggests that Portuguese ships reached Australia as early as
1536 and even charted part of its coastline. In 1606, William Jansz was
sent by the Dutch East India Company to open up a new route to the
Spice Islands, and to find New Guinea, which was supposed to be rich 
in gold. Between 1616 and 1640, many more Dutch ships made contact
with Australia as they hugged the west coast of “New Holland.”
In 1642, the Dutch East India Company, through the governor general of
the Indies, Anthony Van Diemen, sent Abel Tasman to find and map the
southland. Over two voyages, he charted the northern Australian coast-
line and discovered Tasmania, which he named Van Diemen’s Land.
Captain James Cook turned up in 1770 and charted the east coast in his
ship H.M.S. Endeavour. He claimed the land for Britain and named it New
South Wales, probably as a favor to Thomas Pennant, a Welsh patriot
and botanist. Cook landed at Botany Bay, which he named after the dis-
covery of scores of plants hitherto unknown to science. Turning north-
ward, Cook passed an entrance to a possible harbor, which appeared to
offer safe anchorage, and named it Port Jackson after the secretary to
the admiralty, George Jackson. Back in Britain, King George III viewed
Australia as a potential colony and repository of Britain’s overflowing
prison population, which could no longer be transported to the United
States of America following the War of Independence.
The First Fleet left England in May 1787, made up of 11 store and trans-
port ships (none of them bigger than the passenger ferries that ply
modern-day Sydney Harbour) led by Arthur Phillip. Aboard were 1,480
people, including 759 convicts. Phillip’s flagship, The Supply, reached
Botany Bay in January 1788, but Phillip decided the soil was poor and
the surroundings too swampy. On January 26, now celebrated as
Australia Day, he settled on Port Jackson (Sydney Harbour) instead.
The convicts were immediately put to work clearing land, planting
crops, and constructing buildings. The early food harvests were failures,
and by early 1790, the fledgling colony was facing starvation.
Phillip decided to give some convicts pardons for good behavior and
service, and grant small land parcels to those who were industrious. In
1795, coal was discovered; in 1810, Governor Macquarie began city
building projects; and, in 1813, the explorers Blaxland, Wentworth, and
Lawson forged a passage over the Blue Mountains to the fertile plains
beyond.
When gold was discovered in Victoria in 1852, and in Western Australia
12 years later, hundreds of thousands of immigrants from Europe,
America, and China flooded into the country. By 1860, over a million
non-Aboriginal people were living in Australia.
Part I: Introducing Australia 
18

The last 10,000 convicts were transported to Western Australia between
1850 and 1868, bringing the total shipped to Australia to 168,000.
On January 1, 1901, the six states that made up Australia proclaimed
themselves to be part of one nation, and the Commonwealth of Australia
was formed. In 1914, Australia joined the mother country in war. In April
the following year, the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (Anzac)
formed a beachhead on the peninsula of Gallipoli in Turkey. The Turkish
troops had been warned, and eight months of fighting ended with 8,587
Australian dead and more than 19,000 wounded.
Australians fought in World War II in North Africa, Greece, and the 
Middle East. In March 1942, Japanese aircraft bombed Broome in Western
Australia and Darwin in the Northern Territory. In May 1942, Japanese
midget submarines entered Sydney Harbour and torpedoed a ferry before
being destroyed. Later that year, Australian volunteers fought an incredi-
bly brave retreat through the jungles of Papua New Guinea on the Kokoda
Track against much larger Japanese forces. Australian troops fought
alongside Americans in subsequent wars in Korea and Vietnam and sent
military support to the Persian Gulf conflicts.
Following World War II, mass immigration to Australia, primarily from
Europe, boosted the population. In 1974 the left-of-center Whitlam 
government put an end to the White Australia policy that had largely
restricted black and Asian immigration since 1901. In 1986, the Australian
Constitution was separated from that of England.
In 1992, the High Court handed down the “Mabo” decision that ruled
that Aborigines had a right to claim government-owned land if they
could prove a continued connection with it.
The 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney put medal-winning Australian ath-
letes Cathy Freeman and Ian Thorpe in the spotlight, and spurred a new
wave of interest and tourism in the Land Down Under.
Australia is a modern nation coming to terms with its identity. The
umbilical cord with Mother England has been cut, and the nation is still
trying to find its position within Asia.
One thing Australia realized early on was the importance of tourism to
its economy. Millions flock here every year. Factor in the landscape, the
native Australian culture, the sunshine, the animals, and some of the
world’s best cities, and you’ve got a fascinating, accessible destination
full of amazing diversity and variety.
Taking In Australia’s Landscape
People wonder why such a huge country has a population of just 20 mil-
lion people. The truth is, Australia can barely support that many. About
90 percent of those people live on only 2.6 percent of the continent.
Chapter 2: Digging Deeper into Australia 19

Climatic and physical land conditions ensure that the only decent rain-
fall occurs along a thin strip of land around Australia’s coast. It’s been
even tougher of late: Australia is in the grip of the worst drought in a
century. The vast majority of Australia is harsh Outback. People survive
where they can in this great arid land because of one thing: the Great
Artesian Basin. This saucer-shaped geological formation stretches over
much of inland New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia, and the
Northern Territory. Beneath it are underground water supplies stored
some 66 million to 208 million years ago, when the area was much like
the Amazon basin is today. Bore holes bring water to the surface and
allow sheep, cattle, and humans a respite from the dryness.
Just off the Queensland coast, The Great Barrier Reef stretches some
2,000km (1,240 miles) from off Gladstone, to the Gulf of Papua, near New
Guinea. It’s not more than 8,000 years old, although many fear that rising
seawater, caused by global warming, will cause its demise. As it is, the
nonnative Crown of Thorns starfish and a bleaching process believed to
be the result of excessive nutrients flowing into the sea from Australia’s
farming land, is causing significant damage.
Meeting Australia’s Unique Animals
Australia’s isolation from the rest of the world over millions of years has
led to the evolution of forms of life found nowhere else. Probably the
strangest of all is the platypus. This monotreme (egg-laying marsupial)
has webbed feet, a ducklike bill, and a tail like a beaver’s. It lays eggs,
and the young suckle from their mother. When a specimen was first
brought back to Europe, skeptical scientists insisted it was a fake — 
a concoction of several different animals sewn together.
Then there’s the koala. This fluffy marsupial eats virtually indigestible
gum (eucalyptus) leaves and sleeps about 20 hours a day. There’s only
one koala species, although those found in Victoria are much larger than
their brethren in more northern climes. Australia is also famous for kan-
garoos. There are 45 different kinds of kangaroos and wallabies, ranging
from small rat-size kangaroos to the man-size red kangaroos.
The animal you’re most likely to come across in your trip is the possum,
named by Captain James Cook after the North American “opossum,”
which he thought they resembled. (They actually aren’t related at all.)
The brush-tailed possum is commonly found in suburban gardens,
including those in Sydney. Then there’s the wombat. There are four
species of this bulky burrower in Australia, but the common wombat is
most frequently found. You may come across the smaller hairy-nosed
wombat in South Australia and Western Australia.
The dingo, thought by many to be a native of Australia, was, in fact,
introduced — probably by Aborigines or traders from the north. They
Part I: Introducing Australia 
20

vary in color from yellow to a russet red and are despised by farmers.
Commonly seen birds include the fairy penguin along the coast, black
swans, parrots, cockatoos, and honeyeaters. Tasmanian devils can be
found in — you guessed it — the island/state of Tasmania, though a viru-
lent disease has decimated the wild population.
Snakes are common throughout Australia, but you’ll rarely see one. The
most dangerous land snake is the taipan, which hides in the grasslands
in northern Australia. If, by the remotest chance, you’re bitten by a
snake, you must immediately immobilize the limb, wrapping it quite
tightly (but not tight enough to restrict the blood flow) with a cloth or
bandage, and head to the nearest hospital for antivenin.
There are two types of crocodile in Australia: the (relatively) harmless
freshwater croc, which grows to 3m (10 ft.), and the dangerous estuarine
(or saltwater) crocodile, which reaches 5 to 7m (16–23 ft.). Freshwater
crocs eat fish; estuarine crocs aren’t so picky.
Never swim in or stand on the bank of any river, swamp, or pool in
northern Australia unless you know for certain it’s croc-free.
Spiders are common all over Australia, with the funnel web spider and
the red-back spider being the most aggressive. Funnel webs live in holes
in the ground (they spin their webs around the hole’s entrance) and
stand on their back legs when they’re about to attack. Red-backs have a
habit of resting under toilet seats and in car trunks, generally outside
the main cities. Caution is a good policy.
If you go bushwalking, check your body carefully. Ticks are common,
especially in eastern Australia, and can cause severe itching and fever. If
you find one on you, dab it with methylated spirits or another noxious
chemical. Wait a while and pull it out gently with tweezers.
Fish to avoid are stingrays, porcupine fish, stonefish, lionfish, and 
puffer fish. Never touch an octopus if it has blue rings on it, or a cone
shell, and be wary of the painful and sometimes deadly tentacles of 
the box jellyfish along the northern Queensland coast in summer. If 
you happen to brush past one of these creatures, pour vinegar over 
the affected site immediately — local authorities leave bottles of 
vinegar on the beach for this purpose. Vinegar deactivates the stingers
that haven’t already affected you, but doesn’t affect the ones that
already have.
In Sydney, you may come across “stingers” or “blue bottles” as they’re
also called. These long-tentacled blue jellyfish can inflict a nasty sting
that can last for hours. Sometimes you’ll see warning signs on patrolled
beaches. The best remedy if you’re stung is to wash the affected area
with fresh water and have a hot bath or shower.
Chapter 2: Digging Deeper into Australia 21

Meeting the People Down Under
It’s thought that more races of people live in Australia than anywhere
else in the world, including North America. High levels of immigration
have led to people from some 165 nations making the country their
home. In general, relations between the different groups have been
peaceful. Today Australia is an example of a multicultural society,
despite an increasingly vocal minority that believes that Australia has
come too far in welcoming people from races other than their own.
The Aboriginal people
When Cook landed at Botany Bay to claim the land for the British Empire,
at least 300,000 Aborigines were already on the continent. Whether you
believe a version of history that suggests that the Aboriginal people
were descendants of migrants from Indonesia, or the Aboriginal belief
that they have occupied Australia since the beginning of time, there is
scientific evidence that people were here at least 60,000 years ago.
At the time of the white “invasion” of their lands, there were at least 600
different, largely nomadic tribal communities, each linked to their ances-
tral land by sacred sites (certain features of the land, such as hills or
rock formations). They were hunter-gatherers, spending about 20 hours
a week harvesting the resources of the land, rivers, and the ocean. The
rest of the time was taken up by a complex social and belief system, as
well as by life’s practicalities, such as making utensils, weapons, and
musical instruments such as didgeridoos and clapsticks.
The basis of Aboriginal spirituality rests in the Dreamtime stories, in
which spirits created everything — land, stars, mountains, the moon,
the sun, the oceans, water holes, animals, and humans. Much Aboriginal
art is related to their land and the sacred sites that are home to the
Dreamtime spirits.
Dutch records from 1451 show that the Macassans, from islands now
belonging to Indonesia, had a long relationship trading Dutch glass,
pipes, and alcohol, for sea slugs from Australia’s coastal waters, which
they sold to the Chinese. Dutch, Portuguese, French, and Chinese ves-
sels also encountered Australia — in fact, the Dutch fashion for pointy
beards caught on long before the British First Fleet arrived in 1778.
When the British came, bringing their diseases with them, coastal com-
munities were virtually wiped out by smallpox. As late as the 1950s,
large numbers of Aborigines in remote regions succumbed to outbreaks
of influenza and measles.
Although relationships between the settlers and local Aborigines were
initially peaceful, conflicts over land and food soon led to skirmishes in
which Aborigines were massacred and settlers and convicts attacked —
Governor Phillip was speared in the back by an Aborigine in 1790.
Part I: Introducing Australia 
22

Within a few years, some 10,000 Aborigines and 1,000 Europeans had
been killed in Queensland alone, while in Tasmania, a campaign to rid
the island entirely of Aborigines was successful, with the last full-blooded
Tasmanian Aborigine dying in 1876. By the start of the 20th century, the
Aboriginal people were considered a dying race. Most of them lived in
government reservations or church-run missions.
Massacres of Aborigines continued to go largely or wholly unpunished
into the 1920s, by which time it became government policy to remove
light-skinned Aboriginal children from their families and to sterilize
young Aboriginal women. Many children of the “stolen generation” were
brought up in white foster homes or church refuges and never reunited
with their biological families — many children with living parents were
told that their parents were dead.
Today, there are some 283,000 Aborigines living in Australia, and, in 
general, a great divide still exists between them and the rest of the popu-
lation. Aboriginal life expectancy is 20 years lower than that of other
Australians, with overall death rates between two and four times higher.
Aborigines make up the highest percentage of the country’s prison 
population, and many Aborigines die while incarcerated.
A landmark in Aboriginal affairs occurred in 1992 when the High Court
determined that Australia was not an empty land (terra nullius) as it 
had been seen officially since the British arrived. The “Mabo” decision
resulted in the 1993 Native Title Act, which allowed Aboriginal groups,
and the ethnically distinct people in the Torres Strait islands, to claim
government-owned land if they could prove continual association 
with it since 1788. The later “Wik” decision in 1996, determined that
Aborigines could make claims on government land leased to agricultur-
ists. The federal government, led by the right-leaning Prime Minister
John Howard, curtailed these rights under pressure from farming and
mining interests.
Issues currently facing the Aboriginal population include harsh manda-
tory sentencing laws, which came to international attention in 2000.
Added to this was the simmering issue of the federal government’s deci-
sion not to apologize to the Aboriginal people for the “stolen genera-
tion.” In March 2000, a government-sponsored report stated there was
never a “stolen generation,” while independent researchers believed
that the report underestimated how many people were personally
affected.
Before the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games, a popular movement involving
people of all colors and classes called for reconciliation and an apology
to the Aboriginal people. In Sydney, an estimated 250,000 people marched
across the Sydney Harbour Bridge. The Liberal (which in Australia is
actually a conservative party) Government refused to bow to public
pressure. Despite threats of boycotts and rallies during the Olympics,
Chapter 2: Digging Deeper into Australia 23

the Games passed without major disturbance, and a worldwide audience
watched as Aboriginal runner Cathy Freeman lit the Olympic cauldron.
How immigration has changed Australia’s population
“White Australia” was a term used to distinguish the Anglo-Saxon popu-
lation from the Aboriginal population, and until 1974 there existed a
White Australia Policy — a result of conflict between European settlers
and Chinese immigrants in the gold fields in the 1850s. This policy
severely restricted the immigration of people who lacked European
ancestry. These days, though, a walk through any of the major cities
would show that things have changed dramatically.
About 100,000 people immigrate to Australia each year. Of these, the
latest figures state that approximately 18 percent are from New Zealand,
and 10 percent were born in the United Kingdom or Ireland. More than
28 percent hail from Asia, 6 percent from South Africa, and 2 percent
from the United States and Canada.
Waves of immigration have brought in millions of people since the end of
World War II. Results from the 2001 census show that more than 4.1 mil-
lion Australian residents were born overseas — that’s 22 percent of the
population. New waves of immigration have come from countries such
as Iraq and Somalia. So what’s the typical Australian like? Well, he’s
hardly Crocodile Dundee.
Eating and Drinking in Australia
You can thank Australia’s multicultural population for the fantastic cui-
sine developed over the past few decades. The food here is fresh and
the chefs are innovative. Once a land of British-style “meat and three
veg,” Australia is now a place where you can get top-class food in any
cuisine — Italian, Greek, Vietnamese, and other immigrants have seen 
to that.
The fusion of flavors and styles has melded into what’s now commonly
referred to as Contemporary or Modern Australian — a distinctive cuisine
blending the spices of the East with the flavors of the West.
All about Australian wine
Winemaking has come a long way since the first grape vines were
brought to Australia on the First Fleet in 1788. These days, more than
550 major companies and small winemakers produce world-class wines
commercially in Australia. The demand for Australian wine overseas 
has increased so dramatically in the past few years that domestic prices
have risen, and new vineyards are being planted at a frantic pace.
Of the white wines, big favorites include the fruity chardonnay and
Riesling varieties, the herbaceous or grassy sauvignon blanc, and the
Part I: Introducing Australia 
24

dry sémillon. Of the reds, the dry cabernet sauvignon, the fruity merlot,
the burgundy-type pinot noir, and the big and bold Shiraz, which has
taken the world by storm, come out tops. Regions popular with wine-
lovers include the Hunter Valley (New South Wales), the Barossa (South
Australia), and Margaret River (Western Australia).
Australian for “beer,” mate!
An Aussie likes nothing better on a hot day than a cold tinnie (can of
beer). Barbecues would not be the same without a case of tinnies, or
stubbies (small bottles).
Among the most popular Aussie beers are Victoria Bitter (known as VB),
XXXX (pronounced “four-ex”), Fosters, and brews produced by the
Tooheys company. Another popular choice is Cascade, a German-style
beer that you’ll usually find only in a bottle. It’s light in color, strong in
taste, and made from Tasmanian water straight off a mountain. If you
want to get plastered, try Coopers — it’s rather cloudy, very strong, and
can cause a terrific hangover. Most Australian beers range from 4.8 per-
cent to 5.2 percent alcohol.
In New South Wales (NSW), bars serve beer by the glass in a schooner or
a smaller midi — though, in a few places, it’s also served in British meas-
urements, by pints and half pints. In Victoria you should ask for a pot or
the smaller glass. In South Australia, a schooner is the size of a NSW
midi, and in Western Australia a midi is the same size as a New South
Wales midi, but a glass about half its size is called a pony. Confused? The
easiest way to order is to point out the size you want.

Deciding When and 
Where to Go

 Discovering Australia’s major cities and regions

 Checking out Australia’s calendar of events
A
ustralia is a big country! Where do you start? For most people, it’s
Sydney. But Australia has much to offer, and after coming such a
long way, you want to see as much as possible, even if your time is
short. That said, trying to cram too much into your visit is a big mistake.
You’re better off settling on a couple of places and seeing them properly.
Wherever you choose to explore, you’ll have plenty to do; even small
towns have a surprising amount to see. This chapter gives you the high-
lights of each region and lists the country’s main events so you can work
out the best time and place for your visit.
Going Everywhere You Want to Be
This book — of necessity — gives only the highlights of Australia. Cover-
ing it all is impossible. We concentrate on the major destinations, but we
also tell you about the gems that abound in every part of the country.
Yes, go to the Sydney Opera House and the Great Barrier Reef, but if you
can, see some of the lesser-known attractions and meet the locals.
Most Australians live in coastal towns and cities, and it’s in these that
you’ll likely stay. That said, getting into the Outback, which every state
and territory has to some degree, is worth the effort. For many people,
this is the “real” Australia — or at least one of the stereotypes. It shows
you a side of Australia you won’t see in the cities — both in the land-
scape and in the people.

Australia is blessed with one of the greatest natural attractions in the
world: the Great Barrier Reef. It also has rain forests, mountains, wild-
flowers, wine country, fantastic scenic drives, bird-filled wetlands, and
countless beautiful beaches.
Australia consists of six states — New South Wales (NSW), Queensland
(QLD), Victoria (VIC), South Australia (SA), Western Australia (WA), and
Tasmania (TAS) — and two internal territories, the Australian Capital
Territory (ACT) and the Northern Territory (NT). The national capital is
Canberra, in the ACT. We cover them all and hope that the following out-
line will help you decide which ones you want to visit.
Sydney and New South Wales
Most tourists come to Australia to see Sydney, and there’s no denying
it’s one of the most spectacularly located cities in the world. Right on
Sydney Harbour, with the iconic Opera House and Harbour Bridge
framing the vast expanse of water, with dozens of harbor and ocean
beaches in and around it, Sydney is hard to beat! It’s also a good base for
day trips or overnight excursions inland, especially to the scenic Blue
Mountains and the wineries of the Hunter Valley.
A string of pretty beachside towns stretches down the southern coast 
of New South Wales to Victoria. North of Sydney is remnant rain forest
and a more tropical air in the laid-back hangout of Byron Bay.
Inland highlights include the mining town of Broken Hill (known for
wildlife, art galleries, and Aboriginal influences), and Outback opal-
mining towns White Cliffs and Lightning Ridge, which exist in a wacky
underground world of their own.
Melbourne and Victoria
Don’t try to compare Melbourne with Sydney. There’s an old rivalry
between Australia’s two largest cities, but they’re worlds apart. Melbourne,
the capital of Victoria, is more stately and old-world. It offers an excit-
ing mix of ethnicities and the country’s best fashion shopping. Victoria
is also the site of one of Australia’s great road trips, the Great Ocean
Road, which stretches for 106km (66 miles) along the southern coast.
Then there’s the inland High Country, the stamping ground of the 
title character in Banjo Paterson’s 1890 poem “The Man from Snowy
River.”
Canberra and the Australian Capital Territory
Surrounded by New South Wales is the Australian Capital Territory
(ACT), home to the national capital, Canberra. A planned city similar 
in architectural concept to Washington, D.C., Canberra is surrounded 
by bushland and is home to some of the country’s best national 
museums.

Brisbane, Queensland, and the Great Barrier Reef
Brisbane is a fun city to stay in and explore, as well as a great jumping-
off point for the Great Barrier Reef, which stretches more than 2,000km
(1,240 miles) along the coast. Alluring island resorts dot the coast —
most rather expensive, but worth the money.
Queensland is also known for its lovely white-sand beaches. Many of the
best and most accessible strands are on the Gold Coast in the state’s
south (about an hour’s drive from the state capital, Brisbane), and the
Sunshine Coast (a two-hour drive north of Brisbane).
Cairns and Port Douglas in the far north have their fair share of beaches,
too, but swimming in their waters can be very hazardous to your health
because deadly box jellyfish, or stingers, inhabit them from October
through May, when you should stick to the waterfront lagoons at Airlie
Beach and Cairns, or to your hotel pool. The jellyfish are mainly found in
coastal waters and do not interfere with Great Barrier Reef activities like
snorkeling or diving. Island swimming is mostly stinger-free, but be care-
ful and ask a lifeguard before plunging into that inviting water.
Among the most appealing of Queensland’s destinations are the 74
Whitsunday Islands in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. These mostly
uninhabited islands are a paradise for sailing, as well as kayaking, snor-
keling, diving, fishing, hiking, and bird-watching.
Another big attraction is the lush 110-million-year-old Daintree
Rainforest, north of Port Douglas.
The Red Centre
The majestic presence of Uluru, also known as Ayers Rock, is what
draws everyone to the ocher sands of the Red Centre, the heart of the
Northern Territory. Many visitors discover that the lesser-known nearby
domes of Kata Tjuta, or “the Olgas,” are even more spectacular. A half-
day’s drive from the Rock brings you to Kings Canyon, a spectacular
desert gorge. If you visit the Red Centre, try to spend at least a few days
in Alice Springs, a laid-back Outback town with much to offer. It has
Aboriginal arts and crafts, Aboriginal tours, a world-class desert wildlife
park, hiking through the stark MacDonnell Ranges, and camel rides
along a dry riverbed.
The Top End
The northwest reaches of the country encompass what Aussies call 
the Top End. This is a remote, vast, semidesert region where the cattle
probably outnumber the people. The tropical city of Darwin is the
Territory’s capital. A few hours’ drive will bring you to Kakadu National
Park, where you can cruise past crocodiles on inland billabongs (ponds),
bird-watch, and visit ancient Aboriginal rock-art sites.

Chapter 3: Deciding When and Where to Go 31
Perth and Western Australia
Making it to Western Australia, one of Australia’s most wild and beautiful
regions, is worth the trouble. The seas teem with whales in season, and
thrill-seekers can swim alongside gigantic but gentle whale sharks on the
Northwest Cape every fall (Mar–June). The state’s capital, Perth, has
surf beaches. Nearby is the restored 19th-century port of Fremantle. In
the southwest is the Margaret River wine region, punctuated by wild
forests, thundering surf, cliffs, rich bird life, and kangaroos.
Adelaide and South Australia
Lying between Western Australia and Victoria is South Australia. The
stately capital, Adelaide, is known for its conservatism, parks, and
churches. It is an ideal base for exploring Australia’s illustrious wine
region, the Barossa Valley, dotted with big-name winemakers such as
Penfolds, Seppelts, and Wolf Blass, all less than an hour from the city!
The greatest of South Australia’s attractions — apart from wine — is
Kangaroo Island, a place alive with native animals: wallabies, kanga-
roos, echidnas, koalas, sea lions and all sorts of birds, from black swans
to kookaburras to penguins.
Tasmania
Last stop before Antarctica! Australia’s lovely island state is best known
for its beautiful national parks, expanses of alpine wilderness, ancient
forests, and magnificent trout fishing. The capital is Hobart, a former
penal town. If you’re up for it, you could tackle the Overland Track, an
85km (53-mile) hiking trail between Cradle Mountain and Lake St. Clair
that passes through highland moors, dense rain forests, and several
mountains. A more leisurely option is a visit to the stone ruins of Port
Arthur, where thousands of convicts brought in to settle the new British
colony were imprisoned and died. All of Tasmania is spectacular, but
you haven’t seen anything until you’ve experienced Freycinet National
Park, with its pink granite outcrops set against an emerald-green sea.
Scheduling Your Time
When planning your trip to Australia, keep reminding yourself that this
is a huge continent with long distances between many major attractions.
Australia is as big as Western Europe and about the same land mass as
the 48 contiguous states of the United States. You’ll most likely start
your trip in Sydney, and from there it’s a long day’s drive (or two) to
either Brisbane in the north or Melbourne to the south; Western
Australia is a week’s drive from Sydney!
Take into account how much time you have, and then prioritize your
sightseeing. Remember: Even some domestic flights can take three

Part I: Introducing Australia 
32
hours (or more if you’re going west), so don’t try to do too much or
you’ll be exhausted. The better your planning, the more you’ll enjoy
your discovery of the best Australia has to offer.
Revealing the Secrets of the Seasons
Keep in mind that, when it’s summer in the Northern Hemisphere, it’s
winter Down Under. So the peak travel season in the most popular parts
of Australia is the Southern Hemisphere winter (June–Aug). Happily, 
airfares to Australia offered by U.S. airlines are usually lowest from mid-
April to late August — the best time to visit the Red Centre, the Top End,
and the Great Barrier Reef.
In much of the country — Queensland from around Townsville and
northward, all of the Top End and the Red Centre, and most of Western
Australia — the most pleasant time to travel is April through September,
when daytime temperatures are 66°F to 88°F (19°C–31°C) and it rarely
rains. June, July, and August are the busiest months in these parts; you’ll
need to book accommodations and tours well in advance, and you’ll pay
higher rates then, too.
Australia’s summer is a nice time to visit the southern states — New
South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, Western Australia from Perth to
the south, and Tasmania. Even in winter, temperatures rarely dip below
freezing, and snow falls only in parts of Tasmania, in the ski fields of
Victoria, and in the Snowy Mountains of southern New South Wales.
The best months to visit Australia are September and October, when it’s
often still warm enough to enjoy the southern states, it’s cool enough to
tour Uluru (Ayers Rock), the wildflowers are in full bloom in Western
Australia, and the humidity and rains have not come to Cairns and the
Top End (although it will be very hot by Oct).
In summer (Oct–Mar), you can expect it to be hot, humid, and wet (or 
all three) if you’re touring the Red Centre, the Top End, and Western
Australia except Perth and the southwest. The Top End, the Kimberley,
and North Queensland, including Cairns, are intensely hot and humid 
in the Wet season from November or December through March or April.
In the Top End and Kimberley, the Wet season is preceded by a sticky
build-up period in October and November. Some attractions close, flood-
waters render others off-limits, and hotels drop their rates, often dra-
matically. So if you decide to travel in these areas at this time — and lots
of people do — be prepared to take the heat, possible floods, and, in
tropical coastal areas, the slight chance of cyclones.
Australia’s summer holidays run from about mid-December to the end 
of January, when schools close and families head off on their vacations.
Book well ahead if you’re traveling then. The school year in Australia is

usually broken into four semesters, with two-week holidays around
Easter, the last week of June and the first week of July, and the last week
of September and the first week of October.
Perusing a Calendar of Events
Almost everything shuts down on Good Friday, Christmas Day, and
Boxing Day (Dec 26), and much is closed January 1, Easter Sunday, and
Easter Monday. Most establishments close until 1 p.m., if not all day, on
Anzac Day (Apr 25), a World War I commemorative day.

April
Anzac Day is Australia’s national day of mourning for servicepeople
who have died in wars and conflict. It is a public holiday, but many
attractions open in the afternoon. Moving services are held around the
country, even in the smallest towns. Some are held at dawn, others later
in the morning. Wreaths are laid in memory of the dead, from World War
I onward. In major cities, there is usually a public parade of returned 
servicepeople through the streets. Huge crowds turn out to honor 
them. April 25.

two weeks from the first or second Friday in June.
July
The quirky Imparja Camel Cup (% 08/8952 6796; www.camelcup.
com.au), held each year in Alice Springs, may be a nightmare for the
riders, but it’s great entertainment for spectators. Nine camel races are
held around the dusty outback track throughout the day, with other
entertainment including belly dancers, rickshaw rides, and more. 
Mid-July.
August
Sydneysiders by the thousands pound the pavement in the 14km 
(8 3/4-mile) City to Surf “fun run” from the city to Bondi Beach. For

On the first Tuesday of November, Australia stops to watch its most
famous horse race, the Melbourne Cup. Those who are not actually 
at Melbourne’s Flemington racecourse to watch the A$3.5-million
(US$2.8-million/£1.4-million) race, are glued to the TV or radio! It’s 
a public holiday in Melbourne. For tickets, contact Ticketmaster
(% 1300/136 122 in Australia; www.ticketmaster.com.au); for infor-
mation, visit www.vrc.net.au.

Chapter 4
Following an Itinerary: 
Four Great Options
by Marc Llewellyn and Lee Mylne
In This Chapter
 Seeing Australia’s top attractions in one or two weeks
 Visiting Australia with kids
 Tasting wines and smelling the wildflowers in Western Australia
P
lanning a trip to Australia is a daunting task, simply because of 
the distances you have to cover. For visitors from the Northern
Hemisphere, it’s a long way to come for just a week, but if that’s all you
can spare, you still want to see as much as possible. Our inclination is to
immerse ourselves in one spot and soak it up, but we know that not
everyone wants to do that. Seeing as much as you can is often a priority,
especially when you’ve invested so much in getting here.
First-time visitors, with a week or two to explore, may find the first
couple of itineraries most helpful. We’ve put together some suggestions
for seeing the best of Australia in one or two weeks. You can, of course,
fiddle with them to suit your own interests — for example, you could
substitute the Cairns section of the one-week itinerary for the Uluru/Red
Centre days in the two-week itinerary, flying from Sydney to Uluru.
If you’ve been to Australia, or you’ve already visited Sydney, the Great
Barrier Reef, or Uluru (Ayers Rock), you may want explore places a little
more off the beaten track. If you’re bringing the young ones, our itiner-
ary for traveling with kids may give you some ideas for the kids (without
forgetting the parents).
Getting around this vast continent, where the major attractions are thou-
sands of miles apart, is time-consuming. Flying is the only way to cover
long distances efficiently, but it can also be expensive. Remember to
allow flying time in your itineraries and don’t try to pack too much in on
the days you fly — even domestic flights can be around three hours and
can be quite draining.

Our best tip is this: If the pace gets too hectic, just chill out and reorder
your sightseeing priorities. Take time to meet the locals and ask their
advice on what you should see as well. Australia is complex and fasci-
nating place, and in a week or two you’ll only just scratch the surface of
everything it can offer.
Seeing Australia’s Highlights in One Week
Careful planning will maximize the number of things you can see in a
short time, but try not to overschedule yourself. Concentrate on a few
things — perhaps one city and/or one of the natural wonders — and
you’ll go home having had a memorable time. Australians are a laid-back
lot, generally, and in many places the pace is relaxed.
Use this one-week itinerary to make the most of a short time. One week
provides barely enough time to see the best of Sydney, which for most
people is their first stop. Your spectacular introduction to the city may
well be from the window of your plane as you fly over the Sydney
Harbour Bridge and the Opera House.
If you have only a week and want to head farther afield, there are two
main choices, depending on your interests. The Great Barrier Reef is a
“must” for divers, but don’t forget that you must allow time on either
side of your reef trip for flying (you can’t fly within 24 hours of scuba
diving). There are no such problems with Australia’s other icon, Uluru
(Ayers Rock), in the heart of the Red Centre. This well-travelled triangle
of Sydney–Cairns–Uluru gives you a complete Australian experience.
On Day One, check into your Sydney hotel and start the jetlag-recovery
process. If you arrive in the morning and have a full day ahead of you,
try to stay up and hit the nearest cafe for a shot of caffeine to keep you
going. Head to Circular Quay, where you’ll have a fantastic view of
Sydney Harbour Bridge. Then stroll over to the Sydney Opera House
and soak up some history at The Rocks. If you have time, you can take
the ferry from Circular Quay to Manly beach to round off a fairly relaxed
day with fish and chips, and then get some much-needed sleep.
Start Day Two with a ride to the top of the Sydney Tower to experience
Sydney’s highest attraction, Skywalk, a breathtaking 260 meters (853 ft.)
above the city. Harnessed onto a moving, glass-floored viewing platform
that extends out over the edge of the tower, you can view it all — the
Harbour Bridge, Opera House, Sydney Harbour, all the way to the Blue
Mountains. It’s not as scary as it sounds. Sydney Tower has several
attractions, including OzTrek — a simulator ride the kids will love.
Then head to Taronga Zoo or the Sydney Aquarium for an introduction
to Australia’s wildlife. If you enjoy museums, put the Australia Museum,
the Australian National Maritime Museum at Darling Harbour, or the
Powerhouse Museum on your list. To learn more about Sydney’s origins
Chapter 4: Following an Itinerary: Four Great Options 37

as a convict settlement, visit the Hyde Park Barracks Museum, a 
convict-built prison. Finish off your day with a twilight (or later on 
weekends) Bridge Climb or take the kids to Luna Park, a small tradi-
tional amusement park that’s at its best when lit up at night.
On Day Three, take a day trip to the Blue Mountains. Take the train
from Sydney’s Central Station to Katoomba, two hours from Sydney.
Then jump on the Blue Mountains Explorer Bus, which allows you to
hop on and off wherever you please. There are also many day tours 
leaving from Sydney. Don’t miss the spectacular Three Sisters rock for-
mations, best viewed from Echo Point Road at Katoomba. If you’re
adventurous, you may want to take a tour from Katoomba to the
Jenolan Caves, about a 90-minute drive southwest. Head back to 
Sydney and have dinner somewhere with a view of the harbor.
On Day Four, take the earliest flight you can from Sydney to Cairns to
begin your discovery of the Great Barrier Reef. Flight time is three
hours, which will wipe out most of your morning. On arrival, check into
a hotel in the city center, which, on such a tight schedule, will make get-
ting to the major attractions quicker and easier than staying on the
northern beaches. Explore the city a little and see some wildlife —
including a massive saltwater crocodile — in the bizarre setting of the
Cairns Rainforest Dome, atop the Hotel Sofitel Reef Casino. You’ll have
time the rest of the day to head out to visit the Tjapukai Aboriginal
Cultural Park. If you aren’t going to the Red Centre, this is a great place
to learn about Aboriginal culture and life, albeit in a theme-park way. You
could also save the visit for the evening, when Tjapukai by Night tours
give a different look at traditional ceremonies, including dinner and a
fire-and-water outdoor show.
On Day Five, take a day trip to the Great Barrier Reef. Tour boats leave
from the Reef Fleet Terminal, and the trip to the outer reef takes about
two hours. After you’re there, you’ll spend your day on a pontoon with
about 300 people (or in the water!). Experienced divers may prefer to
take a day trip with one of the dive charter companies that take smaller
groups and visit two or three reefs. The pontoons of the big operators
also offer the chance to take a scenic flight — a spectacular experience.
Divers must spend another 24 hours in Cairns before flying. If you’re
content to snorkel, ride the glass-bottom boats, and soak up the sun,
you can fly out the next day. Back in Cairns, take a stroll along the
Esplanade and eat at one of the busy cafes and restaurants that line 
the strip.
If you can’t fly on Day Six consider a trip to the rain forest. Head for the
mountain village of Kuranda aboard the steam train along the Kuranda
Scenic Railway, past waterfalls and gorges. In Kuranda, explore the mar-
kets and the nature parks, and maybe take a Kuranda Riverboat Tour,
which runs about 45 minutes. Make your return journey on the Skyrail
cableway, which carries you over the rain forest (you can get to ground
level at a couple of stations on the way) to the edge of Cairns, and pro-
vides sensational views of the coast and mountains.
Part I: Introducing Australia 
38

Or, you could head to the World Heritage–listed Daintree Rainforest,
two hours’ drive north of Cairns. Many tour operators, including Port
Douglas–based Heritage & Interpretive Tours, run day tours into the
Daintree and Cape Tribulation national parks. If you’re exploring on your
own, make time for a one-hour cruise on the Daintree River with Dan
Irby’s Mangrove Adventures, where you’ll travel in a small open boat
and see lots of fascinating wildlife.
If you choose the Daintree option, overnight in the lovely resort town of
Port Douglas and head to one of its great restaurants — Salsa Bar &
Grill has a relaxed and lively atmosphere, and terrific food.
Unless you have a flight directly out of Cairns, you’ll spend most of Day
Seven, your last day in Australia, returning to Sydney. With the time you
have left, treat yourself to dinner at a restaurant overlooking the harbor,
with its bridge and the Opera House illuminated — it’s a sight you’ll
always remember.
Seeing More of Australia in Two Weeks
You can make your visit much more relaxed if you have two weeks to
spend. In two weeks, you have time to see all three icons — Sydney, the
Great Barrier Reef, and Uluru — in more depth, and maybe even have
time to go outside those areas if you see just two of the “Big Three.”
For the first week, follow the itinerary in the preceding section. But
instead of catching a plane from Cairns back to Sydney, on Day Seven
take a flight to Uluru (Ayers Rock).
Leave Cairns as early as you can (this will probably mean spending the
night in Cairns rather than Port Douglas). Your flight to Ayers Rock
Airport will take around three hours or more. Make sure you book a
direct flight, and not one that goes via Sydney! And make sure you
remember to ask for a window seat, because the views as you fly over
the Outback will be like nothing you’ve seen before.
If you take the early flight, you can be in Uluru by around 9 a.m., which
gives you the whole day to take in the enormity of this fabulous mono-
lith. Take the shuttle from Ayers Rock Resort to the Rock. If you decide
to climb Uluru (remembering that the Aboriginal traditional owners
would prefer you didn’t), make sure you don’t do it at the hottest time of
day. A climb will take you between two and four hours, depending on
your fitness. An alternative is to join Anangu Tours for a walk around it;
one of the best is the late-afternoon Kuniya walk, which concludes with
watching sunset over Uluru — an unforgettable sight. Spend some time
in the impressive and interesting Uluru-Kata Tjuta Cultural Centre near
the base of Uluru. And after doing all that in a day, you’ll be ready for a
quiet dinner at whatever hotel you’ve chosen to stay in.
Chapter 4: Following an Itinerary: Four Great Options 39

Make the effort to get up for sunrise on Day Eight. This is one of the
most magic times at Uluru, and is also a great time to do the 9.6km 
(6-mile) Base Walk circumnavigating Uluru, which takes two to three
hours. There are a range of other ways to experience Uluru, including
camel rides, Harley-Davidson tours, and helicopter joy-flights, but walk-
ing up close to the Rock beats them all, in our opinion. You’ll also have
time on Day Eight to head to Kata Tjuta (also called the Olgas) where
you’ll see that there is much more to the Red Centre than just one Rock.
Kata Tjuta is about 48km (30 miles) west of Uluru, but plenty of tours go
there if you don’t have your own wheels. End your day in the desert with
the Sounds of Silence dinner, run by Ayers Rock Resort. Sip champagne
as the sun sets over Uluru, to the eerie music of the didgeridoo, then
tuck into kangaroo, barramundi, and other native foods. But it’s not the
food you’re here for — it’s the silence and the stars. A short stargazing
session with an astronomer ends a memorable evening.
On Day Nine, rent a four-wheel-drive and tackle the trip from Uluru to
Alice Springs, stopping for a night at Kings Canyon. It is 306km (190
miles) from Uluru to Kings Canyon (also known as Watarrka National
Park), which offers another unbeatable look at Outback Australia. You
can spend the afternoon walking up the canyon and around the rim. It’s
very steep, and it’ll take you around four hours. A gentler walk is the
short and shady canyon floor walk. Stay over at the Kings Canyon
Resort.
On Day Ten, start out early for Alice Springs, and take the unpaved but
interesting Mereenie Loop Road, which leads you through the Glen
Helen Gorge or the historic Hermannsburg mission settlement.
Whichever road you take, the scenery is like nowhere else in Australia.
You’ll probably spend most of the day driving to Alice.
On arrival, check into a hotel and head out to one of the local restau-
rants, several of which offer sophisticated versions of bush tucker
including kangaroo, emu, and crocodile dishes.
If you can stand another early start, on Day 11, take a dawn balloon
flight over the desert, usually followed by a champagne breakfast. If you
don’t head back to bed for a few hours of catch-up sleep, there are
plenty of attractions, including the Alice Springs Desert Park for a look
at some unusual Australian creatures, the School of the Air, and the
Royal Flying Doctor Service base. In the afternoon, take a half-day tour
with an Aboriginal guide at the Aboriginal Art & Culture Centre.
Alternatively, visit the Alice Springs Telegraph Station Historical
Reserve set in an oasis just outside town for a look at early settler life.
Finish the day with a sunset camel ride down the dry Todd River bed
and have dinner at the camel farm.
On Day 12, fly back to Sydney. Direct flights from Alice Springs to
Sydney leave in the early afternoon, so you have all morning to explore
more of the town and perhaps buy some Aboriginal art. On arrival in
Part I: Introducing Australia 
40

Sydney after an almost three-hour flight, check into your hotel and
spend the night discovering some of the city’s nightlife.
On Day 13, hit Sydney’s famous beach, Bondi. Take the Bondi Explorer
bus from Circular Quay, which gives you a choice of harbor-side bays
and coastal beaches, or take the train to Bondi Junction and then a 
bus to the beach. Spend the day lazing on the sand or — in summer, at
least — taking a dip in the surf. For the more energetic, the scenic cliff-
top walk to Bronte Beach, or further on to Coogee, is worth doing.
Spend Day 14 doing that last-minute shopping or seeing the Sydney
sights you haven’t had time for so far. Round it off with a fabulous
seafood dinner somewhere with a fantastic view of the Harbour Bridge.
Discovering Australia with Kids
Australia is an unbelievable destination for kids — and not just for the
kangaroos and koalas that almost every child (and parent!) wants to see.
Our suggestion is to explore Sydney for two days with family in tow, and
then head up to the Blue Mountains on a day trip to ride the cable car
and the world’s steepest railway. The climax comes with a few days
exploring the Barrier Reef and the rain forest around Port Douglas.
On Day One, first off, head to Circular Quay to see the Sydney Opera
House. A tour inside may be a bit much for younger kids, but you can
walk around it. Go from here to the Royal Botanic Gardens to spot hun-
dreds of fruit bats squabbling among the treetops. After lunch, take a
ferry to Taronga Zoo. All the kids’ favorites are here, from kangaroos
and koalas to platypuses. A farmyard section edges onto a playground of
sorts with lots of water features to give your kids a sprinkle on a hot day.
On Day Two head to Sydney Tower, then on to Sydney Aquarium,
where huge sharks swim right above your head.
On Day Three, take a day trip to the Blue Mountains. Several companies
run tour buses to the area, stopping off at an animal park along the way.
The best one is Featherdale, where you can get up close to kangaroos,
koalas, and Tasmanian devils. The tour will also stop at Scenic World,
where you can take the short ride on the Scenic Railway. It’s very steep,
so hold on tight. At the bottom you’ll find yourselves in an ancient tree
fern forest — it’s remarkable. A short walk takes you to the Skyway, a
cable car that goes 300m (984 ft.) above the Jamison Valley.
Now it’s time to head north, up the Tropics. On Day Four, you need to
fly to your Queensland destination, because it would take you several
days to drive up the coast. Most people base themselves in Port
Douglas rather than Cairns, because the beach is huge and uncrowded
and some of the best trips originate from here. On Day Five, it’s time to
visit the Reef. Cruise boats take around 90 minutes to get from Port
Douglas to the outer Reef, but after you’re there, you’re in for some
Chapter 4: Following an Itinerary: Four Great Options 41

amazing snorkeling. On Day Six, head (slightly) inland to explore
Daintree National Park and the Cape Tribulation Rainforests. Usually
included in the tour is a boat trip among the local crocodiles.
On Day Seven, you fly back to Sydney, and if you have time, take the
kids by ferry to Luna Park, or walk there across the Harbour Bridge. The
fun park is small, with a few rides suitable for younger kids, but it does
boast a magnificent view across to the Harbour Bridge and Opera House,
which look glorious after the sun’s gone down.
Wining and Dining (and Wildflowers) in
Margaret River, Western Australia
Getting to see more of Australia than its most famous icons and the East
Coast beaches is not always easy. But if you have the time, there are
many wonderful places off the beaten track, which will give another
dimension to your image and memories of Australia. Here, we suggest a
few days in the Margaret River region, a few hours’ drive south of the
Western Australia capital, Perth. You can add it on to the end of a week
or so in the east, or change it with the latter part of the one- or two-week
itineraries earlier in this chapter. You can fly to Western Australia from
any of the other destinations, and you should fly, because it’s a week’s
drive from Sydney to Perth!
Each year from August to mid-November, the southern half of Western
Australia is blessed with a carpet of 12,000 species of white, yellow,
mauve, pink, red, and blue wildflowers. Wildflower shows and festivals
in country towns throughout the state accompany the annual blossom-
ing. September and October are the peak months.
Starting from the pleasant, sunny city of Perth, you can tailor your trek
to take in some great beaches and surfing, winery tours, excellent food
and wine, and the chance to see kangaroos, whales, and dolphins.
Spend Day One in Perth, which has a superb climate, a great setting on
the Swan River, a fabulous outdoor life of biking and beaches, excellent
restaurants, and a historic port, Fremantle. If you’d like to spend a 
day or so recovering from jet lag as well as getting to know the city, you
can overnight here before taking off on your exploration of Western
Australia. A relaxing way to spend the day is at the port of Fremantle,
about 19km (12 miles) southwest of Perth at the mouth of the Swan
River.
“Freo” is a bustling district of 150 National Trust buildings, alfresco
cafes, museums, galleries, pubs, markets, and shops in a masterfully pre-
served historical atmosphere. It’s still a working port, so you’ll see con-
tainer ships and fishing boats unloading, and yachts gliding in and out of
Part I: Introducing Australia 
42

the harbor. It’s a favorite destination for Perth’s population every week-
end, resulting in a wonderful hubbub of shoppers, merchants, cappuc-
cino drinkers, tourists, and fishermen. You can enjoy the parade as you
knock back a beer or two on the veranda of a gorgeous old pub.
On Day Two, a leisurely four-hour drive southwest from Perth will put
you on the edge of the vineyards of Margaret River, one of Australia’s
finest and most scenic wine regions. En route, stop off at the town of
Bunbury, where you may be lucky enough to see the wild dolphins,
which regularly come in to “play” with visitors. The area is compact, so
you can make your base at any of the boutique lodges or B&Bs. You can
then take your choice from around 80 wineries, as well as numerous gal-
leries and many gourmet produce outlets. Eat at one of the excellent
local restaurants — perhaps try one of the local specialties, marron (a
freshwater crustacean) or venison, with a bottle of Margaret River wine.
Spend Day Three traveling the winding country roads of the southwest
“hook” of Western Australia. Prevelly, west of Margaret River, has some
of Australia’s best surfing. You can follow Caves Road south to Augusta
to the historic lighthouse at Cape Leeuwin, where the Indian and
Southern oceans meet. Augusta is one of the best places in the south to
see migrating whales (both humpback and southern right) in season —
with tours available. Your trip will take you through stands of massive
karri and jarrah trees. Don’t miss Boranup Drive, a scenic detour that
cuts through a magnificent karri forest. For the adventurous, there is a
maze of caves, some of which are open to the public. Have lunch at one
of the winery restaurants or picnic in their lovely gardens. Wind your
way back to your accommodations, with the car stocked with some new
favorite wines to drink or take home, as well as local cheeses, olive oil,
and perhaps some craftwork.
On Day Four, head to the area north of Margaret River town for the
biggest concentration of wineries including some of Australia’s big
names, as well as the Margaret River Chocolate Company. Caves Road
runs north from here, heading for Dunsborough and Cape Naturaliste.
Don’t hurry along the tree-lined country roads; take time to explore
some of the local galleries and enjoy the scenery. At Yallingup, you
swing northeast for Dunsborough, where — between September and
November — you can do more whale-watching. Another stop on your
way back to Perth should be at the seaside town of Busselton, where a
visit to the underwater observatory at the end of the longest timber
jetty in the Southern Hemisphere is well worthwhile.

with the practical side of traveling Down Under.
In Chapter 5, there are tips on how to budget for your trip and
what things cost. Chapter 6 helps you to get there, and deal
with your jet lag once you land; it also offers some sugges-

ustralia is not a hugely expensive destination, once you get there.
But it is far away from pretty much everywhere in the Northern
Hemisphere, and you’ll probably find the airfare to be your largest single
expense. That said, Australia’s exchange rate is a bonus for American
and British visitors — although fluctuations mean you can never be sure
just how much of a bonus it’ll be.
Planning Your Budget
You know what’s most important to you to make your trip a success. 
Do you want to stay in luxury hotels or resorts, or are you just as happy
in more modest accommodations? Takeout or sit-down? Will your
photos be your favorite souvenirs, or do you want to take home some
Aboriginal art? All these factors will determine your total budget and
how you allocate it. In this section, we give you an idea of your major
expenses and offer some ideas on how to save money in each area.
Transportation
Australia is a long haul from pretty much everywhere. This means that
the cost of getting here will probably take the largest chunk of your
budget.
Many airlines fly to Australia from the United States and Europe, most of
them via Asia. Consider a stopover along the way, so you arrive ready to
hit the ground running. (In Chapter 6, we discuss airline options and
give some tips on finding deals.)

When you get to Australia, you can choose to travel around most cities
by public transport. Outside of the cities, you can use a combination of
air, rail, and road to see the things that interest you most.
When traveling from region to region, the fastest way of getting around
this vast continent is to fly. Qantas offers travelers from the United
States a great deal with the Aussie AirPass, which allows you to fly to
more than one Australian city for much less than you would pay for indi-
vidual domestic airfares. (For more information on the Aussie AirPass,
check out Chapter 7.)
Trains can take you the length of the eastern coast, and even across the
Nullarbor Plain to Perth, and between Adelaide in South Australia and
Darwin in the Northern Territory — a great Outback journey. Rail passes
can also help save on your travel. A range of passes is available from
Rail Australia, through its overseas agents, as well as from Great
Southern Railway and Queensland’s Traveltrain. (See Chapter 7 for
details on travel in Queensland.)
Driving gives you flexibility to plan your journey as you go — stopping
wherever you fancy, getting away from major routes, and seeing some of
the country’s lesser-known attractions that may not be as accessible via
public transit. But gasoline is somewhat more expensive in Australia
than in the United States and Canada, so it’s something you’ll have to
build into your budget (on the bright side, for visitors from Great Britain
and Europe, gasoline is much cheaper than at home), and there are addi-
tional driving challenges: In addition to having to drive on the left-hand
side of the road (an unfamiliar experience for North Americans, not so
much for Brits), when you’re driving in the Outback, you run the risk of
hitting kangaroos or breaking down far from anyone who can help.
Lodging
Whether you’re looking for the ultimate in 5-star luxury or a budget
backpacker’s hostel, you can find it in Australia. A huge range of accom-
modations is available, and prices vary widely. The cost varies even
more depending on your location — for example, Sydney and Melbourne
prices will be well above those in a regional or country town in Western
Australia, for the same quality. Tourist hot spots like Cairns and the
Whitsunday Islands charge top price during their busy seasons.
Australia has a star rating system for hotels and motels, and we outline
what you can expect for your stars in Chapter 8.
If you prefer a more personal experience, sometimes for less than the
cost of a hotel room, you’ll be glad to know that Australia has lots of
bed-and-breakfasts (B&Bs). Aussie B&Bs are more likely to be upmarket
places, with lots of amenities, almost on the level of a boutique hotel —
quite a distance from their traditional origins as extra rooms in family
homes. Another great way to get an inside look at how Australians live

for not a great amount of money is to spend time on a farmstay, which
gives you a taste of rural life.
Serviced apartments are very popular, and you can find agencies that
manage and rent them all over the country. They provide much more
space for your money than single hotel rooms. In a serviced apartment,
you’ll have furnished accommodations, including linens and maid serv-
ice. If you’re traveling with your family, you’ll value that, along with a full
kitchen. Even if you only make breakfast, you’ll save a bundle on food
costs.
In major cities, you’re most likely to get deals at hotels on weekends,
when business travelers go home. Wherever you are, ask about deals or
packages that include tours or other extras.
Dining
Australia’s multicultural population is reflected in the variety of cuisines
available all over the country. In most places — with a few backwater
exceptions, perhaps — you’ll find food that is fresh, innovative, and
tasty. In most places, you’ll find good-value eats, especially in ethnic
cuisines.
Check out the many farmer’s markets in major cities and regional cen-
ters for fresh produce. You may be able to buy the ingredients for
money-saving picnics or meals you can prepare in your kitchenette.
Sydney and Melbourne vie for top honors in the restaurant trade. In
both cities, you’ll have trouble choosing among the many fabulous
restaurants — in all price ranges — on offer. Ask the locals for their rec-
ommendations, and browse our suggestions in those chapters.
To complement your dining, try some of Australia’s great wines. More
than 550 major companies and small winemakers produce wine in
Australia, and many have an international reputation for quality. Many
good wines are available at reasonable prices in bottle shops and dis-
count wholesalers.
In restaurants, you’ll pay much more for a bottle, but you can save
money by looking for restaurants with a BYO (short for bring your own)
policy, though there may be a corkage fee.
Sightseeing
Sightseeing is not part of your travel where we recommend you cut cor-
ners. See what you want to see, and be prepared to pay whatever it
costs; these things are what you’ll remember long after you’ve forgotten
what your hotel room was like.
Many of Australia’s greatest sights are free: Sydney Harbour, the fabu-
lous beaches, walks, gardens, and many art galleries, including the
Chapter 5: Managing Your Money 49

National Gallery of Victoria in Melbourne and the National Gallery of
Australia in Canberra.
Of course, if you want to see the Great Barrier Reef, you’ll have to pay a
fairly hefty price to get to it. Most day trips cost between A$150 and
A$200 (US$120–US$160/£60–£80 per person per day, up to around
A$1,400 (US$1,100/£560) per person if you’re overnighting on the reef 
on a live-aboard cruise.
At Uluru (Ayers Rock), the Uluru–Kata Tjuta National Park has an
entrance fee of A$25 (US$20/£10) per person for three days. It’s worth
every cent.
The See Sydney & Beyond Smartvisit card (% 02/9247 6611; www.
seesydneycard.com) packages more than 40 of the city’s main attrac-
tions and tours. It’s available for one, two, three, or seven days, and you
can buy the card online in advance or pick it up after you arrive. A one-
day pass costs A$65 (US$52/£26).
Seniors visiting from overseas do not usually qualify for discounts (dis-
counts are reserved for Australian citizens), but it pays to ask because
exceptions do exist.
Shopping and nightlife
Shopping and nightlife are two areas in which you can be really flexible
with your budgeting. Whether you hit the sack or hit the town is up to
you. Scan the nightlife options in each chapter and decide what will add
to your Australian experience and what you can live without (depending
on the cost). Most clubs outside Sydney have reasonable cover charges.
Sydney and Melbourne offer all the shopping you’d expect in major
international cities, from cheap souvenirs to high-end luxury goods. You
can also spend significant amounts on Aboriginal art or such Australian
specialties as opals and pearls, or you can come home with a relatively
inexpensive but unique piece of art or jewelry.
Cutting Costs — But Not the Fun
Because going to Australia isn’t an everyday event, you should plan to
spend enough to make it a comfortable, fun trip. But you can have a
memorable experience without going broke. Here are some suggestions:
 Go off-season. If you can travel at non-peak times, which can be
easy when it’s summer in Australia and winter in the Northern
Hemisphere, you’ll find hotel prices almost half the price of peak
months. Look for shoulder season values during the transitional
seasons of spring and fall.
 Travel midweek. If you can travel on a Tuesday, Wednesday, or
Thursday, you may find cheaper flights to Australia. When you ask
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Australia 
50

about airfares, see if you can get a cheaper rate by flying on a differ-
ent day. (For more tips on getting a good fare, see Chapter 6.)
 Try a package tour. For many destinations, you can book airfare,
hotel, ground transportation, and some sightseeing just by making
one call to a travel agent or packager, for a price much less than if
you put the trip together yourself. Several airlines offer excellent
package deals. (See Chapter 6 for more on package tours.)
 Reserve a room with a refrigerator and coffeemaker. You don’t
have to slave over a hot stove to cut a few costs. Most hotels and
motels in Australia have minifridges and coffeemakers. Just making
your own breakfast will save you money.
 Always ask for discount rates. Membership in AAA, frequent-flier
plans, trade unions, AARP, or other groups may qualify you for sav-
ings on car rentals, plane tickets, hotel rooms, and even meals. Ask
about everything; you may be pleasantly surprised.
 Ask whether your kids can stay in the room with you. A room
with two double beds usually doesn’t cost any more than one with
a queen-size bed. And many hotels won’t charge you the additional-
person rate if the additional person is pint-size and related to you.
Even if you have to pay an extra charge for a rollaway bed, you’ll
save much more by not taking two rooms.
 Try expensive restaurants at lunch instead of dinner. Lunch tabs
are usually a fraction of what dinner would cost at the same restau-
rant, and the menu often boasts many of the same specialties.
 Get out of town. In many places, big savings are just a short drive
or taxi ride away. Hotels just outside the city, across the river, or
less conveniently located can be great bargains. Outlying motels
often have free parking, with lower rates than downtown hotels.
 Don’t rent a gas guzzler. Renting a smaller car is cheaper, and you
save on gas to boot. (Remember: Gas is somewhat more expensive
in Australia than it is in the United States or Canada.) For more on
car rentals, see Chapter 7.
 Walk a lot. And we’re not just talking about bushwalking. In the 
relatively flat, compact city centers, a good pair of walking shoes
can save you lots of money in taxis and other local transportation.
As a bonus, you’ll get to know your destination more intimately, as
you explore at a slower pace.
 Skip the souvenirs. Your photographs and your memories may be
the best mementos of your trip. If you’re concerned about money,
you can do without the T-shirts, key chains, snow globes, plastic
boomerangs, and other cheesy trinkets.
Chapter 5: Managing Your Money 51

Handling Money
You’re the best judge of how much cash you feel comfortable carrying or
what alternative is your favorite — and that’s not going to change much
on your vacation. True, you’ll probably be moving around more and
incurring more expenses than you generally do (unless you happen to
eat out every meal when you’re at home), and you may let your mind
slip into vacation gear and not be as vigilant about your safety. But,
those factors aside, the only type of payment that won’t be quite as
available to you away from home is your personal checkbook.
The Australian dollar is divided into 100¢. Coins are 5¢, 10¢, 20¢, and 50¢
pieces (silver) and $1 and $2 pieces (gold). Prices often end in a variant
of 1¢ and 2¢ (for example, 78¢ or $2.71), a relic from the days before 1-
cent and 2-cent pieces were phased out. Prices are rounded to the near-
est 5¢ — so 77¢ rounds down to 75¢, and 78¢ rounds up to 80¢. Bank
notes come in denominations of $5, $10, $20, $50, and $100.
Universal Currency Converter (www.xe.com/ucc) gives up-to-the-
minute conversions for your dollar or pound. Table 5-1 offers a rough
idea of how many Australian dollars you’ll get for your home currency.
The rate of exchange used for the U.S. dollar was US$1 = A$1.25 (or A$1 =
US$0.80). The exchange rate for the British pound was £1 = A$2.45 (or
A$1 = £0.40).
Exchange at least some money — just enough to cover airport inciden-
tals and transportation to your hotel — before you leave home (though
don’t expect the exchange rate to be ideal), so you can avoid lines at air-
port ATMs.
When you change money, ask for some small bills or loose change. Petty
cash will come in handy for tipping and public transportation. Consider
keeping the change separate from your larger bills, so that it’s readily
accessible and you’ll be less of a target for theft.
You can exchange money before you leave at your local American
Express or Thomas Cook office or at most major banks. American
Express offers traveler’s checks and foreign currency (with a $15 order
fee and additional shipping costs) at www.americanexpress.com or 
% 800-807-6233.
Using ATMs and carrying cash
The easiest and best way to get cash away from home is from an ATM,
sometimes referred to as a cash machine or money machine in Australia.
The Cirrus (% 800-424-7787; www.mastercard.com) and PLUS (% 800-
843-7587; www.visa.com) networks span the globe; look at the back of
your bank card to see which network you’re on, and then call or check
online for ATM locations at your destination. Be sure you know your 
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Australia 
52

personal identification number (PIN) before you leave home, and find
out your daily withdrawal limit. Keep in mind that many banks impose a
fee every time your card is used at a different bank’s ATM, and that fee
can be much higher for international transactions (up to $5 or more). On
top of this, the bank from which you withdraw cash may charge its own
fee. Check with your bank to find out what kind of fee will be added for
international withdrawals, and plan your visits to ATMs accordingly.
Even with the international transaction fees, ATMs often offer the best
exchange rates. Avoid exchanging money at commercial exchange
bureaus and hotels, which often have the highest transaction fees.
Australian ATMs use four-digit PINs, so if you have a longer PIN, make
sure you change yours to a four-digit one before you leave home. The
major banks in Australia are the National Australia Bank, the Common-
wealth Bank, ANZ, and Westpac.

Charging ahead with credit cards
Credit cards are a safe way to carry money: They also provide a conven-
ient record of your expenses, and they generally offer good exchange
rates. You can also withdraw cash advances at banks or ATMs, if you
know your PIN. If you’ve forgotten yours, or didn’t even know you had
one, call the number on the back of your credit card and ask the bank to
send it to you. It usually takes five to seven business days.
Keep in mind that many banks assess a 1 percent to 3 percent transac-
tion fee on all charges you incur abroad (whether you’re using the local
currency or your native currency). But credit cards still may be the
smart way to go when you factor in things like ATM fees and traveler’s
check exchange rates (and service fees).
Some credit card companies recommend that you notify them of any
impending trips abroad so that they don’t become suspicious when the
card is used in a foreign destination and block your charges. Even if you
don’t call your credit card company in advance, you can always call the
card’s toll-free emergency number if a charge is refused — a good reason
to carry the phone number with you. Carry more than one card on your
trip; a card may not work for any number of reasons, so having a backup
is the smart way to go.
Visa and MasterCard are universally accepted in Australia; American
Express and Diners Club are considerably less common, and Discover is
not used. Always carry a little cash, because many merchants won’t take
credit cards for purchases under A$15 (US$12/£6) or so.
Toting traveler’s checks
Traveler’s checks are not as widely accepted in Australia as they are in
many other countries. If you do opt for them, get them in Australian dol-
lars. Checks in major currencies are often accepted at banks, big hotels,
currency exchanges, and some shops in major tourist regions, but
smaller shops, restaurants, and other businesses will have no idea what
the exchange rate is when you present a check denominated in a non-
Australian currency. Another advantage of Australian-dollar checks is
that the two largest Aussie banks, ANZ and Westpac, cash them free of
charge; it’ll cost you around A$5 to A$11 (US$4–US$8.80/£2–£4.40) to
cash a check denominated in a foreign currency at most Australian
banks.
Taking into account ATM fees, if you’re withdrawing money from an ATM
daily, you may be better off with traveler’s checks.
You can buy traveler’s checks at most banks in your home country.
They’re offered in denominations of $20, $50, $100, $500, and sometimes
$1,000. Generally, you’ll pay a service charge ranging from 1 percent to 4
percent. The most popular traveler’s checks are offered by American
Express (% 800-807-6233); Visa (% 800-732-1322); and MasterCard
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Australia 
54

(% 800-223-9920). If you’re an American Express card holder, call 
% 800-221-7282 — this number accepts collect calls, offers service in
several foreign languages, and exempts Amex gold and platinum card-
holders from the 1 percent fee. If you’re a member of AAA, you can
obtain Visa checks for a $9.95 fee (for checks up to $1,500) at most 
AAA offices or by calling % 866-339-3378.
If you choose to carry traveler’s checks, be sure to keep a record of their
serial numbers separate from your checks in case they’re stolen or lost.
You’ll get a refund faster if you know the numbers.
American Express, Thomas Cook, Visa, and MasterCard offer foreign
currency traveler’s checks, which are useful when traveling to
Australia.
Taking Taxes into Account
Australia applies a 10 percent Goods and Services Tax (GST) on most
products and services. Your international airline tickets to Australia are
not taxed, nor are domestic airline tickets for travel within Australia if
you buy them outside Australia. If you buy Australian airline tickets after
you arrive in Australia, you will pay tax on them.
Basic groceries are not taxed, but restaurant meals are. Items bought in
duty-free stores will not be charged GST, nor will items you export —
such as an Aboriginal painting that you buy in a gallery in Alice Springs
and have shipped to your home outside Australia.
Other taxes include a departure tax of A$38 (US$30/£15) for every pas-
senger 12 and over, which is included in the price of your airline ticket
when you buy it; there are also landing and departure taxes at some air-
ports, which are also included in the price of your ticket.
If you visit the Great Barrier Reef, you’ll pay a “reef tax,” officially called
the Environmental Management Charge, of A$5 (US$4/£2) for every
person over the age of 4. The charge, which goes toward park upkeep,
may be included in the price of your tour, but often it is not, and you’ll
be asked for it when you board the boat.
Dealing with a Lost or Stolen Wallet
Contact your credit card company the minute you discover your wallet
has been lost or stolen and file a report at the nearest police precinct.
Your credit card company or insurer may require a police report number
or record of the loss. Most credit card companies have toll-free numbers
to call if your card is lost or stolen; your credit card company may be
able to wire you a cash advance or deliver an emergency credit card in a
day or two. Call the following toll-free numbers in Australia:
Chapter 5: Managing Your Money 55

 American Express: % 1300/132 639
 MasterCard: % 1800/120 113
 Visa: % 1800/450 346
Visa’s U.S. emergency number is % 800-847-2911 or 410-581-9994.
American Express cardholders and traveler’s check holders should call
% 800-221-7282. MasterCard holders should call % 800-307-7309 or
636-722-7111. For other credit cards, call the toll-free number directory
at % 800-555-1212.
If you need emergency cash over the weekend when all banks and
American Express offices are closed, you can have money wired to you
via Western Union (% 800-325-6000; www.westernunion.com).
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Australia 
56
Getting your GST back
You can claim back the General Service Tax you’ve paid, through the Tourist Refund
Scheme (TRS), when you leave Australia, on the taxes that you paid on purchases of
A$300 (US$240/£120) or more from a single outlet, within the last 30 days before you
leave. More than one item may be included in that A$300. You can also claim a 14.5
percent wine tax called Wine Equalisation Tax (WET)
For example, you can claim the GST you paid on ten T-shirts each worth A$30 (US$24/
£12), as long as you bought them in the same store. Do this as you leave Australia by
presenting your receipt, or tax invoice, to the Australian Customs Service’s TRS booths,
located beyond passport control in the international departure areas at most airports.
If you buy several things on different days from one store, which together add up to
A$300 or more, you must ask the store to total all purchases on one tax invoice — now
there’s a nice piece of bureaucracy to remember Australia by!
Pack the items you have purchased in Australia in your carry-on baggage, because
you must show them to Customs. You can use the goods before you leave Australia
(such as wearing clothes or jewelry you’ve purchased) and still claim the refund, but
you cannot claim a refund on things you’ve actually consumed. You cannot claim a
refund on alcohol other than wine (the Wine Tax, mentioned above). Allow a little extra
time to stand in line at the airport and get your refund.
You can also claim a refund if you leave Australia as a cruise passenger from Circular
Quay or Darling Harbour in Sydney, or from Brisbane, Cairns, Darwin, Hobart, or
Fremantle (Perth). If your cruise departs from elsewhere in Australia, or if you’re flying
out from an airport other than Adelaide, Brisbane, Cairns, Darwin, the Gold Coast,
Melbourne, Perth, or Sydney, call the Australian Customs Service (% 1300/363 263 in
Australia, or 02/6275 6666) to see if you can still claim the refund.

Identity theft or fraud is a potential complication of losing your wallet,
especially if you’ve lost your driver’s license as well as cash and credit
cards. Notify the major credit reporting bureaus as soon as you get
home (or right away if you’re on an extended trip); placing a fraud alert
on your records may protect you against liability for criminal activity.
The major U.S. agencies are Equifax (% 800-766-0008; www.equifax.
com), Experian (% 888-397-3742; www.experian.com), and TransUnion
(% 800-680-7289; www.transunion.com).
If you’ve lost all forms of photo ID, call your airline and explain the situa-
tion; the airline’s agents may allow you to board the plane if you have a
copy of your passport or birth certificate and a copy of the police
report.

 Booking your flight (and getting the best price)
 Looking for escorted tours and package deals
T
he first and most important thing to consider is that Australia is a
long, long haul from the Northern Hemisphere. It is a nearly 15-hour
nonstop flight from Los Angeles to Sydney, made even longer if you
come via Honolulu. From the East Coast of North America, add five-and-
a-half hours to that! If you’re coming from the States via Auckland, add
transit time in New Zealand plus another three hours for the Auckland–
Sydney leg. If you’re coming from the United Kingdom, you’re in for a
flight of around 12 hours from London to Asia, and then possibly a lay-
over of quite a few hours (which is not a bad thing if you can find a hotel
room to rest in), because flights to Australia have a habit of arriving in
Asia early in the morning and departing around midnight; and finally
another eight- to nine-hour flight to Australia. Still keen? Great, let’s go!
Flying to Australia (and Stops 
along the Way)
Sydney, Cairns, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide, Darwin, and Perth are all
international gateways, but most major airlines fly only into Sydney. Not
many long-haul flights to Australia are nonstop. On most flights you’ll
have at least one stop somewhere, such as Honolulu, Hong Kong,
Singapore, or somewhere else in Asia. Although this will extend your
flying time, you may be grateful for the chance to stretch your legs or
have a stopover, sometimes at no extra cost (except for the hotel room
in which you’ll catch up on your sleep!).

The major airports (and which airlines fly into them)
 Sydney: Kingsford Smith Airport is Australia’s main international
airport. It is 8km (5 miles) from the city center and is served by Air
Canada (U.S. flights from Los Angeles and Honolulu; Canadian

and Pacific Blue links Sydney and Christchurch.
 Melbourne: Often referred to as Tullamarine Airport, after the
suburb in which it’s located, Melbourne International Airport is
22km (14 miles) northwest of the city center (conveniently under
the same roof as the domestic terminals). It’s served by Air New
Zealand (U.S. flights from Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Hono-
lulu; U.K. flights from London; New Zealand flights from Auckland,
Wellington, Christchurch, Dunedin, Hamilton, and Palmerston
North), British Airways (U.K. flights from London), Cathay Pacific
(U.S. flights from Los Angeles and San Francisco; Canadian flights
from Vancouver and Toronto; U.K. flights from London), Emirates
(U.S. flights from New York; U.K. flights from London, Glasgow,
Manchester, and Birmingham; New Zealand flights from Auckland),

from London). Direct flights to Melbourne from New York are also
operated by Thai Airways. China Southern Airlines, Malaysia
Airlines, and Philippine Airlines also fly direct from Los Angeles.
Qantas subsidiary Jetstar flies direct from Honolulu, and from
Christchurch in New Zealand. Freedom Air flies to Melbourne from
Dunedin in New Zealand.
 Brisbane: About 20 international airlines serve Brisbane Interna-
tional Airport, which is about 16km (10 miles) from the city. The
airport is undergoing a major expansion and modernization,
expected to be finished by the end of 2008. Brisbane is served by
Qantas with direct flights from Los Angeles. Otherwise, you’ll prob-
ably arrive via Singapore or Bangkok on Singapore Airlines or Thai
Airways, or on Emirates via Dubai. Air New Zealand, Freedom
Air, Qantas, and Jetstar fly from New Zealand.
 Cairns: The airport is 8km (5 miles) north of the city center. You’re
only likely to arrive in Cairns if you’re flying on Jetstar via Singa-
pore and Darwin, on Cathay Pacific via Hong Kong, or on United
Airlines or Air New Zealand from Auckland.
 Darwin: The airport is about 13km (8 miles) northeast of the city
center. International flights into Darwin arrive via Singapore, served
by budget carriers Jetstar and Tiger Airways.
 Adelaide: The airport is 5km (3 miles) west of the city center. It is
served by Air New Zealand (flights from Auckland), Cathay Pacific
(flights from Hong Kong), Malaysia Airlines (flights from Kuala
Lumpur), Qantas (flights from Singapore), and Singapore Airlines
(flights from Singapore).
 Perth: Perth Airport is 12km (71⁄2 miles) northeast of the city. It is
served by Air New Zealand (from Auckland, code-sharing with
United Airlines and Air Canada), Cathay Pacific (from Hong
Kong), Emirates (from Dubai), Malaysia Airlines (from Kuala
Lumpur), Qantas (from Singapore, code-sharing with British
Airways), Singapore Airlines (from Singapore), Thai Airways
(from Bangkok), and Tiger Airways (from Singapore).
Getting the Best Deal on Your Airfare
Flexibility is the key to getting your ticket to Australia at the cheapest
possible price. If you can book well in advance or at the last minute, or if
you can fly midweek or at less-busy times, you may end up paying a frac-
tion of the full fare.
Try to book a ticket in its country of origin. For example, if you’re plan-
ning a one-way flight from Sydney to Auckland, an Australia-based travel
agent such as Flight Centre (% 13 31 33 in Australia, or 07/3011 7830;
www.flightcentre.com.au) will probably have the lowest fares. For
multi-leg trips, book in the country of the first leg; for example, book
Melbourne–Auckland–Los Angeles in Australia.

Travel agents specializing in cheap fares include Austravel (% 0870/166
2020 in the U.K.; www.austravel.net); Downunder Direct, a division 
of Swain Australia (% 800-642-6224 in the U.S. and Canada; www.down
underdirect.com); and Goway (% 800-387-8850 in the U.S. and
Canada; www.goway.com).
Keep an eye on television and newspaper ads for promotional specials
or fare wars, which can be seasonal or suddenly break out when a car-
rier adds a new route.
Working with consolidators
Consolidators, also known as bucket shops, are wholesale brokers in the
airline-ticket game. Consolidators buy deeply discounted tickets (“dis-
tressed” inventories of unsold seats) from airlines and sell them to
online ticket agencies, travel agents, tour operators, corporations, and,
to a lesser degree, the general public.
Consolidators advertise in Sunday newspaper travel sections (often in
small ads with tiny type), in the United States and the United Kingdom.
They can be great sources for cheap international tickets. On the down-
side, these tickets are often loaded with restrictions, such as cancella-
tion penalties (as high as 50 percent to 75 percent of the ticket price).
And keep in mind that most of what you see advertised is of limited
availability.
Several reliable consolidators are worldwide and available online. STA
Travel (www.statravel.com) has been the world’s leading consolidator
for students since it purchased Council Travel, but its fares are competi-
tive for travelers of all ages. Flights.com (www.flights.com) has excel-
lent fares worldwide. Air Tickets Direct (% 800-778-3447; www.air
ticketsdirect.com) is based in Montreal and leverages the Canadian
dollar for low fares.
Booking your flight online
The most popular online travel agencies in the United States are
Travelocity.com, Expedia.com, and Orbitz.com. Other Web sites for
booking airline tickets online include Cheapflights.com, Smarter
Travel.com, and Priceline.com. Meta search sites (which find and then
direct you to airline and hotel Web sites for booking) include Sidestep.
com and Kayak.com. Lastminute.com is a great source for last-minute
flights and getaways. In addition, most airlines offer online-only fares
that even their phone agents know nothing about.
In the United Kingdom, go to Opodo.com or Travelsupermarket 
(% 0845/345-5708; www.travelsupermarket.com), a flight search
engine that offers flight comparisons for the budget airlines whose seats
often end up in bucket-shop sales. British travelers should also check
Flights International (% 0800/0187050; www.flights-international.
com) for deals on flights all over the world.

Considering an Escorted or Package Tour
One of the great advantages of escorted tours, with a group leader to
take care of everything for you, is that the price usually includes every-
thing from airfare to hotels, meals, tours, admission costs, and local
transportation. There are no nasty financial surprises along the way, and
you can also get to see the greatest number of sights in the shortest
available time, with the minimal chance — if your tour operator is 
reputable — of anything going very wrong.
Despite the fact that escorted tours require big deposits and give you
little flexibility in the choice of hotels, restaurants, and itineraries, many
people enjoy the structure they offer. Whether they’re by bus, coach,
train, or boat — or a combination — escorted tours let you sit back and
relax without having to worry about the details. Tours are particularly
convenient for people with limited mobility, and they can be a great way
to make new friends, especially if you’re traveling alone.
On the downside, you’ll have little opportunity for much spontaneous
interaction with the locals. The tours can be jam-packed with activities,
leaving little room for individual sightseeing, and they often focus on the
most popular sights, so you miss out on lesser-known gems.
When choosing an escorted tour, ask a few simple questions before you
pay a deposit:
 What is the company’s cancellation policy? Can you get your
money back if you cancel? How late can you cancel? Can the tour
operator cancel the trip if it doesn’t get the required minimum 
passengers?
 What are the hotel choices and price options? Check them out
online, and find out what types of rooms are offered.

Avoiding economy-class syndrome
Deep vein thrombosis (DVT), or “economy-class syndrome,” is a potentially fatal blood
clot that develops in a deep vein. It can be caused by sitting in cramped conditions —
such as an airplane seat — for too long. During a long-haul flight, be sure to get up,
walk around, and stretch your legs every 60 to 90 minutes to keep your blood flowing.
Other preventive measures include frequent flexing of the legs while sitting, drinking
lots of water, and avoiding alcohol and sleeping pills. If you have a history of DVT, heart
disease, or another condition that puts you at high risk, some experts recommend
wearing compression stockings or taking anticoagulants when you fly. Consult your
doctor about the best course for you. Symptoms of deep vein thrombosis include leg
pain or swelling, or even shortness of breath.

 Is a complete schedule available? (You need to assess how jam-
packed it is.) Is there free time to shop on your own or just lie by
the pool with a book? Can you opt out of some activities if you
want to? Are you going to be up before the roosters every day?
 How large is the group? Does the tour operator have a minimum
and maximum number of people it’ll take? What is the likely age
group you’ll be traveling with?
 What exactly does the tour include in the price? Ask about trans-
fers to and from the airport, and whether drinks are included in the
meal prices. What about tipping?
 Are airport departure fees and taxes included in the total cost
(they rarely are)? Are there any other fees? Look for hidden fees so
you know exactly how much the tour will cost.
Here are a few companies that offer escorted tours to Australia:
 Connections Adventures and Connections Safaris (call 
Australian Pacific Touring % 800-290-8687 in the U.S., Goway 
% 800-387-8850 in Canada, and % 020/89464536 in the U.K.;
www.connections.travel) offer two kinds of tours within
Australia. Connections Adventures is aimed at the 18-to-39 age
group, with tours in Queensland and the Northern Territory.
Connections Safaris has an open age policy and runs small group
tours in the Northern Territory, Western Australia, and Tasmania.
 Contiki (% 888-CONTIKI [266-8454] in the U.S. and Canada, 1300/
188 635 or 02/9511 2200 in Australia; www.contiki.com) specializes
in escorted tours for 18- to 35-year-olds. It offers a wide range of
Australian tours, from 3 days on the Great Barrier Reef to 25 days in
the Northern Territory, Queensland, and New South Wales — and
whole lot in between. Because they attract a lot of Australians,
Contiki tours are a good way to meet locals.
 Premier Vacations (% 800-321-6720 in the U.S. and Canada; www.
premierdownunder.com) is a reliable escorted tour operator, offer-
ing a 27-day “grand tour,” which also takes in New Zealand, as well
as an independent tour of Sydney, Melbourne, and Cairns.
 Maupintour (% 800-255-4266 in the U.S. and Canada; www.
maupintour.com) offers a 15-day tour of Australia, covering Cairns,
Uluru, Alice Springs, Melbourne, Hobart, and Sydney.
 Collette Vacations (% 800-340-5158 in the U.S., 800-468-5955 in
Canada, or 0800/0921-888 in the U.K.; www.collettevacations.
com) has been offering escorted tours since 1918! It offers trips of
up to two weeks, including tours for people interested in the great
train journeys of Australia and its wineries.
Chapter 6: Getting to Australia 63

Choosing a package tour
Package tours are simply a way to buy the airfare, hotel, car rental, air-
port transfers, and sometimes activities at one time and often at prices
far less than you’d pay for each thing separately. For people who don’t
want an escorted tour, this is a great way of saving money. You can get
such a good price because the tour operators buy packages in bulk, so
they can resell them for less.
Travel packages are also listed in the travel section of your local Sunday
newspaper, or in national travel magazines such as Arthur Frommer’s
Budget Travel Magazine, Travel + Leisure, National Geographic Traveler,
and Condé Nast Traveler.
One good source of package deals is the airlines themselves. Most major
airlines offer air/land packages. Several big online travel agencies —
Expedia, Travelocity, Orbitz, and Lastminute.com — also do a brisk busi-
ness in packages.
Locating package tours
Information about package tours to Australia is available from a number
of sources, including the following companies:

Coping with jet lag
Jet lag is the worst thing about traveling long distances across different time zones.
If you’re flying north–south and you feel sluggish when you touch down, your symp-
toms will be the result of dehydration and the general stress of air travel. But when
you travel east–west or vice-versa, your body becomes hopelessly muddled about
what time it is, and everything — from your digestive system to your brain — can
become severely out of whack. Traveling east is more difficult on your internal clock
than traveling west because most peoples’ bodies are more inclined to stay up late
than fall asleep early.
To help fight off the worst effects of jet lag try these suggestions:
 Reset your watch to your destination time before you board the plane.
 Drink lots of water before, during, and after your flight. Avoid alcohol.
 Exercise and sleep well for a few days before your trip.
 If you have trouble sleeping on planes, fly eastward on morning flights.
 Daylight is the key to resetting your body clock. At the Web site for Outside In
(www.bodyclock.com), you can get a customized plan of when to seek and
avoid light in order to cope with jet lag.

 Austravel (% 0870/166-2020 in the U.K.; www.austravel.net) has
been packaging tours Down Under for more than 30 years.
 ATS Tours (% 888-781-5170 in the U.S. and Canada; www.ats
tours.com). Another long-time operator (it’s been around for 32
years), ATS offers independent and escorted tours throughout
Australia and the South Pacific.
 Goway (% 800-387-8850 in the U.S. and Canada; www.goway.com),
has been operating since 1970 and even has an office in Sydney.
 Swain Tours (% 800-22-SWAIN [79246] in the U.S. and Canada;
www.swaintours.com) and Swain’s budget-travel division,
Downunder Direct (% 800-642-6224 in the U.S. and Canada;
www.downunderdirect.com), are also good sources. Swain is oper-
ated and largely staffed by Aussies and has an office in Sydney.
Checking out airline and hotel packages
Airlines are a good source for package tours because they package their
flights together with accommodations. The following airlines offer pack-
ages to Australia:
 American Airlines Vacations (% 800-321-2121; www.aa
vacations.com).
 Continental Airlines Vacations (% 800-301-3800; www.co
vacations.com).
 United Vacations (% 888-854-3899; www.unitedvacations.com).
 Qantas Vacations (% 800-348-8145 in the U.S., or 800-348-8137 in
Canada; www.qantasvacations.com). Qantas also offers great 
discounts on flights within Australia with its Aussie AirPass (see
Chapter 7).

Getting Around Australia
by Lee Mylne
In This Chapter
 Flying around the country
 Taking the train or the bus
 Driving yourself, and learning the rules of the road
V
ast. That’s the best word to describe Australia. Make no mistake,
the distances to cover if you’re going to see even a fraction of the
best of this country are enormous. Don’t think you’ll be able to travel
easily and quickly between the major sights — because you simply
won’t. For example, Uluru (Ayers Rock) is more than 2,800km (1,760
miles) northwest of Sydney, and the Great Barrier Reef is a similar dis-
tance northeast of Sydney — that’s roughly the distance from New York
City to Denver, Colorado. Possibly the biggest mistake visitors make is
underestimating how long it takes to get around.
Flying is the best way to travel between most points. If you have the
time or the inclination, you can travel by train, bus, or car, but the land-
scape is often unchanging. A good compromise is to fly when the dis-
tances between your chosen destinations are long and use land travel
for shorter hops.
Making Your Way Around Australia
By plane
Airfares within Australia have always been expensive. In recent years,
greater competition between domestic airlines has brought the prices
down a bit, but you still need to plan ahead and budget. Australia’s air
network is not as well developed as that of North America or Europe, so
don’t assume there’s a direct flight to your chosen destination, or that
there’s a flight every hour or even every day.

Between them, the three major airlines serve every state capital, as well
as most major regional towns on the east coast, Tasmania, and places
like Broome in Western Australia. Competition is getting fiercer, so all
airlines will likely have added to their route networks by the time you
read this.
Melbourne has two airports: the main international and domestic termi-
nals at Tullamarine, and Avalon Airport, about 50km (31 miles) from the
city, which is used by Jetstar. Make sure you check which one your flight
leaves from before you book.
The main players are
 Qantas (% 800-227-4500 in the U.S. and Canada; 0845/7747767 in
the U.K. or 208/600 4300 in London; 1/407 3278 in Ireland; 0800/
808 767 in New Zealand or 09/357 8900 in Auckland; 13 13 13 in
Australia; www.qantas.com.au)
 Virgin Blue (% 13 67 89 in Australia, or 07/3295 2296; www.
virginblue.com.au)
 Jetstar (% 13 15 38 in Australia, or 03/8341 4901; 0800 800 995
in New Zealand; www.jetstar.com.au), a Qantas-owned no-frills
airline.
 Regional Express (% 13 17 13 in Australia; www.regional
express.com.au) serves regional New South Wales, South
Australia, Victoria, and northern Tasmania.
Low-cost Asian carrier Tiger Airways (www.tigerairways.com),
already flying into Darwin and Perth from Singapore, started offering
Australian domestic flights from Melbourne in late 2007.
Saving money on airfares
Qantas typically offers international travelers a discount of around 30
percent off the full price for domestic flights bought within Australia. 
To qualify, show your passport and international ticket number when
making your booking. But confirm that the fare for international trav-
elers is the best deal you can get, because the latest deal in the market
that day (or a package deal with accommodations thrown in) may be
even cheaper.
If you’re visiting from the United States and plan on traveling to more
than one Australian city, buying a Qantas Aussie AirPass is much
cheaper than buying regular fares. The pass is good for travel on certain
flights between Los Angeles, San Francisco, or Honolulu and Sydney,
Melbourne, or Brisbane, and also gives you up to another three destina-
tions within Australia (or more, for an extra US$100 each).
AirPass prices starts from US$1,099 to US$1,599 depending on the
season, for economy-class travel. Prices vary according to which “zone”
Chapter 7: Getting Around Australia 67

you’re traveling to. Zone 1 covers travel to Sydney, Canberra, Mel-
bourne, Brisbane, the Gold Coast, Adelaide, Hobart, and Launceston.
Zone 2, which costs an extra US$200, will take you to Cairns, Townsville,
Hamilton Island, Rockhampton, Mackay, Gladstone, Alice Springs, Ayers
Rock (Uluru), and Darwin. Zone 3 costs an extra US$400 or US$500 and
will get you to Perth, Broome, and Hayman Island.
If you’re starting your trip in the United States from somewhere other
than Los Angeles or Honolulu, special fares are available — but only
from San Jose, San Diego, Seattle, Portland, Las Vegas, Dallas, Denver, St.
Louis, Chicago, New York (JFK and Newark), Washington, D.C., Miami,
and Boston. Check with Qantas (% 800-227 4603; www.qantas.com) for
details.
The AirPass is also only available on certain flights, but you can pay a
US$300 surcharge to travel on other flights and still get an AirPass. You
must stay for a minimum of 7 days and a maximum of 21 days from your
first transatlantic flight, and must buy the pass before you arrive in
Australia. Australia and New Zealand residents can’t purchase this pass.
Flight-seeing
Aerial touring allows you to miss all the boring bits of traveling by land.
Many of the most fascinating landscapes, such as the weird Bungle
Bungles formations in the Kimberley, are best seen from the air. Air-
cruising Australia (% 1800/252 053 in Australia, or 02/9693 2233;
0800/445 700 in New Zealand; www.aircruising.com.au) operates
luxury aerial tours of 8 to 12 days in a private aircraft, usually a 38-
passenger Dash 8, traveling as low as 300m (1,000 ft.). The company
mainly markets within Australia, so your fellow passengers are likely to
be Aussies. And because the tours are expensive for Australians, most
passengers are over 55. The tours are very well organized and allow lots
of time for land-based sightseeing, some free time, and a maximum two
hours in the air most days. Accommodations are usually the best avail-
able, and the itineraries include “fun extras.” Fares in 2007 ranged from
A$8,949 to A$12,695 (US$7,160–US$10,160/£3,500–£5,000) per person
sharing a double or twin room.
If your timing is right, you may also be able to take in Antarctica as part
of your Australian vacation. Antarctica Sightseeing Flights (% 1800/
633 449 in Australia, or 03/9725 8555; www.antarcticaflights.com.au)
offers once-in-a-lifetime flights over the icy continent. The 12-hour jour-
ney offers spectacular viewing of the frozen beauty of Antarctica — a
truly memorable experience. Flights are seasonal (Nov–Feb) and include
a New Year’s Eve flight. Most leave from Sydney or Melbourne, with con-
nections from Brisbane, Canberra, and Adelaide. You reach the Antarctic
coastline after about four hours flying and spend the next four hours
above pristine glaciers, mountain ranges, soaring coastal cliffs, and ice
floes. In 2007 and 2008, fares ranged from A$999 (US$799/£400) in an
economy center seat to A$5,499 (US$4,399/£2,199) in first class.

By train
Australia’s rail network links Perth to Adelaide, and continues on to
Melbourne and north to Canberra, Sydney, Brisbane, and up the coast to
Cairns. There’s a line right up the middle, from Adelaide to Alice Springs
and Darwin. Some rural towns, such as Broken Hill, also have rail serv-
ice. Trains generally cost more than buses but are still reasonably
priced, and offer a comfortable, safe way of getting around.
Most long-distance trains have sleepers with windows, air-conditioning,
electric outlets, wardrobes, sinks, and fresh linens. First-class sleepers
have attached bathrooms, and fares often include meals. Second-class
sleepers use shared shower facilities, and meals are not included. Some
second-class sleepers are private cabins; on other trains you share with
strangers. Single cabins are usually of broom-closet dimensions but sur-
prisingly comfy, with their own toilets and basins. The food ranges from
mediocre to pretty good. Smoking is usually banned, or allowed only in
the club cars or special “smoking rooms.”
There are several different authorities that run the trains. They are:
 Countrylink (% 13 22 32 in Australia; www.countrylink.info),
which manages travel within New South Wales and from Sydney to
Canberra, Melbourne, Brisbane, and a number of New South Wales
country towns
 Great Southern Railway (% 13 21 47 in Australia, or 08/8213 4592;
www.gsr.com.au), a private enterprise that runs the long-distance
Indian Pacific, the Overland, and the Ghan
 Public Transport Authority, or PTA (% 1300/662 205 in Western
Australia, or 08/9326 2600; www.transwa.wa.gov.au), which oper-
ates trains in Western Australia
 Traveltrain, the long-distance train division of Queensland Rail 
(% 1300/131 722 in Australia, or 07/3235 1133; www.traveltrain.
com.au), which handles rail within that state
Outside Australia, the umbrella organization Rail Australia (www.rail
australia.com.au) handles inquiries and makes reservations for all
long-distance trains, with the exception of PTA routes, through its over-
seas agents: ATS Tours (% 800-423-2880) in the United States; Goway
(% 800-387-8850) in Canada; International Rail (% 0870/751-5000) in
the United Kingdom; and Tranz Scenic (% 0800/808 900 or 03/339
3809) in New Zealand.
Two long-distance trains — the Indian Pacific and the Ghan — are experi-
ences in themselves rather than just a way of getting between two
points. They can also be expensive, but if you’re a train buff, they’re 
not to be missed.
Chapter 7: Getting Around Australia 69

The Indian Pacific, run by Great Southern Railway, is a glamorous train
linking Sydney, Broken Hill, Adelaide, Kalgoorlie, and Perth in a three-
day Outback run twice a week. Slightly less glam, but still comfortable,
the Ghan (named after Afghani camel trainers who traveled the Outback
in the 19th century) travels between Adelaide and Darwin twice a week
via Alice Springs, with connections from Sydney and Perth on the Indian
Pacific and from Melbourne on Great Southern Railway’s third train, the
newly refurbished Overland. It travels in daylight between Adelaide and
Melbourne three times a week. All three trains offer a choice of economy
seats and second- or first-class sleepers.
Queensland Rail’s Traveltrain operates two trains on the Brisbane–
Cairns route: The Sunlander runs twice a week from Brisbane to Cairns,
offering a choice of the premium, all-inclusive Queenslander class;
single-, double-, or triple-berth sleepers; or economy seats. Two services
also run as far as Townsville on this route without Queenslander class.
The high-speed Tilt Train operates two weekly trips on the same route
in less time — by about eight hours — with business-class-style seating.
Tilt Trains also serve Rockhampton daily (except Sat) from Brisbane.
Traveltrain also operates trains to Outback towns. All Traveltrain and
most Countrylink long-distance trains stop at most towns en route, so
they’re useful for exploring the eastern states.
Saving with rail packages and passes
Rail passes are available from Rail Australia, through its overseas agents.
Passes are not valid for first-class travel, but upgrades are available. The
Austrail Flexipass is good for economy seats and second-class sleepers
on all long-distance trains (except PTA service in Western Australia) and
is even good for suburban city train networks. It allows you to travel for
15 or 22 days, consecutive or not, within a 6-month period. Prices range
from A$862 (US$690/£345) for a 15-day Flexipass to A$1,210 (US$968/
£484) for a 22-day Flexipass.
This pass, and the Great Southern Railway Rail Explorer Pass, which
gives you six months of unlimited travel aboard the Ghan, the Indian
Pacific, and the Overland for A$590 (US$472/£236) must be bought before
you arrive in Australia.
Queensland’s Traveltrain Holidays (% 1300/131 722 in Australia, or
07/3235 1133; www.traveltrain.com.au), has the Wanderer and
Stopover rail passes. The Wanderer pass costs A$266 (US$213/£106)
and provides six months of unlimited one-way travel in economy seating
on Queensland’s coastal trains, with departures from Brisbane or Cairns.
Pass holders also receive up to 50 percent discounts for return journeys
on any of the Queensland’s Outback rail services. The Stopover fare lets
travelers choose to stop up to four times in four weeks when traveling
on the Tilt Train. Prices vary depending on the number of stops.
Great Southern Railway, Countrylink, and Queensland Rail Traveltrain all
offer rail packages that include accommodations and sightseeing.

By bus
Australian bus or “coach” terminals are centrally located and well lit,
and buses are usually clean and air-conditioned, with adjustable seats,
TV monitors, and sometimes toilets. Drivers are polite and sometimes
even give a bit of a commentary. Buses are all nonsmoking.
Australia has one national long-distance coach operator, Greyhound
Australia (% 13 14 99 in Australia, or 07/4690 9950; www.greyhound.
com.au) — not to be confused with Greyhound in the United States. The
company does not operate in Tasmania, which is serviced by Redline
Coaches (% 1300/360 000 in Australia; www.redlinecoaches.com.au).
In addition to point-to-point services, Greyhound Australia also offers a
limited range of tours at popular locations on its networks, including
Uluru, Kakadu, Monkey Mia in Western Australia, and the Great Ocean
Road in Victoria.
Fares and some passes are considerably cheaper for students, back-
packer cardholders, and Hostelling International/YHA members.
Several kinds of bus passes are available, including day passes (for
between 3 and 30 days), preset itinerary passes, and distance-based
passes. You may need to book the next leg of your trip 12 to 24 hours
ahead; during school vacation periods, which are always busy, booking
as much as seven days ahead is a good idea.
If you know where you’re going and you’re willing to obey a “no back-
tracking” rule, consider Greyhound Australia’s Aussie Explorer pre- 
determined itinerary pass. This allows unlimited stops in a generous
time frame on a preset one-way route (you can travel the route in either
direction). There is a huge range of itineraries to choose from. For exam-
ple, the Aussie Reef and Rock pass takes in Alice Springs, Katherine,
Darwin, Mount Isa, Cairns, and the whole east coast down to Sydney.
The pass is valid for six months and costs A$1,293 (US$1,034/£517) from
Sydney, including tours to Uluru (Ayers Rock), Kakadu National Park,
and Kings Canyon. You don’t have to start in Sydney; you can start at
any point along any of the pass routes, in which case the pass may be
cheaper. In the case of the Reef and Rock pass, you could start in
Brisbane (in which case the pass costs A$1,176/US$941/£470) or Cairns
(from where the pass costs A$943/US$754/£377). The All Australian
Pass costs A$2,827 (US$2,262/£1,131) and is valid for a year.
The Aussie Kilometre Pass allows unlimited stops in any direction
within the distance you buy. Passes are available in increments of
1,000km (620 miles). Prices range from A$360 (US$288/£144) for 2,000km

(US$2,078/£1,039) for 20,000km (6,200 miles).

By car
There are definitely some great drives in Australia, and you can set the
pace if you’re the one behind the wheel, and even reach some places
that may not be as accessible via public transportation. So here’s the
lowdown on getting around on your own four wheels.
First of all: Drive on the left, pass on the right. This is the most important
thing to remember. There are regular fatalities involving tourists from
Europe and North America who stray onto the “wrong” side and into the
path of an oncoming vehicle. Don’t let it be you.
When you’re outside the major centers, Australian roads — even some
main highways — are two-lane affairs. In remote and country areas, they
can be rutted and potholed, often with no outside line markings, and
sometimes no shoulders. Remember that what looks like a road on a
map may actually be an “unsealed” (unpaved) track suitable for four-
wheel-drive vehicles only. Many roads in the Top End are passable only
in the Dry season (about Apr–Nov). If you plan long-distance driving, get
a road map that indicates paved and unpaved roads.
Much of the center of Australia is desert, with no roads. The north–
south Stuart Highway links Adelaide and Darwin, but that’s about the
extent of it. In most places you must travel around the edge of the coun-
try on Highway 1.
You can use your current driver’s license or an international driver’s
permit in every state of Australia. You must carry your license when
driving. The minimum driving age is 16 or 17, depending on which state
you visit, but some car rental companies require you to be 21, or even
26, if you want to rent a four-wheel-drive vehicle.
As we’ve already mentioned, there are some vast distances between
major cities and attractions in Australia. Take a look at Table 7-1 below
for some examples.

Renting a car
In tourist towns like Cairns, most tour operators will pick you up and
drop you off at your hotel door, making a rental car unnecessary. A regu-
lar car will get you to most places in this book, but in some areas with
unpaved roads, renting a four-wheel-drive vehicle makes sense. All the
major car rental companies rent them. Many companies offer specials,
especially in tourist areas with off seasons. Advance purchase rates,
usually 7 to 21 days, can offer significant savings.
The “big four” car rental companies and two other large companies in
Australia all have offices and networks across the country:
 Avis (% 13 63 33 in Australia; 800-230-4898 in the U.S. and Canada;
8445/81 81 81 in the U.K.; www.avis.com.au)
 Budget (% 1300/362 848 in Australia; 800-472-3325 in the U.S.;
800-268-8900 in Canada; 8701/56 56 56 in the U.K.; www.budget.
com.au)
 Europcar (% 1300/13 13 90 in Australia, or 03/9330 6160; 877-
940-6900 in the U.S. and Canada; 0870/607-5000 in the U.K.; www.
europcar.com.au)
 Hertz (% 13 30 39 in Australia; 800-654-3001 in the U.S. and
Canada; 0870/844 844 in the U.K.; www.hertz.com.au)
 Red Spot Car Rentals (% 1300/668 810 in Australia, or 02/8303
2222; www.redspotrentals.com.au; in Sydney, Melbourne,
Brisbane, Perth, Cairns, the Gold Coast, Hobart, and Launceston)
 Thrifty (% 1300/367 227 in Australia, www.thrifty.com.au;
800-847-4389 in the U.S. and Canada; 01494/751-540 in the U.K.).
Damage to a rental car caused by an animal (hitting a kangaroo, for
example) is not covered by car rental companies’ insurance policies, nor
is driving on an unpaved road. Insurance for loss of, or damage to, the
car, and third-party property insurance are usually included, but read
the agreement carefully, because the fine print contains information that
the staff may not tell you. For example, damage to the car body may be
covered, but not damage to the windshield or tires, or damage caused
by water or driving too close to a bushfire.
The deductible, known as excess in Australia, on insurance may be as
high as A$2,000 (US$1,600/£800) for regular cars and up to A$5,500
(US$4,400/£2,200) on four-wheel-drives and motor homes. You can
reduce it, or avoid it altogether, by paying a premium of between about
A$20 to A$50 (US$16–US$40/£8–£20) per day on a car or four-wheel-
drive, and around A$25 to A$50 (US$20–US$40/£10–£20) per day on a
motor home. The amount of the excess reduction premium depends on
the vehicle type and the extent of reduction you choose. Your rental
company may bundle personal accident insurance and baggage insur-
ance into this premium. And again, check the conditions; some excess
Chapter 7: Getting Around Australia 73

reduction payments don’t reduce excesses on single-vehicle accidents,
for example.
Australia’s extreme distances often make one-way rentals a necessity, for
which car rental companies can charge a hefty penalty amounting to
hundreds of dollars. A one-way fee usually applies to motor-home
rentals, too — usually around A$200 to A$220 (US$160–US$176/£80–£88),
more for remote outback areas such as Broome and Alice Springs. And
there’s a seven-day rental minimum.
By motor home
Motor homes (Aussies call them camper vans) are popular for traveling
in Australia. Smaller than American RVs, they come in two-, three-, four-,
or six-berth versions, and usually have everything you need, such as a
minifridge/freezer, microwave, gas stove, utensils, linens, and touring
information, including maps and campground guides. All have showers
and toilets, except some two-berthers. Most have air-conditioned
driver’s cabins, but not all have air-conditioned living quarters, a neces-
sity in most parts of the country from November through March. Four-
wheel-drive campers are available, but they tend to be small, and some
lack hot water, toilet, shower, and air-conditioning. The minimum driver
age for motor homes is usually 21.
Australia’s major camper van rental firms are Apollo Motorhome
Holidays (% 1800/777 779 in Australia, or 07/3265 9200; www.apollo
camper.com.au), Britz Campervan Rentals (% 1800/331 454 in
Australia, or 03/8379 8890; www.britz.com), and Maui (% 1300/363
800 in Australia, or 03/8379 8891; www.maui.com.au).
Rates vary with the seasons. May and June are the slowest months;
December and January are the busiest. You can sometimes get better
rates by booking in your home country. Renting for longer than three
weeks might reduce the daily rate by a few dollars. Most companies
require a minimum four- or five-day rental. Give the company your 
itinerary before booking, because some routes, such as the ferry to
Tasmania — or, in the case of a four-wheel-drive motor home, the Gibb
River Road in the Kimberley — may need the company’s permission.
Companies may not permit you to drive their two-wheel-drive motor
home on unpaved roads, although they may make an exception for 
relatively short, unsealed access roads to recognized campgrounds.
Check first.
Australians navigate by road name, not road number. The easiest way to
get where you’re going is to familiarize yourself with the major towns
along your route and follow the signs toward them.
Following the rules of the road, Australian style
Here are some driving tips you should know before you take to the road:
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Australia 
74

 Drive on the left. (Yes, we know we said that before, but it bears
repeating.) You yield, or “give way” to the right when a faster car
approaches. Left turns on a red light are not permitted unless a
sign says so.
 Approach roundabouts (traffic circles) slowly enough to stop if
you have to, and yield to all traffic on the roundabout. Flash your
indicator as you leave the roundabout even if you’re going straight,
because, technically, that’s a left turn.
 Do not drink and drive. Drunken driving laws are strictly enforced.
The maximum permitted blood alcohol level when driving is 0.05
percent. Police set up random breath-testing units (RBTs) all the
time, so getting caught is easy. You’ll face a court appearance if 
you do.
 Observe the speed limit. The speed limit is 50kmph (31 mph) or
60kmph (37 mph) in urban areas, 100kmph (62 mph) in most coun-
try areas, and sometimes 110kmph (68 mph) on freeways. In the
Northern Territory, the speed limit is set at 130kmph (80 mph) on
the Stuart, Arnhem, Barkly, and Victoria highways, while rural
roads are designated 110kmph (68 mph) speed limits unless other-
wise signposted. But be warned — the Territory has a high road
death toll. Speed-limit signs are black numbers circled in red on a
white background.
 Wear your seat belt — it’s required by law. Drivers and passen-
gers, including taxi passengers, must wear a seat belt when the
vehicle is moving forward. Children must sit in the back seat in a
child-safety seat or harness; car rental companies will rent these to
you, but be sure to book them in advance. Tell the taxi company
you have a child when you book a cab so it can send a car with the
right restraints.
Staying safe on the road
Fatigue is a major killer on Australia’s roads. A good rule to follow is to
take a short break every hour or two, even if you don’t feel tired. In
some states, “driver reviver” stations operate on major roads during 
holiday periods. They serve free tea, coffee, and cookies, and are often
at roadside picnic areas that have restrooms.
Kangaroos and other wildlife are a common road hazard outside the
cities. Try to avoid driving in country areas between dusk and dawn,
when it’s cooler and ’roos are most active. If you hit one, always stop
and check its pouch for live joeys (baby kangaroos); females usually
have one in the pouch. Wrap the joey tightly in a towel or old sweater,
don’t feed or overhandle it, and take it to a vet in the nearest town. Most
vets will treat native wildlife for free.
Chapter 7: Getting Around Australia 75

Organizations that can help with injured wildlife include the following:
 RSPCA Wildlife in the Australian Capital Territory (% 02/6287
8100 or 0413/495 031)
 Wildcare in Western Australia (% 08/9474 9055) and Tasmania
(% 03/6233 2852)
 Wildlife Information & Rescue Service (WIRES) in New South Wales
(% 02/8977 3333)
 Wildlife Rescue in Queensland (% 0418/792 598) and the
Northern Territory (% 0409/090 849)
 Wildlife Rescue Fauna Rescue of S.A. in South Australia (% 08/
8289 0896)
 Wildlife Victoria (% 0500/540 000 or 03/9663 9211) in Victoria.
Some highways run through unfenced stations (ranches), where sheep
and cattle pose a threat. Cattle like to rest on the warm paved road at
night, so put your lights on high to spot them. If an animal does loom,
slow down — but never swerve, or you may roll. If you have to, hit it.
Tell ranchers within 24 hours if you’ve hit their livestock.
Car rental companies will not insure for animal damage to the car, which
should give you an inkling of how common an occurrence this is.
Another major hazard is the road train. A road train can be as many as
three big truck containers linked together to make a “train” up to 54m
(177 ft.) long. If you’re in front of one, give the driver plenty of warning
when you brake, because drivers need a lot of space to slow down.
When passing a road train, allow at least 1 kilometer (2⁄3 mile) of clear
road before you pass, but don’t expect the driver to make it easy —
“truckies” are notorious for their lack of concern for motorists.
Unsealed (unpaved) country roads can also be hazardous. They’re usu-
ally bone dry, which makes them more slippery than they look, so travel
at a moderate speed — 35kmph (22 mph) is not too cautious, and any-
thing over 60kmph (37 mph) is dangerous. Don’t overcorrect if you veer
to one side. Keep well behind any other vehicles, because the dust they
throw up can block your vision.
Floods are common in the Top End and far north Queensland (north of
Cairns) from November or December through March or April (the Wet
season). Never cross a flooded road unless you’re sure of its depth.
Crocodiles may be lurking, so do not wade in to test it! Fast-flowing
water is dangerous, even if it’s shallow. When in doubt, stay where you
are and wait for the water to drop; most flash floods subside in 24 hours.
Check the road conditions ahead at least once a day in the Wet season.
We list the phone numbers for road conditions in the individual destina-
tion chapters.

Coping with emergencies on the road
The emergency breakdown assistance telephone number for every
Australian auto club is % 13 11 11 from anywhere in Australia. If you
aren’t a member of an auto club that has a reciprocal agreement with 
the Australian clubs, you’ll have to join the Australian club on the spot
before it will tow or repair your car. The cost of this varies between the
clubs in each state. Basic membership usually costs somewhere around
A$80 (US$64/£32), and you may also have to pay a special “on-road 
joining fee” (in New South Wales, it is A$159/US$127/£64) and in some
cases — depending on distances involved — a towing fee, which could
get pricey if you are stranded somewhere in the Outback. Make sure you
get the emergency assistance number for your car rental company, too.
If you break down or get lost in the Outback, never leave your vehicle.
There have been many cases of stranded drivers — even Aussies who
should have known better — dying after wandering off for help or water,
when neither is to be found for many miles. If you get lost in the Outback,
conserve your body moisture and energy by doing as little as possible
and staying in the shade of your car. Put out distress signals in patterns
of three — three yells, three columns of smoke, and so on. The tradi-
tional Outback call for help is “coo-ee” (with the accent on the ee),
yodeled in a high pitch; the sound travels a long way.
State auto clubs provide free breakdown emergency assistance to mem-
bers of many affiliated automobile associations around the world. Even
if you’re not a member, the clubs are a good source of advice on local
regulations, touring advice, road conditions, traveling in remote areas,
and any other motoring questions you may have. They share a Web site:
www.aaa.asn.au. You can drop into numerous regional offices, as well
as the locations listed here:
 New South Wales & ACT: National Roads and Motorists’
Association (NRMA), 388 George St., Sydney, NSW 2000 (% 13 11
22 in New South Wales, or 02/8741 6000).
 Northern Territory: Automobile Association of the Northern
Territory (AANT), 79–81 Smith St., Darwin, NT 0800 (% 08/8981
3837).
 Queensland: Royal Automobile Club of Queensland (RACQ), 300
St. Pauls Terrace, Fortitude Valley, QLD 4006 (% 13 19 05 in
Australia, or 07/3361 2444); also in the General Post Office (GPO)
building, 261 Queen St., Brisbane (% 07/3872 8465).
 South Australia: Royal Automobile Association of South Australia
(RAA), 55 Hindmarsh Sq., Adelaide, SA 5000 (% 08/8202 4600).
 Tasmania: Royal Automobile Club of Tasmania (RACT), corner of
Murray and Patrick streets, Hobart, TAS 7000 (% 13 27 22 in
Tasmania, or 03/6232 6300).
Chapter 7: Getting Around Australia 77

 Victoria: Royal Automobile Club of Victoria (RACV), 550 Princes
Hwy., Noble Park, VIC 3174 (% 13 13 29 in Australia, or 03/9790
2211).
 Western Australia: Royal Automobile Club of WA (RACWA), 228
Adelaide Terrace, Perth, WA 6000 (% 13 17 03 or 08/9436 4444).
Filling up the tank
Petrol (gasoline) stations are mostly self-service in the cities, but you
may find a full-service operation in country towns. Prices go up and
down, but at press time it was around A$1.21 (£0.48) a liter, which is the
equivalent of US$3.65 per gallon, for unleaded petrol in Sydney, and
A$1.45 (£0.58) per liter (US$4.38 per gallon) or more in the Outback.
(One U.S. gallon equals 3.78 liters.) Most rental cars take unleaded gas,
and motor homes run on diesel.
Gas stations (also called roadhouses in rural areas) can be few and far
between in the Outback, so fill up whenever you can.

Accommodations

W
hether you’re looking for a luxury resort on the Great Barrier
Reef, a hideaway bed-and-breakfast, a city apartment where you
can cook for yourself, or the chance to meet the locals, you can find
whatever accommodations you need in Australia. From top-class hotels
in the cities, to budget hostels almost everywhere, Australia has a wide
range of accommodations to suit almost every traveler.
Most hotel rooms have reverse-cycle air-conditioning for heating and
cooling, a telephone, a color TV, a clock radio, a minifridge (if not a mini-
bar), an iron and ironing board, and self-serve coffee and tea. Private
bathrooms are standard, although they often have only showers, not
tubs. Air-conditioning is essential for any room you’re booking in
Queensland, the Red Centre, and the Top End, including the northern
parts of Western Australia. If you aren’t staying in a major hotel, make
sure you ask about air-conditioning when you book, because it isn’t
always standard in lower-priced establishments — and in some places,
some rooms may have it, while others do not.
Smoking and nonsmoking rooms are usually available in most major
hotels, so if you can’t stand the smell of stale cigarette smoke, make sure
you book a nonsmoking room.
Breakfast is often (but not always) included in the room rate, so ask
when you book. If breakfast isn’t included, hotel breakfasts are notori-
ously expensive, so you may want to head to a cafe down the street.

Australian accommodations properties carry star ratings given by AAA
Tourism, which has been awarding ratings since the 1950s. Independent
assessments are based on facilities, amenities, maintenance, and cleanli-
ness. Ratings run from 1 to 5 stars. Stars are featured in AAA Tourism
guides, and recent research shows that 70 percent of travelers use the
star ratings when choosing their accommodations. (These star ratings
are noted in Table 8-1 using asterisks.) The rating scheme covers more
than 18,000 accommodations throughout every state and territory.

choice of dining facilities, 24-hour room service, housekeeping, and
valet parking are offered. Porter and concierge services are available,
as are dedicated business centers and conference facilities.
Staying in Style
Perhaps you’re someone who prefers the quality and consistency of a
hotel. You’ll have lots of styles and price ranges to choose from.
Hotels
The largest hotel group in Australia is the French chain Accor, which has
more than 100 properties (that’s about 15,000 rooms) under its Sofitel,
Novotel, Mercure, All Seasons, Ibis, and Formule 1 brands. The high-end
Sofitels can only be found in Sydney, Melbourne, and Brisbane, but the
other brands are spread throughout Australia, even in remote Outback
towns such as Kalgoorlie in Western Australia. Many other international
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Australia 
80

chains, such as Marriott, Sheraton, and Hilton, have properties in
Australia, mostly in the capital cities.
There is also a large range of smaller, independent and boutique hotels,
which offer a more personal service but perhaps less extensive facilities.
These are often charming and stylish, tucked away in quiet streets but
still within easy reach of the city centers.
In this book, listed rack rates are based on double occupancy for one
night. Sometimes this rate changes according to the season; in that 
case, we list each season’s rates when possible. Some hotel groups —
including Accor — use a “dynamic” room rate, which means the rate
changes on a daily basis, according to occupancy and demand. In these
case, we list rates as “from $x.” The best way of finding out the rate for
the time you want to stay is to go to the hotel’s Web site, which lists
exact prices for your stay, on the day you check. In Table 8-2, we give
you an idea of what you can expect in the way of furnishings and ameni-
ties based on the cost of your room.

Chapter 8: Booking Your Accommodations 81

Serviced apartments
Serviced apartments are popular with Australians, for their space and
flexibility. Families can to cook for themselves and business travelers
have space to entertain or hold meetings. Basically, a serviced apart-
ment is fully furnished, with one, two, or three bedrooms, a living room,
a kitchen or kitchenette, a laundry, and often two bathrooms — in other
words, all the facilities of a hotel suite and more, often for less than the
cost of a 4-star hotel room. (Not every apartment kitchen has a dish-
washer, so check if that’s important to you.) Cleaners will come in daily
(or in some cases weekly) to make your beds and clean.
Australia’s huge supply of apartments ranges from clean and comfort-
able, if a little dated, to luxurious. Most can be rented for one night,
especially in cities, but in popular vacation spots, some proprietors will
insist on a minimum three-night stay, or a week in high season.
Two of the biggest serviced apartment chains are
 Medina Serviced Apartments (% 1300/633 462 in Australia, or
02/9356 1000; www.medinaapartments.com.au), which has a chain
of midrange to upscale properties in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane,
Canberra, Adelaide, and Perth. A new property is scheduled to
open in Darwin in 2008.
 Quest Serviced Apartments (% 1800/334 033 in Australia, or
03/9645 8357; www.questapartments.com.au), has more than 100
properties in every state and territory, making it Australia’s largest
apartment chain.
You can also find apartment hotels, which offer similar services.
Motels and motor inns
Australia’s plentiful motels are neat and clean, if often a little dated.
They usually have air-conditioning, telephones, color TVs, clock radios,
minifridges or minibars, and self-serve tea and coffee. Most have only
showers, not bathtubs. Some have restaurants attached, and many have
swimming pools. Motor inns offer a greater range of facilities and, gener-
ally, a higher standard of rooms than motels. They’re a great option if
you’re driving long distances between destinations and want somewhere
affordable and basic to spend the night.
Bed-and-breakfast inns (B&Bs)
B&Bs range from cheap and cheerful family homes to luxury retreats
where breakfast is provided. You can easily find charming rooms for
under A$100 (US$80/£40) for a double. Bathroom facilities are some-
times shared, although more properties now offer private, if not always
en-suite (attached), bathrooms.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Australia 
82

The Australian Bed & Breakfast Book (www.bbbook.com.au) lists 
more than 400 B&Bs across Australia. Although the B&Bs pay to be 
in the book, they have to meet certain standards to be included. 
The entire book is posted on the Web site, and in Australia, it’s widely
available in bookshops and newsdealers, or you can order it direct 
(% 02/6658 5701) for A$20 (US$16/£8) plus A$15 (US$12/£6) for over-
seas express postage.
What Next? Productions Pty. Ltd. (% 0438/600 696 cell phone; www.
beautifulaccommodation.com) publishes a series of Beautiful Accom-
modation color guides listing around 500 exquisite properties in every
state and territory, many in charming country areas. The properties
listed are rather upscale, roughly in the A$150 to A$300 (US$120–
US$240/£60–£120) range. Each book sells for A$30 (US$24/£12) in
Australian bookstores and can be ordered online.
Another good Web site is that of Bed & Breakfast and Farmstay
Australia (www.australianbedandbreakfast.com.au), which has
links to all state B&B organizations.
Staying on an Aussie farm
For a truly Australian experience, and a chance to interact with families
who make their living from the land, opt for a farmstay. Most are farms
first, tourist operations second, but for many people — after years of
drought — diversifying into tourism has kept them going. You’ll find
your hosts eager to share their way of life and to learn about yours.
Accommodations may be anything from a basic bunkhouse (ask if it’s
air-conditioned, because most farms are in hot areas) to rustically luxu-
rious digs in a cottage or guesthouse. Do some research on the farm —
many activities are seasonal, some farmers will not allow you to get
involved in dangerous work because of insurance issues, not all will
offer horseback riding, and farm means different things in different parts
of Australia. If you like green fields and dairy cows, Victoria may be the
place for you. If checking fences on a 500,000-hectare (200,000-acre)
Outback station (ranch) sounds wildly romantic, head to Western
Australia, Queensland, or the Northern Territory.
Bed & Breakfast and Farmstay Australia’s Web site (www.australian
bedandbreakfast.com.au) is a good place to start. Another good 
contact is Accommodation Getaways Victoria (% 1300/132 358 in
Australia, or 03/9431 5417; www.agv.net.au). Bed & Breakfast and
Farmstay NT (www.bed-and-breakfast.au.com) lists about 20
Northern Territory properties in Darwin, the Top End, and the Red
Centre.
Meals are usually included, as you’re in a remote area, distant from the
nearest cafe or restaurant. Allow yourself a few days to get to know how
rural Australia lives.
Chapter 8: Booking Your Accommodations 83

Finding the Best Room at the Best Rate
The rack rate is the maximum rate that a hotel charges for a room and is
what you pay if you walk in off the street without a reservation. Hardly
anybody pays this price, however, except in high season or on holidays,
and there are many ways to lower the cost of your room.
Find out if there are special rates or other discounts that you may qual-
ify for, such as corporate, student, military, senior, frequent flier, or
other discounts. Your hotel may also offer special rates at weekends,
midweek, or other off-peak times. You can save big on hotel rooms by
traveling in a destination’s off season or shoulder seasons, when rates
typically drop, even at luxury properties.
When booking a room in a chain hotel, you often get a better deal by
calling the individual hotel’s reservation desk rather than the chain’s
main number. Booking online can also reap rewards, as many hotels
offer Internet-only discounts, or supply rooms to Priceline, Hotwire, or
Expedia at rates lower than the ones you can get through the hotel itself.
If you’re planning to stay in one place for a few days, ask about long-stay
discounts. Anything over about three days can attract a discount at cer-
tain resorts, especially in Queensland. Many offer “Stay 5, Pay 4” deals
and similar for differing lengths of stay. Many B&B operators also offer
weekly rates as well as nightly.
Watch out for hidden costs. Ask about local taxes and service charges,
which can increase the cost of a room by 10 percent or more. When you
book a room, ask what’s included in the room rate and what’s extra. If
you’re staying in a resort, ask if you’ll be charged for beach chairs,
towels, sports equipment, and other amenities.
Consider the pros and cons of all-inclusive packages, usually offered at
resorts. All-inclusive means different things at different places. Many all-
inclusive packages include three meals daily, sports equipment, spa
treatments, and other amenities; others may include most alcoholic
drinks. In general, you save money going the all-inclusive way — as long
as you use the facilities provided. The downside is that your choices are
limited to what the resort has to offer.
Sign up to a hotel chain’s frequent-stay loyalty program, in which you
can accumulate points or credits to earn free hotel nights, airline miles,
in-room amenities, merchandise, tickets to concerts and events, and dis-
counts on sporting facilities. Many hotels operating in Australia, includ-
ing Hilton and Marriott, offer rewards programs.
Surfing the Web for hotel deals
In addition to online travel booking sites such as Travelocity, Expedia,
Orbitz, Priceline, and Hotwire, you can book hotels through Hotels.com,
Quikbook (www.quikbook.com), and Travelaxe (www.travelaxe.net).

HotelChatter.com is a daily Webzine offering smart coverage and cri-
tiques of hotels worldwide. Go to TripAdvisor.com or HotelShark.com
for independent consumer reviews of hotels and resorts.
Be sure to get a confirmation number and make a printout of any online
booking transaction, just in case you show up at the hotel and it doesn’t
have a record of your reservation.
Reserving the best room
Somebody has to get the best room in the house, so it may as well be
you. Start by joining the hotel’s frequent-guest program, which may
make you eligible for upgrades. A hotel-branded credit card usually
gives its owner silver or gold status in frequent-guest programs.
Make sure you ask lots of questions when you’re making your booking.
Ask about a corner room, which is often larger and quieter, with more
windows and light, but for the same price as a standard room. Ask if the
hotel is renovating; if it is, request a room away from the construction.
Ask for a room that has been recently renovated or refurbished. Ask
about nonsmoking rooms and rooms with views. Be sure to request your
choice of twin, queen-, or king-size beds. If you’re a light sleeper, ask for
a quiet room away from vending or ice machines, elevators, restaurants,
bars, and discos.
If you aren’t happy with your room when you arrive, ask for a different
one. Most places will happily oblige.
In resort areas such as Queensland, ask the following questions before
you book a room:
Chapter 8: Booking Your Accommodations 85
Swapping houses with an Aussie
You stay in their house, and they stay in yours. House-swapping is becoming a more
popular and viable means of travel, and it’s certainly the case with Australians. You
both get an authentic and personal view of the area you’re visiting.
To find a compatible swap, try HomeLink International (www.homelink.org), the
largest and oldest home-swapping organization, founded in 1952, with over 11,000 list-
ings worldwide (US$90 for a yearly membership). There is a branch of HomeLink in
Australia. Others with lots of Australian properties to choose from are Homefor
Exchange.com (US$59 for six months), InterVac.com (US$95 for one year), and the
U.K.-based Home Base Holidays (www.homebase-hols.com), where you can
browse the listings for free but must pay £29 for a year to view the contact details or
to list your home.

 What’s the view like? If you’re on a budget, you may be willing to
pay less for a room with no view (or with a view of the parking lot),
especially if you don’t plan to spend much time in your room.
 Does the room have air-conditioning or ceiling fans? Do the win-
dows open? If the room has no air-conditioning, you want windows
that open. But if the windows open, and the nighttime entertain-
ment is nearby, you may want to find out when showtime is over.
 How far is the room from the beach and other amenities? If it’s
far, is there transportation to and from the beach, and is it free?

hether you want to find out how easy it will be to travel with kids
in Australia, or how you can get a senior discount, this section
has information designed to help travelers with special needs work out
the best options for their visit. Or maybe you’re just keen to find out
where the best bird-watching or diving is? We cover that as well.
Traveling with the Brood: Advice for Families
Australians travel widely with their own kids, so the whole country is
pretty family-friendly. Generally, facilities for families are good and you’ll
find most tourist attractions offer money-saving family passes. I’ve taken
my kids to all sorts of places and have generally found little to complain
about (despite mixed reviews from them!). Make it fun, and everyone
has a good time.
Some online resources for planning family travel include Family Travel
Forum (www.familytravelforum.com), a comprehensive site that
offers customized trip planning; Family Travel Network (www.family
travelnetwork.com), an online magazine providing travel tips; and
TravelWithYourKids.com (www.travelwithyourkids.com), a site writ-
ten by parents for parents offering sound advice for long-distance and
international travel with children. Australian travel magazine Holidays
with Kids has a comprehensive Web site listing great options for family

travel in Australia at www.holidayswithkids.com.au. Rascals in
Paradise (% 415-921-7000; www.rascalsinparadise.com) sells family
vacation packages to Australia.
For accommodations, families can’t do better than to book into one of
the huge range of serviced or unserviced apartments (with or without
daily maid service). Usually less expensive than a hotel room, they offer
a lot more living space — a living room, a kitchen, a bathroom or two,
and the privacy of a separate bedroom for adults.
Many Australian resorts have kids’ clubs with extensive programs
designed for under-12s and, in some cases, teenagers. The French-owned
Accor chain of hotels and resorts has kids’ clubs, kids’ menus designed
by a nutritionist, and other family-friendly facilities including family
rooms. Other resorts, such as Hamilton Island, have “kids stay, eat, and
play free” offers, particularly during holiday periods. Many hotels offer
connecting units or family rooms. Ask when booking.
International airlines and domestic airlines in Australia charge 75 per-
cent of the adult fare for kids under 12. Most charge 10 percent for
infants under 2 not occupying a seat. Australian transport companies,
attractions, and tour operators usually charge half-price for kids under
12 or 14 years.
Children entering Australia with their parents still need their own visas,
as well as passports.
Making Age Work for You: Tips for Seniors
Visiting seniors from other countries often don’t qualify for discounted
entry to tours, attractions, and events in Australia; that privilege is usu-
ally reserved only for Australian seniors (also called pensioners). But it
always pays to inquire about discounts when booking hotels, flights, and
train or bus tickets. The best ID to bring is something that shows your
date of birth or something that marks you as an “official” senior, like a
membership card from AARP.
Members of AARP, 601 E St. NW, Washington, DC 20049 (% 888-687-
2277; www.aarp.org), get discounts on hotels, airfares, and car rentals.
AARP offers members a wide range of benefits, including AARP: The
Magazine and a newsletter. Anyone over 50 can join.
Many reliable agencies and organizations target the 50-plus market.
Elderhostel (% 800-454-5768; www.elderhostel.org) arranges world-
wide study programs for those aged 55 and over.

magazine for those over 50 and the official Seniors Card travel magazine
(www.getupandgo.com.au). It’s a glossy quarterly, available at most

Accessing Australia: Advice for 
Travelers with Disabilities
Most hotels, major stores, attractions, and public restrooms in Australia
have wheelchair access. Many smaller lodges and even B&Bs are start-
ing to cater to guests with disabilities, and some diving companies cater
to scuba divers with disabilities. National parks make an effort to include
wheelchair-friendly pathways, too. Taxi companies in bigger cities can
usually supply a cab equipped for wheelchairs.
TTY facilities are still limited largely to government services. For infor-
mation on all kinds of facilities and services (not just travel-related
organizations) for people with disabilities, contact National Information
Communication Awareness Network, P.O. Box 407, Curtin, ACT 2605
(% 1800/806 769 voice and TTY in Australia, or 02/6285 3713; www.

Following the Rainbow: Resources 
for Gay and Lesbian Travelers
Sydney is one of the most gay-friendly cities in the world. There are
plenty of gay and lesbian bars, and most Saturday nights see a privately
operated gay dance party taking place in an inner-city warehouse some-
where. The cafes and pubs of Oxford Street in Darlinghurst, a short cab
ride or long stroll from Sydney’s downtown area, are the liveliest areas.
The annual Sydney Gay & Lesbian Mardi Gras, culminating in a huge
street parade and party in late February or early March, is a high point
on the city’s calendar and is attended by huge crowds.
In rural areas, you still find some resistance to gays and lesbians, but
Australians are generally tolerant. Noosa, on Queensland’s Sunshine
Coast, is a favored destination for revelers after the Sydney Mardi 
Gras, and a couple of resorts in North Queensland cater to gay and 
lesbian travelers. One of the best known is Turtle Cove Resort & Spa
(% 1300/727 979 in Australia, or 07/4059 1800; www.turtlecove.
com.au), on a private beach between Cairns and Port Douglas.
The LGBT community has lots of support services in Australia. The Gay
& Lesbian Counselling Service of NSW (% 02/8594 9500 for the admin-
istration office) runs a national hot line (% 1800/184 527 in Australia,
or 02/8594 9596) from 7:30 to 10 p.m. daily. Its Web site (www.glccs.
org.au) has contact information for each state. In Sydney, the Albion
Street Centre (% 02/9332 9600 administration, or 02/9332 9700 infor-
mation line) is an AIDS clinic and information service.
The International Gay and Lesbian Travel Association (IGLTA; % 800-
448-8550 or 954-776-2626; www.iglta.org) is the trade association for
the gay and lesbian travel industry, and offers an online directory of 
gay- and lesbian-friendly travel businesses and tour operators. Gay &
Lesbian Tourism Australia (www.galta.com.au) also has listings of
useful businesses in each state.

Active Australia: Where to Go for the Gusto
Outdoor pursuits are high on the list of many visitors to Australia, lured
by the wide-open spaces and a climate ideal for exploring and experienc-
ing the great activities on offer. Whether it’s a gentle occupation like
bird-watching, or the thrill of white-water rafting, Australia is sure to
have an activity that suits you.
Most operators and outfitters listed in this book specialize in adventure
vacations for small groups. The Great Outdoor Recreation Pages
(GORP) site (http://gorp.away.com) not only has links to adventure-
tour operators in Australia, but also contains articles, sells books and
maps, and has links to heaps of sites on Australia with an action slant.
Outer Edge Expeditions (% 800-322-5235 or 517-552-5300; www.outer-
edge.com) and The World Outdoors (% 800-488-8483 or 303-413-0938;
www.theworldoutdoors.com) offer ecologically minded multisport
diving, hiking, biking, canoeing, and kayaking packages to the Great
Barrier Reef and North Queensland rain forest.
Meals, accommodations, equipment rental, and guides are usually
included, though international airfares are not. Where you end up 
resting your head at night varies depending on the package — on a sea-
kayaking trip, you’ll likely be camping on a beach; on a hiking expedi-
tion, you may stay at a wilderness lodge; and on a biking trip you often
stop at B&B-style lodgings. Remember to check the regional chapters in
this book for more information on the outdoor activities in the area
you’re visiting.
Chapter 9: Catering to Special Needs or Interests 91

Scuba diving
Diving on the Great Barrier Reef is a major attraction for visitors to
Australia — whether they’re experienced divers or not. What is less well
known is that there are good dive sites all around the Australian coast,
not just off Queensland. A second barrier reef, in Ningaloo Reef Marine
Park, stretches 260km (161 miles) off the coast of Western Australia. In
Tasmania, you can dive kelp beds popular with seals, and in South
Australia you can cage-dive with great white sharks.
Wherever you find coral in Australia, you find dive companies offering
learn-to-dive courses, day trips, and, in some cases, extended journeys
on live-aboard vessels. Most international dive certificates, including
PADI, NAUI, SSI, and BSAC, are recognized. You can rent gear and wet
suits wherever you go.
Remember to allow time in your itinerary for a medical exam in
Australia. If you’re already a certified diver, be sure to bring your “C”
card and log book. If you’re going to take a dive course, you’ll need a
medical certificate from an Australian doctor stating that you’re fit for
scuba diving. (An all-purpose physical is not enough.) Almost all the
dive schools will arrange the medical exam for you.
You must complete your last dive 24 hours before you fly in an aircraft.
This catches a lot of people off-guard when they’re preparing to fly to
their next destination the day after a visit to the Reef. You won’t be able
to helicopter off the Reef back to the mainland, either.
Check to see if your travel insurance covers diving. The Divers Alert
Network (% 800-446-2671; www.diversalertnetwork.org) sells
diving insurance and has diving and nondiving medical emergency hot
lines, and an information line for dive-related medical questions.
If you’ve never been diving and don’t plan to become qualified, you can
see what all the fuss is about on an “introductory” dive that lets you
dive in the company of an instructor on a one-time basis, with a briefing
beforehand. Most dive operators on the Great Barrier Reef and other
dive locations offer introductory dives.
For information on dive regions and operators, try the state tourism
marketing boards’ Web sites. Tourism Queensland’s Web site (www.
queenslandholidays.com.au) has information on most dive operators
to the Great Barrier Reef. Dive Queensland (% 07/4051 1510; fax 07/
4051 1519; www.dive-queensland.com.au), the Queensland Dive
Tourism Association, requires its member operators to abide by a code
of ethics. Its Web site has a list of members and the services they offer.
Another good source is Diversion Dive Travel (% 1800/607 913 in
Australia, or 07/4039 0200; www.diversionoz.com), a Cairns-based
travel agent that specializes in dive holidays on the Great Barrier Reef
and other places. It books day trips and extended excursions on a
choice of live-aboard vessels, as well as dive courses, island resorts with
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Australia 
92

diving, accommodations, and non-diving tours. It also sells diving insur-
ance. Its proprietors are dive instructors, and one of them is trained as a
handicapped diving instructor for divers with disabilities.
Bushwalking (hiking)
Australia has many national parks crisscrossed with hiking trails. You’re
never far from a park with a bushwalk, whether it’s an easy stroll, or a
six-day odyssey on the Cape-to-Cape trail in Western Australia. A good
Australian bushwalking Web site is www.bushwalking.org.au.
Some parks charge an entry fee, ranging from A$6 to A$18 (US$4.80–
US$14/£2.40–£7.20). The best place to get information about bushwalk-
ing is the National Parks & Wildlife Service, or its equivalent in each
state:
 Environmental Protection Agency (Queensland Parks & Wildlife
Service; % 07/3227 8185; www.epa.qld.gov.au).
 New South Wales National Parks & Wildlife Service (www.
nationalparks.nsw.gov.au). It has a visitor information center
at Cadmans Cottage, 110 George St., The Rocks, Sydney (% 02/
9247 5033).
 Parks & Wildlife Commission of the Northern Territory (% 08/
8999 4555; www.nt.gov.au/nreta/parks). The Northern
Territory Tourist Commission is the official source of information
on parks and wildlife matters.
 Parks Victoria (% 13 19 63; www.parkweb.vic.gov.au).
 South Australian Department for Environment and Heritage
(% 08/8204 9010; www.environment.sa.gov.au).
 Tasmania Parks and Wildlife Service (% 1300/368 550 in
Australia, or 03/6233 8011; www.dpiwe.tas.gov.au).
 Western Australian Department of Environment and
Conservation (% 08/9334 0333; www.naturebase.net).
Auswalk (% 03/5356 4971; www.auswalk.com.au) offers self-guided or
escorted/accommodated walking tours through picturesque parts of
Australia such as the Great Ocean Road in Victoria, Lamington National
Park Island in Queensland, and the Red Centre and the Blue Mountains
in New South Wales.
World Expeditions (% 415-989-2212 in the U.S., 613-241-2700 in Canada,
1300/720 000 in Australia; www.worldexpeditions.com.au) runs ex-
peditions to destinations less traveled, such as Hinchinbrook Island in
the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park and the long-distance Bibbulmun
Track in Western Australia’s southwest. Some trips incorporate other
pursuits, like rafting, sailing, or biking.
Chapter 9: Catering to Special Needs or Interests 93

Biking
Much of Australia’s countryside is flat and ideal for cycling (as Aussies
call biking) and there are plenty of trails. Just remember that you often
have to cope with heat and long distances. The rain forest hills behind
Cairns hosted the world mountain-biking championships in 1996, and
Sydney’s Blue Mountains have good mountain-biking trails. All major
towns and most resort centers rent regular bikes and mountain bikes.
Remote Outback Cycle Tours (% 08/9279 6969; www.cycletours.
com.au) takes novice and expert riders of all ages on tours across the
country. The distances are vast, but the trip combines cycling with four-
wheel-drive travel. Itineraries include trips in the Red Centre, including
the Oodnadatta Track cattle-driving route from Alice Springs to Adelaide
via the opal-mining town of Coober Pedy in South Australia.
Bird-watching
Australia’s geography as an island continent means it also has unique
bird species. It’s probably best known for its brilliant parrots, but you’ll
see species from the wetlands, savanna, mulga scrub, desert, oceans,
dense bushland, rain forest, mangroves, rivers, and other habitats. More
than half of the country’s species have been spotted in the Daintree
Rainforest area in north Queensland, and one-third live in wetlands-rich
Kakadu National Park in the Top End. 
Kirrama Wildlife Tours (% 07/4065 5181; www.kirrama.com.au) oper-
ates birding expeditions to remote regions in northern Australia from a
base in North Queensland. Broome-based ornithologist George Swann of
Kimberley Birdwatching, Wildlife & Natural History Tours (% 08/
9192 1246; www.kimberleybirdwatching.com.au) leads extended
birding trips throughout the Kimberley and the Northern Territory. Fine
Feather Tours (% 07/4094 1199; www.finefeathertours.com.au),
based near Port Douglas near the Daintree Rainforest, operates bird-
watching day trips and afternoon river cruises. To get in touch with bird-
ing clubs all over Australia, contact Birds Australia (% 1300/730 075 in
Australia, or 03/9347 0757; www.birdsaustralia.com.au).
Canoeing and sea kayaking
Katherine Gorge in the Northern Territory offers some spectacular flat
canoeing, and you’ll also find delightful canoeing on the bird-rich Ord
River in the Top End. Both are full of generally harmless freshwater 
crocodiles, but never canoe in saltwater-crocodile territory. Operators
all around the coastline rent kayaks and lead guided expeditions.
Popular spots are the Whitsunday Islands in north Queensland, the 
cold southern seas around Tasmania, and Byron Bay, where you can 
take a three-hour “dolphin kayaking” trip to see wild dolphins (and
whales June–Oct) and “kayak-surf” the waves.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Australia 
94

Rivergods (% 08/9259 0749; www.rivergods.com.au) conducts multi-
day sea-kayaking, canoeing, and white-water-rafting adventures through-
out Western Australia’s pristine ocean and rivers, in which whales,
sharks, dugongs (manatees), sea snakes, turtles, and dolphins abound.
The company also runs a “sea kayak with wild seals” day outing from
Perth. Gecko Canoeing (% 1800/634 319 in Australia, or 08/8972 2224;
www.geckocanoeing.com.au) leads canoeing trips of one to seven days
along remote Top End rivers between April and September.
Fishing
Reef, game, deep sea, beach, estuary, and river fishing — Australia’s
massive coastline lets you do it all. Drop a line for coral trout on the
Great Barrier Reef; go for the world-record black marlin off Cairns; 
hook a fighting “barra” (barramundi) in the Northern Territory or the
Kimberley; or cast for trout in Tasmania’s highland lakes. Charter boats
will take you out for the day from most towns all around the coast.
Golf
Australians are passionate about golf, and courses abound. Queensland
has the lion’s share of the stunning resort courses, such as the Sheraton
Mirage in Port Douglas, Laguna Quays Resort near the Whitsundays, and
the Hyatt Regency Sanctuary Cove Resort on the Gold Coast. The Gold
Coast has more than 40 courses. One of the world’s best desert courses
is at Alice Springs.
Most courses rent clubs for around A$30 (US$24/£12). Greens fees start
at around A$20 (US$16/£8) for 18 holes but average A$65 (US$52/£26) or
more on a championship course. Koala Golf (% 1300/301 686 in
Australia, or 02/9746 6646; www.koalagolf.com) offers escorted day
trips and package tours to excellent golf courses in major cities and holi-
day areas around Australia.
Sailing
The 74 islands of the Whitsundays in Queensland provide a spectacular
backdrop for a sailing holiday. And you don’t have to join an organized
cruise or tour; the Whitsunday region is Australia’s bareboating capital,
which means you can charter an unskippered yacht and sail yourself,
even if you’re not an experienced sailor (for more detailed information
on bareboating, see Chapter 17).

some time, so if you don’t have one, or if yours has expired, apply for
one in the early stages of planning your trip. Processing has been par-
ticularly slow recently, so give yourself at least a couple months to get
or renew yours. You can expedite it — by paying a hefty surcharge.
For an up-to-date, country-by-country listing of passport requirements
around the world, go to the “Foreign Entry Requirement” Web page of
the U.S. State Department at http://travel.state.gov.
To enter Australia, each person in your party (including children) will
also need a visa (see information about getting a visa below).

Applying for a U.S. passport
If you’re applying for a passport for the first time, follow these steps:
1. Complete a passport application in person at a U.S. passport
office; a federal, state, or probate court; or a major post office.
To find your regional passport office, check the U.S. State
Department Web site or call the National Passport Information
Center (% 877-487-2778) for automated information.
2. Present a certified birth certificate as proof of citizenship.
You may also want to bring along your driver’s license, state or 
military ID, or Social Security card.
3. Submit two identical photos, measuring 2 x 2 inches.
4. Submit the processing fee at the time you apply.
For people 16 and over, a passport is valid for ten years and costs
$85. For those travelers 15 and under, a passport is valid for five
years and costs $70.
If you have a passport in your current name that was issued within the
past 15 years (and you were over age 16 when it was issued), you can
renew it by mail for $67. Whether you’re applying in person or by mail,
you can download passport applications from the U.S. State Department
Web site at http://travel.state.gov.
Applying for passports in other countries
The following list offers information for citizens of Canada, the United
Kingdom, and Ireland:
 Canadians can obtain passport applications from travel agencies
throughout Canada or from the central Passport Office, Depart-
ment of Foreign Affairs and International Trade, Ottawa, ON K1A
0G3 (% 800-567-6868; www.ppt.gc.ca).
 British citizens can pick up an application for a standard ten-year
passport (five-year passport for children under 16), visit your near-
est passport office, major post office, or travel agency or contact
the United Kingdom Passport Service (% 0870/521-0410; www.
ukpa.gov.uk).
 Irish citizens can apply for a ten-year passport at the Passport
Office, Setanta Centre, Molesworth Street, Dublin 2 (% 01/671-
1633; www.irlgov.ie/iveagh). Those under age 18 and over 65
must apply for a three-year passport. You can also apply at 1A
South Mall, Cork (% 021/272-525), or at most post offices.

Getting a visa for your trip to Australia
Along with a current passport valid for the duration of your stay, the
Australian government requires a visa from visitors of every nation,
except New Zealand, to be issued before you arrive. If you’re a short-
term visitor or business traveler, the process is easy and can be done 
in a few minutes on the Internet, using the Australian government’s
Electronic Travel Authority (ETA), an electronic visa that takes the
place of a stamp in your passport.
Tourists should apply for a Visitor ETA. The visa is free (though there is
a service charge for getting it via the Internet), and it’s valid for visits to
Australia of up to three months each within a one-year period. Tourists
may not work in Australia. If you’re visiting for business, you have two
choices: Apply for a Short Validity Business ETA, which covers a single
visit of three months within a one-year period, or pay A$70 (US$56/£28)
to apply for a Long Validity Business visa, which entitles you to as many
three-month stays in Australia as you like for the life of your passport
but cannot be done online.
You can apply for an ETA yourself, or have your travel agent or airline do
it when you book your plane ticket. (This service may incur an addi-
tional fee from the airline or travel agent.) To apply online, visit www.
eta.immi.gov.au; the A$20 (US$16/£8) charge is payable by credit card
(Amex, Diners Club, MasterCard, or Visa). Assuming you do not have a
criminal conviction and are in good health, your ETA should be approved
quickly. You can also apply for the visa at Australian embassies, high
commissions, and consulates. Everyone traveling with you (including
children) must have his own visa.
Fees mentioned in this section are in Australian dollars; the exact
amount charged by the Australian embassy, consulate, or high commis-
sion in your country will depend on the foreign currency exchange rate.
In the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Ireland, and many
other countries, most travel agents and airlines are ETA-compatible.
Guard your passport well. Keep it with you at all times, or keep it locked
up in a hotel safe. You’ll need it when converting traveler’s checks or for-
eign currency, but otherwise kept it in a safe place.
Dealing with a lost passport
Losing your passport is not the end of the world, but replacing a lost or
stolen passport should be dealt with immediately. First, report it to the
police. Then contact the nearest consulate or high commission office
and begin to take the necessary steps to get a new one. For the
addresses of consulates and high commissions, see the appendix.

Playing It Safe: Travel and Medical Insurance
There are three kinds of travel insurance, and you should seriously con-
sider them all: medical, trip cancellation, and lost luggage insurance.
Costs vary widely, depending on the cost and length of your trip, your
age and health, and the type of trip you’re taking. There’s an old saying:
“If you can’t afford the insurance, you can’t afford to travel.” Take it from
me, as someone who once required emergency surgery while overseas,
the insurance is well worth it!
 Trip-cancellation insurance: This insurance helps you retrieve
your money if you have to back out of a trip, if you have to return
home early, or if your travel supplier goes bankrupt. It usually
covers such events as sickness, natural disasters, and State
Department advisories that your destination is unsafe for travel.
The latest news in trip-cancellation insurance is the availability 
of expanded hurricane coverage and the any-reason cancellation
coverage — which costs more but covers cancellations made for
any reason. You won’t get back 100 percent of your prepaid trip
cost, but you’ll be refunded a substantial portion.
TravelSafe (% 888-885-7233; www.travelsafe.com) offers both
types of coverage. Expedia also offers any-reason cancellation cov-
erage for its air-hotel packages. For details, contact one of the fol-
lowing recommended insurers: Access America (% 866-807-3982;
www.accessamerica.com), Travel Guard International (% 800-
826-4919; www.travelguard.com), Travel Insured International
(% 800-243-3174; www.travelinsured.com), or Travelex Insur-
ance Services (% 888-457-4602; www.travelex-insurance.com).
 Medical insurance: For travel overseas, most U.S. health plans
(including Medicare and Medicaid) do not provide coverage, and
the ones that do often require you to pay for services upfront and
reimburse you only after you return home. As a safety net, you may
want to buy travel medical insurance, particularly if you’re travel-
ing to a remote or high-risk area where emergency evacuation may
be necessary.
Australia’s immense distances mean you can sometimes be a long
way from a hospital or a doctor. Make sure your policy covers 
medical evacuation by helicopter or Australia’s Royal Flying Doctor
Service airlift. (You may well need this if you become sick or
injured in the Outback.) Very few health insurance plans pay for
medical evacuation back to the United States (which can cost
US$10,000 and up). A number of companies offer medical evacua-
tion services anywhere in the world.
If you’re ever hospitalized more than 150 miles from home,
MedjetAssist (% 800-527-7478; www.medjetassistance.com) will
pick you up and fly you to the hospital of your choice anywhere in
the world in a medically equipped and staffed aircraft 24 hours day,
Chapter 10: Taking Care of the Remaining Details 99

7 days a week. Annual memberships are US$225 individual, US$350
family; you can also purchase short-term memberships.
Australia has a reciprocal medical-care agreement with Great
Britain and a limited agreement with Ireland and New Zealand,
which covers travelers for medical expenses for immediately nec-
essary treatment in a public hospital (but not evacuation to your
home country, ambulances, funerals, and dental care). Australia’s
national health system, called Medicare, is similar to the program
by the same name in the United States. Having insurance is crucial,
though, because medical care in Australia is expensive, and the
national healthcare system typically covers only 85 percent of
treatment (sometimes less). You won’t be covered for treatment in
a private hospital, and evacuation insurance is a must.
If you decide on additional medical insurance, try MEDEX
Assistance (% 410-453-6300; www.medexassist.com) or
Travel Assistance International (% 800-821-2828; www.travel
assistance.com). For general information on Travel Assistance
International services, call the company’s Worldwide Assistance
Services, Inc., at % 800-777-8710.
Canadians should check with their provincial health plan offices or
call Health Canada (% 866-225-0709; www.hc-sc.gc.ca) to find
out the extent of their coverage and what documentation and
receipts they must take home in case they’re treated overseas.
 Lost luggage insurance: On international flights (including U.S. por-
tions of international trips), baggage coverage is limited to approxi-
mately US$9.07 per pound, up to approximately US$635 per checked
bag. If you plan to check items more valuable than what’s covered
by the standard liability, see if your homeowner’s policy covers
your valuables, get baggage insurance as part of your comprehen-
sive travel-insurance package, or buy Travel Guard’s BagTrak 
product.
If your luggage is lost, immediately file a lost-luggage claim at the
airport. Most airlines require that you report delayed, damaged, or
lost baggage within four hours of arrival. The airlines are required
to deliver luggage, once found, directly to your house or destina-
tion free of charge.
Staying Healthy When You Travel
Australian hygiene standards are high, hospitals are modern and well
equipped, and doctors are well qualified, so you don’t have to worry too
much about illness on a trip Down Under. You don’t need any vaccina-
tions to enter Australia (unless you’re coming via Africa or South
America, when you’ll need a Yellow Fever vaccination certificate).
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Australia 
100

But if you’re traveling in remote Outback areas, you can sometimes be a
long way from a hospital or a doctor. Even with the Royal Flying Doctor
Service to help you, medical travel insurance (see the preceding sec-
tion) may be advisable. Australian pharmacists may only fill prescrip-
tions written by Australian doctors, so carry enough medication with
you for your trip.
Spiders, snakes, and other beasties
Snake and spider bites may not be as common as the hair-raising stories
you’ll hear would suggest, but snakes are commonly encountered —
especially if you’re hiking or camping — and it pays to be wary.
Australia’s two deadly spiders are the large hairy funnel web and the
tiny red-back, which has a distinctive red slash on its back. If you’re
bitten, keep calm; moving as little as possible may save your life.
Immobilize the limb and wrap that whole section of the limb tightly (but
not tight enough to restrict blood flow). Then head to the nearest hospi-
tal, where antivenin should be available.
Hikers should check for ticks, which are common. If you find one, dab it
with methylated spirits or some other noxious chemical. Wait a while,
and then gently and carefully pull it out with tweezers, ensuring you
don’t leave its head inside the wound.
Marine stingers, or box jellyfish, inhabit the coastal waters of the north-
ern third of Australia in summer. Their painful sting can cause heart 
failure and death. If you’re stung, pour vinegar over the affected site
immediately — local authorities leave bottles of vinegar on the beach for
this purpose. On beaches in Sydney and other areas, you may come
across blue bottles (which are sometimes also called stingers but are not
the same as the jellyfish found in northern waters). These long-tentacled
blue jellyfish (also known as Portuguese men-of-war) inflict a generally
harmless but painful sting that can last for hours. The best remedy is to
rinse the stung area in seawater or fresh water to remove any tentacles.
For intense pain, apply heat or cold, whichever feels better. If you experi-
ence breathing difficulties or disorientation following a jellyfish sting,
seek medical attention immediately.
Other things to avoid in the water include stingrays, stonefish (which 
as their name suggests look like stones, so don’t walk on underwater
“rocks”), lionfish, puffer fish, blue-ringed octopus (it has blue circles all
over its body), and cone shells (a shellfish shaped like a blunt cone).
There are two types of crocodiles in Australia: the freshwater crocodile,
which grows to almost 3m (10 ft.), and the dangerous estuarine (or salt-
water) crocodile, which reaches 5 to 7m (17–23 ft.). Freshwater crocs are
considered harmless; estuarine crocs are definitely not. They are called
“saltwater” crocs but live mostly in freshwater rivers, wetlands, gorges,
and billabongs (ponds). Estuarine crocs are very dangerous, move
quickly, and can remain unseen just below the surface of the water; few
people survive an attack. Never swim into, or stand near the bank of,
Chapter 10: Taking Care of the Remaining Details 101

any river, swamp, or pool in the northern third of Australia, unless you
know for certain it’s croc-free, and don’t swim at beaches near stream or
river mouths.
Slip, slop, slap in the sun
Australians have the world’s highest death rate from skin cancer. So
here, we say, “Slip on a shirt, slop on the sunscreen, and slap on a hat”
to limit your exposure to the sun. This is especially important during 
the first few days of your trip, and from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. in summer and
10 a.m. to 2 p.m. in winter. Remember that UV rays reflected off walls,
water, and the ground can burn you even when you’re not in direct sun-
light. Use a broad-spectrum sunscreen with a high protection factor (SPF
30 or higher). Wear a broad-brimmed hat that covers the back of your
neck, ears, and face (a baseball cap won’t cut it), and a long-sleeved
shirt. Remember that children need more protection than adults do.
Don’t even think about traveling without sunglasses, or you’ll spend
your entire vacation squinting into Australia’s harsh light.
Staying Connected by Cellphone
Some people love the idea of getting away from it all and being in a place
with no cellphone reception. For others, it’s unthinkable. In some remote
areas and a few island resorts, you’ll be without reception whether you
like it or not. But mostly, staying connected is easy.
The three letters that define much of the world’s wireless capabilities
are GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications), a big, seamless
network that makes for easy cross-border cellphone use in many coun-
tries worldwide. In the United States, T-Mobile, AT&T Wireless, and
Cingular use this quasi-universal system; in Canada, Microcell and some
Rogers customers are GSM; and all Europeans and most Australians use
GSM. GSM phones function with a removable plastic SIM card, encoded
with your phone number and account information. If your cellphone is
on a GSM system and you have a world-capable multiband phone such
as many Sony Ericsson, Motorola, or Samsung models, you can make
and receive calls across civilized areas around much of the globe. Just
call your wireless operator and ask for international roaming to be acti-
vated on your account. Unfortunately, per-minute charges can be high.
If you decide to rent a cellphone — called mobile phones in Australia —
you can do it easily. You can rent a phone from any number of overseas
sites, including kiosks at airports and at car rental agencies, but we sug-
gest renting the phone before you leave home. North Americans can rent
one from InTouch USA (% 800-872-7626; www.intouchglobal.com) or
RoadPost (% 888-290-1606 or 905-272-5665; www.roadpost.com).
InTouch will also, for free, advise you on whether your existing phone
will work overseas; simply call % 703-222-7161 between 9 a.m. and 
4 p.m. EST, or go to http://intouchglobal.com/travel.htm.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Australia 
102

In Australia, mobile phone company Vodafone (% 1300/365 360; www.
vodarent.com.au) has outlets at Brisbane, Cairns, and Melbourne inter-
national airports, and at Sydney and Perth international and domestic
airports, and a store in Southport on the Gold Coast. They cost A$5 to
A$8 (US$4–US$6.40/£2–£3.20) per day, plus call charges and insurance,
depending on the kind of phone and coverage you want. You can rent a
SIM card for A$1 (US$0.80/£0.40) per day or A$15 (US$12/£6) per month.
Australia’s cell network is digital, not analog. Calls to or from a mobile
telephone are generally more expensive than calls to or from a land line.
The price varies depending on the carrier, the time of day, the distance
between caller and recipient, and the telephone’s pricing plan.
Buying a prepaid phone can be a good deal. After you arrive, stop by a
local cellphone shop and get the cheapest package; you’ll probably pay
less than $100 for a phone and a starter calling card.
Accessing the Internet away from Home
Aside from cybercafes, most youth hostels and public libraries have
Internet access. Avoid hotel business centers unless you’re willing to
pay exorbitant rates. Cybercafes (also called Internet cafes in Australia)
can be found almost everywhere. Major tourist cities like Cairns and
Darwin have whole streets lined with them, and even smaller places like
Broome have a few to choose from. To find cybercafes in your destina-
tion check www.cybercaptive.com and www.cybercafe.com.
Most major airports have Internet kiosks that provide basic Web access
for a per-minute fee that’s usually higher than cybercafe prices. Check
out copy shops like Kinko’s (http://fedex.kinkos.com), which offers
computer stations with fully loaded software (as well as Wi-Fi). It has
stores in Sydney and Melbourne.
More and more hotels, resorts, airports, cafes, and retailers are going
Wi-Fi (wireless fidelity), becoming “hotspots” that offer free high-speed
Wi-Fi access or charge a small fee for usage. Most laptops sold today
have built-in wireless capability. To find public Wi-Fi hotspots at your
destination, go to www.jiwire.com; its Hotspot Finder holds the world’s
largest directory of public wireless hotspots.
For dial-up access, most business-class hotels throughout Australia offer
dataports for laptop modems, and some of them offer free high-speed
Internet access. Even smaller bed-and-breakfasts these days often have
Wi-Fi access or dial-up from the phone in your room.
Wherever you go, bring a connection kit of the right power and phone
adapters, a spare phone cord, and a spare Ethernet network cable — or
find out whether your hotel supplies them to guests (many don’t, or will
charge you a fee for them).
Chapter 10: Taking Care of the Remaining Details 103

Australia’s electricity supply is 240 volts, 50 Hz. North Americans and
Europeans need to buy a converter before they leave home, because
Australian stores usually only stock converters for Aussie appliances to
fit American and European outlets.
Keeping Up with Airline Security Measures
If you arrive at the airport at least one hour before a domestic flight and
two hours before an international flight, you’ll generally have plenty of
time to get through the security checkpoints. You can check the average
wait times at your airport by going to the Transportation Security
Administration Security Checkpoint Wait Times site (http://wait
time/tsa.dhs.gov).
Beat the ticket-counter lines by using the self-service electronic ticket
kiosks at the airport or printing out your boarding pass at home from
the airline Web site. Using curbside check-in is also a smart way to avoid
lines. If you’re running late, tell an airline employee; they can usually get
you to the front of the line.
Help speed up security before you’re screened by knowing what you 
can carry on and what you can’t. For the latest updates on items you’re
prohibited from bringing in carry-on luggage, go to www.tsa.gov/
travelers/airtravel.
Remove jackets, shoes, metal belt buckles, heavy jewelry, and watches
and place them either in your carry-on luggage or the security bins pro-
vided. Place keys, coins, cellphones, and pagers in a security bin. If you
have metallic body parts, carry a note from your doctor. When possible,
keep packing liquids in checked baggage.
Use a TSA-approved lock, which can be opened by luggage inspectors
with a special code or key, for your checked luggage. Look for Travel
Sentry–certified locks at luggage or travel shops and Brookstone stores
(or online at www.brookstone.com).

Sydney, Melbourne,
and the Australian
Capital Territory

In this part . . .
W
e head for the bright lights, big cities of the Eastern
part of Australia! In Chapter 11, we introduce you to
Sydney, and its iconic sights (like the Opera House) and
world-class hotels and restaurants. Sydney’s the major city in
New South Wales and in Chapter 12, we tell you about some
of that territory’s highlights, from mountain to beach to
Outback.
In Chapter 13, we introduce you to Australia’s most cosmo-
politan and European-style city: Melbourne. Wander its cob-
blestone lanes to ﬁnd the best coffee shops and bars, and get
ready to shop-’til-you-drop. Then we take you out of the city
to one of Victoria’s most popular day-trip destinations: Phillip
Island, where you can gaze upon the cute fairy penguins as
they come ashore each night.
Chapter 14 takes you beyond the city, to some of Victoria’s
most appealing regional centers. We drive along the spectacu-
lar 94km (58-mile) Great Ocean Road, discover the mountains
and forests of the High Country, and learn the story of famous
outlaw Ned Kelly.
Like Washington, D.C., Canberra is a planned capital, and it’s
located in its own territory (the Australian Capital Territory,
or ACT) between Sydney and Melbourne. In Chapter 15, 
we take a peek at the city that’s the seat of the Australian 
government.

Chapter 11
Sydney
by Marc Llewellyn
In This Chapter
 Arriving in Sydney
 Getting around the city
 Finding the best room in Sydney
 Exploring the harbor and beyond
S
ydney is a jewel of a city, set around one of the finest harbors in the
world. This thriving, sunny metropolis is home to some famous
architectural and natural icons — the Sydney Opera House, the Sydney
Harbour Bridge, and Bondi Beach. Most of Sydney’s main attractions are
concentrated in a relatively compact area. Still, there’s so much to do
that you could easily spend a week here and still find yourself crashing
into bed at night exhausted, having tried to see everything.
In summer head to one of Sydney’s beaches — with over 20 strung along
the city’s oceanfront, and dozens more around the harbor, you’ll be
spoiled for choice. The most famous, of course, is Bondi, a strip of
golden sand legendary for its Speedo-clad Lifesavers and surfboard
riders. Another favorite is Manly, a 30-minute ferry trip from Circular
Quay. Pick up some fish and chips and head for the main beach, which is
flanked by a row of giant pines that chatter with hundreds of small, col-
orful parrots at dusk. The best time to return is in the early evening,
when the lights of the skyscrapers around Circular Quay streak like rain-
bows across the water of the harbor, and the sails of the Opera House
and the girders of the Harbour Bridge are lit up — it’s magical.
Compared to many other major cities, Sydney offers good value. Food
and public transport are cheap, and attractions are generally not pro- 
hibitively expensive. (Senior and student prices are almost always avail-
able with ID.) The price of a hotel room is comparatively cheaper than 
in other major cities such as New York and London.

Getting There
The city has one airport and a major train hub at Central Station. It’s
also served by highways from the north and south.
By air
All international flights arrive at Sydney International Airport, which is
8km (5 miles) from the city center. Free shuttle buses link the interna-
tional and domestic terminals. In both terminals, you’ll find luggage
carts, wheelchairs, a post office (open Mon–Fri 9 a.m.–5 p.m.), mail-
boxes, currency exchange, duty-free shops, restaurants, bars, stores,
showers, luggage lockers, a place where you can leave luggage, ATMs,
and tourist information desks. You can rent mobile phones in the inter-
national terminal.
The airport is efficient, has extremely strict quarantine procedures —
you must declare all food — and is completely nonsmoking.
On arrival, pick up a copy of Sydney: The Official Guide, from the rack
just before passport control, which contains tear-out discount tickets for
some of Sydney’s major attractions. Luggage trolleys are free to hire in
the international arrival terminal but cost A$4 (US$3/£1.50) outside
departure terminals (you’ll need coins).
By train
Central Station (% 13 15 00 for CityRail, or 13 22 32 for Countrylink
interstate trains) is the main city and interstate train station. It’s on
George Street in downtown Sydney. All interstate trains depart from
here, and it’s a major CityRail hub. Many city buses leave from nearby
Railway Square for places like Town Hall and Circular Quay.
By bus
Greyhound coaches operate from the Sydney Coach Terminal (% 02/
9212 1500), on the corner of Eddy Avenue and Pitt Street, bordering
Central Station.
By cruise ship
Cruise ships dock at the Overseas Passenger Terminal in The Rocks,
opposite the Sydney Opera House, or in Darling Harbour if The Rocks
facility is already occupied.
By car
Drivers enter Sydney from the north on the Pacific Highway, from the
south on the M5 and Princes Highway, and from the west on the Great
Western Highway.
Part III: Sydney, Melbourne, and the ACT 
108

Getting from the Airport into Sydney
The Airport Link connects the international and domestic airports to
the city stations of Central, Museum, St. James, Circular Quay, Wynyard,
and Town Hall. You need to change trains for other Sydney stations.
Unfortunately, the line has no dedicated luggage areas and, because it’s
on a scheduled route into the city from the suburbs, it gets very crowded
during rush hours (approximately 7–9 a.m. and 4–6:30 p.m.). If you have
lots of luggage and you’re traveling into the city at these times, taking a
taxi is probably best. Otherwise walk to the end of the platform, and
there should be more room on board.
The train takes ten minutes to reach the Central Railway Station and
continues to Circular Quay. Trains leave every 15 minutes or so and cost
A$13 (US$10/£5) one-way adults, A$8.80 (US$7/£4.40) children. Round-
trip tickets are only available if you really hate Sydney and want to
return to the airport on the same day. Ask at the ticket office about
group tickets and Family Fare tickets, which allow a second child — or
more — to travel for free with an adult. (The first child pays the stan-
dard child fare.)
Sydney Airporter coaches (% 02/9666 9988; http://kst.com.au)
operate to the city center from bus stops outside the terminals every 15
minutes. This service will drop you off (and pick you up) at hotels in the
city, Kings Cross, and Darling Harbour. This could be frustrating if you’re
staying at the last hotel on the route! Pickups from hotels require at least
three hours’ advance notice; you can book online. Tickets cost A$10
(US$8/£5) one-way and A$17 (US$14/£7) round-trip from the Interna-
tional Terminal; A$12 (US$9.60/£6) one-way and A$20 (US$16/£8) round-
trip from the Domestic Terminal. The return portion can be used at any
time in the future.
Both short-term and long-term parking are available at both terminals.
An example is a four-day stay at the Domestic Terminal, which costs
A$79 (US$63/£39).
Finding Information after You Arrive
The Sydney Visitor Centre at The Rocks, First Floor, The Rocks Centre,
Corner of Argyle and Playfair streets, The Rocks (% 02/9240 8788; www.
sydneyvisitorcentre.com), is a good place to pick up maps, brochures,
and tourist information about Sydney as well as other towns in New
South Wales; it also sells books, T-shirts, DVDs, postcards, and the like.
The office is open daily from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.
Also in The Rocks is the National Parks & Wildlife Centre, in Cadmans
Cottage (a sandstone building, built in 1816, set back from the water in
front of The Rocks), 110 George St. (% 02/9247 5033). This place has
lots of national park information and runs boat tours to some of the
Chapter 11: Sydney 109

islands in Sydney Harbour. It’s open Monday through Friday from 9:30 a.m.
to 4:30 p.m., and on Saturday and Sunday from 10 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.
There’s also the Sydney Visitors Centre — Darling Harbour, 33 Wheat
Rd., Darling Harbour (near the IMAX Theatre). It’s open daily from 9:30 a.m.
to 5:30 p.m.
If you want to inquire about destinations and holidays in Sydney or 
the rest of New South Wales, call Tourism New South Wales’s help line
(% 13 20 77 in Australia).
In Manly, the Manly Visitors Information Centre (% 02/9976 1430), is
at Manly Wharf (where the ferries arrive). It’s open Monday through
Friday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., weekends from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.
There are City Host information kiosks at Martin Place (between
Elizabeth and Castlereagh streets), on George Street (next to Sydney
Town Hall), and at Circular Quay (corner of Pitt and Alfred streets). They
offer maps, brochures, and advice and are open daily from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.
Orienting Yourself in Sydney
Sydney is one of the largest cities in the world by area, covering more
than 1,730 sq. km (675 sq. miles) from the sea to the foothills of the Blue
Mountains. Thankfully, the city center is compact. The jewel in Sydney’s
crown is its harbor, which empties into the South Pacific Ocean through
headlands known simply as North Head and South Head. On the south-
ern side of the harbor are the high-rises of the city center; the Sydney
Opera House; a string of beaches, including Bondi; and the inner-city
suburbs. The Sydney Harbour Bridge and a tunnel connect the city
center to the high-rises of the North Sydney business district and the
affluent northern suburbs and beautiful ocean beaches beyond.
The city’s main thoroughfare, George Street, runs up from Circular
Quay (pronounced key), past Wynyard CityRail station and Town Hall, to
Central Station. A whole host of streets run parallel to George, including
Pitt, Elizabeth, and Macquarie streets. Macquarie Street runs up from
the Sydney Opera House, past the Royal Botanic Gardens and Hyde
Park. Martin Place is a pedestrian thoroughfare that stretches from
Macquarie to George streets. It’s about halfway between Circular Quay
and Town Hall — in the heart of the city center.
The easy-to-spot Sydney Tower (also known as Centrepoint Tower),
facing onto pedestrian-only Pitt Street Mall on Pitt Street, is the main
city-center landmark. Next to Circular Quay and across from the Opera
House is The Rocks, a cluster of small streets that was once part of a
larger slum and is now a tourist attraction. Roads meet at Town Hall
from Kings Cross in one direction and Darling Harbour in the other. From
Circular Quay to The Rocks it’s a five- to ten-minute stroll; to Wynyard,

Sydney Harbour Area
Chapter 11: Sydney 111

about ten minutes; and to Town Hall, about 20 minutes. From Town Hall
to the near side of Darling Harbour it’s about a ten-minute walk.
Introducing the Neighbourhoods
Circular Quay
This transport hub for ferries, buses, and CityRail trains is tucked
between the Harbour Bridge and the Sydney Opera House. The Quay, as
it’s called, is a good spot for a stroll, and its outdoor restaurants and
street performers are popular. The Rocks, the Royal Botanic Gardens,
the Modern Australian Art Museum, and the start of the main shopping
area (centered on Pitt and George streets) are a short walk away.
The Rocks
This historic area, a short walk west of Circular Quay, is packed with
colonial buildings, intriguing back streets, boutiques, pubs, and top-
notch restaurants and hotels. It’s the most exclusive place to stay
because of its beauty and its proximity to the Opera House and harbor.
Shops are geared toward Sydney’s yuppies and wealthy tourists — don’t
expect bargains. On weekends, a portion of George Street is blocked off
for The Rocks Market, with stalls selling souvenirs and crafts.
Town Hall
In the heart of the city, this area is home to the main department stores
and two Sydney landmarks, the Town Hall and a historic shopping mall
called the Queen Victoria Building (QVB). In this area are Sydney Tower
and the boutique-style chain stores of Pitt Street Mall. Farther up George
Street are major movie houses, the entrance to Sydney’s small Spanish
district (around Liverpool Street), and the city’s Chinatown.
Darling Harbour
Designed as a tourist precinct, Darling Harbour features Sydney’s main
convention, exhibition, and entertainment centers; a waterfront prome-
nade; the Sydney Aquarium; the Panasonic IMAX Theatre; the Australian
Maritime Museum; the Powerhouse Museum; Star City (Sydney’s casino);
a major food court; and plenty of shops. Nearby are the funky restau-
rants of Cockle Bay and King Street Wharf.
Kings Cross and the suburbs beyond
“The Cross,” as it’s known, is the city’s red-light district — though it’s
also home to some of Sydney’s best-known nightclubs and restaurants.
The area has plenty of hostels, a few bars, and some upscale hotels. The
main drag, Darlinghurst Road, is short but crammed with strip joints,
prostitutes, addicts, drunks, and such. Also in this area are cheap e-mail
centers that offer discount overseas phone rates. There’s a heavy police
presence, but do take care.
Part III: Sydney, Melbourne, and the ACT 
112

Paddington/Oxford Street
This inner-city suburb, centered on trendy Oxford Street, is known for its
expensive terrace houses, off-the-wall boutiques and bookshops, restau-
rants, pubs, and nightclubs. It’s also the heart of Sydney’s large gay com-
munity and has a liberal scattering of gay bars and dance spots.
Darlinghurst
Between grungy Kings Cross and upscale Oxford Street, this extroverted,
grimy terraced suburb is home to some of Sydney’s best cafes. It’s prob-
ably not wise to wander around at night. Take the CityRail train to Kings
Cross and head right from the exit.
Central
The congested and polluted crossroads around Central Station, the
city’s main train station, has little to recommend it. Buses run from here
to Circular Quay, and it’s a 20-minute walk to Town Hall.
Newtown
This popular student area centers on car-clogged King Street, which is
lined with alternative shops, bookstores, and ethnic restaurants. People-
watching is the thing to do — see how many belly-button rings, violently
colored hairdos, and Celtic arm tattoos you can spot.
Glebe
Yuppies and students come to this inner-city suburb for the cafes,
restaurants, pubs, and shops along Glebe Point Road. All this, plus a
location 15 minutes from the city and 30 minutes from Circular Quay,
makes it a good place for budget-conscious travelers.
Bondi and the southern beaches
Some of Sydney’s most glamorous surf beaches — Bondi, Bronte, and
Coogee — lie along the South Pacific coast southeast of the city center.
Bondi has a wide sweep of beach, some interesting restaurants and bars,
plenty of attitude, and beautiful bodies — and no CityRail station.
Watsons Bay
Watsons Bay is known for The Gap — a section of dramatic sea cliffs —
as well as several good restaurants and the Watsons Bay Hotel beer
garden. It’s a terrific spot to spend a sunny afternoon. To reach it on
public transportation, take bus no. 324 or 325 from Circular Quay.
The North Shore
Ferries and buses provide access to these wealthy neighborhoods
across the Harbour Bridge. Gorgeous Balmoral Beach, Taronga Zoo, and
upscale boutiques are the attractions in Mosman.
Chapter 11: Sydney 113

Manly and the northern beaches
Half an hour away by ferry, or 15 minutes by the faster JetCat, Manly is
famous for its ocean beach — it gives Bondi a run for its money — and
scores of cheap food outlets. Farther north are more beaches popular
with surfers. CityRail train lines do not go to the northern beaches. The
farthest beach from the city, Palm Beach, has magnificent surf and
lagoon beaches, walking paths, and a golf course.
Balmain
West of the city center, a short ferry ride from Circular Quay, Balmain
was once Sydney’s main shipbuilding area. In the last few decades, the
area has become trendy and expensive. The suburb has a village feel to
it, abounds with restaurants and pubs, and stages a popular Saturday
market at the local church.
Homebush Bay
Sydney Olympic Park was the main site of the 2000 Olympic games.
You’ll find Telstra Stadium (once named Stadium Australia), the Aquatic
Center, and Homebush Bay Information Centre, parklands, and a water-
bird reserve here.
Getting Around Sydney
The center of Sydney is compact enough to walk between most places of
interest, but you’ll have to catch public transport if you want to head
farther out, to Manly or Bondi beaches perhaps. The nicest way to see
the city is from the water, and there are frequent ferry services zipping
back and forth across the harbor. Buses are relatively convenient, but
you’ll probably find yourself using the CityRail train system more.
By train
Sydney’s CityRail trains travel both underground and overground — the
double-decker carriages are a feature, as is the system’s ability to self-
combust as soon as a train breaks down or a driver calls in sick. Hence,
timetables should be used as a very rough guide. The system is also lim-
ited; many tourist areas — including Manly, Bondi Beach, and Darling
Harbour — are not connected to the network. Single tickets within the
city center cost A$2.40 (US$1.90/£0.95) adults, A$1.20 (US$0.95/£0.50)
children. Round-trip tickets cost A$4.80 (US$3.85/£1.90) adults, A$2.40
(US$1.90/£0.95) children, for travel starting before 9 a.m.; A$3.40
(US$2.70/£1.35) adults, A$2.40 (US$1.90/£0.95) children, after 9 a.m.
Information is available from the Infoline (% 13 15 00 in Australia).
By bus
Buses are frequent and reliable and cover a wide area of metropolitan
Sydney — though you may find the system a little difficult to navigate if
Part III: Sydney, Melbourne, and the ACT 
114

you’re visiting some of the outer suburbs. For a 4km (21⁄2-mile) “section,”
the minimum fare, which covers most short hops in the city, is A$1.70
(US$1.40/£0.75) adults, A$0.80 (US$0.65/£0.35) children. The farther you
go, the cheaper each section is. For example, the 44km (27-mile) trip to
Palm Beach, way past Manly, costs A$5.40 (US$4.30/£2.15) adults, A$2.70
(US$2.15/£1) children. Sections are marked on bus-stand signs, but most
Sydneysiders are as confused about the system as you will be — when in
doubt, ask the bus driver.
To reach Bondi by public transport, ride bus no. 380 to Bondi Beach
from Circular Quay; it takes up to an hour. A quicker alternative is taking
a CityRail train to Bondi Junction to connect with the same buses. Bus
no. 333 takes around 40 minutes from Circular Quay to Bondi Beach. It
has limited stops, but you can catch it from Elizabeth Street near Martin
Place, along Oxford Street, and from the bus terminal at Bondi Junction.
You need to buy a ticket at newsdealers or 7-Eleven stores beforehand. A
Travel Ten bus ticket (see “Using a travel pass to get around,” later in
this chapter) is a good option if you’re staying in Bondi. Bus no. 378
from Railway Square, Central Station, goes to Bronte, and bus nos. 373
and 374 travel to Coogee from Circular Quay.
By car
Traffic restrictions, parking, and congestion can make getting around by
car frustrating, but if you plan to visit some of the outer suburbs or take
excursions elsewhere in New South Wales, then renting a car will give
you more flexibility. The National Roads and Motorists’ Association
(NRMA) is the New South Wales auto club; for emergency breakdown
service, call % 13 11 11.
Chapter 11: Sydney 115
Transport/attraction passes
Sydney Ferries have teamed up with Taronga Zoo and Sydney Aquarium to provide
two discount passes.
The Zoo Pass includes round-trip ferry trips from Circular Quay to Taronga Zoo, a trip
on the Aerial Safari cable car at the zoo, and a bus trip back to the ferry if you some-
how end up at the top (which is unlikely, because generally you start at the top of the
hill and work your way down). It costs A$39 (US$31/£16) adults, A$21 (US$17/£8.40)
children 4 to 15. A family ticket costs A$37 (US$30/£15) for the first adult, A$32
(US$26/£13) for a second adult, A$20 (US$16/£8) for the first child, A$12 (US$9.60/£4.80)
for each additional child.
The Aquarium Pass includes round-trip ferry travel from Circular Quay to the Sydney
Aquarium and also entry. It costs A$33 (US$26/£13) adults, A$17 (US$14/£6.80) chil-
dren, A$81 (US$65/UK£32) families of two adults and two children. Buy tickets at
Circular Quay.

Car rental agencies in Sydney include Avis, 214 William St., Kings Cross
(% 1800/225 553); Budget, 93 William St., Kings Cross (% 13 27 27 in
Australia, or 02/9339 8888); Hertz, corner of William and Riley streets,
Kings Cross (% 13 30 39 in Australia); and Thrifty, 75 William St., Kings
Cross (% 02/9380 5399). Avis, Budget, Hertz, and Thrifty also have desks
at the airport. Rates average about A$60 (US$48/£24) per day for a small
car. One of the best-value operations is Bayswater Car Rentals, 180
William St., Kings Cross (% 02/9360 3622; www.bayswatercarrentals.
com.au), which has small cars for around A$40 (US$32/£16) a day with
everything included.
By ferry
The best way to get a taste of a city that revolves around its harbor is to
jump on a ferry. The main ferry terminal is at Circular Quay. Machines at
each wharf dispense tickets. (There are also change machines.) For ferry
information, call % 13 15 00 or visit the ferry information office oppo-
site Wharf 4. Timetables are available for all routes.
One-way trips within the inner harbor (which is everywhere except
Manly and Parramatta) cost A$5.20 (US$4/£2.60) adults, A$2.60 (US$2/£1)
children 4 to 15. Kids under 4 travel free.
The ferry to Manly takes 30 minutes and costs A$6.40 (US$5/£2.50)
adults, A$3.20 (US$2.50/£1.75) children. It leaves from Wharf 3. The rapid
JetCat service to Manly takes 15 minutes and costs A$8.20 (US$4/£2) for
both adults and children. After 7 p.m. all trips to and from Manly are by
JetCat at ferry prices. Ferries run from 6 a.m. to midnight.
By monorail and tram
The monorail, with its single overhead line, connects the central busi-
ness district to Darling Harbour — though it’s only a 15- to 20-minute
walk from Town Hall. The system operates Monday through Thursday
from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m., Friday and Saturday from 7 a.m. to midnight, and
Sunday from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. Tickets are A$4.50 (US$3.60/£1.80), free for
children under 5. An all-day monorail pass costs A$9 (US$7.20/£4.50).
The trip from the city center to Darling Harbour takes around 12 min-
utes. Look for the gray overhead line and the tubelike structures that are
stations. Call Metro Monorail (% 02/8584 5288; www.metrolightrail.
com.au) for information.
Meanwhile, a system of trams runs on a route that traverses a 3.6km (21⁄4-
mile) track between Central Station and Wentworth Park in Pyrmont. It
provides good access to Chinatown, Paddy’s Markets, Darling Harbour,
the Star City casino, and the Sydney Fish Markets. The trams run every
ten minutes. The one-way fare is A$3 to A$4 (US$2.40–US$3.20/£1.20–
£1.60) adults, A$1.80 to A$3 (US$1.40–US$2.40/£0.75–£1.20) children 4 to
15, depending on distance. Two-way tickets are also available. A day
pass costs A$8.40 (US$6.70/£3.30) adults, A$6.50 (US$5.20/£2.60) chil-
dren, A$20 (US$16/£8) families of five. Contact Metro Light Rail (% 02/
8584 5288; www.metrolightrail.com.au) for details.
Part III: Sydney, Melbourne, and the ACT 
116

By taxi
Several taxi companies serve the city center and suburbs. All journeys
are metered.
If you cross either way on the Harbour Bridge or through the Harbour
Tunnel, it will cost you an extra A$3 (US$2.40/£1.20) — a rip-off consider-
ing there’s only an official toll on the way into the city. If you take the
Eastern Distributor from the airport (the most likely case), it’s A$4.50
(US$3.60/£1.80). An extra 10 percent will be added to your fare if you pay
by credit card.
Taxis line up at stands in the city, such as those opposite Circular Quay
and Central Station. They’re also frequently found in front of hotels. A
yellow light on top of the cab means it’s vacant. Cabs can be hard to get
on Friday and Saturday nights and between 2 p.m. and 3 p.m. every day,
when cabbies are changing shifts after 12 hours on the road. Some
people prefer to sit up front, but it’s certainly not considered rude if you
don’t. Passengers must wear seat belts in the front and back seats. The
Taxi Complaints Hotline (% 1800/648 478 in Australia) deals with
problem taxi drivers. Taxis are licensed to carry four people.
The main cab companies are Taxis Combined (% 13 33 00); RSL 
Taxis (% 02/9581 1111); Legion Cabs (% 13 14 51); and Premier
Cabs (% 13 10 17).
By water taxi
Water taxis operate 24 hours a day and are a quick, convenient way to
get to waterfront restaurants, harbor attractions, and some suburbs.
You can also charter them for private cruises. Fares are based on an ini-
tial flag-fall for the hire of the vessel, then a charge per person traveling.
On most trips, the more people who are traveling, the lower the fare per
person. The typical fare for a group of six people would be A$10 to A$15
(US$8–US$12/£4–£6) per person for an inner harbor jaunt. Sometimes
you can combine with other people if you call well in advance. The main
operators are Water Taxis Combined (% 02/9555 8888; www.water
taxis.com.au), Beach Hopper (% 0412 400 990 mobile; www.water
taxi.net.au), and Yellow Water Taxis (% 02/9299 0199; www.yellow
watertaxis.com).
Staying in Style
The best location for lodging in Sydney is in The Rocks and around
Circular Quay — a short stroll from the Sydney Opera House, the
Harbour Bridge, the Royal Botanic Gardens, and the ferry terminals.
Hotels around Darling Harbour offer good access to the local facilities,
including museums, the Sydney Aquarium, and the Star City casino.
Most Darling Harbour hotels are a 10- to 15-minute walk, or a short

Part III: Sydney, Melbourne, and the ACT 
120
Using a travel pass to get around
Several passes are available for visitors who will be using public transportation fre-
quently. All work out to be much cheaper than buying individual tickets.
 The SydneyPass includes unlimited travel on Sydney Explorer coaches, Bondi &
Bay Explorer coaches, three Sydney Harbour cruises, the JetCat to Manly, the high-
speed RiverCat to Parramatta (linking the city center to this important heritage and
business center along a historic waterway), Sydney buses, Sydney Ferries, and
CityRail trains (within the “Red TravelPass” travel zone, which includes the entire
city center, as well as to Bondi Junction). For three days of travel over a seven-day
period, the SydneyPass costs A$110 (US$88/£55) adults, A$55 (US$44/£22) children;
for five days over a seven-day period, A$145 (US$116/£58) adults, A$70 (US$56/£28)
children; and for seven consecutive days, A$165 (US$132/£66) adults, A$80
(US$64/£32) children. Family fares are also available. Buy tickets at the information
desk at the airport, at the TransitShop at Circular Quay (near McDonald’s), from the
Sydney Ferries ticket offices at Circular Quay, and from Explorer bus drivers.
 A Weekly Travel Pass allows unlimited travel on buses, trains, and ferries. There
are six different passes (each a different color) depending on the distance you
need to travel. The passes most visitors use are the Red Pass and the Green Pass.
The Red Pass costs A$33 (US$26/£13) adults, A$17 (US$13/£7.50) children; it covers
all transportation within the city center and near surroundings. This pass gets you
aboard inner harbor ferries, but not the ferry to Manly. The Green Pass, which
costs A$41 (US$33/£17) adults, A$21 (US$16/£8) children, takes you to more distant
destinations, including Manly (aboard the ferry but not the JetCat before 7 p.m.).
You can buy either pass at newsdealers or bus, train, and ferry ticket outlets.
 The Day Tripper ticket gives you unlimited bus, train, and ferry travel for one day.
Tickets cost A$15 (US$12/£6) adults, A$7.70 (US$6/£3) children. The pass is avail-
able at all bus, train, and ferry ticket outlets.
 The City Hopper allows unlimited all day CityRail travel around 11 stations within
the city area. They include: Central, Martin Place, Museum, Town Hall, St James,
Circular Quay, Kings Cross, Wynyard, Redfern, Milsons Point, and North Sydney.
Before 9 a.m., tickets cost $7 (US$5.50/£2.75) adults, A$3 (US$2.50/£1.25) children;
after 9 a.m., tickets cost A$5 (US$4/£2) adults, A$2.50 (US$2/£1) children.
 A Travelten bus ticket offers ten bus rides for a discounted price. A Blue Travelten
covers two sections on the bus route and costs A$14 (US$11/£5.50) adults, A$6.80
(US$5.40/£2.70) children; a Brown Travelten covers up to nine sections and costs
A$23 (US$19/£10) adults, A$12 (US$9.30/£4.50) children.
 The Travelten ferryticket costs A$34 (US$27/£13) adults, A$17 (US$14/£7) children. It’s
good for ten trips within the inner harbor (this excludes Manly). You can buy Travelten
tickets at newsdealers, bus depots, or the Circular Quay ferry terminal. Tickets are
transferable, so if two or more people travel together, you can use the same ticket.
 A Manly Ferry Ten ticket (allowing ten journeys) costs A$48 (US$38/£19) adults,
A$24 (US$19/£10) children; a weekly JetCat ticket costs A$68 (US$54/£27) per
person. After 7 p.m. all trips to and from Manly are by JetCat at ferry prices. Ferries
run from 6 a.m. to midnight.

monorail or light-rail trip, from Town Hall and the central shopping dis-
trict in and around Sydney Tower and Pitt Street Mall.
More hotels are grouped around Kings Cross, Sydney’s red-light district.
Some of the hotels here are among the city’s best, and you’ll also find a
range of cheaper lodgings. Kings Cross can be unnerving at any time, but
especially on Friday and Saturday nights when the area’s strip joints and
nightclubs are jumping.
Glebe, with its ethnic restaurants, is another inner-city suburb popular
with tourists. It’s well served by local buses.
If you want to stay near the beach, check out the options in Manly and
Bondi, though you should consider their distance from the city center
and the lack of CityRail trains to these areas. A taxi to Manly from the
city will cost around A$37 (US$29/£15) and to Bondi around A$28
(US$22/£11).
Always ask about discounts, package deals, and any other special offer-
ings when booking a hotel, especially if you’re traveling in winter when
hotels are less likely to be full. Ask about weekend discounts, corporate
rates, and family plans.
Almost all hotels offer nonsmoking rooms; inquire when you make a
reservation if it’s important to you. Most moderately priced to very
expensive rooms will have tea- and coffeemaking facilities, and an iron.
Coffeemakers as such are rare in Australian hotels.
Getting a deal on a good hotel
 The Sydney Visitors Centre bookings desk (% 02/9667 6050), in
the arrivals hall of the airport’s International Terminal, negotiates
deals with many of Sydney’s hotels and offers exceptional dis-
counts on rooms that haven’t been filled that day.
 Another way to hunt for discounted hotel rooms is through an inde-
pendent hotel search site. The two most popular are www.last
minute.com.au and www.wotif.com. LastMinute.com allows you
to check prices at least a month in advance.
 Booking through a hotel’s Web site can also yield savings. For
example, a search of the Accor Web site (www.accorhotels.
com.au), which has 31 hotels in and around Sydney, shows you 
can save up to 50 percent off the rack rate.
 Serviced apartments are well worth considering because you can
save a bundle by cooking your own meals; many also have free
laundry facilities.

The top hotels
Establishment Hotel
$$$$
Wynyard
Sydney’s coolest hotel offers sleek modernist rooms in two styles: one with
restored warehouse ceilings, Japan-black floorboards, and flashes of
strong color, and the other more tranquil in color and softer in feel. All
rooms come with generous-size marble or bluestone bathrooms. In the
same building you’ll find one of Sydney’s best restaurants, est., and also
the small-but-gorgeous Sushi E. Also here are a couple of trendy bars and
the popular Tank nightclub. The building is a historic Sydney landmark,
but the feel is “now” rather than then.

Four Seasons Hotel Sydney
$$$$
The Rocks
The Four Seasons features impressive views of Sydney Harbour and the
Opera House and is close to The Rocks and the Sydney Opera House. The
rooms are elegantly decorated, with marble bathrooms and plenty of
mahogany, and though neither a modern nor a historic hotel — a bit of a
1970s block from the outside — it still has a nice charm about it. The staff
is helpful and efficient, the outdoor pool is the largest in any hotel in
Sydney, the spa is one of the city’s best, and the restaurant, Cables, is a
high-standard eatery, too.

The Kirketon
$$
Kings Cross
If you want to stay somewhere a bit offbeat then this boutique hotel in
Darlinghurst is a fascinating option. Rooms come with king-size, queen-
size, double, or twin beds, and are lightly stocked with modernist furni-
ture and custom-made fittings, including mirrored headboards, sleek
bathrooms hidden away behind mirrored doors, and textured bedspreads
and areas of wallpaper. All in all, the décor is fun if you like this sort of
thing. Standard rooms are compact and each comes with a double bed;
some come with a tub as well as shower. Premium rooms have a queen-
size bed. Executive rooms are large with king-size beds; some have a bal-
cony overlooking the main road (which can be noisy at night). The inside
Part III: Sydney, Melbourne, and the ACT 
122

scoop is that the best standard room is no. 330, the best premium room no.
340, and the best executive room no. 323. I would definitely ask for a room
away from the main road. The same company operates another boutique
hotel, Medusa, 267 Darlinghurst Rd. (% 02/9331 1000; www.medusa.com.
au). Rooms start at A$270 (US$216/£108) there, and the overall size and
quality of the rooms reflect the price jumps.

Manly Pacific Hotel
$$$
Manly
Standing on your balcony in the evening with the sea breeze in your nos-
trils and the chirping of hundreds of lorikeets is nothing short of heaven.
The Manly Pacific is the only hotel of its class in this beachside suburb.
There’s nothing claustrophobic here, from the broad expanse of glittering
foyer to the wide corridors and spacious accommodations. Each standard
room is light and modern, with two double beds, a balcony, limited cable
TV, and all the necessities. The hotel is a ten-minute stroll, or a A$5
(US$4/£2) taxi ride, from the Manly ferry.
55 North Steyne, Manly, NSW 2095. % 02/9977 7666. Fax: 02/9977 7822. www.

Medina Grand, Harbourside
$$$
Darling Harbour
This impressive serviced hotel (which is essentially a furnished apartment
with maid service) offers modern, comfortable rooms at competitive
prices. It’s reached by an offshoot road and a short, unattractive walk from
the Sydney Aquarium in Darling Harbour, but makes up for it by being
close to all the Darling Harbour attractions and shops. You can choose

Observatory Hotel

The Rocks
This exclusive hotel, a 10-minute walk from The Rocks and 15 minutes from
Circular Quay, is a turn-of-the-20th-century beauty competing for top-hotel-
in-Sydney honors. It’s fitted with antiques, objets d’art, and the finest car-
pets, wallpapers, and draperies. Plus, it’s renowned for its personalized
service. Rooms are plush and quiet, with huge bathrooms. Some rooms have
city views; others look out over the harbor. The pool here is one of the best
in Sydney; note the Southern Hemisphere constellations on the roof.

Park Hyatt Sydney
$$$$$
The Rocks
This artistically curving property on The Rocks foreshore is the best-
positioned hotel in Sydney. It’s right on the water, and some rooms have
fantastic views across the harbor to the Sydney Opera House. Its location
and general appeal mean it’s usually full and frequently has to turn guests
away. The building itself is a pleasure to look at, and from a ferry on the
harbor it looks like a wonderful addition to the toy-town landscape of The
Rocks. The good-size rooms incorporate every possible luxury. Room
rates here depend on views; the least expensive units have only glimpses
of the harbor. (The most expensive rooms look over the Opera House.)
Each of the 33 executive suites has two balconies with a telescope.

The Russell

The Rocks
This is the coziest place to stay in The Rocks — perhaps in all of Sydney.
It’s more than 100 years old, and it shows its age wonderfully in the creaks
of the floorboards and the ramshackle feel of the brightly painted corri-
dors. Each of the 29 rooms is different in style, size, and shape; all come
with a queen-size bed, and most have cable TV. All rooms have immense
character, including a series of rooms added on in 1990 above the Fortune
of War Hotel next door. There are no harbor views, but from some rooms
you can see the tops of the ferry terminals at Circular Quay. Guests have
the use of a sitting room, a living room, and a rooftop garden. The apart-
ment is a large, open-plan unit with a king-size bed and small kitchen; it’s
suitable for three people. It overlooks Circular Quay.

Walsh Bay
A premier waterfront hotel, the Sebel is in the historic Woolloomooloo
Wharf complex and has been painstakingly renovated, leaving as much of
the original structure intact as possible. It’s a wonderfully intoxicating
blend of old wooden beams and modern art. The only drawback to stay-
ing in one of the tastefully appointed waterfront rooms is that the harbor
views — through windows that run all the way to the polished wooden
floorboards — could make you want to stay in for the rest of the day.

quite a claim, as soon as I walked into this atmospheric old place, I wanted

as you enter the tessellated, tiled corridor of the 1880s Victorian mansion
is the jumble of plants and ornaments, high ceilings, Oriental rugs, and
leaded windows. Guests relax over a decanter of port or with a magazine
on wicker furniture on the veranda overlooking fairly busy Glebe Point

Dining Out
Sydney is a gourmet paradise, with an abundance of fresh seafood, a
vast range of vegetables and fruit always in season, prime meats at inex-
pensive prices, and top-quality chefs making international names for
themselves. Asian and Mediterranean cooking have had a major influ-
ence on the cuisine, with spices and herbs finding their way into most
dishes. Immigration has brought with it almost every type of cuisine you
can imagine, from African to Tibetan, from Russian to Vietnamese.
Sydney is a great place to try Modern Australian, or “Mod Oz,” cuisine,
which has been applauded by chefs and food critics around the world.
Modern Australian cuisine emphasizes fresh ingredients and a creative
blend of European styles with Asian influences. At its best, Modern
Australian food is world-class, but you’ll probably have to go to the best
of Sydney’s restaurants to see what the scene is all about.
By the way, in Australia, the first course is called the entree and the
second course the main.
Australians think American-style coffee tastes like ditch water and favor
a range of Italian-style coffee creations. Ask for a latte if you just want
coffee with milk. “Bottomless” cups of coffee are rare in Australia.
Most moderate and inexpensive restaurants in Sydney are BYO, as in
“bring your own” bottle, though some places also have extensive wine
and beer lists. More moderately priced restaurants are introducing cork-
age fees, which means you pay anywhere from A$2 to A$8 (US$1.60–
US$6.40/£0.80–£3.20) per person for the privilege of the waiter opening
your bottle of wine. Very expensive restaurants discourage BYO.
Aria

With front-row views of the Harbour Bridge and the Sydney Opera House,
Aria stands in one of the most enviable spots in the city. The windows
overlooking the water are huge, the atmosphere is elegant and buzzy, and
many of the tables have a stunning view. The food, created by Matthew
Moran, one of Australia’s great chefs, is imaginative and mouthwatering.
Standout dishes include the pan-fried kingfish filets with a salad of white

Chapter 11: Sydney 133

Bilsons
$$$$
Town Hall
FRENCH/MODERN AUSTRALIAN
Tucked away at the back of the Radisson Plaza Hotel is a great restaurant
that could compete with some of the Michelin-starred classics in Europe.
Chef Tony Bilson, is a well-known Sydney personality and the quality of
his French-influenced food is a testament to some 30 years in the business.
The restaurant is modern in its look, but comfortable, and the service is
impeccable. Expect something in the same vein as slow-roasted suckling
pig with grilled pineapple, or grilled breasts of wild pigeon with foie gras.
See map p. 132. The Foyer, Radisson Plaza Hotel, 27 O’Connell St., Sydney. % 02/8214
0496. www.bilsons.com.au. Reservations essential. Main courses: A$40
(US$32/£16); 8-course degustation menu A$120 (US$96/£48) per person without wine,
A$200 (US$160/£80) per person with wine. AE, DC, MC, V. Open: Mon–Fri noon to 
2:30 p.m.; Mon–Sat 6–10 p.m.
The Boathouse on Blackwattle Bay
$$$$
Glebe
SEAFOOD
Above Sydney University’s rowing club and overlooking a working area of
Sydney Harbour, this converted boat shed offers water views across to the
city. It serves French-inspired seafood in an elegant, yet informal, atmos-
phere of white tablecloths and natural lighting. You can see the chefs at
work in the open kitchen. You can’t go wrong with the signature dish: the
snapper fish pie with roasted tomatoes and mashed potatoes. Usually, nine
varieties of oysters are on the menu. Head here for a lunchtime treat. Catch
a taxi — it’s a little hard to find.
End of Ferry Road, Glebe. % 02/9518 9011. www.theboathouse.net.au.
Reservations recommended. Main courses: A$37–A$43 (US$30–US$34/£15–£17). AE,
DC, MC, V. Open: Tues–Sun noon to 2:30 p.m. and 6:30–10 p.m.
Bondi Icebergs/Icebergs Dining Room & Bar
$$$$
Bondi Beach
SEAFOOD/MEDITERRANEAN
This revamped swimming club complex overlooking Bondi Beach is a 
fabulous place to hang out. From its position on the cliffs, the Icebergs Bar
looks across the beach and water, and its floor-to-ceiling windows make
sure you get to experience what’s probably the best view in Sydney. The
bar features lots of cushions and even hammocks, and the views stretch
on across the balcony and into the restaurant. Inside it’s all frosted-glass
dividers (to match the color of the ocean), and white tablecloths and nap-
kins (to resemble the surf). Not surprisingly, seafood features highly on
the menu. You may find wild scallops, risotto with coral trout and oregano,
a fish stew from Livorno, and spaghetti with clams. Here too is the
Sundeck Café, which boasts a variety of light snacks and meals ranging
from focaccia, salads, and burgers to fresh local seafood and pasta, all
served out on a terrace with fantastic views.
1 Notts Ave., Bondi Beach. % 02/9365 9000. Reservations essential. Main courses:
A$36–A$44 (US$29–US$35/£15–£18). AE, DC, MC, V. Open: Tues–Sat noon to 3 p.m.
and 6.30–10:30 p.m., Sun noon to 3 p.m. and 6:30–9 p.m.
Part III: Sydney, Melbourne, and the ACT 
134

Botanic Gardens Restaurant
$$$
Circular Quay
MODERN AUSTRALIAN
You couldn’t ask for a better walk to a restaurant than through the Royal
Botanic Gardens, next to the Sydney Opera House. Enjoying lunch on the
wisteria-covered balcony in the middle of Sydney’s most beautiful park is
a treat every visitor should enjoy. Main courses often mix a bit of
Mediterranean, French, and Asian. They include the very popular white
sausage (boudin blanc) with lentils and braised fennel. Try perfect crème
brûlée with underlying plum purée for dessert (A$12/US$9.20/£4.60).
See map p. 132. In the Royal Botanic Gardens. % 02/9241 2419. Reservations rec-
ommended. Main courses: A$23–A$30 (US$18–US$24/£9–£12). AE, DC, MC, V. Open:
Daily 8 a.m.–4:30 p.m. Bus or ferry: Circular Quay.
Buena Vista Café
$
Town Hall
CAFE
If you happen to be in the city center, this fabulous, largely undiscovered
restaurant and cafe is a must for the great value and the absolutely fan-
tastic views reaching over Hyde Park and even to the harbor. It’s very large
inside, has panoramic windows, and serves meals from the counter. Hearty

The food is rich and the prices for main courses are high, but the food is

fried harbor prawns, or a delicious winter salad of raw fennel and arti-

three-story development. In a round building dominated by a giant golden
Buddha in the center, Chinta Ria serves fairly good “hawker-style” (read:
cheap and delicious) Malaysian food. Although the food is good, the
atmosphere is even more memorable. The service is slow, but who cares
in such an interesting space, with plenty of nooks, crannies, and society
folk to look at. There are seats outside (some within range of the noise of

Doyles at the Quay

Circular Quay
SEAFOOD
Doyles is synonymous with seafood in Sydney. Most customers sit outside
to enjoy the fabulous views across the harbor, though guardrails some-
what interrupt the view of the Opera House. The most popular dish is basi-
cally pricey fish and chips, which costs A$35 (US$28/£14). You can also
get a dozen oysters for A$30 (US$24/£12) or half a lobster for A$65
(US$52/£26). One word of advice: Australian lobsters (crayfish in reality)
aren’t as tasty as lobsters in other parts of the world. Still, if it’s a nice day,
it’s a nice place to sit.
A sister restaurant, Doyles on the Beach (% 02/9337 2007), is over at
Watsons Bay. Ferries run to Watsons Bay from Circular Quay Monday

This midsize eatery a ten-minute stroll up the main hill leading from The

The staff is friendly and the service professional. Portions are not huge,

eat at Guillaume at Bennelong. The restaurant is as uniquely designed as
the building itself, with tall glass windows that furrow around in an arch
and grab the harbor and Circular Quay by the throat. Renowned French
chef Guillaume Brahimi’s offerings include sealed veal sweetbreads, or
chicken breast with duck foie gras ravioli. Many would rather miss the first
half of the opera than leave before dessert. The best bar in town is

Debate rages over which cafe serves the best coffee in Sydney, which
has the best atmosphere, and which has the tastiest snacks. The main
cafe scenes center on Victoria Street in Darlinghurst, Stanley Street in
East Sydney, and King Street in Newtown. Other places, including
Balmoral Beach on the North Shore, Bondi Beach, and Paddington, all
have their own favored hangouts.
Americans will be sorry to learn that free refills of coffee are rare in
Australian restaurants and cafes. Expect a cup of coffee to cost from
A$2.50 to A$3 (US$2–US$2.40/£1–£1.40); main courses at the cafes in this
section run from about A$8 to A$15 (US$6.40–US$12/£3.20–£6).
Following are some of our favorites around town.
Bar Coluzzi
Kings Cross
Although it may no longer offer the best coffee in Sydney, this cafe’s claim
to fame is that it served real espresso when the rest of the city was drink-
ing Nescafé. People-watching is fun at this fashionably worn-around-the-
edges spot.
See map p. 132. 322 Victoria St., Darlinghurst. % 02/9380 5420. MC, V. Open: Daily 
5 a.m.–8 p.m. CityRail: Kings Cross.
Bill’s
Kings Cross
This bright, airy place, strewn with flowers and magazines, serves nou-
veau cafe-style food. It’s so popular you may have trouble finding a seat.
The signature breakfast dishes — including ricotta hotcakes with honey-
comb butter and banana, and sweet corn fritters with roast tomatoes and
bacon — are the stuff of legend.
See map p. 132. 433 Liverpool St., Darlinghurst. % 02/9360 9631. Fax: 02/9360 7302. AE,
MC, V. Open: Mon–Sat 7:30 a.m.–3 p.m. CityRail: Kings Cross.
Café Hernandez
Kings Cross
The walls of this tiny, cluttered cafe are crammed with eccentric fake mas-
terpieces, and the aroma of 20 types of coffee roasted and ground on the
premises permeates the air. It’s almost a religious experience for discern-
ing inner-city coffee addicts. The Spanish espresso is a treat.

See map p. 132. 60 Kings Cross Rd., Potts Point. % 02/9331 2343. www.cafe

The Old Coffee Shop
Town Hall
Sydney’s oldest coffee shop opened in the Victorian Strand Arcade in 1891.
The shop may or may not serve Sydney’s best java, but the old-world feel
of the place and the sugary snacks, cakes, and pastries make up for it. It’s
a good spot to take a break from shopping and sightseeing.
Ground floor, Strand Arcade. % 02/9231 3002. MC, V. Open: Mon–Fri 7:30 a.m.–5 p.m.,
Sat 8:30 a.m.–5 p.m., Sun 10:30 a.m.–4 p.m. CityRail: Town Hall.
Exploring Sydney
The only problem with visiting Sydney is fitting in everything you want
to do and see. Of course, you won’t want to miss the iconic attractions:
the Opera House and the Harbour Bridge. Everyone seems to be climb-
ing the arch of the bridge these days on the BridgeClimb Sydney Tour, so
look up for the tiny dots of people waving to the ferry passengers below.
You should also check out the native wildlife in Taronga Zoo and the
Sydney Aquarium, stroll around the tourist precinct of Darling
Harbour, and get a dose of Down Under culture at the not-too-large
Australian Museum. Also try to take time out to visit one of the nearby
national parks for a taste of the Australian bush. If it’s hot, take your
cozzie (swimsuit) and towel to Bondi Beach or Manly.
Sydney Harbour
Officially called Port Jackson, Sydney Harbour is the focal point of
Sydney and one of the features that makes this city so special. It’s
entered through the Heads, two bush-topped outcrops (you’ll see them
if you take a ferry or JetCat to Manly). The harbor laps at some 240km
(149 miles) of shoreline before stretching out into the Parramatta River.
Visitors are awestruck by the harbor’s beauty, especially at night, when
the sails of the Opera House and the girders of the Harbour Bridge are lit
up. During the day, it buzzes with green-and-yellow ferries pulling in and
out of busy Circular Quay, sleek tourist craft, fully rigged tall ships, giant
container vessels, and hundreds of white-sailed yachts.
The greenery along the harbor’s edges is a surprising feature, thanks to
the Sydney Harbour National Park, a haven for native trees and plants,
and a feeding and breeding ground for lorikeets and other nectar-eating
bird life. In the center of the harbor is a series of islands; the most
impressive is the tiny isle supporting Fort Denison, which once housed
convicts and acted as part of the city’s defense.

Chapter 11: Sydney 147

Attractions around Sydney Harbour
Royal Botanic Gardens
The gardens, next to the Sydney Opera House, were laid out in 1816 on the
site of a farm that supplied food for the colony. They’re informal in appear-
ance, with a scattering of duck ponds and open spaces, though several
areas are dedicated to particular plant species. These include the rose
garden, the cacti and succulent display, and the central palm and rain
forest groves (watch out for the thousands of large fruit bats, which chat-
ter and argue among the rain forest trees). Mrs. Macquarie’s Chair, along
the coast path, offers superb views of the Opera House and the Harbour
Bridge. The “chair” is a step cut out of sandstone with a huge stone plaque
on top. It bears the name of Elizabeth Macquarie (1788–1835), the wife of
Governor Lachlan Macquarie. (It’s a favorite stop for tour buses.) The
sandstone building dominating the gardens nearest to the Opera House is
the Government House, once the official residence of the governor of New
South Wales.
See map p. 146. Opposite Sydney Opera House. Admission: Free. Open: Daily 10 a.m.–4 p.m.
Sydney Harbour Bridge
Construction of the Sydney Harbour Bridge started in 1924, and it took
1,400 men eight years to complete. Today it rivals the Sydney Opera House
as the most photographed structure in Australia. The bridge, is 1,150m
(3,772 ft.) long and spans 503m (1,650 ft.) from the south shore to the
north. It has pedestrian walkways, two railway lines, and an eight-lane
road. The 30-minute stroll from one end to the other offers excellent
harbor views. From the other side, you can take a CityRail train from
Milsons Point back to the city (to Wynyard — change there for Circular
Quay, Town Hall, or Central). As you walk across, stop off at the Pylon
Lookout. From the top of this bridge support, 89m (292 ft.) above the
water, you get panoramic views of Sydney Harbour, the ferry terminals of

Circular Quay, and beyond. Reach the pylon by walking to the far end of
George Street in The Rocks toward the Harbour Bridge. Just past the
Mercantile pub, you’ll see some stone steps that take you onto
Cumberland Street. From there, it’s a two-minute walk to the steps under-
neath the bridge on your right. Climb four flights of stairs to reach the
bridge’s Western Footway, and then walk along to the first pylon. Note:
Climbing up inside the pylon involves 200 steps.

A$3.50 (US$3/£1.50) children over 7. Open: Daily 10 a.m.–5 p.m.
Sydney Opera House
Only a handful of buildings around the world are as architecturally and
culturally significant as the Sydney Opera House. And this white-sailed
construction caught midbillow over the waters of Sydney Cove is a work-
ing building. It’s a full-scale performing arts complex with five major
spaces. The biggest and grandest is the 2,690-seat Concert Hall, which has
the best acoustics of any building of its type in the world. Come here to
experience opera, chamber music, symphonies, dance, choral perform-
ances, and even rock ’n’ roll. The Opera Theatre is smaller, seating 1,547,
and books operas, ballets, and dance. The Drama Theatre, seating 544,
and the Playhouse, seating 398, specialize in plays and smaller-scale per-
formances. The Boardwalk, seating 300, is used for dance and experi-
mental music.
Danish Architect Jørn Utzon won an international competition to design
the Opera House. From the start, the project was controversial, with many
Sydneysiders believing it was a monstrosity. Following a disagreement,
Utzon returned home without ever seeing his finished project. Initially, the
project was budgeted at a cool A$7 million (US$5.6 million/£2.8 million),
but by the time it was finished in 1973 it had cost a staggering A$102 mil-
lion (US$82 million/£41 million). Since then, continual refurbishment and
the major task of replacing the asbestos-laden grouting between the hun-
dreds of thousands of white tiles that make up its shell has cost many mil-
lions more. A long-overdue reconstruction is being completed, aimed at
putting into practice what Jørn Utzon has long visualized. The Tourism
Services Department at the Sydney Opera House can book combination
packages, including dinner and a show; a tour, dinner, and a show; or a
champagne interval performance.

Exploring The Rocks
Sydney’s historic district is on the Harbour Bridge side of Circular Quay
hilly and cross-cut with alleyways. Some of Australia’s oldest pubs are
Chapter 11: Sydney 149

here, as well as fine restaurants, stores, and hotels. Pick up a walking
map from the visitor center and be sure to get off the main streets and
see the original houses that survived the bulldozers.
The Eora Aboriginal people originally inhabited the headland now
known as The Rocks for thousands of years. In 1788, British convicts and
their guards arrived. A jail was built where the Four Seasons Hotel now
stands, on George Street, and public hangings were common. Later it
evolved into a vibrant port community, though its history is colored
with outbreaks of plague, shanghaied sailors, and cut-throat gangs.
In 1973, bulldozers and protesters clashed with police over plans to tear
down many of the buildings. These resulted in the Green Bans, which
halted any further demolition. In 1975 a compromise was reached and
the bans were lifted, in return for heritage protection and community
consultation on future projects.
Today, there are 96 heritage buildings in The Rocks. The oldest is
Cadmans Cottage, built in 1815, while the Dawes Point Battery, built in
1791, is the oldest remaining European structure. On Observatory Hill
you’ll find the three remaining walls of Fort Phillip, built in 1804.

Walk on the wild side: Climbing 
the Harbour Bridge
At one time, only bridge workers had the opportunity to view Sydney from the top of
the main bridge arch. But now Sydneysiders and tourists can experience the spec-
tacular view and the exhilarating achievement of climbing to the top of one of
Australia’s icons.
In addition to the original climb up one of the arches, you can also do one called the
Discovery Climb. This takes climbers into the heart of the bridge. You traverse the sus-
pension arch and then wind your way through a tangle of hatchways and girders sus-
pended above the traffic. Both experiences take three hours from check-in at the
BridgeClimb base, 5 Cumberland St., The Rocks (% 02/9240 1100 or 02/8274 7777; fax
02/9240 1122; www.bridgeclimb.com), to completion. The office is open daily from
8 a.m. to 6 p.m., and climbers leave in small groups every ten minutes or so.
Climbers wear “Bridge Suits” and are harnessed to a line. Participants are breath-
tested for alcohol and are banned from carrying anything, including cameras. Climbs
cost A$165 (US$132/£66) adults, A$100 (US$80/£40) children 12 to 16 on weekdays
during the day and night; A$185 (US$148/£74) adults, A$125 (US$100/£50) children for
climbs on Saturday and Sunday. Daily twilight climbs cost A$245 (US$196/£99) adults,
A$185 (US$148/£74) children. Children under 12 are not allowed to climb. A dawn climb,
on the first Saturday each month, costs A$295 (US$236/£118) adults, A$195 (US$156/
£78) children. (Check first, as prices change often.)

Attractions in The Rocks
The Rocks Discovery Museum
This small but interesting museum is in a restored 1850s sandstone ware-
house. It tells the story of The Rocks from pre-European days to the pres-
ent. Learn about the area’s traditional landowners, the establishment of
the English colony, the sailors and traders who made the area their home,
and the protests that saved this unique part of Sydney.
See map p. 146. Kendall Lane, The Rocks. % 1800/067 676. Admission: Free. Open:
Daily 10 a.m.–5 p.m.
Museum of Contemporary Art (MCA)
This imposing sandstone museum set back from the water on The Rocks
side of Circular Quay offers wacky, entertaining, inspiring, and befuddling
displays of what’s new (and dated) in modern art. It houses the J. W. Power
Collection of more than 4,000 pieces, including works by Andy Warhol,
Christo, Marcel Duchamp, and Robert Rauschenberg, as well as temporary
exhibits. Free guided tours are conducted midweek at 11 a.m. and 1 p.m.
and on weekends at noon and 1:30 p.m. The MCA cafe (% 02/9241 4253)
is a nice spot, with good views of the harbor and Opera House. It’s serves
up Contemporary food from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily.

Admission: Free. Open: Daily 10 a.m.–6 p.m. (5 p.m. in winter).
Susannah Place Museum
This museum, set around a terrace of four houses, built in 1844, is a real
highlight of The Rocks area. It provides visitors with the opportunity to
explore domestic working-class life from 1844 to 1990. The modest interi-
ors and rear yards illustrate the restrictions of 19th-century inner-city life.
The many layers of the paint finishes, wallpapers, and floor coverings that
have survived provide a valuable insight into the tastes of the working
class. The original brick privies and open laundries are some of the earli-
est surviving washing and sanitary amenities remaining in the city. There’s
also a delightful little shop.

Darling Harbour attractions
Australian National Maritime Museum
Modern Australia owes almost everything to the sea, so it’s not surprising
that there’s a museum dedicated to ships, from Aboriginal vessels to sub-
marines. You’ll find ships’ logs and things to pull and tug at. Docked in the
harbor are several ships and launches, including an Australian Navy
Chapter 11: Sydney 151

destroyer, the Vampire; an Oberon Class submarine; and a replica of the
Endeavour, the ship Captain James Cook commanded when he laid claim
to Australia. You can clamber over many of them. Allow two hours.

Powerhouse Museum
Sydney’s most interactive museum is also one of the largest in the
Southern Hemisphere. In the postmodern industrial interior you’ll find all
sorts of displays and gadgets relating to the sciences, transportation,
human achievement, decorative art, and social history. The many hands-
on exhibits make this museum worthy of a couple of hours of your time.

dents and children 5–15, A$24 (US$19/£9.50) families. Open: Daily 9:30 a.m.–5 p.m.
Sydney Aquarium
This aquarium is one of the world’s best and should be near the top of
your itinerary. The main attractions are the underwater walkways through
two enormous tanks — one full of giant rays and gray nurse sharks and
the other where you can see the seals in action. Other excellent exhibits
include a magnificent section on the Great Barrier Reef, where thousands
of colorful fish school around coral outcrops. A touch-pool allows you to
stroke baby sharks. Try to visit during the week, when it’s less crowded.

Other top attractions
Hyde Park Barracks Museum
These Georgian-style barracks were designed in 1819 by the convict and
architect Francis Greenway. They were built by convicts and inhabited by
prisoners. These days they house relics from those early days, including
log books, early settlement artifacts, and a room full of ships’ hammocks
in which visitors can lie and listen to fragments of prisoner conversation.
The displays are far more straightforward than those at the Museum of
Sydney. The courtyard cafe is excellent.

Sydney Tower (Centrepoint Tower)
The tallest building in the Southern Hemisphere is not hard to miss — it
resembles a giant steel pole skewering a golden marshmallow. Standing
more than 300m (984 ft.) tall, the tower offers 360-degree views across
Sydney and as far as the Blue Mountains. An elevator takes you to the
indoor viewing platform on the top floor, so you don’t have to climb 1,504
steps. The ticket price includes admission to OzTrek, where visitors 
are strapped into moving chairs in front of a 180-degree screen. On this 
simulator ride, you white-water raft in Queensland, climb Uluru (Ayers
Rock), and have a close encounter with a saltwater crocodile. Don’t be too 
concerned if you feel the building tremble slightly, especially in a stiff
breeze — we’re told it’s perfectly natural. Below the tower are three floors
of stores and restaurants.
See map p. 146. 100 Market St. (another entrance on Pitt Street Mall). % 02/9333

A$14 (US$11/£5.50) children 4–15, A$60 (US$48/£24) families. Open: Sun–Fri 9 a.m.–
10:30 p.m., Sat 9 a.m.–11:30 p.m.
Sydney Tower Skywalk
You don a special suit, walk out onto a glass-floored platform 260m (853 ft.)
above the city floor and walk around the building. The views are breath-
taking (even between your feet!). You’re harnessed to a safety rail with a
sliding harness, so there’s no chance of falling off, and funny, well-informed
guides offer a helping hand to the nervous. Each Skywalk lasts approxi-
mately 90 minutes and operates daily from 9 a.m. to 10 p.m., with the last
Skywalk departing at 8:15 p.m. Cameras aren’t allowed for safety reasons,
but group or individual shots cost from A$20 (US$16/£8). Children under
10 aren’t allowed on the Skywalk.

Wildlife at Featherdale
If you have time to visit only one wildlife park in Sydney, make it the wonderful
Featherdale Wildlife Park, 217 Kildare Rd., Doonside (% 02/9622 1644; www.feather
dale.com.au). The park’s newest addition is the Reptilian Pavilion, which houses 30
native species of reptiles in 26 exhibits. To get there, head to Blacktown station, then
board bus no. 725 (ask the driver to tell you when to get off). By car: Take the M4 motor-
way to Reservoir Road and turn off; travel 4km (21⁄2 miles), and turn left at Kildare Road.
Admission is A$19 (US$15/£7.50) adults, A$9.50 (US$7.60/£3.80) children 3–15, A$55
(US$44/£22) families. It’s open daily from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.

9 a.m.–10 p.m. (last Skywalk departs 8:15 p.m.).
Attractions in the Sydney suburbs
Oceanworld Manly
Though not as impressive as Sydney Aquarium, you can combine
Oceanworld with a visit to Manly Beach for a nice outing. There’s a dis-
play of Barrier Reef fish, as well as giant sharks. Also here are the five most
venomous snakes in the world. Shark feeding is at 11 a.m. on Monday,
Wednesday, and Friday. There is a “dive with the sharks” program, where
you can get in the tanks with gray nurse sharks. It costs A$175 (US$140/
£70) for qualified divers, A$205 (US$164/£82) for divers who have logged
less than 15 dives or haven’t dived in the last six months, or A$235
(US$188/£94) for nonqualified divers (includes an introduction to scuba
diving course). To sign up, download an application from the Web site.
West Esplanade, Manly. % 02/8251 7878. www.oceanworld.com.au. Admission:
A$18 (US$14/£7) adults, A$9.50 (US$7.60/£3.70) children, A$44 (US$35/£17) families;
15 percent off admission prices after 3:30 p.m. Open: Daily 10 a.m.–5:30 p.m.
Taronga Zoo
Taronga has the best view of any zoo in the world. Set on a hill, it looks
over Sydney Harbour, the Opera House, and the Harbour Bridge. It’s easi-
est on the legs to explore the zoo from the top down. The main attractions
are the chimpanzee exhibit, the gorilla enclosure, and the Nocturnal
Houses, where you can see some of Australia’s nighttime marsupials,
including the platypus and the cuter-than-cute bilby (the Australian Easter
bunny). There’s an interesting reptile display, a couple of Komodo dragons,
a scattering of indigenous beasties — including a few koalas, echidnas,
kangaroos, dingoes, and wombats — and lots more. The kangaroo and wal-
laby exhibit is unimaginative; you’d be better off going to Featherdale
Wildlife Park (see the “Wildlife at Featherdale” sidebar). Animals are fed
at various times during the day. The zoo can get crowded on weekends,
so we recommend visiting during the week or in the morning on weekends.
Bradley’s Head Road, Mosman. % 02/9969 2777. Admission: A$32 (US$26/£13) adults,
A$18 (US$14/£7) children 4–15, A$84 (US$67/£33) families. Admission includes a trip on
the Aerial Safari cable car. Open: Daily 9 a.m.–5 p.m. (until 9 p.m. Jan).
More cool things to see and do
These are some other highly recommended things to see and do:
 In Darling Harbour is the IMAX Theatre Sydney (% 02/9281 3300;
www.imax.com.au), where, usually, four different IMAX films are
showing on the gigantic eight-story-high screen. Admission is A$18
(US$15/£7.50) adults, A$13 (US$11/£5.50) children 3–15, A$50
(US$40/£20) families. It’s open Sunday through Thursday from 
10 a.m. to 10 p.m., Friday and Saturday from 10 a.m. to 11:30 p.m.
Part III: Sydney, Melbourne, and the ACT 
154

 The site of the 2000 Olympic Games, Sydney Olympic Park,
Homebush Bay (% 02/9714 7888; www.sydneyolympicpark.nsw.
gov.au), is still very much a tourist attraction as well as a major
sporting venue. Most of the Olympic venues are here, as well as
plenty of bars and restaurants. Start at the Homebush Bay Infor-
mation Centre, which has displays, walking maps, and tour tips.
There are several tours available. It’s open daily from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.
 A trip to Australia should always include a bit of nature. If you like
huge crocs and such, head to the Australian Reptile Park, Pacific
Highway, Somersby (% 02/4340 1022; www.reptilepark.com.au).
What started as a one-man operation supplying snake antivenin in the
early 1950s has become a nature park teeming with the slippery-
looking creatures. But it’s not all snakes and lizards; you’ll also find
saltwater crocodiles and American alligators, as well as plenty of
somewhat cuddlier creatures, such as koalas, platypuses, walla-
bies, dingoes, and flying foxes. Admission is A$22 (US$18/£9)
adults, A$12 (US$9/£4.50) children 3 to 15, A$60 (US$42/£21) fami-
lies. It’s open daily from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.
 Sydney’s latest wildlife addition is Sydney Wildlife World,
Aquarium Pier, Darling Harbour (% 02/9333 9288; www.sydney
wildlifeworld.com.au). There are a few highlights here, includ-
ing a cassowary (a flightless bird about the size of an emu, but
armed with a dangerous spiked toe) and some endangered yellow-
footed rock wallabies. Discount tickets are available if you book
online, and you can buy a special Attractions Pass, which allows
discounted entry to Sydney Wildlife World, Sydney Aquarium, and
Sydney Tower. Admission is A$29 (US$23/£12) adults, A$14 (US$11/
£5.50) children 3 to 15, A$68 (US$54/£27) families. It’s open daily
from 9 a.m. to 10 p.m.
 Stargazers will love Sydney Observatory, Observatory Hill, Watson
Road, Millers Point, The Rocks (% 02/9241 3767). The city’s only
major museum of astronomy offers visitors a chance to see the
southern skies through modern and historic telescopes. The intro-
duction of a new Space Theatre 3D ride, which takes you zooming
through the stars, makes it worth visiting during the day as well as
the evening. Admission during the day is A$7 (US$5.60/£2.80)
adults, A$5 (US$4/£2) children, A$20 (US$16/£8) families; guided
night tours (reservations required) cost A$15 (US$12/£6) adults,
A$10 (US$8/£4) children, A$40 (US$32/£16) families. It’s open daily
from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m.
Getting a Tan on Sydney’s Beaches
One of the big bonuses of visiting Sydney in the summer (Dec–Feb) is that
you get to experience the beaches in their full glory. Most major city
beaches, such as Manly and Bondi, have lifeguards (or “lifesavers” as they
are called in Australia) on patrol. They check the water conditions and are
Chapter 11: Sydney 155

on the lookout for rips — strong currents that can pull a swimmer far out
to sea. Safe places to swim are marked by red and yellow flags.
One of the first things visitors wonder when they hit the water in
Australia is, “Are there sharks?” The answer is yes, but they’re rarely
spotted inshore — you’re far more likely to spy a migrating whale.
Sharks have more reason to be scared of humans than we have to be
scared of them; most sharks end up as the fish in your average packet of
fish and chips. Though some beaches — such as the small beach next to
the Manly ferry wharf and a section of Balmoral Beach in Mosman —
have permanent shark nets, most rely on portable nets that are moved
from beach to beach.
Another common problem are blue bottles — small blue jellyfish, often
called stingers in Australia and Portuguese-men-o’-war elsewhere. Blue
bottles deliver a hefty punch from their many stinging cells, causing a
burning sensation almost immediately. Wearing a T-shirt in the water
reduces the risk somewhat (though a pair of jeans isn’t a good idea). If
you’re stung, rinse the area liberally with seawater or fresh water to
remove any tentacles stuck in the skin. For intense pain, apply heat or
cold, whichever feels better. If you experience breathing difficulties or
disorientation, seek medical attention immediately.
Sydney’s best beaches
Sydney’s most famous beach is Bondi. In many ways, it’s a raffish ver-
sion of a California beach, with plenty of tanned skin and in-line skaters.
Though the beach is nice, it’s cut off from the cafe and restaurant strip
that caters to beachgoers by a road that pedestrians have to funnel
across in order to reach the sand. On summer weekend evenings it’s
popular with souped-up cars and groups of kids from the suburbs.
If you follow the water along to your right at Bondi, you’ll come across a
scenic cliff-top trail that takes you to Bronte Beach (a 20-minute walk),
via gorgeous little Tamarama, nicknamed “Glamourama” for its trendy
sun worshippers. This boutique beach is known for its dangerous rips.
Bronte has better swimming than Bondi.
Clovelly Beach, farther along the coast, is blessed with a large rock pool
carved into a rock platform and sheltered from the force of the Tasman
Sea. This beach is wheelchair-accessible via a series of ramps.
The cliff walk from Bondi will eventually bring you to Coogee, which has
a pleasant strip of sand with a couple of hostels and hotels nearby.
On the North Shore, you find Manly, a long curve of golden sand edged
with Norfolk Island pines. Follow the crowds shuffling through the
pedestrian Corso to the main ocean beach.
From Manley, looking at the ocean, head to your right along the beach-
front and follow the coastal path to small, sheltered Shelly Beach, a nice
Part III: Sydney, Melbourne, and the ACT 
156

area for snorkeling and swimming. (A small takeout outlet sells drinks
and snacks.) Follow the path up the hill to the parking lot. Here, a track
cuts up into the bush and leads toward a firewall, which marks the
entrance to the Sydney Harbour National Park. Around here you have
spectacular ocean views across to Manly and the northern beaches (the
headland farther in the distance is Palm Beach).
Farther north along the coast are a string of ocean beaches. They
include the surf spots of Curl Curl, Dee Why, Narrabeen, Mona Vale,
Newport, Avalon, and Palm Beach, a long and beautiful strip of sand
separated from the calmer waters of Pittwater by sand dunes and a golf
course. Here you find the Barrenjoey Lighthouse, which offers fine views
along the coast.
The best harbor beach is at Balmoral, a North Shore hangout with some
good cafes and two good, upmarket beach-view restaurants — the
Bathers Pavilion (% 02/9969 5050) and The Watermark (% 02/9968
3433). The beach is split into three parts. As you look toward the sea,
the middle section is the most popular with sunbathers, and the wide
expanse to your left and the sweep of beautiful sand to your right have a
mere scattering. There’s a caged pool area for swimming.
Sydney’s Parks and National Parks
As well as the Botanic Gardens, Sydney is blessed with plenty of parks
and green spaces. Further afield, to the south and the north, are two
magnificent national parks.
In the center of the city is Hyde Park, a favorite with lunching business-
people. Of note are the Anzac Memorial to Australian and New Zealand
troops killed in the wars, and the Archibald Fountain, complete with
spitting turtles and sculptures of Diana and Apollo. At night, lights illu-
minate avenues of trees, giving the place a lovely appearance.
Also popular is Centennial Park, usually entered from the top of Oxford
Street. It opened in 1888 to celebrate the centenary of European settle-
ment, and today it encompasses huge areas of lawn, several lakes, picnic
areas with outdoor grills, cycling and running paths, and a cafe.
A hundred years later, Bicentennial Park, at Australia Avenue, in Home-
bush Bay, came along. Forty percent of the park’s total 100 hectares (247
acres) is general parkland reclaimed from a city dump; the rest is the
largest existing remnant of wetlands on the Parramatta River and is
home to many species of local and migratory birds.
You don’t need to go far to experience Sydney’s nearest national park.
The Sydney Harbour National Park stretches around parts of the inner
harbor and includes several small islands. The best walk through the
Sydney Harbour National Park is the Manly to Spit Bridge Scenic
Walkway. This 10km (6-mile) track winds its way from Manly (it starts
Chapter 11: Sydney 157

near the Oceanarium) via Dobroyd Head to Spit Bridge, where you can
catch a bus back to the city. The walk takes around three hours at a
casual pace, and the views across Sydney Harbour are fabulous.
Other access points to the park include tracks around Taronga Zoo (ask
the zoo staff to point you toward the obscured entrances) and above
tiny Shelly Beach, opposite the main beach at Manly.
Also part of the national park is the restored Fort Denison, that tiny
island fort you can see in the middle of the harbor between Circular
Quay and Manly. The fort was built during the Crimean War in response
to fears of a Russian invasion, and was later used as a penal colony.
Heritage Tours of the island leave from Cadmans Cottage, 110 George
St., The Rocks (% 02/9247 5033), at 11:30 a.m. and 2:30 p.m. Wednesday
through Sunday. They cost A$22 (US$18/£9) adults, A$18 (US$14/£7) chil-
dren, A$72 (US$58/£29) families. The return ferry trip, tour, and time
spent on the island means you should plan on three hours or so.
To the northeast of the city center is Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park
(% 02/9457 9322 or 02/9457 9310). It’s a great place to take a bushwalk
through gum trees and rain forest on the lookout for wildflowers, sand-
stone rock formations, and Aboriginal art. There are plenty of tracks
through the park; one of our favorites is a relatively easy 2.5km (11⁄2-
mile) tramp to The Basin (Track 12). The well-graded dirt path takes you
down to a popular estuary with a beach and passes some significant
Aboriginal engravings. There are also wonderful water views over Pitt-
water from the picnic areas at West Head. The park is open from sunrise
to sunset, and admission is A$11 (US$8.80/£4.40) per car. You can either
drive to the park or catch a ferry from Palm Beach to The Basin (from
there, you can walk up Track 12 and back). Ferries run on the hour
(except at 1 p.m.) from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily and cost A$4.50 (US$3.60/
£1.80) one-way; call % 02/9918 2747 for details.
South of Sydney is the Royal National Park, Farrell Avenue, Sutherland
(% 02/9542 0648). It’s the world’s oldest national park, declared in
1879. There’s a visitor center at Audley Weir (past the main park
entrance). You have to pay a A$11 (US$8.80/£4.40) per-car fee to enter
the park.
There are several ways to reach the park, but our favorites are the little-
known access points from Bundeena and Otford. To get to Bundeena,
take a CityRail train from Central Station to the seaside suburb of
Cronulla (around one hour). Just below the train station, through an
underpass, you’ll find Cronulla Wharf. From there, hop on the delightful
little ferry run by National Park Ferries (% 02/9523 2990) to Bundeena,
which we highly recommend you visit. Ferries run on the half-hour from
Cronulla (except 12:30 p.m. on weekdays). The last one back from
Bundeena is at 7 p.m. (6 p.m. in winter). After you get off the ferry, the
first turn on your left just up the hill will take you through part of the vil-
lage to wonderful Jibbon Beach. Walk along the beach to the end, hop up
Part III: Sydney, Melbourne, and the ACT 
158

some rocks, and follow the track (about 20 minutes) through the park to
Jibbon Head, for some stunning ocean views.
Look for the Aboriginal rock carvings off to your right before you reach
it (a sign points toward the headland, but the carvings are to your right).
It’s around a three-hour round-trip walk to Marley Beach (which has
strong surf and dangerous rips) and a six-hour round-trip to beautiful
Wattamolla, where there’s safe swimming for children in the salty
lagoon. The ferry returns to Cronulla from Bundeena hourly on the hour
(except 1 p.m. on weekdays). The fare is A$5.20 (US$4/£2) each way.
An alternative way to reach the park is to take the train from Central
Station to Otford, then climb the hill up to the sea cliffs. The entrance 
to the national park is a little tricky to find, so you may have to ask
directions — but roughly, it’s just to the left of a cliff top popular for
hang gliding, radio-controlled airplanes, and kites. A two-hour walk from
the sea cliffs through beautiful and varying bushland and a palm forest
will take you to Burning Palms Beach. There is no water along the route.
The walk back up is steep, so attempt this trek only if you’re reasonably
fit. Trains to the area from Central Station are irregular, and the last one
departs around 4 p.m., so give yourself at least two-and-a-half hours for
the return trip to the train station to make sure you don’t get stranded.
You can walk the memorable 26km (16 miles) from Otford to Bundeena,
or vice versa, in two days. (Take all your food, water, and camping gear.)
The track sticks to the coast, crosses several beaches, and is relatively
easy to follow.

160

The one-stop shop for tickets and information on all harbor cruises is
the Australian Travel Specialists (% 02/9247 5151; www.atstravel.
com.au). Checking Web sites before you come to Australia, or popping
into a ticket office at Darling Harbour or Circular Quay, is a good idea,
because cruise options, departure times, and prices change frequently.
Bus tours
Bright red Sydney Explorer buses operate every day, traveling a 28km
(18-mile) circuit and stopping at 27 places. These include the Sydney
Opera House, the Royal Botanic Gardens, the State Library, Mrs.
Macquarie’s Chair, the Art Gallery of New South Wales, Kings Cross,
Elizabeth Bay House, Wynyard CityRail station, the Queen Victoria
Building, Sydney Tower, the Australian Museum, Central Station,
Chinatown, Darling Harbour, and The Rocks. Buses depart from Circular
Quay at 18-minute intervals starting at 8:40 a.m., with the last “round-
trip” service departing Circular Quay at 5:20 p.m. (and returning to
Chapter 11: Sydney 161
A cruise of Aboriginal origins
The Deerubbun, a former Australian navy torpedo recovery vessel, makes quite an
impression as it pulls up to the dock near the Opera House concourse with speakers
blaring out a recording of clap sticks and didgeridoos. The boat revolutionized the
Sydney cruise industry in late 2006 by offering an Aboriginal perspective of the famous
waterway.
Tourists learn that Circular Quay was once occupied by the Cadigal people. They also
learn about Bennelong, the captured Aborigine who once lived on the point where the
Opera House now stands, and his wife, Barangaroo, who opposed her husband’s con-
ciliatory efforts with the Europeans.
The boat putters past the Royal Botanic Gardens, and the guide tells stories of the
early Europeans and their hopeless farms, and the smallpox epidemic of 1789, which
the local Aborigines thought was caused by evil spirits. Mixed in with the observa-
tions of the landscape are tales of the first Aboriginal tour guides, who took early set-
tlers inland from the harbor, as well as mentions of soldiers, statesmen, and farmers
who came into contact with the Aborigines — and much more.
Tourists disembark at Clark Island to see cave shelters with roofs stained black from
ancient fireplaces, convict engravings, and a natural fish trap. Two Aboriginal guides,
their bodies plastered in ghostly white ocher, beat a rhythm with hardwood sticks and
growl through a didgeridoo, as they beckon the tourists to the Welcoming Ceremony.
Then comes a repertoire of haunting songs, music, and dance. Every visitor to Sydney
should do this trip.
Aboriginal Cultural Cruises depart Tuesday through Saturday at 12:45 p.m. from the
Eastern Pontoon (near the Sydney Opera House). The cost is A$55 (US$44/£22) adults,
A$45 (US$36/£18) children 5 to 14. Tickets are available from Sydney Visitor Centres.
For more information, call % 02/9699 3491 or go to www.tribalwarrior.org.

Circular Quay at 7 p.m.). Hop on and off anywhere along the route where
you see the red Sydney Explorer sign, and leave at any attraction along
the way. If you want to stay on the bus from start to finish, the full circuit
takes one-and-a-half hours.
The Bondi & Bay Explorer also operates every day, traveling a 30km
(19-mile) circuit around the eastern harborside bays and coastal
beaches. Stops along the way include Kings Cross, Double Bay, Watsons
Bay, Bondi Beach, Bronte Beach, Coogee Beach, Paddington, Oxford
Street, and Martin Place. The bus departs from Circular Quay at 25-
minute intervals starting at 9:15 a.m., with the last “round-trip” service
departing Circular Quay at 4:20 p.m. (and returning to Circular Quay at
5:55 p.m.). Board anywhere along the route where you see the Bondi &
Bay Explorer sign, and get off at any attraction along the way. If you want
to stay on board from start to finish without making any stops, the entire
circuit takes one-and-a-half hours.
Tickets entitle you to free travel on regular blue and white Sydney Buses
within the same zones covered by your Explorer tickets until midnight.
You also get discounts on some attractions, such as a 15 percent dis-
count on tickets to Sydney Aquarium.
Combined one-day tickets for both buses cost A$39 (US$31/£15) adults,
A$18 (US$14/£7) children 4 to 16, A$97 (US$77/£39) families. Buy tickets
on board the bus. You can also buy a two-day ticket for A$68 (US$54/
£28) adults, A$34 (US$27/£13) children, A$170 (US$136/£68) families; you
must use the second-day portion within eight days.
Walking tours
The center of Sydney is compact, and you can see a lot in a day on foot.
 If you want to find out more about Sydney’s history, then book a
guided tour with The Rocks Walking Tour (% 02/9247 6678;
www.rockswalkingtours.com.au), based at 23 Playfair St., Rocks
Square. Excellent walking tours leave Monday through Friday at

www.therockspubtour.com), a journey aimed at illuminating the
lives of the sailors and whalers that once lived around here. You get
to meet some of the locals, visit three historic pubs, wander around
the alleyways, try a brew, and enjoy special offers for pub meals.
The one-and-a-half-hour tour departs from Cadman’s Cottage at 
5 p.m. Monday, Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday. It costs A$35
(US$28/£14). You must be at least 18 (the legal drinking age in

Part III: Sydney, Melbourne, and the ACT 
162

 A journey with a difference is Weird Sydney Ghost and History
Tours (% 02/9943 0167; www.destinytours.com.au). The tour —
in a hearse — is fascinating and fun. It explores a section of historic
Sydney and more modern additions, including a former VD clinic,
the Sydney Opera House, and some buildings along Macquarie
Street. The two-and-a-half-hour trip costs A$72 (US$58/£29) adults,
A$36 (US$29/£14) children. The tour leaves nightly at 8 p.m. (7 p.m. 
in winter).
Shopping the Local Stores
You’ll find plenty of places to keep your credit cards in action in Sydney.
Generally speaking, it’s not a particularly expensive place to shop, but if
you’re from foreign shores, a lot depends on how your currency is trad-
ing at the time.
The best shopping areas
Most shops of interest to the visitor are in The Rocks and along George
and Pitt streets (including the shops below the Sydney Tower and along
Pitt Street Mall). Other precincts worth checking out are Mosman on the
North Shore and Double Bay in the eastern suburbs for boutique shop-
ping, Chatswood for its general shopping centers, the Sydney Fish-
market for the sake of it, and weekend markets, listed here:
 Don’t miss the Queen Victoria Building (QVB), on the corner of
Market and George streets. This Victorian shopping arcade is one
of the prettiest in the world and has some 200 boutiques — mostly
men’s and women’s fashion — on four levels. The arcade is open 24
hours, but the shops do business Monday through Saturday from 
9 a.m. to 6 p.m. (Thurs to 9 p.m.) and Sunday from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m.
 The Strand Arcade (between Pitt Street Mall and George Street)
was built in 1892 and is interesting for its architecture and small
boutiques, food stores, and cafes, and the Downtown Duty Free
store on the basement level.
 Oxford Street runs from the city to Bondi Junction through
Paddington and Darlinghurst and is home to countless clothing
stores for the style conscious. You could spend anywhere from two
hours to a whole day making your way from one end to the other.
Detour down William Street once you get to Paddington to visit the
headquarters of celebrated international Australian designer
Collette Dinnigan. On the same street are the trendy boutiques
Belinda and Corner Store (cutting-edge designs), and Pelle and Di
Nuovo (luxury recycled goods).
What to look for and where to find it
Regular shopping hours are generally Monday through Wednesday and
Friday from 8:30 a.m. or 9 a.m. to 6 p.m., Thursday from 8:30 a.m. or 9 a.m.
Chapter 11: Sydney 163

to 9 p.m., Saturday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. or 5:30 p.m., and Sunday from 
10 a.m. or 10:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. Exceptions are noted in the store listings
in the following sections.
Aboriginal artifacts and crafts
Despite the reports you may have heard of Aboriginal art fetching
record prices, unless you know an awful lot about it you can only hope
to buy something that may look good on your wall, rather than some-
thing that will increase in value.
If we were in the market for a decent boomerang or didgeridoo we’d
head to Gavala Aboriginal Art & Cultural Education Centre, Shop 131,
Harbourside, Darling Harbour (% 02/9212 7232). Gavala is owned and
operated by Aborigines, and it stocks plenty of authentic Aboriginal
crafts, including carved emu eggs, grass baskets, cards, and books. A
first-rate painted didgeridoo will cost anywhere from A$100 to A$450
(US$80–US$360/£40–£180). The store is open daily from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m.
Quality Aboriginal art from some of Australia’s best-known painters is on
sale at Original & Authentic Aboriginal Art, 79 George St., The Rocks
(% 02/9251 4222). Artists whose work is represented include Paddy
Fordham Wainburranga, whose paintings hang in the White House in
Washington. Expect to pay in the range of A$1,000 to A$4,000 (US$800–
US$3,200/£400–£1,600) for the larger paintings. There are some nice
painted pots here, too, costing A$30 to A$80 (US$24–US$64/£15–£32).
The gallery is open daily from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.
Art prints and originals
The Rocks is the place to come for expensive things for your wall. Try
Billich, 104 George St., The Rocks (% 02/9252 1481), a fine-art gallery
featuring Sydney scenes intermingled with Asian-influenced on a grand
scale. It’s open daily from 9 a.m. to 8 p.m.
Ken Done is known for having designed his own Australian flag, which he
hopes to raise over Australia if it abandons its present one. The colorful
art at Done Art and Design, 1 Hickson Rd. (off George Street), The Rocks
(% 02/9247 2740), is his. The clothing designs — which feature printed
sea- and beachscapes, the odd colorful bird, and lots of pastels — are by
his wife, Judy. It’s open daily from 10 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.
Books
You’ll find a good selection of books on Sydney and Australia at the Art
Gallery of New South Wales, the Garden Shop in the Royal Botanic
Gardens, the Museum of Contemporary Art, the Australian Museum,
and the State Library of New South Wales.
Among the best general bookstores are Abbey’s Bookshop, 131 York St.,
behind the QVB (% 02/9264 3111); Angus & Robertson Bookworld,
168 Pitt St., Pitt Street Mall (% 02/9235 1188); and Borders, Skygarden,
Part III: Sydney, Melbourne, and the ACT 
164

77 Castlereagh St. (entrance also on Pitt Street Mall; % 02/9235 2433).
Borders has a wonderful magazine section as well as thousands of titles.
Goulds Book Arcade, 32 King St., Newtown (% 02/9519 8947), is burst-
ing at the seams with many thousands of secondhand and new books; its
open daily from 8 a.m. to midnight. You can find hundreds of travel
guides, maps, Australiana titles, coffee-table books, and accessories at
the Travel Bookshop, Shop 3, 175 Liverpool St. (across from the south-
ern end of Hyde Park, near the Museum CityRail station; % 02/9261
8200); it’s open Monday through Friday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. and
Saturday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. There’s also an Amex counter at the
Travel Bookshop.
Crafts
Some of Australia’s most respected craft artists and designers are repre-
sented at Collect, 88 George St., The Rocks (% 02/9247 7984). There are
some wonderful glass, textile, ceramic, jewelry, metal, and wood-turned
items for sale. It’s open daily from 9:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.
Department stores
The two big names in Sydney shopping are David Jones and Myer. 
Both stores are open Monday through Wednesday and Friday through
Saturday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m., Thursday from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m., and
Sunday from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m.
David Jones (% 02/9266 5544) is the city’s largest department store,
selling everything from fashion to designer furniture. You’ll find the
women’s section on the corner of Elizabeth and Market streets, and the
men’s section on the corner of Castlereagh and Market streets. The food
section here is the best in Australia by far.
Myer (% 02/9238 9111), formally Grace Brothers, is similar to David
Jones, but the building is newer and flashier. It’s on the corner of George
and Market streets.
Duty-free shops
Sydney has several duty-free shops selling goods at a discount. To take
advantage of the bargains, you need a passport and a flight ticket, and
you must export what you buy. The duty-free shop with the best buys is
Downtown Duty Free, which has two city outlets, one in the Strand
Arcade, off Pitt Street Mall (% 02/9233 3166), and one at 105 Pitt St. 
(% 02/9221 4444). Five more stores are at Sydney International Airport
and are open from the first to the last flight of the day.
Fashion
The best places to shop for fashion are the QVB and the Sydney Central
Plaza (on the ground floor of the mall next to the Myer department store
on Pitt Street Mall). Fashion-statement stores featuring the best of
Chapter 11: Sydney 165

Australian design at the QVB include Oroton, Country Road, and the 
fabulous woman’s clothing designer Lisa Ho. In the Strand Arcade, off
Pitt Street Mall, find Third Millennium, Allanah Hill, and Wayne Cooper.
The major Pitt Street Mall outlets will also keep you up to date.
Other fashion shopping meccas in or close to Pitt Street Mall include the
Glasshouse and the MLC Centre, which are linked to one another via a
covered overpass. Farther down toward Circular Quay is Chifley Plaza,
home to a selection of the world’s most famous and stylish international
brands. For really trendy clothing, walk up Oxford Street to Paddington,
and for alternative clothes, go to Newtown.
Australian Outback clothing
Moleskin trousers may not be the height of fashion at the moment, 
but you never know. R. M. Williams boots are famous for being both
tough and fashionable. You’ll find Akubra hats, Driza-bone coats, and
kangaroo-skin belts at R. M. Williams, 389 George St. (between Town
Hall and Central CityRail stations; % 02/9262 2228).
Located between Town Hall and Central CityRail stations is Thomas
Cook Boot & Clothing Company, 790 George St., Haymarket (% 02/
9212 6616), which specializes in Australian boots, Driza-bone coats, 
and Akubra hats. There’s another shop at 129 Pitt St., near Martin Place
(% 02/9232 3334).
Men’s fashion
Not-so-cheap but colorful clothes come from designer store Esprit Mens,
Shop 10G, Sydney Central Plaza, 450 George St. (% 02/9233 7349).
Quality clothing with a yachting influence is at Outdoor Heritage, Shop
13G, Sydney Central Plaza, 450 George St. (% 02/9235 1560), a good-
looking store specializing in casual, colorful gear.
Women’s fashion
In addition to the places listed below, head to Oxford Street (particu-
larly Paddington) for more avant-garde designers.
Internationally lauded and locally adored, few have left such an indelible
watermark on the Australian fashion pages as Akira Isagawa, 12A Queen
St., Woollahra (% 02/9361 5221). Those who love shoes can’t go past
the cute little Belinda, 39 William St., Paddington (% 02/9380 8728),
just off Oxford Street. Meanwhile, movie sirens, pop royalty, and the
world’s most glamorous women all appreciate the seriously sexy designs
at Collette Dinnigan, 33 William St., Paddington (% 02/9360 6691).
Food
The goodies you’ll find in the food section of David Jones department
store on Castlereagh Street are enough to tempt anyone. The store sells
the best local and imported products to the rich and famous (and the

rest of us). One of the few supermarkets in the city center is Coles,
Wynyard Station, Castlereagh Street, Wynyard (% 02/9299 4769); it’s
open daily from 6 a.m. to midnight.
Darrell Lea Chocolates, at the corner of King and George streets (% 02/
9232 2899), is the oldest location of Australia’s most famous chocolate
shop. Pick up some wonderful handmade chocolates as well as other
unusual candies, including the best licorice this side of the Casbah.
At Sydney Fishmarkets, at the corner of Bank Street and Pyrmont Bridge
Road, Pyrmont (% 02/9004 1100), you can see and buy the catch of the
day. It’s open daily from 7 a.m. to 4 p.m. Also here is a Doyles restaurant
and a sushi bar, a couple of cheap seafood eateries, and a good deli.
Markets
Several markets operate across central Sydney and out in the nearby
suburbs, especially on weekends. Saturday markets include Paddington
Bazaar, in the grounds of St. Johns Church, Oxford Street, which special-
izes in everything from essential oils and designer clothes to New Age
jewelry and Mexican hammocks.
Sunday markets include Bondi Markets, on Campbell Parade, while the
Rocks Market is held in The Rocks every Saturday and Sunday. This
touristy market has more than 100 vendors selling everything from
crafts, housewares, and posters to jewelry and curios.
Living It Up after Dark
Australians are party animals when they’re in the mood; whether it’s a
few beers around the barbecue with friends or an all-night rave at a
trendy dance club, they’re always on the lookout for the next event. The
best way to find out what’s on is to get hold of the “Metro” section of the
Friday Sydney Morning Herald or the “Seven Days” pullout from the
Thursday Daily Telegraph.
The performing arts
If you have a chance to see a performance in the Sydney Opera House,
jump at it. The “House” is not that impressive inside, but the walk back
after the show toward the ferry terminals at Circular Quay, with the
Sydney Harbour Bridge lit up and the crowd all around you — well,
you’ll want the moment to stay with you forever. Dress is smart casual.
The Australian Chamber Orchestra performs at various venues around
the city, from nightclubs to specialized music venues, including the
Concert Hall in the Sydney Opera House. Opera Australia performs at
the Sydney Opera House’s Opera Theatre. The opera runs January
through March and June through November. The Sydney Symphony
Orchestra performs throughout the year in the Opera House’s Concert
Chapter 11: Sydney 167

Hall. The main symphony season runs March through November, and
there’s a summer season in February.
Sydney’s blessed with plenty of theaters — we list just a few here. Check
the Sydney Morning Herald, especially the Friday edition, for information
on what’s currently in production.
 The Belvoir Street Theatre, 25 Belvoir St., Surry Hills (% 02/9699
3444), is home to Company B, which pumps out powerful local and
international plays upstairs in a wonderfully moody main theater.
Downstairs, a smaller venue generally shows more experimental
productions, such as Aboriginal performances and dance.
 The Capital Theatre, 17 Campbell St., Haymarket, near Town Hall
(% 02/9320 5000), is Sydney’s grandest theater and plays host to
major international and local productions like (cough) Australian
singing superstar Kylie Minogue. It’s also been the Sydney home of
musicals such as Miss Saigon and My Fair Lady.
 The Wharf Theatre, Pier 4, Hickson Road, The Rocks (% 02/9250
1777; www.sydneytheatre.com.au), is on a wharf on the edge of
Sydney Harbour. The long walk from the entrance of the pier to the
theater along creaky wooden floorboards builds up excitement for
the show. The Sydney Theatre Company is based here.
All that jazz and more
Jazz places, along with music venues in general, are few and far between
in Sydney, partly because investors can make more money out of
installing dozens of pokies (one-arm bandits).
 One of Australia’s hottest jazz clubs is The Basement, 29 Reiby
Place, Circular Quay (% 02/9251 2797; www.thebasement.com.au),
which also manages to squeeze in plenty of blues, folk, and funk.
Make reservations. Call for the schedule, pick up one at the club, or
visit the Web site.
 A medium-size rock venue with space for 1,000, the Metro, 624
George St. (% 02/9264 2666), is the best place in Sydney to see
local and international acts.
Dance clubs
Clubs come and go, and change names and music, so check the latest
with a phone call. You can also check the “Metro” section in the Friday
Sydney Morning Herald; free newspapers available in some bars along
Oxford Street have info about the latest clubs. Nightclub entrance
charges change regularly, but generally are A$15 to A$20 (US$12–
US$16/£6–£8).
Part III: Sydney, Melbourne, and the ACT 
168

 Dragonfly, Earl Street, Potts Point (% 02/9356 2666), is a club
tucked away in less then salubrious surroundings. It features a
cocktail bar, dance floor, and booths flush with leather chairs.
Dress trendy. There’s rhythm and blues on weekdays and house
music on weekends. Weekends attract a hip crowd in their 30s. It’s
open Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday from 9 p.m. to 5 a.m.
 Another favorite is Home, Cockle Bay Wharf, Darling Harbour 
(% 02/9267 0654). It’s cavelike in shape and feel, with a balcony 
to look down upon the throng. There’s a “silver room” for serious
ravers. Friday nights are big for trance and hip-hop, Saturdays for
house music. It’s open Friday through Saturday from 11 p.m. to
dawn.
 If you’re in town any night of the week, then the Q Bar, 44 Oxford
St. (% 02/9360 1375) will be open. It attracts a varied crowd from
youngsters to wrinklies, and has everything from a dance floor to
pool tables. It’s open daily from 9 p.m. to 7 a.m.
Gay and lesbian clubs
Sydney has a huge gay community, so there’s a very happening scene.
The center of it all is Oxford Street, though Newtown has established
itself as a major gay hangout, too. For information on events, pick up a
copy of the Sydney Star Observer or Lesbians on the Loose, available at
art-house cinemas, cafes, and stores around Oxford Street. Nightclub
entrance charges generally range from A$10 to A$15 (US$8–US$12/£4–£6).
 Popular gay clubs include Arq, 16 Flinders St., Taylors Square,
Darlinghurst (% 02/9380 8700; Open: Thurs–Sun 9 p.m.–9 a.m.), 
a 24-hour club with an amazing light show and some of the best 
DJs in town; and Taxi Club, 40 Flinders St., Darlinghurst (near
Taylor Square), Oxford Street (% 02/9331 4256; Open: Mon–Thurs
10 a.m.–2 a.m., Fri–Sun 10 a.m.–6 a.m.), a Sydney institution good
for old pop and new pop.
Chapter 11: Sydney 169
Sydney gay and lesbian Mardi Gras
Each March, Sydney lights up to the biggest carnival this side of Rio. Some 450,000
people pack into the city center, concentrated on Oxford Street, to watch as members
of Sydney’s GLBT communities pack a punch with colorful floats and frocks. The crowd
is diverse, from kids to grannies, and those in the know bring a stepladder or milk crate
to get a better view. Sydney’s hotels are at their busiest during Mardi Gras, particularly
anything with a view of the route. The post-parade party is an affair not for the faint-
hearted! Sequins, tight pants, and anything outrageously glamorous goes. Some 19,000
revelers attend. For more information visit the official Mardi Gras Web site (www.
mardigras.org.au).

 Bars of note include Civic, at the corner of Pitt and Goulburn
streets, Sydney (% 02/8267 3181; Open: Sun–Thurs 10 a.m.–
11 p.m., Fri 10 a.m.–2 a.m., Sat 10 a.m.–3 a.m.), an original Art Deco
hotel that’s been spruced up to accommodate three levels of enter-
tainment; the Columbian Hotel, 117–123 Oxford St., Darlinghurst
(% 02/9360 2152; Open: Daily until at least 4 a.m.), an enormous
heritage building with a music video bar topped by a nightclub.
 A good cocktail bar is Gilligan’s, in the Oxford Hotel, 134 Oxford
St., Darlinghurst, corner of Taylor Square (% 02/9331 3467; Open:
Wed–Sun 6 p.m. to midnight).
The bar scene
Most of Australia’s drinking holes are known as hotels, after the tradition
of providing room and board along with a good drink in the old days.
Occasionally, you may hear them referred to as pubs. The term bar tends
to apply in upscale hotels and trendy establishments. Bars close at vari-
ous times, generally from midnight to around 3 a.m. Unless the listing
says otherwise, these bars do not charge a cover:
 An institution is the Bondi Hotel, 178 Campbell Parade, Bondi
Beach (% 02/9130 3271), which is across the road from Bondi
Beach. Another waterside wonder is the Watson’s Bay Hotel, 1
Military Rd., Watsons Bay (% 02/9337 4299), a casual place with 
a glorious beer garden overlooking the harbor.
 If you want to see Sydney at its sexiest and most sophisticated,
then head to The Establishment, 252 George St., Wynyard (% 02/
9240 3040), a four-level venue where style is everything. For a bit
of fun head to The Friend in Hand, 58 Cowper St., Glebe (% 02/
9660 2326), which hosts a Crab Racing Party every Wednesday at
around 8 p.m.
 Historic bars include the Lord Nelson Hotel, Kent and Argyle
streets, The Rocks (% 02/9251 4044), one of the oldest pubs in
Sydney. The drinks are sold English-style, in pints and half pints,
and the landlord makes his own prizewinning beers. Of those,
Three Sheets is the most popular. You can get decent pub grub
here.
 The Marble Bar, in the Sydney Hilton, 259 Pitt St. (% 02/9266 2000),
is the only grand-cafe-style drinking hole in Australia. With oil paint-
ings, marble columns, and brass everywhere, the Marble Bar is the
picture of 15th-century Italian Renaissance architecture — despite
being crafted in 1893.

anywhere else, it’s good to keep your wits
about you and your wallet hidden. If you

Be wary in Kings Cross and Redfern at all
hours and around Central Station and the
cinema strip on George Street near Town
Part III: Sydney, Melbourne, and the ACT 
172

Hall station in the evening — the latter is a
hangout for local gangs. Other places of
concern are the back lanes of Darlinghurst,
around the naval base at Woolloomooloo,

riages next to the guard’s van, marked with

The Best of New 
South Wales
by Marc Llewellyn
In This Chapter
 Discovering the Blue Mountains
 Exploring the Hunter Valley wine country
 Going underground in the New South Wales Outback
I
f you want to get away from Sydney for a couple of days, we’re giving
you three different destinations that provide quite a contrast from the
big city: mountains, valley, and the Outback.
First we show you the Blue Mountains, part of the Great Dividing Range
that separates the lush eastern coastal strip from the more arid interior.
This is a World Heritage–listed area, so you can expect spectacular
views, eucalyptus trees, dripping ferns, deep valleys, and craggy cliffs.
Then, we show you what’s on offer for wine lovers in the Hunter Valley,
and then on to the classic Outback town of Broken Hill.
The Blue Mountains
The Blue Mountains derive their name from the ever-present blue haze
that is caused by light striking the droplets of eucalyptus oil that evapo-
rate from the leaves of the dense surrounding forest. The area offers
breathtaking views, rugged tablelands, sheer cliffs, deep, inaccessible
valleys, enormous chasms, colorful parrots, cascading waterfalls, his-
toric villages, and stupendous walking trails.
The whole area is known for its spectacular scenery, particularly the
cliff-top views into the valleys of gum trees and across to craggy out-
crops that tower from the valley floor. It’s colder up here than down on
the plains, and clouds can sweep in and fill the canyons with mist in min-
utes, while waterfalls cascade down sheer drops, spraying the dripping
fern trees that cling to the gullies.

The Blue Mountains
Chapter 12: The Best of New South Wales 175
The Blue Mountains are one of Australia’s best-known adventure play-
grounds. Rock climbing, caving, abseiling (rappelling), bushwalking,
biking, horseback riding, and canoeing are available here year-round.
Katoomba (pop. 11,200) is the largest town in the Blue Mountains and
the focal point of the Blue Mountains National Park. It’s about 114km 
(71 miles) west of Sydney.
Getting to Katoomba
By car
From Sydney, travel along Parramatta Road and turn off onto the M4
motorway. You reach Katoomba in about two hours. Another route is via
the Harbour Bridge to North Sydney, along the Warringah Freeway (fol-
lowing signs to the M2). Take the M2 to the end and follow signs to the
M4 and the Blue Mountains. This takes around one-and-a-half hours.

By rail
Trains leave almost hourly from Central Station; contact CityRail (% 13
15 00) or Countrylink (% 13 22 32; www.countrylink.info) for details.
The train trip takes two hours, stopping at Katoomba, and then at Mount
Victoria and Lithgow. An adult same-day round-trip ticket costs around
A$15 (US$12/£6) off-peak, A$22 (US$18/£9) during commuter hours. A
child’s ticket costs A$3 (US$2.40/£1.20).
Guided tours from Sydney
Many private bus operators offer day trips from Sydney. Some offer a
guided coach tour during which you just stretch your legs, while others
let you get your circulation going with a couple of longish bushwalks.
 One highly recommended operator is Oz Trek Adventure Tours
(% 1300/661 234 in Australia, or 02/9666 4262; www.oztrek.com.
au). Its trips include tours of all the major Blue Mountain sites, and
a one-and-a-half-hour bushwalk. It costs A$55 (US$44/£22) adults,
A$44 (US$35/£18) kids. You can add overnight packages, horseback
riding, and abseiling.
 Sydney Tours-R-Us (% 02/9498 4084; www.sydneytoursrus.com)
runs minicoaches to the Blue Mountains, stopping at the Telstra
Stadium (where the Sydney Olympics were held) and Featherdale
Wildlife Park. You see all the major sights in the mountains and
come home via ferry from Parramatta to Circular Quay. The trip
costs A$93 (US$74/£37) adults, A$65 (US$52/£26) kids. It’s a ten-
hour day.
 Wonderbus (% 1300/556 357 in Australia, or 02/9630 0529; www.
wonderbus.com.au) offers an exceptional tour to the Blue Moun-
tains for A$87 (US$70/£35) adults, A$65 (US$52/£26) kids, including
all entry fees and lunch. You also come back by ferry.
Finding information on the Blue Mountains
You can pick up maps, walking guides, and other information and book
accommodations at Blue Mountains Tourism, Echo Point Road,
Katoomba, NSW 2780 (% 1300/653 408 in Australia, or 02/4739 6266).
The information center is an attraction itself, with glass windows over-
looking a gum forest, and cockatoos and lorikeets feeding on seed dis-
pensers. It’s open daily from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.
The National Park Shop, Heritage Centre, end of Govetts Leap Road,
Blackheath (% 02/4787 8877; www.npws.nsw.gov.au) is run by the
National Parks and Wildlife Service and offers detailed information about
the Blue Mountains National Park. The staff can also arrange personal-
ized guided tours of the mountains. It’s open daily from 9 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.
Check the great Web site www.bluemts.com.au for more information on
the area, including bushwalks.
Part III: Sydney, Melbourne, and the ACT 
176

Getting around the Blue Mountains
The best way to get around the Blue Mountains without your own 
transport is the Blue Mountains Explorer Bus (% 02/4782 4807; www.
explorerbus.com.au). The double-decker bus leaves from outside
Katoomba train station every hour from 9:30 a.m. until 4:30 p.m. and
stops at 27 attractions, resorts, galleries, and tearooms in and around
Katoomba and Leura. You can get on and off as often as you want.
Tickets cost A$32 (US$26/£13) adults, A$16 (US$13/£6.50) children, A$75
(US$60/£30) families; prices include discounts on the Scenic Railway and
the Skyway, as well as at some other attractions and restaurants.

Orienting yourself in the Blue Mountains
Leading out of Sydney, the Great Western Highway runs toward the blue
smudges of hills in the distance. Then, suddenly, the road starts to climb.
A string of small towns then pop up from behind a growing number of
European trees. The first place of any note is Wentworth Falls, which is
soon followed by Leura, Katoomba, Medlow Bath, Blackheath, Mount
Victoria, and Hartley. On the western fringes of the mountains is the
small settlement of Lithgow.
Chapter 12: The Best of New South Wales 177

Introducing the neighbourhoods
We concentrate on the main places of interest here, with more informa-
tion on Katoomba.
Blackheath
Blackheath is the highest town in the Blue Mountains at 1,049m (3,441
ft.). The Three Brothers at Blackheath are not as big or as famous as the
Three Sisters in Katoomba, but you can climb two of them for fabulous
views. Or you could try the Cliff Walk from Evans Lookout to Govetts
Leap (named after a surveyor who mapped the region in the 1830s),
where there are magnificent views over the Grose Valley and Bridal Veil
Falls. The one-and-a-half-hour tramp passes through banksia, gum, and
wattle forests, with spectacular views of peaks and valleys. Blackheath
has some interesting tearooms and antiques shops.
Katoomba
You’ll find several of the area’s better hotels in Katoomba and some of
the nicest scenic attractions, too. Katoomba itself has an interesting
main street, with plenty of eateries and cafes and a couple of good
antiques shops. Expect an interesting mix of hippies, dropouts, the eco-
nomically challenged, tourists, and city escapees.
Jenolan Caves
Located 70km (43 miles) southwest of Katoomba are a series of lime-
stone caves. Known to the local Aborigines as Binoomea, meaning “dark
place,” the caves are an impressive amalgamation of stalactites, stalag-
mites, and underground rivers and pools. You can tour them.
Leura
Leura is known for its gardens, attractive old buildings (many holiday
homes for Sydneysiders), and cafes and restaurants. Just outside Leura
is the Sublime Point Lookout, which has spectacular views of the Three
Sisters in Katoomba. From the southern end of Leura Mall, a cliff drive
takes you all the way back to Echo Point in Katoomba; along the way,
you’ll enjoy spectacular views across the Jamison Valley.
Wentworth Falls
This pretty town has numerous crafts and antiques shops, but the area
is best known for its 281m (922-ft.) waterfall, in Falls Reserve. On the far
side of the falls is the National Pass Walk — one of the best in the Blue
Mountains. It’s cut into a cliff face with overhanging rock faces on one
side and sheer drops on the other. The views over the Jamison Valley are
spectacular. The track takes you down to the base of the falls to the
Valley of the Waters.

Staying in style
If you have the option, don’t stay over in the Blue Mountains on a Friday
or Saturday night, when prices go up significantly. Many hotels also have
a minimum two-night stay requirement over the weekend. Parking is free
at all hotels.
The Carrington Hotel
$$
Katoomba
Construction started on this grand Victorian hotel in 1880. The Carrington
is a must-stay if you’re into buildings of the British Raj style. Downstairs
are a restaurant and breakfast room (once a ballroom), a couple of lounges
with antiques, and a wood-paneled billiard room. All the rooms are delight-
ful, with royal gold and blue carpets and drapes that would probably be
gaudy if they didn’t fit in with the overall style. Traditional rooms share
bathrooms; colonial rooms come with a deep tub in the bathroom (with a
noisy fan) and no view; deluxe colonial rooms have a balcony and moun-
tain views; premier rooms have Jacuzzis and great views; the suites are fit
for a duke and duchess. Dinner is A$100 (US$80/£40) per person, and
breakfast is one of the best we’ve had.

Echoes Hotel & Restaurant, Blue Mountains
$$$$
Katoomba
Lilianfels (see later in this section) may be more expensive, but Echoes,
across the road on a cliff overlooking the Jamison Valley, has superior
views. Large windows, balconies, and a sizeable deck allow guests to soak
up the fantastic scenery. Rooms are simply furnished; all have underfloor
heating and are recommended if you’re cashed up.

Jenolan Caves House
$$
Jenolan
This heritage-listed hotel built between 1888 and 1906 is one of the 
most outstanding structures in the state. The main part of the three-story
Chapter 12: The Best of New South Wales 179

building is made of sandstone and fashioned in Tudor-style black and
white. Around it are cottages and former servants’ quarters. Accom-
modations in the main house vary, from “traditional” rooms with shared
bathrooms to “classic” rooms with private bathrooms. The rooms are old-
world and cozy, with views over red-tile rooftops or steep slopes. Classic
rooms have views of Jenolan Caves Valley and gardens; “grand classic”
rooms have spectacular views across the hills and countryside. “Mountain
lodge” rooms, in a building behind the main house, are more motel-like.

Lilianfels Blue Mountains
$$$$$
Katoomba
Just across a road from Echo Point, this Victorian country-house hotel —
a member of the Small Luxury Hotels of the World — is a full-service yet
cozy establishment. Rooms are spacious, expensive, and furnished with
antiques. Most have king-size beds. Those with views are more expensive.
The living areas are just as grand, with log fires and more antiques. Views
are impressive, especially from the lounge, which overlooks the Jamison
Valley. On the grounds is an 1889 cottage. Meant for two, it has a sitting
room, a bedroom with a four-poster bed, a Jacuzzi, an intimate fireplace,
and its own gardens. Among the other offerings at Lilianfels are a billiards
room, a library and reading room, a small pool, and a health club. The
restaurant Darley’s serves great Contemporary food.

Mercure Grand Hydro Majestic Hotel
$$$
Medlow Bath
The most famous hotel in the Blue Mountains was built in 1904 by Mark
Foy, a retail baron, world traveler, and hypochondriac. The long, white-
washed building, with great bushland views, is reminiscent of the grand
hotels of Queen Victoria’s time. The property even has a croquet lawn and
English lawn bowls. The standard Heritage rooms are furnished in Art
Deco style and have views of the garden. The Gallery rooms have better
views, some with valley glimpses. Cloister rooms, mostly in another wing,
are decorated in both Art Deco and Edwardian and have valley views.
Some of these have Jacuzzis. Rooms in the Delmonte Wing, decorated in
French Provincial style, also have views. The suites are sumptuous. Higher

Dining out
Katoomba Street has many ethnic dining choices, whether you’re
hungry for Greek, Chinese, or Thai. Restaurants in the Blue Mountains
are generally more expensive than equivalent places in Sydney. In addi-
tion to the restaurants we list in this section, try The Elephant Bean,
159 Katoomba Rd. (% 02/4782 4620), for hearty soups, burgers, muffins,
and good coffee. You may want to eat breakfast, or “brekkie,” at a cafe
rather than in your hotel. The Stockmarket Café, 179 The Mall, Leura
(% 02/4784 3121), is small and casual with good coffee ordered at the
counter, and great soups, pies, and stews at lunchtime. The Fresh
Espresso and Food Bar, 181 Katoomba St., Katoomba (% 02/4782
3602), does good eggs and porridge with fresh ricotta, strawberries,
honey, and cinnamon.
Chork Dee Thai Restaurant
$$
Katoomba
THAI
Loved by the locals, Chork Dee offers good Thai food in a pleasant but
modest setting. It serves Thai fare, including satay, spring rolls, and fish
cakes to start, followed by lots of curries, noodles, and sweet-and-sour
dishes. Although vegetarians won’t find any starters without meat or fish,
plenty of veggie and tofu dishes are available as main courses. It’s BYO.

Conservation Hut Café
$$
Wentworth Falls
CAFE
This pleasant cafe is in the national park on top of a cliff overlooking the
Jamison Valley. It’s a good place for lunch on the balcony after the Valley
of the Waters walk, which leaves from outside. It serves good cafe fare —
burgers, salads, and sandwiches, with vegetarian options. Breakfast is
served as well. There’s a nice log fire inside in winter.
At the end of Fletcher Street, Wentworth Falls. % 02/4757 3827. Main courses: A$17–

Lindsay’s
$$$
Katoomba
MODERN AUSTRALIAN
Swiss chef Beat Ettlin has been making waves in Katoomba ever since he
left some of the best European restaurants behind to try his hand at dishes
such as pan-fried crocodile nibbles on pumpkin scones with ginger dip-
ping sauce. The food is as glorious as its décor — Tiffany lamps, sketches
by Australian artist Norman Lindsay, and booths lining the walls. The
three-level restaurant is warmed by a cozy fire surrounded by an antique
lounge stage and resounds every night to piano, classical music, or a jazz
band. The menu is seasonal and changes every few weeks.
122 Katoomba St., Katoomba. % 02/4782 2753. Reservations recommended. Main
courses: A$14–A$24 (US$11–US$19/£5.50–£9.50). AE, MC, V. Open: Wed–Sun 6 p.m.
to midnight.
Paragon Café
$
Katoomba
CAFE
The Paragon has been a Blue Mountains institution since it opened in 1916.
Inside, it’s decked out with dark-wood paneling, bas-relief figures guard-
ing the booths, and chandeliers. The homemade soups are delicious. The
cafe also serves pies, pastas, seafood, waffles, and a Devonshire tea.
65 Katoomba St., Katoomba. % 02/4782 2928. Main courses: A$3–A$10 (US$2.40–

TrisElies
$$$
Katoomba
GREEK
Perhaps it’s the belly dancers, the plate-smashing, or the smell of mous-
saka, but as soon as you walk into this lively eatery you feel as if you’ve
been transported to an Athenian taverna. The restaurant folds out onto
three tiers of tables, all with a good view of the stage where Greek or inter-
national performances take place every night. The food is solid Greek 
fare — souvlaki, traditional dips, fried halloumi cheese, Greek salads,
sausages in red wine. In winter, warm up beside one of the log fires.
287 Bathurst Rd., Katoomba. % 02/4782 4026. Fax: 02/4782 1128. www.triselies.

Exploring the Blue Mountains
The top attractions
The reason you come to the Blue Mountains is for the views and the
walks. There are so many walks of various lengths and challenges that
you need to stop off at the Tourist Information Office for local advice.
Part III: Sydney, Melbourne, and the ACT 
182

Jenolan Caves
There are nine caves open for exploration. The first tour starts at 10 a.m.
weekdays and 9:30 a.m. weekends and holidays. The final tour departs at
4:30 p.m. (5 p.m. in warmer months). Tours last one to two hours. The best
all-around cave is Lucas Cave; Imperial Cave is best for seniors. Adventure
Cave Tours, which include canyoning, last three hours to a full day. Guided
tours are also offered by the Jenolan Caves Reserves Trust (% 02/6359
3311; www.jenolancaves.org.au). The fees are A$16 to A$23 (US$13–
US$18/£7.50–£9) adults, A$10 to A$15 (US$8–US$12/£4–£6) children under
15. Family rates and multiple cave packages are available.
The Three Sisters
These craggy red rock formations are the most photographed attractions
in the Blue Mountains. The Aboriginal Dreamtime legend has it that three
sisters — Meehni, Wimlah, and Gunnedoo — lived in the Jamison Valley
as members of the Katoomba tribe. These beautiful young ladies had fallen
in love with three brothers from the Nepean tribe, yet tribal law forbade
them to marry. The brothers decided to use force to capture the three sis-
ters, which caused a major tribal battle. Because the lives of the three sis-
ters were seriously in danger, a witch doctor from the Katoomba tribe took
it upon himself to turn the three sisters into stone to protect them.
Although he had intended to reverse the spell when the battle was over,
the witch doctor himself was killed. Because only he could reverse the
spell to return the ladies to their former beauty, the sisters remain in their
magnificent rock formation as a reminder of this battle. For the best van-
tage point, head to Echo Point Road, across from the Blue Mountains
Tourism office. Or try Evans Lookout, Govetts Leap, and Hargreaves
Lookout, all at Blackheath.
Scenic World
One thing you have to do in the Blue Mountains is ride Katoomba’s Scenic
Railway, the world’s steepest. It consists of a carriage on rails lowered
415m (1,361 ft.) into the Jamison Valley at a maximum incline of 52 degrees.
It’s very steep and quite a thrill. Originally the rail line was used to trans-
port coal from the mines below in the 1880s. The trip takes only a few min-
utes; at the bottom are some excellent walks through forests of ancient
tree ferns. Another popular attraction is the Skyway, a cable car that 
travels 300m (984 ft.) above the Valley. The round-trip takes six minutes.
Ticket office: 1 Violet St., Katoomba (follow the signs). % 02/4782 2699. Admission:
For both the Scenic Railway and the Skyway A$16 (US$13/£6.50) round-trip adults,
A$8 (US$6.40/£3.20) round-trip children, A$40 (US$32/£16) round-trip families. Open:
Daily 9 a.m.–5 p.m. (last trip at 4:50 p.m.).
More cool things to see and do
If you have some time to spend in the Blue Mountains, you could include
the following things to do:
Chapter 12: The Best of New South Wales 183

 There are 50 walking trails, ranging from routes you can cover in
15 minutes to the three-day Six Foot Track that starts outside
Katoomba and finishes at Jenolan Caves. The staff at the tourist
offices and national park office will be happy to point you in the
right direction, whether for an hour’s stroll or a day’s hike.
 One of the best adventure operators in the area, High ’n’ Wild, 3–5
Katoomba St., Katoomba, NSW 2780 (% 02/4782 6224; www.high-
n-wild.com.au), offers a series of canyoning expeditions, taking in
scenic rain forest gullies and caverns made up of dramatic rock for-
mations and fern-lined walls. There’s a bit of swimming and plenty
of walking, wading, and squeezing through tight spaces.
 Other excellent adventure operators are the Blue Mountains
Adventure Company, 84a Bathurst Rd. (P.O. Box 242), Katoomba,
NSW 2780 (% 02/4782 1271; www.bmac.com.au), above the
Summit Gear Shop; and the Australian School of Mountaineering,
166 Katoomba St., Katoomba, NSW 2780 (% 02/4782 2014). Both
offer rock climbing, rappelling, and canyoning trips. The Adventure
Company offers caving and biking, and the School of Mountain-
eering offers bushcraft and survival training.
The Hunter Valley: Wining and Dining
The Hunter Valley is the oldest commercial wine-producing area in
Australia. Internationally acclaimed wines have poured out of the Hunter
since the early 1800s. People come here to visit the vineyards’ “cellar
doors” for wine tastings, to enjoy the scenery, to sample the area’s
highly regarded cuisine, or to escape from the city.
In the Lower Hunter, centered on the towns of Cessnock and Pokolbin,
are around 110 wineries and cellar doors, including well-known pro-
ducers such as Tyrell, Rothbury, Lindemans, Draytons, McGuigans, 
and McWilliams. Many varieties of wine are produced here, including
sémillon, Shiraz, chardonnay, cabernet sauvignon, and pinot noir.
The Upper Hunter represents the essence of Australian rural life, with
its sheep and cattle farms, historic homesteads, more wineries, and
bushland. The vineyards tend to be larger than those in the south, and
produce more aromatic varieties, such as traminers and Rieslings.
February through March is harvest time.
Getting to the Hunter Valley
By car
Leave Sydney by the Harbour Bridge or Harbour Tunnel and follow the
signs for Newcastle. Just before Hornsby, turn off the highway and head
up the National 1/F3 freeway. After around an hour, take the Cessnock
exit and follow signs to the vineyards. The trip will take about two-and-
a-half hours.

Finding information after you arrive
Wine Country Visitors Information Centre, Main Road, Pokolbin, NSW
2325 (% 02/4990 4477; fax 02/4991 4518; www.winecountry.com.au), is
open Monday through Friday 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., Saturday 9:30 a.m. to 
5 p.m., and Sunday 9:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m.

Visiting the wineries
Most of the wineries in the region are open for tastings, and it’s accept-
able to turn up, taste a couple of wines or more, and then say your good-
byes without buying.
Many people start their journey through the Hunter by popping into the
Hunter Valley Wine Society, 455 Wine Country Dr., Pokolbin (% 1300/
303 307 in Australia, or 02/4941 3000). The club acts as a Hunter Valley
wine clearinghouse, sending bottles and cases to members all over
Australia, and some overseas. It’s a good place to talk to experts about
the area’s wines, and taste a few. It’s open daily 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.
You may also like to visit the Small Winemakers Centre, 426 McDonalds
Rd., Pokolbin (% 02/4998 7668). At any one time it represents six or so
of the region’s smaller producers.
Australia’s drunk-driving laws are strict and rigidly enforced. Both easily
identifiable and unmarked police cars patrol the vineyard regions. If
you’re interested in tasting some grapes in the Hunter Valley, choose a
designated driver or take a guided tour.
Here are just a few of the popular wineries you can visit:
 Lindemans Hunter River Winery, McDonald Road, Pokolbin 
(% 02/4998 7684): Open Monday through Friday from 9 a.m. 
to 4:30 p.m., Saturday and Sunday from 10 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.,

Pokolbin (% 02/4998 7402): Open daily from 9:30 a.m. to 5 p.m.,

and bakery on-site.

 Tamburlaine Winery, 358 McDonald Rd., Pokolbin (% 02/4998
7570): Open daily from 9:30 a.m. to 5 p.m., Tamburlaine is a nice

 Tinklers, Pokolbin Mountains Road, Pokolbin (% 02/4998 7435):
Open daily from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m., Tinklers sells some 30 different
varieties of grapes between December and March, and nectarines,
plums, peaches, and vegetables at other times. It also offers wine
tasting and free vineyard walks at 11 a.m. Saturday and Sunday.
Fun ways to see the wineries
If you don’t have a car, you’ll have to get around as part of a tour,
because no public transport runs between the wineries.

lunch in a restaurant. Grapemobile also rents bicycles — A$22
(US$18/£9) half-day, A$30 (US$24/£12) full day.
The top hotels
The Hunter Valley is far more expensive on weekends and holidays than
on weekdays. Room prices jump significantly, and some properties insist
on a two-night stay. It’s worth checking out the information board in the
Wine Country Visitors Information Centre for special deals, including
self-contained accommodations, cottages, resorts, and guesthouses.

Barrington Guest House

Barrington Tops
Barrington Guest House is in a valley just outside the Barrington Tops
National Park, 90 minutes from the main Hunter wine region. It retains an
old-world charm and serves bacon and eggs for breakfast, scones and
cream, and vegetables boiled soft enough for your dentures. The place has
lace tablecloths in the dining room, a log fire beneath a higgledy-piggledy
brick chimney, mahogany walls, high ceilings, and personalized service —
despite the communal mealtimes and the lack of a menu. Rooms come
with or without private bathroom; they’re basic (no TV) but comfortable
enough. The guesthouse grounds attract plenty of animals and act as a
wildlife reserve for several rescued kangaroos. Activities include horse-
back riding, guided walks through the rain forest, “billy tea” tours, night
spotting for quolls (native cats) and possums, bush dancing, tennis, film
evenings, and skeet shooting. Several luxury rain forest cottages are also
available. They sleep up to five people.

Tucked away on 15 hectares (37 acres) and off the main road, Carriages is
a secluded retreat. A two-suite cottage is on a separate part of the grounds.
In the main two-story house, a veranda circles downstairs rooms, which
are furnished in antique country pine. Upstairs, the two lofty gable suites
center on huge fireplaces. The Gatehouse suites offer incredible luxury; the
stained-glass windows and rescued timber give them a rustic feel (these
two Jacuzzi rooms share a lounge with a full kitchen and an open fire).
There are open fires in six of the rooms. (The two standard doubles don’t
have them.) Breakfast is served in your room, and Robert’s Restaurant is

Originally a convent in the early part of the 20th century, this building was
transported some 600km (372 miles) from Coonamble in central New
South Wales to its present location in 1990. Rooms are elegant and spa-
cious, with baroque décor, including plaster frieze ceilings and thick, rich
drapes. French doors open onto private verandas overlooking patches of
bushland. King rooms are larger and have wicker lounge areas. There is
an elegant sitting area where drinks are served, and a light and airy break-
fast room serving the best breakfasts in the Hunter. The complex includes

Pokolbin
This tranquil escape is set in beautiful bush gardens. The spot is so peace-
ful that kangaroos hop up to the veranda looking for treats. The “classic”
rooms downstairs have French doors that you can fling open; upstairs
rooms have a tad more old-fashioned charm and come with air-conditioning.
All rooms have king-size beds and are furnished with colonial antiques.
Guests don’t come here for action; they come to relax. The Pampering Place
offers massages and facials, and a gentle 30-minute trail winds through the

Outback New South Wales: Broken Hill
The Outback is a powerful Australian image. Hot, dusty, and prone to
flies, it can also be a place where wedge-tailed eagles float in the shim-
mering heat as you spin in a circle, tracing the unbroken horizon. If you
drive out here, you have to be constantly on the lookout for emus, large
flightless birds that dart across roads open-beaked and wide-eyed.
Broken Hill (1,157km/717 miles west of Sydney) — or “Silver City,” as
it’s been nicknamed — is still a hard working, hard-drinking mining
town. Its beginnings date to 1883, when a rider named Charles Rasp
Part III: Sydney, Melbourne, and the ACT 
190

noticed something odd about the craggy rock outcrops at a place called
the Broken Hill. He thought he saw deposits of tin, but they turned out
to be silver and lead. Today, the city’s main drag, Argent Street, bristles
with colonial mansions, heritage homes, and public buildings.
Getting to Broken Hill
By car
Take the Great Western Highway from Sydney to Dubbo, then the
Mitchell Highway to the Barrier Highway, to Broken Hill.
By train
The Indian Pacific stops here on its way from Sydney to Perth twice a
week. It takes nearly 16 hours, leaving Sydney at 2:55 p.m. on Saturday
and Wednesday and arriving in Broken Hill at 6:40 a.m. the next day. The
fare from Sydney is A$564 (US$451/£226) adults and A$473 (US$378/
£180) children in a first-class sleeper, A$375 (US$300/£150) adults and
A$283 (US$226/£113) children in an economy sleeper, and A$225 (US$180/
£90) adults and A$120 (US$96/£48) children in an economy seat. Contact
Great Southern Railways (% 08/8213 4530; www.gsr.com.au).
By bus
Greyhound Australia (% 13 14 99 in Australia, or 07/4690 9950; www.
greyhound.com.au) runs buses from Adelaide for around A$60 (US$48/
£24); the trip takes seven hours. The 16-hour trip from Sydney costs
from A$96 (US$77/£38).
Getting information after you arrive
You can find the Broken Hill Visitors Information Centre at the corner
of Blende and Bromide streets (% 08/8087 6077; www.visitbroken
hill.com.au). It’s open daily from 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m.
The area code in Broken Hill is 08, the same as the South Australia code,
not 02, the New South Wales code.
Getting around Broken Hill
Free, volunteer-led tours lead off from the Visitor’s Centre at 10 a.m. on
Monday, Wednesday, and Friday from March to October.
Silver City Tours, 380 Argent St. (% 08/8087 3144), conducts tours of
the city and Outback. City tours take around four hours and cost A$45
(US$36/£18) adults, A$20 (US$16/£8) children. The company also offers a
range of other tours of the area.
Another good operator is Tri State Safaris (% 08/8088 2389; www.
tristate.com.au), which runs multiday tours into the Outback.
Chapter 12: The Best of New South Wales 191

Cool things to see and do
Broken Hill has more places per capita to see art than anywhere else 
in Australia. The Broken Hill Regional Art Gallery, Chloride Street,
between Blende and Beryl streets (% 08/8088 5491), houses an exten-
sive collection of Australian colonial and Impressionist works. The
gallery is open Monday through Friday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., and
Saturday and Sunday from 1 to 5 p.m. Admission is A$3 (US$2.40/£1.20)
adults, A$2 (US$1.60/£0.80) children, A$6 (US$4.80/£2.40) families.
Other galleries worth visiting include Absalom’s Gallery, 638 Chapple
St. (% 08/8087 5881), and the Pro Hart Gallery, 108 Wyman St. (% 08/
8087 2441). Both are open daily. In Pro Hart’s gallery, you’ll find his own
works: pieces based on incidents and scenes of Broken Hill as well as
everything from a bas-relief of Salvador Dalí to a landscape by Claude
Monet.
Join the Bush Mail Run (% 08/8087 2164, or 0411/102 339 mobile), 
an Outback mail delivery service that operates every Wednesday and
Saturday. The day starts at 7 a.m. and you cover roughly 500km (310
miles). You stop at various homesteads. The run costs A$120 (US$96/
£48).
Around Broken Hill
At least 44 movies have been filmed in the Wild West town of Silverton
(pop. 50), 23km (14 miles) northwest of Broken Hill. It’s the Wild West
Australian-style, though, with camels instead of horses sometimes
placed in front of the Silverton Pub, worth a visit for its kitschy appeal.
Silverton once had a population of 3,000, following the discovery of
silver in 1882, but within seven years almost everyone had left. There
are some good galleries here, as well as a restored jail and hotel.
 Mutawintji National Park: Also known by its old name, Mootwin-
gee (130km/81 miles northeast of Broken Hill), this place was one of
the most important spiritual meeting places for Aborigines. The
ancient, weathered fireplaces are still here, laid out like a giant map
to show where each group came from. Hundreds of ocher outlines
of hands and animal paws, some up to 30,000 years old, are sten-
ciled on rock overhangs. The two-hour Outback trip from Broken
Hill to Mootwingee is along red-dirt tracks not suitable for two-
wheel-drives. It should not be attempted after a heavy rain.
 Mootwingee Heritage Tours (% 08/8088 7000) leads inspections
of the historical sites every Wednesday and Saturday at 10:30 a.m.
Broken Hill time (11 a.m. Mootwingee time). The tours may be can-
celed in very hot weather. The NPWS office in Broken Hill (% 08/
8088 5933) also has details.

(10 ft.) high and carved totemlike by artists from as far away as
Georgia, Syria, Mexico, and the Tiwi Islands, make up the Sculpture
Symposium. Surrounding them on all sides is mulga scrub. It’s fan-
tastic at sunset.
Staying in Broken Hill
One option is to rent a local cottage from Broken Hill Historic Cottages
(% 08/8087 9966) for A$80 (US$64/£32) a night.
Mario the Palace Hotel

Broken Hill
With its high painted walls, a mural of Botticelli’s Birth of Venus on the ceil-
ing two flights up, and an office crammed with stuffed animal heads and
crabs, the Palace Hotel is an intriguing sanctuary. The owners have put a
lot of work into restoring the place. The more expensive doubles are larger
and come with a small lounge area, but all are comfortable and cool. Ten
double rooms come with an attached shower. The Priscilla Suite is famous
because that’s where the transvestites stayed in The Adventures of Priscilla,
Queen of the Desert.

White Cliffs
We love this place; it’s worth making the trip out to White Cliffs to stay
here. All but two of the rooms are underground; they’re reached by a maze
of tunnels dug out of the rock and sealed with epoxy resin. The tempera-
ture below ground is a constant 72°F (22°C), which is decidedly cooler
than a summer day outside. Rooms are comfortable though basic, with
shared toilets and showers. Turn off the light, and it’s dark as a cave. Every
night guests sit around large tables and dig into the roast of the day.

Dining locally
The best place for a meal Aussie-style is a local club. You’ll find one of
the best bistros at the Barrier Social & Democratic Club, 218 Argent St.
(% 08/8088 4477). It serves breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Another good
one is at the Southern Cross Hotel, 357 Cobalt St. (% 08/8088 4122).
Interestingly, the fresh fish is a standout. Locals go for steaks at the
Sturt Club, 321 Blende St. (% 02/8087 4541).

attling trams, twisting cobblestone laneways hiding trendy 
bars and restaurants, stately European architecture, parklands, 
galleries galore, and a diverse population that’s passionate about their
hometown — you’ll find all this and more in Australia’s largest city.
Victoria’s capital, Melbourne (pronounced mel-bun) is a cultural 
melting pot.
Melbourne is at the head of the pack in Australia when it comes to shop-
ping, restaurants, fashion, music, nightlife, and cafe culture.
Melbourne was founded in the 1850s, when gold was found in the sur-
rounding hills. British settlers prided themselves on coming freely to the
city, rather than in chains. The city grew wealthy and remained a conser-
vative bastion until World War II, when another wave of immigration,
from southern Europe, made it a more relaxed place.
Getting There
By plane
Qantas (% 13 13 13 in Australia; www.qantas.com.au) and Virgin Blue
(% 13 67 89 in Australia; www.virginblue.com.au) both fly to Mel-
bourne from all state capitals. Qantas’s discount arm, Jetstar (% 13 15 38
in Australia, or 03/8341 4901; www.jetstar.com.au) flies to and from
Darwin, Townsville, Hamilton Island, the Sunshine Coast and Gold Coast,
and Hobart. Jetstar also flies between Avalon Airport, about a 50-minute
drive outside Melbourne’s city center, and Sydney, Brisbane, Perth, and
Adelaide. With a rapidly expanding network more flights are likely to
have been added by the time you arrive.

Melbourne Airport’s international and domestic terminals (www.
melair.com.au) are all under one roof at Tullamarine, 22km (14 miles)
northwest of the city center (often referred to as Tullamarine Airport). A
travelers’ information desk is on the ground floor of the international
terminal and is open from 6 a.m. until the last flight. The international
terminal has snack bars, a restaurant, currency-exchange facilities, and
duty-free shops. ATMs are available at both terminals. Showers are on
the first floor of the international area. Baggage carts are free in the
international baggage claim hall but cost A$3 (US$2.40/£1.20) in the
parking lot, departure lounge, or domestic terminal. Baggage storage is
available in the international terminal and costs from A$10 to A$20
(US$8–US$16/£4–£8) per day, depending on size. The storage desk is
open from 5 a.m. to 12:30 a.m. daily, and you need photo ID. The Hilton
Melbourne Airport (% 03/8336 2000) and Holiday Inn Melbourne
Airport (% 1300/724 944 in Australia) are both within a five-minute
walk of the terminals.
Getting from the airport to your hotel
The Tullamarine freeway from the airport joins with the CityLink, a toll
road. Drivers need a CityLink pass. A 24-hour pass costs A$11 (US$8.80/
£4.40). Check with your car rental company.
The red Skybus (% 03/9335 2811; www.skybus.com.au) runs between
the airport and Melbourne’s Southern Cross Station in Spencer Street
every 10 to 15 minutes throughout the day and every 30 to 60 minutes
overnight 24 hours a day, daily. Buy tickets from Skybus desks outside
the baggage claim areas or at the Travellers Information Desk in the
international terminal. A free Skybus hotel shuttle will pick you up at
your hotel to connect with the airport-bound bus at Southern Cross, 
but you must book this. It operates from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. weekdays and
7:30 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. weekends. Tickets for adults cost A$15 (US$12/£6)
one-way, A$24 (US$19/£9.60) round-trip. Kids cost A$5 (US$4/£2) each
way. A family ticket for up to six people costs A$30 (US$24/£12) one-way,
A$50 (US$40/£20) round-trip. The trip takes about 20 minutes from the
airport to Southern Cross station, but allow longer for your return 
journey.

flights and runs back to the airport from 167 Franklin St. and Southern
Cross Station, and operates a transfer service to Avalon Airport for
Jetstar flights. One-way tickets from Melbourne airport cost A$21
(US$17/£8.40) adults, A$15 (US$12/£6) children 4 to 14, A$122 (US$98/
£49) families of four. Round-trip fares are double. One-way fares from

children to Southern Cross station, more to other Central Business
District (CBD) locations and other suburbs.
A taxi to the city center takes about 30 minutes and costs around A$45
(US$36/£18).

Avis, Budget, Europcar, Hertz, and Thrifty have car rental desks at the
airport.
By train
Interstate trains arrive at Southern Cross Railway Station, Spencer and
Little Collins streets (5 blocks from Swanston Street in the city center).
After a multimillion-dollar face-lift completed in 2006, the station was
renamed Southern Cross, but you’ll still hear locals refer to it as
“Spencer Street Station.” Taxis and buses connect with the city.
The Sydney-Melbourne XPT travels between Australia’s two largest
cities daily (trip time: 11 hours). The adult fare is A$75 (US$60/£30)
economy class, A$105 (US$84/£42) first class. A first-class sleeper costs
A$193 (US$154/£77). For more information, contact Countrylink 
(% 13 22 32 in Australia; www.countrylink.info).
The Overland train, overhauled in 2007, provides service between
Melbourne and Adelaide (trip time: 11 hours) three times a week. The
adult one-way fare is A$89 (US$71/£36) economy class, A$139 (US$111/
£56) first class. For more information, contact Great Southern Railways
(% 13 21 47 in Australia; www.gsr.com.au).
V/Line services also connect Melbourne with Adelaide. This trip is by
train from Melbourne to Bendigo, and by bus from Bendigo to Adelaide.
Total trip time is around 11 hours, and the fare is A$65 (US$52/£26)
adults, A$33 (US$26/£13) children. The Canberra Link connects Mel-
bourne with the nation’s capital; it’s a train journey from Melbourne to
Bairnsdale, and then a bus from there to Canberra. The journey takes
about ten hours and costs A$63 (US$50/£25) adults, A$33 (US$26/£13)
kids. For information, contact V/Line (% 13 61 96 in Australia; www.
vline.com.au).
By bus
Several bus companies connect Melbourne with other capitals and
regional areas of Victoria. Among the biggest is Greyhound Australia
(% 1300/473 946 in Australia, or 07/4690 9950; www.greyhound.com.au).
Coaches serve Melbourne’s Transit Centre, 58 Franklin St., 2 blocks
north of the Southern Cross Railway Station on Spencer Street. Trams
and taxis serve the station; V/Line buses (% 13 61 96 in Australia;
www.vline.com.au), which travel all over Victoria, depart from the
Spencer Street Bus Terminal.
By car
You can drive from Sydney to Melbourne along the Hume Highway (trip
time: nine-and-a-half hours), via Goulburn in New South Wales (good for
supplies), and Wangaratta in Victoria (where you can detour into the
Victorian Alps). Another route is along the coastal Princes Highway, for
which you need a minimum of two days, with stops. For information on

Orienting Yourself in Melbourne
Melbourne is on the Yarra River and stretches inland from Port Philip
Bay, which lies to its south. On a map, you’ll see a distinct central
oblong area surrounded by Flinders Street to the south, Latrobe Street
to the north, Spring Street to the east, and Spencer Street to the west.
Cutting north–south through its center are the two main shopping thor-
oughfares, Swanston Street and Elizabeth Street. Cross streets between
these major thoroughfares include Bourke Street Mall, a pedestrian-only
shopping promenade. If you continue south along Swanston Street and
over the river, it turns into St. Kilda Road, which runs to the coast.
Melbourne’s various urban “villages,” including South Yarra, Richmond,
Carlton, and Fitzroy, surround the city center. The seaside suburb of St.
Kilda is known for its diverse restaurants.
Introducing the Neighbourhoods
City Center
Bordered by Flinders, Latrobe, Spring, and Spencer streets, the city
center has good shopping and cafes, and in recent years an active
nightlife has sprung up with the opening of funky bars and restaurants
playing live and recorded music to suit all ages. The city center’s land-
mark is the ornate Flinders Street Station, with its dome and clock tower,
flanked by the modern Federation Square precinct.
Chinatown
Centered on Little Bourke Street, between Swanston and Exhibition
streets, this is Australia’s oldest permanent Chinese settlement, dating
from the 1850s, when boardinghouses catered to Chinese prospectors
lured by gold rushes. Plenty of cheap restaurants crowd its alleyways.
Carlton
Carlton’s fame stems from the many Italian restaurants that line Lygon
Street (although the quality of the food varies). It’s the home of the
University of Melbourne, so there’s a strong student population. From
Bourke Street Mall, it’s about a 15-minute walk to the restaurant strip.
Fitzroy
Bohemian and a funky, Fitzroy is about 2km (11⁄4 miles) north of the city
center. Students and artists hang out here, with Brunswick Street’s
cheap restaurants, busy cafes, late-night bookshops, art galleries, and
Chapter 13: Melbourne 197

pubs as the hub. Johnston Street is a growing Spanish quarter with tapas
bars, flamenco restaurants, and Spanish clubs.
Richmond
One of Melbourne’s earliest settlements, Richmond is noted for its multi-
cultural quarter, historic streets, and back lanes. Victoria Street is “little
Vietnam,” and Bridge Road is a discount-fashion precinct.
Southgate and Southbank
This flashy entertainment district on the banks of the Yarra River oppo-
site Flinders Street Station (linked by several pedestrian bridges) is
home to the Crown Casino, Australia’s largest gaming venue. Southbank
has restaurants, bars, cafes, nightclubs, cinemas, and designer shops
galore. On the city side of the river is the Melbourne Aquarium. All are a
ten-minute stroll from Flinders Street Station.
Docklands
Not far from the city center, this former industrial area has become the
biggest development in Melbourne. NewQuay, on the waterfront, has a
range of restaurants, shops, and cinemas. Next door is the 52,000-seat
Telstra Dome stadium, home to Australian-rules football.
St. Kilda
Hip, bohemian, and shabby-chic, this bayside suburb (6km/33⁄4 miles
south of the city center) has Melbourne’s highest concentration of
restaurants, ranging from glitzy to cheap, as well as some superb cake
shops and delis. The Esplanade hugs a slim beach, lined by palm trees,
with a historic pier and is the scene of a lively arts-and-crafts market on
Sundays. Acland Street is home to many restaurants and cake shops.
Check out Luna Park, one of the world’s oldest fun parks, built in 1912,
and ride the historic wooden roller coaster.
South Yarra/Prahan
This posh part of town abounds with boutiques, cinemas, nightclubs,
and galleries. Chapel Street is famous for its fashion houses, while
Commercial Road is popular with the gay and lesbian community. Off
Chapel Street in Prahan is Greville Street, an enclave of retro boutiques
and music outlets. Every Sunday from noon to 5 p.m. the Greville Street
Market offers arts, crafts, old clothes, and jewelry.
South Melbourne
One of the city’s oldest working-class districts, South Melbourne is
known for its historic buildings, pubs, hotels, and markets.
Part III: Sydney, Melbourne, and the ACT 
198

The River District
The Yarra River runs southeast past the Royal Botanic Gardens and near
other attractions such as the Victorian Arts Centre, the National Gallery
of Victoria, and the Melbourne Cricket Ground. Birrarung Marr is the
first new major parkland in Melbourne in over 100 years.
Williamstown
This outer waterfront suburb has a rich architectural heritage, which
centers on Ferguson Street and Nelson Place. On the Strand overlooking
the sea is a line of bistros and restaurants, and a World War II warship
museum. Take the ferry from Southgate or St. Kilda Pier.
Finding Information after You Arrive
The first stop on any visitor’s itinerary should be the Melbourne Visitor
Centre, Federation Square, Swanston and Flinders streets (% 03/9658
9658; www.thatsmelbourne.com.au). The center serves as a one-stop
shop for tourism information, accommodations and tour bookings,
event ticketing, public transport information, and ticket sales. Also here
are an ATM, Internet terminals, and interactive multimedia providing
information on Melbourne and Victoria. The center is open daily from 
9 a.m. to 6 p.m. (except Good Friday and Dec 25). The Melbourne
Greeter Service also operates from the Melbourne Visitor Centre. This
service is available in 15 languages and connects visitors to local volun-
teers who offer free one-on-one, half-day orientation tours of the city.
Book at least three days in advance (% 03/9658 9658) if you can. The
Melbourne Visitor Centre also operates staffed information booths in
Bourke Street Mall, between Swanston and Elizabeth streets.
 You’ll also find information services at Information Victoria, 356
Collins St. (% 1300/366 356 in Australia).
 In the central city area, also look for Melbourne’s City
Ambassadors — people, usually volunteers, who give tourist 
information and directions. They’ll be wearing bright red shirts 
and caps.
 Good Web sites about the city include CitySearch Melbourne
(http://melbourne.citysearch.com.au), as well as the official
City of Melbourne site (www.melbourne.vic.gov.au) and the offi-
cial tourism site for the city (www.visitmelbourne.com). Also
worth a look are locally run sites www.onlymelbourne.com.au
and www.thatsmelbourne.com.au.
Chapter 13: Melbourne 199

Getting Around Melbourne
By tram
Melbourne has the oldest tram network in the world. Trams are an
essential part of the city, and a cultural icon. Several hundred trams run
over 325km (202 miles) of track. Instead of phasing out this non-smoggy
method of transport, Melbourne is expanding the network.
The cheapest tram travel within the city center is with a City Saver
ticket, which costs A$2.30 (US$1.85/£0.90) adults, A$1.30 (US$1.05/£0.50)
children, for a single journey. Or you can buy a 2-Hour Metcard, good
for unlimited transport on buses or trams for up to two hours to all the
attractions and suburbs listed in this book, for A$3.20 (US$2.55/£1.30)
adults, A$1.90 (US$1.50/£0.75) children.
If you plan to pack in the sightseeing, try the Zone 1 Metcard Daily
ticket, which allows travel on all transport (trams and trains) within 
the city and close surrounding suburbs mentioned in this chapter from
5:30 a.m. to midnight (when transportation stops). It costs A$6.10
(US$4.90/£2.45) adults, A$3.20 (US$2.55/£1.30) children.
Buy single-trip and two-hour tram tickets at ticket machines on trams,
ticket offices (such as at the tram terminal on Elizabeth Street, near Flin-
ders Street), at most newsdealers, and at Metcard vending machines at
many railway stations. A Metcard must be validated by the Metcard Vali-
dator machine on the tram, on the station platform, or on the bus before
each journey; the only exception to this is the 2-Hour Metcard purchased
from a vending machine on a tram, which is automatically validated for
that journey only. Vending machines on trams only accept coins — but
give change — while larger vending machines at train stations accept
coins and paper money and give change up to A$10 (US$8/£4).
You can pick up a free route map from the Melbourne Visitor Centre,
Federation Square, or the Met Information Centre, 103 Elizabeth St., 
at the corner of Collins Street (% 13 16 38 in Australia; www.metlink
melbourne.com.au), which is open Monday through Friday from 8:30
a.m. to 4:30 p.m., and Saturday from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m.
The City Circle Tram is the best way to get around the center of
Melbourne — and it’s free. The burgundy-and-cream trams travel a 
circular route between all the major central attractions, and past shop-
ping malls and arcades. The trams run, in both directions, every 12 min-
utes between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m., except Good Friday (Fri before Easter)
and December 25. The trams run along all the major thoroughfares
including Flinders and Spencer streets. Burgundy signs mark City 
Circle Tram stops.
Normal trams stop at green-and-gold tram-stop signs, sometimes in the
middle of the road (so beware of oncoming traffic!). To get off the tram,
press the red button near handrails or pull the cord above your head.
Part III: Sydney, Melbourne, and the ACT 
200

By bus
The free Melbourne City Tourist Shuttle operates buses that pick up
and drop off at 15 stops around the city, including the Melbourne
Museum, Queen Victoria Market, Immigration Museum, Southbank Arts
Precinct, the Shrine of Remembrance and Botanic Gardens, Chinatown,
and Flinders Lane, among others. You can hop on and off during the day.
The bus runs every 15 minutes from 10 a.m. until 4 p.m. daily, taking in
many of Melbourne’s attractions.
By taxi
Cabs are plentiful in the city, but hailing one may be difficult in the 
city center late on Friday and Saturday night. Taxi companies include
Silver Top (% 13 10 08), Embassy (% 13 17 55), and Yellow Cabs
(% 13 22 27).
By car
Driving in Melbourne can be challenging. Roads can be confusing, there
are trams everywhere, and there is a strange rule about turning right
from the left lane at major intersections in the downtown center (which
leaves the left-hand lane free for oncoming trams and through traffic).
Here, you must wait for the lights to turn amber before turning. Also,
you must always stop behind a tram if it stops, because passengers usu-
ally step directly into the road. Add to this the general lack of parking
and expensive hotel valet parking, and you’ll know why it’s better to 
get on a tram instead. For road rules, pick up a copy of the Victorian
Road Traffic handbook from bookshops or from a Vic Roads office 
(% 13 11 71 for the nearest office).
Major car rental companies, all with offices at Melbourne Airport,
include Avis, 8 Franklin St. (% 03/9663 6366); Budget, 398 Elizabeth St.
(% 03/9203 4844); Hertz, 10 Dorcas St., South Melbourne (% 13 30 39
or 03/9698 2444); and Thrifty, 390 Elizabeth St. (% 1300/367 227).
Expect to pay at least A$40 (US$32/£16) per day for a small car.
By boat
Melbourne River Cruises (% 03/8610 2600; www.melbcruises.com.au)
offers a range of boat trips up and down the Yarra River, taking about 
75 minutes. It’s an interesting way to get a feel for the city, and the 
tours include commentaries. Tours cost A$20 (US$16/£8) adults, A$11
(US$8.80/£4.40) kids, A$50 (US$40/£20) families of four. Or you can com-
bine both up- and down-river tours for A$34 (US$27/£14) adults, A$19
(US$15/£7.60) kids, A$86 (US$69/£34) families. Call ahead to confirm
cruise departure times, because they change. Pick up tickets from the
blue Melbourne River Cruises kiosks at the Federation Square riverfront
(opposite Flinders Street Station).
Chapter 13: Melbourne 201

Staying in Style
Getting a room is generally easy on weekends in Melbourne, where many
hotels are busy with business travelers on weekdays. But advance book-
ings are recommended for whenever Melbourne is hosting a major
event, such as the Melbourne Cup, the Grand Prix, or the Australian
Open tennis tournament. Hostels in bayside St. Kilda tend to fill up
quickly in December and January as holidaymakers hit the sands.
To feel right in the heart of the action, stay in the city center, which
buzzes day and night. Another option is the inner-city suburbs, which all
have good street life, restaurants, and pubs — and are just a quick tram
ride from the city center. If you arrive without booked accommodations,
contact either of the travelers’ information desks (% 03/9297 1805) in
the international airport terminal, open daily from 6 a.m. to the last
flight. Or try the Best of Victoria booking service, Federation Square 
(% 1300/780 045 or 03/9928 0000), open weekdays from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.
and weekends from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.
The top hotels
Adelphi Hotel
$$$–$$$$
City Centre
It may be worth staying in this designer boutique hotel, a minute’s walk
from the city center, for the experience of taking a dip in its top-floor 25m
(82-ft.) lap pool, which juts out from the end of the building and overhangs
the streets. The pool has a glass bottom, so you can watch pedestrians
below. The 34 rooms are similarly modern, with colorful leather seating
and lots of burnished metal. Deluxe rooms differ from the so-called
Premier King rooms in that they come with a bathtub. Executive rooms
come with a separate lounge. Within the hotel is Ezard, a well-regarded
restaurant offering contemporary Australian fare.

Secrets of the seasons
Melbourne’s weather is notorious. “Four seasons in one day” is the stereotype, but
it’s not always true. Summers can be excruciatingly hot, and winter can bring snow to
the suburbs. A day may start out sunny and mild and end with a hailstorm — or vice
versa. That’s the beauty of it, but you have to be prepared. Melbourne’s residents love
its changing seasons, with balmy summer days, spectacular autumn colors, and crisp
winter days. With Victoria officially in drought, Melbourne may look dry and you may
be surprised to find people rejoicing when (or if) it rains.

Grand Hotel
$$$–$$$$
City Centre
This heritage-listed building is striking for its remarkable scale and impos-

Grand Hyatt

City Centre
The Grand Hyatt is a glamorous affair — the tower is infused with 24-carat
gold — in the best part of town, a short walk from Swanston Street,
Elizabeth Street, Chinatown, and public transport. The 548 rooms are large
and luxurious, and come with a nice-size marble bathroom and all the
details you’d expect from a five-star establishment. The hotel’s three diplo-
matic suites feature floor to ceiling windows that overlook the Botanic
Gardens and Yarra River. The suites’ bathrooms boast sunken spa tubs,
saunas, and rain showers. Prices vary with the view over the city, but the
best values are the Grand Club rooms, for which the rate includes evening
cocktails, canapés, afternoon tea, and full breakfast in the Grand Club
lounge. The hotel’s gymnasium and fitness center is Australia’s largest
hotel gym, and there’s also a new day spa offering the usual treatments as
well as therapeutic treatments to combat jet lag.

If you like your hotels stylish and contemporary, then the Hotel Lindrum is
for you. It’s typical of the new wave of modern hotels that emphasize trendy
design and have features like broadband access in the rooms and Wi-Fi in
the lobby. Standard rooms, if you can call them that, have a queen-size bed
or two singles, lots of hardwood, soft lighting, and forest greens — and even
a CD player. Superior rooms have king-size beds and lovely polished wood
floorboards, and deluxe rooms have wonderful views across to the Botanic

The Windsor is Australia’s only surviving authentic “grand” hotel. It
opened in 1883 and was restored to its original condition by Oberoi Hotels

The lobby is luxuriously carpeted and the staff friendly and efficient.
Standard rooms are comfortable, with high ceilings and tasteful furnish-
ings. Each has a good-size bathroom. Deluxe rooms are twice as big, and
many have views of Parliament House and the Melbourne Cathedral across
the way. Suites are huge and furnished with antiques. Guests can choose

The Georgian Court’s appearance hasn’t changed
much since it was built in 1910; the sitting and dining rooms have high ceil-

Dining Out
Melbourne’s diverse population ensures a great selection of interna-
tional cuisines. Chinatown offers Chinese, Malaysian, Thai, Indonesian,
Japanese, and Vietnamese fare, often at bargain prices. Carlton has
plenty of Italian cuisine, but the outdoor restaurants on Lygon Street aim
at unsuspecting tourists and can be overpriced and disappointing.
Richmond is crammed with Greek and Vietnamese restaurants, and
Fitzroy has cheap Asian, Turkish, Mediterranean, and vegetarian food.
To see and be seen, head to Chapel Street or Toorak Road in South
Yarra, or to St. Kilda, where you can join the throng dining out along
Fitzroy and Acland streets. Most of the cheaper places in Melbourne are
BYO (bring your own wine or beer).
Smoking is banned by law in cafes and restaurants.

MODERN ITALIAN
Tucked away in a lane, this award-winning favorite of Melbournians is
unlikely to disappoint. You find stylish service and customers, and food
that mixes Italian favors with Australian flair — things like roast duck with
muscatel and grappa sauce, tasty pasta dishes, or the specials, which your

waiter will fill you in on. For lighter meals, there’s a bar menu of equally
tempting dishes from A$5.50 to A$16 (US$4.40–US$13/£2.20–£6.40).

TRATTORIA/PASTICCERIA
There will be crowds around the cake counters — of that you can be sure.
And you can also be assured that it’ll be worth lining up and waiting. If you
can get past the enormous mouthwatering array of excellent cakes on dis-
play, head to the a la carte restaurant section for some authentic Italian
food, done very well. Or just pop in for coffee and cake, or a gelato. If you
can’t get to Carlton, cafe-style Brunetti City Square is on the corner of
Swanston Street and Flinders Lane in the city.

Tucked into an atmospheric laneway in the heart of the city, Café Segovia
has a winning combination of friendly staff, simple cafe food, and an attrac-
tive buzz. It has an intimate interior, and there’s also seating outside in the
arcade, but you have to come early at lunchtime to nab a chair. The food
is light fare such as focaccias, cakes, and light meals (but the servings are
generous). There’s live music Thursday and Friday, and it’s one of our
favorite places to meet friends in the city.

ing you of a terrific night out or a wonderful lunch if we said that you
shouldn’t bother trying. If you’re looking for somewhere intimate,
crowded, well-run, that has superb but simple food, look no further. You
may have to wait for your table (have a drink in the bar, and they’ll call
you), but it’ll be worth the wait for delights such as yellowfin tuna carpac-
cio soused in lime-infused olive oil, or — a favorite — spaghettini tossed
with spinach, chilies, and oil.

Watch the sun go down over St. Kilda Beach, with a glass in hand, from the
veranda at Donovans, and you’ll find it the perfect way to end the day. Gail
and Kevin Donovan have transformed a 1920s bathing pavilion into a wel-
coming restaurant designed to make you feel as though you’re in a private
beach house. A log fire, book cases, scattered cushions, coffee-table books,
a jazz soundtrack, and the sound of water on the beach complete the pic-
ture. The menu includes a mind-boggling array of dishes, many big enough
for two. Chef Robert Castellani’s trademarks include steamed mussels, lin-
guine with seafood, and stuffed squid.

Chinatown
CANTONESE
Be prepared to splash out if you dine at this upscale restaurant just off
Little Bourke Street in Chinatown. Take a slow elevator up to the restau-
rant, which has widely spaced tables for privacy. The chefs are extremely
creative and use ingredients they find in the markets each day, and the
best idea is to take your waiter’s advice on what to order. The signature
dish is Peking duck. King crab dumplings in soup are a great starter, and
you can also order more unusual (and expensive) dishes, such as abalone.
The atmosphere is clubby and a bit old-fashioned; the service is superb.

with its chandeliers and murals reflecting the Florentine way of life. The
signature dishes are wet-roasted suckling lamb and suckling pig, and you
also find risotto, seafood, and steak dishes. Save some room for the choco-

The best way to order in this excellent Middle Eastern restaurant is to go
for several of the meze, small plates of tasty delicacies. In the newish
waterside precinct of Docklands, not far from the city center, Mecca Bah

pastry filled with Middle Eastern cheeses, silverbeet rolls filled with chick-
peas, rice, and herbs, or spicy lamb and pine nut boureks. There’s also an

steaks from regional Victoria are on the menu. You find tastes of things like
native pepper, lemon myrtle, roasted wattle seed, and saltbush leaves used
in the dishes. A casual bistro is outside, and the bar serves Victorian wines

Lentil As Anything
Vegetarian restaurant Lentil As Anything has a menu without prices, and a policy
where you pay whatever you feel the meal and service are worth. It’s not surprising
that it’s a hit. The food is organic, with noodles and vegetables and things like tofu,
curries, and stir-fries. Before you leave, you put your money in the box. There are four
Lentil restaurants in Melbourne — at Abbotsford (% 03/9419 6444), St. Kilda (% 03/
9534 5833), and Brunswick (% 03/9388 0222), where there is also Lentil Africa (% 03/

hours vary between the restaurants, so check the Web site (www.lentilas

Exploring Melbourne
The top attractions
Federation Square
When you’re “in” Federation Square (www.federationsquare.com.au),
you’ll appreciate what a great space it is. This is a place that polarizes
Melbournians — they either love it or hate it. We’re big fans. Visit on the
weekend and you can see that it really works as a gathering place, with lots
of events held in the amphitheatre. Restaurants and attractions are clus-
tered around the open piazza, which is cobbled with misshapen paving.
The architecture is made up of geometrical designs, and there’s also an
impressive glass atrium. “Fed Square,” as the locals call it, is home to the
National Gallery of Victoria: The Ian Potter Centre–Australian Art (see
later in this section) and the Australian Centre for the Moving Image
(ACMI). The National Gallery building contains the largest collection of
Australian art in the country, including Aboriginal and Torres Strait
Islander art. The ACMI has two state-of-the-art cinemas and areas where
visitors can view movies, videos, and digital media.
See map p. 213. Corner of Flinders Street and St. Kilda Road, opposite Flinders Street
Railway Station. Outdoor spaces are open 24 hours. Admission: Free, but charges
apply for some special events and exhibitions.
Melbourne Museum
This is Australia’s largest museum and one of its most interesting.
Highlights include a blue whale skeleton, an indoor rain forest, and a bril-
liant insect and butterfly collection. Kids love the exhibits, including cock-
roaches, ant colonies, and spiders, as well as the interactive stuff and
science displays, the Children’s Museum, and the mummified remains of
Australia’s most famous racehorse, Phar Lap. Bunjikata is an award-
winning Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Centre. The complex also
includes an IMAX movie theatre.

Chapter 13: Melbourne

Wed–Mon 10 a.m.–5 p.m. Closed Tues, Good Friday (Fri before Easter), Dec 25, and
until 1 p.m. on Apr 25.
The Ian Potter Centre–NGV Australia
This fascinating gallery, featuring 20 rooms dedicated to Australian art,
sits in the heart of Federation Square. Aboriginal art and colonial art col-
lections are the centerpieces, but you find modern paintings here, too, and
a constantly changing array of interesting exhibitions.
See map p. 213. Federation Square, Flinders Street. % 03/8660 2222. www.ngv.vic.
gov.au. Admission: Free. Open: Tues–Sun 10 a.m.–5 p.m. Closed Mon (except public
holidays), Good Friday (Fri before Easter), Dec 25, and until 1 p.m. on Apr 25.
Old Melbourne Gaol
This historic old prison, with its tiny cells and collection of death masks and
artifacts of 19th-century prison life, is one of our favorite places to take 
visitors. Some 135 hangings took place here, including that of notorious
bushranger Ned Kelly, in 1880. The scaffold where he was hanged still
stands, and his gun and a suit of armor used by a member of his gang are on
display. Profiles of prisoners give a fascinating perspective of what it was
like to be locked up here until the jail closed in 1929. Each Saturday, free per-
formances of The Real Ned Kelly Story — Such a Life are held at 12:30 p.m.
and 2 p.m. Chilling night tours run every Monday, Wednesday, Friday, and
Saturday, where you can experience the jail by candlelight with a “hangman”
who recounts tales from the jail, its inmates, and his infamous art. Not for
the fainthearted or children under 12. Tickets for the tours, available from
Ticketek (% 13 28 49; www.ticketek.com.au), cost A$25 (US$20/£10)
adults, A$17 (US$14/£6.80) children under 15. Allow one hour or more.
See map p. 213. Russell Street. % 03/9663 7228. Admission: A$13 (US$10/£5.20) adults,
A$7.50 (US$6/£3) children, A$34 (US$27/£14) families. Open: Daily 9:30 a.m.–5 p.m.
Closed Good Friday (Fri before Easter) and Dec 25. Tram: City Circle tram to corner
of Russell and Latrobe streets.
Queen Victoria Market
This Melbourne institution has hundreds of indoor and outdoor stalls,
where you can find anything from pets to vintage clothes. It’s a bit
cramped, and there’s a lot of junk, but you’ll get a real taste of Melbourne.
Look for the delicatessen section and cheap eateries, and allow at least an
hour to rummage about. The two-hour Foodies Tour of the market
explores its food and heritage. It runs Tuesday, Thursday, Friday, and
Saturday at 10 a.m. and costs A$28 (US$22/£11) per person, including sam-
pling. Top chefs give cooking classes, costing A$75–A$80 (US$60–US$64/
£30–£32) per session. Call % 03/9320 5835 for reservations. Night mar-
kets are held every Wednesday from 5:30 to 10 p.m. in summer (from late
Nov to late Mar, except the last week of Dec).
See map p. 213. Between Peel, Victoria, Elizabeth, and Therry streets on the north-
ern edge of the city center. % 03/9320 5822. www.qvm.com.au. Open: Tues and
Thurs 6 a.m.–2 p.m., Fri 6 a.m.–6 p.m., Sat 6 a.m.–3 p.m., Sun 9 a.m.–4 p.m. Closed

More cool things to see and do
 The City Museum at Old Treasury (% 03/9651 2233) tells the
story of Melbourne through several permanent exhibits and a vari-
ety of changing ones. Making Melbourne tells the city’s history,
while Built on Gold shows how Melbourne was built using the 
profits from the gold rushes. Built in 1857, the Old Treasury Building
is an imposing neoclassical sandstone structure that once housed
precious metal from the Ballarat and Bendigo gold rushes. The
building is on Spring Street (at the top of Collins Street). Admission
is A$8.50 (US$6.80/£3.40) adults, A$5 (US$4/£2) children, A$18
(US$14/£7.20) families. It’s open Monday through Friday from 9 a.m.
to 5 p.m., weekends and public holidays from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.
Closed Good Friday (Fri before Easter) and December 25 and 26.
 The Melbourne Aquarium (% 03/9620 0999; www.melbourne
aquarium.com.au) features a Barrier Reef–type exhibit, some
interesting jellyfish displays, and an enormous walk-through tank
with larger fish, sharks, and rays. It’s on the corner of Queens
Wharf Road and Kings Street. Admission is A$24 (US$19/£9.60)
adults, A$14 (US$11/£5.60) children 3 to 15, A$65 (US$52/£26) fami-
lies of five. It’s open daily from 9:30 a.m. to 6 p.m. Tram: City Circle.
Chapter 13: Melbourne 215
View from the top
Once Melbourne’s highest lookout, the Melbourne Observation Deck now has hot
competition in the bid to claim the city’s best views. The new Eureka Skydeck 88, the
highest public vantage point in the Southern Hemisphere, is on the 88th floor of the
Eureka Tower, Riverside Quay, Southbank (% 03/9685 0188; www.eurekatower.
com.au). The viewing deck gives a 360-degree view of the city below from 285m (935
ft.) above ground. But it’s not for those who have vertigo. And there’s more to get your
adrenaline pumping than just the view. Only the brave will enter a huge moving glass
cube called The Edge, essentially a 6-ton horizontal elevator that moves from inside
the walls of Skydeck 88, carrying 12 passengers out over the tower’s east side. As the
opaque glass cube reaches its full extension, the 45mm-thick (13⁄4-inch) glass becomes
clear, giving passengers uninterrupted — and incredibly scary — views below, above,
and to three sides. All this is accompanied by recorded sounds of creaking chains and
breaking glass. Ticket prices for adults are A$17 (US$14/£6.80) adults, A$9 (US$7.20/
£3.60) children, plus an extra A$12 (US$9.60/£4.80) adults and A$8 (US$6.40/£3.20) chil-
dren for the four-minute-long ride on The Edge. It’s open daily from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m.
By contrast, the Melbourne Observation Deck on the 55th floor — that’s 253m (830 ft.)
above the street — of the Rialto Building, 525 Collins St. (% 03/9629 8222; www.
melbournedeck.com.au), now seems a bit tame. Admission is A$15 (US$12/£6)
adults, A$8 (US$6.40/£3.20) children 5 to 15, A$40 (US$32/£16) families of six. It’s open
daily from 10 a.m. to 11 p.m.

 Melbourne Zoo (% 03/9285 9300; www.zoo.org.au) was built in
1862 and is the oldest zoo in the world. There are 3,000 animals,
including kangaroos, wallabies, echidnas, koalas, wombats, and
platypuses. Most animals are in almost natural surroundings or
well-tended gardens. Don’t miss the butterfly house, with its thou-
sands of colorful occupants; the free-flight aviary; the lowland
gorilla exhibit; and the treetop orangutan exhibit. The zoo is on
Elliott Avenue, Parkville, north of the city center. Admission is A$22
(US$18/£8.80) adults, A$11 (US$8.80/£4.40) children 4 to 15, A$52
(US$42/£21) families of four. It’s open daily from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.
Free guided tours run daily from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. Tram: 55 going
north on William Street to stop 25; 19 from Elizabeth Street to stop
16 (then a short walk, following signs). Train: Royal Park Station.
Shopping the Local Stores
Australians regard Melbourne as the country’s shopping capital — it has
everything from fashion houses to major department stores and unusual
souvenir shops. Start in the magnificent city arcades, such as the Block
Arcade (between Collins and Little Collins streets), which has more than
30 shops, and the Royal Arcade (from Little Collins Street to the Bourke
Street Mall). Then hit the courts and lanes around Swanston Street and
the Melbourne Central shopping complex between Latrobe and Lons-
dale streets. Next, fan out across the city, taking in Chapel Street in
South Yarra, for its fashions, and The Jam Factory, 500 Chapel St., South
Yarra (% 03/9860 8500), a series of buildings with a range of shops and
food outlets, including a branch of Borders bookshop. Get there on tram
no. 8 or 72 from Swanston Street. There’s also Toorak Road in Toorak,
for Gucci and other high-priced names; Bridge Road in Richmond, for
budget fashions; Lygon Street in Carlton, for Italian fashion, footwear,
and accessories; and Brunswick Street in Fitzroy, for a more alternative
scene.
High-fashion boutiques line the eastern stretch of Collins Street,
between the Grand Hyatt and the Hotel Sofitel, and Chapel Street in
South Yarra. In addition, dozens of retail shops and factory outlets are
around the city, many of them on Bridge Road near Punt Road and Swan
Street near Church Street in Richmond. You find designer clothes at a
fraction of the original price.
In the city, the hottest fashion center is the QV building, which takes up
a block, bordered by Swanston, Russell, Lonsdale, and Little Lonsdale
streets. Despite its size, it has a nice feel to it. This is where you find top
Australian and international designers, tucked into QV’s laneways. The
premium fashion alley is Albert Coates Lane, where you find the likes of
Christensen Copenhagen and Wayne Cooper.
Collins Street features most international labels as well as shoe heaven
Miss Louise, 123 Collins St. (% 03/9654 7730). Nearby Flinders Lane has
Part III: Sydney, Melbourne, and the ACT 
216

earned style status with the likes of Christine, 181 Flinders Lane 
(% 03/9654 2011), where women faint over the accessories. Down 
the road is Little Collins Street, another fashion-rat run. Look for local
labels Bettina Liano (% 03/9654 1912), Scanlan & Theodore
(% 03/9650 6195), and Verve (% 03/9639 5886). Alice Euphemia,
37 Swanston St. (% 03/9650 4300), also stocks upcoming Australian 
and New Zealand designers.
For Aboriginal paintings and other indigenous arts and crafts, try the
Aboriginal Gallery of Dreamings, 73–77 Bourke St. Mall (% 03/9650
3277), and Original & Authentic Aboriginal Art, 90 Bourke St. 
(% 03/9663 5133; www.authaboriginalart.com.au).
The Australian Geographic Shop has two city center stores, at Shop
253, Melbourne Central, 300 Lonsdale St. (% 03/8616 6725), and in the
Galleria Shopping Plaza, Little Collins Street (% 03/9670 5813). They
stock Australiana, including crafts, books, and various gadgets.
The city’s two major department stores are Myer and David Jones (or
DJ’s as it’s known). Both span two city blocks and are separated into
men’s and women’s stores. David Jones, 310 Bourke St. Mall (% 03/9643
2222; www.davidjones.com.au) has a fabulous food hall. Myer, 314
Bourke St. Mall (% 03/9661 1111; www.myer.com.au), is the grande
dame of Melbourne’s department stores, and has household goods, per-
fume, jewelry, and fashions, as well as a food section. It’s a little less con-
servative than David Jones.
Serious shoppers may like to contact Shopping Spree Tours
(% 03/9596 6600; www.shoppingspree.com.au), a company that 
takes you to exclusive and alternative shopping venues, manufacturers,
and importers that you likely wouldn’t find by yourself. Tours depart
Monday through Saturday (except holidays) at 8:30 a.m. and cost A$74
(US$59/£30) adults, A$35 (US$28/£14) children under 12. They’ll pick 
you up at hotels in the city center.
Living It Up after Dark
Finding out what’s happening
The official government entertainment information site (www.melbourne.
vic.gov.au/events) shows “What’s On” in the theater world for up to
two months in advance, as well as what’s happening in dance, film,
comedy, music, exhibitions, sports, and tours. The best place to buy
tickets for everything from theater to major sporting events, and to
obtain details on schedules, is Ticketmaster (% 13 61 00 in Australia;
www.ticketmaster.com.au).
Chapter 13: Melbourne 217

Raising the curtain on performing arts and music
Melbourne’s performing-arts scene offers everything from offbeat 
productions to large-scale Broadway-style musicals. The city is also 
the home of prestigious festivals, with the annual Melbourne 
Fringe Festival (www.melbournefringe.com.au) and Melbourne
International Comedy Festival (www.comedyfestival.com.au),
attracting the best of Australian and international talent. Try to get tickets
if you’re in town during either festival, but keep in mind that hotels fill
up fast at these times. Another good time to plan your visit is during late
July to mid-August, when the Melbourne International Film Festival
(www.melbournefilmfestival.com.au) is on. The Arts Centre, which
you’ll identify from the spire atop the Theatres Building, on the banks of
the Yarra, is the city’s leading performing arts complex, home to the
State Theatre, the Playhouse, and the Fairfax Studio.
Buy half-price tickets for events including opera, dance, and drama, on
the day of the performance from Half-Tix (www.halftixmelbourne.
com) in the Melbourne Town Hall on Swanston Street. The booth is open
Monday 10 a.m. to 2 p.m., Tuesday through Thursday 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.,
Friday 11 a.m. to 6:30 p.m., and Saturday 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. (also selling
for Sun shows). Tickets must be purchased in person and in cash.
Available shows are displayed on the booth door and on the Web site.
Theater
The Arts Centre, 100 St. Kilda Rd (% 1300/136 166 for tickets, or
03/9281 8000; www.theartscentre.net.au) is the focal point for most
major theater events. The State Theatre seats 2,085 on three levels and
hosts opera, ballet, musicals, and more. The Playhouse is a smaller
venue that often books the Melbourne Theatre Company. The Fairfax is
more intimate still, and is often used for experimental theater or cabaret.
Hamer Hall is home of the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra and often
host to visiting orchestras and many international stars. Guided tours of
the complex are run at noon and 2:30 p.m. Monday through Saturday,
and backstage tours are on Sundays at 12:15 p.m. Tours cost A$11
(US$8.80/£4.40) adults, A$28 (US$22/£11) families; A$14 (US$11/£5.60)
per person on Sundays.
Buy tickets from the concierge in the foyer of the Theatres Building.
Ticket prices vary depending on the event. The Box Office is open
Monday through Saturday 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. in the Theatres Building.
Here are some of the other top venues in town:
 The Comedy Club, at the Athenaeum Theatre, 188 Collins St. 
(% 03/9650 6668), is the place to see local and international
comedy acts, musicals, and special shows. It offers a dinner and
show Friday and Saturday for A$35 (US$28/£14). Discount ticket
offers can bring the show-only price down to as low as A$7
(US$5.60/£2.80) sometimes, so ask what’s on offer.
Part III: Sydney, Melbourne, and the ACT 
218

 The Comedy Theatre, 240 Exhibition St. (% 03/9299 4951), seats
more than 1,000 people, but with an ornate Spanish rococo interior,
it still has an intimate feel. Plays and musicals usually fill the bill,
but dance companies and comedians also appear.
 The Forum Theatre, 154 Flinders St. (% 03/9299 9700), books
well-known bands and international comedians. Seating is in
cabaret-style booths, from which you can order drinks and meals.
 Sidney Myer Music Bowl, in King’s Domain, off Alexandra Avenue,
is a massive outdoor entertainment center, run by The Arts Centre.
You’ll come here in summer for opera, jazz, and ballet, and for ice-
skating in the winter. Bookings are through Ticketmaster (% 1300/
136 166).
Checking out the club and bar scene
Some of Melbourne’s best bars and clubs are hidden down atmospheric
alleys. You’ll find nightclubs of varying quality in the King Street area,
but the city’s best are unique, secluded bars and clubs. Sometimes you
can follow the crowds and see what appeals to you; otherwise the fol-
lowing options are some of Melbourne’s more enduring and appealing.
 Young & Jackson, at Flinders and Swanston streets (% 03/9650
3884; www.youngandjacksons.com.au), is Melbourne’s oldest
pub. Whether you’re stopping in for a drink or a meal in the stylish
upstairs restaurant or bistro areas, head upstairs to see the nude
Chloe, a famous painting brought to Melbourne from Paris for the
Great Exhibition in 1880. The painting has a special place in the
hearts of customers and Melbournians. The pub, built in 1853,
started selling beer in 1861.
 For jazz fans, Bennetts Lane Jazz Club, 25 Bennetts Lane 
(% 03/9663 2856; www.bennettslane.com) is one of the best in
Australia. The back-lane location may be a little hard to find, but
inside it’s everything a jazz club should be. The best international
players seek it out and the music is often exceptional and always
varied. Open every night from 8:30 p.m. (music starts at 9:30 p.m.).
The cover is A$12 (US$9.60/£4.80).
Chapter 13: Melbourne 219
Crown Casino
Melbourne is home to Australia’s largest casino, a plush affair that’s open 24 hours.
You’ll find all the usual roulette and blackjack tables and so on, as well as an array of
gaming machines. Crown Casino (or just “Crown”), Clarendon Street, Southbank 
(% 03/9292 6868; www.crowncasino.com.au), is also a major venue for interna-
tional headline acts, and there are around 25 restaurants and 11 bars on the premises,
with more in the extended Southgate complex of which it’s a part.

 The tiny but hugely atmospheric Double Happiness, 21 Liverpool
St. (% 03/9650 4488), has a retro-Asian theme that would make
Chairman Mao proud. Rub shoulders with hip young business
types and make sure you order a Gang of Four cocktail (mango,
vodka, Cointreau, and lemon). Open Monday through Thursday 
5 p.m. to 1 a.m. (until 3 a.m. on Thurs), Friday 4:30 p.m. to 3 a.m.,
Saturday 6 p.m. to 3 a.m., and Sunday 6 p.m. to 1 a.m.
 A younger crowd frequents the Hi-Fi Bar & Ballroom, 125 Swanson
St. (% 03/9654 7617; www.thehifi.com.au), which has lots of live
music — mostly hard rock and contemporary. This cavernous
underground venue features many visiting acts. Ticket prices vary
and can be anywhere between A$15 and A$55 (US$12–US$44/
£6–£22).
A Day Trip from Melbourne: Phillip Island
Phillip Island’s penguin parade, which happens every evening at dusk,
is one of Australia’s most popular animal attractions. Phillip Island also
offers nice beaches, good bushwalking, fishing, and Seal Rocks.
Getting there
Most visitors come to Phillip Island on a day trip and arrive in time for
the Penguin Parade and dinner. Several tour companies run day trips.
Among them are Gray Line (% 03/9663 4455; www.grayline.com),
which operates penguin trips daily departing Melbourne at 1:30 p.m. and
returning at around 11:30 p.m. Tours cost A$117 (US$94/£47) adults,
A$59 (US$47/£24) children, and can be booked online before arrival.
If you’re driving yourself, Phillip Island is an easy two-hour trip from
Melbourne along the South Gippsland Highway and then the Bass
Highway. A bridge connects the highway to the mainland.

Bar Secrets
For an easy way of sorting out which bar may appeal to you, consult the cards. Bar
Secrets Melbourne (www.bar-secrets.com) is a pack of 52 cards, each featuring
one of the city’s great drinking holes. The cards have pictures of, and information
(including maps) on, the hippest and most unusual pubs and bars in town. Pick a few
at random, and your night is quickly planned. The cards cost A$9.95 (US$7.95/£4) at
bookshops and newsdealers. They’re worth seeking out. You’ll find yourself weaving
up alleyways, climbing into lofts and down into basements, and ending up somewhere
unique.

Getting information after you arrive
The Phillip Island Visitor Information Centre, 895 Phillip Island Tourist
Rd., Newhaven (% 1300/366 422 in Australia, or 03/5956 7447; www.
visitphillipisland.com), is an attraction itself, with interactive com-
puter displays, dioramas, and a small theater. It’s open daily from 9 a.m.
to 5 p.m. (to 6 p.m. in summer), and 1 to 5 p.m. on Good Friday (Fri
before Easter) and December 25.
The top attraction
Phillip Island Penguin Reserve
The Penguin Parade takes place every night at dusk, when hundreds of
penguins gather in the shallows, and waddle up the beach toward their
burrows. They’re the smallest of the world’s 17 species of penguins, stand-
ing 33cm (13 in.) high, and they’re the only penguins that breed on the
Australian mainland. Flash photography is banned, as are smoking and
touching the penguins. Wear a sweater or jacket, because it gets chilly after
the sun goes down. Reservations for the Penguin Parade are essential
during busy holiday periods such as Easter and summer. For a better
experience, there are more exclusive small group tours which allow you a
better view of the penguins. Penguins Plus allows you to watch the parade
from an exclusive boardwalk in the company of rangers, while the Penguin
Sky Box is an adults-only elevated viewing tower. The Ultimate Penguin
Tour for groups of ten people (no children under 16), takes you to a
secluded beach away from the main viewing area to see penguins coming
ashore. Another option is a ranger-guided tour, a few hours before the pen-
guins appear, to see behind-the-scenes research.

 Discovering Ned Kelly
W
hen you’ve finished exploring Melbourne’s cosmopolitan streets
and laneways, it’s time to head into the Victorian countryside.
Diversity is the watchword here; as you travel around Australia’s south-
ernmost mainland state, you’ll see landscapes of all kinds, from rain
forests and mountain ranges to parched Outback desert and a rugged
coast where waves crash dramatically onto sandstone outcrops.
Melbourne may be the heart of the state, but the Murray River, which
separates Victoria from New South Wales, is its lifeblood, providing irri-
gation for vast areas of semidesert. As Australia’s drought has worsened
over recent years, the once-mighty Murray has been a focus of concern,
which is likely to still be in the news when you visit.
In this chapter, we give you a few of the myriad possibilities for explor-
ing Victoria, from one of the great scenic drives of the world to heading
inland and upward and following the footsteps of Australia’s most
famous outlaw.
Driving the Great Ocean Road
The Great Ocean Road is one of Australia’s most spectacular drives. It
hugs the coast starting in Torquay, 94km (58 miles) southwest of
Melbourne, and passes through attractive small towns — Anglesea,
Lorne, Apollo Bay, Port Campbell, and Peterborough — until it reaches
Warrnambool. The scenery along the 106km (66-mile) route includes
huge cliffs, ocean vistas, beaches, rain forests, and incredible rock for-
mations. The most spectacular is the 27km (17-mile) stretch between
Princeton and Peterborough. The best way to travel along the Great
Ocean Road is to drive yourself at a leisurely pace, stopping wherever

likely to find a menu that includes dishes such as lamb cutlets on a bed of
olives, pine nut and spinach risotto, or homemade sweet potato and
spinach gnocchi. Over summer (Dec–Mar) the restaurant becomes Simply
Seafood. There’s often live music on Friday or Saturday night.
42 Bank St., Port Fairy. % 03/5568 2891. Main courses: Lunch A$15–A$21 (US$12–
US$17/£6–£8.40), dinner A$20–A$30 (US$16–US$24/£8–£12). AE, DC, MC, V. Open:
Tues–Sun noon to 2 p.m. and 6 p.m. to late.
Exploring the Great Ocean Road
Your first stop along the coastal road is likely to be at the surfing town of
Torquay. The main surf beach is much nicer than the one farther down
the coast at Lorne. Check out Surf World museum, Surf City Plaza, Beach
Road, West Torquay (% 03/5261 4606; www.surfworld.org.au), which
has interactive exhibits dealing with surfboard design and surfing his-
tory, and a video of the world’s best surfers. Admission is A$8.50
(US$6.80/£3.40) for adults, A$6 (US$4.80/£2.40) for children, and A$19
(US$15/£7.60) for families. It’s open daily from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. (closed
Dec 25). Bells Beach, just down the road, is world-famous in surfing cir-
cles for its perfect waves.
Lorne has some nice boutiques and is a good place to stop for lunch or
to spend the night. The stretch from Lorne to Apollo Bay is one of the
most spectacular sections of the Great Ocean Road; the road snakes
along a cliff edge with the ocean on the other side. Apollo Bay, once a
whaling station, is a pleasant, low-key town with sandy beaches. Next
you come to the Angahook-Lorne State Park, which protects most of
the coastal section of the Otway Ranges from Aireys Inlet, south of
Anglesea, to Kennett River. It has many well-marked rain forest walks
Part III: Sydney, Melbourne, and the ACT 
228

and picnic areas at Shelly Beach, Elliot River, and Blanket Bay. Plenty of
wildlife is around.
About 13km (8 miles) past Apollo Bay, just off the main road, you can
stroll on the Maits Rest Rainforest Boardwalk. A little farther along, an
unpaved road leads north past Hopetoun Falls and Beauchamp Falls to
Beech Forest. Seven kilometers (41⁄3 miles) farther along the main road,
another unpaved road heads south for 15km (91⁄3 miles) to a windswept
headland and the Cape Otway Lightstation (% 03/5237 9240; www.
lightstation.com), one of several lighthouses along the coast. Built by
convicts in 1848, the 100m-tall (328-ft.) lighthouse is open to tourists.
Admission is A$11 (US$8.80/£4.40) for adults and A$6 (US$4.80/£2.40) for
children. It’s open daily from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Free guided tours are run
regularly.
Back on the main road, your route heads inland through an area known
as Horden Vale before running to the sea at Glenaire — there’s good
surfing and camping at Johanna, 6km (33⁄4 miles) north. Then the Great
Ocean Road heads north again to Lavers Hill, a former timber town. Five
kilometers (3 miles) southwest of Lavers Hill is Melba Gully State Park,
where you can spot glowworms at night and walk along routes of rain
forest ferns. Check out one of the last giant gum trees that escaped the
loggers — it’s some 27m (88 ft.) in circumference and is estimated to be
more than 300 years old.
The next place of note is Moonlight Head, which marks the start of the
Shipwreck Coast — a 120km (74-mile) stretch running to Port Fairy that
claimed more than 80 ships at the end of the 19th century and the begin-
ning of the 20th.
Just past Princetown, you’re nearing the biggest attraction of the trip,
Port Campbell National Park. With its sheer cliffs and coastal rock
sculptures, it’s one of the most recognizable natural images of Australia.
You can’t miss the Twelve Apostles, a series of rock pillars just offshore
in the surf. Other attractions are the Blowhole, which throws up huge
sprays of water; the Grotto, a rock formation carved by the waves;
London Bridge, which looked quite like the real thing until the center of
the bridge crashed into the sea in 1990; and the Loch Ard Gorge. Port
Fairy, a lovely fishing town once called Belfast by Irish immigrants who
settled here to escape the potato famine, is also on the Shipwreck Coast.
Taking a guided tour along the Great Ocean Road
Tours to the Great Ocean Road take around 12 hours (sometimes more),
which makes for a big day out even when you aren’t doing the driving.
But if you really can’t spare more time, several companies do day tours
from Melbourne. The coach operator AAT Kings (% 03/9663 3377; www.
aatkings.com.au) runs daily trips that cost A$129 (US$103/£52) for
adults, and A$65 (US$52/£26) for children. Gray Line sightseeing tours
(% 1300/858 687 or 03/9663 4455; www.grayline.com) also has day
trips for a similar price. A better option would be Gray Line’s two-day
Chapter 14: The Best of Victoria 229

Great Ocean Road tour, which overnights in Lorne. It costs A$349
(US$279/£140) adults double (single supplement is A$61/US$49/£24) 
and A$120 (US$96/£48) for children.
Wild-Life Tours (% 1300/661 730 in Australia, or 03/9741 6333;
www.wildlifetours.com.au) offers several well-priced, multiday, 
backpacker-style tours that take in the Great Ocean Road tour from
Melbourne. A one-day tour costs A$90 (US$72/£36), and a two-day tour,
which overnights at Hall’s Gap and also takes in the Grampians, costs
A$183 (US$146/£73), including accommodations.
Autopia Tours (% 1800/000 507 in Australia, or 03/9419 8878; www.
autopiatours.com.au) offers a one-day tour from Melbourne taking 
in all the sights and including lunch and a bushwalk in Otway National
Park. It costs A$95 (US$76/£38). The company does a more relaxed
three-day tour for A$375 (US$300/£150), including most meals and dorm
accommodations in hostels. Upgrades to double rooms are A$65 (US$52/
£26) per person; to single rooms, A$150 (US$120/£60) per person.
The High Country
Victoria’s High Country consists of the hills and mountains of the Great
Dividing Range, which runs almost the length of eastern Australia, from
Queensland in the north to the western part of Victoria. The highest
peak in the Victoria segment of the range is Mount Bogong, at 1,988m
(6,521 ft.). The main attractions of the High Country are its natural fea-
tures, which include moorland and typical mountainous alpine scenery,
and its wealth of outdoor activities, including skiing, hiking, canoeing,
white-water rafting, mountain-biking, and rock climbing. The Victorian
ski fields are based around Mount Buller, Mount Stirling, Falls Creek,
Mount Buffalo, and Mount Hotham.
If you plan to go walking here, make sure you have plenty of water and
sunscreen, and be aware that as in any alpine region, temperatures can
plummet dramatically. In summer, the days can be hot and the nights
can be very cold.
The townships of Bright (310km/193 miles northeast of Melbourne) and
Beechworth (267km/166 miles northeast of Melbourne) are good bases
for exploring the High Country. Set in a valley and surrounded by pine
forests, Bright is known for its dramatic fall colors. There are nice walks,
especially along the Ovens River, or you can hire bicycles and take off
down a former railway track, now the Rail Trail (www.railtrail.com.
au). The track stretches 94km (58 miles) from Bright to Wangaratta, but
you can turn back whenever you want.
Historic Beechworth, one of Victoria’s best-preserved gold rush towns,
has more than 30 buildings listed by the National Trust, including pubs,
churches, government offices, miners’ cottages, and the jail where
bushranger Ned Kelly was imprisoned (see the sidebar “The story of
Ned Kelly” for more information).
Part III: Sydney, Melbourne, and the ACT 
230

Getting to the High Country
V/Line trains (www.vline.com.au) run daily between Melbourne and
Bright, via Wangaratta. Return fares cost A$91 (US$73/£36), though if you
travel in off-peak times, it’s much cheaper. The trip takes about four
hours, and from Wangaratta, you take the bus to Bright. However, getting
around the area without your own transport is difficult.
Chapter 14: The Best of Victoria 231
The story of Ned Kelly
The story of bushranger Ned Kelly is legend. Kelly is a folk hero to many and a crimi-
nal to others. Opinion may be divided, but 125 years after the events that made him
famous, he is still a presence in Australia. The area of Victoria he lived in is called Kelly
Country, and, in 2005, to mark the anniversary of his death, the government created
the Ned Kelly Touring Route (www.nedkellytouringroute.com.au), linking
important sites in the story.
Ned was the eldest of eight children born to Irish parents in Victoria in 1854. When Ned
was 12, his father died and the family moved to Greta, 240km (150 miles) northeast of
Melbourne. Like many other poor families, the Kellys took up the government’s offer of
cheap land. As part of the deal, they had to clear the bushland, build a house, and plant
crops. More often than not, the land parcels were too small and the soil was too poor
for them to make a living. At 16, Ned was convicted of horse-rustling and sentenced to
three years in jail. A few years later, his mother was imprisoned for allegedly attacking
a police officer who was accused of attacking Ned’s sister first. During the scuffle, Ned
shot the officer through the wrist. Ned escaped — with a bounty on his head.
On October 26, 1878, together with friends Joe Byrne and Steve Hart, Ned and his
brother Dan came across police camped at Stringy Bark Creek. Ned believed the
police intended to kill him and his brother, so he called on them to surrender. Three
officers resisted, and in the fight that followed, Ned Kelly shot them dead. In the years
that followed, the Kelly Gang avoided capture with the help of sympathetic locals.
During this time, they robbed two banks, and during each robbery Ned gave his
hostages a letter, explaining to the government how he’d been persecuted by police.
In June 1880, police surrounded the Kelly Gang at the Glenrowan Hotel. Prepared for
the fight, the four bushrangers put on homemade suits of armor. It was no use — Ned’s
body took 28 bullets, and the others were all killed. Ned was hanged in Old Melbourne
Gaol (see Chapter 12) on November 11, 1880. He was 25 years old.
Glenrowan, a quiet town surrounded by wineries and orchards, pays homage to Ned
with a 6m-high (18-ft.) outdoor statue of the bushranger in his homemade armor 
and helmet, with rifle in hand, as well as a couple of small museums full of Kelly 
memorabilia — and much more besides. Other towns on the route include Avenel,
Benalla, Mansfield, and Jerilderie in southern New South Wales. You can pick up a
touring route brochure from the Old Melbourne Gaol before setting out, or from infor-
mation centers in the region.

Exploring the High Country
Alpine National Park
Victoria’s largest national park covers 646,000 hectares (1.6 million
acres) and connects the High Country areas of New South Wales and the
Australian Capital Territory. The park’s scenery is spectacular, encom-
passing most of the state’s highest mountains, rivers, escarpments,
forests, and high plains. It is easily accessed 330km (205 miles) north-
east of Melbourne. The flora is diverse; in all, some 1,100 plant species
have been recorded in the park, including 12 not found anywhere else.
Walking is particularly good in spring and summer, when a carpet of
wildflowers covers the Bogong High Plains. Other impressive trails
include the 5.7km (3
1/2-mile) route through Bryce Gorge to The Bluff, a
200m-high (356-ft.) escarpment with panoramic views. Of the other walk-
ing trails in the park, the best known is the Alpine Walking Track, which
bisects the park for 400km (248 miles) from Walhalla to the township of
Tom Groggin, on the New South Wales border.
Buchan Caves
The Buchan Caves are in a scenic valley that is lovely in autumn, when
all the European trees are losing their leaves. Tourists can visit the Royal
and Fairy caves (which are quite alike), with their fabulous stalactites
and stalagmites. Several tours run daily: from the end of Easter to
September at 11 a.m., 1 p.m., and 3 p.m.; from October to Easter at 
10 a.m., 11:15 a.m., 1 p.m., 2:15 p.m., and 3:30 p.m. Entry to one cave
costs A$13 (US$10/£5.20) for adults, A$6.50 (US$5.20/£2.60) for children
5 to 16, and A$32 (US$26/£13) for families of four. To reach the caves
from the Princes Highway, turn off at Nowa Nowa (it’s well marked). If
you’re coming south from Jindabyne, follow the Barry Way, which runs
alongside the Snowy River.
Snowy River National Park
The Snowy River National Park, with its lovely river scenery and magnifi-
cent gorges, protects Victoria’s largest forest wilderness areas. The
Snowy River was once a torrent, but a series of dams for a hydroelectric
scheme in the 1950s has reduced it to a trickle of its former self. And, 
of course, students of poetry will recognize it as the setting for Banjo
Paterson’s epic The Man from Snowy River.
Chapter 14: The Best of Victoria 233

The two main access roads into the Park are the Gelantipy Road from
Buchan and the Bonang Freeway from the logging township of Orbost.
MacKillop’s Road (also known as Deddick River Road) runs across the
park’s northern border from Bonang to a little south of Wulgulmerang.
The area around MacKillop’s Bridge, along MacKillop’s Road, has spec-
tacular scenery and the park’s best campgrounds, set beside some nice
swimming holes and sandy river beaches. The Barry Way leads through
the main township of Buchan (see the preceding section).
More cool things to see and do
 Keen walkers should pull on their boots and hit the trails. Ecotrek
(% 08/8383 4155; www.ecotrek.com.au) offers an eight-day
Bogong Alpine Traverse trek, including four nights camping and
three nights in ski lodges. It’s graded moderate/hard, and you carry
your own pack, but it’s worth the effort for the stunning panoramic
views of peaks, plains, and forested valleys. The trek costs A$1,695
(US$1,356/£678), including round-trip transport from Melbourne.
 Horseback-riding treks are another great way to explore the High
Country. Stoney’s High Country (www.stoneys.com.au) acts as a
one-stop shop for local tour operators offering trail rides. A two-
hour ride in the foothills costs around A$50 (US$40/£20); a day ride
to higher elevations, A$180 (US$144/£72); a weekend ride, around
A$400 (US$320/£160). Longer rides are also available — check the
Web site for details and phone numbers of operators. Stoney’s 
can also help you organize a custom ride, on dates of your choice.
Longer tours generally include camping, food, and just about every-
thing else, though you should check whether you’ll need a sleeping
bag.
 Angling Expeditions (% 03/5754 1466; www.anglingvic.com.au)
is the best option for fly-fishing for trout in the alpine area during
spring, summer, and fall. Trips last from three hours to all day and
are suitable for everyone from beginners to experts. Overnight
trips are also available.

 Exploring the Australian Capital Territory
I
f you’ve been to Washington, D.C., you’ve been to Canberra . . . not!
Both cities are federal capitals, and both were planned and laid out to
be what they are. And in the Land Down Under, Canberra (pop. 310,000)
offers gentle virtues and comforts: The roads are wide and well kept, 
the buildings are modern, and the suburbs are pleasant and leafy.
Canberra is also the seat of government and the home of thousands 
of civil servants — it’s very much a company town.
There are lots of open spaces, parklands, and monuments, and you’ll
find more than enough to keep you busy — from museum-going and
gallery-hopping to boating on Lake Burley Griffin.
Canberra was born after the Commonwealth of Australia was created in
1901. Melbourne and Sydney each bid to become the federal capital. In
the end, Australian leaders created a federal district and in 1908, they
chose an undeveloped area between the two cities.
Chicago landscape architect Walter Burley Griffin, a contemporary of
Frank Lloyd Wright, designed the city. The place he mapped out was
christened “Canberra” (a local Aboriginal word meaning “meeting
place”), and, by 1927, the first meeting of Parliament took place here.
Getting There
Canberra is between Sydney and Melbourne, and is easily accessible:
The drive is doable, it’s only a short flight from the eastern cities, and
it’s serviced well by trains, which means you have plenty of travel
options.

By air
Qantas (% 13 13 13 in Australia; www.qantas.com.au) runs frequent
daily service to Canberra from all the major cities. The fun, discount air-
line Virgin Blue (% 13 67 89 in Australia; www.virginblue.com.au)
offers discount daily flights to Canberra from Melbourne, Brisbane, and
Adelaide, but not from Sydney.
Canberra Airport is about 15 minutes from the city center. By taxi it
costs approximately A$20 (US$16/£8). In addition, the Airliner Bus
(% 02/6299 3722; www.deanesbuslines.com.au/queanbeyan) operates
a shuttle between the central business district and the airport daily, leav-
ing every half-hour on weekdays and hourly on weekends. The one-way
fare is A$7 (US$5.60/£2.80) and a round-trip costs A$12 (US$9.60/£4.80).
By train
Countrylink (% 13 22 32 in Australia; www.countrylink.info) runs
three Canberra Xplorer trains daily between Sydney and Canberra. The
four-and-a-quarter-hour trip costs around A$70 (US$56/£28) in first class,
A$50 (US$40/£20) in economy; children are half-price, and a round-trip
costs double.
Many people book Countrylink transport-hotel packages, which can save
you quite a bit. Depending on the accommodations in Canberra, prices
range from A$90 to A$190 (US$72–US$152/£36–£76) a night for a couple,
and if you book in advance, you can save up to 40 percent on the fare
through a Rail Escape package. Call Countrylink Holidays (% 13 28 29)
for details. Countrylink has an office at Wynyard CityRail station in Sydney.
From Melbourne, the Canberra Link, run by V/Line (% 13 61 96 in
Australia; www.vlinepassenger.com.au), involves a five-hour bus trip
and a three-and-a-half-hour train trip. It costs A$55 (US$44/£22) adults,
A$34 (US$27/£13) children and students. Canberra Railway Station
(% 02/6239 6707) is on Wentworth Avenue, Kingston, about 5km 
(3 miles) southeast of the city center. Coaches connect the railway 
station to the center.
By bus
Greyhound (% 13 14 99 in Australia, or 07/4690 9950; www.greyhound.
com.au) does ten runs a day from Sydney to Canberra. The trip takes
four to four-and-a-half hours and tickets cost around A$37 (US$30/£15)
adults, A$33 (US$27/£13) pensioners and students, A$29 (US$23/£12)
children 3 to 14. From Melbourne, tickets to Canberra cost A$62
(US$50/£25) adults, A$52 (US$42/£21) pensioners and students, A$46
(US$37/£18) children.
Advance-purchase fares can be as much as 35 percent lower.
Murrays Australia (% 13 22 51 in Australia; www.murrays.com.au)
runs buses from Sydney to Canberra five times a day. The journey costs
Part III: Sydney, Melbourne, and the ACT 
236

A$36 (US$29/£15) adults, A$29 (US$23/£12) children. Several sightseeing
companies in Sydney, including AAT King’s and Australia Pacific Tours,
offer day trips to Canberra.
Interstate buses arrive at Jolimont Tourist Centre, at the corner of
Northbourne Avenue and Alinga Street, Canberra City.
By car
The Australian Capital Territory (ACT) is surrounded by New South 
Wales. Sydney is 306km (190 miles) northeast, and Melbourne is 651km
(404 miles) southwest. From Sydney, you can use an extension to the 
M5 motorway that links with the Eastern Distributor highway near 
the Sydney airport. Veer left before you reach the airport, follow signs
heading toward Canberra, and veer left onto the M5. The drive takes
between three and three-and-a-half hours. From Melbourne, take the
Hume Highway to Yass and switch to the Barton Highway; the trip takes
about eight hours.
Orienting Yourself in Canberra
The first things that strike a visitor to Canberra are its parklike feel and
wide, unclogged roads. The city’s centerpiece is Capital Hill, where
Parliament House stands. A dozen avenues radiate off from here and
each of these broad, tree-shaded streets leads to a traffic circle, from
which more streets emanate. Around each hub, the streets form a pat-
tern of concentric circles.
Another of Canberra’s most notable features is Lake Burley Griffin, cre-
ated by damming the Molonglo River. The centerpiece of the lake is the
Captain Cook Memorial Jet, a spire of water that reaches 147m (482 ft.)
into the air.
Introducing the Neighbourhoods
 Civic: Canberra’s main shopping district is centered on North-
bourne Avenue, one of the city’s main thoroughfares. Officially it’s
known as Canberra City.
 Mount Ainslie: Northeast of Civic is this hill, featuring spectacular
views of the city and beyond from its summit. The Australian War
Memorial is at its foot.
 Parkes: Wedged between Commonwealth Avenue and Kings Avenue
is the National Triangle. Here you’ll find many of the city’s attrac-
tions, such as the National Gallery of Australia and Questacon (the
National Science and Technology Centre).
 Yarralumla: Many embassies and consulates are in this leafy
suburb east of Capital Hill.
Chapter 15: Canberra/ACT 237

Finding Information after You Arrive
The Canberra Visitors’ Centre, 330 Northbourne Ave., Dickson 
(% 02/6205 0044; www.visitcanberra.com.au), dispenses informa-
tion and books hotels. The office is open Monday through Friday from 
9 a.m. to 5:30 p.m., and Saturday and Sunday from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m.
Getting Around Canberra
 By taxi: Canberra’s only taxi company is Canberra Cabs (% 13 22
27 in Australia). Taxis are scarce and you may be asked to share a
cab from the airport to the city with other passengers. For this you
get a discounted fare.
 By bus: ACTION (% 13 17 10 in Australia, or 02/6207 7611; www.
action.act.gov.au) runs Canberra’s bus system. The central 
bus terminal is on Alinga Street in Civic. Single tickets cost A$3
(US$2.40/£1.20) adults, A$1.50 (US$1.20/£0.60) children 5 to 15.
Daily tickets cost A$6.60 (US$5.30/£2.70) adults, A$3.30 (US$2.60/
£1.30) kids; weekly tickets cost A$24 (US$19/£10) adults, A$12
(US$9.60/£4.80) kids. You can purchase single tickets on the bus
and daily and weekly tickets from most newsdealers and ACTION
interchanges (transfer points).
Bus route maps are available at bus interchanges, newsdealers, and
the Canberra Visitors’ Centre.
Canberra Day Tours (% 02/6298 3344; www.canberradaytours.
com.au) offers a hop-on/hop-off day tour by bus including stops at
Old Parliament House, the Australian War Memorial, Parliament
House, the Embassy region, Telstra Tower, and Lake Burley Griffin.
It costs A$35 (US$28/£14) adults, A$15 (US$12/£6) kids under 16.
The first bus leaves at 9:30 a.m. from the Canberra Visitors’ Centre.
 By bicycle: Canberra is unique in Australia for its extensive system
of cycle tracks — some 120km (74 miles) of them — which makes
sightseeing on two wheels a pleasurable experience. Rent a bike
from Mr. Spoke’s Bike Hire, Barrine Drive, near the ferry terminal,
Acton (% 02/6257 1188).
Staying in Style
Canberra’s accommodations are generally cheaper than in other state
capitals. Many people stay here during the week, so you can often find
cheaper weekend rates. Always ask about deals and packages. You
should be able to do better than the rack rates, especially booking
through the hotel’s Web site. The Canberra Visitors’ Centre
(% 02/6205 0044) has information about other accommodations
options.

Crowne Plaza Canberra

Civic
This hotel is next door to the National Convention Centre and Casino
Canberra. Its car-oriented approach makes it inconvenient for pedestri-
ans, but the gardens (Glebe Park) at the back are good for early-morning
strolls. Rooms face onto internal balconies that look down to the restau-
rants below. Standard rooms are user-friendly and comfortable; most come
with one queen-size bed or two doubles. Park-view doubles overlook the
gardens. The hotel has a medium-size indoor pool and an adequate health
club.

Hyatt Hotel Canberra
$$$$
Yarralumla
Visiting heads of state and pop stars make this their residence of choice
in Canberra, and it’s not hard to see why. It has a great location, a two-
minute drive from the city center, in the shadow of Parliament House, and
between Lake Burley Griffin and the Parliamentary Triangle. Originally the
Hotel Canberra, it opened in 1924. For many years the Hyatt was an impor-
tant part of Canberra’s social and political life, with key decisions affect-
ing all Australians being made over drinks in the bar. All staff members
wear 1920s costumes to add to the atmosphere. Some 39 rooms are in the
original two-story section. These have more historical appeal, but they’re
darker than their modern counterparts, which were added in the 1980s.
Standard rooms have king-size beds and marble bathrooms. The hotel has
a health club and spa, as well as a good indoor pool and a tennis court.

restaurants and ethnic eateries to appease the most refined of palates.
The Boat House by the Lake

Barton
MODERN AUSTRALIAN
On the shores of Lake Burley Griffin, the Boat House is a pleasant retreat
with water views. The large dining room’s floor-to-ceiling windows capture
the view, and the terrace is a nice spot on a sunny day for lunch. To start,
try Coffin Bay oysters, either natural with lemon, or topped with litchi,
avocado, and chile salsa. The wine list features local vintages.

ITALIAN/CAFE

Chairman and Yip

ASIAN AUSTRALIAN
This is one of Canberra’s best restaurants. Upbeat and popular with politi-
cal bigwigs, it has a reputation of being the place to see and be seen. The
chairs are comfortable, the menus are tucked inside art magazines, and
Mao-style pop art decorates the walls. A favorite is the prawns with home-
made chile jam, served on vermicelli noodles with mango salsa. Abalone

EUROPEAN/AUSTRALIAN
This plush dining room features hanging lamps and candlelight, cream
velour chairs, theatrical drapes, and thick blue carpets. There are two
dining areas: an intimate place behind the bar, and a larger, brighter space
with floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking a pebbled garden. The food is
French-influenced and features stand-out dishes such as roasted rabbit
with muscatel grapes, glazed pearl onions, bacon, Brussels sprouts and
butter puff pastry; or the caramelized suckling pig with cauliflower puree,
cinnamon spiced apple, and aromatic jus. A good choice is the seven-
course degustation menu for A$90 (US$72/£36) for food only and A$135
(US$108/£54) for food and wine. The wine list is very good.

MODERN AUSTRALIAN/CAFE
There’s a happy buzz of students and workers in this youthful joint. It
offers everything from light snacks, smoothies, and milkshakes to full
meals. The food is reasonably priced and contemporary, and the décor is
1970s retro. A great choice of alcoholic drinks and a range of freshly
squeezed fruit juices are offered. Milk and Honey also does pasta well; its
generous risotto stacked with seafood is recommended, too.

MODERN AUSTRALIAN/CAFE
Because it’s next to the bus terminal and close to the major shopping
areas, Tosolini’s pulls in the passing crowd. You can sit on the sidewalk
terrace and watch the world go by. Battered flathead and pan-fried broad-
bill (local fish) are tasty, but Tosolini’s made its name with its pastas and
focaccias. Try the popular spaghettini con granchio: succulent pieces of
blue swimmer crab, fresh tomato, rocket leaves, chilli, garlic and extra

MODERN AUSTRALIAN
The personal touches and service shine here, and the food is delicious.
The restaurant is decorated in upscale cafe style, with the kitchen staff on
show as they rustle up some of the capital’s best tucker. It’s relaxed, feel-
ing more communal than intimate on busy nights. A favorite dish is
Atlantic salmon served with beurre blanc sauce and potatoes. If you have
room left for dessert, don’t miss out on sticky date pudding with hot but-
terscotch sauce, pralines, and ice cream — it’s as good as it sounds.

Minimalist décor, vaulted ceilings, crisp linen, and white leather chairs

designed wine list, the polished service is non-intrusive but knowledge-
able. Waters Edge has received several awards including Canberra’s

The top attractions
Australian War Memorial
This monument to Australian troops who gave their lives for their country
is truly moving. Artifacts and displays tell the story of Australia’s conflicts
abroad. You won’t soon forget the exhibition on Gallipoli, the World War I
battle in which so many Anzac (Australian and New Zealand Army Corps)
servicemen were slaughtered. The Hall of Memory is the focus of the
memorial, where the body of the Unknown Soldier lies entombed. 
The memorial also holds one of the largest collections of Australian art 
in the world.

This information center, which stands beside huge tracking dishes, is a
must for anyone interested in space. There are plenty of models, audiovis-
ual recordings, and displays, including a spacesuit, space food, and
archival footage of the Apollo moon landings. The complex is still active,
tracking and recording results from space exploration projects, as well as
providing a link with NASA spacecraft. There’s no public bus service, but

National Museum of Australia
Using state-of-the-art technology and hands-on exhibits, the museum con-
centrates on three main themes: Australian society and its history since
1788; the interaction of people with the Australian environment; and
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander cultures and histories. It relies more
on images and sound than on historical objects to tell the stories 
of Australia. Allow a couple of hours if it grabs you, and 30 minutes if it
doesn’t.

Parliament House
Conceived by architect Walter Burley Griffin in 1912, but not built until
1988, Canberra’s focal point was designed to blend into its setting at the
top of Capital Hill; only a national flag supported by a giant flagpole rises
above the peak. In good weather, picnickers crowd the grass that covers
the roof, where the view is spectacular. Inside are more than 3,000 works
of Australian arts and crafts, and extensive areas of the building are open
to the public. Just inside the main entrance, look for a mosaic by Michael
Tjakamarra Nelson, Meeting Place, which represents a gathering of
Aboriginal tribes. Free 50-minute guided tours run throughout the day.

Part IV
Brisbane,
Queensland, and the
Great Barrier Reef

In this part . . .
T
raveling the vast state of Queensland — known around
Australia as the “Sunshine State” for its magniﬁcent
weather — is a vast undertaking in a territory with a huge
coastline to match its massive Barrier Reef.
In Chapter 16, we take you to its capital, Brisbane, a river city
with much to explore. Set your sightseeing dial to “relaxed”
and enjoy the balmy subtropical delights of this laid-back city.
Brisbane is also the gateway to the beaches of the Gold Coast
and the Sunshine Coast, to the south and north of the city,
respectively. We cover these destinations — along with the
rest of the coastline of Queensland — in Chapter 17.
This part is also where you ﬁnd everything you need to know
about planning a holiday on the Great Barrier Reef. We look at
jumping-off points for the reef from Cairns, in the north, to
the Whitsundays, farther south. Whether you’re a ﬁrst-time
snorkeler or an experienced diver, we offer tips aplenty on
how to get the most out of your time and ensure your visit is
one that you’ll remember forever.
In addition to the Reef, there’s plenty more to explore along
Queensland’s coast. Head for the rain forest or the islands.
Have close (but not too close) encounters with crocodiles,
cassowaries, dolphins, butterﬂies, birds, and other wildlife.
Go sea-kayaking, bungee-jumping, or white-water rafting. Stay
in ﬁve-star luxury or a tent on a remote island.

Brisbane
by Lee Mylne
In This Chapter
 Discovering sunny Brisbane, gateway to the Great Barrier Reef
 Sleeping, eating, and sightseeing in Brisbane
 Enjoying Brisbane’s nightlife
Queensland’s capital is rich in history and character; it’s friendly,
relaxed, and laid-back, befitting its subtropical climate. Set on the
banks of the Brisbane River, this is a city that has evolved from a coun-
try town to an increasingly sophisticated place. The city is green and
leafy: Moreton Bay fig trees give shade, and in summer, the purple haze
of jacarandas competes with the scarlet blaze of poinciana trees.
Brisbane (pronounced briz-bun) is known for its timber Queenslanders,
cottages and houses set high on stumps to catch the breeze, with wide
verandas to keep out the sun.
In the city center, colonial sandstone buildings stand alongside modern
glass towers. Wander in the city botanic gardens, in-line skate or bike
along the riverfront pathways, have a drink in a pub beer garden, or get
out on the river on a CityCat ferry, and you’ll discover Brisbane’s allure.
Getting around is cheap and easy, good food — including fantastic
seafood — is abundant, and accommodations are affordable, especially
in some of the city’s comfortable, elegant B&Bs.
Getting There
By plane
About 20 international airlines serve Brisbane from Europe, Asia, and 
New Zealand, including Qantas, Air New Zealand, Pacific Blue, Singapore
Airlines, Thai International, Malaysia Airlines, and Cathay Pacific. From
North America, you can fly direct from Los Angeles to Brisbane on Qantas,
but from other places you’ll likely fly to Sydney and connect on Qantas, or
fly direct from Auckland, New Zealand.

Qantas (% 13 13 13 in Australia; www.qantas.com.au) and its sub-
sidiary Qantaslink (book through Qantas) operate daily flights from
state capitals, Cairns, Townsville, and several other regional towns. No-
frills Jetstar (% 13 15 38 in Australia; www.jetstar.com.au) has daily

and Hobart and Launceston in Tasmania. Virgin Blue (% 13 67 89 in
Australia; www.virginblue.com.au) offers direct services from all capi-
tal cities as well as Cairns, Townsville, Hamilton Island and Proserpine in
the Whitsundays, Mackay and Rockhampton in Queensland, and New-
castle in New South Wales.
Getting oriented at the airport
Brisbane International Airport is 16km (10 miles) from the city, and the
domestic terminal is 2km (11⁄4 miles) farther away. The arrivals floor, on
Level 2, has an information desk that can help with flight inquiries, dis-
pense tourist information, and make hotel bookings, and a check-in
counter for passengers transferring to domestic flights.
Getting from the airport to your hotel
Coachtrans (% 07/3238 4700; www.coachtrans.com.au) runs a shuttle
between the airport and Roma Street Transit Centre every 30 minutes

national terminal and A$30 (US$24/£12) from the domestic terminal, plus
A$2 (US$1.60/£0.80) for departing taxis.
Airtrain (% 07/3216 3308; www.airtrain.com.au), a rail link between
the city and the domestic and international airport terminals, runs every

to city stations are A$12 (US$9.60/£4.80) adults, A$6 (US$4.80/£2.40) chil-
dren. The trip takes about 20 minutes. The Airtrain fare between the
international and domestic terminals is A$4 (US$3.20/£1.60). A taxi
between terminals costs about A$10 (US$8/£4).
By train
Queensland Rail (% 13 22 32 in Queensland; www.qr.com.au) operates
several long-distance trains to Brisbane from Cairns. The high-speed Tilt
Train takes about 25 hours and costs A$303 (US$242/£121) for business
class. The Sunlander takes 32 hours and costs A$207 (US$166/£83) for a
sitting berth, A$265 (US$212/£106) for an economy-class sleeper, A$409
(US$327/£164) for a first-class sleeper, or A$743 (US$594/£297) for the
all-inclusive Queenslander class. Countrylink (% 13 22 32 in Australia;
www.countrylink.info) runs two daily train services to Brisbane from
Sydney. The 7:15 a.m. departure arrives in the town of Casino, south of
Part IV: Brisbane, Queensland, and the Great Barrier Reef 
250

the border, at 6:34 p.m., where passengers transfer to a bus for the rest
of the trip to Brisbane, arriving at 10:20 p.m. The trip costs A$124
(US$99/£50) adults. The overnight train, which leaves Sydney at 
4:20 p.m. and arrives in Brisbane at 6:30 a.m. the next day, costs A$175
(US$140/£70) for a seat, an extra A$88 (US$70/£35) for a sleeper. Ask
about off-peak discounts, depending on the time of year.
All intercity and interstate trains pull into the city center’s Brisbane
Transit Centre at Roma Street, often called the Roma Street Transit
Centre. From here, most city and Spring Hill hotels are a few blocks’ walk
or a quick cab ride away. The station has food outlets, showers, tourist
information, and lockers.
Queensland Rail CityTrain (% 13 12 30 in Queensland) provides daily
train service from the Sunshine Coast and the Gold Coast.
By bus
All intercity and interstate coaches pull into the Brisbane Transit
Centre (see “By train,” earlier). Greyhound Australia (% 13 14 99 in
Australia, or 07/4690 9950; www.greyhound.com.au) serves the city sev-
eral times daily. A one-way Cairns–Brisbane ticket costs A$234 (US$187/
£94); the trip takes 291⁄2 hours. The Sydney–Brisbane trip takes 161⁄2 hours
and costs A$116 (US$93/£46) one-way. Coachtrans provides daily service
from the Gold Coast. Call Transinfo (% 13 12 30) for details.
By car
The Bruce Highway from Cairns enters the city from the north. The
Pacific Highway enters Brisbane from the south.
Orienting Yourself in Brisbane
Central Brisbane is easy to navigate when you remember that the east–
west streets are named after female British royalty, and the north–south
streets are named after their male counterparts. The northernmost is
Ann, followed by Adelaide, Queen, Elizabeth, Charlotte, Mary, Margaret,
and Alice. From east to west, the streets are Edward, Albert, George, 
and William, which becomes North Quay, flanking the river’s northeast
bank. Queen Street, the main thoroughfare, is a pedestrian mall between
Edward and George streets. Ann Street leads all the way east into Forti-
tude Valley. The main street in Fortitude Valley is Brunswick Street,
which runs into New Farm.
The city center’s office towers shimmer on the north bank of the Bris-
bane River. At the tip of the curve in the river are the Brisbane City
Gardens (sometimes called the City Botanic Gardens). The 30m (98-ft.)
sandstone cliffs of Kangaroo Point rise on the eastern side of the south
bank; to the west are the South Bank Parklands and the Queensland
Cultural Centre precinct, known as South Bank. The Goodwill Bridge,
Chapter 16: Brisbane 251

for pedestrians and bikes only, links South Bank with the City Gardens.
To the west, 5km (3 miles), is Mount Coot-tha (pronounced coo-tha).
The Brisbane Map, free from Brisbane Visitor Information Centre or your
concierge, shows the river and outlying suburbs, as well as the city. It’s
great for drivers because it shows parking lots and one-way streets on
the city-center grid. It can also be downloaded from www.ourbrisbane.
com. Rental cars usually come with street directories. Newsdealers and
some bookstores sell this map; the state auto club, the RACQ, in the
General Post Office, 261 Queen St. (% 13 19 05), is also a good source.
Introducing the Neighbourhoods
 City Center: This is where Brisbane people eat, shop, and socialize.
The Queen Street Mall is the heart of the city center. The Eagle
Street financial and legal precinct has great restaurants with river
views and Sunday markets. Strollers, bike riders, and in-line skaters
shake the heat in the green haven of the Brisbane City Gardens at
the business district’s southern end.
 Fortitude Valley: “The Valley” was once one of the sleazier parts of
town, but today you’ll find trendy pubs and cool cafes. The lanterns,
food stores, and shopping mall of Chinatown are here, too.
 New Farm: Always appealing, New Farm is great for cafe-hopping.
Merthyr Street is where the action is, especially on Friday and
Saturday night.
 Paddington: This hilltop suburb is a couple miles northwest of the
city. Brightly painted Queenslander cottages line the main street,
Latrobe Terrace, as it winds west along a ridge top. Many of the
houses have been turned into shops and cafes.
 Milton & Rosalie: Park Road, Milton, is distinguished by its replica
Eiffel Tower above the cafes and shops. Italian restaurants line the
street, buzzing with office workers. Sip a cappuccino, scout the
interior design stores for a new objets d’art, or stock up on Euro-
pean designer rags.
 West End: This small inner-city enclave is alive with ethnic restau-
rants, cafes, and interesting stores. Most action centers on the
intersection of Vulture and Boundary streets.
 Bulimba: One of the emerging suburbs, Bulimba has a long connec-
tion with the river through the boat-building industry. Take the
CityCat, and walk to Oxford Street, lined with cafes and shops.
Finding information after you arrive
The Brisbane Visitor Information Centre (% 07/3006 6290) is in the
Queen Street Mall, between Edward and Albert streets. It’s open Monday
through Thursday from 9 a.m. to 5:30 p.m., Friday 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. or
Part IV: Brisbane, Queensland, and the Great Barrier Reef 
252

later, Saturday 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., Sunday 9:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., and holi-
days 9 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. The official Web site (www.ourbrisbane.com)
and the Brisbane Transit Centre (% 07/3236 2020) are other good
sources of information.
Getting Around Brisbane
TransLink operates a network of buses, trains, and ferries. For time-
tables and route inquiries, call TransInfo (% 13 12 30; www.translink.
com.au; open: Mon–Thurs 6 a.m.–9 p.m., and from 6 a.m. Fri to 9 p.m.
Sun, although hours may vary on holidays). The easiest place to buy
your tickets is on the buses or at the train stations. You can also buy
tickets and pick up maps and timetables at the Queen Street bus station
information center (in the Myer Centre, off Queen Street Mall) and the
Brisbane Visitor Information Centre in the Queen Street Mall. Tickets are
also sold at some inner-city newsdealers.
A trip in one zone on the bus, train, or ferry costs A$2.20 (US$1.75/
£0.90). A ticket is good for up to two hours on a one-way trip on any
combination of bus, train, or ferry. When traveling with a parent, kids
under 5 travel free. Kids 5 to 14 and students pay half fare.
If you plan on using public transport a lot, a ten-trip ticket may be a
good investment.
You probably won’t need to travel farther than four zones on the trans-
port system. This will cost you A$3.40 (US$2.70/£1.35) each way. A one-
day ticket for four zones costs A$6.80 (US$5.45/£2.70).
On weekends and public holidays, it’s cheaper to buy an off-peak ticket,
which lets you travel all day for A$3.30 (US$2.65/£1.30) adults. The off-
peak ticket is also available on weekdays but cannot be used before 
9 a.m. or between 3:30 p.m. and 7 p.m.
By bus
Buses operate from around 5 a.m. to 11 p.m. weekdays, with less service
on weekends. On Sunday, many routes stop around 5 p.m. Most buses
depart from City Hall at King George Square, from Adelaide or Ann
Street.
The Downtown Loop is a free bus service that circles the city center.
The Loop’s red buses run on two routes, stopping at convenient places
including Central Station, Queen Street Mall, City Botanic Gardens, and
King George Square. Look for the red bus stops. They run every ten min-
utes from 7 a.m. to 5:50 p.m. Monday through Friday.

Information

Chapter 16: Brisbane 255

By ferry
The fast CityCat ferries run to many places, including South Bank and
the Queensland Cultural Centre; the restaurants and Sunday markets at
the Riverside Centre; and New Farm Park, not far from the cafes of
Merthyr Street. They run every half-hour between Queensland Univer-
sity, approximately 9km (51⁄2 miles) to the south, and Brett’s Wharf, about
9km (51⁄2 miles) to the north. Slower but more frequent CityFerry service
(Inner City and Cross River ferries) stops at a few more points, includ-
ing the south end of South Bank Parklands, Kangaroo Point, and Edward
Street outside the Brisbane City Gardens. Ferries run from around 6 a.m.
to 10:30 p.m. daily.
By train
Brisbane’s suburban rail network is fast, safe, and clean. Trains run from
around 5 a.m. to midnight (until about 11 p.m. on Sun). All trains leave
Central Station, between Turbot and Ann streets at Edward Street.
By car
Brisbane’s grid of one-way streets can be confusing, so plan your route
before you set off. Brisbane’s biggest car park is at the Myer Centre
(enter from Elizabeth Street) and is open 24 hours (% 07/3229 1699).
Most hotels and motels have free parking for guests.
Avis (% 13 63 33 or 07/3221 2900), Budget (% 1300/362 848 in
Australia, or 07/3220 0699), Europcar (% 13 13 90 in Australia, or
07/3006 7440), and Hertz (% 13 30 39 or 07/3221 6166) all have outlets
in the city center. Thrifty (% 1300/367 227 in Australia) is at 49 Barry
Parade, Fortitude Valley.
On foot
Because Brisbane is leafy, warm, and full of colonial-era Queenslander
architecture, it’s a great city for walking — except in summer, when it
can become uncomfortably hot and humid. Pick up one of the free
Heritage Trail Maps from the Brisbane Visitor Information Centre (see
“Finding information after you arrive,” earlier in this chapter). The map
books include a history of the area and detailed information of historic
buildings and other sights along the way.
A “floating” River Walk connects over 20km (13 miles) of pathways,
roads, bridges, and parks along the Brisbane River. You can stroll along
River Walk on the north bank of the river between the University of
Queensland at St. Lucia and Teneriffe, and on the south bank from the
West End ferry terminal at Orleigh Park to Dockside at Kangaroo Point.
The Brisbane City Council’s Gonewalking program (% 07/3403 8888)
runs about 80 free guided walks each week, exploring all kinds of terri-
tory, from bushland to heritage buildings to riverscapes to cemeteries.
The walks are aimed at locals, not tourists, so you’ll get to explore
Part IV: Brisbane, Queensland, and the Great Barrier Reef 
256

Brisbane and meet the locals at the same time. Each walk has a flexible
distance option and usually lasts about an hour.
The Brisbane Mobility Map outlines wheelchair access to buildings in
the city center and includes a detailed guide to the Queen Street Mall
and a map of the Brisbane Botanic Gardens Mount Coot-tha. The coun-
cil’s disability-services unit also has a range of publications, including a
Braille Trail and an access guide to parks, available from council cus-
tomer service centers (% 07/3403 8888).

The Stamford is one of Brisbane’s most luxurious hotels. It has river views
from every room — especially stunning from the southern rooms at night,
when the Story Bridge is illuminated. The guest rooms are not enormous,
but all fit a king-size bed or two twins. In what must be the biggest bath-
rooms in Brisbane, you’ll find small TVs. A riverside boardwalk leads from
the hotel to the Eagle Street Pier restaurants.

Dining Out
Stylish bistros and cafes line Merthyr Street in New Farm; cute cafes are
plentiful in Paddington; Asian eateries are a good choice around the
intersection of Vulture and Boundary streets in West End; and in

of upscale but laid-back restaurants, many with a Mediterranean flavor,
sits under the kitsch replica Eiffel Tower on Park Road in Milton. The
intersection of Albert and Charlotte streets buzzes with inexpensive,
good-quality cafes.
Breakfast Creek Hotel

Albion
CONTEMPORARY/STEAK
Built in 1889 and listed by the National Trust, this French Renaissance–
style pub is known as the Brekky Creek — or simply “the Creek.” It is a
Brisbane icon, famed for its gigantic steaks, and for serving beer “off the
wood” (from the keg). The Spanish Garden restaurant and the beer garden
are always popular, and an outdoor dining area overlooks Breakfast Creek.
The Substation No. 41 bar, created in the shell of a derelict electricity sub-
station next door, makes the most of its exposed brick walls and soaring
ceilings.

Simple food, done exceptionally well and with passion. That’s the winning
philosophy behind the food at e’cco, one of Australia’s top restaurants.
Housed in a former tea warehouse, the bistro has large windows, bold
colors, and modern furniture. Dishes include such delights as duck breast
with Peking duck consommé, wombok, broccolini, chilli and ginger; or
grilled white fish with a cassoulet of white beans, clams, mussels, parsley,
and peppers. The price structure is simple — each course’s offerings are
all the same price — and there’s an extensive wine list.

Govinda’s
$
Brisbane City
VEGETARIAN
Vegetarians, travelers on a budget, or those who love cheap and good
food, should seek out the Hare Krishnas’ chain of Govinda restaurants.
This one serves vegetable casserole, samosas, and other tasty stuff with
a north Indian influence. The atmosphere is spartan, but the food is satis-
fying. Don’t expect wine (or tea or coffee) — the only drinks you’re likely
to get will be something like homemade ginger and mint lemonade. On
Sunday nights, the meal comes with lectures and dancing.

Clean, fresh, and simple dishes are the hallmark of this popular restaurant.
After 12 years in operation, it changed ownership in 2007, but Chef Thang

wraparound decks giving sweeping views of the city and Moreton Bay. A
changing menu features local produce teamed with Australian wines. Try
saltwater barramundi (fish) filet. The early-bird special — A$30 (US$24/

relaxed modern bistro incorporates an extensive deli and walk-in cheese

Exploring Brisbane
The top attractions
Lone Pine Koala Sanctuary
Banned in New South Wales and Victoria, koala cuddling is allowed in
Queensland under strict conditions. When it opened in 1927, Lone Pine
had only two koalas, Jack and Jill; it is now home to more than 130. You can
have a photo taken holding one for A$15 (US$12/£6). Lone Pine is also
home to kangaroos and wallabies and lots of other native wildlife includ-
ing emus, snakes, baby crocs, parrots, wombats, Tasmanian devils, skinks,
lace monitors, frogs, bats, turtles, and possums. The nicest way to get to
Lone Pine is a cruise down the Brisbane River aboard M.V. Mirimar 
(% 1300/729 742 in Australia), which leaves the Queensland Cultural
Centre at South Bank Parklands at 10 a.m. The 19km (12-mile) trip to Lone

buses stop at 19 points of interest in a continuous loop around the city
Chapter 16: Brisbane 263

center, Spring Hill, Milton, South Bank, and Fortitude Valley. The driver
gives a commentary, and it’s hop on/hop off as you want.
The tour is a good value as your ticket also gives unlimited access to
buses, ferries, and CityCats for the day, as well as discounts to some
attractions. The bus departs every 45 minutes from 9 a.m. to 3:45 p.m.
daily except Good Friday (Fri before Easter), April 25 (Anzac Day), and
December 25. The whole trip takes 90 minutes. Tickets cost A$22
(US$18/£8.80) adults, A$16 (US$13/£6.40) children 5 to 14. Buy your
ticket on board. You can join anywhere along the route, but the most
central stop is City Hall, stop 2, on Adelaide Street at Albert Street.
Shopping the Local Stores
Brisbane’s major shopping precinct is the Queen Street Mall, which has
around 500 stores. Fronting the mall at 171–209 Queen St., under the
Hilton, is the three-level Wintergarden shopping complex (% 07/3229
9755; www.wgarden.com.au), housing upscale jewelers and Aussie fash-
ion designers.
Farther up the mall at 91 Queen St. (at Albert Street) is the Myer Centre
(% 07/3223 6900), which has Brisbane’s biggest department store and
five levels of moderately priced stores, mostly fashion. The delightful,
atmospheric Brisbane Arcade, 160 Queen St. Mall (% 07/3221 5977),
abounds with the boutiques of Queensland designers. Just down the
mall from it is the Broadway on the Mall arcade (% 07/3229 5233;
www.broadwayonthemall.com.au), which stocks fashion, gifts, and
accessories on two levels. Across from the Edward Street end of the mall
is a new fashion and lifestyle shopping precinct, MacArthur Central 
(% 07/3007 2300; www.macarthurcentral.com), on the block between
Queen and Elizabeth streets. This is where you’ll find designer labels,
Swiss watches, galleries, and accessory shops.
Retro ’50s and ’60s fashion, offbeat stuff like old LPs, secondhand crafts,
fashion by up-and-coming young designers, and all kinds of trash and
treasure are for sale at the Valley Markets, Brunswick Street and China-
town malls, Fortitude Valley (% 07/3854 0860). It’s open Saturday and
Sunday from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m.
On Friday nights, the buzz is outdoors at the South Bank Lifestyle
Markets, Stanley Street Plaza, South Bank Parklands. The market is open
Friday from 5 to 10 p.m., Saturday and Sunday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.
One of the best places in Queensland to find Aboriginal art is the
renowned Fire-Works Gallery, upstairs at 11 Stratton St., Newstead 
(% 07/3216 1250; www.fireworksgallery.com.au). You may blanch
at some of the prices, but this is where you’ll find art by established and
emerging Aboriginal artists from all over Australia. They also ship your
acquisition home for you. Open Tuesday to Friday 11 a.m. to 5 p.m.,
Saturday 11 a.m. to 4 p.m., or by appointment.

Finding out what’s happening
You can find out about festivals, concerts, and events, and book tickets
through Ticketek (% 13 28 49 in Queensland; www.ticketek.com). You
can book in person at Ticketek agencies, the most convenient of which
are on Level E at the Myer Centre, 91 Queen St. Mall, and in the Visitor

ances, art exhibitions, concerts, and events. The free weekly TimeOff,
published on Wednesdays and available in bars and cafes, is a good
guide to live music, as is Thursday’s Courier-Mail newspaper.
Raising the curtain on performing arts and music
Many of Brisbane’s performing arts events are at the Queensland
Performing Arts Centre (QPAC) in the Queensland Cultural Centre. The
city also has a lively theater scene. To find out what’s playing and to
book tickets, contact QTIX (see the preceding section).
Theater
 Queensland Theatre Company (% 07/3010 7600 for information;
www.qldtheatreco.com.au) is the state theater company, offering
eight or nine productions a year, from the classics to new Austra-
lian works. Most performances are at the Playhouse or Cremorne
Theatre at the Queensland Performing Arts Centre (QPAC), South
Bank. Tickets cost from A$26 (US$21/£10) — if you’re under 25 —
to A$68 (US$54/£27).
 Brisbane Powerhouse–Centre for the Live Arts, 119 Lamington St.,
New Farm (% 07/3358 8600; www.brisbanepowerhouse.org), is a
venue for innovative and fringe contemporary works. A former
electricity powerhouse, the massive brick factory is a dynamic
space for exhibitions, contemporary performance, and live art. It’s
a short walk from the New Farm ferry terminal along the riverfront
through New Farm Park.
Chapter 16: Brisbane 265

Checking out the club and pub scene
Brisbane’s many pubs have wide, shady verandas and beer gardens,
which make them a very attractive place to be on a sunny afternoon or
on a steamy summer’s night.
The best known is the Breakfast Creek Hotel, 2 Kingsford Smith Dr.,
Breakfast Creek (% 07/3262 5988). Built in 1889, the hotel is a Brisbane
institution and for many people, a visit to the city isn’t complete without
a steak and beer “off the wood” at the Brekky Creek.
Another landmark is the riverside Regatta Hotel, 543 Coronation Dr.,
Toowong (% 07/3871 9595; www.regattahotel.com.au), with its
pretty iron balconies. Their newish Boatshed restaurant (% 07/3871
9533) is popular but not inexpensive.
In Red Hill, on the city fringe, is the Normanby Hotel, 1 Musgrave Rd.
(% 07/3831 3353; www.thenormanby.com.au), built in 1872 and
recently stylishly revamped. Features are the giant Moreton Bay fig tree
in the beer garden and the biggest outdoor TV screen in town.
One of the most popular nightclub complexes is Friday’s, 123 Eagle St.
(% 07/3832 2122), which overlooks the Brisbane River and is a haunt
for lovely young things. Gather on the large outdoor terrace with its
huge island bar, or head for the restaurant, supper club, or dance floor.
Wednesday through Saturday nights see some kind of happy-hour deal,
cocktail club, or drinks special; the dance action starts pumping around
9 p.m. on Friday and Saturday. Cover charge is A$7 to A$10
(US$5.60–US$8/£2.80–£4).
For greater sophistication, head to Zenbar, on the park level at Post
Office Square, 215 Adelaide St. (% 07/3211 2333), a minimalist bar with
an 8m-high (26-ft.) glass wall overlooking a bamboo garden. There are
about 40 wines by the glass, but in this kind of place you should be
drinking a margarita or martini. The music ranges from ’70s under-
ground jazz and lounge to ultramodern funk house on Friday; on
Saturday, the mood changes to easy background music.
Brisbane’s Treasury Casino, on Queen Street between George and
William streets (% 07/3306 8888), is in a heritage building — once the
state’s Treasury offices — and is open 24 hours. Three levels of 100
gaming tables offer roulette, blackjack, baccarat, craps, sic-bo, and
Aussie two-up. There are over 1,000 slot machines, five restaurants, and
seven bars. Live bands appear nightly in the Livewire Bar. You must be
18 to enter and there’s a dress code (no beachwear or thongs). Closed
Good Friday (Fri before Easter), December 25, and until 1 p.m. on April
25 (Anzac Day).

Cool spots for jazz and blues
At 1 Annie St., Kangaroo Point, almost right under the Story Bridge, 
the Brisbane Jazz Club (% 07/3391 2006; www.brisbanejazzclub.
com.au) is the only Australian jazz club featuring big band dance music
(every Sun night). Watch out for the slightly sloping dance floor — it 
was once a boat ramp! Traditional and mainstream jazz is featured on
Saturday nights. Open Fridays 6:30 to 11:30 p.m., Saturday 7 to 
11:30 p.m., and Sunday 5:30 to 8:30 p.m. On Thursdays from 6:30 to 
9 p.m., there’s a casual jazz appreciation session. Reservations are nec-
essary for some events. The cover is usually A$15 (US$12/£6), higher 
for some guest acts.
Exposed brick walls, wooden booths and a courtyard set the scene for
The Bowery (% 07/3252 0202), an intimate and sophisticated jazz
venue. This atmospheric bar at 676 Ann St., Fortitude Valley, was mod-
eled on Prohibition-era speakeasies. It has live jazz during the week and
on Sunday from around 8 or 8:30 p.m. and DJs on Friday and Saturday
from 9 p.m. Open Tuesday through Sunday 5 p.m. to 3 a.m.

Chapter 17
Queensland and the Best of
the Great Barrier Reef
by Lee Mylne
In This Chapter
 Diving into activities on the Great Barrier Reef
 Settling into Cairns, Port Douglas, and other Reef towns
 Finding the best of the rest of the Reef
 Beaching yourself on the Sunshine Coast and Gold Coast
W
hite sandy beaches fringe the coastline of Queensland, and a
string of tantalizing islands and coral atolls making up one of the
great natural wonders of the world — the Great Barrier Reef — dangles
offshore. In the north, the rain forest teems with flora and fauna. At the
southern end, Gold Coast beaches and theme parks keep tourist hordes
happy. With rain forest hills and village to explore, and a harbor full of
boats waiting to take you to the Reef, the city of Cairns is a good base,
although some prefer the smaller, beachfront village of Port Douglas.
You’ll be tempted by one tropical island after another until you hit the
cluster of 74 that makes up the Whitsundays. The islands are on the
same latitude as Tahiti and, in our opinion, are equally lovely. We also
spend some time on another special island: Heron Island.
North of Brisbane lies the aptly named Sunshine Coast — more white
sandy beaches, crystal-clear waters, and rolling mountains dotted with
villages. Then there’s the Gold Coast with its 35km (22 miles) of rolling
surf and sandy beaches and family-focused theme parks.
Getting to and Around Queensland
By plane
Qantas (% 13 13 13 in Australia; www.qantas.com.au) and its sub-
sidiaries QantasLink and the no-frills Jetstar (% 13 15 38 in Australia;

www.jetstar.com.au) serve most coastal towns from Brisbane, and a
few from Cairns. Virgin Blue (% 13 67 89 in Australia; www.virgin
blue.com.au) services Brisbane, Cairns, Townsville, Mackay,
Proserpine and Hamilton Island in the Whitsundays, Rockhampton,
Hervey Bay, the Gold Coast, and Maroochydore on the Sunshine Coast.
Remember, you can’t fly for 24 hours after scuba diving!
By train
Queensland Rail’s Traveltrain (% 1300/131 722 in Australia; www.
traveltrain.com.au) operates two long-distance trains along the
Brisbane–Cairns route, a 32-hour trip aboard the Sunlander or about 
8 hours less on the high-speed Tilt Train.
By car
The Bruce Highway goes along the coast from Brisbane to Cairns. It’s
mostly a narrow two-lane highway, and the scenery is fairly unexciting.
Tourism Queensland publishes regional motoring guides. All you’re
likely to need, however, is a state map from the Royal Automobile Club
of Queensland (RACQ), 300 St. Pauls Terrace, Fortitude Valley, Brisbane,
QLD 4006 (% 13 19 05 in Australia). In Brisbane, you can get maps and
advice from the RACQ office in the General Post Office (GPO), 261 Queen
St. For recorded road condition reports, call % 1800/629 501. The
Department of Natural Resources (% 07/3896 3216) publishes excel-
lent Sunmaps that highlight tourist attractions, national parks, and so
on, although they’re of limited use as road maps. You can get them at
newsdealers and gas stations throughout the state.
Secrets of the Seasons
Winter (June–Aug) is high season in Queensland. At this time,
Australians think the water is chilly, but its temperature rarely drops
below 22°C (72°F). August through January is peak visibility time for
divers. Summer is hot and sticky across the state. In North Queensland
(Mission Beach, Cairns, and Port Douglas), the monsoonal Wet season is
from November or December through March or April. It brings heavy
rains, high temperatures, extreme humidity, and cyclones. It’s no prob-
lem to visit then, but if the Wet turns you off, consider the beautiful
Whitsundays, which are generally beyond the reach of the rains and the
worst humidity (but not of cyclones).
Discovering the Great Barrier Reef
The Great Barrier Reef is a World Heritage Site and is the biggest marine
park in the world. More than 2,000km (1,240 miles) long, stretching from
Lady Elliot Island off Bundaberg to just south of Papua New Guinea, it is
Part IV: Brisbane, Queensland, and the Great Barrier Reef 
270

home to 1,500 kinds of fish, 400 species of coral, 4,000 kinds of clams
and snails, and countless sponges, starfish, sea urchins, and other forms
of marine life.
Apart from the impressive fish life around the corals, the Reef is home to
numbers of green and loggerhead turtles, one of the biggest dugong
(manatee) populations in the world, sharks, giant manta rays, and sea
snakes. In winter (June–Aug), humpback whales gather in the warm
waters around Hervey Bay and the Whitsunday Islands to calve.
For most people, the Great Barrier Reef means the Outer Reef, the net-
work of platform and ribbon reefs that lie an average of 65km (40 miles)
off the coast (about 60–90 minutes by boat from the mainland). To see
the Reef, you can snorkel, dive, fish, or fly over it. You can also explore
the fringing reef around islands closer to the mainland.
Learning about the Reef before you hit the water
Learning about the Reef before you get there will enhance your visit.
Reef Teach (% 07/4031 7794) is a multimedia presentation by a team of
experienced marine biologists, conservationists, and researchers. You’ll
learn everything you need to know about the Reef, from how it was
formed and how coral grows, to what creatures to avoid and how to take
underwater photos. The presentation takes place throughout the year 
at 14 Spence St., Cairns, Monday through Saturday 6:30 to 8:30 p.m., 
and costs A$13 (US$10/£5.20) adults and A$7 (US$5.60/£2.80) children
under 14.
Townsville is the headquarters of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park
Authority (% 07/4750 0700; fax 07/4772 6093; www.gbrmpa.gov.au or
www.reefhq.com.au) and a visit to Reef HQ (see “The top attractions”
in the “Exploring Townville” section, later in this chapter), is a superb
introduction. The star attraction at this aquarium is a re-created living-
reef ecosystem in a massive viewing tank.
Ways to see the Reef
Snorkeling
Snorkeling the Reef can reveal green and purple clams, pink sponges,
red starfish, purple sea urchins, and fish from electric blue to neon
yellow to lime. The rich colors of the coral only survive with lots of light,
so the nearer the surface, the brighter and richer the marine life. That
means snorkelers see it at its best.
If your Reef cruise offers a guided snorkel tour or “snorkel safari,” take
it. Some include it as part of the price, but even if you pay an extra A$30
(US$24/£12) or so, it’s worth it. Most safaris are suitable for both begin-
ners and advanced snorkelers, and are led by marine biologists who tell
you about the fascinating sea creatures you’re seeing. Snorkeling is easy
to master, and crews on cruise boats are always happy to tutor you.

Scuba diving
A day trip to the Reef also offers a great opportunity to go scuba 
diving — even if you’ve never dived before. Every major cruise boat and
many dedicated dive boats offer introductory dives that allow you to
dive without certification to a depth of 6m (20 ft.) in the company of an
instructor. You’ll need to complete a medical questionnaire and undergo
a 30-minute briefing on the boat.
Intro dives are also called “resort dives.”
Deciding where to base yourself
Cairns and Port Douglas are good places from which to visit the Reef —
but the quality of the coral is just as good off any town along the coast
between Gladstone and Cairns. The Reef is pretty much equidistant from
any point on the coast — about 90 minutes away by high-speed catama-
ran. An exception is Townsville, where the Reef is about two-and-a-half
hours away. The main gateways, north to south, are Port Douglas,
Cairns, Mission Beach, Townsville, the Whitsunday Islands, Gladstone
(for Heron Island), and Bundaberg. The Whitsundays have the added
attractions of islands to sail among; resorts offering a wealth of water-
sports and other activities; and a large array of diving, fishing, and day
cruises. Most important, you can snorkel every day off your island or
join a sailing or cruise day trip to a number of magnificent inner reefs
much nearer than the main Outer Reef. Many people stay in Cairns
simply because of its easy international airport access.
If you’re not a swimmer, choose a reef cruise that visits a coral cay,
because a cay slopes gradually into shallow water and the surrounding
coral. The Low Isles at Port Douglas; Green Island, Michaelmas Cay, or
Upolu Cay off Cairns; Beaver Cay off Mission Beach; and Heron Island
are all good locations.
Making day trips to the Reef
The most common way to get to the Reef is on one of the motorized
catamarans that carry up to 300 passengers each from Cairns, Port
Douglas, Townsville, Mission Beach, and the Whitsunday mainland and
islands. Each of the boats is air-conditioned and has a bar, videos, and
educational material, as well as a marine biologist who gives a talk on
the Reef’s ecology en route. The boats tie up at their own private perma-
nent pontoons anchored to a platform reef. The pontoons have glass-
bottom boats for passengers who don’t want to get wet, dry underwater
viewing platforms, usually a bar, sun decks, shaded seats, and often
showers.
An alternative to traveling on a big tour boat is to go on one of the many
smaller boats. These typically visit two or three Reef sites rather than
just one. There are usually no more than 20 passengers, so you get more
personal attention, and you get to know the other passengers. Another
advantage is that you’ll have the coral pretty much all to yourself. The
Part IV: Brisbane, Queensland, and the Great Barrier Reef 
274

drawbacks of a small boat are that you have only the cramped deck to
sit on when you get out of the water, and your traveling time to the Reef
may be longer. If you’re a nervous snorkeler, you may feel safer on a boat
where you’ll be swimming with 300 other people.
Most day-trip fares include snorkel gear — fins, mask, and snorkel (plus
wet suits in winter, although you rarely need them) — free use of the
underwater viewing chambers and glass-bottom-boat rides, a plentiful
buffet or barbecue lunch, and morning and afternoon refreshments.
Diving is an optional activity for which you pay extra.
The big boats post snorkeling scouts to keep a lookout for anyone in
trouble and to count heads periodically. If you wear glasses, ask whether
your boat offers prescription masks — this could make a big difference
to the quality of your experience! Don’t forget, you can travel as a
snorkel-only passenger on most dive boats, too.
If you get seasick, come prepared with medication. Some boats sell a
ginger-based anti-seasickness pill, but it doesn’t always work!
Major reef sites to visit
From Cairns
About 20 reefs lie within a one-and-a-half- to two-hour boat ride from
Cairns. These are the reefs most commonly visited by snorkelers and
divers on day trips, because they’re so close and so pretty. Some reefs
are small coral “bommies,” or outcrops, that you can swim around in a
matter of minutes, whereas others are miles wide. Some reefs have more
than one good dive site; Norman Reef, for example, has at least four.
 Three of the most popular reefs with both snorkelers and divers
are Hastings, Saxon, and Norman, which are all within a short boat
ride of one another. Each has a wonderful array of coral; big, color-
ful reef fish; schools of pretty rainbow-hued small reef fish; and the
odd giant clam. Green sea turtles and white-tip reef sharks are
common, especially at Saxon, though you won’t necessarily spot
one every day. Divers may see a moray eel and a grouper or two,
barracuda, reef sharks, eagle and blue-spotted rays, and octopus.
Norman is an especially lovely reef with several nice sites. South
Norman has lovely sloping coral shelves. If you’re an experienced
diver and like swim-throughs, the Caves at Norman is a good spot;
it has boulder and plate corals.
 Some of the best diving anywhere on the Great Barrier Reef is on
the Ribbon Reefs on the outer Reef edge, which fringes the conti-
nental shelf off Cairns and Port Douglas. Glorious coral walls, abun-
dant fish, and pinnacles make these a rich, colorful dive area with
lots of variety. The currents can be stronger here, because the reefs
are the last stop between the open sea, so drift dives are a possibil-
ity. The Ribbon Reefs are beyond the reach of day boats, but are
commonly visited by live-aboard boats.
Chapter 17: Queensland 275

 For divers, experts recommend Steve’s Bommie and Dynamite
Pass. Steve’s Bommie is a coral outcrop in 30m (98 ft.) of water,
topped with barracudas, and covered in colorful coral and small
marine life. You can swim through a tunnel here amid crowds of
fish. Dynamite Pass is a channel where barracuda, trevally, grouper,
mackerel, and tuna gather to feed in the current. Black coral trees
and sea whips grow on the walls, patrolled by eagle rays and reef
sharks.
 The most famous dive site in Cairns is Cod Hole, where you can
hand-feed giant potato cod as big as you are, or bigger. The site
also has Maori wrasse, moray eels, and coral trout. Cod Hole is
about 20km (13 miles) off Lizard Island, 240km (149 miles) north of
Cairns, so it isn’t a day trip unless you’re staying at exclusive Lizard
Island. However, it’s a popular stop with just about every live-
aboard vessel, often combined in a trip to the Ribbon Reefs lasting
about four days, or in a trip to the Coral Sea lasting between four
and seven days. Either itinerary makes an excellent dive vacation.
 Divers looking for adventure in far-flung latitudes can visit the Far
Northern region of the Great Barrier Reef, much farther north than
most dive boats venture. Up in this large region you’ll find a wide
choice of good sites, little explored by the average diver. Visibility
is always clear. Silvertip City on Mantis Reef has sharks, pelagics,
potato cod, and beautiful lion fish that patrol a wall up to 46m (150
ft.) deep. Another goodie is the Magic Cave swim-through adorned
with lots of colorful fans, soft corals, and small reef fish. Sleeping
turtles are often spotted in caves on the reefs off Raine Island, the
world’s biggest green turtle rookery. Visibility averages 24m (80 ft.)
at Rainbow Wall, a colorful wall that makes a nice gentle drift dive
with the incoming tide.
 Some 100km to 200km (63–126 miles) east of Cairns, out in the
Coral Sea, isolated mountains covered in reefs rise more than a
kilometer (1⁄2 mile) from the ocean floor to make excellent diving.
Although not within the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, the Coral
Sea is often combined into an extended live-aboard trip that also
takes in Cod Hole and the Ribbon Reefs. The whole trip usually
takes four to seven days. The most popular site is Osprey Reef, a
100-sq.-km (39-sq.-mile) reef with 1,000m (3,300-ft.) drop-offs,
renowned for its year-round visibility of up to 70m (230 ft.). The
highlight of most Osprey Reef itineraries is a shark feeding session.
White-tip reef sharks are common, but the area is also home to gray
reef sharks, silvertips, and hammerheads. Green turtles, tuna, bar-
racuda, potato cod, mantas, and grouper are also common.
 Closer to shore, Cairns has several coral cays and reef-fringed
islands within the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. Less than an
hour from the city, Green Island is a 15-hectare (37-acre) coral cay
with snorkeling equal to that on the Great Barrier Reef. It’s also a
popular diving spot. You can visit it in half a day.
Part IV: Brisbane, Queensland, and the Great Barrier Reef 
276

 The Frankland Islands are a pristine group of uninhabited rain-
forested isles edged with sandy beaches, reefs, and fish 45km (28
miles) south of Cairns. The islands are a rookery for green sea 
turtles, which snorkelers and divers often spot in the water. In
February and March, you may even see dozens of baby turtles
hatching in the sand. Michaelmas Cay and Upolu Cay are two
pretty coral sand blips in the ocean, 30km (19 miles) and 25km (16
miles) off Cairns, surrounded by reefs. Michaelmas is vegetated and
is home to 27,000 seabirds; you may spot dugongs (manatees) off
Upolu.
From Port Douglas
The waters off Port Douglas are just as close to shore and just as color-
ful and varied as those off Cairns.
 Some of the most visited reefs off Port Douglas are Tongue, Opal,
and St. Crispin Reefs.
 The Agincourt complex of reefs also has many excellent dive sites;
experts recommend the double-figure-eight swim-through at the
Three Sisters, where baby gray whale sharks gather, and the coral
walls of Castle Rock, where stingrays often hide in the sand.
Nursery Bommie is a 24m (79-ft.) pinnacle that is a popular haunt
with big fish like barracudas, rays, sharks, and moray eels; under
the big plate corals of Light Reef, giant grouper hide out. Other
popular sites are the staghorn coral garden at the Playground; one
of the region’s biggest swim-throughs at The Maze, where parrot
fish and an enormous Maori wrasse hang out; the Stepping Stones,
home of the exquisitely pretty clownfish (like Nemo!); Turtle
Bommie, where hawksbill turtles are frequently sighted; and
Harry’s Bommie, where divers see the occasional manta ray.
Among the 15-plus dive sites visited by Poseidon (see “From Port
Douglas” section below) are Turtle Bay, where you may meet Killer,
a friendly Maori wrasse; the Cathedrals, a collection of coral pinna-
cles and swim-throughs; and Barracuda Pass, home to coral gar-
dens, giant clams, and schooling barracudas.
 The closest Reef site off Port Douglas, the Low Isles, lies 15km (9
miles) northeast. Coral sand and 22 hectares (55 acres) of coral
surround these two tiny coral cays, which are covered in lush veg-
etation and are home to many seabirds. The coral is not quite as
dazzling as the outer Reef’s, but the fish life is rich, and you may
spot sea turtles. Because you can wade out to the coral right from
the beach, the Low Isles are a good choice for nervous snorkelers.
A half-day or day trip to the Low Isles makes for a more relaxing
day than a visit to outer Reef sites. If you visit the Low Isles, wear
old shoes, because the coral sand can be rough underfoot.
From Mission Beach
Mission Beach is the closest point on the mainland to the Reef, an hour
by boat.
Chapter 17: Queensland 277

The main site visited is Beaver Cay, a sandy coral cay surrounded by
marine life. The waters are shallow, making the cay ideal both for
snorkelers eager to see the coral’s vibrant colors and for novice divers
still getting a feel for the sport.
From Townsville
Townsville’s waters boast hundreds of large patch reefs, some miles
long, and many almost never visited by anyone. Here you can find excel-
lent coral and fish life, including mantas, rays, turtles, and sharks, and
sometimes canyons and swim-throughs in generally good visibility.
 One of the best reef complexes is Flinders Reef, which is in the
Coral Sea, beyond the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park boundaries,
but still included on many dive trips because it has 30m (100-ft.)
visibility, plenty of coral, and big walls and pinnacles with big fish
to match, like whaler shark and barracuda.
 What draws most divers to Townsville, though, is one of Australia’s
best wreck dives, S.S. Yongala. Still largely intact, the sunken
remains of this steamer lie 90km (56 miles) from Townsville, 16km
(10 miles) off the coast, in 15m to 30m (50–98 ft.) of water with visi-
bility of 9m to 18m (30–60 ft.). A cyclone sent the Yongala and its 49
passengers and 72-member crew to the bottom of the sea in 1911.
Today it’s surrounded by a mass of coral and marine life, including
barracuda, enormous grouper, rays, sea snakes, turtles, moray eels,
shark, cod, and reef fish. You can even enter the ship and swim its
length, with care. The boat is usually visited on a live-aboard trip of
at least two days, but some companies run day trips.
The Yongala is not for beginners — the wreck is deep, and there is a
strong current. Most companies require their customers to have
advanced certification or to have logged a minimum of 15 dives
with open-water certification.
From the Whitsundays
Visitors to the Whitsundays have the best of both worlds; they can visit
the outer Reef and enjoy some good dive and snorkel sites in and around
the islands. Many islands have rarely visited fringing reefs, which you
can explore in a rented dinghy. The reef here is just as good as it is off
Cairns, with many drop-offs and drift dives, a dazzling range of corals,
and a rich array of marine life, including whales, mantas, shark, reef fish,
morays, turtles, and pelagics. Visibility is usually around 15m to 23m
(49–75 ft.).
 The Stepping Stones on 800-hectare (1,976-acre) Bait Reef is one of
the most popular sites on the Outer Reef. It is made up of a series
of pinnacles that abound with fish life and offer caverns, swim-
throughs, and channels.
 A family of grouper often greets divers at Grouper Grotto on Net
Reef, and a pod of dolphins hang around Net Reef’s southeast wall.
Part IV: Brisbane, Queensland, and the Great Barrier Reef 
278

 Oublier Reef has plate corals over 2m (7-ft.) wide in its lovely coral
gardens.
 Among the island sites, one of the most popular is Blue Pearl Bay
off Hayman Island, for both snorkeling and diving. It has loads of
corals and some gorgonian fans in its gullies, and heaps of reef fish,
including Maori wrasse and even manta rays. It’s a good place to
make an introductory dive, walking right in off the beach.
 Mantaray Bay on Hook Island is renowned for its range of marine
life, from small reef fish and nudibranches to bigger pelagics far-
ther out. Mantas hang around here in November.
 Another good snorkel and dive spot is Black Reef, commonly
called Bali Hai Island, between Hayman and Hook islands. You’ll
see soft shelf and wall coral; tame Maori wrasse; octopus; turtles;
reef shark; various kinds of rays, including mantas, eagles, and cow-
tails; plus loads of fish. Divers may even see hammerhead shark.
From Bundaberg
The southern reefs of the Great Barrier Reef are just as prolific, varied,
and colorful as the reefs off Cairns. However, because this part of the
coast is less populated, fewer snorkel and dive boats visit them.
 Lady Musgrave Island is one of the Bunker Group of islands and
reefs, which lie approximately 80km (50 miles) due north of
Bundaberg. They are closer to Gladstone, but no boats visit them
from there. Little explored by divers, these vividly colored reefs are
some of the most pristine on the Great Barrier Reef.
 Although it lies outside the borders of the Great Barrier Reef
Marine Park, Bundaberg’s Woongarra Marine Park is a popular
destination. It hugs the town’s coastline, and has loads of soft and
hard corals, nudibranches, wobbegongs, epaulette sharks, sea
snakes, some 60 fish species, and frequent sightings of green and
loggerhead turtles. Most of this is in water less than 9m (30 ft.)
deep, and you can walk right into it off the beach.
Diving the Reef
Divers have a big choice of dive boats that make day trips to the Outer
Reef and live-aboard dive boats making excursions that last up to a week.
On a typical five-hour day trip to the Reef, you’ll fit in about two dives. The
companies listed give you an idea of the kinds of trips available and how
much you’ll be paying. Prices quoted here include full gear rental, but you
can expect to pay about A$20 (US$16/£8) less if you have your own gear.
Many dive companies in Queensland offer dive courses. To take a course,
you’ll need to have a medical exam done by a Queensland doctor. Your
dive school can arrange it, and it costs about A$55 (US$40/£20). You’ll
also need two passport photos for your certificate, and you must be able
to swim!
Chapter 17: Queensland 279

Courses usually begin every day or every week. Some courses take as
little as three days, but five days is generally regarded as the best. Open-
water certification usually requires two days of theory in a pool, fol-
lowed by two or three days out on the Reef, where you make four to nine
dives. Prices vary considerably but are generally around A$600 (US$480/
£240) for a five-day open-water certification course, or A$500 (US$400/
£200) for the same course over four nights.
From Cairns
 Tusa Dive Charters (% 07/4040 6464; www.tusadive.com) runs
two 24m (72-ft.) dive boats daily to two dive sites from a choice of
21 locations on the Outer Reef. The day costs A$190 (US$152/£76)
for divers and A$130 (US$104/£52) adult or A$80 (US$64/£32) child
ages 4 to 14 for snorkelers, with wet suits, guided snorkel tours,
lunch, and transfers from your Cairns or northern beaches hotel.
If you want to be shown the best spots under the water, you can
take a guided dive for an extra A$20 (US$16/£8). Day trips for intro-
ductory divers cost A$195 (US$156/£78) for one dive or A$240
(US$192/£96) for two. The groups are kept to a maximum of 28
people, so you get personal attention. The company is the Nitrox
and Rebreather facility for north Queensland, and certified divers
can take two introductory dives on Nitrox/Safe Air in one day for
A$220 (US$176/£88).
 Deep Sea Divers Den (% 07/4046 7333; fax 07/4031 1210; www.
divers-den.com) runs a five-day open-water diving course that

Staying on the Reef
Down Under Dive (% 1800/079 099 in Australia, or 07/4052 8300; fax 07/4031 1373;
www.downunderdive.com.au) in Cairns offers a chance to “sleep on the Reef”
aboard the (120-ft.) Spirit of Freedom, a modern motor yacht with electronic stabilizers,
TV/DVD, lounge areas, sun decks, and 11 luxury double or quad share cabins, each
with an en suite bathroom. There are three-, four- and seven-day cruises to choose
from.
You’ll visit Cod Hole and Ribbon Reef and, on the four- and seven-day trips, venture
into the Coral Sea. A three-day, three-night trip costs from A$1,100 to A$1,750 (US$880–
US$1,400/£440–£700), depending on your choice of cabin, and ends with a 193km (120-
mile), one-way, low-level flight from Lizard Island back to Cairns. The four-day, four-
night cruise begins with the flight and then cruises from Lizard Island back to Cairns.
It costs between A$1,375 and A$2,100 (US$1,100–US$1,680/£550–£840) and includes
up to 16 dives. A seven-day cruise, priced from A$2,325 to A$3,700 (US$1,860–US$2,960/
£930–£1,480), is a combination of both shorter trips. On a three-day trip, you’ll fit in up
to 11 dives; on the seven-day trip, up to 27. Prices include all meals and pickup from
your Cairns accommodations. Allow around A$100 (US$80/£40) extra for equipment
rental.

involves two days of theory in the pool in Cairns, and three days
and two nights on a live-aboard boat. The course costs A$690
(US$552/£276) per person, including all meals on the boat, nine
dives (one a guided night dive), all your gear, a wet suit, and trans-
fers from your hotel. The same course over four nights, with one
night on the boat and five dives, costs A$555 (US$444/£222). New
courses begin every day.
From Port Douglas
The waters off Port Douglas are home to dramatic coral spires and swim-
throughs at the Cathedrals; giant clams at Barracuda Pass; a village of
parrot fish, anemone fish, unicorn fish, and two moray eels at the soar-
ing pinnacle of Nursery Bommie; fan corals at Split-Bommie; and many
other wonderful sites.
Poseidon (% 1800/085 674 in Australia, or 07/4099 4772; www.poseidon-
cruises.com.au) is a fast 24m (79-ft.) vessel that visits three Outer Reef
sites. The day-trip price of A$155 (US$124/£62) for adults, A$120 (US$96/
£48) for kids 3 to 12, includes snorkel gear, a marine biology talk, snorkel
safaris, lunch, and pickups from Port Douglas hotels. Certified divers
pay A$40 (US$32/£16) extra for two dives or A$55 (US$44/£22) extra for
three, plus A$20 (US$16/£8) gear rental. Guides will accompany you, free
of charge, to show you great locations. Introductory divers pay A$50
(US$40/£20) extra for one dive, and A$40 (US$32/£16) each for the
second and third. The vessel carries no more than 48 passengers, less
than half its capacity, and gets you to the Reef in just over an hour,
giving you five hours on the coral. The boat departs Marina Mirage daily
at 8:30 a.m. Transfers from Cairns and the northern beaches cost an
extra A$15 (US$12/£6) per adult, A$10 (US$8/£4) per child.
From Townsville
Off Townsville, you can dive not only the Reef but also a wreck, the
Yongala, off the coast in 30m (98 ft.) of water with good visibility.
Adrenalin Dive (% 07/4724 0600; www.adrenalindive.com.au) runs
day trips in which you can do two dives on the Yongala. The cost is
A$199 (US$159/£80), plus A$35 (US$28/£14) for gear hire and A$30

adults. The cost includes lunch, snacks, snorkel equipment, and wet suit.
Welcome to Cairns
This part of Queensland is the only place in the world where two World
Heritage–listed sites — the Great Barrier Reef and the Wet Tropics rain
forests — lie side by side. In parts of the far north, the rain forest
touches the Reef, reaching right down to sandy beaches from which you
can snorkel the Reef. Cairns is the gateway to these natural attractions,
as well as man-made tourist destinations such as the Skyrail Rainforest
Cableway. It’s also a steppingstone to islands of the Great Barrier Reef
and the grasslands of the Gulf Savannah.
When international tourism to the Great Barrier Reef boomed, the small
sugar-farming town of Cairns boomed along with it. The town now
boasts outstanding hotels, offshore island resorts, big Reef-cruise cata-
marans in the harbor, and too many souvenir shops. The only beach in
town is a man-made 4,000-sq.-m (43,000-sq.-ft.) saltwater lagoon and arti-
ficial beach on the Esplanade.
The 110-million-year-old rain forest, the Daintree, where plants that are
fossils elsewhere in the world exist in living color, is a couple of hours
north. The Daintree is part of the Wet Tropics, a World Heritage–listed
area that stretches from north of Townsville to south of Cooktown, and
houses half of Australia’s animal and plant species.
If you’re spending more than a day or two in the area, consider basing
yourself on the city’s pretty northern beaches, in Kuranda, or in Port
Douglas (see “Port Douglas, Daintree, and the Cape Tribulation Area,”
later in this chapter). Although prices will be higher in the peak season
(Australian winter and early spring, July–Oct), affordable accommoda-
tions are available year-round.
Getting to Cairns
By plane
Qantas (% 13 13 13 in Australia; www.quantas.com) has direct flights
throughout the day to Cairns from Sydney and Brisbane, and at least one
flight a day from Darwin, Uluru (Ayers Rock), and Perth. From Melbourne
you can sometimes fly direct, but most flights connect through Sydney
or Brisbane. QantasLink flies from Townsville, Hamilton Island in the
Whitsundays, and Alice Springs. Virgin Blue (% 13 67 89 in Australia)
flies to Cairns from Brisbane, Sydney, and Melbourne. Jetstar (% 13 
15 38 in Australia) flies from Brisbane, Sydney, Adelaide, and Melbourne.
Australian Airlines (% 1300/799 798 in Australia) links Cairns with
Sydney, and several international carriers serve Cairns from various
Asian cities and New Zealand.

Getting oriented at the airport
Cairns Airport is 8km (5 miles) north of downtown. The domestic and
international terminals are linked by a covered walkway — it takes about
five minutes to walk between the two.
Getting from the airport to your hotel
Airport Connections (% 07/4099 5950; www.tnqshuttle.com) will
meet all flights at both terminals. Transfers to the city cost A$11
(US$8.80/£4.40) adults and A$5.50 (US$4.40/£2.20) children 4 to 14. It
also runs transfers to as far as Cape Tribulation, Mission Beach, and
Dunk Island.
Sun Palm Express Coaches (% 07/4084 2626; www.sunpalmtransport.
com) provides transfers from the airport to the city and northern
beaches. The one-way fare is A$10 (US$8/£4) adults and A$5 (US$4/£2)
children 2 to 12 to the city, and A$16 (US$13/£6.40) adults and A$8

A taxi from the airport costs around A$15 (US$12/£6) to the city, A$30
(US$24/£12) to Trinity Beach, and A$40 (US$32/£16) to Palm Cove. Call
Black & White Taxis (% 13 10 08 in Australia).
By train
Long-distance trains operated by Traveltrain (% 1300/131 722 in
Queensland; www.traveltrain.com.au) run from Brisbane several
times a week. The 160kmph (100-mph) Tilt Train takes about 25 hours
and costs A$295 (US$236/£118) for business class. Northbound trains
leave Brisbane at 6:25 p.m. on Monday and Friday; southbound runs
depart Cairns at 8:15 a.m. on Wednesday and Sunday. The train features
luxury business-class seating, with an entertainment system for each
seat, including multiple movie and audio channels.
The Sunlander, which runs four times a week between Brisbane and
Cairns, takes 32 hours and costs A$207 (US$166/£83) for a sitting berth,
A$265 (US$212/£106) for an economy-class sleeper, A$409 (US$327/
£166) for a first-class sleeper, or A$725 (US$580/£290) for all-inclusive
Queenslander class (only available twice a week). Trains pull into the
Cairns Central terminal (% 1300/131 722 in Australia for reservations,
or 07/4036 9250 for the terminal) on Bunda Street in the center of town.
By bus
Greyhound Australia (% 13 14 99 in Australia, or 07/4690 9950) buses
pull into Trinity Wharf Centre on Wharf Street in the center of town.
Buses travel from the south via all towns and cities on the Bruce
Highway, and from the west from Alice Springs and Darwin via Tennant
Creek on the Stuart Highway and the Outback mining town of Mount Isa
to Townsville, where they join the Bruce Highway and head north. The
46-hour Sydney–Cairns trip costs A$350 (US$280/£140); the 30-hour trip
Part IV: Brisbane, Queensland, and the Great Barrier Reef 
284

from Brisbane is A$234 (US$187/£94); and from Darwin, the journey
takes about 38 hours and costs A$517 (US$414/£207).
By car
From Brisbane and all major towns in the south, you’ll enter Cairns on
the Bruce Highway. To reach the northern beaches or Port Douglas from
Cairns, take Sheridan Street in the city center, which becomes the
Captain Cook Highway.
Orienting yourself in Cairns
Downtown Cairns is on a grid 5 blocks deep, bounded on the east by the
Esplanade on the water and on the west by McLeod Street, where the
train station and the Cairns Central shopping mall are. In between are
shops, offices, and restaurants. The focal point of the Esplanade is a
4,000-sq.-m (43,000-sq.-ft.) saltwater swimming lagoon with a wide sandy
beach and surrounding parkland with public artworks and picnic areas.
A walkway links the Esplanade to the Reef Fleet Terminal, the departure
point for Great Barrier Reef boats.
Heading 15 minutes north from the city along the Captain Cook Highway,
you come to the northern beaches: Holloway’s Beach, Yorkey’s Knob,
Trinity Beach, Kewarra Beach, Clifton Beach, Palm Cove, and Ellis Beach.
Finding information after you arrive
Tourism Tropical North Queensland’s Gateway Discovery Centre, 51
The Esplanade, Cairns, QLD 4870 (% 07/4051 3588; fax 07/4051 2509;
www.tropicalaustralia.com), has information on Cairns and its envi-
rons, Mission Beach, Port Douglas, the Daintree Rainforest, Cape York,
and Outback Queensland. It’s open daily from 8:30 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. 
(10 a.m.–6 p.m. on public holidays). It’s closed December 25, New Year’s
Day, and Good Friday (the Fri before Easter).
Getting around Cairns
By bus
Sunbus (% 07/4057 7411) buses depart City Place Mall at the intersec-
tion of Lake and Shields streets. Buy all tickets and passes onboard, and
try to have correct change. You can hail buses anywhere it’s convenient
for the driver to stop. Bus nos. 1X, 2, and 2A travel to Trinity Beach and
Palm Cove. The N route is an express bus that runs between the city and
Palm Cove on Friday and Saturday nights only. Routes and timetables
change, so check with the driver. Most buses run from early morning
until almost midnight.
By car
Avis (% 07/4051 5911), Budget (% 07/4051 9222), Hertz (% 07/4051
6399), and Thrifty (% 1300/367 227 in Australia) have offices in Cairns
city and at the airport. One long-established local outfit, Sugarland Car
Chapter 17: Queensland 285

Rentals (% 07/4052 1300), has reasonable rates. Britz Campervan Ren-
tals (% 1800/331 454 in Australia, or 07/4032 2611) and Maui Rentals
(% 1300/363 800 in Australia, or 07/4032 2065) rent motor homes. Britz
and most major car rental companies rent four-wheel-drive vehicles.
Staying in Cairns and the northern beaches
There are loads of options for staying in and around Cairns. The city has
a good supply of affordable accommodations, but you can also stay at
any of the northern beaches, or in the rain forest village of Kuranda, or
get away from it all at an island resort.
Don’t think you have to stay in Cairns if you don’t have a car: Most tour
and cruise operators will pick you up and drop you off in Cairns, or on
the northern beaches, a string of white sandy beaches, which starts 15
minutes north of the city center.
Trinity Beach is secluded, elegant, and scenic. The most upscale is Palm
Cove, where colorful shops and smart apartment blocks nestle among
giant Paperbarks and palms across from a perfect curve of beach.
High season in Cairns includes two weeks at Easter, the period from
early July to early October (when it isn’t so hot), and the Christmas holi-
day through January. Book ahead in those periods. In the off season
(Nov–June), many hotels offer discounts.

Set behind a grove of melaluca trees across the street from the beach, the
rooms and apartments in this resort complex have touches of Queensland
colonial style. Hotel rooms are small but have Jacuzzis and timber outdoor

pools, but there’s no elevator. The large lagoon-style pool has a sandy
beach and swim-up bar. Coconut palms with white-painted trunks sur-
round the lagoon, which is lit by torches at night. A “resort within the
resort,” the Serenity Wing, has 42 suites and a private rain forest pool. The
suites are secluded, with kitchens, gas barbecues, washers and dryers,
and state-of-the-art entertainment units, including DVDs and flat-screen

Drop-dead gorgeous. That’s the only way to describe this period piece

overlook the pool, waterfalls, and lush gardens. They have extra touches
such as bathrobes and CD players, as well as balconies within earshot of
the ocean. The beachfront restaurant, on a large covered wooden deck
beneath towering Paperbarks, is a favorite with locals and tourists alike
for its ocean views, gentle breezes, and unpretentious food.

Exploring Cairns
The top attractions
Hartley’s Crocodile Adventures
Port Douglas
Hartley’s is the original Australian croc show and the best we’ve seen.
What makes it different from others is the natural setting — a 2-hectare (5-
acre) lagoon surrounded by melaluca (Paperbark) and bloodwood trees
and home to 23 estuarine crocs. The best time to visit is for the 3 p.m.
Crocodile Attack Show, when you can witness the crocodile “death roll”
during the 45-minute performance. At 11 a.m. you can see them get hand-
fed or hear an informative talk on the less aggressive freshwater croco-
diles. Tours of the croc farm are at 10 a.m. and 1:30 p.m., a snake show 
is at 2 p.m., and 4:30 p.m. is koala feeding time. Cassowaries are fed at 
9:30 a.m. and 4:15 p.m. Hartley’s is a good place to stop en route to Port
Douglas.

Kuranda Scenic Railway
Cairns/Kuranda
This 34km (21-mile) ride is one of the most scenic rail journeys in the
world. The train snakes through the magnificent vistas of the Barron Gorge
National Park, past gorges and waterfalls on the 90-minute trip to Kuranda.
It rises 328m (1,076 ft.) and goes through 15 tunnels before emerging at
Kuranda station, adorned by ferns in hanging baskets. Built by hand over
5 years in the 1880s, the railway track is a monument to the 1,500 men who
toiled to link the two towns. Most people prefer to do the journey one way
by train and the other by Skyrail. Packages are available.

Skyway Rainforest Cableway
Smithfield
Skyrail is a magnificent feat of engineering. About 114 six-person gondolas
leave every few seconds for the 7.5km (41⁄2-mile) journey to the rain forest
village of Kuranda. The view of the coast is breathtaking. As you rise over
the foothills of the coastal range, the lush green of the rain forest takes
over beneath you, and you’re rewarded with spectacular views over Cairns
and north toward Trinity Bay. There are two stops during the 90-minute
trip. After about 10 minutes, you reach Red Peak, 545m (1,788 ft.) above
sea level, where kauri pines dominate the view. You must change gondo-
las at each station, so take the time to stroll around the boardwalks.
Guided walks start every 20 minutes. The second stop is at Barron Falls
station, built on the site of an old construction camp for workers on the
first hydroelectric power station on the Barron River in the 1930s. There
is a rain forest information center and boardwalks to the lookouts for
views of the Barron Gorge and Falls. From here, the gondola travels over
the rain forest and you can spot ferns and orchids and the blue Ulysses
butterflies. Near the end of the trip, the gondola passes over the Barron
River and across the Kuranda railway line into the station. And don’t worry
if it rains on the day you go — one of the best trips we’ve made on Skyrail
was in a misty rain.

Tjapukai Aboriginal Cultural Park
Smithfield
The Tjapukai (pronounced jab-oo-guy) Aboriginal Cultural Park is one 
of the best chances you have in Queensland to discover the history and
culture of the Aborigines. Perhaps because it was founded by American
theater director Don Freeman and his French-Canadian dancer wife, 
Judy — working with the local Aborigines who now own 51 percent of the
business — Tjapukai is more of a theme park than an authentic cultural
experience. Despite this, the park has won numerous international awards
since it opened 20 years ago, and it’s worth a look. Start in the Creation
Theatre, where performers use illusion, theatrics, and special effects to
tell the story of the creation of the world according to the spiritual beliefs
of Tjapukai people. Actors work with holographic images to illustrate the
legends, and the production is performed in the Tjapukai language, trans-
lated through headsets. Move through the museum and gallery section of
the complex to the theater, where a 20-minute film relates the history of
the Tjapukai people since the coming of white settlers. Outside, there’s a
village where you can try boomerang and spear throwing, fire making and
didgeridoo playing, and learn about bush foods and medicines. Shows and
demonstrations are planned so visitors can move from one to another
easily. Tjapukai by Night tours run daily from 7:30 to 10 p.m. They include
a Creation Show performance, and an outdoor Serpent Circle — an inter-
active show featuring tap sticks, a join-in corroboree (an Aboriginal dance),
and a ceremony involving fire and water. Following are a buffet dinner and
dance show, and the chance to meet the Tjapukai dancers.

More cool things to see and do
 Cairns Wildlife Dome (% 07/4031 7250; www.cairnsdome.com.au)
makes exploring the rain forest and its wildlife as easy as taking 
an elevator to the top of the Sofitel hotel, where 200 animals —
including a huge saltwater crocodile called Goliath — are housed 
in a 20m-high (66-ft.) glass dome on the rooftop. There are also
koalas, lizards, kookaburras, frogs, pademelons, turtles, and
Chapter 17: Queensland 291

snakes. Wildlife presentations and free guided tours are run
throughout the day. Admission is A$22 (US$18/£8.80) adults, A$11
(US$8.80/£4.40) children 4–14, A$55 (US$44/£22) for a family of 4.
Open: Daily 8 a.m.–6 p.m. Closed Dec 25.
 RnR Rafting (% 07/4041 9444) is one of several companies offer-
ing exciting white-water-rafting trips from Cairns on the Class III to
IV Tully River (90 minutes south of Cairns), the Class III Barron
River (in the hills behind the city), and the Class IV to V rapids of
the Johnstone River (inland). The gentler Barron River is a good
choice for the timid, with a half-day trip costing A$98 (US$78/£39)
from Cairns or A$116 (US$93/£46) from Port Douglas, including
pickup from your accommodations and two hours of rafting. Prices
do not include a A$25 (US$20/£10) levy for national park and other
fees. One-day trips on the Tully are the most popular. The trip costs
A$155 (US$124/£62) from Cairns or the northern beaches, including
transfers.
Going Beyond Cairns
A day trip to Kuranda
Getting there
Although undeniably touristy, the mountain village of Kuranda, 34km (21
miles) northwest of Cairns is worth a day trip, if only for the journey
itself. There’s cool mountain air, mist-wrapped rain forest, and a handful
of cafes and restaurants. The town is easy to negotiate on foot; pick up a
visitors’ guide and map at the Skyrail gondola station or train station —
because that’s almost certainly where you’ll arrive.
Getting to Kuranda is part of the fun. Some people drive up the winding
25km (16-mile) mountain road, but the most popular approaches are to
steam up the mountainside in a scenic train, or to glide silently over the
rain forest in the world’s longest gondola cableway, the Skyrail Rainforest
Cableway (see “The top attractions,” earlier this chapter). The most popu-
lar round-trip is one-way on the Skyrail and the other way on the train. A
package combining one-way travel on the Skyrail and a trip back on the
Scenic Railway is A$74 (US$59/£30) adults, A$37 (US$30/£15) children;
with round-trip transfers from Cairns or the northern beaches, it’s A$93
(US$74/£37) adults, A$47 (US$38/£19) kids. Skyrail runs a shuttle bus from
most Cairns hotels. An option including the Skyrail, Scenic Railway, and
Kuranda attraction Rainforestation (see “Seeing the sights,” later in this
section), including transfers from Cairns, is A$148 (US$118/£59) adults,
A$74 (US$59/£30) kids, A$369 (US$295/£148) families of four. All packages
can upgrade to Gold Class service on the train for an extra A$43 (US$34/
£17) per person. Book packages through Skyrail or Queensland Rail.
For those on a budget, Whitecar Coaches (% 07/4091 1855) operates a
bus to Kuranda from Cairns. The fare is A$4 (US$3.20/£1.60) per person.
Catch it at Stop D in the city mall, Cairns.

Taking a rain forest tour
If you want to learn about the rain forest, explore it with a former croco-
dile hunter. Brian Clarke of Kuranda Riverboat Tours (% 07/4093 7476
or 0412/159 212), has lived in the rain forest for more than 30 years.
Brian’s informative 45-minute river cruises depart hourly from 10:30 a.m.
to 2:30 p.m. from the riverside landing across the railway footbridge
near the train station. The cost is A$14 (US$11/£5.60) adults, A$7
(US$5.60/£2.80) children 5 to 15, and A$35 (US$28/£14) families of 
four. Buy your tickets on board.
Seeing the sights
Kuranda is known for its markets — the small “original” markets at 
7 Therwine St., behind Kuranda Market Arcade (open Wed–Fri and Sun 
8 a.m.–3 p.m.), which mainly sell cheap imports, and the 90-stall Heritage
Market (open daily 9 a.m.–3 p.m.), which offers a wider variety of goods
including arts and crafts, fresh produce, boomerangs, T-shirts, and 
jewelry.
Now there’s the New Kuranda Markets, in an undercover complex in
Coondoo St., which has a range of stalls and shops including an
Aboriginal art gallery. About 50 local artisans sell their work in the
Kuranda Arts Co-Operative, Shop 6, 43 Rob Veivers Dr. (% 07/4093
9026), next to the Butterfly Sanctuary. It’s open from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.
daily.
Kuranda has several wildlife attractions:
 At the Australian Butterfly Sanctuary (% 07/4093 7575; www.
australianbutterflies.com), a colorful array of 1,500 tropical
butterflies, including the electric-blue Ulysses and Australia’s
largest species, the Cairns bird wing, flutters in a lush walk-through
enclosure. The butterflies will land on you if you wear pink, red,
and other bright colors. Admission A$15 (US$12/£6) adults, A$7.50
(US$6/£3) children 4 to 15, A$38 (US$30/£15) families of four. Open
daily 9:45 a.m. to 4 p.m. Free guided tours every 15 minutes from 
10 a.m. to 3:15 p.m. Closed December 25.
 Birdworld (% 07/4093 9188), behind the Heritage markets off Rob
Veivers Drive, has eye-catching macaws, a pair of cassowaries, and
Australia’s largest collection of free-flying birds. It’s open daily from
9 a.m. to 4 p.m. (closed Dec 25); admission is A$12 (US$9.60/£4.80)
adults, A$5 (US$4/£2) children 4 to 14, A$29 (US$23/£12) families.
 Kuranda Koala Gardens (% 07/4093 9953; www.koalagardens.
com) is a small wildlife park at the Heritage Markets. You can be
photographed cuddling a koala and see other animals. You can take
a stroll through the snake enclosure, while they slither around your
feet. The Gardens is open daily from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m., and costs
A$15 (US$12/£6) adults and A$7.50 (US$6/£3) children 4 to 15.
Chapter 17: Queensland 293

The Kuranda Koala Gardens is packaged with Birdworld and 
the Australian Butterfly Sanctuary as the Kuranda Wildlife
Experience, and you can buy a pass to all three on arrival at any
one for A$36 (US$29/£14) adults and A$18 (US$14/£7.20) children.
 Rainforestation Nature Park (% 07/4085 5008; www.rainforest.
com.au) is a 40-hectare (99-acre) nature and cultural complex on
the Kennedy Highway, a five-minute drive from the center of
Kuranda. You can take a 45-minute ride into the rain forest in a
World War II amphibious Army Duck, with a commentary on rain
forest flora and fauna. You can also see a performance by
Aboriginal dancers; learn about Aboriginal legends and throw a
boomerang on the Dreamtime Walk; or have your photo taken cud-
dling a koala. You can do any of these activities separately, or do
them all (except cuddle a koala) for one price. Koala photos are
A$12 (US$9.60/£4.80). The Army Duck runs on the hour beginning
at 10 a.m.; the Aboriginal dancers perform at 10:30 a.m., noon, and
2 p.m.; and the 30-minute Dreamtime Walk leaves at 10 a.m., 
11 a.m., 11:30 a.m., 12:30 p.m., 1:30 p.m., and 2:30 p.m. Admission 
is A$36 (US$29/£14) adults, A$18 (US$14/£7.20) kids 4 to 14, A$90
(US$72/£36) families of four. Open daily 8:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. Closed
December 25.
A shuttle runs from the Australian Butterfly Sanctuary, Rob Veivers
Drive, every 30 minutes from 10:45 a.m. to 2:45 p.m. for A$7
(US$5.60/£2.80) adults, A$3.50 (US$2.80/£1.40) children, A$18
(US$14/£7.20) families, round-trip.
Port Douglas, Daintree, and Cape Tribulation
The village of Port Douglas is where the rain forest meets the Reef. Just
over an hour’s drive from Cairns, through rain forest and along the sea,
Port Douglas has stylish shops and seriously trendy restaurants.
Beautiful Four Mile Beach is not to be missed. “Port,” as the locals call it,
is a favorite spot with celebrities big and small — you may find yourself
dining next to anyone from Bill Clinton to Kylie Minogue, Sean Penn to
rock bands or minor soap stars.
The lovely and uncrowded beach, the rural surroundings and limited (so
far) development make this an attractive alternative to staying in Cairns.
And you won’t be out of the action, as many Reef and rain forest tours
originate in Port Douglas, and many tours pick up from Port Douglas as
well as Cairns. Daintree National Park lies just north of Port Douglas, and
just north of that is Cape Tribulation National Park, another wild tract of
rain forest and hilly headlands sweeping down to the sea. Exploring
these two national parks is easy on a four-wheel-drive day safari from
Port Douglas.

Getting to Port Douglas
By car
Port Douglas is a scenic 65-minute drive from Cairns, in part along a
narrow winding road that skirts the coast. Take Sheridan Street north
out of the city as it becomes the Captain Cook Highway; follow the signs
to Mossman and Mareeba until you reach the Port Douglas turnoff.
By bus
A one-way ticket aboard Sun Palm Express Coaches (% 07/4084 2626)
to Port Douglas hotels is A$30 (US$24/£12) from the Cairns airport. Fares
for children 2 to 12 are half-price. If you’re staying in Cairns but taking a
Quicksilver (% 07/4087 2100) cruise to the Great Barrier Reef for the
day, you can take a bus transfer to Port Douglas for A$16 (US$13/£6.40)
adults, half-price for kids.
By taxi
A taxi from Cairns runs around A$100 (US$80/£40); call Black & White
Taxis (% 13 10 08 in Cairns).
Finding information after you arrive
The best sources of information in Port Douglas are the private tour
information and booking centers. One of the biggest and most centrally
located is the Port Douglas Tourist Information Centre, 23 Macrossan
St. (% 07/4099 5599), open from 7:30 a.m. to 6 p.m. daily. There is no
official visitor information office in town.
Getting around Port Douglas
A good way to get around the town’s flat streets is by bike. Holiday Bike
Hire, 40 Macrossan St. (% 07/4099 6144), is open daily from 8 a.m. to 
6 p.m. or later and rents a large range of good mountain bikes; prices
start at A$11 (US$8.80/£4.40) for a half-day, A$17 (US$14/£6.80) for a full
day. Port Douglas Bike Hire, at Warner and Wharf streets (% 07/4099
5799), rents bikes for A$10 (US$8/£4) for a half-day, A$14 (US$11/£5.60)
for a full day. It’s open 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily.
If you feel like you need a car to get around, Avis (% 07/4099 4331),
Budget (% 07/4099 5702), and Thrifty (% 07/4069 9977) have offices in
Port Douglas. A good local company is Port Douglas Car Rental (% 07/
4099 4988). All rent regular vehicles as well as four-wheel-drives, which
you need if you plan to drive to Cape Tribulation.
For a taxi, call Port Douglas Taxis (% 07/4084 2650).

Port Douglas
You won’t find a friendlier or more convenient place to stay in Port Douglas
than these 21 apartments, across from the beach and less than a ten-
minute walk from town. Hosts Wolfgang Klein and Christel Bader are eager
to help with tour bookings and to give advice — and they also speak fluent
German, conversational French, and some Spanish. The apartments are
on the small side (most suit only three people, at the most), but are well
cared for. You can opt for a tiny Garden apartment with a patio; Balcony
and Seaview apartments are larger and have private balconies. A saltwater
pool is on-site. General housekeeping services cost A$20 (US$16/£8) extra.

timber and bamboo furniture, and tiled bathrooms with robes. Five have
Jacuzzis on their screened balconies. You can join a yoga or Ki-Aikido
(based on Japanese aikido) session, laze by the solar-heated pool, follow
rain forest trails, join members of the local Aboriginal Kuku tribe on a bush
tucker and native medicine walk, or take a four-wheel-drive day trip to
modern-day Aboriginal communities. The Julaymba Restaurant overlooks
a lily pond and serves food with a gourmet bush-tucker slant. The lodge is

Shannonvale
John and Pam Burden’s stunning timber home, on a hillside 15km (91⁄2
miles) north of Port Douglas, is a restful luxurious retreat. The three rustic-
meets-sleek contemporary bedrooms have mosquito nets and smart linens
on king-size beds, and elegant bathrooms. The garden room opens onto a
plunge pool overlooking the valley, and there is also a lap pool. Wallabies
and bandicoots feed in the garden, kingfishers and honeyeaters use the
pools, and butterflies are everywhere. A delicious tropical breakfast is
served on the west deck in the company of a flock of red-browed finches
and doves, and the rain forest trails of Mossman Gorge are just a few miles
away. Children under 13 not accepted.

Port Douglas Retreat

Port Douglas
This well-kept Queenslander-style studio-apartment complex is a good
value. Some of the ritzier places in town don’t boast its lagoonlike salt-
water pool, surrounded by dense jungle and wrapped by a shady sun deck.
The apartments are not enormous, but they’re fashionably furnished, with
terra-cotta tile floors, wrought-iron beds, cane seating, and colorful bed-
covers. All have large balconies or patios looking into tropical gardens;
some on the ground floor open onto the common-area boardwalk, so you
may want to ask for a second-story unit for a bit more privacy. The town
and beach are a five-minute walk away.

Sheraton Mirage
$$$$$
Port Douglas
This large low-rise resort has 2 hectares (5 acres) of saltwater pools and
a championship Peter Thomson–designed 18-hole golf course. It is a bit
too far from Port’s main street by foot, but a free shuttle runs from 9 a.m.
to 6 p.m. to the country club and health center, to Marina Mirage shop-
ping center, and into town. All rooms are large and light-filled, and have
excellent extras like mini stereo systems, PlayStations, and Internet access.
You may want to upgrade to a Mirage room with a corner Jacuzzi and king-
size beds, but we think the standard rooms are fine. The Sheraton also han-
dles rental of 101 privately owned two-, three-, and four-bedroom luxury
villas with golf course, garden, or sea views; the décor varies, but each has
a kitchenette, a Jacuzzi, and two bathrooms.

Silky Oaks Lodge & Healing Waters Spa
$$$$$
Mossman
From the veranda of your room, you will hear the gushing waters of the
Mossman River. Stroll down for a swim (there are no crocs) or admire it
from afar. Despite its popularity, this luxury resort at the edge of cane
fields exudes a restful feeling. Treehouses are scattered through the 
rain forest and gardens, each in its own private part of the gardens and
rain forest; the five Riverhouses overlook the river frontage, and all have
Jacuzzis. Each of the 50 units has timber floors, attractive furnishings, a
king-size bed, bathrobes, a CD player — but no TV — and a double ham-
mock. Make sure you head to the Healing Waters Day Spa (book ahead,
it’s popular). Rates include guided nature walks, tennis, mountain bikes,
and kayaking or snorkeling in the Mossman River, and there is a daily activ-
ities program. Children under 15 not accepted.

Thala Beach Lodge
$$$$$
Port Douglas
This luxury hideaway in the rain forest will delight you from the moment
you arrive in the open-air lobby. From the elevated restaurant, the impact
is even greater, with views from the Daintree to Cape Grafton, south of
Cairns. Thala (pronounced ta-la) Beach is on a 59-hectare (146-acre) pri-
vate peninsula, bordered on three sides by private beaches and coves.
When designing it, owners Rob and Oonagh Prettejohn took their inspira-
tion from the flora and fauna of the World Heritage area that surrounds it.
The 85 secluded bungalows are spacious and comfortable, with timber-
paneled walls and your choice of king-size or twin beds. All are built on
high poles in the trees, where lorikeets and red-faced flying foxes feed on
blossoms and hang from the branches. The 16 Coral Sea bungalows over-
look the ocean; the rest have forest and mountain views. Some of the bun-
galows are a bit of a walk from the public areas and swimming pools, but
it’s a small price to pay for the privacy and the rain forest setting.

Getting to the Reef from Port Douglas
The most glamorous large vessels visiting the Outer Reef are the ultra-
sleek Quicksilver Wavepiercers (% 07/4087 2100). These high-speed,
air-conditioned 37m (121-ft.) and 46m (151-ft.) catamarans carry 300 or
440 passengers, respectively, from Port Douglas to Agincourt Reef, 39
nautical miles (72km/45 miles) from shore on the outer edge of the Reef.
After the 90-minute trip, you tie up at a two-story pontoon, where you
spend three-and-a-half hours.
Quicksilver departs Marina Mirage at 10 a.m. daily except December 25.
The cost for the day is A$186 (US$149/£74) adults, A$93 (US$74/£37) kids
4 to 14. Guided snorkel safaris cost A$58 (US$46/£23) per person, and
introductory dives cost A$134 (US$107/£54) per person. Qualified divers
can make one dive for A$92 (US$74/£37) or two dives for A$134 (US$107/
£54) per person, all gear included. Because Quicksilver carries so many
passengers, it pays to book snorkel safaris and dives in advance.
The dive boat Poseidon welcomes snorkelers. You’ll hear a Reef ecology
talk en route and a guided snorkel safari is included. The price of A$155
(US$124/£62) for adults and A$120 (US$96/£48) for children 3 to 12
includes lunch and transfers from Port Douglas hotels.
Chapter 17: Queensland 301

Snorkeling specialist boat Wavelength (% 07/4099 5031; www.
wavelength.com.au) does a full-day trip to the Outer Reef for A$160
(US$128/£64) for adults, A$110 (US$88/£44) for children 2 to 12, A$485
(US$388/£194) for a family of four. The trip visits three different snorkel
sites and incorporates a guided snorkel tour and a reef presentation by a
marine biologist. It carries up to 30 passengers and includes snorkel
gear, sunsuits, lunch, and transfers from your hotel. It departs daily at
8:15 a.m. from the Wavelength jetty, Wharf Street.
Another way to spend a pleasant day on the Great Barrier Reef, closer 
to shore, is to visit the Low Isles, 15km (91⁄2 miles) northeast of Port
Douglas. The isles are 1.5-hectare (33⁄4-acre) coral-cay specks of lush veg-
etation surrounded by white sand and 22 hectares (54 acres) of coral —
which is what makes them so appealing.
The trip aboard the 30m (98-ft.) luxury sailing catamaran Wavedancer
(% 07/4087 2100), operated by Quicksilver, is A$132 (US$106/£53)
adults, A$66 (US$53/£26) kids 4 to 14, A$330 (US$264/£132) families. You
have the option of making an introductory scuba dive for an extra A$112
(US$90/£45) per person. Coach transfers are available through Quick-
silver from Cairns and Palm Cove for A$16 (US$13/£6.40) adults, half-
price for children.
Discovering the national parks
The Daintree and Cape Tribulation rain forests are two separate national
parks, but the forests merge into one. The World Heritage–listed Daintree
Rainforest, largely unchanged over the past 110 million years, is home
to rare plants that provide key links in the evolution story. In the 56,000-
hectare (138,320-acre) Daintree National Park, you’ll find cycads,
dinosaur trees, fan palms, giant strangler figs, and epiphytes like the
basket fern, staghorn, and elkhorn. Nighttime croc-spotting tours on the
Daintree River vie for popularity with early-morning cruises to see the
rich bird life. Pythons, lizards, frogs, and electric-blue Ulysses butterflies
attract photographers, and sport fishermen come here in pursuit of 
barramundi.
The best way to learn the most about the rain forest is to take a guided,
four-wheel-drive day trip. Most tour operators in the area cover the
same basic territory and sights, including a one-hour Daintree River
cruise to spot crocs, a visit to the Marrdja Botanical Walk, a stroll along
an isolated beach, lunch in the forest, and a visit to Mossman Gorge.
Some also go to Bloomfield Falls in Cape Tribulation National Park.
Expect to pay about A$140 (US$112/£56) per adult and about A$95
(US$76/£38) per child. Trips that include Bloomfield Falls cost more.
A company that provides an excellent, gently adventurous alternative is
Pete Baxendell’s Heritage & Interpretive Tours (% 07/4098 7897;
www.nqhit.com.au). On a daylong bushwalk into a tract of privately
owned rain forest with Pete, a naturalist and professional tour guide,
you taste green ants (not nasty at all!) and other native “bush tucker,”
Part IV: Brisbane, Queensland, and the Great Barrier Reef 
302

discover how to rustle up a toothbrush from a shrub, learn about bush
medicine and the wildlife around you, and clamber up a stream to a
waterfall. Pete takes a maximum of six people at a time. Lunch and Port
Douglas pickups are included in the price of A$130 (US$104/£52) per
person. Pickups from Cairns and the northern beaches can be organized
through BTS Tours (% 07/4099 5665) for an extra cost. Walks run
Tuesday and Saturday, leaving Port at 8:30 a.m. You can charter Pete and
his four-wheel-drive on other days for day bushwalks for A$185 (US$148/
£74) per person (minimum of two). A longer “go anywhere” adventure
costs A$650 (US$520/£260) per day, including Cairns and northern
beaches pickups. The charter prices compare favorably to a regular
Daintree four-wheel-drive tour if there are three or more of you — and you
get a tailored itinerary, Pete’s knowledge, and the vehicle all to yourself.
He often takes charter customers inland to Outback gold mining ghost
towns, or north to tiny Cooktown, which boasts an excellent museum
devoted to Australia’s “discoverer,” Captain James Cook. If you have two
days, he can take you farther west to see Aboriginal rock art and stay at a
permanent safari camp, or to the amazing Undara Lava Tubes.
Other established operators are Trek North Safaris (% 07/4033 2600)
and BTS Tours (% 07/4099 5665). As is the case in most tourist hot
spots, some tour operators battle fiercely to pay tour desks the highest
commission to recommend their tours, even though those tours may not
necessarily be the best for your needs. Take tour desks’ recommenda-
tions with a grain of salt, and ask other travelers for their recommenda-
tions. You may not see too much wildlife — rain forest animals are shy,
camouflaged, nocturnal, or all three! Most four-wheel-drive tours will
pick you up in Port Douglas at no charge; there is usually a fee from
Cairns and the northern beaches. Floods and swollen creeks can quash
your plans to explore the Daintree in the Wet season (Dec–Mar or Apr),
so keep your plans flexible.
If your chosen safari does not visit Mossman Gorge, 21km (13 miles)
northwest of Port Douglas near the sugar town of Mossman, try to get
there under your own steam. The river tumbling over boulders, and the
short forest walks are magical. Don’t climb on the rocks or enter the
river, because strong currents are extremely dangerous and have
claimed at least one life in recent years.
More cool things to see and do
 Dan Irby’s Mangrove Adventures (% 07/4090 7017; www.
mangroveadventures.com.au) will take you out on the Daintree
River in a small open boat, which can get up intriguing side creeks
the bigger boats can’t. Originally from Tonkawa, Oklahoma, Dan
has been in Australia for 35 years and is extremely knowledgeable
about the wildlife and habitat. He takes no more than ten people at
a time on two- to four-hour cruises. Making advance reservations
with Dan (at least 24 hours ahead, if possible) is very important. A
two-hour trip costs A$45 (US$36/£18). The early morning sunrise
tours and night tours leave from Daintree Eco Lodge, 20 Mossman
Chapter 17: Queensland 303

Daintree Rd., 4km (21⁄2 miles) south of Daintree village; day tours
leave from the public jetty next to the Daintree River ferry crossing.
You can combine both, taking an afternoon tour, followed by a 45-
minute break for a snack at Daintree Eco Lodge, and then the night
tour. Chances are, you’ll spot lots of fascinating wildlife on his two-
hour night cruise, but even if you don’t, it’s worth it just to see the
stars.
Take the Captain Cook Highway north to Mossman, where it
becomes the Mossman Daintree Road, and follow it for 24km (15
miles) to the signposted turnoff for the ferry on your right. The
ferry is 5km (3 miles) from the turnoff. You’ll need a car to get
there; transfers are not available.
 Fine Feather Tours (% 07/4094 1199; www.finefeathertours.
com.au) has a full-day bird-watching safari through the Daintree
and Cape Tribulation national parks to the edge of the Outback for
A$225 (US$180/£90). It also offers an afternoon cruise on the
Daintree River for A$165 (US$132/£66) and other tours.
 KuKu-Yalanji Dreamtime Walks (% 07/4098 2595; www.yalanji.
com.au) offers a guided walk by members of the native KuKu-
Yalanji tribe through the rain forest to see cave paintings and visit
“special sites”; the tour is followed by a dreamtime story and
didgeridoo performance over billy tea and damper in a bark warun
(shelter). Walks run for 90 minutes and leave Monday through
Friday at 9 a.m., 11 a.m., 1 p.m. and 3 p.m. from the KuKu-Yalanji
community, on the road to Mossman Gorge (1km/1⁄2 mile before you
reach the gorge parking lot). Tours cost A$25 (US$20/£10) adults,
A$15 (US$12/£6) children under 12, A$65 (US$52/£26) families of
four.
 Extra Action Water Sports (% 07/4099 3175) offers parasailing,
jet-skiing, and tube rides on Four Mile Beach, Port Douglas. A half-
hour on a jet ski or parafly costs A$70 (US$56/£28) solo, A$90
(US$72/£36) tandem. The booking office is at the end of the jetty on
the Port Douglas slipway.
Mission Beach and Islands
For years, the lovely coastal town of Mission Beach, between Cairns and
Townsville, was a well-kept secret. Today, it’s a small, prosperous, pretty
rain forest town with one of Australia’s most beautiful beaches, a long
white strip fringed with the only surviving lowlands rain forest in the
Australian tropics. It’s also one of the least crowded and least spoiled.
Tucked away off the Bruce Highway, 140km (87 miles) south of Cairns,
Mission Beach is on what’s called the Cassowary Coast. Signs on the way
into town warn you to watch out for cassowaries emerging from the
bush to cross the road. Dense rain forest hides the town from view until
you round a corner and discover appealing hotels, neat shops, and
Part IV: Brisbane, Queensland, and the Great Barrier Reef 
304

smart little restaurants. Mission Beach is actually a conglomeration of
four beachfront towns: South Mission Beach, Wongaling Beach, Mission
Beach proper, and Bingil Bay. Most activity centers on the small nucleus
of shops and businesses at Mission Beach proper.
The nearby Tully River is white-water-rafting heaven for thrill-seekers,
who can also bungee-jump and tandem sky-dive if the mood takes them.
From Mission Beach it’s a short ferry ride to Dunk Island, a large resort
island that welcomes day-trippers (or you can get there by sea kayak
from the mainland, if you’re feeling energetic). Mission Beach is closer to
the Great Barrier Reef than any other point along the coast — just an
hour — and cruise boats depart daily from the jetty, stopping en route at
Dunk Island.
Getting to Mission Beach
By car
From Cairns, follow the Bruce Highway south. The Mission Beach turnoff
is at the tiny town of El Arish, about 15km (91⁄2 miles) north of Tully.
Mission Beach is 25km (16 miles) off the highway. It’s a 90-minute trip
from Cairns. If you’re coming from Townsville, a turnoff just north of
Tully leads 18km (11 miles) to South Mission Beach.
By bus
Mission Beach Connections (% 07/4059 2709) operates door-to-door
shuttles three times a day from Cairns and Cairns Airport for A$38
(US$30/£15) adults and A$19 (US$15/£7.60) children, and from the north-
ern beaches for A$49 (US$39/£20) adults and A$25 (US$20/£10) children.
Greyhound Australia (% 13 14 99 in Australia) coaches stop in Mission
Beach proper (not South Mission Beach) several times daily. The fare is
A$29 (US$23/£12) from Cairns, A$227 (US$182/£91) for the 26-hour-plus
trip from Brisbane.
By train
Five trains a week on the Cairns–Brisbane–Cairns route serve the near-
est station, Tully, about 20km (13 miles) away. One-way travel from
Cairns on the Tilt Train costs A$46 (US$37/£18) for the just-under-three-
hour journey. From Brisbane, fares range from A$179 (US$143/£72) in an
economy seat to A$367 (US$294/£147) for a first-class sleeper on the
Sunlander or A$661 (US$529/£264) for Queenslander class. For more
information, call Queensland Rail’s long-distance division, Traveltrain

Exploring the Reef and rain forest from Mission Beach
Mission Beach is the closest point on the mainland to the Reef, just one
hour by the high-speed Quick Cat Cruises catamaran (% 07/4068 7289).
The trip starts with an hour at Dunk Island, 20 minutes offshore, where
Part IV: Brisbane, Queensland, and the Great Barrier Reef 
306

you can walk rain forest trails, play on the beach, or parasail or jet-ski
for an extra fee. Then it’s a one-hour trip to sandy Beaver Cay on the
Outer Reef, where you have three hours to snorkel or to check out the
coral from a glass-bottom boat.
There’s no shade on the cay, so come prepared with a hat and sunscreen.
The trip departs daily from Clump Point Jetty at 9:30 a.m. It costs A$144
(US$115/£58) adults, A$72 (US$58/£29) children 4 to 14. An introductory
scuba dive costs A$80 (US$64/£32) for the first dive, A$35 (US$28/£14)
for the second. Be sure to prebook your introductory scuba dive to
ensure a place. Qualified divers pay A$60 (US$48/£24) for the first dive,
A$35 (US$28/£14) for the second, with all gear included for both dives.
Free pickups from Mission Beach are included. You can also join this trip
from Cairns; coach connections from your Cairns or northern beaches
hotel will cost extra.
Hiking trails abound through national parks, in rain forests, through fan
palm groves, and along the beach. The 8km (5-mile) Licuala Fan Palm
track starts at the parking lot on the Mission Beach–Tully Road about
1.5km (1 mile) west of the turnoff to South Mission Beach. The track
leads through dense forest and over creeks, and comes out on the El
Arish–Mission Beach Road about 7km (41⁄2 miles) north of the post office.
Then you can cross the road and keep going on the 1km (2⁄3-mile) Lacey
Creek loop in the Tam O’Shanter State Forest. A shorter Rainforest
Circuit option leads from the parking lot at the start of the Licuala Fan
Palm track and makes a 1km (2⁄3-mile) loop incorporating a fan palm
boardwalk. There’s also a ten-minute fun children’s walk, which starts in
the parking lot and follows “cassowary footprints.”
For a walk with ocean views, take the 7km (41⁄2-mile) Edmund Kennedy
track, which starts below the Horizon resort at the southern end of the
Kennedy Esplanade in South Mission Beach. You get views of the sea and
the rain forest on this trail. The Mission Beach Visitor Centre has free

Coral Sea Kayaking (% 07/4068 9154 or 0419/782 453; www.coralsea
kayaking.com) offers a range of sea-kayaking expeditions that interpret
the rich environment around you. Groups are usually between five and
eight people, so you get personal attention and time to ask questions.
The half-day sea-kayak trip (A$60/US$48/£24 per person) follows the
coast near South Mission Beach. Between mid-May and mid-November,
owners David Tofler and Atalanta Willy also run a three-day sea-kayak
camping trip to the nearby Family Islands. This costs A$570 (US$456/
£228), including pickup from your accommodations, all meals, and
equipment including snorkeling gear. Extended five- and seven-day pad-
dles are also available.

Townsville and More Islands
Townsville, 346km (215 miles) south of Cairns, is Australia’s largest 
tropical city. Because of its size, and an economy based on mining, manu-
facturing, education, and tourism, it is often — unjustly, we think — 
discounted as a good holiday destination. The people are friendly, the
city is pleasant, and there’s plenty to do. The town sits by the sea below
the pink face of Castle Rock, which looms 300m (1,000 ft.) directly above.
Townsville’s major attraction is the world-class Museum of Tropical
Queensland, where a full-size replica of H.M.S. Pandora is the center-
piece. Next door is the Reef HQ aquarium.
The Great Barrier Reef is about two-and-a-half hours away, and just 8km
(5 miles) offshore is Magnetic Island, a popular place for watersports,
hiking, and spotting koalas in the wild.
Getting to Townsville
By plane
Qantas (% 13 13 13 in Australia; www.qantas.com.au) flies direct from
Brisbane. QantasLink flies from Cairns, Brisbane, Hamilton Island in the

Abacus Charters & Tours (% 07/4775 5544) runs a door-to-door air-
port shuttle. It meets all flights from Brisbane, and from Cairns or else-
where if you book in advance. A trip into town is A$8 (US$6.40/£3.20)
one-way. A taxi from the airport to most central hotels costs about A$15
(US$12/£6).

Beach and four-and-a-half hours south of Cairns. The Bruce Highway
breaks temporarily in the city. From the south, take Bruce Highway
Alternate 1 route into the city. From the north, the highway leads into
the city. The drive from Cairns to Townsville through sugar-cane fields,
cloud-topped hills, and lush bushland is a pretty one — one of the most
picturesque stretches in Queensland.

Exploring Townsville
The top attractions
Museum of Tropical Queensland
With a stunning curved roof, like a ship in full sail, this A$22-million
(US$17.6-million/£8.8-million) museum, is easy to spot. The centerpiece of
the museum is the exhibition of relics salvaged from the wreck of H.M.S.
Pandora, which lies 33m (108 ft.) underwater on the edge of the Great
Barrier Reef, 120km (74 miles) east of Cape York. The exhibit includes a
full-scale replica of a section of Pandora’s bow and her 17m-high (56-ft.)
foremast. Standing three stories high, the replica and its copper-clad keel
were crafted by local shipwrights. Pandora sank in 1791, but the wreck was
not discovered until 1977. The exhibition traces the ship’s voyage and the
retrieval of the sunken treasure. The museum has six galleries, including
a hands-on science center, and a natural history display that looks at life
in tropical Queensland — above and below the water. Another is dedicated
to north Queensland’s indigenous heritage, with items from Torres Strait
and the South Sea Islands as well as stories from people of different cul-
tures about the settlement and labor of north Queensland. Exhibitions
change every three months.

Reef HQ
Reef HQ is the largest living coral reef aquarium in the world. The high-
light of your visit may be walking through a 20m-long (66-ft.) transparent
tunnel, gazing into a giant predator tank where sharks cruise silently. The
wreck of S.S. Yongala provides an eerie backdrop for blacktip and whitetip
reef sharks, leopard sharks, and nurse sharks, sharing their 750,000-liter
(195,000-gallon) home with stingrays, trevally, and a green turtle. Watching
them feed is quite a spectacle. The tunnel also reveals the 2.5-million-liter
(650,000-gallon) coral reef exhibit, with its hard and soft corals providing
a home for thousands of fish, giant clams, sea cucumbers, sea stars, and

other creatures. Other highlights include the shark-feeding scuba-dive
show, a marine creature touch tank, a wild sea-turtle rehabilitation center,
plus interactive activities. Reef HQ is an easy walk from the city center.

More cool things to see and do
The Strand is a 2.5km (11⁄2-mile) strip where you can stroll along the
promenade or relax at one of the many cafes, restaurants, and bars
while you gaze across the Coral Sea to Magnetic Island. There are safe
swimming beaches, a fitness circuit, a water park for kids, and plenty of
picnic areas and free gas barbecues, as well as areas to in-line skate,
cycle, walk, or fish. Four rocky headlands and a jetty adjacent to Strand
Park provide good fishing spots, and there are two surf lifesaving clubs
to service the three swimming areas. During summer (Nov–Mar), three
swimming enclosures operate to keep swimmers safe from marine
stingers. If watersports are on your agenda, try a jet ski, hire a canoe, or
take to the latest in pedal skis.
The Whitsundays
A day’s drive or a one-hour flight south of Cairns brings you to the daz-
zling collection of 74 islands known as the Whitsundays. No more than 
3 nautical miles (5.6km/31⁄2 miles) separate most of the islands, and alto-
gether they represent countless bays, beaches, dazzling coral reefs, and
fishing spots that make up one fabulous Great Barrier Reef playground.
Sharing the same latitude as Rio de Janeiro and Hawaii, the water is at
least 72°F (22°C) year-round, the sun shines most of the year, and in
winter you’ll require only a light jacket at night.
All the islands consist of rainforested national park land, mostly unin-
habited. The surrounding waters belong to the Great Barrier Reef Marine
Park. Don’t expect palm trees and coconuts — these islands are covered
with pine and eucalyptus forests full of dense undergrowth, and rocky
coral coves far outnumber the sandy beaches. More than half a dozen
islands have resorts that offer just about all the activities you could ever
want — snorkeling, scuba diving, sailing, reef fishing, water-skiing, jet-
skiing, parasailing, sea kayaking, hiking, rides over the coral in semi-
submersibles, fish feeding, putt-putting around in dinghies to secluded
beaches, playing tennis or squash, and taking aqua-aerobics classes.
Accommodations range from small, low-key wilderness retreats to
midrange family havens to Australia’s most luxurious resort, Hayman.
The village of Airlie Beach is the center of the action on the mainland.
The town is only a few blocks long, but you’ll find a good choice of
accommodations, some good restaurants and bars, a boutique or two,

Chapter 17: Queensland 313

banks, and a supermarket. Airlie Beach has a massive beachfront artifi-
cial lagoon, with sandy beaches and landscaped parkland, which solves
the problem of where to swim in stinger season. The lagoon is the size of
about six full-size Olympic swimming pools, set in 4 hectares (10 acres)
of botanic gardens, with a children’s pool, plenty of shade, barbecues,
picnic shelters, toilets, showers, and parking.
The Whitsundays are just as good a steppingstone to the outer Great
Barrier Reef as Cairns, and some people consider them better, because
you don’t have to make the 90-minute trip to the Reef before you hit
coral. Just about any Whitsunday island has fringing reef around its
shores, and there are good snorkeling reefs between the islands, a quick
boat ride away from your island or mainland accommodations. Cruises
and yachts depart from Shute Harbour, a ten-minute drive south on
Shute Harbour Road, and Abel Point Marina, a ten-minute walk west
along the foreshore or a quick drive over the hill on Shute Harbour
Road.
Although they haven’t been sighted at Airlie Beach for several years,
deadly marine stingers may frequent the shorelines from October
through April. The best place to swim is in the beachfront Airlie Beach
lagoon. The rivers in these parts are home to dangerous saltwater croco-
diles (which mostly live in fresh water, contrary to their name), so don’t
swim in streams, rivers, and water holes.
Getting to the Whitsunday region
By plane
There are two air routes into the Whitsundays: Hamilton Island Airport,
and Whitsunday Coast Airport at Proserpine on the mainland. Qantas-
Link (% 13 13 13 in Australia) flies direct to Hamilton Island from
Cairns and Townsville. Virgin Blue (% 13 67 89 in Australia) flies to
Proserpine direct from Brisbane and Sydney, and with connections from
Canberra, Melbourne, Adelaide, Perth, Hobart, and Launceston, and
direct from Brisbane to Hamilton Island. Jetstar (% 13 15 38 in
Australia) flies from Brisbane and Sydney to Proserpine and from
Adelaide, Brisbane, Melbourne, and Sydney to Hamilton Island. If you
stay on an island, the resort may book your launch transfers automati-
cally. These may appear on your airline ticket, in which case your lug-
gage will be checked through to the island.
By boat
Fantasea Cruises’ Blue Ferries (% 1800/650 851 in Australia, or
07/4946 5111) makes ferry transfers from Hamilton Island Airport to
Shute Harbour, Daydream Island, Long Island, and, for guests only, to
Lindeman Island. The one-way fare is A$37 (US$30/£15) adults, A$20
(US$16/£8) children, or A$2 (US$1.60/£0.80) extra to Lindeman Island.
Part IV: Brisbane, Queensland, and the Great Barrier Reef 
314

By train
Several Queensland Rail (% 1300/131 722 in Australia; www.travel
train.com.au) long-distance trains stop at Proserpine every week. The
one-way fare from Cairns on the Tilt Train is A$144 (US$115/£58). There
is a bus link to Airlie Beach. Brisbane fares range from A$233 (US$186/
£93) on the Tilt Train to A$336 (US$269/£134) for a first-class sleeper on
the Sunlander or A$606 (US$485/£242) for the all-inclusive Queenslander
class service.
By bus
Greyhound Australia (% 13 14 99 in Australia) operates plentiful daily
services to Airlie Beach from Brisbane (trip time: around 19 hours) and
Cairns (trip time: 10 hours). The fare is A$173 (US$138/£69) from
Brisbane and A$108 (US$86/£43) from Cairns.
Whitsunday Transit (% 07/4946 1800) meets all flights and trains at
Proserpine and provides door-to-door transfers to Airlie Beach hotels or
to Shute Harbour. The fare from the airport is A$17 (US$14/£7) adults,
A$9 (US$7.20/£3.60) children to Airlie Beach or Shute Harbour. From the
train station, it’s A$8.20 (US$6.55/£3.30) adults, A$4.20 (US$3.35/£1.70)
children to Airlie Beach; A$11 (US$8.80/£4.40) adults, A$5.50
(US$4.40/£2.20) children to Shute Harbour.
By car
The Bruce Highway leads south from Cairns or north from Brisbane to
Proserpine, 26km (16 miles) inland from Airlie Beach. Take the Whit-
sunday turnoff to reach Airlie Beach and Shute Harbour. Allow a good
eight hours to drive from Cairns. There are several car storage facilities
at Shute Harbour. Whitsunday Car Security (% 07/4946 9955) will col-
lect your car anywhere in the Whitsunday area and store it in locked
covered parking for A$10(US$8/£4) per day or A$15 (US$12/£6)
overnight.
Finding information after you arrive
The Whitsundays Information Center (% 1800/801 252 in Australia, or
07/4945 3711; www.whitsundaytourism.com) is in Proserpine, on the
Bruce Highway in the town’s south. It’s open Monday through Friday
from 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. and weekends and public holidays (except Good
Friday and Dec 25) from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. If you’re staying in Airlie Beach,
picking up information from the private booking agents lining the main
street is easier. All stock a vast range of cruise, tour, and hotel informa-
tion, and they make bookings free of charge. They all have pretty much
the same stuff, but because some represent certain boats exclusively,
and because prices can vary a little from one to the next, shop around.
Another useful Web site is www.whitsunday.net.au.
Chapter 17: Queensland 315

Getting around the mainland and islands
By bus
Whitsunday Transit (% 07/4946 1800) runs half-hourly buses between
Airlie Beach and Shute Harbour to meet all ferries. The fare is A$4.65
(US$3.70/£1.85). A Ten Trip Ticket, valid for one month and able to be
used by more than one person, can be used to travel between Shute
Harbour, Airlie Beach, Cannonvale, and Proserpine. It costs A$23 (US$18/
£9.20) adults and A$12 (US$9.60/£4.80) children, which means A$2.25
(US$1.80/£0.90) per trip. An Explorer Pass, good for unlimited travel
between Shute Harbour, Airlie Beach, Cannonvale, and Proserpine from
6 a.m. to 10:30 p.m. on the date of issue, costs A$8.50 (US$6.80/£3.40) for
adults, half-price for children.
By car
Avis (% 07/4946 6318), Hertz (% 07/4946 4687), and Thrifty (% 07/
4946 7727) have outlets in Airlie Beach and at Proserpine Airport (tele-
phone numbers serve both locations).
By ferry
Fantasea Cruises (% 1800/650 851 in Australia, or 07/4946 5111) makes
ferry transfers from Shute Harbour to the islands and between the
islands. A one-way transfer from the mainland to Long and Daydream
islands costs A$26 (US$21/£10) adults, A$17 (US$14/£6.80) children 4 to
14; to Hamilton Island, A$39 (US$31/£16) adults, A$21 (US$17/£8.40) chil-
dren 4 to 14. Reservations are not necessary, but do book your arrival
and departure ferry so that you don’t miss your connections. Most
islands receive a boat only every two to four hours, so it’s a long wait if
you miss your boat.
Island ferries and Great Barrier Reef cruises leave from Shute Harbour, a
ten-minute drive south of Airlie Beach on Shute Harbour Road. Most
other tour-boat operators and bareboat charters anchor at Abel Point
Marina, a 15-minute walk west from Airlie Beach.
Staying on the Whitsunday Coast and Islands
There are pros and cons to staying on the mainland — which really
means Airlie Beach — or at an island resort. If you stay on the mainland,
accommodations are cheaper, you have a greater a choice of restau-
rants, and you’re free to visit a different island each day. The mainland
has jet-skiing, kayaking, parasailing, catamaran rental, and windsurfing.
On an island, swimming, snorkeling, bushwalking, and a huge range 
of watersports, many of them free, are right on your doorstep. The
deadly stingers that can infest mainland shores do not — except in rare
cases — make it to the islands, so swimming in the islands is safe year-
round. You won’t be isolated if you stay on an island, because most

stop at the island resorts. One major disadvantage of an island is that
you’re “captive” to high food and drink prices. You can choose from
about ten island resorts, ranging from positively plush to comfortably
midrange to downright old-fashioned.
High season in the Whitsundays coincides with school vacations, which
occur in January, in mid-April, from late June to early July, from late
September to early October, and in late December. The Aussie winter
(June–Aug) is popular, too. You have to book months ahead to secure
high-season accommodations, but at any other time you can get some
very good deals indeed.
The top hotels and resorts
Coral Sea Resort
$$$–$$$$$
Airlie Beach
This is one of the best places to stay on the Whitsunday mainland, with a
superb location on the edge of Airlie Beach’s Paradise Point and 280-
degree views of the ocean. The wide range of great accommodations styles
suits everyone from families to honeymooners; although it’s relatively big
and sprawling, it’s so well designed that you can easily feel you’re alone.
All 78 rooms have a nautical feel. The Coral Sea suites are divine, complete
with a Jacuzzi and double hammock on the balcony. There are four styles
of suites, apartments, and family units, and other amenities include a great
restaurant overlooking the pool and the Coral Sea. A three-minute walk
along the waterfront brings you to Airlie Beach village.

Hamilton Island
$$$–$$$$$
Hamilton has the widest range of activities, accommodations styles, and
restaurants of any Reef island resort. Accommodations choices are extra-
large rooms and suites in the high-rise hotel; high-rise one-bedroom apart-
ments; Polynesian-style bungalows in tropical gardens; and glamorous
rooms in the two-story, adults-only Beach Club (with minimalist décor, a
personal “host,” and private restaurant, lounge, and pool for exclusive use
of Beach Club guests); as well as one-, two-, three-, and four-bedroom
apartments and villas. The ultraluxury Qualia (www.qualiaresort.
com.au) resort-within-the-resort opened at the end of September 2007 (but
not in time to review before we went to press). The best sea views are from
Chapter 17: Queensland 317

the second-floor Beach Club rooms, from floors 5 to 18 of the Reef View
Hotel, and from most apartments and villas. The hotel and Beach Club
have concierge service.
A marina village has cafes, restaurants, shops, and a yacht club, and near
the accommodations are a large free-form pool and swim-up bar and the
curve of Catseye Beach. Hamilton offers a huge range of watersports; fish-
ing trips; cruises; speedboat rides; go-karts; a Wire Flyer flying fox hang
glider; a pistol and clay-target rifle range; mini golf; an aquatic driving
range; beach barbecue safaris; hiking trails; a wildlife sanctuary where you
can cuddle a koala or hold a baby crocodile; and an extensive daily activ-
ities program. Because a steep hill splits the resort, the best way to get
around is on the free bus service, which operates on three different loops
around the island from 7 a.m. to 11 p.m., or by golf buggy (A$40/US$32/£16
per hour or A$80/US$64/£32 for 24 hours). To get away from the main area,
hit the beach or the hiking trails — most of the 750-hectare (1,853-acre)
island is virgin bushland. The biggest drawback is that just about every
activity costs.

foliage to the hexagonal complex of swimming pools by the sea. Despite
the luxury, Hayman is relaxed. Dress is beachwear by day, smart casual at

renowned for the antiques, artworks, and objets d’art gracing its public
areas, the accommodations are welcoming. Every room, suite, villa, and
penthouse has a balcony or terrace, bathrobes, and valet service (and butler

ReefSleep
Fancy having the Reef all to yourself? Fantasea Cruises (% 07/4946 5111; www.
fantasea.com.au) offers a two-day, one-night ReefSleep, where you overnight on
its pontoon. This gives you a fabulous chance to see the reef at night when the coral
is luminescent in the moonlight and nocturnal sea creatures are active. The trip
includes a presentation by a marine biologist, two scuba dives, night snorkeling, all
meals — including dinner under the stars with wine. Accommodations are in a clean,
comfortable bunkroom for four for A$395 (US$316/£158) per person, or in the double
cabin, which has a king-size bed, for A$495 (US$396/£198) per person.

Exploring the Whitsundays
Cruising to the Reef
Fantasea Cruises (% 07/4946 5111; www.fantasea.com.au) makes a
daily trip to Hardy Reef from Shute Harbour, near Airlie Beach, in a high-
speed, air-conditioned catamaran, with a marine ecology talk en route.
You anchor at the massive Fantasea Reefworld pontoon, which holds up
to 600 people, and spend up to three-and-a-half hours on the Reef. The
day trip costs A$176 (US$141/£70) adults, A$150 (US$120/£60) seniors
and students, A$30 (US$24/£12) children 4 to 14. Up to five children may
travel with each full paying adult. Guided snorkel safaris cost A$25
(US$20/£10) extra or A$75 (US$60/£30) for a family of four. Cruise-dive
packages are available for A$89 (US$71/£36) extra for both introductory
and certified dives, or you can book one on board for A$95 (US$76/£38)
for first-time divers, A$80 (US$64/£32) for certified divers. Cruises
depart at 8 a.m. and pick up passengers at Daydream and Hamilton
island resorts. Passengers from Long Island can connect by water taxi.
Bareboat sailing
Bareboating means you’re sailing the boat yourself. Don’t worry if you
have limited (or no) sailing experience, thousands of people manage to
do it every year. Most yacht-charter companies in the islands will want
one person on the boat to have a little experience, but you don’t need a
license and sailing is easy in these uncrowded waters, where the chan-
nels are deep and hazard-free and the seas are protected from big swells
by the Great Barrier Reef.
The 74 islands of the Whitsundays are so close to each other that one is
always in sight, and safe anchorages are easy to find. If you have no
boating experience, the company may require you to take a skipper
along for the first day at an extra cost of around A$200 (US$160/£80) a
day or A$275 (US$220/£110) overnight. If you think you know what
you’re doing but want extra reassurance, you can take a skipper along
for the first couple of hours for A$60 (US$48/£24). Before departure you
will have a two- to three-hour briefing and will be given easy-to-read
maps marking channels, anchorage points, and the few dangerous reefs.
Your charter company will radio in once or twice a day to check that
you’re still okay, and you can contact the company anytime for advice.
Most yachts are fitted for two to eight passengers and have a galley
kitchen, a barbecue mounted to the stern, hot showers, a toilet, linens, a
radio or stereo (or both), a motorized dinghy, and snorkeling equipment.
You can buy your own provisions or have the charter company stock
the boat at an extra cost of about A$40 (US$32/£16) per person per day.
In peak season you may have to charter the boat for a week. At other
times, most companies impose a minimum of five days, but many will
rent for three nights rather than let a vessel sit idle. In peak season,
expect to pay A$615 to A$790 (US$492–US$632/£246–£316) per night for
a four- to six-berth yacht. Rates in the off season, and even in the
Chapter 17: Queensland 321

Whitsundays’ busiest time (June–Aug), will be anywhere from A$100 to
A$200 (US$80–US$160/£40–£80) less. Advance bookings can sometimes
reduce the price even further. You’ll be asked to post a credit card bond
of around A$2,000 (US$1,600/£800). Mooring fees apply if you want to
stop at one of the island resorts overnight. Some charter companies
offer “sail ’n’ stay” packages that combine a few days of sailing with a
few days at an island resort.

com). Tourism Whitsunday (www.tourismwhitsunday.com) can furnish
you with a complete list of operators.
Sailing and snorkeling trips around the Whitsundays
Numerous yachts offer three-day/two-night sailing adventures around
the islands. Most boats carry a maximum of 12 passengers, so the
atmosphere is always friendly and fun. The food is good, the showers
are usually hot, and you sleep in comfortable but small berths. Some
have small private twin or double cabins. You can get involved with sail-
ing the boat as much or as little as you want, snorkel to your heart’s con-
tent, explore national park trails, stop at secluded bays, swim, sunbathe,
and generally have a relaxing time. A few companies offer introductory
and qualified scuba diving for an extra cost. Prices usually include all
meals, marine park entrance fees, snorkel gear, and transfers to the
departure point (Abel Point Marina or Shute Harbour). In the off season,
competition is fierce and you’ll be able to get great standby deals.
Among the better-known operators are Ragamuffin (% 07/4946 7777),
a 17m (56-ft.) oceangoing yacht; and Prosail (% 1800/810 116 in Aus-
tralia, or 07/4946 5433; www.prosail.com.au), which runs trips on a
fleet of 28 yachts. Prosail’s two-day/two-night guided sailing trips cost
A$340 (US$272/£136) plus A$30 (US$24/£12) in marine park fees. The
company also offers three- and six-day packages. Contact Tourism
Whitsunday (www.tourismwhitsunday.com) for a complete list of 
operators.
Island-hopping in the Whitsundays
Day-trippers to Hamilton, Daydream, South Molle, Club Crocodile’s Long
Island, and Hook Island resorts can rent the hotels’ watersports equip-
ment, laze by the beaches and pools, scuba-dive, join the resorts’ activi-
ties programs, hike their trails, and eat at some or all of their restaurants.
Club Crocodile’s Long Island Resort is rather noisy but unpretentious,
with plentiful watersports, picturesque hiking trails, wild wallabies, and
a large beach–cum–tidal flat where you can relax on sun lounges. You
can get to the islands on your own by ferry (see “Getting around the
mainland and islands,” earlier in this chapter), or take an organized day
Part IV: Brisbane, Queensland, and the Great Barrier Reef 
322

trip that visits one, two, or even three islands in a day. Fantasea Cruises
(% 1800/650 851 in Australia, or 07/4946 5111; www.fantasea.com.au)
and Whitsunday Island Adventure Cruises (% 07/4946 5255 for the
booking agent) all offer them, as do several yachts.
More cool things to see and do
 Humpback whales migrate to the Whitsundays July through
September to give birth. Fantasea Adventure Cruising (% 07/4946
5111; www.fantasea.com.au) runs whale-watching cruises in
season; trips feature an onboard talk and videos. The cost is about
A$100 (US$80/£40) per adult. If you don’t see whales, you can go
free another day, or choose another of Fantasea’s cruises as an
alternative.
 Proserpine River Eco Tours (book through Fantasea Cruises, % 07/
4946 5111) will show you another side of the Whitsundays — away
from the sea and islands — with a day tour that combines an open-
air wagon ride through the pristine Goorganga wetlands and a boat
trip on the river to learn more about one of Queensland’s major
crocodile-breeding grounds. This is the only place to see crocs in
safety in the wild south of the Daintree. Bus pickups operate from
Airlie Beach, Cannonvale, and Proserpine for the tours, which 
run about four hours, depending on tides, and cost A$89 (US$71/
£36) adults, A$57 (US$46/£23) kids 4 to 14, A$235 (US$188/£94) fam-
ilies of four. Back on land, you’ll enjoy billy tea, the best damper
(Outback-style food) we’ve ever tasted, and a talk on native wildlife
over a barbecue lunch.
 The championship Turtle Point golf course at Laguna Whitsundays
Resort, Kunapipi Springs Road, Midge Point (% 07/4947 7777), a
45-minute drive south of Airlie Beach, is one of Australia’s best
resort courses. An 18-hole round dodging wallabies, goannas, and
kookaburras on the difficult fairways will set you back around A$95
(US$76/£38), plus A$25 (US$20/£10) for club hire.
The Capricorn Coast and Heron Island
The small towns and rural country south of the Whitsundays may not
seem very exciting at first, but closer inspection will reveal plenty to see
and do. For a start, this is where you find the most spectacular of the
Great Barrier Reef islands, Heron Island, off the coast from Gladstone.
Heron’s reefs are beloved by divers and snorkelers; its waters boast 21
fabulous dive sites. In summer giant turtles nest on its beaches, and in
winter humpback whales cruise by.
The sugar town of Bundaberg is the closest to the southernmost point
of the Great Barrier Reef. If you visit the area between November and
March, allow an evening to visit the Mon Repos Turtle Rookery. Divers
may want to take in some of Australia’s best shore diving right off
Bundaberg’s beaches.

The brilliant colors of the island’s surrounding water and Reef are reflected
in the interiors of this lovely low-key resort, and everything is light-filled
and breezy. Heron’s central complex is equal parts grand Queenslander
home and sophisticated beach house, with bar and lounge areas open to

greater luxury in the suites or the private beach house. The property has
a lounge with a TV, public phones (only the four Point suites and the Beach
House have private phones), and Internet access. The Aqua Soul Spa
offers double treatment rooms, therapies designed for two, and the usual
spa treatments. The spa is in a secluded spot on the edge of the island’s

Rydges Capricorn Resort
$$$$–$$$$$
Yeppoon
Popular with large and sometimes noisy conference groups, this resort is
not a quiet getaway, but it offers lots to do and the location makes it a good
place to break your coastal drive. About 20km (13 miles) of unbroken
beach fronts the resort, the only one of any size or style in this region. It’s
about 9km (51⁄2 miles) from the seaside town of Yeppoon, about 45km (28
miles) north of the Rockhampton airport. It was built by Japanese busi-
nessman Yohachiro Iwasaki, and you may still hear the locals refer to it as
the “Iwasaki Resort” despite its several changes of name over the years.
The best of the accommodations is the Palms, with views over the beach
and out to Great Keppel Island. The main resort block is dominated by one
of the largest freshwater swimming pools in the Southern Hemisphere,
popular with visiting local families, especially on weekends. There are four
restaurants and two 18-hole golf courses as well as a free daytime kids’
club (you pay in the evenings). Accommodations vary: Some suites and
all apartments have kitchenettes, hotel rooms have minibars, and two-
bedroom apartments and Capricorn suites with kitchens have washing
machines and dryers. Set in 8,910 hectares (22,000 acres) of bushland, the
resort has extensive wetlands teeming with bird life. Wetlands tours are
available for a fee, as are horseback riding, fishing, canoeing, and
WaveRunners. Rates include most watersports.

Exploring the Capricorn Coast and Islands
 The Capricorn Caves (% 07/4934 2883; wwwcapricorncaves.
com.au), 23km (14 miles) north of Rockhampton at Olsen’s Caves
Road, off the Bruce Highway, have been a popular attraction in this
part of the world ever since Norwegian pioneer John Olsen stum-
bled upon them in 1882. The limestone caves originated in an
ancient coral reef (380 million years old) and today are a maze of
small tunnels and larger chambers. The one-hour tour, which winds
through large caverns with stalactite and stalagmite formations
before entering the 20m-high (66-ft.) Cathedral Cave, is A$20 (US$16/
£8) adults, A$10 (US$8/£4) children 5 to 15. It departs daily (except
Dec 25) on the hour from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. (closing time is 5 p.m.).
Spelunkers over age 16 can squeeze through tunnels and chimneys
and rock-climb on a three-hour adventure tour that costs A$65
(US$52/£26); minimum of two people required. Book 24 hours
ahead for this.
From December 1 to January 10, you can catch the Summer
Solstice light cave on a tour departing every morning at 11 a.m. On
the longest day of the year, the sun moves slowly over the Tropic of
Capricorn, and a ray of pure light pours through a hole in the lime-
stone caves. The caves are also home to thousands of small insec-
tivorous bats, which leave the cave at sunset to feed. Plan enough
time here to walk the 30-minute dry rain forest trail, watch the
video on bats in the interpretive center, and feed the wild kanga-
roos. If you like it so much you want to stay, a motor-home park
and campground are attached. Bus tours operate from Rockhamp-
ton; contact the Capricorn Caves for details.
 At least once a month, on a Saturday night, at the Great Western
Hotel, Stanley and Denison streets (% 07/4922 3888), you can see
bull-riding cowboys take to the rodeo ring to test their skills against
local Brahman bulls.
The best of Heron Island
When you’re on Heron Island, you’re already on the Reef. Entering mag-
nificent fields of coral is as easy as stepping off the beach and into the
water. The life forms that abound are accessible to everyone through
diving, snorkeling, or reef walks at low tide, or aboard a semisubmer-
sible vessel.
There has been a resort on Heron since 1932, and in 1943 the island
became a national park. It is a haven for wildlife and people, and an
experience of a lifetime is almost guaranteed at any time of year. Heron
is a rookery for giant green and loggerhead turtles who nest and lay eggs
from late November to February. Hatchlings emerge and scuttle down
the sand to the water from February to mid-April. Humpback whales
pass through from June through September.
Part IV: Brisbane, Queensland, and the Great Barrier Reef 
328

Three days on Heron gives you plenty of time to see everything, and the
island is so small that you can walk around it in about half an hour. One
of the first things to do is to take advantage of the organized activities
that operate several times a day and that are designed so guests can
plan their own days. Diving, snorkeling, and reef walking are major occu-
pations for visitors. The island is home to 21 stunning dive sites. Guided
walks provide another way to explore the island; they include a visit to
the island’s research station.
Chapter 17: Queensland 329
Turtle time on Heron and Mon Repos
The egg-laying ritual of the turtles is central to a trip to Heron Island in Australia’s
summer months. At night and in the early morning, you can head to the beaches to
witness the turtles lumber up the beach, dig holes in the sand, and lay their eggs. They
are not easily disturbed, and you can get very close. Every night during the season, vol-
unteer guides from the University of Queensland research station based on the island
are on hand, tagging and measuring the turtles before they return to the water. The
laying season runs December through February, and this could be one of the most
memorable parts of your visit to Australia: the sight of a giant green turtle, tears rolling
from her eyes as she lays a clutch of about 120 eggs in a pear-shaped chamber dug
from the sand.
You can also see turtles nesting on the mainland, at Mon Repos Beach, outside
Bundaberg. Mon Repos Conservation Park is one of the two largest loggerhead-turtle
rookeries in the South Pacific. The visitor center by the beach has a great display on
the turtle life cycle and shows films at approximately 7:30 p.m. daily in summer. There
is a strict booking system for turtle-watching tours, to help cope with the crowds.
Access to the beach is by ticket only, and during the turtle season you must book your
visit to Mon Repos.
Tickets are sold through the Bundaberg City Visitor Information Centre (% 07/4153
8888) at 189 Bourbong St., Bundaberg. Tours start at 7 p.m. and you’ll be given a time
for your tour, which saves waiting around in a long queue of people. Nesting happens
around high tide; hatching usually occurs between 8 p.m. and midnight. Take a flash-
light if you can, and a sweater, because it can get quite cool. The Mon Repos Turtle
Rookery (% 07/4159 1652 for the visitor center) is 14km (83⁄4 miles) east of Bundaberg’s
town center. Follow Bourbong Street out of town toward Burnett Heads as it becomes
Bundaberg-Bargara Road. Take the Port Road to the left and look for the Mon Repos
signs to the right.
During turtle nesting season (November to late March) the park and information center
is open 24 hours a day. Public access to the beach is closed from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. Turtle
viewing tours run from 7 p.m. until 1 a.m. daily (except for Dec 24, 25, and 31). From
April to early November (when there are no turtles around), the information center is
open Monday through Thursday from 7:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. and Friday from 7:30 a.m. to
noon. The park is open 24 hours. Admission to the visitor center is free from April
through November, but when the turtles start nesting, the cost is A$8.70 (US$6.95/£3.50)
adults, A$4.60 (US$3.70/£1.85) children ages 5 to 17, A$21 (US$17/£8.40) families.

As for the reef walk, just borrow a pair of sand shoes, a balance pole,
and a viewing bucket, and head off with a guide at low tide. The walk can
take up to 90 minutes, but there’s no need to stay; if it gets too hot, you
can head to the sanctuary of your room or the shady bar area.
The Sunshine Coast
No prizes for guessing how this stretch of coastline got its name. Warm
weather, miles of sandy beaches, trendy restaurants, and a relaxed
lifestyle attract Aussies vacationers to the Sunshine Coast in droves.
Despite some rather unsightly commercial development in recent years,
the Sunshine Coast is still a great spot to unwind.
The Sunshine Coast starts at Caloundra, 83km (51 miles) north of
Brisbane, and runs to Rainbow Beach, 40km (25 miles) north of Noosa
Heads, where the fashionable crowd goes. Most of Noosa’s dining, shop-
ping, and socializing takes place on Hastings Street, in Noosa Heads; for
sunbathing and swimming head to the adjacent Main Beach. The com-
mercial strip of Noosa Junction is a one-minute drive away; a three-
minute drive west along the river takes you to the low-key town of
Noosaville, which has a huge range of holiday apartments. Giving Noosa
a run for its money in recent years is newly spruced-up Mooloolaba,
about 30km (19 miles) south, which has a better beach and about 90
restaurants.

a-half hours, and the fare is A$17 (US$14/£6.80). Other trains will take
you there via Nambour or Caboolture, but you’ll still have to then get a
bus connection to get to Noosa Heads. Queensland Rail’s long-distance
trains from Brisbane pick up but do not drop off passengers in Cooroy,
with the exception of the high-speed Tilt Train (which runs Sun–Fri).

A great place to enjoy a spa by the sea is Noosa’s first AAA-rated five-star

looking down the Noosa River to the mountains. Sit on the balcony at
sunset and drink it in. All rooms are extra-large, and all have Jacuzzis.
You’ll pay more for two-level poolside villas, which have private access to
the pool area but no view. Some rooms have ocean (but not beach) views.
The Aqua Day Spa has a Roman-bathhouse feel and offers a wide range of
treatments. The restaurant, Cato’s — named for the late Australian novel-
ist Nancy Cato, who lived in Noosa — fronts Hastings Street and is a great
place to watch the world go by.

Dining on the Sunshine Coast
Noosa’s Hastings Street is the place to see and be seen. This is where the
action is at night, as vacationers wine and dine at restaurants as sophis-
ticated as those in any big city. Make sure you make reservations in high
season.
The best breakfast in town is at Bistro C, one of the few restaurants
offering beachfront dining, but Café Le Monde at the southern end of
Chapter 17: Queensland 333

Hastings Street (opposite the back of the Surf Club), is a Noosa institu-
tion and you’ll find a crowd there. Noosa Junction is a less attractive
place to eat, but the prices are cheaper. There are also about 90 restau-
rants at Mooloolaba.

MODERN ASIAN
Madame Fu’s is the only Asian restaurant on the Hastings Street strip. The
food is interesting, the staff friendly, and the décor stylish. House special-
ties include such dishes as chili-salted squid with dry fired onion, slated
duck egg and mustard green sauce, and caramelized beef cheek with
lemon, cucumber, radish, and watercress. There are plenty of noodle
dishes and the restaurant also does takeout.

$$–$$$
Noosa Heads
CONTEMPORARY
Chef Gary Skelton has one of the few beachfront restaurant locations in
Noosa, and his popularity has been boosted by the following he brought
with him from vacationing Sydneysiders. So make sure to reserve a table,
especially for dinner. Some of the locals balk at the A$10 (US$8/£4) cork-
age fee for BYO wine, but there’s no quibbling about the quality of the
food. Breakfast dishes can be as simple as muffins, or you can indulge with
buttermilk-and-banana pancakes (with palm sugar butter and maple
syrup). The dinner menu includes dishes such as pan-fried snapper with
honey-roasted pumpkin, green beans, chèvre, and a cabernet dressing.

Yandina
ASIAN
Walk along the jungle paths to the hidden building, and you’ll get an idea
of what’s in store at this amazing restaurant, hidden in Yandina, a less fash-
ionable part of the Sunshine Coast. Tables are set around a lagoon and
among the trees, with statues and other artworks scattered throughout.
At night the effect is enhanced by torches and lighting. It won’t prepare
you for the flavors that come out of this kitchen — mainly Thai but with
other Asian influences. Dishes like crispy fish with tamarind and chili
sauce, palm sugar and lime poached schnappers, or Penang chicken curry
with snake beans and caramelized pumpkin with coconut, Thai basil, and
peanuts. Before you leave, buy the cookbook or sign up for cooking
classes. This is a restaurant you’ll be thinking and talking about for a long
time.

Exploring the Sunshine Coast
The top attractions
Australia Zoo
Beerwah
The Animal Planet Crocoseum, a 5,000-seat stadium in which daily croc
feedings are held at noon is the highlight of the late “Crocodile Hunter”
Steve Irwin’s zoo. Irwin’s widow Terri has ensured that little has changed
in the day-to-day running of the zoo, and this is a world-class attraction.
Covering 100 hectares (251 acres), the zoo has much to see. Demon-
strations and feedings are held throughout the day, and you can also hand-
feed ’roos, pat a koala, check out foxes and camels, and watch and hold (if
you’re braver than we are) venomous snakes and pythons. You can tour
the Koala and Wildlife Hospital next door to see how sick and injured ani-
mals are cared for. There are lots of exotic animals — check out the Tiger
Temple, home to five tigers and four cheetahs. The Irwin family has made
November 15 Steve Irwin Day at the zoo, so for fans this may be the time
to visit.

(US$118/£59) families of 4. Open: Daily 9 a.m.–4:30 p.m. Closed Dec 25.
Underwater World
Mooloolaba
A transparent tunnel with an 80m (262-ft.) moving walkway that takes you
through a tank filled with sharks, stingrays, groupers, eels, and coral is the
highlight here. Kids can pick up starfish and sea cucumbers in the touch
pool, and there are displays on whales and sharks, shark breeding, fresh-
water crocodile talks, an otter enclosure, and a 30-minute seal show. You
can swim with the seals (A$76/US$61/£30) or dive with the sharks (A$99/

More cool things to see and do
 The Big Pineapple (% 07/5442 1333) is 6km (33⁄4 miles) south of
Nambour on the Nambour Connection Road in Woombye. You
won’t miss it — this 16m-tall (52-ft.) monument to pineapple grow-
ers stands out on the side of the road. You can take a train ride
through a working pineapple plantation, ride through a rain forest
and a macadamia farm in a macadamia-nut-shaped carriage, and
visit a baby animal farm. Entry is free, but you pay for tours. The
train ride costs A$12 (US$9.60/£4.80) adults, A$9.50 (US$7.60/£3.80)
children 4 to 14; the macadamia tour costs A$7.50 (US$6/£3) adults,
A$5.50 (US$4.40/£2.20) children. The best option is a family pass,
which costs A$55 (US$44/£22) for two adults and up to four chil-
dren. Open: Daily from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. (rides start at 10 a.m.); it
opens later on April 25 (Anzac Day) and December 25 (call for exact
time).
 Learn to surf with two-time Australian and World Pro-Am cham-
pion Merrick Davis (% 0418/787 577 mobile; www.learntosurf.
com.au), who’s been teaching here since 1992. Merrick and his
team run two-hour lessons on Main Beach daily for A$55 (US$44/
£22), three-day certificate courses for A$150 (US$120/£60), and five-
day courses for A$220 (US$176/£88). They’ll pick you up and drop
you off at your accommodations. They also rent surfboards, body
boards, and sea kayaks.
 The Eumundi Markets, in the historic village of Eumundi, 13km 
(8 miles) west of Noosa along the Eumundi Road, are held on
Saturdays from 6:30 a.m. to 2 p.m. and Wednesdays from 8 a.m. to
1:30 p.m. Locals and visitors wander under the huge trees among
dozens of stalls selling locally grown organic lemonade, fruit, 
hats, teddy bears, antique linen, homemade soaps, handcrafted 
furniture — even live emu chicks! Get your face painted, your palm
read, or your feet massaged. Listen to some didgeridoo music or
bush poetry. When shopping’s done, pop into one of the cafes on
Eumundi’s main street.
The Gold Coast
The Gold Coast is one of Australia’s icons, and since the 1950s it has
been the favored holiday playground for families. Its icons are bronzed
lifeguards, bikini-clad meter maids, overly tanned tourists draped with
gold jewelry, and high-rise apartment towers that cast long shadows
over parts of the beach. The white sands stretch uninterrupted for 70km
(43 miles), making up for the long strips of neon-lit motels and cheap
souvenir shops. Despite the crowds and the development, you can still
find yourself a quiet strip of beach.

The Gold Coast
Chapter 17: Queensland 337

The Gold Coast’s theme parks are not as large or as sophisticated as
Disneyland, but they’re fun all the same. There are three major parks —
Dreamworld, Warner Bros. Movie World, and Sea World — as well as two
water parks. If theme parks aren’t your thing, there are also 40 golf
courses, dinner cruises, and loads of adrenaline-fueled outdoor activi-
ties, from bungee jumping to jet-skiing. The best activity on the Gold
Coast, though, is the natural kind, and it doesn’t cost a cent — hitting
the surf and lazing on the beach.
Getting to the Gold Coast
By plane
Domestic flights land at Gold Coast Airport, Coolangatta, 25km (16
miles) south of Surfers Paradise. Qantas (% 13 13 13) operates direct
flights from Sydney. Virgin Blue (% 13 67 89) flies direct from Sydney,
Melbourne, and Adelaide. Jetstar (% 13 15 38 in Australia) flies from
Melbourne, Newcastle, and Adelaide. The nearest international gateway
is Brisbane International Airport.
The Gold Coast Tourist Shuttle (% 13 12 30 in Australia) meets every
flight at Coolangatta and will transfer you to your accommodations. The
fare is A$18 (US$14/£7.20) one-way, A$33 (US$26/£13) round-trip adults;
A$9 (US$7.20/£3.60) one-way, A$17 (US$14/£6.80) round-trip kids ages 4
to 13; A$45 (US$36/£18) one-way, A$83 (US$66/£33) round-trip families of
four. A better deal if you’re going to use buses a lot is to buy a Freedom
Pass (see “Getting around the Gold Coast,” later in this chapter), which
includes your airport transfers. A taxi from the airport to Surfers
Paradise is about A$30 (US$24/£12) but may be higher if traffic is heavy.
The Coachtrans Airporter bus meets most flights at Brisbane Airport
and makes about 20 trips a day from the domestic and international ter-
minals to Gold Coast accommodations for A$35 (US$28/£14) adults, A$18
(US$14/£7.20) children 4 to 13, A$89 (US$71/£36) families of four. The
trip takes about 90 minutes to Surfers Paradise. You don’t need to book
in advance unless you’re on an evening flight; if you are, call % 1300/
664 700 in Queensland, or 07/3358 9700.
AirtrainConnect links Brisbane Airport and the Gold Coast by train and
bus for A$37 (US$30/£15) adults, A$19 (US$15/£7.60) children 5 to 14,
A$93 (US$74/£37) groups/families of four. Take Airtrain to the Gold
Coast, and then an air-conditioned coach to any accommodations
between Southport Spit at the northern end of the Gold Coast and
Burleigh Heads to the south.
A three-day Airtrain SmartPass costs A$112 (US$90/£45) adults, A$56
(US$45/£22) children, A$280 (US$224/£112) families of four; it covers
AirtrainConnect transfers, as well as unlimited door-to-door theme park
transfers on the Gold Coast Tourist Shuttle and use of the Surfside bus
network. Passes are also available for 5, 7, 10, and 14 days.
Part IV: Brisbane, Queensland, and the Great Barrier Reef 
338

By train
Suburban trains (call Queensland Rail Citytrain; % 07/3235 5555)
depart Brisbane Central and Roma Street stations every 30 minutes for
the 70-minute trip to the Gold Coast suburb of Nerang. The fare is A$23
(US$18/£9.20) adults, A$12 (US$9.60/£4.80) children 5 to 14. Numerous
local buses meet the trains to take passengers to Surfers Paradise.
If you come by train to Surfers Paradise from Sydney or other southern
cities, service is on Countrylink (% 1300/131 722 in Australia; www.
countrylink.nsw.gov.au), and you’ll need to transfer to a connecting
coach in Casino or Murwillumbah, just south of the Queensland border.
The trip from Sydney takes 14 to 15 hours and the fare is A$96 (US$77/
£38) for a first-class seat.
By bus
Coachtrans (% 13 12 30 in Queensland, or 07/3238 4700) runs between
Brisbane and Gold Coast hotels. The fare is A$26 (US$21/£10) adults one-
way, A$15 (US$12/£6) children 4 to 13, A$67 (US$54/£27) families of four.
Greyhound Australia (% 13 14 99) makes daily stops at Surfers
Paradise from Sydney and Brisbane. The trip from Sydney takes 14 to 15
hours, and the fare is A$112 (US$90/£45). Trip time from Brisbane is 90
minutes, and the fare is A$24 (US$19/£9.60).
By car
Access to the Gold Coast Highway, which runs the length of the coast, is
off the Pacific Highway from Sydney or Brisbane. The drive takes about
80 minutes from Brisbane. From Sydney, it’s an 11-hour trip, sometimes
longer, on the crowded, run-down Pacific Highway.
Finding information after you arrive
Gold Coast Tourism (% 1300/309 440 in Australia, or 07/5538 4419;
www.verygc.com) has an information kiosk on Cavill Avenue, Surfers
Paradise. It is open Monday through Friday from 8:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.,
Saturday 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m., and Sunday and holidays from 9 a.m. to 
4 p.m. A second information booth is at the corner of Griffith and Warner
streets in Coolangatta. It is open from 8:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. weekdays,
from 8 a.m. to 2 p.m. weekends and public holidays.
Getting around the Gold Coast
By bus
Surfside Buslines (% 13 12 30 in Australia, or 07/5571 6555) is the local
bus company. Its best deal is the Freedom Pass, which allows you to
hop on and off the buses anytime you like. The three-day pass costs
A$58 (US$46/£23) adults, A$29 (US$23/£12) children, A$145 (US$116/£58)
families of four; 5-, 7-, 10-, and 14-day passes are also available. The pass
gives you door-to-door return Gold Coast Airport transfers, unlimited
Chapter 17: Queensland 339

door-to-door transfers to Dreamworld, Warner Bros. Movie World, Sea
World, Wet’n’Wild Water World and Currumbin Wildlife Sanctuary, as
well as unlimited use of the Surfside bus network, 24 hours a day.
By car
Most major hotels, including all those listed here, are within walking dis-
tance of the beach, shops, and restaurants. Many tour companies pick
up at hotels, and you can reach the theme parks by bus, so a car isn’t
essential. It is, however, handy for a day trip to the hinterland, and to get
around to restaurants and golf courses. Parking is cheap and plentiful in
numerous lots and on the side streets between the Gold Coast Highway
and The Esplanade.
Avis (% 07/5539 9388), Budget (% 07/5538 5470), Hertz (% 07/5538
5366), and Thrifty (% 07/5570 9999) have outlets in Surfers Paradise
and at Gold Coast Airport. Endless local outfits rent cars at cheap rates.
Staying on the Gold Coast
School holidays, especially the Christmas vacation from mid-December
to the end of January, are peak season on the Gold Coast. Accommo-
dations are booked months in advance at these times. The rest of the
year, occupancy levels plummet — and so do rates! Packages and deals
abound in the off season, so make sure you ask.
Most accommodations require a one-week minimum stay during school
holiday periods and a four-day minimum stay at Easter. When the Gold
Coast Indy car race takes over the town for four days in October, hotel
rates skyrocket and most hostelries demand a minimum stay of three or
four nights. Don’t leave accommodations bookings to the last minute!
The Gold Coast Booking Centre (% 1300/737 111; www.gcbc.com.au)
is a centralized booking service that offers great deals at more than
1,200 apartments in Surfers Paradise and Broadbeach. Apartments make
good sense for families and for any traveler who wants to self-cater to
save money.
Because the Gold Coast has a dramatic oversupply of apartments that
stand empty except during school vacations, you can get a spacious
modern unit with ocean views for the cost of a midrange hotel.
Apartment-block developers got in quick to snag the best beachfront
spots when the Gold Coast boomed in the 1970s, so apartment build-
ings, not hotels, have the best ocean views.
The top hotels
Palazzo Versace
$$$$$
Main Beach
In the unlikely location of the Gold Coast, fashion designer Donatella
Versace has created a tribute to her late brother, Gianni, in the form of an
Part IV: Brisbane, Queensland, and the Great Barrier Reef 
340

opulent resort furnished exclusively with Versace gear. It’s over the top
and not for everyone, but we kinda like it. Everyone has his own — usually
strong — opinion of this place. Everything was imported from Italy, from
the river stones that pave the porte-cochere to the antique chandelier that
dominates the vast, marbled lobby. Vaulted ceilings are hand-detailed in
gold, and marble columns dominate. Guest rooms are in four colors (red,
blue, gold, and orange) and are a bit more muted than the eye-catching
public areas. Everything in them — furniture, cutlery, crockery, toiletries —
is Versace (either from the home wares collection or created for the hotel).
Many rooms overlook the huge pool, the Broadwater (a stretch of ocean),
and the marina. Everything is beautifully appointed, and the corridors are
lined with Gianni’s artwork and designs. You can choose from eight room
types (Donatella stays in the A$3,500/US$2,800/£1,400 Imperial Suite) or
from a pool of 72 two- and three-bedroom condominiums. All rooms and
suites have Jacuzzis; condos have kitchens. A spa and health club are 
in the basement. Plus, the resort has 28 swimming pools and a Versace
boutique.

Paradise Resort Gold Coast
$$$
Surfers Paradise
If keeping the kids amused is a priority — as well as having some time with-
out them — this place is for you. This resort has a licensed child-care
center for little ones as young as 6 weeks and up to 5 years old. For 5- to 12-
year-olds, there’s the Zone 4 Kids, complete with pedal minicars, the
Leonardo painting room, and an underwater-themed pirate adventure
world. Or you can laze around the leafy pool area — there are four pools —
and watch the kids play on the water slide. The child-care center charges
moderate fees, and the Zone 4 Kids is free; both operate daily year-round.
Rooms are comfortable and have views of the pool or the gardens. Family
quarters sleep up to five in two separate rooms, and some (the family stu-
dios) have kitchenettes. Each Junior Bunkhouse room has a queen-size
bed in the main room and brightly painted bunks in a separate kids’ area,
with its own TV, PlayStation, chalkboard, and desk. The resort also rents
a wide range of stuff such as strollers, bottle warmers, car seats, and
PlayStations, and it has a minisupermarket and takeout meal service as
well as two restaurants. The range of activities makes this a great value
for families, and the center of Surfers Paradise and the patrolled beach are
a few blocks across the highway. Some rooms are near the highway, so ask
for a quiet spot.

This is absolutely the best view in town! Q1 opened in 2005 as the world’s
tallest residential tower — it reaches 322.5 meters (1,058 ft). From your
room, you can look down on everyone else on the Gold Coast, especially if
you’re staying at level 46 or higher, which dwarfs all other buildings in sight.
From inside, or on your glass-enclosed balcony, you can see much of the
expanse of the coast or hinterland. For the complete 360-degree experience,
head to the 77th floor for the Observation Deck (see “The top attractions,”
later in this section). Each apartment has a luxury kitchen, dining, and
lounge area, and is given a daily miniclean service (which consists of
making the beds, replacing towels, and replenishing toilet paper and
kitchen supplies). It’s all glass, granite, and stainless steel, but there are
nice personal touches (the bathroom drawer in our room had old-fashioned
hair curlers in it). Each apartment has laundry facilities and two- and three-
bedroom apartments have two bathrooms. The hotel also has an in-house
cinema, as well as two lagoon pools and an indoor heated lap-pool.

Dining on the Gold Coast
You don’t have to look hard to find good restaurants on the Gold Coast.
There are many stylish restaurants and cafes, most reasonably priced,
around Surf Parade and Victoria Avenue in Broadbeach, as well as in
the nearby Oasis shopping mall. Other trendy spots are the stylish
Marina Mirage shopping center, opposite the Sheraton on Sea World
Drive in Main Beach, and the hip Tedder Avenue cafes in Main Beach.
Elephant Rock Café

Currumbin
CONTEMPORARY
This chic pavilion overlooking Currumbin Beach has mesmerizing views of
the surf, and food that’s among the best on the Gold Coast. Whether you’re
after breakfast, lunch, or dinner you’ll not be disappointed with food that
includes gourmet vegetarian choices as well as something for those who
like more traditional fare. Lunch and dinner menus change seasonally, and
many of the wines are from small boutique wineries. The cakes and biscuits

Ristorante Fellini
$$$–$$$$
Main Beach
ITALIAN
Diners flock to this family-owned restaurant for the flavors of Naples and
Tuscany — as well as views of the marina and Broadwater. On warm days,
the windows are opened to let in the sea breeze, and the split-level design
means every table gets a great view. In a stylish place like this, you may
expect the prices to be high and the staff to be superior, but they’re not.
The service is friendly and welcoming but snappy. On the menu, you’ll find
plenty of pasta dishes such as ravioli filled with roasted duck and vegeta-
bles cooked in a light sauce of butter, sage, and parmesan topped with
poppy seeds, and a range of chicken, beef, and seafood dishes.

Exploring the Gold Coast
Thirty-five white sandy beaches are the top attraction on the Gold
Coast. These patrolled beaches stretch almost uninterrupted from the
Spit north of Surfers Paradise to Rainbow Bay, south of Coolangatta. In
fact, the Gold Coast is just one long fabulous beach. The most popular
beaches are Main Beach, Surfers North, Elkhorn Avenue, Surfers
Paradise, Mermaid Beach, Burleigh Heads, Coolangatta, and
Greenmount. All are patrolled 365 days a year.
Away from the beach, the Gold Coast’s major attractions are theme
parks. The big three — Dreamworld, Sea World, and Warner Bros.
Movie World — are joined by two water parks and by an Aussie-themed
outback show, Australian Outback Spectacular. Sea World is the only
major theme park in the center of town. The others are in northern
bushland on the Pacific Highway, about 15 to 20 minutes away from
Surfers Paradise. You can ride to the theme parks on the Gold Coast
Tourist Shuttle or on Surfside Buslines. Take bus no. TX1 or TX2 to
Dreamworld, Movie World, and Wet’n’Wild; bus no. 750 from Surfers
Paradise or 9 from Southport to get to Sea World.
Trains (% 13 12 30) run to Coomera and Helensvale on the Brisbane–
Gold Coast line. Queensland Rail Citytrain sells tickets to the theme
parks at attended stations, including Brisbane Central, which saves the
time of standing in line to get in, rather than any money.

The top attractions
Australian Outback Spectacular
Oxenford
Wild horses, stampeding cattle, and even a helicopter are all part of a
A$23-million (US$18-million/£9.2-million) extravaganza that’s part theme
park, part dinner show. Aimed at introducing visitors to the “spirit of the
Outback,” the 90-minute show is staged while you’re tucking in to a three-
course Aussie barbecue-style meal. With seating for 1,000, part of the show
is built around the competitive spirit of Australians. The audience is split
into two groups after receiving free stockmen’s hats whose headbands
depict their respective station for which they are encouraged to cheer. The
“station muster” is billed as the most breathtaking part of the show, high-
lighting the skills of both horse and rider.

Currumbin Wildlife Sanctuary
Currumbin
Currumbin Wildlife Sanctuary is celebrating 60 years in business and is
one of the Gold Coast’s best-loved attractions. It began life as a bird sanc-
tuary and is almost synonymous with the wild rainbow lorikeets, with their
vivid green backs, blue heads, and red-and-yellow chests, that flock here
by the hundreds twice a day for feeding. The chattering birds descend
onto visitors holding trays of food. Photographers go crazy, and tourists
love it. Feeding times are 8 a.m. and 4 p.m., and feedings last about 90 min-
utes. You can also have your photo taken cuddling a koala, feed kangaroos,
take a miniature steam-train ride through the park, and attend animal talks
and feeding demonstrations. An Aboriginal song-and-dance show takes
place daily. The park’s 27 hectares (67 acres) are home to 1,400 native
birds and animals, including two saltwater crocodiles, and the wetlands
on the grounds attract lots of native birds. A highlight is the free-flight
birds show at 11 a.m. and 2 p.m. Wildnight Tours are run daily at 7:15 p.m.,
and last for around two-and-a-half hours. They cost A$49 (US$39/£20)
adults, A$27 (US$22/£11) children 4 to 13.

David Fleay Wildlife Park
West Burleigh
This is one of Australia’s premier wildlife parks, named for naturalist David
Fleay, who established it in 1952 and lived here until his death in 1993.
Platypus, saltwater, and freshwater crocodiles; wallabies; kangaroos; glider
possums; dingoes; wombats; and the rare Lumholtz’s tree kangaroo are all
to be seen here. There’s also a large range of Australian birds, including
emus, cassowaries, wedge-tailed eagles, black swans, and lorikeets. A series
of boardwalks leads through mangrove, rain forest, and eucalyptus habi-
tats, where most of the animals roam free. The nocturnal house, open from
11 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily, is where you’ll see many of the most elusive ani-
mals. Talks and demonstrations throughout the day include a reptile show
and saltwater-croc feeding — usually only October through April, when
the crocs are hungry. Aboriginal rangers give talks about weaponry, bush
medicine, and their links with this region. Free guided tours are run
throughout the day. The Queensland National Parks and Wildlife Service
(QNPWS) has run the park since 1983; because it frowns on handling ani-
mals, you can’t cuddle a koala here.
See map p. 337. Kabool Road, West Burleigh (17km/11 miles south of Surfers
Paradise). % 07/5576 2411. Admission: A$15 (US$12/£6) adults, A$10 (US$8/£4) sen-

Dreamworld
Coomera
Adrenaline-junkies will love the action rides, such as the Giant Drop, in
which you free-fall 39 stories in five seconds; the Tower of Terror, which
propels you forward and upward at 4.5 Gs before you fall backward 38 sto-
ries in seven seconds; the hair-raising Cyclone roller coaster, with its 360-
degree loop; and the Wipeout, which spins, twists, and tumbles you upside
down at 2.5 Gs. Dreamworld is a Disney-style/Aussie-style family fun park,
where giant koalas called Kenny and Belinda roam the streets. Other activ-
ities include an IMAX theater, Nick Central (the only Nickelodeon cartoon
attraction outside the U.S.), a native wildlife park where you can cuddle a
koala and hand-feed kangaroos, river cruises livened by a bushranger
shootout, and a carousel and other rides for young kids. You can also
watch trainers swim, wrestle, and play with Bengal tigers on Tiger Island.
Souvenir stores, restaurants, and ice cream shops abound. There’s a
water-slide park, so bring your swimsuit.

The Gold Coast’s newest, tallest building is Q1, a gleaming steel-and-glass
tower. At the top of this stunning piece of architecture is the Q1 Obser-
vation Deck. From here, 230 meters (690 ft.) above the ground on levels 77
and 78 of the building, you can gaze down on all the Gold Coast has to offer.
A small theater in the Skyline Room shows a short film on the history of
the Gold Coast, or you can stop at the cafe for a piece of Q1-shaped cake
and a coffee. Head to Skybar for a cocktail just before sunset.

Sea World
Main Beach
Four polar bears — Lia and Lutik, and Canadian orphan cubs Hudson and
Nelson — are the star attractions at this marine park, where you can see
them frolic, dive, and hunt for fish in a large pool. The cubs are usually out
in the morning, and the adult bears in the afternoon. Sea World may not be
as sophisticated as similar parks in the United States, but it has all the
things you’d expect to see — performing dolphins and sea lions, ski shows,
an aquarium, shark feeding, and an array of rides. At Shark Bay, you can
see some of the larger and more dangerous species, such as tiger sharks.
You can snorkel with the sharks for A$60 (US$48/£24) per person (age 10
and over) or dive with them if you’re a certified diver for A$90 (US$72/£36).
Adults (age 14 and over) can participate in several hands-on “animal
adventures,” which include interactions with some of the park’s residents
(such as seals and dolphins) for prices ranging from A$135 to A$165
(US$108–US$132/£54–£66), which includes a souvenir photo. An hour-long
Dolphin Dive Encounter uses “ocean-walker” technology to allow guests
without dive qualifications to have a divelike encounter with dolphins. It
costs A$250 (US$200/£100) per person (you must be 14 or over). Younger
kids can attend a 30-minute dolphin talk, pat one, and have their photo
taken with one for A$90 (US$72/£36). A monorail makes getting around
the park easy, and there’s a free water-slide playground.

Wet’n’Wild Water World
Oxenford
If hurtling down a seven-story piece of fiberglass at 70kmph (43 mph) into
the water is your idea of fun, then this water park with rides that have
names like Double Screamer, Mammoth Falls, the Twister, Terror Canyon,
and White Water Mountain, is the thing for you. And if you just want to
cool off in a Queensland summer without the adrenaline boost, you can
stick to the four white-water flumes, float gently past palm-studded
“islands” at Calypso Beach, swim in the artificial breakers in the Wave Pool
or in the regular pool, or soak in a spa at Whirlpool Springs. There’s also
a water playground for young kids, and all pools are heated from April to
September. Every night in January, and every Saturday night from
September through April, is Dive-In Movie night, during which film fans
can recline on a rubber tube in the pool while watching the flick on a giant
screen.

WhiteWater World by Dreamworld
Coomera
This $60-million (US$48-million/£24-million) water park opened in late
2006. You won’t miss it as you drive the Pacific Highway. Themed around
Australian surf culture, it also has some of the most modern waterslides
and thrill rides in the world. The Super Tubes HydroCoaster is a “roller
coaster on water” and is one of two in the world; the Blue Ringed Octopus
(BRO) is the world’s only eight-lane Octopus Racer. For families, there’s
Nickelodeon’s Pipeline Plunge, a playground for kids ages 5 to 12. The

The Red Centre 
and the Top End

In this part . . .
U
luru (Ayers Rock) is one of the iconic sights of
Australia, and in Chapter 18, we tell you how to get
there and how to best see it. We also ﬁll you in on the other
stark natural wonders in the Red Centre of Australia, as well
as the small town at its heart, Alice Springs. This area is
where you ﬁnd many Aboriginal people, share their Dreamtime
stories, and learn about their traditional way of life.
The Top End is a vast sweep of sparsely inhabited country,
where you ﬁnd some of Australia’s most rugged, wild, and
unforgettable landscapes. In Chapter 19, we introduce you to
Darwin, the capital of the territory. Tall tales (usually true)
abound, and you’ll hear more than one great croc story. Then
it’s on to the outback town of Katherine and the wonders of
Kakadu National Park.

Chapter 18
The Best of the Red Centre
by Marc Llewellyn
In This Chapter
 Finding your way to and around the Red Centre
 Making your base in Alice Springs
 Choosing the best tours
 Exploring Kings Canyon, Uluru (Ayers Rock), and other natural wonders
T
he Red Centre is at the southernmost part of the Northern Territory
(see Chapter 19), though Alice Springs is 1,491km (921 miles) south
of the Northern Territory capital of Darwin. It also borders on South
Australia (see Chapter 20), but Alice is 1,544km (957 miles) north of
Adelaide.
In the middle of the Red Centre is the third of the “Big Three” sites:
Uluru (Ayers Rock), thrusting up from the barren Outback, drawing the
eye, as it has for thousands of years.
Uluru is why people come to the Red Centre, and we certainly think you
should see the iconic formation. You should also see the other amazing
natural wonders of the interior, like Kings Canyon and Kata Tjuta (the
Olgas), and visit in the Outback town of Alice Springs, perhaps spend
some time with the Aboriginal people who are caretakers of these
mysterious places.
Getting to the Red Centre
The gateway to the Red Centre is Alice Springs, the only large town in
central Australia. Alice Springs is 462km (286 miles) from Uluru. You can
see Uluru in a day from Alice Springs, but it’s an effort. We recommend
you spend a few days in Alice or at one of the Red Centre resorts.
By air
The only major airline that flies to the airports at Ayers Rock/Uluru
Airport and Alice Springs is Qantas (% 13 13 13 in Australia; www.
qantas.com.au).

There are daily flights from most state capitals to Alice Springs. You can
fly daily to Ayers Rock Airport from Perth, Sydney, Cairns, and Alice
Springs. Direct flights operate twice a week from Melbourne. Flights from
Darwin and Brisbane connect through Alice Springs to Ayers Rock
Airport. The flying time to Ayers Rock Airport from both Sydney and
Melbourne is three hours.
Ayers Rock Airport is just 6km (4 miles) from Voyages Ayers Rock
Resort. Coach transfers from Ayers Rock Airport to Voyages Ayers 
Rock Resort are free and meet every scheduled flight.
In Alice Springs, the Alice Springs Airport Shuttle, Gregory Terrace 
(% 08/8953 0310), meets all major flights. Transfers to your hotel cost
A$12 (US$9.60/£4.80) one-way, A$20 (US$16/£8) round-trip. A taxi from
the airport to town, a distance of 15km (91⁄3 miles), is around A$25
(US$20/£10).
By train
The Ghan train, named after Afghan camel-train drivers who carried
supplies in the Red Centre in the 19th century, makes the trip from
Adelaide to Alice every week, continuing to Darwin. The Adelaide–Alice
service (leaving Adelaide Sun and Wed at 12:20 p.m. and Alice Springs
Thurs and Sat) takes roughly 24 hours.
The Ghan departs Alice Springs for Darwin on Monday and Thursday at
6 p.m., arriving in Katherine on Tuesday and Friday mornings, and
Darwin in the afternoon. The service from Darwin departs on Wednes-
day and Saturday. Stopovers in Katherine last at least four hours. The
route is often treeless and empty, if fascinatingly so; don’t be concerned
that you’ll miss it by overnighting on the train. The train has sleeper
berths.
For fares and schedules, contact Great Southern Railway (% 13 21 47
in Australia, or 08/8213 4592; www.gsr.com.au), or see Chapter 2, for its
booking agencies abroad.
The Airport Shuttle (% 08/8953 0310) runs between the train station
and Alice Springs town center for A$5 (US$4/£2) one-way, A$8 (US$6.40/
£3.20) round-trip. A taxi costs about A$7 (US$5.60/£2.70) for the same
trip.
By bus
It’s a long journey, but you could go to Alice Springs by bus from either
Adelaide or Darwin. Greyhound (% 13 14 99 in Australia, or 07/4690
9950; www.greyhound.com.au) runs a 21-hour trip from Adelaide. The
fare is around A$220 (US$176/£88). The 21-hour trip from Darwin costs
about A$240 (US$192/£96). A daily five-and-three-quarter-hour run con-
nects with Uluru (Ayers Rock); the fare is around A$75 (US$60/£30).

The Red Centre
Chapter 18: The Best of the Red Centre 353

By car
Only a handful of highways and arterial roads in the Northern Territory
are paved. A two-wheel-drive car will get you to 95 percent of what you
want to see, but consider renting a four-wheel-drive for complete free-
dom. All the big chains have them. Some attractions are on unpaved
roads good enough for a two-wheel-drive car, but your car rental com-
pany will not insure a two-wheel-drive for driving on them.
Outside settled areas, the territory has no speed limit, but before you hit
the gas, consider the risk of hitting the wildlife: camels, kangaroos, and
other protected native species. Locals stick to a comfortable 120kmph
(75 mph) or less. Avoid driving at night, early morning, and late after-
noon, when ’roos feed; beware of cattle lying down on the warm bitumen
at night. A white road sign bearing a black circle outline crossed by a
diagonal black line indicates the point when speed restrictions no longer
apply. Make sure you have a full tank of gas before setting out.

Taking a tour of the Red Centre
Numerous coach, minicoach, and four-wheel-drive tour operators run tours that take
in Alice Springs, Kings Canyon, and Uluru. They depart from Alice Springs or Uluru,
offering accommodations ranging from spiffy resorts, comfortable motels, and basic
cabins to shared bunkhouses, tents, or swags (sleeping bags) under the stars. Most
pack the highlights into a two- or three-day trip, though leisurely trips of six days or
more are available. Among the reputable companies are the following:

AAT Kings (% 1800/334 009 in Australia, or 03/9274 7422 for the Mel-
bourne central reservations office; www.aatkings.com), which spe-
cializes in big-bus coach tours but also has four-wheel-drive camping
itineraries

Aboriginal Desert Discovery Tours (% 08/8952 3408; www.aboriginal
art.com.au), which is owned by Alice Springs Aboriginal people and
teams up its Aboriginal guides with Alice-based companies to offer tours
with an Aboriginal slant 

Alice Springs Holidays (% 08/8953 1411; www.alicesprings
holidays.com.au), which does upscale soft-adventure tours for groups

Connections (% 08/8252 5000; www.connections.travel), which
conducts camping safaris in small groups for all ages

Discovery Ecotours (% 08/8956 2563; www.ecotours.com.au), which
specializes in ecotours for groups

VIP Travel Australia (% 1800/806 412 in Australia, or 08/8956 2388;
www.vipaustralia.com.au), which offers luxury tours in limos,
minicoaches, and four-wheel-drives, with desert barbecues and cham-
pagne dinners

The Automobile Association of the Northern Territory, 79–81 Smith St.,
Darwin, NT 0800 (% 08/8981 3837), offers emergency breakdown serv-
ice to members of affiliated automobile associations and gives maps and
advice. It has no office in the Red Centre, though you can call the main
office for emergency breakdown service in the Red Centre. For a
recorded report of road conditions, call % 1800/246 199 in Australia.
Surviving the Red Centre
Secrets of the seasons
April, May, September, and October have sunny days (coolish in May,
hot in Oct). Winter (June–Aug) means mild temperatures with cold
nights. Summer (Nov–Mar) is extremely hot and best avoided. In
summer, limit your physical exertions to early and late in the day, and
choose air-conditioned accommodations. Rain is rare but can come at
any time of year.
Permits
If you plan to “go bush” in remote regions not covered by this guide, you
may need a permit from the relevant Aboriginal lands council to cross
Aboriginal land. This can be a drawn-out bureaucratic affair that takes
weeks, so plan ahead. The Northern Territory Tourist Commission,
Tourism House, 43 Mitchell St., Darwin, NT 0800 (% 13 61 10 in Aus-
tralia, or 08/8999 3900; www.ntholidays.com), can put you in touch
with the appropriate council. All good road maps mark Aboriginal lands
clearly.
Water
Always carry drinking water. When hiking, carry 4 liters (about a gallon)
per person per day in winter, and a liter (1⁄4 gallon) per person per hour
in summer.
Clothes
Wear a broad-brimmed hat, high-SPF sunscreen, and insect repellent.
Evenings can get cool, even in summer.
Alice Springs
“The Alice,” as Australians fondly dub it, is the unofficial capital of
Outback Australia. In the 1870s, a handful of telegraph-station workers
struggled north from Adelaide to settle by a small spring in what must
have seemed like the ends of the earth. Alice Springs, as the place was
called, was just a few huts around a repeater station on the telegraph
line that was to link Adelaide with Darwin and the rest of the world.
Chapter 18: The Best of the Red Centre 355

Today Alice Springs is a city of 27,000 people, with supermarkets, banks,
and the odd nightclub. It’s a friendly, rambling, unsophisticated place.
Many tourists visit Alice only to get to Uluru, but Alice has charms of its
own. The red folds of the MacDonnell Ranges hide lovely gorges with
shady picnic grounds. The area has an old gold-rush town to poke
around in, quirky museums, wildlife parks, a couple of cattle stations
(ranches) that welcome visitors, a couple of nice day trips to the sur-
rounding area, and one of the world’s top ten desert golf courses. You
could easily fill two or three days.
This is the heart of the Aboriginal Arrernte people’s country, and Alice 
is a rich source of tours, shops, and galleries for those interested in
Aboriginal culture, art, or souvenirs. There is a sad side to this story:
Not every Aborigine succeeds in splicing his ancient civilization with the
21st century, and the result is dislocated communities living in the
riverbed with only alcohol for company.
Orienting yourself in Alice Springs
The main street is called Todd Mall. Most shops, businesses, and restau-
rants are here or within a few blocks. Most hotels, the casino, the golf
course, and many attractions are a few kilometers outside of town. The
dry Todd River “flows” through the city east of Todd Mall.
Finding information after you arrive
The Central Australian Tourism Industry Association (CATIA) Visitor
Information Centre, 60 Gregory Terrace, Alice Springs, NT 0870 (% 08/
8952 5800; www.centralaustraliantourism.com), is the official one-
stop shop for bookings and touring information for the Red Centre,
including Alice Springs, Kings Canyon, and Uluru–Kata Tjuta National
Park (Ayers Rock). It also acts as the visitor center for the Parks &
Wildlife Commission of the Northern Territory. It’s open Monday
through Friday from 8:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. and weekends and public 
holidays from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. It also has a desk at the airport.
Getting around Alice Springs
 By taxi: Taxis tend to congregate at Todd Street and Gregory
Terrace. Or call Alice Springs Taxis (% 08/8952 1877). Taxi fares
tend to be quite high, so try to use other means to get around.
 By bus: Asbus (% 08/8950 0500) operates public buses departing
from the Yeperenye shopping center on Hartley Street. Bus no. 3
passes the School of the Air, several hotels, and caravan parks
along Gap Road and Palm Circuit.
The Alice Wanderer bus (% 1800/722 111 in Australia, or 08/8952
2111; www.alicewanderer.com.au) does a running loop of 12
town attractions every 70 minutes starting at 9 a.m., with the last
departure at 4 p.m. Hop on and off as you please, and enjoy the
commentary from the driver. The bus departs daily from the south

(US$32/£16) adults, A$30 (US$24/£12) kids 4 to 14. Call for free
pickup from your hotel. The ticket lasts for two days and you can
use it on nonconsecutive days.
Organized tours
The Alice Wanderer bus (see the preceding section) also runs full-day
tours to outlying areas, including to the West MacDonnell Ranges, a
stark but picturesque semidesert area with red gorges and occasional
swimming holes. It also goes to Santa Teresa Aboriginal Community,
where you can meet local Aborigines and view and purchase their 
artwork.
Many Alice-based companies offer minicoach or four-wheel-drive day
trips and extended tours of Alice and of outlying areas including the East
and West Macs, Hermannsburg, and Finke Gorge National Park.
Among the well-regarded ones are: Discovery Ecotours (% 08/8956
2563; www.ecotours.com.au) and Alice Springs Holidays (% 1800/
801 401 in Australia, or 08/8953 1411; www.alicespringsholidays.
com.au).
The Aboriginal Art & Culture Centre, 6 Todd St., Alice Springs (www.
aboriginalart.com.au), runs half-day tours with Aboriginal guides.
Staying in style
Alice’s hotel stock is not grand. Many properties have dated rooms and
modest facilities; they’re no match for the gleaming standard of Ayers
Rock Resort (see later in this chapter). You may pay lower rates than
those listed in the summer off season (Dec–Mar), and even as late as
June. Peak season typically runs from July through October or Novem-
ber. Parking is free everywhere.

Town Centre
A new addition to the Alice accommodations scene, Alice on Todd has nice
one- and two-bedroom apartments. It’s a good option, particularly if you
have kids (those under 4 years old stay free). The hotel overlooks the Todd
River and is just a short stroll from town. Each of the two luxury two-
bedroom apartments has an extra sofa bed. There’s a small outdoor 
pool, too.

This friendly, well-run, low-rise property is a three-minute walk from town
over the Todd River. Standard rooms are pleasant, while deluxe rooms are

it’s nice to head to the pool under a couple of palms after a hot day’s sight-
seeing. A fire glows in the Gumtree Lounge bar on winter evenings.

Outback
This working 1,515-sq.-km (585-sq.-mile) cattle ranch is a great place to get
a taste of Outback life with a real Aussie family. It’s 25km (16 miles) north
of Alice Springs, but in these parts that’s a short drive. Expect country din-
ners with the family and a choice of two cottages. The first is Corkwood
Cottage, which was built for the station’s head stockman and his family.
The main bedroom features a queen-size bed and each of the two other
bedrooms has twin beds and a single bed. There’s a comfortable lounge
and dining room, a fully equipped kitchen, and an outdoor BBQ. The
second cottage has a main bedroom with a queen-size bed and a second
bedroom with twin beds. There’s a lounge and dining room, which includes
a kitchenette. Gourmet breakfasts are delivered to both cottages. The
owners run a good range of day trips, overnight bush camps, and tours
throughout the Red Centre, making this a good base for exploring.

The only difference between this cheery family eatery and every other

the red-checked tablecloths and the basket-clad chianti bottles before, but
the food is surprisingly good. A long list of pastas, pizzas, and chicken and
veal dishes are the main offerings. It’s BYO wine.

the Araluen Centre (% 08/8951 1122), the town’s performing arts hub;
check out the “Honey Ant Dreaming” stained-glass window in its foyer. One
of Australia’s best-known indigenous artists is Albert Namatjira, who
painted the MacDonnell Ranges with startling accuracy. A collection of his
work can be viewed at the Albert Namatjira Gallery.
Aviation nuts may want to browse the old radios, aircraft, and wreckage in
the Aviation Museum, which preserves the territory’s aerial history.
You can buy stylish crafts, and sometimes catch artists at work, in the

Alice Springs Reptile Centre
Kids can walk around with pythons or bearded dragons on their shoul-
ders, at this Aussie reptile park. The easygoing proprietor lifts up the
cages’ glass fronts for better photos and lets kids hand-feed bugs to 
the animals at feeding time. Some 30 species are on display, including 
the world’s deadliest land snake — the taipan — and big goannas. Also
here are brown snakes, death adders, and mulga, otherwise known as king
brown snakes. Do not miss the saltwater crocodile exhibit featuring under-
water viewing.

Alice Springs Telegraph Station Historical Reserve
Alice Springs began life in 1872 as this telegraph repeater station, set by a
water hole amid red hills, gum trees full of parrots, and green lawns. An
oasis in the harsh landscape, it’s a place tourists often overlook. You can
wander around the stationmaster’s residence; the telegraph office, with
its Morse code machine tap-tapping away; the shoeing yard packed with
blacksmith’s equipment; and the stables, housing vintage buggies and sad-
dlery. May through October, “kitchen maids” in period dress serve scones
(biscuits) and damper (campfire bread) from the original wood-fired
ovens. There are several hiking trails leading from the extensive grounds.

Hiking the Larapinta Trail
The 223km (138-mile) Larapinta Trail winds west from Alice through the sparse red
ranges, picturesque semidesert scenery, and rich bird life of the West MacDonnell
National Park. This long-distance walking track is divided into 12 sections, each a one-
to two-day walk. Sections range from easy to hard. The shortest is 8km (5 miles), rang-
ing up to several 23km to 29km (14- to 18-mile) stretches. The Larapinta Trail begins at
the old Alice Springs Telegraph Station. Each section is accessible to vehicles (some
by high clearance four-wheel-drive only), so you can join or leave the trail at any of the
trailheads.
Camping out under a sea of stars in the outback is a highlight of the experience.
Although they vary, most campsites offer picnic tables and tent sites; all trailheads
have a water supply and some have free gas barbecues. The Parks & Wildlife
Commission of the Northern Territory office in Alice Springs (% 08/8951 8211) and the
CATIA Visitor Information Centre dispense trail maps and information. Check
www.nt.gov.au/nreta/parks/walks/larapinta for information on the trail
and maps. Warning: Always carry drinking water. The trail may close in extremely hot
summer periods.

Royal Flying Doctor Service
Alice is a major base for this airborne medical service that treats people
living and traveling in the vast Outback. An interesting 20-minute tour runs
every half-hour, featuring a video and a talk in the communications room.
Some of the recorded conversations between doctors and patients are
intriguing. There is a nice garden cafe and a gift shop.

when classes are in session; outside class hours, you may hear taped
classes. You can browse the kids’ artwork, videos, and other displays in
the well-organized gallery. Free 30-minute tours run throughout the day.

More cool things to see and do
Here are a few recommendations for things to see and do in town and a
little farther out:
 Worth a look is the Aboriginal Art & Culture Centre, 86 Todd St.
(% 08/8952 3408), set up by the Southern Arrernte Aboriginal
people. It houses a small, intriguing museum with exhibits on
Aboriginal life and displays a timeline of the Aboriginal view of his-
tory since “contact” (the arrival of Europeans). Admission is free,
and it’s open daily from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.
 You may not associate camels with Australia, but the camel’s ability
to get by without water was key to opening the arid inland parts of
the country to European settlement in the 1800s. With the advent
of cars, they were released into the wild, and today more than
200,000 camels roam central Australia. Australia even exports 
them to the Middle East! Frontier Camel Tours (% 08/8950 3030;
http://cameltours.ananguwaai.com.au) runs camel rides daily,
including sunset tours, with pickup from your hotel.

Kings Canyon
Anyone who saw the movie The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the
Desert will remember the stony plateau that the transvestites climb to
gaze over the plain below. You can stand on that same spot (wearing
sequined underpants is optional) at Kings Canyon in Watarrka National
Park (% 08/8956 7460 for park headquarters).
As the crow flies, it is 320km (198 miles) southwest of Alice Springs. The
sandstone walls of the canyon drop about 100m (330 ft.) to rock pools
and gum trees. There is little to do except walk the dramatic canyon rim
for a sense of the peaceful emptiness of the Australian Outback.
Getting there
The best way is to drive. Numerous four-wheel-drive tour outfits head
to Kings Canyon from Alice Springs or Uluru (Ayers Rock), with time
allowed for the rim walk.
With a four-wheel-drive, you can get to Kings Canyon from Alice Springs
on the unpaved Mereenie Loop Road. The regular route is the 480km
(349-mile) trip from Alice Springs south on the Stuart Highway, then west

onto the Lasseter Highway, then north and west on the Luritja Road. All
three roads are paved.
Uluru (Ayers Rock) is 306km (190 miles) to the south; from Yulara, take
the Lasseter Highway east for 125km (78 miles), then turn left onto
Luritja Road and go 168km (104 miles) to Kings Canyon Resort. The
resort sells leaded and unleaded gasoline and diesel fuel.
Taking an organized tour
AAT Kings (% 1800/334 009 in Australia, or 08/8956 2171; www.aat
kings.com) offers a one-day tour to Kings Canyon from the Ayers Rock
Resort for A$103 (US$82/£41) per person. You can book through AAT
Kings or the resort.
Exploring the park
The way to explore the canyon is on the 6km (33⁄4-mile) walk up the side
(short but steep!) and around the rim. Even if you’re in good shape, it’s a
strenuous three- to four-hour hike. It leads through a maze of rounded
sandstone formations called the Lost City, across a bridge to a fern-
fringed pocket of water holes called the Garden of Eden, and back along
the other side through more sandstone rocks.
If you’re not up to making the rim walk, take the shady 2.6km (11⁄2-mile)
round-trip trail along the mostly dry Kings Creek bed on the canyon
floor. It takes about an hour. Wear sturdy boots, because the ground can
be rocky. This walk is all right for young kids and travelers in wheel-
chairs for the first kilometer (1⁄2 mile).
Both walks are signposted. Avoid the rim walk in the middle of the day
between September and May, when it’s too hot.
Professional Helicopter Services (% 08/8956 7873; www.phs.com.au)
makes 15-minute flights over the canyon for A$115 (US$92/£46) per
person.

Uluru–Kata Tjuta National Park 
(Ayers Rock/The Olgas)
Uluru (Ayers Rock) is the Australia tourism industry’s pinup icon, a
glamorous red stone that has been splashed on more posters than Cindy
Crawford has been on magazine covers. You can put its popularity down
to the faint shiver up the spine and the indescribable sense of place it
evokes in anyone who looks at it. Even Aussie bushmen reckon it’s “got
somethin’ spiritual about it.”
This famous rock is in the middle of nowhere. The nearest town is Alice
Springs, some 462 km (286 miles) away. It’s 1,934km (1,199 miles) south
of Darwin, 1,571km (974 miles) north of Adelaide, and 2,841km (1,761
miles) northwest of Sydney.
In 1985, the park was returned to its Aboriginal owners, the Pitjantjatjara
and Yankunytjatjara people, known as the Anangu, who manage the
property with the Australian government. People used to speculate that
the Rock was a meteorite, but we now know it was formed by sediments
laid down 600 million to 700 million years ago in an inland sea and thrust
up above ground 348m (1,141 ft.) by geological forces.
With a circumference of 9.4km (6 miles), the Rock is no pebble, espe-
cially because two-thirds of it is thought to be underground. On photos
it looks like a big smooth blob. In the flesh, it’s more interesting — 
dappled with holes and overhangs, with curtains of stone draping its
sides, creating coves hiding water holes and Aboriginal rock art. It 
also changes color from pink to a deep red, depending on the slant 
of the sun.
Don’t think a visit to Uluru is just about snapping a few photos and going
home. You can walk around the Rock, climb it (although the local
Aborigines prefer you don’t), fly over it, ride a camel to it, circle it on a
Harley-Davidson, trek through the Olgas, eat in an outdoor restaurant,
tour the night sky, and join Aboriginal people on guided walks.
Part V: The Red Centre and the Top End 
366

The peak time to catch the Rock’s beauty is sunset, when oranges,
peaches, pinks, reds, and then indigo and deep violet creep across its
face as if it were a giant opal. Some days it’s fiery; other days the colors
are muted. At sunrise the colors are less dramatic, but many folks enjoy
the spectacle of the Rock unveiled by the dawn to birdsong.
Although not everyone has heard of Mount Olga (or “the Olgas”), a
sister monolith an easy 50km (31-mile) drive west of Uluru, many folks
say it’s lovelier and more mysterious. Known to the Aborigines as Kata
Tjuta, or “many heads,” the Olgas’ 36 red domes bulge out of the earth
like turned clay on a potter’s wheel. The tallest is 200m (656 ft.) higher
than Uluru.
Getting there
By air
Qantas (% 13 13 13 in Australia) flies to Ayers Rock (Connellan) Airport
direct from Sydney, Alice Springs, Perth, and Cairns. Flights from other
ports go via Alice Springs. The airport is 6km (33⁄4 miles) from Ayers Rock
Resort. Expect to pay around A$320 (US$256/£128) one-way. A free shut-
tle ferries all resort guests, including campers, to their door.
By car
Take the Stuart Highway south from Alice Springs 199km (123 miles),
turn right onto the Lasseter Highway, and go 244km (151 miles) to Ayers
Rock Resort. The Rock is 18km (11 miles) farther on. (Everyone mistakes
the mesa they see en route for Uluru; it’s Mount Conner.)
Avis (% 13 63 33 or 08/8956-2266; www.avis.com.au), Hertz (% 13 30
39 or 08/8956-2244; www.hertzcom.au), and Thrifty (% 1300/367 227 or
08/8956-2030; www.thrifty.com.au) have Uluru depots, both at the air-
port and in town. Thrifty charges around A$110 (US$88/£44) a day for
bookings under three days; Hertz charges A$137 (US$109/£55) a day for
bookings under seven days; and Avis charges A$137 (US$109/£55) a day
for bookings of two days or fewer. If you want to rent a car in Alice
Springs and drop it at Uluru, brace yourself for a one-way penalty.
Visitor information
For information before you leave, contact the Central Australian
Tourism Industry Association (CATIA), 60 Gregory Terrace, Alice
Springs (% 08/8952 5800; www.centralaustraliantourism.com), or
drop into its Visitor Information Centre in Alice Springs. One of the best
online sources is Ayers Rock Resort’s site (www.voyages.com.au).
The Ayers Rock Resort Visitor Centre, next to the Desert Gardens Hotel
(% 08/8957 7377), has displays on the area’s geology, wildlife, and
Aboriginal heritage, and a store. It’s open daily from 8:30 a.m. to 7:30 p.m.
You can book tours at every hotel at the resort.
Chapter 18: The Best of the Red Centre 367

Another option is the Ayers Rock Resort Tour & Information Centre
(% 08/8957 7324) at the shopping center in the resort complex. It’s
open daily from 7:30 a.m. to 8:30 p.m.
One kilometer (1⁄2 mile) from the base of the Rock is the Uluru–Kata Tjuta
Cultural Centre (% 08/8956 3138), owned and run by the Anangu, the
Aboriginal owners of Uluru. It uses eye-catching wall displays, frescoes,
interactive recordings, and videos to tell about Aboriginal Dreamtime
myths and laws. A National Park desk has information on ranger-guided
activities and animal, plant, and bird-watching checklists. It’s open daily
from early in the morning to after sundown; exact hours vary from
month to month.
Park entrance fees
Entry to the Uluru–Kata Tjuta National Park is A$25 (US$20/£10) per
adult, free for children under 16, valid for three days. The cost of many
organized tours includes the entry fee.
Getting around
Getting around the park is expensive. Ayers Rock Resort runs a free
shuttle every 15 minutes or so around the resort complex from 10:30
a.m. to after midnight, but to get to the Rock or Kata Tjuta (the Olgas),
you need to take transfers, join a tour, or have your own wheels. The
shuttle also meets all flights.
By camel
Legend has it that a soul travels at the same pace as a camel; going 
by camel is certainly a peaceful way to see the Rock. Anangu Tours 
(% 08/8950 3030; www.anangutours.com.au) makes daily forays
aboard “ships of the desert” to view Uluru. The one-hour rides depart
Ayers Rock Resort an hour before sunrise or one-and-a-half hours before
sunset, and cost A$95 (US$76/£38) per person, including transfers from
your hotel. All tours leave from the Camel Depot at the Ayers Rock
Resort.
By car
If you’re traveling with another person, the easiest and cheapest way to
get around is likely to be a rental car. All roads in the area are paved, so
a four-wheel-drive is unnecessary. Expect to pay around A$70 to A$95
(US$56–US$76/£28–£38) per day for a medium-size car. Rates drop a little
in the off season. Avis (% 08/8956 2266), Hertz (% 08/8956 2244), and
Thrifty (% 08/8956 2030) book four-wheel-drives through their Darwin
offices. All rent regular cars and four-wheel-drives.
On foot
A paved road runs around the Rock. The 9.4km (6-mile) Base Walk cir-
cumnavigating Uluru takes about two hours, but allow time to linger
around the water holes, caves, folds, and overhangs. A shorter walk is
Part V: The Red Centre and the Top End 
368

the easy 1km (1⁄2-mile) round-trip trail from the Mutitjulu parking lot to
the pretty water hole near the Rock’s base, where there is some rock art.
The Liru Track is another easy trail; it runs 2km (11⁄4 miles) from the
Cultural Centre to Uluru, where it links with the Base Walk.
Make time for the free daily 2km (11⁄4-mile) Mala Walk, where the ranger,
often an Aborigine, explains the Dreamtime myths, talks about Abori-
ginal lifestyles and hunting techniques, and explains the significance of
the rock art and other sites you see. The 90-minute trip leaves the Mala
Walk sign at the base of the Uluru climb at 10 a.m. May through
September, and at a cooler 8 a.m. October through April.
Before setting off on any walk, arm yourself with the self-guided walking
notes available from the Cultural Centre.
By helicopter
A top-class way to see the rock is from the air. Professional Helicopter
Services (% 08/8956 2003; www.phs.com.au) operates 15-minute
flights over Uluru for A$115 (US$92/£46) per adult. A 30-minute flight
includes the Olgas, and costs A$220 (US$176/£88). Kids under 13 usually
pay half-price (depending more on their weight than on their age).
By motorbike
Harley-Davidson tours are available as sunrise or sunset rides, laps of
the Rock, and other Rock and Kata Tjuta (Olgas) tours with time for the
Olgas walks. A blast out to the Rock at sunset with Uluru Motorcycle
Tours (% 08/8956 2019) will set you back A$145 (US$116/£58), which
includes a glass of champagne. The guide drives the bike; you sit behind
and hang on. Self-ride tours are available, too, at a hefty price. You can
rent a Harley for a half-day for around A$365 (US$292/£146).
By shuttle
Uluru Express (% 08/8956 2152; www.uluruexpress.com.au) pro-
vides a minibus shuttle from Ayers Rock Resort to and from the Rock
about every 50 minutes from before sunrise to sundown, and several
trips per day to the Olgas. The basic shuttle costs A$35 (US$28/£14)
adults, A$20 (US$16/£8) kids (including to see the sunset); a sunrise trip
costs A$60 (US$48/£24) adults, A$30 (US$24/£12) kids.
To the Olgas, it costs A$55 (US$44/£22) adults, A$25 (US$20/£10) kids. 
A three-day pass covering as many trips as you like to both sites costs
A$150 (US$120/£60) adults, A$60 (US$48/£24) kids. A combined Uluru
and Olgas trip costs A$60 (US$48/£24) adults, A$30 (US$24/£12) kids. All
fares are round-trip.
Guided tours
Several tour companies run a range of sunrise and sunset viewings, cir-
cumnavigations of the Rock by coach or on foot, guided walks, camel
Chapter 18: The Best of the Red Centre 369

rides, observatory evenings, visits to the Uluru–Kata Tjuta Cultural
Centre, and innumerable permutations and combinations thereof.
One of the best is Discovery Ecotours (% 1800/803 174; www.discovery
ecotours.com.au), which runs a five-hour base tour at sunset. The tour
costs A$115 (US$92/£46) adults, A$87 (US$70/£35) children 6 to 15. Note:
The tour is not suitable for kids under 10. The company runs a four-hour
sunset trip to the Olgas for A$84 (US$67/£34) adults, A$62 (US$50/£25)
kids.
Another great option is a tour with Anangu Tours (% 08/8950 3030;
www.anangutours.com.au). It’s owned and run by the Rock’s Aboriginal
owners, and the tours give you an insight into Aboriginal culture. Tours
are in the Anangu language and translated by an interpreter. They aren’t
cheap, but if you’re going to spend money on just one tour, this group is
a good choice.
The company does a Kuniya walk during which you visit the Uluru–Kata
Tjuta Cultural Centre and the Mutitjulu water hole at the base of the
Rock, learn about bush foods, and see rock paintings, before watching
the sunset. It departs daily March through October at 2:30 p.m.,
November through February at 3:30 p.m. With hotel pickup, the tour
costs A$99 (US$80/£40) adults, A$55 (US$44/£22) children.
There’s also a four-and-a-half-hour breakfast tour for A$119 (US$95/£48)
adults, A$79 (US$63/£32) children. It includes a base tour and demon-
strations of bush skills and spear-throwing. A standard tour during the
day costs A$75 (US$60/£30) adults, A$49 (US$39/£20) kids. Dot-painting
workshops at the Uluru Cultural Centre cost A$79 (US$63/£32) adults,
A$56 (US$45/£23) kids.
Staying in style
Not only is Ayers Rock Resort in the township of Yulara — it is the town-
ship of Yulara. Located about 30km (19 miles) from the Rock, outside the
national park boundary, it’s the only place to stay. The resort is an
impressive, contemporary complex, built to a high standard, efficiently
run, and attractive — all things you can end up paying an arm and a leg
for. Because everyone either is a tourist or lives and works here, it has a
village atmosphere — with a supermarket; a bank; a post office; a news-
dealer; baby-sitting services; a medical center; a beauty salon; several
gift, clothing, and souvenir shops; a place to buy beer; and a gas station.
You have a choice of seven places to stay, from hotel rooms and apart-
ments to luxury and basic campsites. In keeping with this village feel, no
matter where you stay, even in the campground, you’re free to use all
the pools, restaurants, and facilities of every hostelry, except the glam-
orous Sails in the Desert pool, which is reserved for Sails guests.

Money-saving Ayers Rock Resort tips

Prices tend to work out cheaper if you stay for more than one night.

Compare prices both on the Internet and with travel agencies. In my expe-
rience, people staying here have a paid wide range of prices for similar
packages.

High season is July through November. Book well ahead.

If you like wine, bring some with you, because it’s expensive here.

Emu Walk Apartments

These bright, contemporary apartments have full kitchens, separate bed-

Longitude 131
$$$$$
You can find this African-style luxury safari camp, with perfect views of
Uluru, in the sand dunes a mile or two from the main complex. It offers 15
top-class air-conditioned tents, each with a private bathroom and a bal-
cony overlooking the rock. The resort is promoting them as “six star.”
Whatever — A$9 million (US$7.2 million/£3.6 million) on 15 tents makes
them pretty expensive. A central facility, Dune House, holds a restaurant
(with superb food), bar, library, and shop.

The Lost Camel
$$$$
This AAA-rated 31⁄2-star hotel opened its doors in late 2002 on the site of
the resort’s demolished Spinifex Lodge, which once offered the best
budget deals outside the campgrounds. It’s aimed at young urbanites and
is as bright, crisp, and modern as something you might find in Sydney’s
Darlinghurst. (Don’t you just love that urban feel in the red dirt? You could
forget you’re in the Outback altogether.) The Red Camel offers lush court-
yards and a generous swimming pool. Bang goes that budget, though.

Sails in the Desert

Ayers Rock Resort
This top-of-the-range hotel offers expensive, contemporary-style rooms,
many overlooking the pool and six with Jacuzzis (though watch your head

can’t see the Rock from your room, but most guests are too busy sipping
cocktails by the pool to care. The pool area is shaded by white “sails” and
surrounded by sun lounges. The lobby art gallery has artists in residence.
The Kuniya restaurant serves elegant a la carte fine-dining fare with bush
tucker ingredients; Winkiku is a smart a la carte and buffet venue; and the

Chapter 19
The Best of the Top End
by Lee Mylne
In This Chapter
 Heading up top to Darwin
 Discovering “the Wet” and “the Dry”
 Experiencing Kakadu National Park
D
arwin is the capital of the Northern Territory (NT); it’s a frontier
town; small, rich, modern, and tropical. Bombed to bits during
World War II and comprehensively flattened by Cyclone Tracy on
Christmas Eve in 1974, Darwin is a hardy town — and so, often, are the
people who call it home. It’s a little bit edgy, a little bit wild.
Darwin is a laid-back, casual place where you’ll almost never need to
dress up. Shorts and sandals are de rigueur, and you’ll soon learn that
even the fanciest events require Territory rig, which means the men must
wear long pants and a shirt with a collar (but open-necked and usually
with short sleeves; no ties, please).
The population is around 100,000, with 80,000 living in the city and the
rest in the surrounding area. In fact, around half the population of the
whole Northern Territory lives within a 40km (25-mile) radius of Darwin.
Darwin is the gateway to Kakadu National Park. But allow a couple of
days to look around the city, visit its wildlife parks, and maybe do some
barramundi fishing. It’s also a good place to pick up authentic Aboriginal
art and South Sea pearls.
Stay away from the water. Crocodiles inhabit almost all waterways includ-
ing Darwin Harbour. You won’t outrun them, and the consequences of a
face-to-face with a croc don’t bear thinking about.
Getting There
Flying is the best way of getting to Darwin from almost anywhere else in
Australia. It’s at the end of the Stuart Highway, at least two, and probably
three, long days’ drive from Alice Springs in the south. Train and bus are
other options, depending on where you’re coming from.

Orienting Yourself in Darwin
Darwin is a small city. The city heart is the Smith Street pedestrian mall.
One street over is the Mitchell Street Tourist Precinct, with backpacker
lodges, cheap eateries, and souvenir stores. Two streets away is the har-
borfront Esplanade. In the Wharf Precinct, a short walk from town, are a
couple of attractions, a jetty popular with fishermen, and a working dock.
Cullen Bay Marina is a hub for restaurants, cafes, and expensive boats;
it’s about a 25-minute walk northwest of town. Northwest of town is
Fannie Bay, where you’ll find the Botanic Gardens, sailing club, golf
course, museum and art gallery, and casino.
After you arrive, you can pick up information from Tourism Top End,
which runs the official visitor center, on Knuckey Street at Mitchell Street,
Darwin, NT 0800 (% 08/8936 2499; www.tourismtopend.com.au). It 
can provide maps, bookings, national park notes, and information on
Darwin and other regions throughout the Northern Territory, including
Arnhemland, Katherine, and Kakadu and Litchfield national parks. It’s open
Monday through Friday from 8:30 a.m. to 5:45 p.m., Saturday from 9 a.m. to
2:45 p.m., and Sunday and public holidays from 10 a.m. to 1:45 p.m.
Getting Around Darwin
By bus
Darwinbus (% 08/8924 7666) is the local bus company. Unlimited
travel for three hours costs A$2 (US$1.60/£0.80) adults, A$0.50 (US$0.40/
£0.20) children. A Show&Go ticket gives unlimited bus travel for one
day for A$5 (US$4/£2); one week (valid Mon–Sun) for A$15 (US$12/£6).
The city terminus is on Harry Chan Place (off Smith Street, near State
Square). Get timetables there, or from the Tourism Top End visitor
center.
The Tour Tub bus (% 08/8985 6322) does a loop of most city attractions
and major hotels between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m. daily. Hop on and off as 
you like all day for A$25 (US$20/£10) adults, A$15 (US$12/£6) children 
4 to 12. It departs the Knuckey Street end of Smith Street Mall, opposite
Woolworths, every hour.
By taxi
Call Darwin Radio Taxis (% 13 10 08). Taxi stands are at the Knuckey
Street and Bennett Street ends of Smith Street Mall.
By car
You don’t really need a car to get around Darwin, but if you’d like to travel
on your own outside the city, for car and four-wheel-drive rentals, call
Avis (% 08/8981 9922), Budget (% 08/8981 9800), EuropCar (% 08/
8941 0300), Hertz (% 08/8941 0944), or Thrifty (% 08/8924 0000).
Chapter 19: The Best of the Top End 377

On foot
Darwin’s parks, harbor, and tropical climate make it lovely for strolling
during the Dry. The tourist office has a free map showing a Historical
Stroll of 17 points of interest around town. The Esplanade makes a short
and shady saunter, and the 42-hectare (104-acre) George Brown Darwin
Botanic Gardens on Gardens Road 2km (11⁄4 miles) from town, has paths
through palms, orchids, baobabs, and mangroves. Entry is free. Take bus
no. 4 or 6; the buses drop you at the Gardens Road entrance, but you
may want to walk to the visitor center (open 8:30 a.m.–4 p.m. daily) near
the Geranium Street entrance (open 24 hours) to pick up self-guiding
maps to the Aboriginal plant-use trails.
The 5km (3-mile) trail along Fannie Bay from the SKYCITY Darwin hotel
and casino to the East Point Military Museum is also worth doing. Keep
a lookout for wallabies on the east side of the road near the museum.
Secrets of the Seasons
The Top End — which includes the Darwin, Kakadu, and Katherine
regions — starts and ends the year with tropical thunderstorms and
monsoonal rains. This is called the Wet. Many Australians choose not to
visit during the Wet (Oct–Mar), when the humidity can be murderous,
with afternoon downpours the norm. The upside to this is that Darwin is
less crowded with tourists, and the pace is slower. The temperatures
can hit nearly 104°F (40°C), and cyclones may hit the coast, with the
same savagery and frequency as hurricanes hit Florida. Many people
find the buildup to the Wet, in October and November, when clouds
gather but don’t break, to be the toughest time.
Despite that, many people love traveling in the Wet. Waterfalls become
torrents, lightning storms crackle, the flooded land turns vivid green,
and there’s an eerie beauty to it all. If you plan to travel at this time,
keep your plans flexible to account for floods, take it slowly in the heat,
and carry lots of drinking water. Sleep in air-conditioned accommoda-
tions, and call ahead for tours, because some operators close.
Tropical thunderstorms from October to December can be memorable,
as can the rainfalls in January and February. For some, it’s not-to-be-
missed, so don’t discount traveling to the Territory at this time of year.
Towards mid-year (late Apr to Oct), the humidity levels drop and the
days are warm and sunny and nights are cool. This is called the Dry.
Cloudless skies and more comfortable temperatures are usual. This is
peak season, so book your hotels and tours in advance.
Part V: The Red Centre and the Top End

Staying in Style
Darwin has plenty of overnight options, from cheap hostels to modern
hotels with all the amenities. Hotels usually have their lowest rates from
November through March during the Wet. April through October is the
peak Dry.

Dining Out
For a remote and relatively small town, Darwin has some very good
restaurants. The food often has an Asian style to it, adapted by local
chefs, and you’ll also find “bush tucker” drawing on Aboriginal foods in
some more upmarket restaurants.
Cullen Bay Marina, a 25-minute walk or a short cab ride from town, is
packed with trendy restaurants and cafes.
If it’s Thursday, head to the Mindil Beach Sunset Market, where for just
a few dollars you can eat your fill from around 60 stalls offering Asian,
Greek, Italian, and Aussie food. There’s also live music, almost 200 arts-
and-crafts stalls, masseurs, tarot card readers, and street performers, or
you can just sit and watch the sun set into the sea. The action runs from

“Getting Around,” earlier in this chapter), goes by the markets.
On Saturdays mornings, head to the Parap Markets, which transform a
small street into a corner of Asia. The focus is on food, with a sprinkling
of arts and crafts, and it’s a favorite place for locals to have brunch,
choosing from the Southeast Asian soups, noodle dishes, and satays,
washed down with fresh-squeezed fruit drinks. The stalls cover about a
block, on Parap Road in Parap (% 0438/882 373 mobile).
Buzz Café
$$
Cullen Bay
CONTEMPORARY
This smart waterfront cafe is as well known for its “loo with a view” as it
is for its terrific food and relaxed atmosphere. The food is flavorsome East-
meets-West fare like jungle curry of chicken with snake beans and green
peppercorns, and pan-fried barramundi on potato mash in lemon-butter
sauce; the lamb shanks are so huge almost no one can finish them. Wash
it down with a cocktail, and then check out the men’s bathroom! Don’t be
shy, ladies — everyone does it, just make sure you get a man to take you
in there. It nudges out the women’s for interest value.
See map p. 381. Marina Boulevard, Cullen Bay. % 08/8941 1141. Reservations rec-
ommended May–Oct. Bus: 4 or 6. Main courses: A$17–A$30 (US$14–US$24/£7–£12).

THAI/NONYA/TANDOORI
Black walls and an Eastern atmosphere make this restaurant popular as a
business venue by day and as a rendezvous for couples, families, and more
business folk by night. You can rely on it for interesting dishes such as
roasted duck in a red curry of coconut, litchis, kaffir lime, and sweet basil.
There is a separate tandoori menu. Service is prompt and friendly.

Pee Wee’s at The Point
$$
East Point
CONTEMPORARY
Surrounded on three sides by forest, this gleaming venue has views of
Fannie Bay from just about every table, inside, out on the deck, or on the
lawn. The owners — two chefs and a sommelier — offer an extensive wine
list and the food emphasizes local produce with an Asian twist. An exam-
ple: miso-baked, locally caught, crisp-skin, saltwater barramundi fillet on
wok-charred choy sum, with kaffir lime and ginger fish cakes and a Thai-
style coleslaw with mango chutney. Get there in time to watch the sun set.

IRISH PUB FARE
Hearty Irish stews and braised beef-and-Guinness pies, washed down with
the odd pint of Guinness, get everyone in the mood for eating, talking, and
dancing at this convivial bar and restaurant. A friendly mix of solo trav-
elers, families, seniors, and backpackers eat and drink in atmospheric
wooden booths, standing up at bar tables, or by the fire. Besides hearty
meat dishes, there is lighter stuff including vegetarian dishes and a good
smattering of local produce. Try the “Taste of the Territory.” There are
daily specials and entertainment every night — bands, a quiz, or karaoke.

East Point Military Museum
East Point
Darwin was bombed 64 times during World War II, and 12 ships were sunk
in the harbor. The city was an Allied supply base, and many American
airmen were based here. The museum is in a World War II gun command
post. You can watch a film of the 1942 and 1943 Japanese bombings, and

armored vehicles, weaponry (old and new), and gun emplacements.

Museum and Art Gallery of the Northern Territory
Bullocky Point
The preserved body of Sweetheart, a 5m (16-ft.) man-eating saltwater croc
captured in Kakadu National Park takes pride of place here. This is a great
place to learn about Darwin in Australia’s modern history, with sections on
Aboriginal, Southeast Asian, and Pacific art and culture. A highlight is the
Cyclone Tracy gallery, where you can stand in a small, dark room as the
sound of the cyclone rages. We find it fascinating to wander in the maritime
gallery, which has a pearling lugger and other boats that have sailed into
Darwin from Indonesia and other northern parts.
Conacher Street, Bullocky Point. % 08/8999 8264. Take bus no. 4 or 6. Admission: Free.

Guided tours
Many companies run guided day-tours of Darwin. A half-day or one-day
tour is all you need, just to get your bearings and see the highlights,
depending on how much time you’re planning to spend in Darwin.
Reputable tour company AAT Kings (% 1300/556 100 in Australia, or
08/8923 6555; www.aatkings.com) runs an afternoon sightseeing tour of

Fishing heaven
The Top End is fishing heaven. The big prey is barramundi, or barra, as the locals call it.
Loads of charter boats conduct jaunts of up to ten days in the river and wetland systems
around Darwin, Kakadu National Park, and into remote Arnhemland. The Northern
Territory Fishing Office(%1800/632 225in Australia, or 08/8985 6333; www.ntfishing
office.com.au) is a booking agent for charter boats offering fishing day trips of almost
infinite variety — barramundi fishing, extended wetland safaris, reef fishing, light tackle
sportfishing, fly-fishing, and estuary fishing. A day’s barra fishing on wetlands near Darwin
costs around A$300 (US$240/£120) per person; for an extended barra safari, budget about
A$1,440 (US$1,152/£576) per person for a three-day trip.
If you simply want to cast a line in Darwin Harbour for trevally, queenfish, and barra,
the company will take you out for A$90 (US$72/£36) per adult (A$70/US$56/£28 for kids
under 12) for a half-day, or A$165 (US$132/£66) per adult (A$145/US$116/£58 kids under
12) for a full day. It also rents skipper-yourself fishing boats and tackle. Also check out
the fishing section at www.travelnt.com for detailed information on fishing tours,
guides, and everything you need to know to make your arms ache from reelin’ ’em in!

Aboriginal art
 For a good range of Aboriginal artworks and artifacts at reasonable
prices, check out Raintree Aboriginal Fine Arts Gallery, Shop 5,
20 Knuckey St. (% 08/8941 2732).
 For collectors looking for works by internationally sought-after
artists, visit the Aboriginal-owned Aboriginal Fine Arts Gallery,
on the second floor at the corner of Knuckey and Mitchell streets
(% 08/8981 1315; www.aaia.com.au). Its Web site is a useful
guide to art and artists.
 Maningrida Arts & Culture, 32 Mitchell St. (% 08/8981 4122;
www.maningrida.com), features works from one of Australia’s
largest Aboriginal artist’s cooperatives, based in Arnhemland. It
concentrates on traditional and contemporary arts, including bark
paintings, wooden sculpture, fiber craft, and prints.
 Karen Brown Gallery, in N.T. House, 22 Mitchell St. (% 08/8981
9985; www.karenbrowngallery.com), is also worth checking out.
South Sea pearls and jewels
The world’s best South Sea pearls are farmed in the Top End seas.
 Drool in the window, or go in for a closer look and to buy, at
Paspaley Pearls, off Smith Street Mall on Bennett Street (% 08/
8982 5515).
 The World of Opal, 52 Mitchell St. (% 08/8981 8981), has a 
re-creation of an opal mine in the showroom.
 If you fancy a pink diamond — the world’s rarest — you can get
them at Creative Jewellers, 27 Smith St. Mall (% 08/8941 1233),
which buys directly from the mine. It also stocks the champagne
diamonds for which Argyle is renowned and other Argyle diamond
colors, as well as South Sea pearls and opals.
Crocodile styles
For your own croc-skin fashion statement, head to di Croco, in the
Paspaley Pearls building in Smith Street Mall (% 08/8941 4470). You’ll
find bags, purses, wallets, card holders, belts, pens, and other acces-
sories, all made from saltwater croc skins farmed locally. And suddenly
the jokes about “snapping handbags” may make sense.
Living It Up after Dark
With a young population and lots of backpackers, Darwin’s city center,
around Mitchell Street, is the place to find nightlife. Cover charge for
most places is around A$5 (US$4/£2).

(see “Information,” earlier) or from the
Automobile Association of the Northern
Territory (AANT), 79–81 Smith St. (% 08/8981
3837; www.aant.com.au). See also the
Northern Territory Tourist Commission’s site
(www.travelnt.com), which has sections
designed specifically for those setting out on
a driving holiday.
Newspapers/Magazines
The local daily newspaper is the Northern
Territory News, which on Sundays becomes
the Sunday Territorian.
Pharmacies
There are several seven-day pharmacies
(also called chemists in Australia) in the
CBD. Bardens Pharmacies in the
Woolworths CBD Plaza, Cavanagh Street
(% 08/8981 8522), is open Monday through
Friday 8 a.m. to 8 p.m., Saturday 9 a.m. to 
5 p.m., Sunday 9 a.m. to 3 p.m.
Police
Dial % 000 in an emergency, or 13 14 44 for
non-urgent police matters (24 hours). For
general enquiries, call Darwin Police Station
(% 08/8999 5511). Police headquarters is on
Mitchell Street, Darwin.
Post Office

Restrooms
There are public toilets in Austin Lane, 
1 block behind the Smith Street Mall, open
24 hours, and on the Esplanade, near the
end of Peel Street, just inside the park.
Smoking
In the Northern Territory, you can still
smoke in most outdoor areas, including 
outdoor dining areas, such as a courtyard,
footpath, or balcony, depending on the
policy of individual restaurateurs. Smoking
is also permitted in certain areas of bars,
clubs, hotels, roadhouses, and casinos —
and in this, the Top End is alone in Australia,
where other states ban it. Smoking in most
public areas, such as museums, cinemas,
and theaters, is restricted or banned.
Weather
Two good Web sites are the Weather
Channel (www.weatherchannel.com.
au) and the Australian Bureau of
Meteorology (www.bom.gov.au).

Heading to Kakadu
Kakadu National Park is an ecological jewel, a sometimes lush, some-
times barren natural masterpiece. Kakadu, a World Heritage area, is
Australia’s largest national park, covering 1.7 million hectares (4.3 mil-
lion acres). You won’t see it all, but you should still plan to savor as
much as you can, spending at least one night in the area.
Cruising the lily-clad wetlands to spot crocodiles, plunging into natural
swimming holes, hiking through spear grass and cycads, fishing for bar-
ramundi, soaring in a light aircraft over torrential waterfalls during the
Wet season, photographing thousands of birds flying over the eerie red
sandstone escarpment that juts 200m (650 ft.) above the flood plain, and
admiring some of Australia’s most superb Aboriginal rock-art sites —
these are the things that draw people to Kakadu.
Some 275 species of birds and 75 species of reptiles inhabit the park,
making it one of the richest wildlife habitats in the country. But be aware
that the vast distances between points of interest, and the sometimes
monotonous outback landscape can detract from Kakadu’s appeal for
some. Wildlife spotting is not the breathtaking equivalent of an African
game park, where herds roam the plains — which is why even
Australians get excited when they spot a kangaroo in the wild.
Kakadu is derived from Gagudju, the group of languages spoken by
Aborigines in the northern part of the park, where they and their ances-
tors are believed to have lived for 50,000 years. Today, Aborigines
manage the park as its owners with the Australian government. This is
one of the few places in Australia where some Aborigines stick to a tradi-
tional lifestyle of hunting and living off the land. You won’t see them,
because they keep away from prying eyes, but their culture is on display
at a cultural center and at rock-art sites. Kakadu and the vast wilds of
Arnhemland to the east are the birthplace of the “X-ray” style of art.
The best time for wildlife viewing is the late Dry season, around
September and October, when crocs and birds gather around shrinking
water holes. Wildlife viewing is not particularly good in the Wet, when
birds disperse widely and you may not see a croc at all.
Getting to Kakadu
Follow the Stuart Highway 34km (21 miles) south of Darwin, and turn left
onto the Arnhem Highway to the park’s northern entrance station. The trip
takes two-and-a-half to three hours. If you’re coming from the south, turn
off the Stuart Highway at Pine Creek onto the Kakadu Highway, and follow
the Kakadu Highway for 79km (49 miles) to the park’s southern entrance.
Seeing the sights en route to Kakadu
Stop at the Fogg Dam Conservation Reserve (% 08/8988 8009), 25km
(16 miles) down the Arnhem Highway and 7km (41⁄3 miles) off the highway.

Kakadu National Park
Chapter 19: The Best of the Top End 391

You’ll get a close-up look at geese, finches, ibis, brolgas, and other wetland
birds from lookouts over ponds of giant lilies, or by walking through mon-
soon forests to viewing blinds. There are two lookouts on the road and
three walks, two of 2.2km (11⁄2 miles) round-trip and one of 3.6km (21⁄4
miles) round-trip. Entry is free. This is crocodile territory, so don’t swim,
and keep well away from the water’s edge. To take a ranger-guided walk,
you must book by calling % 08/8999 4555.
Four kilometers (21⁄2 miles) down the Arnhem Highway at Beatrice Hill,
you may want to stop at the Window on the Wetlands Visitor Centre
(% 08/8988 8188), a hilltop center with views across the Adelaide River
flood plain and displays and touch-screen information on the wetlands’
ecology. It’s free and open daily from 8 a.m. to 7 p.m.
Just past Beatrice Hill on the highway at the Adelaide River Bridge (look
out for the statue of a grinning croc), Adelaide River Queen Cruises
(% 1800/888 542 in Australia, or 08/8988 8144) runs the original jump-
ing crocodiles cruise. From the relative safety of a paddle steamer or a
smaller boat, you can watch wild crocodiles leap out of the water for
hunks of meat dangled by the boat crew — but don’t lean out too far! It’s
an unabashed tourist trap, with a souvenir shop that sells all things
croc, including crocodile toilet seat covers. It may not be very tasteful,
but because crocs typically move fast only when they attack, it may be
your only chance to witness their immense power and speed. The cruises
depart April through October at 9 a.m., 11 a.m., 1:30 p.m., and 3 p.m.,
and November through March at 9 a.m., 11 a.m., and 3 p.m. (closed Dec
24–25). The cost is from A$30 (US$24/£12) adults, A$20 (US$16/£8) chil-
dren 5 to 15, depending on which cruise and which vessel. Children aged
4 or under are not permitted on the tour. If you need transport, Darwin
Day Tours (% 08/8924 1111) and Goanna Eco Tours (% 1800/003 880
in Australia) both run tours from Darwin that include the cruise.
Finding information after you arrive
Both the park entrances — the northern station on the Arnhem Highway
used by visitors from Darwin, and the southern station on the Kakadu
Highway for visitors from Katherine — hand out free visitor guides with
maps. In the Dry, they also issue a timetable of free ranger-guided bush-
walks, art-site talks, and slide shows taking place that week. Entry to the
park is free.
You can get a lot of information at the Bowali Visitor Centre (% 08/
8938 1120), on the Kakadu Highway, 5km (3 miles) from Jabiru, 100km
(62 miles) from the northern entry station, and 131km (81 miles) from
the southern entry station. The attractive, environmentally friendly,
Outback-style center shows a program of one-hour videos on the park’s
natural history and Aboriginal culture, stocks maps and park notes, has
a library and displays, and has a gift shop and a cafe. Information offi-
cers are on hand to help you plan your visit (they provide tour times,
costs, and telephone numbers, but do not make bookings). It’s open
daily from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. You can also book tours and get information
Part V: The Red Centre and the Top End

Before you arrive, you can find information on Kakadu and book tours at
the Tourism Top End visitor information center in Darwin. You can also
contact the rangers at Kakadu National Park (% 08/8938 1100; www.
environment.gov.au/parks/kakadu).
Where to stay and dine in Kakadu
Rates at Kakadu hotels are usually lowest from November through March
during the Wet. High season is usually from April 1 to late October or early
November, the Dry.
A campground near Jim Jim Falls and Twin Falls has sites for 200 people.
Garnamarr Campground (named for the red-tailed black cockatoo com-
monly found in Kakadu) doesn’t accept reservations, so check at the
Bowali Visitor Centre (% 08/8938 1121) before driving there, to see if
it’s full. The campground manager collects the fee of A$5.40 (US$4.30/
£2.15) per person per night (cash only). A gate at the campground con-
trols access to Jim Jim and Twin Falls and is locked between 8:30 p.m.
and 6:30 a.m.

Green lawns and gardens with wandering peacocks and goannas and
native birds make this a restful haven. This property is near the northern
entrance to the park, which makes it the farthest accommodations from
attractions like Yellow Waters and Nourlangie, but many tour operators
pick up here. Don’t dive into the lily-filled lagoon down the back — like
every other waterway in Kakadu, it’s home to saltwater crocs! A 3.6km (2-
mile) nature trail winds from the hotel through monsoon forest and past
a billabong. All but the end rooms of these motel-style accommodations
have pitched timber ceilings, and all have views from a balcony or patio.
Budget rooms have two sets of bunks. All rooms are nonsmoking. There

Gagudju Crocodile Holiday Inn
$$–$$$
Jabiru
Built in the shape of a giant crocodile, this hotel is either grossly kitsch or
fabulously creative, depending on your viewpoint. The owners, the
Gagudju Aborigines, have designed the hotel in the form of their spirit
ancestor, a croc called Ginga. The building’s entrance is the “jaws,” the
two floors of 110 rooms are in the “belly,” the circular parking lot clusters
are “eggs,” and so on. The best way to make out the shape is from the air.
This hotel is one of the best places to stay near Kakdu, with basic but com-
fortable rooms and a range of amenities including a restaurant, two bars,
and a small swimming pool. Guests can use the town’s 9-hole golf course,
tennis courts, and Olympic-size swimming pool a few blocks away. The
lobby doubles as an art gallery selling the works of local Aborigines.

Exploring Kakadu
The only town of any size near Kakadu is Jabiru (pop. 1,455), a mining
community where you can find banking facilities and a few shops. The
only other real “settlements” are the park’s accommodations houses.
Kakadu is a big place — about 200km (124 miles) long by 100km (62
miles) wide — so plan to spend at least a night. Day trips are available
from Darwin, but it’s too far and too big to see much in a day.
Most major attractions are accessible in a two-wheel-drive vehicle on
paved roads, but a four-wheel-drive vehicle allows you to get to more
falls, water holes, and campsites.
Car rental companies will not permit you to take two-wheel-drive vehicles
on unpaved roads.
You can rent cars at the Gagudju Crocodile Holiday Inn, Flinders Street,
Jabiru; otherwise, rent a car in Darwin. If you rent a four-wheel-drive in
the Wet season (Nov–Apr), always check floodwater levels on all roads
at the Bowali Visitor Centre (% 08/8938 1120). The Centre, and attrac-
tions such as Nourlangie, Yellow Water Billabong, Jabiru, and Cooinda
usually stay above the floodwaters year-round.
The top attractions
Yellow Water Billabong
Cooindah
This lake, 50km (31 miles) south of the Bowali Visitor Centre, is one of
Kakadu’s biggest attractions and one of the best places to spot saltwater
crocs. It’s rich with mangroves, Paperbarks, pandanus palms, water lilies,
and masses of birds gathering to drink — sea eagles, magpie geese, kites,
Chapter 19: The Best of the Top End 395

china-blue kingfishers, and jaçanas (called Jesus birds, because they seem
to walk on water as they step across the lily pads). Cruises in canopied
boats with running commentary depart near Gagudju Lodge, Cooinda, six
times a day starting at 6:45 a.m. in the Dry (Apr–Nov) and four times a day
starting at 8:30 a.m. in the Wet (Dec–Mar). A 90-minute cruise costs A$43
(US$34/£17) adults, A$22 (US$18/£9) children 2 to 14. A two-hour cruise
(available in the Dry only) costs A$50 (US$40/£20) adults, A$25 (US$20/
£10) children. Book through Gagudju Lodge Cooinda (% 1800/500 401 in
Australia).
In the Wet, when the Billabong floods and joins up with Jim Jim Creek
and the South Alligator River, the bird life spreads far and wide over the
park and the crocs head upriver to breed, so don’t expect wildlife view-
ing to be spectacular.
Ubirr Rock and Nourlangie Rock
These are two of the best of the 5,000 or so Aboriginal rock art sites
throughout the park, though for cultural reasons the traditional owners
make only a few accessible to visitors. Some paintings may be 50,000 years
old. Nourlangie, 31km (19 miles) southeast of the Bowali Visitor Centre,
features “X-ray”-style paintings of animals; a vivid, energetic striped
Dreamtime figure of Namarrgon, the “Lightning Man”; and depictions of a
man in boots, a rifle, and a sailing ship. You’ll also find rock paintings at
Nanguluwur, on the other side of Nourlangie Rock.
Ubirr Rock is a steep 250m (820-ft.) climb, for art sites higher up the cliff
and for the views of the flood plain. It can be cut off in the Wet, but the
views of afternoon lightning storms from the top are breathtaking. Unlike
most sites in Kakadu, Ubirr is not open 24 hours — it opens at 8:30 a.m.
April through November and at 2 p.m. December through March, and it
closes at sunset year-round.
There is a 1.5km (1-mile) trail past Nourlangie’s paintings (short trails to
the art sites shoot off it), an easy 1.7km (1-mile) trail from the parking lot
into Nanguluwur, and a 1km (1⁄2-mile) circuit at Ubirr. Access is free.
More cool things to see and do
 Guluyambi East Alligator River Cruise (% 1800/089 113 in
Australia, or 08/8979 2411) focuses on Aboriginal myths, bush
tucker, and hunting techniques. The East Alligator River forms the
border between Kakadu and isolated Arnhemland. The cruise lasts
about 1 hour and 45 minutes, starting at 9 a.m., 11 a.m., 1 p.m., and
3 p.m. daily May through October. A free shuttle will take you from
the Border Store, at Manbiyarra just before the river, to the boat
ramp. It costs A$40 (US$32/£16) adults, A$20 (US$16/£8) children 4
to 14.
 Kakadu Fishing Tours (% 08/8987 2025 or book through Gagudju
Lodge Cooinda) takes you fishing in a 5m (17-ft.) sportfishing boat.
Tours depart from Jabiru, 5km (3 miles) east of the Bowali Visitor
Centre, and cost A$144 (US$115/£58) per person for five hours,
A$260 (US$208/£104) per person for a full day.
Part V: The Red Centre and the Top End 
396

 Warradjan Aboriginal Cultural Centre (% 08/8979 0145) at
Cooinda, has displays and videos about bush tucker, Dreamtime
creation myths, and lifestyles of the local Bininj Aborigines. The
building is in the shape of a pig-nose turtle, and has a gift shop sell-
ing items like didgeridoos, bark paintings, and baskets woven from
pandanus fronds. The center is open daily from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.
Admission is free. A 1km-long (1⁄2-mile) trail connects it to Gagudju
Lodge Cooinda and the Yellow Water Billabong.
Guided tours
A big range of coach, minibus, and four-wheel-drive tours and camping
safaris, usually lasting one, two, or three days, depart from Darwin daily.
These are a good idea, because many of Kakadu’s geological, ecological,
and Aboriginal attractions come to life only with a guide. The best water
holes, lookouts, and wildlife-viewing spots change dramatically from
month to month — even from day to day.

Kakadu from the air
They may be expensive, but scenic flights over the flood plains and the surprising 
rain-forest-filled ravines of the escarpment are well worth taking. They’re much more
interesting in the Wet than in the Dry, because the flood plains spread and Jim Jim
Falls and Twin Falls swell from their Dry season trickle to a roaring flood. Viewing it
from the air is also the best way to appreciate the clever crocodile shape of the
Gagudju Crocodile Holiday Inn. North Australian Helicopters (% 1800/898 977 in
Australia, or 08/8972 2444) operates flights from Jabiru from A$170 (US$136/£68) per

T
he City of Churches” as Adelaide, the capital city of South Australia,
is affectionately known, is a place of numerous parks and gardens;
wide, tree-lined streets; the River Torrens, which runs through its center;
sidewalk cafes; colonial architecture; and, of course, churches. It’s a
pleasant, open city, perfect for strolling or bicycling.
Though the immigrant population has added a cosmopolitan flair to the
restaurant scene, Adelaide still has a feeling of old England about it.
Adelaide was the only capital settled by English free settlers rather than
by convicts, and it attracted more of them after World War II, when Brits
flocked here to work in the city’s car and appliance factories.
But it was earlier immigrants, from Germany, who gave Adelaide and the
surrounding area a romantic twist. Arriving in the 1830s, German immi-
grants brought winemaking skills and established wineries. Today, more
than one-third of all Australian wine — including some of the world’s
best — comes from areas within about an hour’s drive from Adelaide. As
a result, Adelaidians are more versed in wine than even the French, regu-
larly comparing vintages and winemaking trends.
Any season is a good time to visit Adelaide, though May through August
can be chilly and January and February can be hot.

Chapter 20: Adelaide and the Best of South Australia

Orienting Yourself in Adelaide
Adelaide is easy to navigate because of its gridlike pattern, planned
down to each wide street and airy square by Colonel William Light in
1836. The city’s official center is Victoria Square, where you’ll find the
Town Hall. Bisecting the city from south to north is King William Street.
Streets running perpendicular to King William Street change their names
on either side; Franklin Street, for example, changes into Flinders Street.
Of these cross streets, the most interesting are the restaurant strips of
Gouger Street and Rundle Street, the latter running into the pedestrian-
only shopping precinct of Rundle Mall. Another is Hindley Street, with
inexpensive restaurants and nightlife.
On the banks of the River Torrens north of the city center, you’ll find the
Riverbank Precinct, the home of the Festival Centre, the Convention
Centre, and the SKYCITY Adelaide casino. Bordering the city center on
the north and south are North Terrace, which is lined with galleries and
museums and leads to the Botanic Gardens, and South Terrace.
Introducing the Neighbourhoods
 Glenelg: A trendy beach-side suburb south of the city center.
 North Adelaide: An area crammed with Victorian and Edwardian
architecture. The main avenues, O’Connell and Melbourne streets,
are lined with restaurants, cafes, and bistros that offer the tastes of
a multicultural city.
 Port Adelaide: A seaport, and the historic maritime heart of South
Australia. It’s home to some of the finest colonial buildings in the
state, as well as good pubs and restaurants.
Finding Information after You Arrive
Go to the South Australia Visitor & Travel Centre, 18 King William St.
(% 1300/655 276 in Australia, or 08/8303 2033), for maps, travel advice,
and hotel and tour bookings. It’s open weekdays from 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m.,
weekends from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. The info booth on Rundle Mall (% 08/
8203 7611) is open daily from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.
Getting Around Adelaide
By bus
Adelaide’s public bus network covers three zones, and fares are calcu-
lated according to the number of zones traveled. The city center is in
Zone 1. The fare in Zone 1 is A$2.20 (US$1.75/£88) weekdays from 9 a.m.
Part VI: The South and West 
404

to 3 p.m. and A$3.80 (US$3/£1.50) at most other times. Kids travel for
half-price. You can buy tickets on board or at kiosks around the city.
You can get timetable and destination information over the phone or in
person from the Passenger Transport Board Information Centre (% 08/
8210 1000; www.adelaidemetro.com.au), on the corner of Currie and
King William streets. It’s open Monday through Saturday from 8 a.m. to 
6 p.m. and Sunday from 10:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.
The free CityLoop bus (no. 99C) operates every 15 minutes (Mon–Thurs
8 a.m.–6 p.m., Fri 8 a.m.–9 p.m., Sat 8 a.m.–5 p.m.) around the city center,
along North Terrace, East Terrace, Grenfell Street, Pulteney Street,
Wakefield Street, Grote Street, Morphett Street, Light Square, Hindley
Street, and West Terrace.
Another free bus, the Bee Line (no. 99B), runs along North Terrace,
down King William Street to Victoria Square. Routes are well signposted.
All free city buses are wheelchair accessible.
The Adelaide Explorer bus (% 08/8293 2966; www.adelaideexplorer.
com.au; A$30/US$24/£12 adults, A$19/US$15/£7.50 kids 6 to 16, A$70/
US$56/£28 family) stops at 26 sights around town, including Glenelg. You
can buy tickets on the bus. The loop takes a leisurely three hours, with
commentary, and you can hop on or hop off as you want. The first bus
departs from 38 King William St., on the corner of Rundle Mall, at 9 a.m.
The company will pick you up from your hotel between 8 a.m. and 
8:30 a.m. if you call ahead, and will drop you off at the airport (with your
luggage) as part of the fare. Call or e-mail in advance. The last loop
starts at 1:30 p.m., ending at 4:30 p.m.
By tram
The Glenelg Tram runs between Victoria Square and the beachside
suburb of Glenelg from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. Tickets cost A$3.60 (US$2.90/
£1.45) for adults and A$1.60 (US$1.30/£0.65) for children 5 to 14. The
journey takes 29 minutes.

The major cab companies are Yellow Cabs (% 13 22 27 in South
Australia), Suburban (% 08/8211 8888), and Amalgamated (% 08/

raa.net), has maps and provides emergency breakdown services.
Chapter 20: Adelaide and the Best of South Australia 405

Staying in Style
Most of Adelaide’s hotels are central, though if you fancy a bit of a sea
change then you may want to head over to Glenelg. The journey to the
city center by car or tram takes less than 30 minutes, and the airport is
less than 10 minutes away. Add to this the sea, the lovely beach, the
amusement park, the great shops, the good pub, and the nice accommo-
dations, and you have a perfect place to relax on your holiday.
The South Australia Visitor & Travel Centre can supply information on
B&Bs and homestays around the state. Satellite and cable TV are rare in
South Australian hotels, though some provide pay-per-view movies.
The top hotels
Hilton Adelaide
$$$$
City Centre
The Hilton is a luxurious establishment around the corner from a host of
restaurants on Gouger Street and right next to the Adelaide Central
Markets. The lobby is polished marble with a cascading fountain and piano
music tinkling throughout. Guest rooms are pleasant, with all you might
expect from a classy establishment. The hotel has a good swimming pool
and a nice health club. In a pinch, we’d probably choose the Hyatt for the
extensive views, but there’s not much difference between them.

North Adelaide Heritage Group
$$–$$$
North Adelaide
It’s worth coming all the way to Adelaide for the experience of staying in one
of these out-of-this-world apartments, cottages, or suites. Each of the 21
properties in North Adelaide and Eastwood are fabulous. We recommend
the former Friendly Meeting Chapel Hall, once the headquarters of the
mouthwatering Albert Lodge No. 6 of the Independent Order of Oddfellows,
Manchester Unity Friendly Society, and the Court Huntsman’s Pride No. 2478
of the Ancient Order of Foresters Friendly Society. The structure — a small,
simple, gabled hall of bluestone rubble trimmed with brick — resembles a
small church. Built in 1878, it’s stocked with period pieces and antiques and
rounded off with a modern, fully stocked kitchen; a huge Jacuzzi; a queen-
size bed; and a CD player and TV.
Another standout is the George Lowe Esquire unit. The 19th-century apart-
ment is decorated with antiques and has a four-poster bed, a lounge, and
a full kitchen. Guests also have use of nice gardens. Owners Rodney and
Regina Twiss have added touches that make you feel at home, from maga-
zines piled everywhere to bacon and eggs in the fridge. The company offers
three apartments in the old North Adelaide Fire Station; the ground-floor
apartment comes with a full-size, bright red, fire engine. All properties are
within walking distance of the main attractions in the area.

A classic Adelaide photo is of trams awaiting passengers in front of the
Stamford Grand. Right on the beach, this classy hotel offers nice rooms
with modern furnishings; many overlook the beach, the ocean, and the
pier. This is a nice hotel, with a good indoor pool and health club. The Pier
and Pines is a popular bar with youngish crowds most nights; for a mel-
lower scene, Horizons piano bar delivers.

With more than 600 restaurants, pubs, and cafes, Adelaide boasts more
dining spots per capita than anywhere else in Australia. Many cluster in

you’ll find almost every style of cuisine. For cheap noodles, laksas, sushi,
and cakes, head to Adelaide’s Central Markets (% 08/8203 7494),
behind the Hilton Adelaide between Gouger and Grote streets.
Glenelg has a host of nice cafes, including Café Zest, 2A Sussex St. 
(% 08/8295 3599), which serves nice baguettes and bagels; and Café
Blu, Ramada Pier Hotel, 16 Holdfast Promenade (% 08/8350 6688),

The Grange
$$$$
City Centre
MODERN AUSTRALIAN
The Grange is an open-plan restaurant specializing in Contemporary food
by Adelaide’s most influential chef, Cheong Liew. Liew offers an innovative
fusion of Western and Asian ingredients, as well as an extensive wine list.
The menu begins with a choice of two starters, one of them Liew’s signa-
ture dish, “the four dances of the sea” — an antipasto of fish, octopus in
garlic sauce, prawn sushi, raw cuttlefish, and black noodles. For the next
course, you might choose baby abalone, lobster baked with bourbon and
lime, or Japanese quail with chestnuts and Chinese mushrooms.

Jasmin Indian Restaurant
$$
City Centre
NORTH INDIAN
This is a seriously good Indian restaurant. Prices have crept up as this
place has gotten more popular, but this family-run Adelaide institution is
still a good value. Indian artifacts and signed cricket bats from visiting
Indian teams decorate the walls. The atmosphere is comfortable yet busy,
and the service is professional. The special is very hot beef vindaloo, but
all the old favorites, such as butter chicken (a big seller), lamb korma, and
Malabari beef with coconut cream, ginger, and garlic are here, too. Mop it
all up with nan bread, and cool your palate with a side dish of raita. The
suji halwa (semolina pudding with nuts) is the best we’ve tasted.

Jolleys Boathouse Restaurant
$$$
City Centre
MODERN AUSTRALIAN
Jolleys is on the banks of the River Torrens, with views of boats, ducks,
and black swans. Businesspeople and ladies who lunch, rush for the three
outside tables, but if you miss out, the bright, airy interior, with its cream-
colored tablecloths and directors’ chairs, isn’t much of a letdown. You
might start with miso-crusted venison with grilled mushroom, mizuna
salad, and Japanese mustard sauce. Moving on, you could tuck into the
crisp-fried, tea-smoked duck, with Chinese spinach, and blood plum and
tamarind sauce. (Ignore the peaceful quacking out on the river if you can.)

FRENCH
This restaurant gives some of the best restaurants in Sydney and
Melbourne a run for their money. The place is a mix of stately elegance
and contemporary cool, with blacks and whites predominating. The food
is superb, particularly the duck and rabbit. Try the rabbit cooked three
ways — roasted loin, a small rabbit and mushroom pie, and braised rabbit
leg in a prune and almanac sauce. The starter of roasted pork belly is a
must. Book a table outside in the courtyard on a nice day. On Friday and
Saturday evenings, a minimum order of two courses per person applies.

On a narrow lane west of King William Street, this Italian trattoria is often
packed at lunch and less frantic in the evening. It’s big and bright, with

is very traditional and quite good. The chalkboard menu often changes,

Exploring Adelaide
Adelaide is a laid-back city. It’s not jammed with tourist-oriented attrac-
tions like some of the larger state capitals. The best way to enjoy it is to
take things nice and easy. Walk beside the River Torrens, ride the tram
to the beachside suburb of Glenelg, and spend the evenings sipping wine
and sampling some of the country’s best alfresco dining.
The top attractions
Adelaide’s Central Markets
City Centre
This is the largest produce market in the Southern Hemisphere. It’s a fabu-
lous place to shop for vegetables, fruit, meat, fish, and the like, although
the markets are worth popping into even if you’re not looking for picnic fix-
ings. It’s all a bit shabby, but fascinating.

The star attraction of this museum is the Australian Aboriginal Cultures
Gallery. On display is an extensive collection of utensils, spears, tools,
bush medicine, food, photographs, and the like. Also in the museum is a
sorry-looking collection of stuffed animals (sadly including a few extinct
marsupials, such as the Tasmanian tiger), a good collection of Papua New
Guinea artifacts, and excellent mineral and butterfly collections. If you’re
interested in learning more about the exhibits, take a Behind-the-Scenes

ance. A shop sells Aboriginal art and books on Aboriginal culture, and a cafe
on the premises serves several bush tucker (native food) items.

Living It Up after Dark
Adelaide’s nightlife ranges from twiddling your thumbs to getting nude
lap dances. For adult entertainment (clubs with the word strip in the
name) head to Hindley Street, where you’ll find a few pubs (though
none that we recommend). For information on gay and lesbian options,
pick up the Adelaide Gay Times.
Most pubs are open from 11 a.m. to midnight. For all-age pubs, locals
point you toward The Austral, 205 Rundle St. (% 08/8223 4660); The
Exeter, 246 Rundle St. (% 08/8223 2623); The Lion, at the corner of
Melbourne and Jerningham streets (% 08/8367 0222); and The British
Hotel, 58 Finniss St. (% 08/8267 2188), in North Adelaide, where you
can cook your own steak on the courtyard barbecue.
Also popular with visitors and locals alike is the Earl of Aberdeen, 316
Pulteney St., at Carrington Street (% 08/8223 6433), a colonial-style
pub. The Port Dock, 10 Todd St., Port Adelaide (% 08/8240 0187), was
licensed as a pub in 1864; it brews four of its own beers and pumps them
directly to its three bars with old English beer engines.

Wining and Dining in the Barossa
More than a quarter of Australia’s wines, and many of its top labels, 
originate in the Barossa and Eden valleys — known collectively as the
Barossa. Beginning just 45km (28 miles) northeast of Adelaide and easily
accessible, the area has had an enormous influence on the city’s culture.
Adelaidians of all socioeconomic levels partake in more wine talk than
the French. German settlers from Silesia, who came to escape religious
persecution, first settled the area. They brought their culture, their food,
and their vines. Today, there are over 50 wineries in an area that retains
its German flavor.
The focal points of the area are Angaston, farthest from Adelaide;
Nuriootpa; and Tanunda, the nearest town to the city. Each has interest-
ing architecture, crafts and antiques shops, and specialty food outlets. If
you’re adventurous, you may want to rent a bike in Adelaide, take it on
the train to Gawler, and cycle through the Barossa. Other options are
exploring the area by hot air balloon, motorcycle, or limousine.
The best times to visit the South Australian wine regions are in the
spring (Sept–Oct), when it’s not too hot and there are plenty of flowering
trees and shrubs, and in the fall (Apr–May), when the leaves turn red.
The main wine harvest is in late summer and early autumn (Feb–Apr).
The least crowded time is winter (June–Aug). Hotel prices can be more
expensive on the weekend.
Getting there
By car
Having your own wheels is by far the most flexible way of getting to the
Barossa. It takes around 75 minutes to drive from Adelaide to Nuriootpa
via the Sturt Highway. From Adelaide to Angaston, it’s around 90 minutes
via Springton.
Chapter 20: Adelaide and the Best of South Australia

By bus
Public buses run infrequently to the major centers from Adelaide. There
are no buses between wineries.
Various companies run limited sightseeing tours by coach or mini bus.
Adelaide Sightseeing (% 08/8413 6199; www.adelaidesightseeing.
com.au) offers a day trip from Adelaide, stopping off at three wineries. It
costs A$105 (US$84/£42) for adults and A$55 (US$44/£22) for children,
including lunch.
Getting information in the Barossa
The Barossa Wine and Visitor Information Centre, 66–68 Murray St.,
Tanunda, SA 5352 (% 08/8563 0600; www.barossa-region.org), is
open Monday through Friday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., and weekends from
10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Also check out www.barossa.com.
Touring the wineries
With some 50 wineries offering free cellar-door tastings, daily tours
charting the winemaking process, or both, you won’t be stuck for places
to visit. All wineries are well signposted. Here are a few of our favorite
places, but don’t be shy about stopping whenever you come across a
winery that tickles your fancy.
 Orlando and Jacobs Creek, Barossa Highway, Rowland Flat 
(% 08/8521 3000; open: daily 10 a.m.–5 p.m.), was established in
1847. It’s the home of many award-winning brands, including
Jacobs Creek, now sold worldwide. Premium wines include the
Lawson Shiraz and the Jacaranda Ridge Cabernet; new vintages of
either will set you back at least A$45 (US$36/£18) a bottle. The
winery has a restaurant and a picnic area with barbecues.
 Penfolds, Nuriootpa (% 08/8568 9290; open: Mon–Fri 10 a.m.–
5 p.m., Sat–Sun 11 a.m.–5 p.m.), is Australia’s biggest wine producer.
It churns out some 23 million liters (5.8 million gallons) from this
winery every year. The winery makes the famous Penfolds Grange,
arguably Australia’s greatest wine.
 Saltram Wines, Nuriootpa Road, Angaston (% 08/8564 3355; www.
saltramwines.com.au), produces some nice wines and also has a
great eatery, Salter’s Kitchen, which is open for lunch daily and for
dinner on Friday and Saturday evenings. When you taste the wine
here, compliment the experience with a tasting platter of good local
meats, wild olives, and dips. It’s open Monday to Friday from 9 a.m.
to 5 p.m., and weekends and holidays from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.
 Seppelts, Seppeltsfield (% 08/8568 6200; open: daily 10:30 a.m.–
5 p.m.), is located in a National Trust–listed property founded in 1857
by Joseph Seppelt, an immigrant from Silesia. On a nearby slope,
check out the family’s Romanesque mausoleum, skirted by planted
roadside palms, built during the 1930s recession to keep winery

 Yalumba, Eden Valley Road, Angaston (% 08/8561 3200; www.
yalumba.com.au; open: Mon–Fri 8:30 a.m.–5 p.m., Sat 10 a.m.–5
p.m., Sun noon to 5 p.m.), came into being in 1849, making it the
oldest family-owned winemaking business in Australia. It’s also
huge. Keep an eye out for the sad-looking Himalayan bear in the
corner of the large tasting room; its sad look can be attributed to a
run-in with a hunting rifle, and it’s been Yalumba’s advertising
symbol ever since.
Staying in style
Plenty of standard motels and lots of interesting B&Bs are located through-
out the Barossa, some with rooms for as little as A$60 (US$48/£24).
Weekends often find lodgings sold out and prices higher than on weekdays.
Collingrove Homestead
$$$
Angaston
In our opinion, Collingrove is the best country-house experience not just
in the Barossa but in Australia. Built in 1856, it was originally the home of
John Howard Angas, one of the initial settlers of South Australia. Additions
were made as Angas’s sheep business prospered. The hallway is festooned
with spears, artillery shells, rifles, oil portraits, and the mounted heads of
stags and tigers. English oak paneling and creaky floorboards add a cer-
tain nuance, and the cedar kitchen, library, dining room, and other places
burst with antiques and knickknacks. What the individually decorated
guest rooms lack in modern amenities (phones and TVs) they make up for
in charm. The modern communal Jacuzzi is in the old stables; there’s also
a flagstone-floored tennis court.

Marble Lodge

Wake up and smell the roses — there are plenty in the gardens surrounding
this historic property. Away from the main house is a lodge made of local
marble that holds two suites. The larger has two rooms and an open fire-
place. Both have access to the shared Jacuzzi (in 2007, this was temporarily
closed because of the drought) and are tastefully furnished in antiques.
Fresh fruit, homemade biscuits, and chocolates are always available in the
room, and it’s a five-minute walk to local restaurants. A double room in the
homestead, with shared bathroom, is sometimes available.

Blending your own wine at Penfolds
The Penfolds cellar door, in the heart of the Barossa, recently opened the country’s
first Make Your Own Blend tour.
When we took the tour, each of us was given a bottle of Grenache, Shiraz, and
Mourvedre to play with. According to Jenny, our wine instructor, the Grenache adds
a fruity character to a blend, the Shiraz gives depth and weight across the mid-palate,
and the Mourvedre grapes add complexity.
Blending the three varieties will, with any luck, result in a medium-bodied, well-balanced
wine with personality and structure. Or, most likely, it could end up being swamped 
and overbalanced. But still, because we were given such good ingredients, it should be
drinkable.
Jenny gave us the rundown of the previous year’s blend, so we could get an idea of a
successful mix of each grape variety, and then warned us that each year’s vintage is
crafted differently. One of the beakers in front of us contained a sample of the 2006
vintage. We sniffed and tasted, and were then set loose.
Pouring from each bottle, we measured the amounts from each grape variety with
care. We noted our percentages on the score sheet and tasted the result. It was noth-
ing like the vintage we were trying to emulate, but it tasted okay, so we gulped down
the lot.
Our second attempt was more successful, and we ended up drinking that, too. By then,
we were all pretty animated and, like mad scientists, we cackled to ourselves and
churned out greater quantities to share around.
By the third attempt, everything tasted good. One of us drank straight from her test
tube, having run out of glasses, and the others joined in with glee.
In the end, our score sheets looked as messy as an artist’s palette, and our once-white
coats were splattered with red. Perhaps winemaking really is art rather than science.
We decanted our favorite blend into a half-size wine bottle and, once capped, were
given a Penfolds label that bears our names and the title “assistant winemaker.”
The Penfolds Make Your Own Blend tour costs A$55 (US$44/£22) per person. Bookings,
made at least 24 hours in advance, are essential. Call % 08/8568 9408 or visit www.

Dining in the Barossa
The Barossa prides itself on its cuisine as well as its wine, so you’ll find
plenty of places of note, many serving traditional German food:
 A hot spot for lunch or dinner is Vintner’s Bar & Grill, Nuriootpa
Road, Angaston (% 08/8564 2488); the wine list is six pages long!
Main courses cost A$22 to A$27 (US$18–US$22/£9–£11). It’s open
daily for lunch and Monday through Saturday for dinner.
 Another choice is Salters, Satram Winery, Nuriootpa Road,
Angaston (% 08/8564 3344), where local produce is the specialty,
with main courses such as slow-roasted baby pork, milk-fed lamb,
and crisp-based pizzas. Main courses are A$20 to A$26 (US$16–
US$21/£8–£11). It’s open daily for lunch and Wednesday through
Saturday for dinner from 6 p.m.
 Perhaps the best German-style bakery in the valley is the Lyndoch
Bakery, on the Barossa Highway, Lyndoch (% 08/8524 4422).
 In Angaston, stop off at The Seasons of the Valley, 6 Washington St.
(% 08/8564 3688). The 1840 homestead house has cottage gardens
and a veranda, as well as delicious meals for A$15 to A$18 (US$12–
US$14/£6–£7). It’s open daily 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.
Hahndorf: Just Like the Old Country
This historic German-style village is one of South Australia’s most popu-
lar tourist destinations. Lutherans fleeing religious persecution in east-
ern Prussia founded the town, 29km (18 miles) southeast of Adelaide, in
1839. They brought their winemaking skills, foods, and architectural
inheritance, and put it all together. Hahndorf still resembles a small
German town and is included on the World Heritage List as a Historical
German Settlement. Walking around, you’ll see St. Paul’s Lutheran
Church, erected in 1890. The Wool Factory, L’Unique Fine Arts & Craft,
and Bamfurlong Fine Crafts are worth checking out and are within walk-
ing distance of Main Street.

Staying in style
The Hahndorf Resort
This large resort has a variety of accommodations as well as a number of
trailer and tent sites. Lodgings include air-conditioned cabins, and motel-
style rooms with queen-size beds and showers. The chalets look as if
they’re straight out of Bavaria; each can accommodate two to five people
in one or two bedrooms. Each has a full kitchen and an attached bathroom
with shower; some of them overlook a small lake. The larger spa chalets
come with Jacuzzis. An on-site animal sanctuary has a few emus, kanga-
roos, and horses. The resort has an outdoor pool, too.

Dining out
If you want a treat, head to the Bridgewater Mill, Mt. Barker Road,
Bridgewater (% 08/8339 3422; www.bridgewatermill.com.au). In an
impressive 1860s stone building with a terrace near a water wheel, this
place serves some of the best-regarded food in the country. Try duck
with braised cherries. Main courses cost A$33 (US$26/£13); a three-
course menu, served Sunday only, is A$85 (US$68/£34). It’s open
Thursday through Monday for lunch.
Meeting Marsupials on Kangaroo Island
You won’t find anyplace better than Kangaroo Island to see Australian
marsupials in the wild. Spend a few days with the right guide and you
can walk along a beach past a colony of sea lions; spot hundreds of New
Zealand fur seals playing; creep through the bush on the trail of walla-
bies or kangaroos; spot sea eagles, black swans, sacred ibis, pelicans,
little penguins, the rare glossy black cockatoo, and other birds; come
across goannas; pick out bunches of koalas hanging sleepily in the trees
above your head; and, if you’re lucky, see platypus, echidna, bandicoots,
and reclusive pygmy possums — the list goes on.
The secrets to Kangaroo Island’s success are its perfect conditions, the
most important of which is the fact that there are no introduced foxes or
rabbits to prey on the native inhabitants or their environment. The
island was also never colonized by the dingo (Australia’s “native” dog),
which is believed to have been introduced from Asia some 4,000 years
ago. Today, about one-third of the island is national park.
Although the animals are what most people come to see, no one goes
away without being impressed by the scenery. Kangaroo Island has low
mallee scrubland, dense eucalyptus forests, rugged coastal scenery,

beaches, caves, lagoons, and blackwater swamps. The effect of 150 years
of European colonization has taken its toll. In South Australia as a whole,
some 27 mammal, 5 bird, 1 reptile, and 30 plant species have become
extinct since British explorer Matthew Flinders arrived in 1802.
The best time to visit Kangaroo Island is between November and March
(though you’ll have difficulty finding accommodations over the Christmas
holiday period). July and August tend to be rainy, and winter can be cold
(though often milder than on the mainland around Adelaide).
Many companies offer day trips to Kangaroo Island from Adelaide, but
we recommend tailoring your holiday to spend at least two days here —
three or even five days would be better. The island really does have a lot
to see, and you won’t regret spending the extra time.

Kingscote from Adelaide’s General Aviation Terminal, four times daily.
By ferry
If you prefer to go by sea, Kangaroo Island SeaLink (% 13 13 01 in
Australia, or 08/8202 8688; www.sealink.com.au) operates two ferries
three times daily at 9 a.m., 10 a.m., and 6 p.m. (and on the hour from 
Chapter 20: Adelaide and the Best of South Australia

9 a.m. to 7 p.m. in peak periods) from Cape Jervis on the tip of the
Fleurieu Peninsula on the mainland to Penneshaw on Kangaroo Island.
The trip takes 40 minutes and costs A$80 (US$64/£32) round-trip for
adults, A$44 (US$35/£18) for children 3 to 14, and A$162 (US$129/£65)

Adelaide hotel pickups for selected tours.
Visitor information
Tourism Kangaroo Island, Gateway Information Centre, Howard Drive
(P.O. Box 336), Penneshaw, Kangaroo Island, SA 5222 (% 08/8553 1185;
www.tourkangarooisland.com.au), has plenty of maps and can assist
with accommodations and tour information.
For more information on the island’s national parks, contact National
Parks and Wildlife South Australia (NP&WSA), 39 Dauncey St., P.O. Box
39, Kingscote, SA 5223 (% 08/8553 2381). It’s open Monday through
Friday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.
Island layout
Kangaroo Island is 156km (97 miles) long and 57km (35 miles) wide at its
widest point. The distance across the narrowest point is 2km (11⁄4 miles).
Approximately 3,900 people live there. More than half live on the north-
east coast in the three main towns: Kingscote (pop. 1,800), Penneshaw
(pop. 250), and American River (pop. 200).
 American River: Popular with fishermen, American River is 37km
(23 miles) from Kingscote. It lacks a beach but offers black swans
on Pelican Lagoon. Wild wallabies abound, and egrets, magpies,
and cockatoos offer early wake-up calls.
 Kingscote: On the shores of the beautiful Nepean Bay, Kingscote is
the commercial and business hub of the island. You’ll find banks,
ATMs, shops, and a boat-studded harbor.
 Penneshaw: On the northeast coast of the island, the pretty sea-
side village of Penneshaw acts as the port for SeaLink ferries.
Plenty of accommodations options are here.
 Parndana: Developed by soldier settlers after World War II,
Parndana is a rural service center 25 minutes by car from Seal Bay
Part VI: The South and West 
424

and Stokes Bay. It’s just around the corner from Parndana Wildlife
Park, which has more than 50 aviaries with collections of native
and other birds, some of them rare and protected.
Getting around Kangaroo Island
Kangaroo Island is a big place, and apart from twice-daily SeaLink bus
service, which connects Kingscote, Penneshaw, and American River,
there is no public transport. Although you can get a lot out of the tours,
we recommend renting a car.
By shuttle bus
The Airport Shuttle Service (% 1800/750 850 in Australia) meets all
flights to Kangaroo Island and takes passengers to Kingscote, Emu Bay,
and American River. Book the return trip from your accommodations to
the airport in advance.
By car
Major roads between Penneshaw, American River, Kingscote, and
Parndana are paved, as are the road to Seal Bay and all major roads
within Flinders Chase National Park. Most other roads are made of iron-
stone gravel, and can be slippery if you take the corners too quickly. All
roads are accessible by two-wheel-drive vehicles. If you’re in a rental car
from the mainland, make sure your policy allows you to drive on
Kangaroo Island. Avoid driving at night — animals are all about.
Car rental agencies on the island include Budget (% 08/8553 3133;
www.budgetki.com), Hertz & Kangaroo Island Rental Cars (% 1800/
088 296 in Australia, or 08/8553 2390; www.hertz.com.au), and Wheels
over Kangaroo Island (% 1800/750 850 in Australia, or 08/8553 3030;
www.kangarooislandholidays.com). You can pick up cars at the air-
port or ferry terminals.
Organized tours
If you want to keep expenses down, you can’t go wrong with one of the
tours organized by Kangaroo Island Ferry Connections (% 08/8202
8688; www.sealink.com.au). The most popular includes afternoon
pickup from the main bus station in Adelaide, coach and ferry to the
island, a penguin tour that evening, and dorm accommodations (you can
upgrade to a double room or a hotel). The next day involves ten hours of
touring, taking in most of the main attractions. That evening you return
to Adelaide. The tour costs A$302 (US$242/£121).
If you make your own way to the island, you can join one of several day
tours, departing Penneshaw or American River Thursday, Saturday,
Sunday, Monday, and Wednesday, also stopping off at many of the main
attractions. The tour costs A$119 (US$95/£48) for adults and A$86
(US$69/£35) for children 3 to 14 years old.
Chapter 20: Adelaide and the Best of South Australia 425

More expensive options include Kangaroo Island Wilderness Tours
(% 08/8559 5033; www.wildernesstours.com.au), which operates
from the island with several small four-wheel-drive vehicles (maximum
six people). Three different day trips cost A$334 to A$365 (US$267–
US$292/£134–£146) per person, including transfers, an excellent lunch
with wine, and park entry fees. Two-, three-, and four-day trips, including
all meals and accommodations, cost A$829 (US$663/£332), A$1,323
(US$1,058/£524), and A$1,818 (US$1,454/£727) per person, respectively.
Another excellent operator on the island is Adventure Charters of
Kangaroo Island (% 08/8553 9119; www.adventurecharters.com.
au). Day trips cost A$340 (US$272/£136) with a big lunch, or A$648
(US$518/£260) for a one-day safari including flights from and to Adelaide.
A two-day and one night safari including accommodations and flights
costs A$1,230 (US$984/£492).
Another option is Wayward Bus (% 08/8410 8833; www.waywardbus.
com.au) from Adelaide. Two-day trips depart daily between December
and March, with fewer departures at other times, and cost A$380 (US$304/
£152) in a hostel bunk or A$410 (US$328/£164) twin/double in a shared
room.
Staying in style
The island has a wide variety of places, from B&Bs to campgrounds:
 If you feel like sleeping in one of 40 cottages or coastal lodgings, con-
tact Kangaroo Island Remote and Coastal Farm Accommodation
(% 08/8553 1233). Prices range from A$65 to A$100 (US$52–US$80/
£26–£40). The staff can also arrange lodgings in local farms, homes,
and B&Bs for A$60 to A$110 (US$48–US$88/£24–£44) for a double
with breakfast.
 The NP&WSA also rents basic but comfortable lodgings, includ-
ing relatively isolated lighthouse cottages (% 08 8559 7235;
kiparksaccom@saugov.sa.gov.au) at Cape Willoughby, Cape
Borda, Rocky River, and Cape du Couedic. The price is A$95 to
A$140 (US$76–US$112/£38–£56) per night.
 If you’re on a tight budget, head to the Penneshaw Youth Hostel,
43 North Terrace, Penneshaw, Kangaroo Island, SA 5222 (% 08/
8553 1284; fax 08/8553 1295), with dorm beds for A$22 (US$18/£9)
and doubles for A$72 (US$57/£29). It costs a few dollars less for
YHA/Hostelling International members.
 Camping is allowed at designated sites and in national parks. There
are many beach, river, and bush camping spots. Call % 08 8559
7235 to book. Camping costs A$8 to A$19 (US$6.40–US$15/£3.20–
£7.50) per car and A$4 to A$5.50 (US$3.20–US$4.40/£1.60–£2.20) per

Though Kangaroo Island Lodge was built in 1801, it has been so overhauled
that you’d be hard pressed to find anything rustic remaining. It’s a nicely
appointed property with pleasant, quiet, motel-style rooms; a good pool;
a Jacuzzi; a sauna; and a restaurant and bar (entrees average A$20/US$16/
£8). Some units contain kitchens. The lodge looks over Pelican Lagoon
(famous for its, well, pelicans), but the lagoon is a little too far away to
make the water-view rooms worthwhile. Packages (which require a mini-
mum two-night stay) include the ferry connection to Cape Jervis, and
breakfast each day.

Dining locally
Most accommodations on Kangaroo Island provide meals for guests
(usually at an additional cost). You’ll find a few takeout booths around
the island at the popular tourist spots. For lunch, you can get sand-
wiches at Roger’s Deli on Dauncey Street, in Kingscote.

LOCAL PRODUCE
This restaurant perches on a cliff on the eastern tip of the island, next to
Cape Willoughby Lighthouse, about 30km (19 miles) from Penneshaw. One
wall is all glass, and the veranda affords ocean views. The restaurant
serves as a way to sell the local wine, by the bottle or the glass, but some
good food is available, including a plastic bucket full of ice and cooked
prawns, cheese plates, dips, and a Mediterranean platter of nibbles.

A$15–A$20 (US$12–US$16/£6–£8). MC, V. Open: Daily 10a.m.–4 p.m. for coffee and
cakes, 12:30–2:30 p.m. for lunch.
The top attractions
Cape du Couedic
Millions of years of crashing ocean have created curious structures, like
the hollowed-out limestone promontory called Admiral’s Arch and the
Remarkable Rocks, where you’ll see huge boulders balancing on top of a
massive granite dome. Admiral’s Arch is home to a colony of some 4,000
New Zealand fur seals.
A paved road leads from Rocky River Park Headquarters to Admiral’s
Arch and Remarkable Rocks, where a parking lot and a loop trail are
located. There’s a road, parking lot, and trail system around the Cape du
Couedic heritage lighthouse district.
Flinders Chase National Park
After years of lobbying, politicians finally agreed to preserve this region
of the island in 1919. Today, it makes up around 17 percent of the island
and is home to true wilderness, coastal scenery, two old lighthouses,
and plenty of animals. Birders have recorded at least 243 species here.
Koalas are so common that they’re almost falling out of the trees.
The Platypus Waterholes walk is a two-hour stroll that’s great for all
ages. It begins at the Flinders Chase Visitors Centre and has a shorter
option that’s suitable for wheelchairs. This walk offers the best opportu-
nity to see the elusive platypus. Kangaroos, wallabies, and brush-tailed
possums, on the other hand, are so tame and numerous that the authori-
ties were forced to erect a barrier around the Rocky River Campground
to stop them from carrying away picnickers’ sandwiches!
Lathami Conservation Park
This park is a wonderful place to see wallabies in the wild. Just dip
under the low canopy of casuarina pines and walk silently, keeping your
eyes peeled. You’re almost certain to spot them.
Part VI: The South and West 
428

Penneshaw Penguin Centre
If you want to see little penguins — tiny animals that stand just 33cm
(13 in.) tall — you can see them in a natural environment coming home
to roost in their burrows at dusk. The Penneshaw Penguin Centre, Lloyd
Collins Reserve, Penneshaw (% 08/8553 1103), supports the largest
penguin colony on the island. Tours depart between 7:30 p.m. and 
8:30 p.m. in winter, and 8:30 p.m. to 9:30 p.m. in summer.
Seal Bay Conservation Park
You shouldn’t miss out on the experience of walking through a colony of
Australian sea lions. Some 100,000 people visit Seal Bay Conservation
Park each year. Boardwalks through the dunes reduce the impact of so
many feet. The colony consists of about 500 animals, but at any one time
you may see up to 100 basking with their pups. Guided tours are given
daily every 15 to 30 minutes from 9 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. for A$14 (US$11/
£5.50) for adults and A$8 (US$6.40/£3.20) for children. For information,
call % 08/8559 4207.
More cool things to see and do
 Kangaroo Island is renowned for its fresh food, and across the
island you’ll see signs beckoning to you to have a taste of cheese,
honey, wine, or the like. Worth a stop is Clifford’s Honey Farm 
(% 08/8553 8295; open: daily 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.). The farm is the
home of the Ligurian honeybee, found nowhere else on earth.
 Island Pure Sheep Dairy (% 08/8553 9110) is another worthwhile
stop. Tours and tastings are conducted at milking time (1–5 p.m.).
It’s a great chance to sample delicious sheep’s milk, yogurt, and
mouthwatering haloumi cheese.
 For fabulous (though pricey) fishing for everything from King
George whiting, trevally, and snapper, to mullet and mackerel, 
contact Kangaroo Island Fishing Charters (% 08/8552 7000;
www.kifishchart.com.au). A full day starts at A$125 (US$100/
£50), including lunch; a half-day trip starts at A$90 (US$72/£36).
Kangaroo Island Fishing Charters also runs coastal wilderness
tours, looking for birds, seals, and whales in season.

Chapter 21
Perth and the Best of
Western Australia
by Marc Llewellyn
In This Chapter
 Finding your way to Western Australia
 Enjoying Perth and Fremantle
 Touring the Margaret wineries
S
un, adventure, and an awesome natural environment is what you
can expect from Western Australia, also known as WA. WA covers
one-third of Australia at over 2.5 million sq. km (1 million sq. miles) but
only 2.1 million inhabitants live in Perth. Perth is the most remote large
city on Earth — Adelaide is 2,700km (1,700 miles) east.
The Southwest corner is the prettiest part. Vineyards and pastures sit
between stands of karri and jarrah trees, the surf is world-class, there
are limestone caverns, and the coastline is rugged.
We’re a bit disappointed that we can only touch on the high points of
this huge, diverse state, but we’ve selected the most accessible areas for
this chapter — and we’ll see if we can get some more in the next edition!
We start out with Perth, the most outdoorsy of all Aussie cities. Perth’s
brilliant setting along both the Swan River and the Indian Ocean, and the
abundance of parkland mean that it’s almost obligatory to get outside
and enjoy the sun and fresh air. Its climate is pleasant throughout the
year. Most visitors focus on the summer months of December through
March, with lots of sun, sea, and sand, though the sea breeze can get
(annoyingly) strong.
Fremantle, or “Freo” as it’s known, is a working port and Perth’s second
city heart. It’s a favorite weekend spot to eat, drink, shop, and sail.
Fremantle is 19km (12 miles) downriver, at the mouth of the Swan.
After spending some time in Perth and Freo, we take a quick swing
through the Margaret River to enjoy some of Australia’s finest wines.

Chapter 21: Perth and the Best of Western Australia 431
Getting to Western Australia
By air
Qantas, or its subsidiary Qantaslink (% 13 13 13 in Australia; www.
qantas.com.au), flies at least once a day from all mainland capitals as
well as Broome, Alice Springs, and Uluru (Ayers Rock). Virgin Blue (% 13
67 89 in Australia; www.virginblue.com.au) flies direct from Sydney,
Melbourne, Adelaide, Brisbane, the Gold Coast, and Broome, with connec-
tions from other cities. Jetstar (% 13 15 38 in Australia; www.jetstar.
com) has a daily flight from Melbourne, with connections from other east-
ern cities. Skywest (% 1300/660 088 in WA; www.skywest.com.au) con-
nects Perth to all significant towns in WA and to Darwin.
Perth Airport is 12km (71⁄2 miles) northeast of the city. At the interna-
tional terminal, look out for volunteer Customer Service Officers called
“Gold Coats,” mostly in departures, and “WOWs” (West Oz Welcomers)
wearing ocher jackets and Akubra hats in arrivals. The domestic and
international terminals are a bit of a distance from each other, so if you’re
transferring from one to the other, you’ll have to take a shuttle or taxi.
Getting to Perth and Fremantle from the airport
The Airport City Shuttle (% 08/9277 7958) aims to meet all flights
within 30 to 45 minutes of Customs clearance, or luggage collection for
domestic flights. There is no need to book ahead. City transfers from the
international terminal cost A$15 (US$12/£6.15) one-way, A$25 (US$20/
£10) round-trip; from the domestic terminal, A$12 (US$9.60/£4.90) one-
way, A$22 (US$18/£9) round-trip.
The Fremantle Airport Shuttle (% 1300/668 687 in Australia, or 08/
9335 1614) operates regular services each day from both airport termi-
nals to hotels or anywhere else in Fremantle. You must reserve for the
return trip. The fare is A$30 (US$24/£12) per person and gets cheaper
the bigger your group is — down to A$10 (US$8/£4.10) per person for
five or more people.
Transfers between terminals run regularly from 5 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily,
with limited service until 9:30 p.m. Qantas/One World interflight trans-
fers are free, otherwise it costs you A$8 (US$6.40/£3.30); taxis between
the terminals are about A$24 (US$19/£7.75).
Public bus no. 37 runs to the city from the domestic terminal. No buses
run from the international terminal. A taxi to the city is about A$40
(US$32/£16) from the international terminal and A$32 (US$26/£13) from
the domestic terminal, including a A$2 (US$1.60/£0.80) fee for picking up
a taxi at the airport.
Avis (% 08/9277 1177 domestic terminal, 08/9477 1302 international 
terminal), Budget (% 08/9277 9277), Europcar (% 08/9237 4320), Hertz
(% 08/9479 4788), and Thrifty (% 08/9464 7333) have desks at both 
terminals.

Part VI: The South and West 
432
By train
The three-day journey to Perth from Sydney via Broken Hill, Adelaide,
and Kalgoorlie aboard the Indian Pacific, operated by Great Southern
Railway (% 13 21 47 in Australia; www.trainways.com.au), is a great
experience. It has the world’s longest straight stretch of rail (over
483km/300 miles) along the Nullarbor Plain. The train runs twice a week
in each direction, and can carry your vehicle. The one-way fare ranges
from A$1,790 (US$1,432/£731) in first class with meals and en-suite bath-
room, to A$1,320 (US$1,056/£539) in comfy, but cramped if you’re large
or tall, second class (meals cost extra, and bathrooms are shared), down
to A$680 (US$544/£278) for sit-up-all-the-way coach class (not a good
idea). Connections are available from Melbourne on the Overland train.
All long-distance trains pull into the East Perth Terminal, Summers
Street off Lord Street, East Perth. A taxi to the city center from there
costs about A$17 (US$14/£6.95).
Introducing the Neighbourhoods
 The City Center: The central business district (CBD) is home to
offices, shops, and department stores. It has a modest collection of
19th-century heritage buildings, especially convict-built Government
House and Town Hall. Four long avenues run east–west between
riverside parkland and the railway reserve. St. Georges Terrace (it
becomes Adelaide Terrace at Victoria Avenue) is the main thorough-
fare and commercial and banking address, while Hay Street and
Murray Street are the major retail avenues with pedestrian malls in
the central blocks. Arcades link all three, plus Wellington Street,
which has Perth’s suburban railway station.
 Northbridge: Most of Perth’s nightclubs, and a good many of its
cool restaurants, bars, and cafes, are in this 5-block precinct north
of the railway line. It’s within easy walking distance of the city
center, or take the free Blue CAT buses. Its boundaries are William,
James, Aberdeen, and Parker streets. The Cultural Center is here,
with the Western Australian Museum, Art Gallery of Western
Australia, State Library, and Perth Institute of Contemporary Arts.
 Subiaco: This well-heeled inner suburb is on the other side of Kings
Park. Take a stroll through “Subi’s” villagelike concoction of restau-
rants, cafes, markets, boutiques, antiques shops, pubs, and galleries.
Most of the action is near the intersection of Hay Street and Rokeby
(pronounced rock-er-bee) Road, with the Subiaco Hotel and Art Deco
Regal Theatre on opposing corners.
 Burswood/East Perth: These two areas are on opposite sides of the
Swan River upstream of Perth city. Both are on land reclaimed from
earlier industrial use, and show enlightened development with
parkland, pathways, and artworks. Burswood has major entertain-
ment complexes, a public golf course, and superb gardens. East
Perth is mostly modern housing, parks, galleries, and restaurants,
based around a river inlet with walkways.

Chapter 21: Perth and the Best of Western Australia 433
Getting Around Perth
On foot
Perth is a good walking city, so bring comfortable shoes.
By bus
Transperth (www.transperth.wa.gov.au) runs Perth’s buses, trains,
and ferries. For information, call % 13 62 13 in Western Australia, or
drop into the Transperth InfoCenters at the Plaza Arcade off Hay Street
Mall, the Perth Train Station, the Wellington Street Bus Station, or the
Perth Esplanade Busport on Mounts Bay Road.
You can transfer between bus, ferry, and train services for up to two
hours (zones 1–4) or three hours (zones 5–8). Travel costs A$2.10
(US$1.70/£0.85) in one zone (to Subiaco, for instance), and A$3.20
(US$2.55/£1) in two, which gets you most places, including Fremantle,
with discounts for kids ages 5 to 14.
The Wellington Street Bus Station (close to Perth Train Station) and the
Perth Esplanade Busport on Mounts Bay Road are the two main arrival
and departure points. The vast majority of buses travel along St. Georges
Terrace. You must hail the bus to ensure that it stops. Buy tickets from
the driver. Buses run from about 5:30 a.m. until about 10:30 p.m. or 
11:30 p.m., depending on the route.
By tram
The Perth Tram Co. (% 08/9322 2006; www.perthtram.com.au) makes
a daily loop of the city, the casino, and Kings Park in replica 1899
wooden trams; hop on and off as you want. Tickets, which you buy on
board, cost A$24 (US$19/£9.80) adults, A$10(US$8/£4.10) children 4 to
14, A$48 (US$38/£20) families (up to six). City-to-casino or Kings Park
single legs are also available. The tram starts at 565 Hay St. at 8:30 a.m.
and makes nine 90-minute narrated loops per day, every day.
By bike
You’re allowed, even encouraged, to take your bicycle on Perth’s suburban
trains and ferries. The only limitations are to avoid the Monday through
Friday peak services — toward the city between 7 a.m. and 9 a.m., and
away from the city between 4:30 p.m. and 6:30 p.m. — and not have your
bike at Perth Train Station during either of these times.
By car
Perth’s signposting is reasonably good for helping drivers find their way
around. The major car rental companies are Avis (% 08/9325 7677),
Budget (% 08/9480 3111), Europcar (% 08/9277 9144), Hertz (% 08/
9321 7777), and Thrifty (% 08/9464 7444). All except Hertz also have
outlets in Fremantle.

Part VI: The South and West 
434
By train
Trains are fast, clean, and safe. They start at about 5:30 a.m. and run
every 15 minutes or more often during the day, and every half-hour at
night until midnight. All trains depart from Perth Train Station opposite
Forrest Place on Wellington Street. Buy your ticket before you board, at
the vending machines on the platform. There are five lines: north to
Joondalup; northeast to Midland; southeast to Armadale; southwest to
Fremantle; and south to the resort town of Mandurah.
By ferry
You can use ferries to visit South Perth and Perth Zoo. They run every
half-hour or so, more often in peak hours, daily from 6:50 a.m. weekdays
and 7:50 a.m. weekends and holidays, until 7:24 p.m. (or until 9:15 p.m.
Fri–Sat in summer, Sept–Apr) from the Barrack Street Jetty to Mends
Street in South Perth. Buy tickets before you board from vending
machine on the wharf. The trip takes approximately seven minutes.
By taxi
Perth’s two biggest taxi companies are Swan Taxis (% 13 13 30 in
Australia) and Black & White Taxis (% 13 10 08 in Australia). Ranks
(stands) are at Perth Railway Station and at the Barrack Street end of
Hay Street Mall.
Take a free ride
A welcome freebie in Perth is free public transport within the city center and nearby
areas. In the Free Transit Zone (FTZ), you can travel free on all buses within this zone
any hour, day or night. The FTZ is bounded by Kings Park Road, Fraser Avenue, Thomas
Street, and Loftus Street on the west; Newcastle Street on the north; and the river on
the south and east. Basically, this means you can travel to Kings Park, Northbridge, and
anywhere in the city center for free. Signs mark the FTZ boundaries; just ask the driver
if you’re not sure. FTZ boundaries for trains are City West station on the Fremantle line
and Claisebrook on the Midland and Armadale lines.
You can buy a DayRider ticket and get one day of unlimited travel after 9 a.m. on week-
days and all day on weekends and public holidays for A$7.70 (US$6.15/£3.15). A
FamilyRider pass is valid for unlimited all-day travel to any destination and back, for
a group of up to seven people with a maximum of two adults, but only on weekends
and public holidays, also for A$7.70 (US$6.15/£3.15).

Staying in Style in Perth
The city center has loads of hotels. That means competition can be high,
especially on weekends when the business travelers go home, so ask
about lower rates. You may strike a deal on a weeknight if business is
slow. Many hotels throw breakfast or some other feature into weekend
packages. Most hotels have rooms for travelers with disabilities.
The top hotels
Esplanade Hotel Fremantle
$$$$
Fremantle
Freo’s best hotel is this low-rise 1897 colonial building wrapped by two
verandas, now modernized and extended, and centered on the original
glass and iron four-story atrium. It’s opposite a park close to the Fishing
Harbour, and within walking distance of all Freo’s cafes, shops, and attrac-
tions. The rooms are all of reasonable size, with the suites especially spa-
cious and having large balconies. Some studio units have Jacuzzis. Eleven
rooms are designed for wheelchair access. The larger pool in the court-
yard is a good place to chill out without getting buffeted by the pesky local
sea breeze, the so-called Fremantle Doctor.

Fothergills of Fremantle
$$
Fremantle
One of Perth’s best B&Bs, it’s in two restored 1890s limestone mansions.
Fremantle with all its charms is a ten-minute walk, and Fremantle Prison is
a block away. The houses have been extensively and tastefully modern-
ized, and owner David Cooke has spread his art collection throughout,
bringing color, light, and life. The upstairs balconies have views over the
roofs of Fremantle to the Indian Ocean, ideal for evening sundowners. Most
rooms have queen-size beds, while the O’Connor suite has a king-size and
double foldout bed. The courtyards are quiet, restful havens.

InterContinental Burswood Hotel
$$$–$$$$$
Burswood
It’s the setting that first grabs your attention, the distinctively tiered build-
ing set within parkland next to the Swan River, overlooking the city. Then
you walk into the glass-ceilinged atrium, set about with high-flying trian-
gular sails. Glass-sided elevators ascend one wall. The hotel is part of an
entertainment complex that includes Perth’s casino, a theater, another
hotel (Holiday Inn), and an 18-hole golf course. Being outside the city
center, the main focus is on tourists not corporate travelers. The real stars
are the spacious suites with large balconies, facing straight downriver; 
otherwise ask for river-view rooms.

Miss Maud Swedish Hotel
$$
City Center
This hotel offers a European pensione-style presence in the heart of the
city. It’s a 1911 building, and a bit of a rabbit warren. The whole place has
been refurbished over the last five years, but it still retains its Swedish
ambience. It has a comfortable “feel,” with wallpaper used throughout.
Miss Maud is real — Maud Edmiston who started the hotel and restaurant
35 years ago. Many of the staff members have been with her for years and
there’s a loyal customer base. Single women find it a safe and comfortable
place to stay. There are six single rooms. Two principal aims are to pro-
vide sleeping comfort and a good breakfast, so large beds are provided —
and there’s a fabulous buffet in Miss Maud Swedish Restaurant (see
“Dining in Perth,” later in this chapter).

The Outram
$$$$
West Perth
Discreet and intimate are the key words for this small but elegant hotel,
which also offers friendly service. It’s Perth’s only member of the Small
Luxury Hotels of the World group. In West Perth, it’s 2 blocks from Kings
Park and within easy reach of the city center. Privacy is paramount, with full
key-card access control. The rooms are large but not opulent, with king-size
beds, open-plan bathrooms, “his and her” basins, a walk-through shower,

Parmelia Hilton Hotel
$$$
City Center
This is Perth’s first Hilton five-star hotel and still one of the best. It’s steps
from the Perth Convention Center, with the Swan River not far away. The
marble foyer has a brass plaque commemorating the S.S. Parmelia, which
brought 150 of the first settlers to these shores. The river views have
mostly been built out, so ask for rooms from the seventh floor upward (no
extra charge). The hotel has subtly striped wallpaper throughout, the spa-
cious standard rooms and deluxe rooms are decorated in cool relaxing
shades, while the suites boast separate living, working, and dining areas.
The Globe Restaurant has one of Perth’s most innovative menus, and
hosts regular fashion and winemaker events.

quiet, and has views across Claisebrook (a broad pool, lined with artworks
and upmarket housing) and down to the Swan River. Galleries, restaurants,
parks, and walkways are a few steps away. A barbecue area and 25m (82-ft.)
lap pool are outside. There is no restaurant but the corner cafe will deliver
breakfast, and it and other local restaurants, and a wine shop, also deliver

ment has a full kitchen with microwave, washer and dryer, and balcony.

Dining in Perth
An array of upscale choices plus terrific cheap ethnic spots make Perth’s
restaurant scene as sophisticated as Sydney’s and Melbourne’s — 
which is to say, excellent. You’ll find a great range in “restaurant city,”
Northbridge. Friday and Saturday nights tend to be very busy. Midweek is
less busy, quieter, and generally more pleasant.
Many outlets emphasize the use of fresh local produce. You’ll find sea-
sonal berry, stone, citrus, and tropical fruit; lamb, beef, veal, and goat;
seafood such as rock lobster, abalone, and prawns; freshwater crus-
taceans such as marron and yabbies; and superb fish including snapper,
red emperor, and cobbler.
For inexpensive pasta, a Turkish bread sandwich, or excellent coffee 
and cake, you can’t beat Perth’s homegrown DOME chain of cafes. Look
for the dark green logo at Trinity Arcade between Hay Street Mall and 
St. Georges Terrace (% 08/9226 0210); at 149 James St., Northbridge 
(% 08/9328 8094); among other places.
The Capri
$$
Fremantle
ITALIAN
A Fremantle institution, this place has been owned by the Pizzale family for
50 years, and the décor probably hasn’t changed in that time. This is
dining as it once was — no fussy furnishings, just good honest Italian grub.
Free bread and water are served immediately, and complimentary soup
with main courses. It’s unlicensed so BYO. Here you’ll find standard Italian
fare, such as spaghetti marinara and scaloppine, available in small or large
servings. It’s right in the middle of the Cappuccino Strip.
21 South Terrace, Fremantle. % 08/9335 1399. Main courses: A$20–A$25 (US$16–
US$20/£8.15–£10). AE, DC, MC, V. Open: Daily noon to 2 p.m. and 5–10 p.m.
Cicirello’s
$$
Fremantle
SEAFOOD
On Fremantle’s Fishing Boat Harbour, this is one of several places offering
freshly cooked, tasty fish and chips — and other seafood. It’s a functional,
volume restaurant but still has character. Large fish tanks (for show) are
the decorative feature, and floor-to-ceiling glass doors lead out to the
broad timber balcony, also with seating, directly above the water. Fishing
boats are moored next door. The food comes battered and fried, or grilled,
but the essential meal is fish and chips. There’s a kid’s menu.
44 Mews Rd. (Fishermans Wharf), Fremantle. % 08/9335 1911. Main courses:
A$10–A$25 (US$8–US$20/£4.10–£10). AE, DC, MC, V. Open: Daily 9 a.m.–9 p.m.

The Essex
$$$
Fremantle
MODERN AUSTRALIAN
For a quiet, elegant, romantic night out, the Essex is hard to beat. Located
just off Fremantle’s Cappuccino Strip, and up the road from the Esplanade
Hotel, it’s in a restored 120-year-old limestone cottage, with the dining
areas spread among several rooms. The service is discreet but can leave
you unattended at times. Try the Balmain bugs (a curiously flattened, but
tasty, crustacean) and ravioli, or the beef Gabrielle filled with scallops.
20 Essex St., Fremantle. % 08/9335 5725. Reservations recommended. Main courses:
A$30–A$52 (US$24–US$42/£12–£21); lunch A$32 (US$26/£13) 2 courses, A$39 (US$31/
£13) 3 courses. AE, DC, MC, V. Open: Daily 6 p.m. to late, lunch Wed–Fri and Sun from
noon.
44 King Street
$$$
City Center
BISTRO
Socialites, hip corporate types, and casuals adorn this sophisticated
hangout — for a meal, a snack, or good coffee, roasted on-site. The interior
is a mix of industrial design and European cafe, with dark timber tables,
exposed air ducts, and windows onto the street. The open kitchen pro-
duces all its own bread and pastries, and has a changing menu with some
weird and wonderful choices — such as fennel-roasted duck with paella
of Valencia, or Cajun pink snapper with sweet-potato frites and avocado
sour cream. The menu helpfully lists wine suggestions for each dish, and
offers over 70 wines by the glass from around A$8 (US$6.40/£3.30), and
taster glasses, too. There’s also a good beer selection.
See map p. 435. 44 King St. % 08/9321 4476. Reservations not accepted. Main
courses: A$18–A$38 (US$14–US$30/£7.35–£16); 10 percent surcharge weekends and

Fraser’s
$$$
Kings Park
MODERN AUSTRALIAN
You look past spiky grass trees and towering lemon-scented gums to
Perth’s panoply of skyscrapers and the Swan River. Even better, the vict-
uals match the vista. Executive chef Chris Taylor changes the menu daily
to focus on the latest fresh produce, with seafood especially prominent.
This place was awarded a national title for “Best Informal Dining in
Australia” in 2006. Fraser’s Three Taste brings together beef, lobster, and
salmon in a starter, while crisp fried soft-shell crabs married with turmeric
and pumpkin curry comes as a starter or entree, and whitebait fritters are
served with a tamarind sauce. Ask for a seat on the terrace.
Fraser Avenue (near the Information Kiosk), Kings Park. % 08/9481 7100. Reservations

Jackson’s
$$$$
Highgate
MODERN AUSTRALIAN/INTERNATIONAL
Understated contemporary design and ambience help to emphasize the
quality of the food here. Chef Neil Jackson has a loyal clientele, and a host
of awards for his ability to bring out the best in local produce, with some
quirky touches. This place is a short distance out of town but worth the
trip. The menu changes seasonally but with a reputation for duck dishes
and soufflés, both sweet and savory. His degustation menu, called “the
dego,” offers nine courses, with suggested matching wines. Friday and
Saturday are booked out weeks ahead, and diners are warned, “This food
may contain traces of nuts, love, quality produce, and passion!”
483 Beaufort St., Highgate. % 08/9328 1177. Reservations essential. Main courses:
A$38 (US$30/£16); “the dego” A$95 (US$76/£39), A$150 (US$120/£61) with wines. AE,

Lamont’s East Perth
$$$$
East Perth
MODERN AUSTRALIAN
Kate Lamont has a well-deserved reputation for the flavor-driven food she
produces at her three restaurants, in Margaret River, Swan Valley, and here.
The menu changes depending on the availability of seasonal produce.
Marron (a local crustacean) is a specialty, presented in various manners,
including a poached version with pea risotto. Desserts are tapas-style,
encouraging shared tastings. Weekend breakfast features a triple layer
pyramid of various ingredients; more of a brunch offering. The modern
glass-fronted restaurant faces directly on to Claisebrook Inlet, with the
Swan River 50m (164 ft.) away, and the Holmes à Court Gallery is next door.
There’s an extensive wine list, with the option to take away the Lamont
family wines, at cellar door prices.

Highgate
BISTRO
This place has one of Australia’s finest wine lists, and there’s some pretty
good food, too. Check out the cool contemporary design, with suspended
wine rack separating bar from restaurant. It’s a trendy hangout especially
on Friday and Saturday nights. There are 600 wines in stock, with some 50
available by the glass. Food is contemporary French, with a charcuterie
plate (shared appetizer) and beef cheek ravioli specialties.

Miss Maud Swedish Restaurant

City Center
INTERNATIONAL
“Good food and plenty of it” is the motto at Miss Maud’s homey estab-
lishment, and the crowds prove it works. Most diners skip the a la carte
menu and go straight for the smorgasbord. At breakfast, that means 50
dishes, including pancakes made to order. At lunch and dinner you can
tuck into soup, ten salads, a range of seafood (including oysters at dinner),
cold meats, roasts, vegetables, pasta, cheeses, European-style breads,
tortes, fruit, and ice cream — 65 dishes in all. Service is fast and polite.

Subiaco
ASIAN-INFLUENCED AUSTRALIAN
In ten years, chef/owner David Coomer has taken this restaurant on a sub-
urban street to become one of the best in Perth. The converted house fea-
tures several dining areas including a courtyard, and the décor is clean
and subtle with Asian influences and contemporary art. The innovative
menu is done daily and features a Signature Menu of six fixed courses (with
suggested wines). The a la carte section is kept simple with five courses
listed in each of the appetizer, main, and dessert sections. Among David’s
creations are crispy aromatic duck, seared scallops, and licorice ice cream.
Tuesday is an optional BYO (bring your own alcohol) night.

Witch’s Cauldron
$$$
Subiaco
MODERN AUSTRALIAN
Australia’s best garlic prawns arrive preceded by a cloud of sizzling garlic.
The Cauldron has twice been voted Perth’s favorite restaurant. Started in
a single room in 1971, its owners Geoff and Tanis Gosling have expanded
it into a double-story establishment without compromising style or stan-
dards. They’ve even bought some street-side parking bays, effectively
extending the restaurant across the sidewalk. Numerous witches, includ-
ing political cartoons, adorn the walls and ceilings. One feature is a series
of circular banquettes for cozy dining for groups of four to six. Service is
brisk, friendly, and efficient. Besides the garlic prawns there’s an empha-
sis on simple cooking of quality fish and steak.

The Top Attractions
AQWA (Aquarium of Western Australia)
City Center
There are no performing dolphins, but there’s plenty to see, including
Australia’s largest walk-through aquarium, where you’re surrounded by 4m
(13-ft.) sharks, rays, turtles, and hundreds of colorful fish. AQWA specializes
in the ocean ecosystems around WA, and has a touch pool, a great attrac-
tion for small (and bigger) kids; a lagoon full of stingrays; and the Seal Island
underwater viewing area to watch sea lions at play. You can come face to
fin with pretty leafy sea dragons, and observe some of the ocean’s dead-
liest such as blue-ringed octopus and stonelike stonefish. Keepers feed the
sharks and the touch-pool creatures daily, and a program of talks and
movies on marine creatures runs throughout the day. For A$125
(US$100/£51) plus A$20 (US$16/£8.15) for snorkel gear or A$40 (US$32/£16)
for dive gear (diving qualifications required), you can swim with the sharks

Kings Park & Botanic Garden
Kings Park
Overlooking the city and Swan River is this 406-hectare (1,000-acre) hill-
top jewel of parkland, botanical gardens, and bush. The main entry, along
Fraser Avenue, is lined with lemon-scented gums. You can inspect Western
Australian flora; experience the solitude of the bush; and bike, stroll, or
drive an extensive network of roads and trails. A walk through the Botanic
Garden showcases many of the state’s plant species, including banksias
and baobabs, and leads to the Federation Walkway, a glass arched bridge
that soars through the treetops. Visiting the spring wildflower displays
(which peak Aug–Oct) is a highlight for many, with an excellent Wildflower
Festival in September. Pick up self-guiding maps from the Visitor
Information Centre, or take a free guided walk leaving from opposite the
Centre. Walks depart daily at 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. and take one-and-a-half
hours, or two or three hours for bushwalks (May–Oct only).

Perth Mint
This lovely historic building — built in the 1890s to refine gold and mint
currency from the Kalgoorlie gold rush — is one of the world’s oldest mints
operating from its original premises. It now produces legal-tender precious
metal coins and commemorative medallions for collectors, and bullion is
still traded here. The “Gold Exhibition” allows visitors to see Australia’s
biggest collection of nuggets, watch gold coins being minted, handle a 400-
ounce gold bar, and engrave their own medallion. Tours start with a guided
walk on the half-hour, and lead on to the molten gold pouring demonstra-
tion (on the hour 10 a.m.–4p.m. weekdays, and 10 a.m. to noon weekends
and holidays). The shop sells gold coins and nugget jewelry, and the Tea
Garden provides a quiet spot to relax.

Perth Zoo
South Perth
This is an excellent modern zoo — with re-created natural habitats and no
cages in sight. It has several successful breeding programs, including one
for orangutans. Others cover white rhinos, African painted dogs, and a
number of West Australian fauna, including the numbat, which is WA’s
animal emblem. This is a good place to see a range of Australian wildlife
such as kangaroos, koalas, wombats, quokkas, emus, echidnas, and pen-
guins, and there’s a walk-through aviary. Exotic animals include apes,
Rothschild’s giraffes, lions, tigers, meerkats, and elephants. Feeding
demonstrations and talks run throughout the day. Volunteer guides are
always around to provide information, and conduct free daily walking
tours at 11 a.m. and 1:30 p.m. (Sept–Apr). You can do a behind-the-scenes
Close Encounters Tour (with 3 weeks notice), and bring home a unique
souvenir: paintings by the zoo’s elephants.

Swan River
City Center
The river is a great natural and free asset. Perth Water, immediately below
the CBD, is a superb foreground and mirror to the city — best seen from
South Perth, and stunning at and just after sunset. The South Perth ferry
(see “Getting Around Perth” earlier in this chapter) is the easiest way of
getting there. Perth Water is shallow, so ideal for “messing about in boats,”
and small catamarans can be hired on the South Perth foreshore. Past the
Narrow Bridge, the river widens out and becomes home to several yacht
clubs. Biking along riverside pathways is a great way to enjoy the city, the
river, and the weather. You can rent both boats and bikes.

This is the best place in Perth to see traditional Aboriginal culture, with
presentations three times a day on Saturdays and Sundays. The park is
51km (32 miles) north of the city, in glorious natural woodland, around a
reed-fringed lake. You can follow a boardwalk through the koala enclosure,
hire a rowboat, take a limestone cavern tour, have a coffee and snack (or
beer) at the historic Tudor-style Yanchep Inn, or admire the wildlife.

More cool things to see and do
 His Majesty’s Theatre and King Street: A lovely old wedding cake
of an Edwardian theater, the venue was rescued and revamped in
1979. It’s Perth’s major venue for the WA Ballet and Opera compa-
nies and visiting theater productions, including those for the Perth
International Arts Festival. Friends (volunteers) of His Majesty’s are
on hand Monday through Friday 10 a.m. to 4 p.m., to provide infor-
mation and tours of the theater (unless it’s in use) and public areas
for a donation. Downstairs houses the Museum of Performing Arts
with an engrossing collection of costumes and other memorabilia.
It’s at the corner of Hay and King streets (% 08/9265 0900; www.
hismajestystheatre.com.au). It’s open Monday through Friday
from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m., with gold coin donation.
 Holmes à Court Gallery: This small riverside gallery offers rotating
exhibitions from one of the country’s most outstanding private art
collections, that of Janet Holmes à Court, Australia’s richest

Part VI: The South and West 
446
woman. Many of the works are Aboriginal or by well-known
Australian artists such as Sidney Nolan. It’s at 11 Brown St., East
Perth (% 08/9218 4540). Admission is free and it’s open Wednesday
through Sunday noon to 5 p.m. Closed public holidays.
Hitting the Beaches
Perth has great beaches right in the city — in an almost continuous line
from Cottesloe in the south to Quinns Rocks in the north, including a
section called the Sunset Coast. Mornings are usually best for the beach,
because the sea breeze can make the afternoons unpleasant in summer.
Evenings and sunsets are lovely on quiet days. Always swim between the
red and yellow flags, which denote a safe swimming zone.
Bus nos. 400 and 408 run to Scarborough Beach every 15 minutes daily,
while no. 102 goes to Cottesloe every 30 minutes. Bus no. 458 operates a
summer timetable along the northern beaches from Scarborough to
Hillarys, half-hourly on weekends and holidays and hourly on weekdays,
in both directions. Surfboards under 1.2m (4 ft.) can be carried on nos.
400, 408, and 458. Bus no. 381 operates a weekday service between
Fremantle and Warwick, with stops at both Cottesloe and Scarborough.
Here are some of the best beaches around town:
 Cottesloe: This pretty crescent, graced by the Edwardian-style
Indiana Tea House, is Perth’s most fashionable beach. It has
grassed slopes overlooking the beach, safe swimming, and a small
surf break. Train: Cottesloe, then walk several hundred meters
(between a quarter- and a half-mile). Bus: 102.
 Scarborough: Scarborough’s white sands stretch for miles.
Swimming is generally safe, and surfers are guaranteed a wave,
although inexperienced swimmers should take a rain check when
the surf is rough. The Australian Surf Life Saving Championships
will be held here in late March 2008 and 2009. Bus: 400.
 Trigg: Surfers like Trigg best for its consistent swells, but it can
have dangerous rips. Stay within the flags. Bus: 400 to Scarborough,
then walk; or 458 (summer).
The Fremantle Doctor is in . . .
In the summer, Perth gets an easterly offshore breeze in the morning then, as the land
heats up, it switches to be a southwesterly onshore wind. This is called the Fremantle
Doctor because it blows up the river from Fremantle and provides relief on hot summer
days. The timing and strength of the breeze varies and it can be almost gale force, whip-
ping up the sand on exposed beaches. Check the daily weather forecast for likely wind
strength. The three most popular beaches are Cottesloe, Scarborough, and Trigg.

The Shopping Scene
Most major shops are downtown on the Hay Street and Murray Street
malls, and in the network of arcades running off them, such as the Plaza,
City, Carillon, and Tudor-style London Court arcades. Off Murray Street
Mall on Forrest Place is the Forrest Chase shopping complex, housing
the Myer department store and boutiques on two levels. The other
major department store, David Jones, opens onto both malls. Add to
your collection of designer brands on King Street, in the west end.
Harbourtown, at the western edge of the city, is a large complex hous-
ing “factory outlets” of numerous retail chains.
If you want to avoid the chains, spend half a day in Subiaco or “Subi,”
where Hay Street and Rokeby Road are lined with boutiques, galleries,
cafes, antiques shops, and markets. The Colonnade shopping center at
388 Hay St. showcases some groovy young Aussie fashion designers.
Shops are open until 9 p.m. on Friday in the city, and until 9 p.m. on
Thursday in Subiaco and Fremantle.
Art and crafts
Two shops showcase contemporary ceramic, textile, glass, and jewelry
products: FORM at 357 Murray St. just round the corner from King
Street; and Aspects of Kings Park, behind the visitor center.
Aboriginal arts and crafts
 Creative Native, 32 King St. (% 08/9321 5470), stocks Perth’s
widest range of Aboriginal arts and crafts. Upstairs is a gallery sell-
ing original works by some renowned Aboriginal artists. There’s
another branch at 65 High St., Fremantle (% 08/9335 7438).
 Indigenart, 115 Hay St., Subiaco (% 08/9388 2899), and 82 High
St., Fremantle (% 08/9335 2911), stocks works on canvas, paper,
and bark, as well as artifacts, textiles, pottery, didgeridoos,
boomerangs, and sculpture, by Aboriginal artists from all over
Australia.
 Japingka Gallery, 47 High St., Fremantle (% 08/9335 8265), is 
dedicated to encouraging and exhibiting Aboriginal art. It has a
large stock of certificated art covering a cross section of areas and
styles. There’s an ongoing exhibition program, which usually
involves having the artist present for discussion. The gallery is
based over two floors in a historic building in central High Street.
Jewelry
Western Australia is renowned for farming the world’s best South Sea
pearls off Broome, for Argyle diamonds mined in the Kimberley, and for
being one of the world’s biggest gold producers.

 For opals to suit all budgets, head to the Perth outlet of Quilpie
Opals, Shop 6, Piccadilly Arcade off Hay Street Mall (% 08/9321

Perth after Dark
Scoop magazine is a good source of information on festivals and concerts,
theater, classical music, exhibitions, and the like. Your best guide to clubs,
concerts, and art-house cinemas is the free weekly X-press magazine,
available at pubs, cafes, and music venues every Thursday. The West
Australian (especially the Sat edition) and Sunday Times newspapers
publish entertainment information, including cinema guides.
Two ticket agencies handle most of the city’s major performing arts,
entertainment, and sporting events: the performing-arts-oriented BOCS
(% 1800/193 300 in Australia, or 08/9484 1133; www.bocsticketing.

(% 13 61 00; www.ticketmaster.com.au). Book opera, ballet, the
orchestra, and the Black Swan Theatre Company (see the following sec-
tion) through BOCS.
The performing arts

A Day Out in Fremantle
The heritage port precinct of Fremantle, is 19km (12 miles) from
downtown Perth on the mouth of the Swan River. In the lead-up to the
Americas Cup in the 1980s, the city embarked on a major restoration
of its gracious warehouses and Victorian buildings.
Today “Freo” is a bustling district of 150 National Trust buildings,
alfresco cafes, museums, galleries, pubs, markets, and shops in a mas-
terfully preserved historical atmosphere. It’s still a working port, so
you can see fishing boats unloading on one side, and yachts and con-
tainer ships gliding in and out of the main commercial river-mouth
harbor on the other. Weekends are best, with a wonderful hubbub of
buzzing shoppers, merchants, coffee drinkers, locals, tourists, and
fishermen. Allow a full day to take in even half the sights — and don’t
forget to knock back a beer or two on the veranda of one of the gor-
geous old pubs.
Parking is plentiful, but driving is frustrating in the maze of one-way
streets. Most attractions are within walking distance (or accessible
on the free CAT bus), so take the train to Fremantle and explore on
foot.

Getting around Fremantle
The orange Fremantle CAT bus makes a comprehensive running loop of
local attractions every ten minutes Monday through Friday from 7:30 a.m.
to 6:30 p.m., and on weekends and holidays from 10 a.m. to 6:30 p.m.,
except Good Friday (Fri before Easter) and December 25 and 26. It is free
and departs from the train station.
Fremantle Trams (% 08/9339 8719; www.fremantletrams.com) — an
old tram carriage on wheels — conducts hop-on/hop-off commentated
tours around the main sights. The tours depart from Fremantle Town
Hall ten times a day starting at 9:45 a.m., with the last tour leaving at
2:45 p.m. Tickets cost A$20 (US$16/£8.15) adults, A$15 (US$12/£6.15) stu-
dents and seniors, A$5 (US$4/£2.05) children, A$45 (US$36/£18) families
of four; discount entry to the prison is included.
Finding information after you arrive
The Fremantle Visitors Center is in Town Hall, Kings Square (at High
Street), Fremantle, WA 6160 (% 08/9431 7878; www.fremantlewa.com.
au). It’s open Monday through Friday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., Saturday 
10 a.m. to 3 p.m., Sunday 11:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m.; closed public holidays.
The best Web site is that of the Fremantle Council (www.fremantle.
wa.gov.au).
Seeing the sights in Fremantle
You’ll want to explore some of Freo’s museums and other attractions,
but don’t forget to stroll the streets and admire the 19th-century offices
and warehouses, many painted in rich, historically accurate colors. Take
time to wander down to the docks — either Victoria Quay in the main
shipping harbor, where sailing and pleasure craft dodge between tugs
and container ships, or Fishing Boat Harbour, off Mews Road, where the
catches are brought in — and get a breath of salt air.
Fremantle Arts Center
Housed in a neo-Gothic 1860s building built by convicts, this center con-
tains one of Western Australia’s best contemporary arts-and-crafts gal-
leries, with a constantly changing array of works. A shop sells crafts from
Western Australia, a bookstore stocks Australian art books and literature,
and the leafy courtyard cafe is the perfect place to hang out. Free concerts
play on the lawn every Sunday and public holiday from October to April,
from 2 to 4 p.m. Also here is the Fremantle History Museum (see the fol-
lowing listing).
1 Finnerty St. at Ord Street. % 08/9432 9555. Admission: Free. Open: Daily 10 a.m.–5 p.m.
Fremantle History Museum
Housed in a convict-built former lunatic asylum, this small but densely
packed museum uses lots of old photographs and personal possessions
Chapter 21: Perth and the Best of Western Australia 451

to paint a realistic picture of what life was like for Fremantle’s first settlers,
the Aborigines they displaced, and later generations up to the present day,
especially the post–World War II immigration boom.
In the Fremantle Arts Center (see preceding listing), 1 Finnerty St. at Ord Street. 
% 08/9430 7966. Admission: Gold coin donation. Open: Mon–Fri 10 a.m.–4:30 p.m.,
Sat and public holidays 1–5 p.m., Sun 10:30 a.m.–4:30 p.m.
Fremantle Prison
Even jails boasted attractive architecture in the 1850s. This limestone jail,
built to house 1,000 inmates by convicts who no doubt ended up inside it,
was Perth’s maximum-security prison until 1991. Take the 75-minute main
tour “Doing Time” to see cells re-created in the style of past periods of the
jail’s history, bushranger (highwayman) Joe Moondyne’s “escape-proof”
cell, the gallows, workshops, chapel, jailers’ houses, and cell walls featur-
ing artwork by the former inmates. The ticket price includes an additional
45-minute tour (the precinct tour) that visits other areas, including the
women’s prison and commissariat, hourly after the main tour. You must
book ahead for the 90-minute torchlight tours on Wednesday and Friday
only, and the 21⁄2 hour tunnel tour, which takes you by foot and boat
through limestone tunnels 20m (66 ft.) down.
1 The Terrace. % 08/9336 9200. www.fremantleprison.com. Admission: Free
to prison gatehouse and visitor center; day tours A$16 (US$13/£6.55) adults, A$8

5 p.m.; main tours every 30 minutes, precinct tours every hour 11:30 a.m.–4:30 p.m.,
torchlight tours Wed and Fri every 20 minutes from sunset, daily tunnel tours hourly
9 a.m.–3:20 p.m.
The Roundhouse
This 12-sided jail is the oldest public building in the state (built in 1831).
It’s worth a visit for history’s sake, and for the one o’clock gun. The time
cannon (a replica of a gun salvaged from an 1878 wreck) is fired and a time
ball dropped at 1 p.m. daily, just as it was in the early 1900s, from a deck
overlooking the ocean. You may be that day’s honorary gunner chosen
from the crowd! Volunteer guides are on hand to explain it all.
10 Arthur Head (enter over the railway line from High Street). % 08/9336 6897.
Admission: Gold coin donation. Open: Daily 10:30 a.m.–3:30 p.m.
Shipwreck Galleries
The remnant hulk of the Dutch ship Batavia, wrecked north of Perth in
1629, will stop you in your tracks as you enter this fascinating museum, in
a lovely old 1850s limestone building. The Batavia’s story is of survival and
betrayal; most of the survivors of the wreck were massacred by a handful
of mutineers. The mutiny and massacre have been the subject of films and
an opera. You’ll love the tales of old wrecks and displays of pieces of eight,
Part VI: The South and West 
452

Chapter 21: Perth and the Best of Western Australia 453
glassware, cannon, and other deep-sea treasure recovered off the Western
Australian coast. Displays date from the 1600s, when the Dutch became the
first Europeans to visit Australia. The museum is world-renowned for its
work in maritime archaeology and preservation.
Cliff Street at Marine Terrace. % 08/9431 8444. Admission: Donation (suggested
A$1/US$0.80/£0.40 or A$2/US$1.60/£0.80). Open: Daily 9:30 a.m.–5 p.m.
Western Australian Maritime Museum
This museum at the western end of Fremantle’s main harbor faces straight
out through tall glass panels to the Indian Ocean. The museum looks at
Fremantle’s history and operations as a port, shipping in the Indian Ocean
and Swan River, signaling and piloting, current sailing technology, naval
defense, and Aboriginal maritime heritage. It also features historic boats,
including Australia II (the Aussie yacht that won the America’s Cup in
1983). You can tour HMAS Ovens, an Oberon-class submarine, every half-
hour from 10 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. You can buy a ticket just for the sub, or a
joint one for the museum and sub, at a discount.
Victoria Quay. % 08/9431 8444. Admission: A$10 (US$8/£4.10) adults, A$3 (US$2.40/
£1.20) children 5–15, A$22 (US$18/£9) families; free 2nd Tues of each month. Admission

(US$18/£9) families. Open: Daily 9:30 a.m.–5 p.m.
Wining and Dining in Margaret River
For most Australians, the words Margaret River (277km/173 miles south
of Perth) are synonymous with great wine. The area has over 80 wineries
and, although they produce only about 1 percent of Australia’s wine
output, they turn out around 10 percent of the country’s top “premium”
wines.
There’s a selection of quality lodges and B&Bs, galleries, gourmet food
outlets, and restaurants. Many crafts people have set up here, with pro-
ducers of venison, cheese, chocolate, and olive oil. Statuesque forests of
gracious karri trees create beautiful dappled drives; the west coast has
spectacular surf breaks and cliffs perfect for abseiling (rappelling) and
rock climbing; the northern coast has wonderfully peaceful safe
beaches; and there’s a honeycomb of limestone caves filled with stalag-
mites and stalactites.
Whales pass by June through December, wildflowers line the roads
August through October, and wild birds, kangaroos, and shingle-backed
lizards are everywhere.
The Margaret River region isn’t large, so is easy to get around. It reaches
120km (75 miles) from Cape Naturaliste in the north to Cape Leeuwin on
the southwest tip of Australia, both with attendant lighthouses. If you
like hiking, pack your boots, because there are plenty of trails, from a 
15-minute stroll around Margaret River township, or an hour’s stroll

Part VI: The South and West 
454
along the Dunsborough beaches, to a 6-day Cape-to-Cape trek along the
sea cliffs.
The main settlements are Dunsborough in the north, Margaret River
township in the center, and Augusta in the south. Busselton is the gate-
way to the region, though not really part of it.
Getting to Margaret River
By car
It’s a three-hour drive to Margaret River from Perth; take the inland
South Western Highway or the more scenic Old Coast Road to Bunbury,
and pick up the Bussell Highway to Busselton, the gateway to the region.
By bus
Southwest Coachlines (% 08/9324 2333) runs a daily service to
Margaret River from Perth for about A$31 (US$25/£13). The Public
Transport Authority (PTA; % 1300/602 205 in Western Australia, or
08/9326 2600; www.transwa.wa.gov.au) also runs a coach service from
Perth. The services take four-and-a-half to five-and-a-half hours, so we
don’t recommend them.
Taking a dip with Flipper
Just two hours’ drive south of Perth, en route to Margaret River, is a place where you
can swim with these creatures.
At the Dolphin Discovery Centre, Koombana Drive, Bunbury (%08/9791 3088; http://
dolphins.mysouthwest.com.au), bottlenose dolphins come into shore in
Koombana Bay. You can “float” with them free in the waist-deep “interaction zone” 
on the beach, under the eye of volunteer guides. The dolphins don’t show up about a
third of the time (the best chance of seeing them is 8 a.m. to noon). Reservations are not
necessary.
From November to April (weather dependent), the center runs two-hour Swim on the
Wild Side tours where, accompanied by a marine biologist, you can snorkel with some
of the bay’s 100-plus dolphins in deeper water for A$125 (US$100/£51) including equip-
ment; you must be over 8 years old to participate.
Naturaliste Charters (% 08/9755 2276; www.whales-australia.com) runs excel-
lent 90-minute dolphin watch cruises twice daily (except Dec 25 or in bad weather)
from the center at 11 a.m. and 2 p.m.; they cost A$37 (US$30/£15) adults, A$24 (US$19/
£9.80) kids 4 to 12, A$28 (US$22/£11) kids 13 to 17, A$109 (US$87/£44) families (two
adults, two children).

Margaret River Region

Part VI: The South and West 
456
Getting information after you arrive
The Margaret River Visitor Centre is one of the best and most useful in
the country. It’s at 100 Bussell Hwy. (at Tunbridge Street), Margaret
River, WA 6285 (% 08/9757 2911; www.margaretriverwa.com). Pick up
a winery guide, a guide to the artisans of the region, and maps. It’s open
daily from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.
Getting around Margaret River
Two north–south roads service the area, Bussell Highway and the
slower, winding Caves Road. Numerous smaller roads connect the two,
or loop down to bayside settlements renowned for their surfing opportu-
nities. The Bussell Highway turns due south 9km (51⁄2 miles) past
Busselton, and runs down the middle of the region, through Margaret
River town to Augusta and windswept Cape Leeuwin. Caves Road runs
past Dunsborough then swirls southward, closer to the coast, past lime-
stone caves and karri forests toward Augusta.
A car is close to essential. Hertz (% 13 30 39 in Australia, or 08/9758
8331) has an office in Margaret River, or call Avis (% 1800/679 880 in
Australia for reservations in the Southwest). For a taxi, call Margaret
River Taxi Service (% 13 10 08 or 08/9757 3444).
Several companies run sightseeing and winery tours from Margaret
River or Perth. One operator is Taste the South (% 04/3821 0373; www.
tastethesouth.com.au), which offers half-day tours in minibuses in
groups of about a dozen that take in five wineries running A$70 (US$56/
£28), as well as individual tours, and several overnight tours, which can
also include other Margaret River attractions. You can look at offerings
from other companies, and find one that suits your needs at the
Margaret River Visitor Centre Web site (www.margaretriver.com/
tours).
The wines of Margaret River
Fans of premium wines will have a field day. Cabernet sauvignon and
merlot are the star red varieties, with most wineries making a straight
cabernet and/or cabernet/merlot blend. Shiraz is also popular and 
Cape Mentelle makes a powerful zinfandel. Chardonnay is the standard
single-variety white wine, while fresh vibrant sémillon/sauvignon blanc
blends have become synonymous with the region. A few wineries make
(Australian-style) Rieslings. Most wineries offer free tastings from 10 a.m.
to 4:30 p.m. daily. There are two main clusters of vineyards; the biggest
grouping is in the northern half in the Willyabrup area, with a smaller
number, including several big names, around Margaret River township.

Wine-buying tips
Most wineries don’t deliver internationally, and the wine you like may
not be exported to your country, so use the services of the Margaret
River Regional Wine Centre, 9 Bussell Hwy., Cowaramup (% 08/9755
5501; www.mrwines.com). It stocks about every local wine; does daily
tastings of select vintages; and sells maps, visitor guides, and winery
guides. The expert staff will help you make your choices, and even tailor
your day’s foray. It is open Monday through Saturday from 10 a.m. to 
8 p.m., and Sunday from noon to 6 p.m. (closed Good Friday, Dec 25, and
sometimes Jan 1). You can also order through the Web site.
The region’s best known winery, and one of the very best, is Leeuwin
Estate, Stevens Road, Margaret River (% 08/9430 4099). It has a tower-
ing reputation, with its Art Series chardonnay often rated Australia’s
finest. Winery tours run three times a day.
A relative newcomer, Voyager Estate, Stevens Road, Margaret River 
(% 08/9757 6354), has exquisite rose gardens and a South African Cape
Dutch–style cellar and restaurant.
Three pioneer vineyards that date from the late 1960s, Moss Wood,
Vasse Felix, and Cullen’s, are all still rated very highly. Other labels to
look for are Cape Mentelle, Devil’s Lair, Madfish (Howard Park Wines),
Lenton Brae, Pierro, Woodlands, and Cape Grace Wines. Ashbrook takes
a very serious approach to style and quality, and makes one of the best
WA Rieslings.
A food journey in Margaret River
Food-based attractions are opening up in the area all the time.
 You can pick your own kiwi, raspberries, and other fruit at the
Berry Farm, 222 Bessell Rd., outside Margaret River (% 08/9757
5054; www.berryfarm.com.au), or buy them ready-made as attrac-
tively packaged (fruit-based) wines, jams, and vinegars. It’s open
daily from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. (4:30 p.m. for the “cellar door” wine
shop). There’s also a restaurant at the farm, called “The Cottage,”
which serves locally grown, seasonal food.
 At the Margaret River Chocolate Company, Harman’s Mill Road,
Metricup (% 08/9755 6555; www.chocolatefactory.com.au),
you can participate in free tastings, watch the candy-making
through a window, and, of course, buy up the sweet stuff and 
coffees. It’s open daily 9 a.m.–5 p.m.
 Olio Bello, corner of Armstrong Road and Cowaramup Bay Road,
Cowaramup (% 08/9755 9771), was the 2006 Australian Olive
Grower of the Year. You can buy a range of olive oils, soaps, and
body creams, dips, and tapenades. Olio Bello also has macadamias,
fruit trees, and native shrubs so the place is full of birds. It’s open
daily from 10 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.
Chapter 21: Perth and the Best of Western Australia 457

 Margaret River Venison, Caves Road, just south of Olio Bello 
(% 08/9755 5028), is a family-run enterprise, selling products
derived from deer raised on the property. It’s open daily from 
9 a.m. to 6 p.m. The Margaret River Dairy Company, Bussell
Highway, Cowaramup, just north of the village (% 08/9755 7588;
www.margaretriverdairy.com.au), uses local milk to make a
range of cheeses and yogurts. It’s open daily 9:30 a.m. to 5 p.m.
Staying in Margaret River
You find an amazing selection of places to stay in Margaret River town
and Dunsborough, and around the vineyards.
A couple of medium-size hotels can be found near Dunsborough on the
edge of Geographe Bay, otherwise there are B&B establishments, self-
catering villas and cottages, campground chalets, and a range of excel-
lent lodges. Some places may require a minimum two-night stay on
weekends.
Cape Lodge
$$$$
Yallingup
Cape Lodge has been voted one of the world’s top 100 hotels. A member
of the Small Luxury Hotels of the World, it’s set on 16 hectares (40 acres)
of vineyards and forest, with lakes, rolling lawns, and rose beds. The
impression is of space and tranquility, accompanied by birdsong. A
number of small blocks, or wings, are located so there are uninterrupted
views and you’re not really aware of other people. The rooms are large and
elegantly furnished with king-size beds, and balcony or courtyard. The
Lodge Suite, in the original homestead, has a comfortable lounge and two
en-suite bathrooms. The restaurant, incorporating a guest lounge, has a
glass wall and decking on the edge of the main lake. It has won several
awards and opens for breakfast and dinner, with limited evening space for
nonguests.

Margaret River
Although it’s on the highway “in” Margaret River (within walking distance
of restaurants), this row of salmon-pink cabin-style rooms sits in a serene
karri forest, out of sight of town. Each spacious unit (including one for trav-
elers with disabilities) has a veranda and king-size double or king-size twin
beds, and a double Jacuzzi, from which you can see the forest. The rooms
back onto a number of bushwalk trails.

Redgate Beach Escape
$$$
Margaret River
Four contemporary cottages sit on a hill, looking out across native bush to
an expanse of ocean. There is no noise, just the breeze, birdsong, and the
sound of the sea, with an occasional eagle floating past. The furnished cot-
tages have a Balinese theme, full-height doors and windows facing the
ocean, and are self-catering. Hosts Roger and Mim Budd built with a phi-
losophy of uncluttered lines and sustainability. All services are under-
ground including a rainwater tank which supplies the cottages.

Cowaramup
MODERN AUSTRALIAN/ORGANIC
Owner and winemaker Vanya Cullen operates in a holistic manner, aiming
for simplicity, integrity, and sustainability, using organic principles. Both

timber restaurant is unpretentious but comfortable, with a shady outdoor
option, and offers casual, relaxed dining, using fresh biodynamic and
organic local produce. All dishes are labeled as organic, biodynamic,
gluten-free, vegetarian, or free range. Cullen’s produces an excellent sémil-
lon/sauvignon blanc blend, and its Diane Madeleine cabernet/merlot is

Margaret River
MODERN AUSTRALIAN
Touted by many locals as “one of the best restaurants in Australia,” Vat
107 serves very good food. It’s a slick, smart, city-bistro type place which
puts it slightly at odds with the Margaret River laid-back style, but it’s
attractive and appealing. Dishes include seared duck breast with herb
spaetzle and warm cherry purée, and slow-cooked salmon with truffled
orzo and roasted forest mushroom and, for dessert, a chocolate trio.
107 Bussell Hwy., Margaret River. % 08/9758 8877. Reservations recommended. Main

Palatial white gates lead into spotless grounds, lined with rose gardens,
and with what surely is the tallest flagpole in WA. In one corner, tucked
behind a Cape-style garden, is the white Cape Dutch cellar and restaurant.
The restaurant is in a long timber-vaulted room strung with chandeliers,
and the menu is imaginative and varies seasonally, and comes with rec-
ommended wines (available by the glass). Try the Taste Plate or Seafood
Assiette, and leave room for the specially selected range of cheeses.

Part VII
Tasmania

In this part . . .
W
e head off the southeast coast of the Australian 
continent to the small island-state of Tasmania. In
Chapter 22, we show you how much diversity can exist on a
small (well, compared to the continent above, it’s small!)
island, starting off in Tasmania’s main town, Hobart.
We explore the rest of the island, too, including the memo-
rably beautiful Freycinet National Park in Chapter 23, and
stop off in Launceston, as well as pay a visit to the sobering
remains of Australia’s prison heritage in Port Arthur.

Chapter 22
Tasmania
by Marc Llewellyn
In This Chapter

 Getting the best deals for lodging
 Discovering the best places to eat
 Exploring Hobart and its environs
T
here are a few really exotic-sounding places in the world — like the
Galapagos, Patagonia, Madagascar . . . and Tasmania. All conjure up
visions of remoteness, strange animals, and unexplored wilderness.
Australia’s largest offshore island has everything you might expect from
such a place: vast tracts of rain forest roamed by creatures like the
Tasmanian devil, wild coastline battered by ferocious winds, historic
towns built by 19th-century convicts, mountain peaks, alpine meadows,
lakes, eucalyptus stands, and fertile farmland.
Europeans arrived in Tasmania (or Van Diemen’s Land, as it was once
known) in 1642, when the sailor Abel Tasman set anchor off its south-
west coast. It wasn’t identified as an island until 1798. Tasmania made its
mark as a dumping ground for convicts, who were more often than not
transported for petty crimes in their homeland. The brutal system of
control spilled over into persecution of the native population. The last
full-blooded Tasmanian Aborigine died in 1876, 15 years after the last
convict transportation.
Getting There
Tasmania is easily accessible by air from Sydney and other state capi-
tals. Airfares are very competitive, with several companies trying to
outdo each other for the cheapest fares. If you think that getting there is
half the fun, then opt for a ferry trip from Melbourne.
By air
Qantas (% 13 13 13 in Australia; www.qantas.com.au) runs frequent
daily service to both Hobart and Launceston from most major mainland

cities. Virgin Blue (% 13 67 89 in Australia; www.virginblue.com.au)
offers discount daily flights to Hobart and Launceston, with connections
from other state capitals. Jetstar (% 13 15 38 in Australia; www.jetstar.
com.au), a Qantas offshoot, also flies to Hobart and Launceston. Regional
Express (% 13 17 13 in Australia; www.regionalexpress.com.au) flies
from Melbourne to Devonport and Burnie in the state’s north. A new-
comer to the market is Singapore-based Tiger Airways (% 03/9335-
3033; www.tigerairways.com), which, started offering cut-price tickets
between Melbourne and Launceston in 2007.
Hobart Airport is about 15 minutes from the city center. By taxi it costs
approximately A$20 (US$16/£8). The Airporter Shuttle Bus (% 0419/
382 240 mobile) meets planes and delivers passengers to hotels in the
city and farther afield for A$12 (US$9.60/£4.80) adults one-way (A$20/
US$16/£8 adults round-trip), A$6 (US$4.80/£2.40) one-way for kids. If
you’re departing Hobart on an early flight (6 a.m., 6:30 a.m., or 7:25
a.m.), you need to make a booking by 8 p.m. the previous evening.
In Launceston, the Airport Shuttle (% 03/6343 6677) provides trans-
portation between city hotels and the airport from 8:45 a.m. to 5 p.m.
daily for A$11 (US$8/£4) adults one-way, A$5 (US$4/£2) children 4 to 16.
By ferry
Two high-speed ferry services connect Melbourne and Tasmania. The
Spirit of Tasmania I and II can each carry 1,400 passengers as well as cars.
They make the crossing from Melbourne’s Station Pier to Tasmania’s
Devonport (on the north coast) in around ten hours. The ferries leave
both Melbourne and Devonport at 9 p.m. and arrive at around 7 a.m.
From roughly December 20 to April 27, day service is available on week-
ends, leaving both ports at 9 a.m. and arriving at 7 p.m. Prices are based
on shoulder and peak times: The shoulder seasons run from roughly
August 31 to December 6, and from January 27 to April 27. A one-way seat
costs A$114 to A$168 (US$91–US$134/£46–£67) adults, A$102 to A$131
(US$82–US$105/£41–£53) children; prices vary depending on the season.
Three- to four-berth cabins cost A$212 to A$272 (US$170–US$218/
£85–£109) adults, A$118 to A$146 (US$94–US$117/£47–£58) kids; prices
vary depending on the season and on whether you have a porthole. Twin
cabins cost A$236 to A$302 (US$189–US$242/£95–£121) adults, A$128 to
A$162 (US$102–US$130/£51–£65) children, depending on the season.
Deluxe cabins cost A$326 to A$418 (US$261–US$334/£131–£167) adults
and kids, depending on the season. Transporting a standard-size car costs
A$79 to A$121 (US$63–US$97/£32–£48), depending on size, year-round.
Make reservations for any of the ferries through TT-Line (% 1800/634
906 in Australia, or 03/9206 6211; www.spiritoftasmania.com.au).
Special offers are regularly available. Tasmanian Redline coaches 
(% 03/6336 1446; www.redlinecoaches.com.au) connect with each
ferry and transfer passengers to Launceston and Hobart.

Orienting Yourself in Hobart
Tasmania’s capital (pop. 126,000) is second in age only to Sydney among
Australia’s cities. Its main features are its harbor and the colonial cottages
that line the narrow lanes of Battery Point. As in Sydney, Hobart’s harbor
is the city’s focal point, attracting yachts from all over the world. Down by
the waterfront, Salamanca Place bursts with galleries, pubs, cafes, and an
excellent market on Saturdays. Europeans settled in Hobart in 1804.
Hobart, the southernmost Australian state capital, is closer to the
Antarctic coast than it is to Perth in Western Australia; navigators,
whalers, and explorers have long regarded it as the gateway to the south.
Introducing Hobart’s Neighbourhoods
 Battery Point: This area was named after a battery of guns (long
since removed) overlooking the Derwent River in 1818. In colonial
times the sandstone buildings were occupied by sailors, fishermen,
whalers, coopers, merchants, shipwrights, and master mariners.
 Central Business District (CBD): Located on the west side of the
water, the CBD has main thoroughfares — Campbell, Argyle,
Elizabeth, Murray, and Harrington streets — sloping down to the
busy harbor.
 Mount Wellington: Mount Wellington is a 1,270m-high (4,000-ft.)
mountain just a 20-minute drive from the city center. The drive to the
summit takes you through temperate rain forest and up to sub-alpine
flora and glacial rock formations. You can take in panoramic views of
Hobart, Bruny Island, and the Tasman Peninsula from its peak.
 North Hobart: A northern suburb, North Hobart features a separate
town center with good eateries and surrounding historic bed-and-
breakfast properties.
 Salamanca Place: Hobart’s historic waterfront includes this long
row of stylish 1830s sandstone warehouses. The buildings house
boutiques, bars, bookshops, restaurants, cafes, galleries, and jew-
elers. Each Saturday, the Salamanca Square, within Salamanca
Place, hosts the Salamanca Markets, where you can buy anything
from handmade toys to fruits and vegetables. Behind Salamanca
Place is Salamanca Square, where you can sit by a fountain and
listen to the street musicians.
Finding Information after You Arrive
The Tasmanian Travel and Information Centre (% 03/6230 8233; 
tasbookings@tasvisinfo.com.au) is at 20 Davey Street. It’s open
Monday through Friday from 8:30 a.m. to 5:15 p.m., Saturday and public
holidays from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m., and Sunday from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. (Dec–
Apr 9 a.m.–4 p.m. daily).

Getting Around and Touring Hobart
 By taxi: Several cab companies operate in and around Hobart,
though the city is so small you most likely won’t use them. Try 
City Cabs (% 13 10 08 in Australia) or Taxi Combined Services
(% 13 22 27 in Australia).
 By bus: Metro Tasmania (% 13 22 01 or 03/6233 4232; www.metro
tas.com.au) operates public buses throughout the city and subur-
ban areas. Single tickets cost A$1.90 to A$4.30 (US$1.50–US$3.40/
£0.75–£1.70) depending on how far you’re going. Day Rover tickets
are good between 9 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. and after 6 p.m. during the
week and all day on weekends; they cost A$4.60 (US$3.70/£1.85). 
A family day ticket costs A$13 (US$10/£5). Buy tickets from the 
bus driver. If you plan on busing about, stop at the Metro Shop, in
the General Post Office building on the corner of Elizabeth and
Macquarie streets, and pick up a timetable, brochures, and sight-
seeing information.
Tassielink (% 1300/300 520 in Australia, or 03/6230 8900; www.
tassielink.com.au) offers half-day sightseeing tours of Hobart
and Mount Wellington by coach. The tours leave at 2 p.m. Tuesday
and Thursday afternoons and 9 a.m. on Sunday morning from the
Hobart Bus terminal, 64 Brisbane St. Tickets cost A$55 (US$44/£22)
adults, A$33 (US$26/£13) kids.
 On foot: Hobart Historic Tours (% 03/6230 8233 or 03/6278 3338;
www.hobarthistorictours.com.au) runs a fascinating two-hour
walking tour of Hobart every day between October 1 and April 30. 
It departs at 10 a.m. from outside the Tasmanian Travel and
Information Centre. A Historic Pub Tour, departing the same place
at 5 p.m. in the same months, takes you to three waterfront pubs
and will enthrall you with stories of alcohol-sodden shenanigans.
You even get to meet some shady actor-characters. The price
includes two tastings. Both tours cost A$25 (US$20/£10) adults,
A$13 (US$10/£5) children 8 to 16. Kids under 8 are free. It also runs
a Battery Point Walk looking at the small artisans’ cottages and
grand houses. It departs at 3:30 p.m. daily and costs A$23 (US$18/
£9), A$12 (US$9.60/£4.80) for children ages 8 to 16.
Staying in Style in Hobart
Hobart isn’t an expensive city for lodgings, though you should expect
prices to go up if you have water views. For something different, you
could stay with a Tasmanian family in town or at a farm in the country,
or arrange accommodations in one of the many boutique B&Bs through-
out Tasmania. Contact Heritage Tasmania Pty Ltd., P.O. Box 780, Sandy
Bay, TAS 7005 (% 03/6233 5511; fax 03/6233 5510). Nightly B&B rates
range from A$60 to A$160 (US$48–US$128/£24–£64) for a double.

CBD
If you prefer standard hotel accommodations to one of Hobart’s many
stately old homesteads, then book a room at this property overlooking the

the rooms have water views. Eight are equipped for travelers with dis-
abilities. The lobby is an impressive marble-and-granite construction with
a big curved window to catch the action on the docks. The hotel also has
a first-class restaurant specializing in innovative Tasmanian cuisine. A

Macquarie Manor
$$
City Centre
Macquarie Manor is a classic colonial-style manor, built in 1875 as a
doctor’s surgery and residence. Extra rooms were added in 1950. Thick
carpets and double-glazed windows keep the place quiet, even though it’s
on the main road, 2 blocks from the bus terminal. Rooms, which vary enor-
mously, are comfortable and elegantly furnished. One room is suitable for
people with disabilities. The staff is friendly and will be happy to escort
you around the premises. Check out the delightful dining room and the
drawing room complete with old couches and a grand piano.

Wrest Point Casino
$$$–$$$$
Wrest Point
Beside the Derwent River, 3km (2 miles) from the city center, this hotel/
casino complex looks out across the harbor and the city and up to Mount
Wellington. All rooms feature Tasmanian oak furniture and plush carpets,
and more expensive units have exceptional views. Although it may not be
as convenient to the city center as the Hotel Grand Chancellor (though it’s
certainly walkable), the views make it a class above. Wrest Point Casino
has several bars and restaurants, as well as a large outdoor pool, a health
club, and a nine-hole putting course. Taxis from Wrest Point to the city
cost around A$10 (US$8/£4), and the Busy Bee bus nos. 54 and 55 oper-
ates to and from the city every 15 minutes.

The Lodge on Elizabeth
$$
City Centre
The Lodge on Elizabeth is in the second-oldest building
in Tasmania, some parts of which date to 1810. Originally a gentleman’s
residence, it later became the first private boys’ school in Tasmania. It’s
well situated just a 12-minute walk from Salamanca Place and is sur-
rounded by restaurants. All rooms are decorated with antiques; many are
quite romantic, with four-poster beds. Standard rooms have just a shower,
whereas deluxe rooms come with more antiques and a large granite bath-
room with a Jacuzzi. The Convict’s Cottage is a cute self-contained spa cot-
tage, just for two, in the grounds.

ness district and toward the waterfront near Battery Point, Salamanca Inn

North Hobart has a reputation for happening restaurants, and the eatery
of the moment is amulet, which prides itself on seasonal produce and local
ingredients. Inside, it’s light and lovely during the day and moody at night.
Part VII: Tasmania 
470

This restaurant is a wonderful place for breakfast and a weekend brunch —
the extensive menus are inspiring. As for dinner, try the eggplant cordon
bleu stuffed with smoked soy on hummus and pine nuts, or the spice-
crusted lamb on pumpkin mash with sour cherry sauce.
333 Elizabeth St., North Hobart. % 03/6234 8113. www.northhobart.com/amulet.

INDIAN
This is a fabulous Indian restaurant, with rich red walls and even richer
food. All your usual Indian fare is on the menu, plus some unusual dishes,
such as the Calcutta chicken, a Goan prawn curry, and a goat curry. Top
of the lot is the masala dosa, a south Indian crepe filled with curried
potato. Plenty of vegetarian options are available.

marinated fish. The desserts can be great. Vegetarians, vegans, and those
on a gluten-free diet are very well catered to, as are carnivores.

Drunken Admiral Restaurant

City Centre
SEAFOOD
The Drunken Admiral, opposite the Hotel Grand Chancellor on the water-
front, is a popular spot with tourists, and can get raucous on busy
evenings. The main attraction to start the meal with is its famous seafood
chowder, swimming with anything that was on sale at the docks that morn-
ing. The Yachties Seafood Grill (A$28/US$22/£11) is a full plate of squid,
scallops, fish, mussels, and prawns, but plenty of simpler fish dishes are
on the menu. We recommend the Tassie mussels steamed in white wine,
tomatoes, and shallots with a hunk of bread.

Mures Upper Deck
$$$
City Centre
SEAFOOD
This large, bustling waterfront restaurant offers great views of bobbing
yachts as well as fine seafood caught on the owner’s own fishing boats. We
recommend starting with a bowl of the signature Mures Smokey Chowder
or some local oysters. Main courses could include grilled Atlantic salmon
with an asparagus and smoked salmon terrine, or blue eye (a fish) pan-
fried in a spice mix of cumin, fennel, and black pepper. A real treat is the
seafood platter, costing A$50 (US$40/£20). The best dessert is the restau-
rant’s famous summer pudding, which almost bursts with berries. The
complex includes Lower Deck, a popular self-service family restaurant
where you can dine well for under A$20 (US$16/£8).

Exploring Hobart
The top attractions
In addition to walking around the waterfront and exploring the historic
areas of Battery Point and Salamanca Square, you may want to save time
for the following attractions.
Cadbury Chocolate Factory
Claremont
Eat chocolates until you burst on this Willy Wonka–type trip. Book well
ahead, because chocolate tours are very popular. Keep in mind that you’ll
need to climb lots of stairs inside the factory, where you’ll see chocolate
being made. You can visit the factory on a ferry tour (see the “Cruising the
Derwent” sidebar for more information).
Claremont, 16km (10 miles) north of Hobart. % 1800/627 367 in Australia, or 03/6249
0333. Admission: A$13 (US$10/£5.20) adults, A$6.50 (US$5.20/£2.60) children. Open: Tours
start Mon–Fri 9 a.m., 9:30 a.m., 10 a.m., 10:30 a.m., 11 a.m., noon, 1 p.m., and 1:30 p.m.
Cascade Brewery Tours
South Hobart
Cascade Premium is one of the best beers in Australia. To see how this
heady amber nectar is produced, head to Australia’s oldest brewery and
tag along on a two-hour tour, which includes tastings — and a stroll
through the grand old Woodstock Gardens behind the factory. The tour
involves lots of stairs.
Cascade Road, South Hobart. % 03/6224 1117. Admission: A$18 (US$14/£7) adults, A$7

Female Factory Historic Site and Island Produce Fudge Factory
South Hobart
This is an interesting stopover if you’re visiting the Cascade Brewery or
Mount Wellington. You get not only a trip around the successful fudge-
making factory, but a guided tour around the remains of the women’s
prison next door. The tales told here will make the hairs on your neck
stand on end — like the fact that 17 out of every 20 children born within
the walls of the institution died soon after birth, and that women who died
were tossed into an unmarked mass grave.

The company also runs a cruise to Port Arthur.

garden (better than some we’ve seen in Kyoto), and seasonal blooming
plants. A busy road nearby somewhat disturbs the peaceful atmosphere.
A restaurant provides lunch and teas. To walk here from the city 
center, partly along a pleasant lane known as Soldier’s Walk, takes around
40 minutes — but it’s badly signposted.
On the Queens Domain near Government House. % 03/6234 6299. Free admission.

More cool things to see and do

devils, and wombats. The Bush Tucker shed serves lunch, billy tea
(tea brewed in a metal pot with a gum leaf thrown in), and damper

hill. Take a bus to Glenorchy from the central bus terminal in

Aboriginal heritage, its history since settlement, and the island’s
wildlife. The art gallery has an impressive collection of paintings by
Tom Roberts and by several convict artists. The pride of the collec-
tion is The Conciliation, by Benjamin Duttereau, one of the most his-
torically significant paints in Australia. Admission: Free. Open:
Daily 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.
Living It Up after Dark
 Opened in 1829 as a tavern and a brothel frequented by whalers,
Knopwood’s Retreat, 39 Salamanca Place (% 03/6223 5808), is
still a raucous place to be on Friday and Saturday evenings, when
crowds cram the historic interior and spill out onto the streets.
Light lunches are popular throughout the week, and occasionally
you’ll find jazz or blues on the menu.
 A favorite drinking hole in Hobart is Irish Murphy’s, 21 Salamanca
Place (% 03/6223 1119), an atmospheric pub with stone walls and
lots of dark wood. Local bands play Friday and Saturday evenings.
 If you want to tempt Lady Luck, head to the Wrest Point Casino, in
the Wrest Point Hotel, 410 Sandy Bay Rd. (% 03/6225 0112),

O
ne of the advantages of visiting Tasmania is that you can explore
the entire state more easily than some of Australia’s larger regions.
After Hobart, you can easily get to the other major towns and historical
sites, as well as the amazingly beautiful Freycinet National Park.
Convict Heritage in Port Arthur
Port Arthur (102km/63 miles southeast of Hobart on the Tasman
Peninsula) houses the remains of Tasmania’s largest penal colony —
Australia’s version of Devil’s Island. You can spend a whole day in this
picturesque yet haunting place.
From 1830 to 1877, Port Arthur was one of the harshest institutions of its
type anywhere in the world. It was built to house the settlement’s most
notorious prisoners. Nearly 13,000 convicts found their way here, and
nearly 2,000 died while incarcerated.
Getting there
Port Arthur is a one-and-a-half-hour drive from Hobart on the Lyell and
Arthur highways. Tassielink (% 1300/300 520 in Australia, or 03/6230
8900) runs trips from Hobart to the former penal settlement on Tuesday,
Wednesday (in summer only), Thursday, Friday, and Sunday. Tours cost
A$90 (US$72/£36) adults, A$54 (US$43/£22) children 4 to 16. The trip
includes a guided tour of the Port Arthur site.

Exploring Port Arthur
The Port Arthur Historic Site (% 03/6251 2310; www.portarthur.
org.au) has some 30 19th-century buildings. You can tour the remains
of the church, guard tower, model prison, and several other buildings.
Touring with a guide, who can describe what the buildings were used
for, is best. Don’t miss the museum, which has a scale model of the com-
plex, as well as leg irons and chains.
The site is open daily from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.; admission is A$25 (US$20/
£10) adults, A$11 (US$8.80/£4.40) children 4 to 12, A$55 (US$44/£22) fam-
ilies. The admission price is good for two consecutive days and includes
a walking tour and a boat cruise. There is also a separate cruise to the
Isle of the Dead off the coast of Port Arthur twice a day; some 1,769 con-
victs and 180 free settlers were buried here, mostly in mass graves with
no headstones. The cruise costs an extra A$10 (US$8/£4) adults, A$6.50
(US$5.20/£2.60) children, A$29 (US$23/£12) families.

Visiting Taz in his native land
Eighty kilometers (50 miles) from Hobart is the Tasmanian Devil Conservation Park, Port
Arthur Highway, Taranna (%03/6250 3230;www.tasmaniandevilpark.com), which
houses orphaned or injured native animals, including Tasmanian devils, quolls, kanga-
roos, eagles, and owls. The park is open daily from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Admission is A$12
(US$9.60/£4.80) adults, A$6 (US$4.80/£2.40) children, A$30 (US$24/£12) families. Tasmanian
devils are fed daily at 10 a.m., 11 a.m., and 5 p.m. The center is breeding devils with unusual
genes that could make them resistant to the facial tumor disease that’s devastating the
population. If you want to help save the Tassie devil, go to the park’s Web site.

a blacksmith’s shop, a lunatic asylum, and more. Allow between three
and four hours to explore the site and the gallery.
Allow at least one-and-a-half hours to enjoy the scenic drive from Hobart
to Port Arthur. The drive along the Tasman and Arthur highways forms
part of the Convict Trail Touring Route and takes in breathtaking sea-
scapes, rolling farmlands and villages, vineyards, and artists’ studios.
Exploring Freycinet National Park
The Freycinet Peninsula (206km/128miles northeast of Hobart) hangs
down off the eastern coast of Tasmania. From Hobart it’s about a three-
hour drive to the park. The peninsula is a place of craggy pink-granite
peaks, spectacular white beaches, wetlands, heathland, coastal dunes,
and dry eucalyptus forests. This is the place to come to spot sea eagles,
wallabies, seals, pods of dolphins, and humpback and southern right
whales during their migration to and from the warmer waters of north-
ern New South Wales from May through August.
The township of Coles Bay is the main staging post, and there are many
bushwalks in the area. The Moulting Lagoon Game Reserve — an
important breeding ground for black swans and wild ducks — is sign-
posted along the highway into Coles Bay from Bicheno. Some 10,000
black swans inhabit the lake, so it’s unusual not to see them. Spectacular
Wineglass Bay, named one of the world’s top ten beaches by Outside
magazine, is an amazingly beautiful spot for a walk.
Getting there
There are no direct public buses from Hobart. Tasmanian Redline
Coaches (% 1300/360 000 in Australia, or 03/6336 1446) run from 112

We can’t praise this ecofriendly lodge enough. Comfortable one- and two-
room cabins spread unobtrusively through the bush, connected by raised
walking tracks. Each has a balcony, and the more expensive ones have
huge Jacuzzis. Twenty cabins have their own kitchens. The main part of
the lodge houses a lounge room and an excellent restaurant that sweeps
out onto a veranda overlooking the limpid green waters of Great Oyster
Bay. The lodge is right next to the white sands of Hazards Beach, and from
here it’s an easy stroll to the start of the Wineglass Bay walk.

Visiting Launceston, Tasmania’s Second City
Tasmania’s second-largest city is Australia’s third oldest, after Sydney
and Hobart. At the head of the Tamar River, 50km (31 miles) inland from
the state’s north coast, and surrounded by undulating farmland,
Launceston is a pleasant city crammed with elegant Victorian and
Georgian architecture and plenty of remnants of convict days.

Local and state governments are overseeing the chipping away of its
great architectural heritage in favor of the usual parking garages and
concrete monoliths. However, Launceston (pop. 104,000) is still one of
Australia’s most beautiful cities and has plenty of parks and churches.
It’s also the gateway to the wineries of the Tamar Valley, the highlands
and alpine lakes of the north, and the stunning beaches to the east.
Getting there
Qantas (% 13 13 13 in Australia), Virgin Blue (% 13 67 89 in Australia),
and Jetstar (% 13 15 38 in Australia) carry passengers from Sydney 
and Melbourne to Launceston. The Airport Shuttle (% 03/6343 6677)
provides transportation between city hotels and the airport from 8:45
a.m. to 5 p.m. daily for A$11 (US$8/£4) adults, A$5 (US$4/£2) kids 4 to 16,
each way.
Tasmanian Redline Coaches (% 1300/360 000 in Australia; www.tas
redline.com.au) depart Hobart for Launceston several times daily
(trip time: around 2 hours, 40 minutes). The one-way fare is around A$30
(US$24/£12).
The drive from Hobart to Launceston takes just over two hours on
Highway 1.

bigpond.com), which leaves from the Gateway Tasmania Travel Centre
Monday through Friday at 9:45 a.m. (Weekend walks can also be arranged.)
The one-hour walk gives a fascinating insight into Launceston’s history
and costs A$15 (US$12/£6).

tain dominates the north part of the island, and the long, deep lake is to
its south. Between them lie steep slopes, button grass plains, alpine
forests, lakes filled with trout, and several rivers. Mount Ossa, in the
center of the park, is Tasmania’s highest point at 1,617m (5,304 ft.). The

The park has plenty of trails that can be attempted by people equipped
with directions from the staff at the park headquarters. Of the shorter
walks, the stroll to Pencil Pines and the 5km (3-mile) walk to Dove Lake
are the most pleasant. Between June and October, it’s sometimes possi-
ble to cross-country ski in the park.
The best-known hiking trail in Australia is the Overland Track, an 85km
(53-mile) route between Cradle Mountain and Lake St. Clair. The trek

 Discovering Sydney’s convict origins
 Visiting Tasmania’s old penitentiaries
 Exploring historic prisons in Queensland and Western Australia
F
or many Australians, convict heritage is something to be proud of.
The first European settlers, who sailed into Sydney Cove on a fleet
of 11 ships on January 26, 1788, were mostly in chains. Many were con-
victed of what today would be minor crimes (such as petty theft, carried
out in order to survive the poverty they lived in) and transported to
Australia for long periods, with little hope of returning to England. Along
with the soldiers who accompanied them, they formed the basis of the
new settlement, which would become Sydney, and later came to areas
including Tasmania, Queensland, and Western Australia.
The decision to establish a penal colony in Australia was made by the
British government in 1786. It chose Botany Bay, which had been recom-
mended for settlement by Captain James Cook when he sailed along
Australia’s east coast in 1770. But within a week of arrival in 1788,
Captain Arthur Phillip, the colony’s first governor, decided to move the
settlement to the more suitable Sydney Cove, naming it after First Lord
of the Admiralty, Viscount Sydney. The last convicts were transported to
New South Wales in 1840.
While you travel around Australia, you’ll find plenty of reminders of the
harsh life those first arrivals endured. Here, we fill you in on some sites
you can visit today that still bear witness to the arrival of Europeans.
Fort Denison, Sydney Harbour
A tiny island in Sydney Harbour was used to imprison and execute crimi-
nals from the time of the arrival of the First Fleet in 1788. The island was
known as “Pinchgut” by hungry convicts who spent time there. Just two
weeks after the fleet arrived, Advocate General David Collins recorded
that “three prisoners were tried, one for assault . . . he was sentenced to

150 lashes, a second, for taking some biscuit from another convict, was
sentenced to a week’s confinement on bread and water on a small rocky
island near the entrance to the cove.” In 1796 the body of convicted mur-
derer Francis Morgan was hung from a gibbet post on Pinchgut Island as
a lesson to serious offenders. The macabre spectacle was, as Collins
recorded “an object of great terror to the natives . . . his clothes shaking
in the wind, and the creaking of his irons. . . .” The Aborigines, who had
known the island as Mat-te-wan-ye (rocky island), from then on shunned
the place.
Around 1840, the island was converted into a fort to protect against pos-
sible Russian invasion during the Crimean War. Pinchgut became home
to Fort Denison, which was completed in 1857. The island was named
after Governor William Denison in 1862. It is now part of Sydney Harbour
National Park and is accessible by tour.
Hyde Park Barracks, Sydney
The colony gained its first architect in 1814 when Francis Greenway was
transported for forgery. Greenway designed numerous buildings both as a
convict and after gaining his full pardon in 1819, among them Sydney’s
Hyde Park Barracks on Queens Square in Macquarie Street. Built by con-
vict labor between 1817 and 1819, the barracks were first used as a dormi-
tory for homeless convicts. In 1848, they became an immigration depot
and were later used as a female asylum (1862–1886) and a courthouse
(1887–1979). Today the building is a museum, with exhibits about the lives
of convicts, the history of Australia’s convict system, and other occupants
of the building. It’s a popular place for school groups, so bear that in mind
when you’re planning your visit and get there outside school hours.
Richmond Gaol, Tasmania
The first section of Australia’s oldest convict gaol (pronounced jail),
Richmond Gaol, north of Hobart, was built in 1825, with a second wing
added in 1835 for women prisoners. This gaol was a harsh place, in
which floggings were frequent and other punishments included solitary
confinement and hard labor in chain gangs. Escapes by unrepentant and
unbowed convicts were also common.
One of the gaol’s most famous — and infamous — prisoners was Ikey
Solomon, on whom Dickens is said to have based Fagin in Oliver Twist.
The colonial hangman, Solomon Bleay, was also imprisoned at Richmond
Gaol, being escorted to and from Hobart and Launceston (the only
places of execution), when necessary, to carry out his duties.
Convicts were transported to the colony as an indentured workforce 
to build both public and private buildings. Convict chain gangs were
accommodated at Richmond in 1830, sharing crowded cells and passage-
ways with prisoners on far lesser charges.
Part VIII: The Part of Tens 
490

Most female convicts in Tasmania worked as domestic servants. Those
subsequently convicted of minor offences or en route to Hobart’s female
factory (see the following section) were held at Richmond Gaol. Many
women were returned to the factory by dissatisfied masters, but some
convict women committed minor offences to escape unsatisfactory 
situations. Ann Forest, for example, was given 14 days’ solitary on bread
and water for insolence and disobedience, a sentence twice repeated for
refusing to return to her assignment and absenting herself without leave
on her release. Finally, she was returned to Hobart.
After transportation of convicts to Tasmania ended in 1853, the gaol was
taken over by the Municipal Police; it remained a prison until 1928.
Today you can step inside a cell measuring just 1 x 2m (3 x 6 ft.), peer
into chain-gang sleeping rooms, walk in the flogging yards, see the cook
house and holding rooms, and see historical relics and documents.
Cascades Female Factory, Tasmania
One of five female factories in Tasmania, the Cascades Female Factory in
South Hobart was a women’s prison from 1828 to 1856, employing
women in washing, sewing, carding, and spinning. It was designed to
hold 700 female convicts and their children, though, at its overcrowded
worst, it housed 1,200 women and children. Life here was tough and
often short. Women who died were buried in an unmarked grave and the
children incarcerated with their mothers suffered terribly. For every 20
infants born here, 17 died soon after birth.
After it ceased operation as a female factory in 1856, the institution con-
tinued as a jail from 1856 until 1877.
You can take a self-guided tour of the Female Factory Historic Site which
allows you access to the memorial garden and the historic site, or a
guided one-hour tour. Cascades Female Factory was the setting for
Australian novelist Bryce Courtney’s book The Potato Factory, which
gives an insight into life for the transported women.
Port Arthur, Tasmania
Port Arthur was Tasmania’s largest penal colony. Set on the shores 
of the Tasman Peninsula, the prison was built for the most notorious
convicts — and was one of the harshest prisons in the world. From 1830
to 1877, nearly 13,000 convicts were incarcerated here and nearly 2,000
of them died here. Only a few ever managed to escape. Those who tried
either perished in the attempt or were hunted down and hanged.
About 30 19th-century buildings are dotted around the Port Arthur
Historic Site, including the remains of the church, guard tower, hospital,
and officers’ houses. The site’s most imposing ruin, the penitentiary, was
Chapter 24: Ten Convict Connections 491

originally a flour mill and granary; it was converted into a penitentiary
for more than 480 convicts in 1857.
Off the coast of Port Arthur is the Isle of the Dead, where around 1,770
convicts and 180 free settlers are buried, mostly in mass graves with no
headstones.
Port Arthur’s gruesome history has been added to by modern events. In
1996, the Port Arthur Historic Site became the scene of one of Australia’s
worst mass murders, when a Hobart man armed with three high-powered
automatic firearms killed a total of 35 people. Dozens more were injured.
The devastating events encouraged Australians to question laws on the
private ownership of automatic and semiautomatic firearms and resulted
in new gun control laws that are among the strictest in the world. The
gunman was sentenced to life imprisonment with no eligibility for parole.
Events of this terrible day remain forever with the staff at Port Arthur,
many of whom lost close friends, colleagues, and family members.
Because they still find it difficult and painful to talk about, visitors are
requested not to ask their guide about these events, but to instead read
the plaque at the Memorial Garden.
Maria Island, Tasmania
A penal settlement was established at Darlington, on Tasmania’s Maria
Island, in 1825. This was for convicts who committed offences within the
colony, but who were not bad enough to be banished to Macquarie
Harbour on Tasmania’s west coast. The first 50 prisoners (all men) and
soldiers were housed in bark huts and tents. Supplies were short and
the men lived on “fish and fowl.” Many suffered from scurvy and ulcers.
But it can’t have been all bad — it was later reported that some convicts
deliberately committed minor offences to be sent to this island “of ease
and pleasure.” Many of the permanent buildings erected later, such as
the Commissariat Store and the penitentiary, can be visited today.
Frequent escape attempts and the opening of Port Arthur led to the
abandonment of the settlement in 1832.
Only ten years later, in 1842, a second period of convict settlement on
the island began. Probation stations for convicts were established at
Darlington and Point Lesueur. Around 600 men were housed in existing
and new buildings at Darlington, and you can stay in these today, in
hostel-style accommodations for less than A$25 (US$20/£10) a night (for
more information visit www.discovertasmania.com.au). At Point
Lesueur, the ruins of the old cells still stand.
Maria Island’s most famous prisoner was the Irish rebel William Smith
O’Brien. A political prisoner convicted of high treason, O’Brien was a
British Member of Parliament and an Irish freedom fighter. On arriving in
1849, O’Brien wrote, “ . . . to find a gaol in one of the loveliest spots
formed by the hand of Nature in one of her loneliest solitudes creates a
Part VIII: The Part of Tens 
492

revulsion of feeling I cannot describe.” He spent less than a year on
Maria Island before being moved to Port Arthur, but you can find a dis-
play devoted to his life and times in one of the penitentiary cells.
Maria Island is reached by ferry from Triabunna, about an hour’s drive
from Hobart along the east coast.
Fremantle Prison, Western Australia
This limestone jail was built by convict labor to house 1,000 inmates.
The first convicts came to Western Australia at the request of local mer-
chants and politicians to provide cheap labor for the building of roads,
bridges, and jetties for the colony. The first ship carrying 75 convicts
arrived at Fremantle on June 1, 1850.
Work on the prison began in 1852 and by 1855 enough was complete for
the convicts to be transferred to the site from their temporary jail. The
prison was completed by 1859. Six houses were constructed on the west-
ern side of the prison for the senior officers.
Cells have been re-created in the style of past periods of the jail’s his-
tory. Among them you’ll find the “escape-proof” cell of Joseph Bolitho
Johns or “Moondyne Joe,” one of the more colorful characters who
spent years in and out of Fremantle Prison, after being initially trans-
ported from Wales in 1853 for stealing food.
Other features of interest include the gallows, workshops, chapel, hospi-
tal, jailers’ houses, and cell walls featuring artwork by former inmates.
The precinct also includes a women’s prison and commissariat.
Fremantle Prison was the last convict establishment built in Australia,
marking the end of transportation with the arrival of the convict ship
Hougoumont in January 1868. By the time transportation ceased, more
than 9,700 convicts had been transported to Western Australia. It
remained a maximum-security prison until 1991.
St. Helena Island: “The Hell 
Hole of the Pacific”
From 1867 to 1932, a small island in Brisbane’s Moreton Bay was known as
“the hell hole of the Pacific” to the nearly 4,000 souls incarcerated there.
Discipline on the prison island of St. Helena was iron-fisted, with severe
punishments — the lash, the dark underground cells, the gag, and the
shot drill — meted out to those who stepped out of line. Bars on the win-
dows and leg irons were further deterrents. Tough measures were called
for because St. Helena housed some of Australia’s worst criminals. In
Chapter 24: Ten Convict Connections 493

1891, for example, there were 17 murderers, 27 men convicted of
manslaughter, 26 men convicted of stabbings and shootings, and count-
less others who had been convicted of assault, rape, and other violent
crimes.
Because of this, St. Helena had to be secure — and it was. Drowning and
shark attacks were fierce deterrents. Queensland’s bushrangers —
including the infamous Captain Starlight — murderers and thieves toiled
together to build this unique prison system using locally quarried stone
held together with cement made from the island’s lime kiln. By the turn
of the century, St. Helena had more than 300 prisoners, housed in a maze
of buildings surrounded by a high wall. It operated as a self-sufficient
settlement, and even exported some of its produce to the mainland,
including bricks for many of Brisbane’s buildings.
Today, the prison ruins are a tourist attraction, with a small museum in
the restored and reconstructed Deputy Superintendent’s Cottage. Entry
is by guided tour only, and you can visit the ruins of the blacksmith
shop, punishment yard, sugar mill, prisoners, warders and children’s
cemetery, lime kiln, as well as the olive grove.
Commissariat Store, Brisbane
Brisbane was a penal colony from 1825 until 1839. The original Moreton
Bay convict station was established at Redcliffe in September 1824, but
this site was abandoned after a few months in favor of the Brisbane site,
20km (13 miles) up the Brisbane River. By 1831, there were 1,066 con-
victs and 175 soldiers living here.
The Commissariat Store, in William Street, is believed to be Brisbane’s
first stone structure and is among the few remaining relics of Brisbane’s
convict era. It was constructed by convict laborers from 1828 to 1829 as
a two-story building, with a third story added in 1913. The building now
houses the Royal Historical Society of Queensland.
The Old Windmill, Brisbane
The only other convict-built structure remaining in Brisbane today
(besides the Commissariat Store — see the preceding section) is the old
windmill on Wickham Terrace. Built in 1828 under the command of the
feared and loathed Captain Patrick Logan, the Commandant of the
colony, the mill was constructed to grind maize.
Why, you may ask as you gaze at this “windmill,” are there no sails on it?
Well, it was originally fitted with heavy sails but due to a mechanical
flaw, they failed to work properly. And this is where the convicts enter
the picture again: Wind power was replaced by the “never-ending stair-
case” of a treadmill, where convicts were forced to work as punishment,
Part VIII: The Part of Tens 
494

almost as dreaded as the lash. The treadmill was used from 1829 to 1837,
when the windmill was repaired.
At least one public hanging took place here, in 1841, with the projecting
arms of the windmill used as a gallows. After free settlement, the wind-
mill became a signal station in 1861, and later served as an observatory,
a fire lookout, and a television transmission tower.
You can’t enter the windmill, but you can admire the outside from
Wickham Terrace, and most tour buses include it on their routes.

Ten Expressions You 
Need to Know
In This Chapter
 Deciphering the meaning of Australian slang
 Hoping no one is insulting you
T
he Aussie version of the English language can be largely attributed
to convicts who created new words and expressions to add color to
their conversations or to conceal their ideas from the authorities. In this
chapter, we introduce you to some common Australian expressions you
may well come across.
Buckley’s Chance
No chance at all, as in: “You’ve got Buckley’s chance, mate!” Some claim
it comes from the name of the convict William Buckley, who escaped
from Port Phillip in 1803 and lived for 32 years with Aborigines.
Dag
Someone who dresses badly, as in: “He’s a dag.” Dags are clumps of
matted wool and dung that hang around a sheep’s rear end. The word
dag (originally daglock) was a British dialect word that entered main-
stream Australian English in the late 19th century.
Drongo
In the early 1920s, an Australian racehorse called Drongo came very
close to winning major races, but in 37 starts he never won a race. Soon
after the horse’s retirement, racing fans started to use the term for other
horses that were having similarly unlucky careers. Soon after, the term
became more negative, and was applied also to people who were hope-
less cases or used to describe a fool, a stupid person, or a simpleton. So
if you’re called a drongo, it’s not a compliment!

Dunny
A toilet — though it’s not one of the more polite versions of the word.
The dunny was originally any outside toilet. The word comes from
British dialect dunnekin meaning “dung-house.”
Fair Dinkum
“It’s true!” or “Is that true?”, depending on the context and inflection.
Some people believe it originated in the 1850s, during the Australian
gold rushes, when thousands of Chinese laborers came to Australia in a
bid to make their fortune. It’s possibly derived from the Cantonese ding
kam, meaning “top gold.” It may also originate from the East Midlands
dialect in England, where dinkum meant “hard work” or “fair work.”
G’day
You’ve certainly heard this one! And it really is the standard Australian
greeting, used at any time of the day or night, though it’s not used as an
alternative to farewell, as good day might be in other countries.
Hard Yakka
Hard work! This expression is derived from yakka — an Aboriginal word
for “work,” from a language once spoken in the Brisbane region.
Stubby
A short, squat beer bottle often encased in a stubby holder (a foam
casing) in warmer climates. The stereotypical Australian male is often
depicted drinking a stubby, while dressed in a pair of stubbies (the trade
name for a pair of men’s brief shorts).
Tucker
This common Aussie slang word refers to food, as in: “Fancy some
tucker?” By the late 18th century, it had developed its association with
the consumption of food and drink. So, a school canteen is a tuckshop,
and bush tucker is wild food.
You Right?
“Do you need my help?” It’s often used by salespeople and is the
Australian equivalent of “Are you being served?” or “May I help you?”

Area Codes
Each Australian state has a different area
code: 02 for New South Wales and the
Australian Capital Territory; 07 for Queens-
land; 03 for Victoria and Tasmania; 08 for
South Australia, the Northern Territory, 
and Western Australia. You must dial the
appropriate code if you’re calling to a state
other than the one you’re in; however, you
also need to use the code if you’re calling
outside the city you’re in. For example if
you’re in Sydney, where the code is 02 and
you want to call another New South Wales
town, you still dial 02 before the number.

or by calling % 1800/637 642.
Customs
When entering Australia, as well as when
returning home, keep in mind Customs
restrictions.

Australia is a signatory to the Convention
on International Trade in Endangered
Species (CITES), which restricts or bans
the import of products made from pro-
tected wildlife. Examples of the restricted
items are alligator, bear, coral, crocodile,
giant clam, monkeys, wild cats, zebra, as
well as American ginseng, some types of
caviar, and orchid products. Banned items
include ivory, rhinoceros products, stur-
geon caviar, tortoise (marine turtle) shell,
and tiger products. Keep this in mind if you
stop in other countries en route to Australia,
where souvenirs like these may be sold.
Australian authorities may seize these
items. (Some of these items are also
banned in the U.S., Canada, and Great
Britain, so check first before you leave
your home country.)
Because Australia is an island, it is free of
many agricultural and livestock diseases
and invokes strict quarantine laws for
importing plants, animals, and their prod-
ucts, including food. Dogs at Australian
airports detect these products (as well as
drugs). Amnesty trash bins are available
before you reach the immigration counters
for items such as fruit.
Don’t be alarmed if, just before landing, the
flight attendants spray the aircraft cabin
(with products approved by the World
Health Organization) to kill potentially 
disease-bearing insects. For more informa-
tion on what is and is not allowed, contact
the nearest Australian embassy or con-
sulate, or Australia’s Department of Agri-
culture, Fisheries, and Forestry, which runs
the Australian Quarantine and Inspection
Service (% 02/6272 3933; www.affa.
gov.au). Its Web site has a list of
restricted or banned foods, animal and
plant products, and other items.
A helpful brochure, available from Austra-
lian consulates or Customs offices, as well
as online, is Know Before You Go. For more
information, contact the Customs Infor-
mation and Support Centre (% 1300/363

Driving
In Australia, drive on the left side of the
road. Seat belts are compulsory for 
everyone.
The speed limit is 50kmph (31 mph) or
60kmph (37 mph) in urban areas, 100kmph
(62 mph) in most country areas, and some-
times 110kmph (68 mph) on freeways. In
the Northern Territory, the speed limit is
130kmph (80 mph) on the Stuart, Arnhem,
Barkly, and Victoria highways, while rural
roads are designated 110kmph (68 mph)
speed limits unless otherwise signposted.
The emergency breakdown assistance
telephone number for every Australian
auto club is % 13 11 11 from anywhere in
Appendix: Quick Concierge 499

Australia. It is billed as a local call. If you
aren’t a member of an auto club at home
that has a reciprocal agreement with the
Australian clubs, you’ll have to join the
Australian club on the spot before the club
will tow or repair your car. Most car rental
companies also have emergency assis-
tance numbers.
Electricity
The current in Australia is 240 volts AC, 50
hertz. Sockets take two or three flat, not
rounded, prongs. North Americans and
Europeans will need to buy a converter
before they leave home. (Don’t wait until
you get to Australia; Australian stores are
likely to stock only converters to fit Ameri-
can and European outlets.) Some large
hotels have 110V outlets for electric
shavers (or dual voltage), and some may
have converters you can borrow — but
don’t count on it. Power does not start
automatically when you plug in an appli-
ance; you need to flick the switch beside
the socket to the “on” position.
Embassies and Consulates
Most diplomatic posts are in Australia’s
capital, Canberra. Embassies or con-
sulates with posts in state capitals are
listed in “Fast Facts” in the relevant state
chapters of this book.
In case you lose your passport or have
some other emergency, here’s a list of
addresses and phone numbers:
Britain: The high commission is on
Commonwealth Avenue, Canberra, ACT
2601 (% 02/6270 6666). There are also con-
sulates in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane,
and Perth.
Canada: The high commission is on
Commonwealth Avenue, Yarralumla, ACT
2600 (% 02/6270 4000). There are con-
sulates in Sydney, Melbourne, and Perth.
Ireland: The embassy is at 20 Arkana St.,
Yarralumla, ACT 2600 (% 02/6273 3022).
There are also consulates in Melbourne
and Perth.
United States: The embassy is at 21 Moonah

police, ambulance, or the fire department.
The call is free from public and private
telephones. The TTY emergency number 
is % 106.
Information
See “Where to Get More Information”
later in this appendix, to find out where to
get visitor information before you leave
home.
Internet Access and Cybercafes
Internet access is available just about
everywhere in Australia, including some
small Outback towns, which generally
have at least one cybercafe, coin-operated
machines, or both. Coin-op terminals are
available at larger airports. Major tourist
towns, such as Darwin and Cairns, have
whole streets full of cybercafes. Public
libraries in small towns are often a good
place to get Internet access, too.
Liquor Laws
The minimum legal drinking age is 18. Pubs
are usually open daily from around 10 a.m.
or noon, to 10 p.m. or midnight, although
hours vary slightly from place to place.
Random breath tests to catch drunk drivers
are common, and drunk-driving laws are
strictly enforced. Getting caught drunk
behind the wheel will mean a court
appearance. The maximum permitted blood
alcohol level for driving is 0.05 percent.
Australia For Dummies, 1st Edition 
500

Alcohol is sold in liquor stores, in the
“bottle shops” attached to every pub, and
in supermarkets in some states.
Maps
Two of the biggest map publishers in Aus-
tralia are HEMA Maps (% 07/3340 0000;
www.hemamaps.com.au) and Universal
Publishers (% 1800/021 987 in Australia, or
02/9857 3700; www.universalpress-
online.com). Both publish an extensive
range of national, state, regional, and city
maps.
HEMA has a strong list of regional maps,
while Universal produces a complete
range of street directories by city, region,
or state under the UBD and Gregory’s
labels. HEMA produces four-wheel-drive
and motorbike road atlases and many
regional four-wheel-drive maps (good if
you plan to go off the trails), an atlas of
Australia’s national parks, and maps to
Kakadu and Lamington national parks.
Both companies produce national road
atlases. Universal’s UBD Complete
Motoring Atlas of Australia publishes
street maps of regional towns in each
state.
Australian auto clubs, visitor information
centers, bigger newsdealers, and book-
stores are your best sources for maps. Gas
stations usually only stock a limited local
range. Maps published by state automobile
associations will likely be free if you are a
member of an affiliated auto club in your
home country, but you’ll have to pick them
up on arrival. Remember to bring your auto
club membership card to qualify for dis-
counts or free maps.
Police
Dial % 000 anywhere in Australia for
police. This call is free from public and 
private telephones.
Post Office
For general information about postal serv-
ices call % 13 13 18 anywhere in Austra-
lia. A postcard costs A$1.25 (US$1/£0.50) to
send anywhere in the world. A card will
take up to six working days to reach the
United States. Post boxes are red.
Safety
Australia is generally safe, but as any-
where else, it pays to keep your wits about
you, particularly in major cities, such as
Sydney.
Smoking
Australia has strict anti-smoking laws, so
always ask if it’s okay before you light up.
Smoking is restricted or banned in most
public places, including museums, cin-
emas, and theaters. Smoking in restau-
rants may be limited — Western Australia
and New South Wales ban it altogether,
and in many other states, restaurants have
smoking and nonsmoking sections. In most
states, there are total bans in pubs and
clubs. South Australia will introduce these
bans in 2008, joining Queensland, Tasmania,
Western Australia, Victoria, the Australian
Capital Territory, and New South Wales.
Only in the Northern Territory can you still
light up in some parts of a pub.
Taxes
Australia applies a 10 percent Goods and
Services Tax (GST) on most products and
services, including airline tickets bought
within Australia (although your interna-
tional airline tickets to Australia are not
taxed, nor are domestic airline tickets for
travel within Australia if you bought them
outside Australia).
You can claim a refund of the GST through
the Tourist Refund Scheme (TRS) — and
also of a 14.5 percent Wine Equalisation
Tax (WET) — if you’ve purchased more
Appendix: Quick Concierge 501

than A$300 (US$240/£120) from a single
outlet, within the last 30 days before you
leave. See Chapter 5 for details on how to
claim your refund. Call the Australian
Customs Service (% 1300/363 263 or
02/6275 6666) for more information. Items
bought in duty-free stores will not be
charged GST.
Basic groceries are not subject to the GST,
but restaurant meals are.
Visitors to the Great Barrier Reef will be
charged a “reef tax,” officially known as
the Environmental Management Charge, of
A$5 (US$4/£2) per person every time you
enter the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park.
Telephone
For directory assistance, dial % 12455 for
a number in Australia, and dial 1225 for
numbers to all other countries.
To call Australia from the United States, dial
the international access code 011 (or 00
from the U.K., Ireland, or New Zealand),
then the country code 61, followed by the
city code (drop the 0 from any area code
given in this book), and then the number. To
make international calls from Australia,
first dial 0011 and then the country code,
followed by the area code and number. An
international online telephone card such
as ekit (www.ekit.com) will allow you to
call overseas at much cheaper rates.
Numbers beginning with 1800 within
Australia are toll-free, but calling a U.S.
toll-free number from Australia is not toll-
free. In fact, it costs the same as an over-
seas call.
Numbers starting with 13 or 1300 in Aus-
tralia are charged at the local fee of A25¢
(US20¢/£0.10) per minute anywhere in
Australia. Numbers beginning with 1900 (or
1901 and so on) are pay-for-service lines,
and you will be charged as much as A$5
(US$4/£2) a minute.
Telstra pay phones are found in most city
streets, shopping centers, transport termi-
nals, post offices, and along highways —
even in some of the most remote areas of
Australia. To find the nearest one, call 
% 1800/011 433 or go to www.telstra.
com.au/payphoneservices/index.
htm. The cost of a local call from a pay
phone is A$0.50 (US$0.40/£0.20), either in
coins or by using a phone card. Some
phones only take prepaid phone cards,
which you can purchase from newsdealers
and other retailers in denominations of
A$5, A$10, and A$20, and are good for
local, national, and international calls.
There are no access numbers — you just
insert the card and dial. Credit phones take
most major credit cards. In addition to the
pay phones in the usual booths, you may
find some called “blue phones” or “gold
phones” inside convenience stores.
Time Zone
Australian Eastern Standard Time (AEST or
just EST) covers Queensland, New South
Wales, the Australian Capital Territory,
Victoria, and Tasmania. Central Standard
Time (CST) is used in the Northern Territory
and South Australia. Western Standard
Time (WST) is the standard in Western
Australia. When it’s noon in New South
Wales, the Australian Capital Territory,
Victoria, Queensland, and Tasmania, it’s
11:30 a.m. in South Australia and the
Northern Territory, and 10 a.m. in Western
Australia. All states except Queensland,
the Northern Territory, and Western
Australia observe daylight saving time,
usually from the first Sunday in October to
the first Sunday in April. However, not all
states switch to daylight saving on the
same day or in the same week.
Australia For Dummies, 1st Edition 
502

Australia’s east coast is GMT (Greenwich
Mean Time) plus ten hours. When it’s noon
on the east coast, it’s 2 a.m. in London (the
same day) and 6 p.m. in Los Angeles and 
9 p.m. in New York (the previous day). These
times are based on standard time, so 
allow for daylight saving in the Australian
summer, or in the country you’re calling.
New Zealand is two hours ahead of the
east coast of Australia, except during 
daylight saving, when it’s three hours
ahead of Queensland.
Weather Updates
Two good Web sites to keep you up to date
with the weather where you’re going are
the Weather Channel (www.weather
channel.com.au) and the Australian
Bureau of Meteorology (www.bom.
