Table 1 presents Arabic letters. The Arabic writing system is cursive, 
from right to left. Each letter can have two or four shapes depending 
on where it connects with other letters. Some letters connect only 
from one direction – the right direction of course – and thus have two 
possible shapes. Most Arabic letters connect from right and left and 
thus have four possible shapes. The shapes are not arbitrary; you will 
easily be able to figure out the patterns. The following table presents 
Arabic letters. Column one shows all the letters and their different 
shapes. Column two gives the name of the letter. Column three shows 
the transliteration symbol adopted in this book, and column four 
shows the corresponding sound in English or gives a very brief 
description of the sound. For a detailed explanation of Arabic sounds, 
see the Introduction.
Table 2 below presents letters that represent long vowels and 
diphthongs. Diphthongs are found in words such as ‘boy’, ‘eye’, ‘out’. 
Sometimes long vowels can be pronounced short. Usually, short vowels 
are represented by symbols or diacritics. Arabic has several diacritics 
that express durational differences of vowels and consonants, and 
can also express other grammatical functions such as definiteness: 
whether the noun is definite or indefinite. At this stage, I will present 
them for help in pronunciation. Detailed explanations will follow in 
subsequent units. In Table 3, items 1, 2 and 3 express short vowels. 
Item 4 explicitly indicates the absence of a vowel. Item 5 is written 
over consonants to indicate that this is a geminate, i.e., the consonant 
is longer than its single counterpart. This change usually serves a change 
of meaning. Items 6, 7 and 8 are copies of items 1, 2 and 3 with the 
addition of an /n/ sound. The last three diacritics serve grammatical 
functions. The first four essentially serve pronunciation except if they 
come at the end of nouns in which case, they serve grammatical 
functions, too. Notice that items 3 and 8 are written under the line. 
Generally, all diacritics are not used in most written texts (e.g., news-
papers, etc.). They are understood by virtue of context.

استوطن فيها البشر منذ قديم الزمان. فقد نشأت الحضارات 
اآلشورية و السومرية الكنعانية و الفنيقية في بالد الشام. كما 
ظهرت أيضاً حضارات العرب األنباط في مدينتي تدمر في 
سوريا و البتراء في األردن. و كانت بالد الرافدين موطن 
حضارة نبوخذ نصّر الذي أقام فيها دولة عظيمة. أما مصر 
فكانت حاضنة الحضارة الفرعونية التي امتدت لسنوات 
طويلة. و شهدت الجزيرة العربية مولد الجنس العربي 
المعروف حالياً. فنشأت في اليمن جنوباً مملكة سبأ و حمير. 
ثم ازدهرت الحضارة العربية قبل اإلسالم في مكة. و بعد 
ظهور اإلسالم امتدت الحضارة العربية اإلسالمية خارج 
الجزيرة العربية فوصلت إلى بالد الشام و العراق و مصر، 
ثم انتقلت إلى شمال افريقيا و وسطها و حتى االندلس التي 
بنى فيها المسلمون حضارة مشرقة عاشت أكثر من أربعمئة 
عام. و ما زال أكثر العرب يتغنون بهذا الماضي التليد.

Introduction
Arabic sound system (Audio 1.1–1.2)
Arabic is a Semitic language. The Semitic language family has only 
three other living languages in it: Amharic, Hebrew and Maltese. It is 
therefore likely that your own native language belongs to a different 
family, and that you will probably be unfamiliar with the Arabic sound 
system. Arabic has 28 letters that represent consonants and long 
vowels, and also several other diacritics and symbols to represent 
short vowels and pronunciation markers. The great majority of these 
letters, diacritics and symbols are present in all dialects of Arabic. 
Nonetheless, each dialect tends to have an inventory of its own in 
which certain sounds are present or absent compared to the common 
Modern Standard Arabic (MSA). This book is dedicated to Levantine 
Arabic (LA), a dialect spoken in present-day Syria, Lebanon, Palestine, 
Jordan and Israel. While LA is the general term to refer to this dialect 
region, there are also other sub-classifications based on political 
boundaries, (Shami or Syrian, Lebanese, Palestinian and Jordanian), 
or based on socio-cultural classifications (urban, rural and Bedouin). 
This chapter introduces the following topics:
• Arabic sound system
• Pronunciation of Arabic
• Arabic stress
• A note on socio-phonetics
• Consonant clusters

Introduction	
xv
It is beyond the scope of this book to address these classifications 
in depth, unless necessary for cultural awareness. The dialect adopted 
in this book is LA – the one that is likely to be understood by all 
people living in the Levant and by a great majority of Arabs. LA is 
second only to Egyptian Arabic in terms of its spread and intelligibility 
in the Arab world.
Pronunciation of Arabic
As a point of departure, let us try to understand how words are made 
up. Linguists use the word “phoneme” to refer to the distinctive sounds 
that make up words. For example, the word “beat” has four letters: 
(b, e, a, t) but three distinct sounds – three phonemes: /b, i, t/. It is 
important to understand the difference between phonemes and letters 
since phonemes belong to the sound system whereas letters belong 
to the writing system. When describing sounds, certain parameters are 
used to describe consonants and vowels of any language. A change 
in one of the parameters can result in a change of the phoneme, hence 
altering word meaning or rendering the word meaningless. Below is 
a more detailed discussion of Arabic consonants and vowels.
Arabic consonants
Generally, consonants are described based on three parameters:
• voicing: whether the vocal folds vibrate (voiced) or not (voiceless) 
during sound production;
• place of articulation: which speech organs come together, or are 
activated during sound production;
• manner of articulation: airstream mechanism – complete to minimal 
air blockage.
Performance exercise: to be able to feel vocal fold vibrations, try 
producing the two English sounds /s, z/ and see what sets their 
pronunciation apart. Produce a continuum: start with an /s/ and finish 
in a /z/, e.g. sssssssszzzzzzz. Now focus on the extra movement you 
will be making. Cover your ears completely using your palms, and 
produce the continuum. You will notice that once you move from  

xvi	
Introduction
s to z, you feel a clear increase in the level of noise. This noise is 
due to the vocal fold vibrations. /s/ and /z/ are only different at this 
level: /s/ is voiceless whereas /z/ is voiced. Practice this difference 
as it will be utilized with a number of sounds.
For place of articulation, you need to watch your lips, tongue and 
teeth. You can observe these movements using a mirror while saying 
some sounds. Of course, some sounds are produced further back  
in the vocal tract, which can make them hard to see. But you can 
still feel the different movements of your tongue.
As for manner of articulation, try pronouncing /t/ and /s/. You will 
notice that for /t/, air is completely blocked, then completely blown 
out in an explosive burst, whereas air keeps coming out at almost 
the same pace for /s/.
Two other parameters are not often mentioned: whether the con-
sonant is oral (produced in the mouth), or nasal (produced in the nose); 
and whether the consonant is lateral (in which case, the central part of 
the tongue forms a bulge) or central. Arabic has two nasal consonants 
/m, n/ and one lateral sound /l/. The distinction between light and 
dark /l/, as in capable and lamb respectively, is found in Arabic, though 
it has nothing to with the lateral.
One additional parameter that is characteristic of Arabic is emphasis: 
whether the consonant is emphatic. Emphatic consonants are best 
described by comparing them to their plain counterparts. For example, 
a plain Arabic /s/ is identical to the English /s/. An emphatic /S/, how­
ever, requires the lowering of the tongue in the posterior vocal tract. 
This new secondary place of articulation results in a new phoneme 
in Arabic. Arabic has four emphatic consonants (represented in upper 
case in the transliteration system), usually contrasted with their plain 
counterparts: /s, S/, /t, T/, /d, D/ and /dh, DH/.
Performance exercise: Produce a continuous /s/ sound, for  
example, sssssss. Make sure your lips are neutral, that is, not rounded 
(lips are rounded when you produce the vowel in the word blue).  
As you’re producing this sound continuously, lower your lower jaw  
a little. It can help if you introduce a little lip-rounding along with the 
jaw-lowering movement. It is likely that you will continue not to feel 
the difference since plain–emphatic differences are highlighted within 
a vocalic environment. The least you can get from this exercise is 
producing a different /S/ sound that feels just a little further back 
compared to your normal English /s/.

Introduction	
xvii
Now that your phonetic taste buds are stirred up a little, it is time 
to present a more detailed and systematic description of Arabic 
sounds. I will discuss only the sounds that do not have a generally 
identical counterpart in English and those which seem to have a  
counterpart but come with a description of their own. The goal is not 
to get into the nitty-gritty differences of seemingly identical sounds. 
For example, there is a strong argument that Arabic /t/ is slightly 
different from the English /t/. Validating this claim or arguing against 
it is not within the scope of this discussion since the alleged differ-
ences do not render the word unintelligible and do not change it  
to a different phoneme. And who claims that all English /t/ sounds 
are identical? Anyway, there are different sociolinguistic levels of 
variation in LA. The most common of these levels will be presented. 
It is highly recommended that the learner grasps them. By so doing, 
learners are more likely to understand faster and to sound more 
natural.
As illustrated earlier in the transliteration key, each letter in Arabic 
can come in either two or four shapes depending on its position in 
a given word. It should be noted here that Arabic writing is cursive 
whether handwritten or typed: letters can join from the right and left 
or only from the right. I will present the Arabic alphabet in isolation, 
along with its transliteration symbol. The pronunciation description  
is also presented in isolation – that is, free from the effects of co-
articulation, which will be briefly discussed in this introduction.
  1	/ أʔ/: the closest to this sound is the glottal plosive. Think of the 
Cockney pronunciation of the sound /t/ in the word button. During 
the pronunciation of this sound, air is completely blocked below 
the glottis, and then released abruptly. It is commonly accepted 
that most English words that begin with a vowel essentially start 
with a glottal plosive.
Performance exercise: repeat the vowel in “egg” several times. You 
will notice that you produce a series of glottal plosives with every 
repetition of the vowel.
  2	/ ثth/: as in three. This sound is identical to its English counter-
part. The reason I am mentioning it here is that its pronunciation 
sometimes varies between different genders or social classes: 
urban vs. rural. Most men and most rural people tend to pronounce 

xviii	
Introduction
this consonant as a (/th/: /thalaathih/ = three). Most women and 
most urban people tend to switch to a (/t/: /talaatih/ = three).
  3	/ جj/: this is identical to the first sound of the English word “jeal-
ous.” However, the gender/social class difference mentioned above  
applies here. Most women and most urban people tend to pro-
nounce this exactly like the last sound of the French word “rouge”.
  4	/ حH/: this sound is described as voiceless pharyngeal fricative.  
It has no English counterpart.
Performance exercise: using your thumb, push against your neck 
in the area above the glottis and down from the throat. Hold tight, 
and then blow air on a glass or a mirror so that the surface becomes 
foggy. Repeat this process and listen well to the sound produced. 
This is the closest sound to an Arabic /H/. Also, notice that when  
you blow air, the part of your neck pushed against your thumb is  
the pharynx: the place of articulation where air is making friction to 
produce the sound.
  5	/ خx/: this is a sound similar to ch in German “loch.”
  6	/ رr/: the Arabic /r/ sound is not like any in most dialects of 
English. Arabic /r/ is closer to a trill: the tongue is pulled a little 
forward, then the tip of the tongue touches the alveolar ridge 
once. This is the area right behind the upper teeth. The closest 
is the Spanish /r/ in “pero” meaning “but.” You can easily feel the 
pronunciation of an Arabic /r/ by rolling a number of /r/s /rrrrrrr/; 
any one of them in this production makes a very good Arabic /r/.
  7	/ صS/: this sound is an emphatic counterpart to the English /s/. 
The primary place of articulation of this sound is the alveolar  
ridge. When producing an /s/ sound, the tongue goes up to that 
region. To be able to produce an Arabic /S/, you want to produce 
an English /s/, and then pull your lower jaw just a little bit back. 
What happens is that you will have to lower the back part of  
the tongue, which pulls it further back. This back movement is 
secondary, since the primary constriction is still at the alveolar 
ridge. But, as explained above, it is hard to feel the difference in 
the absence of a vowel. This mechanism is still very important 
since it is pervasive in other Arabic consonants.
  8	/ ضD/: this sound is the emphatic counterpart of the English  
/d/. The same secondary movement explained above should be 
applied here.

Introduction	
xix
  9	/ طT/: this sound is the emphatic counterpart to the English /t/.
10	/ ظDH/: this sound is the emphatic counterpart to the first sound 
in “the.”
A note that applies to all emphatic consonants is that it helps to 
produce them in pairs, each along with its plain counterpart, for 
example, /s/ vs. /S/. When doing so, you should be able to feel that 
the emphatic consonant is always a little further back compared to 
its plain counterpart. Keep in mind that the differences are best high-
lighted with the help of the vocalic environment. Still, this juxtaposition 
should help you feel a very important aspect of the difference.
11	/ ع3/: This sound has no English counterpart. The closest sound 
to this is the Arabic /H/ described above. However, this sound is 
voiced, i.e., it is accompanied with vocal fold vibrations. Think of 
the sound one might produce if you were being strangled.
12	/ غgh/: voiced velar fricative. This sound is produced in the same 
place of articulation of an English /g/. The difference is that this 
sound is a fricative. In /g/, the air is completely blocked, then 
released. In /gh/, the constriction is never complete; therefore, 
the air continues to come out. The closest to this sound is /r/ in 
French “rouge.” One non-speech sound in English that is similar 
to /gh/ is the sound you produce while gargling.
Performance exercise: prepare your vocal tract for the production 
of an English /g/. While maintaining the same vocal tract con­
figuration, open up the constriction, which must be on the velar  
area, and produce a continuous sound. This will be closest to the 
Arabic /gh/.
Arabic vowels (Audio 1.3)
Vowels are described based on four parameters:
• height: whether the tongue is in high, middle or low position in 
relation to the upper jaw;
• frontness: whether the tongue is front, central or back;
• lip rounding: whether lips are rounded or not;
• length: whether the vowel is long or short.

Introduction
Two phonetic terms are helpful when talking about vowels: quality 
and quantity. Vowel quality refers to tongue height: how high or low 
the tongue is during the production of a given vowel. Vowel quantity 
refers to duration: how much time it takes to produce a certain vowel 
while maintaining the same quality. For example, the vowels in beat 
and in bat are different in terms of quality: each involves a different 
degree of mouth opening – a different tongue position on the high-low 
parameter, and in quantity: generally /i/ is longer than /æ/.
LA has four long vowels and four short vowels. Each pair has two 
vowels that are only different in terms of quantity, not quality. To 
clarify this point, it is believed among phoneticians that if you were 
to multiply the vowel in bit, you will never get the vowel in beat since 
the two vowels are different not only in terms of quantity but also  
in terms of quality. But for a native speaker of Arabic, /nam/ the 
imperative form of the verb to sleep, and /naam/, the past form of 
the same verb are only phonetically different in terms of the quantity 
of the vowel; i.e., the fact that the vowel in the second word is  
only longer than its counterpart in the first word. If this difference is 
understood, learners of Arabic should not face a great deal of difficulty 
in learning Arabic vowels.
Duration
Duration of consonants and vowels is very significant in Arabic  
language. What does this really mean? To further clarify, here is a 
new phonetic concept: phonemic vs. allophonic variation. A phonemic 
variation is one that involves the change of a given phoneme. I 
explained above that this change results either in a new word, or 
renders a given word meaningless. An allophonic variation does not 
result in a change of meaning, or in distorting a given word; rather, it 
introduces a dialectal variation. Let’s consider the following examples 
from English:
Example 1a: ham vs. hat
Example 1b: AmE. basil vs. BrE. basil
In 1a, the phonetic variation is changing the last phoneme: /m/ 
becomes /t/. This change results in a change of meaning. This is  
an example of phonemic variation. In 1b, the phonetic variation is 

Introduction	
xxi
changing the first vowel: /eı/ becomes /æ/. This change does not 
result in a change of meaning but a listener who is familiar with English 
dialectology would be able to tell that the former is typical of American 
English and the latter is typical of British English.
Arabic obviously does this. But it also utilizes durational differences 
in the same manner. Vowels that are identical in terms of quality can 
become different phonemes at the level of quantity. When this differ-
ence manifests itself in vowels, we call them long and short vowels. 
The same durational differences can be utilized for most consonants, 
in which case, we call them single and geminate. Let’s consider the 
following examples:
Example 2a: katab	
to write
Example 2b: kaatab	 to exchange letters (to write back and forth)
Example 3a: daras	
to study
Example 3b: darras	
to teach
Obviously, the two words in 2 have a vocalic durational difference, 
and the two words in 3 have a consonantal durational difference. In 
both examples, this difference changed word meaning.
Arabic stress (Audio 1.4–1.5)
Stress is the relative prominence on a given syllable in a given word. 
Stress is phonemic in English but allophonic in Arabic; it changes 
word meaning in English but it does not do so in Arabic. Consider 
the following examples:
Example 4a: `present: current; of the time being; gift.
Example 4b: pre`sent: to give something to someone; to give a talk.
The importance of being sensitive to stress in Arabic is the fact that 
it helps the listener distinguish long from short vowels in a given word. 
Stress in Arabic is weight-sensitive. This means that the syllable that 
receives primary stress is generally heavier than other syllables in the 
same word. Syllable weight is measured by the number, type and 
position of the segments it is made of: long vowels are heavier than 
short vowels, which are heavier than consonants. Most of the time, 
geminates are broken across syllable boundaries. If a word of two  
or more syllables has equal distribution of weight across syllables, 

xxii	
Introduction
the syllable that receives stress is usually the one that is closest to 
the beginning of the word, i.e., left-most. These weight calculations 
drop the last consonant of a given word if the last syllable – having 
that consonant – is unstressed.
Example 5a: ku`weyt	
Kuwait
Example 5b: `tuunis	
Tunisia
Example 5c: `liibya	
Libya
Example 5d: `yaman	
Yemen
Example 5e: `qaTar	
Qatar
A note on socio-phonetics
Just like many, if not all, other languages, gender, social class, economic 
class, age, education, ethnic group, social relations, etc. play a role 
in the selection of a certain language variety. Most of these factors 
can be leveled or highlighted depending on different factors. Gender, 
however, remains one area that strongly controls speech varieties. 
Table 0.1 shows common male and female pronunciations.
Table 0.1  Socio-phonetic variations in Levantine Arabic
MSA
Levantine (female)
Levantine (male)
1ثth as in thalaathih (three)
t as in table
th as in three
2جj as in jaami3 (mosque)

dh as in dharab

DH as in DHalaam  
(darkness)
6قq as in qaal (he said)
ʔ (ʔaal)
g (gaal)
Notice the case in 4. In general, emphasis as a phonetic feature is 
more characteristic of male speech from a socio-phonetic point of 
view. Interdentals /th/, /dh/ and /DH/ are also associated with male 
speech. Females tend to use the plain, non-emphatic counterparts 
when they have to pronounce a word with emphatic consonants, and 
tend to use the alveolar allophones for all interdentals.

Introduction	
xxiii
Consonant clusters
One of the important issues to consider is consonantal adjacency: 
the fact that certain consonants are permissible neighbors in some 
languages/dialects but not in others. For example, Japanese language 
accepts the sequence of /ts/ in word-initial positions but English 
accepts this sequence only in word-final positions. LA has different 
types of word-initial consonant clusters. Modern Standard Arabic 
does not allow consonant clusters in word-initial positions at all. For 
example, the word for book is /kitaab/ in MSA but /ktaab/ in LA. As 
you listen to and read samples of LA, make sure you train yourself 
to recognize these clusters.
Root morphology
Word structure in Arabic is very systematic; it is almost mathematical. 
All content words – words that have independent meanings – have 
roots. This root is usually made up of three consonants, which linguists 
call radicals. Most content words have only three radicals in their 
roots, although some have more. All derivations of a given a root  
will have these three radicals. These radicals will always maintain  
their order regardless of any segments added as required by the  
different derivations. The derivations in turn follow certain templatic 
structures. Learning the different structures (ten templates) usually 
helps in making a learned guess at word meaning, if the root meaning 
is understood. In subsequent units, the concept of the root will  
be utilized, especially when new verbs are presented. Consider the 
following example.
Example 6: root is k, t, b. Root meaning: to write
Example 6a: katab: he wrote
Example 6b: katbat: she wrote
Example 6c: katabu: they (pl., masc.) wrote
Example 6d: kaatib: writer (sing., masc.)
Example 6e: maktuub: written
Example 6f: maktabih: library
Example 6g: ktaab: book
Example 6h: kutub: books

xxiv	
Introduction
The list goes on and on. Notice that in every derivation, the new word 
retains the root and maintains the order of the radicals. The meaning 
also has something related to the root meaning. In the vocabulary 
lists in subsequent units (Units One to Five), I will put the roots in 
brackets wherever a new content word is introduced. After that, readers 
are expected to be able to figure out the roots on their own.
Finally, wherever necessary, I will explain some phrases that are 
commonly used in LA. As you know, different languages express  
the same idea differently and one utterance might carry different 
meanings. Therefore, issues related to grammar, word order, word 
choice, cultural setting, history, etc. might sometimes make it impos-
sible for translations to capture both the meaning and the usage. In 
such cases, further explanations will be provided.

Introductions and greetings
When meeting people for the first time, you would usually introduce 
yourself. If there is a mutual friend of two or more people who 
do not know each other, s/he would be responsible for introducing 
people to each other. It is polite to introduce yourself to people you 
talk to for the first time. Greetings are part of introductions. They are 
common in all languages and cultures. Arab culture is in general 
full of greeting terminology. Historically, Arab culture placed a great 
importance on greetings. The Muslim tradition stipulates that “if you 
were greeted, reply with a better greeting.” The social strata remain 
intact in most Arab communities. These strata have to be recognized 
and respected. Greetings can vary based on different social relations, 
most prominently including gender and age differences. Other factors 
that come into play include the time of day or night, level of endear-
ment, formality, and whether one of the interlocutors has been absent 
for some time. Politeness is best expressed by the type of greeting 
one decides to use.
Greetings are conducted using one or more greeting expressions 
and a handshake. This is almost standard if one is introduced to 
someone else for the first time. To express a higher level of intimacy 
or if the two people are older friends, one additional gesture might 
be used: either exchanging a couple of air kisses while leaning towards 
the cheeks, or a hug on the right and left shoulders. The hugging 
gesture might be accompanied with a short light pat on the shoulder. 
In most communities, this is equally applicable within the same 
gender. Across-gender relations are different and can vary based on 
social class. Not observing gender differences in greetings might 
cause embarrassment or miscommunication. Across genders, women 
might choose to shake hands or might refuse to do so. So, a man 
being introduced to a woman for the first time should greet her and 
see if she extends her hand for a handshake. If she does, politeness 
dictates that the man should not decline the handshake. If she does 
not, it is polite on the part of the man not to initiate a handshake 
gesture. If the woman does not want to shake hands, she will either 
nod with a smile and verbal greeting or put her palm on her chest 
and extend only a verbal greeting, or use all of these gestures together. 

Unit 1:  Welcome!

Often women choose to do so due to a religious belief, fostered 
by cultural practices, that shaking hands with a foreigner (anyone 
who’s not a relative) is Haraam (forbidden from a religious point 
of view).
Table 1.1 below shows introductions and common greetings in LA 
and their possible responses, each separated by a semicolon, along

Leave-taking (Audio 1.8; 1.16–1.17)
Just like introductions are used to start a conversation, leave-taking 
is a polite form of ending the conversation. There are fewer expres-
sions for taking your leave and ending a conversation. But notice that, 
just as for greetings, people use more than one expression on the 
same occasion. In subsequent units, we will learn more advanced 
ways of taking your leave. Table 1.2 introduces a few very common

New expressions
abu ishshabaab: lit., father of/characterized by the youth. This is 
an honorific used mostly in casual settings. It is most commonly 
initiated by men (not women) addressing people likely to be of equal 
or lower status and/or age. People use this term to get someone’s 
attention for some service or to ask a question. This honorific is not 
used with anyone whose name is known by the caller. For example, 
you can use this term to get the waiter’s attention in a restaurant or 
a café. This is never used for women, or for elderly people.
abu ishshabaab, mumik kaasit shay?
Buddy, can I get a cup of tea?
Women usually use Sabaaya (sing. Sabiyyih, lit. woman) as an 
equivalent for addressing women.
bakkiir: lit., early. This term is used to express that you want some-
one to stay longer. It’s polite to express that you don’t want someone 
to leave yet.
You’ve invited some guests to your place and as one of them is  
getting ready to leave, you might say:
bakkiir ya sidi. xalliik ma3na.
[It’s] early sir, stay with us.
ba3d idhnak/idhnik: lit., with your permission. This is used 
when someone wants to leave. It’s a polite way to indicate 
leave-taking.
Grammar
The goal of the grammar explanations in this book is to foster under-
standing of the dialogues presented in each unit. Since the units 
gradually present more advanced levels of communication in Arabic, 
grammar targets will be presented accordingly. That is, the reader 
should expect several grammar targets to be expanded in subsequent 
units. Additionally, I will be presenting LA grammar along with MSA 
grammar where deemed appropriate. The reason is twofold: several 

Unit 1:  Welcome!

native speakers naturally use some form of MSA grammar when 
talking to Arabic language learners, and Arabic grammar is usually 
written for MSA. It is rather unlikely to find a grammar book for LA, 
unless it targets learners of this dialect. The grammar targets in 
this unit are essential for understanding the dialogues and using 
them.
One last thing is that I will mark stress throughout all examples in 
the book. Stress is the relative prominence given to one or more 
syllables of a given word. We will largely be dealing with one type of 
stress: primary stress.

choice depends on gender.
Arabic word structure is substantially different from that of European 
languages. In Arabic, pronouns can be independent words or can be 
part of a given word, in which case we call them possessive pronouns. 
Possessive pronouns are suffixes that attach to the end of nouns, 
verbs, prepositions and some question words. I will use one word in 
LA, ktaab (book) to present all possessive pronouns. Possessive 
pronouns are underlined for clarity.

Unit 1:  ahlan wa sahlan
Let’s explain the issues presented in Table 1.5 beginning with MSA. 
The definite article here is /al-/. You will notice that in examples 1–4, 
it’s simply added to beginning of the noun. In examples 5–8, you 
will notice that /l/ is dropped and the first consonant of the word in 
its indefinite form is geminated, i.e., doubled. This phenomenon is 
called assimilation: a tendency in languages whereby one sound is 
blended into another sound because both of them are pronounced 
similarly at some level. In this case, /l/ assimilates with all coronal 
sounds: sounds produced in the middle part of the vocal tract. Let’s 
remember that /l/ is pronounced in the alveolar ridge – a coronal 
position. Therefore, if the definite article precedes a noun that begins 
with a coronal sound, it deletes and, as compensation, the first sound 
is geminated. You can see that in examples 1–4, the first sound 
after the definite article is either produced further forward, anterior, 
or further back, dorsal, from /l/.
In LA, the same process described for MSA applies. Additionally, 
LA speakers switch the order of the two segments of the definite 
article. (/il-/ becomes /li-/). If you look closely, you will find the rule 
for doing so: the word begins with a consonant cluster: two or more 
consonants without a vowel in between. See examples 1 and 5.

Gender and number agreement
Arabic marks all nouns for gender: masculine and feminine, and for 
number: singular, dual and plural. Adjectives are also marked following 
the nouns they modify. Both nouns and adjectives must agree in 
terms of gender and number. Singular nouns that denote a masculine 
entity are not marked. Plural nouns and feminine nouns are marked 
for number and gender. There are, however, numerous nouns that 
are feminine by default, i.e., by virtue of what they denote. This will 
be explained in subsequent units. Feminine gender is marked by 
a suffix /-ih/. This suffix sometimes surfaces as /-it/. The rule will be 
introduced later. Proper names are self-explanatory: several feminine 
names naturally end in a /-ih/ but several others do not. Still, 
adjectives modifying a feminine name require a feminine suffix. Finally, 
the vowel in this feminine marker suffix is /i/ in LA but /a/ in 
MSA; therefore, you might hear some speakers use /-ih/ or /-ah/ as 
feminine markers. Always keep in mind that the Arabic writing system 
often ignores writing symbols for short vowels. Table 1.6 gives some 
examples of feminine nouns.

At this point, it is useful to know that the masculine plural suffix is 
/-iin/ and the feminine plural suffix is /-aat/. However, Arabic does 
use a great deal of irregular plurals – more so for masculine rather 
than feminine plurals. Notice also that the feminine plural marker 
/-aat/ is sufficient to denote both gender and number, so no need to 
use the feminine marker /-ih/ and the plural suffix /-aat/.

Exercise 8
Salma and Mariam are friends. Salma wants to introduce Mustafa to 
Mariam. Write a dialogue that serves this function.
Cultural point
As mentioned above, Levantine dialect is abundant with greetings. 
There are very general practices that are deemed appropriate on a 
wide range of occasions and there are also a few very fine subtleties 
that you need to be aware of. For example, observing gender-related 
protocol is very important especially if you are visiting a family or if 

Unit 1:  Welcome!	
15
you are in a more traditional rural or Bedouin setting. Some of the 
best ways to advance your understanding of these cultural practices 
is to have a friend or a classmate whom you can ask. If this person 
is familiar with Western culture, that would be an added benefit. 
Another very good thing is to observe closely how people react once 
they meet. Most people will welcome your questions and be more 
than willing to answer. Here are a few other tips:
• In terms of dress, pants and trousers are acceptable types of dress 
for both men and women. Shorts are not favorable. Short sleeves 
are more common for men than for women. On college campuses, 
these differences are not closely observed due to the diversity on 
campus.
• It is OK for people to ask about things usually considered personal 
in Western culture. People are likely to ask about your religion, 
whether you’re married or not, your income, your family members, 
etc. You can give general answers that do not really reveal much. 
If visiting any country in the Levantine area other than Israel, it’s 
usually prudent not to reveal your religion if you are Jewish or 
atheist; people are generally more tolerant of the Christian faith.
• If sitting in a group, make sure the soles of your shoes are not 
facing anyone’s face: it’s deemed impolite.
• No public displays of affection. These are frowned upon.
• It’s OK for people of the same gender to be walking around holding 
hands. It is just a sign of friendship.
• The elderly are always respected. It is polite to give up one’s seat 
for an elderly person, or for a woman if in a crowded bus, class, 
waiting area, etc.
• If going into a place of worship, women and girls must cover 
themselves up. Only their faces and hands should be visible.

Unit 2:  This world

Honorifics
Each culture has its way of expressing respect. One of the major ways 
of showing respect in Levantine culture is the use of honorifics. Honorifics 
are often used whenever the relationship between the interlocutors is 
not really equal. This can be due to various differences: social, economic 
or educational. Also gender and age differences are major reasons for 
using honorifics. Generally, if you are introduced to someone for the 
first time, formality and respect require the use of the proper “title.” 
LA speakers rarely address people using their first names when these 
people are older, or more educated. Almost all married people with 
children expect to be addressed with some title. You can address 
students or other single people of relatively similar age to yours by their 
first names. Another thing to keep in mind that these honorifics are 
followed by the person’s first name, not by their family name. So, if you 
were talking to Dr. Noam Chomsky, you would formally use Dr. Chomsky 
in English but duktoor Noam in Arabic. It is worth mentioning that LA 
uses a lot more honorifics compared to English. Therefore, translations 
will focus on the functional meaning with explanations where necessary. 
Table 2.1 below shows the most common ones.

New expressions
itfaDDal: lit., be kind; be generous. Used as a statement, this is a 
polite invitation for someone to come inside a place or to do some-
thing. For example, if you’re visiting someone, he/she can say tfaDDal 
once you knock on the door or ring the bell. A teacher handing out 
some worksheets can say tfaDDal to each one of her/his students. 
Once food is offered, the host invites guests to start eating by saying 
tfaDDalu.
You borrowed someone’s pen to write something. Having finished, 
you give it back and say:
itfaDDal. shukran.
There you go, thanks.
itfaDDal?: lit., be kind; be generous. With a question intonation, this 
expression changes meaning. It now means “what can I do for you?” 
or “how can I help?” For example, if someone is phoning asking to 
speak to you, you can respond by saying tfaDDal? This will prompt 
the caller to say what he/she wants.
You’re walking down the street and someone stops you to ask you 
something, you say:
itfaDDal, 3indak suʔaal?
What can I do for you, do you have a question?

You are a college student (male) going with your friend Khalid to visit his 
family. Khalid gave you a list of his family members. Read the names 
and the descriptions for each of them and write how you will greet each 
one of them properly. You have never met them before.
1 Abu Khalid is the father.
2 Um Khalid is the mother.
3 Laila is Khalid’s sister. She is a college student.
4 Salim is Khalid’s youngest brother.
5 Um Omar is Khalid’s grandmother. She’s an old lady.
Exercise 2
If you were a female student going to visit the same family with your 
female friend, would any of the greetings above change? Explain.
Nationalities and hometowns (nisba forms)
Nationalities and hometowns are some of the ways people connect. 
It is a very common way of establishing a relationship, bonding 
with people and finding new topics to talk about. LA uses the suffix 
/-i/ with the country/town name to refer to someone who belongs to 
it. For a female, the feminine marker is also needed, and then you 
end up with /-yih/. In Arabic grammar, this is generally referred to as 
nisba form: generally “belonging.” This term captures more than 
nationalities. There are of course a few exceptions to this nisba rule 
but it covers a great deal of nationalities. One of the very common 
exceptions is deleting the marker if the country/town name already 
ends in an /-i/ or /-yih/ in Arabic. If the country/town name ends in 
/-yih/, it is deemed feminine; therefore, you will need to delete the 
feminine marker when referring to a male, so the nisba form becomes 
shorter than the country/town name. Another important point to notice 
here is that some country/town names start with the Arabic definite 
article /-al/ or /-il/. In this case, you will need to delete it. Table 2.2 
presents examples of some nationalities.

Grammar
Subject pronouns
Subject pronouns are simply units that replace nouns. In Arabic, these 
are contrasted with the object and possessive pronouns. A subject 
pronoun can function independently just like the head noun of a 
sentence. Subject pronouns do not have to attach to a word. Table 2.3 
introduces subject pronouns.

4 You are American.
5 He is Lebanese.
Regular plurals
Arabic exhibits simple rules for the formation of regular plurals. Irregular 
plurals, however, remain abundant in the language. Since adjectives 
have to agree with the nouns they modify in terms of number, the 
plural rule becomes very productive. While nouns show clear deviation 
from the rule, adjectives normally follow the plural rule more closely. 
That is, adjectives that take irregular plural markers are less common. 
Arabic also gives different plural suffixes to masculine and feminine 
nouns. Here is the rule: add the suffix /-iin/ to masculine singular 
nouns; for feminine plurals, drop the feminine marker (/-ah/; /-at/) 
from the end of the feminine singular noun, then add the suffix /-aat/. 
Non-human and inanimate nouns obtain their plurals depending on 
the perceived gender, so to speak. However, rarely do non-human 
or inanimate masculine nouns follow the regular plural rule. This is 
most efficiently learnt by practice. Adjectives modifying plural nouns 
take the regular plural maker: i.e., if the noun is masculine plural, 
the adjective is masculine plural, too. Adjectives modifying inanimate 
or non-human plurals take the feminine plural suffix /-aat/. As you 
go through the following examples (see Table 2.4), recall that Arabic 
dialects have considerable variations in terms of short vowels. Since 
Arabic words are based on three consonants (see Introduction), short 
vowels might change.

High frequency connectors (and, or, but)

The meanings and functions served by these connectors are mostly 
similar to those served in MSA or in other languages. Some of them 
can be contracted and some functions can be served by more than 
one particle, as is the case with most connectors. Table 2.5 below 
presents these common particles.

Identifying the letters ()ا، و، ي، ب، ت، ث، ج، ح، خ
As of this unit forward, we will be practicing letters of the Arabic 
alphabet. The goal of these exercises is to familiarize the reader with 
Arabic script, and also to be able to read simple Arabic phrases, road 
signs, items on a menu and other things related to everyday life. 
For the letters of the alphabet, refer to the transliteration key. As 
we go through these letters, I will be presenting some explanations 
necessary to the understanding of the Arabic alphabet.
Arabic writing is recursive. Start always from the right and go to 
left. Once writing the letter is completed, lift the pen to add the dots 
and other short vowels if applicable. Also keep in mind which letters 
are written completely over the line, and which ones are split over 
and under the line.
For this group of letters, the first one is a vowel. Therefore, it comes 
with its own surprises. If the letter stands by itself, with no diacritics, 
it is usually pronounced as long vowel /aa/. Sometimes, this letter 
can be a hamza (,)أ as shown in the transliteration key. In other cases, 
it can receive a diacritic, which could change its meaning. Here are 
the variations:
َ أhamzat fatH: much like a short vowel /a/, e.g., the first sound 
of the pronoun (ana = I).
ُ أhamzat Damm: much like a short vowel /u/, e.g., the first 
sound of (umm = mother of).
 إhamzat kasr: much like a short vowel /i/, e.g., the first sound 
of (intih = you [masc. sing.]).
To help you remember these different types, you might recall that 
the names of the three types here are the first three in Table 3 in the 

Unit 2:  This world	
27
transliteration key. If the small diacritic ()ء is written on top of (,)ا it is 
a short /a/; if a Dammah is added, it becomes a short /u/. If the 
diacritic ()ء is written under the (,)ا it is pronounced as a short /i/.
Sometimes, the diacritic is written directly on the line following a 
word-final (.)ا This is an indication that the vowel must be lengthened. 
Word-final lengthening of ()ا is more common in MSA, rather than LA.
In LA, as in many dialects of Arabic, a hamza is turned into a short 
vowel in many cases.
Finally, short vowels are pronounced the way they are described, 
and shaddah () ـّـ is a lengthening of the consonant that receives it.
Exercise 6

العراق دولة تقع في شمال غرب العالم العربي. يبلغ عدد سكان العراق حوالي 
ستة و ثالثين مليون نسمة. يحدّه من الشمال تركيا، و من الغرب إيران، من 
الجنوب الكويت و السعودية ومن الشرق سوريا و األردن. تعتبر دولة العراق 
واحدة من أقدم الحضارات في العالم. فقد قامت حضارة ما بين بالد الرافدين قبل 
أكثر من ثمانية آالف سنة، و في العراق تم اختراع الكتابة المسمارية و كان 
السومريون من أول الشعوب التي حكمت هذه البالد. و كانت العراق أيضاً مهداً 
للحضارة االكادية، و اآلشورية و البابلية. و بعد ظهور اإلسالم انتقلت عاصمة 
الدولة اإلسالمية اليها في زمن الدولة العباسية. من أهم مدنها بغداد، الموصل، 
كربالء، و البصرة في الجنوب.
Cultural point
The word nisba or nisbah comes from the root n+s+b, which in 
Arabic refers to origin. Most people in the Arab world take pride in 
tracing their origins back to their ancestors. Many families keep track 
of their family trees. This interest in one’s origin can be traced back 
to the pre-Islamic era. The science of origins (3ilm alaʔnsaab) is 
thriving in the Arab world. Some tribes trace their ancestry further 
back than medieval times. Others claim they are direct descendants 
of Prophet Mohammad’s Companions. There are several cultural 
reasons for this interest in people’s origins, such as showing cultural 
heritage and depth, being attributed to historical heroes, belonging 
to a prominent tribe and signaling long residence and ownership of 
a given land.
Other nisba classifications have to do with place of origin as 
opposed to tribal origins. In most LA countries, people who come

from villages are called fallaaH (pl. fallaHiin); if they are from the 
desert, they are called badawi (pl. badu), or if they are from major 
cities, they are called madani (pl. mudun). Some people are attributed 
to their ethnicities: druuze (Druze); ghajar or nawar (gypsy); shiishaan 
(Chechen); sharkas (Circassians); akraad (Kurdish), etc. Others are 
associated with their religious sects: 3alawi (Alawite), maaruuni 
(Maronite), etc.
In Jordan, you can also face one more classification. Some people 
consider themselves Jordanians of Palestinian origin. These are the 
people who originally lived west of the river Jordan before 1948 and 
1967 but were expelled after the establishment of the state of Israel. 
It is likely that people will describe someone as being Jordanian of 
Jordanian origin, or Jordanian of Palestinian origin.

The Arab family
Arabs usually take pride in showing strong commitment to their close 
families. Most Arab families have long traditions of being mutually 
dependent on each other. The old support the young and the young 
respect the old, this is how it traditionally goes. It is not uncommon 
to see extended families living in the same home. Based on economic 
and/or social factors, it is common to find infants, children, teenagers, 
adults and their parents all living in the same house. Many families, 
those who can afford to, build apartments for their married sons to 
keep them and their new families in the same building. Essentially, 
people of the same family live together in the same house. This results 
in a complicated net of relationships. The father is the patriarch,

everybody else lives under his leadership. Reality can be reflected 
in this description but can also deviate a little, and has indeed been 
changing slowly in recent years. Newly formed families are more 
independent and have a lot fewer members. Increasingly, the concept 
of the family home is diminishing due to education, work and economic 
factors. The patriarch can no longer afford to provide food and 
sustenance to all of the extended family members. Younger members 
of the same family are going after job opportunities outside of their 
traditional homes, women are increasingly joining the workforce, the 
age of marriage is nearing the 30s even for women, and family size 
is getting smaller and smaller. Yet, family values are still respected. 
All members of the family still show great respect for the father of 
the house.

maa shaa allaah: lit., whatever God wanted! This expression is loaded. 
It can change meanings based on context and intonation. Here, 
it is an expression of gratitude to God for something good. So, if 
someone is telling you about a beautiful place, or about a success 
story, a brilliant person, etc., you can respond by saying maa shaa 
allaah! It can also be used to express discontent about something 
you really do not like. For example, if someone is doing something 
that is way below expectations, you can say maa shaa allaah! to 
express that you’re not happy with it. The context usually decides 
the meaning.

Numbers 1–10
Learning numbers is very helpful in any language. It is instrumental 
in talking about one’s age, giving directions, negotiating or telling 
the time and, in Arabic, saying most days of the week. Numbers are 
pronounced a little differently in LA and MSA. Table 3.2 shows the 
numbers 1–10. In LA, the question word most commonly used to ask 
about numbers is /kam/, meaning how much or how many.

Countable nouns are by default singular. If you want to specify number 
with a singular noun, you can write the noun followed by the number. 
In this case, both the noun and the number must agree in gender; 
see the examples below. Arabic is provided so that you can observe 
the feminine marker.
Examples: (Audio 1.31–1.32)
1A: ktaab  كتابa book
1B: ktaab waaHid/ktaab waaHad  كتاب واحدone book
2A: sayyaarah  سيّارةa car
2B: sayyaarah waHdih  سيارة واحدةone car
For the number two, most speakers in LA would simply add the suffix 
/-eyn/ to the singular noun to denote the dual. Rarely do people use 
the number “two” the way presented for “one” in 1B and 2B.
Examples:
3A:	 ktaabeyn  كتابينtwo books
3B: ktaabeyn iththneyn  كتابين اثنينtwo books
4A: sayyaarteyn  سيّارتينtwo cars
4B: sayyaarteyn thinteyn  سيّارتين ثنتينtwo cars
When using numbers from 3 to 10, the number is mentioned first, 
then the countable nouns in the plural form. The suffix /-ah/ or /-ih/ 
is deleted.

Unit 3: My family 
As you can see, days of the week are in line with numbers except 
for two of them: Friday is traditionally a holiday in the Arab/Muslim 
world. It is the day when people meet (j, m, 3 has the root meaning 
of to get together). This day's name is derived from the Friday noon 
prayers which are commonly attended by most Muslims. The word 
for Saturday is obviously similar to that used in Hebrew. 
Finally, the definite article attached to these days is dropped mostly 
when one wants to express an event that recurs on a given day, for 
example, kull xamiis: every Thursday.

Cultural point
Understanding relationships within the typical Arab family can be very 
informative. Here are some general practices. Some of these practices 
can slightly differ from one place to another.
• It is not uncommon for adults above the age of 18 to continue to 
live with their families and depend on them. This is especially true 
in the case of students and girls. Generally, girls stay in the same 
home as their parents until they get married.
• Housekeeping and cooking are mostly the work of females: mothers 
and sisters. You can see everyone at lunch or dinner having a great 
time. Then once the eating part is over, the mother and sisters work 
to clean up, do the washing up and prepare some tea for the men 
who sit together enjoying a movie or watching a soccer game.
• In the presence of guests, some families prefer having two living 
areas: one for males and one for females. Other families are fine 
having everyone in the same room.
• Food etiquette is important but it will be discussed in detail in 
subsequent units.
• The heavy presence of communication technology – cell phones and 
handheld devices – is contributing to an ongoing change in family 
relations. It is now more common to see people sitting in the same 
place hooked up to their devices. Arabs are still trying to define 
proper behavior when using these devices in public.

44	
Unit 4:  mish 3aarif
Yes/no questions
Two elements are usually present when asking questions in most 
languages: the question word and intonation. There are different types 
of questions: yes/no questions, information or wh- questions and 
tag questions. In LA, all of these three types utilize one major form 
of intonation; that is, all questions have very similar pitch. Intonation 
generally refers to pitch variation: the fact that different utterances 
have different beats, or different music. Think of how informative/ 
declarative statements versus questions are pronounced. LA mostly 
utilizes pitch variation to form a yes/no question. But a question word 
is used to form the equivalent of a wh- question besides utilizing 
intonation, of course. One other thing is that Arabic does not require 
a change of word order when forming a question. English, for example, 
requires subject/verb inversion. One thing to keep in mind is that 
in all units to come in this book, all yes/no questions will be marked 
in writing using only the addition of the question mark. Keep in mind 
that yes/no questions in Arabic require no changes in writing from 
statements, therefore; the only marker in writing is the question mark. 
See Table 4.1.

Wh- questions
The only addition to these types of questions is the question word.

Negation with maa, mish, muu and laa
These markers are very commonly used in LA to form negations. The 
first one, /maa/ or /ma/, negates verbs and prepositional phrases. 
The second one, /mish/, negates adjectives and demonstratives. 
/mish/ and /muu/ are almost identical, except that /muu/ is more 
representative of Syrian dialect. /laa/ or /la/ simply means “no.” It 
can be used as a short answer to a yes/no question. However, it is 
often followed by another negation statement to emphasize the 
answer. Sometimes, the suffix /-ish/ is added to the end of the verb 
or prepositional phrase negated by /maa/. See Table 4.3.

High frequency prepositions
Prepositions do not have fixed meanings. The best way to learn them 
is to understand their general usages and practice them in different 
contexts. Table 4.3 presents the most commonly used prepositions 
in LA.

Mostly used to express possessiveness;  
sometimes used instead of ila to express 
end point in time or place. Do not  
confuse this with the definite article.

6
fi فيin
Compare to /fii/ which means “there is”  
or “there are.”
In Arabic writing, the prepositions in 1 and 3 connect to the noun 
they precede. Others are written as separate words. Consider the 
following examples:

Nominal and verbal sentences: introduction
Sentences are of two main types: nominal and verbal. A nominal 
sentence is one that starts with a noun or a pronoun. A verbal 
sentence starts with a verb. A nominal sentence can either have a 
verb or only have a subject and predicate. If the sentence has a verb, 
there has to be a subject associated with it. The subject can either 
be pronounced (either a noun or a pronoun) or embedded (i.e., the 
subject is understood). As mentioned previously, word order in LA is 
not so strict, as long as the sentence starts with a definite noun or 
with a verb that has a subject. Usually, sentences start with a subject; 

52	
Unit 4:  mish 3aarif
however, they also can start with a verb. It is important to understand 
sentence build-up in LA. This is an accumulative process but we can 
begin looking at it. Table 4.4 shows examples of simple nominal and 
verbal sentences in LA. Sentence units are labeled.

Notice the following: in the present tense, there is no verb “to be” as 
in English; sentences 2 and 3 start with proper names; sentences 4 
and 5 start with prepositions that have a possessive pronoun; and 
sentences 6–10 all start with verbs that have defined subjects.

Unit 4:  mish 3aarif
 الجنوب الكويت و السعودية ومن الشرق سوريا و األردن. تعتبر دولة العراق
واحدة من أقدم الحضارات في العالم. فقد قامت حضارة ما بين بالد الرافدين قبل 
أكثر من ثمانية آالف سنة، و في العراق تم اختراع الكتابة المسمارية و كان 
السومريون من أول الشعوب التي  حكمت هذه البالد. و كانت العراق أيضاً مهداً 
للحضارة االكادية، و اآلشورية و البابلية. و بعد ظهور اإلسالم انتقلت عاصمة 
الدولة اإلسالمية اليها في زمن الدولة العباسية. من أهم مدنها بغداد، الموصل، 
كربالء، و البصرة في الجنوب.
Cultural point
Asking is not particular to Arab culture. The questions asked can be 
particular. Matters of life that are deemed private in Western culture 
can be less private in Arab culture, which makes them possible targets 
of questions. These include asking about one’s job, family, income, 
marital status, religious affiliation and religious beliefs. Some people 
follow up with further questions and discussion, especially when religious 
beliefs and political views are different from their own. The best way 
to go about this is to give very general and much less provoking 
answers and try to end the discussion politely by changing the subject. 
In most cases, there will be someone who is familiar with different 
cultures. If so, make sure to ask for his/her help or to indicate that 
you would like to avoid such questions and discussions.
Some people go as far as trying to convert you to Islam. In principle, 
this is a very common practice in Christianity and in Islam. Some 
churches and some Muslim scholars embark on major efforts to invite 
people to their religions. Some individuals like to take on this endeavor. 
It is up to you to engage in discussions of this sort or to simply promise 
to read and follow things up on your own. If you end up discussing 
religion in the Arab world, you should keep in mind that most Arabs 
(Muslims and Christians alike) believe in the existence of God, so 
challenging this might bring up some debate. My personal experience 
is that avoiding issues of religious, racial and political divides saves 
a lot of time for learning language. There will be much more chance 
for these types of engagements at more advanced levels of language 
proficiency.

Unit 5:  falaafil wa kabaab
Dining at restaurants
Dining out requires understanding of food culture in the Arab world. 
Major cities are abundant with different kinds of restaurants serving 
different types of food. As is the case in other parts of the world, 
restaurants in the Arab world have a lot in common and also have 
some differences. Fast food restaurants serve local foods, mostly 
sandwiches, pastries and a number of main dishes. These include 
falafel and shawarma sandwiches. Shawarma is slices of beef, lamb 
or chicken wrapped in pita bread with some sauce, spices, pickles, 
tomatoes and lettuce. The individual recipes can, of course, vary a 
little from one place to another. Main dishes usually include rice and 
chicken, beef or lamb in some kind of stew. Grilled meat (mashaawi) 
restaurants are also common. They serve kebabs, chicken, beef or 
lamb skewers and a long list of mezzes.
Western fast food chains – McDonald’s, Pizza Hut, Burger King, 
etc. – are also available in most major cities in the Arab world. Foods 
served here are pretty much similar to their mother branches but you 
will find some changes to conform with local cultures.
Tips are only common in upscale restaurants. Most non-tourist 
restaurants do not expect you to tip their servers but if you do, it is 
usually a very good gesture. Another difference is that leftovers are 
usually not carried out. However, this practice has been changing 
recently. In most restaurants now, people can ask for boxes to take 
away their food leftovers.
Most restaurants, excluding upscale tourist ones, do not serve 
desserts. They just serve main dishes, salads and soft drinks along 
with tea and Turkish coffee. Instead, desserts have their specific 
places where you can find different sorts of Arabic sweets and ice 
creams.

just a way of saying that something will be done quite fast.

New expressions
bituʔmur Habiibi (fem. bituʔmuri Habiibti): lit., you order, darling. 
This is a polite way of expressing consent to do something or to 
provide a service. It is commonly used by waiters, mechanics and 
service providers who expect some kind of tip for their services. It is 
used within the same gender, i.e., it is not common for a male waiter 
to say it to female customers. It does not imply any special relation-
ship. The closest in English is the use of “honey” by some American 
retail store cashiers.
biitza: This is a borrowed word. Keep in mind that native 
speakers of Arabic will mostly switch the English /p/ to a /b/. This 
is due to the fact that Arabic consonant inventory does not have 
this phoneme.
ya sidi (fem. ya sitti): lit., oh, sir; oh, madam. This is a filler show-
ing respect.
3ala Tuul: lit., on or for long. This is used to indicate consent to 
do something or provide some service.

The reader should be able to find out a systematic pattern. Wherever 
the number has 1 or 2 in it, it is better to memorize it. There is 
a pattern of course but it is worth just memorizing these numbers:

Notice the addition of /-ar/ in the teen category of numbers. It comes 
from the suffix for ten, /3ashr/. As you can see, countable nouns are 
in singular form with one, followed by the suffix /-eyn/ for two and 
then come in the plural form from 3 to 10, and in the singular form 
after that.

Dining at a family home
If you get invited to someone’s home for lunch or dinner, and most 
likely you will, you will face a totally different experience compared 
to dining in a restaurant. If you are invited, you are a guest and guests 
in the Arab world enjoy lavish service. It is a unique and culturally 
rich experience that you should not miss. But here are some guidelines.
• If you are invited, decline at first politely, saying that you would love 
to go but you do not want to burden your hosts. This is generally 
how it goes: you are invited, then you decline politely, then the 
host insists and then you accept graciously.
• Once you accept the invitation, and if you know that food will be 
served, tell the host of any dietary restrictions you might have. If 
you are vegetarian, you need to specify that you do not eat meat. 
The host will not feel comfortable if he/she prepares a lot of food 
and you end up not eating.
• On the day of your visit, dress well – comfortably but decently. 
You will be going into someone’s home and therefore you want to 
blend in well. Shorts and tank-tops are not advised.
• It is very polite to buy a very simple gift for the family. If the family 
has a child, for example, bring the equivalent of a $5 toy, etc. If 
you’re going with a group of other visitors, maybe you could all 
contribute to buying a small gift for your hosts. The value of the 
gift is not important. The gesture breaks cultural barriers.
• Once you arrive, proceed as directed. Take off your shoes outside 
the house or outside the guest room, unless instructed otherwise. 
Sit wherever the host asks you to.
• Some hosts will begin by serving you some Arabian coffee. This 
type of coffee is strong but usually has some cardamom added to 
it. You will be offered a small cup with 2–3 sips. You should drink 
the coffee and return the cup to the host. The host will pour more 
coffee for you. If you do not want to be served more coffee, you 
should shake the cup slightly. This is a sign that you do not want 
any more coffee. This tradition is originally Bedouin but it has 
permeated in different LA communities.
• Once food is served, you should ask to wash your hands, if you 
have not washed them earlier. Now there are two sets of etiquettes 
depending on whether food will be shared from one big plate or 
if everyone has their own individual plate.

74	
Unit 6:  fii beytna
Shared plate:
  1 Having washed your hands, wait to be invited to take some 
food.
  2 Once invited, eat using your right hand. In Arab and Muslim 
culture, the left hand is used to clean oneself in the bathroom. 
It can there­fore be offensive to people to use your left hand for 
food from a shared plate. If you have to, or if you’re left-handed, 
then ask for a spoon or a fork.
  3 Some foods are eaten by hand, not using a spoon or a fork. If 
you cannot do this or are not comfortable with it, ask for a fork 
or a spoon.
  4 Always eat from the place on the plate closest to you, right 
in front of you. Do not reach out for food in front of other 
people.
  5 Making loud chewing sounds is frowned upon and dripping food 
should be avoided.
  6 Engage in some light discussions: express how delicious the 
food is, express thanks to your host, talk about your own food 
culture, etc.
  7 If you need anything else: more bread, water, etc., feel free to ask 
for it.
  8 Do not eat too fast or too slowly.
  9 The host will keep asking you to eat more. Once you are full, 
resist politely saying that the food was really delicious but that 
you are full and cannot take any more.
10 The host will direct you to a place where you will wash your hands 
and then come back.
11 In some places, you will come back to the same guest room 
where food was served. If food was served in a dining room, you 
will go back to the guest room. Once everyone is done, they will 
join you.
12 Some people serve food at a dining table. Others serve food 
on the floor. Either way, you are expected to join and mix with 
everyone.
Individual plate:
All of what is mentioned above is expected. There are two major 
differences, however:

Unit 6: At our home 
Since it is your own plate, you have more freedom of eating the way 
you want. You do not really have to worry much about reaching in 
front of someone else. 
2 You are expected not to waste a lot of food. You put on your plate 
as much as you think you will eat. You can go for a second and 
a third helping but you want to make sure that you will finish your 
food. In some local cultures, you are not supposed to finish every-
thing on your plate. You can leave two or three spoonfuls. The 
idea is that the food was so abundant and that your host was so 
generous but you could not finish it all. This is a fine line: you do 
not leave so much food that it gets wasted and you do not clean 
off all of your plate so that your host thinks the food served to you 
was not enough. 
Finally, there will usually be a great deal of tolerance on the part of 
your host. Most people understand that you come from a different 
culture and therefore, they are a lot more tolerant. But generally, food 
culture in LA, and in most places in the Arab world, is rich with dos 
and don'ts.

yislamu: lit., may they (your hands) be well. This is a polite expression 
of gratitude when someone has done something good. So, if some-
one prepared some food for you, a mechanic fixed your car, a waiter 
served you, etc., you could use this expression.
ybaarik fiik: lit., may (God) bless you; used to express good wishes 
for someone.
ghallabtu Haalkum: lit., you have inconvenienced yourselves. This 
expression is used by the one who received some good service. It 
says that you appreciate that some people took the trouble of doing 
something.
ʔabadan: lit., not at all; never. This is a response to the previous 
expression.
maa fiih ghalabih: lit., there’s no problem; no inconvenience. This 
serves the same function as above.
bism illaah: lit., in the name of God. This expression is heavily used 
before starting to do something. Most of the time, it’s used before 
starting to eat or drink – that you do it in the name of God. Food and 
drink are consumed in the hope that they will bring better health. If 
one starts on a project, using this expression is thought to invoke 
God so that it succeeds. Some people use this term extensively: 
before going into someone’s house, when starting their cars, before 
dressing, etc. If in the presence of food, this expression can be used 
by the host as an invitation for people to start eating.

Unit 6:  fii beytna
bi+jannin: lit., it makes one crazy (in a good sense). Used as a 
compliment. You can use this expression to compliment delicious 
food, a nice car, a celebrity, a child, a nice office, a nice view, etc.
haadha il beyt bijannin, ya salaam maa aHlaah!
This home makes (me) crazy. How beautiful it is!
ziid: lit., do more. This is an invitation to eat or drink more. It is 
an imperative verb form but it’s very polite.
kul kamaan: lit., eat more. This is an invitation by hosts for guests 
to eat more food. Eating more food is a sign of appreciation for the 
host. It makes them feel good that their food was enjoyed.
sufrah daaymih: lit., continuing dining (table). This expression is 
used by the guest once he/she is full and can take no more food. It’s 
a good wish that the bounty be always available for the host.

Unit 6:  fii beytna
The iDaafah construct
iDaafah, literally addition, is a prevalent construct in Arabic through 
which one indefinite noun is added to a definite noun, which 
results in a new definite compound noun. Let’s consider the following 
examples:
1 beyt xaalid 
Khalid’s house
2 rijl ilkursi	
the chair leg
3 SaHin HummuS 
hummus dish
4 yoom ilaHad 
Sunday
5 madiinat nyuu yoork 
New York city
Each of the above examples is made of two nouns: the first noun is 
indefinite and the second noun is definite. Adding the first noun to 
the second one makes the new compound noun definite. In addition 
to definition by the definite article (galam; ilgalam – pen; the pen); 
and definition by possessive pronoun (galam; gamali – pen; my pen), 
Arabic utilizes iDaafah to express definiteness. As you can see, some-
times iDaafah expresses possessiveness (as in examples 1 and 2, 
above) and at other times, it uses the second noun to specify or define 
the first one. This structure is very prevalent in both MSA as well as LA. 
The iDaafah construct is not to be confused with the noun-adjective 
structure. In an iDaafah construct, the two nouns are different in terms 
of their definiteness: the first is indefinite, the second is usually definite. 
The iDaafah construct therefore serves the goal of changing from 
indefinite to definite. A noun-adjective structure, however, can be dis-
tinguished by the fact that the two units (the noun and the adjective) 
are identical in their definiteness. If the first noun in an iDaafah 
construct ends in the feminine marker (/-ah/, or /-ih/), it changes 
to (/-at/, /-it/) in pronunciation. If it is a noun-adjective string, the 
pronunciation remains (/-ah/, /-ih/). This is a phonetic, not a spelling 
rule. See the examples below:
1 sayyaarah jadiidih 
a new car
2 sayyaarit xaalid 
Khalid’s car
3 madiinah Sagheirah 
a small town/city
4 madiinat dimashq 
the city of Damascus
5 dawlah kabiirah 
a big country
6 dawlat albaHreyn 
the country of Bahrain

Months of the year
In LA, the year follows the Gregorian calendar. The same applies to 
all Arab countries except Saudi Arabia and some other Gulf countries. 

84	
Unit 6:  fii beytna
In written Arabic, the Arabic names of the months of the year are 
commonly used. In spoken Levantine Arabic, it’s customary to use 
the month number to refer to dates rather than the month name. See 
Dialogue 3. When giving a date, people usually give the day, followed 
by the month and then the year. Table 6.1 below presents months of 
the year.

89
Where to go?
In Arab culture, it is customary for people to go out to socialize together. 
This mostly happens after work, usually in the evening or at night. 
The most popular hangouts are cafés. While these types of activities 
are mostly gender-biased – more men than women go out – there is 
an increasing number of young women going out to cafés and other 
recreational places.

Some people choose to say “foog ilwasaT” or “taHt ilwasaT” 
meaning a little over medium or a little under medium.
shuu 3indkum: what do you have? A question about options for 
food, drink, etc. Sometimes, this can be a question about current 
events, similar to saying “what’s going on?”
zabbiTT+obj.: lit., fix someone or something: this is a request to 
do something well. This expression is mostly used at cafés, restaurants 
or government offices that offer some service. The goal is to encour-
age the service provider to do it well.
allaah yxaliik: lit., may Allah keep you. This is a very common 
expression of good wishes to someone. It is used either to express 
gratitude or to encourage someone to do something (e.g. offer a favor).
3ala raasi: lit., over my head: an expression of respect and promise 
to do the best. When someone asks you for something, you can 
respond by saying “3ala raasi.” This means that you’ll be glad to 
offer your service.
aHsanlik: lit., better for you. It could mean exactly this, and it could 
be sarcastic, depending on context and tone.

Giving directions 
Being able to give directions is a very important skill. While one would 
often use a GPS device in most North American or European countries, 
you will be compelled to ask people for directions in most Arab 
countries. Even if you take a taxi, most drivers will know the major 
roads but they might not know the exact location. In most Arab 
countries, streets have names and numbers and people use these 
names and numbers to give directions. But it is also very likely that 
they will use a major landmark as a point of reference.

Colors
Colors in Arabic are adjectives. Therefore, each color has two different 
forms: one for describing masculine entities, another for describing 
feminine entities. But gender agreement is not uniform because of 
the simple fact that a few colors are very similar to nisba forms. For 
example, the color “brown” is associated with the color of roasted 
coffee /bunn/, so the color is the nisba form of /bunn/; in other words, 
“of the color of roasted coffee.” Another example is “ramaadi” from 
the word /ramaad/, which is Arabic for “ashes.” Therefore, the feminine 
form is going to be similar to nisba feminine forms. See Table 7.2.

How much/how many
Expressions used to ask about quantity do not have much variation 
in LA. Usually, the question word (equivalent to how much/how many) 
is followed by a noun phrase. There is no need to use a verb. Table 7.3 
shows questions using the equivalent of how much/how many along 
with possible answers.

3 thaman aalaaf dular.
4 bass diinaar w nuSS.
5 arba3 danaaniir.
3ind, ma3, fii
3ind is an adverb of place or time; it specifies where or when something 
happens. ma3 can be a preposition that usually means association: 
something that is associated to someone/something else. It can also 
be an adverb or place or time. fii in LA means there is/are, or better 
“there exists” (not the same as fi in MSA, which is a preposition). 
These three particles are used to express possessiveness or the fact 
that something exists somewhere. They can sometimes be inter-
changeable. Consider the following examples:
  1 3indi muHaaDHarah 
I have a lecture
  2 3ndi/ma3i ijaazih ilyoom 
I have leave today
  3 3indi/ma3i Haraarah 
I have a fever
  4 xaalid bishtaghil 3indak?

  7 3indi/ma3i sayyaarah jdiidih 
I have a new car
  8 3indi mushkilih kbiirih 
I have a big problem
  9 ma3i/3inid fluwanza ilyoom 
I have flu today
10 ma3i/3indi waaladeyn w bint

12 fiih 3indak shay? 
Have you (got some) tea?
13 maa fiih daa3i txaaf 
There is no reason  
(for you to) fear
14 maa ma3i wala girsh 
I do not have any penny  
(I have not a penny)
15 maa 3ndi maani3 truuH ma3na 
I have no objection to you 
going with us
16 ma3i/3indi thalath saa3aat bass

Exercise 9
Translate each of the following sentences into Arabic.
1 I don’t have a car.
2 I have a vacation tomorrow.
3 There’s a library in my home.
4 Is there a restaurant in this street?
5 Do you have some tea, please?
The relative pronoun illi
Relative pronouns are used to link sentences where one noun serves 
as the subject of two verbs. Consider the following example from 
English and their translations.
1 I saw the boy who was playing football.
 
shuft ilwalad illi kaan yil3ab faTbool.
2 I have not visited the town which you were talking about.
 
ana maa zurt ilmadiinih illi intah kunt tiHki 3anha.
3 The girl whose phone was lost was so sad.
 
ilbint illi Daa3 talifoonha kaanat Haziinih kthiir.
As you can see, English uses a different relative pronoun depending 
on the noun to which it refers. Levantine Arabic uses /illi/ for all 
relative pronouns – see the translations. The only rule you need to 
observe here is that the noun to which the relative pronoun refers 
must be definite. If it’s indefinite, there is no need to use a relative 
pronoun as the two sentences connect without a pronoun. Consider 
the following examples.
1 shuft binit kaanat til3ab faTbool.
 
I saw a girl playing football.
2 3ndi mushkilih kbiirih ma sharikat ilinternit.
 
I have a big problem with the internet company.

Unit 7:  weyn nruuH?
Exercise 10
Use illi wherever needed. If there is no need, just write 0.
1 ishtareyt sayyaarah jdiidih _________ baruuH fiiha 3aljaam3ah.
2 maktabit iljaam3ah _________ kunt ʔadrus fiiha Hilwah kthiir.
3 ilmadiinih _________ baHibha hiiyih shiikagu.
4 jaam3it haarvard _________ aHsan jaam3ah.
5 ʔakil maama _________ 3imlatuh zaaki (delicious) kthiir.
The past tense
The past tense in Arabic is made from the root verb; refer to the 
Introduction for a brief discussion of root morphology. Verb roots in 
Arabic are the default forms, meaning all other derivations stem from 
them. The root meaning is always associated with two other elements: 
indication of the past along with third person singular (he) as the 
“default” doer of the action in the verb. Table 7.4 gives some examples:
Table 7.4  Root forms

  9

The roots do not have vowels in them. Some roots have either a ‘w’ 
or a ‘y’ but these are not the vowel versions. Notice that the vowel 
pattern in the past is mostly a-a but can be different sometimes.
Now, let’s consider the past tense derivations with the different 
pronouns. I will use the verb /katab/ to present these forms. Table 7.5 
shows the past tense with all pronouns used in LA.

Keep in mind that Arabic does not have a word for “it.” All non-human 
or inanimate subjects are assigned a gender and therefore referred 
to by either “he” or “she.” Plural inanimate nouns are treated in terms 
of gender and number agreement such as feminine singular.

University life
Arab universities are similar in many ways to Western systems of higher 
education. Students finish high school and then submit applications 
for different universities. Nevertheless, the selection criteria vary from 
one country to another and within the same country. In most Arab 
countries, there are different quotas for admission. These quotas 
have developed to benefit the sons and daughters of employees 
who have performed certain services in the public sector. For example, 
in Jordan, the children of army veterans, university employees, judges 
and teachers in public schools make use of quotas in public univer-
sities that give them priority over others in admission under certain 
circumstances. Therefore, the student body in any given university in 
Jordan is diverse, i.e., it tends to have sizeable numbers of students 
from diverse backgrounds. Countries in the Levant, especially Jordan 
and Lebanon, are home to large numbers of students from different 
Arab countries.
In recent years, an increasing level of violence has made its way 
onto university campuses. Reasons continue to be under investigation, 
but often violence is sparked by protests against fees, grading systems 
and general rivalry between students from different social back-
grounds. There can also sometimes be limited demonstrations inside 
university campuses in relation to regional conflicts, especially those 
having to do with the Palestinian–Israeli conflict. In most cases, 
however, these acts of violence are limited in terms of scope and 
results.
That said, one should remember that university campuses are 
generally very safe. Almost all universities are closed campuses: 
one cannot enter a university campus without a university ID card or 
without an escort. Almost all universities have security departments 
manned by police and army veterans.

Transportation
Most students commute to universities using public transportation. 
The cheapest and most popular type are mid-size buses. These buses 
have fixed routes. They pick up students from different villages, towns 
and edges of big cities to university campuses. Some students commute 
for more than 200 km every day. More often than not, these buses are 
crowded and students have to fight to get a seat, especially during 
rush hour.

Unit 8:  Hayaat iljaam3ah
New expressions
shaklna: shakl+na: lit., shape + we: our shape. This is a noun that 
is usually attached to a relative pronoun. It means “it seems that we”, 
“it seems that he”, etc. depending on the pronoun attached. Though 
it is a noun phrase, it gives the meaning of “it seems that.”
maa fiih baaS la iljaam3ah ilyoon. shakil raH atʔaxxar.
There is no bus to university today. It seems I will be late.
niswanji: adj., womanizer. This expression is used to describe some-
one who loves to hang around women, or loves to talk to them as 
opposed to socializing with men.
ishshabaab maa biHibbu ay waaHad niswanji.
The guys do not like anyone who’s a womanizer.
allaah ysaamHak: may Allah forgive you. This expression is used to 
ask for forgiveness for someone. Sometimes, as in this context, it’s 
used as a polite way of defending oneself against an accusation.

Present and future tense
Present and future tenses in LA are identical. Expressing future in LA 
is not performed on the verb. Rather, it is expressed using a future 
adverb of time, or with the help of a future time indication. Sometimes, 
a particle /raH/, meaning “will,” precedes the present verb to indicate 
future. Table 8.3 presents verbs in the present tense with all pronouns 
in LA.

• Cause and effect

Unit 9:  At the market	
119
Arab souk
Shopping in the Arab world is gradually yielding to globalization. In 
many places in major cities, shopping malls are beginning to sprout 
up. The shopping experience in these places is not much different 
from other similar places around the world. There can still be some 
variation in the types of goods offered, or the kinds of food available, 
but a more authentic shopping experience continues to exist in old 
markets still resisting the wave of globalization. These markets are 
usually found in the older quarters of major Arab cities. This is a 
unique experience in most major cities in the Arab world. The best 
place to look for such an experience is the “old madinah” of any 
major Arab town. This is usually the heart of the town, where you are 
likely to find stores that date back hundreds of years.
Visiting these places is part and parcel of trying to understand the 
soul of the Arab city. You are likely to find craftsmen of many types, 
authentic food, different types of desserts, old-time cafés, tailors, 
carpenters, blacksmiths, etc. The learning experiences these places 
offer are truly priceless.
Bargaining
Shopping in big malls strips this skill from people since prices are 
fixed and there is no room for bargaining. Shopping in smaller stores 
is where the true experience lies. If you are shopping for clothes, 
jewelry, souvenirs, collectibles or gifts, it’s likely that these items will 
be overpriced. The reason is that rarely does anyone pay the price 
that the seller asks for at first. Once the seller says the prices, nego-
tiations begin. Sometimes, this will be a fast exchange: the seller asks 
for a given price, the buyer gives a very low counter offer, which 
results in the seller going away and not even discussing the deal. But 
more often than not, the buyer will offer a lower price, the seller asks 
for a higher price explaining how the merchandise is worth it and that 
it is a very good deal. Eventually, both agree and the deal is sealed.
But how do people bargain? In most cases, it is wise to offer 
30 per cent less than the asking price. The seller will then insist on 
5–15 per cent off and might eventually agree to 20 per cent off. A 
good rule of thumb is to ask about the price of what you want to buy 
in different places so as to get an idea about the approximate asking 

120 
Unit 9: fi issuug 
price. The next step is to show that you're not desperate for the 
merchandise and to say that you can get it in other places. If the 
seller sticks to his/her offer, then walk away. This usually forces many 
sellers to agree to sell to a much lower price compared to their first 
offer. But at any rate, make sure you maintain the respect of the seller 
and thank him/her even if you walk away without closing a deal.

heyk kwayyis: lit., this is good. This is used when one likes an 
arrangement or a deal.
3ala Hsaabak: lit., on your account. This is a common expression 
of generosity. In this context, the shop owner politely offers his 
merchandise for free. But this is strictly an expression of respect 
and generosity. It does not mean that he is really willing to do so. 
So, it would be very inappropriate to accept the offer.
bala maSaari: without money. This is similar to the previous 
expression. It’s an offer to take the merchandise for free. Just like 
before, the proper response is to thank the person and insist on 
paying the price. Notice that negotiations are fine but taking something 
for free is not.

Imperatives (Audio 2.29)
Imperatives are verbs that require someone to do something. In LA, 
this verb is formed in the present since the occurrence of the verb, 
should it appear, takes place in the future. Imperatives are always in 
the second person, i.e., using variations of the second person pronoun: 
you. Table 9.1 introduces imperatives.

4 ilizabith raaHat 3ala iddukkaan.
5 toom li3ib riyaaDah.
Negation of verbs
LA uses two particles for negation of verbs depending on the tense 
and the completion of the action denoted by the verb. Here are the 
rules for negation of each of the tenses:
Past: 
maa+verb+(-sh)
Present: maa+verb+-(-sh)
Future: 
maa+raH+verb
 
mish+raH+verb
Tables 9.2–9.4 give negation forms with the root /k+t+b/ and all 
pronouns.

4 3indak sayyaarah fi amriika?
5 mumkin tishtarii li biitza?
6 ishrab kamaan shay.
Cause and effect
In LA, cause and effect expressions are formed through the use of 
/3alashaan/ or the shorter form /3ashaan/ meaning “for” or “because.” 
Sometimes, another connector (/li +ʔann/+ pronoun) is used.
Consider the following examples:
1 3alashaan anjaH laazmi adrus.
 
In order to succeed, I have to study.
2 biddi arooH bsur3ah 3ashaan alHag ilmuHaaDHarah.
 
I want to go fast so that I can catch the lecture.
3 ishtraeyt haay issayyaarah 3ashnha jdiidih.
 
I bought this car because it is new.
4 laʔinha Sghiirih, ba3dha bti3mal mashaakil.
 
Because she is young, she continues to make problems.
5 maa ʔakalna laʔinnuh ilʔakil kaan mish Hilu.
 
We did not eat because the food was not sweet.
In some Syrian dialects kirmaal كِرمال is used instead. /3alashaan/ 
or its shorter form are more commonly used than /kirmaal/.

Unit 9:  fi issuug
Cultural point
Shopping for clothes can be a very interesting experience. Depending 
on where you choose to shop, you might end up paying more or less 
money for almost the same type of merchandise. It is always wise 
to buy with a group of people rather than going on your own. The 
idea is that the retailer is tempted to give you a good deal if there is 
a chance that more items will be purchased or some of your company 
might also decide to buy. Brand names are a big selling point but 
more often than not, do not trust the brands as many are actually 
fake. Once you start negotiating prices, you will notice that world 
famous brands are sold for cheap prices. This is because they are 
imitations of the original brands. However, some major retailers do 
sell the original brands. In these places, there is usually no room for 
bargaining since each price is marked and the retailer has no freedom 
to change it.
Bargaining prices requires some training. In some places, especially 
where traditional, heritage and ethnic merchandise is sold, prices can 
vary considerably. The first thing to do is to shop around first and get 
an idea of the price range. This is usually a very good strategy that 
enables you to get a very good idea of the actual value. But also 
different countries have different practices. For example, many Syrian 
retailers usually ask for more than double the actual price and then 
go down as you negotiate. So if you offer them half the price they ask 
for, this can be a very good point to begin the negotiations. On the 
other hand, the great majority of Jordanian retailers do not go below 
20 or 30 per cent of the asking price and if you try to cut them 
down for half the asking price, many of them will simply walk away. 
Finally, bargaining and price negotiations are common in small family 
businesses or small retailers, which are very common in the Middle 
East. Major retailers and big stores have no room for negotiations. 
However, they do announce several price reductions and you can find 
very good deals in them.

Going around the city
As mentioned in earlier units, cities have a lot to offer. In most Arab 
countries, services in the major cities are much more abundant com-
pared to services in smaller towns and villages. Among the best ways 
to explore the city safely is to know major landmarks. While people 
know the names of major streets, side streets in smaller quarters 
of the city are not known to most people, but they can be easily 
identified by knowing the names of major landmarks in those areas. 
Use of GPS is also very limited since most cities in the Arab world 
are not codified for use in these systems. But people are very helpful 
when asked for directions.

Safety and security
As is the case in most places, safety and security in the Arab world is 
relative; some places are much safer than others. And some are safe 
during certain times of the day, but not so much at night, for example. 
Security is also different for men and women and also varies by age. 
Here are some general security tips:
• Avoid unwanted attention.
• Dress appropriately. Appropriate dress in the Arab world is 
trousers and shirts for men, long sleeves and trousers for women 
or long skirts that cover most of the body. Shorts and tank 
tops are not advisable. However, if one is on a university campus, 
dress code can be less rigid. Additionally, people are used to 
shorts and tank tops or bikinis in tourist places and beaches. This 
is generally a learning process. Over time, everyone can work out 
the proper dress.
• Avoid walking alone. Walking in groups is much safer.
• Avoid crowded places. These places often put people at the risk 
of being harassed or robbed.
• Keep your belongings safe and secure. There is no need to 
keep vital documents such as passports with you. You can use 
an ID card.
• Do not carry much cash around. Carry enough to get you by and 
keep your money in the bank or in a safe at the hotel.
• Stay connected. It’s very easy to get a cell phone in all Arab 
countries and the service is very affordable.
• Keep phone numbers of some local friends handy. If you need 
immediate help, you can call them.

136	
Unit 10:  ilmadiinih il3arabiyyih
• Do not engage in heated discussions about religion and politics 
except with close friends and teachers or in an academic setting. 
Despite the fact that many people in the street can invite such 
discussions, it is wise to keep answers to a minimum, or to say 
that you’re not interested in these issues.
• Avoid talking about or revealing your sexual orientation.
• People are generally very tolerant of Christians, but not so much 
of Jewish people or atheists. But in academic circles there is pretty 
much no problem.
• Finally, if you’re in doubt, ask close friends or teachers. These 
people will always be some of your best resources.
Important places and services (Audio 2.32–2.33;

3aSr: evening time. This is the name for the evening prayer. Arabs 
use this word to indicate time. You will see that many people make 
arrangements to meet using prayer times. The prayer times are: fajr: 
dawn; DHuhr: noontime; 3aSr: evening time; maghrib: sunset; 3isha: 
dinner time. Many people give appointments using gabl (before) or 
ba3d (after) followed by a prayer time.

Nominal sentences
Nominal sentences are sentences in which the noun or the pronoun 
precedes the verb. There are so many sentences that begin with 
a prepositional phrase or an adverb, but that is an added element. 
A nominal sentence must have a noun or a pronoun that acts as 
the subject mostly followed by a verb. The only case in which there 
is no overt verb in a nominal sentence is the equational sentence. 
Let’s examine the following sentences.
1 ana kwayyis.
I am good.
2 3ammaan madiinih kbiirih.
Amman is a big town.
3 ma3i sayyaarah jdiidih.
I have a new car.
4 xaalid raaH 3ala issuug.
Khalid went to the market.
5 ilʔawlaad naamu.
The boys slept.
6 imbaariH idduktoor 3imil 
Haadith.
Yesterday, the doctor had 
an accident.
7 daayman uxti btwwSal mitʔaxxrih.
My sister always comes late.
8 thalaath sayyaaraat Sadmat 
biba3D.
Three cars crashed into 
each other.
In 1, 2 and 3, there are no overt verbs. So these are examples of 
equational sentences. Notice that in 3, the sentence begins with 
a prepositional phrase. In 4 and 5, the sentences begin with nouns. 
In 6 and 7, the sentences begin with adverbs, followed by nouns and 

140	
Unit 10:  ilmadiinih il3arabiyyih
then verbs. The following rule applies for all nominal sentences: in 
nominal sentences, the verb must agree in number and gender with 
the subject. What does this mean? If the subject is singular, the verb 
must be singular. If the subject is plural, the verb is plural. And in 
terms of gender, if the subject is feminine, the verb must be feminine. 
And if it is masculine, the verb is also masculine. Finally, notice the 
number agreement in sentence 8: the noun is plural non-human and 
the verb is feminine singular. This is the rule in Arabic for non-human 
subjects: their agreement pattern is equal to feminine singular.
Exercise 5
Change the following sentences from verbal to nominal sentences.
1 raaHat muna 3ala markiz ilʔamal.
2 bti3rif muna ishshaari3 kwayyis.
3 ʔa3Taani idduktoor dawa mumtaaz.
4 baarak allaah fiik.
5 ʔaxadna arba3 muHaaDaraat ilyoom.
Verbal sentences
Unlike nominal sentences, verbal sentences are not abundant in LA. 
However, verbal sentences are very abundant in MSA. Therefore, they 
can be equally plentiful in academic language, which bridges so many 
gaps between MSA and the dialects. Verbal sentences are easier in terms 
of agreement in that they tolerate violations of number agreement when 
the subject is plural. In other words, if the verb precedes the subject and 
the subject is plural, the verb can either be plural or singular. Gender 
agreement, though, continues to hold. The following examples replicate 
the sentences above but the subject-verb order is reversed. Of course 
equational sentences are excluded due to the lack of an overt subject.
1 raaH xaalid 3ala issuug.
Khalid went to the market.
2 naam/naamu ilʔawlaad.
The boys slept.
3 imbaariH 3imil idduktoor Haadith.

4 daayman btwwSal uxti mitʔaxxrih.

Health
Health services are generally available in the Arab world, but they 
vary from one country to another and from one place to another 
within the same country. In Jordan, for example, health services 
are offered by government, military and private providers. Public 
hospitals and clinics offer health services for all citizens and visitors. 
They usually require a proof of identity. Military health services 
are offered to active duty personnel, army veterans and their families. 
These two types of service are very affordable but usually very 
crowded. Private health providers are more convenient but signifi-
cantly more expensive. Table 11.1 presents words commonly used 
to talk about health. Keep in mind that words that do not have an 
adjective of the same root as the noun can be used with /ma3uh  .  .  .  / 
or /3induh  .  .  .  /

Expressions using names of parts of the body
Arab culture utilizes plenty of expressions and idioms using names 
of parts of the body. You have already learned some of them in 
previous units. Other common expressions are introduced below. 
Some of these expressions use verbs in the imperative. Some of them 
keep their meaning with different pronouns while others are fossilized, 
i.e., they lose their idiomatic meaning once the pronoun is changed. 
This is the case with so many idiomatic expressions: they do not 
tolerate changes of their elements. Understanding and using idiomatic 
expressions is crucial to advancing performance in the language and 
culture. Literal meaning is provided in brackets.
3ala raasi: (on my head) sure, it’s my pleasure. Used in response 
to a thank-you statement for some service or some favor you are 
offered.
mish biʔiidi, (mis biidi): (not in my hand) out of my reach, I cannot 
do it. Used when you want to express inability to offer some service 
or do a favor because it is beyond your means. The message here 
is that you’re willing to help but you can’t. Sometimes, people say 
“ilmawduu3 Tili3 min ʔiidi,” which means “the favor requested left 
my hand.” This has the same meaning.
muS3ab za3laan 3asham maa saa3adtuh. bass ilmawDuu3 
mish biiddi.
Musab is angry because I did not help him. But the issue is out 
of my hands.
ʔadhaanuh Twaal: (his ears are long). Used to say that someone is 
stupid, not smart. In LA culture, this hints at a similarity to donkeys, 

Unit 11:  What’s wrong with you?	
147
whose ears are long. Unfairly, donkeys are symbols of stupidity. The 
expression is informal and entails much sarcasm.
laa tguul ʔadhaanuh Twaal. haadha kalaam mish kwayyis.
Do not say his ears are long. This talk is not good.
sakkir thummak: (shut your mouth). Used to ask someone to shut 
up. It’s a rather impolite expression.
laa tiHki heyk. bass, laa tiHki heyk, xalaS, sakkir thummak!
Don’t speak like this. Do not speak like this. That’s it, shut your 
mouth!
bimshi 3ala ruus aSaab3uh: (he’s walking on the tips of his toes), 
expression of pride or great happiness. One who walks on the tips 
of his toes is either very proud or is in a great state of happiness. 
Sometimes, people use it to mean that someone is arrogant.
ukhti ishtarat xaatim dhahab ghaali ktiir. hallaʔ btimshi 3ala 
ruus aSaabi3ha.
My sister bought an expensive gold ring. Now she’s walking on 
the tips of her toes.
3ala munxaari/3ala xashmi: (on my nose), just like 3ala raasi, 
above. The only difference is that this is much less likely to be used 
by women.
bi3yuuni: (in/with my eyes), just like 3ala raasi, above. The differ-
ence here is that this entails much care about doing something.
tikram liHyitak: (your beard or chin is honored; honoring your 
beard). Used to express happiness at doing someone a favor, in 
response to a thank-you statement. A similar phrase that is commonly 
used among women is tikram 3yuunik.
ragabati saddaadih: (my neck is covering up). Used to say that 
I’m ready to cover you up, I have your back covered, or I will deal 
with all problems.
Sidruh waasi3: (his chest is wide). Used to express that someone 
is patient, tolerant and forgiving. The opposite is Sidruh DHayyig.
ma3 innak Hakeyt 3annuh kalaam mish kwayyis, Sidruh 
waasi3 w maa biz3al 3aleyk.
Though you spoke bad words about him, he’s forgiving and he 
won’t be angry at you.

haadha ilustaadh lsaanuh Tawiil, maa biHtarim iTTullaab.
This teacher’s tongue is long. He does not respect students.
baTnuh kbiir: (his belly is big). Used to express that someone is 
gluttonous, greedy, piggish. It could mean that someone loves food 
a lot, but the term is derogatory.
SaaHib iddukkaan baTnuh kbiir, biHibb ilmaSaari kthiir.
The shop’s owner is greedy. He loves money so much.
sinnuh Tayyib: (his tooth is OK). Used to say that someone has 
a very good appetite. Mostly this is kind expression.
SaaHbi aHmad sinnuh Tayyib, biHibb ilmasahaawi akthar min 
ummuh.
My friend’s appetite is big. He loves grilled food more than his mother.
jilid txiin or samiik: (his skin is thick). Used to express that someone

not pleasant to be around, description of bad company. The opposite 
is dammuh xafiif.

Precautions
Apart from precautions related to personal security, health risks might 
also be a source of discomfort. Despite some general stereotypes, 
the major sources of health problems usually have to do with personal 
choices in terms of food and drink. While most foods are clean, 
getting sick or catching some kind of food parasite remains almost 
inevitable. Visitors to the Middle East often report catching parasites 
after consuming fruits, vegetables or undercooked foods. Water is 
also a possible source. Symptoms are usually limited to stomach 
ache, headache, dizziness, vomiting and diarrhea. Patients usually 
recover quickly.
Trips and excursions are also occasions for getting sick. Some 
people like to sample different, sometimes exotic types of food 
during their trips, which can cause health problems. Heat is another 
reason especially during the summer or in the desert where the 
temperature is hot during the day and cold and breezy at night. Here 
are some tips:
• Drink bottled water. Most Arabs avoid drinking tap water, despite 
its relative safety. The reason is that water resources are scarce, 
especially in the Levant and therefore several elements are used 
in water treatment.
• Avoid eating raw foods, especially raw meat. Most Arabs cook 
their food well, though.
• Limit eating fresh fruits and vegetables to one item at a time. 
This is a good way of eliminating foods that can cause health 
problems.
• If you buy your own food, stick to clean providers.
• Avoid buying foods from street vendors. Most of the time, cleanli-
ness is at low levels here.
• Drink a lot of water, especially on hot days. Dehydration is likely 
due to hot and dry weather.
• If you are on any kind of medication, bring it with you.
• Long sleeves are advisable. They help you avoid sunburn.

Quantifiers: kull, ba3D, shwayyih, nidfih, wala  
كل، بعض، شوية، ندفة، وال
kull: all, every
ba3D, or ba3DH: some of
shwayyih: little of, few of
nidfih: few of
wala: none of
These particles precede nouns. When using these quantifiers, LA 
makes no distinction between countable or uncountable nouns. 
The meanings of these quantifiers are close to their translations. 
shwayyih indicates a little more than nidfih does. Whether the noun 
after these particles is definite or indefinite depends on contextual 
factors. Let’s consider the following examples; an asterisk indicates 
wrong usage.
  1 kull innaas

Comparative and superlative forms
LA uses one simple form to express comparative and superlative 
adjectives. For the former, the comparison is held between two iden-
tical entities, where one has more of the “adjective” than the other. 
For superlative adjectives, LA uses a comparative form followed 
by a noun that refers to the whole category. Table 11.3 presents 
comparative and superlative adjectives.
Table 11.3  Comparative and superlative forms

that refers to the whole category. Consider the following examples:

Weather
The Middle East enjoys different climates. Even within a small country 
the size of Jordan, temperatures can range from a high of 85°F to 
105°F (30°C to 40°C). During summer, for example, northern parts 
of Jordan are mild to hot during the day but mostly breezy and 
moderate at night, whereas it can be really hot in the Jordan Valley, 
Aqaba, the Dead Sea and the desert areas. In winter, the northern 
part of the country gets much more rainfall and snow compared to the 
desert areas. Table 12.1 presents new vocabulary that is associated

Seasons of the year
As you will see, in the Arab world there are several holidays, foods 
or festivities that are associated with different seasons. The types of 
food available, especially in the Levant, are not the same during all 
seasons. Social demographics sometimes change in different seasons. 
As strange as this sounds, it is normal when you think of the hundreds 
of thousands of Arabs who live outside of their countries and decide 
to spend their vacations at home. Some towns in Jordan increase 
their population by nearly a quarter during summer time. Table 12.2

Exercise 4
Pick up five new words that you learned about weather in this unit. Use 
each one of them in a short sentence.
Broken plurals
We have learned the regular plural suffixes for masculine and feminine 
nouns. But you might also have noticed that irregular plurals, especially 
for masculine nouns, are plentiful. Broken plurals fall into categories 
and have rules that we can learn. These categories are based on the 
consonant-vowel structures of the singular nouns. Therefore, present-
ing these rules at this stage requires a deeper discussion of word 
structure and syllabification, a topic usually discussed in linguistics 
research.1 One rule that should by now be clear is that the plural form 
for most feminine singular nouns ending in /at/ or /it/ is /-aat/. This 
also applies to the majority of non-human singular nouns. Among the 
best ways to learn forms of broken plurals is to try to find out the 
plural for every noun you learn.
1  If you are interested, check out Robert Ratcliffe’s The Broken Plural in Arabic 
and Comparative Semitic, John Benjamins, 1998.
Exercise 5
Provide the meanings of each of the following nouns, then write the 
plural forms.
  1 aaniseh

  3 madiinih
  4 Saff
  5 maktab

Unit 12:  The weather	
163
  6 diinaar
  7 dagiigah
  8 shaggah
  9 kaasih
10 3inwaan
Use five of them in sentences.
gabil w ba3d + ma
/gabil/ and /ba3d/ are adverbs of time and place. Consider the 
following examples:
1 ilbeyt illi gabil beytna. 
The house before our house.
2 waggif sayyaartak ba3d 
Stop your car after the sign.
 
ilishaarah.
3 laa tishrab gahwah gabl innoom. Don’t drink coffee before 
sleeping.
4 bukrah ba3d issaa3ah sab3ah. 
Tomorrow after 7:00.
5 raH ashtaghil ba3d ittaxxaruj. 
I will work after graduation.
6 ana bashrab shay gabil innoom. I drink tea before sleeping.
Notice that these two words are followed by noun phrases, not by 
sentences. Notice also that sentences 5 and 6 do not have a clear 
adverb of time or place. However, the sentence structure suggests that 
one action is related in time to another: in 5, the sentence says the 
speaker will work after he/she graduates. And in 6, the speaker says 
he/she drinks tea before going to bed. Both actions in each sentence 
are clearly sequenced. But the use of /ma/ or /maa/ with these 
expressions requires using a sentence. Consider the following examples:
1 ba3d maa tirja3 min iljaam3ah, ruuH 3ala issuug.
 
After you come back from the university, go to the souk.
2 gabil maa tnaam, laazim tiHki ma3 ummak.
 
Before you go to bed, you must call your mother.
3 laa tiHki ma3uh gabil maa yi3tadhir.
 
Don’t talk to him before he apologizes.
4 maa raH ashuufha ba3d ma tsaafir.
 
I won’t see her after he leaves (travels).

of young Arab men are becoming active fans of certain international 
soccer teams. Cafés tend to fill up with fans when there are scheduled 
matches. Fans are also divided when it comes to local soccer teams. 
Most people tend to support their local teams – those that represent 
their hometown. Supporting a certain team can sometimes hide 
some type of political message. Generally, in Jordan fans are divided 
between two teams where one team represents Jordanians, and the 
other represents Jordanians of Palestinian origin. While this classifica-
tion is not 100 per cent accurate, any follower of the demographics 
of soccer teams’ fans can find a pattern along these lines. Sometimes, 
people watching a game between these two teams use racial and 
ethnic slurs to express their hatred of the other team. Table 13.1 
presents some vocabulary used in sports.

Cultural point
Haki shabaab
One might wonder what issues young people in the Arab world talk 
about. And the fact of the matter is that there is virtually no way one 
can a find a suitable answer to this question. Issues that attract 
people’s attention in the Arab world are not much different from 
other places around the world. There is, however, a greater interest 
in politics, religion and issues of conflict in comparison to, say, an 
average American or European. This is a trend motivated by the 
general belief that the political situation in the region, over which 
people of the region have very little control, affects people’s livelihood. 
Young people, university students in particular, are usually worried 
about their lives beyond graduation. But issues related to the opposite 
sex are also very prevalent due, in part, to the greater distance 
between the two sexes compared to non-Muslim countries.
Women are also becoming increasingly worried about their oppor­
tunities in the workforce. As economies of the Levant plunge, women 
are increasingly looking for jobs in areas they have not traditionally 
tried before.
Dialogue 3 (Audio 2.53–2.54)

New expressions
3al hawa: on air, live. Using this expression is only restricted to TV 
or radio shows
(allaah) yi3Tiik il3aafyih: may (Allah) give you wellness. This expres-
sion is sometimes used as a greeting. It can also be used to express 
thanks to someone for doing something.
allaah y3aafiik: may Allah keep/protect you. This is the answer to 
the previous greeting.
maakil hawa: lit., I’m eating air/wind. This is a slang expression 
meaning one is in a desperate situation, or one is too tired.
bala faaydih: without benefit. This expression means “in vain.”
Exercise 4
Read Dialogue 2 again. Summarize the caller’s complaint in writing.
kaan
This verb is the Arabic version of the verb “to be” in English. Before 
presenting the different usages of this verb in LA, it’s important 
to remember the difference between two grammatical forms: (-ing 
forms such as playing, eating, etc.) and (-ed forms such as played, 
eaten). LA expresses these two functions using a /kaan/ verb along 
with the main verb in two derivations: subject noun and object 
noun. The subject noun is used to express the doer of the verb. The 
object noun is used to express who was affected by the action 
of the verb, i.e. the receiver of the action in the verb. Without the 
presence of a full verb along with /kaan/, there will be an equational 
sentence in a form other than the present tense. Consider the following 
examples:
1 kunt ta3baan.
 
I was tired.
2 kaanat Hilwah lamma kaanat Sghiirih.
 
She was pretty when she was young.
3 kunna msaafriin.
 
We were traveling.

174	
Unit 13:  kurat ilqadam
4 kaanu shabaab muHtaramiin.
 
They were respected young men.
5 kaan ma3i ktaab.
 
I had (with me) a book.
6 kaan 3indha mushkilih.
 
She had (with her) a problem.
7 kunt bal3ab kurat qadam zamaan.
 
I was playing soccer (in the past).
 
I used to play soccer (in the past).
8 salma kaanat tidrus biljaam3ah.
 
Salma was studying at the university.
 
Salma used to study at the university.
Notice the following: in 1–3, the structure in Arabic is the verb, 
which has a subject pronoun (I, she, we, respectively) followed by the 
remainder of the sentence. This is an equational sentence. In 4, the 
subject is a pronounced noun, not a pronoun. In 5 and 6, there is 
a prepositional phrase after /kaan/. In 7 and 8, there is a full verb 
following the verb /kaan/. This is how Arabic expresses an action 
that took place over time in the past but is now completed.
Exercise 5
Translate each of the following sentences using /kaan/.
1 My brother used to play football when he was young.
2 The food at the restaurant was the best I ever had in my life.
3 We were watching a football match when the teacher entered 
class.
4 I had a very nice car when I was in Japan.
5 My friends were not going to travel to Europe.
biddi, laazim
We have seen these two words several times in the previous units. 
Both are used to express the need to have something or to do some-
thing. Consider the following examples; sentences marked with an 
asterisk are grammatically incorrect.

Unit 13:  Football (soccer)	
175
1 I need a new car
 
biddi sayyaarah jdiidih.
 
laazimni sayyaarah jdiidih.
 
*laazim sayyaarah jdiidih.
2 I want to travel to China
 
biddi asaafir 3ala iSSiin.
 
laazim asaafir 3ala iSSiin.
 
*laazimni asaafir 3ala iSSiin.
The main difference between /biddi/ and /laazim/ is the fact that 
the former already entails a subject (I, in this case) but the second 
one does not. Therefore, in the absence of a clear subject, /laazim/ 
cannot be used. And when the sentence has a subject, adding a 
subject pronoun to /laazim/ causes redundancy.
Exercise 6
The following sentences have some errors. Find the errors and correct 
the sentences.
1 ana baddhum yil3ab kurat qadam issaa3ah arba3ah masaa.
2 laazimhum adrus kull yoom thaman saa3aat Hatta anjaH.
3 xaalid bidha yishtari HummuS w falaafil.
4 ana w samiira laazimhin nruuH 3ala ilmaT3am.
5 uxti bidhum kamaan arba3 shaalaat.
Conditional statement: laʔin, 
3alashaan  .  .  .  laazim, bass
Conditional statements behave very much like cause and effect state-
ments. The same particles can be used in either type of the sentences. 
Study the following sentences:
1 laʔinnuh ana maa 3indi waasTah, maa illi shughul.
 
Because I do not have a middleman, I do not have a job.
2 3alashaan tinjaH, laazim tidrus.
 
So that you can pass, you have to study.
3 bass tiSall ilbeyt, ittaSil ma3i.
 
When you arrive home, call me.

176	
Unit 13:  kurat ilqadam
You can switch the order of the two phrases within each of the 
sentences above without causing any difference in meaning. No 
subject-verb inversion is required. The only difference is that the new 
structure does not require the use of a comma in writing.
1 maa illi shughul laʔinnuh ana maa 3indi waasTah.
2 laazim tidrus 3alashaan tinjaH.
3 ittaSil ma3i bass tiSal ilbeyt.
