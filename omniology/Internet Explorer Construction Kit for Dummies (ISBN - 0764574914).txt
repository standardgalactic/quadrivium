Introduction
I
think it’s safe to say that practically every personal computer on the
planet has some sort of Internet browser installed on it. The Internet
has become — in a very real sense — an extension of our own machines,
often so perfectly integrated with our computer’s operating system that
we sometimes can’t tell the difference.
With Internet browsers taking such a huge place in the computing world, it
seemed to me that it’d be cool to have a little fun with them, to come up with
a way to put together a browser in the same way that you might glue together
a model. The idea was to provide a set of components and settings and then
let the user decide what he wanted to use.
And so was born the Browser Construction Kit, the software that accompanies
this book.
About This Book
Using the Browser Construction Kit, you can create dozens (hundreds?) of
different browser configurations, from browsers that look much like any
other Windows application to some way out designs, with custom graphics,
buttons, menus, and so on.
Some of this book is the software manual for the Browser Construction Kit,
whereas other parts of the book provide hands-on projects for building many
types of Web browsers. Such browser designs include a safe browser for chil-
dren, a specialized browser for small businesses, and even an April Fool’s
browser that’s sure to drive your April 1 victims batty.
Conventions Used in This Book
Whenever you see ➪, it means you choose multiple commands from the 
command menu. For example, if you see File➪Save, you first choose the
File command and then, from the drop-down list that appears, you choose
the Save command.

What You’re Not to Read
Some elements of this book provide information that you need not bother with.
What’s the point of having this stuff clogging up the works? Well, you just might
want to read this extra information, especially if you’re interested in learning
something over and above the basic instructions for using the software.
Foolish Assumptions
The Browser Construction Kit requires no programming, so don’t get the idea
that you need to be a computer scientist to get the thing to work. Designing
a new Web browser is easy! It would be nice if you know something about
the Internet — from a user’s point of view — and have some experience with
Microsoft Internet Explorer. But, regardless of your experience level, within a
short while, you’ll be cranking out browser designs like a pro. What do you
need to get going? The following list is a good start:
 A Windows computer
 An Internet connection
 A user’s knowledge of Web browsers
 The desire to create interesting browser designs of your own
Although you have no need of programming skills to use the Browser
Construction Kit, the complete Visual Basic .NET source code is included
on this book’s CD. If you know how to program with VB .NET, you can look
over the source code to see how the program works. You can even load it
into your copy of VB .NET and make whatever modifications you like.
How This Book Is Organized
This book has six parts, but you don’t have to read the parts in any special
order. If, for example, you want to build a browser or two right away, feel free to
jump ahead to Part V, where you’ll find step-by-step instructions for building
eight unique browser designs. If you want to know more about the Browser
Construction Kit’s many commands, Part II gives you what you need. Get the
idea? To help you on your way, here’s a brief roadmap of the book.
Part I: Making Your Own Internet Explorer
If you want to get a quick introduction to the Browser Construction Kit and
the things you can do with it, Part I is the place to start. Along the way, you
2
Internet Explorer Construction Kit For Dummies 

also discover good reasons for creating browsers (as if you need any), as
well as discover what parts of a browser are easily customizable.
Part II: Customizing the Look of the Browser
This part goes through the Browser Construction Kit in detail, showing you
how to use its many controls and commands, as well as how all the parts fit
together to create a unique browser design.
Part III: Creating Browser Graphics
Many components of your custom browser can display images that you create
yourself with a paint program. These images include backgrounds for the
window, border images, button images, and much more. In this part of the
book, you discover how to make the images you need for your browser —
and all without having to go to art school for four years!
Part IV: Controlling the Behavior 
of the Browser
This is the second part of the book that deals in detail with the workings of the
Browser Construction Kit. Here, you find out about alarms, locks, passwords,
timers, automatic screen captures, log files, and more.
Part V: Designing Customized 
Web Browser Projects
The Browser Construction Kit is all about creating browsers, of course, and
this part is where you put together browser designs that I’ve created for you,
to demonstrate the many ways you can use the Browser Construction Kit. In
this part, step-by-step procedures lead you through the construction of eight
different browsers.
Part VI: The Part of Tens
For people who want to really expand their custom-browser-creation horizons,
this part of the book offers ten themed browser projects, as well as ten tools
and resources for learning more about programming Internet Explorer — if
you choose to take it that far.

Introduction

Icons Used in This Book
Throughout this book, little pictures, known as icons, appear in the margin.
These icons give you a quick visual aid to the following categories:
Whenever you see this icon, you’ll find information on how to do something
more efficiently.
This icon marks information that you need to know in order to get the most
out of the software.
This icon provides technical background information that you may or may
not find interesting. You don’t need to read the material if you don’t want to.
Be careful! When you see this icon, pay special attention because it notes
places where you could run into trouble.
This book is accompanied by a CD, and whenever you see this icon, you’re
getting a heads up that you should have your CD ready to use.
Where to Go from Here
You can use this book in a couple of ways. Like any book, you can start at the
beginning and read your way to the end. That’s probably the best way to learn
about the Browser Construction Kit software and the things you can do with
the custom browsers you build. You can, however, skip around in the book, if
you like, just reading the sections that provide the information you need at any
given moment. Because of this nonlinear approach, after you know how to use
the software, this book makes a great reference.
The Browser Construction Kit represents a whole lot of hours of programming,
so I expect you to get the most out of it. But more than anything, I expect you
to have fun!

W
hy on earth would you want to build your own ver-
sion of Internet Explorer? I can think of a number
of reasons, and in this part of the book, I share those rea-
sons with you. You also find out a little about the parts of
a browser you can customize. In addition, you get your
first look at the Browser Construction Kit, exploring the
features you can use, the custom graphics you can incor-
porate, and the agreement you must make with Microsoft
(not as scary as it sounds).

Customization

 Simplifying a browser application
 Targeting a special purpose or user
 Installing the Browser Construction Kit
You’ve probably used your favorite Web browser for a long time. Your
browser is a trusted friend that accompanies you on your many treks
through the complex world of the World Wide Web. You can’t help but feel
warm and fuzzy when you load your browser. (Geez, maybe we all should
get out more.) After all, it provides the gateway to many cool adventures,
from looking up the latest gossip on your favorite celebrity to more mundane
tasks like research. Why on earth change something that works so well?
I can come up with plenty of reasons! Of course, not all of these reasons apply
to you. Reasons for creating a custom Web browser are as varied as the people
using them. You may just want to make the browser easier to use, or you may
need a browser customized for a special purpose. Whatever your reasons, this
book and its accompanying software are just the ticket. This chapter explains
why you may want to build a customized Web browser.
Application Simplification
I bet that you have no clue what most of your Web browser’s buttons and
commands do. If you’re like most people, you use a few buttons and commands
all the time, and the rest sit there, waiting for you to figure them out — a task
you and I both know you never get to. So why bother with that extra clutter
on the screen, when you’re not using it anyway?

Application simplification is the process of stripping out parts of a program
that you don’t need and may never use. Getting rid of that overhead makes
your browser easier to use for a number of reasons:
 Fewer commands makes a browser less intimidating.
 Fewer commands also means that you work faster because you don’t
have dozens of commands to search through.
 Fewer controls leaves more screen room for the main display area.
 Fewer controls and commands may help the browser load faster.
Application simplification is automatic with the Browser Construction Kit.
You start with only an empty window, as shown in Figure 1-1, and then add
only the program elements you want. In this way, nothing extra clutters the
browser’s window or menus.
You may think that the browser customization process is difficult, but the
first time you create your own browser, you’ll be amazed at how easy the
Browser Construction Kit is to use.
Special-Purpose Browsers
Most Web browsers target the general user. Because so many different types
of people use browsers, the browser makers try to please everyone. This
attempt yields browsers overloaded with features, most of which the average
user never needs. Moreover, such browsers lack special features that a few
Figure 1-1:

down

the Browser
Construction
Kit’s editor.

Part I: Making Your Own Internet Explorer 

people may want. A special-purpose browser — the kind you can create with
the Browser Construction Kit — boasts features not found in a conventional
browser. A special-purpose browser, for example, can include features that
prevent children from accessing unsuitable Web sites.
For more information on special browser features, refer to Part IV. In that part,
you can read about timers, site-approval lists, locks, and other cool features.
Want an example? What if you want a kids’ browser that disables surfing to
unsavory Web sites? Or how about a browser that accesses a set of favorite
sites with a button click (see Figure 1-2)? Maybe you have a small store, and
you want a browser that accesses your catalog, but cannot go elsewhere on
the Web. (Hey, you don’t want your customers checking out the competition’s
Web site, do you?) Reasons for creating special-purpose Web browsers are
more numerous than dust bunnies under my bed — and that’s a lot of reasons!
Specific-Audience Browsers
A fine line divides special-purpose browsers from those targeting a specific
audience. For example, a browser designed for children has both a special
purpose and a specific audience, right? Yep. In fact, special-purpose and 
specific-audience browsers often have much in common. The difference is
that, when I talk about special-purpose browsers, I’m referring to browser
functionality. On the other hand, when I talk about specific-audience browsers,
I’m referring to the way a browser looks. Specifically, I mean the types of
graphics you use for buttons and other areas of the browser’s window.
Figure 1-2:

Chapter 1: Exploring the Benefits of Browser Customization

That special-audience browser for your hardware store looks better if it’s
designed with images related to hardware. As another example, suppose
that you’re crazy about gardening. (Hey, weirder things have happened.)
Wouldn’t it be cool to have a Web browser covered with garden-type images
(see Figure 1-3)? I’d rather have bikini models, of course, but that’s just me.
The Joy of Do-It-Yourself
Don’t forget the most important thing about customizing a Web browser: It’s
fun! You like to build things, right? Who doesn’t? (Okay, my crazy Uncle Satch
would rather paint crickets, but that’s another story.) Unlike that jigsaw puzzle
of a black cat that’s been sitting in your family room for the past three weeks, a
custom Web browser is actually useful. That puzzle . . . well, you’re just going
to break it up and throw it back into the box.
To make a Web browser project even more stimulating and exciting, load
up your favorite paint program (or use the one on this book’s CD) and create
custom images for your browser projects. Such images include borders, back-
grounds, status bars, and even buttons, as shown in Figure 1-4. If your browser
project was any more fun, it would be illegal!
Figure 1-3:

Part I: Making Your Own Internet Explorer 

Don’t go hog wild creating browser graphics just yet. You need to understand
the types of images the Browser Construction Kit expects. Each type of image,
for example, must be the correct size. Failure to follow the rules can lead to
some very weird looking browsers! Check out Part III for more information.
Browser Construction Kit Installation
Before you can design your own Web browsers, you need to install the
Browser Construction Kit, located on this book’s CD-ROM. The Browser
Construction Kit is a software package comprising a browser editor and a
browser compiler. You design your browser using the WYSIWYG (what you
see is what you get) editor and then run the browser with the browser com-
piler. You don’t need to be a programmer to use the Browser Construction
Kit, but if you’re interested in that kind of thing, I wrote the software using
Visual Basic .NET. All the software’s source code is also on the CD.

Chapter 1: Exploring the Benefits of Browser Customization

Here’s how to install the Browser Construction Kit:
1. On this book’s CD-ROM, find the Browser Construction Kit folder and
open it.
2. Double-click the setup.exe file.
The installer’s Setup Wizard window appears, as shown in Figure 1-5.
3. Click the Next button to continue with the installation.
The Select Installation Folder window appears (see Figure 1-6).
4. Select the folder into which you want the Browser Construction Kit
installed.
Normally, you just leave the default folder selected.
5. Select either the Everyone or Just Me button, depending on whether
you want to install the program for every user on your system or just
for you.
6. Click Next.
The Confirm Installation window appears, as shown in Figure 1-7.
7. Click Next to start the installation.
The installer’s window shows the installation’s progress as it goes, as

Browser Construction Kit Removal
I just know that you’ll love the Browser Construction Kit so much that you’ll
never want to remove it from your system. But, just in case, the application
features a handy removal method that you can access from your Control Panel.
Here’s how:
1. Go to your Start menu and choose Control Panel from the pop-up
menu that appears, as shown in Figure 1-10.
2. In the Control Panel, click Add Or Remove Programs, as shown in
Figure 1-11.
3. In the Currently Installed Programs list, click the Browser
Construction Kit.
The Change and Remove buttons appear.
4. Click the Remove button (see Figure 1-12) and answer Yes when asked
whether you’re sure that you want to remove the program.
Windows removes the Browser Construction Kit from your system.

Chapter 1: Exploring the Benefits of Browser Customization

After Windows has removed the application from your computer, the program
files, as well as the program’s entries on your Start menu and your desktop
will be gone. However, any files you created with the Browser Construction
Kit — that is, files that didn’t exist at the time of the installation — will still
be on your computer. You can remove such files manually.

Figuring Out What’s Customizable
In This Chapter
 Understanding the Windows user interface
 Exploring window styles
 Customizing toolbars, status bars, and menu bars
T
he full Internet Explorer and the browser you create with the Browser
Construction Kit are very different beasts. Although these beasts share
the same heart (lub-dub, lub-dub), their external features can be very differ-
ent indeed. This is because, like everything else in the universe, building your
own Web browser is a give-and-take situation. Specifically, your custom
browser cannot have all the features of the full Internet Explorer. But what do
you give up, and what do you gain? I’m glad you asked, because the answer is
what this chapter is about.
The Kit Versus the Full Internet Explorer
Writing an application the size and complexity of Internet Explorer requires
dozens of programmers and years of development time — not to mention 
the gallons of caffeine-laden pop and the bushels of nacho chips consumed.
Internet Explorer is up to Version 6, and Microsoft’s programmers are still
working on improving it. If you think that one guy (me) sitting behind a laptop
computer can compete with that kind of programming muscle . . . well, I’ve got
some swampland in Florida you may be interested in.
Luckily, Microsoft makes the heart of Internet Explorer available to program-
mers so that they can quickly add Internet features to their own applications.
The Internet Explorer component comes in the form of a control that the pro-
grammer adds to his program. Once the control is in place, the application
sends commands to the control to make it do cool stuff, like browse to a Web
site, move back through the sites in the history list, or entertain young chil-
dren with reruns of Sesame Street. Okay, I’m lying about that last one.

Anyway, the point is that, when I put together the Browser Construction Kit, I
didn’t have to worry about the gory details of rendering HTML files into Web
pages or even how to browse from one Web site to another. The Internet
Explorer control takes care of everything. I did, however, have to create a user
interface for the control that enables the user (that’s you) to send commands
to the Internet Explorer control. The cool part is that you decide which user
interface elements you want to use.
HTML is the language used to create Web pages. If you’ve ever seen HTML,
you have to admit that it’s downright amazing that all that nonsense could
ever create something as attractive as a Web page. For example, look at
Figure 2-1. There you see a Web browser displaying the home page of my Web
site. Figure 2-2, on the other hand, shows what the Web page’s HTML looks
like. Yikes!
The browser that the Browser Construction Kit creates lacks some features 
of the full Internet Explorer. (You never use those features, anyway.) That guy
(me again) sitting behind the laptop computer can only do so much. That guy
(yep, me again) did, however, include a lot of extra features that the regular
Internet Explorer doesn’t have. The point isn’t to reproduce Internet Explorer,
but instead to create something new and different. So, although you give up a
few features, you get cool new ones like alarms, timers, kid-safety functions,
and so on.
Figure 2-1:
A browser
showing a
Web site.
18
Part I: Making Your Own Internet Explorer 

To get an overview of the Browser Construction Kit’s many features, refer to
Chapter 3.
When you’re browsing the Internet, you may be overcome by the urge to look
at some HTML (yeah, right). Here’s how: Go to Internet Explorer’s View menu
and choose the Source command. Presto! Notepad runs and loads up the
page’s HTML. If you’re ever interested in learning HTML, take a peek at this
source code to see what other HTML folks are doing on their Web pages.
Window Elements
Almost every Windows application — Internet Explorer included — shares 
a set of features. This sharing isn’t one program stealing good ideas from
another. Nope, the features I’m talking about are written up by Microsoft in a
document for programmers. This document details the way Windows applica-
tions’ user interfaces should be programmed.
For example, most Windows applications sport a File menu, right? If you use
Windows applications at all, you know that the File menu holds commands
like New, Open, Save, Save As, Print, and Exit. Thanks to this menu consis-
tency, you don’t learn a new set of basic commands for every new Windows
application.
Figure 2-2:

Web site in
Figure 2-1.
19
Chapter 2: Figuring Out What’s Customizable

Consistency, however, doesn’t mean that the standard window elements aren’t
customizable. Applications can, and do, decide what standard Windows fea-
tures they want to offer, as well as how they want those features to look 
and act.
A good example is a toolbar. This handy element of a Windows application
often displays buttons that represent commonly used menu commands. The
application’s user can issue a command with a single mouse click, rather
than digging through the menus. Typically, toolbar commands include load-
ing and saving files, editing the current document, choosing style commands,
and so on.
The Browser Construction Kit follows (mostly, anyway) the Windows guide-
lines for application user interfaces. As the browser customizer, however, you
get to decide what features to include and what they look like. The features
I’m talking about include the following:
 Title bar
 Icon
 Style
 Background color
 Buttons
 Client area
The title bar and icon
In a Windows application, the title bar is the horizontal area at the top of the
window. The title bar usually displays, among other things, the following
items:
 Application icon
 Application name
 Window control buttons
Figure 2-3 points out these features of a window. With the Browser Con-
struction Kit, you can customize these window features as you like. You can
choose an icon to display in the title bar. You can also name the application,
as well as specify the control buttons (minimize and maximize) that appear in
the title bar.
20
Part I: Making Your Own Internet Explorer 

The window style and color
Not every window looks alike. You may have noticed, for example, that an
application’s main window looks very different from a dialog box (which is
also a type of window). You may even have seen windows that are nothing
more than rectangles on the screen (Figure 2-4). In fact, in its simplest form,
that’s exactly what a window is: a rectangle in which an application draws its
display.
A window’s style determines how the window looks and acts. Microsoft built
these window styles into Windows, but the Browser Construction Kit lets you
choose the style for your browser. Here are the styles supported by the my kit:
 Normal: A standard window.
 Normal Unsizable: A standard window that cannot be resized.
 Toolbox: A window with a small title bar and only a close button (no
minimize or maximize buttons).
 Toolbox Unsizable: Same as a toolbox window, except the user cannot
resize the window.
 No Controls: A simple rectangular window with no controls.
To find out more about these window styles, refer to Chapter 4.

21
Chapter 2: Figuring Out What’s Customizable

Besides choosing a window style, you can also set the window’s background
color, which is the color that fills the main part of the window, usually called
the client area. The client area is where an application displays its data. In the
case of a Web browser, the client area displays the current Web page.
The buttons and client area
Most windows have three buttons, one for closing the window and two for
controlling the size of the window. These buttons live in the upper-right
corner of the window. Not every window has the same buttons, however. In
fact, some windows have no buttons at all. Here’s what the three buttons do:
 Minimize button: When clicked, this button reduces the window to an
icon on the taskbar.
 Maximize/Restore button: The first time you click this button, it
increases the window to the full size of the screen. The button then
changes to a Restore button, which, when clicked, returns the window
to its original size.
 Close button: This button — the one with the X — closes the window.
Clicking this button is the same as choosing the File menu’s Exit 
command.
The Browser Construction Kit enables you to decide which of these buttons
to include in your browser’s window. These choices, though, depend on the
window style you choose. A toolbox-style window, for example, can never
have Minimize and Maximize buttons.
Figure 2-4:
A simple
rectangular
window.
22
Part I: Making Your Own Internet Explorer 

The Browser Construction Kit enables you to include one, both, or neither of
the Minimize and Maximize buttons. In this way, you can control the way the
user manipulates your custom browser window.
The Browser Construction Kit places the browser pane in the window’s client
area. The client area provides space for two extra items as well: graphical
borders and backgrounds. You can use your favorite paint program to create
these borders and backgrounds and then add them to your custom browser.
The thematic possibilities are endless. Please refer to Part III for more infor-
mation on creating browser graphics.
The Browser Pane
The browser pane is the graphical representation of the Internet Explorer con-
trol. This component of the browser does most of the work of browsing the
Internet. Normally, this pane consumes the entire client area of the window,
but the Browser Construction Kit lets you place the browser pane anywhere
you want in the client area. You can also set it to any size you want. Figure 2-5
shows the browser editor with a small browser pane in the right side of the
window’s client area.
Figure 2-5:

23
Chapter 2: Figuring Out What’s Customizable

When you’re online with your custom browser, the browser pane displays the
current Web page. This fact means that, although you can choose any size
and position you want for the browser pane, practical considerations restrict
your choices.
Toolbars, Status Bars, and Menus
Most full-featured Windows applications have a toolbar, a status bar, and a
menu bar. Your custom browser is no different. Well, maybe it is, depending
upon how you design it. Although you can add a toolbar, status bar, and
menu bar to your browser, you don’t have to. Congress hasn’t passed that
law yet, although I understand that they’re close to requiring all Web
browsers to feature a large presidential-campaign donation button.
The toolbar
If you add a toolbar to your browser, you can also add one or more standard
browser buttons. You use these buttons all the time. Really, you do. Here’s a
list of those buttons:
 Home: Returns the browser to the home page.
 Back: Returns the browser to the previously viewed page.
 Forward: Returns the browser to the page viewed before clicking the
Back button.
 Stop: Stops loading the current page.
 Refresh: Reloads the previous page.
 Search: Sends the browser to a Web search engine.
 Favorites: Displays links to favorite Web sites.
With the Browser Construction Kit, you can assign your own images to the
toolbar buttons. Just load up your paint program, create images of the cor-
rect size, and use the browser editor to add the images to the buttons. You
can also create an image to use for the toolbar background. Could this be
more fun? I mean, you can have a toolbar that looks like a sheet of metal or
one the color of spicy mustard, although I don’t recommend the latter.
The status bar
If you add a status bar to your browser, you can specify an image for its back-
ground. Moreover, you can choose from among four special displays, three of
24
Part I: Making Your Own Internet Explorer 

which aren’t available in the regular Internet Explorer. These displays are as
follows:
 Icon: A small image that appears at the far left of the status bar.
 Clock: Displays the current time.
 Timer: Displays the amount of time online or a countdown timer.
 Date: Displays the current date.
The menu bar
Almost every Windows application has a menu bar, which is where the appli-
cation’s commands hang out. Your custom browser can have a menu bar, too.
Or not. The choice is yours. If you choose to have a menu bar, you then decide
which menus to include, although the content of the menus depends on the
features you include in your browser. In any case, the Browser Construction
Kit supplies the appropriate command entries for the menus you choose to
include. These menus are supported by the Browser Construction Kit:
 File
 Edit
 View
 Favorites
 Tools
 Help
Notes for Visual Basic Programmers
If you’re not a programmer, skip this section. If you are a programmer, you
may be interested to know that the Browser Construction Kit is programmed
using Visual Basic .NET. You may be even more interested to know that the
complete source code is on this book’s CD-ROM. This fact means, of course,
that not only can you explore the program to see how it works, but you can
also add your own features.
Although you’re free to modify the Browser Construction Kit for your own
use, you cannot distribute the program, which is copyrighted by Wiley, the
publisher of this book. The Browser Construction Kit is licensed only to the
owner of this book.

Meeting the Browser 
Construction Kit
In This Chapter
 Understanding Internet Explorer licensing
 Looking over the browser editor
 Exploring browser features
 Discovering custom browser functions
I
n Chapters 1 and 2, you find out why you’d want to design a custom Web
browser, as well as discover the types of browser elements you can fiddle
with. In this chapter, you examine the Browser Construction Kit and get a
handle on the power it gives you to design the perfect Internet browser —
perfect, that is, with respect to the use you have in mind. You don’t actually
design a Web browser in this chapter (dang it!), but you can see the many
commands that you can use with the Browser Construction Kit.
Microsoft Licensing
Although Microsoft gives away Internet Explorer with every copy of Windows,
and even though programmers can take advantage of Internet Explorer’s power
in their own applications, Microsoft still retains full rights to the software.
As an Internet user, you don’t need to know anything special about Microsoft’s
licensing requirements, but if you plan to create Web browsers for distribution,
you need to have a license from Microsoft. Don’t start moaning about paying
Mr. Gates even more cash. Believe it or not, the license you need is, just like the
browser itself, free. Microsoft just wants to know who’s using its software. The
company also wants assurances that you will use its software according to the
agreement that accompanies your license.

How do you get your license? No, you don’t have to travel to Redmond,
Washington, and meet with Bill. All you need to do is load up your Web
browser and go to Microsoft online at www.microsoft.com/windows/ieak/
license/existing/default.asp. When the Web page appears, click the
Licensing And Registration link in the text and complete the form that
appears.
Of course, if you’re just designing browsers for your own use or to share with
family members, you don’t need a license. All you need is the Web Browser
Construction Kit and the information in this book.
Don’t distribute a custom Web browser based on Internet Explorer (which is
the type of browser the Browser Construction Kit creates) without getting
the proper license from Microsoft. Doing so is a violation of Microsoft’s copy-
rights. Because the Browser Construction Kit is included on this book’s
CD-ROM, this publisher had to acquire the license, too.
The Browser Editor
You can use the Browser Construction Kit to design a custom browser in 
two ways:
 By using the Kit’s included editor (the easy way)
 By writing browser script files by hand (the hard way)
Most of the time, you’re going to want to use the editor because it’s a whole
lot easier than memorizing the commands that can be in a browser’s script
file. If you like monkeying around with technical things, though, you can dig
into the script that the editor creates for you or even build your own from
scratch. For most of this book, I assume that you’re always going to use the
editor. (I talk about scripts in Chapter 20.)
Starting the editor
To start the editor, just double-click the Browser Construction Kit icon on
your desktop. (If you haven’t installed the Browser Construction Kit, see
Chapter 1.) You can also find the icon on your Start menu (where it requires
only a single click). In Windows XP, for example, just open the Start menu and
go to All Programs/Browser Construction Kit (or whatever folder you chose
when you installed the software from the CD).
When you start the Browser Construction Kit, the editor appears (see 
Figure 3-1).
28
Part I: Making Your Own Internet Explorer 

Introducing the toolbox
Down the left side of the editor’s window is the toolbox, which contains the
components of a Web browser and commands that you need to assemble
your custom browser. The editor arranges these components and commands
into the following seven categories:
 Address bar: Commands and components that build your browser’s
address bar.
 Browser: Commands and components of a Web browser that affect the
pane in which you browse the Internet.
 Functions: Custom functions — such as the timer, alarm, and site-
approval list — that you can add to your browser.
 Menu bar: Commands and components that determine the types of
menus you want in your menu bar.
 Status bar: Commands and components that build your browser’s 
status bar.

Chapter 3: Meeting the Browser Construction Kit

 Toolbar: Commands and components that build your browser’s toolbar.
 Window: Commands and components that affect the browser’s main
window.
Only one set of commands and components can appear in the toolbox at one
time. You choose the set you want from the drop-down list at the bottom of
the toolbox. For example, in Figure 3-1, the toolbox contains the commands
for the main window, whereas in Figure 3-2, the toolbox is set to show com-
mands for the custom browser functions. Notice how, in each case, the drop-
down list below the toolbox shows the current command category.

As you build your custom Web browser, the changes you make appear in 
the browser display pane, which is the large area to the right of the toolbox.
Before you start building your browser, this pane displays a basic window. 
As you add and customize browser components, they appear in the window.
This way, you can see, even as you work, exactly what your custom browser
looks like. Figure 3-3, for example, shows the editor after the user has made
the following customizations:
 Changed the browser window’s style to an unsizable toolbox
 Changed the browser title to My Browser
 Added a menu bar
 Added border graphics
 Added and positioned a browser pane
Exploring the custom function pane
The final part of the editor is the custom function pane, which is where the
browser functions you add from the Functions category appear. These spe-
cial functions include the following:
 A log file
 An alarm
 A locking mechanism
 A site-approval list
 A screen-capture “spy”
 Popular sites buttons

Chapter 3: Meeting the Browser Construction Kit

When you add one of these special functions to your browser, the function’s
icon appears in the custom function pane. Figure 3-4 shows the editor after
the user has added all the custom functions.
The custom functions whose icons appear in the custom function pane don’t,
for the most part, affect the way your browser window looks. For example,
when you add a menu bar to your browser, you can see it at the top of the
window. However, the alarm function doesn’t add anything to the browser
window, so it appears in the custom function pane instead, just so you know
you’ve selected it.
Including Standard Browser Features
Your custom browser shares a set of features with the standard Internet
Explorer. These features (assuming that you decide to add them to your
browser) include a menu bar, a toolbar, a status bar, and an address bar.
Menu bar
Your custom browser’s menu bar can contain many of the same commands
found in the full-featured Internet Explorer, as well as access to commands
that control custom features, such as locks, alarms, and log files. As you build
your browser, you decide whether you want a menu bar and what menus will
be on it. Here are your menu choices:
 File: Holds commands such as Open, Close, and Save.
 Edit: Contains commands such as Cut, Copy, and Paste.
 View: Includes commands to hide or view various browser components,
such as the toolbar and status bar.
 Favorites: Holds commands to access favorite Web sites.

tions you’ve

Part I: Making Your Own Internet Explorer 

 Tools: Lists commands to access custom tools and functions that you
may have added to your browser.
 Help: Contains commands to access the Windows Help system, as well
as to view the browser’s About dialog box.
Toolbar
The toolbar holds the buttons you need to navigate the Web. Anyone familiar
with Web browsers has already used these buttons a zillion times. If the fol-
lowing buttons don’t ring a bell, you may be reading the wrong book! Here’s a
list of buttons you can add to your toolbar:
 Home: Displays the browser’s current home page.
 Back: Moves back one page in the browser history.
 Forward: Moves forward one page in the browser history.
 Stop: Stops the current page from continuing to load.
 Refresh: Redisplays the current page from scratch.
 Search: Directs the browser to a Web search engine.
 Favorites: Displays a list of favorite Web sites.
Status bar
Most Windows applications these days feature status bars in a horizontal area,
usually at the bottom of the window, where the application displays status
information and other messages the user may need to see. Although the status
bar is a standard feature of a Web browser, including Internet Explorer, your
custom browser can display information that you don’t see in the full Internet
Explorer. This information includes the following:
 Icon: Your own custom-designed icon.
 Clock: A digital clock showing the current time.
 Timer: A display showing the amount of time online or a countdown
timer.
 Date: The current date.
Address bar
The address bar is just a small box where you can type URLs (Web addresses)
that you want the browser to visit. Almost every Web browser has an address
33
Chapter 3: Meeting the Browser Construction Kit

bar. You, however, can choose not to have one, if it suits your needs. You
may, for example, want to build a Web browser that never leaves a specific
Web site. In that case, you wouldn’t need an address bar.
Although components like menu bars and toolbars are standard features of
the full Internet Explorer, your custom components may use these standard
features in different ways. For example, you can specify how your custom
toolbar looks, which is something that you can’t do with Internet Explorer.
Understanding Custom Browser Features
In this section, I cover the cool stuff that Internet Explorer doesn’t have.
These neat features coincide with the custom functions you can add to your
browser, as well as a couple of the extra components that you can add to
your browser window.
Passwords and the locking mechanism
A password authentication system protects many custom functions. If, for
example, you’ve created a browser for your kids to use, you don’t want them
to accidentally (or deliberately — they are kids, you know) change any of the
settings you’ve carefully set up. To change such function settings, the user
must enter a password.
Timers
The timer function simply tracks how long an online session has been active.
You can use the timer to keep an eye on how long you’ve been working on a
specific online project, for example. You can also use the timer — as a count-
down timer — to lock out the browser after a specific amount of time. If you
want your kids (or your parents!) to be online only one hour a day, the timer,
once you’ve set it up, can handle this need automatically, shutting off the
browser after a given amount of time has elapsed.
Clock
If you don’t know what a clock does, you’re way over your head with this
book! Just kidding. I know you know what a clock does, and the one you can
add to your browser’s status bar isn’t much different. All it does is display
the current time in digital format.
34
Part I: Making Your Own Internet Explorer 

Alarms
Your custom Web browser can use alarms in various ways. The timer uses
alarms that tell the user when his Web browsing time is up. This alarm can 
be just a pop-up window or an actual audible signal. This alarm is the signal
for the browser’s user to beg the browser’s administrator (that’s you) for
more time.
Site-approval list
The Web overflows with great places to explore. Unfortunately, it also over-
flows with nasty places. To complicate matters further, what’s nasty to one
person may be perfectly okay to another. Freedom of speech dictates that
these nasty places can exist, but it doesn’t force you to allow your custom
Web browser to display such places. That’s where the site-approval list
comes in.
The site-approval list is nothing more than a list of URLs to which your Web
browser is allowed to connect. The list ensures that the user can never go
somewhere on the Web that doesn’t meet with your approval. Lots of pro-
grams have tried various ways of filtering Web content to keep unwanted
sites from being viewed, but the only way to be 99 percent sure is to use a
site-approval list. (That missing 1 percent covers me, just in case. . . .)
Web browsing log
The Web browsing log keeps a list of all the URLs visited by the browser. You
may want to use the Web browsing log with older kids who need greater Web
browsing freedom than a site-approval list allows, but who must also agree to
the types of sites they’ll visit. The browsing log gives you a quick and easy
way to check that those who use your custom Web browser follow your rules.
Screen-capture “spy”
Still another safety feature is the screen-capture function, which takes pictures
of the screen at the intervals that you specify. This feature comes in handy
when used in conjunction with the Web browsing log. Web site URLs don’t
always have descriptive names. That dirty-joke place called Too Naughty For
Kids may have the URL www.tnfk.com. That URL doesn’t tell you anything
about where your Web browser’s users have gone (unless, of course, you go
to the Web site yourself and check it out). The screen-capture function lets
you see what the Web site looks like, without having to go there yourself.
35
Chapter 3: Meeting the Browser Construction Kit

The screen-capture function takes a lot of screen shots over the course of a
Web browsing session. For that reason, try to review the images at least once
a day. Otherwise, you’ll be overwhelmed by the number of screen shots you
need to examine.
Custom Web browser graphics
In this chapter’s “Including Standard Browser Features” section, I explain the
Web browser’s toolbar, which contains the standard buttons browsers use to
navigate the Web. I also explain the status bar and address bar. Your custom
browser can go one step beyond the standard Internet Explorer by enabling
you to add your own graphics to the toolbar, status bar, and address bar.
These graphics include not only the bars themselves, but also the images
used with each of the toolbar buttons. Cool!
To create graphics, though, you need to know how to use a paint program.
This book helps you there, too. In Part III, you discover how to use your free-
trial version of the famous Paint Shop Pro, included on this book’s CD. You
learn to use this powerful software to create graphics for use with your
custom browser. Such graphics include not only the aforementioned toolbar
and status bar stuff, but also skins (background images) and borders.

and background graphics, and more. In Part II, you find out
how to add these components to your browser projects, as
well as how to customize them to your taste and needs. At
first, creating a new custom browser may seem like a lot of
work, but by the time you explore the information in this
part, you’ll be banging out new browsers like a pro.

E
very custom browser starts with a window. Although Windows dictates to
some extent what a window looks like, an application’s programmer can
choose to include or exclude certain features. The programmer can also decide
what many of the features look like. In the case of the Browser Construction
Kit, you get to be the programmer (sort of) and decide the type of window you
want to use with your browser. In this chapter, you examine the many ways
you can make your browser’s window special.
The Window Command Category
The Window toolbox contains every command I discuss in this chapter. You
display the Window toolbox by choosing the Window command category from
the toolbox’s drop-down list. To get started, run the Browser Construction Kit.
When the editor’s main window appears, choose the Window category in the
lower-left corner of the window, as shown in Figure 4-1.
When you have the Window category selected, the Window commands appear
on the buttons in the toolbox, also shown in Figure 4-1. To select a command,
click the appropriate button. The following list describes the commands found
in the Window command category:
 Color: Specifies the color of the window’s client area.
The client area is the rectangle where the window displays data. As
such, the client area is the largest part of the window.

 Icon: Specifies the icon that appears in the window’s upper-left corner.
 Style: Specifies the type of window to use, such as a normal window or a
toolbar window.
 Buttons: Specifies the buttons for the title bar.
 Border: Specifies a border image to appear at the top and bottom of the
window’s client area.
 Skin: Specifies an image to use as a background in the window’s client
area.
 Title: Specifies the title that appears in the window’s title bar.
What you do after clicking the button you want depends on the command
you choose. The rest of this chapter shows you how to apply these com-
mands to the design of your custom browser’s window.
The Window Color
You can set the background color of the window’s client area to any color
you want. To do so, click the Color button in the Window toolbox. When you
do, the Color dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 4-2.
Figure 4-1:

40
Part II: Customizing the Look of the Browser 

In the Color dialog box, click the color you want and then click OK. The
window’s background color immediately changes in the editor’s display.
If the colors in the Color dialog box don’t suit you, you can define your own.
Simply click the Define Custom Colors button to expand the Color dialog box,
shown in Figure 4-3. Pick the hue you want from the large color box and then
select the shade from the narrow box to the right. When you have your color,
click the Add To Custom Colors button, and the color appears in the Custom
Colors boxes. Click the color you want and then click OK.

Chapter 4: Designing the Browser Window

The Application Icon
An application’s icon appears on the left end of the title bar. To add an icon 
to your window, click the Icon button in the toolbox. When you do, the Select
Window Icon dialog box appears (see Figure 4-4). This dialog box is a standard
Windows dialog box. Find your icon file as you would in any Windows program
and then click the Open button. The Browser Construction Kit adds the icon to
your window.
To remove an icon from the browser window, click the Icon button again. The
Browser Construction Kit then removes the icon.
Window icons must be a special type of file and must be created by a special
editor. If a graphics file has a file extension of .ico, it’s probably the type of
file you want. No doubt you can find tons of icons on the Internet. You can
probably even do a search of your own hard drive and find plenty of them. If
you want to make your own icons, refer to Chapter 16. This book’s CD features
a number of browser themes, each of which includes a custom icon. Feel free
to use these icons in your own projects as well.
42
Part II: Customizing the Look of the Browser 
Getting an exact color
If you want a very specific color, you can type
color values directly into the Hue, Sat, and Lum
boxes, or into the Red, Green, and Blue boxes.
Hue stands for . . . well, hue; Sat stands for sat-
uration; and Lum stands for luminescence. The
Red, Green, and Blue values, on the other hand,
are the amount of red, green, and blue to mix to
form the final color. These values can range
from 0 to 255, with 0 being darkest and 255 being
brightest. The value 0,0,0 is black, and the value
255,255,255 is white, with all other colors falling
somewhere in between.
For example, the RGB value 255,0,0 is pure red,
whereas 0,255,0 is pure green and 0,0,255 is
pure blue. Reduce the value of a pure color, and
you get a darker shade of the same color. Thus,
128,0,0 is dark red. If all three red, green, and
blue color elements have the same value —
128,128,128 or 64,64,64 are a couple of possibil-
ities — then you get a shade of gray.
As you add more of one color element over
another, the resultant color becomes more like
the color with the higher value. The RGB value
128,128,128 is medium gray, but 256,128,128 adds
a healthy dose of red, and you end up with a
shade of pink.
As you can see, you can mix the colors just as
you would jars of paint, although the results are
nothing like what you get with paint. The color
value 256,256,0 combines red and green (but no
blue), which, due to the peculiarities of RGB
color values, gives you yellow. The color value
255,0,255, on the other hand, gives you a pur-
plish-pink. When all else fails, experiment with
the RGB colors by typing in different values and
seeing what you get.

Not every window style can display an icon. If a window style displays no
icon, adding one with the Icon command has no effect.
The Window Style
A window’s style determines what the title bar and window border look like.
The style can also affect the buttons that appear in the title bar. If, for exam-
ple, you choose to have a Normal window style, the title bar can (if you want)
display all three window-control buttons: Minimize, Maximize, and Close. If,
however, you choose a Toolbox-style window, only the Close button can be
on the title bar.
To select a window style:
1. Click the Style button in the toolbox.
When you do, the Window Styles dialog box appears, as seen in Figure 4-5.
Figure 4-5:
The
Window
Styles
dialog box.
Figure 4-4:
The Select
Window
Icon dialog
box.
43
Chapter 4: Designing the Browser Window

2. Select the style you want and click the OK button.
If you’re unsure which of the five styles you want, check out the following
sections, which describe each style. The window in the display changes
to show the selected style. If you click the Cancel button in the Window
Styles dialog box, the editor applies no changes.
The Normal style
The Normal style contains the type of window you see with most Windows
applications. A Normal window has the following features, shown in Figure 4-6:
 Standard title bar: The title bar is the standard height, unlike some
other styles, such as a toolbox, which has a smaller title bar.
 Icon: This icon appears at the left end of the title bar.
 Window title: This title is the text you select for the window’s name. The
title appears to the right of the icon in the title bar.
 Minimize button: This button is the first one on the right side of the title
bar. It reduces the window to an icon on the taskbar.
 Maximize button: The second button on the right side of the title bar, it
enlarges the window to fill the full screen. When the window is set to full
screen, the Maximize button becomes the Restore button, which returns
the window to its previous size.
 Close button: The third button on the right side of the title bar, this
button closes the application, having the same effect as choosing Exit
from the menu bar.
 Thick border: The border is the edge of the window. A normal window
has a thick border that the user can drag to resize the window.
Although some window styles display the Minimize, Maximize, and Close but-
tons, you’re not stuck with them. You can, for example, have a Normal window
with only a Close button. See this chapter’s “Minimize, Maximize, and Close
Buttons” section for more information.
The Normal Unsizable style
The Normal Unsizable style is similar to the Normal style, except that the user
cannot resize the window. A Normal Unsizable window has all the features of a
Normal window, except it has a slightly thinner border. You use this window
style when you don’t want the user to change the size of your browser’s
window. Figure 4-7 shows a Normal Unsizable window.

Chapter 4: Designing the Browser Window

The Toolbox style
The Toolbox style sports a different look than a normal Windows window (see
Figure 4-8). The smaller title bar and buttons leave more room for the window’s
client area, giving you extra space for your browser pane. The following list
describes the differences between the Normal and Toolbox windows:
 Small title bar: The height of the title bar is less than with a Normal
window.
 No icon: The Toolbox style window displays no icon.
 Minimize button: Doesn’t appear.
 Maximize button: Doesn’t appear.
 Close button: Smaller than in a Normal style window.
 Thin border: A Toolbox window has a thinner border than the one on a
Normal window, but the user can still resize the window.
The Toolbox Unsizable style
The Toolbox Unsizable style window looks a lot like a regular Toolbox window,
except that the border is slightly thinner, and the user can’t resize the window.

46
Part II: Customizing the Look of the Browser 

This style is great for those times when you want the extra room provided by a
Toolbox window, but don’t want the user to change the window’s dimensions.
A Toolbox Unsizable window has the following features, shown in Figure 4-9:
 Small title bar: The height of the title bar is less than with a Normal
window.
 No icon: The Toolbox style window displays no icon.
 Window title: This title is the text you select for the window’s name. The
title appears on the left of the title bar.
 Minimize button: Doesn’t appear.
 Maximize button: Doesn’t appear.
 Close button: Smaller than in a Normal style window.
 Thin border: A Toolbox Unsizable window has a slightly thinner border
than the one on a Toolbox window, and the user can’t resize the window.
The No Controls style
The No Controls style window is nothing more than a blank rectangle. The
window displays no controls of any kind (unless, of course, you add things
like a toolbar or status bar). A No Controls style window doesn’t have any
features, and the user can’t resize the window (see Figure 4-10). I wouldn’t

Figure 4-9:

style.
47
Chapter 4: Designing the Browser Window

recommend using this window style much, because the user has no way to
manipulate the window, except to close it. Still, for special purposes, this
window style can be handy, if for no other reason than it provides the biggest
area for your browser pane.
Minimize, Maximize, and Close Buttons
Although some window styles can display the Minimize, Maximize, and Close
buttons, they don’t have to. Specifically, you can use the toolbox’s Buttons
button to select the buttons that you want in your window’s title bar. To do
so, click the Buttons button. The Window Buttons dialog box appears, as
shown in Figure 4-11.
Figure 4-11:
The
Window
Buttons
dialog box.
Figure 4-10:
The No
Controls

48
Part II: Customizing the Look of the Browser 

As you can see, only the Minimize and Maximize buttons appear in the
Window Buttons dialog box. These buttons are the only ones you can change.
(That means if a window style normally contains the Close button, you have
to live with it.) To add a button to the window, select its checkbox. To remove
it, clear its checkbox. Figure 4-12, for example, shows a window with just the
Maximize and Close buttons. (The Minimize button is grayed out, which
means that it’s disabled.)
You can’t add or remove buttons from a window style that doesn’t include
the buttons in the first place. For example, if you’ve chosen a Toolbox style
window, changes you make with the Buttons button have no effect.
The Window Borders
If you want to spruce up your browser window, borders may be just the
ticket. Borders are narrow images that you can place above and below the
browser pane. You can use borders to give your browser a graphical theme,
as shown in Figure 4-13.
To add a border, click the Border button in the Window toolbox. When you
do, the Select Border Image dialog box appears (see Figure 4-14). This dialog
box works just like any standard Windows dialog box. Simply find your
border file as you would in any Windows program and then click the Open
button. The Browser Construction Kit adds the border to your window.
Figure 4-12:
A window
with only
Maximize
and Close
buttons.
49
Chapter 4: Designing the Browser Window

To remove a border from the browser window, click the Border button again.
The Browser Construction Kit then removes the border.
Border images can be one of several file types: .bmp, .gif, or .jpg. Most paint pro-
grams can generate these types of files. Even though the Browser Construction
Kit automatically resizes an image to fit the border areas of the window, to get
the best results, your border images should have a size of 784 x 54 pixels. Refer
to Chapter 11 for more information.

Part II: Customizing the Look of the Browser 

The Window Skin
Borders are one way to add thematic graphics to your browser window (see
the previous section). Another way is with a window skin. In the case of the
Browser Construction Kit, a skin is a large image that fills the client area of
the window, as shown in Figure 4-15.
To add a skin, click the Skin button in the Window toolbox. When you do, the
Select Skin Image dialog box appears (see Figure 4-16). Choose your skin file
from the list and then click the Open button. The Browser Construction Kit
adds the skin to your window.
To remove a skin from the browser window, click the Skin button again. The
Browser Construction Kit then removes the skin.
Skin images can be one of several file types: .bmp, .gif, or .jpg. Most paint pro-
grams generate these types of files. Even though the Browser Construction
Kit automatically resizes an image to fit the client area of the window, to get
the best results, your skin images should have a size of 784 x 559 pixels. You
can refer to Chapter 12 for more information.

The Window Title
You can name your custom browser anything you like. Here’s how:
1. Click the Title button.
The Window Title dialog box appears.
2. Type your browser’s name into the text box.
3. Click OK.
The Browser Construction Kit places your browser’s name in the
window’s title bar.
You can’t remove the window title, because your browser needs a name.
When you start a new custom browser project, the Browser Construction Kit
supplies the default name of My Internet Explorer. Obviously, you can stick
with the default name if you want, but your own name is better. (By your own
name, I don’t, of course, mean Fred, Kate, or Sam, but you knew that, right?)

Adding the Browser Pane
In This Chapter
 Exploring the Browser command category
 Adding a browser pane
 Setting the browser pane’s size and position
 Setting the default Web site
Just about every component you add to your custom browser supports
the application’s main feature, its browser pane. The browser pane is
where you view the Web pages to which you connect. All the other controls
in the browser manipulate the browser pane in some way, or at least perform
related activities. In this chapter, you find out everything you need to know
about the browser pane.
The Browser Command Category
To manipulate your browser’s browser pane, you first must select the Browser
command category in the Browser Construction Kit’s editor, as shown in
Figure 5-1. When you do, you see the following commands:
 Top: Specifies the location of the browser pane’s top edge.
 Left: Specifies the location of the browser pane’s left edge.
 Width: Specifies the browser pane’s width.
 Height: Specifies the browser pane’s height.
 Border: Specifies the type of border to appear around the browser pane.
 Start Site: Specifies the Web page the browser first displays.
 Browser: Adds the browser pane to the window.

Besides the command buttons, the Browser toolbox displays the current
mouse coordinates. You can use these coordinates to help find the correct
values for the browser pane’s location and size.
When you first switch to the Browser commands, only the Browser button is
enabled. This is because your copy of the Browser Construction Kit is broken.
Just kidding! The other buttons are disabled because, until you add a browser
pane to your window, the other commands have no effect.
To add the browser pane to your window, click the Browser button. The
Browser Construction Kit then adds the browser pane to the window, as
shown in Figure 5-2. With the new browser pane nestled comfortably in your
window, the Browser Construction Kit enables the other Browser command
buttons. Seems like magic, doesn’t it?
The Wiley Web site shown in the browser pane is only an image, rather than a
real Web site. Don’t bother trying to browse yet! After you set up your com-
plete browser window, you create the finished custom browser, which, of
course, can browse the Internet for real.

Part II: Customizing the Look of the Browser 

Pane Border Style
You can build a snappier looking browser pane by adding a border. Because the
border takes up extra room around the browser pane, however, you should add
the border before you attempt to position and size the browser pane. Of course,
if you’re not adding a browser-pane border, you don’t need to read this section.
The Browser Construction Kit provides four different borders for your browser
pane. To choose one of these borders, click the Border button. When you do,
the Browser Border dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 5-3.
The normal border is a simple, rectangular box that surrounds the browser
pane, as shown in Figure 5-4. Although the normal border is just a few lines, 
it really draws attention to the browser pane. If you want something a little
subtler, go for the thin frame, which is just a narrower version of the normal
border. Even this narrow rectangle can make your browser pane pop.

If subtle isn’t your thing, you can add two types of 3-D borders. To add a stan-
dard 3-D border, select the 3-D Border option in the Browser Border dialog
box. Figure 5-5 shows the standard 3-D border. For an even greater 3-D effect,
choose the Thick 3-D Border option. Awesome!
When you add a border to your browser pane, clicking the Border button a
second time removes the border.

Pane Position
After adding the browser pane to your window, you’ll almost certainly want
to reposition and size it. You position the browser pane by specifying the
location of its top and left edges. To do so, first place the mouse pointer at
the location at which you want to position the browser. If you look at the
bottom of the editor’s toolbox, you can see the mouse’s current location. The
first value is the left position, and the second is the top.
Click the Top button, and the Browser Top dialog box appears (see Figure 5-6).
Type the top value into the text box and click OK. The browser pane moves up
or down to your selected location.

Chapter 5: Adding the Browser Pane

Now do the same thing for the browser’s left edge. Click the Left button, enter
the value for the left edge, and click OK. The browser pane moves left or right
to the selected location. Figure 5-7 shows the browser pane positioned in the
window’s upper-left corner.
Pane Size
You have complete control over the width and height of the browser pane.
Well, you can’t make it bigger than the window, but you know what I mean. To
change the width and height, guess which buttons you click? If you guessed
the Width and Height buttons, you win the cigar. If you guessed your TV’s
power button, return this book immediately and buy Buttons For Dummies
instead.
To set your browser pane’s width, click the Width button. The Browser Width
dialog box appears. Type the width value and click OK. The Browser
Construction Kit sets the browser pane to your selected width.
Set your browser pane’s height in the same way, except click the Height
button. The Browser Height dialog box appears. Type the height value and
click OK. The Browser Construction Kit sets the browser pane to your
selected height. Figure 5-8 shows the browser pane after being positioned
and sized. 
If you add a border to your browser pane, you need to allow extra room
around the pane when you position and size it.

Part II: Customizing the Look of the Browser 

Starting a Web Page
When you load up a browser, its window must display something. What 
the browser displays is the default Web page, or what some people like to 
call the home page. (Because the term “home page” is more commonly used
to describe the first page of a Web site, I don’t like to use it for the browser’s
start-up page; doing so makes the term a little confusing.) The Browser
Construction Kit calls this default page the Start Site.
When you add the browser pane to your browser window, the start site is set
to www.wiley.com, the home page for this book’s publisher. You can, however,
choose any Web site you want. To do so, click the Start Site button. When you
do, the Start Site dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 5-9. Enter the Web site
address you want and then click OK. That’s all there is to it. When you run your
Web browser, it’ll automatically browse to the site you entered.

Assembling the Toolbar
In This Chapter
 Exploring the Toolbar command category
 Adding navigation buttons
 Specifying a favorite search Web site
 Entering a favorites list
A
lthough a toolbar takes up valuable real estate in your browser’s
window, it provides a convenient way for the user to select frequently
used commands. Whereas choosing a command from a menu takes two or
three mouse clicks, a single click is all it takes to select a toolbar command
button.
Your custom browser can have a toolbar, but, more importantly, you can cus-
tomize this toolbar to exactly fit your needs. This customization includes
choosing a toolbar image, as well as deciding which command buttons to 
display on your toolbar. In this chapter, you find out how to add a toolbar 
to your browser’s window.
The Toolbar Command Category
To manipulate your browser’s toolbar, first select the Toolbar command cate-
gory in the Browser Construction Kit’s editor, as shown in Figure 6-1. When
you do, you see the following commands:
 Home: Adds the Home button to the toolbar. The Home button returns
the browser pane to its default Web page.
 Back: Adds the Back button to the toolbar. The Back button returns the
browser pane to the previously viewed Web page.
 Forward: Adds the Forward button to the toolbar. The Forward button
returns the browser pane to the Web page viewed before clicking the
Back button.

 Stop: Adds the Stop button to the toolbar. The Stop button cancels the
loading of the current Web page.
 Refresh: Adds the Refresh button to the toolbar. The Refresh button
reloads the current Web page into the browser pane.
 Search: Adds the Search button to the toolbar. The Search button
causes the browser pane to display the chosen search site.
 Favorites: Adds the Favorites button to the toolbar. The Favorites
button displays a list of favorite Web sites.
 Toolbar: Adds a toolbar to the window.
When you first switch to the Toolbar commands, only the Toolbar button is
enabled. The other buttons are disabled because, until you add a toolbar to
your window, the other commands have no effect. You can’t — at least, not in
this universe — add a toolbar button to a nonexistent toolbar!
To add a toolbar to your window:
1. Click the Toolbar button.
The Toolbar dialog box, shown in Figure 6-2, appears.
Figure 6-1:
Selecting
the Toolbar

commands.
62
Part II: Customizing the Look of the Browser 

2. Choose the toolbar’s location.
For tips on choosing a location, see the section “Toolbar Position,” later
in this chapter.
3. Choose the image that the Browser Construction Kit uses for the tool-
bar’s background.
The upcoming section “Toolbar Image” provides tips on choosing an
image.
4. Click OK.
The selected toolbar appears in the window. Figure 6-3 shows a custom
browser window with a toolbar at the top of the screen.
Figure 6-3:

63
Chapter 6: Assembling the Toolbar

Your new toolbar displays no buttons. You must add the buttons you need
using the commands in the Toolbar toolbox. (Don’t confuse the buttons at
the bottom of the Browser Construction Kit’s window with toolbar buttons.
That’s the area where special function icons appear. See Part IV for more
information.)
When the Browser Construction Kit adds the toolbar, it enables the other
Toolbar command buttons. Clicking the Toolbar button a second time
removes the toolbar and disables the other buttons.
Toolbar Position
You can place your toolbar in one of two locations: top or bottom. Select the
position in the Toolbar dialog box, which appears when you click the Toolbar
button in the toolbox.
The most common place for a toolbar is the top of the window, as shown in
Figure 6-3. Although you can place your toolbar on the bottom of the window,
I’ve never seen a Windows application with the toolbar in that location. Still,
it’s your browser. Do what you want!
Toolbar Image
When completely assembled, the toolbar is a rectangular image that holds 
a set of command buttons. But you knew that already, right? The Browser
Construction Kit enables you to provide your own image for the toolbar’s
background. You can choose .bmp, .jpg, or .gif images. The image’s size should
be 784 x 42 pixels. (Please refer to Chapter 15 for more information on creating
buttons.)
You can choose any size image you want for your toolbar, and the Browser
Construction Kit automatically resizes it to fit. Resizing an image, though,
often leads to a lot of image distortion. Still, this image distortion can create
unusual patterns that can look cool. Feel free to experiment.
To select your toolbar image, follow these steps:
1. Click the Toolbar button in the toolbox.
The Toolbar dialog box appears.
2. Click the Browse button to bring up the Load Toolbar Image 
dialog box.
64
Part II: Customizing the Look of the Browser 

3. Select your image and click Open.
The image’s path and filename appear in the Toolbar Image box of the
Toolbar dialog box.
4. Click the dialog box’s OK button.
The Browser Construction Kit loads the toolbar image and adds the tool-
bar to your window.
Button Types
Your toolbar doesn’t do much unless you add buttons to it. That’s what the
other commands in the Toolbar toolbox do. Also, just as with the toolbar
background, you can supply your own images for the buttons. The buttons
you can add to the toolbar represent the commands that most Web browsers
support. In the following sections, you find out how to add these buttons to
your toolbar.
Back, Forward, Stop, Refresh, 
and Home buttons
The Back, Forward, Stop, Refresh, and Home buttons all control the browser’s
Web navigation. You probably know what all these buttons do. If not, refer to
the section “The Toolbar Command Category,” earlier in this chapter.
To add a button to your browser’s toolbar, follow these steps:
1. Click the button’s command in the toolbox.
2. When you do, the Load Button Image dialog box appears, as shown in
Figure 6-4.
3. Use the file browser to locate the image file you want to use.
You can double-click the image to select it or single-click the image.
4. With the image selected, click the Open button.
The Browser Construction Kit loads the image and displays the new
button on the toolbar, as shown in Figure 6-5.
After adding a button to your toolbar, clicking the button’s command in the
toolbox a second time removes the button from the toolbar.
65
Chapter 6: Assembling the Toolbar

The button images you use should be in the .bmp, .jpg, or .gif format and be
32 x 32 pixels in size. For more information about creating your button
images, refer to Chapter 15.
As with many of the graphical images you use with your custom Web browser,
you can choose any size image you want for your buttons. If the size is other
than 32 x 32 pixels, the Browser Construction Kit resizes the image to fit.
Remember, though, that resizing often leads to distorted images. The greater
the difference from the recommended size, the greater the distortion.

Part II: Customizing the Look of the Browser 

The Search button
Adding a Search button is a little different from adding some other buttons.
You specify the button’s image just as you do with the other buttons, but
after loading the image, you must also specify the Web address of the search
site with which you want the button associated.
To add the Search button to your browser’s toolbar, follow these steps:
1. Click the Search button command in the toolbox.
When you do, the Load Button Image dialog box appears.
2. Use the file browser to locate the image file you want to use.
You can double-click the image to select it or single-click the image.
3. With the image selected, click the Open button.
The Browser Construction Kit loads the image. After loading the image,
the Browser Construction Kit displays the Search Site dialog box, shown
in Figure 6-6.
4. Enter your favorite search Web site’s URL into the text box and 
click OK.
The Browser Construction Kit displays the new Search button on your
toolbar. If you click the Cancel button, the Search button still appears on
the toolbar, but it’s not associated with a Web site.
The Favorites button
When you complete your custom browser, the Favorites button brings up a
list of frequently visited Web sites. You add these Web sites to the list either
at the time you add the Favorites button to your toolbar or when you run the
finished browser.
To add the Favorites button and favorites to your browser’s toolbar:
1. Click the Favorites button command in the toolbox.
When you do, the Load Button Image dialog box appears.
Figure 6-6:
The Search
Site dialog
box.
67
Chapter 6: Assembling the Toolbar

2. Use the file browser to locate the image file you want to use.
You can double-click the image to select it or single-click the image.
3. With the image selected, click the Open button.
The Browser Construction Kit loads the image. After loading the image,
the Browser Construction Kit displays the Favorites dialog box, shown
in Figure 6-7.
4. If you don’t want to add favorite sites at this time, click the Cancel
button; to add a new favorite site, type its URL into the Enter URL text
box.
5. Click the Add button.
The site’s address appears in the list.
To delete an entry from the favorites list, select the entry and click the
Delete button. The Delete All button removes all entries from the list.
Use it with care! (Actually, you get a warning whenever you click the
button.)
6. Repeat Steps 4 and 5 until you’re finished entering favorite Web sites;
then click OK.
The Browser Construction Kit adds the Favorites button to the toolbar.

Designing the Menu Bar
In This Chapter
 Exploring the Menu Bar command category
 Placing a menu bar
 Adding menus
W
indows applications frequently offer two ways to select commands.
The first is clicking buttons on a toolbar, an object that you can read
about in the previous chapter. The second way of giving commands is to yell
at the screen. Well, not really. Actually, the second and most common way to
give commands to an application is with the menu bar. (For the record, my
computer completely ignores all my screaming and yelling. This is how I
know that you can’t give commands to a computer that way.)
Choosing commands from the menu bar, as compared with a toolbar, takes an
extra mouse click or two (not that those extra clicks cramp up your mouse
hand or anything). But the menu bar has the advantage of holding tons more
commands than a toolbar because menus remain hidden until you activate
them, and so take up very little screen space. A toolbar, on the other hand,
stays on the screen. Why all this talk of menu bars? Because, in this chapter,
you find out how to add a menu bar to your custom browser.
The Menu Bar Command Category
As with all the commands used with the Browser Construction Kit, the 
menu bar commands are organized into their own category. To manipulate
your browser’s menu bar, first select the Menu Bar command category in the
Browser Construction Kit’s editor, as shown in Figure 7-1. When you do, you
see the following commands:
 File: Adds the File menu to the menu bar. The File menu contains 
commands like New Window, Open, Properties, and Close.
 Edit: Adds the Edit menu to the menu bar. The Edit menu contains 
commands like Cut, Copy, Paste, and Find.

 View: Adds the View menu to the menu bar. The View menu contains
commands that turn components like toolbars and status bars on 
and off.
 Favorites: Adds the Favorites menu to the menu bar. The Favorites
menu displays a list of favorite Web sites.
 Tools: Adds the Tools menu to the menu bar. The Tools menu contains
commands that manipulate the custom functions like locks, passwords,
and alarms.
 Help: Adds the Help menu to the menu bar. The Help menu contains the
About command, which displays information about who created the
browser.
 Menu Bar: Adds a menu bar to the window.
When you first switch to the Menu Bar commands, only the Menu Bar button
is enabled. The other buttons are disabled because, until you add a menu bar
to your window, the other commands have no effect.
To add a menu bar to your window, click the Menu Bar button. The Browser
Construction Kit adds the menu bar to the top of your browser’s window.
(Another click removes the menu bar from the window.) Figure 7-2 shows a
custom browser window with a menu bar in place. This menu bar has a com-
plete set of menus.
Figure 7-1:
Selecting
the Menu
Bar cate-
gory of

70
Part II: Customizing the Look of the Browser 

For the most part, your custom browser’s menu bar and toolbar contain a 
different set of commands, so, chances are, you’ll want to add both to your
browser’s window. But, depending upon the commands that you want avail-
able in your final browser, you can choose to include either the menu bar or
toolbar — or even neither one.
The Menus
To add a menu to your menu bar, click the appropriate command in the Menu
Bar toolbox. To add the File menu, for example, click the File command. When
you do, a dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 7-3. In this dialog box, you
select the commands that you want included in your menu and then click OK.
The Browser Construction Kit adds the menu to your menu bar. If you click
the Cancel button, the menu doesn’t appear in your menu bar.

Chapter 7: Designing the Menu Bar

After you add a menu, another click of the menu’s command button removes
the menu from the menu bar. If you want to select new commands for the menu
or just review the commands you selected, click the menu in the browser’s
menu bar. The menu’s dialog box, where you can make any changes you like,
appears.
You may have noticed that the menu bar you add to your browser in the
editor doesn’t work like a normal menu bar does. When you click a menu,
instead of the menu dropping down to show its commands, you get a dialog
box instead. Rest assured, however, that the menus in your finished browser
function as normal Windows menus.

Pulling Together the Status Bar
In This Chapter
 Exploring the Status Bar command category
 Adding a status bar
 Specifying a status bar icon
 Adding dates and times
 Implementing a timer
A
s you work with a Windows application, information about the program
appears in various places in the window. These places include not only
the window’s client area, which displays the application’s current document,
but also dialog and message boxes. Another area that can show important
information about an application is the status bar, a small rectangular area
usually located at the bottom of the window.
The type of information displayed in a status bar depends on the application.
In the case of your custom browser, the status bar can display several infor-
mational areas, including time, date, icon, and so on. In this chapter, you find
out how to add a status bar to your custom browser’s windows.
The Status Bar Command Category
As with all the Browser Construction Kit commands, the status bar commands
are organized into their own category. To manipulate your browser’s status bar,
first select the Status Bar command category in the Browser Construction Kit’s
editor, as shown in Figure 8-1. When you do, you see the following buttons:
 Icon: Adds an icon to the status bar.
 Clock: Displays the current time in the status bar.
 Timer: Adds a timer to the status bar. This timer keeps track of the
amount of time spent online.

 Date: Displays the current date in the status bar.
 Current URL: Shows the name of the HTML document currently dis-
played in the browser pane.
 Status Bar: Adds a status bar to the window.
When you first switch to the Status Bar commands, only the Status Bar button
is enabled. The other buttons are disabled because, until you add a status bar
to your window, the other commands have no effect. Makes sense, right?
To add a status bar to your window, follow these steps:
1. Click the Status Bar button.
The Status Bar dialog box, shown in Figure 8-2, appears.
2. Choose the status bar’s location and the image that the Browser
Construction Kit uses for the status bar’s background.
For more information on the status bar’s location, please refer to the fol-
lowing section, “Status Bar Position.”
3. Click OK to add the selected status bar to the window.
Figure 8-3 shows a custom browser window with a status bar — 
including all its displays — in place.

Part II: Customizing the Look of the Browser 

Once you add your status bar to the window, the Browser Construction Kit
enables the other buttons in the Status Bar toolbox. Until then, you can’t
select the other commands.
Status Bar Position
You can place your status bar in one of two locations: top or bottom. Select
the position in the Status Bar dialog box, which appears when you click the
Status Bar button in the toolbox.
The most common place for a status bar is the bottom of the window (refer
to Figure 8-3). You can, however, create more unusual browser by placing
your status bar at the top of the window.

75
Chapter 8: Pulling Together the Status Bar

Although you can place your status bar at the top of the window, I wouldn’t
suggest it (see Figure 8-4). Most people expect to find it at the bottom.
Status Bar Image
When completely assembled, the status bar is a rectangular image that holds
a set of displays. You can provide your own image for the status bar’s back-
ground, choosing from .bmp, .jpg, or .gif images. The image’s size is 784 x 42
pixels. For more information about creating your own status bar image, refer
to Chapter 14.
You can choose any size image you want for your status bar, and the Browser
Construction Kit will automatically resize it to fit. Resizing an image, though,
often leads to image distortion.
To select your status bar image, follow these steps:
1. Click the Status Bar button in the toolbox.
The Status Bar dialog box appears.
2. Click the Browse button to bring up the Load Status Bar Image dialog
box (see Figure 8-5).

3. Select your image and click Open.
The image’s path and filename appear in the Status Bar Image box of the
Status Bar dialog box.
4. Click the dialog box’s OK button.
The Browser Construction Kit loads the status bar image and adds the
status bar to your window.
The Status Bar Icon
You can add a small icon to the far left of your status bar. This icon has no
functional purpose, but can help you brand your browser (such as with a
company logo) or just add an extra image to the browser’s graphical theme.
Heck, you don’t even need a reason. Sometimes an icon just looks cool.
To add an icon to your status bar, perform these steps:
1. Click the Icon button in the toolbox.
The Load Status Bar Icon dialog box, shown in Figure 8-6, appears.
2. Navigate to the icon you want to use, select it, and click the Open
button.
The Browser Construction Kit loads the icon into the status bar. Clicking
the Icon button a second time removes the icon.
Figure 8-5:

Chapter 8: Pulling Together the Status Bar

The Status Bar Clock
The current time can be a handy thing to have available when you’re spend-
ing time browsing your favorite Web sites. I mean, where does the time go?
Seems like you just get started, and suddenly you’ve missed that haircut
appointment.
To help avoid hair-care disasters, add a clock to your browser’s status bar.
Just click the Clock button in the toolbox, and the Browser Construction Kit
adds the clock to the status bar. Clicking the button a second time removes
the clock display from the status bar.
The clock display that appears in your status bar doesn’t actually work. What
good is that, you ask? Well, when you compile your browser into the real
thing, then the clock works fine. In the editor, though, the clock’s image is not
there to show the time, but only to let you know that you’ve added the clock
to the status bar.
The Status Bar Timer
Similar to a clock, a timer can help you keep track of your online time. Also, if
the browser has been set to run only a limited amount of time each day, the
timer reports the amount of time used. Specifically, you can set whether the
timer shows the time online for the current Internet session or the time
remaining before the browser shuts down.
Figure 8-6:
The Load
Status Bar
Icon dialog

78
Part II: Customizing the Look of the Browser 

To add a timer to your browser’s status bar, click the Timer button in the
toolbox. The Browser Construction Kit then displays the Timer Type dialog
box (see Figure 8-7), in which you specify one of three types of timer:
 Session timer: Shows the amount of time spent online for each Internet
session. That is, every time you run the browser, the timer is reset to 0.
 Daily timer: Shows the amount of time spent online for the day. This
type of timer is not reset to 0 each time you run the browser, but is
instead reset the first time the browser is run each day.
 Countdown timer: Shows the amount of time remaining before the
browser shuts down for the day.
Select the type of timer you want in the dialog box. If you select the count-
down timer, you should also type, into the box below the Countdown Timer
option, the maximum number of minutes per day allowed online. Click OK,
and the Browser Construction Kit adds the timer to your status bar.
If you want to change the timer settings, click the timer’s display in the status
bar. When you do, the Timer Type dialog box appears, in which you can make
whatever changes you require.
The Status Bar Date
If you spend a really long time online, you may not be sure even what day it
is. Okay, that probably doesn’t happen to anyone except me, but it’s always
handy to have the date in front of you when you’re working on your com-
puter. In case you haven’t guessed, you can add a date display to your
custom browser’s status bar.
Figure 8-7:
The Timer
Type dialog
box.
79
Chapter 8: Pulling Together the Status Bar

To add the date, click the Date button in the toolbox. With little fanfare, the
Browser Construction Kit adds a date panel to your status bar. Clicking the
button again removes the date from the status bar.
The Current URL
For some strange reason, some people like to see the name of the document
that they’re currently viewing in the browser pane. Why anyone should care
about such minor details is beyond me, but being the reasonable guy I am, I
went ahead and added a Current URL display to the status bar’s list of cool
panels.
To add the current URL display, click the Current URL button in the toolbox.
The Browser Construction Kit adds a URL panel to your status bar. As you
probably already know (but just in case, I’ll tell you anyway), clicking the
button again removes the URL display from the status bar.

Customizing the Address Bar
In This Chapter
 Exploring the Address Bar command category
 Adding an address bar
 Adding a Go button
 Specifying favorite URLs
T
he address bar is one of the most important elements of your browser
window because the address bar is where the browser’s user types the
URLs to which he wants to connect. Not having an address bar in your browser
is a lot like not having a steering wheel in your car. Of course, as is typical with
the Browser Construction Kit, you can choose whether you want an address
bar. Some custom browsers may not need one. For example, if you’re creating a
browser that’s limited to viewing a single Web site, an address bar is as point-
less as a monkey in an aquarium. In this chapter, you find out all about a
custom browser’s address bar element.
The Address Bar Command Category
As with all the Browser Construction Kit commands, the Kit organizes the
address bar commands into their own category, which is, logically enough,
named Address Bar. To manipulate your browser’s address bar, first select
the Address Bar command category in the Browser Construction Kit’s editor,
as shown in Figure 9-1. When you do, you see the following buttons in the
toolbox:
 Go Button: Adds a Go button to the address bar. Clicking this button
causes the browser to connect with the URL currently entered into the
address bar’s text box.
 Favorite 1: Adds a button that enables the user to quick-select the URL
that you’ve assigned to the button.

 Favorite 2: Adds a button that enables the user to quick-select the URL
that you’ve assigned to the button.
 Favorite 3: Adds a button that enables the user to quick-select the URL
that you’ve assigned to the button.
 Favorite 4: Adds a button that enables the user to quick-select the URL
that you’ve assigned to the button.
 Address Bar: Adds an address bar to the window.
When you first switch to the Address Bar commands, only the Address Bar
button is enabled. The other buttons are disabled because, until you add an
address bar to your window, the other commands have no effect. Go ahead
and try clicking them. See. I told you they don’t work yet.
To add an address bar to your window, click the Address Bar button. 
The Address Bar dialog box, seen in Figure 9-2, appears. In this dialog
box, you choose the address bar’s location and the image that the Browser
Construction Kit uses for the address bar’s background. Click the OK button
to add the selected address bar to the window. Figure 9-3 shows a custom
browser window with an address bar — including all its parts — in place.

Address Bar Position
You can place your address bar in one of two locations: top or bottom. (If
your copy of the Browser Construction Kit allows any other positions, you’ve
traveled to the Twilight Zone. Contact me immediately for an interdimensional
return ticket.) Select the position in the Address Bar dialog box, which appears
when you click the Address Bar button in the toolbox.
The most common place for an address bar is at the top of the window, as
shown in Figure 9-3. You can, however, create a more unusual browser by
placing your address bar at the bottom of the window (see Figure 9-4).

Chapter 9: Customizing the Address Bar

Although you can place your address bar at the bottom of the window, that
placement may disorient your users, who expect it at the top. Too bad for
them, you say? I agree completely.
Address Bar Image
When completely assembled, the address bar is a rectangular image that
holds several other parts, including a text box for entering URLs and some
special buttons you read about later in this chapter in the “The Go Button”
and “The Favorites Buttons” sections. You can provide your own image for
the address bar’s background, choosing from .bmp, .jpg, or .gif images. The
image’s size is 784 x 42 pixels. For more information about creating your own
address bar image, refer to Chapter 14, which, although it’s about status bars,
also applies to address bars.
You can choose any size image you want for your address bar, and the Browser
Construction Kit automatically resizes it to fit. Resizing an image, though, often
leads to image distortion, something you may want to avoid — or not.
To select your address bar image, follow these steps:
1. Click the Address Bar button in the toolbox.
The Address Bar dialog box appears.

2. Click the Browse button to bring up the Load Address Bar Image
dialog box (see Figure 9-5).
3. Select your image and click the Open button.
The image’s path and filename appear in the Address Bar Image box of
the Address Bar dialog box.
4. Click the dialog box’s OK button.
The Browser Construction Kit loads the address bar image and adds the
address bar to your window.
The Go Button
A typical Web browser enables you to browse to the address bar’s currently
selected URL in two ways:
 Entering the URL into the address bar and pressing Enter
 Entering the URL into the address bar and clicking the Go button
When you add an address bar to your custom browser’s window, the text box
into which you enter an URL comes with it. The Go button, however, does
not. You can choose to add the button or leave it out. To add the button, click
the Go Button command in the Address Bar toolbox. With no further ado, the
Browser Construction Kit adds the Go button to your address bar.
After you add the Go button, you can remove the Go button by clicking the
Go Button command a second time.

Chapter 9: Customizing the Address Bar

The Favorites Buttons
Do you ever find yourself typing the same Internet addresses over and over?
What a pain, eh? You’ll be happy to know that you can add up to four favorites
buttons to your address bar. These buttons enable you to get to a favorite
Web site with a single mouse click, a pretty cool feature if I do say so myself.
To add a favorites button, follow these steps:
1. Click one of the favorites buttons (they’re called Favorite 1, Favorite
2, Favorite 3, and Favorite 4) in the Address Bar toolbox.
When you do, the Favorite Button dialog box appears (see Figure 9-6).
2. Type the URL to which you want this button to connect.
3. Click OK.
The Browser Construction Kit adds the button to your address bar.
You don’t have to assign a URL to a favorites button when you add it to the
address bar. You can just leave the Favorite Button dialog box blank and click
OK. This idea may sound dumb until you realize that you can set the button’s
URL later, after you compile your custom browser. You can also change a
button’s URL in the editor.
When you add a favorites button, clicking the Favorites command again
removes the button from the address bar. If you need to change the button’s
setting, just click the button in the address bar, and the Favorite Button
dialog box appears, into which you can type a new URL.

M
uch of what makes a custom browser unique is the
graphical elements you choose to use. Components
such as a browser’s border, background, and toolbar dis-
play graphics that you can create with a paint program. 
In Part III, you discover how to create these graphical 
elements, using Paint Shop Pro, one of the best paint pro-
grams out there. The best news is that a trial version of
Paint Shop Pro is included on this book’s CD so that you
can dive right into the creation of custom browser 
graphics.

ne of the most important elements of your custom browser is the
graphics. Although this book’s CD-ROM includes many themes that you
can use for your custom-browser projects, sooner or later, you’re going to
want to create your own. From a mechanical point of view, this task is fairly
easy, but, of course, the end result depends on your artistic skill and the skill
with which you use your graphical software tools. I can’t help you with the
former, but I can get you started with the latter. In this chapter, I introduce
you to Paint Shop Pro, a program you can use to create custom graphics for
your Web browsers.
Installing Paint Shop Pro
This book’s CD-ROM includes a free trial version of Paint Shop Pro 8.1. Hurray!
Before can use Paint Shop Pro, though, it must be installed onto your system.

Running Paint Shop Pro
When you installed Paint Shop Pro, an icon for the program should have
appeared on your desktop. You can run Paint Shop Pro by double-clicking
this icon. You can also run Paint Shop Pro by choosing it from your Start
menu. Choose Start➪Programs➪Jasc Software➪Jasc Paint Shop Pro 8.
When Paint Shop Pro appears on-screen, click the Start button in the splash
window, which shows you information about a program while the program is
loading. Then close the File Format Associations dialog box and the Learning
Center dialog box by clicking the X in each window’s upper-right corner. You
then have a screen that looks like Figure 10-11.
Even after dismissing it from the screen, you can access the Learning Center
at any time from the Paint Shop Pro Help menu. You can access the file asso-
ciations by choosing File➪Preferences.
The large gray area in the center of the window is where you work on your
images. To create a new image, choose File➪New. The New Image dialog box
appears, in which you can set the basic attributes for the new image. The
new image appears as a window in the gray area of Paint Shop Pro’s screen.
You can have several image windows open at once. You can even cut and
paste between the different windows.
To work on images, you need graphical tools. If you look on the left side of
Paint Shop Pro’s screen, you see the toolbox, from which you can access the
tools. Starting from the top of the toolbox, the tools are as follows:
 Pan tool: Drags image view into new positions, as well as provides
access to zooming and sizing functions.
 Deform tool: Twists, turns, and warps an image.
 Crop tool: Crops images (cuts out a portion of an image, throwing away
everything else).
 Move tool: Moves elements of an image. Also provides access to zoom-
ing and sizing functions.
 Selection tool: Selects rectangular or irregular shaped areas of an image.
 Dropper: Selects colors or replaces one color with another.
95
Chapter 10: Introducing Paint Shop Pro

 Paint Brush tool: Draws on an image, as a paintbrush, an airbrush, or a
warp brush (smears colors).
 Clone Brush tool: Creates a paint brush from a portion of an image. Also
provides access to the Scratch Remover tool.
 Dodge Brush tool: Applies special brush effects such as burn, smudge,
soften, sharpen, and emboss.
 Lighten/Darken Brush tool: Applies color effects such as lighten,
darken, saturation change, and hue change.
 Eraser tool: Erases foreground or background image data.
 Picture Tube tool: Stamps graphical images into the image window.
 Flood Fill tool: Fills areas of an image with color, patterns, and gradients.
 Text tool: Adds lines of text to an image.
 Preset Shape tool: Draws predefined shapes, such a circles, rectangles,
stars, arrows, hexagons, and so on.
 Pen tool: Draws various types of lines.
 Object Selection tool: Selects vector graphic objects.

96
Part III: Creating Browser Graphics 

The commands in the toolbars across the top of the window change depend-
ing on the tool you select. On the right side of the screen, you can view and
change some attributes of the image on which you’re working, as well as see
a thumbnail view of your image and choose between the different layers of
which the image is comprised.
In Paint Shop Pro, a layer is a graphical element that you can superimpose
over another element. You can think of layers as transparencies that, when
stacked together, create the final image. Using layers enables you to manipu-
late one part of an image without affecting another, even if the layers have
graphical elements that overlap.
The tools and commands discussed in this chapter are only the tip of the ice-
berg. As you work with Paint Shop Pro, you’ll discover a wealth of techniques
for creating the perfect images for your custom browser. For more informa-
tion on these techniques, please refer to the remaining chapters in this part
of the book.

with Borders
In This Chapter

 Filling an image with color
 Changing a rectangle to 3-D
 Adding details to the border image
N
ot every custom Web browser you build needs fancy border graphics,
but when you decide to use borders, you want them to be attractive.
You may think that you need to be an artist to create attractive graphical ele-
ments for your browsers, but that’s not necessarily the case. Paint Shop Pro
is readily suited for the task and can provide artistic help. In this chapter, you
find out how to create borders, as well as discover a few handy graphical tips.
Understanding Border Requirements
Creating a custom border is a fairly easy task, but it does require several steps.
A little artistic know-how doesn’t hurt either, but Paint Shop Pro’s powerful
functions — once you know how to use them — can help even the most
fumble-fingered artist turn out a decent border. (If you can use a little help
with Paint Shop Pro, refer to Chapter 10.) If you don’t believe me, you’re in
for a big surprise as you work through this chapter’s border project.
The most important things to know when creating graphics for a custom
browser are the size and color depth measurements you need. The following
list summarizes these attributes for a border:

 Width of 784 pixels
 Height of 32 pixels
 Resolution of 200 pixels per centimeter
 Color depth of 16 million colors (24-bit color)
If you create your browser border with a different size or resolution, you may
see some distortion when you load it into your browser. That’s because the
browser automatically resizes the graphics to fit inside it. The color depth 
is most important when working with Paint Shop Pro. After finishing your
graphic, you can save it with a different color depth.
Starting a New Border
To create a border, you must start with a blank image of the correct resolu-
tion. Here’s how:
1. Choose File➪New.
The New Image dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 11-1.
2. From the Units box, select Pixels.
This option may be already set to this value.
3. Using the scroll arrows, change the width to 784.
Figure 11-1:
The New
Image
dialog box.
100
Part III: Creating Browser Graphics 

4. Change the height to 32.
5. Set the resolution to 200 Pixels/cm.
This option is probably already set to this value.
6. In the Image Characteristics area, select the Raster Background option.
7. In the Color Depth drop-down list, choose 16 Million Colors.
Again, this option is probably already set to this value.
8. Make sure that the Color box is set to white.
To set the color, if necessary, click the box and then choose the color
from the dialog box that appears.
9. Make sure that the Transparent checkbox is not selected.
10. Click OK.
Paint Shop Pro creates a blank image for your new border, as shown in
Figure 11-2.
11. Save this image under a name like BlankBorder.
You can then use this file as a template for starting new borders. Just
load the template, choose File➪Save As, and save the template under a
new name.

Chapter 11: Jazzing Up Your Browser with Borders

Eleven steps may seem like a lot just to get a blank image up on the screen,
but once you get used to the settings, it takes only a couple of seconds to
create a new image.
Filling the Background
After you have a new blank image to work with (see the preceding section),
you’re ready to really dig into Paint Shop Pro. For this first border, you create
a simple 3-D bar. But first you need a rectangle filled with a background color.
Follow these steps to get the job done:
1. In the toolbox on the left of the window, select the Flood Fill tool.
It’s the one that looks like a tipped paint bucket.
The Flood Fill tool’s settings appear in the toolbar (see Figure 11-3).
2. In the Flood Fill tool’s attributes, set Match Mode to RGB Value.
3. Set Tolerance to 0.
4. Set Blend Mode to Normal.
5. Set Opacity to 100.
6. Click inside the Foreground color box (the first of the black boxes in
the upper-right corner — see Figure 11-4).
The Material dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 11-5. If it isn’t
already selected, click the Color tab.
7. Click the light gray square in the color selections.
The R, G, and B values should all change to 192. If not, you clicked the
wrong color. Try again. You’ll use this color as the background color for
this particular border. You can use any color you like for other borders.
8. Click OK.
The selected color in the Foreground color box changes to light gray.
9. Place the tool over the image and click again.
Paint Shop Pro fills the image with light gray.

Changing the Rectangle to 3-D
After you have a simple border, you can turn it into a 3-D border with just a
little more work. Paint Shop Pro helps those people who have little or no artis-
tic talent create pretty cool stuff.
1. In the Effects menu, place your mouse cursor over the 3D Effects 
command.
The 3D Effects menu appears (see Figure 11-6).
2. Choose Buttonize.
The Buttonize dialog box appears (see Figure 11-7).
3. Change the Height setting to 5.
4. Change the Width setting to 5.
5. Select the Transparent edge.
Figure 11-6:
The 3D

104
Part III: Creating Browser Graphics 

6. Change the Opacity setting to 75.
As you change the settings, the pane to the right, in the dialog box, pre-
views the result of the settings on the image.
7. Click OK.
Paint Shop Pro applies the effect, giving you the border shown in Figure
11-8. Awesome!
Painting a 3-D Rivet
Your simple 3-D border already looks good, but you can make it look even
better by adding a couple of details. In this section, you add two rivets to the
3-D rectangle so that it looks as if it’s been attached to the screen. Of course,
to pull off this embellishment, you need to be an accomplished artist. Well,
not really. Anyone who can click an on-screen button can add the rivets. These
steps show you how to add two rivets:

Chapter 11: Jazzing Up Your Browser with Borders

1. Create a new blank image with a size of 24 x 24 pixels. Also, in the
Image Characteristics box, select the Transparent option.
The new image appears in Paint Shop Pro’s work area.
2. Click the Pan tool (the top tool in the toolbox, the one that looks like
an arrow mouse cursor).
The tool’s settings appear in the toolbar near the top of the window (see
Figure 11-9).
3. In the box labeled Zoom By 5 Steps, click the 5+ selection twice.
Paint Shop Pro magnifies the new 24 x 24 image to ten times its original
size (see Figure 11-10).

4. Click the Preset Shape tool in the toolbox.
The Preset Shape tool is the third tool from the bottom, the one that
looks like an oval on top of a rectangle.
The tool’s settings appear in the toolbar, as shown in Figure 11-11.
5. In the drop-down list to the left of the toolbar, make sure that Ellipse
is selected.
6. Deselect the Retain Style option and deselect the Create As Vector
option.
7. In the upper-right corner of Paint Shop Pro’s window, make sure both
boxes in the Material pane (where you previously set the gray color)
are set to the same light gray color.
You’ll probably have to change the second one from white to gray. (If
you’re not sure how to change colors, refer to the previous section.) 
The first box controls the color of the shape’s outline, and the second
box controls the color of the fill.
8. Place the mouse cursor in the 24 x 24 image’s upper-left corner and,
while holding down the left mouse button, drag the cursor to the lower-
right corner, releasing the button when you’re done.
A light-gray, filled circle appears in the image’s window, as shown in Fig-
ure 11-12. (Ignore the gray checkerboard in the background. That’s just
the pattern Paint Shop Pro uses to display a transparent background.)

Part III: Creating Browser Graphics 

Adding the Rivet to the Border
If you have two images, a 3-D rectangle and a rivet graphic, you’re ready to
combine everything into a single browser border. Just follow these steps:
1. Select the entire rivet image.
To do so, choose Selections➪Select All or press Ctrl+A on your keyboard.
An animated outline appears around the rivet to indicate that it’s been
selected.
2. Choose Edit➪Copy (or just press Ctrl+C) to copy your image to the
Clipboard.
3. Click the 784 x 32 rectangle title bar to select that window.
4. Paste the copied rivet graphic into the 3-D rectangle’s window.
To perform this paste, either choose Edit➪Paste➪Paste As New Selection
or press Ctrl+E. The rivet image appears under the mouse pointer. (If it
doesn’t, be sure that your mouse pointer is over the 3-D rectangle.)
5. Use your mouse to position the rivet near the left end of the rectangle
and click the left mouse button to paste it there.
Paint Shop Pro drops the image in the selected location.
6. Paste another copy of the rivet into the window.
7. Position this rivet at the other end of the border graphic.
8. Deselect the rivet image.
To deselect a selection, choose Selections➪Select None or press Ctrl+D.
Paint Shop Pro deselects the second rivet image in the border. Figure
11-15 shows the completed border image.
Figure 11-14:

Chapter 11: Jazzing Up Your Browser with Borders

Saving the Border
Once your image is complete, you need to save it to your hard drive. 
Here’s how:
1. Choose File➪Save As.
The Save As dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 11-16.
2. In the Save In drop-down list, browse to the folder where you want to
save your new border.
3. In the File Name box, type the name you want for the border (like
maybe RivetBorder).
4. In the Save As Type box, select CompuServe Graphics Interchange
(*.gif), as shown in Figure 11-17, and then click Save.
Paint Shop Pro saves the image to your hard drive. (If you’re asked
whether it’s okay to reduce the colors to 256, answer Yes.)
To better organize your graphics, create a special folder for your browser
images.

I
f you’ve created any custom browsers with the Browser Construction Kit,
you already know that such a browser can have a graphical background
that I refer to as a skin. Paint Shop Pro (and most other full-featured paint pro-
grams) supports all the techniques you need to create such backgrounds. In
this chapter, you find out how to use Paint Shop Pro to create browser skins.
Understanding Skin Requirements
Just as with every other graphical element that you can use with your custom
browsers, a skin must be of a certain size and resolution. Moreover, starting
with a 24-bit image (one that can display 16 million colors) ensures that the
image is compatible with any graphical processing you want to perform. That
being said, here are the specific requirements for a browser background, or
skin as I call it:
 Width of 784 pixels
 Height of 559 pixels
 Resolution of 200 pixels per centimeter
 Color depth of 16 million colors (24-bit color)
If you create your browser skin with a different size or resolution, you may
see some distortion when you load it into your browser. This distortion results
because the browser automatically resizes the graphics to fit. The 24-bit color
depth is mainly for use with Paint Shop Pro, so you can use the most options
when creating your image. When saving the final image, you can use any color
depth you want.

Starting a Skin
The previous section covers the size and resolution requirements for creating
a custom browser skin. The following steps lead you through the creation of
such an image:
1. Choose File➪New.
The New Image dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 12-1.
2. Using the drop-down list, set the Units box to Pixels.
3. Change the width to 784.
4. Change the height to 559.
5. Set the resolution to 200 Pixels/cm.
This option is probably already set to this value.
6. Make sure that the Raster Background option is selected.
7. Set the Color Depth box to 16 Million Colors.
Again, this option is probably already set to this value.
8. Make sure that the Color box is set to white and the Transparent
option isn’t selected.
9. Click OK.
Paint Shop Pro creates a blank image for your new background, as shown
in Figure 12-2.
Figure 12-1:

Image
dialog box

appropriate
settings for
a browser

Part III: Creating Browser Graphics 

10. Save your work.
If you’ve never saved the image before, the Save As dialog box appears,
in which you must give your image a filename and select the image-format
type. I suggest the .jpg image type.
Filling a Background with a Texture
A plain white background isn’t too exciting for a browser skin. (Talk about
stating the obvious!) Paint Shop Pro can help you make the background more
stimulating in a number of ways. One of the easiest fixes is to add a textured
fill to the image. Follow these steps to get the job done:
1. In the toolbox on the left of the window, select the Flood Fill tool.
This tool looks like a tipped paint bucket. The Flood Fill tool’s settings
appear in the toolbar, as shown in Figure 12-3.
2. In the Flood Fill tool’s attributes, make sure that Match Mode is set to
RGB Value.

3. Set Tolerance to 0.
4. Set Blend Mode to Normal.
5. Set Opacity to 100.
6. Click the foreground color box in the Materials pane.
The Material dialog box appears.
7. In the upper-right portion of the dialog box, select the Texture option.
Paint Shop Pro enables the Texture settings. With textures, you can add
textured fills to your images, which are often better suited for filling
large areas, rather than just using a blah, single color.
8. In the texture drop-down list, select the Crumpled Paper 02 texture, as
shown in Figure 12-4.
The Crumpled Paper texture adds an attractive pattern to your back-
ground.
9. On the Color tab, select the color you want to use for the fill.
The Current box, to the right of the colors, shows the selected color
with the texture applied.
10. Click OK to finalize your settings and to close the dialog box.
Your texture and color appear in the foreground color box.
11. Place the Flood Fill tool over the blank image and click.
Paint Shop Pro fills the image with the color and texture you selected, as
shown in Figure 12-5.
12. Save your work.
If you’ve never saved the image before, the Save As dialog box appears,
in which you must give your image a filename and select the image-
format type. I suggest the .jpg image type.

Chapter 12: Painting Skins

Filling a Background with a Pattern
Textured backgrounds can be just what you need, but often you may want to
use an image not available in the texture choices. Using a pattern fill is simi-
lar to using a texture fill, but gives you a different set of options. The follow-
ing steps demonstrate how to create a background using patterns.
The main difference between a texture and a pattern is that, with a pattern,
you can’t select a color. Instead, your pattern fills the image using the same
colors that the pattern uses. As such, this fill technique is much like filling
your image with a photograph. You can combine a pattern with a texture to
accomplish an even wider range of fill effects. Figure 12-6, for example, shows
the Crumpled Paper 02 texture combined with the Diamond Plate Flat pattern.
Note that the fill still takes on the pattern’s colors.
1. Create a new 784 x 559 image.
If you’ve forgotten how to do so, see “Starting a Skin,” earlier in this
chapter.
2. Select the Flood Fill tool.
The Flood Fill tool’s settings appear in the toolbar.
3. In the Flood Fill tool’s attributes, make sure that Match Mode is set to
RGB Value.

If you’ve never saved the image before, the Save As dialog box appears,
in which you must give your image a filename and select the image-format
type. I suggest the .jpg image type.
Filling a Background with a Gradient
A gradient is one or more colors that blend in different shades across the 
surface of an image. While this description may be hard to visualize, the first
time you paint with a gradient, you’ll know exactly what I mean. If not, you’ll
be required to turn in your Custom Browser Builder’s license — just kidding!
As you may have guessed, painting with a gradient is exactly what you do in
this section. Just follow these steps:
1. Create a new 784 x 559 image.
Refer the section “Starting a Skin,” earlier in this chapter, if you’re not
sure how.
2. Select the Flood Fill tool.
The Flood Fill tool’s settings appear in the toolbar.
3. In the Flood Fill tool’s attributes, make sure that Match Mode is set to
RGB Value.
4. Set Tolerance to 0.
5. Set Blend Mode to Normal.
6. Set Opacity to 100.
7. Click the foreground color box in the Materials pane.
The Material dialog box appears.
8. If the Texture option is selected, turn it off.
9. Click the Gradient tab to select the page containing gradient attributes.
The Gradient page appears in the dialog box, as shown in Figure 12-10.
10. In the gradient drop-down list, select the Chrome Reflect gradient
option, as shown in Figure 12-11.
11. Click OK.
Your selected gradient appears in the foreground color box.
12. Place the Flood Fill tool over the blank image and click.
Paint Shop Pro fills the image with the gradient you selected (see Fig-
ure 12-12).

Chapter 12: Painting Skins

You may remember that, when you create a new image with Paint Shop Pro,
you choose 24-bit color, which allows you over 16 million different colors. This
color depth is important because many of Paint Shop Pro’s special graphical
functions require 24-bit color. The good new is that, once you’ve created your
image, you can save it with any color depth you want. Paint Shop Pro does
the conversion for you, and, although you may see degradation in the resul-
tant image, the conversion usually goes pretty well. If it doesn’t, resave the
file in a different format. (In other words, check the resultant image before
you close the original!) Avoid saving photographic images in less than 24-bit
color, because you’ll definitely see the difference then.

Creating Toolbars
In This Chapter
 Creating a toolbar image
 Filling the toolbar with color
 Adding images to the toolbar
 Changing the rectangle to 3-D
A
toolbar is a handy place to put frequently used commands where the
user can select them with a single button click. A toolbar sure beats
hunting through the application’s menus for a command! A custom browser
created with the Browser Construction Kit provides room for all the basic
browsing commands your Internet surfer will need to get around the huge
domain of the World Wide Web. In this chapter, you find out how to create
the background image for a toolbar. For information on creating toolbar but-
tons, refer to Chapter 15.
Understanding Toolbar Requirements
Like every other image you work with when creating a custom browser theme,
the image you use for your toolbar must, for the best results, have a specific
set of attributes. These attributes include not only the toolbar’s size, but also
the number of colors and the image’s resolution. These attributes are compli-
cated by the fact that you can have either a horizontal or vertical toolbar.
Each has its own requirements. The following list summarizes these attrib-
utes for a horizontal toolbar image:
 Width of 784 pixels
 Height of 42 pixels
 Resolution of 200 pixels per centimeter
 Color depth of 16 million colors (24-bit color)

Here are the requirements for a vertical toolbar image:
 Width of 42 pixels
 Height of 562 pixels
 Resolution of 200 pixels per centimeter
 Color depth of 16 million colors (24-bit color)
If you create your browser’s toolbar image with a different size or resolution,
you may see some distortion when you load it into your browser because the
browser automatically resizes the image to fit the window. If you allow the
user to resize your custom browser’s window, however, some distortion is
inevitable, because the browser will resize its images to fit the new window’s
size. The color depth is mostly important for use with Paint Shop Pro. You
can save the final file in any color depth that looks good for your image.
Starting a New Toolbar
To create a toolbar, you must start with a blank image of the correct resolution.
Those of you who have read Chapters 10 through 12 are probably already
experts at this process. Give yourselves a pat on the back and feel free to smirk
at people who don’t know how to use Paint Shop Pro. For those of you who are
new to creating blank images with Paint Shop Pro (you know, the smirkees),
or for those who need a refresher course, here’s how to get the job done for a
toolbar image:
1. Choose File➪New.
The New Image dialog box appears.
2. Make sure the Units box is set to Pixels.
3. Change Width to 784.
4. Change Height to 42.
5. Set Resolution to 200 Pixels/cm.
The option is probably already set to this value.
6. Make sure that the Raster Background option is selected.
126
Part III: Creating Browser Graphics 

7. Set the Color Depth box to 16 Million Colors.
Again, this option is probably already set to this value.
8. Make sure that the Color box is set to white and the Transparent
option is not selected.
Figure 13-1 shows these settings.
The Transparent option is for creating images that seem to be nonrec-
tangular. Although the resultant image really is rectangular, the transpar-
ent part of the image allows the colors underneath the image to show
through. Because a toolbar is a rectangular item, you have no need for
transparency.
9. Click OK.
Paint Shop Pro creates a blank image for your new toolbar, as shown in
Figure 13-2.
10. Save your work.
If you’ve never saved the image before, the Save As dialog box appears,
in which you must give your image a filename and select the image-
format type. I suggest the .jpg image type.

Chapter 13: Creating Toolbars

Filling the Toolbar’s Background
After you have a new blank image to work with, you can start making it look
more interesting. For this first toolbar, you create a 3-D image. The first step
is to fill your blank rectangle with the background color you want. (Actually,
the image isn’t blank — it’s already filled with white — but that’s not going to
change the process of filling the image with your selected color.) Follow these
steps to fill your toolbar’s image:
1. In the toolbox on the left of the window, select the Flood Fill tool.
That’s the thirteenth tool down, the one that looks like a tipped paint
bucket.
The Flood Fill tool’s settings appear in the toolbar (see Figure 13-3).

3. Set Tolerance to 0.
4. Set Blend Mode to Normal.
5. Set Opacity to 100.
6. Click inside the foreground color box in the Materials pane (see Fig-
ure 13-4).
The Material dialog box appears (see Figure 13-5).
7. Click the Color tab and then click the light gray square in the color
selections. Also make sure that the Texture option is not selected.
The R, G, and B values should all change to 192. If they didn’t, you
clicked the wrong color. Try again.

Chapter 13: Creating Toolbars

8. Click OK.
The selected color changes to light gray.
9. Place the tool over the image and click again.
Paint Shop Pro fills the image with light gray (see Figure 13-6).
10. Save your work.
If you’ve never saved the image before, the Save As dialog box appears, in
which you must give your image a filename and select the image-format
type. I suggest the .jpg image type.
Adding a Sunburst Effect
You can spend an entire day experimenting with the different effects Paint
Shop Pro puts at your disposal. I don’t know how much spare time you have
to fool around with Paint Shop Pro, but I’ve got a lot of work to do, so, rather
than experimenting, I’m going to suggest a very cool effect for your toolbar.
The sunburst effect adds a bright light source, with rays and reflections. Per-
form the following steps to see what I mean:
1. Make sure your image’s window is selected.
You can select them image window by clicking its title bar.
This step ensures that you apply the effect to the correct image — just
in case you happen to have more than one image open in Paint Shop Pro’s
work area.
2. Choose Effects➪Illumination Effects➪Sunburst, as shown in Figure 13-7.
The Sunburst dialog box appears.
3. In the Light Spot options, set Brightness to 80, Horizontal to 70, and
Vertical to 20.
These options determine the brightness of the light source (the higher
the setting, the brighter the light), as well as the light’s horizontal and
vertical position.
Figure 13-6:
The newly
filled toolbar
image.
130
Part III: Creating Browser Graphics 

4. In the Rays options, set Density to 30 and Brightness to 50.
These options determine how many rays you get and how bright the
rays are.
5. In the Circle options, set Brightness to 100.
These options determine how the reflective circles of the effect look.
The higher this setting, the more obvious the reflective circles are.
Figure 13-8 shows the Sunburst dialog box with its correct settings.
6. Click OK.
Paint Shop Pro applies the Sunburst effect to your toolbar image, as
shown in Figure 13-9.
7. Save your work.
If you’ve never saved the image before, the Save As dialog box appears, in
which you must give your image a filename and select the image-format
type. I suggest the .jpg image type.
Figure 13-7:

Chapter 13: Creating Toolbars

Feel free to experiment with other Paint Shop Pro effects. If you don’t like what
you get, you can just select the Undo command to remove the effect. You can
access Undo from the Edit menu or by pressing Ctrl+Z on your keyboard.
Adding a Graphic to the Toolbar
You can make a lot more changes to make your toolbar more interesting. Paint
Shop Pro provides something called the Picture Tube tool that enables you 
to stamp detailed graphical images onto your toolbar. Sounds like fun, eh?
Here’s how:
1. Make sure that your image’s window is selected.
2. Choose Layers➪New Raster Layer, as shown in Figure 13-10.
The New Raster Layer dialog box appears.
Figure 13-9:
The toolbar
with the
Sunburst
effect.
Figure 13-8:
The
Sunburst

132
Part III: Creating Browser Graphics 

3. In the New Raster Layer dialog box, change the Name box to Gold Star.
This name can be anything you want, as it just identifies the layer.
4. Set Blend Mode to Normal.
The blend mode determines how layers affect each other.
5. Set Opacity to 25.
Opacity determines how transparent a layer is.
6. Set Link Set to 0.
Link Set determines which layers are locked together and move as a
single unit.
7. Select the Layer Is Visible setting.
Figure 13-11 shows the New Raster Layer dialog box with its correct 
settings.
8. Click OK.
Paint Shop Pro adds a new layer on top of your toolbar’s background
layer. This extra layer enables you to manipulate any new graphics you
add to the toolbar, without changing the sunburst effect underneath.
Figure 13-10:
The New
Raster Layer
command.
133
Chapter 13: Creating Toolbars

9. Select the Picture Tube tool, which is the twelfth tool from the top in
the toolbox, right above the Flood Fill tool.
The Picture Tube tool’s settings appear in Paint Shop Pro’s toolbar, as
shown in Figure 13-12.
10. In the tool’s settings, select the Gold Star Garland picture tube, as
shown in Figure 13-13.
To display the selections, click the small arrow next to the displayed
shape in the tool’s settings toolbar.
The selected picture appears in the tool’s settings.
11. Also in the tool’s settings, change the Scale value to 72.
The Scale value determines the size of the resultant graphic. The setting
of 72 makes the graphic 72 percent of its original size.
12. In the Layer pane, click the Gold Star layer to ensure that it’s the
selected layer (see Figure 13-14).
Paint Shop Pro selects the Gold Star layer for manipulation.

13. Place your mouse cursor over the left end of the toolbar and click; if a
globe appears, press Ctrl+Z to remove it and then click again.
A golden star with two smaller globes appears in the toolbar, as shown
in Figure 13-15. Notice that the layer’s transparency value of 25 allows
the sunburst effect to show through. The higher this transparency value,
the less of the background shows through.
Figure 13-14:

135
Chapter 13: Creating Toolbars

14. Add several more Gold Star Garland images (as in Step 10) to the 
toolbar.
15. Select the Move tool, which is the fourth tool down from the top.
16. Place the Move tool over your toolbar, on top of one of the gold stars,
hold down the left mouse button, and drag the Gold Star layer to
whatever position looks best.
Now you see the power of layers! Figure 13-16 shows your toolbar as it
looks now.
17. Save your work.
If you’ve never saved the image before, the Save As dialog box appears,
in which you must give your image a filename and select the image-
format type. I suggest the .jpg image type.
You can add as many layers as you need in order to provide perfect control
over the elements that make up your images.
Adding a 3-D Effect
You can add a 3-D effect to your toolbar in several ways. One is using Paint
Shop Pro’s Buttonize effect (see Chapter 11 for more information on this
effect), but for your toolbar, you’ll use a more subtle 3-D effect: drop shad-
ows. To see how drop shadows work, perform the following steps:

136
Part III: Creating Browser Graphics 

1. Select the Gold Star layer, if it isn’t selected already.
2. Choose Effects➪3D Effects➪Drop Shadow.
The Drop Shadow dialog box appears (see Figure 13-17).
3. In the Offset options, set Vertical to 8 and Horizontal to 8.
These options control the position of the shadows. The higher the
values, the more the shadow moves away from the source graphic.
4. In the Attributes options, set Opacity to 50, Blur to 5, and Color to
black.
Opacity controls the shadows’ transparency, whereas Blur controls the
definition of the shadows’ edges and Color controls the shadows’ color.
5. Click OK.
Paint Shop Pro adds shadows to the Gold Star layer, as shown in Figure
13-18.

6. Save your work.
If you’ve never saved the image before, the Save As dialog box appears, in
which you must give your image a filename and select the image-format
type. I suggest the .jpg image type.
If you want to make the Gold Star layer more vivid, increase the transparency
setting. You can do this in the Layer pane. See that slider on the right side of
the Layer pane? Drag the one for the Gold Star layer to change its trans-
parency, as shown in Figure 13-19.

Painting Status Bars
In This Chapter
 Creating a status bar image

M
ost Windows applications have a status bar, where the application can
display messages and status information. Your custom browser can
have a status bar, too. In fact, you can create your own images to use with the
status bar. In this chapter, you discover how to do just that.
Understanding Status Bar Requirements
The Browser Construction Kit expects the graphical components you use 
to fit a set of attributes, including a specific size and number of colors. Your
status bar is no different. For the best results, create your status bar with
these attributes:
 Width of 784 pixels
 Height of 24 pixels
 Resolution of 200 pixels per centimeter
 Color depth of 16 million colors (24-bit color)
If you create your browser’s status bar image with a different size or resolu-
tion, you may see some distortion when you load it into your browser because
the browser automatically resizes the image to fit the window. If you allow the
user to resize your custom browser’s window, however, some distortion is
inevitable, because the browser will resize its images to fit the new window’s
size. The color depth is of utmost importance to Paint Shop Pro, because you
can do more with a 24-bit image than one of a lower color depth. However,
when you save your final image, you can use whatever color depth best suits
your purposes.

Starting a New Status Bar
The first step toward creating your status bar is to create a blank image of the
correct resolution. (This is, in fact, the first step toward creating any original
image with Paint Shop Pro.) Here’s how to get started with a new status bar:
1. Choose File➪New.
The New Image dialog box appears.
2. Make sure the Units box is set to Pixels.
3. Change Width to 784.
4. Change Height to 24.
5. Set Resolution to 200 Pixels/cm.
This option is probably already set to this value.
6. Make sure that the Raster Background option is selected.
This option creates a raster image, which is an image composed of
columns and rows of dots called pixels. A raster image is very different
from a vector image, which is composed of movable and sizable graphi-
cal objects.
7. Set the Color Depth box to 16 Million Colors.
Again, this option is probably already set to this value.
8. Make sure that the Color box is set to white and the Transparent option
is not selected.
Figure 14-1 shows these settings.
9. Click OK.
Paint Shop Pro creates a blank image for your new status bar, as shown
in Figure 14-2.
10. Save your work.
To save your work, choose File➪Save. If you haven’t previously given
this image a filename, the Save As dialog box appears. In this dialog box,
give the image a filename and select the type of image format you want
to use. I suggest that you save your browser graphics in the .jpg format.

Chapter 14: Painting Status Bars

Filling the Status Bar’s Background
Got a new image to work with? If not, you need to jump back to the previous
section and create one. When you have your new blank image, it’s time to fill
it with some color. Follow these steps to fill your status bar’s image:
1. In the toolbox on the left of the window, select the Flood Fill tool.
That’s the thirteenth tool down, the one that looks like a tipped paint
bucket.
The Flood Fill tool’s settings appear in the status bar (see Figure 14-3).
2. In the Flood Fill tool’s attributes, make sure that Match Mode is set to
RGB Value.
This setting tells Paint Shop Pro to fill areas based on the RGB values of
colors, rather than some other color attribute like luminance.
3. Set Tolerance to 0.
A tolerance of 0 limits the fill function to filling only areas of a single color.
The higher you set tolerance, the greater the number of similar colors
the fill function will affect. When tolerance is set all the way up, the fill
function fills the entire image, regardless of the colors used in the image.
4. Set Blend Mode to Normal.
The blend mode determines the way the fill function combines colors.
The normal blend mode causes the fill color to replace all affected colors.
5. Set Opacity to 100.
Opacity determines the transparency of the fill. A value of 100 specifies
an opaque fill, whereas lower values make the fill more transparent.
6. In Paint Shop Pro’s window, click inside the foreground color box in
the Materials pane (see Figure 14-4).
(The Materials pane is in Paint Shop Pro’s upper-right corner.) The
Material dialog box appears.
Figure 14-3:

7. Select the Color tab.
8. Click the light gray square in the color selections.
The R, G, and B values should all change to 192, as shown in Figure 14-5.
If they didn’t, you clicked the wrong color. Try again.
9. Make sure that the Texture option isn’t selected.
10. Click OK.
The selected foreground color in the Materials pane changes to light gray.
11. Place the tool over the image and click again.
Paint Shop Pro fills the image with light gray.

12. Save your work.
To save your work, choose File➪Save. If you haven’t previously given
this image a filename, the Save As dialog box appears. In this dialog box,
give the image a filename and select the type of image format you want
to use. I suggest that you save your browser graphics in the .jpg format.
Adding the 3-D Effect
Paint Shop Pro provides many effects for changing a 2-D image to 3-D, but
with your status bar, you’re going to discover some tricks to draw 3-D detail
from scratch. Perform the following steps to see how to add 3-D ridges to
your status bar:
1. Click the Pen tool, which is the second tool from the bottom in Paint
Shop Pro’s toolbox.
The Pen settings appear in the toolbar (see Figure 14-6).
2. Turn off the Create As Vector option.
3. In the Line Style box, use the drop-down list to select the Solid option,
as shown in Figure 14-7.
4. Set Width to 1.0.
This setting results in thin lines. The higher the width setting, the
thicker the lines.
5. Turn off the Anti-alias option, located to the right of the Width setting.
Anti-aliasing combines colors in such a way as to help hide the stair-step
effect you often get with computer graphics, especially on curved lines.
You don’t need this effect for this project.
6. Click the foreground color box in the Materials pane.
The Material dialog box appears.
Figure 14-6:
The Pen
tool’s

144
Part III: Creating Browser Graphics 

7. Select the white color and make sure that the Texture option is off.
Normally, you don’t want to use textures, which add various kinds of
patterns to images, as you’re drawing.
8. Place your mouse cursor in the upper-left corner of the status bar, at
the location (x:0 y:0).
This is the location at which you’ll begin drawing a line. You can see
these coordinates in Paint Shop Pro’s status bar.
9. Hold down your left mouse button and drag the cursor to the upper-
right corner of the status bar image, drawing a straight line between
the two points.
In Paint Shop Pro’s status bar, you should see 90.0 degrees to the right of
the line’s coordinates.

12. Draw a black line right below the white line, starting at point (x:0 y:1).
This setting gives you a black line one pixel below the white line. When
you’re done drawing, the white lines look like reflective edges, and the
black lines look like shadowed edges.
13. Draw a black line at the bottom of the status bar image, starting at
point (x:0 y:23).
14. Draw a white line right above the black line you drew in the previous
step, starting at point (x:0 y:22).
Figure 14-8 shows your completed status bar image.
15. Save your work.
To save your work, choose File➪Save. If you haven’t previously given
this image a filename, the Save As dialog box appears. In this dialog box,
give the image a filename and select the type of image format you want
to use. I suggest that you save your browser graphics in the .jpg format.
The white and black lines make your status bar’s edges look 3-D because the
colors simulate reflection and shadow.

W
hile Chapter 13 tells you how to paint the background image for your
custom browser’s toolbar, it doesn’t describe how to make buttons
for your toolbar. Your custom browser’s toolbar can have buttons for the
complete set of navigation controls, including Home, Back, Forward, Stop,
Refresh, Search, and Favorites. In this chapter, you use Paint Shop Pro to
create new buttons for your browser’s toolbar.
Understanding Button Requirements
Buttons may be small, but you need to take as much care in their creation as
you would with larger images, such as toolbars. And, just as with toolbars or
other images, you first need to start your button with a new blank image of
the correct size and color depth. Here are the attributes for a button:
 Width of 32 pixels
 Height of 32 pixels
 Resolution of 200 pixels per centimeter
 Color depth of 16 million colors (24-bit color)
If you create your browser’s button image with a different size or resolution,
you may see some distortion when you load it into your browser. This is
because the browser automatically resizes the image to fit the buttons in
your toolbar.

Starting a New Button
A new button starts with a blank image, which has the attributes described in
the previous section. Here’s a step-by-step guide to creating a button:
1. Choose File➪New.
The New Image dialog box, shown in Figure 15-1, appears.
2. Using the drop-down list, set the Units box to Pixels.
3. Change Width to 32.
4. Change Height to 32.
5. Set Resolution to 200 Pixels/cm.
This option is probably already set to this value.
6. Make sure that the Raster Background option is selected.
You want the raster background, rather than the vector background,
because you won’t be using vector graphics (independently manipulated
graphic objects) when you create browser graphics.
7. Set the Color Depth box to 16 Million Colors.
Again, this option is probably already set to this value.
8. Make sure that the Color box is set to white and the Transparent
option is not selected.
Figure 15-1:
The New
Image dialog
box set for a
blank button

148
Part III: Creating Browser Graphics 

The Transparent option specifies an image with no background color.
You want a background color of white, so you want transparency off.
9. Click OK.
Paint Shop Pro creates a blank image for your new button.
10. Save your work.
Choose File➪Save to save your work. If the Save As dialog box appears,
give the image a filename and select the type of image format you want
to use. I suggest that you save your browser graphics in the .jpg format.
Zooming In on the Button
If you followed the steps in the preceding section, your new button ended up
pretty small. A small image like this one can be hard to work with. Luckily,
Paint Shop Pro enables you to magnify the image so that you can better see
what you’re doing with it. To make your new button easier to see and work
with, perform these steps:
1. Click the Pan tool in Paint Shop Pro’s toolbox.
It’s the topmost tool, the one that looks like an arrow mouse cursor.
The tool’s settings appear in Paint Shop Pro’s toolbar, as shown in
Figure 15-2.
2. To zoom by a user-defined amount, type a value into the Zoom box in
the Pan tool’s settings, as shown in Figure 15-3; to zoom a predefined
amount, click either the Zoom By 1 Step or the Zoom By 5 Steps buttons.
If you’re typing a value, keep in mind that this number is a percentage;
values below 100 decrease the magnification, whereas values above 100
increase the magnification.
If you click the 5+ button twice, Paint Shop Pro magnifies your button
image by a factor of ten.
3. Save your work.

tool’s

Chapter 15: Manufacturing Buttons

Filling the Button’s Background
Chances are you’ll want to fill your button’s blank rectangle with some color.
You could stick with the white background, I suppose, but why not go for
broke? Filling the button’s background is as easy as 1,2,3 (plus about five
other steps, but who’s counting?). Here’s how to fill your button’s image:
1. In the toolbox on the left of the window, select the Flood Fill tool.
This tool is the thirteenth one down, and it looks like a tipped paint
bucket.
The Flood Fill tool’s settings appear in Paint Shop Pro’s toolbar.
2. In the Flood Fill tool’s attributes, make sure that Match Mode is set to
RGB Value.
Match Mode determines how the fill function decides which colors to fill.
3. Set Tolerance to 0.
Figure 15-3:
Type a value
into the
Zoom box in
the top-left
corner of
the window.
150
Part III: Creating Browser Graphics 

Tolerance specifies how close a color has to be to the selected color
(the one you click with the fill tool) to be affected by the fill. Higher 
tolerance values cause more colors to be filled.
4. Set Blend Mode to Normal.
This setting specifies that the fill color completely replaces all affected
colors, rather than blend them together in some other way.
5. Set Opacity to 100.
This setting determines how transparent the fill color will be. A setting
of 100 makes the fill opaque.
6. Click inside the foreground color box in the Materials pane, as shown
in Figure 15-4.
The Material dialog box appears.
7. Click the Color tab and then click the color you want.
The R, G, and B values should change to the red, green, and blue values
that combine to make your chosen color.
8. Make sure that the Texture option is not selected.
You don’t want your fill color to have a texture pattern.
9. Click OK.
The foreground color changes to the color you chose in Step 7.
10. Place the tool over the image and click.
Paint Shop Pro fills the image with your chosen color.
11. Save your work.
If you want your button to seem to blend in to your toolbar, use the same color
you chose for your toolbar’s background. Of course, this tip only works if your
toolbar has a solid background — that is, the toolbar hasn’t been overlaid with
other images, textures, or patterns.

Chapter 15: Manufacturing Buttons

Adding a 3-D Effect
In most cases, you want your button to look flat. This is because the browser
that the Browser Construction Kit creates automatically makes the button
image 3-D when the user’s mouse cursor passes over it. This 3-D effect is
subtle, though, so if you want, you can create cool, 3-D buttons that look 
3-D all the time. Follow these steps to accomplish this task:
1. Choose Effects➪3D Effects➪Buttonize.
The Buttonize dialog box appears.
2. Change the Height setting to 5.
This setting specifies a button with a 5-pixel [LB1]top and bottom border.
You can adjust the amount of the 3-D effect applied to your image by
changing the Height and Width settings in the Buttonize dialog box.
These settings control the size of the button’s 3-D edge.
3. Change the Width setting to 5.
This setting specifies a button with a 5-pixel left and right border.
4. Select the Transparent edge.
A transparent edge looks more realistic because of the way it blends the
button’s colors.
5. Select an Opacity of 75.
This setting specifies the amount of transparency applied to a transpar-
ent edge (see Step 4).
Figure 15-5 shows these settings.
Figure 15-5:
The
Buttonize
settings.
152
Part III: Creating Browser Graphics 

6. Click OK.
Paint Shop Pro applies the effect, giving you the button shown in
Figure 15-6.
Because the button you created is magnified ten times, the 3-D effect
doesn’t seem as effective. If you press Ctrl+Alt+N, the button returns to
its normal size, so you can see what it really looks like. Before moving
on to the next section, though, magnify the button again.
7. Save your work.
Adding an Image to Your Button
A blank button, even if it does have a cool 3-D effect, doesn’t help you much,
because the user has no way of knowing what the button does. To give the
user a clue, you need to add an icon to the button’s surface. Here’s how you
can create a Favorites button for your toolbar:
1. Create a new 28 x 28 image.
See the “Starting a New Button” section for more information on how to
start a new image.
2. Select the Transparent option.
You want to select the transparent option because you don’t want the
image to have a background color.
3. Select the Pan tool and, in the Pan tool’s settings, click the 5+ button
twice.
The image magnifies to ten times its normal size, as shown in Fig-
ure 15-6.
Figure 15-6:
The new

4. Select the Preset Shape tool.
This tool is the third one from the bottom — the one that looks like an
oval on top of a rectangle — in Paint Shop Pro’s toolbox.
The tool’s settings appear in Paint Shop Pro’s toolbar (see Figure 15-7).
5. In the shape list, select the Star 2 shape, as shown in Figure 15-8.
The Star 2 shape appears in the tool’s settings.
6. In the Materials pane, set the foreground color to black and the fill
color (the other color box on the right side of the Materials pane) to
yellow.
If you need help setting colors, please refer to Step 6 of the “Filling the
Button’s Background” section.

7. Place your mouse cursor in the image’s upper-left corner, hold down
the left mouse button, and drag the mouse to draw a star that fills the
image’s rectangle, as shown in Figure 15-9.
8. Choose Selections➪Select All to select the entire 28 x 28 image.
You can also press Ctrl+A. Paint Shop Pro surrounds the image with an
animated dashed line (see Figure 15-10), indicating that the image is
selected.
9. Choose Edit➪Copy to copy the image to the Clipboard.
You can also press Ctrl+C.
10. Click your 3-D button’s title bar to select its window.
11. Paste the star into the button’s window and move your mouse to posi-
tion it in the center of the button.
You can quickly paste the image by pressing Ctrl+E. The star appears on
the button, as shown in Figure 15-11.

Chapter 16
Producing Icons
In This Chapter
 Understanding icon editors
 Discovering the icon attributes
 Creating an icon
You can place icons in your custom browser in only two places: the win-
dow’s title bar and status bar. While the icon in the status bar is optional,
the main window has to have an icon. In fact, when you start a new custom
browser, the default icon is already assigned to the window. The default icon
looks like a globe, but you can replace it with anything you want. In this chap-
ter, you find out how to create your own icons.
Getting an Icon Editor
Icons are different from other types of graphics. In fact, you can’t even make
them with Paint Shop Pro. You need a special icon editor. I use something
called IconEdit32, shown in Figure 16-1. This great icon editor is a utility pub-
lished in PC Magazine, and it’s available for download from many different
Web sites. Just hop onto your favorite Internet search engine and search for
IconEdit32.
IconEdit32 features many of the same tools that most paint programs have,
as well as commands that make creating icons easier. The program comes
with a Help file that tells you everything you need to know to get the most
out of the program, but you get a quick introduction in this chapter.

Understanding Icon Requirements
Icons may be different in many ways from the other graphics you use with
your browsers, but they still have a set of attributes of which you must be
aware. Although there are many types of icons, the ones you can add to your
browser’s title bar and status bar have the following requirements:
 Width of 16 pixels
 Height of 16 pixels
 256 colors (8-bit color)
Starting a New Icon
One way icons differ from other types of graphics is that you can have more
than one icon in a single icon file. When you first load IconEdit32, it’ll be set
up to create a 256-color, 32 x 32 icon, as you can tell by the asterisk next to
that icon type on the right side of the editor’s window.
You want to create a 256-color, 16 x 16 icon, so you need to click the correct
icon type in the editor’s window. When you do, an asterisk appears next to
the icon type. The asterisk next to the 32 x 32 icon, however, doesn’t go away,
telling you that your icon file now contains both 32 x 32 and 16 x 16 icons. To
get rid of the 32 x 32 icon, right-click its asterisk and choose the Delete 32 x
32 – 256 Color Image command from the menu that appears, as shown in
Figure 16-2. The icon disappears.
Figure 16-1:
The

158
Part III: Creating Browser Graphics 

Making an Icon from Scratch
IconEdit32 contains all the tools you need to create your custom icons. Sup-
pose, for example, that you want to make a smiley-face icon. Here’s how:
1. Start a new 16 x 16, 256-color icon.
(See the preceding section if you’re not sure how to do so.) The icon
editor displays a 16 x 16 grid in its work area, as shown in Figure 16-3.
2. Select the Hollow Ellipse tool, which is the ninth tool down on the left
side of the editor’s window.
This tool enables you to draw the outlines of circles and ellipses.
3. In the color boxes at the bottom of the editor’s window, choose the
color black.
The selected color appears in the foreground color indicator in the
lower-left corner of the window.
Figure 16-2:

4. Place the mouse cursor in the center of the work-area grid, hold down
the left mouse button, and drag the mouse until you’ve produced a
circle that just fits in the work area.
Figure 16-4 shows the new circle in the icon grid.

5. Select the Fill tool, which is the fifth tool down (the one that looks like
a tipped paint bucket) on the left side of the editor’s window.
6. Select a shade of yellow from the color boxes at the bottom of the
window.
The foreground color indicator turns yellow.
7. Place the mouse cursor inside the hollow circle and click.
The editor fills the circle with yellow (see Figure 16-5).
8. Select the Pen tool, which is the first tool on the left side of the
editor’s window.
You use this tool to draw in the icon’s work area.
9. Select the color green from the color selector.
10. Click in the appropriate grid locations to create the eyes, nose, and
mouth, as shown in Figure 16-6.
Each time you click, the editor fills the clicked box with the color green.
11. Choose File➪Save.

Chapter 16: Producing Icons

Making an Icon from an Existing Image
Even though icons are a special graphical format, there’s no reason you can’t
use graphics in other formats to create your icon. If, for example, you have a
16 x 16 bitmap that you want to use as an icon, IconEdit32 can do the conver-
sion for you. Perform the following steps to see how this works:
1. Start a new 16 x 16, 256-color icon.
(Refer to the section “Starting a New Icon” if you need detailed instruc-
tions.) The icon editor displays a 16 x 16 grid in its work area.
2. Load the 16 x 16 source image (the image you want to use as an icon)
into a paint program, such as Paint Shop Pro (see Figure 16-7).
3. Choose Selections➪Select All to select the entire image.
You can also use the Ctrl+A keystroke.
4. Choose Edit➪Copy to copy the image to the Clipboard.
You can also use the Ctrl+C keystroke.
5. Switch to IconEdit32 and choose Edit➪Paste, or just press Ctrl+V.
The 16 x 16 image appears in IconEdit32’s work area, as shown in Fig-
ure 16-8.
6. In IconEdit32, choose File➪Save to save the new icon under an appro-
priate name.

Controlling the
Behavior of the
Browser 

In this part . . .
Your custom browser can include features you won’t
find in most other browsers. These features include a
timer, an approved-sites list, a password manager, and a
“screen spy,” which takes automatic screen shots as the
browser runs. Some of these special features provide a
safer way for those youngun’s to explore the Web. Other
special features are simply handy. In this part, you also
explore the script file that the browser editor generates.
The browser compiler uses this script file to create the
browser you designed.

Chapter 17
Controlling Access 
to Internet Sites
In This Chapter
 Working with the Internet alarm
 Using the approved-sites list
 Adding and deleting Web addresses to the approved-sites list
P
arents who want to safeguard their kids against the dark side of the
Internet rejoice! (Kids, on the other hand, commence to sulk.) The
Browser Construction Kit offers a couple of ways for you to watch your kids
and limit their access to certain Web sites. In this chapter, you find out how
to use these safety features.
Using the Internet Alarm
For some kids, being on the Internet is a lot like playing a video game. Once
they get started, they don’t want to stop. Many parents limit the amount of
time their offspring can sit in front of the Nintendo, and so, too, do some par-
ents control the amount of time their kids use the Internet — except in the
case of legitimate school research, of course!
One way the Browser Construction Kit keeps your kids on the straight and
narrow is with the Internet alarm. Working just like the timer on your oven,
you can set the Internet alarm to sound after a specific amount of time. This
alarm can be audible, or it can be a message that appears, followed by the
shutdown of the Browser — until you reset the timer.
To access the Internet alarm from your custom browser:
1. Choose Tools➪Alarms, as shown in Figure 17-1.
The Password box appears.

In order to access these two commands, you must add both the Tools
menu and the Alarms command to your menu bar when you construct
your custom browser. You cannot add or delete menus once your
browser has been constructed except by using the browser editor to
make changes and then recompiling the browser. (See Chapter 7 for
more information on menus.)
2. Type your password.
3. Click OK.
The Alarms dialog box, shown in Figure 17-2, appears.
Figure 17-2:
The Alarms
dialog box.
Figure 17-1:
The Alarms
command.
168
Part IV: Controlling the Behavior of the Browser 

4. In the Number Of Minutes To Next Alarm box, type the number of
minutes you want to elapse before the alarm is triggered.
If, for example, you want the alarm to go off in an hour, type 60 into 
the box.
5. In the Alarm Options area, select one or both of the Audible Alarm
and Popup Alarm options.
You have to select at least one of the Audible Alarm or Popup Alarm
options. Otherwise, you have no alarm at all. The audible alarm plays 
a sound through your computer’s audio system, whereas the popup
alarm just displays a small window.
6. If you want the browser to stop working at the end of the allotted
time, select the Disable Browser option.
You can re-enable the browser by setting a new alarm or by turning off
the alarm feature.
7. Click OK to finalize your selections and to start the alarm timer.
If you change your mind, you can click Cancel instead of OK to return to
the browser without setting an alarm.
If you have the Timer panel included in your browser’s status bar (assuming
the browser even has a status bar, which is not a requirement), the browser
displays the amount of time elapsed, as shown in Figure 17-3.
Figure 17-3:
A timer 
in the
browser’s
status bar.
169
Chapter 17: Controlling Access to Internet Sites

For the status bar’s countdown timer to work, you not only have to have the
Timer panel included in the status bar, it must also be set as a countdown
timer. You can set this timer attribute when you’re designing your custom
browser in the editor or by right-clicking the Timer panel and choosing a new
setting from the Timer dialog box, shown in Figure 17-4. (Please see Chapter
18 for more information on timers.)
Setting Up an Approved-Sites List
The browser you create using the Browser Construction Kit can limit Internet
access to only those sites that you’ve preapproved. You set this limitation
with the approved-sites list. Normally, you add an approved-sites list to your
browser as you’re creating the browser in the browser editor. However,
because you’re likely to need to update the approved-sites list often, the
browser itself gives you full access to the approved-sites list function.
To access the approved-sites list:
1. Choose Tools➪Approved Sites.
In order to have access to the Tools menu’s Approved Sites command,
you must add the Tools Approved Sites commands to your menu bar
when you construct your custom browser. You cannot add or delete
menus once your browser has been constructed, except by using the
browser editor to make changes and then recompiling the browser.
2. When the Password box appears, type your password and click OK.
The Approved Sites dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 17-5.

dialog box.

Part IV: Controlling the Behavior of the Browser 

3. To add new entries to the approved-sites list, type the Web site’s URL
into the Enter URL box and then click Add.
The URL appears in the list above the buttons. The Web addresses in the
list are the only ones that the browser can access.
4. To remove an entry from the list, select the entry and then click Delete.
You can remove all the entries with a single button by clicking Delete All.

Incorporating Passwords and
Tracking Time Online
In This Chapter
 Setting and recovering passwords
 Changing the timer type
 Associating an alarm with a timer
Your custom browser can use one of three types of timers. You can use
these timers just to keep track of how long you’ve been online, or you can
associate the timer with the Internet alarm (see Chapter 17 for more informa-
tion on alarms) and so control how long the browser stays active. All these
special features are password-protected, so that only you can change their set-
tings. In this chapter, you find out about the password and timer features.
Using the Password System
Obviously, if you’re using the special custom-browser functions to keep an
eye on your kids (or your parents!), you don’t want anyone messing around
with your settings. For this reason, you can password-protect sensitive set-
tings such as timers and alarms.
When you first run your new browser, it uses a default password of “browser.”
How creative, huh? The first thing you want to do is to change the password to
something else. To change your password:
1. Choose Tools➪Password.
The Password Change dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 18-1.
In order to have access to the Tools menu’s Password command, you
must add the Tools menu to your menu bar. You don’t need to add the
Password command. The browser does that automatically, as long as
you have the Tools menu in place.

2. Type the current password into the Current Password box.
3. Type the new password into both the Type New Password and Retype
New Password boxes.
Why twice? Because I think you need practice typing. Or maybe the pro-
gram just wants to make sure that you didn’t mistype the new password
the first time. This check is important because you can’t see the pass-
word as you type, just a line of asterisks. You don’t want someone look-
ing over your shoulder and discovering the password as you type, do
you? (If you answered “yes” to this question, I’m guessing you have a lot
to learn about computer security!)
4. Click OK.
You now have a new password.
Recovering Your Password
So, what if you forget your password? Unfortunately, the only solution to this
dilemma is to burn your computer (for security purposes) and buy a new
one. Just kidding. There is a sneaky way to find or change your password, but
you have to edit your system Registry to do it, something that you may not
be too anxious to do, because editing the wrong thing could really mess up
your computer.
If you’re careful, though, you can search your Registry enough to recover a for-
gotten password. Just make sure that this information doesn’t get into the
wrong hands! In fact, after you read this section, you may want to obliterate
these paragraphs with an indelible black marker. Just kidding again. Sort of . . . .
Here’s how to recover your password from the Registry:
1. Choose Start➪Run, as shown in Figure 18-2.
The Run dialog box appears.

Using Timers
Your custom browser can display one of three types of timers. Here’s what
they are:
 Session Timer: Starts counting the time as soon as the browser goes
online and starts over each time the browser is loaded.
 Daily Timer: Keeps track of the time spent online in each 24-hour
period. Starts over at midnight.
 Countdown Timer: Counts down to zero from a specified value.
The timer display lives in the browser’s status bar. This means that, if you
want to use the timer, you must add a status bar when you design your
browser in the browser editor. You can add the timer panel to the status bar
both in the editor and in the final browser.
Setting the timer options
Although you can choose the type of timer you want to use when you’re
designing your custom browser, you can also set the timer type from the
browser itself. To do so, just right-click the timer’s panel in the status bar.
When you do, the Timer dialog box appears (see Figure 18-8). The Show
Timer Panel option controls whether the timer appears in the status bar. 
The Timer Type area is where you set the type of timer you want to use. 
Click OK to finalize your choices or click Cancel to leave the timer settings 
as they were before you displayed the Timer dialog box.

Part IV: Controlling the Behavior of the Browser 

Associating an alarm with 
the countdown timer
The countdown timer can be connected to the Internet alarm feature, which
can ring an audible alarm, show a popup alarm, or disable the Web browser
from further use.
To access the Internet alarm from your custom browser:
1. Choose Tools➪Alarms.
The Password box appears.
2. Type your password.
3. Click OK.
The Alarms dialog box, shown in Figure 18-9, appears. Enabling the
alarm automatically associates the alarm with the countdown timer.
That is, the alarm goes off when the countdown timer reaches zero.
Please refer to Chapter 17 for more information about alarms.

A
lthough the browser you create with the Browser Construction Kit fea-
tures safety features like alarms and an approved-sites list, sometimes
you want the browser’s user to have more freedom than such safety features
allow. One way to arrange for this possibility is to keep an automatic list of
sites visited, as well as to take pictures of the screen at given intervals. Then
you can see what the browser’s user has been up to, yet the user still has
complete freedom to explore the Internet. In this chapter, you explore these
important “spy” features.
Generating Web Site Log Files
A Web site log file is a text file containing the Web sites your custom browser
recently visited. You can use this file to ensure that whoever has been using the
browser has not been visiting places on the Web where he or she shouldn’t be.
To use a Web site log file, you need to have added the Log File function when
you designed your browser in the browser editor. You must also have added a
menu bar with the Tools menu. Please refer to Chapter 7 for more information
on menus.

Starting a log file
To start your log file, choose Tools➪Log File. When the Password dialog box
appears, type your password and click OK to display the Log File dialog box,
shown in Figure 19-1. To start a log file, select the Log Visited Sites option. To
stop the log file, turn off the option.
Viewing and deleting a log file
To view your log file, choose Tools➪Log File. When the Password dialog box
appears, type your password and click OK. The Log File dialog box appears.
Click the View Log button and the browser loads the log file into Notepad for
your perusal.
When you’re finished viewing the log file, you can just close the Log File dialog
box, which leaves the log file intact so that you can add other Web addresses.
If you’re completely finished with the log file, click the Delete Log button to
remove the file from your computer. If you delete the log file, but keep the Log
Visited Sites option selected, the browser will start a new log file.
Generating Automatic Screen Captures
The screen-capture function — which takes a screen shot once a minute —
is another way to keep track of how your browser is being used. One by one,
the browser stores the screen shots so that you can view them whenever it’s
convenient.
Figure 19-1:
The Log File
dialog box.
182
Part IV: Controlling the Behavior of the Browser 

To use the screen-capture feature, you must have added the Screen Spy func-
tion when you designed your browser in the browser editor. You must also
have added a menu bar with the Tools menu and have added the Screen Spy
command to the menu. Please refer to Chapter 7 for more information.
Starting screen captures
To start your screen captures, choose Tools➪Screen Spy. When you do, the
Password dialog box appears. Type your password and click OK to display
the Screen Spy dialog box (see Figure 19-2). To start screen captures, select the
Capture Screens option and click OK. To stop the screen capture, turn off the
option and click OK.
Viewing and deleting screen captures
To view your screen captures, choose Tools➪Screen Spy. When the Password
dialog box appears, type your password and click OK. The Screen Spy dialog
box appears. Click the View Screens button. When you do, the Screen Viewer
window appears, as shown in Figure 19-3.
The Screen Viewer enables you to view screens manually one-by-one or using
the built-in three-speed slideshow. When the Screen Viewer first appears, it
loads and displays the first available screen shot. Click the Forward button to
see the next screenshot. You can click the Back button to view the previous
screen shot.
Figure 19-2:
The Screen
Spy dialog
box.
183
Chapter 19: Keeping Track of Visited Sites

To advance through the screens automatically, click the Start Slide Show
button. Control the speed at which the slide show displays the screens by
clicking the Slow, Medium, or Fast button. Click the Stop button to halt the
slide show. You can then continue manually with the Forward and Back but-
tons or turn the slide show back on with the Start Slide Show button.
The larger you make the Screen Viewer window, the better the screen shots
look. Click the window’s Maximize button to increase the viewer to its largest
size in order to view the screen shots at their best (see Figure 19-4).
When you’re finished with the Screen Viewer, you can just close the window
and then also close the Screen Spy dialog box. If you leave the Capture Screens
option selected, the browser continues to add new screen shots to the ones
that already exist. If you want to start fresh, click the Delete Screens button in
the Screen Spy dialog box. The program then deletes all screens that currently
exist. If the Capture Screens option is selected, the browser goes back to cap-
turing screens.
Each screen shot’s filename includes the date and time the capture was taken.
This filename appears at the top of the Screen Viewer window, making it easy
for you to know what was happening with the browser at any given time.

T
he Browser Construction Kit editor doesn’t actually create a browser.
Your browser is created by a compiler that reads a script file, creating
the browser with the components and options you selected. The truth is that,
although it’s a convenient program, you don’t even need the browser editor.
You can create your browser script file by hand. I don’t suggest doing this,
though, because one tiny mistake could make your browser unusable. But
whether you want to experiment with a browser script file or not, you may
want to know more about how it works. That’s what you discover in this
chapter.
What the Editor Does
The Browser Construction Kit’s editor is nothing more than a handy way to
create a browser script file. The editor keeps track of everything you add to
your custom browser, and, when you save your work, takes that information
and creates the browser script file. Another advantage of the editor is that
you can see the results of your settings right away, without having to first
compile the browser.
The editor and the script file do share one important characteristic: the
way the different browser settings are organized. As you probably know, the
browser editor organizes your browser settings into seven groups (shown in
Figure 20-1), each of which is accessed from the list box below the toolbox
buttons. The resultant script file, too, is organized into these seven groups.

The Seven Attribute Groups
Each group of settings starts with a title enclosed in square brackets. The
groups are also organized into a specific order, and both the editor (when
you try to reload a browser in progress) and the compiler (when you try to
compile your browser) expect everything to be exactly in this order: Window
Attributes, Browser Attributes, Toolbar Attributes, Status Bar Attributes,
Menu Bar Attributes, Function Attributes, and Address Bar Attributes. Here’s
what a browser script file looks like, with the details of each section replaced
with vertical ellipses:
[WINDOW ATTRIBUTES]

[MENU BAR ATTRIBUTES]

[FUNCTION ATTRIBUTES]

[ADDRESS BAR ATTRIBUTES]
Attribute Settings
Each attribute group comprises specific settings, also organized into a
strict order. Both the browser editor and the browser compiler expect
these settings in the exact order, and any variation results in anything from
a weird looking browser to a program crash.
The settings included in each section depend on which section you’re
looking at. The types of settings you can expect to find, however, are
listed here:
 Text
 Colors
 Filenames
 Component locations
 Component sizes
 True or False switches
 Web addresses
 Style specifiers
The following sections tell you more about these different types of settings.
189
Chapter 20: Exploring a Browser Script File

The Simplest Script File
Even if you were to load the Browser Construction Kit’s editor and immediately
save the default browser settings — without adding or changing anything —
you’d still get a script file. The following listing shows this default file, which
produces the browser window shown in Figure 20-2.
[WINDOW ATTRIBUTES]
Title = My Internet Explorer
Color = Color [A=255, R=70, G=130, B=180]

190
Part IV: Controlling the Behavior of the Browser 

Alarm = False
Lock = False
ApprovedList = False
ScreenSpy = False
PopularSites = False
[ADDRESS BAR ATTRIBUTES]
AddressBar = False
Notice in the default script file how each component of the browser, except
for the main window, is set to False. That is, if you look at the BROWSER
ATTRIBUTES section, you see this:
[BROWSER ATTRIBUTES]
Browser = False
These lines mean that no browser pane has been added to the browser window.
For that reason, no other settings appear in the BROWSER ATTRIBUTES section.
If you were to add a browser pane, the BROWSER ATTRIBUTES section would
look something like this:
[BROWSER ATTRIBUTES]
Browser = True
Left = 75
Top = 120
Width = 640
Height = 444
BrowserBorder = False
BorderStyle = 0
StartSite = www.wiley.com
The same is true of the TOOLBAR ATTRIBUTES section. Because the default
browser has no toolbar, its section in the script file looks like this:
[TOOLBAR ATTRIBUTES]
Toolbar = False
Look through the default script, and you’ll see that all the components —
browser, toolbar, status bar, menu bar, functions, and address bar — are set
to False.
A Complete Script File
Suppose that you create a complete browser, including most of the available
components, settings, and functions. Such a browser window might look like
Figure 20-3.
191
Chapter 20: Exploring a Browser Script File

The script file for this browser holds a lot more information than the default
script file did, because each browser component must include the settings
needed to create the component in the custom browser’s window. Here’s what
the script file for the browser shown in Figure 20-3 looks like:

cial functions, such as alarms and locks. For the browser you’re examining,
which includes all the special functions, that section looks like this:
[FUNCTION ATTRIBUTES]
LogFile = True
Alarm = True
Lock = True
ApprovedList = True
ScreenSpy = True
PopularSites = True
The following list — you guessed it — describes each setting:
 LogFile: Specifies whether the browser includes the Log File special
function. A setting of True adds the Log File function, whereas a setting
of False removes the Log File function.

A
fter you discover the tools and techniques for creat-
ing custom browsers, I don’t just leave you stranded.
In Part V, I hold your hand through the creation of a set of
interesting, useful, and sometimes just fun custom browser
projects. Step-by-step instructions tell you everything you
need to know to not only create a custom browser, but also
how to use browsers in tricky ways. Here, you build seven
custom browsers in all.

I
n spite of all the cool things the Browser Construction Kit can do, it makes
sense to start off this book’s example projects with a general-use browser.
By general use, I mean a browser that includes no special features and that
serves as a basic tool for browsing the Internet.
Like the other chapters in this section of the book, this chapter comprises
step-by-step instructions for building a specific custom Web browser. If you
follow the steps in this chapter, you end up with a handy general-use Web
browser.
Creating the Window
The window you create for this custom browser is what you might call plain
vanilla. That is, it doesn’t show off with any fancy graphics or extras. Perform
the following steps to design the general-use browser’s window:
1. In the drop-down list below the toolbox, select the Window com-
mand set.
The Window commands appear in the toolbox.
2. Click the Color button.
The Color dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 21-1.

3. Select the color white and click OK.
The window’s background turns white.
4. Click the Icon button.
The Select Window Icon dialog box appears (see Figure 21-2).
5. Locate the icon you want to use and double-click the filename.
Alternatively, you can click the icon file once to select it and then click
the dialog box’s Open button.
Your icon appears in the window’s title bar.
6. Click the Style button.
The Window Styles dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 21-3.

13. Navigate to where you want to save your browser’s script file and
then click Save.
The Browser Construction Kit saves your browser’s data to the selected
location, using the window’s title as the filename.
Adding the Menu Bar
The menu bar for the general-use browser features a full set of menus, com-
mands, and options. Here’s how to put it together:
1. In the drop-down menu below the toolbox, select the Menu Bar com-
mand set.
The Menu Bar commands appear in the toolbox.
2. Click the Menu Bar command in the toolbox.
The menu bar appears in the custom browser window.
3. Select the File button in the toolbox.

location, using the window’s title as the filename.
Adding the Toolbar
A general-use Web browser must have all the navigation commands you need
to make your way through the complex world of the Internet. For that reason,
the toolbar you build here has all the toolbar features the Browser Construction
Kit makes available to you. Just follow these steps to add your toolbar to the
window:
1. In the drop-down menu below the toolbox, select the Toolbar com-
mand set.
The Toolbar commands appear in the toolbox.

Adding the Browser Pane
You can’t have a browser without a browser pane. Well, you can if you’ve got
one of those new psychic browsers that project the Web pages directly into
your brain. (I know they exist, because I ordered one from a spam e-mail I got
a few weeks ago. Funny that it hasn’t been delivered yet, though.) Anyway,
here’s how to add a browser pane to your general-use browser:
1. In the drop-down menu below the toolbox, select the Browser com-
mand set.
The Browser commands appear in the toolbox.
2. Click the Browser button.
The browser pane appears in your browser’s window (see Figure 21-17).
3. Click the Top command in the toolbox.
The Browser Top dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 21-18.

I
’m guessing that the most popular use of the Browser Construction Kit will
be to create kid-safe browsers. Such a browser can protect children from
the many not-so-nice Web sites on the Internet, and so enable parents to feel
more relaxed about unleashing their children into the Web, whether for fun,
for research, or just for exploring for an hour or so.
The browser you build in this chapter not only is graphically attractive to
children, but also includes special features such as an approved-sites list and
a browser alarm. If you want to build a kid-safe browser, then just load up your
Browser Construction Kit and complete the following steps.
Creating the Window
Every browser design starts with a window. If you’ve been using the Browser
Construction Kit at all, you already know that the Window category of com-
mands enable you to set window attributes such as title, type, color, border,
and so on. Each specific browser’s design utilizes these attributes to create a
window that best suits the project’s theme. The following steps get you started

on a child’s browser. You can find the graphics you need on this book’s CD-ROM
or in the folder into which you installed the program.
1. In the drop-down list below the toolbox, select the Window com-
mand set.
The Window commands appear in the toolbox.
2. Click the Color button.
The Color dialog box appears (see Figure 22-1).
3. Select the light purple color and click OK.
The window’s background turns light purple.
4. Click the Icon button.
The Select Window Icon dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 22-2.

5. Double-click the Kids.ico file on your Browser Construction Kit
CD-ROM.
The kid’s icon appears in the window’s title bar.
6. Click the Style button.
The Window Styles dialog box appears (see Figure 22-3).
7. Select the Normal Unsizable option and click OK.
The window’s border style changes. (The change is subtle. You may not
even notice it.)
8. Click the Buttons command in the toolbox.
The Window Buttons dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 22-4.
9. Turn off the Minimize Button and Maximize Button options and then
click OK.
The Browser Construction Kit removes the Minimize and Maximize but-
tons from the window.
10. Click the Title button.
The Window Title dialog box appears (see Figure 22-5).

Adding the Menu Bar
A menu bar is an important part of most applications. With a kid’s browser,
though, you only want to include the commands that a child is likely to need
and use. Limiting the available command set helps keep the child from run-
ning into trouble. The following steps describe how to add a menu bar to the
child’s browser:
1. In the drop-down list below the toolbox, select the Menu Bar com-
mand set.
The Menu Bar commands appear in the toolbox.
2. Click the Menu Bar command in the toolbox.
The menu bar appears in the custom browser window.

The Help menu appears in your kid-browser window (see Figure 22-9).
10. Choose File➪Save.
The Browser Construction Kit saves your browser’s data.
Adding the Toolbar
Your menu bar may be the most important spot to place commands, but the
toolbar is the most convenient place for the user to access frequently used
commands. The child’s browser needs a basic set of browsing commands in
the toolbar so that the child can easily navigate from one Web page to another.
Perform the following steps to add a toolbar to your kid browser:

Adding the Address Bar
Web pages feature links that you can click to get to a specific place on the
Internet, but you frequently need to get to places that don’t have such conve-
nient links. As you know, you get to such Web sites by typing their addresses
into the browser’s address bar. The following steps guide you through the
process of adding an address bar to the kids’ browser:

Adding the Browser Pane
The most important part of a Web browser is, of course, the area of the window
that shows the Web pages. All the fancy controls, commands, and features
in the world won’t do you any good if you can’t see where you’re going. You
wouldn’t want to drive a car with an opaque windshield, would you? (If you
have to think about this question, please turn in your driver’s license.) In the
following steps, you add the all-important browser pane to the kids’ browser:
1. In the drop-down list below the toolbox, select the Browser com-
mand set.
The Browser commands appear in the toolbox.
2. Click the Browser button.
The browser pane appears in your browser’s window.

Adding Child Safety Features
Although one of the main characteristics of the kids’ Web browser is its sim-
plistic controls, the real heart of the machine is its safety features, which
give you the power to protect your child from the many nasty places on the
Internet. Specifically, the kids’ browser features an approved-sites list that
prevents your child from going anywhere on the Internet that you haven’t
already checked out. Here’s how to add this feature:
1. In the drop-down list below the toolbox, select the Functions com-
mand set.
The Functions commands appear in the toolbox.
2. Click the Alarm button.
The alarm function’s icon appears below the kid-browser window.
3. Click the Approved Lists command in the toolbox.
The approved list function’s icon appears below the kid-browser window
(see Figure 22-17).

Compiling the Custom Browser
The last step in building any browser is compiling it into a program that you
can actually use. It’d be pretty dumb to go through all this work and then do
nothing more than look at your browser’s design in the editor. At least, I think
that’d be kind of dumb, so I assume you would, too. Here’s how to compile
your final kids’ browser:
1. Choose File➪Build Browser.
The Build Browser dialog box appears.
2. Navigate to where you want to save your browser’s finished files and
then click OK.
The Browser Construction Kit builds the final files for your custom
browser.
To run your finished browser, double-click the Browser.exe file, located in the
directory to which you built the browser.

E
verybody has some sort of special interest. Maybe you’re into cars. Or
maybe it’s baseball that cranks you up. Me, I dig music. Whatever makes
you smile, wouldn’t it be cool to have a Web browser that reflects that interest?
In this chapter, you see how to use the Browser Construction Kit to create what
I like to call a special-topic browser. In this case, the browser you create is per-
fect for anyone who likes gardening or plants. However, feel free to substitute
other images.
You can find the images used in this chapter in the Themes/Gardening folder
of this book’s CD-ROM or in the folder into which you installed the program.
Creating the Window
The browser’s window offers an opportunity for designing an attractive
layout that includes special-interest images. By special-interest images, I
mean graphical items that work together to form a theme — a theme that
fits with a person’s interest, whether that be sports, music, electronics, or

whatever. In this chapter, the theme is gardening. The following steps show
how to design this special browser’s window:
1. In the drop-down list below the toolbox, select the Window com-
mand set.
The Window commands appear in the toolbox.
2. Click the Icon button.
The Select Window Icon dialog box appears.
3. Double-click the Garden.ico file on your Browser Construction Kit
CD-ROM.
The garden-theme icon appears in the window’s title bar, as shown in
Figure 23-1.
4. Click the Style button.
The Window Styles dialog box appears.
5. Select the Normal Unsizable option and click OK.
The window’s border style changes. (The change is so subtle that you
may not even notice it.)
6. Click the Buttons command in the toolbox.
The Window Buttons dialog box appears.
7. Turn off the Minimize Button and Maximize Button options and then
click OK.

Adding the Menu Bar
The Browser Construction Kit doesn’t let you use custom graphics for you
browser’s menu bar, but that doesn’t mean that the garden-themed browser
will do without one. Here’s how to add a menu bar to this themed browser’s
window:
1. In the drop-down list below the toolbox, select the Menu Bar com-
mand set.
The Menu Bar commands appear in the toolbox (see Figure 23-6).
2. Click the Menu Bar command in the toolbox.

Adding the Toolbar
Just as with the main window’s border and background, you can choose your
own custom image as the background for the window’s toolbar. This ability is,
of course, another opportunity for you to create a cohesive theme of graphical
elements. The follow steps guide you as you put together the garden-themed
browser’s toolbar.
1. In the drop-down list below the toolbox, select the Toolbar command set.
The Toolbar commands appear in the toolbox, as shown in Figure 23-9.
2. Click the Toolbar button.

Adding the Status Bar
Your browser’s status bar, too, can include images that help develop a special
theme. The theme may be just a matter of complementary colors or full-fledged,
photographic images. The choice is yours. In this section, you design the
garden-themed browser’s status bar:

Chapter 23: Designing a Special-Topic Browser

Adding the Address Bar
Your browser’s address bar is exactly the same size as the status bar, which
means that you can use the same image for both, or you can design different
images. Often, for the sake of the design, it’s good to use the same image in
both bars, and so keep the theme from becoming too cluttered. That’s what
you do when you add an address bar in this section. Even though the image
you use is named Gardening_Address_Bar, it’s exactly the same as the status
bar. Perform the following steps to add the address bar to your browser:
1. In the drop-down list below the toolbox, select the Address Bar com-
mand set.
The Address Bar commands appear in the toolbox (see Figure 23-15).
2. Click the Address Bar button.

Adding the Browser Pane
Because the browser pane must display the current Web page, you can’t do
much to match it to your theme. You can, however, add one of a few different
predefined borders, as well as position the browser pane such that different
parts of the window’s borders and background show. However you choose to
add your browser pane, here’s the basic procedure:

Browser
In This Chapter
 Creating a dedicated-site browser window
 Adding a dedicated-site toolbar, status bar, and menu bar
 Positioning the browser pane
 Compiling the dedicated-site browser
A
dedicated-site browser displays only a single Web site. That is, the user
is not allowed to browse to any other site on the Internet, although he
or she can browse to different pages in the allowed Web site. When might you
want to use such a limited browser? Maybe you have a small bookstore, and
you’ve got information, such as an inventory list, about your store online.
A dedicated-site browser provides your customers with access to your Web
site, without the customers being able to use the browser for anything except
viewing your site. In this chapter, you find out how to build the dedicated-site
Web browser.
You can find the graphics for this project in the Themes/Dedicated folder
of this book’s CD-ROM or in the folder to which you installed the Browser
Construction Kit.
Creating the Window
As always, the first thing you do to start a new browser design is to set up the
browser’s window. In this case, there’s not anything special about the window,
as it uses a fairly standard look and set of commands. Here’s how to create
the browser’s window:
1. In the drop-down list below the toolbox, select the Window com-
mand set.
The Window commands appear in the toolbox.

2. Click the Color button.
The Color dialog box appears.
3. Select the white color and click OK.

T
hose kids! They always seem to find so many ways to get into trouble,
don’t they? The last thing you need to worry about is what they’re doing
on the Internet. This is where a spy browser comes in. Using the Browser
Construction Kit, you can create a browser that not only tracks the sites your
kids access, but also takes periodic screen shots. Now you can see exactly
what the tikes are up to. You’ll be amazed at how well kids behave when they
know that inappropriate behavior will be caught on film. In this chapter, you
build a browser that helps keep your kids’ Internet experience on the straight
and narrow, while still allowing free access to all that the Internet has to offer.
You can find the images for this project in the Themes/Spy folder of this book’s
CD-ROM or in the folder into which you installed the Browser Construction Kit.
Creating the Window
The spy browser looks pretty normal to the untrained eye. Actually, because
all the spy functions operate in the background, the spy browser even looks
normal to the trained eye. The point is that there’s nothing special about its
window, as you will see as you perform the following tasks:
1. In the drop-down list below the toolbox, select the Window com-
mand set.
The Window commands appear in the toolbox.
2. Click the Color button.
The Color dialog box appears.

Adding the Menu Bar
The spy browser features a complete set of menus and commands. After all,
you’re not trying to limit what someone can do with the browser; you just
want to keep an eye on them while they do it. (Insert evil chuckle here.) So,
perform the following steps to add a full-featured menu bar to the browser:
1. In the drop-down list below the toolbox, select the Menu Bar com-
mand set.
The Menu Bar commands appear in the toolbox (see Figure 25-4).
2. Click the Menu Bar command in the toolbox.
The menu bar appears in the custom browser window.
3. Click the File button in the toolbox.

P
ublic libraries these days typically provide Internet access to their
patrons. Although free-speech issues generally prevent libraries from fil-
tering Web content, a library has a perfect right to keep a log of Web usage.
Moreover, nothing says that a library’s Web browser can’t be designed with
graphical elements that fit the browser’s purpose, namely books and research.
In this chapter, you create a library browser that incorporates these ideas.
Creating the Window
The window for the library-themed browser features special graphics that
bring to mind a library-like environment, including a background and special
icon. Perform the following steps to create your browser’s window:
1. In the drop-down list below the toolbox, select the Window com-
mand set.
The Window commands appear in the toolbox.
2. Click the Color button.
The Color dialog box appears.
3. Select the color white and click OK.
The window’s background turns white.
4. Click the Icon button.

aking a custom browser with the Browser Construction Kit is so easy
that you can afford to waste a little time doing crazy stuff. For example,
how about creating a browser whose buttons don’t do the expected thing,
as well as a window that’s so confusing, your victim may never figure it out?
That’s the idea behind the April Fool’s browser, which you put together in
this chapter.
Creating the Window
The main window for the April Fool’s browser is unsizable and contains a
special background graphic that looks like a browser window, but really isn’t.
(Chuckle.) Perform the following steps to build this project’s window:
1. In the drop-down list below the toolbox, select the Window com-
mand set.
The Window commands appear in the toolbox.
2. Click the Icon button.
The Select Window Icon dialog box appears.
3. Open the Earth.ico file from this book’s CD-ROM.
Your icon appears in the window’s title bar.

4. Click the Style button.
The Window Styles dialog box appears.
5. Select the Normal Unsizable option (see Figure 27-1) and click OK.
The Browser Construction Kit changes the window style.
6. Click the Buttons command in the toolbox.

Adding the Menu Bar
In a normal browser, the menu bar is home to most of the commands that
the user needs in order to use the browser. In the April Fool’s browser, the
menus remain perplexingly empty. Perform the following steps to add the
menu bar.
1. In the drop-down menu below the toolbox, select the Menu Bar com-
mand set.
The Menu Bar commands appear in the toolbox.
2. Click the Menu Bar command in the toolbox.

browser is compiled, the user won’t be able to get the File menu to do
anything.
5. Use the Edit, View, Favorites, Tools, and Help commands in the tool-
box to add the menus to the menu bar, the same way you added the
File menu in Steps 3 and 4.
Don’t add any commands to the menus.
Your custom browser now has a complete set of menus, as shown in
Figure 27-6.

The toolbar is home to the commands needed to control the browsing experi-
ence. These controls include the Home, Back, and Refresh buttons, among
others. In the April Fool’s browser, however, the toolbar buttons don’t work
the way the user expects. The following steps get your toolbar installed and
ready to go:
1. In the drop-down menu below the toolbox, select the Toolbar com-
mand set.
The Toolbar commands appear in the toolbox.

Adding the Browser Pane
There’s no way you can do strange things with the browser pane, but you still
have to put one in — otherwise, you don’t have a browser! By adjusting the
size of the browser pane just right, however, you ensure that enough of the
window’s background image remains visible, which makes the window look
as if it’s got a browser inside a browser. That’ll confuse just about anybody!
Perform these steps to add the browser pane:
1. In the drop-down list below the toolbox, select the Browser com-
mand set.
The Browser commands appear in the toolbox.
2. Click the Browser button.
The browser pane appears in your browser’s window (see Figure 27-15).

offers another set of browser ideas, complete with the
graphics you need to create them. As in Part V of the book,
step-by-step instructions guide you through the projects,
but this time the instructions are much more concise,
since you should pretty much be a pro by the time you dig
into this stuff. Finally, also in this part, you discover some
powerful tools to help you create browsers. You also get
pointed in the direction of some excellent informational
resources for everyone interested in programming Internet
Explorer.

 Building extra browsers with graphical themes
 Putting together more traditional browsers
 Creating a quick-and-dirty browser
A
s if you don’t have enough browsers from this book, now I’m going to
give you ten more. (Hey, I want to make sure you get your money’s
worth! Also, once I got started with the Browser Construction Kit, I just
couldn’t tear myself away. It’s fun, dude!)
Anyway, most of the following browsers are similar except that they use
themed graphics. To build a specific browser, find the project’s settings 
(for example, if you want to build the animal-themed browser, get the details
from the following section “The Animal Theme”) and then use the Browser
Construction Kit’s editor to assemble the browser. If you don’t remember
how to do something, refer back to the appropriate section of the book.
The Animal Theme
The first of the ten new browser themes is an animal theme with an African
look (see Figure 29-1). You can find all of the graphics in the Themes/Animal
directory of this book’s CD-ROM or in the subdirectory where you installed
the Browser Construction Kit. Use the following settings in the browser
editor to create the browser:
Window Settings:
 Icon: Animal.ico
 Style: Normal Unsizable

 Buttons: No Minimize or Maximize button
 Border: Animal_Border.jpg
 Skin: Animal_Background.jpg

second of this chapter’s ten new browsers features an art theme (see Figure
29-2). You can find all the graphics in the Themes/Art directory of this book’s
CD-ROM or in the subdirectory where you installed the Browser Construction
Kit. Use the following settings in the browser editor to create the browser:

The Browse-Only Browser
Did you ever play that game in the car where you just keep driving, nowhere
in particular, just taking new roads to see where you end up? You can do the
same thing with the Browse-Only browser, which has no controls at all,
except for whatever links appear in the browser panel (see Figure 29-7). All
the graphics for this project live in the Themes\Browse-Only directory of this
book’s CD-ROM or in the subdirectory where you installed the Browser
Construction Kit. Here are the settings to create the browser:

The Minimal Browser
Sometimes you get overwhelmed with all the stuff they cram into software
these days. Whatever happened to the KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) principle
of design? If you’re a fan of KISS (the design theory, not the rock group),
you’ll love this quick-and-dirty browser design (see Figure 29-9). All the
graphics for this project are in the Themes/Minimal directory of this book’s
CD-ROM or in the subdirectory where you installed the Browser Construction
Kit. Use the following settings to create the browser:

The Dream Browser
What’s the dream browser? The perfect browser for you, of course.
Unfortunately, I can’t possibly know what you’d include in your dream
browser, so you’ll have to fill in the settings for this tenth and final browser
yourself. No whining. I’ve told you everything you need to know to use the
Browser Construction Kit. Anyway, because this is almost the end of the
book, don’t you think it’s about time that I turned the Browser Construction
Kit over to you? Yeah, I thought so.

Ten Tools and Resources for 
Web Browser Builders
In This Chapter
 Exploring graphical tools
 Discovering programming tools
 Finding programming instructions
 Updating your computer for security
T
his book includes everything you need to get started with Internet Explorer
customization. However, you can always expand your horizons — and your
custom browsers — with new tools and techniques. Such tools include graph-
ics editors and programming languages. In this chapter, you discover ten ways
you can add to your custom browser arsenal of software and documentation.
Microsoft Paint
Although this book comes with a trial version of Paint Shop Pro, to keep using
that software, you’re going to have to shell out some dough. The truth is,
though, that you don’t need such a fancy software package to create browser
graphics. Sure, all those extra features provide a computer-full of graphical
power, but if you just want to get the job done, quick and easy, you already
have all the software you need installed with Windows. Specifically, I’m refer-
ring to Microsoft Paint, which features all the basic tools for creating images.
You can find Paint in your Programs menu, inside the Accessories folder.
Clicking Paint’s entry in your Start menu brings up its main window. Paint fea-
tures a small toolbox with tools that can do everything from select parts of a
drawing to draw shapes, erase areas, fill shapes with color, and even add

text. Paint also has a few special features — such as Flip, Stretch, and Skew —
that manipulate your images in handy ways.
ImageForge
If you want more graphics power than that offered by Paint, but don’t want to
mortgage your house for it, you may want to give ImageForge a try. The basic
version of this handy graphics editing package is free (yes, free!), but the
company also has a Pro version that you can buy at a reasonable price
($28.95) if you want extra features.
To try ImageForge, you must first download it. Point your browser to
www.cursorarts.com/ca_imffw.html, which is the Cursor Arts (the pub-
lisher) Web page from which you can download the free version. After
installing the software, you’ll have a Cursor Arts entry in your Programs
menu. Click the ImageForge command in the menu to run the program.
Adobe Photoshop
If you want to go way off the deep end and get one of the best paint programs
available, you could do a whole lot worse than Adobe Photoshop. The full
version of this fabulous package goes for $650! Luckily, you can download a
trial version from Adobe’s Web site. Just point your browser (your custom
browser, of course) to www.adobe.com/products/tryadobe/main.jsp#
product=39. The trial version runs for a month, after which you must pur-
chase the full package to keep using it.
Photoshop does just about anything possible for a paint program to do. Once
you have this puppy on your machine, you’ll be set for life (well, a couple of
years, anyway, which is a lifetime in terms of computer technology). Plan to
spend a whole lot of time learning its intricacies, though. Photoshop is one
serious piece of software.
Microsoft Visual Basic .NET
I wrote the Browser Construction Kit — both the editor and the creator —
using Visual Basic .NET. Moreover, the complete source code for the pro-
grams is included on this book’s CD. In case you haven’t figured out where
I’m going with this, it means that you can modify the program to suit your
needs. To do so, however, you need a copy of Visual Basic .NET.
340
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Visual Basic .NET is one of the languages included with Visual Studio .NET. As
such, you can buy a version of Visual Studio .NET with just Visual Basic, or
you can buy other languages as well, including Visual C++ .NET and Visual 
C# .NET.
Visual Basic .NET For Dummies
Visual Basic .NET won’t do you much good unless you know how to program
with it. Luckily, a For Dummies book can get you started quickly. This book,
aptly titled Visual Basic .NET For Dummies by Wallace Wang, covers everything
from the core language to creating a user interface, programming menus, and
even object-oriented programming. The contents of this book can take you a
long way toward understanding the source code for the Browser
Construction Kit.
MSDN
Another great place to get programming information with regards to anything
related to Visual Studio .NET is Microsoft’s own developer network, usually
referred to as the MSDN. The core programming library for Visual Studio
.NET — a portion of the MSDN — comes with Visual Studio, and you can 
purchase a subscription to have the library and all its updates mailed to 
you four times a year. However, Microsoft makes the entire library, as well 
as tons of other material, available free online. Just point your browser to
msdn.microsoft.com.
Internet Explorer Programming 
Support Center
In addition to MSDN, Microsoft has a large support area online dedicated
specifically to Internet Explorer programming. You can find it at support.
microsoft.com/default.aspx?pr=iep. This Web site provides program-
ming information, but also utilities for managing your IE programming pro-
jects, as well as updates for the IE libraries, and more. They even have
WebCasts that provide a kind of virtual classroom for learning more about IE
programming issues.
341
Chapter 30: Ten Tools and Resources for Web Browser Builders

IEAK
If you’d just as soon avoid programming, then continue using the Browser
Construction Kit as it is. Or you can also try downloading Microsoft’s Internet
Explorer Administration Kit (more commonly know as the IEAK) at www.
microsoft.com/windows/ieak/default.mspx. This handy program doesn’t
let you rebuild IE from scratch, but it does let you customize many of IE’s fea-
tures. This application is great for people who want to create a branded version
of IE — that is, a version of IE that includes a customized setup program, your
own digital certificate, custom logos, a home page, links, and so on.
Your Favorite Internet Search Engine
The Internet is so immense that you can find the answer to just about any
question, including questions about Internet explorer programming. Just
head over to your favorite search site (Google? Yahoo? MSN?), type your
search criteria (for example, “Internet Explorer programming”), and you’re
off. You’ll probably get thousands of hits.
Microsoft Windows Update
You may not think of Windows Update as being a resource for IE program-
ming, but the fact is that many of the fixes that keep your Web browsing safe
come from this Web site. You may have Windows configured to automatically
download critical updates, but if you don’t, you should check this Web site
often to be sure your system has the latest security features. The URL is 
windowsupdate.microsoft.com. Why don’t you jump over there right now?
If you have Windows XP and want to turn on the automatic update feature,
follow these steps:
1. Choose Start➪Control Panel.
The Control Panel appears on your screen. (How the Control Panel looks
varies depending on your system settings and the software you have
installed on your system.)
2. Click Performance and Maintenance.
If you don’t see the Performance and Maintenance category, click the
Switch To Category View command on the left side of the window.
342
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

The Performance and Maintenance window appears.
3. Click the System command near the bottom of the window.
The System Properties dialog box appears.
4. Select the Automatic Updates tab.
The Automatic Updates page appears.
5. Select the Keep My Computer Up To Date option and choose one of the
update settings.
I suggest the Download The Updates Automatically And Notify Me When
They Are Ready To Be Installed setting.
6. Click OK to finalize your choices.

For Windows. Paint Shop Pro is a full-featured Paint program. This evaluation
version gives you 30 days to use the software, after which you can choose to
purchase the full version from Jasc Software’s Web site.
For more information and updates of Paint Shop Pro, visit the Jasc Software
Web site at www.jasc.com.
Troubleshooting
I tried my best to compile programs that work on most computers with the
minimum system requirements. Alas, your computer may differ, and some
programs may not work properly for some reason.
The two likeliest problems are that you don’t have enough memory (RAM)
for the programs you want to use, or you have other programs running that
are affecting the installation or running of a program. If you get an error mes-
sage such as Not enough memory or Setup cannot continue, try one or
more of the following suggestions and then try using the software again:
 Turn off any antivirus software running on your computer. Installation
programs sometimes mimic virus activity and may make your computer
incorrectly believe that it’s being infected by a virus.
 Close all running programs. The more programs you have running, the
less memory is available to other programs. Installation programs typi-
cally update files and programs; so if you keep other programs running,
installation may not work properly.
 Have your local computer store add more RAM to your computer. This
step is, admittedly, drastic and somewhat expensive. However, adding
more memory can really help the speed of your computer and allow
more programs to run at the same time.
If you still have trouble with the CD, please call the Customer Care phone
