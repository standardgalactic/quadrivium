FOREWORD 
To the Student: 
This book has been written with the assumption that the reader has no prior experience using Autodesk® 
Revit®. The intent of this book is to provide the student with a well-rounded knowledge of architectural tools 
and techniques for use in both school and industry. 
The book consists of a series of tutorials which primarily focus on the development of a single project. When 
you ftnish the book you wil have learned how to document and model all of the major architectural aspects of 
a commercial project. This includes floor plans, interior and exterior elevations, wall and building sections, door 
and room fmish schedules and organizing drawings on sheets for printing. 
The CD has several videos that supplement the book. Studying these videos along with the book wil help the 
reader to better understand Revit's architectural features. The book and videos wil also help prepare for the 
Autodesk Revit Architecture Certification Exam, see Appendix A for more information. 
Be sure to check out the additional material on the CD. 
To the Instructor: 
This book was designed for the architectural student using Revit 2014. Note: Students can successfully work 
through this book using Revit Architecture 2014 as well. Throughout the book, the student develops a two 
story commercial building. The drawings start with the floor plans and develop all the way to photo-realistic 
renderings similar to the one on the cover of this book. 
Throughout the book many Revit tools and techniques are covered while creating the model. Also, in a way 
that is applicable to the current exercise, industry standards and conventions are covered. Access to the internet 
is required for some exercises. 
Each chapter concludes with a self-exam and review questions. The answers to the self-exam questions are 
provided, but review question answers are not (they can only be found in the Instructor's Guide available from 
the publisher). 
This text is updated every year for the latest version of Revit. The printed text has always been available for the 
fall term. 
An Instructor's Resource Guide is available for this book. It contains: 
• 
Answers to the questions at the end of each chapter 
• 
Example images of each exercise to be turned in (can be used to grade students work) 
• 
Outline of tools and topics to be covered in each lesson's lecture

Architectural Commercial Design Using Autodesk Revit 2014 
Lesson 1 
Getting Started with Autodesk Revit 2014:: 
This chapter will introduce you to Autodesk® Revit® 2014. You will study the User Interface 
and learn how to open and exit a project and adjust the view of the drawing on the screen. It 
is recommended that you spend an ample amount of time learning this material, as it will 
greatly enhance your ability to progress smoothly through subsequent chapters. 
What is Revit Architecture 2014? 
What is Autodesk Revit used for? 
Autodesk Revit (Architecture, Structure and MEP) is the world's first fully parametric 
building design software. This revolutionary software, for the first time, truly takes 
architectural computer aided design beyond simply being a high tech pencil. Revit is a 
product of Autodesk, makers of AutoCAD, Civil 3D, Inventor, 3DS Max, Maya and many 
other popular design programs. 
Revit can be thought of as the foundation of a larger process called Building Information 
Modeling (BIM). The BIM process revolves around a virtual, information rich 3D model. 
In this model all the major building elements are represented and contain information such 
as manufacturer, model, cost, phase and much more. Once a model has been developed in 
Revit, third-party add-ins and applications can be used to further leverage the data. Some 
examples are Facilities Management, Analysis (Energy, Structural, Lighting), Construction 
Sequencing, Cost Estimating, Code Compliance and much more! 
Revit can be an invaluable tool to designers when leveraged to its full potential. The iterative 
design process can be accomplished using special Revit features such as Phasing and Design 
Options. Material selections can be developed and attached to various elements in the model, 
where one simple change adjusts the wood from oak to maple throughout the project. The 
power of schedules may be used to determine quantities and document various parameters 
contained within content (this is the "I" in BIM, which stands for Information). Finally, the 
three-dimensional nature of a Revit-based model allows the designer to present compelling 
still images and animations. These graphics help to more clearly communicate the design 
intent to clients and other interested parties. This book will cover many of these tools and 
techniques to assist in the creative process. 
What is a parametric building modeler? 
Revit is a program designed from the ground up using state-of-the-art technology. The term 
parametric describes a process by which an element is modified and an adjacent element(s) is 
automatically modified to maintain a previously established relationship. For example, if a 
wall is moved, perpendicular walls will grow, or shrink, in length to remain attached to the 
1-1 

Architectural Commercial Design Using Autodesk Revit 2014 
related wall. Additionally, elements attached to the wall will move, such as wall cabinets, 
doors, windows, air grilles, etc. 
Revit stands for Revise Instantly; a change made in one view is automatically updated in all 
other views and schedules. For example, if you move a door in an interior elevation view, the 
floor plan will automatically update. Or, if you delete a door, it will be deleted from all other 
views and schedules. 
A major goal of Revit is to eliminate much of the repetitive and mundane tasks traditionally 
associated with CAD programs allowing more time for design, coordination and 
visualization. For example: all sheet numbers, elevation tags and reference bubbles are 
updated automatically when changed anywhere in the project. Therefore it is difficult to find 
a miss-referenced detail tag. 
The best way to understand how a parametric model works is to describe the Revit project 
file. A single Revit file contains your entire building project. Even though you mostly draw in 
2D views, you are actually drawing in 3D. In fact, the entire building project is a 3D model. 
From this 3D model you can generate 2D elevations, 2D sections 
, 
, 
, 
' Width = 2' - 0" 
' 
and perspective views. Therefore, when you delete a door in an 
J 
, 
J 
elevation view you are actually deleting the door from the 3D model 
: 
' 
: 
from which all 2D views are generated and automatically updated. 
Another way in which Revit is a parametric building modeler is that 
parameters can be used to control the size and shape of geometry. 
For example, a window model can have two parameters set up which 
control the size of the window. Thus, from a window's properties it 
is possible to control the size of the window without using any of 
the drawing modify tools such as Scale or Mot·e. Furthermore, the 
parameter settings (i.e., width and height in this example) can be saved 
within the window model (called a FamilY). You could have the 2' x 
4' settings saved as "Type A" and the 2' x 6' as "Type B". Each 
saved list of values is called a Tjpe within the Fami!J. Thus, this one 
double-hung window Fami!J could represent an unlimited number of 
window sizes! You will learn more about this later in the book. 
What about the different "flavors" of Revit?

Revit comes in three different "flavors": Revit Architecture, Revit Structure and Revit 
MEP (which stands for Mechanical, Electrical and Plumbing). There is also a fourth option 
in which all disciplines are available in one application; this is just called Revit. The all-in-one 
version only comes with the Autodesk Building Design Suite Premium or Ultimate. Any 
"flavor" ofRevit can open and edit the same Revit project file or content (aka, Families). The 
only requirement is that each "flavor" of Revit be the same version; for example, Autodesk 
Revit Architecture 2014, Autodesk Revit Structure 2014 and Autodesk Revit MEP 2014.

Getting Started with Autodesk Revit 2014 
The tutorials in this textbook are based on Revit; you can also use Revit Architecture. You 
can download the free 30 day trial from autodesk.com. Students may download a free 13 
month version of Revit, the all-in-one version, at ww.students.autodesk.com.

Now is as good a time as any to 
make sure the reader understands 
that Revit is not, nor has it ever 
been, backwards compatible. This 
means there is no S m·e-As back to a 
previous version of Revit. Also, an 
older version of Revit cannot open a 
file, project or content, saved in a 
newer format. So make sure you 
consider what version your school 
or employer is currently 
standardized on before upgrading 
any projects or content.

32bit versus 64bit? 
If you have a choice, the 64bit version of Revit is recommended. One of the biggest 
advantages is access to more than 3GB of RAM. Many BIM stations have 8 to 16GB of 
RAM to handle large projects. The 64bit version of Revit looks the same and creates a model 
identical to one created in the 32bit version of Revit. Either version of Revit will work fine 
for this textbook. You have no control over which version is installed, it is automatically 
based on whether you have a 32bit or 64bit operating system on your computer

Why use Revit? 
Many people ask the question, why use Revit versus other programs? The answer can 
certainly vary depending on the situation and particular needs of an individual or 
organization. 
Generally speaking, this is why most companies use Revit: 
• 
Many designers and drafters are using Revit to streamline repetitive drafting tasks 
and focus more on designing and detailing a project. 
• 
Revit is a very progressive program and offers many features for designing buildings. 
Revit is constantly being developed and Autodesk provides incremental upgrades 
and patches on a regular basis; Revit 2014 was released about a year after the 
. 
. 
prev10us vers10n. 
• 
Revit was designed specifically for architectural design and includes features like: 
o 
Mental Ray's Photo Realistic Renderer 
o Phasing (existing, new construction, future construction, etc.) 
o Live schedules 
o Design Options 
o Cloud Rendering via Autodesk 360 
o Conceptual Energy Analysis via Autodesk 360

Getting Started with Autodesk Revit 2014 
A few basic Revit concepts: 
The following is meant to be a brief overview of the basic organization of Revit as a 
software application. You should not get too hung up on these concepts and terms as they 
will make more sense as you work through the tutorials in this book. This discussion is 
simply laying the groundwork so you have a general frame of reference on how Revit works. 
The Revit platform has three fundamental types of elements: 
• 
Model Elements 
• 
Datum Elements 
• 
View-Specific Elements 
Model Elements 
Think of Model Elements as things you can put your hands on once the building has been 
constructed. They are typically 3D, but can sometimes be 2D. There are two types of Model 
Elements: 
• 
Host Elements (walls, floors, slabs, roofs, ceilings) - Tools are the same for each 
"flavor" of Revit. 
• 
Model Components (Stairs, Doors, Furniture, Beams, Columns, Pipes, Ducts, 
Light Fixtures, Model Lines) - Options vary depending on the "flavor" of Revit (e.g., 
Revit MEP has a Duct tool whereas Revit Architecture and Revit Structure do not). 
o Some Model Components require a host before they can be placed within a 
project. For example, a window can only be placed in a host, which could be 
a wall, roof or floor depending on how the element was created. If the host is 
deleted, all hosted or dependent elements are automatically deleted.

Architectural Commercial Design Using Autodesk Revit 2014 
Datum Elements 
Datum Elements are reference planes within the building that graphically and parametrically 
define the location of various elements within the model. These features are available in all 
"flavors" of Revit. These are the three types of Datum Elements: 
• 
Grids 
o Typically laid out in a plan view to locate structural elements such as columns 
and beams, as well as walls. Grids show up in plan, elevation and section 
views. Moving a grid in one view moves it in all other views as it is the same 
element. (See the next page for an example of a grid in plan view.) 
• 
Levels 
o 
Used to define vertical relationships, mainly surfaces that you walk on. They 
only show up in elevation and section views. Many elements are placed 
relative to a Let·el; when the Let·el is moved those elements move with it (e.g., 
doors, windows, casework, ceilings). WARNING: If a Level is deleted, those same 
"dependent" elements will also be deleted from the project! 
• 
Reference Planes 
o These are similar to grids in that they show up in plan and elevation or 
sections. They do not have reference bubbles at the end like grids. Revit 
breaks many tasks down into simple 2D tasks which result in 3D geometry. 
Rtftrence Planes are used to define 2D surfaces on which to work within the 
3D model. They can be placed in any view, either horizontally or vertically.

View-Specific Elements 
As the name implies, the items about to be discussed only show up in the specific view in 
which they are created. For example, notes and dimensions added in the architectural floor 
plans will not show up in the structural floor plans. These elements are all 2D and are mainly 
communication tools used to accurately document the building for construction or 
presentations. 
• 
Annotation elements (text, tags, symbols, dimensions) 
o Size automatically set and changed based on selected drawing scale

File Types (and extensions): 
Revit has four primary types of files that you will work with as a Revit user. Each file 
type, as with any Microsoft Windows based program, has a specific three letter file name 
extension; that is, after the name of the file on your hard drive you will see a period and 
three letters. They are: 
.RVT 
.RFA 
.RTE

Architectural Commercial Design Using Autodesk Revit 2014 
The Revit platform has three fundamental ways in which to work with the elements (for 
display and manipulation): 
• 
Views 
• 
Schedules 
• 
Sheets 
The following is a cursory overview of the main ideas you need to know. This is not an 
exhaustive study on views, schedules and sheets. 
Views 
VieJvs, accessible from the Prqjed BrOJvser (see Page 5-4), is where most of the work is done 
while using Revit. Think of views as slices through the building, both horizontal (plans) and 
vertical (elevations and sections). 
• 
Plans 
o A Plan VieJv is a horizontal slice through the building. You can specify the 
location of the cut plane which determines if certain windows show up or 
how much of the stair is seen. A few examples are: architectural floor plan, 
reflected ceiling plan, site plan, structural framing plan, HVAC floor plan, 
electrical floor plan, lighting [ceiling] plan, etc. The images below show this 
concept; the image on the left is the 3D BIM. The middle image shows the 
portion of building above the cut plane removed. Finally, the last image on 
the right shows the plan view in which you work and place on a sheet. 
• 
Elevations 
o Elevations are vertical slices, but where the slice lies outside the floor plan as 
in the middle image below. Each elevation created is listed in the Prqjed 
BrOJvser. The image on the right is an example of a South exterior elevation 
view, which is a "live" view of the 3D model. If you select a window here 
and delete it, the floor plans will update instantly. 
1-8 

Getting Started with Autodesk Revit 2014 
• 
Sections 
o 
Similar to elevations, sections are also vertical slices. However, these slices 
cut through the building. A section view can be cropped down to become a 
wall section or even look just like an elevation. The images below show the 
slice, the portion of building in the foreground removed, and then the actual 
view created by the slice. A setting exists, for each section view, to control 
how far into that view you can see. The example on the right is "seeing" 
deep enough to show the doors on the interior walls. 
• 
3D and Camera 
o In addition to the traditional "flattened" 2D views that you will typically 
work in, you are able to see your designs more naturally via 3D and Camera 
views. A 3D view is simply a non-perspective 3D view of the project viewed 
from the exterior. A Camera view is a true perspective view; cameras can be 
created both in and outside of the building. Like the 2D views, these 
3D/ Camera views can be placed on a sheet to be printed. Revit provides a 
number of tools to help explore the 3D view, such as Section Box, Steering 
Wheel, Temporary Hide and Isolate, and Render. 
The image on the left is a 3D view set to "shade mode" and has shadows 
turned on. The image on the right is a camera view set up inside the building; 
the view is set to "hidden line" rather than shaded, and the camera is at 
eyelevel.

Schedules 
Schedules are lists of information generated based on content that has been placed, or 
modeled, within the project. A schedule can be created, such as the door schedule example 
shown below, that lists any of the data associated with each door that exists in the project. 
Revit allows you to work directly in the schedule views. Any change within a schedule view, 
is a change directly to the element being scheduled. Again, if a door were to be deleted from 
this schedule, that door would be instantly deleted from the project.

Sheets 
You can think of sheets as the pieces of paper on which your views and schedules will be 
printed. Views and schedules are placed on sheets and then arranged. Once a view has been 
placed on a sheet, its reference bubble is automatically filled out and that view cannot be 
placed on any other sheet. The setting for each view, called "view scale," controls the size of 
the drawing on each sheet; view scale also controls the size of the text and dimensions.

Overview of the Revit User Interface 
Revit is a powerful and sophisticated program. Because of its powerful feature set, it has a 
measurable learning curve, though its intuitive design makes it easier to learn than other 
CAD or BIM based programs. However, like anything, when broken down into smaller 
pieces, we can easily learn to harness the power of Revit. That is the goal of this book. 
This section will walk through the different aspects of the User Interface (UI). As with any 
program, understanding the user interface is the key to using the program's features. Note 
that the image below shows the all-in-one Revit user interface. However, the UI is virtually 
identical between discipline versions with the exception of the total number of tabs available.

TIP: See the DVD for a more in-depth look at the User Inteiface. 
Application Menu: 
Access to File tools such as Sare, Plot, E.xp01tand Print (both hardcopy and electronic 
printing). You also have access to tools which control the Revit application as a whole, not 
just the current project, such as Ucensing and Options (see the end of this section for more on 
Options).

Recent and Open Documents: 
ॴ These two icons (from 
̏ the Application menu) 
toggle the entire area on 
the right to show either the recent 
documents you have been in (icon 
on the left) or a list of the documents 
you currently have open. 
In the Recent Documents list you click a 
listed document to open it. This 
saves time as you do not have to 
click Open -? Prqjed and browse for 
the document (Documentand Prqjed 
mean the same thing here). Finally, 
clicking the "Pin" keeps that project 
from getting bumped off the list as 
additional projects are opened. 
In the Open Documents list the "active" 
project you are working in is listed 
first, clicking another project 
switches you to that open project. 
The list on the left, in the Application Menu shown above, represents three 
different types of buttons: button, drop-d01vn button and split button. Save and 
Close are simply buttons. Save-As and Export are drop-down buttons, 
which means to reveal a group of related tools. If you click or hover your 
cursor over one of these buttons, you will get a list of tools on the right. 
Finally, split buttons have two actions depending on what part of the 
button you click on; hovering over the button reveals the two parts (see 
bottom image to the right). The main area is the most used tool; the arrow 
reveals additional related options.

Quick Access T oolbar: 
Referred to as QAT in this book, this single toolbar provides access to often used tools 
(Open, Sat'e, Undo, Redo, Measure, Tag, etc.). It is always visible regardless of what part of the 
Ribbon is active. 
The QAT can be positioned above or below the Ribbon and any command from the Ribbon 
can be placed on it; simply right-dick on any tool on the Ribbon and select Add to Quick 
Access Toolbar. Moving the QAT below the Ribbon gives you a lot more room for your 
favorite commands to be added from the Ribbon. Clicking the larger down-arrow to the far 
right reveals a list of common tools which can be toggled on and off. 
Some of the icons on the QAT have a down-arrow on the right. Clicking this arrow reveals a 
list of related tools. In the case of Undo and Redo, you have the ability to undo (or redo) 
several actions at once.

Build 
The Anhitedure tab on the Ribbon contains most of the tools the architect needs to model a 
building, essentially the things you can put your hands on when the building is done. The 
specific discipline versions of Revit omit some of the other discipline tabs. 
Each tab starts with the Modifj tool, i.e., the first button on the left. This tool puts you into 
"selection mode" so you can select elements to modify. Clicking this tool cancels the current 
tool and unselects elements. With the Modijj tool selected you may select elements to view 
their properties or edit them. Note that the Modijj tool, which is a button, is different than 
the Modijj tab on the Ribbon. 
The Ribbon has three types of buttons, button, drop-d01vn button and split, as covered on the 
previous page. In the image above you can see the Wall tool is a split button. Most of the 
time you would simply click the top part of the button to draw a wall. Clicking the down­
arrow part of the button, for the Wall tool example, gives you the option to draw a Wall, 
Stru"tural Wall, Wall ry Faa1, Wall S1veep, and a Ret·eal. 
TIP: The Model Text tool is on!J for pla,ing 3D text in your model, not for adding notes!

To view this tab, simply click the label "Annotate" near the top of the Ribbon. This tab 
presents a series of tools which allow you to add notes, dimensions and 2D 
"embellishments" to your model in a specific view, such as a floor plan, elevation, or section. 
All of these tools are view specific, meaning a note added in the first floor plan will not 
show up anywhere else, not even another first floor plan: for instance, a first floor electrical 
plan. 
Notice, in the image above, that the Dimension panel label has 
a down-arrow next to it. Clicking the down-arrow will reveal 
an extended panel with additional related tools. 
Finally, notice the Component tool in the image above; it is a 
split button rather than a drop-d01vn button. Clicking the top 
part of this button will initiate the Detail Component tool. 
Clicking the bottom part of the button opens the fly-out 
menu revealing related tools. Once you select an option from 
the fly-out, that tool becomes the default for the top part of 
the split button for the current session ofRevit (see image to 
right).

The tools on the Vie1v tab allow you to create new views of your 3D model; this includes 
views that look 2D (e.g., floor plans, elevations and sections) as well as 3D views (e.g., 
isometric and perspective views). 
The VieJv tab also gives you tools to control how views look, everything from what types of 
elements are seen (e.g., Plumbing Fixture, Furniture or Section Marks) as well as line 
weights. 
NOTE: Line weights are mntrolled at a pfT!fed wide lml, but mt!J be ot-erridden on a tiew I?J tiew basis. 
Finally, notice the little arrow in the lower-right corner of the Graphi"-s panel. When you see 
an arrow like this you can click on it to open a dialog box with settings that relate to the 
panel's tool set (Graphi"-s in this example). Hovering over the arrow reveals a tooltip which 
will tell you what dialog box will be opened. 
Ribbon- Modify Contextual Tab: 
The Modijj tab is appended when certain tools are active or elements are selected in the 
model; this is referred to as a wntextual tab. The first image, below, shows the Pla"·e Wall tab 
which presents various options while adding walls. The next example shows the Modijj Walls 
contextual tab which is accessible when one or more walls are selected.

There is not too much customization that can be done to the Ribbon. One of the only things 
you can do is pull a panel off the Ribbon by clicking and holding down the left mouse button 
on the titles listed across the bottom. This panel can be placed within the drmving 1vind01v or 
on another screen if you have a dual monitor setup. 
The image above shows the Build panel, from the Anhite"ture tab, detached from the Ribbon 
and floating within the drawing window. Notice that the Inmttab is active. Thus, you have 
constant access to the Build tools while accessing other tools. Note that the Build panel is not 
available on the Anhite"ture tab as it is literally moved, not just copied.

When you need to move a detached panel back to the Ribbon you do the following: hover 
over the detached panel until the sidebars show up and then click the "Return panels to 
ribbon" icon in the upper right (identified in the image above). 
FYI: Whenever the resolution of your monitor is 
too lou; or you don 't have the Rnit applimtion 
maximized on the screen the buttons mqy be modified to 
take up less room on the Ribbon; typical!J the JJords are 
removed. Compare the image to the right JJith the Build

Ribbon - States: 
The Ribbon can be displayed in one of four states: 
• 
Full Ribbon (default) 
• 
Minimize to Tabs 
• 
Minimize to Panel Tiles 
• 
Minimize to Panel Buttons 
The intent of this feature is to increase the size of the available drawing window. It is 
recommended, however, that you leave the Ribbon fully expanded while learning to use the 
program. The images in this book show the fully expanded state. The images below show 
the other three options. When using one of the minimized options you simply hover (or 
click) your cursor over the Tab or Panel to temporarily reveal the tools.

Ribbon - References in this Book: 
When the exercises make reference to the tools in the Ribbon a consistent method is used to 
eliminate excessive wording and save space. Take a moment to understand this so that things 
go smoothly for you later. 
Throughout the textbook you will see an instruction similar to the following: 
23. Select Architecture -7 Build -7 Wall 
This means, click the Architecture tab, and within the BuHd panel, select the Wall tool. 
Note that the Wall tool is actually a split button, but a subsequent tool was not listed so you 
are to click on the primary part of the button. Compare the above example to the one below: 
23. Select Architecture -7 Build -7 Wall -7 Structural Wall 
The above example indicates that you should click the down-arrow 
part of the Wall tool in order to select the Strudural Wall option. 
Thus the general pattern is this: 
Tab -7 Panel -7 Tool -7 drop-down list item 
#1 Tab: This will get you to the correct area within the Ribbon. 
#2 Panel: This will narrow down your search for the desired tool. 
#3 Tool: Specific tool to select and use. 
Drop-d01vn list item: This will only be specified for drop-down buttons 
and sometimes for split buttons.

Options Bar: 
This area dynamically changes to show options that compliment the current operation. The 
Options Bar is located directly below the Ribbon. When you are learning to use Revit you 
should keep your eye on this area and watch for features and options appearing at specific 
times. The image below shows the Options Bar example with the Wall tool active.

The Properties Palette provides instant access to settings related 
to the element selected or about to be created. When nothing 
is selected, it shows information about the current view. When 
multiple elements are selected, the common parameters are 
displayed.

Properties Palette; nothing selected 
The Element Type Seledoris an 
important part of the Prope1ties 
Palette. Whenever you are adding 
elements or have them selected, 
you can select from this list to 
determine how a wall to be 
drawn will look, or how a wall 
previously drawn should look 
(see image to right). If a wall type 
needs to change, you never 
delete it and redraw it; you 
simply select it and pick a new 
type from the Tjpe S eledor. 
The Selection Filter drop-down list below the Tjpe Seledor lets 
you know the type and quantity of the elements currently 
selected. When multiple elements are selected you can narrow 
down the properties for just one element type, such as Jvall. 
Notice the image to the right shows four walls are in the 
current selection set. Selecting Walls (4) will cause the Palette 
to only show Wall properties even though many other 
elements are selected (and remain selected). 
The width of the Properties Palette and the center column 
position can be adjusted by dragging the cursor over that area. 
You may need to do this at times to see all the information. 
However, making the Palette too wide will reduce the useable 
drawing area.

Status Bar: 
The Prqjed BrOJvser is the "Grand Central Station" of the Revit 
project database. All the views, schedules, sheets and content are 
accessible through this hierarchical list. The first image to the left 
shows the seven major categories; any item with a "plus" next to 
it contains sub-categories or items. 
Double-clicking on a View, Legend, Schedule or Sheet will open 
it for editing; the current item open for editing is bold (Level l in 
the example to the left). Right-clicking will display a pop-up 
menu with a few options such as Delete and Copy. 
Right-click on VieJvs (all), at the top of the Prqjed BrOJvser, and you 
will find a Search option in the pop-up menu. This can be used 
to search for a VieJv, Fami!J, etc., a very useful tool when working 
on a large project with 100's of items to sift through. 
Like the Prope1ties Palette, the width of the Prqjed BrOJvser can be 
adjusted. When the two are stacked above each other, they both 
move together. You can also stack the two directly on top of 
each other; in this case you will see a tab for each at the bottom 
as shown in the second image to the left. 
The Prqjed BrOJvser should be left open; if you accidentally close it, 
by clicking the "X" in the upper right, you can reopen it by: 
View Í Window Í User Interface Í Project Browser. 
The Prqjed BrOJvserand Prope1ties Palette can be repositioned on a 
second monitor, if you have one, when you want more room to 
work in the drawing window. 
This area will display information, on the far left, about the current command or list 
information about a selected element. The right hand side of the Status Bar shows the 
number of elements selected. The small funnel icon to the left of the selection number can 
be clicked to open the Filter dialog box, which allows you to reduce your current selection to 
a specific category; for example, you could select the entire floor plan, and then filter it down 
to just the doors. This is different than the S ele"tion Filter in the Prope1ties Palette which keeps 
everything selected.

On the Status Bar, the five icons on the left in the image below control how elements are 
selected. From left to right these are: 
• 
Select Links 
,. •z 
; ,. 
_. ,._ 
• 
Select Underlay Elements 
• 
Select Pinned Elements 
• 
Select Elements by Face 
• 
Drag Elements on Selection 
: 0  
Hover your cursor over an icon for the name and for a brief description of what it does. 
These are toggles that are on or off; the red 'X' in the upper right of each icon means 
you cannot select that type of element within the model. These controls help prevent 
accidentally moving or deleting things. Keep these toggles in mind if you are having trouble 
selecting something; you may have accidentally toggled one of these on. 
Finally, the two drop-down lists towards the center of the Status Bar control Design 
Options and Worksets (see image on previous page). The latter is not covered in this book 
but Design Options are. Worksets relate to the ability for more than one designer to be in the 
model at a time. 
View Control Bar: 
This is a feature which gives you convenient access to tools which control each view's 
display settings (i.e., scale, shadows, detail level, graphics style, etc.). The options vary slightly 
between view types: 2D View, 3D view, Sheet and Schedule. 
The important thing to know is that these settings only affect 
c a n c el 
the current view, the one listed on the Application Title Bar. All 
Repeat [Wa l l [  
of these settings are available in the Properties Palette, but this 
Recent Command• 
tool bar cannot be turned off like the Properties Palette can. 
C h a n g e  wa l l ' ;  ori entati o n 
Context Menu: 
The context menu appears near the cursor whenever you right­
click on the mouse (see image at right). The options on that 
menu will vary depending on what tool is active or what 
element is selected. 
Drawing Window: 
This is where you manipulate the Building Information Model 
(BIM). Here you will see the current view (plan, elevation or 
section), schedule or sheet. Any changes made are instantly 
propagated to the entire database.

Elevation Marker: 
This item is not really part of the Revit UI, but is visible in the drawing 
window by default via the various templates you can start with, so it is 
D> 
worth mentioning at this point. The four elevation markers point at each 
side of your project and ultimately indicate the drawing sheet on which 
you would find an elevation drawing of each side of the building. All you 
need to know right now is that you should draw your floor plan generally in the middle of 
the four elevation markers that you will see in each plan view; DO NOT delete them as this 
will remove the related view from the Prqjed BrOJvser. 
Revit Options: 
There are several settings, related to the User Inteiface, which are not tied to the current 
model. That is, these settings apply to the installation of Revit on your computer, rather than 
applying to just one model or file on your computer. A few of these settings will be briefly 
discussed here. It is recommended that you don't make any changes here right now. 
Click on Options in the 
Application Menu (the purple "R") . 
The options in the User Interface 
section are fairly self-explanatory.

Efficient Practices 
The Ribbon and menus are really helpful when learning a program like Revit; however, most 
experienced users rarely use them! The process of moving the mouse to the edge of the 
screen to select a command and then back to where you were is very inefficient, especially 
for those who do this all day long, five days a week. Here are a few ways experienced BIM 
operators work: 
• 
Use the wheel on the mouse to Zoom (spin the wheel), Pan (press and hold the 
wheel button while moving the mouse) and Zoom Extents (double-clicking the 
wheel button). All this can be done while in another command; so, if you are in the 
middle of drawing walls and need to zoom in to see which point you are about to 
Snap to, you can do it without canceling the Line command and without losing focus 
on the area you are designing by having to click an icon near the edge of the screen. 
• 
Revit conforms to many of the Microsoft Windows operating system standards. 
Most programs, including Revit, have several standard commands that can be 
accessed via keyboard shortcuts. Here are a few examples (press both keys at the 
same time): 
0 Ctrl + S 
Save 
(sat·es the r:urrent modeƑ 
0 Ctrl + A  
Select All 
(seleds et·erything in text editor) 
0 Ctrl + Z 
Undo 
(undoes the pretious adion) 
0 Ctrl + X  
Cut 
(Cut to Windows r:lipboard) 
0 Ctrl + C 
Copy 
(does not replar:e Retit's Copy tooƑ 
0 Ctrl + V 
Paste 
(used to r:opy between models/ tiews/ let·els) 
0 Ctrl + Tab 
Change View 
(toggles between open tiews) 
0 Ctrl + P 
Print 
(opens print dialog) 
0 Ctrl + N 
New 
(treate new prr?}ed file) 
0 
F7 
Spelling 
(launr:h spell r:her:k feature) 
0 ENTER 
Previous Command 
(repeat pretious r:ommand) 
• 
If you recall, the Open Dor:uments area in the Application menu lists all the views that 
are currently open on your computer. By clicking one of the names in the list you 
"switch" to that view. A shortcut is to press Ctrl + Tab to quickly cycle through the 
open drawings. 
• 
Many Revit commands also have keyboard shortcuts. So, with your right hand on the 
mouse (and not moving from the "design" area), your left hand can type WA when 
you want to draw a Wall for example. You can see all the preloaded shortcuts and 
add new ones by clicking View (tab) -7 User Inteifat'e (drop-down) -? Kryboard Shorttuts. 
1-23 

Architectural Commercial Design Using Autodesk Revit 2014 
It should be noted that any customized 
keyboard shortcuts are specific to the 
computer you are working on, not the 
project. You can use the Export button 
(see image to right) to save the entire 
keyboard shortcuts list to a file, and 
then Import it into another computer's 
copy of Revit. 
This concludes your brief overview of 
the Revit user interface. Many of these 
tools and operations will be covered in 
more detail throughout the book.

Close a Revit Project: 
9. Select Application menu -7 Close; click No if 
prompted to save. 
This will close the current project/view. If more than one view is open for a project, only 
the current view will close. The project and the other opened views will not close until you 
get to the last open view. 
10. Repeat the previous step to close the other project file. 
If you made changes and have not saved your project yet, you will be prompted to do so 
before Revit closes the view. Do not save at this time. When all open project files are 
closed, you find yourself back in the Recent Files screen -which is where you started. 
Saving a Revit Project: 
At this time we will not actually save a project. 
To save a project file, simply select S m·e from the Quick Access Toolbar. You can 
also select Sm·e from the Application menu or press Ctrl + S on the keyboard. 
You should get in the habit of saving often to avoid losing work due to a power outage or 
program crash. 
You can also save a copy of the current project by selecting Save As from the Application 
Menu. Once you have used the Sm·e As command you are in the new project file and the file 
you started in is then closed. 
Closing the Revit Program: 
Finally, from the Application menu select Exit Revit. This will close any open projects/views 
and shut down Revit. Again you will be prompted to save, if needed, before Revit closes the 
view. Do not save at this time. 
You can also click the "X" in the upper right comer of the Retit 
Application window.

Creating a New Project File: 
The steps required to set up a new Revit Architecture model project file are very simple. As 
mentioned earlier, simply opening the Revit program starts you in the Recent Files window. 
To manually create a new project (maybe you just finished working on a previous assignment 
and want to start the next one): 
1. Select Application menu -7 New -7 Project. ŕŖ 
FYI: You C"an also select the New link in the Recent Files startup screen. 
After clicking Ne1v -7 Projedyou will get the New Project dialog box (Figure 1-4.1).

2. Select the Architectural Template template file. Leave Create neJv set to Project 
(Figure 1-4.1). 
3. Click OK You now have a new unnamed project file. 
To name an unnamed project file you simply San The first time an unnamed project file is 
saved you will be prompted to specify the name and location for the project file. 
4. Select Application menu -7 Save from the Menu Bar. 
5. Specify a name and location for your new project file. 
Your instrudor mqy specifj a location or folder fir your files if in a dassroom setting. 
What is a Template File? 
A template file allows you to start your project with specific content and certain settings 
preset the way you like or need them. 
For example, you can have the units set to Imperial or Metric. You can have the door, window 
and wall families you use most loaded and eliminate other less often used content. Also, you 
can have your company's title block preloaded and even have all the sheets for a project set 
up. 
A custom template is a must for design firms using Revit and will prove useful to the student 
as he or she becomes more proficient with the program. 
Be Aware: 
It will be assumed from this point f01ward that the reader understands how to create, open and 
save project files. Please refer back to this section as needed. If you still need further assistance, 
ask your instructor for help.

You should now be back where you started. Each time 
you select this icon you are resorting to a previous view

times if you did some panning and multiple zooms.

Default 3D View 
Clicking on the Difault 3D VieJv icon, on the QAT, loads a 3D View. This allows you to 
quickly switch to a 3D view. 
7. Click on the Default 3D View icon. 
8. Go to the Open Documents listing in the 
Application Menu and notice the 3D VieJv and 
the Floor Plan view are both listed at the 
bottom.

REMEMBER: You can toggle between tiews here. 
9. Click the Esc key to close the Application menu. 
ViewCube 
The VieJvCube gives you convenient view control over the 3D view. This technology has 
been implemented in many of Autodesk's programs to make the process seamless for the 
user. 
10. You should notice the ViewCube in the upper right corner of the drawing window 
(Figure 1-5.5). If not, you can turn it on by clicking VieJv Ĵ WindOJvs Ĵ User Inteiface 
Ĵ VieJvCube. 
TIP: The ViewCube on!J shows up in 3D tiews. 
Hovering your cursor over the VieJvCube activates it. As you 
move about the Cube you see various areas highlight. If you 
click, you will be taken to that highlighted area in the drawing 
window. You can also click and drag your cursor on the Cube 
to "roll" the model in an unconstrained fashion. Clicking and 
dragging the mouse on the disk below the Cube allows you to 
spin the model without rolling. Finally, you have a few options 
in a right-dick menu, and the Home icon, just above the 
Cube, gets you back to where you started if things get 
disoriented! 
1 1 .  Give the Vie1vCube a try, then click the Home icon 
when you are done.

REMEMBER: The Home icvn on!J shows up when your c-ursor is ot-er the ViewCube.

Navigation Wheel 
Similar to the VieJvCube, the Natigation Wheel aids in navigating your model. With the 
Natigation Wheel you can walk through your model, going down hallways and turning into 
rooms. Revit has not advanced to the point where the doors will open for you; thus, you 
walk through closed doors or walls as if you where a ghost! 
The Natigation Wheel is activated by clicking the upper icon on the Natigation Bar. 
Unfortunately, it is way too early in your Revit endeavors to learn to use the Natigation Wheel. 
You can try this in the chapter on creating photorealistic renderings and camera views. You 
would typically use this tool in a camera view. 
Figure 1-5.6 Navigation Wheel

Close the Church Building project without saving. 
Using the Scroll Wheel on the Mouse 
The scroll wheel on the mouse is a must for those using BIM software. In Revit you can Pan 
and Zoom without even clicking a zoom icon. You simply scroll the wheel to zoom and 
hold the wheel button down to pan. This can be done while in another command (e.g., 
while drawing walls). Another nice feature is that the drawing zooms in to the area near your 
cursor, rather than zooming only at the center of the drawing window. Give this a try before 
moving on. Once you get the hang of it, you will not want to use the icons. Also, double­
clicking the wheel button does a Zoom to Fit so everything is visible on the screen.

Getting Started with Autodesk Revit 2014 
This section of your introductory chapter will provide a quick overview of Revit's Help 
System. This will allow you to study topics in more detail if you want to know how something 
works beyond the introductory scope of this textbook. 
1. Click the round question mark icon in the upper­
right comer of the screen. 
You are now in Revit's WikiHelp site (Figure 1-6.1). This is a website which opened in your 
web browser. This window can be positioned side by side with Revit, which is especially nice 
if you have a dual-screen computer system. This interface requires a connection to the 
internet. As a website, Autodesk has the ability to add and revise information at any time, 
unlike files stored on your hard drive. This also means that the site can change quite a bit, 
potentially making the following overview out of date. If the site has changed, just follow 
along as best you can for the next three pages.

The Help System can be used to complement this textbook. It is a reference resource, not a 
tutorial. As you are working though the tutorials in this book, you may want to use the Help 
System to fill in the blanks if you are having trouble or want more information on a topic. 
What is a Wiki 
The Revit Help System is set up on a Wiki website. A Wiki site is a special type of website 
where anyone can add information to the site. This makes the potential knowledgebase very 
large. Anyone who sees a mistake in the steps or instructions provided can make a change. 
Additionally, a person with specific expertise can add additional information which will help

Introduction to Autodesk 360 
We will finish this chapter with a look at Autodesk 360, 
which is "ground zero" for all of Autodesk's Cloud 
services. It is important that the student read this 
information in order to follow along in the book when 
specific steps related to using these Cloud services are 
covered. The reader does not necessarily need to use 
Autodesk's Cloud services to successfully complete this 
book. 
The main features employed in the book are: 
• 
Saving your work to Autodesk 360 so you can 
access the data anywhere and know that the files 
are in a secure, backed up location. This feature is 
free to anyone, with some limitations to be 
discussed later. 
• 
Sending your photorealistic rendering project to 
the Cloud to dramatically reduce the overall 
processing time. This feature is free to students 
and a free trail is available to everyone else. 
Here is how Autodesk describes Autodesk 360 on their website: 
The Autodesk® 360 cloud-based framework provides tools and services to 
extend design beyond the desktop. Streamline your workflows, effectively 
collaborate, and qu ickly access and share your work anytime, from 
anywhere. With virtually infinite computing power in the cloud, Autodesk 360 
scales up or down to meet business needs without the infrastructure or 
upfront investment required for traditional desktop software .  
Before we discuss Autodesk 360 with more specificity, let's define what the Cloud is. The 
Cloud is a service, or collection of services, which exists partially or completely 
online. This is different from the Internet, which mostly involves downloading static 
information, in that you are creating and manipulating data. Most of this happens outside of 
your laptop or desktop computer. This gives the average user access to massive amounts of 
storage space, computing power and software they could not otherwise afford if they had to 
actually own, install and maintain these resources in their office, school or home. In one 
sense, this is similar to a Tool Rental Center, in that the average person could not afford, nor 
would it be cost-effective to own, a jackhammer. However, for a fraction of the cost of 
ownership and maintenance, we can rent it for a few hours. In this case, everyone wins!

Creating a Free Autodesk 360 Account 
The first thing an individual needs to do in order to gain access to Autodesk 360 is create a 
free account at https:/ /360.autodesk.com (students: see TIP below); the specific steps will be 
covered later in this section, so you don't need to do this now. This account is for an 
individual person, not a computer, not an installation of Revit or AutoCAD, nor does it 
come from your employer or school. Each person who wishes to access Autodesk 360 
services must create an account, which will give them a unique usemame and password. 
TIP: Students should first create an account at http:// students.autodesk.com. This is the 
same place you go to download free Auto desk software. Be sure to use your school email address as 
this is what identifies you as a qualijjing student. Once you create an account there,you can use this 
same user name and password to access Auto desk 360. Following these steps will git·e you access to 
more storage space and unlimited Cloud rendering! 
Generally speaking, there are three ways you can access Autodesk 360 Cloud services: 
• 
Autodesk 360 website 
• 
Within Revit or AutoCAD; local computer 
• 
Mobile device; smart phone or tablet 
Autodesk 360 Website 
When you have documents stored in the Cloud you may access them via your web browser. 
Here you can manage your files, view them without the full application (some file formats 
not supported) and share them. These features use some advanced browser technology, so 
you need to make sure your browser is up to date; specifically: 
To view most 2D documents, use these browsers: 
• 
Mozilla ® Firefox® 10 and later 
• 
Google ChromeTM 16 and later 
• 
Microsoft® Internet Explorer® 8 and later 
• 
Apple® Safari® 5.1 and later 
To view both 2D and 3D documents, use these browsers: 
• 
Mozilla® Firefox® 10 and later 
• 
Google ChromeTM 16 and later 
IMPORTANT: Depending on your browser, the Adobe® Flash® Player may be required to 
upload files and view video. 
1-41 

Architectural Commercial Design Using Autodesk Revit 2014 
Using the website, you can upload files from your computer to store in the Cloud. To do this, 
you switch to the Folders and Categories section and click the Upload option (Figure 1-
7.1). 
TIP: If using Firefox or Chrome, you can drag and drop documents into the Upload Documents window. This is a 
great wqy to create a secure backup of your documents.

FIGURE 1-7.1 Viewing files stored in the Cloud 
You can share files stored in the Cloud with others. Private sharing is with others who have 
an Autodesk 360 account and is very easy. Another option is public sharing, which allows you 
to send someone a link and they can access the file, even if they don't have a 360 account. 
Simply right-dick on a file within Autodesk 360 to see the sharing options (Figure 1-7.2).

Autodesk 360 within Revit or AutoCAD; local computer 
Another way in which you can access you data, stored in the Cloud, is from with-in your 
Autodesk application; for example, Revit or AutoCAD. This is typically the most convenient 
as you can open, view and modify your drawings. Once logged in, you will also have access 
to any Cloud S en ices available to you from within the application, such as rendering or Green 
Building Studio. 
To sign in to Autodesk 360 within your application, simply click the Sign In option in the 
notification area in the upper right corner of the window. You will need to enter your 
student email address and password (or personal email if not a student) as discussed in the 
previous section. When properly logged in, you will see your username or email address 
listed as shown in Figure 1-7.3 below. You will try this later in this section. 
FIGURE 1-7.3 Example of user logged into Autodesk 360 
Once you are logged in, and if Autodesk 360 is installed on your computer, you will also see 
an Autodesk 360 option in the drop-down list of the Open dialog box, as shown in Fig. 1-7.4. 
Open 
l.m!l ta e kwo n do Rev4, rvt 
FIGURE 1-7.4 Autodesk 360 accessed from the open dialog 
Keep in mind that AL files stored in Autodesk 360 are saved on the hard drive of ANY 
computer you are using; this is ONLY true if you log into Autodesk 360. The files are not 
easy to find manually, but a search should reveal them rather quickly. The files are NOT 
deleted off of the local computer when you log out either. This should not be a problem for 
working through this book, but you will want to be careful when working with design files 
from your firm or office (if you work in one). 
1-43 

Architectural Commercial Design Using Autodesk Revit 2014 
When you are logged into Autodesk 360 from within your application, you can also view your 
files using WindOJvs Explorer. Notice in the image below (Figure 1-7.5), that Autodesk 360 is 
listed as a Fat-orite. When you click the Autodesk 360 link, your files and folders are shown to 
the right. Using this view, you can more easily add folders and copy files.

FIGURE 1-7.5 Autodesk 360 files accessed from windows explorer 
Using Revit or AutoCAD on your computer, it is possible to work on files directly in the 
Cloud- kind of. You actually work on the local version of your files, which are automatically 
synched with the online version anytime they change. Keep in mind this does not work for 
the multi-user environment, called work-sharing, which Revit is capable of. 
When Autodesk 360 is installed on your local 
computer system, you will have an icon for it 
in the WindOJvs system tray as shown in Figure 
1-7.6. If you right-dick on this icon you will 
be presented with a few options, such as: 
open the local folder, open the website view, 
sync now, pause sync and preferences. 
Clicking preferences presents the dialog box 
shown in Figure 1-7.7. Here you can see how 
much space you have available, enable 
automatic log-in upon system start up and 
specify what to do with linked files. You can 
also force a Sign Out to manually break the 
connection to the Cloud. Your local version of 
the files will still be on your computer, but the 
Autodesk 360 links will not reveal them.

When using the Render in Cloud feature (Figure 1-7 .8) or Run Energy Simulation 
(Figure 1-7.9), you must be logged into Autodesk 360 within the application. If you are not 
logged in when you click this tool, Revit will prompt you to log in. This is how the Cloud 
Senice validates your job request. You either need to be a student, have an account associated 
with Autodesk Subscription, or have pre-paid Autodesk Cloud credits.

The next few steps will walk you through the process of setting up your free online account 
at Autodesk 360. These steps are not absolutely critical to completing this book, so if you 
have any reservations about creating an Autodesk 360 account - don't do it. 
1. To create a free Autodesk 360 account, do one of the following: 
a. If you are a student: create an account at http:// students.autodesk.com. 
b. If you work for a company who has their Autodesk software on 
subscription: ask your ContradAdministrator (this is a person in your office) 
to create an account for you and send you an invitation via 
http:// subscription.autodesk.com. 
c. Everyone else: create an account at: https:/ /360.autodesk.com 
FYI: The 'ï" at the end of "http" in the Autodesk 360 URL means this is a sec-ure website. 
2. Open your application: AutoCAD or Revit.

FIGURE 1-7.11 Signing in to Autodesk 360 
It is recommended, as you work through this book, that you save all of your work in the 
Cloud, via Autodesk 360, so you will have a safe and secure location for your files. These files 
can then be accessed from several locations via the three methods discussed here. It is still 
important to maintain a separate copy of your files on a flash drive, portable hard drive or in 
another Cloud-type location such as Dropbox. This will be important if your main files ever 
become corrupt. You should manually backup your files to your backup location so a 
corrupt file does not automatically corrupt your backup file. 
TIP: If you hat·e a file that will not open try one of the following: 
• 
In AutoCAD: Open AutoCAD and then , from the Applicf1tion Menu, select Drawing Utilities -? 
Remt·er -? Recvt·er. Then browse to your file and open it. AutoCAD will try to mot·er the drawingfile. 
This mqy require some things to be deleted, but is better than losing the entire file. 
• 
In Revit: Open Retit and, from the Applic-ation Menu, select Open; browse to your file, then select it. Clic-k 
the Audit c-hec-k box, and then c-lic-k Open. Retit will attempt to repair arry problems with the prqject 
database. Some elements mqy need to be deleted, but this is better than losing the entire file. 
Be sure to check out the Autodesk website to learn more about Autodesk 360 and the 
growing number of Cloud services Autodesk is offering.

Lesson 2 
Quick Start: Small Office:: 
In this lesson you will get a down and dirty overview of the functionality of Autodesk Revit. 
The very basics of creating the primary components of a floor plan: Walls, Doors, Windows, 
Roof, Annotation and Dimensioning will be covered. This lesson will show you the amazing 
"out-of-the-box" powerful, yet easy to use, features in Revit. It should get you very excited 
about learning this software program. Future lessons will cover these features in more detail 
while learning other editing tools and such along the way. 
Wails, Grids and Dimensions 
In this exercise you will draw the walls, starting with the exterior. Read the directions 
carefully, everything you need to do is clearly listed. 
Exterior Wails: 
1. Start a new project named Small Office per the following instructions:

You are now ready to draw the exterior walls. 
4. In the Drau;ing WindOJv, click in the upper 
left corner. 
TIP: Make sure to draw within the four elet·ation 
markers (see image to right). 
5. Start moving the mouse down and to 
the right. Click when the two temporary 
on-screen listening dimensions are 
approximately 100' (East to West) and 
60' (front to back). 
Your first 
pick here 
Getting the dimensions exact is not important as they will be revised later on. 
2-2 
Dmll'ing IJ7indon• 

Quick Start: Small Office 
Your drawing should look similar to Figure 2-1.4; similar in that the dimensions do not have 
to be exact right now and the building's location relative to the four elevation tags may vary 
slightly. 
The Temporary Dimensions are displayed until the next action is invoked by the user. While the 
dimensions are displayed, you can click on the dimension text and adjust the wall 
dimensions. Also, by default the Temporary Dimensions reference the center of the wall - you 
can change this by simply clicking on the grips located on each Witness LJne; each click 
toggles the witness line location between center, exterior face and interior face.

FIGURE 2-1.4 Exterior walls 
In the next few steps you will create grid lines and establish a relationship between the walls 
and the grids such that moving a grid causes the wall to move with it. 
Grids: 
Grids are used to position structural columns and beams in a building. Adding a grid 
involves selecting the Grid tool and then picking two points in the drawing window. 
6. Click Modify on the Ribbon (to finish using the Wall tool) 
and then select the Architecture Í Datum Í Grid. 
FYI: The same Grid tool is also found on the Structure tab. 
2-3 
Grid 

Architectural Commercial Design Using Autodesk Revit 2014 
Next you will draw a vertical grid off 
to the left of your building. Once you 
have drawn all the grids you will use a 
special tool to align the grid with the 
walls and lock that relationship. 
7. [first pick] Click down and to 
the left of your building as 
shown in Figure 2.1-5. 
FYI: 'Click' alwqys means left-click, 
unless a right-click is specificalfy called 
for. 
8. [second pit-:k] Move the cursor 
straight up (i.e., vertically) 
making sure you see a dashed 
cyan line, which indicates you 
are snapped to the vertical 
plane, and the angle dimension 
reads 90 degrees. Just past the 
North edge of the building (as 
shown in Figure 2.1-5), click.

FIGURE 2-1.5 Drawing a grid 
You have now drawn your first grid line. Next you will quickly draw four more grid lines; 
two horizontal and two vertical. 
NOTE: The Grid tool will remain actir·e until you select another tool or select Modij (selecting Modij allows 
you to select other elements in the drawing window). 
9. Draw another vertical grid approximately centered on your building. BEFORE 
YOU PICK THE FIRST POINT, make sure you see a dashed cyan reference line 
indicating the grid line will align with the previous grid line (you will see this before 
clicking the mouse at each end of the grid line), then go ahead and pick both points 
(Figure 2-1 .6). 
10. Draw the remaining grid lines shown in Figure 2-1.6. Again, do not worry about the 
exact location of the grid lines, just make sure the ends align with each other.

the reference line (i.e., the exterior wall face); and then you select the item to move (i.e., the 
grid line). This tool works on many Revit objects!

Notice that while the dimension string is selected, you see an EQ symbol with a slash 
through it. This symbol indicates that the individual components of the dimension string are 
not equal in length. The next step will show you how easy it is to make these dimensions 
equal! 
27. With the dimension string selected, click the ஺ symbol located near the middle of 
the dimension. 
The grid lines are now equally spaced (Figure 2-1.1 0) and this relationship will be maintained 
until the EQ symbol is selected again to toggle the "dimension equality" feature off. 
NOTE: When dimension equaliry is turned of or the dimension is deleted the grid line wiD not mot·e back 
to its original location; Retit does not remember where the grid was. 
Typically, you would not want to click the padlock icons here because that would lock the 
current dimension and make it so the grid lines could not be moved at all.

Next you will add an "overall building" dimension from grid line 1 to grid line 3. This 
dimension can be used to drive the overall size of your building (all the time, keeping grid 
line 2 equally spaced). 
28. Using the Aligned Dimension tool, add a dimension from grid line 1 to grid line 3 
and then pick to position the dimension line (Figure 2-1.1 1).

Quick Start: Small Office 
When using a dimension to drive the location of geometry, you need to select the item you 
want to move and then select the dimension text to enter the new value. You cannot just 
select the dimension because Revit does not know whether you want the left, right or both 
grid lines to move. The only thing you can do, graphically, by selecting the dimension 
directly is "lock" that dimension by clicking on the padlock symbol and then click the blue 
dimension text to add a suffix if desired. Next you will adjust the overall building size. 
29. Click Modify (or press the Esc key twice) to make sure you cancel or finish the 
Dimension tool and that nothing is selected. 
30. Select grid line 3. 
31. With grid line 3 selected, click the dimension text and type 101 and then press Enter. 
FYI: Notice that Rerit assumes fiet if you do not protide a foot or inch symboL

Your project should now look similar to Figure 2-1.12. You should notice that dimensions 
must "touch" two or more items (the grid lines in this case). Also, because the walls where 
aligned and locked to the grids, moving the grids caused the walls to move. 
The last thing you will do before moving on to the interior walls is to swap out the generic 
walls with a more specific wall. This would be a common situation in a design firm; a generic 
wall is added as a "place holder" until the design is refined to the point where the exterior 
wall system is selected. 
The process for swapping a wall is very simple: select the wall and pick a different type from 
the Type S eler-tor. The next steps will do this, but will also show you how to quickly select all 
the exterior walls so you can change them all at once! 
33. Click Modify and then hover your cursor over one of the exterior walls so it pre­
highlights. (Do not click yet.) 
34. With an exterior 1vall pre-highlighted, take your hand off the mouse and tap the Tab key 
until all four walls pre-highlight. 
FYI: The Tab kry rydes through the t-arious items below your c-ursor. The c-urrent options should indude: 
one wall, a c-hain of walls, and a grid line. 
35. With all four 1valls pre-highlighted: click to select them. 
36. With all four 1valls seler-ted· pick Basir-· Wall Exterior - Brick on CMU from the

to specify which part of the wall you want to dimension to (center, face, core center, core 
face).

At this point you need to pick two points: a "copy from here" point and a "copy to there" 
point. The first point does not have to be directly on the elements(s) to be copied. The next 
step will demonstrate this; you will pick the midpoint of the wall adjacent to the two doors 
(first pick) and then you will pick the midpoint of the wall where you want a set of doors 
(second pick). With "multiple" checked, you can continue picking "second points" until you 
are finished making copies (pressing Esc or Modifj to end the command). 
17. Pick three points: 
a. First pick: midpoint/ centerline of wall (see 
Figure 2-2.8); 
b. Second pick: midpoint/ centerline of wall 
shown in Figure 2-2.9; 
c. Third pick: midpoint/ centerline of wall shown 
in Figure 2-2.9.

Tag All (Not Tagged): 
Revit provides a command to quickly add a tag (e.g., a door tag) to any door that does not 
currently have one in the current view. The tag might have to be moved or rotated once 
placed, but this still saves time and the possibility of missing a door tag.

Deleting Doors: 
All the doors should now be tagged in 
your floor plan. 
FYI: Door tags can be deleted at any time and 
added again later at a'!)' time. Tags simpfy displqy 
information in the element being tagged - thus, no 
information about the element is being deleted; the 
building information integrity remains intact. 
Next you will learn how to delete a door when needed. This process will work for most 
elements (i.e., walls, windows, text, etc.) in Revit. 
22. Click Modify. 
23. Click on door number 7 (the door on the left, not the door tag) and press the 
Delete key on your keyboard. 
As you can see, the door is deleted and the wall is automatically filled back in. Also, a door 
tag can only exist by being attached to a door; therefore the door tag was also deleted. 
One last thing to observe: Revit numbers the doors in the order in which they have been 
placed (regardless of level). Doors are not automatically renumbered when one is deleted. 
Also, doors can be renumbered to just about anything you want. 
24. Save your project (Small Oifir-·e.nt).

The windows will not adjust with the grid lines and interior walls; it is possible to add 
dimensions and get this to work. If you tried to change the overall dimension from 11 0' to 
40' again, Revit would let you know it needed to delete some windows before the change 
could be made. Like doors, windows need their host to exist. 
The windows can all be adjusted via the temporary dimensions. The window selected is the 
largest width available in the project (based on the template file from which the project was 
started), but it is not a masonry dimension. However, additional window sizes can be added 
on the fly at any time. Additionally, you can create your own template file that has the doors, 
windows, walls, etc. that you typically need for the kind of design work you do. 
In addition to the preloaded windows, several window styles are available via the family 
library loaded on your hard drive and the Autodesk Web Library (e.g., dbl-hung, casement, 
etc.). It is also possible to create just about any window design in the Famify Editor. 
Object Snap Symbols: 
By now you should be well aware of the snaps that Revit suggests as you move your cursor about 
the drawing window. 
If you hold your cursor still for a moment 
while a snap symbol is displayed, a tooltip 
will appear on the screen. However, when 
you become familiar with the snap symbols 
you can pick sooner (Figure 2-3.4) . 
The TAB key cycles through the available 
snaps near your cursor. 
The keyboard shortcut turns off the other 
snaps for one pick. For example, if you 
type SE on the keyboard while in the Wall 
command, Revit will only look for an 
endpoint for the next pick. 
Finally, typing SO (snaps off) turns all 
snaps off for one pick.

You will now add a simple roof to your building. 
1. Open Small Office.rvt created in Exercise 2-3. 
The first thing you will do is take a quick look at a 3D view of your building and notice an 
adjustment that needs to be made to the exterior walls. 
2. Click the Default 3D View icon on the QAT. 
The 3D icon switches you to the default 3D view in the current project. Your view should 
look similar to Figure 2-4.1. Notice the exterior walls are not high enough, which is due to a 
previous decision to set the wall height to 9' -0". Next you will change this, which can be 
done in the plan view or the current 3D view. 
FIGURE 2-4.1 30 view of small office 
3. In the 3D view, hover your cursor over one of the exterior walls to pre-highlight it, 
then (before clicking) press the Tab key to pre-highlight a "chain of walls" (i.e., all 
the exterior walls), and then click to select them. 
2-28 

Quick Start: Small Office 
Next you will access the properties of the selected walls so you can adjust the wall height. In 
Revit, most any design decisions that are made can be adjusted at any time. 
4. Change the following in the Properties Palette: 
a. Top Constraint: Up to level: Roof 
b. Top O.fiet: 2' -0" 
c. Click Apply (Figure 2-4.2B). 
FIGURE 2-4.2A Exterior wall heights adjusted 
Setting the top of wall to be associated with 
a Lezoel establishes a parametric relationship 
that causes the wall height to automatically 
adjust if the level datum is adjusted (e.g., 
from 12'-0" to 14'-0"). 
Plus, the Top O.fiet at 2' -0" creates a 2' -0" 
parapet, which will always be 2' -0" high no 
matter what the roof elevation is set to. 
There are instances when you would want 
the height to be fixed. 
Al of the settings related to the selected 
wall show up here, these are called instance 
parameters.

Sketching a Roof: 
Now that the exterior walls are the correct height, you will now add 
the roof. This building will have a flat roof located at the roof level.

b. Press Tab to select a "Chain ofWalls" (i.e., all the exterior walls). 
c. Click to select the exterior walls. 
2-30 

At this point you should have four magenta 
lines, one on each wall, which represent the 
perimeter of the roof you are creating. When 
sketching a roof footprint, you need to make 
sure that lines do not overlap and comers are 
cleaned up with the Trim command if required. 
Your sketch lines require no additional edits 
because of the way you added them (i.e., Pick 
walls and Tab select). 
Before you finish the roof sketch you need to 
adjust the level on which the roof will be 
created. By default, the top surface of the roof 
element will be parametrically aligned with the 
current level (i.e., Level l in this case). You will 
change this to the roof level.

Adding text is very simple in Revit. In this exercise you will add a title below the floor plan. 
You will also place room tags. 
Placing Text: 
1. Open Small Office.rvt created in Exercise 2-4. 
2. Make sure your current view is Level l The word "Level 1" will be bold under the 
Floor Plans heading in your Projer-t BrOJvser. If Level 1 is not current, simply double­
click on the Level 1 text in the Projed BrOJvser. 
3. Select Annotate 7 Text 7 Text tool on the Ribbon.

Text 
The Type Seler-torindicates the text style (which determines the font style, height and more); 
users can create additional text styles. From this Contextual Tab, on the Ribbon, your 
alignment (i.e., Left justified, Centered or Right justified) can also be set. 
4. Set the Ribbon settings to match those shown above, Click below the floor plan to 
place the text (Figure 2-5.2). 
5. Type OFFICE BUILDING - Option A, then click somewhere in the plan view to 
finish the text (do not press Entei). 
The text height, in the Type S  eler-tor, refers to the size of the text on a printed piece of paper. 
For example, if you print your plan you should be able to place a ruler on the text and read 
'//' when the text is set to '//' in the Type S eler-tor. 
Text size can be a complicated process in CAD programs; Revit makes it very simple. All 
you need to do is change the view scale for Level l and Revit automatically adjusts the text 
and annotation to match that scale - so it always prints '//' tall on the paper.

You will not change the scale now, but it can be 
done via the VieJv Control Bar (Figure 2-5.3). If you 
want to try changing it, just make sure it is set back 
to 'Is" = 1 '-0" when done. 
You should now notice that your text and even 
your door and window symbols are half the size 
they used to be when changing from 'Is" to '1/'. 
You should understand that this scale adjustment 
will only affect the current view (i.e., Level 1). If 
you switched to Level 2 (if you had one) you would 
notice it is still set to 'ls"=1'-0". This is nice 
because you may, on occasion, want one plan at a 
larger scale to show more detail.

Placing Room Tags must be preceded by placing a Room. A Room element is used to define a 
space and hold information about a space (e.g., floor finish, area, department, etc.). See this 
author's article in the AUGI AEC-Edge magazine for a detailed discussion on this topic 
(ww.AUGI.com). Like a Door Tag, a Room Tag simply lists information contained within the 
element being tagged. 
The Room feature searches for areas enclosed by walls; a valid area is 
pre-highlighted before you click to create it. 
By default, Revit will automatically place a Room Tag at the cursor 
location when you click to add the Room element. 
6. Select Architecture -7 Room & Area -7 Room. 
7. Set the Tjpe Seiedorto Room Tag: Room Tag 
With Area and make sure Tag on placement is 
selected on the Ribbon. 
8. Click within each room in the order shown in 
Figure 2-5.4; watch for the dashed reference line 
to align the tags.

While the Room tool is active, the placed rooms in the model are shaded light blue so you can 
see which spaces already have rooms placed. The large "X" is also part of the room. When 
the Room tool is not active, you can hover the cursor over the approximate location of the 
"X" until it pre-highlights, then you can click to select the room. With the Room object 
selected you can add information or delete it via the Properties Palette. 
9. Click Modify to end the current tool. 
Notice the rooms are not visible and the "X" is gone. Also notice, the Room Tag selected 
shows the following information stored within the Room object: Name, Number and Area. 
FYI: The area updates automaticallY when the walls mot·e. Next you will change the room names. 
10. Click on the Room Tag for room number 1 to select it. 
When a Room Tag is selected the "dark blue" text is editable and the "lighter blue" text is not. 
An example of text that cannot be edited would be the actual text "Sheet Number" next to 
the sheet number on a sheet border. 
11. Click on the room name text, type OFFICE, and then press Enter on the keyboard. 
12. Change rooms 2-4 to also be named OFFICE. 
13. Change the large room name to LOBBY. 
14. Leave two rooms (5 and 6) as "Room" for now. 
Schedules: 
The template you started your project from had room and door schedules set up. So from 
the first door and room you placed, these schedules started filling themselves out! You will 
take a quick look at this to finish out this section. 
15. In the Projed Browser, click the "+" symbol next to Schedules/ Quantities to expand that 
section (if required) and then double-dick on Room Schedule to open that view. 
The room schedule is a tabular view of the Revit model. This information is "live" and can 
be changed (Figure 2-5.5).

Printer Versus Plotter? 
Revit can print to any printer or plotter installed on your computer. 
A Printer is an output device that uses smaller paper (e.g., 8'/z"x1 1" or 1 1"x17''). A Plotter is 
an output device that uses larger paper; plotters typically have one or more rolls of paper 
ranging in size from 18" wide to 36" wide. A roll feed plotter has a built-in cutter that can ­
for example - cut paper from a 36" wide roll to make a 24"x36" sheet.

Lesson 3 
Office Building: FLOOR PLAN (First Floor):: 
In this lesson you will draw the first floor plan of an office building. The office building will 
be further developed in subsequent chapters. It is recommended that you spend adequate 
time on this lesson as later lessons build on this one. 
A program statement is created in the pre-design phase of a project. Working with the client 
(or user group), the architect gathers as much information as possible about the project 
before starting to design. 
The information gathered includes: 
• Rooms: What rooms are required? 
• Size: How big the rooms need to be? (E.g., toilets for a convention center are much 
bigger than for a dentist's office.) 
• Adjacencies: This room needs to be next to that room. (E.g., the public toilets need to 
be accessible from the public lobby.) 
With the project statement in hand, the architect can begin the design process. Although 
modifications may (and will) need to be made to the program statement, it is used as a goal 
to meet the client's needs. 
You will not have a program statement, per se, with this project. However, the same 
information will be provided via step-by-step instructions in this book. 
Project Overview: 
You will model a three-story office building located in a rural setting. Just to the North of 
the building site is a medium-sized lake. For the sake of simplicity, the property is virtually 
flat. 
The main entry and parking is 
from the south side of the 
building. You enter the building 
into a three-story atrium. Levels 2 
and 3 have guard railings that look 
down into Level 1 in the atrium. 
The atrium is enclosed on three 
sides by full height curtain walls 
(glass walls). See the image on the 
front cover.

This building is not meant to meet any particular building code. It is strictly a tool to learn 
how to use Revit. Having said that, however, there are several general comments as to how 
codes may impact a particular part of the design. 
The floor plans are mostly open office areas with a few smaller rooms for toilets, private 
offices, work and break rooms, etc. These areas have several "punched" window openings 
on the exterior walls (punched as opposed to ribbon windows).

Office Building: FLOOR PLAN (First Floor) 
You will begin the first floor plan by drawing the exterior walls. Like many projects, early on 
you might not be certain what the exterior walls are going to be. So, we will start out using 
the generic wall styles. Then we will change them to a custom wall style (that you will create) 
once we have decided what the wall construction is. 
Adjust Wall Settings:

Create a Custom Wall Style: 
Revit provides several predefined wall styles, from metal studs with gypsum board to 
concrete block and brick cavity walls. However, you will occasionally need a wall style that 
has not yet been predefined by Revit. You will study this feature next. 
First, you will take a quick look at a more complex wall type that Revit provides so you can 
see how they are set up. 
4. With the Wall tool selected, pick the 
wall type: Basic Wail.· Exterior - Brick 
on CMU, from the Tjpe S eiedor drop­
down list. (See image at right.) 
5. Click the Edit Type button on the 
Properties Palette (Fig. 3-2.3). 
6. You should be in the Tjpe Prope1ties

Here, the Edit Assemb!J dialog box allows you to change the composition of an existing wall 
or to create a new wall. 
Things to notice in the EditAssemb!J dialog box (Figure 3-2.5): 
The exterior side is labeled at the top and interior side at the bottom. 
You will see horizontal rows (i.e., Core Boundary) identifying the core material. The 
core material can be used to place walls and dimension walls. For example: the Wall 
tool will let you draw a wall with the interior or exterior core face as the reference 
line. On an interior wall you would typically dimension to the face of CMU rather 
than to the finished face of gypsum board. This is to work out coursing and give the 
contractor the information needed for the part of the wall he will build first. 
• 
Each row is called a layer. By clicking on a layer and picking the Up or Down 
buttons, you can reposition materials, or layer, within the wall assembly. 
8. Click Cancel in each open dialog box to close them. 
9. Set the wall style back to Basic WaiL· Generic - 12" in the Tjpe Seiedor. 
10. Click the Edit Type button again on the Properties Palette. 
11. Click Duplicate. 
12. Enter Brick & CMU cavity wall for the new wall type name, and then click OK

Masonry is typically drawn nominally in plans and smaller scaled details. This helps to figure 
out coursing for both drawing and dimensioning. For example, 8" concrete block is actually 
75/s". 
Also, notice that the CMU, Rigid Insulation, Air Space and Brick add up to 16" in thickness. 
This portion of the wall would sit on a 16" concrete block (CMU) foundation wall directly 
below.

The next step is to change the wall type for the walls previously drawn. 
15. Select the Modify button on the Ribbon; this allows you to select elements in your 
drawing. 
16. Zoom out so you can see the entire plan. Dragging your mouse from one comer to 
the other, make a window over the plan to select all the walls. 
17. With the walls selected, pick Basic WaiL· Brick & CMU cavity wall from the T)pe 
Seledor drop down. 
TIP: If, after selecting all the walls, the Type Selector is not actiroe and does not show a'!)' wall rypes,you probabfy 
har·e some other elements selected such as text or dimensions. Try to find those elements and delete them (except the 
eler·ation tags). You can also click on the Filter button (located on the Ribbon when objects are selected) and 
uncheck the types of elements to exclude from the current selection. 
You should notice the wall thickness change, but the 
wall cavity lines and hatch are not showing yet. This is 
controlled by the Detail Let·el option for each view. 
18. Click on Detail Level icon in the lower-left 
comer of the Drmving WindOJv, on the VieJv 
Control Bar. 
19. Select Medium.

You should now see the brick and CMU thicknesses with hatching. If you did not pay 
attention when drawing the walls originally, some of your walls may show the brick to the 
inside of the building. 
,] 
20. Select Modify (or press Esc); select a wall. You will see a symbol appear that allows 
you to flip the wall orientation by clicking on that symbol (Figure 3-2.9).

21 . Whether you need to adjust walls or not, click on the flip symbol to experiment with 
its operation. 
TIP: The Flip symbol is alwqys on the exterior side (or what Rerit thinks is the exterior side) of the walL 
22. If some walls do need to be adjusted so the brick is to the exterior, do it now. You 
will probably have to select the wall(s) and use the Moz·e tool to reposition the walls 
to match the required dimensions. 
TIP: Ifyou set the "location line", ria the Properties Palette, to "Wall Centerline" the wall will not mor·e 
and mess up the or·erall dimensions when flipping it. You will want to set the "location line" back to Finish 
Face: Exterior when done. 
23. Save your Project as ex3-2.rvt .

TIP: You can use the MOVE tool Move on the Ribbon (Jvhen a 1vall is selected) to aa:uratefy move Jvalls. 
Follmv these steps to move an object: 
• 
Select the 1vall 
• 
Click the Move tool 
• 
Pick a'!Y point on the 1vall 
• 
Start your cursor in the desired direction (don 't dick) 
• 
Start ryping the distance you 1vant to move the 1vall and press Enter. 
Finally, you will change the three walls at the atrium to be curtain walls (full glass). This will 
let lots of light into the atrium and better identify the main entry of the building. 
24. Drag a selection window (from left to right) to select the three walls around the 
atrium, or hold the Ctrl key on the keyboard and select them. 
25. With the walls selected, select Curtain WaiL· Curtain Wall l from the Tjpe Seledor 
drop-down. 
Your atrium is now surrounded by curtain walls (Figure 3-2.10). In a later lesson we will add 
horizontal and vertical mullions to the curtain wall. 
You can see your progress nicely with a 3D view. Click the 3D View button on 
the QAT. Notice that Revit shows the curtain wall as transparent because it 
knows the curtain wall is glass. The other walls are shaded on the exterior side 
due to the brick pattern that is applied. 
26. Save your project as ex3-2.rvt.

In this lesson you will draw the interior walls for the first floor. 
Adjust Wall Settings: 
1. Select Architecture -7 Build -7 Wall from the Ribbon. 
2. Make the following changes to the wall options on the Ribbon, Options Bar and Tjpe

Architectural Commercial Design Using Autodesk Revit 2014 
5. Create the same wall for the West side of the atrium 
repeating the above steps. 
Modify an Existing Wall Type: 
Next you will add some additional interior walls. You will be 
drawing 8" CMU walls. Revit does have an 8" Masonry wall type 
available in the default template file that you started your project 
from. However, the thickness for this wall type is 7%", which is the 
actual size of a block. Floor plans are usually drawn nominally (i.e., 
8") not actual (7%'). This is done so you can figure out coursing so 
minimal cutting is required. Therefore, rather than creating a new 
wall type you can simply modify the existing wall type. 
Note: some may disagree with this approach. However, these 
changes should still be made to this project so you learn more about 
how walls work and so all the tasks in this book work as expected 
or intended. 
6. Select the wall type: Basic WalL- Generic - 8" Masonry. 
v v  
FIGURE 3-3.2 
7. Select the Edit Type button on the Properties Palette to view the wall's Tjpe Parameters, 
and then click Edit next to the Strudure parameter. 
8. Change the masonry thickness from 7%" to 8" in the Edit Assemb!J dialog box, and 
then select OK to close each dialog (do not close the Properties Palette). 
Occasionally Revit will not list dimensions, relative to the walls you want to draw new walls 
from, while in the create wall mode. One way to deal with this is to draw temporary Detail 
Unes to use as a reference. After using the temporary line as a reference you can delete it. 
9. Select Annotate -7 Detail -7 Detail Line from 
the Ribbon; the line type does not really matter, but 
select a continuous one via the Type Seledor. 
10. Draw the "vertical" line shown in Figure 3-3.3; be 
sure to snap to the Midpoint of the atrium wall as 
your first point. 
Next you will draw an elevator shaft, centered on the atrium and 35'-0" back (thus the temp. 
line). 
The inside dimensions of the elevator are: 7'-4" x 6'-10". Because you know the inside 
dimension you will want to adjust the location line to match the known info. 
1 1 .  Use the Wall tool to draw Basir: WalL- Generic - 8" Masonry. 
3-12 

Office Building: FLOOR PLAN (First Floor) 
12. Set the Location Une to: Finish Face: Interior. 
13. Draw the elevator shaft. 
Make sure the location 
line is to the inside so your 
shaft is the correct 
dimension. Draw the shaft 
anywhere in the Drmving 
WindOJv; you will adjust the 
exact position next. 
FYI: The inside dimensions are 
listed aboroe. 
14. Select the 4 walls that 
represent the elevator 
shaft, and then pick the

TIP: Concrete blocks come in r·arious widths, and most are 16// long and 8 //high. When drawing plans 
there is a simple rule to keep in mind to make sure you are designing walls to coursing. This applies to wall 
lengths and openings within CMU walls. 
Dimension rules for CMU coursing in floor plans: 
• e'-0 " or e'B " 
where e is a'!)' er·en number (e.g., 6'-0 "or 24 '-8 ) 
• o '4 " 
where o is a'!)' odd number (e.g., 5'4 )  
15. Snap to the Midpoint of the shaft as your first point, and then snap to the Middle 
Endpoint of your temporary detail line (Figure 3-3.4). You should zoom in to verify 
your snaps. Do not draw the dimensions, they are for reference only.

Modify an Existing Wall: 
Next we want to change the portion of wall between the building and the East and West 
stair shafts. To do this you will need to split the current wall, trim the corners and then draw 
an 8" masonry wall. 
17. Zoom in on the West stair shaft and select the Split tool 
(Modijj tab on the Ribbon).

We decide that the stair shafts are mostly utilitarian and do not require gypsum board on the 
walls. In the next steps you will create a new exterior wall type just like the one previously 
created less the gypsum board and metal studs. Also, you will create a custom wall type to 
close the open side we created in the previous steps. This wall type will have gypsum board 
and metal studs on one side. 
20. Using wall type: Basir: Wall Brir:k & CMU mtiry Jvall as a starting point, create a new 
wall type named Brick & CMU cavity wall (no GWB). Remove the gypsum board 
and metal studs and save the new wall type. (Remember to dir-k Duplimte.) 
21 . Change the three exterior walls around the west stair shaft to the new wall type 
created in the previous step. 
3-15 

Architectural Commercial Design Using Autodesk Revit 2014 
22. Using wall type: Basic WalL- Brick & CMU cmity Jvall as a starting point, create a new 
wall type named 8" Masonry with GWB 1S. Remove the brick, air space and rigid 
insulation and save the new wall type (Figure 3-3.7). 
FYI: It will be useful to come up with a standard naming system for your custom wall types. If the names 
get to long thry are hard to read. The example abor·e has: 
• GWB = Gypsum Wall Board (and would imp!J studs) 
• 1 S =finish on!J occurs on one side of the walL

30. Using the Wall tool, set the wall type to: Basic WalL- Interior - 4 7 /8" partition 
(1-hr) 
31. Draw the additional walls shown in Figure 3-3.11. Make sure to position the walls 
per the dimensions shown. Use the Measure tool to verify accuracy. Also, modify the 
Location IJne as required. 
DRAWING TIPS: Copy the existing atrium wal/6'4'/s "or·er (6'-0 "plus one wall thickness), draw a wallfrom the 
midpoint of the eler·ator shaft with centerline reforence {lflcation Line), and use the Trim and Mirror tools. Do not

This lesson will show you how to insert an elevator into your elevator shaft. 
Insert Elevator: 
Revit provides many Families, which are predefined elements ready to insert into your 
project. However, many elements are not readily available, like elevators for example. You 
will get an elevator family online in this exercise. The online library is where you will acquire 
an elevator family for use in your project. 
1. Open project ex3-3.rvt and Save As ex3-4.rvt. 
You will have to download the elevator from the web. Of rxJurse you Jvill need to be wnneded to the 
Internet. 
2. Click on the Insert tab on the Ribbon. 
3. Type in Elevator-Electric and then press Enter (Figure 3-4.1).

You now see a larger preview of the family, in the plan view in this case (Figure 3-4.3). Next 
you need to select which version of content you want to download. Revit is not backwards 
compatible so you cannot download a newer version of content than the version of Revit 
you have. However, you can download older content and Revit will automatically upgrade it 
anytime you try using it. NOTE: When a newer r·ersion is not at'ailable,just use the newest r-ersion posted.

18. Drag the 2000 lbs elevator type from the Projed BrOJvser into the first floor plan. 
FYI: You can also use the Component tool from the Architedure tab to place the eler·ator. 
The elevator type will be attached to your cursor, ready for insertion. 
19. Move your cursor within the elevator shaft and adjust it until the elevator "snaps" in 
place; then click (Figure 3-4.1 0). 
20. Press Esc twice to tell Revit you are finished placing elevators. 
Now you have to add an elevator door in the shaft walls at each level; this is similar to a 
regular door in a wall. Like the elevator, the elevator door has to be downloaded from the 
internet. You will do that next. 
21 . Similar to the steps previously covered, load the Elevator Door - Center family 
from the Seek.Autodesk.com website (Figure 3-4.8).

Office Building: FLOOR PLAN (First Floor) 
This lesson will take a closer look at inserting doors and windows. 
Insert Doors: 
Revit has done an excellent job providing several different door families. This makes sense 
seeing as doors are an important part of an architectural project. Some of the provided 
families include bi-fold, double, pocket, sectional (garage), and vertical rolling, to name a 
few. In addition to the families found on your local hard drive, many more are available via 
Seek.Autodesk.com as well as other internet sites (some free some not). 
The default template you started with only provides the Sgl Flush (Single Flush) group in 
the Doors category. If you want to insert other styles you will need to load them from the 
library. The reason for this step is that, when you load a family, Revit actually copies the data 
into your project file. If every possible family was loaded into your project at the beginning, 
not only would it be hard to find what you want in a large list of doors, but also the files 
would be several megabytes in size before you even drew the first wall. 
You will begin this section by loading a few additional families into your project. 
1. Open project ex3-4.rvt and Save-As ex3-5.rvt. 
2. From the Insert tab, select the Load Family button on the Ribbon (Figure 3-5.1). 
3. Browse through the US Imperial library folder for a moment.

4. Open the Doors folder and then select Curtain Wall Dbl Glass.rfa, and then click 
Open. (Figure 3-5.2) 
5. Repeat steps 2 - 4  to load the following door families: 
a. Double-Glass 1 
b. Sidelights 1 
c. Single-Glass 1 
6. In the Projed BrOJvser, expand Families and Doors to 
see the loaded door families (Figure 3-5.3). 
If you expand a door family itself in the Projed BrOJvseryou 
see the predefined door sizes associated with that family. 
Right-clicking on a door size allows you to rename, delete 
or duplicate it To add a door size you duplicate and then 
modify properties for the new item. 
Next you will insert the doors into the stair shafts.

7. Select the Door tool from the Architedure tab and then pick Sgl Flush: 36" x 84" 
from the Tjpe S eledor on the Properties Palette. 
8. Insert two doors in the West stair shaft as shown in Figure 3-5.4. Remember you are 
inserting a door into a masonry wall so your door position and size need to work 
with coursing. Thus the 8" dimension (however, you would also need to include the 
door frame into the equation). 
9. Repeat the previous step to insert doors into the East stair shaft. 
10. Finish inserting doors for the first floor (Figure 3-5.5). 
Use the following guidelines: 
a. Al doors should be 36" wide and 7' -0" tall. 
b. You will not insert doors into the curtain wall for now. You will do that in a 
later lesson when you design the curtain wall. 
c. Use the style and approximate location shown in Figure 3-5.5. 
d. Doors across from each other in the two atrium walls should align with each 
other. 
TIP: While inserting the se(()nd set of doors, watch/ wait for the reference line to show up, 
indicating alignment. 
e. Place doors approximately as shown, exact location not given.

Door Properties: 
If you select Edit Type while the 
Door tool is active (selected), 
you can modify various 
properties related to the door. 
You can easily add another 
standard door size to the Fami!J 
as required. Click "Duplicate," 
type a name (Figure 3-5.6) . 
Standard doors sizes (and 
Families) can be added to your 
template file, so you don't have 
to load them for every new 
project. 

Office Building: FLOOR PLAN (First Floor) 
Insert Windows: 
Adding windows to your project is very similar to adding doors. Like the doors, the template 
file you started from has one family preloaded into your project, the FIXED family. Looking 
at the Tjpe S eledor drop-down you will see the various sizes available for insertion. At this 
point you should also see the SIDELIGHT family that you loaded in the previous exercise. 
First, you will add a few interior borrowed lights using the sidelight family. 
Interior Windows (Borrowed Lights): 
11. With the Windou; tool selected, 
pick: Sidelights 1 : 18" x 84" from 
the Tjpe S eledor. 
12. On the West side of the atrium, 
insert the borrowed lights as 
shown in Figure 3-5.7; do not 
add the dimensions. 
-
-
Make sure the borrowed light frames are 
C.O 
flush with the atrium side of the wall. 
You can control that option by moving 
your cursor to the side of the wall you 
want the frame flush with before clicking 
to insert. After drawing the window, you 
can select the frame and use the flip icon 
(similar to doors and walls). 
13. Repeat the previous steps to 
insert the borrowed lights on the 
East side of the atrium.

Exterior Windows: 
14. Using the methods previously covered in this book; create a new window size in the 
FIXED family. Create: Fixed: 32" x 48". You are creating this new size to fit coursing 
in the plan view. The largest window (preloaded) that fits coursing in the plan view is

Lesson 4 
Office Building: FLOOR PLAN (2nd and 3rd Floors):: 
In this lesson you will setup the upper two floors. This will mostly involve copying elements 
from the first floor with some modifications along the way. You will also adjust the floor-to­
floor height and insert stairs into the stair shafts. 
Common Walls from First Floor 
Setting Up the Second (and Third) Floor View: 
The first thing you need to do is make a few adjustments to the second (and third) floor 
settings. The default template you started your project from already has a second floor view 
setup in the project. The third floor has not been set up, so you will do that. 
1. Open Exercise ex3-5.rvt and Save-As 
ex4-1.rvt. 
2. In the Projed Bro1vse1Ɛ double-dick on 
the Level 2 view under Floor Plans 
(Figure 4-1.1). 
The current view is always bold in the Projed 
Br01vser. 
You should now see the second floor plan. 
Notice that the dark wall lines, shown in this 
view, exist at this level. The light gray lines 
are walls for the floor below. (Figure 4-1.2) 
You will turn off the view of the lower level 
and set the Detail Let·el to show more detail 
in the walls.

FIGURE 4-1.3 Level 2 with 
view properties modified 

Office Building: FLOOR PLAN (Second and Third Floors) 
Because the walls and doors you will copy from the first floor are set up to extend to the 
floor above, you need to setup the third floor before you copy the walls from first to second 
(so the second floor walls have a floor to extend to). 
Adding another floor is surprisingly simple. You switch to an elevation view and draw in a 
Let·el datum. By doing that Revit automatically sets up a Level 3 view in the Prqjed BrOJvser. 
6. Double-dick on one of the four elevation views listed under Elet-ations in the Prqjed 
BrOJvser. If you do not see your drawing in elevation, try another view and/ or see the 
tip below. 
7. With an elevation in the drawing window, select Modifj and then 
select Architecture -7 Datum -7 Level on the Ribbon. 
8. As you move your cursor near the Level 2 symbol you will see a 
level 
dimension displayed, indicating the distance between Level 2 floor and Level 3 floor 
you are about to insert. For now, set Level 3 to be 10' -0" above Level 2 (Figure 4-
1.4). 
a. Pick two points Oeft to right) to draw the Lml datum. 
b. Make sure you see the "alignment" reference lines before picking the two 
points, so it aligns with the other levels.

This is cvt-ered more thorough!J in Lesson 7. 
Next you will copy walls and doors from the first floor. 
9. Switch to the Level l view (see step 2). 
10. Select all the interior walls (except the elevator shaft), doors and interior windows.

Notice the walls, doors and interior windows are now copied to Level 2 (Figure 4-1.5). We 
still need to copy the exterior windows and the elevator door. 
Also, notice that the new doors have different numbers (note: you will only have tags on 
level 2 if they were selected in the copy / paste) while the interior windows have the same 
number. Why is this? It relates to industry standards for architectural documentation. Each 
interior window that is the same size and configuration has the same type number 
throughout the project (this is a Tjpe Parameter). Each door has a unique number because 
doors have so many variables such as locks, hinges, closer, panic bar, material, and fire rating 
(this is an Instance Parametei). To make doors easier to find, many architectural firms will 
make the door number the same as the room number the door opens into. You can change 
the door number by selecting the door tag and then clicking on the text. The door schedule 
will be updated automatically. 
14. Using the same techniques 
described in the previous steps, 
copy the exterior windows and 
elevator door to Level 2. 
TIP: You will need to ungroup your 
windows (grouped with arrqy) before copying 
them. Select one of the windows and pick the 
ungroup button on the Ribbon. 
Why not draw these interior walls 
36' -0" high like the exterior walls and 
elevator shaft? 
Simulating real-world construction is ideal 
for several reasons. Mostly, you can be 
sure shafts align from floor to floor when 
the shaft is one continuous wall. Although 
the toilet and atrium interior walls align, 
they do not necessarily have to because 
they are separated by floor construction, 
this allows one floor to be modified later 
easily.

Finally, you will copy several elements to Level 3. But first you need to change the height 
setting for the walls (on Level 2) before you paste them to Level 3 because there is nothing 
above (yet) to extend the walls to (e.g., roof or floor). 
15. In the Level 2 view, select all the interior walls, doors and windows (except the 
elevator shaft). 
You need to narrow your selection down to just 
the walls. 
16. Select the Filter button on the

This short exercise will help reinforce the commands you have already learned. You will add 
walls and openings to your project. 
Adding Walls: 
1. Add the interior walls and doors to Level l as shown in Figure 4-2.1. Use the stud 
wall you used previously. Use the Align tool to align the walls, which are not 
dimensioned, with the adjacent walls previously drawn. 
FYI: Doors are not labeled to be single flush. Also, dimensions are to centerline of interior walls and to the 
finished face of the exterior walls.

TIP: Ifyou use the Trim tool (per the TIP in Figure 4-2.3),you will need to seled "Delete Instance" to tell 
Rerit to delete the doorfrom the portion of wall that is being deleted. 
FYI: Your modifications to let'el 3 included adding a few executit·e ofices to the top floor with the "good" 
tiews. You deleted the small ofice on the south side to make room for a reception desk at the main doors from 
the atrium. IdeallY you would add windows to the interior walls of the executitoe offices to let borrowed light 
into the open ofice area. The center area will be open office area for executit'e assistants. You will add doors 
to the stair shaft in Exenise 44, when you add the stairs.

You will modify the building's floor-to-floor height in this lesson. The reasons for doing this 
vary. Some examples might be to make the building shorter or taller to accommodate 
ductwork in the ceilings or the depth of the floor structure (the longer the span the deeper 
the structure). The default floor-to-floor height in the template file you started from is 10'-
0", which is not typically feasibly for commercial construction. 
Don't forget to keep a backup of your files on a separate disk (i.e., Flash Drive, CD or 
DVD). Your project file should be about 3 MB when starting this exercise. Remember, your 
Revit project is one large file (not many small files). You do not want anything to happen to 
it! 
Modify the Building's Floor-to-Floor Height: 
1. Open ex4-2.rvt, Save As ex4-3.rvt. 
2. Open the South exterior elevation from the Prqjed BrOJvser. 
Next you will change the floor-to­
floor height to be 12'-0" for each 
level. 
3. Select the Level 2 level datum, 
and then select the text 
displaying the elevation. You 
should now be able to type in 
a new number. Type 12 and 
then press Enter to see the 
changes. Notice the windows 
move because the sill height 
has not been changed. (Figure

Next you will add stairs to your East and West stair shafts. Revit provides a powerful Stair 
tool that allows you to design stairs quickly with various constraints predefined (i.e., 7" 
maximum riser). 
Type Parameters: 
Before you draw the stair it will be helpful to review the options available in the stair family. 
1. Open ex4-3.rvt and Save As ex4-4.rvt. 
2. From the Projed BrOJvser, expand the Families 7 Stairs 7 Stair (i.e., click the plus sign 
next to these labels). 
3. Right-dick on the stair type: 7" max riser 11" tread, and select the Type Properties 
option from the pop-up menu. 
You should now see the options shown in Figure 4-4.1. 
Take a couple minutes to see what options are available. You will quickly review a few 
below. 
• 
Tread: depth of tread in the plan 
v1ew. 
• 
Nosing Length (Depth): Treads are 
typically 12" deep (usually code min.) 
and 1" of that depth overlaps the next 
tread. This overlap is called the 
nos mg. 
• 
Riser: This provides Revit with the 
maximum dimension allowed (by 
code, or if you want it, less). The 
actual dimension will depend on the 
floor-to-floor height. 
• 
Stringer dimensions: These 
dimensions usually vary per stair 
depending on the stair width, run and 
materials, to name a few. A structural 
engineer would provide this 
information after designing the stair. 
• 
Cost: Estimating placeholder.

FIGURE 4-4.1 Stair type properties 

Architectural Commercial Design Using Autodesk Revit 2014 
Drawing the Stairs in Plan: 
You will be drawing a standard switch-back stair. At first, when using Revit to draw stairs, it 
may be helpful to figure out the number of risers and landings. That information will be 
helpful when drawing the stair. As you become more familiar with the Stair tool you will not 
need to do those calculations to draw a stair. Dividing the floor-to-floor height of 12'-0" by 
7" we get 20.57. Obviously you cannot have a fraction of a riser so you need to round up to 
21 (rounding down would make the riser higher than 7'}. Therefore, 12'-0" divided by 21 
equals 6.86". Thus you have 21 risers that are 6.86" high. Additionally, most codes would 
require a landing in a stair rising 12'-0". 
4. Make sure you are in the Level l floor plan view. 
5. Zoom in to the West stair shaft. 
6. Click on the Architecture tab on the Ribbon. 
7. Select the Stairs tool (circulation panel).

FYI: Retit has drawn the intermediate landings between lerels. Howerer, the landings at the main floor lerels hare not 
been created, but could be using the Landing option within the Stair tooL Some projects extend the primary floor 
structure into the stair shqft to act as the landingfor that lerel and also support the stair. In a later lesson you will 
draw a floor {}Stem that extends into the stair shqft. 
15. Repeat these steps for the East stair shaft. 
16. Add doors to the second and third floors for both the East and West stair shafts 
(interior doors only!). 
17. Save your project. 
The final stairs still need some work, but with just a few steps you have a nice placeholder. 
Revit will add railings to both sides of the stair by default (this can be turned off on the 
Ribbon while in the Stair tool). The railings are separate elements which are hosted to the 
stair, much like a door is hosted to a wall. You can select a railing and delete it without 
deleting the stair. But if the stair gets deleted, the railings must go.

Lesson 5 
Office Building: ROOF:: 
This lesson will look at some of the powerful 
options and tools for designing a roof for your 
building. You will also add skylights. 
The first step is to create a floor plan view at the roof level, at the top of your exterior 
masonry wall. This will create a working plane, called a level datum, for the Roqftoo!. 
Add Level Datum: 
1 .  Open ex4-4.rvt and Save As ex5-1.rvt. 
2. Open the South elevation view. 
3. Select Architecture 7 Datum 7 Level tool from the Ribbon. 
Level 
4. Draw a Let·el datum at the top of the exterior wall, at elevation 36'-0"; see the wall 
properties. Draw the datum "line" so both ends align with the other datum "lines" 
below it. 
Next, you will rename the level datum. By default Revit will name the level based on the 
previous level created, plus 1. Thus, the new level should be named "Level 4". You will 
change this name so you (and others working on the same project) know it is the top of the 
masonry view and not another floor in the building. 
5. Press Esc or select Modify from the Ribbon. 
6. Now select the level datum you just drew (click on the line). 
7. With the level datum selected, click on the ƚeve! name] text to rename the level label. 
8. Change the label to T.O. Masonry (Figure 5-1.1). 
FYI: T.O. means 'Top Of:

FIGURE 5-1.2 Rename prompt 
These steps are the same you used to add the third floor. Notice the 
"T.O. Masonry" label is now listed in the Floor Plans section of the 
Prqjed Brmvser. You can delete the T.O. Masonry ceiling plan if you'd like 
as it will not be needed; simply right-dick and select delete from the 
pop-up menu. 
Add a Hip Roof: 
10. Open the newly created T. 0. Masonry Floor Plan view. 
11. Select Architecture -7 Build -7 Roof (down-arrow). 
12. Select Roof by Footprint from the drop-down list. 
Before you start the roof you will change the slope (pitch) of the roof. 
5-2 
ri§ Roof by Extru si "" 
y Ro c.f by Face 
ϸ Ro eof: 5offit 
Ro cof㊜ Faᐄci a 

13. Click the Properties Filter drop down and 
select New <Sketch> as pointed out in Figure 
5-1.3. 
14. Make sure Defines Slope is checked and then 
change the Slope to 6" /12". Click Apply. 
This will make the roof pitch 6/12, which means; for 
every 12" horizontally the roof will rise 6" vertically. 
15. You are now prompted to select exterior walls 
to define the footprint. Select ONLY the wall 
segments that define the 120'-0" x 60'-0" 
portion of the building (Figure 5-1.4). 
Pick the exterior side of the walls. 
You will notice in Figure 5-1.4 that there are three 
sections along the perimeter of the rectangle that are 
open because no wall is available to pick. You will 
need to draw three lines to close the "footprint." 
Pick these walls with 
dots (dots not in 
Revit)

Office Building: ROOF 
This short exercise covers inserting skylights in your roof. The process is much like inserting 
windows. In fact, Revit lists the skylight types with the window types, so you use the WindOJv 
tool to insert skylights into your project. Technically, a skylight is a roof hosted window. 
Inserting Skylights: 
You will place the skylights in an elevation view. 
1. Load project file ex5-1.rvt. 
2. Switch to the South elevation view. 
3. Select the Window tool and load the skylight family (skylight.rfa) 
into the project (via the Loadfamify button on the Ribbon). 
4. Select Skylight: 24" x 27" from the Tjpe Seledor. 
Load 
Family 
You are now ready to place skylights in the roof. Revit will only look for roof elements when 
placing skylights, so you don't have to worry about a skylight ending up in a wall. 
5. Roughly place four skylights as shown in Figure 5-2.1.

6. Press Esc or click the Modify tool to cancel the WindOJv tool. 
Next, you will want to align the skylights with each other. 
7. Switch to the West elevation view. 
8. Select one of the visible skylights. 
You should now have the skylight selected and see the temporary dimensions that allow you 
to adjust the exact location of the element. Occasionally, the dimension does not go to the 
point on the model that you are interested in referencing from. Revit allows you to adjust 
where those temporary dimensions point to. 
9. Click and drag the grip shown in Figure 5-2.2 (wait until it snaps) to the ridge of the 
main roof (Figure 5-2.3).

move the tag down (Figure 5-2.5). 
14. Position the skylight tag so the tag does not 
overlap the skylight (Figure 5-2.6). 
15. Adjust the other skylight tags; as you 
reposition these tags you may see a reference 
line appear indicating the symbol will 
automatically align with an adjacent symbol. 
Take a minute to look at your shaded 3D view and 
try changing the view so you can see through the

In this lesson you will look at the various ways to use the Roqftool to draw the more 
common roof forms used in architecture today. 
Start a New Revit Project: 
You will start a new project for this lesson so you can quickly compare the results of using 
the Roqftool. 
1. Start a new project using the default.rte template. 
2. Switch to the North elevation view and rename the level named Let·el2 to T.O. 
Masonry. This will be the reference point for your roof. Click Yes to rename 
corresponding views automatically. 
TIP: Just seled the Level datum and dick on the lezoel

4. Set the Level 1 "Detail Let·el" to medium, so the 
material hatching is visible within the walls. 
TIP: Use the View Control Bar at the bottom. 
5. Using the Wall tool with the wall Tjpe set to 
"Exterior - Brick on Mtl. Stud," draw a 
40' -0" x 20' -0" building (Figure 5-3.1).

The various roof forms are largely defined by the "Difines slope" setting. 
This is displayed in the Options Barwhile the Roqftool is active. When a 
wall is selected and the "Difines slope" option is selected, the roof above 
that portion of wall slopes. You will see this more clearly in the examples 
below.

You will notice that the default wall height is much higher than what we ultimately want. 
However, when the roof is drawn at the correct elevation and you attach the walls to the 
roof, the walls automatically adjust to stop under the roof object. Additionally, if the roof is 
raised or lowered later, the walls will follow; you can try this in the South elevation view by 
simply using the Mot·e tool. REMEMBER: You c't1n make retisions in a'!)' tiew.

The remaining pages in this chapter are for reference only and do not need to be done to 
your model. You are encouraged to study this information so you become more familiar 
with how the Roqftool works. 
The following examples use a brick and concrete wall example. The image below shows the 
Strudure properties for said wall type. Notice the only item within the Core Boundary section is 
the Masonry - Concrete Block (i.e., CMU) which is 7%" thick (nominally 8"). Keep this in mind

The following examples will show you how to control the position of the roof system 
relative to the wall below, both vertically and horizontally. The roof properties that dictate its 
position basically involve relationships between three things: the Level Datum, the exterior 
Wall System and the bottom edge of the Roof System. There are several other properties 
(e.g., pitch, construction, fascia, etc.) related to the roof that will not be mentioned at the 
moment so the reader may focus on a few basic principles.

The examples on this page show a sloped roof sketched with Extend into Jvall (to core) enabled 
and the Ot·erhang set to 2' -0". Because Extend into Jvall (to core) was selected, the bottom edge 
of the roof is positioned relative to the Core Boundary of the exterior wall rather than the 
finished face of the wall. See the discussion about the wall's Core Boundary on the previous 
page.

୕Defin e-s sl ope I 
Overha ng : 
2' 0 "  
As you can see from the previous examples, you would most often want to have Extend to 
Jvall (to core) selected while sketching a roof because it would not typically make sense to 
position the roof based on the outside face of brick or the inside face of gypsum board, for 
commercial construction. 
Even though you may prefer to have Extend to 
JJal (to rxm) selected, you might like to have a 
2' -0" overhang relative to the face of the brick 
rather than the exterior face of concrete 
block. This can be accomplished in one of 
two ways: 
(A) You can modify the overhang, while 
sketching the roof, to include the 
wall thickness that occurs between 
the face of wall and face of core: 
2'-0" + 9%" = 2'-9%". See the 
image to the right. 
(B) The second option is to manually 
edit the sketch lines. You can add 
dimensions while in S kekh mode, 
select the sketch line to move, and 
then edit the dimension. The 
dimension can also be Lor-ked to 
maintain the roof edge position 
relative to the wall. When you finish 
the sketch the dimensions are 
hidden.

In addition to controlling the roof overhang, you might also want to control the roof 
properties to accommodate an energy truss with what is called an enew heal, which allows for 
more insulation to occur directly above the exterior wall). 
To do this you would use the Extend into Jvall (to wre) + Truss option described above and 
then set the Base Offset from Let·elto 1'-0" (for a 1'-0" energy heal). See the image and the 
Prope1ties Palette shown on the next page.

Many other properties and techniques exist which one 
can use to develop the roof for a project, things like 
the Rafter Cut and Fasr,ia Depth which control the fascia 
design. Also, you can apply a sweep to a roof edge to 
add a 1x fascia board around the building. These are 
intermediate to advanced concepts and will not be 
covered here. 
This concludes the study of the Rol?ftool!

Lesson 6 
Office Building: FLOOR SYSTEMS and REFLECTED 
CEILING PLANS:: 
In this lesson you will learn to create floor structures and reflected ceiling plans. 
Even though you currently have floor levels defined, you do not have an object that 
represents the mass of the floor systems. You will add floor systems with holes for stairs, 
elevators, and the atrium. 
Ceiling systems allow you to specify the ceiling material by room and the height above the 
floor. Once the ceiling has been added it will show up in section views (sections are created 
later in this book). 
Similar to other Revit elements, you can select from a few pre-defined system families. You 
can also create new types. 
Level l, Slab on Grade: 
Sketching floors is a lot like sketching roofs (Lesson 5); you can select walls to define the 
perimeter and draw lines to fill in the blanks and add holes (cut-outs) in the floor element. 
1. Open ex5-2.rvt and Save As ex6-1.rvt. 
2. Switch to the Level l floor plan view. 
3. Select Architecture -7 Build -7 Floor (dOJvn-arrOJv) -7 Floor. 
4. Click Edit Type on the Prope1ties Palette. 
5. Select type Generic - 12" from the Tjpe drop-down list at the top. 
6. Click Duplicate to start a new floor 
type. 
7. Type 6" Slab on Grade, then OK. 
8. Click the Edit button next to the 
Strudure Parameter.

9. Change the material for the structure layer shown to Concrete: cast-in-place 
concrete, and change the thickness to 6". 
10. Next you will add carpet on top of the slab. Click Insert and use the Up/Down 
buttons to position the Iqercorrectly (Figure 6-6.1). 
11. Add another layer: 
a. Function: Finish 1 [4] 
b. Material: Carpet (1) 
c. Thickness: 1/ 4" 
(Figure 6-1.1) 
12. Click OK to close the open dialog 
boxes. 
13. Select all the exterior walls on Level l; 
this should include the curtain wall at 
the atrium and the stair shafts (Figure 
6-1.3). 
TIP: Seled the interior side of the wall;you c-an 
use the cvntrol arows if needed.

You will most likely get an error message. This is because the main exterior walls extend into 
the atrium (past the curtain wall). Because this is not a perfect comer (and it does not need 
to be), you can trim the "edge of slab" lines while in sketch mode to create a true comer, i.e., 
a closed line for the floor (Figure 6-1.2). 
15. (If you did not get an error, 
skip ahead to Step 18.)

Creating the second and third floors will be a little more involved than was the first floor. 
This is because the upper floors require several openings. For example, you need to define 
the openings for the elevator, the stair shafts and the atrium space. Revit makes the process 
very simple however. 
You should still be in the Floor tool. 
27. On the Options Bar, check "Extend into wall (to core)." 
FYI: The "Extend into wall (to core) " option will extend the slab to your CMU (CMU is the core in our 
example), and go under the furting. Depending on the design, the floor mqy extend to the exterior face of the 
CMU, allowing the CMU to bear on the floor slab at each ler·eL In this exercise you will seled the interior side. 
28. Select the exterior walls indicated in Figure 6-1.7. 
REMEMBER: To seled the interior side of the wall, use the control arrows if needed. 
FIGURE 6-1.7 Level 2 -

Next you will define the portion of floor that extends into the stair shaft to be the landing at 
this level. You will need to use the Une tool and the Trim tools to define this area. 
29. Click on the Line tool from the Drmv panel on the Ribbon.

Explore your work by looking at the model in 3D (Figure 6-1.12). 
Notice again how Revit automatically applies colors and patterns to surfaces to help you 
(and your client) better visualize your design with minimal effort. These colors and materials 
relate to the materials applied to each element. You will learn more about this in the 
rendering chapter.

When you place a ceiling grid, Revit centers the grid in the room. The general rule-of-thumb 
is you should try to avoid reducing the tile size by more than half at its perimeter. You can 
see in Figure 6-2.4 that the East and West sides look okay. However, the North and South 
sides are small slivers. You will adjust this next. 
8. Select Modify from the Ribbon. 
9. Select the ceiling grid (only one line in the ceiling grid will be highlighted). 
10. Use the Move tool to move the grid 24" to the North (Figure 6-2.5).

15. Again, with the grid still selected, use the Rotate tool to rotate the grid 45 degrees. 
TIP: When using the Rotate tool 0 you need to pick two points. The first point is your reference line. The second 
point is the number of degrees of that reference line. In this example, try pickingyour first point to the right as a 
horizontal line. Then mor-e the cursor counter-clockwise until45 degrees is displqyed. You can also type the angle 
instead of picking a second point. 
16. Your drawing should look similar to Figure 6-2.6.

Next, you will look at drawing gypsum board (or drywall) ceiling systems. The process is 
identical to placing the grid system. Additionally, you will create a new ceiling type. 
Gypsum Board Ceiling System: 
You will create a new ceiling type for a gypsum board ceiling. To better identify the areas 
that have a gypsum board ceiling, you will set the ceiling type to have a stipple pattern. This 
will provide a nice graphical representation for the gypsum board ceiling areas. 
17. From the Manage tab, select Materials. 
This is the list o/ materials you seled from 1vhen assigning a material to each lqyer in a 1vall system,

The Suiface Pattern setting is what will add the stipple pattern to the gypsum board ceiling 
areas. With this set to none, the ceiling has no pattern Oike the basic ceiling type). 
Thus, if you wanted Carpet 1 finish to never have the stipple hatch pattern, you could 
change the surface pattern to none via the Materials dialog and not have to change each 
view's visibility override.

Figure 6-2.9 Gyp. Bd. Ceiling 
You now have a gypsum board ceiling at 8'-0" above the finished floor in the toilet rooms. 
Sketching a Ceiling: 
Next, you will draw a ceiling in the atrium area. However, you cannot simply pick the room 
to place the ceiling because of the opening in the floor. You will need to sketch the ceiling 
just like you sketched the floor system in the previous exercise. First, you will need to draw a 
bulkhead at the edge of the second floor slab. A bulkhead is a portion of wall that hangs 
from the floor above and creates a closed perimeter for a ceiling system to tie into. 
30. While still in the Level 1 Reflected Ceiling Plan view, select the Wall tool. 
6-16 

Office Building: FOOR SYSTEMS and REFLECTED CEILING PLANS 
31. Set the wall properties to: 
Interior - 4 7 /8" Partition (1-hr) and 
the Base O.fiet to 9' -6". (This Jvill put the 
bottom rf the Jvall to 9 ?_6 "" abot·e the cumnt 
floor lez·el, Lez-el 1 in this case.) (Figure 6-
2.10) 
32. Set the Top Constraint to: 
Up to level: Level 2 (Figure 6-2.10). 
TIP: The next time you draw a wall you will hat-e to 
change the Base Oiftet bac-k to 0 "-0 ""or your wall will 
be 9 "-6 ""of the floor. 
33. Draw the bulkhead; make sure you 
snap to the edge of the slab. Also, make 
sure the wall is under the floor system, 
not out in the opening. Do this by 
drawing the wall either from right to 
left or left to right depending on how 
you have the Location Line set (Figure 
6-2.11).

TIP: You can use arrqy to quickfy place ser·eral lights. 
You may have to use the Moz·e command (or better, the Align tool) to move the fixture so it 
fits perfectly in the ACT grid. 
8. Now place another 
2x4 light fixture as 
shown in Figure 6-3.4. 
Notice the fixture does not 
automatically orientate itself with 
the ceiling grid. There may be an 
occasion when you want this. 
Also, notice the light fixture hides 
a portion of the ceiling grid. This 
is nice because the grid does not 
extend through a light fixture. 
TIP: You mqy press the Space bar 
while pladng the light fixture to rotate 
it.

Reflected Ceiling Plan Symbols: 
Revit provides many of the industry standard symbols 
necessary in drawing reflected ceiling plans (RCP) . As 
shown in Figure 6-3.5, supply air is represented with 
an X and return air has a diagonal line. It is typical to 
have a RCP symbol legend showing each symbol and 
material pattern and list what each one represents. 
Component Properties 
If you want to adjust the properties of a component, 
such as a light fixture, you can browse to it in the 
Prqject Browser and right click on it (notice the right click 
menu also has the option to select all instances of the item in the 
drawint) and select Properties. You will see the dialog 
below for the 2x4 (2 Lamps) . 
You can also click duplicate and add more sizes (e.g., 
4' x4' light fixture) .

The text size you entered in step 9 is the size of the text when printed. If you change the 
scale of the drawing, the text size will automatically change, so the text is always the correct 
size when printing. It is best to set the drawing to the correct scale first. As changing the 
drawing scale can create a lot of work; repositioning resized text that may be overlapping 
something or too big for a room. 
10. Select OK to close the open dialog 
boxes. 
You should now have the new text style

Lesson 7 
Office Building: INTERIOR and EXTERIOR 
ELEVATIONS:: 
This lesson will cover interior and exterior elevations. The default template you started with 
already has the four main exterior elevations set up for you. You will investigate how Revit 
generates elevations and the role the elevation tag plays in that process. You will also be 
introduced to a feature called Design Options. 
Parametric Exterior Elevations 
Here you will look at setting up an exterior elevation and how to control some of the various 
options. 
Setting Up an Exterior Elevation: 
Even though you already have the main exterior elevations set, you will go through the steps 
necessary to set one up. Many projects have more than four exterior elevations, so all 
exterior surfaces are elevated. 
1. 
Open your project, ex6-4.rvt, and Save As ex7-1.rvt. 
2. Switch to your Level l Floor Plan view. 
-6-
3. Select View -7 Create -7 Elevation. 
Ckv1:1ti o11 
TIP: Seled the main part of the split-button, not the down arrow. 
4. Place the temporary elevation tag in the plan view as 
shown in Figure 7 -1 .1. 
NOTE: As you mor·e the cursor around the screen, the eler·ation tag 
automaticallY turns to point at the building. 
You now have an elevation added to the Projed BrOJvser in the 
Elemtions grouping.

FIGURE 7-1.1 Added elevation tag 

Architectural Commercial Design Using Autodesk Revit 2014 
After placing an elevation tag, you should rename the elevation label in the Prqjed BrOJvser. 
5. In the Prqjed BrOJvser, under Elet-ations, select the elevation label that was just added; it 
should be "Elevation 1 - a". 
6. Right-dick on the view label and select Rename. 
7. Type: South Temp 
The name should be fairly descriptive so you can tell where the elevation is just by the label. 
This will be essential on a large project that has several exterior elevations and even more 
interior elevations. 
8. Double-dick on South Temp in the Prqjed BrOJvser. 
The elevation may not look correct right away. You will adjust this in the next step. Notice, 
though, that an elevation was created simply by placing an elevation tag in the plan view. 
9. Switch back to your Level l floor plan view. 
Next you will study the options associated with the elevation tag. This, in part, controls what 
is seen in the elevation. 
10. The elevation tag has two parts: the pointing triangle (pointer) and the square center 
(body). Each part will highlight as you move the cursor over it. Select the square 
center part. 
You should now see the symbol shown on the right 
(Figure 7 -1.2). 
View direction boxes: 
The checked box indicates which way the elevation tag 
is looking. You can check (or uncheck) the other boxes. 
Each checked box relates to an elevation view in the 
Prqjed BrOJvser. 
Rotation control: 
Allows you to look perpendicular to an angled wall in 
plan, for example.

Cutting plane/ 
extent of view 
FIGURE 7-1.3 Selected elevation tag 
The elevation tag, as selected in Figure 7-1.3, has several features for controlling how the 
elevation looks. Here is a quick explanation: 
• 
Cutting plane/ extent of view line: This controls how much of the 3D 
model is elevated from left to right (i.e., the width of the elevation). 
• 
Far clip plane: This controls how far into the 3D model the elevation can 
see. 
• 
Adjustment grips: You can drag this with the mouse to control the features 
mentioned above. 
14. Select the view label South Temp in the Projed BrOJvser, now look at the Properties 
Palette settings for the view (see notes on the next page). 
7-3 

Architectural Commercial Design Using Autodesk Revit 2014 
You have several options in the Properties Palette (Figure 7-1.4). Notice the options under the 
Extents heading, below is an examination of three of these settings: 
• 
Crop View: This crops the width and 
height of the view in elevation. A4Justing the 
nidth rf the croping JvindOJv in elewtion also 
a4Justs the "extent rf zie1v" control in the plan 
tUJV. 
• 
Crop Region Visible: This displays a 
rectangle in the elevation view indicating 
the extent of the cropping window 
(described above). 
When seleded in elewtion tieu;, the redangle can be 
a4Justed u;ith the a4Justment grips. 
• 
Far Clipping: If this is turned "off', Revit 
will draw everything visible in the 3D model 
(lvithin the "extent rf tieu/'). 
You will manipulate some of these controls next.

Notice that the roof is not fully visible. This is not related to the cropping window shown in 
Figure 7-1.6. Rather, it is related to the "Far Clip Plane" set in the plan view. 
17. Adjust the "Far Clip Plane" in the Level l plan view so that the entire roof shows in 
the South Temp view. 
Next you will adjust the elevation tag to set up a detail elevation for the atrium curtain wall. 
18. In Level l plan view, adjust the elevation tag to show only the atrium curtain wall 
(Figure 7-1.7). 
19. Switch to South Temp view to see the "detail" elevation (Figure 7-1.8). 
20. Adjust the South Temp view's Properties to turn off the crop region's visibility; this 
can also be done via the VieJv Control Bar. 
21 . Save your project as ex7-1.rvt.

DETAIL ELEVATION: 
A detail elevation like this 
would be used to 
dimension the curtain wall 
member spacing (not 
drawn yet) and add notes 
about glass types and finish, 
etc. This might be placed 
on a sheet with the window 
types or on the sheet with 
the curtain wall details.

The purpose of this exercise is to demonstrate that changes can be made anywhere and all 
other drawings are automatically updated. 
Modify an Exterior Elevation: 
1. Open ex7-1.rvt and Save As ex7-2. 
2. Open the East exterior elevation view. 
3. Use the Window tool and select Fixed· 32" x 48" in the T)pe Seiedor. 
You will insert a window in elevation. This will demonstrate, first, that you can actually add a 
window in elevation not just plan view, and second, that the other views are automatically 
updated. 
Notice, with the window selected for placement, you have the usual dimensions helping you 
accurately place the window. As you move the window around you should see a dashed 
horizontal cyan colored line indicating the default sill height. 
4. Place a window as shown in Figure 7-2.1; make sure the bottom of the window 
"snaps" to the cyan sill line.

If you laid out the interior walls as described in Lesson 3, you should get a warning message 
when inserting the windows on Level 1, towards the North side of the building. This is 
because the interior wall for the room in the north-east comer conflicts with the exterior 
window. Revit is smart enough to see that conflict and bring it to your attention. In this case 
you probably want the windows to be uniformly spaced, so you will ignore the conflict and 
move the wall in the plan view. 
8. Click the red X (in the upper right) to ignore the wall/window conflict warning 
(Figure 7-2.4). Ifyou did not get this Jvarning, skip this step.

10. Switch to the Level l RCP view. Fix the ceiling. 
NOTE: The ceiling grids are like!J not aligned with the rerised walls. If this is the case, see the explanation 
below (Figure 7-2.6). 
Most of the time, when you move a wall, Revit will automatically update the ceiling gird to 
fit the new room. However, occasionally the definition of the room boundary is lost while 
making modifications. In this case, you will have to delete the grid and reinsert it - or select it 
and "edit sketch". 
Deleting a Ceiling Grid: 
When selecting a ceiling grid, Revit only 
selects one line. This does not allow you 
to delete the ceiling grid. To delete: 
hover cursor over a ceiling grid line and 
press the TAB key until you see the 
ceiling perimeter highlight, then click the 
mouse. 
The 
entire 
ceiling will be 
selected. Press Delete.

Parametric Interior Elevations 
Creating interior elevations is very much like exterior elevations. In fact, you use the same 
tool. The main difference is that you are placing the elevation tag inside the building, rather 
than on the exterior. 
Adding Interior Elevation Tag: 
1. Open project ex7-2.rvt and Save As ex7-3.rvt. 
2. Switch to Level l floor plan view, if necessary. 
3. Select the Elevation tool. 
4. Select Elewtion: Interior Elevation from the Tjpe S eledor and then place an elevation 
tag, looking East, in the atrium area (Figure 7-3.1); place as shown in the center of 
the room. 
REMEMBER: The first thingyou should do after adding a 
new riew is to giroe it an appropriate name in the Project 
Browser list. 
5. Change the name of the elevation to East 
Atrium. 
6. Switch to the East Atrium view. Try 
double-dicking on the pointer part rf the elewtion 
tag to open the tieJv. 
Initially, your elevation should look something 
like Figure 7-3.2. You will adjust this view next. 
Notice h01v Retit automaticallY controls the line Jveights rf 
things in section t'S. things in elet'tltions. 
FIGURE 7-3.1 Level l - Atrium 
FYI: The eler·ation tags are used to reforence the sheet and drawing number so the client or contractor can find the 
desired eler·ation quick!J while looking at the floor plans. This will be cor·ered in a later lesson. It is interesting to know, 
howmr, that Rerit automaticallY does this (fills in the elet'ation tag) when the eler·ation is placed on a sheet, and will 
update it if the elet'ation is motoed.

7. Switch back to the Level l 
vtew. 
8. Pick the "pointing" portion of 
the elevation tag, so you see 
the view options (Figure 7-
3.3). 
You should compare the two 
drawings on this page (Figures 7-3.2 
and 7-3.3) to see how the control lines 
in the plan view dictate what is 
generated/visible in the elevation 
view, for both width and depth.

If the ceiling were drawn for the third floor (your instructor may have assigned this), you 
would probably stretch the crop region down to it. Interior elevations don't normally show 
walls, roofs and floors in section. An atrium elevation like this could be an exception for the 
floors. 
12. Now stretch the top of the crop region down to approximately 9'-6" above Level 3. 
(Go to the ceiling if you have drawn one for Level 3). 
13. Stretch the bottom of the crop region up to align with the top of the Level 1 floor 
slab. 
14. On the View Control Bar, set the scale to lf/'=1'-0". 
Your elevation should look like Figure 7-3.6.

You can leave the crop region on to help define the perimeter of the elevation. You can also 
tum it off. However, some lines that are directly under the crop region might disappear. You 
could use the Detail Li.ne tool to manually define the perimeter. 
Also, notice the level datum automatically resized to match the new scale. When space 
permits, most interior elevations are 1/4" = 1 '-0". 
15. Save your project as ex7-3.rvt.

This short exercise, similar to Exercise 7-2, will look at an example of Revit's ability to 
change anything anywhere. All drawings are generated from one 3D model. 
Modify the Interior Elevations: 
1. Open ex7-3.rvt and Save As ex7-4.rvt. 
2. Open the East Atrium elevation view. 
You will move two doors and add one. 
3. Select both of the single doors on Levels 2 and 3; use the Ctrl key to select multiple

When placing a door in elevation, you may have to switch to plan view to verify the door 
swing is the way you want it; you cannot control the door swing in elevation (well, actually, 
you can via a right-dick on the door in elevation, but you would first need to know which 
way it is swinging). 
In elevation, you can adjust many things this way. Some examples are: ceiling height, interior 
and exterior windows, wall locations (perpendicular to the current view), etc. 
7. Save your project as ex7-4.

This exercise will cover the steps involved in designing a curtainwall system (only from an 
aesthetic viewpoint, not structurally). This is surprisingly simple to do. 
Adding Curtain Grid: 
First, you draw a grid on your curtainwall. This sets up the location for your mullions, which 
you will add later. 
1. Open ex7-4.rvt and Save As ex7-5.rvt. 
2. Switch to your South Temp view. 
3. Select Architecture -7 Build -7 Curtain Grid. 
4. Draw the grid as shown in Figure 7-5.1. 
Be sure to add horizontal grids at Lez·els 2 and 3.

If a curtain grid line did not land in the correct place, you can select it and adjust the 
dimensions that will appear on the screen. To select the grid you need to place your cursor 
over the grid line and press the Tab key until the curtain grid is highlighted, and then click to 
select. 
5. Select the Curtain Grid tool and then click on the One Segment option on the Ribbon 
(Figure 7-5.2).

Notice that the One Sl}gment option limits the grid to the "cell" you clicked in, rather than 
extending from top to bottom as the others did. 
Next, you will setup the curtain grid lines around the corners. This can be done from the 
East or West views, similar to the previous steps. However, this can also be accomplished in 
a 3D view. 
7. Click on the 3D icon on the Quir-k Ar-·ms Toolbar. 
8. Using the Curtain Grid tool, add the grid lines shown in Figure 7-5.4. Starting at 
the outside corner, space the grids 5'-4" (the last space will be smaller).

As you move the cursor, while placing the 
horizontal grids, you should see the grid "snap" 
to the grid around the corner; that is when you 
click the mouse. 
Drag your cursor on the ViewCube to see your 
project from different views. Clicking the 
"Home" icon (visible when your cursor is over 
the ViewCube) will reset the view.

Thus far you have simply setup the spacing for the curtain wall mullions. Next you need to 
place the curtain wall mullions. This involves selecting a size for the mullion, as they typically 
come in many shapes and sizes. (The depth is usually related to the height of the curtain wall, 
as the mullion acts as the structure for the glass wall.) 
12. Switch to the 3D view. 
13. Select Architecture -7 Build -7 Mullion. 
14. Select Rutangular Mullion: 2.5" x 5" rectangular

Office Building: INTERIOR and EXTERIOR ELEVATIONS 
This exercise will explore a feature called Design Options. This feature allows you to present 
two or more options for a portion of your design without having to save a copy of your 
project and end up having to maintain more than one project until the preferred design 
option is selected. 
This feature can be used during the early design phase of a project or to manage bidding 
alternates all the way through construction documents. Design Options are different from 
phasing, which manages changes on the model over time, in that it manages changes to the 
model within the same time frame. 
Design Options Overview: 
A Revit project can have several design option studies at any given time. You might have an 
(A) entry canopy options study, (B) an executive board room options study, and a (q toilet 
room layout options study in a project. Each of these studies can have several design options 
associated with them. For example, the entry canopy study might have three options: 1. flat 
roof, 2. gable roof, and 3. sloped glass roof. 
A particular study of an area within your project is called a Design Option Set, and the different 
designs associated with a Design Options Set are called Options. Both the Design Options Set and 
the Options can be named. 
One of the Options in a Design Option Set is specified as the Primary option (the others are 
called Set·ondary options); this is the option that is shown by default in all new and existing 
views. However, you can adjust the Visibility of a View to show a different option. Typically 
you would duplicate a View, adjust the Visibility, and Rename it to have each option at your 
finger-tips. 
When the preferred design is selected, by you or the owner, you set that Option to Primary. 
Finally, you select a tool called "At·t-ept Primary'' which deletes the S etvndary Options and the 
Design Option Set, leaving the Primary Option as part of the main building model.

Notes about the Design Options dialog box: 
Edit buttons: 
You can edit a Design Option by selecting an Option (in the window area on the left) and then 
clicking the "Edit Seleded' button. Next you add, move and delete elements in that Design 
Option. 
When finished editing a Design Option, you reopen the Design Options dialog and click the 
"Finish Editing' button. 
If you are currently in an Option Editing mode, the Now Editing area in the Design Options 
dialog displays the Option name being modified; otherwise it displays "Main Model". 
Option Set buttons: 
The New button is always available. You can quickly set up several Option Sets. Each time you 
create a new Option Set, Revit automatically creates a Primary Option named "Option 1". 
The other buttons are only available when an Option Set label is highlighted (i.e., selected) in 
the window list on the left. 
The At·t-ept Primar;y button causes the Primary option of the selected Set to become a normal 
part of the building model and deletes the Set and Secondary Options. This is a way of 
"cleaning house", by getting rid of unnecessary information which helps to better manage 
the project and keeps the file size down. 
Option buttons: 
These buttons are only available when an Option (primary or secondary) is selected within an 
Option Set. You can quickly set up several Options without having to immediately add any 
content (i.e., walls, components, etc.) to them. 
The Make Primar;y button allows you to change the status of a S etvndary Option to Primary. As 
previously mentioned, the Primary Option is the Option that is shown by default in existing and 
new v1ews. 
The Du,_blkate button will copy all the elements in the selected Option into a new Option (this 
makes the file larger because you are technically adding additional content to the project). 
You can then use the copied elements (e.g., walls, furniture, etc.) as a starting point for the 
next design option. This is handy if the various options are similar. 
7-25 

Architectural Commercial Design Using Autodesk Revit 2014 
Now you will put this knowledge to use! 
Setting Up a Design Option Set: 
In this exercise you will create two Design Option Sets; one for the curtain wall and another for 
the roof area above the curtain wall. You will create an alternate roof and curtain wall design 
for the office building project. 
You could just create one Design Option Set and have two design options total. However, by 
placing the curtain wall options in one Option Set and the roof in another, you actually get a 
total of four design options. You can mix and match the curtain wall and roof options. 
Setting Up Design Options in Your Project: 
First you will setup the Option Sets and Options. 
1. Open ex7-5.rvt and Save As ex7-6.rvt. 
2. Select the Design Options icon on the Status Bar (see image below). 
You are now in the Design Options 
dialog box (Figure 7-6.2). Unless you 
have modified your file to have Option 
Sets, your dialog will look like this one. 
3. In the Option Set area click

The basic thinking with the Design Options feature is that you set up the Option Set and Options 
and then start drawing the elements related to the current Option. So, you select the option 
you wish to edit via the Design Options drop-down list on the Status Bar, make the additions 
and modifications relative to that Design Option, and finally set the drop-down list back to 
"Main Model". 
However, in your case, you want to move content already drawn to Option 1. Revit has a 
feature that allows you to move content to a Design Option Set, which means the content gets 
copied to each Option in the Set you select. This option will work for the curtainwall because 
the second option will be similar to the first one. 
Curtain Wall Design Option: 
You are now ready to setup the different design options. 
9. Switch to the Default 3D view. 
10. Select the three curtain wall sections (three major areas around the atrium) and the 
three short walls above the curtain walls. 
TIP: Make sure you dick when the entire curtain wall area is selected, not just an inditidual mullion or celL 
You mqy need to use the Tab kƺ to ryde through the m·ailable options below your cursor.

15. Using the Curtain Grid tool on the Modeling Tab, add horizontal lines equally spaced 
between the larger vertical spaces as shown in Figure 7-6.8 (You should be able to 
place all the grid lines from this one view angle). 
TIP: Use the "All except picked" setting on the Ribbon when pladng the grid on either side of the doors on

It now appears like all your changes disappeared, right? Well, if you recall from the 
introduction to this exercise, the Primary Option is displayed by default for all new and 
existing views. So when you finished editing CU?taimvalL-Option 2 the Default 3D Vie1v 
switched back to the primary option (which is currently set to Option 1). 
Next you will create a new view and adjust its Visibility to display Option 2 of the CU?taimvall 
Options Set.

Atrium Roof Design Option: 
Similar to getting things ready to create the second option for the curtainwall, you will do the 
same for the atrium roof. However, the second roof option is totally different from the first 
option, so it does not make sense to move the current roof to each option in the Atrium Roqf 
Option Set, you would end up completely deleting the roof from Attium RoqtOption 2 (deleting 
the roof would be no problem in this case, but another scenario might have hundreds of 
entities that need to be moved to Option 1, which would be more difficult to delete from 
Option 2). Next you will explore the how to move content to just one Option in an Option Set. 
28. Switch to the Difault 3D view. 
29. Select the roof over the atrium and curtain 
wall area. 
30. Again, select Add to Set from the Status 
Bar. 
You are now able to specify the Option Set and the 
specific Options to copy the selected elements to 
(Figure 7-6.1 1). 
31. Select Atrium Roof from the drop-down 
list. (Figure 7-6.1 1) 
32. Uncheck "Option 2" from the list. 
33. Click 0 K to close the Add to Set dialog. 
You have now copied the roof into Option 1 
for the Option Set named Atrium Roof, and 
Option 2 is still empty.

does not currently have a roof in it. 
35. Switch to the South elevation view. 
36. Zoom in to the area above the curtain wall. 
Next, you will create an In-place Fami!J to represent a 
curved roof option over the atrium area. Basically, 
you will create a solid by specifying a depth and then 
drawing a profile of the curved roof with lines.

Now you will draw another arc 1'-0" above the previous one. 
46. Select Modify on the Ribbon. 
4 7. With the draw arc tool still selected, on the Options Bar, enter 1' -0" for the O.fiet. 
48. Pick the same three points shown in Figure 7-6.18. 
Notice that an arc is drawn offset 1'-0" from the points you picked. If you pick the first two 
points in the other direction, the arc would be offset in the other direction (downward in this 
case). 
Next, you will draw two short lines to connect the endpoints of the two arcs. This will create 
a closed area which is required before finishing the sketch. Think of it this way: you need to 
completely specify at least two dimensions before Revit can create the third. 
49. Click the "straight" line icon on the Drmv panel. This will switch you from drawing 
arcs back to drawing straight line segments. 
50. Zoom in and draw a short line on each end of the arc as shown in Figure 7-6.19, try 
typing SE before picking to make it easier to snap to the arc's endpoints. (Make sure 
O.fiet is set back to zero.)

You are still in the Create Famify mode. Before you finish you will apply a material to the roof 
element. 
52. Click the new roof to select it. 
53. On the Properties Palette, click in the Material value field and then click the " . . .  " icon 
that appears. 
The Material dialog opens. 
54. Select Metal-Roofing from the list of predefined Materials and then click OK. 
FYI: Notice the rendering material is set to ''Aluminum Anodized Dark Bronze "for Metal- Roofing on 
the Render Appearance tab. 
55. Click Apply to close the Properties Palette. 
You are now ready to finish the Family. 
56. From the Ribbon click Finish Model. 
You are now also ready to finish editing the current design option for the time being. 
57. Select Main Model from the Design Options list on the Status Bar. 
As before, the option you were just working on was not the Primary Option in the Atrium RtJqf 
Design Set, so the current view reverted back to Atrium RtJqt: Qbtion 1 (which is the Primary 
view). 
You will create a 3D view that has Qbtion 2 set to be visible for both the Curtainwall Option Set 
and the Atrium Roqf Option Set. 
58. Duplicate the Difault 3D view. 
59. Rename the duplicated view to Atrium - Option 2. 
60. Switch to the new view (Atrium - Option 2). 
61. Type VV to access the Visibiliry/Graphir:s Ot·enides.

62. On the Design Options tab, set both Option Sets to Option 2 in the Design Option 
column. 
63. Click OK to close the dialog. 
You can now see a 3D view of your new roof 
option. However, you realize that the walls 
above the curtainwall need to be modified 
based on the roof option; so it would make 
more sense to have the walls in the Atrium 
Roof Option Set rather than the Curtainwall 
Option Set. 
Next, you will make this change and then 
modify the wall to conform to the curved roof 
option. 
64. In the Default 3D View: open each of 
the two Options (i.e., enter edit mode) in 
the Curtaimvall Option Set and Cut the 
three walls above the curtain wall to the

This feature allows you to Attach a wall to another object. In this example you will pick the 
curved roof which will cause the wall to extend up and conform to the underside of the 
curved roof. 
The Edit Prqfile button (also visible on the Ribbon when the wall is selected) would allow you 
to achieve the same results. Using that tool you sketch a new perimeter for the wall in an 
elevation or 3D view. This is particularly handy if you do not have another object to 
conform to; you simply want the top of the wall to do something unusual. 
70. Hover the cursor over the 
curved roof until it highlights, 
and then click to select it. 
Immediately the wall is modified; it 
should look similar to Figure 7-6.22. 
71. Finish editing the current

Lesson 8 
Office Building: SECTIONS and DETAILS:: 
Sections are one of the main communication tools in a set of architectural drawings. They 
help the builder understand vertical relationships. With traditional CAD software, 
architectural sections can occasionally contradict other drawings, such as mechanical or 
structural drawings. One example is a beam shown on the section is smaller than what the 
structural drawings call for; this creates a problem in the field when the duct does not fit in 
the ceiling space. The ceiling gets lowered or the duct gets smaller, ultimately compromising 
the design to a certain degree. 
Revit takes great steps toward eliminating these types of conflicts. Sections, like plans and 
elevations, are generated from the 3D model. So it is virtually impossible to have a conflict 
between the architectural drawings. As structural and mechanical engineers begin to use 
Revit the coordination get betters as the various discipline's models are linked together. 
Similar to elevation tags, placing the reference tags in a plan view actually generates the 
section view. You will learn how to do this next. 
Placing Section Tags: 
1. Open ex7-6.rvt and Save As ex8-1.rvt. 
2. Switch to Level l view. 
3. Select View Í Create Í Section button from the Ribbon. 
Sectio n 
4. Draw a Section tag as shown in Figure 8-1.1. Start on the left side in this case. Use 
the Mot·e tool if needed to accurately adjust the section tag after insertion. The 
section should go through the doors in the stair shaft (Figure 8-1.1).

FIGURE 8-1.1 Section tag (selected) 
Figure 8-1.1 shows the section tag selected. The section tag features are very similar to the 
elevation tags covered in the previous lesson. You can adjust the depth of view (Far Clip 
Plane) and the width of the section with the A4Justment Grips. 
Section views are listed under that heading in the Prqjed Brmvser. Similar to newly created 
elevation views, you should name section views as you create them. 
5. Rename the new section view to: Longitudinal Section. 
6. Switch to the Longitudinal Section view (Figure 8-1.2). 
FIGURE 8-1.2 Longitudinal section view 
8-2 

Office Building: SECTIONS and DETAILS 
You can see that the stairs are cut off on the back side because of the Far Clip Plane location 
in the plan view (Figure 8-1.1). Also, you can see the roof is shown in section exactly where 
the section line is shown in plan. Figure 8-1.2 also shows the Crop Region. 
7. Adjust the Far Clip Plane in plan view so the entire stair shows and the Crop Region is 
not visible (Figure 8-1.3). 
FIGURE 8-1.3 Longitudinal view - updated 
8. On the VieJv Control Bar, change the view Properties so the Detail Level is set to 
Medium. (Notice h01v the Jvalls change to shOJv more detail.)

You should notice an added level of detail in the section view. For example, the concrete 
hatch in the floor and the CMU joint lines in the elevator shaft. This added detail helps the 
drawing read better. 
Next you will add a cross sectional view. 
10. Create a Section as shown in Figure 8-1.5. 
TIP: You can use the control arrows to make the section look the other direction.

12. Adjust the Far Clip Plane (if required) so the entire atrium roof will be visible in the 
Cross Section 1 view. 
13. Switch to the Cross Section 1 view. 
14. Set the Detail Let·el to Medium and turn off the Crop Region visibility via the Vie1v

Revit automatically displays 
lines heavier for objects that 
are in section than for objects 
beyond the cutting plane (i.e. 
in projection) and shown in 
elevation. 
Also, with the Detail Let'el set 
to medium, the walls and 
floors are hatched to represent 
the material in section. 
Notice that the Longitudinal Section tag is automatically displayed in the Cross Section 1 
view. If you switch to the Longitudinal Section view you will see the Cross Section 1 section 
tag. Keeping with Revit's philosophy of change anything anywhere, you can select the 
section tag in the other section view and adjust its various properties, like the Far Clip Plane. 
15. Save your project as ex8-1.rvt.

Again, similar to elevation views, you can modify the project model in section view. This 
includes adjusting door locations and ceiling heights. 
Modifying Doors in Section View: 
In this section you will move a door and delete a door in section view. 
1. Open ex8-1.rvt and Save As ex8-2.rvt. 
2. Open Cross Section 1 view. 
3. On Level 2, move the Single Glass door 5' -0" to the north and delete the door added 
in a previous lesson, see modified section view Figure 8-2.1. (See Figure 8-1.6 for an 
unmodified view.) 
4. Adjust the ceiling height in the lower right room to be 9' -0" above Level 1 (Figure 
8-2.1). 
TIP: Seled the ceiling and simpfy change the temporary dimension that appears (or use the Properties 
Palette).

So far in this lesson you have drawn building sections. Building sections are typically 1/16" 
or 1/8" scale and light on the details and notes. Wall sections are drawn at a larger scale and 
have much more detail. You will look at setting up wall sections next. 
Setting Up the Wall Section View: 
1. Open ex8-2.rvt and Save As ex8-3.rvt. 
2. Switch to the Cross Section 1 view.

Office Building: SECTIONS and DETAILS 
Notice that a view was added in the Sedions category of the Prqjed BrOJvser. Because Callouts 
are detail references off of a section view, it is a good idea to keep the section view name 
similar to the name of the callout. 
Additionally, Callouts differ from section views in that the callout is not referenced in every 
related view. This example is typical, in that the building sections are referenced from the 
plans and wall sections are referenced from the building sections. The floor plans can get 
pretty messy if you try to add too much information to them. 
6. Double-click on the reference bubble portion of the Callout tag to open the Callout 
of Cross Section 1 view (Figure 8-3.2).

the icon and the two elements you want to join (this works on many types of elements). See 
Figure 8-3.6 for a "joined" condition; every view is updated! 
You can use the Detail Lines tool to add more 
detailed information to the drawing. For example, you 
could show the masonry coursing, window trim, brick 
vents/weeps and flashing. 
As before, you can tum off and adjust the crop region.

This exercise will explore adding notes and dimensions to your wall section. 
Add Notes and Dimensions to Callout of Cross Section 1: 
1. Open ex8-3.rvt and Save As ex8-4.rvt. 
2. Switch to Callout of Cross Section 1 view. 
3. Adjust the View Properties so the crop region is not visible (via the Properties Palette 
when nothing is selected in the model). 
4. Add two dimensions and adjust the Level datum symbol location as shown in 
Figure 8-4.1. 
TIP: Dimension to the masonry opening. 
These dimensions are primarily for the masons 
laying up the CMU and Brick. Typically, when an 
opening is dimensioned in masonry, the dimension 
has the suffix M.O. This stands for Masonry 
Opening, clearly representing that the dimension 
identifies an opening in the wall. You will add the 
suffix next. 
5. Select the dimension at the window opening 
and pick the Blue text (i.e., 4' -0"). 
6. Type M.O. in the Suffix field (Figure 8-4.2). 
7. Click OK

Office Building: SECTIONS and DETAILS 
This exercise shows you how to develop 2D details which are not tied to the 3D model in 
any way. Why would you want to do this, you might ask? Many design firms have developed 
detail libraries over the years for typical conditions. These details contain a significant 
amount of embodied knowledge of the firm as a whole. Many notes and dimensions have 
been added which cover certain situations that have come up and created problems or cost 
the firm money. For example, a window head detail might show flashing, which directs any 
moisture in the wall out - rather than into - the window or inside the building. Well, a note 
might have been added to instruct the contractor to tum the flashing up at each side of the 
window to ensure the moisture does not just run off the end of the flashing and stay in the 
wall. 
If every detail were a live cut through the model, the designer would have to spend the time 
adding all these notes and dimensions, and more importantly try not to forget any, even if 
typing them from a printed reference page - similar to what you are doing with this book. 
(Have you missed anything yet, and had to go back and make a correction?) Furthermore, if 
the part of the model changes, the detail could be messed up. Or, an item being detailed 
from the live model might change and not be the typical condition anymore. 
So, as you can see, there are a number of reasons a design firm maintains and utilizes static 
2D details. NOTE: Sometimes these details are used as startingpoints for similar details. This sat-es time not 
hating to start from scratch. 
It should also be pointed out that standard details should always be reviewed before 
"dumping" them into a project. If a note says "Apply fireproofing to underside of metal roof 
deck" and your building has precast concrete plank, you need to change the note and the 
drawing. All other parts of the detail may perfectly match the project design you are working 
on. 
Linking an AutoCAD Drawing 
This first exercise will explore linking AutoCAD drawings into Revit when the need to use 
legacy details arises. 
It is better to recreate these details in native Revit format rather than linking an AutoCAD 
drawing. Any external files linked in have the potential to slow your BIM experience and 
introduce corruption. This is especially true with site plans created in AutoCAD or 
AutoCAD Civil 3D. Site plans are often a great distance from the origin (i.e., 0,0,0 
coordinate in an AutoCAD drawing) and this creates several issues. 
In general, it is best to avoid AutoCAD DWG files within Revit. However, when it is 
required, they should always be Unked in and not Imported, and never Exploded. Importing 
DWG files makes them difficult to manage and exploding them creates lots of extra text 
styles, fill patterns and other items that clutter the BIM database.

AutoCAD DWG files can be linked directly into a plan view and be used as an underlay to 
sketch walls and place doors and windows, when modeling an existing building in Revit that 
has been drawn in a traditional CAD program. 
In our example, we have a DWG file which contains a detail we want to reference and place 
on a sheet for our office building project. To do this, you create a Drqfting VieJv and link the 
CAD file into the drafting view. A Drqfting VieJv is a 2D drawing within the BIM project that 
has no direct relationship to the 3D model.

You now have a new section, under VieJvs in the Prqjed BrOJvser, called Drqfting VieJvs (Detail). 
Within this section is your new Drqfting VieJv - Typical Roof Drain Detail. 
Within this new drafting view you could begin sketching a detail from scratch using the 
various tools on the Annotate and Modijj tabs. Or, in this example, you may link in a DWG 
file. 
This roof drain detail is a good example of why 2D details are still useful in Revit, either 
DWG or native Revit. As previously mentioned, many firms spend years developing 
standard details. These details have notes that have been added to and edited as building 
materials change and problems occur. It would take a lot of time to cut a section at a 3D 
roof drain in the model and then add all the notes, if one can even remember what all the 
notes are. Now, repeat this for 20 to 50 other items throughout the building project. 
Now you will link in the DWG file from the CD that came with this textbook.

The drawing can be selected and moved around within the drafting view, but it cannot be 
edited. If you need to make changes to this drawing, you would have to do it in AutoCAD. 
Revit will automatically update any linked files when the project file is opened. It can also be 
done manually using the Manage IJnks tool. 
When DWG files are 
linked into Revit, a 
specific set of line 
weights are used. 
These settings can be 
seen by clicking the

Creating 2D Details: 
Autodesk Revit Architecture has a large array of 2D detail components that can be used to 
create 2D details. These components allow for efficient detail drafting and design. Not every 
detail in Revit is generated from the 3D model; the amount of modeling required to make 
this happen is restricted by time, file size and computing power. The following is an outline 
of the overall process; this will be followed by a few exercises for practice: 
FIGURE 8-5.6 
• 
To create a 2D detail one would create a drafting view via VieJv > Create > 
Drqfting View, providing a name and selecting a scale. 
• 
Once the drqfting tieJv has been created, Detail Lines and Filled Regions 
(via the Annotate tab) can be added. 
• 
In addition to Detail IJnes and Filled Regions, one can insert pre-drawn items 
from the Detail Library. 
1. Select Component > Detail Components from the Annotate tab. 
11. Select Load Family from the Ribbon. 
111. Click Imperial Detail Library from the shortcut bar on the left of 
the Open dialog. 
tv. Browse to the specific "CSI organized" folder; for example,

Flooring Details 
The first two details you will draw are simple details consisting of Detail IJnes, Filled Regions, 
Text and Dimensions. 
You will draw a high-end floor and wall base detail known as terrazzo. This finish is poured 
in a liquid state, allowed to dry and then polished to a smooth finish. The colors and 
aggregate options are virtually unlimited (for example, you could use a clear epoxy resin and 
place leaves within the flooring). 
1. Per the steps previously covered in 
this section, create a new drafting 
vtew. 
a. Name: Terrazzo Base Detail 
b. Scale: 
3"=1'-0" 
You will now draw the detail shown below. 
See the next page for specific steps.

Wide Lines.

3. Draw a vertical line, also 8" long, using the Medium Lines style. This line should be 
about 2" from the right edge of the floor line Gust so your detail is generally 
proportional to the one presented in the book). 
Next, you will offset the two lines just drawn to quickly create the terrazzo floor and base. 
4. Select Modify -7 Offset on the Ribbon.

6. Pick the floor line when the preview line appears above the horizontal line. 
7. Now Offset the vertical line 3/8" to the left. 
Your drawing should now look like the image to the right (less 
the arrows). Next you will change the top horizontal line to a 
lighter line weight, offset it up 6" to create the top of the wall 
base and then use the Fillet An· feature to round off the 
corners.

Ribbon. 
9. Offset the top horizontal line upward 6" inches. 
10. Select the new horizontal line and then drag its right 
end grip over to the vertical line. 
Next you will trim and round the corners in one step. 
11. Select the Detail Line tool from the Annotate tab. 
a. Select Fillet Arc from the Drmv panel.

12. Click on the portion of the two lines you want to 
remain (see the two numbered clicks in the image 
to the right). 
The line is now trimmed and an arc has been added. 
13. Repeat these steps to round off the top edge of 
the wall base. 
Next you will add a Filled Region to represent the terrazzo material with a pattern when 
viewed in a section. When creating the perimeter of a Filled Region you also specify a IJne Style 
(similar to the Detail IJne tool). In this case you will use Thin IJnes for all but the left edge of 
the floor thickness. There you will change the IJne Style to be an invisible line so as not to 
suggest a joint or the end of the flooring; but rather, that the flooring material continues.

Selecting Pick Lines will allow you to quickly create the boundary of your Filled Region based 
on lines already drawn. So you simply click on a line rather than pick two points to define 
the start and endpoints of each edge. However, with the Line and Arc options you could also 
snap to the endpoints of the previously drawn linework. The one drawback to using the Pick 
Lines option is you will have to trim a few comers, because the Filled Region tool requires that 
a clean perimeter be defined (similar to the floor and roof tools). 
1 5. Pick the five lines and two arcs which define the edges of the floor and wall base. 
16. Switch to the line option in the Drmv panel and then set the Line S0Jle to <Invisible

The last thing you will do is add the notes and dimensions. These will be the correct scale 
based on the Vien; St-ule setting (which should be 3" = 1' -0"). Once you place the dimension 
you will learn how to adjust the dimension style so the 0' does not show up. 
29. Add the dimension and two notes as shown.

Your dimension should now only say 6" rather than 
0' -6". Because you changed this in the T)pe Properties, 
all dimensions will have this change applied (both 
previously saved and new). If you want to have both

dimension type, which is similar to creating new 
wall, door and window types! 
The last thing you will look at is adjusting the arrow

Now you will draw another detail using the same tools and techniques. Keep in mind, every 
detail needs to go in its own drqfting zieJv. This is required for Revit to manage the reference 
bubbles on the sheets. 
40. Create a new drafting view; 
a. Name: Floor Transition Detail 
b. Scale: 
3" = 1' -0" 
41 . Draw the detail per the following guidelines: 
a. The detail will be plotted at 3"=1'-0" (this determines the text and leader 
size). 
b. Tile pattern is Diagonal Up-Small; this requires a new Fill Region style (see 
the previous exercise for more information). 
c. The grout (i.e., area under tile) is to be hatched with Sand - Dense; this also 
requires a new Fill Region style. 
d. Draw the tile '//' thick and 4" wide. 
e. The grout is '//' thick. 
f. The resilient flooring is shown 'Is" thick. 
g. The solid surface (e.g., Corian) threshold is 1%" wide; draw an arc between 
the two floor thicknesses. 
h. Hatch the threshold with the solid hatch: 
i. Duplicate the Solid Black Filled Region style. 
ii. Name the new style: Solid Gray. 
iii. Set the hatch's color to a light gray (RGB color 192). 
1. 
The bottom concrete floor line is to be the heaviest line.

The previous drawing would typically occur in a door opening and the location of the door 
would also be shown in the detail. This lets the contractor know that the threshold is to 
occur directly below the door slab. 
Base Cabinet with Drawers: 
This section will dive right into drawing cabinet details. These are often based on industry 
standard dimensions so many of the dimensions and material thicknesses can be omitted 
(assuming the project manual/specification covers this). 
42. Create a drafting view: 
a. Name: Base Cabinet Detail - Drawers 
b. Scale:

Revit provides many Detail Components which aid in creating 2D details. Things such as side 
views of bar joists, section views of steel beams and angles, and more are available in the 
Detail Component library. The detail below takes advantage of three Detail Components which 
ship with Revit: particle board, lumber and the counter top. The only things drawn with the 
Detail IJne tool are the tops of the drawers, the drawer pulls (i.e., handles) and the heavy 
wall/floor lines.

d. Do not add dimensions yet. 
Be careful not to click on the grips when the countertop is selected as this will adjust its

type parameter. 
Next, you will load and place the 2x lumber. The two on the floor are 4" high, which are cut 
down from a 2x6. So you will load a 2x4 Fami!J and then create a duplicate and adjust the

Office Building: SECTIONS and DETAILS 
Some things you should know about detailing: 
In the previous steps you drew a typical detail showing a standard base cabinet with drawers. 
Interior designers occasionally draw these details, but more often, they simply review them 
for finishes. 
The countertop material needs to match that which is specified in the Project Manual and 
intended for the project. For example, a PLAM (i.e., plastic laminate) countertop would not 
be appropriate in a laboratory where chemicals would be used. 
The base of the cabinet typically has the same wall base as the adjacent walls. For example, if 
the walls have a rubber base (also referred to as a resilient base), the toe-kick area of the base 
cabinet would also receive a rubber base; this is the type of base shown in the previous 
detail. If the project only had ceramic tile wall base, you would show that. 
The notes for details (or any drawing) should be simple, generic and to the point. Notice in 
previously drawn detail that the note for the base does not indicate whether the base is 
rubber, tile or wood. This helps avoid contradictions with the room finish schedule. The 
note simply says the cabinet and floor are to receive a finish and instructs the contractor to 
go to the Room Finish Schedule to see what the finish is. This is particularly important in 
buildings that have several variations of floor and base finishes. 
Notes should not have any proprietary or manufactures names in them either. For 
example, you should not say "Sheetrock" in a note because this is the brand name; rather, 
you should use the generic term "gypsum board". Similarly, you would use the term "solid 
plastic" rather than "Corian" when referring to countertops or toilet partitions. In any event, 
whatever term you use on the drawings should be the same term used in the Project Manual! 
One last comment: the Construction Documents set should never have abbreviations within the 
drawings that are not covered in the Abbretiations list, usually located on the title sheet. 
Construction Documents are legal, binding documents, which the contractor must follow to a 
"T." They should not have to guess as to what the designers meant in various notes all over 
the set of drawings. It is better to spell out every word, if possible, only abbreviating when 
space does not permit. You would not want a bunch of abbreviations in your bank loan or 
mortgage papers you were about to sign! Plus, non-documented abbreviations would 
probably not have much merit before a judge or arbitrator in the case of a legal dispute!

Cabinet details do not need to have every nook-and-cranny dimensioned because they are 
very much a standard item in the construction industry. Furthermore, the Project Manual 
usually references an industry standard that the contractor can refer to for typical 
dimensions, thicknesses and grades of wood. 
The vertical dimension shown in the cabinet detail above says "VARIES - SEE ELEV". 
This notation, rather than an actual number, allows the detail to represent more than one 
condition. The interior elevations are required to have these dimensions, which may be the 
standard 36" or the lower handicap-accessible height.

8-33 

Architectural Commercial Design Using Autodesk Revit 2014 
When using the Detail Components you will occasionally run into a few challenges getting 
things to look exactly the way you want them. For example, many firms have traditionally 
shown gypsum board as if it were continuous - not indicating the joints. Most contractors 
understand this and the designer usually does not want to imply the gypsum board be 
installed in a specific way or order. However, the Detail Component feature forces these edge 
lines to appear. Unfortunately we cannot use the IJneJvork tool to set some of the lines in a 
Detail Component to be invisible. 
Another problem you will run into, when using Detail Components, is the fact that everything 
is drawn true to life size. You may think, "Isn't that a good thing?" Usually it is, but some 
things often need to be exaggerated so they are legible on the printed page. Take the metal 
stud runner for example; when placed next to the Gypsum Board detail component it is totally 
hidden because the gypsum line weight is heavier than the runner stud. The best thing to do 
is to edit the Fami!J so the runner stud has a heavier line weight and its thickness is 
exaggerated inward (you don't want to change the overall width. However, this type of 
change is outside the scope of this exercise, so you will do the following: 
68. Erase the runner stud Detail Components and draw Detail Lines using Medium 
Lines - in bound from the gypsum board. 
69. Make the light fixture 4lf/' x 1%" with a 1" circle for the light. Use the Solid Gray 
Fill Region previously created. 
70. Sketch the egg-crate lens using Detail Lines. Create a new Fill Region using the 
Vertical-Small fill pattern. 
71. Add the notes and dimensions shown. 
8-34

Fixed Student Desk at Raised Seating Classroom: 
This detail would work nicely for the fixed desks in the Lecture Classroom. However, 
assuming this detail came from a standard detail library, you would have to coordinate with 
what you have previously drawn in the floor plan. For example, the overall depth shown in 
the detail below is about 1'-5", and the depth drawn in plan is 2'-0" (see page 6-21). They 
would need to match. (You do not have to make any plan changes at this time.)

74. Develop the fixed student desk following these guidelines: 
a. All particle board and trim to be Detail Components. 
b. Tapered wood blocking to have Wood 2 Fill Pattern. 
c. The curvy line pointing to the 1'-0" dimension should be drawn like this: 
1. First add the "PL\M" note using a regular leader; 
11. Use the Detail Line tool; 
111. Select the Spline Drmv option; 
tv. Set the Une Style to Thin; 
v. Sketch the curvy line starting at the corner of the leader. 
d. Add a horizontal Detail Line at the top of the sloped work surface so you have 
something to pick when adding the angle dimension. 
As you can see, some of the Detail Components have odd line weights when placed side-by­
side. Both the wood trim and particle board are in section so they should be the same line 
weight. You would have to edit the family to make this change, which will not be covered at 
this time. 
Using the Keynotes Feature: 
The content that ships with Revit, both 2D and 3D, has a default keynote value assigned to 
it. Keynotes are used to save room and make details look neater; it is a reference number 
rather than a full note, and then an adjacent legend lists what each number means. This 
legend is for all the details on a sheet. You will 
learn how this works next. You will make a copy 
of the Fixed Student Desk, add keynotes and then 
create a keynote legend. 
75. Right-click on the Fixed Student Desk 
item in the Prqjed BrOJvser. 
76. Select Duplicate -7 Duplicated with

Office Building: SECTIONS and DETAILS 
Finally, you can create elevations and sections that reference a drafting view rather than a 
true view of the model. This is another one of those places where you are breaking the 
intelligence ofRevit's drawing sheet and number coordination. 
To do this, you select the Elet-ation or Sedion tool, and rather than picking points in the 
drawing right away, you select a view that already exists in the project from the Options Bar. 
Even though you have not placed any roof drains, you could switch to the Roof plan view 
and add a section mark that references the roof drain detail. 
The following steps do not need to be performed at this time: 
• 
Switch to the Roof floor plan view. 
• 
Select the Section tool on the VieJv tab. 
•

Lesson 9 
Office Building: INTERIOR DESIGN:: 
This lesson explores the various "features," if you will, of a floor plan, such as toilet room 
layouts (i.e., flxtures and partitions), cabinets and casework (e.g., reception counters and 
custom cabinets). Additionally, you will look at placing furniture into your project. 
Toilet room layouts involve placing water closets (toilets), toilet partitions and sinks. These 
rooms have many code issues related primarily to handicapped accessibility. These codes 
vary from state to state (and even city to city). 
You will start this exercise by loading several components to be placed into your project. 
1. Open ex8-5.rvt and Save As ex9-1.rvt. 
2. Select Load Family from the Insert tab and load the following items into the current 
project: 
Local Files (i.e., on your hard drit·e) 
a. Plumbing\Architectural\Fixtures \Water Closet\ 
Toilet-Comercial-Wall-3D .rfa 
b. Plumbing Fixtures \Architectural\ Fixtures\ Urinals\ Urinal-Wall-3D 
Online Files (i.e., Seek.autodesk.r:om tia the Insert tab) 
c. Sink-Wall-Rectangular 
d. Grab Bar-3D 
e. Toilet Stall-Accessible-Front-Braced-3D 
f. Toilet Stall-Braced-3D 
g. Urinal Screen-3D 
These flles represent various families that will be used to design the toilet room. It is possible 
to create custom families for non-typical conditions. 
Figure 9-1.1 shows an example of the various families available for Toilet Stalls on 
Autodesk Revit's web site.

3. Switch to Level l view. 
The next step will be to place the toilet 
stalls. 
4. Using the Component tool, pick 
Toilet Stall-Accessible-Front-
Braced-3D: 60" x 60" Clear 
from the Type S elet.tm: 
5. Zoom in to the toilet rooms (North of the elevator). 
6. Place the toilet stall as shown and then move into place using the Move tool and 
your snaps or the Align tool (Figure 9-1.2). 
Once you move the toilet stall North, 
you will have your first stall in place. 
Next, you will place two standard size 
toilet stalls. 
7. Place two toilet stalls; 
Toilet Stall-Braced-3D: 
36" x 60" Clear as shown in 
Figure 9-1.3.

n 
FIGURE 9-1.2 Accessible Toilet stall 
As with most projects, you will need to modify the model as you develop the design. In this 
case we notice that toilets that are back-to-back and stacked on each floor will require a 
thicker wall to accommodate the fixture brackets (W.C.'s are not hung on the wall by light 
gauge metal studs) and larger piping. You will make this adjustment next.

8. Select the middle wall and the West 
wall and Move them 6" to the West. 
9. Move the far East wall (of the two 
toilet rooms) 6" to the east. 
10. Add an additional 4Jis" gyp. bd. wall 
as shown in Figure 9-1.4. 
TIP: Make sure wall height and base ofiet are correct. 
11. Modify the North wall of the 
elevator shaft to have furring and 
gyp. bd. on the toilet room side. 
TIP: Use the wall rype you created for the stair shafts. 
12. Add the additional components as 
shown in Figure 9-1.4. 
8' 7 1/8" 
Grab Bars-3D 

Architectural Commercial Design Using Autodesk Revit 2014 
As mentioned previously, building codes vary by location. The toilets in the accessible stall 
area are usually mounted higher than the typical fixtures. When a room has more than one 
urinal, one is usually required to be mounted lower for accessibility. Another example is that 
Minnesota requires a separate vertical grab bar above the horizontal grab bar on the wall 
next to the toilet. 
You will now copy the revised walls and toilet room layout to the other levels. The elevator 
shaft extends through each floor, so you will not have to copy that wall. Looking at the 
upper levels you can see the revised elevator shaft wall and the old wall layout (Figure 9-1.5). 
It will be easier to delete the stud walls rather than modify the existing walls. 
13. Delete the walls, per Figure 9-1.6, for Levels 2 and 3. 
14. Copy the walls and toilet room layout (for Level 1) to the clipboard and Paste 
Aligned to Levels 2 and 3. 
FIGURE 9-1.5 Walls on upper levels 
FIGURE 9-1.6 Walls deleted 
Interior Elevation View: 
Next, you will set up an interior elevation view for the Men's Toilet Room. You will also add 
a mirror above the sinks in elevation view. 
9-4 

Office Building: INTERIOR DESIGN 
15. Switch to Level l and place an interior Elevation tag looking towards the west 
wall (wall with fixtures on it); see Figure 9-1.7. 
16. Rename the new view to: Men's Toilet - Typical in 
the Prqjed BrOJvser. 
17. Switch to the new view. Adjust the Crop Region so the 
concrete slab is not visible. Your view should look 
like Figure 9-1.8. 
You may see the building section reference as shown in 
Figure 9-1.8. This would not typically be shown in an interior 
elevation view, especially because it does not intersect the 
elevation view. You will remove the reference in the next 
step. You cannot simply delete it, because that will remove it 
from all views and delete the section. 
FIGURE 9-1.7 Elevation tag added 
18. If you see the building section tag, click on the section reference to select it and then 
right-click and pick Hide in View -7 Elements from the pop-up menu (Figure 9-
1.9).

Adjusting the Reflected Ceiling Plan: 
Because you added a wall in the East toilet room, the definition of the room that the 
reflected ceiling plan uses is incorrect. You will adjust that next. You will have similar 
problems on Levels 2 and 3 if you added ceilings there, because you deleted walls and then 
pasted new walls. 
22. Switch to Level l RCP (Figure 9-1.11). 
23. Hide the Interior Elevation tag from this view (via right-dick and Hide in View). 
24. Delete the ceiling in the Men's Toilet room. 
25. Place a new ceiling to fit within the room. 
26. Select the ceiling grid in the atrium, and then pick Edit Boundary to

When you select the Model line tool, Revit will ask you what plane you want to draw on 
(Figure 9-2.7). This will allow Revit to restrict all your line work to a particular plane. 
Otherwise you would not know exactly at what depth the lines would be drawn on. 
15. Select Pick a Plane (Figure 9-2.7) and then pick the wall in the elevation view (use 
the TAB key and make sure the tool tip lists the wall before picking the plane). 
TIP: If you are prompted to switch to a difirent riew,you selected the wrong plane. Click cancel and try 
again.

16. Draw the line, snap to the endpoint of the base cabinet toe kick. 
FYI: The main difirem-e between the Model Line tool on the Anhitedure tab and the Detail Line tool on the 
Annotate tab is this: a'!)' line work drawn with the Model Line tool will show up on other tiews which see that suifac-e. 
On the other hand, a'!)' line work drawn with the Detail Line tool will onfy show up in the tiew in which thry were 
cleated. So in this example,you mt!J want to draw the lines using the Detail Line tool so the base does not show up in 
building and wall sedions. Do not change this at this time howet·er. 
17. Select the line and in the Type S eled01 change the Line S tyle to Thin lines.

This lesson will cover the steps required to lay out office furniture. The processes are 
identical to those previously covered for toilets and cabinets. Various manufacturers are 
beginning to provide Revit content; for example take a look at www.hayworth.com. 
Loading the Necessary F amities: 
1. Open ex9-2.rvt and Save As ex9-3.rvt. 
2. Select the Component tool and load the following items into the current project: 
Local Files (i.e., on your hard drit'e) 
a. Work Station Cubicle.rfa (Furniture System) 
b. Work Station Desktops (Furniture System) 
c. Sofa-Pensi (Furniture \Seating) 
d. Chair-Breuer (Furniture \Seating) 
e. Chair-Executive (Furniture \Seating) 
f. Chair-Task Arms (Furniture\Seating) 
g. Table-Round (Furniture\ Table) 
Online Files (i.e., Seek.autodesk.com) 
h. Copier-Floor 
These files represent various families that will be used to design the offices. 
TIP: 
You can set the View mode for the Open dialog box (which is displqyed when you click uad Fami!J). One option is 
Thumbnail mode; this displqys a small thumbnail image for each file in the current folder. This makes it easier to see

Online Content: 
A few locations on the internet provide additional content for use in Revit. Some are free 
and some are not. Hopefully more product manufacturers will start providing content based 
on the products they make; making it easier for people to include that manufacturer's 
product in their project (both the virtual and real projects). 
You have already spent a little time looking at Revit's online content library 
(Seek.autodesk.com). You should spend some more time there so you know what is 
generally available. This will help you to reduce duplicated effort. 
The following sites also contain content that can be downloaded: 
• 
ww.revitcity.com 
• 
Seek.autodesk.com 
• 
revit.autodesk.com/library /html (old Revit content library) 
• 
ww.broutek.com 
• 
ww.turbosquid.com/revit-market 
You should occasionally search the internet to see if additional content becomes available. 
You can do an internet search for "revit content'', make sure to include the quotation marks. 
The rendering content, such as that offered by ww.archvision.com, will be covered in 
Chapter 11.

This lesson will cover the steps required to lay out guardrails. The steps are similar to 
drawing walls; you select your style and draw its path. 
Adding a Guardrail to the Atrium: 
1. Open ex9-3.rvt and Save As ex9-4.rvt. 
2. Switch to Level 2 view. 
3. Select Architecture -7 Circulation -7 
Railing -7 Sketch Path. 
Ra iling 
Ra mp 
Sta ir 
C i rc u I ati o n  
4. Zoom into the Atrium area (South of the elevator). 
At this point you will draw a line representing the path of the guardrail. The railing is offset 
to one side of the line, similar to walls. However, you do not have the Location IJne option as 
you do with the Wall tool, so you have to draw the railing in a certain direction to get the 
railing to be on the floor and not hovering in space just beyond the floor edge. 
5. Draw a line along the edge of the floor as shown in Figure 9-4.1. 
TIP: Select Chain from the Options Bar to draw the railing with ftwer picks. 
Third pick, etc. 
Second pick with

6. Click the green check mark on the Ribbon to finish the Railing tool. 
The railing has now been drawn. In the next step you will switch to a 3D view and see how 
to quickly change the railing style. This will also involve changing the height of the railing. 
Most building codes require the railing height be 42" when the drop to the adjacent surface 
is more than 30"; this is called a guardrail. 
7. Switch to the Difczult 3D view. 
8. Zoom into the railing shown on Level 2, looking at it through the curtain wall. 
(Notice the railing style - Figure 9-4.2.) 
FIGURE 9-4.2 Added railing - 30 view 
9. Select the railing. You may have to use the Tab key to cycle through the various 
selection options. 
10. With the railing selected, select the various railing 
types available in the Type S eledor on the Ribbon. 
When finished make sure Railing: Guardrail ­

Your railing should now look like Figure 9-4.4. Notice that a handrail was added to the 
railing. You should also notice that the handrail is on the wrong side of the guardrail. You 
will adjust that next. 
FIGURE 9-4.4 Railing with new style 
11. Switch to the Level 2 plan view and select the railing. 
12. Click on the Control Arrows to flip the railing orientation. (See the FYI below for 
additional information.) 
13. You can switch back to the 3D view to see the change. 
14. Finally, from the Level 2 plan view, Copy the railing to the clipboard and Paste it 
into the Level 3 view. 
15. Save your project as ex9-4.rvt. 
FYI: The last modijicf1tion, using the cvntrol arows, flipped the railing about the sketc-h lines, so the railing is now 
hanging out in spac-e. You cf1n fix this I?J seleding the railing, die-king 'Đdit path " on the Ribbon, and then moting the 
sketc-h lines in to c-ompensate.

Make sure to examine the railing sample file available on Autodesk Seek; search for Railing 
Samples. You can download this file (railing samples.rvt), open it, select a railing and view 
its properties to see how it works. 
FIGURE 9-4.5

Lesson 10 
Office Building: SCHEDULES:: 
You will continue to learn the powerful features available in Revit. This includes the ability 
to create parametric schedules; you can delete a door number on a schedule and Revit will 
delete the corresponding door from the plan. 
This exercise will look at adding room tags and door tags to your plans. As you insert doors, 
Revit adds tags to them automatically. However, if you copy or mirror a door you can lose 
the tag and have to add it. 
Adding Room Tags: 
You will add a Room Tag to each room on your Level l floor plan. 
1. Select Architecture Í Room & Area Í Room. 
FIGURE 10-1.1 Room tag - Level 1 
Ro o m  
TIP: Change the height of the Room element in the stairs to go up to Let'Cl 3 + 10 '-0 '' tia the Properties Palette ­
and then just "tag" the room at Let'Cls 2 and 3 rather than adding new room oijeds. 
Placing a Room/Room Tag is similar to placing a ceiling in the reflected ceiling plan; as you 
move your cursor over a room, the room (perimeter) highlights. When the room you want to 
place a Room element in is highlighted, you click to place it. 
10-1 

Architectural Commercial Design Using Autodesk Revit 2014 
2. Click your cursor within the atrium area to place a Room, which will also 
automatically place a room tag (Figure 10-1.1). 
By default, Revit will simply label the space "Room" and number it "1". You will change 
these to something different. 
3. Press Esc or select Modify to cancel the Room command. 
4. Click on the Room Tag you just placed to select it. 
5. Now click on the room name text to change it; enter Atrium. 
6. Now click on the room number to change it; enter 100. 
7. Add Room Tags (using the Room tool) for each room on Level l, incrementing each 
room number by 1 (Figure 10-1.1). 
The stair shafts typically are numbered Stair #1, Stair #2, etc. The same number is then 
placed on each level. This is because stair shafts are really one tall room and the finishes 
would apply to the entire shaft, not each floor. When you try to place a tag with the same 
name and number, Revit will warn you; see the tip on the previous page to avoid this 
problem. 
8. Add Room/Tags to Levels 2 and 3. The numbering for Level 2 should start with 200 
and Level 3 should start with 300. (For Level 2, see Figure 1 0-1.2; Level 3, see Figure 
10-1.3.) 
Open Office

FIGURE 10-1.3 Level 3 - Room tags 
Adding Door Tags: 
Next you will add Door Tags to any doors that are missing them. Additionally, you will 
adjust the door numbers to correspond to the room numbers. 
Revit numbers the doors in the order they are placed into the drawing. This would make it 
difficult to locate a door by its door number if door number 1 was on Level 1 and door 
number 2 was on Level 3, etc. Typically, a door number is the same as the room that the 
door swings into. For example, if a door swung into an office numbered 304, the door 
number would also be 304. If the office had two doors into it, the doors would be numbered 
304A and 304B. 
9. Switch to Level l view. 
10. Select Annotate -7 Tag -7 Tag by

Office Building: SCHEDULES 
Generate a Door Schedule 
This exercise will look at creating a door schedule based on the information currently 
available in the building model (i.e., the tags). 
Create a Door Schedule View: 
A door schedule is simply another view of the building model. However, this view displays 
numerical data rather than graphical data. Just like a graphical view, if you change the view it 
changes all the other related views. For example, if you delete a door number from the 
schedule, the door is deleted from the plans and elevations. 
1. Open ex10-1.rvt and Save As ex10-2.rvt. 
2. Select View Í Create Í Schedule/Quantities button 
from the Ribbon. 
3. Select Doors under Category, Make sure Phase is set to New

Your schedule should look 
similar to the one to the left. 
(Figure 10-3.4) 
8. Resize the Name column 
so all the room names 
are visible. Place the 
cursor between the 
Name and Base Finish and 
drag to the right until all 
the names are visible . 
(Figure 10-3.4) 
The formatting (i.e., Bold 
header text) will not show up 
until the schedule is placed on a 
plot sheet. 

Architectural Commercial Design Using Autodesk Revit 2014 
Modifying and Populating a Room Schedule: 
Like the door schedule, the room schedule is a tabular view of the building model. So you 
can change the room name or number on the schedule or in the plans. 
9. In the Room Schedule view, change the name for room 307 (this should be the 
room directly north of the toilet rooms) to MECH/ELEC RM. 
TIP: Click on the current room name and then click on the down-arrow that appears. This git-es you a list of 
all the existing names in the current schedule; othetwise you can rype a new name. 
10. Switch to the Level 3 view to see the updated room tag. 
You can quickly enter finish information to several rooms at one time. You will do this next. 
11. In the Level 3 plan view, select the Rooms (not the room tags) for all private offices -
9 total (Figure 10-3.5). 
REMEMBER: Hold the Ctrl kf!Y down to seled multiple elements. 
TIP: Mot-e the cursor near the room tag but not or·er it to seled the room - the large 'X" will appear when 
the Room is seledable (see image below).

12. Next you will make changes in the Properties Palette, type PP to open it if needed. 
The Parameters listed here are the same as the Fields available for display in the room 
schedule. When more than one tag is displayed and a parameter is not the same (e.g., 
different names), that value field is left blank. Otherwise, the values are displayed for the 
selected Room element. Next you will enter values for the finishes.

13. If the Name field is blank enter OFFICE, so the nine rooms are labeled office. 
14. Enter the following for the finishes (Figure 10-3.6): 
a. Base Finish: 
b. Ceiling Finish: 
c. Wall Finish: 
d. Floor Finish:

16. Switch back to the Room Schedule

You can also enter data directly into the

Lesson 11 
Office Building: SITE and RENDERING:: 
In this chapter you will take a look at Revit's photo-realistic rendering abilities as well as the 
basic site development tools. Rather than reinventing the wheel, Revit chose to use an 
established architectural rendering technology called Mental Ray. Autodesk makes several 
high-end rendering programs like Autodesk 3DS Max, Autodesk Mqya and Mental Ray, which 
work with Revit models in various ways, the integration options improve with each new 
release. You will need Revit Structure or Revit Architecture for the rendering exercises as 
Revit MEP does not support the rendering feature set. 
This lesson will give the reader a quick overview of the site tools available in Revit. The site 
tools are not intended to be an advanced site development package. Autodesk has other 
programs much more capable of developing complex sites such as Autodesk Land Desktop 
2009 and AutoCAD Civil 3D 2014. These programs are used by professional Civil Engineers 
and Surveyors. The contours generated from these advanced civil CAD programs can be 
used to generate a topography object in Revit. 
In this lesson you will create a topography object from scratch - you will also add a sidewalk. 
Once the topography object (the topography object, or element, is a 3D mass that represents 
part or all of the site) is created the grade line will automatically show up in building and wall 
sections, exterior elevations and site plans. The sections even have the earth pattern filled in 
below the grade line. 
As with other Revit elements you can select the object after it is created and set various 
properties for it; such as surface material, Phase, Etc. One can also return to Sketch mode to 
refine or correct the surface - this is done in the same way most other Sketched objects are 
edited - by selecting the item and clicking Edit on the Options Bar.

Overview of Site tools located on the Ribbon: 
Below is a brief description of what the site tools are used for. After this short review you 
will try a few of these tools on your office project.

Toposurface: Creates a 3D surface by picking points (specifying the elevation of each point 
picked) or by using linework, within a linked AutoCAD drawing, that were created at the 
proper levels. 
Subregion: Allows an area to be defined within a previously drawn Toposuifar-·e - the result is 
an area within the Toposuifar-·e that can have a different material than the Toposuifar-·e itself. The 
Subregion is still part of the Toposuifar--e and will move with it when relocated. If a Subregion is 
selected and deleted the original surface/ properties for that area are revealed. 
Split Surface: This tool is similar to the Subregion tool in every way except that the result is 
separate surfaces that can intentionally, or accidentally, be moved apart from each other. If a 
split surface is selected and deleted it results in a subtraction or a void relative to the original 
Toposuifar-·e. 
Merge Surfaces: After a surface has been split into one or more separate surfaces you can 
merge them back together. Only two surfaces can be merged together at a time. The two 
surfaces to be merged must share a common edge or overlap. 
Graded Region: This tool is used to edit the grade of a Toposuifar-·e that represents the existing 
site conditions and the designer wants to use Revit to design the new site conditions. This 
tool is generally only meant to be used once; when used it will copy the existing site 
conditions to a new phase and set the existing site to be demolished in the new construction 
phase. The newly copied site object can then be modified for the new site conditions. 
Property Line: Creates property lines (in plan views only). 
Building Pad: Used to define a portion of site to be subtracted when created below grade 
(and added when created above grade). An example of how this might be used is to create a 
Pad that coincides with a basement floor slab -which would remove the ground in section 
above the basement floor slab (otherwise the basement would be filled with the earth fill 
pattern). Several pads can be imposed on the same Toposuifar--e element. 
11-2 

Office Building: SITE and RENDERING 
Parking Component: These are parking stall layouts that can be copied around to quickly 
layout parking lots. Several types can be loaded - which specify both size and angle. 
Site Component: Items like benches, dumpsters, etc. that are placed directly on the 
Toposurface, at the correct elevation at the point picked. 
Label Contours: Adds an elevation label to the selected contours. 
FYI: Contours are automatical!J created based on the Toposurface. 
Site Settings: 
The Site Settings dialog controls a few key project 
wide settings related to the site - below is a brief 
description of these settings. 
The Site Settings dialog is accessed from the 
arrOJv link in the lower-right comer of the Model 
Site panel. You should note that various tools 
under the Settings menu affect the entire project, 
not just the current view. 
Contour Line Display: This controls if the 
contours are displayed when the Toposurface is 
visible (via the check box) and at what interval. If 
the Interralis set to 1'-0" you will see contour

lines that follow the ground's surface and each line represents a vertical change of 1'-0" from 
the adjacent contour line (the contour lines alone do not tell you what direction the surface 
slopes in a plan view - this is where contour labels are important). The Passing Through 
Elez-ation setting allows control over where the contour intervals start from. This is useful 
because architects usually base the first floor of the building on elevation 0' -0" (or 1 00' -0") 
and the surveyors and Civil Engineers will use the distance above sea level (e.g. 1009.2'). So 
this feature allows the contours to be reconciled between the two systems. The Additional 
Contours section allows for more "contour" detail to be added within a particular area 
(vertically) - on a very large site you might want 1 '-0" contours only at the building and 1 0'-
0" contours everywhere else. However, this only works if the building is in a distinctive set 
of vertical elevations. If the is site relatively level or an adjacent area shares the same set of 
contours you will have undesirable results. 
Section Graphics: This area controls how the earth appears when it is shown in section (e.g. 
exterior elevations, building sections, wall sections, etc.). Here is where the pattern is selected 
that appears in section (the pattern is selected from the project "materials" similar to the 
process for selecting the pattern to be displayed within a wall when viewed in section. The 
Elevation of poche base controls the depth of the pattern in section views relative to the 
grade line. 
Property Data: This section controls how angles and lengths are displayed for information 
describing property lines.

"site" categories turned on so they are automatically visible once they are created. Next you 
will take a quick look at the VieJv Range for this view so you understand how things are setup. 
3. Make sure nothing is selected and a command is not active by clicking the Modify 
tool. This will insure you have access to the VieJv Properties via the Properties Palette.

5. In the VieJv Depth section, set the Urel to Unlimited. 
This change will ensure everything shows up on a steeper site. 
6. Click OK 
You are now ready to create the site object. The element in Revit which represents the site is 
called Toposuiface. 
TIP: Stmdural engineers can use the toposuiface tool to mode/ledge rock, which would aid in determining how deep 
foundations need to be.

By default the Place Point tool is selected on the Ribbon, you are now in sketch mode. This 
tool allows you to specify points within the view at various elevations - Revit will generate a 
3D surface based on those points, so the more points you provide the more accurate the 
surface. Notice, on the Options Bar (Figure 11-1.3) that you can enter an elevation for each 
point as you click to place them on the screen.

Figure 11-1.4 Partial South Elevation 
What elewtion should I enter on the Options Bar? 
The elevation you enter for each point should relate 
to the level datums setup in your project - for 
example, look at your South exterior elevation 
(Figure 1 1-1.4). Recall that the first floor is set to 
0' -0". 
As you can see in the South elevation, the only place 
you would want to add points at an elevation of 0'-0" 
would be at the doors. Everywhere else should be at 
about -4" so the grade does not rise higher than the 
top of the foundation wall and come into contact 
with the brick, and possibly block the weeps and 
brick vents. 
8. With the Elewtion set to 0'-0" pick the six 
points shown in Figure 11-1.5; these points 
are at the exterior door locations. 
TIP: You can switch to the Level l Floor Plan tiew while in the Toposuiface tool, just click the Place Point tool again 
on the Ribbon.

11. Select the green check mark on the Ribbon to finish the Toposuiface. 
Revit has now created the Toposuiface based on the points you specified. Again, the more 
points you add the more refined and accurate the surface will be. 
Ideally you would use the Toposuiface tool to create a surface from a surveyors' points file or 
contour lines drawn in an AutoCAD file - Revit can automatically generate surfaces from 
these sources, rather than you picking points. This process is beyond the scope of this 
tutorial. 
12. Switch to the 3D view 
to see your new ground 
surface (Figure 1 1-1. 7).

Figure 11-1.8 Section with ground pattern added 
If your building has a basement or space partially below grade you will need to add a 
Building Pad to "stamp" out an area of the Toposuiface. To add one you select the tool, draw 
an outline in a plan view and then specify the depth, or height, of the pad. The Toposuiface 
then removes, or adds, ground below the Building Pad. If you have a stepped basement you 
will need multiple Building Pads. Their edges can align but they cannot overlap. 
Next you will quickly create a sidewalk to wrap up this lesson. 
You can use the Subregion tool or the Split Suiface tool to create the driveway and sidewalks. 
The Subregion tool defines an area that is still part of the main site object - the Split Suiface 
tool literally breaks the Toposuiface into separate elements. Splitting a surface can create 
problems when trying to move or edit the site so you will use the Subregion tool. 
13. Switch back to the Site plan view. 
14. Select Massing & Site 7 Modify Site 7 Subregion tool and sketch the lines for 
the sidewalk (Figure 11-1. 9).

Notice that the shade and render material is still the same as the main ground surface. You 
will learn how to change this in a moment. 
When you select the Toposuiface and click Edit Suiface on the Ribbon you can select existing 
points and edit their elevation to refine the surface.

The first thing you will do to prepare a rendering is set up a view. You will use the Camera 
tool to do this. This becomes a saved view that can be opened at any time from the Prqjed 
Brmvser. A Camera view differs from the default 3D view in that it is a perspective view. 
Creating a Camera View: 
1. Open file 1 1-l.rvt and Sare-As to 11-2.rvt. 
2. Open the Level l view and Zoom to Fit, so you can see the 
entire plan.

Assigning Materials to Objects: 
Materials are scanned images or computer generated representations of the materials your 
building will be made of. 
Typically materials are added while the project is being modeled. For example, when you 
create a material (using the Mate1ials command on the Manage tab), you can assign a material 
at that time. Of course, you can go back and add or change it later. Next you will change the 
material assigned for the exterior brick wall. 
9. Switch to Level l plan view. 
10. Select an exterior wall somewhere in plan view. 
11. Click Edit Type in the Properties Palette and then click Edit strudure.

Now, when you render, 
any element (wall, 
ceiling, etc.) that has the 
material Btick, Common 
associated with it, will 
have a red brick 
appearance. 
If you need more than one brick color, you assign that material to another wall type. 
Sun Path 
It is possible to turn on a feature called Sun 
Path. This shows the path of the sun over a day 
and a year. This is accessed from the VieJJ 
Control Barwhile in a 3D view. 
Once on, you can click and drag the sun along its daily or yearly path!

You have limited options for setting up the building's environment. If you need more 
control than what is provided directly in Revit you will need to use another program like 
Autodesk 3DS Design 2014 which is designed to work with Revit and can create extremely 
high quality renderings and animations; it even has day lighting functionality that helps to 
validate LEED® (Leadership in Environmental and Energy Design) requirements. You can 
adjust the lighting and the background.

24. Switch to your camera view: 3D View 1. 
25. Select the Show Rendering Dialog icon on the 
VieJv Control Bar, it looks like a teapot (Figure 1 1-
2.10). 
FYI: This icon is onfy risible when you are in a 3D riew, the 
same as the Narigation Wheel and ViewCube. 
The Renden'ng dialog box is now open (Figure 11-2.11). 
This dialog box allows you to control the environmental 
settings you are about to explore and actually create the 
rendering (which you will do soon!).

The lighting options are very simple choices: is your rendering an interior or exterior 
rendering and is the light source Sun or Artificial - or both? You may have artificial lights 
(i.e., light fixtures like the ones you placed in the office) but still only desire a rendering 
solely based on the light provided by the sun. 
27. In the Ughting section, set the Sun set to Summer Solstice. (This relates to the 
settings in Figure 11-2.9.) 
FYI: In the Sun Settings dialog box, Retit lets you set up t·arious "Henes" which cvntrol time of dt!J. Two examples 
would be: 
•

Looking back at Figure 11-2.9, you would click Duplicate and provide a name. This name 
would then be available from the Sun drop-down list in the Render dialog box. 
28. Click on the Artificial Lighting button 
(Figure 11-2.13). 
You will now see a dialog similar to the one 
shown to the right (Figure 11-2.13). 
You will see several 2x4 light fixtures. The light 
fixtures relate to the fixtures you inserted in the 
reflected ceiling plans. It is very convenient that 
you can place lights in the ceiling plan and have 
them ready to render whenever you need to (i.e., 
render and cast light into the scene!). Here you 
can group lights together so you can control 
which ones are on (e.g., exterior and interior 
lights). 
29. Click Cancel to close the

32. Close the Rendetings dialog by clicking the "X" in the upper right; all your render 
settings will be saved for this view. 
Next you will place a few trees into your rendering. You will adjust their exact location so 
they are near the edge of the framed rendering, so as not to cover too much of the building.

After a few minutes, depending on the speed of your computer, you should have a rendered 
image similar to Figure 1 1-2.18 below. You can increase the quality of the image by adjusting 
the quality setting in the Render dialog. However, these higher settings require substantially 
more time to generate the rendering. The last step before saving the Revit project file is to 
save the rendered image to a file. 
FYI: Each time you make changes to the model, you will hat·e to re-render the tiew to get an updated image. 
Depending on exact!J how your tiew was setup, you mqy be able to see light from one of the light figures in the office of 
the Atrium. Alro, notice the railing through the curtain wall; Retit has the glass in the windows set to be transparent!

This exercise will introduce you to a view tool called Section Box. This tool is not necessarily 
related to renderings, but the two tools together can produce some interesting results. The 
Section Box works in any 3D, even camera views. This can be used throughout the design 
process to better visualize your model. 
Setting up the 3D View: 
1. Open file ex1 1-2.rvt and Save As ex11-3.rvt. 
2. Switch to the Difault 3D view via the 3D icon on the QAT (not the 3D VieJv 1 from 
Exercise 1 1-2). 
3. Make sure nothing is selected so the Properties Palette is showing the View Properties. 
4. Activate the Section Box parameter and then click OK. 
You should see a box appear around your building, similar to Figure 11-3.1. When selected, 
you can adjust the size of the box with its grips. Anything outside the box is not visible. This 
is a great way to study a particular area of your building while in an isometric view. You will 
experiment with this feature next.

Duplicating a Material: 
It is important to know how to properly duplicate a Material in your model so you do not 
unintentionally affect another Material. The information on this page is mainly for reference 
and does not need to be done in your model. 
If you Duplicate a 
Material in your model, 
the Appearance 
Asset will be 
associated to the new 
Material AND the 
Material you copied it 
from! For example, in 
the first image ( the 
right), we will right­
click on Carpet (1) and 
duplicate it. Before we 
duplicate it, notice the 
Appearance Asset 
named "RED" is not 
shared (arrow #3). 
Once you have 
duplicated a Mate1ial, 
notice the two carpet 
materials, in this 
example (second 
image), now indicate 
they both share the 
same Appearance Asset. 
Changing one will 
affect the other. Click 
the Duplicate this 
asset icon in the upper 
right (arrow #3). 
Once the Appearance 
Asset has been 
duplicated (third 
image), you can expand 
the information section 
and rename the asset. 
You can now make 
changes to this material 
without affecting other 
materials.

Creating an interior rendering is very similar to an exterior rendering. This exercise will walk 
through the steps involved in creating a high quality interior rendering. 
Setting up the Camera View: 
1. Open ex1 1-3.rvt and Save As ex11-4.rvt. 
2. Open Level 2 view. 
3. From the QAT, select 3D View -7 Camera. 
4. Place the Camera as shown in Figure 11-4.1. 
Revit uses default heights for 
the camera and the target. 
These heights are based on 
the current level's floor 
elevation. These reference 
points can be edited via the 
camera properties. 
FIGURE 11-4.1 Camera placed - Level 2 view 
Revit will automatically open the newly generated camera view. Your view should look 
similar to Figure 11-4.2. 
FYI: Make sure you created the c(Jmera on Let-el 2 and pic-ked the points in the mmd order. 
11-28 

FIGURE 11-4.2 Material selector 
5. Using the Crop Region 
rectangle, modify the view to 
look like Figure 11-4.3.

9 .  Click Apply. 
Your interior camera view should now look 
similar to Figure 11-4.6. This would be a 
person standing on Level 1 looking up. The 
vertical lines are distorted due to the wide field 
of view (crop region). This is similar to what a 
camera with a 10-1 5mm lens would get in the 
finished building.

Top Right. 
13. Click Render to being the

14. Click Export from the Rendering dialog box to save the image to a file on your hard 
drive. Name the file Atrium.jpg Qpeg file format). 
You can now open the Atriumjpg file in Adobe Photoshop or insert into MS Word to 
manipulate or print. 
To toggle back to the normal hidden view, click Show the Model from the Rendering dialog 
box. 
There are many things you can do to make the rendering look even better. You can add 
interior light fixtures and props (e.g., pictures on the wall, items on the counter top, and 
lawn furniture). Once you add interior lights, you can adjust the Sun setting to nighttime and 
then render a night scene. 
TIP: Setting the output to Printer rather than Screen allows you to generate a higher resolution image. Thus, between 
the Quality setting and the output settingyou cfln create an extremelY high quality rendering, but it might take hours, if 
not dt!JS, to process! 
Revit also gives you the ability to set a material to be self-illuminating. This will allow you to 
make a button on the dishwasher look like it is lit up or, if applied to the glass on the ranger 
door, like the light in the oven is on! You can also set a lamp shade to glow when a light 
source has been defined under it so it looks more realistic.

Rendering a Night Scene: 
One more variation we will look at is rendering the interior atrium view at nighttime. This 
involves adjusting the sun settings so the Sun is not considered and making sure you have 
the correct number of light fixtures to light the space being rendered.

Artificial Only. 
1 8. While in the camera view for the Atrium, click on 
the Render button. 
When the rendering is completed you will have a night 
view of your interior atrium. This clearly shows the effect 
the 2x4 light fixtures have on the rendering, as they are the 
primary light source for this rendering. Your image should 
look similar to Figure 11-4.8. 
You can also try this (especially if you have placed light 
fixtures for the entire building) on your exterior camera 
view. Nighttime renderings can be very dramatic. 
The image to the left is a 
pool created and rendered 
in Revit. The rendering is 
only using artificial lights 
and the "water" material is 
distorting the pool light 
and the striping on the 
bottom of the pool.

Revit provides a few RPC (Rich Photorealistic Content) people to add to your renderings. 
These are files from a popular company that provides 3D photo content for use in 
renderings (http:/ /ww.archvision.com). You can buy this content in groupings Oike college 
students) or per item. In addition to people, they offer items like cars, plants, trees, office 
equipment, etc.

Your rendering should now 
have people in it and look 
similar to Figure 11-5.4. 
Adding people and other 
"props" gives your model a 
sense of scale and makes it 
look a little more realistic. 
After all, architecture is for 
people. These objects can be 
viewed from any angle. Try a 
new camera view from a 
different angle to see how the 
people adjust to match the 
view and perspective, maybe 
from the third floor looking 
down to Level 1.

Revit also has several settings which can make your camera view look more realistic without 
doing a rendering. The image below is an example. It has the Visual St:Jle set to Realistic 
(notice even the RPC people are visible), which creates a nice bright image. The view also 
has Ambient Shadows and Photographic Exposure enabled in the view's Graphic Displqy 
Options dialog. Another option is to set the Visual St:Jle to Ray Trace.

Lesson 12 
Office Building: CONSTRUCTION DOCUMENTS 
SET:: 
This lesson will look at bringing everything you have drawn thus far together onto sheets. 
The sheets, once set up, are ready for plotting. Basically, you place the various views you 
have created on sheets. The scale for each view is based on the scale you set while drawing 
that view, which is important to have set correctly because it affects the text and symbol 
sizes. When finished setting up the sheets, you will have a set of drawings ready to print, 
individually or all at once. See the view on sheets for additional information. 
Creating a Sheet View: 
1. Open ex1 1-5.rvt and Save As

NOTE: The drawing number for this sheet is added 
automaticalfy. The next tiew you add will be number 2. The 
tiew name is listed. This is another reason to rename the 
eleration and section tiews as you create them. Also notice 
that the drawing scale is listed. Again, this comes from the 
scale settingfor the Lerel 1 tiew. 
11. Zoom Out to see the entire sheet again. 
12. Add two more sheets and set up Levels 2 and 3 on them: 
a. Sheet A102 7 Level 2 Floor Plan 
b. Sheet A103 7 Level 3 Floor Plan 
NOTE: When you create a new sheet, most of the titleblock is filled in and the number has increased f?y 1. This 
information can be changed if needed. 
TIP: Back in the tiew, ifyou select the Crop Region, you can select Edit Crop to adjust the perimeter to be L-shaped 
if needed. This also works with the Callout tool on the View tab. 
Setting Up Exterior Elevations: 
Next you will set up the exterior elevations on the A200 series sheets. 
13. Create a new Sheet and adjust the title block data: 
a. Sheet Title: Exterior Elevations 
b. Sheet Number: A200 
14. Drag the South elevation view onto the sheet. Place the drawing near the lower 
right. 
15. Drag the North elevation view onto the same sheet. Place the drawing so that the 
drawing title tag is aligned. (Revit will snap to this position vertically.) 
TIP: When placing a tiew on a sheet, Retit will displqy a dashed reference line when the model portion of the 
tiew aligns with an adjacent model tiew. This allows you to ensure tiews align with each other on a sheet. 
Your drawing should look similar to Figure 12-1.6. These same steps can be applied to the 
floor plan views to hide the trees if desired.

Next you will turn off the trees in the south view. Normally you would turn them off in all 
views. However, you will only turn them off in the south view to show that you can control 
visibility per view on a sheet. 
16. Click anywhere on the South elevation view to 
select it. 
17. Now Right-Click and select Activate View 
from the pop-up menu (see image to right). 
At this point you are in the viewport and can make 
changes to the project model to control visibility, which

22. Create another sheet for the other two exterior elevations (East and West); the sheet 
should be number A201. 
Now you will stop for a moment 
and notice that Revit is 
automatically referencing the 
drawings as you place them on 
sheets. 
23. Switch to Level l (see 
Figure 12-1.8). 
Notice in Figure 12-1.8 that the 
number A200 represents the sheet 
number that the drawing can be 
found on. The number one (1) is 
the drawing number to look for on 
sheet A200.

25. Add a cross section, in plan view, through the atrium area. 
26. Add the three building sections as shown in Figure 12-1.9.

27. Switch to Let·el 1 plan view and zoom into the area shown in Figure 12-1.10. 
Notice, again, that the reference bubbles are automatically filled in when the referenced view 
is placed on a sheet. If the drawing is moved to another sheet, the reference bubbles are 
automatically updated. 
You can also see in Figure 12-1.9 (above) that the reference bubbles on the building sections 
are filled in. 
Keep in mind that the Vie1v Sa1le for each view controls the size of the text, dimensions and 
symbols. This ensures all the annotation is the same size on the printed sheet no matter what 
the scale of the drawing/view is. So if you added a 3"=1'-0" detail in the open space, in the 
lower left, on sheet A300 above; the annotation would be the same size as the adjacent 
building section views.

Question: On a large project with hundreds of 
views, how do I know for sure if I have placed 
every view on a sheet? 
Answer: Revit has a feature called BrOJvser 
Organization that can hide all the views that have 
been placed on a sheet. You will try this next. 
28. Take a general look at the Projed BrOJvser to 
see how many views are listed. (See Figure 
12-1.13 on page 12-10.) 
29. Select Views (all) at the top of the Projed 
BrOJvser (Figure 12-1.12). 
30. In the Type Seledor, pick not on sheets 
(Figure 12-1.12). 
31. Notice the list in the Projed BrOJvser now 
has fewer views listed. (See Figure 12-1.15 
on page 12-10.)

Next you will reset the Projed BrOJvser. 
32. Using the process just described, set 
the Projed BrOJvser back to All (Figure 
12-1.12). 
The image to the right, Figure 12-1.13, shows 
the details created in Chapter 8. If you recall, 
these are 2D Drafting Views not directly tied 
to the 3D model.

The sheet border can be modified 
to match the design firms sheet 
design, including adding a scanned 
logo; however creating the logo in 
a native Revit format would be 
better. As you saw, the default 
sheet size in the Revit template is 
30"x42". However, most design 
firms have standardized on 
22"x34" as half size sets can easily 
be printed on 11"x17" paper. Half 
size sets are a nice size for a 
reference set at ones desk. Plus it 
is one-fourth the paper of a full 
size set.

Revit has the ability to create a sheet index automatically. The sheet index is placed on the 
first sheet in the set of drawings to help the contractor find specific information when it is 
needed. Some drawing sets can have hundreds of sheets. You will study this now.

Lesson 13 
Introduction to Revit Content Creation: 
This chapter will introduce you to many of the basic concepts which relate to using and 
creating families. The reader will benefit from learning to create custom content as the need 
often arises. An entire book could be written just on creating Families. This chapter is 
intended to provide a very basic introduction to help get you started. 
Kinds of F amities: 
Autodesk Revit has three primary types of Families; they are 
• 
System Families 
• 
Loadable Families 
• 
In-Place Families. 
This book will mainly focus on the first, that being loadable families. Below is a brief 
explanation of each, followed by a graphic to help tell the story. 
System Families: 
Autodesk describes System Families generally as the portion of 
the building that is constructed on site. Things like walls, 
floors, ceilings, roofs, stairs, wiring, ductwork and piping are 
system families. These families can only be defined and exist 
within the Prqjed Emironment. 
System Families have the ability to host Loadable Families. The 
concept of Hosted Families will be covered in more detail later 
in this section, but here is a simplified explanation: a wall 
hosted Fami!J, such as a window, can only exist within a wall, 
it automatically moves with the wall and is deleted when the 
wall is deleted. 
Unlike loadable families (doors, 
windows, furniture), System 
families cannot exist separately 
outside the project environment. 
This image shows a wall in plan 
with its various layers of material. 
It is too bad that System Families cannot exist outside the project in individual files as it would 
be helpful to have several construction types predefined and load them when needed. As 
opposed to having them predefined within the Revit project template. Therefore, your 
options are to have the System Fami!J predefined in a template file or Copy/Paste them 
between projects. This author prefers to load relevant content and not have extraneous items 
cluttering the selection lists. There are always tricks and workarounds to facilitating this 
concept but it is not as simple as Loadable Families which are described next. 
13-1 

Architectural Commercial Design Using Autodesk Revit 2014 
Loadable Families: 
Building components which are constructed in a factory and 
shipped to the project site are what mainly makeup Loadable 
Families. These are typically just referred to as Families rather 
than "Loadable" Families; this book will mainly use the term 
Fami!J and mean "Loadable" Fami!J. Building elements such as 
doors, windows, furniture, casework, columns, beams, 
appliances, electrical devices (i.e., outlets and switches), 
electrical panels, mechanical equipment (i.e., VAV boxes, air 
handling units and water heaters), duct fittings and plumbing 
fixtures (i.e., toilets and sinks) constitute Loadable Families. 
As the name implies, these Families can be stored outside of the 
Prqjed Emironmentwithin individual files (* .rfa is the family 
extension, versus *rvt which is the project file extension). Using 
a "Load Family" command (found on the Insert tab), one is 
able to bring one or more Families into the Project 
Environment for placement. 
In-Place Families: 
Using a special command (Architedure -? Build -? 
Component -? Model In-Place) within the Prqjed 
Emironment it is possible to create what is called an 
In-Place Fami!J. This feature allows you to create a 
Fami!J within the context of your project. 
Plumbing fixtures, such as this 
toilet, are "loadable", that is, they 
can exist in a file outside of the 
project environment. 
Image credit Stabs, Wingate 
The In-Place Fami!J has a couple of rather significant 
warnings that go along with it. First it is meant for 
one-off items like a reception desk or a unique built 
in cabinet. If you copy an In-Place Fami!J it is really 
just making another independent instance of the 
family - which makes the Revit project file grow in 
size. If you know something will occur more than 
once it should be created as a Loadable Fami!J, not 
Stone trimmed opening created as an in-place 
family to interface with project conditions. 
Image courteD' rfiJ-IB, Inc. 
an In-Place Fami!J. Second, In-Place families cannot ever exist outside the Prqjed Emironment, 
similar to System Families, so the item may not be added to your firm's library for use on 
another project. One last point is from Autodesk's "Revit Platform Performance 
Document"; In-Place Families tend to reduce system performance within the Project 
Environment, especially on larger projects. 
So with these points in mind it is best to use Loadable Families whenever possible. However, 
they are still acceptable in some situations. 
Creating In-Place Families will not specifically be covered in this book. However, the process 
is almost identical in several ways to creating Loadable Families so you should be able to create 
them without too much trouble when needed.

Nested Families: 
It is possible to insert one or more Families into another Fami!J, this is called nesting a family. 
One way in which this is useful might be two double-hung windows, as shown in the image 
above. Although it is possible to simply place the two windows close to each other in the 
project, this does not represent the reality of how the window will need to be documented in 
the project and how it will be delivered to the job site. The two windows would typically be 
mulled together by the window manufacturer and shipped and installed as one unit. By 
nesting one family into another, and then copying it you can quickly create a two window 
unit, which can also be tagged as one window. Lastly, nested families can typically have their 
position controlled more easily by parameters because it acts as one element rather than 
several, or even hundreds. 
13-3 

Architectural Commercial Design Using Autodesk Revit 2014 
Hosted F amities: 
Loadable Families can be created to be Hosted or Non-hosted. As 
briefly mentioned above, the host is a System Fami!J (e.g., a wall, 
floor, ceiling or roof) and when the host is moved, copied or deleted 
the Hosted Family is moved, copied or deleted. 
This feature helps solve some coordination problems but also 
creates a few new problems. 
Problems solzoed: 
When a wall is moved, things like cabinets, toilet fixtures, windows, 
specialty equipment (e.g., paper towel dispensers, grab bars, mirrors, 
etc.), doors and electrical devices (e.g., light switches and outlets) all 
move with the wall. This significantly helps with last minute 
coordination. 
Problems created: 
A few problems have surfaced when using hosted content. For 
example, when designing a kitchen the wall cabinets are hosted. It 
is difficult to quickly mirror one's kitchen design. Also, when a 
supply air diffuser is hosted by a ceiling there is occasionally a 
problem with the ductwork when the ceiling is moved vertically. 
Oftentimes the benefits outweigh the problems created.

TIP: One technique is creatingyour content initial!J as non-hosted and 
then nest that fami!J into a hosted fami!J, gitingyou access to both rypes; 
which is comoenient as it is not possible to com·ert from one type to the 
Ceiling hosted family - Light Fixture

other. Quick examples of wi?J you would want to do this: wall cabinets in 
a kitchen are sometimes hung from rods abor·e a peninsula countertop. 
Alro, light fixtures which are attached to a ceiling are sometimes suspended 
within mechanical rooms or basements which do not hm·e ceilings.

Introduction to Revit Content Creation 
Family Types: 
Revit Families have the ability to hold information in placeholders called parameters. These 
parameters are defined, when created, to hold a specific kind of information; for example, 
text, integer, number, length, currency, yes/no, etc. This helps to validate data when it is 
entered. You cannot type text into a parameter that is set to currency. Finally, some of the 
parameters, such as lengths, can be associated with actual dimensions in the Famify. 
Adjusting a length parameter value actually changes the size of the Famify. 
Wall Cabinet. 
With the information from the previous paragraph in mind, it is time to discuss how slight 
variations are dealt with for content that is geometrically the same; that is for example, a wall 
cabinet is a rectangular box that has four different heights, two different depths and several 
widths. 
It is possible to create 100 individual Families, each of which represents one wall cabinet. 
However, this would be very cumbersome to manage; if one change was required you would 
have to open 100 files and make the same change 100 times. This is where Famify Tjpes are 
employed. 
A single Famify can have several Tjpes defined. A Tjpe is simply a saved state of all the 
parameter settings. For example, the wall cabinet may have two Tjpes defined as follows: 
Type A 
Type B 
Parameter 
Value 
Parameter 
Value 
Width 
24" 
Width 
27" 
Depth 
14" 
Depth 
14" 
Height 
24" 
Height 
24" 
Model 
W241424 
Model 
W271424 
Manufacturer 
Merillat 
Manufacturer 
Merillat 
LEED - 500mi 
Yes/No 
LEED - 500mi 
Yes/No 
Normally the Tjpe name would be more meaningful than Type A and Type B. As you can 
see, the various parameters can be edited within each type. Therefore, one wall cabinet 
Family can represent 100 different sizes. 
Some of the information in the table above has a direct impact on the 3D geometry; the 
Width, Depth and Height parameters can be associated with dimensions in the Famify. When 
the parameter is changed the size of the Famify actually changes. So one only has to change 
the Famify type in a Projett Emironment to change the size of the placed Famify. And, of course, 
some of the information has no effect on the 3D geometry. Rather it is used to track design 
decisions and for scheduling purposes. Shared parameters can show up in schedules.

There are always exceptions to the rule, but generally speaking, anytime the geometry 
changes you need to create a new Fami!J. For instance, one Family can represent all the wall 
cabinets with a single door. But when the cabinet width dictates two doors a new Fami!J is 
required. This change in geometry cannot easily be managed within a single Fami!J. 
When the geometry changes a new Family is typically required. 
The example above has different handle, door and drawer locations. 
Fami!J Tjpes uithin the Prqjed Emironment. 
When utilizing content within the Prqjed Emironment the Fami!J and Tjpes are presented as 
shown in the image below (Figure 13-1.2). Notice Chair-Desk only has one Tjpe defined 
within that Fami!J whereas Cook Top-2 Unit has three. Within the project anyone on the 
design team can manually add or delete Tjpes associated with any Fami!J.

Introduction to Revit Content Creation 
T)pe Catalog. 
There is one last concept to point out about Fami!J T)pes before moving on. When a Fami!J is 
loaded into a project all of its Tjpes are automatically loaded. Sometimes this is good and 
other times it is not. The image on the previous page (Figure 13-1.2) shows manageable lists 
of Families. However, you can imagine how this list would get rather long if you loaded the 
wall cabinet Fami!J, described on the previous pages, that had 100 types. Not only would the 
list be long, but you are likely only using one depth and two heights. 
To better manage this situation Revit has a feature for Families called a T)pe Catalog. Rather 
than loading all of the Tjpes into the project with the Fami!J, the user is prompted to select 
the Tjpes desired. This process could be repeated until all of the T)pes are ultimately loaded 
for a specific Fami!J. 
The image below (Figure 13-1.3) shows the dialog box the user is presented with when 
loading the steel wide flange beam Fami!J.

The implementation and use of Tjpe Catalogs will be covered later in the book. 
The first Fami!J you create, in the next lesson, will not even have a T)pe as they are optional. 
13-7 

Architectural Commercial Design Using Autodesk Revit 2014 
Instance and Type Parameters: 
When creating Parameters for use in a Fami!J you need to decide if it is an Instance or a Tjpe 
parameter. Remember, parameters are placeholders for information in which some of them 
can be linked to geometry size and visibility. 
An Instance Parameter only impacts the one or more Families that are selected, or about to 
be created within the Prqjed Emironment, whereas the Type parameter affects all instances of 
the Fami!J within the project. 
A good example to describe how Instance/Type parameters are used in a project is to 
consider a window. Looking at the image below you can see this window Fami!J has been set 
up so that the width and height parameters are Type and the Sill Height is an Instance 
parameter. FYI: You onfy know this here ry the labels and arrows prorided in the image (Figure 13-1.4). 
This works with the standard industry convention where all windows that are the same size 
(i.e., width and height) are labeled with a common mark or tag. For example, the 2'x4' 
window below might be referred to as "Wl" in a project. Thus, if it was determined that all 
Wl window types need to increase in size to let in more natural light, changing one 
window's Tjpe Propettieswould change the size of all "Wl " windows in the project. On the 
other hand, the Sill Height dimension needs to be an Instance parameter. The "Wl " windows 
might be 2' -4" above the first floor and 2' -8" above the second.

13-8 
It is possible to edit a 
family and change a 
parameter from a T)pe to 
an Instance, with one 
exception; some 
parameters that are 
predefined in the template 
files are not editable. You 
cannot even change the 
name. 
Final thought: a table 
Fami!J might have its 
width and depth 
parameters set as T)pe or 
as Instam·e depending on 
how the design team 
wanted to use it in the 
project. 

Introduction to Revit Content Creation 
Family Templates: 
When starting a new Fami!J you need to know what it is and how it will be used in a project. 
With this information you can then select a Fami!J Template from which to begin the content 
creation process. 
Selecting the correct template saves time setting up the most basic parameters and in some 
cases is critical to the Fami!J working. For example, the door and the window templates have 
the following parameters setup: 
Door Template 
Window Template 
Parameter 
Value 
Parameter 
Value 
Width 
3' -0" 
Width 
3' -0" 
Height 
7' -0"

4' -0" 
Frame Width 
3" 
Sill Height 
3' -0" 
Model 
blank 
Model 
blank 
Manufacturer 
blank

blank 
Other templates, such as Generic Model, do not have a Width and Height parameter 
predefined. Additionally, the door and window templates are wall hosted whereas the Generic 
Model is not. 
Revit Architecture comes with over 70 template files. This book will only provide a 
discussion on a handful of them, but many are self-explanatory and it should be possible to 
discern what most of them are for after completing this book. 
Family Categories: 
Another item that needs to be covered at an 
overview level is the concept of a Fami!J Category. 
Each Retit Fami!J needs to be assigned to a specific 
category. This is done automatically by way of the 
template files for most Families. For example, 
starting a new Fami!J from the window template 
file, the category has been set to window as shown 
in Figure 13-1.5 shows. 
The category setting does two basic things: it 
controls which command is used to place the 
Fami!J and it relates directly to manipulating 
visibility within the project; turning off the window 
category for a specific view makes all the windows 
disappear in that view.

FIGURE 13-1.5 Family categories 

Architectural Commercial Design Using Autodesk Revit 2014 
Custom Family Libraries: 
Whether you are creating content for personal use or for a large 
firm, you should have a plan on how and where to store your 
custom content. There are probably an infinate number of 
solutions to this problem, but a relativly simple one will be 
suggested here. 
It is best to store your custom Revit content in a separate folder 
and not in the folders that contain the Revit OOTB content 
(OOTB = out of the box, meaning the content that comes with 
the software). It is best to segregate the content that has been 
created or edited to comply with your firms graphic or design 
standards. Additionally, each year, when a new version of Revit 
is released you wold need to sift through all the OOTB content 
folders to find your custom content. 
Revit has a specific set of folders created to house the OOTB 
content (see Figure 13-1.6). One suggestion is to create those 
same folders in a parallel folder and place your content there. 
Then, when content is needed, a user might first look through 
the OOTB location and then the firm location. At some point 
your custom content may be sufficient enough to reverse the 
order in which you look for content (i.e., Firm folder and then 
OOTB folder). 
Of course, in a firm setting, the content should be located on a 
server so everyone has access to the same content, and so it gets 
backed up! 
Naming Families: 
The name of the Famify file (.rfa files) on your hard drive, or 
server, is also the name the users see in Revit. The following 
information is offered as a suggestion, as there is no hard-fast 
rule on Famify naming. 
The Famify name should be concise and as short as possible, and 
is should not contain information that will appear in the Tjpe 
name, or visa versa. For example: 
Familv name 
0 
Tjpe name 
Metal Locker - Tall

FIGURE 13-1.6 
OOTB Family Folders 

Introduction to Revit Content Creation 
The Famify name should be as generic as possible so others on the design 
team, or in the finn, can quickly ascertain what the various Families are. If 
only one type of locker is used then the Famify name can be more generic. 
Similarly, the Tjpe name within the Famify should be easy to understand if 
possible; show the size of the locker rather than the model number. For 
example: 
Generic naming convention: 
Familv name 
0 
Metal Locker - Tall 
Detailed naming convention: 
Family name 
Arrow Locker - Tall 
Tjpe name 
18" X 18" 
Tjpe name 
ALT181860 
Locker family shown 
in perspective. 
Remember, a Famify often has several types defined within it. Thus, the example above 
would have several similarly named types which define several locker sizes. 
The detailed naming convention above would be appropriate if a design finn used several 
locker manufacturers depending on the project type; maybe they specialize in sports facilities 
and design various types of locker rooms. 
Another option, based on the example above, is to have a detailed Famify name and a generic 
Tjpe name: 
Familv name 
0 
Arrow Locker - Tall 
Tjpe name 
18" X 18" 
A good naming convention will help promote efficiency in the project environment. Many 
of the Families are added to the Revit model via the catch-all tool: Component: Place a 
Component (on the An-hitetture tab). When the Component tool is active, the Element Tjpe 
Seledor lists all the Families that are loaded into the project; that is, all the Families that do not 
have their own insertion tool, as windows and doors do. 
These Families are listed in alphabetical order in the Element Tjpe Seledor, within the project 
environment. Therefore, if the Families are not named properly, you might have a toilet at the 
bottom of the list, a Bathtub near the top and many other types of content sprinkled in 
between. 
One solution to this problem would be to implement some sort of abbreviation or prefix 
naming system.

Each Fami!J falls within a Fami!J Category as previously 
discussed. These categories are listed within the Prqjed 
BrOJvser, note the list varies depending on the content 
currently loaded into the project. Creating a two letter 
prefix would sort the content by category within the 
Element Tjpe Seledor. For example: 
CW 
= Casework 
FN 
= Furniture 
PF

SE

Utilizing a naming convention like this means a firm's name or initials cannot appear at 
the beginning of the name. 
Family and Type naming is highly subjective so one firm's solution may be completely 
different from another's. But, in any case, some sort of standard should be developed and 
agreed upon within each design firm.

Introduction to Revit Content Creation 
The emphasis will be placed on Revit features and techniques related to Families and not so 
much on geometry. A simple box will be created and then utilized to show many of the 
things that can be done with, and within, a Fami!J. So, to keep things simple early on, a basic 
box will be used. 
This exercise demonstrates how to start a Fami!J and develop a 3D box that can be adjusted 
in size; i.e., a parametric box. Note that more detailed steps and graphics will be provided 
the first time a subject is covered. The subsequent steps for the same subject will be less 
detailed and may not contain graphics. It is therefore beneficial to work though the lessons 
in order. 
Creating a New Family: 
1. Open Revit Architecture 2014. 
a. Revit, Revit Structure or Revit MEP may also be used. 
b. There is no difference to the user between 32bit and 64bit versions of the 
software. Therefore it does not matter which one is used with this book.

Assuming Revit was installed properly 
you should see a large list of files from 
which to choose. If not, you may 
download the Fami!J template files from 
Autodesk's website. 
The template names make it rather 
obvious as to what each template file is 
intended to be used for. When a

FIGURE 13-2.3 Initial view shown reference planes 
13-14 

Introduction to Revit Content Creation 
In the initial plan view, Figure 13-2.3, are two Rtftrence Planes; one horizontal and one vertical. 
These two Rtftrence Planes define the center of the content about to be created, in each 
direction. The intersection of the two also defines the origin. The origin is the insertion 
point, relative to your cursor, when placing the Fami!J in a project. Ultimately the box to be 
created needs to be centered on the intersection of the reference planes. 
The Rtftrence Planes do not appear in the Prqjed Emironment. However, Revit is aware of them 
and can use them when dimensioning and aligning to other elements; this depends on how a 
few properties for the Rtftrence Planes are set, but in any case the Rtftrence Planes are never 
visible. 
Creating the Framework for a New Family: 
A common method used when creating Revit content is to first add Rtftrence Planes, make 
them parametric and then create the 3D geometry and lock its edges to the Rtftrence Planes. 
This allows complex Families to be broken down into more manageable elements and makes 
controlling multiple 3D objects easier (i.e., moving one reference plane moves several 3D 
objects). 
In the next few steps you will create Rtftrence Planes that 
ultimately will control the size and location of a 3D box. 
4. Select Create -7 Datum -7 Reference Plane.

To add a Rtftrence Plane one simply picks two points in a view. A Rtftrence Plane is a 3D plane 
that will appear in all views which cut through it, on end (or perpendicular to), or are within 
the Select/Elevation/Plan "view range". The edges of the Rtftrence Planes are typically only 
visible unless "show" is toggled on under the Create tab on the Ribbon, and then, only the 
current Work Plane is shown. 
5. Add a horizontal Rtftrence Plane as shown in Figure 13-2.4. 
a. The exact location and length does not matter at this time, it will be adjusted 
later. 
b. Make sure the Rtftrence Plane is snapped to the horizontal plane before picking 
the second point. Watch for the cyan-colored dashed line and a tooltip which 
displays the word horizontal. 
FYI: The use of the word "horizontal" abot·e is in reforem-e to the cvmputer smen. 
The first Rtftrem·e Plane has now been added to the new Fami!J. Later in the book, a 
dimension will be added between the two parallel Rtftrem-e Planes shown in Figure 13-2.4. 
This dimension can be locked so it does not move, or made to be parametric in which case 
the end user in the project environment can edit a value in the properties of a selected 
element; causing the Rtftrem-e Plane to move accordingly.

The four Riferem-e Planes just drawn will ultimately serve as the guides for the edge of the 3D 
box. The top and bottom edges of the box will be controled by Riferem-e Planes not visible in 
the current view. 
Next, the newly added Riferem·e Planes position will be adjusted relative to the center or origin 
Riferem-e Planes that came with the template file. This can be done simply by selecting one 
Riferem-e Plane at a time and editing the on-screen temporary dimension which appears.

FIGURE 13-2.11 Sketch lines for 30 extrusion 
When creating a Solid Extrusion, a simple 2D outline is sketched as in Figure 13-2.11. This 
defines the perimeter of the extrusion. When "finish extrusion" is selected, the 2D outline is 
extruded perpendicular to the sketch lines to a thickness (or depth) specified on the Options 
Bar. 
The 2D sketch must be "clean"; meaning no gaps or overlaps occur at the comers. Because 
the rectangle option was selected the outline will automatically be "clean". 
18. Select the green check mark on the Ribbon. 
With the previous three simple steps a 3D box was created. This box will now serve as our 
"test subject" for an introduction on many of the basic options and settings that can be done 
with a Fami!J. 
13-22 

Introduction to Revit Content Creation 
The last step, in this exercise, is to align and lock the 3D geometry to the Riference Planes. 
Thus, whenever the Riference Planes move, so will the geometry. Revit provides a tool to easily 
do this; it is called Align. The tool brings two lines and/ or surfaces into alignment. Once the 
Align tool has been employed, the opportunity to "lock" the relationship is available. This 
lock creates a parametric relationship within the Fami!J. This is just one of the tools in which 
a Fami!J can be made parametric.

20. Select the vertical Riference Plane on the right (Figure 13-2.12). 
21 . Select the right-hand side of the box. 
The right side of the box should now be aligned with the Riference Plane (Figure 13-2.12). If 
the Riference Plane moved rather than the edge of the box, click Undo. When using the Align 
tool, the element that does not move is selected first. 
22. Click the Padlock icon that appears, to lock the relationship between the edge of the 
box and the Riference Plan. 
a. Figure 13-2.12 shows the icon in its initial position, unlocked. 
b. Clicking the "unlocked" icon will change it to a "locked" icon. 
c. When a Riference Plane is selected the "locked" icon will appear. 
1. This lets the users know a "lock" exists. 
11. Clicking the "locked" icon will unlock the relationship. 
d. Selecting the 3D box does not reveal the locked icon (except when in "edit

In the next step, the bottom of the box will be raised to make it easier to Align and Lock it to 
the bottom Rtftrence Plane. It is not required that this be done. However, it is easier to select 
things in the correct order and assure the desired things are selected; which can be 
challenging when several things overlap.

Now the Fami!J will be loaded into a project to show how that process works. Once in the 
project, the content does not have any direct connection to the external Fami!J created in this 
lesson.

a. Use the default template. 
34. Switch back to the Family Editor, by pressing Ctrl + Tab. 
a. Ctrl+ Tab cycles through open projects and views. 
Before loading the Fami!J into a project it should first be saved to a file. The main reason is 
to establish the Fami!J's name. The Fami!J's file name becomes the name of the content 
within a Revit project. 
13-27 

Architectural Commercial Design Using Autodesk Revit 2014 
35. Save the Fami!J to your hard drive as Box.rfa. 
a. The location where the file is saved does not matter, however it would be a 
good idea to create a folder in which all the files created in this text are stored. 
b. It is highly recommended that all data files be backed up regularly. If a Revit 
file becomes corrupt a backup may be the only solution; another option would 
be to send the file to Autodesk support and they may be able to salvage it. 
36. Click the Load into Project button on the Ribbon.

Introduction to Revit Content Creation 
In this exercise the steps required to make the box parametric will be covered. Parametric, in 
this case, means that certain parameters control the size of the box. Thus, in the project 
environment it is possible to select the box, go to its properties, edit a few parameters (e.g., 
width and height) and then the box will change size accordingly. This is a very powerful 
feature and can save time crating content, as a Famify is not required for every size. 
All parameters are either a Type parameter or an Instance parameter. An introduction to 
this concept was presented on page 13-8 of this chapter. This exercise will help to better 
explain the differences and how to implement them. 
1. Open the Box Famify created in the previous exercise. 
a. It is recommended that a copy of the "Box" Famify be saved for each exercise 
in case problems arise and an older file is needed to revert back to. Maybe copy 
the "Box" Famify file and rename it to Box 13-2 to save a copy of the Famify 
from the previous exercise. 
Adding Dimensions: 
The first step in making 3D geometry parametric is to add dimensions in a view. Two 
dimensions will be added in plan view, which will eventually be tied to parameters to control 
the width and depth of the 3D box. 
/ 
2. In the Rif. Let·el plan view, select Annotate 7 Dimension 7 Aligned. 
AJigned 
3. Click the vertical left and right Riferenr:e Planes, and then click a third point to position 
the dimension line (Figure 13-3.1). 
TIP: The third click needs to be in a blank area, as clicking on something will add another segment to the 
dimension string. 
TIP: Be careful to select the refirence plane and not the 3D box. 
4. Similar to the two previous steps, add another dimension for the other side of the 
box (Figure 13-3.2).

Introduction to Revit Content Creation 
Creating Parameters: 
Now that the dimensions are placed, they can be tied to parameters. The dimensions can be 
tied to previously created parameters or a new parameter can be created based on the 
selected dimension. The later will be employed, that is: selecting a dimension and then 
creating a parameter for it. 
Parameter Properties 
ጙ When defining a parameter, the user must 
,------------------, 
specify the following: 
Paramet:r Type 
@ Family parameter 
(Camot apj:ear in schedules or tags) 
6 Shared para11eter 
(Can be sha·ed by multiple projects and families, exported to ODBC, ard

Type of Parameter 
You will gain a better understanding of how these various settings work once you start using 
them, but the following descriptions are offered as a primer for what is about to be covered 
in the next few steps. 
Name: The Parameter Name should be descriptive. It can have spaces and symbols. However, 
dashes and other mathematical formula symbols should be avoided as they will confuse 
Revit when using them to do calculations. The name IS case sensitive. One common naming 
convention is to name all custom parameters with all uppercase letters to distinguish the 
Revit default parameters from the custom ones. The name can be changed at any time. 
Parameter Type: The Parameter Type concept takes a little time to fully understand. A simple 
explanation will be provided here so as not to get too bogged down in the details early on. 
Fami!J parameters: cannot appear in schedules (e.g., a door schedule or a furniture schedule) or 
be used in tags (e.g., a door tag or a furniture tag). Thus, if one were to create a Fami!J 
Parameter to keep track of the recycled content, that value (e.g., 80%) could not appear in a 
schedule, nor could it appear in a tag (e.g., a tag that listed the item number and directly 
below it the 80% value). This is the option that will be used initially in this book. 
Shared parameters: can be shared by multiple projects and families, and appear in schedules 
and tags. This method requires the use of an external text file to manage the parameters. 
13-3 1 

Architectural Commercial Design Using Autodesk Revit 2014 
Group parameter under: The Group parameter under 
setting simply specifies which section to place the 
parameter in when displayed in the properties dialogs 
in the project (see Figure 13-3.3). This setting can be 
changed at any time after the parameter has been 
created.

Type of Parameter: The Tjpe if Parameter is how Revit knows 
what type of information will be stored in a specific placeholder, 
or parameter. 
Looking at the images to the left, one can see the various 
disciplines and parameter types that can be used. 
Setting this properly has the following benefits: 
• 
Input z:alidation: when a Parameter is set to the type Integer, a 
user working with the family in a project cannot enter a 
decimal number. 
• 
Properfotmatting: 
o Common, Currency = 1.50 
o Electrical, Wattage = 60 W 
o Structural, Force = 2.45 kip 
FYI: Additional formatting can be done in the project tia Project 
Units and also within the schedulingfunctionalfy. 
This setting cannot be changed once the parameter has been 
created; it would have to be deleted and recreated. 
Revit MEP and Revit Structure both have additional parameter 
types. 
5. Select the horizontal dimension (see Figure 13-3.4). 
13-32 

Introduction to Revit Content Creation 
Notice one of the options, on the Option Bar, is Label; and it has a drop-down list next to it. 
This might better be titled "Parameter", because the drop-down list presents Parameters that 
can be tied into the selected dimension, and ultimately used to drive the dimensions from 
the Properties dialog from within a project. However, once a parameter has been tied into a 
dimension a LAbel does show up next to the dimension text as will be seen in a moment; so 
the LAbel title is not totally inappropriate. 
6. From the Label drop-down list, on the Options Bar, select <Add parameter> (see 
Figure 13-3.4).

FIGURE 13-3.4 Adding a parameter to a previously drawn dimension 
The information on creating parameters, covered on the previous two pages, can now be put 
to use. Notice, in Figure 13-3.5, that the Discipline and T)pe of Parameter have been 
automatically selected because there are no other options when tying a parameter into a 
dimension. Therefore, creating a parameter for a dimension using this method saves a little 
time.

FIGURE 13-3.6 Depth parameter added 
Looking at Figure 13-3.6, notice both dimensions 
have a LAbel associated with the dimension. This 
LAbel helps keep track of which dimensions are 
parametric. Another use for dimensions in a 
family is to "lock" it in order to maintain a 
relationship or spacing. 
Even though the Riference Planes show up in the 
elevation views (front, left, etc.), the dimensions 
do not. So it is not visually obvious in the Left 
view that the Depth parameter has been created. 
13-34 

Introduction to Revit Content Creation 
Next, an Instance Parameter will be created for the height of the box. Once the box family is 
loaded into a project, the height can vary from box to box (i.e., per instance). However, if 
the width (or depth) is changed, all boxes in the project will change. You will test this in a 
project momentarily. 
9. Switch to the Front view. 
Notice the Width dimension is not visible 
in this view. 
10. Add a dimension from the 
Riference Lezoel to the Riference Plane 
at the top of the box. 
11. Add a Height parameter to the 
dimension (see Figure 13-3.7 and 
13-3.8). 
a. Be sure to select the 
Instance option.

Flexing the Family: 
Now that parametric dimensions have been added to the Fami!J it is necessary to flex them 
and make sure they work as intended before loading into a project. 
12. Switch to the 3D view via the Qui,:k A.<m Too/bar. li1 
13. Click the Types tool on the Ribbon 
FYI: Notice the last three tools on the Ribbon are repeated for 
each tab; this is for cont"enience within the Fami!J Editor. 
The Fami!J Tjpes dialog is now open (Figure 13-3.9). Notice the three parameters created are 
showing up; and under the specified Dimensions heading. The easiest way to "flex" the Fami!J 
is to move this dialog off to one side, adjust the dimension(s) and then press App!J. When 
App!J is selected, the changes are applies to the Fami!J without the need to close the dialog 
box. 
Also, notice the Height parameter has "(default)" next to its name. This is because it is an 
Instance parameter. The Height can vary, but when the Family is initially placed, the 
"default" value will be used.

the dialog title bar; this will allow the changes to the box to be seen. 
16. Click Apply. 
TIP: Clicking Apply within a dialog box commits the changes to the modeL This allows the user to see if 
the modification looks correct before closing the dialog box and possibfy needing to reopen it. If the changes do 
not need to be tisualfy inspected first, the 0 K button can simpfy be selected - it is not necessary to click 
Apply first.

Architectural Commercial Design Using Autodesk Revit 2014 
The size of the box should now be modified as shown in Figure 13-3.11 below. When 
flexing the family, the size was changed by a large enough amount to make it unmistakable 
that a change occurred. Just changing the numbers by an inch or two might make it hard to 
notice the adjustment visually. 
FIGURE 13-3.11 30 Box - Modified 
Next the box will be loaded into 
the Project environment; there it 
will be shown how the family 
can be adjusted via the 
properties. 
Because the Width and Depth are 
Type Parameters, any change 
will affect all instances of the 
box. On the other hand, with 
the Height being an Instance 
Parameter - one change will 
only affect the selected objects. 
17. Open the Prqjed from the previous exercise: Box Project. Do not close the Box 
Fami!J. 
18. Press Ctrl + Tab until the Box Fami!J is current (Ctrl + Tab switches 
between the currently open views). 
19. Click the Load into Project button on the Ribbon. 
load into 
Project 
The Box Project is a Revit Prqjed that already contains a Fami!J named Box, which was 
loaded at the end of the previous exercise. When Revit notices that a Fami!J is being loaded 
with the same name as one previously loaded, it will present the user with the Family 
Already Loaded dialog, see Figure 13-3.12, which provides a few options in which to 
choose from. Revit will not assume that the file being loaded is a replacement for the 
previously loaded Fami!J. Rather, the user must decide by selecting one of two overwrite 
options or clicking Cancel to not load the Fami!J at all. It could be that a totally different box 
was created or downloaded and should not replace the currently loaded box, in this case you 
would click CamCil and rename the Fami!J so it does not conflict with the previously loaded 
one. 
Most of the time the first overwrite option should be selected, as the second may overwrite 
project specific changes to the Fami!J; such as the Cost parameter. 
20. Click Overwrite the existing version.

24. Close the dialog box by selecting Cancel 
Next, two additional boxes will be placed to show the different between Instam·e and Tjpe 
Parameters. This can be accomplished by clicking the Plat·e a Component button on the 
An-hitetture tab, as was done to place the first box, or by simply copying the existing box. 
25. Select the box, if not already selected, and then click Copy on the Ribbon. 
WARNING: Do not click the Copy command in the Clipboard panel, this is for copies between 
tiews or projects! Rather, use the Copy command on the Modify paneL 
26. Make two copies of the Box Famify, 6' -0" towards the right as shown in Figure 13-
3.15 below. 
FIGURE 13-3.15 Box family copied for Type versus Instant study 
27. Select the Box instance on the far left, and then view its Type Parameters; click Edit 
Type on the Properties Palette. 
28. Change the Width Parameter from 1'-0" to 4'-0". 
29. Click OK to close the Tjpe Parameter dialog. 
13-42 

Introduction to Revit Content Creation 
Because the Width Parameter is a T)pe Parameter, all instances of the type Box are updated 
instantly, see Figure 13-3.16 below. The Depth and Height for each remain unchanged. It 
makes no difference which box is selected anywhere in the Prqjed. If this box existed on 20 
different floors and in multiple phases, they would all have been updated. This is an 
important concept to understand because, just as it is easy to make several corrections or 
revisions with this technique, it is just as easy to make several errors in the design. 
If additional widths are needed, either an additional Tjpe would need to be added to the 
Fami!J or a totally new Fami!J would need to be created. FYI: If the geometry is the same, and just the 
dimensions need to change, one would rypical!J make a new Type, within an existing Family, rather than a new 
Family. 
FIGURE 13-3.16 Type parameter Width changed 
Next, the Instant Parameter Height will be studied. To see this change a vertical (i.e., elevation) 
or 3D view needs to be opened. 
30. Switch to the South exterior elevation via the Prqjed BrOJvser.

TIP: It is possible to change multiple instances at once if thry are all seleded prior to editing the Properties Palette 
dialog. Additional!J, if EVERY instance in the entire Projed needs to be modified, simp!J seled one and then right­
dick and pick the "Seled all instances " option. Caution should be used when employing the second tip as things change 
in ALL tiews and on ALL ler·els, and in ALL phases of the cumnt Pro jed, when the 'Đntire Projed" options is 
seleded. 
33. Save both the Prqjed and the Fami!J as they will be further developed in the next 
exerCise. 
Revit Model Content Style Guide 
Autodesk has recently released a document intended to help standardize how Revit content 
is made. This will help when sharing projects between offices and when downloading 
content from manufacturer's websites. Specifically, adding tags and scheduling will be greatly 
streamlined. This new document may be viewed and downloaded from the following 
location: 
http:// seek.autodesk.com/ manufacturer.htm 
Look for a link on the right-hand side called Retit Model Content Style Guide.

Introduction to Revit Content Creation 
The Box: Formulas and Materials 
The ability to add formulas and materials will be covered in this exercise. 
The ability to add formulas means that the Width Parameter could be "programmed" such 
that it is always half the size of the depth Parameter, this is the example that will be explored 
in this exercise. Additionally, one could control the spacing of shelving brackets based on the 
length of the shelf, or the size of a lintel based on the width of the window below it, the 
lintel would need to be in the window family in this case. As should be obvious, the 
possibilities are many. 
Defining materials in the Fami!J 
Editor means that the component is 
ready to be rendered the moment it is 
placed in the project. It may not 
always be possible to anticipate what 
the material should be, but it is often 
more convenient to have something 
selected rather than nothing, which 
renders a flat gray color. 
Cabinets with diferent materials applied (same Jami!J) 
Adding a formula: 
The following steps show how to add a formula to a parameter. 
1. Open the Box Fami!J created in the previous exercise. 
a. It is recommended that a copy of 
the Box Fami!J be saved for each

an older file is needed to revert 
back to. Maybe copy the Box

the previous exercise. 
2. Click the Types button on the Ribbon (see 
image to right).

Notice in the Fami!J Tjpes dialog below that a column named "Formula" exists. Whenez·er 
something is entered in this column the Value is grayed out for that Parameter (i.e., row); the 
result of the formula becomes the Value for that Parameter. A preliminary example is shown 
below.

FIGURE 13-4.1 Family Types dialog 
It is often helpful to open and explore the various Families that come with Revit; this can 
provide much insight on how to do certain things. The image below shows several formulas 
used to define a pipe elbow Fami!J that comes with Revit MEP. The values next to the 
formulas are the result of the adjacent formula; it is not possible to manually enter a value in 
this case, when a formula is present. Notice how other parameters can be used in formulas; 
this is case sensitive.

3. For the Width parameter, in the Formula column, enter the following: Depth/2 
(see Figure 13-4.3). 
4. Click into a different cell within the Fami!J Types dialog to see the Value update.

FIGURE 13-4.3 Adding formula to control the width 
TIP: When using parameters in a formula, keep the following in mind: 
• Parameters in formulas must match the case (i.e., uppercase, lowercase, mixed) of the Parameters being 
referenced. Tjping "depth " rather than "Depth " in the example aboz·e would not work - Retit would show 
an error message. 
• A Parameter used in a formula must exist in the Fami!J before it can be used. 
• If a Parameter is deleted, a'!)' formulas that use that Parameter will also be deleted. Retit will present a 
warningfirst. 
• If a Parameter is renamed, Retit will automaticallY rename the Parameter in all formulas in which it is used. 
13-47 

Architectural Commercial Design Using Autodesk Revit 2014 
Below are a few of the basic symbols Revit can use in formulas. See Revit's Help System for a 
full list: 
• 
Addition: + 
• 
S ubtrattion: -
• 
Multiplit'tltion: * 
• 
Ditision: / 
• 
Tangent. Tan 
• 
Cosine: Cos 
• 
Sine: Sin 
Conditional Formatting 
It is also possible to use conditional statements in a 
formula such as IF, AND, OR, <, >, = 
Here are a few examples: 
• 
if(Depth > 3', 2', 1') 
• 
if(and(Depth > 3', Height = 1'), 2', 1') 
• 
See Revit's Help for more info. 
Next the Fami[ywill be loaded into the Projed Emironmentto see the formula in action. 
5. Open the project file Box Project, and then switch to the 3D view. 
6. Press Ctrl + Tab until the Box Family file is current. 
7. Click the Load into Project button on the Ribbon. 
Notice the size of the box changes. When the Depth is now changed, the Width will 
automatically be updated. This will be tested next. 
8. Select one of the boxes and, via its Tjpe Properties, change the Depth to 6' -0" and 
then. 
a. Click in an adjacent cell. 
b. Notice the Width instantly updates. 
9. Click OK to close the dialog and accept the changes. 
All three boxes change size; 6' -0" depth and 3' -0" width. The height is still an Instam·e 
Parameter so it remained unchanged. 
10. Switch back to the box family. 
Next, a brief look at a few variations.

Introduction to Revit Content Creation 
The following revisions will not be saved; the Cancel button will be selected to discard the 
next two steps. 
11. Change the formula for Width to simply read Depth (see Figure 13-4.4). 
Family Type::; 
Name:. 
FIGURE 13-4.4 Modifying formula to control the width 
Thus, it is possible to have one Parameter simply equal another one. 
12. Click Cancel to discard the formula change. 
Another way to achieve the results shown in the previous image and steps is to have one 
Parameter control two dimensions. This would reduce the number of Parameters from three to 
two as the Fami!J currently stands. The image on the next page (see Figure 13-4.5) shows an 
example of this. Simply select a previously drawn dimension and then select the desired 
Parameter from the Label drop-down list on the Options Bar. This is only visible when a 
dimension is selected. 
One Parameter could control several dimensions. A Parameter has to be of type Length (versus 
Text, Cumnry, Volume, Yes/No, Etc.) to work with a Dimension. The Label drop-down list will 
automatically filter the list. 
It is best if the dimensions reference the Referem·e Planes rather than the 3D geometry.

This concludes the brief introduction to adding formulas to a Fami!J. The remainder of this 
exercise will shift gears a bit and look at adding materials to the box family. 
Adding a Material: 
Adding a Material in the Fami!J can save time for the design teams using the content when it 
comes to creating renderings. 
13. Select the 3D extrusion that represents the box in the Fami!J Editor. 
14. View the Prope1ties Palette dialog box. 
Notice, in Figure 13-4.6, that the Material is set to By Category. This will be changed to 
something specific to this Fami!J.

A new "Model" Suiface Pattern will be created. A "Model" pattern will not change scale with 
the VieJv Scale in the Prqjed Emironment, this is meant for real-world items like siding, title, 
CMU, etc. as seen in elevation. Conversely, the "Drafting" patterns do change scale with the 
VieJv Scale and is meant for representative patterns typically used in sections to imply a 
certain material.

Changing the Material in the Project Environment: 
So far, the Material for the Box has been "hard wired" within the Fami!J and cannot be 
changed once in the Prqjed Emironment. In this last set of steps, the techniques required to 
achieve this goal will be covered. 
Just to make things more clear: it is 
possible to create several 2D shapes in 
a single Fami!J. For example, a door 
has a solid for the frame, the door 
panel and a vision panel; see the image 
to the right (Figure 13-4.15). 
Therefore, it would not make sense 
for Revit to provide one built-in 
parameter that controls the Material 
for everything in the Fami!J.

In the door example, a parameter is created for each Material needed in the Fami!J. Next, 
each solid in the Fami!J is mapped to one of the three Parameters. It is possible for one 
Parameter to control the Material of several 3D elements; e.g., a "glass material" Parameter 
controls the Material for all seven pieces of glass in Figure 13-4.15.

Introduction to Revit Content Creation 
This exercise will study Fami!J T)pes. A Tjpe is simply the ability to save various parameter 
settings in a Fami!J so they do not need to be entered manually within each Project. 
Thus far, in this chapter, a Fami!J with just a single Tjpe has been created. Any new Fami!J 
automatically has one T)pe if none are specifically created; the Tjpe name is the same as the 
Fami!J name once loaded into the Prqjed Emironment. This exercise will look at how to create 
several predefined Tjpeswithin the Fami!J Editorand how to create additional T)pes on the fly 
within the Prqjed Emironment. 
Why use Types? Let us say a "Box" manufacturer offers several standard sizes. When 
creating the Fami!J for the "Box", it would be most expedient to create a Tjpe for each 
standard option. This would save the end-user(s) time in more ways than one. If a design 
firm had trusted custom Revit content, an end-user could load the "Box" Fami!J and pick a 
size from the predefined Tjpes; knowing that they are real options. Maybe some rarely used 
or over priced options are intentionally omitted. However, just not having to enter the data 
manually can be a great benefit. 
The reader may wish to tum back to the first exercise in this chapter and review the 
information initially presented on this topic, see page 13-5. 
Finally, the use of Categories will be studied. Revit uses Categories to control visibility and to 
determine which command will be used to place a Fami!J (e.g., Door tool, Window tool, 
Mechanical Equipment tool, Component tool). 
1. Open the Fami!J named Box. 
Notice, in Figure 13-5.1, that 
the Name drop-down at the top 
is blank. Clicking the NeJv 
button on the right allows one 
or more named Tjpes to be 
created. 
Once T)pes exist, all the 
Parameter Values below relate 
specifically to the selected 
named T)pe.

Next, four Tjpes will be created in the Box Fami!J. Each Tjpe will have a different Depth 
assigned to it. 
3. In the Fami!J Types dialog, click the New . . .  button.

FIGURE 13-5.2 Naming the family type 
Tjpe names should be descriptive and not duplicate any part of the Fami!J name (i.e., the 
name of the file on the hard drive). In this example the exact size will be used as the Tjpe 
name. In other cases it might be more useful to list the model number or some other 
descriptive wording. 
5. Click OK 
Now, one Tjpe exists in the 
Name drop-down list. Note 
that the Tjpe name matches 
the values below, this was 
intentional. However, it 
should be stated that the

the Parameter values; i.e., the

the person creating the Fami!J needs to does some QA (quality assurance) checking. This will 
be made clear in the next few steps.

The Box Fami!J now has 
two Tjpes created; each 
can be easily selected 
within the Prqjed 
Emironment. 
Revit is now managing 
two complete lists of 
Parameters; one for each 
Tjpe. As will be proven 
momentarily, the Values 
(i.e., Width and Depth) 
can vary from one list to 
the other. 
As seen in Figure 13-5.4, 
the new Tjpe did not 
change the Parameter 
Values below. Next this 
will be changed.

FIGURE 13-5.6 Tjpe Selector in the project environment 
Looking at Figure 13-5.6, notice all the Tjpes created in the Fami!J Editor are now available 
under the Fami!J name Box. A Tjpe named Box is also listed because the Fami!J was 
previously loaded without any specific Tjpes created; and as mentioned previously, when no 
Types exist Revit will create one with the same name as the Fami!J. This can be deleted for 
renamed in the Projed BrOJJJSer, within the Families section.

Introduction to Revit Content Creation 
Selecting a Category 
Selecting a Category is actually one of the first things typically done when starting a new 
Fami!J. However, this change was left until now to make it perfectly clear what this setting 
does. 
NOTE: Some Family templates will alrea4J har·e the comet Category selected (e.g., door, window, casework 
templates). Hower·er, the Box Famify was started with the Generic Model template, so the Category needs to be 
set manualfy; as this template can be used for many things. 
16. Open the Box Fami!J (if not already open). 
17. On the Create tab, click Category and Parameters. 
This list represents all the Categories 
used by Revit to control visibility 
and determine which tool inserts 
any given Fami!J. Categories are also 
used by Filters and for scheduling. 
This list is "hard wired" and cannot 
be modified in any way. 
This list is for Revit Architecture; 
the initial list is different for each 
flavor of Revit. However, clicking 
the "Show categories from all 
disciplines" option will show the 
same list in all three flavors of 
Revit. 
At this point we will pretend that 
our Box Fami!J is Furniture. Once 
set to be "furniture", the Box will 
show up in the Furniture schedule(s) 
and be visible (or not visible) based 
on the visibility and filter settings 
for any given view.

The Furniture a1tegory is generalfy for freestanding items that are not fastened to the building. Examples might be 
chairs, tables, desks, beds, ek. 
13-63 

Architectural Commercial Design Using Autodesk Revit 2014 
The Furniture Systems category is for modular desks, often called cubicles. These can be fastened to the wall 
and/ or hat·e power and data hardwired to them. Thus thry are diferent enough from regular furniture to warrant a 
separate section. 
19. Save the Box Famify. 
Next the modified Famifywill be loaded into the project and tested. 
20. Load the Famify into the Box Project file per steps previously covered. 
21. In the Box Project, switch to the default 3D view. 
The next few steps will show how the visibility of the furniture category now affects the Box 
family. 
22. Type VV to control visibility settings for the current view. 
23. Uncheck Furniture on the Model Categories tab (Figure 13-5.8). 
Notice there is a category for "Generic Models" as well. This would have allowed control of 
the Box Famify previously. However, this category should be used sparingly due to its 
ambiguity. 
24. Click OK 
The three boxes should have been hidden from the 3D view. They should still be visible in 
other views as long as the view's Visibility Graphii's Omride dialog did not have the Furniture 
Category turned off. 
25. Per the previous steps, tum the Furniture Category back on in the 3D tiew.

Revit does not have a specific Furniture tool on the Ribbon so new instances of the Box 
Fami!J would still be placed using the Component tool. 
Care should be taken to select the correct Category for Revit Families. If someone is in a hurry 
they may hastily select a wrong Category which could have a huge negative impact on a 
project in terms of budget and completion time. 
For example, a "smart board" for a classroom 
might be placed on the Furniture Category when it 
should have been placed on Eledrical Equipment. 
Near the end of the project the design team 
decides to turn off all the Furniture for the 
construction documents set, as it was laid out for 
design only and is not part of the bid set. Now, 
the final set is missing all of the "smart boards" 
in the floor plans, ceiling plans and interior 
elevations. 
Much more could be said and taught about 
Fami!J creation but is beyond the introductory 
scope of this text.

Appendix A 
Autodesk® Revit® Architecture Certification Exam: 
This appendix will cover the certification exam that is offered by Autodesk to help users 
prove their level of knowledge. This can be helpful when seeking an increase in salary from 
your current employer or to be listed on your resume. 
Introduction and Overview 
In the competitive world in which we live it is important to stand out to potential employers 
and prove your capabilities. One way to do this is by passing one of the Autodesk 
Certification Exams. A candidate who passes an exam has credentials from the makers of the 
software that you know how to use their software. This can help employers narrow down 
the list of potential interviewees when looking for candidates. 
When the exam is successfully passed a certificate signed by the CEO of Autodesk, Carl 
Bass, can be printed out and displayed at your desk or included with your resume; see 
example below. You also have access to an Autodesk logo for use on business cards or on 
flyers promoting your work; two examples are shown below as well. This author uses the 
professional logo in the front of books and in presentations.

Autodesk offers two exams for Autodesk Revit Architecture; Certified User and Certified 
Professional 
• 
Certified User. This is an entry level exam to verify you have a basic understanding of 
the Revit user interface and functionality. The exam consists of 30 questions, many 
of which are multiple choice and some are matching or point and click (hotspot). 
The test is taken on a computer at any Autodesk Certification Center. The test must 
be completed in less than 60 minutes. 
• 
Certified Professional: This is an intermediate level exam to prove you have a firm 
understanding of Revit Architecture's features. Before taking this exam, the Certified 
User exam must have been taken and successfully passed. Not only is this exam 
computer based, but it is also a hands-on Revit test. That is, you actually use the 
Revit Architecture software. There are 35 questions which have to be answered in 
120 minutes. 
Before taking the Certified User exam, you can prepare by working through this textbook and 
taking the assessment test online from home, work or school. The practice exam costs $48 
and will give you an idea about how you will do on the exam. 
Autodesk recommends how much time you should study and practice before taking each 
exam, the following highlights their recommendations: 
• 
Certified User Exam: 50 hours of hands on experience. Much of this requirement can 
be achieved by working through this book. 
• 
Professional Exam: 400 hours of hands on experience. 
FYI: This textbook mt!JI not cot·er et·ery Retit concept or fiature that could be asked on the exam. See the exam 
objectit·es on Auto desk s website. 
Be sure to manage your time while taking the test. Quickly go through the test and answer 
the questions that are easy to you, skipping the ones you are not immediately sure of. The 
exam software allows you to view a list of questions you have not answered or have marked. 
Once you have answered all the easy questions you can, then go back and think through 
those which remain. Do not exit the exam until you are completely finished, as you will not 
be able to re-enter the exam after that point. 
Once the exam is finished you will immediately see your score. If you failed, you should note 
the objective areas where you missed questions and study those areas more before taking the 
test again. Be sure to print your score report and take it with you to study.

Autodesk Certification Exam 
This section is provided to help you test your Revit knowledge before paying to take the 
associates assessment test or the certification exam. The answers to the questions will be on 
the last page. Keep in mind these questions are meant to aid in preparing to take the 
associates exam and not the professional exam, as the latter is a hands-on software exam. 
The questions are made up by the author and should not be memorized, thinking the same 
questions might be asked on the exam. These questions are similar in that they relate to the 
exam objectives listed on the previous page and are in the format described on the Autodesk 
website; multiple choice. You are provided 30 questions, equal to the actual exam. It is 
recommended that you time yourself so that you only have one hour. 
It is recommended that you wait to take this sample test until you have completed all the 
tutorials in this book and on the CD.

Architectural Commercial Design Using Autodesk Revit 2014 
Appendix V 
Introduction to Autodesk V asari: 
This appendix will take a look at Autodesk® Vasari®, a new derivative of Autodesk® Revit® which is 
in a public beta cycle at the time this book was published (Spring 2013). Autodesk® Vasari® is a 
conceptual design and analysis application, built on the Revit platform, which can be used for 
complex organic modeling, preliminary energy modeling, and micro-climate site studies. 
V asari started in Autodesk Labs, which is a division of Autodesk. They develop new technologies 
and allow the general public to freely test them. Some of these technologies are eventually 
incorporated into other programs such as AutoCAD or Revit. Other developments are stuck back on 
the shelf because the concept did not gain any traction. 
Hopefully this brief introduction will spark your interest and you will research this tool in more 
depth on your own! 
Accessing the Application 
The software can be downloaded by anyone at http:/ I autodeskvasari.com. You will be required to 
provide your name and a few other details before downloading the program. Once downloaded, the 
software will work for a fixed amount of time and then becomes non-functional. This "time-bomb" 
protects Autodesk's investment should they decide to begin selling the program. It also forces users 
to upgrade to the latest version and thereby continue to help through testing the latest version of the 
software. 
The entire program exists in a single EXE ftle which can be placed on your desktop for easy access. 
There is no software to install; you just run the EXE file. Once the application is started, you 
immediately see a resemblance to the Revit User Interface, Figure V-1 .1. In the lower right comer you 
can see a separate Video Skills Learning panel. This can be closed and accessed again later via the Help 
menu. You are encouraged to watch these videos to learn more about Vasari. 
As you explore the Vasari User Interface, you will quickly notice many of the general Revit tools have 
been removed. Vasari is in no way intended to replace Revit, but many of these features may end up 
in a future version of Revit or a compatible related application. Right now, Vasari can open Revit 
files and vice versa. So you can get Revit walls, doors, windows, etc. in V asari by opening a Revit 
model, but you cannot create them directly in Vasari. 
The application is named after Giorgio Vasari (1511 - 1574), an Italian painter, writer, historian, and 
architect.

To investigate some of the features of Vasari, you will open a Revit sample file found on the CD 
(Figure V-1 .2). This model has sun shades at the windows and PV panels on the roof.

You should now be viewing a 3D view similar to Figure V-1.2. Notice the Project Browser and Properties 
Palette are exactly like they are in Revit. 
Project Location 
The first thing you need to do before any analysis can be performed is specify where the project is on 
Earth. This includes location, true north angle and month and day. This information must be known 
for valid solar, wind and energy modeling studies. You learned how to set some of these options in 
the rendering chapter. You will set these values next. 
4. On the Anafyze tab, select Location (Figure 
V-1.3). 
You must be signed in to Autodesk 360 to use the 
various Autodesk Cloud Seniw associated with Vasari. 
A Cloud Senic-e is where the primary computing for 
something is accomplished online rather than on your 
computer. This allows extremely large computer 
server farms to process the information in a fraction 
of the time.

You should now see the dialog shown in Figure V-
1 .5. Notice all the nearby weather stations are listed 
and identified on the map. 
The closest weather station is selected by default 
and it is typically the best one to use. Sometimes it 
is more appropriate to select a weather station 
farther away. For example, there might be a large 
elevation difference or a large body of water with 
buoy-based weather stations.

Once the location is set, the ViewCube shows the specified location below it 
as seen in the image to the right. 
Next you want to make sure that True North has been properly defined. 
Sometimes Plan North, or Projec"t North, is the same; however, most of the 
time this is not the case. The model is always drawn relative to the computer 
screen (Plan North) . But the actual position on a site relative to True North 
being straight up typically needs to be adjusted.

Before you can adjust True North you need to be in a plan view. It is best to duplicate the Site Plan 
view for this step. 
8. Right-click on the Site Plan view in the Prqjed Browser. 
9. Select Duplicate View -7 Duplicate. 
10. Rename the new view: Site Plan - True North. 
V-4 

1 1 .  With the new Site Plan view active, and nothing in the 
view selected, set the following in the Project Browser. 
a. 
Orientation: True North (Figure V-1 .6). 
Nothing should have changed as True North and Project North are 
the same. You will change this now. 
12. On the Ribbon select Analysis -7 Position -7 Rotate 
True North. 
13. Click the two points shown in Figure V-1.7. 
a. 
The first point is straight up and vertical from the 
default rotation point. 
b. The second point is 45 degrees off of the first 
point. 
The site plan should now be rotated as shown in Figure V1-8. 
This angle would match the civil engineer's site plan orientation. 
The best part about this is that the rest of the Revit project has 
not changed.

14. Switch to the Site Plan view (not the True North version, but the original view). 
Notice that Project North has not changed. The floor plan still aligns with the computer screen making 
it easier to select and edit the model. 
With the position and True North set, you are ready to try a few of the analysis tools in Vasari. 
Ecotect Wind 
Autodesk makes another separate analysis application called Autodesk Ecotect. This program is 
more advanced but is not based on the Revit platform. Thus, it is more difficult for Revit users to 
model in, or get their Revit model into this program. To help with this hurdle, Autodesk has ported a 
few features into Vasari. That is the case for the first feature we will be looking at: the Ecotect Wind 
Rose. 
The Wind Rose tool allows you to consider the speed and direction of prevailing 
winds at different times of year based on the site location and orientation you chose. 
15. Switch to the default Perspective view. 
16. Select the Ecotect Wind Rose tool from the Ribbon. 
V-6 

You should see the Ecotect Wind Rose 
dialog as shown in Figure V-1.9. There are 
two main things you should notice here. 
First, at the bottom of the screen you can 
adjust the wind rose graphic to only 
consider a specific time of year and/ or 
time of day. This is useful if you are 
designing a baseball field and want to 
exclude the off-season times of year. 
The second point of interest is the ability 
to push this wind rose graphic back into 
your V asari model. You will do that next. 
17. Click the Send Wind Rose to 
BIM project button - which is 
pointed out in Figure V-1 .9. 
18. Select the Inner Radius Around 
Model option (Figure V-1.10). 
19. Change the VisualS tyle to 
Consistent Colors in order to 
visualize the Wind Rose better. 
Your perspective view should now look 
similar to Figure V-1 .11. This is a great 
image to print out and study how the 
building will be impacted by prevailing 
winds. This might cause you to rotate the 
building, change the location of an 
employee patio, or add a row of trees. 
Of course, it is important to study this 
early in the design process so the design 
can still be easily changed. 
This view can be shared with the client as 
well. 
The Wind Rose graphic is in the Mass 
category. To turn off the visibility of the 
Wind Rose you need to select Show Mass 
by View on the Anafyze tab. You can also 
select the Window Rose, right-click and 
select Hide Element in View. 
If you switch to any other view you will 
notice the Wind Rose appears as it is 
considered a 3D element.

Ecotect Wind Tunnel 
This tool allows the designer to actually see the wind engage the proposed building design. Adding 
adjacent buildings and trees will give a more accurate picture. On the screen you will actually see 
animated colors representing wind at various speeds. This is not easily depicted in a book, so you will 
have to try it to see the full effect. 
20. Select the Wind Rose and delete it. 
FYI: If you don't delete it, the extents will be larger than they need to be for the wind tunnel stut!J.

Similar to the Wind Rose tool, a separate application opens to show the Wind Tunnel analysis. The next 
three figures (12, 13 and 14) show snapshots in time from the animation. Notice how the trees and 
the main entry way are affected by the wind patterns. 
22. If needed, use the icons across the top to zoom in and view the model better. 
23. Try adjusting the Position slider to change the height at which the wind is calculated within 
the model.

Ecotect Solar Radiation 
The last two features you will look at only work with Mass elements rather than Revit walls, doors 
and windows. Masses are created in Revit or from the Model tab in Vasari. To save time, you will open 
another file which has nothing but a Mass element in it. However, creating a Mass is very easy. The 
following lists a basic overview on how to create a simple Mass: 
• 
Select Model -7 Create Mass. 
• 
Select one of the Draw tools (i.e., Line, Rectangle, Arc, etc.) . 
• 
Create a closed footprint. 
• 
Select the lines just drawn and then drag the up arrow to 
extrude a solid (see image to the right) . 
• 
Click the Finish Mass button when done 
These are the most basic steps for creating Mass elements. Vasari can do so much more! 
Unfortunately, there is not enough room in this introductory appendix to cover more. 
24. Open the Revit sample file named Office Building Mass Study.RVT from the CD. 
You should see the massing model shown in Figure V-1.15. This model is based on the author's 
Commenial Design Using Autodesk Retit textbook.

The Locf1tion has already been set. First you will try 
the solar radiation at the current True North and 
then rotate the model to see how the analysis 
changes. 
25. Switch to the Default 3D View via the 
Quic-k Aa-ess Toolbar (Figure V-1.16) .

True North 45 degrees per the steps covered at the 
beginning of this appendix. 
31 . Run the Solar Anafysis tool again.

Introduction to Autodesk V asari 
Energy Analysis 
The last feature you will look at is preliminary energy modeling based on overall volume and selected 
construction systems. Vasari offers lists from which to choose the major building elements to be 
used; such as walls, doors, windows, glass type, HV AC systems, and more. This is selected from 
standard lists because the building has not even been modeled yet. We are still just looking at massing 
elements. If we find the shape or orientation of the building needs to change, it is easier to do it now 
when we are just dealing with a Mass rather than later when there are potentially thousands of 
elements in the Revit model. Remember, Vasari is for preliminary design and Revit is for the design 
development and construction document phases. 
We will take a quick look at the options for systems, but 
ultimately will just be accepting the defaults. 
32. Click the Energy Settings tool on the Ribbon. 
You now see the Energy Settings dialog.

Click on one of the constructions and then click the down-arrow which appears. This will reveal the 
various options within that category. Take a few minutes to explore all the options in each of these 
dialogs. Do not make any changes at this time. 
FYI: The Mass needs to have Mass Floors assigned to it for all this to work properjy. 
34. Click OK to close the open dialog boxes. 
35. Click the Enable Energy Model tool on the Anafyze tab.

Architectural Commercial Design Using Autodesk Revit 2014 
Your model should now look similar to Figure V-1 .21 . Vasari automatically added windows, or Mass 
Glazing, which fill 40% of the exterior walls, and zones for the HV AC system. The windows may 
not match the intended design but for a preliminary analysis this is typically fine as long as the overall 
percentage is close. It is possible to model your own Mass Glazing if you want to be more specific. 
v 
FIGURE V-1.21 Energy settings dialog and Conceptual constructions dialog 
Your model is now ready to calculate its energy 
consumption. 
36. Click the Analyze Mass Model button. 
37. Accept the suggested analysis name by clicking 
Continue (see image at right) . 
Your model is now being sent to the Cloud for analysis via 
the Autodesk's Green Building Studio engine. This type of

analysis can be calculated in a fraction of the time in the Cloud versus on your computer. 
38. When finished, click the Results & Compare button on the Ribbon. 
When finished you will see the dialog shown in Figure V-1 .22, which lists the annual and life cycle 
costs for the building. This is all based on the building construction, location, True North, and local 
utility rates! You can try changing the shape and/ or site orientation and then compare the results 
side-by-side in this dialog.

Arch itectural Commercial Design Usi ng 
Autodesk® Revit® 201 4 
• Starts at an introductory level 
• Project based tutorials design an office building from start to finish 
• Video instruction is included with each book 
• Bonus material covers an introduction to Autodesk Vasari, finding missing elements and more 
Description 
Architectural Commercial Design Using Autodesk Revit 201 4 is designed 
for the architectural student using Autodesk Revit 201 4. The intent 
is to provide the student with a well-rounded knowledge of tools and 
techniques for use in both school and i ndustry. This text takes a project 
based approach to learning Revit's Architectural tools i n  which the student 
develops a three story office building. Each book comes with a CD 
contai ning numerous video presentations of the written material. General 
building codes and industry standard conventions are covered in a way 
that is applicable to the current exercise . 
The first two chapters are intended to get the reader fami liar with the user 
interface and many of the common men us and tools of Autodesk Revit 
201 4. A small office is created in chapter two to show just how easy it is 
to get started usi ng Autodesk Revit. By the end of chapter two the student 
will be excited and prepared to take on a much larger project. 
Throug hout the rest of the book the student develops a three story office 
building. The drawings start with the floor plans and develop all the way to 
photo-realistic renderings like the one on the cover of this book. I n  these 
chapters the many architectural tools and features of Autodesk Revit 201 4 
are covered in greater detail.
