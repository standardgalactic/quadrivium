keeping the American dream of homeownership alive and thriving.
Authors’ Acknowledgements
Thanks to acquisitions editor Lindsay Lefevere, who chose us to 
author this book and guided us through the tough part of getting 
started; and to our agent, Neil Salkind (www.studiob.com/
salkindagency), who ironed out all the preliminary details to 
make this book possible.
A special thanks to Barbara Jacobs, owner and manager of B&S 
Consulting Group LLC in Southfield, Michigan, who shared her 
extensive knowledge and experience through several of the case 
studies presented in this book. The knowledge and skills she 
acquired while working as a senior credit analyst, in loss mitigation, 
and in special investigations for companies like Fannie Mae, 
Lehman Bros., and Aurora Loan Services are now put to work 
educating and helping homeowners (with a special focus on 
seniors) discover their modification options and interpret their 
mortgage loans.
Sarah Faulkner, our project editor, deserves a loud cheer for acting 
as a very patient collaborator and gifted editor — shuffling chapters 
back and forth, shepherding the text and graphics through production, 
making sure any technical issues were properly resolved, and 
serving as the unofficial quality control manager. Elizabeth Rea, our 
copy editor, earns an editor of the year award for ferreting out our 
typos, misspellings, grammatical errors, and other language faux 
pas, in addition to assisting Sarah as reader advocate — asking the 
questions we should have asked ourselves. We also tip our hats 
to the Composition crew for doing such an outstanding job of 
transforming a loose collection of text and illustrations into such 
an attractive bound book.
We owe special thanks to our technical editor, Craig D. Doyle, Esq., 
for flagging technical errors in the manuscript, helping guide its 
content, and offering his own insight and advice from the world of 
foreclosure self-defense and loan modification.

Introduction
T
he Titanic was unsinkable. That’s what the experts thought, at 
least. Likewise, most experts believed that property values in 
the United States would continue to rise for as far as their foresight 
could see. Unfortunately, the short-sighted experts were tragically 
wrong. The housing bubble burst, as all bubbles eventually do, 
leaving many homeowners stranded at sea and drowning in debt.
If you’re like most homeowners in default or facing foreclosure, 
you probably never imagined yourself in such a dire situation. 
Maybe your loan officer sold you a time-bomb loan, like a particu-
larly high-risk adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM), and convinced you 
that if the interest rate rose too high, you could always refinance 
and get a lower rate. Maybe you purchased your house thinking 
your job was secure . . . and then the economy tanked. Perhaps 
you’re one of the many people without medical insurance who got 
sick and was quickly buried under a mountain of medical bills.
Whatever hardship you’ve experienced, your American dream of 
homeownership turned into a nightmare. You now own a home 
you can’t afford. You’re way behind in your payments with little 
hope of catching up, or your monthly income is insufficient to 
cover the payments, or both. You probably can’t qualify for refi-
nancing. Due to falling property values or negative amortization 
(more about that later), you may even owe more on your home 
than you can sell it for. You want to do the right thing without 
filing for bankruptcy or simply jumping ship, but you really can’t 
afford your current mortgage. Now what?
Welcome to Loan Modification For Dummies — a guide that can help 
you transform your leaky ship into your own personal lifeboat.
About This Book
Foreclosure is a lose-lose-lose-lose option. It hurts everyone. 
Homeowners lose their homes. Lenders lose performing assets and 
the costs of foreclosure ($50,000 to $80,000 by some estimates). 
Neighbors see their property values drop up to nine percent per 
foreclosure. Neighborhoods become less stable and more vulnerable 
to crime. The economy suffers. And foreclosure wipes out the prop-
erty tax base, providing communities with less money for schools, 
police protection, fire departments, and other vital services.

On the other hand, an affordable loan modification is a win-win-
win-win alternative. It keeps homeowners in their homes and 
makes their mortgage payments more affordable. Lenders avoid 
the full expense of foreclosure and are able to transform a non-
performing asset into a performing asset. Neighborhoods remain 
stable. Property values stabilize. Homeowners have more money 
to pay bills and stimulate the economy, and tax revenues can begin 
to recover.
This book is designed to help you transform lose-lose-lose-lose 
situations into win-win-win-win situations through loan modifica-
tion. Here, you discover field-proven strategies and techniques 
for negotiating an affordable loan modification with your lender 
to keep your home, lower your monthly mortgage payment, and 
catch up on any past due payments. In addition, you discover 
plenty of advice for developing long-term solutions to keep you on 
the right track.
Conventions Used in This Book
We use several conventions in this book to call your attention to 
certain items. For example:
 
✓ Italics highlight new, somewhat technical terms, such as debt-
to-income (DTI) ratio, that we follow with straightforward, 
easy-to-understand explanations, of course.
 
✓ Boldface text indicates key words in bulleted and numbered 
lists.
 
✓ Monofont highlights Web and e-mail addresses. Note that 
some Web addresses may break across two lines of text. In 
such cases, no hyphens were inserted to indicate a break. So 
if you type exactly what you see — pretending that the line 
break doesn’t exist — you can get to your Web destination.
 
✓ Throughout the book, we refer to third-party professionals 
whom you may choose to hire to represent you as loan modifi-
cation experts rather than professionals or specialists because, 
during the writing of this book, nobody could really be certi-
fied or licensed in this field.
 
✓ You’ll almost always be going through your servicer (the 
company that collects and processes your monthly mortgage 
payment) to get a loan modification, but for the sake of con-
sistency and simplicity, we use the term lender whether refer-
ring to the servicer or the lender or investor from whom you 
borrowed the money.

In addition, even though a team of four authors wrote this book — 
Ralph, Lois, Paul, and Joe — the “we” are usually Ralph, Lois, and 
Paul talking. They’re the foreclosure self-defense and loan modi-
fication experts. Joe’s the wordsmith — the guy responsible for 
keeping you engaged and entertained and working with the editors 
to make sure we explain everything as clearly and thoroughly as 
possible.
What You’re Not to Read
You can safely skip anything you see in a gray shaded box. We 
stuck this material in a box (actually called a sidebar) for the same 
reason that most people stick stuff in boxes — to get it out of the 
way so no one trips over it. However, you may find the case studies 
and brief asides in the sidebars engaging, entertaining, and perhaps 
even mildly informative.
Foolish Assumptions
When explaining the loan modification process, we assumed noth-
ing. We’re committed to providing detailed advice so that you can 
navigate the process with confidence. However, we did make a few 
foolish assumptions — the same assumptions that your lender is 
going to make when reviewing your loan modification application.
 
✓ You have or soon will have sufficient income to cover a rea-
sonable, though lower, monthly payment. (If you have no 
job and no prospects of landing a job in the near future, loan 
modification is not an option.)
 
✓ You’re committed to doing what’s necessary to keep your 
home. (If you don’t care about losing the house, a different 
option may be more suitable. We offer several alternatives in 
Chapter 3.)
How This Book Is Organized
Although we encourage you to read this book from cover to cover 
to maximize the return on your investment, Loan Modification For 
Dummies presents the information in easily digestible chunks, so 
you can skip to the chapter or section that grabs your attention or 
meets your current needs, master it, and then skip to another sec-
tion or simply set the book aside for later reference.

Loan Modification For Dummies

To help you navigate, we took the 17 chapters and two appendixes 
that make up the book and divvied them up into six parts. This 
section provides a quick overview of what we cover in each part.
Part I: Getting Up to Speed 
on Loan Modification
When facing the real possibility of losing your home, shifting into 
panic mode is far too easy and destructive. In a state of panic, 
you’re vulnerable to making the wrong decisions, saying the wrong 
things, or falling victim to con artists who prey on people who 
aren’t thinking clearly.
In this part, we encourage you to slow down and take a deep 
breath as you venture into the territory of loan modifications. We 
introduce you to the loan modification concept, show you how to 
take stock of your situation (it may not be as bad as you think it 
is), reveal several options for avoiding foreclosure (after all, loan 
modification is just one of the options out there), and provide you 
with the information you need to decide whether you want to work 
with a loan modification specialist or go it alone.
Part II: Kick-Starting the Process: 
Applying for a Loan Modification
Obtaining a loan modification is like getting a job — you have to 
apply for it first, and if your application is lousy, you don’t even get 
an interview. In this part, we show you how to prepare an impec-
cable loan modification application that meets or, even better, 
exceeds your lender’s expectations and then submit it so it lands 
on the right person’s desk.
We show you how to contact your lender; gather the facts, figures, 
and documentation needed to prepare your application; figure out 
the types of modifications you want to request from your lender; 
prepare and submit your application; and follow up to ensure that 
your application doesn’t get lost in the shuffle.
Part III: Hammering Out the 
Details with Your Lender
After most lenders receive and approve a request for a loan modi-
fication, they pitch an offer. Many homeowners see this as the end 
of a long process, but it’s actually just the beginning of the end. 
You can now negotiate with the lender for a more attractive deal.

 Introduction

In this part, we show you how to explore different loan modifica-
tion adjustments with your lender, how to evaluate your lender’s 
initial offer and spot common red flags, and how to negotiate a 
better, more affordable loan modification.
Part IV: Dealing with an 
Uncooperative Lender
Lenders are beginning to “get it.” They’re beginning to grasp the 
magnitude of the problem they helped create and the magnitude of 
their potential losses if they choose not to modify troubled mort-
gages. However, every crisis has a few holdouts reluctant to make 
concessions.
If you lock horns with your lender, you may be able to apply some 
legal pressure to prod your lender into action. In this part, we 
reveal lending laws designed to protect consumers, show you how 
to audit your loan to uncover possible violations, and provide 
tips on how to use proof of violations to convince your lender to 
modify your mortgage loan.
Part V: The Part of Tens
Every For Dummies title comes with a Part of Tens, which contains 
chapters of ten strategies, tips, tricks, or other important items. 
In Loan Modification For Dummies, the Part of Tens offers ten tips 
for long-term success to help you avoid falling into the foreclosure 
trap again and ten common myths about loan modification that we 
bust wide open.
Part VI: Appendixes
As an added bonus, at no additional cost, we include two appen-
dixes which, by their very nature, appear at the end of this book.
 
✓ Appendix A: A list of resources including Web site and con-
tact information for the major lenders, a list of federal agen-
cies and consumer advocacy groups you can contact for 
assistance, and contact information for the attorney general 
in each of the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and various 
U.S. territories. (We’ve done our best to provide accurate 
and timely information, but if you find that a contact phone 
number or Web site address isn’t correct at the time you’re 
reading this book, use your favorite Internet search tool to 
search for key phrases included in our descriptions.)

✓ Appendix B: A glossary of typically unfamiliar terminology 
and acronyms you’re likely to hear bandied about, such as 
loan-to-value (LTV) ratio and deficiency judgment.
Icons Used in This Book
Throughout this book, you’ll spot icons in the margins that call 
your attention to different types of information. Here are the icons 
you’ll see and a brief description of each:

real-world experiences.
Where to Go from Here
Loan Modification For Dummies is sort of like an information kiosk. 
You can start with the chapters in Part I to master the basics and 
then skip to Part II to prepare and submit your loan modification 
application, or you can skip around to any chapters that interest 
you most.
To get a handle on your situation and determine just how bad it 
is, check out Chapter 2. To get up to speed on your foreclosure 
options, including loan modification, skip to Chapter 3. You can 
also skip the preliminaries by jumping straight to Chapter 5 and 
getting your loan modification application underway. If some arm-
chair expert on loan modification fed you some misinformation 
that’s making you question some aspect of it, skip to Chapter 17, 
where we take on the most common myths.
If you’re looking for information on a very specific topic, flip to the 
back of the book where you’ll find a comprehensive index.

f you’re in the market for a quick primer on loan modification, 
you’ve come to the right place. This chapter introduces the 
concept of loan modification, explains the various ways a lender 
can modify a mortgage loan, assists in determining whether you’re 
likely to qualify, and reveals what’s involved, so you know what to 
expect.
 
Loan modification isn’t the right foreclosure avoidance maneuver 
for everyone, so we list other common alternatives in this chapter 
and cover them in greater detail in Chapter 3. We encourage you to 
explore all your options before pursuing a loan modification.
Grasping the Loan Modification 
Concept
By definition, a loan modification is any change to the original 
agreement between borrower and lender. Assuming you qualify, 
a loan modification enables you to keep your home, lower your 
monthly mortgage payment, and catch up on any late or missed 
payments. In addition, your lender avoids the high cost of foreclo-
sure, transforms a nonperforming asset into a performing asset, 
and removes a bad loan from its books.

Part I: Getting Up to Speed on Loan Modification

Affordability is the key term in loan modification. If the loan modifi-
cation results in an affordable monthly payment for the home-
owner and is less costly for the lender than a foreclosure, it’s a 
win-win solution for both parties. In the following sections, we dis-
cuss the various ways a lender can modify a loan to affordability. 
For additional details, check out Chapter 7.
Reducing and fixing the interest rate
During the run-up to the mortgage meltdown, many homeowners 
were suckered into adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) with low 
teaser rates. When interest rates rose, so did the house payments; 
in some cases, they jumped 50 percent or more. As rates were 
rising, property values were dropping, so many of these home-
owners couldn’t qualify for refinancing to get them out of trouble.
As a result, lenders are often willing to lower the interest rate, 
either temporarily or permanently. Loan modification rate adjust-
ments are likely to come in one or more of the following forms:
 
✓ Reduced interest rate, sometimes below the going rate
 
✓ Converting an adjustable-rate mortgage into a fixed-rate loan
 
✓ Interest-only period to give borrowers time to recover their 
financial footing
 
✓ Step-rate adjustments, with a low rate for several months or 
years that increases gradually to avoid rate-adjustment shock
An interest rate reduction can result in considerable monthly 
savings. For example, dropping the rate from 7 to 5 percent on a 
$200,000 30-year amortized mortgage reduces the monthly pay-
ment from $1,330.60 to $1,073.64, a monthly savings of $256.96, or 
$92,505.60 over the life of the loan.
 
During the writing of this book, ARMs were going the way of the 
dinosaur as lenders tried to stabilize the market and avoid a future 
mortgage meltdown. This shift away from ARMs may prevent 
future problems, but if you’re stuck in an ARM now, you need to 
get out of it soon, and loan modification may help you do just that.
Extending the term
You probably have a 30-year mortgage with at least a few years or 
perhaps a decade or two of payments to look forward to. Although 
most homeowners want to pay off their mortgages as quickly as 
possible, stretching out the term (the number of years you have 

 Chapter 1: Keeping Your Home by Modifying Your Loan 11
to pay back the loan) can provide some relief for your monthly 
budget. Your lender may be willing to extend the term from what-
ever you have remaining on your mortgage to 30 or even 40 years.
Just because you have a 40-year mortgage doesn’t necessarily 
mean you’ll be making payments for 40 years. You can make addi-
tional payments to pay down the principal earlier. Extending the 
term gives you the flexibility to make larger payments voluntarily 
while obligating you to smaller monthly payments. This strategy 
can allow you to deal with fluctuations in your monthly income 
and expenses.
 
If your mortgage or loan modification agreement includes an early 
payment penalty clause, usually referred to as a prepayment pen-
alty, make sure the penalty is phased out over a relatively short 
period — three years max. You don’t want to get penalized for 
acting responsibly and trying to save some money.
Reducing the principal balance
If your lender can’t achieve affordability by adjusting your loan’s 
interest rate and term, it may agree to reduce the unpaid principal 
balance (the amount you owe on the loan) in one of these ways:
 
✓ By forgiving a portion of the debt: Under President Obama’s 
Making Home Affordable (MHA) plan, this has become a more 
viable option for lenders who can recover a portion of their 
losses from the U.S. Treasury.
 
✓ By deferring payment of a portion of the debt through 
principal forbearance: For example, if you owe $150,000 on 
a home that’s currently worth only $125,000, the lender may 
recalculate your payments using the $125,000 amount and 
let you pay the remaining $25,000 when you sell or refinance 
years later, hopefully after real estate values have recovered.
Dealing with delinquencies
When you miss a few house payments, your lender/servicer really 
starts to ladle it on with additional penalties and late-payment fees. 
Your lender has several options (all of which are usually negotia-
ble) for collecting on missed payments and any associated costs:
 
✓ Capitalizing delinquencies and other costs: Capitalization 
consists of rolling any penalties and fees into the balance so 
that you pay them off over the life of the loan. Unfortunately, 
you also end up paying interest on those penalties and fees.

Part I: Getting Up to Speed on Loan Modification  
12
 
✓ Waiving delinquencies and fees: Your lender can choose to 
forgive the penalties and fees and then either capitalize the 
delinquent payments or negotiate a payment plan.
 
✓ Negotiating payment plans: Your lender may agree to an 
installment plan that enables you to pay the delinquencies, 
penalties, and fees over several months rather than as a lump 
sum. You may end up paying extra in interest, but you get to 
keep your house and buy some time.
 
If your lender/servicer is participating in the government’s Making 
Home Affordable program, it’s required to waive any penalties and 
fees. If your lender isn’t a participant, push hard to have it waive 
any penalties and fees. Your lender shouldn’t earn even more 
money from your misfortune.
Re-amortizing the loan
Amortization is a way of calculating monthly loan payments that 
keeps the payment the same every month and accounts for the 
fact that each payment reduces the principal. The end result is 
that the borrower pays way more interest with early payments and 
way less with later payments.
An average, everyday loan modification
Sherry Smith had been working two jobs to make ends meet, but when retail sales 
dried up, so did her part-time job at one of the nation’s largest retail outlets. She 
could no longer afford the mortgage payment she’d been paying since June 2004 — 
$752.03 on a $96,467 30-year mortgage at 8.65 percent. Facing almost certain 
default, Sherry chose to do the right thing: She called her lender, described her 
situation, and requested a loan modification. The lender agreed and several weeks 
later offered to reduce her interest rate to 6.40 percent, lowering Sherry’s monthly 
payment to less than $600.
For most homeowners, this would have been the end of the story. Saving more than 
$150 per month would have been enough, but again, Sherry did the smart thing: She 
requested a better offer because the payment still wasn’t affordable for her. The 
lender took a second look at the numbers, dropped the interest rate to 5.60 percent, 
and extended the term, lowering Sherry’s monthly payment to $447.40. Now that 
was affordable!
Sherry is one of many homeowners who have negotiated affordable loan modifi-
cations with their lenders. With a little cooperation from your lender and perhaps 
some haggling at the negotiating table, you can keep your home, save hundreds of 
dollars per month, and save thousands over the life of your loan.

 Chapter 1: Keeping Your Home by Modifying Your Loan 13
When you receive a loan modification, the lender re-amortizes (recal-
culates) your monthly payment based on the other modifications — 
the interest rate reduction, term extension, any principal reduction, 
and the capitalization of missed payments and any penalties or fees.
 
One way a lender can modify your mortgage is to re-amortize the 
loan over a longer period of time but retain the maturity date. If 
you go with this option, watch out for the last payment you make! 
For example, if you took out a 30-year mortgage in the year 2000 
and paid 10 years on it, the lender could re-amortize over 30 years 
and still require you to repay the loan in 2030. In this example, 
you’d have lower monthly payments, but you’d also have a signifi-
cant lump sum (balloon) payment due in 2030.
Considering Other Foreclosure 
Alternatives
Facing foreclosure, homeowners often assume they have only 
two options — pay up or move out. The fact is they usually have 
several options, including one or all of the following:
 
✓ Forbearance: Delays any collection activities, including a 
foreclosure sale, so homeowners have time to explore their 
options or obtain gainful employment.
 
✓ Bankruptcy: Is often an ideal solution for homeowners drown-
ing in unsecured debt, such as credit card debt.
 
✓ Loan modification: Helps to make the monthly payment 
more affordable and allows homeowners to catch up on 
missed payments.
 
✓ Reinstatement: Allows homeowners to bring their payments 
current, as if nothing happened. This option is only for home-
owners who have recovered from a temporary setback.
 
✓ Refinancing: Puts homeowners in a lower-interest, fixed-rate 
loan.
 
✓ Short refinancing: Puts homeowners in a lower-interest, fixed-
rate loan for an amount less than is currently owed on the 
home.
 
✓ Government loan programs: Includes HomeSaver Advance 
(HSA) for catching up on late or missed payments. (For more 
about the HomeSaver Advance program, check out Chapter 10.)
 
✓ Selling the home: Allows homeowners to get out from under 
an unaffordable home and cash out any equity in it.

Part I: Getting Up to Speed on Loan Modification  
14
 
✓ Short sale: Involves selling a home for less than the unpaid 
balance without owing the lender anything after the sale.
 
✓ Selling to an investor: May be appropriate when time to 
explore other options is close to running out and the investor 
has the resources to save the home (and the integrity to 
help). This option often requires a substantial amount of 
equity that the homeowners are unable to tap into because 
of credit or employment issues.
 
✓ Redemption: Involves buying back the home after the fore-
closure sale. This option isn’t available in all states.
 
✓ Deed in lieu of foreclosure: Gives the property to the bank, 
and the homeowners walk away without owing anything on it.
We provide this grocery list of options only to make you aware of 
some viable foreclosure alternatives. For additional details about 
each option, turn to Chapter 3.
 
Finally, you can consider the following two options. But be aware 
that they aren’t bona fide foreclosure alternatives because you still 
end up losing your home in foreclosure.
 
✓ Abandoning the home: This is only an option after you’ve 
exhausted all other options and can’t deal with the lender.
 
✓ Doing nothing: This is one of the worst options, second only 
to falling victim to a foreclosure rescue scam.
 
If you’re considering either of these last two options, beware of the 
possibility of a deficiency judgment. In states that allow deficiency 
judgments, your lender may try to force you to pay the difference 
between what you owed the lender and what the lender recouped 
through the sale of your home.
Do You Qualify?
The only sure-fire way to determine whether you qualify for a loan 
modification is to apply for one and see what happens, and that’s 
really not all that sure-fire either. You could meet all the eligibility 
requirements and have your request denied due to a technicality 
or a mistake made by you or your lender.
 
If your house payment is unaffordable, apply for a loan modifica-
tion, even if something you heard or read leads you to believe that 
you’re ineligible. Keeping this in mind, the following list can help 
you determine whether you’re likely to qualify; if these statements 
apply to your situation, your chances look pretty good:

 Chapter 1: Keeping Your Home by Modifying Your Loan 15
 
✓ The house is your primary residence, not a second home or 
vacation property.
 
✓ You’re committed to doing what’s necessary to keep your 
house.
 
✓ You have sufficient income to afford a reasonable house 
payment.
 
✓ You experienced a qualifying financial hardship that has 
made your current house payment unaffordable. (Chapter 8 
describes qualifying hardships.)
 
Eligibility requirements may vary among lenders and can change 
over time. Contact your lender (see Chapter 5) or consult a loan 
modification expert (see Chapter 4) to determine whether you’re 
likely to qualify for a loan modification or other workout solution.
Assessing Your Needs
We recommend pursuing several foreclosure alternatives at the 
same time. List your property for sale, consult a bankruptcy attor-
ney, research the loan modification option, talk to a mortgage 
broker about refinancing, and so on. Eventually, however, you 
need to make a decision about what you really want and what’s 
best for you and any significant others living in the home with you.
At some point in the process, earlier rather than later, gather the 
family’s decision makers, discuss your exit strategies, and deter-
mine which options are viable for you. Chapter 2 shows you how 
to crunch the numbers and perform a realistic assessment of your 
situation, Chapter 3 describes the available foreclosure alterna-
tives to consider, and Chapter 7 helps you decide what to ask for.
Opting to Work with a Pro 
or Go It Alone
Loan modification is a team sport. You have to work with your 
lender or through a third-party representative to get ’er done. 
So which option is best? Read on to find out why we recommend 
hiring a pro and what you should do if you opt to do it yourself.
Hiring a pro
We recommend hiring an expert to represent you for several 
reasons, including the following:

Part I: Getting Up to Speed on Loan Modification  
16
 
✓ Your lender usually has an attorney representing its interests, 
so you should have your own representative defending your 
interests.
 
✓ You may have only one shot at submitting your application 
correctly. Having an experienced expert prepare your applica-
tion is like having a headhunter craft your resume.
 
✓ A loan modification expert knows the system and how to work 
it for your benefit.
 
✓ An expert can quickly prescreen you, so if you probably aren’t 
eligible for a loan modification, you won’t end up wasting 
time, energy, and money trying to get one.
 
✓ An expert can take all the hassles off your plate, freeing up 
your time and energy to get a better handle on your finances.
 
✓ An expert is free from the emotional baggage that can under-
mine negotiations. Being emotionally involved, you’re more 
likely to engage in arguments and make poor decisions.
 
✓ A seasoned pro knows immediately whether the offer a lender 
pitches is fair and square.
 
✓ You’ll probably more than recoup the cost of hiring an expert 
from the amount of money he or she saves you by getting a 
better deal than you could on your own.
Lenders often try to dissuade distressed borrowers from hiring 
their own representation. After all, lenders often claim, “We’ll 
modify your mortgage for free.” Sure, they’ll modify it, but are they 
going to modify it to true affordability? Chapter 4 has details on 
finding, selecting, and teaming up with a loan modification expert.
Dealing directly with your lender
Although we strongly encourage distressed homeowners to seek 
expert representation, we’re aware that many homeowners are 
do-it-yourselfers. They fix their own plumbing, install their own 
light fixtures, hang their own wallpaper . . . nobody’s going to 
convince them to pay an expert for doing what they can do on 
their own!
If you’re an avid do-it-yourselfer, we applaud you. With the right 
training (provided in this book), you can get up to speed on the 
process, avoid common pitfalls, and negotiate an affordable loan 
modification. Just be sure to read Chapter 5 prior to contacting 
your lender and Chapters 11 and 12 to avoid the most common 
traps.

Getting Your Ducks in a Row
Successful preparation can optimize the outcome of your loan 
modification, so spend some time upfront getting organized, set-
ting realistic expectations, and keeping track of everything. In the 
following sections, we reveal what you should be doing to prepare 
for and stay on top of the process.
Gathering essential documents
A loan modification application may be a short form that appears 
deceptively easy to complete. The complicated part is gathering all 
the documents and information you need to fill in the blanks and 
to submit as supporting documentation. In Chapter 6, we provide a 
list of commonly required documentation, but you can get a jump 
on the process by tracking down or preparing the following items:
 
✓ Existing mortgage document and note
 
✓ Most recent mortgage statement
 
✓ Monthly budget showing income and expenses
 
✓ Proof of income, including federal income tax returns, W-2s, 
and recent paycheck stubs
 
✓ Home valuation showing your property’s current market value
 
 If you live in a jurisdiction that allows real estate agents to 
provide home valuations, you may be able to obtain this 
document for free or a minimal fee. Don’t pay for an appraisal 
unless your lender requires it. If your lender requires an 
appraisal, it will usually order the appraisal and bill you.
 
✓ Proof of financial hardship (if available), such as divorce 
papers, hospital bills, or notice of a rate adjustment on an 
adjustable-rate mortgage
If you hire professional representation, gather authorization letters 
giving your lenders permission to share information with your rep-
resentative (Chapter 6 provides a sample letter).
Plotting the timeline
Few things are more nerve-wracking than having to wait while 
someone else determines your destiny, and loan modification has 
plenty of waiting associated with it. You may submit your applica-
tion and hear nothing for several weeks. To keep the stress of the 
waiting game at a dull roar, obtain some key dates and other infor-
mation by asking the following questions:

Part I: Getting Up to Speed on Loan Modification  
18
 
✓ If you’re hiring someone to represent you, how long is it likely 
to take to prepare your application?
 
✓ Does your application stop the foreclosure process? If not, 
will you be able to resolve this before the foreclosure sale?
 
✓ After submitting your application, when can you expect to 
hear something? If you don’t hear something, whom should 
you call?
 
✓ When can you expect to have this all wrapped up? (A typical 
loan modification takes 30 to 90 days to complete.)
 
Your lender probably has a timeline for every stage in the process. 
It should have no problem sharing this information with you. Some 
lenders receive so many modification requests that it takes them 
three to seven days just to retrieve information faxed to them.
Logging all correspondence
Only really neurotic people keep detailed records of correspon-
dence and phone conversations, but when you’re fighting to keep 
your home, being neurotic isn’t necessarily a bad thing. In fact, it 
can pay dividends later, particularly if a dispute arises between 
you and your lender about something that was said or not said, 
done or not done.
In Chapter 9, we provide a contact log sheet and details on how 
to keep accurate records. If you contact the lender before reading 
Chapter 9, make sure you do the following:
 
✓ Keep copies of all written correspondence and include the 
date and time you sent or received it.
 
✓ Jot down the name, employee ID number (if available), phone 
number, and extension of anyone you speak to; an overview of 
what the conversation was about; anything that was promised 
or resolved; and the date and time of the conversation.
Following the Process from 
Point A to Point B
Earlier in this chapter, in the section “Plotting the timeline,” we 
encourage you to ask your lender several questions about the 
timing of the process so you know what to expect. Having a bird’s-
eye view of the loan modification process can also put everything 
into perspective, enable you to develop realistic expectations, and 
provide a context for understanding each stage of the experience.

 Chapter 1: Keeping Your Home by Modifying Your Loan 19
The following sections provide tips on optimizing the outcome and 
negotiating the most affordable deal your lender is willing to offer.
Preparing and submitting 
your application
The kick-off to loan modification is the application process. In most 
cases, you can obtain the application form and instructions by 
doing one of the following:
 
✓ Visit the lender’s Web site, and then complete and submit 
the application online, assuming your lender offers a secure 
online form (a few do).
 
✓ Download printable forms from the lender’s Web site and mail 
them to the lender.
 
✓ Call and ask your lender or servicer to send you a loan modifi-
cation application packet.
 
The servicer is the company that collects and processes your 
mortgage payments. It can be (but rarely is) the lender or investor 
that owns your mortgage. You’ll probably be dealing with your 
servicer, even if we tell you to talk to your lender.
Whether you apply online or via snail mail, your lender probably 
requires that you submit supporting documentation: copies of 
your federal income tax return and W-2s to verify employment 
and income; a signed Form 4506, which allows your lender to pull 
your tax returns; recent bank statements; and perhaps even proof 
of financial hardship. Follow your lender’s instructions to submit 
everything required. See Chapter 8 for details.
Playing the waiting game
Lenders typically require two to three weeks to process a loan 
modification application, which means you get to wait and wring 
your hands for two weeks. To add to your aggravation, your lender 
will probably continue its collection activities, so don’t expect the 
collection letters and phone calls to stop while you wait.
 
Remain active during this processing period. Explore other options 
described in Chapter 3, including bankruptcy, refinancing, and list-
ing your home for sale. You should have a plan B, C, and D to fall 
back on if your loan modification falls through. In addition, keep an 
eye on the timeline and check in with your lender if you don’t hear 
something when you were supposed to.

Making your case during the 
homeowner interview
At some point in the process, you’re likely to be required to speak 
with someone about your situation — your representative (prior to 
applying) or your lender (after you apply). The person conducting 
the interview tries to determine whether
 
✓ You’re credible and are pursuing a loan modification because 
you really need one, not just because you want one.
 
✓ You’re committed to doing what’s necessary to keep your home.
 
✓ You experienced an eligible financial hardship.
 
✓ You have or will have the resources required to deliver on 
your end of the new agreement.
In Chapter 10, we show you how to prepare for a homeowner inter-
view and communicate effectively with your lender.
 
Be careful when speaking directly to your lender. Anything you say 
can and will be used against you. This is another reason we recom-
mend working through your own representative, who can filter 
what you say.
Structuring a workout plan
A loan modification is actually an addendum to your original 
mortgage, laying out only what has changed from the original 
agreement, so it’s typically shorter. In most cases, the loan 
modification is structured to make one or more of the following 
changes to the mortgage:
 
✓ Reduce the interest rate
 
✓ Convert an ARM into a fixed-interest rate mortgage
 
✓ Extend the term
 
✓ Reduce the unpaid principal balance
 
✓ Institute a lower, more affordable monthly payment
 
✓ State the plan for catching up on any late or missed payments
You may or may not have input on how the lender chooses to 
modify your mortgage to arrive at the lower monthly payment, but 
you should have input during the negotiating phase. The Making 
Home Affordable (MHA) plan recommends that lenders take the 
following waterfall approach to arrive at an affordable payment:

 Chapter 1: Keeping Your Home by Modifying Your Loan 21
 
1. Reduce the interest rate.
 
2. Extend the term if an interest rate reduction alone is insuf-
ficient in achieving affordability.
 
3. Forgive or forbear a portion of the unpaid principal bal-
ance if an interest rate reduction and term extension are 
insufficient.
Reviewing the lender’s initial offer
 
A loan modification can adjust anything stated in the original 
mortgage, so you need to read it carefully (and have your attorney 
review and approve it) before you sign on the dotted line.
Lenders often present their plans as take-it-or-leave it offers and 
give borrowers little time to respond. Don’t cave in to the pressure 
by making a rushed decision. Review the lender’s initial offer care-
fully, keeping in mind that the terms of the agreement are likely 
negotiable. In Chapter 11, we show you how to pick through the 
lender’s initial offer without nit-picking your way out of a solution.
 
The most important part of any loan modification agreement is the 
monthly payment. Make sure it’s affordable. If the agreement calls 
for step-rate adjustments (regular increases in the interest rate over 
time), find out what your payment will be with each adjustment. 
Make sure the worst-case scenario is still affordable.
Pitching your counteroffer
Unless your lender pitched you a golden egg of an offer, you prob-
ably want to negotiate one or more of the terms stated in the new 
agreement. You should always pitch your counteroffer in writing, 
and it should always include the following details about each 
clause you want changed:
 
✓ The clause itself, which you may be able to refer to by number
 
✓ The desired change using your preferred rewording, unless 
you simply want the clause removed
Chapter 12 can help you negotiate a better deal.
 
In real estate, everything needs to be in writing to be legally bind-
ing. Don’t let anyone convince you that some understanding you 
reach outside the parameters of the contract is good enough. Get 
everything in writing.

Part I: Getting Up to Speed on Loan Modification  
22
Closing the deal: Now what?
After you sign and submit the loan modification agreement, your 
lender should provide you with copies of the executed agreement, 
signed and dated by all authorized parties. If you don’t receive 
copies, or if the copies provided aren’t signed and dated, request 
them from your lender. Your lender may also officially record the 
modification with the county register of deeds or the county clerk.
At this point, you’ve successfully completed the loan modification 
process and should have an affordable monthly mortgage payment. 
Your job now is to hold up your end of the deal by continuing to 
earn income and keep your discretionary spending in check. You 
don’t want to go through something like this again. In Chapter 16, 
we provide ten tips for long-term success.
Taking Legal Action — 
Only If Necessary
As a borrower, you have rights. Your lender has the responsibility 
to honor those rights through full disclosure. Your lender isn’t 
allowed to play a bait-and-switch, dangling an attractive offer in 
front of your nose and then sticking you with a high-cost mortgage. 
Several pieces of government legislation are designed to protect 
borrowers from unfair lending practices, including the following:
 
✓ TILA (Truth in Lending Act) promotes the informed use of 
consumer credit by requiring disclosures about terms and 
costs.
 
✓ HOEPA (Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act) is 
designed to curtail predatory lending practices, particularly 
the practice of placing homeowners in high-interest loans.
 
✓ RESPA (Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act) standardizes 
closing procedures and paperwork to keep transactions above-
board and make the process less confusing for borrowers.
In Chapter 13, we cover these important pieces of legislation in 
greater detail. In Chapters 14 and 15, we show you how to use 
them to your advantage in negotiating a better deal with your 
lender.
 
Although these acts do allow victims to take legal action against 
violators, we usually recommend using these statutes to push for 
a settlement outside the courtroom. Litigation can be expensive, 
time-consuming, and aggravating.

hen considering a loan modification, it helps to draw a map 
leading from where you are now to where you envision 
yourself being after you negotiate your loan modification. Start 
with a point labeled “You Are Here” that defines your current 
position and how you arrived at this point.
By determining the event or series of events that have led to the 
current financial crisis and by having a sense of where you stand at 
this point in time, you get a much clearer idea of what it will take to 
dig yourself out of this hole and which options are available to you.
Understanding How You 
Ended Up in This Mess
One of the best ways to solve any problem is to investigate its 
cause, formulate an immediate plan of action, and then develop a 
long-term solution. For example, if you can’t pay your mortgage, 
you may trace the cause back to when your adjustable-rate mort-
gage adjusted up. Your immediate plan of action may be to cut 
spending so you can afford the higher payments. Your long-term 
solution may be to work out a solution with your lender to lower 
the payments.

Part I: Getting Up to Speed on Loan Modification  
24
When you’re facing the possibility of being unable to afford your 
monthly house payments, the causes generally fall into either of 
two categories: something that happened to you, or something you 
did. In the following sections, we help you identify possible causes 
of your situation, starting with the mortgage meltdown that began 
in 2008. We then move on to other causes beyond your control 
before addressing some avoidable triggers.
 
Knowing how you ended up with house payments you can’t afford 
is also important when the time comes to apply for a loan modifi-
cation. Most lenders require a hardship letter explaining what hap-
pened, as we discuss in Chapter 8. Figuring out what happened can 
make writing the hardship letter much easier.
The mortgage meltdown: From 
Wall Street to Main Street
One of the top news stories in 2008 centered on the mortgage 
meltdown and the ensuing foreclosure epidemic — the worst fore-
closure epidemic since the Great Depression.
Although homeowners/borrowers played a role in triggering the 
meltdown, many other factors contributed to it. When you have a 
general understanding of what happened, you benefit in two ways:
 
✓ You’re less likely to feel guilty or embarrassed knowing that 
the current situation isn’t entirely your fault.
 
✓ Knowing that others may have played a role may motivate 
you to seek relief through a loan modification.
In the following sections, we describe many of the factors that con-
tributed to the mortgage meltdown and subsequent rise in defaults 
and foreclosures.
Historically low interest rates
To stimulate the economy after the dot-com crash in the 1990s, 
the Federal Reserve System lowered interest rates, enabling more 
people to borrow more money. Although having low interest rates 
is generally a good thing, this easy money contributed to the cre-
ation of a housing bubble, a condition in which home values and 
equity are artificially inflated.
Homeowners cashed out this artificially inflated value through 
refinancing and home equity lines of credit. When the bubble 
burst and the economy took a nose dive, they were left with little 
or no equity or negative equity, large mortgage payments, and 

 Chapter 2: Taking Stock of Your Situation 25
insufficient income to afford those payments. Even worse, they 
couldn’t refinance their way out of trouble because the equity 
they thought they had in their homes had disappeared.
Government policies and legislation — and lack thereof
Economists have identified several possible factors contributing to 
the mortgage meltdown related to policies and legislation. The first 
factor is the passage of the Financial Services Modernization Act in 
1999, which essentially repealed the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933 that 
was in place to protect against the irresponsible lending practices 
that contributed to the Great Depression. The Financial Services 
Modernization Act enabled banks to diversify in ways that allowed 
them to operate in a less-regulated environment.
The second contributing factor is the U.S. Congress’s failure to 
pass legislation to address warnings from Fed Chairman Alan 
Greenspan and others that government-sponsored enterprises 
(also known as GSEs) Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac needed to be 
more closely monitored and regulated. These two GSEs are respon-
sible for making investor money available to the mortgage lending 
industry. The legislation may not have prevented the financial 
meltdown, but it would have significantly reduced its magnitude.
The third policy-related contributing factor is that, under pressure 
from Congress to make homeownership more affordable, Fannie 
Mae and Freddie Mac jumped headfirst into buying and guarantee-
ing subprime and Alt-A mortgage loans. This action flooded the 
subprime market with cash, and subprime originations boomed to 
over 20 percent of all mortgages originated in 2006, up more than 
13 percent from just three years earlier. Congress bought it, and 
Fannie and Freddie retained their unrestrained preferred-status.
Lack of state and federal regulatory oversight
Even without the passage of the legislation discussed in the pre-
vious section, state and federal regulators had plenty of tools in 
place to keep lenders in check. The question of why regulators 
didn’t crack down on both lenders and borrowers remains unan-
swered. The only possible explanation is that the regulators failed 
to do their job.
Soaring Wall Street demand for mortgage-backed securities
Over the years, Wall Street developed a voracious appetite for 
mortgage-backed securities (MBSs) made available through secu-
ritization, a process of bundling loans and selling them as securi-
ties to investors. Refer to the nearby sidebar for a blow-by-blow 
description of how this works.

Part I: Getting Up to Speed on Loan Modification  
26
Securitization in itself isn’t bad, but what happened is that the 
demand for MBSs on Wall Street became so high that lenders 
began doing everything possible to feed the demand. One solution 
was to bundle high- and low-risk loans together, convince a credit 
rating company to assign a high rating to the packages, and sell 
them on Wall Street as triple-A-rated securities. In other words, 
investors were duped into paying top dollar for risky loans.
All was fine until the loans stopped performing. Then, investors 
lost confidence in the system and pulled out their money. Without 
money from investors, Fannie and Freddie began running out of 
money to provide to banks, which ran out of money to provide to 
borrowers. End result: a credit crunch of epic proportions.
The subprime boom
To make it easier for more applicants to qualify for mortgage loans, 
many loan originators (loan officers and mortgage brokers) placed 
borrowers into subprime loans, typically adjustable-rate mortgages 
(ARMs) that had low teaser rates and fewer restrictions than other 
loans.
Unfortunately, when rates adjusted up and property values 
dropped at the same time, lenders began tightening restrictions on 
even the subprime loans, which meant that subprime borrowers 
with no money and poor credit scores were really stuck, unable to 
qualify for refinancing under the new rules.
The 123s of the securitization process
To understand securitization, it helps to know where banks get the money to lend 
to homeowners. The process includes investors, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, 
banks and other lending institutions, and you, the homeowner. Here’s basically 
how it works:
 1. You borrow money to purchase your home from a bank or other mortgage 
lender.
 2. The lender sells the mortgage and loan to Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac so it (the 
lender) then has more money to loan to other borrowers.
 3. Fannie or Freddie packages your loan with others to create mortgage-backed 
securities (MBSs), which it then sells to investors on Wall Street. Fannie and 
Freddie guarantee the principal and interest payments, so these are pretty 
safe investments for investors. By selling these securities, Fannie and Freddie 
replenish their supply of cash to provide to lenders.

 Chapter 2: Taking Stock of Your Situation 27
Big profits for brokering loans
During the mortgage boom in the late 1990s, mortgage brokers and 
loan officers were raking in the dough. Unfortunately, their com-
missions were usually based on their ability to manipulate the loan 
product and the number of loans closed rather than the number of 
stable loans approved.
Driven by a strong profit motive and often encouraged by lenders 
trying to feed Wall Street’s appetite for mortgage-backed securi-
ties, brokers and loan officers pushed through as many loans as 
they could. As a result, they expedited the approval of many loan 
applications that should never have been considered.
Relaxed underwriting practices
Lenders and any of their representatives who originate loans 
(including loan officers and mortgage brokers) profit by lending 
money. Low interest rates and increasing property values fueled 
demand for loans, and almost all the players in the mortgage lend-
ing industry were making big bucks. At the same time, competition 
among lenders was heating up.
To thrive in this competitive marketplace, many lenders relaxed 
their underwriting practices — that is, they scrutinized loan appli-
cations and the applicants’ finances much less closely. This made 
it easier for people to qualify for loans they never would have 
qualified for before. As a result, lenders often fostered a highly 
irresponsible corporate culture that led to the following:
 
✓ Close-at-all-cost attitude: The attitude among many mort-
gage brokers, loan officers, and lenders was that everyone 
should work together to do whatever required to have a loan 
approved.
 
✓ Stated and no doc loan products: Borrowers could qualify 
for mortgage loans without having to provide verification of 
employment or income.
 
✓ Swift approval — lock, close, fund: Instead of taking the time 
to properly review an application and its supporting documen-
tation, mortgage brokers, loan officers, and lenders subscribed 
to a “lock, close, fund” attitude to push loans through as 
quickly as possible.
Clueless consumers
As long as most people can pay the monthly bills, they see no 
problem with cashing out the equity in their homes or carrying 
large balances on their credit cards. In addition, many borrowers 
are under-informed about the various types of mortgage loans 

Part I: Getting Up to Speed on Loan Modification  
28
available (over 400 by last count) and therefore are unable to imag-
ine the worst-case scenarios that could occur with some types of 
loans.
Many borrowers, for example, assumed that taking out an 
adjustable-rate mortgage was a negligible risk or even a wise 
decision. Advertisements encouraged homeowners to refinance 
and take money out of their homes; presumably, the interest would 
be tax-deductible, thereby making it “good debt.” They were told 
they could easily refinance into lower fixed-rate loans later.
New home developers also fed consumer greed by using teaser 
loans to sell more add-ons, such as decks, bigger garages, and 
upscale kitchens. (A teaser loan has a low introductory interest rate 
and lower initial payments to make the loan seem more appealing.)
Irresponsible borrowing
In addition to a lack of insight and foresight, many consumers 
simply bit off more credit than they could chew. This is nothing 
new; consumers in the U.S. have a well-earned reputation for being 
over their heads in debt, but irresponsible borrowing along with a 
bursting housing bubble and a collapsing economy created ideal 
conditions for the perfect storm. This storm broke in 2008.
Other events beyond your control
As the saying goes, “Stuff happens.” Well, that’s not exactly how it 
goes, but you catch our drift. Bad things happen to good people, 
and certain bad things can often drive people into foreclosure 
or at least make it very difficult for them to afford that roof over 
their heads. In the following sections, we explore some of the most 
common bad things that put homeowners in a financial bind.
Job losses and pay cuts
Over the course of several years, the U.S. economy has lost a lot of 
good-paying jobs. You can blame it on the global economy, union-
busting, the American consumer’s appetite for cheap foreign goods, 
the healthcare crisis, or whatever other factors you like, but the 
truth of the matter is that a good chunk of the population began to 
see incomes that weren’t keeping up with inflation. As a result, many 
people cashed out equity in their homes and got buried in debt 
because they couldn’t keep up with the increasing cost of living.
The mortgage meltdown only worsened already bad conditions, 
driving down demand for goods and services and wiping out even 
more jobs, which led to more defaults and foreclosures. As you 
can see, these events create a cycle in which bad news simply 
leads to more bad news.

 Chapter 2: Taking Stock of Your Situation 29
Medical bills and burials
In good times and bad, people experience tragedies that can 
be costly — both emotionally and financially. Death and illness 
are the worst and often lead to defaults and foreclosures. This 
is especially true when families, especially those without health 
insurance, are hit with huge medical bills or when one or more 
breadwinners pass away or suffer an illness that prevents them 
from working.
 
In many cases, families lose their homes as a result of the financial 
straits accompanying illness or death, but if you can make a house 
payment, even a payment significantly less than you’re currently 
paying, a loan modification can keep you out of trouble and keep 
you in your home.
Common triggers you may 
have some control over
Many homeowners suffer financial fallout as a result of certain 
decisions or behaviors — something they or someone in their 
family has done or is doing. The most common events that fall into 
this category are the following:
 
✓ Divorce or separation: This sort of change reduces the family 
income while increasing expenses because it typically results 
in the need to support two households on the same income.
 
✓ Overspending: Living beyond one’s means leads to financial 
fiasco, plain and simple. Overspending is usually a problem 
family-wide, although one person may become the scapegoat.
 
✓ Gambling: Gambling addiction has become very common in 
the U.S., and unless the gambler is earning enough money to 
support the addiction, financial woe usually results.
 
✓ Alcohol and substance abuse: Alcohol and substance abuse 
are two expensive habits that also compromise a person’s 
earning potential.
Other than not getting divorced or separated, you can’t do much 
to address the root cause of your inability to pay your mortgage 
due to divorce or separation. For the other three items on the list, 
however, you need to deal with those issues (overspending, gam-
bling, or substance abuse) in tandem with pursuing a loan modifi-
cation. Otherwise, no loan modification is going to keep you out of 
default or foreclosure. To have a successful loan modification you 
may also need a life modification.

Part I: Getting Up to Speed on Loan Modification

Don’t play the blame game. Regardless of what decisions, behav-
iors, or events have led to your current financial problems, 
blaming your partner or others who may be responsible is counter-
productive. If you’re in this situation with others, you need to team 
up with them to address any and all related problems.
Sizing Up Your Financial Situation
Until you figure out how much money is flowing in and flowing 
out, where all that money’s flowing, and how deep you are in debt, 
you can’t even begin to develop a strategy for taking control of 
your finances. Taking a close, honest look at the numbers can help 
you reveal income and expense categories that are sinking your 
monthly budget, figure out just how deep in debt you are, and sort 
out the essential expenses from your discretionary spending.
Tallying your monthly income
Taking stock of your financial position begins by tallying your 
monthly income. To get started, list all your sources of income. 
The following list can tickle your memory into recalling where all 
the money’s coming from:
 
✓ Day job income: This consists of all steady income from your 
main job. If you have a partner with a steady income, count 
that, too.
 
✓ Moonlighting income: If you have another job that produces 
steady income, such as a regular babysitting gig on weekends, 
include it as part of your household income.
 
✓ Rental income: If you collect rent from boarders, it’s part of 
your household income.
 
✓ Investment income: If you have any stocks, bonds, real 
estate, or other investments that generate a steady monthly 
return, include those amounts in your calculations.
 
✓ Other income: Can you think of any other income, such as 
payments from a trust fund, 401(k) distributions, or retire-
ment plan payments? If so, include it as part of your monthly 
income.
 
When calculating your monthly income, take a conservative 
approach. Earning some extra money on the side is always good in 
a pinch, but if you can’t rely on getting that money each and every 
month, don’t include it in your monthly income. You can use that 
extra money to catch up on your bills faster than your plan calls 
for, but extra dough isn’t part of your plan.

 Chapter 2: Taking Stock of Your Situation 31
Computing your payments on debt
Debt is relative both in terms of amount and how you feel about 
it. Some people are up to their gills in debt and seem not to have 
a worry in the world, whereas others constantly fret over owing 
$100,000 or more on their homes. Others flat-out refuse to use a 
credit card to pay for anything.
Although debt is relative, you need to quantify it somehow to 
figure out for yourself just how deeply you’re in debt and how 
deep is too deep. In the following sections, you calculate your 
total debt and the total amount of your monthly payments on 
all your debt — including your mortgage and credit cards. Later 
in this chapter, in the section “Calculating your debt-to-income 
ratios,” you see how to gauge your debt by comparing it to how 
much you earn each month.
Adding up your total debt
If you’re like most people, you have other debts in addition to your 
mortgage loan. Use the following list to total the balances you’re 
currently carrying on all your loans and other accounts:
 
✓ First mortgage
 
✓ Second mortgage
 
✓ Home equity loan or line of credit
 
✓ Construction loans, such as those for new windows or siding
 
✓ Car loans
 
✓ Student loans or parent-of-student loans
 
✓ Credit card accounts (don’t include this item if you always 
pay off the full balance due when you receive your statement 
and don’t carry a residual balance)
 
✓ Any credit card balances or loans that your partner has taken 
out only in his or her name
 
✓ Private loans, such as money you borrowed from your parents 
or sister-in-law
 
Your long-term goal may be to pay down this total debt over time, 
starting with the debt you’re paying the highest interest on. In the 
short term, however, you simply want to be able to cover your 
monthly bills without going any deeper in debt, as explained in the 
following section. Your first priority should be your home loan.

Part I: Getting Up to Speed on Loan Modification  
32
Figuring out your monthly debt payments
Later in this chapter, in the section “Dissecting your current budget,” 
you take a close look at your entire budget to determine whether 
your monthly take-home pay is sufficient to cover your monthly bills. 
For now, we want you to focus only on debt payments — monthly 
payments on all the loans and other balances you accounted for in 
the previous section.
List your minimum monthly payment for each of the loans and 
accounts you identified in the previous section. Now, add them up 
to determine your total monthly debt payments.
Calculating your debt-to-income 
ratios
One way to measure the financial well-being of your household is 
to look at your debt ratio, or debt-to-income (DTI) ratio, which is the 
percentage of your monthly income that you spend to service your 
debt. Lenders use the following two debt ratios to gauge the risk 
that a particular borrower represents:
 
✓ Back-end ratio: Accounts for all your debt payments, including 
your house payment, car payment, and credit card payments
 
✓ Front-end ratio: Accounts only for your house payment

Investors can tell you that not all debt is bad. For example, if you can borrow money 
at 15 percent interest to fuel an investment that earns you a 25 percent profit, taking 
on that debt can be a very good idea. Paying 18 percent interest on a credit card 
used to charge grocery bills, on the other hand, doesn’t constitute good debt. It only 
leads to way over-paying for your groceries.
Good debt consists of money you borrow to acquire items that increase in value 
at a rate that exceeds the interest you pay on that debt. You also can take on good 
debt by purchasing something on credit that enables you to generate income; for 
example, you may purchase a car to drive to work or buy a computer that enables 
you to earn significantly more money than the cost of that computer.
One of the best strategies for improving your financial position is to reduce the 
amount of bad debt you carry. One of the best strategies for building long-term 
wealth is to wisely manage the amount of good debt you carry.

 Chapter 2: Taking Stock of Your Situation 33
Debt payments don’t include what you spend on groceries, utili-
ties, clothing, gas, and other such items. In addition, the calcula-
tion uses only the income of the person who’s listed on the note. If 
you and your partner “own” the home together but only your name 
is on the note for the loan, only your monthly income is counted. 
If you’re both listed as mortgagors (borrowers), your combined 
monthly income is used in computing your DTI ratios.
 
The house payment used in calculating the DTI ratio includes 
principal and interest along with any monthly escrow payments to 
cover homeowner’s insurance, property taxes, and in some cases 
any homeowner association fees (HOAs). If you pay homeowner’s 
insurance, property taxes, and HOAs separately rather than paying 
into escrow, total the costs and divide by 12 to determine the 
monthly amount for those items; then add that amount to your 
monthly house payment when calculating your debt ratio.
Back-end ratio
To determine your back-end ratio, use the following formula:
Back-end Debt Ratio = Total Monthly Debt Payments ÷ Gross 
Monthly Income
Traditionally, the Federal Housing Authority (FHA) has recom-
mended that a borrower’s back-end ratio not exceed 41 percent. 
For conventional loans, many banks want to see a back-end ratio 
that’s 36 percent or lower.
Front-end ratio
To determine your front-end ratio, use the following formula:
Front-end Debt Ratio = House Payment ÷ Gross Monthly 
Income
Traditionally, the FHA has recommended that a borrower’s front-
end ratio not exceed 29 percent. For conventional loans, many 
banks require a front-end ratio that’s 28 percent or lower. We rec-
ommend 30 percent as a ballpark figure. According to the Making 
Home Affordable (MHA) plan (often referred to as the Obama 
Plan), the front-end ratio target for modified loans is 31 percent.
A safer ratio
 
Although we present the standard formulas for calculating debt 
ratios, we recommend that you use different formulas in order to 
set safer goals.

Part I: Getting Up to Speed on Loan Modification  
34
Back-end Debt Ratio = Total Monthly Debt Payments ÷ Net 
Monthly Income
Front-end Debt Ratio = House Payment ÷ Net Monthly Income
These formulas use net pay instead of gross pay; in other words, 
they base the calculation on your take-home pay — the only 
money you really have to spend.
For example, suppose you have a monthly gross income of $3,000, 
but after deductions, your take-home pay is only $2,250. You have 
a monthly house payment of $800 (principal, interest, and escrow 
for homeowner’s insurance and property taxes). Using the tradi-
tional DTI formula, your front-end ratio would be
$800 ÷ $3,000 = 26%
That’s well below the 29 percent required by the FHA and even 
below what most lenders would approve for a conventional mort-
gage. But how affordable is that same $800 payment when the DTI 
is based on take-home pay? Do the math:
$800 ÷ $2,250 = 35%
That’s way above the 29 percent required to qualify under FHA 
guidelines, and when you consider that 35 percent of everything 
you earn goes toward your house payment, you aren’t left with a 
whole lot of spending money.
You probably won’t see this approach gain nationwide support 
because it would further tighten lending restrictions and disqualify 
many would-be borrowers, but it’s out there and something to be 
aware of. Debt ratio calculations based on net monthly income are 
also gaining some popularity among conservative financial minds. 
Consider using these alternative formulas, especially when looking 
at a major monthly payment like a mortgage.
In the section “Estimating an Affordable House Payment” later in 
this chapter, we show you how to rearrange these formulas to 
work backward and calculate an affordable house payment based 
on your net monthly income.
Dissecting your current budget
Except for people who majored in accounting and aced the math 
portion of their SATs, budgeting isn’t exactly one of America’s 
favorite pastimes. As long as they have enough money to pay the 
bills, most people can afford not to budget. When money is tight, 
however, you need to start tracking your income and expenses.

 Chapter 2: Taking Stock of Your Situation 35
If you haven’t yet accounted for your income, that’s the first step. 
Skip back to the section “Tallying your monthly income” earlier 
in this chapter for details. When you’re done there, you’re ready 
to proceed to the following sections to begin itemizing your 
expenses.
 
Consider using an accounting program, such as Quicken, to track 
all your income and expenses. With an accounting program, you 
can assign every transaction to a category and then generate a 
report that displays all your expenses, itemized by category.
Totaling your monthly bills
When you’re working on a budget, guessing doesn’t work. Grab 
your check register or whatever you use to track deposits into 
and payments out of your checking account, and refer to those 
numbers to determine how much you’re spending each month in 
various categories. If you don’t use a check register or some other 
tracking device, now’s the time to start.
Begin with the big-ticket items, such as the following:
 
✓ House payment
 
✓ Homeowner’s insurance, unless it’s paid out of escrow for you
 
✓ Property taxes, unless they’re paid out of escrow for you
 
✓ Car payment(s)
 
✓ Credit card payments
 
✓ Other loan payments
 
✓ Childcare and/or tuition payments
 
✓ Auto insurance (if you don’t pay it monthly, figure out how 
much you would pay if you were paying monthly)
 
✓ Health insurance, unless it’s automatically deducted from 
your paycheck
 
✓ Life insurance, unless it’s automatically deducted from your 
paycheck
 
✓ Utility bills, including gas, electric, phone, water, sewage, and 
trash bills
 
✓ Other bills that come every month, including your cable or 
satellite TV bill
Tracking other expenditures
Other expenditures essentially comprise your daily living 
expenses. These typically include the following:

Part I: Getting Up to Speed on Loan Modification  
36
 
✓ Groceries
 
✓ Personal care, including haircuts, toiletries, and the like
 
✓ Clothing
 
✓ Auto maintenance, including routine maintenance like oil 
changes and tune-ups
 
✓ Auto fuel
 
✓ Dining out
 
✓ Entertainment, including renting movies, going to movies and 
concerts, and so on
 
✓ Gifts
 
✓ Household repairs and supplies
 
✓ Gambling (yes, playing the lottery counts)
 
✓ Vacations, including holiday travel
 
✓ Scheduled savings (include an investment in your future and 
financial security as a monthly expense)
 
✓ Pet care, including food, toys, and vet bills
If you’re unsure about how much you spend in each category, try 
to make as accurate an estimate as possible, and start tracking 
your spending in each of these categories and any others that you 
identify over the next several weeks.
 
Consider using a separate envelope to budget for each expense 
category. When you get paid, set aside a certain amount of cash 
in each envelope and use only that cash to purchase items and 
services in that category. If you’re overspending in one category, 
you may find a surplus in other categories to make up the differ-
ence, or you may decide that you need to trim your spending in 
a particular category. Don’t get discouraged if, after filling your 
envelopes, you’re holding only a few bucks.
Identifying unaccounted-for expenses
Chances are pretty good that you can’t account for every single 
penny you’re spending, but minor expenses can add up to a good 
chunk of change over a month’s time, so try to account for 
everything.
 
Consider one of the following techniques to keep better track of 
unaccounted-for expenses or to slash these types of expenditures:

 Chapter 2: Taking Stock of Your Situation 37
 
✓ Carry around a notebook and log all your purchases. (This 
exercise lasts about six hours for most people.)
 
✓ Pay yourself an allowance. If you implemented the envelope 
budgeting technique from the previous section, create an 
envelope for yourself, too.
Estimating an Affordable 
House Payment
When you were looking at homes, somebody — your real estate 
agent or mortgage broker — probably told you how much house 
you could afford. To convince you to look at higher-priced homes 
and take out a larger mortgage, they probably used the FHA debt-
to-income ratio guidelines to estimate affordability.
Unfortunately, they probably didn’t take into consideration your 
lifestyle — how many children you have, what sorts of vacations 
you like to take, whether you smoke or drink, the kind of car you 
drive, and so on. In other words, they may have known your DTI 
ratio, but they probably didn’t account for all that other stuff in 
your budget that had nothing to do with rent.
As a result, you may have ended up buying more home than you 
could really afford or buying a home that didn’t accommodate 
your lifestyle or leave you with a sufficient buffer for any bad 
times. We recommend that you calculate a more realistic estimate 
yourself, using the methods described in the following sections. 
Use both methods, and then go with the lower of the two.
Basing your estimate on a 
conservative back-end ratio
Based on the formula used to calculate the back-end debt-to-
income ratio, we developed the following formula for estimating an 
affordable house payment. This formula takes into account all your 
debt payments (mortgage, car loan, credit card payments, and so 
on) and projects a house payment based on a debt-to-income ratio 
of 36 percent and on net income (not gross income):
(0.36 × Net Monthly Income) – Total Debt Payments, Excluding 
House Payment = Affordable House Payment

Part I: Getting Up to Speed on Loan Modification  
38
For example, suppose you’re earning $3,500 per month take-home 
pay. You have a $250 car payment, $150 per month in student 
loans, and $200 per month in credit card payments; your total debt 
payments excluding your house payment equal $600. The formula 
would look like this:
(0.36 × $3,500) – $600 = $660 per month
 
Get rid of the high-interest credit card payment of $200 a month, 
and you can afford a house payment of $860. The difference 
between an $860 and a $660 monthly house payment can mean an 
upgrade in neighborhood, more square footage, better schools for 
the children, safer streets, and so on. Slashing expenses can actu-
ally improve your quality of life. Make a commitment to yourself 
and your future to eliminate credit card debt. You’ll notice a big 
difference.
Basing your estimate on 
your monthly budget
Assuming you’ve performed an honest accounting of all your 
income and expenses and you know within about $100 per month 
where you’re spending your monthly take-home pay, you can start 
working backward to estimate an affordable monthly payment.
Begin by subtracting your total monthly expenses (excluding your 
house payment) from your total monthly income.
Monthly Income – Monthly Expenses, Excluding House 
Payment = Money Available for House Payment
Assuming you’ve been unable to make your house payment, that 
Money Available for House Payment number is going to be nega-
tive or closer to zero than any lender would consider. If it shows 
that you have plenty of money to make a house payment, you don’t 
have an accurate estimate of expenses. Otherwise, you’d be able to 
make your payments and wouldn’t be reading this book.
In cases where the Money Available for House Payment is too 
high, we usually observe a lot of small, unaccounted-for purchases 
(often paid for with cash). Even just $3 per day on a trivial item 
adds up to $90 per month, which is 14 percent of a $660 monthly 
house payment. When you’re living within a budget (as we suggest 
you do), every little bit counts.

 Chapter 2: Taking Stock of Your Situation 39
Suppose you have a negative amount or a very low amount for 
a house payment based on your current monthly income and 
expenses. What are your options? You basically have three:
 
✓ Increase your monthly income.
 
✓ Trim your monthly expenses.
 
✓ Increase your monthly income and trim your monthly 
expenses.
Short of getting another job in a hurry or convincing your partner 
to get another job, the solution requires trimming the fat from your 
budget, assuming you have some fat to trim. Review your budget 
closely, and identify categories in which you can realistically cut 
spending. Cut as much as you can, and then perform the calcula-
tion again to see how much of a house payment you can afford.

Chapter 3
Evaluating Your Options
In This Chapter
▶ Refinancing to lower your payment or consolidate debt
▶ Declaring bankruptcy
▶ Selling or abandoning your home
▶ Keeping track of ever-changing options
W
hen facing foreclosure, most homeowners think they have 
two options: pay up or move out. The fact is that you prob-
ably have about a dozen options — everything from refinancing to 
loan modification to selling your home or simply walking away and 
abandoning the property.
Although we recommend loan modification for most homeowners 
who qualify for it, we encourage you to consider all your options, 
so you can make a well-informed choice of what’s best for you and 
your family. In this chapter, we describe the most common fore-
closure alternatives available and present them in order from what 
experience tells us are generally the best options to the worst.
 
In this chapter, we merely introduce your options. This book 
focuses on loan modification solutions, so for more information 
about the other alternatives we mention in this chapter, check out 
Foreclosure Self-Defense For Dummies (Wiley).
Negotiating a Work-Out Solution 
with Your Lender
Contrary to what many homeowners believe, the bank probably 
doesn’t want to kick you out of your home. Why would it? Over the 
life of your loan, you’re probably going to at least double what you 
paid for the house in interest alone. In addition, if the bank fore-
closes, it stands to lose a lot of money — about $60,000 to $80,000 

Part I: Getting Up to Speed on Loan Modification  
42
by some estimates. If property values have dropped since you 
purchased the home, your lender probably can’t sell the home for 
enough to cover the balance on your mortgage.
As a result, lenders are typically motivated to work out a solution 
that enables you to stay in your home and keep making payments. 
In the midst of a foreclosure epidemic, they’re even more eager to 
strike a deal, as described in the following sections.
 
If you’ve had nothing but trouble with your current lender, refinanc-
ing may be at the top of your list of options. See “Refinancing Out of 
Trouble” later in this chapter for details.
Modifying your existing loan
If you have a steady income but not quite enough for you to catch 
up on missed payments and continue making the payments you’re 
paying now, a loan modification can be the perfect solution. You 
keep your home with a lower monthly payment. If you’ve missed 
several payments, the lender may add the payments to the end of 
the term or scratch them off the balance sheet (rare, but it happens).
Help your neighbors by helping yourself
Homeownership traditionally has been the foundation of the United States econ-
omy, so when foreclosure happens, everyone becomes a victim.
 ✓ Foreclosures reduce property values for everyone in the neighborhood.
 ✓ Lower property values lead to lower tax revenues for state, county, and local 
governments.
 ✓ Vacant homes attract vandals, vagrants, and other criminal types.
 ✓ Rising default rates convince lenders to tighten credit, making it more difficult 
and costly to borrow money.
 ✓ As families lose their homes, they have less money to spend on products and 
services, lowering demand and increasing unemployment.
 ✓ Foreclosures feed on foreclosures as the repercussions from one foreclosure 
ripple through the economy.
Don’t feel guilty or ashamed to ask for help. By helping yourself stay in your home 
with a loan modification, you’re helping your neighbors, too.

 Chapter 3: Evaluating Your Options 43
Throughout this book, we discuss loan modification in detail and 
show you what to do to pursue this option. To gain a general 
understanding of the concept and what it involves, see Chapter 1.
Reinstating the loan
As soon as your lender decides to move forward with foreclosure, 
it refuses to accept payments from you. This may seem a little odd, 
but if the lender were to accept payments, it could be setting a 
precedent that would compromise its ability to collect from you if 
you were to stop making payments again.
To get back on good terms with your lender, you may be able to 
reinstate the loan. This approach consists of paying the lender a 
lump sum that covers all missed and late payments along with any 
penalties and fees. You can then continue making your monthly 
payments as if nothing had ever happened.
Reinstating usually requires that you borrow the money from your 
rich uncle or some other well-to-do family member or friend (or 
have them gift it to you).
 
Consider this option only if you’ve recovered from a temporary 
financial setback and can realistically afford your monthly pay-
ments plus any payments you would owe to the person who 
loaned you the money to reinstate. Never agree to a solution that 
places you back on the path to defaulting on your loan.
 
Don’t have a rich relative? Think again — you may have a rich 
Uncle Sam. At the height of the foreclosure epidemic, Fannie 
Mae announced a program called HomeSaver Advance (HSA) 
that allows lenders to loan up to $15,000 to homeowners who’ve 
recovered from a temporary financial setback but are having 
trouble catching up on missed payments. With this program, you 
sign a separate promissory note for the amount needed to cover 
delinquent PITI (principal, interest, taxes, insurance) and other 
advances and fees, along with funds to cover up to six months in 
unpaid homeowner association (HOA) fees — 12 months if the fees 
are paid once a year.
Negotiating forbearance
Forbearance is any delay the lender agrees to in moving forward 
with collection activities, including foreclosure. Forbearance may 
include a period of no required payments (special forbearance) or 
be accompanied by some sort of installment plan for catching up 

Part I: Getting Up to Speed on Loan Modification  
44
on missed or late payments. Instead of paying the whole amount 
you owe in missed payments and penalties in one lump sum, you 
spread your payments over several months. If you’re $4,000 behind 
on payments, for example, the lender may let you pay about $667 
extra per month for six months until you’re all caught up.
 
Like the option of reinstating, forbearance is practical only for 
those who’ve recovered from a temporary financial setback and 
can now afford not only their original monthly payment but also a 
little (or sometimes a lot) extra each month.
Considering principal forbearance
Principal forbearance is sort of a “play now, pay later” option best 
suited to someone who’s upside down in his mortgage, meaning 
he owes more on his home than it’s worth. With principal forbear-
ance, the lender modifies the mortgage by calculating payments 
based on the amount the home is worth rather than on the balance 
of your mortgage, which lowers your monthly payment.
Suppose you took out a 30-year mortgage for $420,000 at 7 percent, 
and you’ve been making payments of about $2,790 per month for 
five years. You owe a balance of about $395,000. Unfortunately, due 
to declining property values, your home’s current market value is 
only about $300,000.
You and your lender work out a principal forbearance plan. The 
lender agrees to base your new payments on the market value of 
the home ($300,000 instead of the $395,000 you owe), drop your 
interest rate to 5 percent, and re-amortize the loan over 30 years 
(instead of the 25 years remaining on your current mortgage). This 
revision lowers your house payment to about $2,250 — a savings 
of over $500 per month.
What happened to that other $95,000? When you sell the home, 
hopefully at a higher price after the housing market recovers, you 
hand that money to your lender. Of course, if housing values fail to 
recover by the time you choose to sell your home, you’re still on 
the hook for that $95,000, unless your lender agrees to a short sale, 
which isn’t something you can count on.
For obvious reasons, the lender would prefer that you pay the 
money later rather than simply forgiving you a portion of the 
balance, as is sometimes done in loan modifications. If you can 
convince the lender to forgive a portion of the principal as part 
of your loan modification, a principal reduction would be a better 
deal than principal forbearance.

 Chapter 3: Evaluating Your Options 45
Refinancing Out of Trouble
Prior to the bursting of the housing bubble, when property values 
were soaring, refinancing was the option of choice for homeowners 
feeling the financial pinch. By refinancing, you use the equity in 
your home to bail yourself out.
When property values tanked, however, many homeowners found 
themselves with little, no, or even negative equity in their homes, 
which took the refinance option off the table. Lenders usually like 
to see a loan-to-value ratio (LTV) no higher than 95 percent. In 
other words, they don’t want to lend you more than 95 percent of 
the property’s true market value — $95,000 on a $100,000 home.
If you have a substantial amount of equity in your home, however, 
refinancing may be a realistic option for you, particularly if you can 
refinance into a fixed-rate mortgage with a lower interest rate than 
what you’re paying now. We recommend fixed-rate loans because 
they allow you to plan your finances without the worry of having 
those plans shattered by an unexpected rate increase.
 
Make sure your current mortgage doesn’t have a stiff prepay-
ment penalty. If it does, try negotiating with your lender to have 
it removed before you refinance with another lender. Also, make 
sure your new loan has a reasonable prepayment penalty that’s 
phased out over two to three years (or better yet, no prepayment 
penalty) and that the closing costs are reasonable. For more about 
shopping for mortgages, check out Mortgages For Dummies, 3rd 
Edition by Eric Tyson and Ray Brown, and Mortgage Myths by Ralph 
R. Roberts and Chip Cummings (both from Wiley).
In the following sections, we explore various ways to use the re-
financing option to your benefit.
Consolidating your debts
If you have plenty of equity in your home but are buried in high-
interest credit card debt, refinancing to consolidate debt is often 
the perfect solution. Consolidation consists of taking out one loan 
to pay off all or at least some of your outstanding balances, includ-
ing your current mortgage, any auto loans, credit card balances, 
and so on. The goal is to have a monthly payment that’s consider-
ably lower than your current monthly debt payments combined.
 
Be careful when consolidating debt. This strategy can become a 
recipe for disaster if, after paying off high-interest credit cards, you 
don’t stop using them and instead run the balances back up again.

Part I: Getting Up to Speed on Loan Modification  
46
To determine whether a consolidation can save you money, do the 
following:
 
1. Add up all your monthly debt payments — house, car, 
credit card bills, and so on. Don’t forget homeowners 
insurance and property taxes unless they’re included in 
your monthly mortgage payment. (You may already have 
totaled your debt payments in Chapter 2.)
 
2. Add up all your loan and credit card account balances. 
(You may have already totaled your debt balances in 
Chapter 2.)
 
3. Access your handy-dandy loan calculator, and enter the 
total from Step 2 as the loan amount. This is the total 
amount you would borrow to pay off all your loans and 
credit card balances, including your current mortgage.
 
 Loan calculators are available on the Web. (You can find 
several excellent ones at www.bankrate.com.) If you have 
a personal finance program, such as Quicken, it should 
have a loan calculator.
 
4. Enter the going interest rate for a 30-year mortgage.
 
 You can find the rates in most newspapers or online, such 
as at www.bankrate.com.
 
5. Click the button, if necessary, to complete the calculations.
If the monthly payment for the consolidation loan isn’t significantly 
lower than the total you’re currently paying on your loans (from 
Step 1) and what you would consider to be in an affordable range, 
refinancing alone probably isn’t a viable alternative for you. A 
short re-fi, discussed in the later section “Doing a short re-fi,” may 
still be a possibility, however.
 
Debt consolidation almost always transforms unsecured debt 
(including credit card debt) into secured debt, which is secured 
by some sort of collateral, such as a car or a home. If you have 
substantial unsecured debt, consult a bankruptcy attorney prior 
to considering debt consolidation, as explained later in this chap-
ter in the section “Playing the Bankruptcy Card.” Bankruptcy 
helps erase the unsecured debt more easily than the secured 
debt, so you don’t want to transform unsecured debt into 
secured debt if there’s even a remote possibility you may file for 
bankruptcy later.

 Chapter 3: Evaluating Your Options 47
Refinancing the old-fashioned way
A plain and simple refinance merely provides you with an opportu-
nity to lower your interest rate, which usually results in lowering 
your monthly payment. For example, monthly principal and interest 
payments on a $200,000 30-year mortgage at 8 percent are $1,467.53. 
At 7 percent, they drop to $1,330.60. At 6 percent, they drop to 
$1,199.10.
To determine whether refinancing your current mortgage can 
make your monthly payments affordable, use any Web-based loan 
calculator to do the math. You can find several financial calcula-
tors, including a loan calculator, at www.bankrate.com.
If refinancing sounds appealing to you, meet with a reputable mort-
gage broker to discuss your options and crunch the numbers. A 
mortgage broker can quickly determine whether you’re likely to 
qualify for a refinance loan. If you’re not likely to qualify, knowing 
this early allows you to scratch the option off your list.
 
If refinancing into a lower rate requires you to pay huge amounts 
in closing costs and fees out-of-pocket, it may not be worth it. Sure 
you’ll save thousands in interest over the life of the loan, but the 
re-fi should be designed to offer immediate payment relief, as well. 
Weigh the costs and comparison shop carefully.
Doing a short re-fi
A short re-fi is sort of a cross between a refinance and a short sale, 
discussed later in this chapter in the section “Selling to break even 
with a short sale.” Your lender agrees to accept as payment in full 
less than is required to pay off the balance due on the mortgage, 
and you take out a refinance loan to make that payment in full.
The end result is that you have a new mortgage with a lower bal-
ance and lower monthly payments, while your original lender cuts 
its losses and moves on. Some lenders may even be willing to short 
re-fi their own loans, knowing that over the life of the loans they’ll 
recapture any amount they discounted upfront.
The short re-fi option is often a practical solution if you want to 
refinance but you can’t qualify for a new loan because you cur-
rently owe more on your home than it’s worth. By agreeing to for-
give a portion of the principal due, your lender can bring the LTV 
into a range that enables you to qualify for a new loan.

Part I: Getting Up to Speed on Loan Modification  
48
 
When considering a short re-fi, make absolutely sure the agree-
ment frees you from paying the deficiency, which is the difference 
between the original loan balance and the new balance. Have your 
family attorney review the paperwork before you close. If you 
don’t consult an attorney, at least find out what the lender’s inten-
tions are regarding the deficiency and your liability. Also, ask your 
attorney or accountant about any tax ramifications from having 
the deficiency forgiven. The Mortgage Forgiveness Debt Relief Act 
of 2007 “generally allows taxpayers to exclude income from the 
discharge of debt on their principal residence” for the years 2007 
to 2012, but certain exclusions may apply.
Playing the Bankruptcy Card
Declaring bankruptcy is like driving a tank onto a battlefield where 
everyone else is waging war with peashooters. It’s the big gun you 
draw when you’re buried so deep in debt that you can’t possibly 
claw your way out. Bankruptcy gives you a second chance by 
allowing you to start over.
Although several types (or chapters) of bankruptcy are available, 
each with its own benefits and drawbacks, Chapter 7 and Chapter 
13 are the most common for consumers.
 
✓ Chapter 7, Liquidation: You sell assets, pay back as much as 
you can afford to with the proceeds, and walk away debt-free. 
A little known fact is that in 90 percent of Chapter 7 bankrupt-
cies, the debtors keep all their property because it’s pro-
tected by exemptions.
 
✓ Chapter 13, Restructuring debt: You work out a payment 
plan with the bankruptcy judge that enables you to repay all 
or most of your debt to your creditors.
This isn’t a book on bankruptcy, so we merely introduce it as an 
option to consider. For details, check out Personal Bankruptcy Laws 
For Dummies, 2nd Edition, by James P. Caher and John M. Caher 
(Wiley), and consult a reputable bankruptcy attorney in your area.
 
When you file for bankruptcy, your lender is likely to shut down 
communications with you out of fear of being found in violation of 
the automatic stay prohibiting the lender from pursuing any collec-
tion activities. You may need to first reaffirm the debt (agree to pay 
back the loan) before the lender will negotiate with you, but don’t 
reaffirm without your attorney’s approval. Legislators have con-
sidered a cram-down provision that would give bankruptcy judges 
in a Chapter 13 bankruptcy the power to order lenders to modify 
unpaid principal balances of the debtors’ mortgage loans, but at 
the time of this writing, the legislation hasn’t been passed.

Getting Out from Under It: 
Selling Your Home
When property values were on the rise, we often advised home-
owners facing foreclosure to sell their homes. In fact, in about 90 
percent of the foreclosure cases we handled, selling the home was 
the best option. Selling enabled the owners to get out from under 
homes they really couldn’t afford, cash out any equity in their 
homes, and move to more affordable accommodations.
As property values decline, the sell-your-home solution becomes 
viable for fewer and fewer homeowners. They’re usually facing the 
prospect of selling at a loss, and that’s not something we recom-
mend. In the following sections, we describe various strategies for 
selling your home quickly and at least breaking even.
 
If you’re facing the prospect of selling at a loss, explore other 
options first or at least look into a short sale, as discussed in 
“Selling to break even with a short sale.”
Selling for a profit: Do’s and don’ts
Listing and selling your home in the face of foreclosure is a whole 
’nother ball game compared to listing and selling your home under 
normal circumstances. Time is not on your side. Following are 
some tips for selling your home quickly for as much money as pos-
sible in a down market:
 
✓ Mum’s the word. If word gets out that you don’t have a choice 
but to sell, buyers can use this nugget of knowledge as lever-
age to negotiate a lower price.
 
✓ Hire a Realtor. Don’t settle for a run-of-the-mill real estate 
agent. A Realtor, a member of the National Association of 
Realtors (NAR), has additional training and is required to 
uphold a strict code of ethics.
 
✓ Hire the best. The agent who has the most SOLD signs around 
the neighborhood is usually the best choice.
 
✓ Tell your agent about your situation. Being upfront enables 
your agent to employ strategies for selling your home quickly.
 
✓ Price it right the first time. Consult with your agent to set 
an attractive asking price, which is likely to be less than you 
think it should be. A lower asking price attracts more poten-
tial buyers, which may drive up offers or even initiate a bid-
ding war, and can make the home sell much faster.

✓ Choose an agent who markets on the Web. Your home 
should be marketed on at least eight Web sites, including 
www.backpage.com and www.craigslist.com.
 
✓ Stay put until it sells (if possible). A vacant home is harder to 
sell than an occupied one. Most buyers have limited vision, so 
having rooms laid out and furnished helps potential buyers see 
your house as a home and often brings a higher sales price.
 
✓ Stage your home. Staging transforms a house into a showcase 
home that typically commands a higher price and sells faster. 
Check out Home Staging For Dummies by Christine Rae and 
Janice Saunders Maresh (Wiley).
 
✓ Be prepared for potential buyers at all times. Make sure 
your home is ready to show every day, and let your agent 
know that prospective buyers are welcome any time (without 
having to give 24-hour advance notice).
 
✓ Let the light in. Prior to the showing, open all the curtains 
and shades to let the light in, turn on all the lights, and vacate 
the premises.
 
✓ Appeal to the senses. Prior to a showing, bake some cookies, 
set out a couple of vases of fresh-cut flowers, open the win-
dows (if the weather is nice), or brew a fresh pot of coffee, but 
avoid scented candles and heavy air fresheners. Play some 
soothing background music during the showing.
Selling to break even 
with a short sale
Selling at a loss as your first option is for chumps, and it’s usually 
unnecessary. If none of the other options discussed in this chapter 
is any better, or if you simply want to sell or have to sell for other 
reasons, selling is okay, but do everything in your power not to sell 
at a loss.
One very popular option is to negotiate a short sale with your lender; 
it’s a deal in which the lender accepts an amount, as payment in 
full, that’s less than the balance currently due on your mortgage. 
For example, suppose you owe $200,000 on your mortgage but can 
sell the house only for $180,000. With a short sale, the lender would 
agree to accept that $180,000 as full payment and let you off the 
hook for the other $20,000.
 
When negotiating a short sale, be careful about two potential 
drawbacks:

 Chapter 3: Evaluating Your Options 51
 
✓ Deficiency judgment: Have your attorney review the paper-
work before you sign it to make sure that the lender has no 
recourse to collect the cancelled debt, called the deficiency.
 
✓ Taxes on cancelled debt: The government has tradition-
ally taxed cancelled debt. During the foreclosure epidemic, 
Congress passed legislation to temporarily lift taxes on can-
celled debt for the sale of a primary residence, but this legisla-
tion may expire by the time you read this or it may not apply 
to your situation. Check with a reliable accountant or tax 
attorney to be sure.
Selling quickly to an investor
Real estate investors often have money when other people don’t, 
so they’re in a better position to purchase properties. In addition, 
they usually either have cash or readily accessible financing, so 
they don’t have to wait for a loan approval. As a result, you may be 
able to sell your home to an investor more quickly than through 
normal channels. (The next section offers some advice on finding 
real estate investors.)
 
Even reputable real estate investors are focused on maximizing 
their profits, so selling to an investor may not be your best option. 
You may be better off working out a solution with your lender that 
allows you to stay in your home until property values recover (if 
and when is anyone’s guess) and then selling it. If you need to move 
in a hurry, however, selling to an investor is certainly an option.
Teaming Up with an Investor 
to Stay in Your Home
Real estate investors typically swoop in to purchase properties 
at a bargain with the expectation that the previous owners vacate 
the premises as soon as possible, but this isn’t always the case. 
Sometimes, investors are willing to team up with homeowners to 
help them keep their homes — either permanently or temporarily. 
In the following sections, we discuss these two options.
 
You can usually find reputable investors through reputable real 
estate agents, attorneys (especially foreclosure and bankruptcy 
attorneys), and perhaps even local banks. If you’re really in a bind, 
you can try calling one of those numbers on the We Buy Homes 
ads, but be sure to run the name of the person past your attorney 

Part I: Getting Up to Speed on Loan Modification  
52
or real estate agent first. Be extra careful about anyone who con-
tacts you before you contact them, especially the nicest ones who 
want to “help” you; they’re more likely to be con artists wanting to 
help themselves to your money.
 
Never deed your property away to a third party as part of a so-
called foreclosure rescue. These are usually scams in which the 
third party claims to be able to save your home for you. They 
claim that all you have to do is deed the property to them, and 
they’ll pay off the underlying mortgage. In most cases, they just 
collect some money from you and have no intention of paying off 
the mortgage. Have your attorney review any and all documents 
before you sign.
Selling your home and 
buying it back
Assuming you’ve been a good steward to your home, an investor 
may be willing to purchase it at the foreclosure auction and then 
sell it back to you on contract. You can buy back a home using 
either of the following contracts:
 
✓ Contract for deed or other seller financing vehicles: With 
a contract for deed, the seller (in this case, the investor who 
purchased your property and is selling it back to you) acts as 
the bank. Instead of using a mortgage to secure interest in the 
property, the seller/lender retains possession of the property 
until the buyer fulfills the terms of the contract.
 
✓ Lease option agreement: With a lease option, you rent the 
property for a time (usually no more than about two years), 
at the end of which you have the option but not the obligation 
to purchase the property. This arrangement usually gives you 
some time to improve your credit rating so you can afford a 
conventional mortgage to finance the purchase of the property.
Buying the property back on either type of contract is usually 
an option if you have some equity in the property and run out of 
other options; for example, your lender won’t modify your loan, 
you don’t have enough time to sell it, and you can’t qualify for 
refinancing.
 
Work only with reputable investors in your area, and have your 
attorney review all the paperwork and explain it to you until you 
fully understand everything in the contract before signing it. Most 
land contracts and lease option agreements contain a forfeiture 
clause that could prevent you from purchasing the property unless 
you meet all the conditions specified. You want to make sure that 
those conditions are reasonable before you agree to them.

 Chapter 3: Evaluating Your Options 53
Another potential problem you need to be aware of is that under 
certain circumstances, any liens against the property at the time of 
foreclosure could reattach to it when you buy it back, making you 
again responsible for paying off the lien holders. To prevent this 
from occurring, the investor must negotiate with the junior lien 
holders to release their liens.
 
To make sure the junior liens are erased, have a title company 
handle the closing and insure the title at the time of purchase with 
the understanding that a foreclosure has taken place. Another 
option is to ask the investor to contact junior lien holders prior to 
expiration of the sheriff’s deed or even before foreclosing and offer 
a nominal payment in return for a discharge of their liens. The 
recorded discharges should satisfy any concerns.
Selling your home and 
renting it back
Bad stuff always seems to happen at the worst times, and fore-
closure is no different. Maybe your kids are still in school, or 
you found a new job in another state but it doesn’t start for two 
months and you need a place to stay until then. In situations like 
these, selling to an investor and then renting the property for a 
short time can be a very attractive solution. Simply put, you sell 
your home now and move when it’s convenient for you.
As long as you haven’t trashed the premises, an investor may 
be willing to go along with a deal. After all, it prevents him from 
having to line up tenants right away.
Ditching the Property
If, as Shakespeare wrote, all the world’s a stage, then maybe you 
can exit stage left and leave all your problems in your past, includ-
ing that ball and chain you’ve called a home. Although this is cer-
tainly an option, some ways of vacating the premises are better 
than others, as we reveal in the following sections.
Exchanging a deed in lieu 
of foreclosure
For homeowners who are unable to make mortgage payments 
(even significantly lower payments) and can’t sell the property and 
at least break even on the sale, the lender may accept the deed 

Part I: Getting Up to Speed on Loan Modification  
54
in lieu of foreclosure. You sign your property rights over to your 
lender, vacate by an agreed-upon date, and your lender cancels 
your debt.
 
If you choose this option, hire an attorney to review the paperwork 
before you sign anything. You want a deal that lets you walk away 
totally debt-free and prohibits the lender from pursuing a defi-
ciency judgment.
In some cases, the lender may be willing to pay you a small amount 
in exchange for keys and leaving the property “broom clean,” 
which means you can move to more affordable housing. A varia-
tion on this cash-for-keys deal is a time-for-keys deal, in which the 
lender allows you to remain on the premises for some additional 
time (rent-free or rent-lite) to have someone look after the place 
and make it look lived in, which usually helps the property sell 
faster and for more money.
Living rent-free through redemption
You considered all your options and resigned yourself to the fact 
that you can’t save your home, or maybe you’re just not willing to 
do what it would take to save it. That’s okay, but don’t be in such 
a big hurry to move out. A little procrastination may get you back 
on your feet, especially if you live in a state that has a lengthy 
redemption period.
Here’s how this strategy works: Your lender can’t have you evicted 
until after the foreclosure sale and after the redemption period. 
In states like Michigan, that period can be as long as 6 months in 
most cases and 12 months in others. This means you can live in 
the property rent-free until your redemption period expires. Save 
up all that money, and you’ll be in a much better financial position 
to move on with your life later.
 
In states with redemption periods, particularly lengthy redemption 
periods, unethical or ill-informed investors often try to intimidate 
or trick homeowners into moving out before the law requires. 
Don’t fall for it. Call your county register of deeds or a local fore-
closure attorney and ask for an explanation of your redemption 
rights. If you move out voluntarily or abandon the house, even if 
you’re tricked into doing so, you may compromise or relinquish 
your rights.
 
If you’re facing a deficiency judgment, as discussed in the previous 
section, you may be able to trade your redemption rights for a 
discharge of the deficiency. Discuss this option with your attorney. 

 Chapter 3: Evaluating Your Options 55
You may need to move out earlier than planned, but you can move 
without that debt following you.
Abandoning the property
Some homeowners become so discouraged that they don’t even 
consider working out a solution with their lenders. They simply 
cram as many valuables as will fit into the family van and drive off 
to greener pastures, leaving the debt, the house, and the problems 
to someone else to sort out.
 
Although abandoning ship is certainly an option, it’s not always a 
good option because it can leave legal strings untied. In some juris-
dictions, for example, the lender can sell the house at auction and 
then pursue a deficiency judgment against you for the difference 
between what the house sold for and the balance of the mortgage. 
In addition, abandoning your home can leave a blemish on your 
credit history that follows you for many years, and it’s certainly 
not a neighborly thing to do.
Redeeming the Property 
Post-Auction
Many states give homeowners one last chance to save their homes 
from foreclosure through redemption. With redemption, you have 
the right to buy back the property from the investor or the bank 
that purchased it at the auction sale. To redeem your property, 
you need to pay the investor or the bank the full amount paid for 
the property at auction, plus any qualifying expenses.
Jingle mail
In the months following the worst of the financial crisis, many frustrated homeown-
ers simply mailed their house keys back to their lenders. The phenomena spawned 
a cute but unfunny abandonment term known as jingle mail because of the sound 
that keys made inside envelopes mailed to lenders.
In many cases homeowners had better options, but some didn’t know where to turn 
and became so frustrated with their lenders that they just threw up their hands, 
dropped the keys in the mail, and walked away. Obviously, this isn’t something we 
recommend.

Part I: Getting Up to Speed on Loan Modification  
56
 
Don’t redeem the property unless you truly can afford to make 
payments on any loan you can secure to redeem the property. 
Otherwise, you’re likely to find yourself facing foreclosure again 
really soon.
The sheriff in charge of foreclosure sales in your area or the public 
land recorder (register of deeds) can tell you the amount you need 
to redeem the property and the person you need to pay, or they 
can direct you to the right person for more information. When you 
know the amount and who you owe, you can head down with a cer-
tified check to pay the amount in full.
State redemption rules vary. To make sure you comply with them, 
contact your county deeds office, the county courthouse, your 
state attorney general (see Appendix A for contact information), 
or a foreclosure attorney in your area. Don’t leave this to the last 
minute. Look into the procedure early so you know your rights 
and responsibilities. Spending some time educating yourself on 
the foreclosure process in your state (that includes redemption 
requirements) can keep you from being taken advantage of later by 
unscrupulous individuals looking to con you out of your house.
Doing Nothing — 
A Terrible Choice
One of the worst options (second only to falling victim to a fore-
closure rescue scam) is to do nothing, in which case you lose your 
home along with any equity you may have had in it and then suffer 
the humiliation of being evicted.
Unfortunately, this is the option that some homeowners choose. 
They try to sweep the problem under the rug. Even worse, they try 
to hide the bad news from their partners. Too often, they succeed 
for a time, but the partners always find out — usually when it’s too 
late to do anything about it.
 
Don’t be clueless. If you own your home with your significant 
other, set aside some time every week (or at least once a month) 
to review your finances and pay the bills together. We’ve wit-
nessed several instances in which the partner who was supposed 
to be paying the bills wasn’t and kept the other in the dark when 
the default notices arrived. Working together, you can hold one 
another accountable.
If you’re single and have no dependants, you’re free to go down the 
path of inaction, but if others, especially children, depend on you, 
doing nothing is truly not an option. We haven’t seen any studies 

 Chapter 3: Evaluating Your Options 57
that measure the effect of a full-blown eviction on the mental 
health of a child, but one could guess that the memory of such an 
event would be slow to fade and maybe never entirely forgotten.
 
The sooner you take action, the more options you have and the 
more time you have to explore those options. Ignoring the problem 
won’t make it go away. It will only make it worse.
Keeping an Eye Open for 
Brand-New Options
Although we made every effort in this chapter to cover all the 
alternatives to foreclosure, we’ve probably left a couple out — not 
through any fault of our own but simply because new options are 
constantly popping up as government agencies, consumer advo-
cacy groups, and lenders search for ways to save homeowners 
from foreclosure.
To find out about new programs and options, follow these recom-
mendations to do some additional research:
 
✓ Contact your lender and ask about any special programs it’s 
offering to help distressed homeowners. You may be able to 
find this information online. Refer to Appendix A for a list of 
lender Web sites and phone numbers.
 
✓ Visit the HUD Web site, www.hud.gov, to find announce-
ments about government-sponsored programs. HUD is the 
U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.
 
✓ Visit the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Financial 
Stability Web site, www.financialstability.gov, where 
you can find additional information about homeowner relief 
programs sponsored by the federal government. This site 
also contains a link to the Making Home Affordable Web site 
at www.makinghomeaffordable.gov.
 
✓ Visit the Fannie Mae Web site, www.fanniemae.com, to 
see if Fannie Mae is offering any new homeowner relief 
programs, or ask your mortgage broker to look into it.
 
✓ Contact your state attorney general’s office (see Appendix 
A for contact information). The AG’s office sometimes knows 
where struggling homeowners can turn for help. A recent 
example is when the attorney general of California sued a 
lender for predatory lending and fraudulent lending activity. 
As part of the nationwide settlement, the lender agreed to 
modify loans for homeowners.

✓ Contact HOPE NOW by calling 1-888-995-HOPE (4673) or 
visiting www.hopenow.com. HOPE NOW is an alliance 
between HUD-approved counseling agents, servicers, inves-
tors, and other mortgage market participants that provides 
free foreclosure prevention assistance.
Remaining open to alternatives
In the early days of the mortgage meltdown, lenders tended to be less receptive 
to requests for loan modifications and often led distressed homeowners to believe 
that they had only two options: pay up or move out. I (Ralph) met a couple who were 
on the receiving end of such misleading messages from their lender. All the phone 
conversations and correspondence they exchanged with their lender had the same 
underlying theme: pay up or move out.
When I met with the couple, I advised them to put a slightly different spin on the 
message. Perhaps what the lender was really saying was, “Start paying again with 
a lower, modified payment, or move.” And this is exactly what we sought to accom-
plish through a loan modification.
This couple was a textbook case of a hardship-triggered default. The wife had 
contracted a serious medical condition resulting in huge medical bills, and the 
downturn in the economy had landed a second blow to their household income. 
Still, the couple was committed to keeping their home, if they could afford it.
Together, we waded through the lender’s loan modification requirements and 
submitted an application. A couple of weeks later, the lender made its initial offer, 
reducing the couple’s monthly mortgage payment, but not to a level the couple 
felt confident they could afford paying. They requested a better deal with a more 
affordable house payment, but the lender wouldn’t budge.
After wrestling with the decision of whether to sign the agreement, the couple, 
overwhelmed with medical bills and other debt, rejected the lender’s offer. Knowing 
rejection would result in an inevitable foreclosure, the couple braced for the worst, 
continued exploring other options, and eventually decided to declare bankruptcy.
Through bankruptcy, they were able to give themselves a fresh start. The bank-
ruptcy erased their medical bills and other unsecured debt, freeing up hundreds 
of dollars a month. The couple did lose their home, but with the drop in property 
values, they were able to purchase a much more affordable home — a new home 
for their new life.
Keep in mind that loan modification isn’t always the best option, and it’s really not 
an option if you can’t modify to true affordability. Explore all your options, even 
those you may not want to consider, such as bankruptcy.

Deciding Whether to Team 
Up with a Pro or Fly Solo

Y
ou’ve probably heard the expression that a person who 
represents himself in court has a fool for a client. This often 
applies to loan modification, too. Although you may be able to 
achieve some level of success by dealing directly with a reputable 
and cooperative lender, you can save time, effort, and anguish by 
hiring a professional to protect your interests. Having professional 
representation is even more important when the lender is inacces-
sible or unwilling to work out a solution.
In this chapter, we examine the pros and cons of hiring a loan mod-
ification expert, show you what to expect from such an expert and 
how to choose the right company or individual, and suggest ways 
you can team up with the expert to secure the best deal possible 
from your lender.
Weighing the Pros and Cons 
of Hiring a Professional
If you type “loan modification” into a search engine, you’re going to 
get conflicting advice. Loan modification companies tell you to hire 
a professional. People hawking do-it-yourself loan modification kits 
and books (like this one?!) encourage you to do it yourself. Lenders 
encourage homeowners to “call us,” because they don’t want to 
have to deal with an attorney who may gum up the works.

Part I: Getting Up to Speed on Loan Modification  
60
We think most homeowners are better off hiring professionals to 
represent their interests. Although I (Ralph) tell people they can 
do it themselves (with the assistance of this book, of course), I also 
advise them that their interests may be better protected by work-
ing through a qualified and experienced third-party representative. 
In the following sections, you begin to understand why.
Examining the pros
Most people don’t hesitate to call a professional when they need 
to borrow money, buy a home, plan for their retirement, or even 
fix a leaky faucet. When considering a loan modification, however, 
they assume they can negotiate a good deal with their lender on 
their own. This is certainly understandable. After all, lenders are 
experts, and if they truly want a long-term solution, they should be 
willing to arrange a deal that works for both parties.
Hire a pro or give up?
Many times, the choice isn’t whether to hire a pro or fly solo but rather whether to 
hire a pro or give up. We worked with a couple who chose to hire a professional 
rather than give up their quest for a loan modification. They’d struggled for months 
to convince their lender to work with them on a loan modification. The lender was 
habitually difficult to contact, and when the couple finally got through, the lender 
routed them through a complex maze of departments that ultimately left them at a 
dead end. Instead of giving up, this couple contacted us.
Initially, the lender forced us to jump through the same hoops, but fortunately, we 
had experience on our side. Having developed a few tricks of our own for moving 
past the gatekeepers, we knew which questions to ask, which answers to give, 
which department to request, and whom we needed to speak with to get something 
accomplished.
Quickly, we discovered exactly what the lender required. We assisted the bor-
rowers in gathering the information and documentation needed to complete and 
submit the paperwork. We gave the couple a timeline, so they knew when the 
lender would be likely to present an offer, which greatly reduced their anxiety over 
having to wait. We also informed them that the lender’s first offer usually isn’t its 
best offer, so they should expect further negotiations.
When the lender finally presented its offer, we were able to sit down with the 
couple and decide whether the monthly payment was truly affordable based on 
their budget. We then negotiated on the couple’s behalf to obtain a truly affordable 
monthly payment.
When the going gets tough, the tough persist . . . or hire professionals who are likely 
equipped with the experience and resources to succeed.

 Chapter 4: Deciding Whether to Team Up with a Pro or Fly Solo 61
The trouble is that lenders tend to protect their own interests. They 
have to earn a profit, and they expect people who borrowed from 
them to honor the terms of their original agreement. As a result, 
lenders often reject loan modification applications because they 
believe the borrowers can afford their payments or could afford to 
make their payments if they would only budget more carefully.
 
Hiring a qualified professional ensures that you have someone 
looking out for your interests. Following are additional reasons you 
should at least consider hiring a loan expert to represent you.
Assistance in evaluating all your options
Although a loan modification is the best option for most home-
owners facing foreclosure, it’s not the best option in every case. 
Filing for bankruptcy, refinancing with another lender, or selling 
your home may be more advantageous, as explained in Chapter 3. 
An expert can help you analyze your situation and explore other 
options. If your lender doesn’t approve your request for a loan 
modification, the expert can often refer you to an expert who can 
assist you in pursuing another option.
Increased chance of getting your application approved
You may have only one shot at submitting your loan modification 
application correctly. The high demand for loan modifications has 
made lenders very selective in which applications they accept and 
ultimately approve. An expert who’s familiar with the ins and outs 
of the system can ensure that you submit a complete and correct 
loan application that puts your best foot forward.
 
An ethical loan modification expert won’t falsify or alter 
documentation — and neither should you — but an expert can 
give you an advantage by presenting the facts in a way that puts 
your case in a more favorable light.
Experience working with lenders
An experienced professional who knows all the right things to say 
and the right programs to ask for has a distinct advantage. Lenders 
are swamped with callers seeking loan modifications who don’t 
really know what they want or how to ask for it. When a lender’s 
representative picks up the phone and realizes that she’s dealing 
with a professional who knows the language, she can cut to the 
chase without having to educate the caller.
 
For every one of you, 5,000 more distressed homeowners are wait-
ing on hold. An experienced expert can make the lender’s job much 
easier, improving your chances of gaining a more favorable out-
come. (If your lender is participating in a government-sponsored 
home retention program, it must adhere to the government’s 

Part I: Getting Up to Speed on Loan Modification  
62
established guidelines, in which case a third party can offer you no 
advantage in this respect.)
Able to take the loan modification hassles off your plate
Unless you’re out of work (in which case you’re unlikely to qualify 
for a loan modification anyway) and have all day to spend on the 
phone with your lender, you probably won’t have the time to get it 
done. Some lenders haven’t adjusted their hours beyond the 8-to-5 
workday. (Don’t forget the time-zone issue, too.) If you’re work-
ing and struggling to make your monthly payments, you probably 
can’t afford a day off work to haggle with your lender. A profes-
sional who does this for a living makes the time.
 
Hiring a pro doesn’t mean that your job is done. You still have 
to gather documents and complete some forms (see Chapter 6), 
explain the situation to your representative, assist in writing the 
hardship letter and your financial statement (see Chapter 8), and 
perhaps meet with the lender for a homeowner interview (see 
Chapter 10). After you’ve done all that, the loan modification expert 
handles the rest, but be prepared to pitch in when called upon to 
do so (see “Teaming Up with Your Representative” for details).
 
If the lender calls you directly to discuss material matters that 
could affect the success (or failure) of your modification, be care-
ful what you say. Gather as much information as you can about 
what the lender is asking you to do and then politely explain that 
you will discuss all these matters with your representative. Of 
course, don’t forget to make a notation in the phone-conversation 
log you’re keeping (see Chapter 9).
Freedom from emotional baggage
Anyone who negotiates for a living can tell you that you need to 
leave your emotions at the door. However, most homeowners 
aren’t equipped to remain calm, cool, and collected when facing 
the prospect of losing a home.
Emotions can undermine your efforts in two ways. They can 
cloud your judgment, leading to poor decisions, and they can 
make you angry, leading to arguments. Irrational homeowners 
tend to get “accidentally” disconnected when they call their 
lenders. A professional can address issues matter-of-factly, so 
the lender’s representative is more likely to cooperate.
Analyzing the cons
Hiring a skilled professional almost always delivers better results 
than trying to get your loan modified yourself. Think back to the 
last do-it-yourself home-improvement project you tackled. You 

 Chapter 4: Deciding Whether to Team Up with a Pro or Fly Solo 63
probably saved some money, but the project consumed more of 
your time and may not have turned out quite as well as if you had 
hired a skilled contractor. Yet, hiring a loan modification expert has 
some potential drawbacks, as discussed in the following sections.
Cost
The biggest drawback is cost: Professionals may charge thou-
sands of dollars, especially some of the better attorney-based 
services that charge retainers. When you’re already strapped for 
cash, coming up with a few thousand bucks is no small feat. (We 
offer some tips for pulling the money together in the later section 
“Scraping Together Money for Upfront Fees.”)
 
A good loan modification service often pays for itself in the amount 
of money it saves you over the life of the loan. If the expert can 
negotiate a payment that’s a modest $100 less per month than you 
could negotiate on your own, that represents $1,200 per year or 
$36,000 over the life of a 30-year mortgage. In addition, the repre-
sentative can often steer you clear of other legal pitfalls that could 
really cause you headaches down the road.
No guarantee of a successful loan modification
A loan modification service can offer a money-back guarantee, 
but it can’t promise to successfully negotiate a loan modification 
on your behalf. The ultimate decision to modify or not falls to the 
lender; if it’s not willing to modify, you can do little to force its 
hand (unless proof of fraud or significant regulatory violations 
is evident in the loan origination or processing, as discussed in 
Chapters 13 and 14). Some companies will return a portion of your 
fee if they can’t secure an affordable loan modification.
Personality test: Can you 
take the backseat?
A professional keeps you one step removed from the action, which can be good or 
bad depending on your situation and personality.
If you’re the kind of person who needs to know exactly what’s going on, who said 
what, how they said it, and so on, being removed from the action can cause a lot 
of anxiety. On the other hand, if you prefer having someone else handle all the 
details and navigate the bumps in the road, you’ll appreciate having a pro attend to 
the details. (Even if you hire a professional to represent you, keep close contact to 
ensure progress is being made.)

Part I: Getting Up to Speed on Loan Modification

A money-back guarantee doesn’t automatically mean that the 
company is reputable. Con artists often prey on people who can 
least afford to be scammed. Although falling victim to a con artist 
is always possible, you can significantly decrease your odds of 
becoming a victim by choosing a reputable service (see “Choosing 
the Right Individual or Company” later in this chapter for details).
Identifying Professionals 
Who Can Assist You
The increasing demand for loan modifications has attracted the 
attention of skilled and knowledgeable professionals in various 
fields. Some of these professionals have seen their incomes drop as 
a result of the recession and are looking for other ways to put their 
skills to good use to make up for lost income. Others are genuinely 
committed to helping homeowners and earn a fair profit doing so.
Some of these professionals are more qualified than others to 
negotiate loan modifications. In the following sections, we describe 
professionals who are likely to have the knowledge and skills 
required, and we provide some guidance about which are likely to 
be the most qualified as a group.
 
Although we can provide some general guidelines that rate 
particular groups, we can’t offer advice on choosing a particular 
individual. Every profession has its share of standouts and hacks, 
so you must judge each person on his or her own merits, experi-
ence, and reputation.
Loan modification attorney
Admittedly, “loan modification attorney” is a bit of a made-up title. 
Nobody goes to law school to become a loan modification attorney. 
This term merely describes attorneys currently focusing on getting 
loan modifications for their clients. Even if it’s not what they do 
all day long, they have experience providing this service to their 
clients. A loan modification attorney is usually the best choice 
because she
 
✓ Carries more weight than a layperson in terms of credibility 
and legal clout. Lenders tend to listen more carefully and 
respond more quickly when contacted by an attorney.
 
✓ Knows the laws that the lender must adhere to and can use 
those laws as leverage to persuade the lender to negotiate 
and offer you a more attractive deal.

 Chapter 4: Deciding Whether to Team Up with a Pro or Fly Solo 65
 
✓ Is answerable to the Bar Association in the state in which she 
operates. This provides you with consumer protection.
 
✓ Is well connected with lenders. Especially if all an attorney 
does all day is loan modifications, she quickly identifies the 
strategies that work with specific lenders.
Foreclosure attorney
A foreclosure attorney (the type that represents borrowers, not 
lenders) is a pretty good choice. These folks have plenty of experi-
ence working with lenders and should be well aware of all the fore-
closure alternatives available to you (see Chapter 3).
A foreclosure attorney is also better equipped than most attorneys 
and other professionals listed in this section to identify incidents 
in which the lender failed to adhere to a foreclosure rule or regula-
tion; for example, she knows that a lender is in violation when it 
has posted the foreclosure notice for only four weeks when your 
state law requires that it be posted for five weeks. This may seem 
like a small point, but a foreclosure attorney can use this kind 
of error to stop a foreclosure in its tracks, buy you several extra 
weeks or months to pursue other options, and perhaps even nego-
tiate an attractive loan modification with your lender.
Bankruptcy attorney
If you’re buried in unsecured debt, such as credit card debt, a 
bankruptcy attorney may be the absolute best choice for you. 
Bankruptcy can often discharge the unsecured debt. In addition, 
in bankruptcy, certain assets are shielded from your creditors 
through exemptions. State exemptions vary a great deal from state 
to state, so a bankruptcy attorney can explain which assets are 
exempt, whether bankruptcy would be better than a loan modi-
fication, and whether bankruptcy with a loan modification is an 
option.
 
One potential problem with choosing a bankruptcy attorney is that 
the person may be more likely to recommend bankruptcy than 
other solutions that may be better for you or that you would prefer 
if you knew all your options.
Real estate attorney
Real estate attorneys tend to be more general-purpose legal eagles 
than bankruptcy or foreclosure attorneys. They deal primarily with 
agreements between buyers and sellers and disagreements over 

Part I: Getting Up to Speed on Loan Modification  
66
property lines and other real estate-related issues. A good real 
estate attorney, however, should be well qualified to negotiate a 
loan modification with your lender.
 
Ask the attorney about her experience in negotiating loan modi-
fications. If she’s done only one or two, you may want to look for 
someone who’s had more time behind the wheel. Consider looking 
for a referral to an attorney who has successfully helped someone 
you know through a similar situation.
Credit counselor
The primary job of a credit counselor is to assist consumers in 
getting their financial houses in order primarily by slashing dis-
cretionary spending. Early in the process, however, a good credit 
counselor examines all your outstanding debt and tries to figure 
out ways to make your payments on that debt more affordable. 
Frequently, credit counselors negotiate with creditors to work 
out payment plans. As a result, credit counselors usually have the 
experience necessary to negotiate loan modifications.
 
If you authorize your credit counselor to negotiate your loan modi-
fication, we recommend that you have your attorney review the 
agreement before you sign it. (In this case, a general-purpose attor-
ney is usually sufficient in helping to protect your rights.)
 
Many credit counselors are on the payrolls of organizations sup-
ported by credit card companies and other lending institutions, so 
they’re more answerable to your creditors than they are to you. 
When choosing a credit counselor, ask lots of questions:
 
✓ Are you a division of or do you have an affiliation with any 
credit card company?
 
✓ Do you have a parent company? If yes, what’s the parent 
company’s name?
 
✓ How do you get paid? (Is another company funding the service?)
 
✓ Do you need to be licensed to operate in my state? If yes, are 
you licensed to operate in my state? Is your headquarters out 
of state?
Research to verify the answers you get. You can contact your sec-
retary of state’s office to find out whether the company is licensed 
(or needs to be) and to obtain a copy of the company’s license. In 
the later section “Choosing the Right Individual or Company,” we 
provide some guidance on choosing a reputable loan modification 
expert. Many of these same techniques are effective in choosing a 
reputable credit counselor.

 Chapter 4: Deciding Whether to Team Up with a Pro or Fly Solo 67
Real estate agent
Homeowners often assume that all real estate agents do is assist 
clients in selling or buying homes. What homeowners tend to 
overlook is the fact that real estate agents are, by trade, successful 
salespeople and tough negotiators. A seasoned agent also knows 
the market — property values and trends — and is well aware of 
what the lender stands to lose through foreclosure. An agent can 
use this knowledge to negotiate an attractive workout deal for you.
An agent can also list and sell the home for you, in the event that 
you need or want to sell your home. If you’re looking at the pos-
sibility of selling the home at a loss, your agent may even be able 
to negotiate a short sale with your lender that allows you to break 
even on the sale or even earn a small profit. (For more about short 
sales, see Chapter 3.)
 
One potential drawback to negotiating through an agent is that 
agents don’t have the legal designation that often carries so much 
weight in dealing with lenders. Some states have rules that govern 
an agent’s eligibility for negotiating loan modifications, so make 
sure the agent you’re considering has satisfied them all.
 
Don’t choose just any old real estate agent. Make sure the agent 
is a licensed Realtor — a member of the National Association of 
Realtors (NAR). The NAR requires its members to complete addi-
tional training and testing and encourages members to follow a 
strict code of ethics. If you’re looking for an agent to handle a short 
sale, limit your search to agents in multiperson offices of at least 
25 agents, and ask whether someone there has an expertise in 
short sales. Many agents don’t even know what a short sale is.
Mortgage broker or loan officer
Many people stung by the mortgage meltdown are adamant against 
letting mortgage brokers or loan officers negotiate loan modifica-
tions. They blame these mortgage professionals for contributing 
to the problem and can’t accept the possibility that these same 
people could potentially profit from the fallout.
This is an ethical issue that we’re not about to tackle in this book. 
The question right now is whether a mortgage broker or loan offi-
cer is qualified to negotiate a loan modification on your behalf, and 
the answer is yes. Whether you want to negotiate through a broker 
or loan officer is another question — actually two questions:

Part I: Getting Up to Speed on Loan Modification  
68
 
✓ Can you trust someone who possibly placed borrowers into 
risky mortgages to negotiate an affordable modification for you 
now? (In particular, avoid the broker turned loan modification 
expert who placed you with the bad loan in the first place.)
 
✓ Is a mortgage broker or loan officer going to represent the best 
interests of you or your lender? A conflict of interest can easily 
result if the person representing you has a buddy-buddy rela-
tionship with the lender. Make sure your engagement agree-
ment spells out that the person is representing you.
Choosing the Right Individual 
or Company
Whether you’re in the market for an attorney, a real estate agent, 
or some other professional to represent you in your quest for a 
loan modification, you need to locate some potentially qualified 
candidates, gather information about them, and then whittle down 
your list until you find the best individual or company for the job. 
It also helps to know the common warning signs that illegitimate 
outfits emit, so you can steer clear of the worst ones.
In the following sections, we provide guidance and insight that 
empower you to perform your due diligence and track down the 
top professionals in your area.
 
Although you shouldn’t rush your decision, time is most certainly 
of the essence, so work quickly.
Locating qualified candidates
One of the best ways to find a reputable loan modification expert is 
to obtain referrals from people you already know and trust who’ve 
hired the expert to represent them. Unfortunately, that can leave 
you with a very shallow pool to draw from. Here are some other 
suggestions for tracking down reputable, qualified candidates:
 
✓ Contact local real estate brokers. They should know attorneys 
in the area who are experienced in negotiating with mortgage 
lenders, including foreclosure, bankruptcy, and loan modifica-
tion attorneys (see the earlier sections in this chapter for more 
info on each of these pros).
 
✓ Call the local branch of your state Bar Association. Someone 
there can direct you to an attorney who deals with situations 
such as the one you’re facing.

 Chapter 4: Deciding Whether to Team Up with a Pro or Fly Solo 69
 
✓ Ask at your bank if you feel comfortable doing so. You may 
not want to reveal your current financial woes to your friendly 
neighborhood bank, but if you do, the bank’s manager may be 
able to offer a valuable reference.
 
Obtain the names of at least three companies or individuals who 
look like the most promising candidates, and then start vetting 
them, as discussed in the following section.
Doing some detective work
Before giving any company or individual on your list serious con-
sideration, perform your own background check. Here’s how:
 
✓ Search the Internet for the company or individual, and read 
any comments that people have posted. Don’t rule out a ser-
vice just because it has one or two rip-off complaint reports. 
If it does a lot of loan modifications, it’s likely to have at least 
a couple of disgruntled customers. Be sure to ask about them 
though, and evaluate the representative’s response.
 
✓ If the candidate has a Web site, visit it. Cross any candidate 
off your list whose Web site looks unprofessional. If the Web 
site looks shoddy, the loan modification application the ser-
vice prepares for you will be just as bad or worse.
 
✓ Obtain the company’s street address and phone number, 
and do a reverse phone number lookup on the Web to see if 
the phone number and address match.
 
✓ Check the candidate’s Web site or call and ask for a bro-
chure or any additional materials the company can send 
you, including testimonials from past clients. If the company 
can’t supply additional information, cross it off your list.
 
✓ Find out the names of the people who own or manage the 
operation, and run those names through your favorite 
online search engine. If the owners/managers have profes-
sional designations, certifications, or affiliations, check with 
the certifying authority to verify the information and make 
sure no complaints that have merit have been filed against the 
person. For example, if the person is an attorney, check with 
the Bar Association in the state in which the person practices. 
If the person claims to be a Realtor, check with the National 
Association of Realtors (NAR).
Asking the right questions
Call the company or individual, explain that you need assistance 
negotiating a loan modification with your lender, and ask what the 

Part I: Getting Up to Speed on Loan Modification  
70
company or individual can do for you. Talk with a representative 
to see if you would feel comfortable working with him.
 
Don’t give any sensitive information over the phone, such as your 
mortgage identification number, Social Security or driver’s license 
number, or credit card information, until you’re comfortable work-
ing with the service.
When you contact a company or service, ask the person you’re 
speaking with the following questions:
 
✓ Who will be negotiating my loan modification? What are 
the person’s credentials? Preferably the person is an attorney 
who specializes in loan modifications.
 
✓ How successful is the service? How many loan modification 
cases has the service taken on? Of those, how many clients 
have received affordable loan modifications? A service that 
has done hundreds of loan modifications and has a 75 percent 
or better average is pretty good. Having one satisfied customer 
creates a 100 percent average, but that’s not saying much.
 
✓ How many prospective clients have you turned away? You 
want a service that’s selective and doesn’t just sign up every-
one who calls.
 
✓ How much do you charge? The service should be able to 
quote you a price. A few thousand dollars may be reasonable. 
Ten thousand dollars is way too high.
 
✓ Do I have to pay upfront? Although many experts advise 
against paying upfront for services, charging upfront fees is 
standard business for attorneys. Just make sure the service is 
legitimate.
 
✓ What is your refund policy? This is good to know, but we 
can recommend no right answer. When you hire a profes-
sional to represent you, it’s sort of like hiring a doctor to treat 
an illness — if he doesn’t cure you, you still have to pay the 
bill. In addition, a 100 percent money-back guarantee doesn’t 
replace skill, experience, or dedication. The best answer is 
probably that clients must pay for the service regardless of 
success and receive a refund for any unearned fees if the ser-
vice can’t negotiate an affordable loan modification. But even 
a refund policy like this can be corrupted, as explained in the 
nearby sidebar “Playing the arbitrage.”
 
✓ How many hours does an attorney spend on my file? Having 
a licensed attorney doing most of the work is usually best. 
With some services, paralegals, legal assistants, file clerks, 

 Chapter 4: Deciding Whether to Team Up with a Pro or Fly Solo 71
or customer service reps do most of the work, which is okay 
as long as a qualified attorney remains in charge and steps in 
when required.
 
✓ If I reject the lender’s offer, do I get a refund? Anyone can 
negotiate a lousy loan modification and then justify the fee 
by claiming success. You want to make sure the service is 
dedicated to negotiating an affordable loan modification.
 
✓ Will I meet with an attorney? Can I come to your office? 
Meeting with an attorney face to face helps you avoid getting 
scammed by a company that just has a pretty face on the 
Internet or in an advertisement.
 
✓ I’m also considering Company XYZ. Are you familiar with 
them? Watch out for companies that are willing to immediately 
disparage the competition. You want to hear something like, 
“No, I’m not familiar with them,” or “They’re a good company. 
You’ll have to decide for yourself who will best represent you, 
but let me tell you a little about our company/firm to help you 
make that decision.”
 
✓ How long has the company been around? How long have 
you been with the company? What’s your background? 
What’s the employee turnover like? A well-established com-
pany with a low turnover rate that’s staffed by highly quali-
fied professionals is usually better than a company that just 
opened for business last week.
 
Some states have restrictions on who’s legally allowed to charge 
upfront fees for loan modifications. In California, for example, 
attorneys can collect an upfront fee from clients they represent, 
but other real estate broker services that want to charge fees 
upfront must first register with and have their services contract 
on file with the California Department of Real Estate. Your state 
attorney general can explain any laws — related to upfront fees 
and more — designed to regulate loan modification in your state. 
See Appendix A for a directory of state attorneys general.
Making an informed choice
In many cases, the process of gathering information about various 
service providers reveals a clear winner. If you’re still not sure 
which candidate on your list is best, see how each one stacks up in 
terms of the following:
 
✓ Does the individual/company seem legitimate? If you can 
verify the individual’s or company’s existence, address, and 
phone number; determine that it’s providing satisfactory ser-
vice to most clients; and know it’s in good standing with its 
professional associations, it’s probably legitimate.

Part I: Getting Up to Speed on Loan Modification  
72
 
✓ Did the person you speak with seem competent? If the 
person you spoke with sounded as though he knew less about 
loan modification than you do, you can safely scratch this 
candidate off your list.
 
✓ Did the person you speak with ask you the right questions? 
Before asking for your money, the rep should ask questions to 
determine whether you’re likely to qualify for a loan modifica-
tion. The questions should cover facts such as whether you 
have a job; how much you owe; how many payments you’ve 
missed; what hardship you experienced; whether you’ve con-
tacted your lender; and if you contacted your lender, what 
your lender said.
Congratulations! You made it through a grueling selection process. 
Hopefully, you’ve chosen a service that you’re comfortable hiring 
to represent you. If you managed to scratch everyone off your list, 
go back to “Choosing the Right Individual or Company” and start 
over. Don’t choose a service unless you feel comfortable with it.
Avoiding clever schemes and scams
Assuming you followed our advice and selected a reputable loan 
modification service, you don’t need to worry about loan modifica-
tion scams and schemes. However, we’d be remiss if we failed to 
mention some of the clever con games that have emerged to take 
advantage of distressed homeowners:
 
✓ Take the money and run: An individual or phony company 
charges an upfront fee and does nothing for you.
 
✓ Foreclosure rescue on legal technicalities: The con artist 
tries to convince you that your mortgage is invalid, usually 
because the big bad government just fires up its printing 
press to print the money for the big bad banks. For a few 
thousand dollars, the con artist promises to take the matter to 
court and prove that you don’t owe the money. Unfortunately, 
you do owe it.
 
✓ Foreclosure rescue buy-rent-redeem: The con artist offers 
to buy your home and let you lease it until an investor pur-
chases the home at the foreclosure sale, at which time, the 
con artist promises to redeem the property and sell it back to 
you. Trouble is, the con artist has no intention of redeeming 
the property. He just collects the rent payments for a time 
and disappears.

 Chapter 4: Deciding Whether to Team Up with a Pro or Fly Solo 73
 
Be particularly suspicious of anyone who shows up at your door 
offering to help you, especially if the person asks you to sign over a 
deed to your property. This is one of the most common red flags of 
a foreclosure scam. As soon as the person has a deed to your prop-
erty, he can record the deed with the county register to become 
the new owner. The fraudster may then try to evict you; take out 
another loan against the property; or collect rent or fees from you, 
let the property go through foreclosure, and then disappear with 
the cash.
Scraping Together Money 
for Upfront Fees
When you’re up to your gills in debt, how do you go about drum-
ming up several thousand dollars for a loan modification, espe-
cially to a company that charges its fees upfront? Well, you have a 
few options:
 
✓ Seek a loan from relatives or friends — people currently in a 
position to assist you financially.
 
✓ Divert financial resources toward solving the problem rather 
than putting out fires. We’re not advising you to stop making 
payments, but if you can’t afford a full payment, your lender is 
unlikely to accept a partial payment, so using that partial pay-
ment to hire someone who can fix the problem may be a good 
investment.
 
✓ Work out a payment plan to cover the cost of the company’s 
service. You should expect to have to pay something upfront, 
but the company may accept an installment plan.
Playing the arbitrage
Disreputable services have been known to “play the arbitrage.” They offer a partial 
refund and sign up customers but have no intention of helping those customers. 
They may collect $2,000 upfront, knowing they’ll be refunding $1,500 in 90 days.
Prospective customers see the refund policy and think the service is legit, but 
the company does little or nothing to pursue a loan modification on their behalf. 
Ninety days later, the service refunds the $1,500, keeping $500 for doing nothing. 
The customer doesn’t complain because the service provided the partial refund as 
promised. Do your homework, as outlined in the “Choosing the Right Individual or 
Company” section in this chapter, to avoid finding yourself in this situation.

You may be able to keep your attorney costs down by doing much 
of the heavy lifting on your own — placing phone calls, filing your 
application, and submitting supporting documentation. You can 
then call on the attorney to look over the paperwork. However, 
keep your attorney in the loop from the very beginning.
Teaming Up with Your 
Representative
In the best of all possible worlds, you could tell your loan modifica-
tion expert your lender’s name and your mortgage identification 
number, and the person could hammer out the details with your 
lender. Although that’s pretty close to how it goes in the real world, 
you need to do some work upfront and team up with your represen-
tative for optimum results. Following are some suggestions:
 
✓ Come clean. Whatever the reason you ended up in this situ-
ation, come clean about it. Concealing information that’s 
embarrassing or that you fear may hurt your chances of 
getting a loan modification can backfire. First, anything you 
hold back may be exactly what the expert needs to prove you 
qualify. Second, if the lender discovers something you failed 
to disclose, you could ruin your chances of getting a loan 
modification.
 
✓ Deliver the goods. Obtain all the documents your representa-
tive asks for and deliver them on time or ahead of schedule. 
See Chapter 6 for a list of documents typically required.
 
✓ Let your rep do her job. Don’t micromanage the process or 
call every day for updates. The more time your representative 
spends on the phone assuring you that everything is being 
taken care of, the less time she has to take care of things.
 
✓ Stay in the loop. You don’t want to badger your representa-
tive, but you should check in once a week if you haven’t heard 
anything.
 
 Ask your representative to provide you with a timeline, 
including a schedule of when she’s going to contact you with 
updates so you know what to expect.
 
After you hire a professional to represent you, stop contacting 
the lender directly and don’t discuss the matter with any of the 
lender’s representatives if they call you. Refer the matter to the 
person who’s representing you. Otherwise, you may say something 
that could compromise your representative’s ability to negotiate 
an attractive deal on your behalf.

In this part . . .
Your fi rst goal in obtaining an affordable loan 
modifi cation is to get past the gatekeepers — the 
lender’s frontline defense. Typically overworked, over-
whelmed, and underpaid, these folks are often looking 
for the path of least resistance; in some cases that means 
rejecting your request for a loan modifi cation. Next in line, 
please. And if you fail to deliver to the right person all 
the required items in the right format, at the right time,

gatekeepers the excuse they’ve been looking for.
The good news is that we’re watching your back. In this

▶ Coming clean about your situation

A
pplying for a loan modification is like applying for a job. 
When applying for a job, you can significantly improve your 
chances of success by researching the company and the position 
you want and tailoring your application and résumé to the com-
pany and any openings it has posted.
Likewise, you can improve your chances of having your loan modi-
fication application accepted and approved by researching your 
lender’s loan modification guidelines, what it may or may not be 
willing to modify, and its documentation requirements. This chap-
ter shows you how to gather information from your lender so you 
can present your application in the most favorable light.
Checking Out Your 
Lender’s Web Site
Almost every business on the planet has a Web site, lenders 
included, so if you have access to a computer connected to the 
Internet, fire it up and head to your lender’s Web site. Appendix A 
includes a list of Web site addresses for numerous mortgage lend-
ers. If your lender’s not listed there, you have a couple of options:
 
✓ Check your most recent mortgage statement. It may contain a 
Web site address, phone number, and e-mail address.

Part II: Kick-Starting the Process: Applying for a Loan Modification 
78
 
✓ Visit the HOPE NOW Web site at www.hopenow.com, and see 
if your lender or servicer is included in the list under Find 
Your Mortgage Company’s Website.
 
✓ Type the name of your lender or servicer into your favorite 
Internet search engine. A link to your lender’s site should pop 
up at or near the top of the search results.
Clicking your way to 
something useful
The Web site address lands you on the home page that sort of acts 
like an information kiosk for everything the lender offers. Carefully 
inspect the home page, looking for links with words or phrases 
that apply to your current situation, such as “mortgages,” “home 
mortgages,” “avoiding foreclosure,” “default,” “trouble making pay-
ments,” “financial hardship,” “home retention,” and so on; then 
click the link for more information on that topic.
You may need to poke (and click) around quite a bit to find what 
you’re looking for. On one lender’s site we visited, we had to click 
a link for home financing, another link for mortgages, and then a 
link for financial hardship programs.
 
We spot-checked several Web sites listed in Appendix A and dis-
covered that most (but not all) offer information for customers 
facing financial hardship. If you look really hard and don’t find 
anything about loan modifications, use the Web site’s search box 
to search the site for key words and phrases like those mentioned

Knowing what to expect
Every lender Web site is different, but if the site offers assistance 
and information for distressed homeowners, it usually offers this 
information and assistance in one or more of the following forms:
 
✓ A menu of options you can pursue to avoid foreclosure. This 
menu may include special refinancing programs, fast-track 
loan modification, payment plans, or online payment plans. 
(See Chapter 3 for descriptions of more options.)

 Chapter 5: First Things First: Contacting Your Lender 79
 
✓ An online form requesting some general information about 
you and your situation, such as your name, address, phone 
number, loan number, and reason for financial hardship. 
You complete the form, click a button, and a representative 
follows up with you later — usually by phone.
 
✓ A list of documents and information you need to pull 
together in preparation for speaking with your lender.
 
✓ Printable forms to complete and sign or have someone else 
sign. These forms may include an authorization letter giving 
your representative permission to contact your lender, a 
financial statement you need to complete, or a hardship letter 
form. See “Checking Application Requirements” later in this 
chapter for more on required paperwork.
 
✓ Toll-free phone numbers and the lender’s hours of operation.
 
✓ A toll-free phone number for contacting a HUD-approved 
credit counselor. (HUD stands for the U.S. Department of 
Housing and Urban Development.)
 
✓ Additional details and contact information for consumer 
assistance programs, such as those offered by HUD and 
HOPE NOW, which we describe in Appendix A.
 
Be careful when providing the lender with information online or 
off. The information should be accurate, not give too much away, 
and be consistent with anything you communicated to the lender 
in the past or will communicate in the future. Don’t offer any deals 
or say what you’re willing to pay. Let the lender make the first 
offer. It may be a better deal than what you’re thinking of asking 
for. Keep in mind that the gatekeepers may be looking for any 
excuse to disqualify you, so be careful what you say.
Tracking Down a Representative 
Who Can Help
Contacting your lender is a snap. You pick up the phone and dial 
a number. The hard part is working your way to a living, breathing 
human being with the brain capacity and understanding to help 
you deal with your current situation. Like other large businesses, 
lenders can toss all sorts of obstacles in your way, including but 
certainly not limited to
 
✓ Automated phone systems that give you nine options to 
choose from, none of which applies to what you’re calling 
about.

Part II: Kick-Starting the Process: Applying for a Loan Modification 
80
 
✓ Phone menus that lead to dead ends regardless of the option 
you choose.
 
✓ Hours of operation that require you to quit your day job to get 
anything resolved.
 
✓ Foreign call centers in countries that don’t even have 
mortgages.
 
✓ Hold buttons that mysteriously disconnect you rather than 
placing you on hold.
 
✓ Representatives who can’t locate you in their system even 
after you give your name, loan number, and your great-great-
grandmother’s maiden name.
We can’t help you much when it comes to your lender’s hours of 
operations. Maybe you can schedule phone calls during your lunch 
break or work out some flex hours with your supervisor so that 
you can spend part of your mornings or afternoons on the phone. 
Another option is to take vacation or personal days or negotiate 
some comp time so that you can work weekends to make up for 
time missed during the week.
 
Devote an hour or two solely to placing phone calls and speaking 
with representatives. Allowing sufficient time to complete your 
business can alleviate some of the stress.
In the following sections, we provide suggestions and tips for over-
coming the other challenges we mention and moving as quickly as 
possible from your initial call to someone who can really help.
Making the initial call
The first call is usually the most difficult because you may not 
have a number that connects you directly with the lender’s loss 
mitigation department. You have to start somewhere, though, so 
dig up the best phone number you can find by examining the fol-
lowing items:
 
✓ Any correspondence you received from your lender, including 
a late payment notice or notice of default
 
✓ Your most recent mortgage statement
 
✓ The lender’s Web site, as discussed earlier in this chapter in 
the section “Checking Out Your Lender’s Web Site”
 
✓ Any e-mail messages you received from your lender
As soon as someone picks up and asks how she may help you 
or direct your call, request the number for the loss mitigation 

 Chapter 5: First Things First: Contacting Your Lender 81
department and jot it down for the next time you call. Don’t just 
ask to speak with someone in the loss mitigation department. In 
most cases, the operator will give you the number and then offer 
to transfer you to that department.
Arghhhhh!
Contacting the lender and negotiating a loan modification certainly sounds easy 
enough, but as many homeowners have discovered, the process can be much more 
complicated, convoluted, and exasperating than it sounds. Here’s a story that’s not 
at all uncommon.
Due to economic hardships, a couple finds they can no longer afford their monthly 
house payment. Following the advice they’ve heard from personal finance experts 
and the federal government, they contact their servicer (the party that collects and 
processes their mortgage payments) for help.
After several days of frustrating telephone calls and transfers, the couple finally 
connects with someone who sounds as though she can help. The representative 
politely collects the couple’s financial information and explains that they do indeed 
qualify for a modification. She’ll send them the modification offer. All the couple 
needs to do is sign the agreement, have it notarized, and return it, and the deal is 
done. Hurray for the homeowners!
A week passes, and the couple receives nothing from the servicer, so they call to 
make sure everything is okay. The servicer assures the couple that the modification 
is pending and they can expect to receive the modification packet “any day now.”
Another week passes, and the couple still hasn’t received anything from the ser-
vicer. They call to check on the status of their application. This time, the representa-
tive informs them that they’ve failed to execute and return the modification package 
and the time for doing so has expired. After picking their jaws up off the floor, the 
couple explains that they never received any paperwork or they surely would have 
executed it and sent it back. They desperately want to save their home.
Again, the representative takes their financials over the phone, explains that they 
still qualify for a loan modification, and again gives them the terms of that modi-
fication. Relieved that they haven’t missed the boat, they agree to send back the 
paperwork immediately after receiving it. Again, the package never arrives. When 
they call to check up on it, the representative informs them that the lender never 
received the package from them. Furthermore, due to the couple’s repeated failure 
to respond and return the loan modification agreement, the lender is no longer will-
ing to modify their loan. Fighting back tears, the borrowers are at a loss.
Unfortunately, this isn’t an uncommon scenario. You can do everything right and 
still end up on the wrong side of a raw deal. At this point (and probably even earlier 
in the process), the couple would be wise to seek legal counsel. The lender obvi-
ously can’t be trusted.

Bypassing automated systems
If you call and get stuck in one of those automated phone menu 
systems, try one of the following tricks:
 
✓ Press zero to bypass the system and get an operator who can 
transfer your call to the right department. (Many companies 
are disabling this option because so many people know about 
it, but it still works with some businesses.)
 
✓ Wait for the options to cycle through to the end. Sometimes, 
making no selection is enough to transfer you to an operator. 
In other cases, instructions at the end tell you what to do to 
connect to a representative, such as, “If dialing from a rotary 
phone, please stay on the line, and somebody will be with you 
shortly.” In this case, just pretend you’re using a rotary phone 
and wait it out.
 
✓ Call the number for new customers. Lenders are often more 
eager to speak with prospective customers than existing ones. 
After you get in the door, you can ask to be transferred.
 
✓ Try a different phone number if you have more than one.
 
✓ If you’re calling from a cellphone, hang up and call back on a 
land line. Sometimes automated systems have a tough time 
detecting when buttons are pressed on a cellphone.
Communicating effectively 
with foreign call centers
When you’re dealing with lenders who have outsourced their 
customer service to foreign lands, all we can recommend is to do 
your best to deal with the situation. Sometimes, the people man-
ning the phones in a foreign land are actually more helpful than 
their domestic counterparts. Assuming you can adjust to a certain 
accent, you’ll do just fine. If you can’t understand the representa-
tive or he can’t understand you, here are some suggestions:
 
✓ Let the person know that you’re having trouble understanding 
him. The “It’s not you, it’s me” approach can come in very 
handy here.
 
✓ Ask to speak to a manager.
 
✓ Hang up and try again at a different time, during off-peak 
business hours, such as first thing in the morning. During 
peak business hours and after business hours, calls are more 
likely to be diverted to a foreign call center.

 Chapter 5: First Things First: Contacting Your Lender 83
 
Calling early in the morning has the added benefit of connecting 
you with someone who’s not already exhausted from having to 
deal with irate customers for eight hours. (Make sure you’re calling 
during off-peak hours in your lender’s time zone; 8 a.m. for them 
could be 5 a.m. for you.)
Talking to the right person 
makes all the difference
Maria was the family breadwinner and was gainfully employed at the time her 
family purchased their home. Over the course of four years, she never missed a 
payment ($1,500 per month). Then, through no fault of her own, she lost her job of 
14 years and fell behind on her payments.
She received an Alternative to Foreclosure notice from her lender informing her 
of her options — loan modification, short sale, or deed in lieu of foreclosure. She 
called her lender and explained that she had lost her job and was collecting unem-
ployment ($355 per week, $1,420 per month) and supplementing her income with 
savings.
The person she spoke to showed no compassion, informing Maria that she needed 
to bring her account current immediately or the lender would foreclose the follow-
ing month. Afraid of losing her home, Maria agreed to make the $1,960 payment, 
which consisted of her current monthly payment plus penalties and interest. After 
making this first payment, she realized she was burning through her savings at an 
unsustainable rate, so she decided to seek help. She called Ralph.
What Maria failed to realize was that the person she spoke to was the gatekeeper, 
not anyone who could really help her. When Ralph called, he quickly moved past 
the gatekeeper to the loss mitigation manager. He had a couple of questions:
 ✓ How did you expect this homeowner to remain in her home and remain current 
by giving her a payment arrangement that’s not possible to meet or maintain?
 ✓ What income figures did you use to qualify her for her current payment plan?
Ralph also pointed out that under fair debt collection laws, the lender can’t instill 
fear in the borrower to collect payments. He reminded the loss mitigation manager 
that this default was foreseeable, that economic conditions were miserable, and 
that the borrower had an excellent payment history leading up to the default.
As a result, the loss mitigation manager offered Maria a special forbearance, giving 
her time to find a new job. Maria had to accept a position paying far less than her 
previous job, so the lender granted her loan modification request, lowering her 
monthly payment from $1,500.00 to $985.00 with an interest rate reduction from 9.75 
to 5.25 percent and a term extension to 40 years.
By speaking to the right person and knowing your rights, you have a much better 
chance of obtaining a truly affordable loan modification.

Part II: Kick-Starting the Process: Applying for a Loan Modification 
84
Hanging up and starting over is also an effective strategy if you’re 
dealing with someone who speaks your language just fine but is 
uncooperative or incompetent. Calling back usually gives you a 
second chance with a fresh voice, especially with large lenders. If 
the fresh voice mentions notes in your file that you just called, say 
you were disconnected and ask if this person can now assist you.
Taking names and extensions
When you finally reach someone who’s helpful, jot down the per-
son’s name, identification number, and direct phone number with 
extension. Having the person’s name and direct extension benefits 
you in several ways, enabling you to
 
✓ More easily contact the person later.
 
✓ Pick up where you left off.
 
✓ Keep a record of the person you spoke with and what that 
person said, which can come in handy if your case lands in 
court. In Chapter 9, we provide a log sheet for recording all 
discussions and correspondence you have with your lender.
 
At some companies, the representatives just give their first or last 
names, which could even be fake. Be ready to write when asking 
for the person’s ID number. Many representatives turn into the 
world’s fastest talkers when asked for their ID numbers.
Describing Your Situation
When you first contact your lender, one of the first things the rep-
resentative is likely to request is your version of what happened 
and where you stand — financially speaking.
Chapter 2 tells you how to take stock of your situation. If you 
haven’t yet gone through that process, take some time to do it 
now — before you discuss your situation with your lender. You 
may even want to skip ahead to Chapter 8 and write your hardship 
letter and draft your financial statement before speaking with your 
lender. Don’t read the letter or financial details over the phone — 
just use them to keep yourself on point. By having the information 
clear in your own head first, you’re much better prepared to lay 
out the details in an understandable and succinct way.
 
Just the facts, ma’am. When recounting your story and describing 
your finances, present the details as accurately as possible without 
placing judgment or turning this into a blame game. Treat your 
situation as a problem that needs to be resolved, not as an oppor-
tunity for a verbal boxing match.

 Chapter 5: First Things First: Contacting Your Lender 85
Your story should have a beginning, middle, and future, as follows:
 
✓ Beginning: Describe the hardship (event or series of events) 
you experienced that has made it difficult or impossible to 
catch up on missed payments and/or continue to make your 
monthly payments.
 
✓ Middle: Describe your current financial situation in broad 
strokes, if possible, to explain just how unaffordable your 
monthly payments have become. In many cases, the lender 
wants to prequalify you over the phone by gathering specif-
ics; this is another good reason why you may want to prepare 
your financial statement in advance (see Chapter 8).
 
✓ Future: Express your desire to stay in your home and work 
out a solution with your lender, but avoid getting knee-deep in 
details. Save the details for Chapter 8, when you prepare your 
application and have a clearer idea of the solution you want 
and changes you need to make to achieve that solution.
 
If you’re unemployed and your lender’s representative asks about 
it, let her know what you’re doing to pursue a new job. Saying, “I 
lost my job, and it ain’t coming back” or anything else along those 
lines is likely to get you tagged in the system as ineligible for a 
loan modification, which you may be, but at this point, you want to 
keep your options open as much as possible.
Finding Out What Your Lender 
Is Willing and Able to Do
Most companies have policies in place so their employees don’t 
have to act rationally or explain anything to customers. For exam-
ple, if you ask why a store’s charging you a 15 percent restocking 
fee when the salesperson sold you the wrong part, the representa-
tive points to the sign behind the counter and says something like 
“We have a policy of charging a 15 percent restocking fee on all 
returns.” When you ask why, you hear something like, “Because 
that’s our policy.”
Lenders have all sorts of policies for rejecting a loan modification 
request. Some of their restrictions are reasonable. If you’re not 
gainfully employed, for example, you can’t afford a house pay-
ment, regardless of how much a loan modification would lower 
your payment. Others vary depending on how aggressively the 
lender wants to offer relief. At the height of the mortgage crisis, for 
example, lenders became more motivated to assist homeowners 
and lifted some of their restrictions.

Part II: Kick-Starting the Process: Applying for a Loan Modification 
86
 
One of the first questions to ask your lender is “What is your loan 
modification policy?” or “What are your loan modification eligibil-
ity requirements?” If you’re ineligible for whatever reason, you 
want to know early on, so you can
 
✓ Resolve any issues preventing you from qualifying. For exam-
ple, you may be able to liquidate assets or shed obligations to 
make yourself eligible.
 
✓ Pursue other options, such as those presented in Chapter 3.
 
✓ Move up the chain of command to someone who may be 
willing to make an exception in your case.
You may need to clear several hurdles before reaching the ultimate 
decision maker. Begin with the servicer, but remember that the 
servicer is probably working within parameters set by the lender, 
investors, and any other parties that hold a stake in your mort-
gage. Assuming you qualify and ask for a modification that meets 
the prerequisites, the servicer can accommodate your request.
If your request falls outside the predetermined parameters, you 
may be able to get an exception from a loss mitigation supervisor.
What do you mean, you can’t?
Many homeowners become disgruntled when they contact the company servicing 
their mortgage and the servicer claims to be unable to help. What homeowners 
often overlook is the fact that the lender’s or servicer’s hands may really be tied, 
as they’re claiming.
This isn’t the good ol’ days when if you had trouble making your mortgage pay-
ments you could stroll down to your local bank, discuss your situation with the 
bank’s president, and hammer out a deal. Nowadays, the person you’re dealing 
with may not be the person to whom you owe the money. Several other parties 
(other than the lender and servicer) may be setting the eligibility rules and decid-
ing which debt-relief programs to offer, including private investors who purchased 
your mortgage outright or as mortgage-backed securities; hedge funds (managers) 
that own pools of mortgage-backed securities; Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac (also 
investors); Federal Housing Administration (FHA) or Veterans Administration (VA) if 
they’re insuring your loan; or the federal government, as it has done with its Making 
Home Affordable program.
The moral of the story is this: Don’t beat up the messenger. You may need to negoti-
ate with the servicer’s or lender’s representative, but that person may not make the 
rules. The person you’re talking to may have little or no decision-making authority, 
but she does have the authority to hang up on you if you become belligerent. You’ll 
never get to the decision maker if you offend the gatekeepers.

 Chapter 5: First Things First: Contacting Your Lender 87
If the lender/servicer refuses to help you and you have private 
mortgage insurance (PMI), you may be able to enlist the assis-
tance of your PMI company. Many if not all PMI companies have 
started operating home retention campaigns. They want to modify 
the loans so they don’t have to pay out on the PMI claims after 
foreclosure.
 
Fannie, Freddie, FHA, and VA also can play a role in your modifica-
tion by working through their approved lenders to offer stream-
lined loan modifications and other forms of relief to homeowners 
whose mortgages they own or insure. If your mortgage is owned 
or insured through any of these parties, visit the party’s Web site 
to look for any relief programs — usually you gain access to such 
programs through your lender.
 
On March 4, 2009, the federal government became a major rule-setter 
when it rolled out its Making Home Affordable (MHA) program. 
Through this plan, participating lenders must refinance or modify 
qualifying loans to affordability in accordance with the program’s 
guidelines. For more information about this program, including 
whether your lender is a participant and whether you qualify for 
refinancing or modification, visit makinghomeaffordable.gov.
Checking Application 
Requirements
When you first applied for the loan to buy your home, the loan offi-
cer or mortgage broker probably asked you a bunch of questions 
about your finances and required you to deliver a short stack of 
documents, including one or two federal income tax returns, W-2 
forms, recent pay stubs, and so on.
When you apply for a loan modification, your lender’s representa-
tive is probably going to request the same stuff plus a couple of 
extra items. If you’re asking the investor for a special exception, 
the investor probably will want to see all your financials docu-
mented and verified. When you visit your lender’s Web site or 
speak with a representative, find out
 
✓ Which forms and other documentation you need to submit.
 
✓ Where to mail or fax your application.
 
✓ How long the process is going to take. (Better yet, obtain a 
detailed timeline for all stages of the process.)

Part II: Kick-Starting the Process: Applying for a Loan Modification 
88
Listing the items required
When you visit your lender’s Web site or speak with a representa-
tive on the phone, obtain a comprehensive list of required docu-
ments. The list is likely to contain the following items:
 
✓ Form for supplying general information
 
✓ Hardship letter describing the qualifying event or series of 
events that have compromised your ability to make your 
monthly payments (see Chapter 8)
 
✓ Proof of hardship, such as medical receipts, layoff notifica-
tion, divorce documents, or copies of mortgage statements 
showing a sudden increase in your monthly payments
 
✓ Financial statement documenting all assets and liabilities 
(debts) and detailing your monthly income and expenses (see 
Chapter 8)
 
✓ Listing agreement for your home if it’s for sale and listed with 
a real estate agent
 
✓ Past two years’ federal income tax returns
 
✓ Past two years’ W-2 statements
 
✓ Recent pay stubs or other income verification from each 
source of income (may include child support and alimony, 
Social Security disability payments, and so on)
 
Some lenders require that you use their loan modification appli-
cation forms, so be sure to ask. If you’re given a choice, you’re 
better off using the lender’s forms to present all the information 
the lender needs in an accessible format. In addition, if the lender 
allows or encourages applicants to apply online and you have 
access to the Internet, apply online to simplify the process for 
your lender.
If your lender has its own loan modification application packet and 
you can’t download it from the Internet, request that it be mailed 
to you pronto — preferably overnight.
Getting a shipping address 
and fax number
Whether you apply online or via snail mail, you probably still need 
to send hard copies of your supporting documents to the lender, 
so ask for the following:

 Chapter 5: First Things First: Contacting Your Lender 89
 
✓ Shipping address
 
✓ Phone number (most shipping labels have a space for the 
recipient’s phone number, in case something gets mixed up 
en route to the recipient)
 
✓ Fax number
 
Why get a fax number and a shipping address? Because we recom-
mend that you both fax and mail in your application to improve 
your chances that it arrives at its destination.
Asking about timelines
Find out about any deadlines and timelines. Specifically, ask the 
following questions:
 
✓ How long will it take you to process my application?
 
✓ How long does the entire loan modification process take?
 
✓ When can I expect to hear back from someone?
 
✓ What should I do if I continue to receive late payment notices?
 
✓ Does my applying for a loan modification stop any foreclosure 
proceedings?
 
 In most cases, the answer is no, unless you have a written 
agreement from your lender or servicer to halt all foreclosure 
activities.
 
✓ Whom do I call (name or employee ID number and phone 
number with extension) to get a status update on my 
modification?
Keeping the Debt Collectors at Bay
Chances are pretty good that your lender is going to try to contact 
you before you contact it. This is certainly understandable — the 
lender wants its money. In most cases, the best way to get it to 
stop calling you is to communicate.
When you’re up to your gills in debt, however, and you’re doing 
everything you can to catch your breath, dealing with harassing 
phone calls and letters can become counterproductive. You may 
need to tell debt collectors to back off, and if you do tell them, 
they’re required by law to honor your request. Know your rights:

Part II: Kick-Starting the Process: Applying for a Loan Modification 
90
 
✓ Debt collectors are prohibited from calling before 8 a.m. and 
after 9 p.m. local time.
 
✓ Debt collectors aren’t allowed to instill fear in you as a way 
to collect the debt, such as, “Pay up, or we’re going to evict 
you.”
 
✓ If you tell debt collectors to stop contacting you, they’re 
required to stop calling you and sending you notices.
If a debt collector is harassing you, the Federal Trade Commission 
(FTC) recommends you do the following:
Make a copy of your letter. Send the original by certified mail, 
and pay for a “return receipt” so you’ll be able to document 
what the collector received. Once the collector receives your 
letter, they may not contact you again, with two exceptions: 
a collector can contact you to tell you there will be no further 
contact or to let you know that they or the creditor intend to 
take a specific action, like filing a lawsuit. Sending such a letter 
to a debt collector you owe money to does not get rid of the 
debt, but it should stop the contact.
If the harassing contact continues, you can sue the collector. You 
can also file a complaint with the FTC and your state attorney 
general (see Appendix A for contact information). For additional 
details, check out the FTC’s Debt Collection FAQs: A Guide for 
Consumers online at www.ftc.gov/bcp/edu/pubs/consumer/
credit/cre18.shtm.

N
obody exactly plans on falling behind on their house pay-
ments and ending up on the wrong side of a pending fore-
closure. But when you look at all the hoops you have to jump 
through to get a loan modification, you begin to wonder whether 
your lender thinks you planned the whole thing. If you want help, 
you’ll need to prove that you’re not staging the scene just to get 
a lower house payment; that you really need the help; and that, 
if you get some help, you won’t end up in the same predicament 
three to six months from now.
All that proving requires documentation — and lots of it. Just as 
knowledge is power, information is power when negotiating a loan 
modification. You need to gather all the facts, figures, and docu-
mentation the lender is likely to request along with other docu-
ments required to complete the application forms and make your 
case. This chapter shows you how to pull it all together.
Digging Up Documents
Lenders don’t grant loan modifications just because borrowers 
ask for them and claim to be in financial distress. They need proof. 
Your lender wants to see that you’re earning enough money to 
afford a reasonable house payment and some proof that you experi-
enced a financial setback. It needs to look at your monthly income 
and expenses to make sure you’re not squandering your earnings 
on bonbons and trinkets. And if you have something to document 
the current market value of your home, it wants to see that, too.

Part II: Kick-Starting the Process: Applying for a Loan Modification 
92
In Chapter 8, when you prepare your application and assemble the 
supporting documents your lender requires, we get into the specif-
ics of which documents you need to submit with your application. 
At this stage, we recommend gathering all the documents you may 
need to prepare your application and support your claim.
 
Compiling all your documents may expose pieces of your financial 
puzzle that you didn’t know about or that you can adjust to make 
your mortgage more affordable. Even if you don’t have to actually 
send hard copies of the supporting documents into your lender, it’s 
good to work off of them when filling out your financial statement.
In the following sections, we list the documents you need to dig 
up and explain how they’re likely to come in handy when you’re 
applying for or negotiating the terms of a loan modification.
Proof of income
Without income, you can’t afford a house payment, regardless of 
how low the lender is willing to go, so the first thing the lender 
wants to see is proof that the major breadwinners of the 
household are winning a steady and sufficient supply of bread. 
Depending on your lender’s requirements, you need to supply 
proof of income by way of one or more of the following documents:
 
✓ Pay stubs for the most recent two to four pay periods
 
✓ Federal tax returns for the last two years
 
✓ W-2s for the last two years
 
✓ Letter from a new employer stating your wage or salary and 
start date
Proof of hardship
Lenders consider requests for loan modifications only if the appli-
cants have experienced financial hardship. They’re not about to 
approve a loan modification because you had an off night at the 
blackjack tables. They want to see proof that you’ve experienced 
some real financial pain — preferably due to something you had no 
control over.
In Chapter 8, we show you how to pen an effective hardship letter, 
but having documented proof of the hardship, such as one (or 
more) of the following items, can also help you make your case:

 Chapter 6: Gathering Facts, Figures, and Documentation 93
 
✓ Pink slip or notice showing a suspension or termination of 
employment or an income reduction (such as a notice of no 
overtime or temporary revolving lay-offs): An approved or 
pending unemployment application from your state’s unem-
ployment office may work if you didn’t get a formal release 
from your employer.
 
✓ Birth certificate showing a new arrival: This may support 
a claim that unexpected expenses derailed your budget or 
maternity leave temporarily reduced the household income. 
An employer’s Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) letter 
acknowledging your qualified time off may be enough.
 
✓ Death certificate: This may support a claim that funeral 
expenses sank the family budget or lost income from one of 
the household’s breadwinners caused a financial setback.
 
✓ Medical bills: These support a claim that increased medical 
expenses strained the family budget or an illness resulted in 
reduced income from the person who suffered the illness or a 
caregiver.
 
✓ Legal papers showing a separation or divorce, either of 
which typically results in a reduction of household income.
 
✓ Mortgage statements: These statements can show an interest 
rate increase on an adjustable-rate mortgage that made the 
monthly payment unaffordable.
Although your lender may not require documented proof of the 
hardship, it’s likely to have you sign an affidavit of hardship that’s 
subject to perjury penalties. Either way, having the proof available 
can help you pen your hardship letter and can back up your state-
ment in the event that your lender questions your claims.
 
Your lender may be willing to entertain hardships such as alcohol 
or drug addictions if you’re being treated. Some lenders even rec-
ognize incarceration as a qualifying hardship.
Mortgage statements and 
related documents
One of the most important figures you and your lender will toss 
around is your house payment, which breaks down into four 
amounts collectively referred to as PITI: principal, interest, taxes, 
and insurance. (Sometimes, a fifth amount comes into play — 
homeowner association, or HOA, fees.)

Part II: Kick-Starting the Process: Applying for a Loan Modification 
94
If your payment calls for principal to be paid, part of your monthly 
payment covers principal with the rest going toward interest. 
Depending on how your account is set up, a portion of your payment 
may also be set aside in an escrow account out of which the servicer 
(the party processing your payment) pays your property taxes, 
homeowner’s insurance, and any HOA fees when they come due.
If your monthly payment covers everything, all you really need 
is a copy of your most recent mortgage statements. If you’re not 
sure what your payment covers, call your servicer. If you pay your 
taxes, insurance, and any HOA fees separately, you need to obtain 
all of the following documents:
 
✓ Mortgage statements: Your mortgage statements show the 
current payment due and the loan balance along with a break-
down of how much of the payment is applied to principal, 
interest, taxes, insurance, and HOA fees.
 
✓ Property tax statement: Counties are usually charged with 
collecting property tax related to real estate, so if you don’t 
have a copy of your property tax statement (bill), contact 
your county tax department.
 
 To be on the safe side, call your local taxing authority to find 
out if any outstanding taxes are due. Sometimes local assess-
ments haven’t yet been transferred to the county. You want to 
make sure you’re accounting for all taxes due.
 
✓ Homeowner’s insurance statement: This is typically a bill you 
pay once or twice a year, showing the total amount you pay 
to have your home insured. If you don’t have a copy, contact 
your homeowner’s insurance company.
 
✓ Flood/wind/earthquake insurance statement: If you have 
additional insurance to cover any damage from natural disas-
ters, you can obtain a copy of the policy from your insurance 
provider.
 
At this point, you may also need to factor in the cost of private 
mortgage insurance (PMI) if you’re paying it. Lenders don’t typi-
cally calculate PMI into your front-end DTI, but it’s an expense you 
pay each month (if your loan requires you to pay PMI).
Your lender may not require you to submit these documents with 
your loan modification application, but they’re useful to refer to 
when preparing your financial statement. It’s also a good idea to 
locate them beforehand just in case your lender asks for them.
 
Be sure that when your lender is estimating an affordable house 
payment, included in the calculations are monthly amounts for 
your home’s property taxes, insurance, and HOA fees. Leading up 

 Chapter 6: Gathering Facts, Figures, and Documentation 95
to the mortgage meltdown, some loan originators omitted these 
amounts from their calculations in order to “help” their clients 
qualify for loans based on lower house payments. In so doing, they 
simply helped approve risky loans and set up their clients to fail.
Other loan statements
At some point, your lender’s going to want to know how bad it 
really is — how deeply you are in debt — so gather copies of your 
most current credit statements, including any of the following:
 
✓ Car loan statement
 
✓ Credit card statements
 
✓ Student loan statements
 
✓ Other loan/credit statements
Obtain your most recent statements, showing the most current bal-
ance on the account and the minimum monthly payment. All these 
statements will come in very handy when you sit down to prepare 
your financial statement in Chapter 8. Again, your lender may not 
require copies, but keep them on hand just in case.
Your lender will eventually total all your debts and use that 
number (along with your total monthly income) to calculate your 
debt-to-income (DTI) ratios, as explained in Chapter 2. The DTI 
ratios are key in determining whether you qualify for a loan modi-
fication or other debt-relief program and in formulating a viable 
workout solution.
 
Obtain a fresh copy of your credit report. Your credit report shows 
all outstanding and revolving credit items being reported to the 
credit bureaus under your name. Lenders are now routinely pull-
ing credit reports to verify the financials, so you should know what 
they’re going to see. You’re entitled to one free credit report per 
year, and you can obtain it in one of the following ways:
 
✓ Submit your request online at www.annualcredit
report.com.
 
✓ Phone in your request by calling 877-322-8228.
 
✓ Download the Annual Credit Report Request Form from www.
annualcreditreport.com/cra/requestformfinal.
pdf, fill it out, and mail it to Annual Credit Report Request 
Service, P.O. Box 105281, Atlanta, GA 30348-5281.

Monthly bills and expenses
In Chapter 2, we encourage you to do some preliminary calcula-
tions to size up your financial situation for yourself. When you’re 
preparing your financial statement, however, use actual amounts 
in your budget calculations rather than estimates. You can obtain 
accurate numbers from your most current bills, invoices, and your 
own written records; turn to the following documents:
 
✓ Car insurance statement showing how much you pay for car 
insurance annually, semi-annually, quarterly, or monthly
 
✓ Utility bills, including gas, electric, water/sewage, telephone, 
Internet, and trash removal
 
✓ Cellphone statement
 
✓ Other monthly bills, such as cable or satellite TV bills or sub-
scriptions to other services
 
✓ Insurance statements, including medical, dental, disability, 
and life
 
✓ Medical expense statement for expenses not covered by insur-
ance, including co-pays and prescriptions
 
✓ Proof of child care or tuition payments
 
✓ Savings and checking account statements for the last two to 
four periods
 
✓ Checking account register (where you record all your depos-
its and withdrawals and the checks you write)
 
 If you don’t keep a record of deposits, withdrawals, and 
checks you write, start doing so. A bank representative can 
get you up to speed on the basics and even provide you 
with detailed printouts of recent transactions so you can get 
caught up.
All these documents can help you develop an accurate and 
detailed monthly budget or income and expense report. Such a 
document comes in handy both to empower you to take control 
of your finances and to develop a realistic workout plan with your 
lender.
Closing papers
Whenever you close on a mortgage loan, the mortgage or title com-
pany usually presents you with a fancy folder containing all the 
closing documents. You can’t miss the folder because it doesn’t fit 
in a standard size filing cabinet without a little creative shoving.

 Chapter 6: Gathering Facts, Figures, and Documentation 97
Although the lender may not require the documents in the fol-
lowing list, we recommend that you gather them just in case the 
lender is uncooperative and you need to seek legal counsel. If your 
attorney decides to audit your mortgage or hire a third-party spe-
cialist to perform an audit (as explained in Chapter 14), or if you 
ultimately decide to file bankruptcy, you’ll need copies of all these 
documents.
Closing papers include fully executed copies (signed by all parties) 
of the following documents:
 
✓ Loan application: This is the document you filled out request-
ing the loan. It’s usually labeled Uniform Residential Loan 
Application (Form 1003) and is commonly referred to as a “ten 
oh three.” It may contain signs of predatory lending or other 
red flags that may encourage your lender to give you a loan 
modification (see Chapter 14 for details).
 
 You probably have two copies of the 1003 for your loan — the 
initial 1003 and the final 1003. The initial 1003 (sometimes 
called the handwritten 1003) was filled out when you first met 
with and applied with the loan originator. The final is a neatly 
printed computer-generated copy. It may be different if some-
thing changed, so compare the two.
 
✓ Good Faith Estimate (GFE): Lenders are required by law to 
present you with a Good Faith Estimate prior to closing so 
that you can compare loan costs among lenders. By compar-
ing the costs quoted on the GFE against the actual costs on 
the HUD-1 (described later in this list), you may be able to 
identify discrepancies that qualify you for a loan modification.
 
✓ Promissory note: The promissory note is sort of an IOU stat-
ing that you’ll make timely payments in the agreed-upon 
amount until you’ve paid back the loan in full with interest.
 
✓ Mortgage: The mortgage names your house as collateral for 
securing the repayment of the loan.
 
✓ HUD-1: The HUD-1 is a statement of actual charges and adjust-
ments associated with the closing. The Real Estate Settlement 
Procedures Act (RESPA) requires that both the seller and 
buyer receive a copy of the HUD-1 at least one day prior to 
closing. The HUD-1 may include signs of predatory lending or 
mortgage fraud that entitle you to a loan modification.
If you have a second mortgage or a home equity loan or line of 
credit, gather the closing papers for those loans, as well. However, 
focus on modifying your first mortgage first. You can then work on 
having any other loans modified.

Part II: Kick-Starting the Process: Applying for a Loan Modification 
98
 
If you can’t find your closing packet, or if it contains unsigned 
copies of some or all documents, contact the title company that 
hosted your closing and request a copy. If you’re not sure which 
closing company you used, call your lender or servicer to find out.
Documenting Your Property’s 
Market Value
It’s no surprise that lenders want to know about the value of a 
property before approving a loan to purchase it. They want to 
make sure that the collateral is sufficient to secure the repayment 
of the loan. When a lender wants to know your property value for a 
loan modification, however, the reason may not seem so clear.
 
Although we recommend obtaining a valuation at this point in the 
book, don’t let it slow down the application process. You can apply 
for a loan modification prior to obtaining the valuation.
Actually, you and the lender should want to know the property’s 
current market value for the following reasons:
 
✓ To weigh the options: If the home has plenty of equity in it 
(meaning it’s worth a lot more than you owe on it), for exam-
ple, refinancing or selling the property may be a better option.
 
✓ To gauge the risk of any workout deal: The lender wants 
to know how much of its investment it’s likely to be able to 
recover if foreclosure is necessary.
 
✓ To determine whether a short sale would be a viable option: 
For more about short sales, see Chapter 3.
 
✓ To calculate a principal reduction in the event that it 
becomes a part of the loan modification.
 
We don’t recommend paying for an appraisal at this point. If your 
lender requires an appraisal (usually for a short sale, refinance, or 
short re-fi, as discussed in Chapter 3), it will hire an appraiser and 
perhaps charge you for the appraisal, so save yourself the time 
and money of arranging one yourself. You may be able to obtain a 
pretty good estimate of your property’s true market value, in writ-
ing, for free or for a very reasonable fee by consulting a local real 
estate agent. Many agents offer broker’s price opinions, or BPOs, for 
free in the hopes of someday earning the homeowners’ business 
and referrals to other potential clients. A BPO is also commonly 
referred to as a comparative market analysis (CMA) or home valua-
tion. (In some areas, only appraisers are allowed to provide prop-
erty valuations.)

 Chapter 6: Gathering Facts, Figures, and Documentation 99
 
Ask for a valuation that reflects what you could sell your house for 
within 30, 60, and 90 or more days of listing. This information gives 
you insight into what the agent would list the price for initially and 
reduce it to over time. The 90-day estimate is more conservative 
and probably more in line with the property’s true market value.
Authorizing Your Representative 
to Speak with Your Lender
You’ve no doubt received copies of privacy policies from just 
about everyone you do business with — everyone from credit card 
and insurance companies to your doctor and dentist. If you’re 
like most folks, you toss these in the trash as soon as you catch a 
glimpse of those two words, “Privacy Policy.”
When you apply for a loan modification, however, especially if you 
decide to hire a third-party representative (see Chapter 4), you can 
no longer afford to ignore your lender’s privacy policy. It probably 
contains a clause stating that the lender can speak only with you 
or your authorized representative and the lender cannot share any 
details of your account with any company or individual other than 
you without your written consent. In other words, if you want your 
representative to be able to deal with your lender, you need to 
authorize this in writing — usually with a letter of authorization.
Your lender should have a copy of a fill-in-the blank authoriza-
tion letter you can use. Download a copy of the letter from your 
lender’s Web site (if available), or contact your lender and request 
a faxed or mailed copy of the letter you need (see Chapter 5 for 
details on contacting your lender).
You simply insert the name and any other information requested 
by your lender, sign the letter, make a copy for your records, and 
then mail or fax the letter to your lender. If your lender doesn’t 
have a standard letter of authorization, you can create your own 
by using the sample letter in Figure 6-1.
 
Some lenders accept only their own authorization letters or forms. 
If your lender has a form, use it. Also, make sure you give your 
third-party representative a copy of your signed and dated authori-
zation. If your lender were to misplace the form (it has been known 
to happen), your representative can fax over a copy of the original 
as soon as possible to avoid delays.

Knowing What to Ask For
In This Chapter
▶ Discovering what you want out of a loan modification
▶ Painting a portrait of your current mortgage
▶ Exploring the possibilities of different interest rates, terms, and principals
▶ Mulling over the potential fallout from discharged debt
T
he ultimate goal of any loan modification is to make the 
monthly payments affordable, but a loan modification can do 
this in any number of ways. It can drop the interest rate, extend 
the term, reduce the principal (which is rare), and/or roll missed 
or late payments and other costs into the modified loan.
Prior to negotiating with your lender, you need to evaluate your 
needs and determine what you want out of the deal. This chapter 
shows you how to do this and how to anticipate the lender’s evalu-
ation of your situation by playing a little game of “What If?”. We also 
help you assess some of the possible effects of a loan modification.
Recognizing Your Three 
Main Objectives
 
This chapter assumes you’ve already considered all options 
described in Chapter 3 and you’ve concluded that you want to do 
all the following:
 
✓ Cure any default (catch up on missed or late payments)
 
✓ Lower your monthly payment
 
✓ Keep your home

Part II: Kick-Starting the Process: Applying for a Loan Modification  
102
Generally speaking, these are the three main objectives of any 
loan modification, and they carry the added benefit of helping you 
repair your credit. How you achieve these objectives, however, 
can vary significantly depending on your wants, needs, resources, 
and what the lender or investor is willing to accept.
In the following sections, we reveal the most common approaches to 
curing defaults, lowering monthly mortgage payments through a loan 
modification, and keeping your home. In the section “Playing ‘What 
If?’” later in the chapter, we lead you through the process of assess-
ing the benefits of each approach as it applies to your situation.
 
To a great extent, the ultimate outcome hinges on the lender or 
investor and the individual(s) handling your case. Some lenders 
are truly consumer-conscious, treating applicants courteously and 
teaming up with applicants to develop long-term solutions. A few 
even reach out and team up with mortgage insurance companies 
to develop solutions. Others are notorious for dragging their feet, 
offering terrible terms, or shifting policies midstream. If your lender 
is cooperative, move forward as quickly as possible; lenders have 
been known to change policies and procedures without warning.
Curing any default
Being in default is like trying to bail out a leaky boat in a thunder-
storm. No matter how fast you bail water out of the hull, the level 
keeps rising. Unless you catch a break, the skies clear, and help 
arrives soon, you’re sunk. Fortunately when you’re in default, your 
lender may be able to cut you the break you need by
 
✓ Forgiving any penalties and fees charged against your 
account due to late or missed payments. Lenders are often 
willing to drop the charges, so to speak, and you really should 
push to have any penalties and fees removed from your 
account.
 
✓ Adding the late or missed payments to your mortgage bal-
ance and then re-amortizing the balance, so you can cure 
the default over the life of the loan. This option may be the 
most costly over the life of the loan, but it eases the strain 
on your current monthly budget. (See the sidebar “What’s 
re-amortization all about?” for an explanation of this action.)
 
✓ Instituting an installment plan that lets you cure the default 
over several months. This option cures the default more 
quickly than other options but can place a heavy burden on 
your monthly budget. You need to be able to afford the regu-
lar monthly payment plus a percentage of the outstanding 
delinquency.

 Chapter 7: Knowing What to Ask For 103
 
 If you negotiate paying off the default amount over time with 
an installment plan, factor these separate payments into your 
budget and make sure you have enough money to cover them. 
This option is usually practical only if you’ve recovered from a 
temporary financial hardship and now have sufficient income 
to cover the extra payments plus your house payment. Most 
lenders let you bring any default current with a “six months 
same as cash” plan and won’t rule out a future loan modifica-
tion if you come up short.
 
✓ Forgiving some or all default amounts. Lenders are typically 
very reluctant to accept this option unless you’re negotiat-
ing a short sale or deed in lieu of foreclosure, as discussed in 
Chapter 3.
 
Ask about Fannie Mae’s HomeSaver Advance (HSA) loan for curing 
deficiencies. An HSA is a separate loan payable over 15 years at a 
fixed rate of 5 percent with no payments or interest accrual for the 
first six months. In this case, your lender isn’t actually cutting you 
a break. You’re taking out another loan to bring your payments 
current, and you have to pay it back eventually.
A lower monthly payment, as explained in the following section, 
can also help in curing your default by freeing up money in your 
budget you can use to catch up on your bills.
Lowering your monthly payment
Lenders have all sorts of tools at their disposal to lower your 
monthly payment, including the following:
 
✓ Trim your interest rate, either temporarily or permanently.
 
✓ Extend the term by re-amortizing the loan over a longer 
period.
 
✓ Accept interest-only payments until your finances improve.
 
✓ Forgive a portion of the principal. Lenders are typically very 
reluctant to accept this option.
 
✓ Offer a principal forbearance, in which the loan is re-
amortized based on the current market value of the prop-
erty rather than what’s owed on it. You pay the difference 
(between what you owe on the mortgage and the balance on 
which your monthly payments are based) at the end of the 
term or whenever you sell the home. (Turn to Chapter 3 for 
more about principal forbearance.)

Part II: Kick-Starting the Process: Applying for a Loan Modification  
104
 
We strongly encourage you to opt for a fixed interest rate instead 
of a variable- or adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM), even if the fixed 
interest rate is higher, which it almost always is. A fixed interest 
rate helps keep your financial plans on track. A reset that bumps 
up the monthly payment $100 or more can sink a budget faster 
than a spending spree at your local department store.
Keeping your home
Keeping your home is pretty straightforward. As long as you 
achieve the first two objectives of curing any default and lowering 
your monthly payments, you get to keep your home . . . and hope-
fully pay less for it. Achieving the first two objectives is a little 
more complex than simply keeping your home because, as we 
explain in the two previous sections, different paths lead to the 
same destination.
What’s re-amortization all about?
Amortization is a process of retiring debt through regularly scheduled payments 
that remain constant over the life of the loan. The monthly payment remains con-
stant (for a fixed-rate loan), but the amount applied toward paying down the prin-
cipal balance increases and the amount put toward interest decreases with each 
payment.
Here’s an example: On a $200,000 30-year fixed-rate mortgage at 7 percent inter-
est, your monthly payment is $1,330.60. In the first month, $1,166.67 of that payment 
goes to pay interest, and $163.94 goes toward principal. You now owe $199,836.06. 
Because the principal balance is lower (slightly), you pay less interest next time 
and a slightly larger portion of your payment is applied toward the principal. So in 
the second month, $1,165.71 is paid in interest and $164.89 goes toward principal. 
(Lenders receive their interest first, and then you pay on the principal. This means 
that the first 15 years of the 30-year mortgage are mostly interest payments. Yep, it 
seems like a rip off, but that’s the way it works.)
When your loan is re-amortized through a loan modification, your monthly pay-
ment is recalculated based on whatever terms you and your lender agree to. 
Suppose you’ve already paid ten years on that $200,000 mortgage, so you now owe 
$171,624.77. You have a total of about $5,000 in missed payments. The lender agrees 
to lower your interest rate to 5 percent, add the $5,000 to your balance, and re-
amortize the loan from the 20 years left in your term to 30 years. This new mortgage 
is now a $176,624.77 30-year mortgage at 5 percent, which lowers your monthly 
payment by about $250 to $1,073.64.

 Chapter 7: Knowing What to Ask For 105
Establishing a Baseline with 
Your Current Mortgage
Before you start comparing various loan modification scenarios, 
you should have a clear picture in your mind of your current 
mortgage, including the interest rate, term, principal balance, and 
monthly payment. This information helps you set a baseline, or 
establish a context for arriving at meaningful comparisons.
To establish a baseline, jot down the following information about 
your current mortgage (get the information from your most recent 
mortgage statement or your closing documents, as explained in 
Chapter 6):
 
✓ Initial balance: The total amount you initially borrowed to 
finance the purchase of your home.
 
✓ Interest rate: The current interest rate you’re paying. For a 
fixed-rate mortgage, figuring this is easy: Just jot down the 
interest rate. Adjustable-rate mortgages are more complex, 
and we discuss them a little later in this section.
 
✓ Term in years/months: The total number of years/months 
you’re scheduled to pay off the mortgage. For example, if you 
have a 30-year mortgage and have paid 10 years already, the 
term is still 30 years/360 months.
 
✓ Monthly payment: The total amount you’re currently paying 
in principal and interest on the loan. If you’re also paying into 
escrow to cover property taxes, insurance, and homeowner 
association (HOA) fees, subtract the escrow amount from 
your monthly payment for comparison purposes.
 
✓ Principal balance: Also known as the unpaid principal balance 
(UPB), this is the amount you still owe on the mortgage.
 
 Don’t confuse the pay-off amount with the principal balance. 
The pay-off amount may be larger, accounting for the UPB, 
accrued interest, and other advances the mortgage company 
has made. You can obtain a current pay-off statement from 
your lender, which will include the UPB, other amounts, and a 
total pay-off balance.
 
✓ Remaining term: The number of years and months remain-
ing on your mortgage. For example, if you have a 30-year 
mortgage and have paid 10 years already, the term is now 20 
years/240 months.
 
✓ Total to be paid: The amount you will have paid your lender 
in interest and principal over the life of the loan. For a fixed-
rate loan, multiply your house payment by 12 (months) and 

Part II: Kick-Starting the Process: Applying for a Loan Modification  
106
then by the term (number of years) to get the total. For an 
adjustable-rate mortgage, calculating the total paid in prin-
cipal and interest over the life of the loan requires some 
guesswork. The best approach is to locate an adjustable-rate 
mortgage calculator and plug in the numbers to obtain an 
estimate. You can find an excellent collection of mortgage 
calculators, including one for adjustable-rate mortgages, at 
www.bankrate.com.
 
✓ Total current delinquency: The total amount of money you 
owe in back payments.
Here’s a mini-form for jotting down all the numbers from this list:
Initial balance: 
$ _______________
Term in years/months: 
_____/_____

(principal and interest): 
$ _______________
Current balance:

If you have an adjustable-rate mortgage, jot down a few additional 
numbers:
 
✓ Months before first rate reset: The number of months before 
the initial rate is scheduled to change
 
✓ Periodic rate cap: The highest percentage the rate can adjust 
in a given period
 
✓ Maximum rate: The absolute highest interest rate you will 
ever have to pay
 
✓ Months between rate adjustments: The number of months 
that must pass before the interest rate can change

 Chapter 7: Knowing What to Ask For 107
 
Some experts recommend ignoring the total amount the loan modi-
fication costs over the life of the loan. They advise homeowners 
to focus, at least in the short term, on negotiating an affordable 
monthly payment. Although we somewhat agree, in our opinion, 
knowing the cost over the long haul can improve your ability to 
compare different offers and make a well-informed decision.
Playing “What If?”
When your lender receives your loan modification application, it 
engages in its own game of “What If?” Usually, the lender begins 
by examining your financials and estimating a monthly payment 
it believes you can afford to pay. It then works backward, playing 
with the three key numbers that determine your monthly payment: 
principal, term, and interest rate. In the following sections, we 
show you how to play “What If?” with different scenarios so that 
you’re aware of the possibilities before the game begins.
 
Fortunately, given the accessibility of mortgage calculators, 
crunching the numbers is a snap. You can find excellent mortgage 
calculators on the Web, such as at www.bankrate.com. If you 
have a personal finance program, such as Quicken or Microsoft 
Money, it may also contain loan and refinance calculators.
Test-driving a lower interest rate
On a $200,000 30-year mortgage, a single percentage point change 
in interest can represent over $100 per month or $36,000 over the 
life of the loan. This is good to know when you’re applying for a 
loan modification. Even better is knowing the effect that an interest 
rate cut can have on your mortgage.
 
One of the easiest ways to lower a house payment is to drop the 
interest rate. Using your handy dandy mortgage calculator, take 
a few lower interest rates for a test drive. Plug in the following 
numbers:
 
✓ Principal balance: The amount of money you’d need today to 
pay off your mortgage in full.
 
✓ Interest rate: The rate you want to test-drive. Consider reduc-
ing your current interest rate by one, two, or three percentage 
points to explore the possibilities.
 
✓ Remaining term: The number of years or months you have 
left to pay on your mortgage. (The calculator should indicate 
whether you need to enter months or years.)

Part II: Kick-Starting the Process: Applying for a Loan Modification  
108
Try several different interest rates, and jot down the results in the 
following table. To calculate the value for the Total Paid column 
(the total amount paid to the lender over the life of the loan), 
multiply the term by 12 months and then by the monthly payment. 
For example, if the term is 30 years and the monthly payment is 
$750, then the Total Paid would be 30 × 12 × $750 = $270,000.

When playing “What If?” change only one variable at a time — 
principal, interest rate, or term. Later in this chapter, in the section 
“Mixing it up by adjusting several variables,” you have the oppor-
tunity to adjust two or more variables at a time, such as extending 
the term and lowering the interest rate.
 
Many loan modifications include step-rate adjustments; for exam-
ple, you may pay 5 percent interest for the first three years, after 
which the rate rises by a percentage point each year to a maxi-
mum of 8 percent. Be sure to account for these step increases — 
especially the worst-case scenario (8 percent in this example). 
(Step-rate adjustments don’t make the loan an adjustable-rate 
mortgage because the steps are predictable and not tied to an 
index that’s susceptible to market fluctuations.)
Spreading payments 
over a longer term
Not very long ago, paying off your mortgage early was all the rage. 
Homeowners were talking about refinancing into 15- or 20-year 
mortgages, paying a couple hundred dollars extra every month, and 
retiring early. Now, homeowners just want to hold onto their homes, 
and that involves a lower monthly payment. They’re often willing 
to take the opposite approach of past homeowners — tacking on 
several years to the end of the loan term or extending a 30-year 
mortgage to 40 years, dropping the house payment by $100 or more. 
(For more about the benefits of an extended term, see Chapter 11.)
To see how an extended term would affect your monthly payment 
and the total you’d end up paying over the life of the mortgage, 
plug the following numbers into a mortgage calculator:

 Chapter 7: Knowing What to Ask For 109
 
✓ Principal balance: The amount of money you’d need today to 
pay off your mortgage in full.
 
✓ Interest rate: Your current interest rate.
 
✓ Extended term: The number of years or months you’re willing 
to consider paying on the mortgage until it’s paid in full. We’re 
talking the entire term here, not just the number of years or 
months added on. (The calculator should indicate whether 
you need to enter months or years.)
Try several different extended terms, and jot down the results 
in the following table. To calculate the value for the Total Paid 
column (the total amount you’re going to pay the lender over the 
life of the loan), multiply the term by 12 months and then by the 
monthly payment.

Adjusting the principal balance
Depending on the main objective of your loan modification, you 
may see your principal balance rise or fall. If your goal is to catch 
up on late and missed payments, one option is to add them to the 
principal so you can pay them back over the life of the loan. If an 
interest rate reduction and/or term extension isn’t enough to make 
your house payment affordable, the lender may agree to some sort 
of principal reduction or forbearance.
In either case, you may want to play “What If?” to see how a prin-
cipal increase or reduction may affect your monthly payment and 
the total amount you stand to pay over the life of the loan.
Rolling late and missed payments into the principal
If you owe $5,000 in late and missed payments, trying to play catch-
up with a six-month or two-year installment plan can be tough. 
You’re facing a monthly payment of more than $200 in addition to 
your normal house payment. However, spread the payments over 
30 years (at 7-percent interest), and you’re looking at about $35 
a month. Yes, you’ll end up paying more than double that $5,000 
over the life of the loan, but the lower payment may enable you to 
keep your home.

Part II: Kick-Starting the Process: Applying for a Loan Modification  
110
To play “What If?” with rolling missed payments into the principal 
balance, add the total missed or late payments to your principal. 
Then plug the new principal into your mortgage calculator and jot 
down the result:
 
Balance 
Monthly Payment 
Total Paid
Current: 
_____ 
_____ 
_____
New: 
_____ 
_____ 
_____
 
At this point, you’re playing around with one variable at a time to 
see how that one variable can affect your monthly payment and 
the amount paid over the life of the loan. Admittedly, this is unre-
alistic because lenders usually change two or more variables. We 
get into this later in the section “Mixing it up by adjusting several 
variables.”
Reducing the principal
When you borrow money to buy a home, your lender assumes 
you’re going to pay that amount back in full. No one really cares 
whether your home’s value fell 30 percent or your car dropped its 
transmission at the intersection of Main and Pain. You’re expected 
to make good on the IOU you signed — the promissory note or mort-
gage note.
Lenders are often willing to consider tweaking the term and the 
interest rate because what they collect in interest is profit — the 
gravy ladled over their meat and potatoes. The meat and potatoes 
are the principal, and lenders really want that back in full. Every 
reduction in principal ends up in the loss column on their balance 
sheets.
 
Mortgages are often converted into mortgage-backed securities 
(MBSs) and sold to Wall Street investors, where they’re held in 
MBS pools. Investors may let lenders or servicers adjust the inter-
est rate and term on an MBS but are much more reluctant to adjust 
the unpaid balance on a loan.
If the lender can achieve the goals of curing the default and making 
the house payment affordable through rate and term adjustments, 
it’s probably not going to consider reducing the principal balance 
due on the loan. If the lender adjusted the interest rate and term 
and is just shy of meeting the goals, it may consider reducing the 
principal, but don’t hold your breath for a drastic reduction. If you 
compare the process to getting a haircut, don’t expect a buzz cut 
when you’re more likely to get a little off the sides.

 Chapter 7: Knowing What to Ask For 111
Still, you should take some time to see how a principal reduction 
could affect your monthly payment, so plug the following numbers 
into your mortgage calculator:
 
✓ Principal balance: The amount of money you’d owe your 
lender after the principal reduction.
 
✓ Interest rate: Your current interest rate.
 
✓ Remaining term: The number of years or months you have 
left to pay on your mortgage. (The calculator should indicate 
whether you need to enter months or years.)
Play “What If?” with several different principal amounts, and jot 
down the results in the following table. To calculate the value for 
the Total Paid column (the total amount you’re going to pay the 
lender over the life of the loan), multiply the term by 12 months 
and then by the monthly payment.

Your lender may be more willing to consider principal forbearance 
than an outright forgiveness of principal. With principal forbear-
ance, the lender lets you pay back a portion of what you currently 
owe after you sell your home or refinance. Suppose you borrowed 
$160,000 to buy a home, its value has since dropped to $120,000, 
and you still owe $140,000 on it. With principal forbearance, 
the lender calculates payments based on the property value of 
$120,000, and then you pay the difference ($20,000) when you sell 
the home or refinance it. Portions of the unpaid principal balance 
(UPB) are rarely forgiven — they’re almost always just postponed.
Mixing it up by adjusting 
several variables
In the preceding sections, we encourage you to play “What If?” with 
adjustments to your mortgage principal, term, and interest rate, 
changing only one value at a time. This gives you a pretty good feel 
for how each of those numbers affects the bottom lines — your 
monthly payment and the total you end up paying over the life of 
the loan.

Part II: Kick-Starting the Process: Applying for a Loan Modification  
112
Now, mix it up a bit. Change two or three numbers at a time to 
determine how various combinations can play out on paper. Try 
the following:
 
✓ Adjust the interest rate and term. Try dropping the interest 
rate a point and giving yourself 40 years to pay it off.
 
✓ Adjust the interest rate and principal. Reduce the interest 
rate by 2 percent and chop $10,000 off the principal balance.
 
✓ Adjust the term and principal. Extend the term from what-
ever’s left on your mortgage now to 30 years, and reduce the 
principal to the estimated market value of your property.
 
✓ Adjust the interest rate, term, and principal. If you have 
missed or late payments, add them to the principal and then 
play with lowering the interest rate and term so you can cure 
the default and make the monthly payment affordable.
 
The Making Home Affordable (MHA) loan modification plan employs 
a waterfall approach to making the monthly payment more afford-
able. First, it calls for an interest rate reduction. If that doesn’t 
do the trick (make the monthly payment affordable), lenders are 
encouraged to extend the term. If the rate reduction and term exten-
sion don’t do the trick, then lenders can reduce the principal.
Trying on an interest-only loan
With traditional mortgages, a portion of each payment is in the 
form of interest paid to the lender, and another portion is applied 
to the principal. Make all your payments over the term of your 
loan, and eventually you pay the money back in full, with interest.
Negative equity with interest-only loans
Interest-only loans may be okay for investors who are focused more on a property’s 
cash flow than on equity considerations. With a lower payment, the investor has 
more money to invest in other projects.
In the years leading up to the housing crisis, when the housing bubble was in 
inflation mode, home buyers also were attracted to interest-only loans because 
they could buy “more house” and have lower monthly house payments. As long as 
property values were on the rise, they were building equity in their homes without 
having to pay down the principal.
When the housing bubble burst, however, the inflated equity disappeared. Many 
homeowners found themselves in negative-equity territory, owing more on their 
homes than their homes were worth, even if they’d never missed a payment.

 Chapter 7: Knowing What to Ask For 113
With an interest-only loan, the majority of the payment goes to the 
lender in the form of interest, with a portion going to the servicer 
(for services rendered). You could make payments for the next 
1,000 years and never pay off the principal because no portion of 
the payment is applied to principal. Generally, we discourage home-
owners from taking out interest-only loans because they never get 
a chance to pay down the debt and build equity in their homes by 
making payments (see the nearby sidebar for more on these types 
of loans).
With a loan modification, however, an interest-only arrangement 
can be a useful adjustment in helping you catch up on missed 
payments and penalties. It can lower your monthly payment 
considerably over the short term, freeing up some money in your 
budget to pay down deficiencies. Be careful with an interest-only 
arrangement, making sure it meets the following criteria:
 
✓ It’s temporary. Paying only interest for two to three years 
so you can regain your financial footing is okay, but then the 
mortgage should revert to something more normal, in which a 
portion of each payment is applied to the principal.
 
✓ It gives you sufficient time to plan and prepare for any bal-
loon payments. Most interest-only loans come with balloon 
payments — a big chunk of money that comes due when the 
term expires. Make sure you have plenty of time to secure the 
funds to cover your balloon payments when they’re due.
 
Because you’re not reducing the principal on an interest-only loan, 
you don’t really need a fancy calculator to calculate the monthly 
payment. Just multiply the principal by the interest rate, and 
divide by 12. For example, on a $150,000 mortgage at 7 percent, the 
interest-only monthly payment is
($150,000 × 0.07) ÷ 12 = $875
You’re still playing “What If?” here, so compare this interest-only 
payment with what you would be paying with a more traditional 
mortgage. In this case, you’d pay about $998 with a traditional 
30-year mortgage.
Considering the Potential Fallout
We obviously get pretty revved up about loan modification 
and think it’s often the ideal solution for eligible homeowners. 
However, the loan modification option does have some potential 
drawbacks you should consider before seizing the opportunity.

Part II: Kick-Starting the Process: Applying for a Loan Modification  
114
Assessing the effect on 
the former loan
Other than changing the interest rate, term, and perhaps unpaid bal-
ance, a loan modification typically changes little or nothing stated 
in the original mortgage and promissory note. As a result, the loan 
modification document remains relatively short, around 2–5 pages 
as opposed to the 10–24 pages for a new mortgage plus 3–15 pages 
for a new note.
 
We’ve seen instances in which lenders attempt to grab one or two 
additional rights inside the loan modification agreement. They may 
try to slip in a clause, for example, saying that you agree to sign a 
new note if they can’t produce the original. For this reason, have 
a knowledgeable attorney review the documents before you sign 
them and send them back to the lender. Provide your attorney the 
original documents for comparison.
Forecasting the effect on 
your credit rating
Whenever you have trouble making payments on a loan or credit 
card account, it shows up as a blemish on your credit report and 
negatively affects your credit rating. Any delinquencies leading up 
to the loan modification may have a negative effect on your credit 
rating. However, the loan modification itself can have a positive 
effect.
 
A loan modification allows the credit bureaus to update any non-
payment issues as “settled” or some other favorable designation. 
This is far less detrimental than a deed in lieu (DIL) of foreclosure, 
a short sale (SS), or, heaven forbid, a full-blown foreclosure.
Gauging the effect on your ability 
to pursue future actions
Sometimes lenders try to insert waivers into loan modification 
agreements to protect them from any legal actions you may decide 
to pursue against them in the future, such as if you think you’ve 
been a victim of predatory lending practices. (Most loan modifica-
tion agreements include estoppel affidavits requiring the borrower 

 Chapter 7: Knowing What to Ask For 115
to agree to waive and release any past defenses in exchange for the 
mortgage company agreeing to modify the loan and waive any cur-
rent default.)
We certainly can’t advise you of what to do or whether you even 
have a case at all against your lender or loan originator. If you 
think you’ve been wronged, speak with an attorney who’s well 
versed in the rules and regulations governing the mortgage lending 
industry before you pursue a loan modification.
 
Prior to signing off on a loan modification agreement, have your 
attorney review it and point out any instances in which the lender 
is requesting that you sign a waiver relinquishing your rights.
Assessing the tax implications 
for discharged debt
When it comes to charging and collecting taxes, the government 
can be brutal. Suppose you can’t afford your house payments 
and face the prospect of selling your home at a loss. Your lender 
agrees to a short sale (see Chapter 3), accepting $10,000 less than 
you owe, so you can sell and break even. According to the tax 
code, discharge of debt is a taxable event, so you owe taxes on 
that $10,000!
Fortunately, President Bush and Congress provided some respite 
from this apparently irrational practice with the Mortgage 
Forgiveness Debt Relief Act (MFDRA) of 2007. For qualifying home-
owners, this legislation exempts discharged debt from federal 
income tax. (The MFDRA applies to debt forgiven in calendar years 
2007 through 2012, but it may be extended, as President Obama 
extended it from 2009 to 2012.)
MFDRA isn’t a blanket tax exemption; some restrictions apply, and 
you have to complete and submit the necessary paperwork, so 
consult a tax expert if any portion of your unpaid balance is dis-
charged or reduced for whatever reason.
 
Regardless of whether the MFDRA is still in force when you read 
this, be sure to discuss any tax implications of discharged debt 
with your attorney and accountant if you’re considering pursuing 
a loan modification option in which a portion of the principal bal-
ance will be forgiven. Being blindsided by a tax bill for a profit you 
never even touched can be mighty painful.

116
Pushing back
Knowing your situation and your options often places you in a stronger position to 
negotiate. Such was the case with Paul and Carol in Michigan, who were expect-
ing a new baby in the midst of an economic downturn. When we met the couple, 
they were three months behind on their payments of $1,377.78 per month and six 
months pregnant.
When we presented Paul and Carol’s situation to their lender, it was quite recep-
tive to their request for a loan modification. After the standard couple of weeks 
of processing, the lender presented its first offer: a monthly payment of $1,220.00, 
saving the couple $157.78 a month.
We thanked the lender for the offer but explained that the suggested payment 
still wasn’t affordable for the couple. We pointed out that about one out of every 
two loan modifications fail because the payment isn’t truly affordable. We also 
pointed out some key points the lender may have overlooked: Paul and Carol had 
a new baby on the way, the job market in Michigan was tough, property values 
had dropped significantly, and REOs (bank-owned repossessed properties) were 
lingering on the market.
A week later, the lender presented its second offer: a monthly payment of $918.00, 
saving the homeowners $459.78 per month. This represented a truly affordable 
house payment for the couple, and they signed on the dotted line.
The moral of this story is to know what you want prior to entering into negotiations 
and to identify all exits. The homeowners had a clear idea of what would be afford-
able for them. They wanted to keep their home and were committed to doing so, but 
they weren’t willing to jeopardize everything else in their lives to do it. They knew 
that if they couldn’t negotiate an affordable payment, they would need to move, and 
they were willing to do that, if necessary. Knowing what they wanted and having 
another option to fall back on allowed them to hold firm and push back when the 
lender presented its initial offer.

f you’re lucky, either your lender supplies you with all the 
forms to complete and a checklist of supporting documenta-
tion to submit with your loan modification application or you can 
easily download and print everything from your lender’s Web site. 
(See Chapter 5 for information on how to contact your lender and 
Chapter 6 for more about gathering the supporting documents 
you may need.) You simply follow the instructions, make copies 
for your own records, and mail your application to the lender. If 
you’re not so lucky, you have a rough list of items you gathered 
from phone conversations with the lender’s representative.
In either case, you need to prepare a hardship letter and finan-
cial reports. In this chapter, we show you how to pull everything 
together for these documents and then submit your entire appli-
cation to your lender.
 
On February 17, 2009, President Obama signed into law H.R.1, com-
monly referred to as the Stimulus Bill, which contains a provision 
to standardize loan modification qualifications, paperwork, and 
procedures. This legislation is likely to cut down on the differences 
among lenders in evaluating and processing loan modification 
applications.

Part II: Kick-Starting the Process: Applying for a Loan Modification  
118
Penning Your Hardship Letter
A key component of any loan modification application is the hard-
ship letter, the homeowners’ description of the financial setbacks 
they’ve experienced that resulted in their inability to pay their 
monthly mortgage. An effective letter achieves the following:
 
✓ Describes the event or series of events that caused the finan-
cial hardship — what happened and when
 
✓ States whether the hardship is temporary or permanent
 
✓ Describes the current situation as you see it
 
✓ Expresses your sincere commitment to keep your house
 
✓ Explains what you have done, are doing, and plan to do to 
resolve the issues that have placed you in default and that are 
making your house payment unaffordable
In the following sections, we explain what qualifies as a hardship, 
ask you several questions about your situation that you need to 
answer in preparation for writing an effective hardship letter, and 
provide you with a couple of examples to inspire your inner muse.
Recognizing eligible hardships
Not everything qualifies as a bona fide financial hardship. If the 
reason you can’t afford your house payment is because you just 
blew $50K on a really awesome speedboat, your lender isn’t going 
to shed a single tear at the foreclosure sale. On the other hand, if 
your spouse fell off a ladder at work and is now on disability, you 
have an excellent case.
 
The word of the day is verifiable. You need to prove that you expe-
rienced a genuine hardship and that it compromised your ability to 
pay. Most lenders give consideration to the following hardships:
 
✓ Job loss or relocation, such as a layoff or reduction in 
force (RIF).
 
✓ Income reduction, such as a wage reduction or loss of 
overtime.
 
✓ A failed business or one that’s suffering from an economic 
slowdown.
 
✓ Divorce or separation.

 Chapter 8: Preparing and Submitting Your Application 119
 
✓ Newborn child, namely maternity leave and the increased 
expense of having another dependent. Some lenders even 
consider adoption a hardship.
 
✓ Death in the family, especially if the person who passed away 
was helping to make the payments.
 
✓ Payment shock, as in a bump in the interest rate on an 
adjustable-rate mortgage.
 
✓ Property damage resulting in bills not covered by insurance.
 
✓ Theft resulting in losses not covered by insurance.
 
✓ Illness or injury that either reduces income or increases 
medical expenses or both.
 
✓ Too much debt accumulated over time.
 
✓ Military duty.
 
✓ Gambling by one of the household’s wage earners who’s 
currently seeking treatment.
 
✓ Alcohol or drug dependency of one of the household’s wage 
earners who’s currently seeking treatment.
 
✓ Incarceration of one of the household’s wage earners.
 
Don’t rule out a hardship just because it’s not on our list, even if 
you did buy that $50K speedboat mentioned earlier just before 
receiving a pay cut. If you’re willing to sell the boat and work out 
a deal with your lender that’s good for both of you, your hardship 
may be a less critical part of your application.
Answering a few questions
Good writing anticipates the readers’ questions or objections 
and responds to them. The same holds true for a hardship letter. 
The people reading the letter come to it with questions they want 
answered, so you’d better have the answers straight in your own 
mind first before you put them down on paper. Following are the 
questions your hardship letter needs to answer:
 
✓ What event or series of events caused the financial hardship 
that has made your monthly mortgage payments unaffordable?
 
✓ When did the hardship occur? Provide a specific date or 
range of dates.

Part II: Kick-Starting the Process: Applying for a Loan Modification  
120
 
✓ Is the hardship temporary or permanent? A temporary hard-
ship could be medical bills not covered by insurance, an injury 
or short-term illness, or a job layoff. A permanent hardship is 
more like a death in the family or a divorce or separation.
 
✓ How badly do you want to keep your home? If you really don’t 
care about keeping the home, the lender may not care enough 
to try to negotiate a loan modification. One of the other 
options described in Chapter 3 may be better for you.
 
✓ Are you behind on your house payments? If yes, how many 
months are you behind? What’s the total dollar amount of 
your deficiency?
 
✓ Can you afford to make a house payment? If yes, how much 
can you afford to pay? (Chapter 2 helps you break down 
your current finances and estimate an affordable payment 
amount.)
 
✓ What are you doing to address the root cause(s) of the hard-
ship (assuming you have any control over them) and recover 
your financial footing? This can be anything from budgeting 
more carefully to finding a new job or liquidating assets — 
selling your collection of baseball cards or Beanie Babies, for 
example.
 
The goal of your hardship letter is to convince your lender that 
you’re worthy of a loan modification. It should show that you meet 
all the lender’s eligibility requirements and convince the lender 
that you’re committed to a long-term solution and able to follow 
through on your end of the deal.
Reviewing sample hardship letters
Imitation may not really be the sincerest form of flattery, but it’s 
certainly a good way to start writing a hardship letter. Begin with 
a suitable model, add your own details, spice it up with a dash of 
sincerity, play on the reader’s emotions, and you can end up with 
a prizewinner. Figures 8-1 and 8-2 provide the models you need 
to get started. (Looking at examples is a good way to start, but do 
your very best to make it your own.)
 
This is a letter, not a novel or even a short story, so keep it short — 
one page is plenty. Underline the most important points, including 
the terms of your current loan, the total deficiency amount (if any), 
the date on which the trouble began, anything you’ve done to 
resolve the problem, and so on. Refer to the section earlier in this 
chapter entitled “Answering a few questions” to determine what’s 
most important.

Dear Madoff:
We are writing this letter to request a loan modification and to inform you of 
recent financial hardships that have made our current monthly mortgage 
payments unaffordable:
• 
Due to health problems, Lilly has had to change jobs, resulting 
in a pay reduction from $60,000 (teaching math) to $16,000 (as 
a teacher’s assistant) per year.
• 
Herman is a freelance writer who was earning approximately 
$85,000 per year; due to the current recession, he is struggling 
to now earn $50,000 to $60,000 per year. He continues to look 
for other sources of income but has not been successful in this 
slow economy.
• 
Our daughter just started college at UCLA, which offered her 
very little financial aid. She is working and has taken out loans 
to cover her contribution to tuition and expenses, but we are 
responsible for about $12,000 of the cost annually.
• 
During our transition to a more meager lifestyle, we have 
managed to accumulate over $15,000 in credit card debt. We 
have recently stopped using our credit cards and are living on a 
very tight budget.
• 
We are still falling behind a couple hundred dollars per month 
and have no surplus for catching up on the $5,678.00 we owe in 
late mortgage payments.
While we fully intend to pay what we owe, we need some relief. We are 
committed to keeping our home. We truly hope that you will agree to work 
with us to regain our financial footing.
Sincerely,
Herman & Lilly Crane

Sundown Federal
100 West 24th Street
Cheyenne, WY 82002 
Dear Sundown:
We are writing to explain the situation that has resulted in our need for a loan 
modification. We purchased our home 3 years ago on an adjustable rate 
mortgage with an interest rate of 3%. The interest rate has risen dramatically to 
9.75%. The monthly payment has risen from approximately $843/month to 
over $1,700/month. This has made it impossible for us to afford the monthly 
payments. We have tried to refinance into a lower fixed-rate loan but have 
been rejected each time. We have exhausted all of our financial resources 
trying to remain current on our mortgage payment. Each month we fall further 
behind.
Staying in our home is our number one priority. We are committed to doing 
whatever it takes to save our home. My husband is looking for a second job, 
and I’ve already gone back to work to generate additional household income. 
Even with the additional income, we find ourselves short and unable to make 
the mortgage payment. We love our house, but unfortunately we will be 
unable to save it without help from you.
We are comforted to read on your Web site that your company has made such 
a strong commitment to home retention. We honestly feel that with a little help 
from you we will be successful once again. Attached to this letter are the 
financial statement and other documentation you need to consider us for one of 
your home retention programs.
Thank you for your consideration.
Sincerely,
Ward and June Hatchet

Creating Financial Statements
Transitioning from the emotions of financial hardship to the cold, 
calculating arena of number crunching can be quite chilling, but 
eventually the decision of whether your lender agrees to a loan 
modification and the terms you ultimately agree on come down to 
numbers. You and the lender need to take an honest look at your 
household income and expenses, and you do this by laying every-
thing out in a financial statement.
In the following sections, we encourage you to complete two finan-
cial statements:
 
✓ One showing an accurate accounting of your finances at this 
very moment
 
✓ Another illustrating any cost-saving changes you’re planning 
to implement, such as going with the basic plan on your 
satellite TV service
You may already have most of the information needed to complete 
your financial statement if you worked through Chapter 2 on taking 
stock of your situation or Chapter 6 on gathering all the forms and 
supporting documentation required for completing a loan modifi-
cation application. If you haven’t worked through Chapter 2 or 6, 
don’t flip back (unless you really want to, of course) — the finan-
cial form is pretty straightforward.
 
If your lender has its own financial forms, use those instead of the 
samples we provide here. Using the correct forms may make the 
difference between having your application approved or rejected. 
Contact your lender as we advise in Chapter 5 or visit your lend-
er’s Web site to see whether it has downloadable financial forms. 
Appendix A is full of contact information for lenders, including 
their Web site addresses.
Painting a current financial portrait
Many lenders require only one financial statement: a detailed 
account of your current monthly income and expenses along with 
a list of anything valuable you own and how much it’s worth. They 
want to see on paper whether you’re really in financial straits or 
are blowing too much money on a lavish lifestyle.
Figure 8-3 provides a sample financial form you can use to supply 
the details that most lenders require. Some lenders want additional 
information, including your employer’s name, your current job 
title, and how long you worked at your current job . . . assuming, of 

Part II: Kick-Starting the Process: Applying for a Loan Modification  
124
course, that you’re currently employed. They may also want Social 
Security numbers, driver’s license numbers, and to know whether 
you’ve filed for bankruptcy. Use the lender’s forms to make sure 
you provide all the information required, but if the lender doesn’t 
supply forms, you can use the sample in Figure 8-3 as a guide.
 
The only number that’s likely to trip you up is the first one under 
Monthly Expenses: 1st Mortgage (PITI). PITI stands for principal, 
interest, taxes, and insurance. If part of your monthly payment 
goes into an escrow account to pay your property taxes and home-
owner’s insurance, the PITI amount is equal to your monthly pay-
ment. If you pay property taxes and insurance separately, total 
the amount you pay in taxes and insurance for the year, divide by 
12 months, and add the result to your monthly house payment in 
order to fill in this item.
When you’re working with a lender who requires only one financial 
statement, knowing which numbers to plug in can be a real chal-
lenge. If you know you’re overspending on groceries and other 
stuff every month, for example, do you plug in the real numbers or 
the amounts you know you could get by on? If you plug in the real 
numbers, the lender may reject your application on the premise 
that you could afford your house payment by curbing your spend-
ing. If you plug in numbers that are too low, you may get rejected 
because your financial statement shows that you can easily afford 
your current monthly payment.
 
When making your estimates, don’t overanalyze. Use realistic num-
bers so you don’t end up committing to something you can’t really 
afford.
Every lender has its own affordability thresholds to determine 
whether you have sufficient income to afford your house payment. 
The lender wants to be sure that you can’t afford your payment 
due to financial hardship, not because you like to eat out every 
night at fancy restaurants. If you’ve hired expert representation, 
your representative is likely to know the lender’s affordability 
threshold and be able to massage the numbers in your financial 
statement to qualify you while still providing an accurate represen-
tation of your budget.
 
If you’re completing the financial statement on your own, you’re 
usually better off using actual numbers from your budget and let-
ting the lender suggest expense categories where you may need 
to cut back, assuming your lender thinks you need to tighten your 
belt.

Figure 8-3: A financial statement.
Projecting your post-modification 
finances
Lenders often want to see a projected financial statement illustrat-
ing the budget sacrifices you’re willing and planning to make to 
regain your financial footing after the loan modification. For exam-
ple, you may be planning to sell one of the family cars to eliminate 
a payment and save a little on auto insurance and maintenance, 
trim the grocery bill by a couple hundred bucks a month, cut back 
your dinner-and-a-movie dates from twice a week to twice a month, 
and so on.

Part II: Kick-Starting the Process: Applying for a Loan Modification  
126
After you have a current financial statement, creating this projected 
statement should be much easier. Add income to the categories 
where you realistically think you’ll be pulling in more income (if 
any), and trim back in the expense categories where you realistically 
think you can save money. And don’t forget to account for that 
lower house payment resulting from the loan modification.
 
Remain very conscious of your debt ratios in your projected finan-
cial statement. We recommend a front-end ratio of 30 percent 
or lower. (The government’s Making Home Affordable program 
sets the target at no higher than 31 percent.) Your back-end ratio 
Knowing what your lender 
needs to say “Yes”
Serena decided to go after a loan modification alone. She contacted her lender, 
who gathered her financial information over the phone. A couple of weeks later, 
she received the bad news: “At this time there are no workout options available 
to you based on your current financial information provided to us.” In other words, 
“You can’t afford the home, so move!” Serena called us instead.
We sat down with Serena and carefully examined her finances. Immediately we 
discovered $85 per week she was receiving in rent. When we asked whether she 
had reported this income to her lender, she said, “No.” She hadn’t realized that the 
rent was an acceptable source of income; she assumed the only income she could 
claim was job-related. This extra $85 per week meant Serena had an additional 
$340 per month to apply toward her monthly payment.
Serena’s only mistake is that she didn’t know what to ask the lender. But how would 
she have known? She doesn’t do loan modifications for a living, and the lender 
never told her exactly what qualifies as an “acceptable source of income.” As a 
result, Serena supplied incomplete information to the lender, and the lender based 
its bad decision on this bad information.
When completing your loan modification application or supplying information over 
the phone, be sure to ask what may seem like dumb questions to reveal the minor 
details that can make a huge difference. You may think you know what income 
means, but you really may not know what the lender considers income. (Many 
borrowers don’t know that cash gifts can also qualify as acceptable sources of 
income, as long as the givers sign affidavits stating that they’re giving the borrower 
a certain (specific) amount of money each month to help with the payments.)
In addition, if the lender denies your initial request for a loan modification, find out 
why, so you have a clearer idea of what the lender needs to know to say “Yes.” 
Request a second review of your case in order to give your lender an opportunity 
to make a good decision based on accurate and complete information.

 Chapter 8: Preparing and Submitting Your Application 127
should be in the 35–40 percent range. Turn to Chapter 2 for more 
about debt ratios and estimating an affordable house payment. 
You can calculate your debt ratios based on gross income, but it’s 
safer to base your calculations on net income.
If your lender doesn’t have a projected financial statement form 
for you to complete, use the form shown in Figure 8-3. This time, 
instead of filling in your current numbers, put your projected finan-
cials in the blanks.
Signing, Sealing, and Delivering
With hardship letter and financial statement(s) in hand (as 
explained earlier in this chapter) and all your supporting docu-
ments (see Chapter 6) stacked up and ready to go, you’re ready to 
package everything and submit it to your lender . . . or are you?
In the following sections, we show you how to carefully assemble 
all the components of your loan application and submit it to make 
absolutely sure everything arrives safely and in the proper format.
Arranging your documents
If your lender provides an application packet or checklist of items 
to include in your packet, arrange your documents in the order 
they appear in the list. If your lender doesn’t have such a list avail-
able, use the checklist provided here to arrange all items in your 
packet and make sure you’re including everything:
 
❏ Copy of this checklist showing all items included in the packet
 
❏ Hardship letter
 
❏ Current financial statement
 
❏ Projected financial statement
 
❏ BPO (broker’s price opinion), CMA (comparative market 
analysis), or appraisal if required.
 
❏ Proof of hardship (birth certificate, death certificate, medical 
bills, divorce papers, or bankruptcy papers, for example)
 
❏ Federal tax returns (for the last two years)
 
❏ W-2s (for the last two years)
 
❏ Pay stubs (for the last four pay periods)
 
❏ Bank statements (for the last four periods)

Part II: Kick-Starting the Process: Applying for a Loan Modification  
128
 
If you owe more on your property than you can sell it for, consider 
including a BPO, CMA, or appraisal from a local real estate broker. 
A BPO or CMA is an estimate of a property’s market value. Proof 
that your home is worth tens of thousands of dollars less than the 
amount you owe your lender shows that the lender will probably 
lose more money in foreclosure than by lowering your monthly 
payment. (Some states prohibit anyone other than an appraiser 
from offering home valuations. Your real estate broker should 
know whether she’s allowed to provide valuations and help you 
find a licensed appraiser, if you need one.)
Signing on the dotted lines
Flip through the papers you prepared for your application, particu-
larly the hardship letter and financial statement(s), and make sure 
you and any co-borrowers on the loan have signed and dated the 
documents.
 
If you’re submitting copies of tax returns that you prepared and 
submitted electronically, be sure your tax returns are signed and 
dated, too. You don’t need to sign other supporting documents, 
like W-2 forms or bank statements.
Labeling every page
Lenders are often bombarded with loan modification applications 
and may have trouble keeping track of all the documentation. An 
overworked customer service representative can easily drop a 
stack of applications, shuffling Smith’s paperwork with Smyth’s and 
throwing the entire process into utter chaos. To minimize the risk 
of mix-ups, print your last name, loan number, page number, and 
number of pages in the upper right corner of each page, like this:
Roberts, Loan #: 123456789, Page 1 of 27
Numbering the pages is a good idea because it helps the customer 
service rep keep all the pages in order and enables you to quickly 
reference items in the future. For example, if someone asks for 
income verification, you can tell him, “Look at page 14 of 27 to find 
a copy of my W-2s.” Simple and efficient is the name of the game. 
(If you have two loans with the same lender, make two separate 
packages and submit them separately.)
 
Print a sheet of sticker labels with your last name and loan number 
on them, and apply the stickers to the upper right corner of each 
page in your application packet. Then you just fill in the page num-
bers by hand.

 Chapter 8: Preparing and Submitting Your Application 129
Copying the entire packet
After you’ve arranged all documents in the proper order, copy 
the entire packet, so you have a complete set of everything you’re 
about to submit to your lender. If your application gets lost in tran-
sit or misplaced by the lender, you’ll have a backup copy. In addi-
tion, if your lender references a particular document in the future, 
you can easily refer to your copy of the document.
 
Send the originals of your hardship letter, financial statement, and 
any other documents you prepared specifically for this applica-
tion. For any other forms, such as your federal income tax return, 
W-2s, and bank statements, keep the originals and send copies.
Submitting your application
Finally! You’ve completed all the necessary forms, gathered all the 
supporting documentation, and copied everything. Now, you’re 
ready to mail, fax, e-fax, or scan and e-mail the documents.
 
Ask the lender for its preferred method of receiving the application 
(usually fax or shipping, such as U.S. Postal Service, UPS, or FedEx). 
If, upon following up with the lender, you discover that the lender 
has lost or misplaced all or part of your application package, con-
sider sending future submissions using multiple methods — fax, 
overnight shipping, and e-mail, for example. This approach may 
seem like overkill, and it probably is, but it also protects you. If 
one method of delivery fails, your lender receives the information 
another way. Some lenders even allow you to apply online by filling 
out a form, but you probably still need to ship or fax supporting 
documents. Print or save a copy of all electronically submitted 
forms for your records.
If possible, address the package (no matter what method you use) 
to the attention of a specific individual, preferably someone who 
knows the package is coming. Even if all applications wind up in 
the same department, your package is more likely to arrive on the 
desk of the intended recipient if it’s addressed to an individual 
than if you send it generically.
When shipping your application the old-fashioned way, spend a 
little extra for premium shipping, such as Priority Mail or Next 
Day Delivery, and request delivery confirmation and any available 
tracking information. Keep a record of the date and time you sent 
the application and the address of where you sent it.

Part II: Kick-Starting the Process: Applying for a Loan Modification  
130
When you mail the package, ask when it should reach its destina-
tion. The day after the package is scheduled to arrive, follow up 
with your lender to verify receipt of the package, and keep a written 
record of when you called, the number you dialed, and the person 
you talked with. Continue to follow up until your package is either 
confirmed received or confirmed lost in transit. For more about 
keeping the process on track and keeping records of everything, see 
Chapter 9.

Chapter 9
Keeping the Process on 
Track and on Time
In This Chapter
▶ Setting realistic expectations
▶ Logging everything
▶ Checking in and stepping in when necessary
▶ Keeping other options open
A
typical loan application takes 30 to 90 days to process. 
That gives you a whole lot of time to worry and wonder: 
Maybe they didn’t get my application. Did I remember to sign all 
the forms? Did my application get lost in the shuffle? What if they 
rejected it?
Regardless of whether you have an expert representing your inter-
est, your head is on the block, so feeling anxious is normal. In this 
chapter, we offer some suggestions on how you can alleviate some 
of that anxiety and remain proactive without becoming too intru-
sive. Here, we show you what you should be doing during that 30- 
to 90-day waiting period.
 
The 30- to 90-day period is the average time required to process 
a loan modification application and work out a deal. The more 
complex your situation and the more concessions the lender is 
required to make, the longer the process.
Knowing What to Expect
Automated phone systems often contain a message indicating the 
average hold time — something like, “Due to the volume of calls, 
all of our operators are busy at this time. The average wait time is 
three minutes.” The people who design these systems have real-
ized that people don’t mind waiting so much as long as they have 
some idea of how long they’ll have to wait.

Part II: Kick-Starting the Process: Applying for a Loan Modification  
132
The same is true when you apply for a loan modification. Knowing 
what to expect can significantly reduce your stress and alleviate 
any anxiety you may feel. Whether you’re dealing directly with 
your lender or a loan modification expert, ask these questions 
upfront:
 
✓ How long is the process likely to take? Find out the best- and 
worst-case scenarios, and then count out the days and mark 
them on your calendar.
 
✓ When can I expect to hear something about my case? Mark 
this date on your calendar.
 
✓ If I don’t hear anything by the specified date, whom should 
I contact? Get the person’s name, employee identification 
number (if available), phone number, and any extension you 
need to dial to reach the person directly.
Your lender should have a timeline for just about every step in the 
process and can probably even tell you how many days it takes for 
items you fax to get to where they need to be. Some lenders, for 
example, have a four-day delivery schedule for faxed items. Ask 
how long each step in the process takes. If a key date passes and 
you haven’t heard anything, follow up.
Documenting the Process 
for Your Records
When you’re trying to negotiate a loan modification, you bump 
into a lot of people, send and receive a good share of written cor-
respondence, and have plenty of conversations. Even people with 
photographic memories have a difficult time recalling and recount-
ing everything that happened, the names of the people they spoke 
with, the dates of calls, who said what, what they sent, how they 
sent it, and so on.
To improve your memory, use the Contact Log shown in Figure 9-1 
to log everything, including phone calls you placed, phone calls you 
answered, items you faxed, e-mail or snail mail correspondence, 
notices you received, items you shipped, payments you made, and 
any other attempts you’ve made to cure the default.
In the following sections, we provide some additional suggestions 
of how to keep a detailed record of your loan modification journey 
and verify everything you’re told with a reliable source.

Recording conversations
Audio-recording your telephone conversations may seem over the 
top, but if it’s legal in your state and you don’t find it too trouble-
some or creepy, capturing your conversations on tape provides 
you with the most detailed and accurate account of what each 
party agreed to. Your local bar association should be able to tell 
you whether recording your own telephone conversations is legal 
in your state (it usually is) and admissible in court.

Part II: Kick-Starting the Process: Applying for a Loan Modification  
134
If you can’t (or don’t want to) record your phone conversations, 
take detailed notes. Keep a notebook or legal pad along with a 
couple of pens or pencils next to your phone so you don’t have to 
search for them when the phone rings. After you hang up, fill in 
the details of what you talked about while the conversation is still 
fresh.
 
If you hired professional representation, you shouldn’t be talking 
details directly with your lender. Anything you say may generate 
confusion or compromise your representative’s ability to negotiate 
the best arrangement on your behalf.
Keeping copies
You’re likely to be sending and receiving plenty of letters and 
documents throughout the process, so keep a copy of everything 
you send and receive. That may seem obvious, but doing it right is 
more complex. Follow these recommendations:
 
✓ Print the date on everything you send and receive. Most 
people think of placing a date on outgoing correspondence, 
but it’s equally important to record the date you receive cor-
respondence. An office supply store may even have an inex-
pensive “Received” stamp for convenience.
 
✓ Keep the envelopes you receive. Staple the envelope to the 
document because the postage stamp is an accurate indica-
tion of when the document was mailed.
 
✓ Photocopy the envelopes you use to send documents to 
prove that you sent them to the correct addresses.
 
✓ Send everything with a return receipt request, especially 
when you’re sending something important like your loan 
modification application.
 
✓ If you send a fax, do so from a fax machine that prints a con-
firmation receipt to prove it went through and was received.
 
✓ Print copies of any e-mail correspondence sent or received.
 
✓ If you’re required to send certified money, keep the check 
or money order stub.
 
Create a separate file folder for all your records, and arrange docu-
ments by date — most recent first or most recent last doesn’t 
matter as long as you file documents consistently. Scanning docu-
ments and storing them on your computer is fine and provides an 
easy way to submit documents via e-mail, but keep backup paper 
copies in case your computer crashes.

 Chapter 9: Keeping the Process on Track and on Time 135
Cross-checking the “facts”
Over the years we’ve observed that homeowners are often fed 
misleading or even wrong information by sources that should know 
better. In one case, a bank informed the homeowners that they had 
six months to redeem their property (buy it back after the auction) 
when they really had an entire year. The six months were up, and 
the bank was ready to evict the homeowners, even though they had 
six more months to redeem their property or live in it rent-free!
The moral of this story is to verify everything your lender tells you 
to the greatest extent possible. For example, if your lender tells 
you the foreclosure sale that was scheduled has been adjourned, 
call your county sheriff’s office (or whoever’s in charge of foreclo-
sure sales in your area) and confirm it. Or ask your lender to con-
firm the adjournment in writing (via e-mail or fax).
Following Up with Calls 
and Correspondence
A proactive approach is typically more effective than a reactive 
one, so keep the process moving forward and check in with your 
lender (or the person you hired to represent you) occasionally 
to make sure everything is on track. In the following sections, we 
provide some suggestions for staying in touch by phone, fax, and 
e-mail.
Keeping in touch by phone
 
Time is of the essence, so call your lender or representative at 
least once a week to make sure everything is on track and every-
one has everything they need to keep your modification moving 
forward. If your lender is missing a document, or if anything else is 
holding up progress, you want to know about it sooner rather than 
later so you can provide whatever’s needed.
Maintain a list of direct phone numbers and extensions so you 
don’t have to weave your way through the automated system 
every time you call your lender. Don’t be surprised or get upset, 
however, if your contact is no longer on your case; due to turnover 
and the fact that many lenders automatically rotate cases every 30 
days or so, you may have to deal with someone new . . . which can 
sometimes be a good thing.

Part II: Kick-Starting the Process: Applying for a Loan Modification  
136
 
Some people like to keep a separate phone list on a sheet of paper 
inside their document folders, but this approach usually buries 
the list in a stack of other documents. For quick access to contact 
numbers, consider jotting down the information on the outside or 
inside of the folder. If you have someone’s business card, just tape 
it to the folder.
The tale of the lost hardship letter
Attention to detail often pays dividends, as demonstrated in this story about a hard-
ship letter that the lender apparently had trouble keeping track of.
The central character in this tale is a borrower who did everything by the book. 
He obtained a loan modification packet from the lender and completed everything 
exactly as instructed. He faxed the application and all the required documents and 
took extra steps to label and document everything — extra steps that probably 
saved him from foreclosure:
 ✓ He labeled everything with his last name, loan number, date, and page 
number.
 ✓ He printed a copy of the fax report showing how many pages were sent and 
received.
When he called to follow up on the status of his application, the representative 
informed him that the servicer had not received his hardship letter and the modifi-
cation was stalled or inactive until the borrower submitted that document.
He retrieved his copy of the package he submitted. Sure enough, marked as page 
3 of 18 was his hardship letter. He also retrieved a copy of the fax report confirming 
that the lender’s fax had indeed received it.
Picking his battles, the borrower resubmitted the hardship letter. He included a 
cover page with his name, loan number, and the date; a cover letter explaining the 
purpose of this transmission; and a copy of the fax report confirming receipt of the 
original packet. As before, he labeled every page with his last name, loan number, 
date, and page number, and he printed a copy of the fax report.
A couple of days later, he called to check the status of his modification and was 
told again that his file was missing a hardship letter. Keeping his cool, the borrower 
explained that he had sent it . . . twice. He offered to resend the hardship letter 
again, but he also explained that the first time he sent it, it was page 3 of 18, and 
the second time it was page 3 of 4.
Who knows whether the organized nature of the borrower or the weight of the 
evidence that the hardship letter was actually received caused the representative 
to mysteriously locate the document or process the modification without it. All the 
borrower cared about was that his loan modification request was received and 
approved, and it was.

 Chapter 9: Keeping the Process on Track and on Time 137
Sending or faxing a letter
To create a comprehensive paper trail of all communication you’ve 
had with the lender, consider following up every phone conversa-
tion with a fax or e-mail message that recounts the conversation. 
For example, if the loss mitigation representative instructs you to 
submit your financial statements and a copy of your credit report 
and an appraisal within 30 days so that she can complete your loss 
mitigation file, your letter should recap all those points, like this:
Per your instructions to me in our phone conversation on 
February 26, 2012, I will be submitting to you within 30 days:
 
• My completed financial statements
 
• A copy of my latest credit report
 
• A copy of the latest appraisal on my house
As I understand it, this is the only information you still need to 
complete my file.
 
Always include your name and loan number on every piece of 
correspondence. If you hand-write the letter, make sure it’s clear 
and legible. When you do finally submit the required documents, 
attach a cover letter that states you’re fulfilling the request made 
on February 26, 2012, including a statement like this:
Attached you will find: my completed financial statements, a 
copy of my credit report, and a copy of the appraisal on my 
house.
If you ever need to prove when an item was sent or what you were 
told to do, you have a nice neat paper trail to support your contact 
log from Figure 9-1.
Remaining in the loop via e-mail
E-mail messages enable you to create a sort of paper trail (albeit an 
electronic one), but be careful not to accidentally delete an e-mail 
message or overlook any messages requiring you to act quickly. To 
manage your e-mail correspondence with your lender most effec-
tively, consider the following tips:
 
✓ Create a separate folder to store all your incoming e-mail 
messages from your lender.
 
✓ Set up an e-mail filter in your e-mail program to route incoming 
e-mail from your lender to the new folder you created.

138
 
✓ Print copies of important e-mails and file them chronologically 
in your loan modification folder with all your other records.
 
As soon as you receive and read a message instructing you to do 
something related to your loan modification, do it. It’s too easy 
to read a message and then forget about it. If you’re not able to 
perform the task right away, flag the e-mail or mark it as unread so 
you don’t lose it in the sea of other e-mails that need answering.
Dealing with Lender Delays
While some lenders do a good job of expediting the loan modifica-
tion process, others don’t. Intentionally or unintentionally, they 
delay the process until the option falls through the cracks and the 
homeowners lose their home. We don’t know precisely how often 
this happens, but for some lenders it’s all too common.
In one case reported in the national media, a lender actually admit-
ted in court that although it was running advertisements declar-
ing its willingness to help struggling homeowners and despite its 
founder and CEO having testified in front of Congress that the com-
pany was making modifications a priority, it had no obligation or 
intention of modifying its customers’ mortgages!
As a consumer, you have very little recourse other than hiring an 
attorney to add some pressure to your lender (see Chapter 4). If 
you’re flying solo, the best you can do is keep in touch with the 
lender and try to keep the process moving forward. Here are some 
recommendations:
 
✓ Track dates on which you were told you would hear some-
thing. If the date passes and you receive no word from the 
lender, call to find out what’s going on.
 
✓ If your lender has a practice of rotating its customer service 
reps, submit a written request to have your case handled by 
one representative from start to finish.
 
✓ If the representative assigned to your case is unresponsive, 
ask to speak with the person’s supervisor. If service doesn’t 
improve, speak with the supervisor again and request that 
your case be transferred to a different representative.
 
✓ Make sure you’re dealing with the right department. The 
general customer service representative is probably not the 
person you need to speak with to get answers. You need to 

 Chapter 9: Keeping the Process on Track and on Time 139
talk to a loss mitigation expert. Ask to speak with this person 
early on in the conversation or you’ll find yourself having to 
repeat everything when you get transferred.
 
✓ If you believe that your lender is delaying the process, 
contact your state attorney general and other consumer 
advocacy agencies listed in Appendix A.
Negotiating an Extension 
or Adjournment
Don’t be surprised if you continue to receive delinquency notices 
or late-payment phone calls during the modification process. 
Lenders rarely stop the foreclosure process until a workout solu-
tion is fully signed and in place. Ask your lender if your attempts to 
negotiate a solution will stop or at least postpone other collection 
actions.
If pursuing a repayment plan with your lender doesn’t put a stop 
to collection activities or foreclosure actions, find out what that 
means for you. If the lender is able to foreclose in 30 days, but the 
proposed workout can take up to 90 days, you’re obviously facing 
some serious timeline issues.
So, what can you do about it? Following are some suggestions for 
negotiating an extension or adjournment of the foreclosure process:
 
✓ Push your lender to have all collection and foreclosure 
activities put on hold while your workout attempts are 
underway, and get any agreement in writing. If your lender 
doesn’t provide a written agreement, send a follow-up letter 
or e-mail confirming what you were told so you have some-
thing in writing.
 
✓ If you’ve hired professional representation, ask your rep-
resentative to explain what she’s doing to postpone collec-
tions and foreclosure actions.
 
✓ Hire an attorney to contact your lender on your behalf to 
explain that you’re currently in the process of negotiating 
a solution and to request that the lender put a hold on col-
lections and foreclosure actions until you’ve had sufficient 
time to negotiate an agreement. A foreclosure attorney who 
represents homeowners is usually the best person for the 
job. (For more about selecting and working with an attorney, 
check out Chapter 4.)

Part II: Kick-Starting the Process: Applying for a Loan Modification  
140
 
Get any agreement between you and the lender in writing. Also, 
be aware that postponing the foreclosure may cost the lender 
money. The lender is likely to add the cost of the stayed foreclo-
sure to the principal balance when calculating the terms of your 
loan modification agreement. This price, even if you have to pay 
it, is likely to be less than the cost of you losing your house. Think 
about it, and pick your battles.
In the Meantime: Exploring 
Other Options 
Applying for a loan modification doesn’t mean you’ll get one. 
Plenty of lenders reject requests for assorted reasons — usually 
because the applicant fails to submit complete and verifiable infor-
mation, fails to meet the eligibility requirements, or has insufficient 
income to afford a reasonable lower monthly payment. In short, 
don’t count on your lender to accept and approve your applica-
tion, even if your chances are very good.
 
Plan for the worst, and continue to explore other options. If the 
lender denies your request for a loan modification or is unwilling 
to negotiate an agreement you’re willing to accept, what are you 
going to do? What’s your plan B? If plan B fails, what’s your plan C?
In addition, just because you applied for a loan modification 
doesn’t mean it’s the best option for you. Other options presented 
in Chapter 3 may be even better. Instead of letting your stomach 
get all tied up in knots waiting for your lender to decide your fate, 
take control of your own destiny. Consult a real estate broker 
about listing your home for sale. Talk to a mortgage broker or loan 
officer about refinancing. Speak with a bankruptcy attorney to find 
out whether filing bankruptcy would be a better choice.
 
Spend some time getting your finances in order. Regardless of 
whether your loan modification goes through, having a solid cost-
cutting budget in place is key in regaining your financial footing 
and improving the long-term success of any option you choose.

Part III
Hammering Out the 
Details with Your 
Lender

In this part . . .
I
n our business, we examine plenty of loan modifi cation 
offers that lenders pitch to their customers. These 
offers are usually good news — the lender approved the 
request for a loan modifi cation! The bad news, however, is 
often hidden in the details — a monthly payment that’s 
not truly affordable, step-rate increases that raise the 
interest rate too soon or too fast, legal sleight of hand that 
strips the homeowners of their legal rights, and other 
clever tricks to part borrowers from their money.
In this part, we focus on the devil in the details to lead 
you past the most common pitfalls. We show you how to 
evaluate different loan modifi cation scenarios, closely 
examine your lender’s initial offer, spot common red fl ags, 
and negotiate a better, more affordable loan modifi cation.
Affordability is the word of the day. If your loan modifi cation 
doesn’t result in an affordable monthly payment, it’s not 
good for you or your lender.

f you’re like most people facing foreclosure, you’re pretty bitter 
and angry right now, and you may be tempted to direct all that 
anger at your lender and the person who originated your loan. 
Although they may deserve the full force of your wrath, losing con-
trol won’t get you any closer to negotiating a good deal. In fact, it 
could convince the lender to just hang up the phone. This chapter 
gives you a glimpse of the situation from the lender’s point of view 
and provides suggestions on how to collaborate to reach a mutu-
ally beneficial solution.
 
Regardless of who owns your loan (a bank or investors), you will 
usually be negotiating through your servicer (the company that 
collects and processes your monthly mortgage payment).
Looking at the Situation through 
Your Lender’s Eyes
You can optimize the outcome of your loan modification efforts by 
understanding your lender’s perspective. This enables you to take 
a collaborative rather than confrontational approach to resolving 
issues. As you proceed, keep the following insights in mind:

Part III: Hammering Out the Details with Your Lender  
144
 
✓ Your lender thinks that you obtained the loan and therefore 
you should honor the terms set forth in the original mortgage 
and promissory note. To overcome this expectation, you need 
to show that you experienced a hardship that has prevented 
you from honoring the original terms.
 
✓ Short of honoring the terms of the original agreement, your 
lender wants you to repay the amount you borrowed in full. 
Lenders tend to frown on requests for principal reductions.
 
✓ As a result of any loan modification, your lender is likely to 
collect less interest than under the original agreement, but it 
still wants to collect as much interest as possible.
 
✓ Before agreeing to a loan modification, your lender wants to 
know that you’re willing and able to honor the terms of the new 
agreement — that you can afford the lower monthly payments.
 
✓ This is loss mitigation. Your lender stands to lose either way. If 
the lender stands to lose less from the loan modification than 
from foreclosure, you have a very good chance of qualifying.
 
✓ Your lender’s loss mitigation department is probably over-
whelmed with requests for loan modifications. They don’t want 
problems or to deal with people they see as big headaches. 
By helping them solve the problem rather than adding to their 
problems, you significantly improve your chance to succeed.
 
Lenders are wary of borrowers bending the truth to qualify for 
loan modifications they don’t really need or qualify for. Remember, 
lying on a loan or loan modification application is a crime. Don’t 
try to bend the truth or fudge the numbers to qualify.
Practicing the Three C’s of 
Working with a Loss Mitigator
Banks that own mortgage loans typically have loss mitigators to 
make sure the bank loses as little money as possible from bad 
mortgage loans. The loss mitigator can assist you in exploring 
options and implementing whichever option you agree on.
No matter how cold and calculating a loss mitigator may seem, 
he’s a human being who appreciates being treated with respect 
and courtesy. If the loss mitigator has three bad loans to deal with 
and you’re the only borrower acting civilly, you increase your 
chances of being the one person the loss mitigator assists.
To deal effectively with a loss mitigator, practice the three C’s as 
discussed in the following sections:

 Chapter 10: Discussing Loan Modification Scenarios with Your Lender 145
 
✓ Communication
 
✓ Composure
 
✓ Credibility
 
If you doubt your ability to adhere to the three C’s, hire profes-
sional representation, as described in Chapter 4.
The first C: Communication
“No” means “know,” as in the person you’re negotiating with 
doesn’t yet “know” enough to say “yes.” This is why communica-
tion is so important in achieving optimum results through a loan 
modification. Many loan modification applications are rejected out-
right because of the following:
 
✓ The paperwork is unclear. Rather than trying to decipher a 
cryptic application, a loss mitigator may simply delete the 
application or stack it in the “I’ll get to this when I can” pile — 
the pile he never seems to get to.
 
✓ The loss mitigator fails to understand that foreclosure will 
cost significantly more than a loan modification.
 
✓ Based on the information you supply in your hardship letter 
or financial statement, over the phone, or through other com-
munications, the loss mitigator believes you don’t qualify for 
a loan modification or don’t have sufficient income to afford a 
reasonable monthly payment.
 
✓ Based on your attitude, the loss mitigator believes you’ll end 
up in default even with a loan modification, or he believes 
you’re just too much trouble to deal with.
A loss mitigator’s decision is based primarily on the information 
you provide. Make sure the information clearly communicates 
your situation and your commitment to keep your house.
Remember that in many cases the loss mitigator is rewarded for 
the number of loans he can get to perform, so working out a deal 
with you is in his best interest. Approach the mitigator as a team-
mate; you, your lender, and the mitigator should all be working 
together toward a resolution that benefits all of you.
 
Work with the loss mitigator as best you can, but remember that 
he doesn’t work for you — he represents the lender. A solution is 
usually available that works for everyone involved, but don’t let 
the loss mitigator dictate the solution. Gather your own informa-
tion so you aren’t at the mercy of what other people tell you.

Part III: Hammering Out the Details with Your Lender  
146
The second C: Composure
 
The loss mitigator can pull the plug on negotiations at any time, 
which places you at a distinct disadvantage. If the loss mitigator 
begins to think that you’re a pain in the shorts, he may decide 
that you’re more trouble than you’re worth and simply deny your 
request for a loan modification. After all, he has people lined up 
around the block waiting for loan modifications.
To achieve your goals, leave your anger and frustration at the 
door. They won’t do you any good, and they increase the possibil-
ity of derailing your efforts. Prove that you’re a rational human. 
Pretend you’re Spock. Act calm, cool, and collected.
The third C: Credibility
This may sound callous, but a loss mitigator probably doesn’t 
want to listen to your hard luck story. Sure, he requires a hardship 
letter and perhaps some proof that you’ve fallen on hard economic 
times, but beyond that, all you represent to him is a nonperform-
ing asset. He’s heard all the stories; all he wants now is the truth, 
and he’ll be more willing to work with you if you’re straight with 
him. Following are some tips on how to build your credibility:
 
✓ Come clean. The loss mitigator is likely to pull up records 
and may order a credit report to check your story. If it 
doesn’t pan out, you instantly lose credibility. Remember 
that repeating the truth is easier than repeating lies. Stick 
with the true story — that’s the one you’ll never forget.
 
✓ Act serious. People are losing money here, so act as though 
you care and have a sincere interest in righting a wrong, even 
if you did no wrong to contribute to the current situation. 
Show up on time for meetings and treat everyone you meet 
with respect.
 
✓ Honor your promises. Promise only what you can reasonably 
do, and then do it. If you can only pay $1,000 per month, it’s 
better to say that than to agree to pay $1,200 and default on it. 
Borrowers are often given only one chance to perform. If you 
default, you may not get a second chance.
 
People generally start out believing you until you do something 
that causes them not to believe you. Rebuilding trust is very dif-
ficult. If you don’t do what you’re supposed to, you may not get a 
next time.

 Chapter 10: Discussing Loan Modification Scenarios with Your Lender 147
Making Your Case during the 
Homeowner Interview
Computers make it far too easy to misrepresent reality. In chat 
rooms, a 50-year-old guy can pass himself off as a 16-year-old girl. 
Anyone with a desktop publishing program and a $100 printer 
can forge “official” documents and even produce phony pay stubs 
and W-2s. As a result of all this opportunity for misrepresentation, 
most lenders want to speak with you directly prior to approving 
your loan modification. They want to hear you explain what hap-
pened and how committed you are to keeping your home. They 
want a homeowner interview.
In the following sections, we show you how to prepare for your 
homeowner interview and present your case during the interview 
in the best possible light.
 
If you hire someone to represent your case, your representative 
is likely to conduct a brief interview prior to agreeing to represent 
you. These interviews are typically short and sweet (30 minutes or 
less); they bring your representative up to speed on your situation 
and give the person an opportunity to see if your story matches 
the numbers. If your representative conducts this initial interview, 
you probably won’t be interviewed by the lender.
Your lender may or may not require a homeowner interview. If 
your lender requests an interview, it simply wants to hear what 
went wrong, how you plan to fix it, and that you’re committed to 
Preventive loan modification? 
Forget about it
The goal of the loss mitigator is to lessen lender/investor losses, not to help you 
save money and build a nest egg. If you can afford your current payment, the lender 
is likely to deny your request for a loan modification. In the infancy of loan modifica-
tions, lenders were willing to modify without full documentation, which encouraged 
some unscrupulous homeowners to try to improve their financial positions at the 
expense of their lenders. As a result, most loss mitigation departments now require 
full documentation as a verification tool.
Long story short, if you’ve missed a couple of house payments and are current on 
everything else, including credit card payments, three car payments, and your boat 
payment, don’t even think about applying for a loan modification. Any application is 
likely to get branded with a big rubber stamp — DENIED!

Part III: Hammering Out the Details with Your Lender  
148
keeping your house. Credibility is key; if anything you say during 
the interview conflicts with information on your credit report or 
other documentation you submitted, you’re likely to be dead in the 
water.
 
If you suspect your lender or loan originator of wrongdoing during 
the origination of your loan, don’t tell your lender. Hire an attorney 
to present the facts rather than mere suspicions.
Prepping for your interview
The best way to prepare for your homeowner interview is to review 
your documents (see Chapter 8) and brush up on the facts of your 
case, including the financial hardship you experienced and the loan 
modification you need to regain your financial footing (see Chapter 8). 
You should be prepared to answer the following questions:
 
✓ What financial hardship have you experienced to make your 
house payment unaffordable?
 
✓ Have you missed any payments? If so, what is the total 
amount of the missed payments? How do you plan on catch-
ing up on missed payments?
 
✓ How do you propose to deal with your inability to make 
payments — loan modification, forbearance, sell the home, 
offer a deed in lieu of foreclosure, or something else? (See 
Chapters 3 and 7 for details about your options and what to 
ask for.)
 
✓ What, if anything, have you done so far to remedy the 
situation?
 
✓ How committed are you to keeping your home? How would 
you feel if you were to lose your home?
 
Do some research to determine what your lender stands to lose 
from foreclosure versus loan modification. Chapter 12 walks 
you through the process of calculating and comparing the two 
amounts.
Presenting your case
Assuming you prepared properly for your homeowner interview, 
the interview itself is anticlimactic. You simply lay the facts on the 
table, answer questions to the best of your ability, and express 
your sincere interest in doing what’s necessary to keep your house.

 Chapter 10: Discussing Loan Modification Scenarios with Your Lender 149
 
Even though lenders often have much more to lose from foreclo-
sure than from a modification, many would still prefer to end their 
relationships with borrowers who can’t honor the terms of their 
original mortgages. We really can’t comprehend the reasons for 
this, but it’s obviously the case. Even though an affordable loan 
modification is usually so much better for the lender, the federal 
government practically had to twist the arms of major mortgage 
lenders to convince them to start modifying loans.
A pleasant twist
When negotiating the terms of a loan modification, the best approach is to be care-
ful about what you ask for. The lender may surprise you with a better offer than you 
had ever imagined, which actually happened with one homeowner we knew — an 
investor who owned several investment properties out of state.
The investment properties were financed using adjustable-rate loans, and the 
adjustments were causing significant payment woes. The investor came to the 
conclusion that he would have to liquidate the investment properties or risk losing 
his primary residence, too. The value of the investment properties had dropped 
significantly as a result of the market downturn, so the investor contacted his 
lender about securing short sales on these properties. He gathered all the infor-
mation about the lender’s requirements and jumped through all the hoops, but the 
lender continued dragging its feet — it couldn’t stomach the values it would have 
to accept to make the short sales happen.
The lender took a look at the numbers on all the properties and decided that short 
sales would be possible for some properties that had retained their value. No sur-
prise there. On one of the properties that had lost a substantial amount of value, 
however, the lender proposed a jaw-dropping loan modification, reducing the 
payments on a $660,000 investment property to $600 per month, at least temporar-
ily. To achieve this low monthly payment, the lender slashed the interest rate and 
accepted interest-only payments for several years. The lender simply decided it 
would be less costly and in its own best interest to keep the investor on the hook 
for the debt than to foreclose or accept a short sale. The investor hopes that the 
reduced payments will minimize the burden long enough to allow the market value 
of the property to recover.
This isn’t a typical loan modification, but when the situation is right and lenders are 
staring huge potential losses in the face, they can become very creative, even to 
the point of being generous in their offerings.

Examining the MHA Initiative
As the foreclosure crisis deepened, servicers, lenders, and inves-
tors were all scrambling for solutions and developing their own 
workout plans and eligibility requirements. On March 4, 2009, all 
that changed when the United States Treasury adopted President 
Obama’s Making Home Affordable (MHA) initiative. By adopting 
this plan, the Treasury hopes to standardize the guidelines, eligi-
bility requirements, and workout solutions throughout the mort-
gage lending industry.
 
The MHA initiative provides a good model for how to structure a 
workout, so we include it here as an example. Keep in mind, how-
ever, that the guidelines and how lenders implement the plan are 
likely to change over time and vary among lenders. In addition, all 
lenders and investors may not be required to adopt the plan. In 
other words, your lender is likely to have a system in place similar 
to the one described here, but be prepared to deal with variations.
The MHA initiative provides two forms of relief for distressed 
homeowners: refinancing and loan modification. In the following 
sections, we describe the two components of the MHA initiative.
 
Not all homeowners automatically qualify for refinancing or loan 
modification under the MHA plan, and not all lenders and investors 
are required to abide by the plan (at least not at the time we were 
writing this book). Check with your lender and visit www.making
homeaffordable.gov to find out more about eligibility require-
ments. If you don’t qualify, you can explore other options with 
your lender, as described in Chapter 3.
Refinancing your loan
For “responsible homeowners” (those who have been making their 
payments on time), the MHA initiative offers a refinancing compo-
nent to lower their monthly payments and convert any high-risk 
loans, such as interest-only loans or adjustable-rate mortgages 
(ARMs), into lower-risk, fixed-rate loans. Part of the idea here is to 
help homeowners before they find themselves in crisis.
The MHA initiative recognizes that many homeowners can’t take 
advantage of low interest rates because their loan-to-value (LTV) 
ratios are too high for them to qualify for a refinance loan. (See 
Chapter 3 for more about LTV and refinancing.) Most lenders want 
to see an LTV of 80 percent or lower before they consider approv-
ing a refinance loan.

 Chapter 10: Discussing Loan Modification Scenarios with Your Lender 151
Given the fact that property values have dropped as much as 25 
percent or more in some areas of the U.S., many homeowners have 
seen their LTVs rise above 80 percent (for example, they owe more 
than $80,000 on a home that’s worth $100,000). In addition, many 
subprime loans started off with a loan balance above 80 percent 
LTV, which means refinancing for this class of borrower is difficult 
to impossible. The MHA initiative is designed to help more home-
owners qualify for refinancing.
 
If you’re current on your mortgage loan and don’t qualify for a loan 
modification, refinancing can be an attractive option. By refinancing 
into a loan with a lower interest rate, you can save hundreds of dol-
lars per month and thousands per year. For example, on a $200,000 
30-year mortgage, an interest reduction from 8 percent to 6 percent 
drops the monthly payment by $268.43 — an annual savings of 
$3,221.16 and a whopping $96,634.80 over the life of the loan.
Modifying your loan
The loan modification component of the MHA initiative allocates 
$75 billion for at-risk homeowners, many of whom are stuck in 
adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) and have seen their house pay-
ments rise to 40 or even 50 percent of their monthly incomes.
The program offers cash incentives to lenders and borrowers for 
working out loan modifications that result in reasonable, afford-
able payments and enable the homeowners to keep their homes. 
Under the initiative, the lender and Treasury Department team up 
to reduce the monthly mortgage payment to an affordable level, 
defined as no greater than 31 percent of the household’s gross 
monthly income. (See the following section “Structuring a Loan 
Modification” for details on these and other specifics of a 
loan modification.)
Structuring a Loan Modification
Even with a standard system in place, such as MHA, many vari-
ables are involved in structuring a loan modification. The two 
primary areas of focus deal with making the house payment 
affordable and catching up on deficiencies. You also need to 
attend to some details in structuring your loan modification. In 
the following sections, we provide guidelines to assist you in 
structuring a reasonable and affordable loan modification with 
your lender.

Part III: Hammering Out the Details with Your Lender  
152
 
The process of structuring the loan modification can vary. In 
some cases, the lender or servicer gathers the details, reviews the 
application, and structures the deal without any additional input 
from you. In other cases, the borrower and the lender may work 
together to negotiate the details. Afterwards, in either case, the 
lender presents an offer in writing (as discussed in Chapter 11), 
which provides you with another opportunity to review the details 
and negotiate any outstanding issues.
Making the house payment 
affordable
Regardless of whether your lender adopts the MHA guidelines 
(voluntarily or involuntarily), the guidelines provide a very good 
model for achieving an affordable house payment.
The goal of the MHA plan is to establish an affordable payment, 
so the front-end DTI (debt-to-income) ratio is no higher than 31 
percent. This means your monthly payment is no more than 31 
percent of your gross monthly income (or household income if 
you and your partner are listed as co-borrowers on the note). If 
you earn $5,000 per month, your house payment (principal, inter-
est, taxes, insurance, and association fees) can be no higher than 
$1,550:
$5,000 × 0.31 = $1,550
 
We recommend a front-end DTI ratio no higher than 30 percent, 
but the MHA recommendation is pretty much on target. (For more 
about DTI ratios and how to calculate them, check out Chapter 2.)
The MHA plan also takes into consideration the back-end DTI 
ratio — the percentage of a household’s gross monthly income 
that goes toward making all monthly debt payments, including 
minimum payments on credit card accounts and auto loans. If 
the back-end DTI exceeds 55 percent, homeowners are required 
to sign a statement pledging to obtain credit counseling as a pre-
requisite for obtaining the loan modification.
 
If you still have a back-end DTI ratio higher than 55 percent after 
the loan modification reduces your front-end DTI to 31 percent, 
you probably have a lot of unsecured debt, like credit card debt. 
In this case, we advise that you speak to a bankruptcy attorney 
before signing any agreements with your creditors (anyone to 
whom you owe money). Chapter 3 discusses the bankruptcy 
option in greater detail. To find out even more about bankruptcy, 
check out Personal Bankruptcy Laws For Dummies, 2nd Edition, by 
James P. Caher and John M. Caher (Wiley).

 Chapter 10: Discussing Loan Modification Scenarios with Your Lender 153
Catching up on deficiencies 
and penalties
If you have any late or missed payments, your loan modification 
must address how you’ll catch up on these payments and any pen-
alties or fees that the lender is charging you. (Under the MHA plan, 
lenders must drop any late fees and penalties.)
 
Push to have any penalties and fees dropped rather than capi-
talized. When you’re already struggling to keep up, your lender 
shouldn’t bury you deeper in debt with penalties and fees.
Following are common options you can discuss with your lender 
or the person representing you:
 
✓ Capitalization: Your lender can roll any missed payment 
amounts along with late fees and penalties (if applicable) into 
the balance and then re-amortize (recalculate) your payments.
 
✓ One-time payment: If you have some extra money lying 
around (yeah, right), you can pay off the amount in full.
 
✓ Payment plan: The lender may be able and willing to set up a 
separate payment plan to help you catch up. Of course, this 
arrangement is only practical if you have enough monthly 
income to absorb an additional monthly payment.
 
✓ HSA loan: Fannie Mae has a HomeSaver Advance (HSA) pro-
gram that allows lenders to provide an advance to homeown-
ers to enable them to catch up on past-due amounts. Penalties 
and fees are not included in the past-due amount, and the loan 
is up to 15 percent of the unpaid principal balance or $15,000, 
whichever is less. The loan isn’t secured by the property, 
bears a 5-percent fixed rate of interest, requires no payments 
for the first six months, and matures in 15 years.
Addressing interest-rate issues
Until recently, homeowners often focused too much on the 
monthly payments the lenders were dangling in front of their 
noses. They should have been looking at the current and projected 
interest rates just as closely. When you’re getting your loan modi-
fied, here’s what you need to know and do regarding interest rates:
 
✓ Check the current mortgage interest rates to make sure 
you’re getting a fair deal. You can look up interest rates at 
www.bankrate.com as well as many other Web sites.
 
✓ A low introductory rate is good — the lower the better.

Part III: Hammering Out the Details with Your Lender  
154
 
✓ It’s normal for a lender to step up the rate later. Just make 
sure the steps are gradual and your monthly payment is still 
affordable at the cap (the upper limit).
 
✓ Beware of modifications that offer a float rate instead of a 
step rate. If the rate floats with the margin plus index after a 
short low-interest introductory period, this fix could cause 
serious problems later, just like ARMs did.
 
✓ Opt for a fixed-rate loan. The lender may still step up the rate 
over the course of several years, but the steps are predictable 
(not tied to a fluctuating index), so you can plan for them.
 
✓ Don’t let the lender set you up in an interest-only modifica-
tion. These loans are interest-only for a limited time. The shell 
shock comes later when you have a balloon payment (a large 
chunk of change due all at once) or have to start paying down 
the principal along with interest.
Request Denied: Now What?
Your lender or servicer can deny your loan modification request 
for any number of reasons. If your request is denied and you’re still 
committed to keeping your home, consider the following options:
 
✓ Appeal. Ask to speak with a loss mitigation supervisor, who 
may have greater authority to make an exception.
 
✓ Explore your legal options, as explained in Part IV of this 
book. If your lender or the person originating the loan vio-
lated certain consumer protection or lending laws, they may 
be required to rewrite your mortgage loan.
 
✓ If your mortgage is investor-owned rather than bank-owned 
and you’ve experienced extenuating circumstances (such as 
contracting a serious medical condition), ask to have your 
case reviewed by the portfolio manager. If you really want 
to push to have a portfolio manager review your file, you may 
need to hire an attorney or mortgage expert to put your case 
in front of the portfolio manager.
 
The MHA plan guidelines (see “Examining the MHA Initiative” 
earlier in this chapter for details) changed the rules for many 
of the big lenders and servicers, referred to in the industry as 
Megas, but it didn’t (initially at least) force investors to comply, 
so if your mortgage is investor-owned rather than bank-owned, 
appealing any denial could be much more challenging. If the inves-
tor that owns your mortgage didn’t accept TARP (Troubled Asset 
Relief Program) money from the federal government, it may not 
be required to follow MHA guidelines, and it certainly has greater 
power in denying any request for a loan modification.

L
enders are odd creatures. They help put you in a loan you 
can’t possibly afford, and then when you prove you couldn’t 
afford it, many of them try to negotiate you into a modification you 
can’t possibly afford. Understandably, their goal is to maximize 
their profit, but in the pursuit of this goal, they often lose money 
by negotiating terms that put homeowners back on the road to 
default and ultimately foreclosure.
Because your lender is unlikely to present an opening offer with 
the best possible terms the lender can afford, be prepared to eval-
uate the initial offer carefully. This chapter points out the pitfalls 
you need to watch out for. After you work through your evaluation, 
check out Chapter 12 for tips on negotiating a better offer.
Deciphering a Loan Modification 
Agreement
Attorneys have their own language. From a distance, it looks an 
awful lot like English, but upon closer inspection, it reads more like 
Egyptian hieroglyphics. Yes, we’re well aware that the goal is to 
ensure that the language remains very precise, but it can befuddle 
even the most sophisticated consumers.
Fortunately, loan modification agreements are relatively short — 
shorter than the mortgages they modify. In Foreclosure Self-Defense 

Part III: Hammering Out the Details with Your Lender  
156
For Dummies (Wiley), we provide a primer on how to decipher a 
mortgage document, promissory note, and other closing and pre-
closing documents. In the following sections, we highlight and 
explain key clauses in loan modification agreements.
 
Don’t sign a legal agreement unless you’ve read it, fully understand 
it, and agree to adhere to everything it states. If you don’t fully 
understand everything, ask your lender to explain it to you, and 
keep asking questions until you grasp the meaning. If you disagree 
with a provision in the agreement, do your best to have it removed 
or changed, or be sure you can live with it before you sign on the 
dotted line. If your lender is unable to clear up any confusion you 
may have, you may need to consult an attorney.
Checking the reference to 
your former mortgage
By definition, a loan modification modifies the terms of an existing 
legal agreement; that existing legal agreement is the mortgage or 
deed of trust that names the property as security for repayment 
of the debt (the note). Almost every loan modification agreement 
starts out by referencing that pre-existing loan agreement. The lan-
guage may look something like this:
This loan Modification Agreement (“Agreement”), made this 
25th day of February, 2012, between Basil Floret and Sandy 
Floret (the “Borrower(s)”) and Applewide Home Loans 
Servicing LP (the “Lender”), amends and supplements (1) 
the Mortgage. Deed of Trust, or Deed to Secure Debt (the 
“Security Instrument”), dated the 12th day of January, 2005, 
and recorded on the 12th day of January, 2005, in the Official 
Records of County, in the State of MI, and (2) the Note and 
Adjustable Rate Rider bearing the same date as, and secured 
by, the Security Instrument, and (3) any prior agreements 
or modifications in effect relative to the Note and Security 
Instrument which covers the real property described in the 
Security Instrument and defined therein as the ‘Property’, 
located at 20236 Cattle Drive, Boomtowne, MI 4882, collectively 
the prior documents shall be referred to herein as the “Note 
and Security Instrument”.
The real property described being set forth as follows:
“SAME AS IN SAID SECURITY INSTRUMENT”
The key phrase in this clause is “amends and supplements,” mean-
ing the original security instrument (mortgage or deed of trust) 
and the note remain in place except for any changes stipulated in 
this new agreement.

 Chapter 11: Evaluating Your Lender’s Initial Offer 157
 
Check your mortgage or deed of trust to ensure that your loan 
modification agreement is referencing the correct security instru-
ment. If anything in the reference to your mortgage or deed of trust 
(such as the date, your name, or the property address) is wrong, 
have the information corrected prior to signing anything.
Analyzing the unpaid balance
The loan modification agreement always establishes the amount 
of the unpaid principal balance. This is the amount you still owe on 
the loan, which may represent any of the following:
 
✓ Only the unpaid principal
 
✓ The unpaid principal plus any missed payments and penalties 
that will be capitalized (added to the unpaid principal)
 
✓ An amount lower than the unpaid principal, if the lender 
agreed to a principal reduction or principal forbearance (see 
Chapter 3 for more info on this and other options)
 
If your loan modification is made available through the federal 
government’s Making Home Affordable (MHA) plan, your lender 
or servicer is required to waive any late fees or penalties and is 
prohibited from charging a loan modification fee. (Chapter 10 gives 
you details on this plan.)
Following is a statement of the unpaid principal balance pulled 
from an actual loan modification document. When deciphering this 
clause, focus on the date and the amount of the unpaid principal 
balance. If the amount doesn’t match your records, contact your 
lender and find out why.
Amount of Borrower’s Unpaid Principal Balance
As of the 1st day of March, 2012, the amount payable under the 
Note and Security Instrument (the “Unpaid Principal Balance”) 
is U.S. $230,000.00, consisting of the amount(s) owed by the 
Borrower to the Lender and which may include, but are not 
limited to, any past due principal payments, interest, escrow 
payments, fees and/or costs (“Unpaid Amounts”) which the 
Borrower has agreed shall be capitalized (added to the amount 
the Borrower originally borrowed) as one of the terms of this 
agreement. Any late/delinquency fees associated with overdue 
loan payments remaining unpaid as of the date immediately 
before this modification have been waived and are not capital-
ized. The Borrower understands that capitalizing the Unpaid 
Amounts may result in the Borrower paying more interest over 
the life of the loan.

Part III: Hammering Out the Details with Your Lender  
158
 
Closely examine any wording that addresses capitalization 
because this is an area that’s open for negotiation. You may be 
able to convince the lender to drop any late fees and penalties and 
perhaps even forgive a portion of the missed payment total (part 
of the interest, anyway). You’re not likely to get off the hook for 
past-due principal or escrow payments, however.
Acknowledging the promise to pay
When you purchased the property and closed on the deal, you 
signed a promissory note pledging to pay back the loan in full with 
interest on the date the loan matures (comes due).
Your loan modification agreement is likely to contain a borrower’s 
promise to pay clause to reaffirm your commitment to pay back 
the loan. Just make sure the maturity date is correct. For example, 
if you’re signing the agreement in 2010 for a loan modification with 
a 30-year term, the maturity date should be 2040, not 2035.
 
Make sure your lender isn’t offering a loan modification in exchange 
for your agreement to pay off the note more quickly or as a balloon 
payment (a big lump sum that comes due on the maturity date). A 
balloon payment may be acceptable under two conditions:
 
✓ Your original mortgage called for a balloon payment.
 
✓ You and your lender have agreed to a principal forbearance, 
in which a portion of the principal is due on the maturity date 
(or earlier if you sell or refinance prior to the maturity date).
 
Ask your lender for a copy of the amortization table, showing how 
much of each payment is being applied to principal and interest. If 
your principal balance (including any capitalized delinquencies and 
penalties) is fully amortized, the final payment should show the bal-
ance being paid in full. It may be off by a few dollars and cents, but it 
should be close. Make sure that you don’t have a large balance due 
at the end of the term, unless that’s what you agreed to.
Inspecting the monthly 
payment details
Every loan modification agreement should state your projected 
monthly payment. Unfortunately, this information can become 
very complex depending on capitalization and interest rates. In 
many of these agreements, the lender doesn’t simply drop the 
interest rate from 10 percent to 4 percent, for example. That would 
be too easy.

 Chapter 11: Evaluating Your Lender’s Initial Offer 159
Lenders often prefer a more creative approach that provides a 
heavier dose of relief early on and then phases it out over time. For 
example, the lender may offer to drop the interest rate to 3.5 percent 
for the first year and then raise it each year until it hits 7.5 percent. 
As a result, your payment increases each year in what are known as 
step-rate adjustments. Here’s a typical monthly payment clause that 
stipulates only the initial monthly payment that’s subject to change:
Amount of Borrower’s Initial Scheduled Monthly Payments
As of the 1st day of April, 2012, the scheduled monthly pay-
ment will be in the amount of U.S. $780.00. The scheduled 
monthly payment may change on that day of every twelfth 
month thereafter as described in Section 4 of this Loan 
Modification Agreement. The Lender will notify the Borrower 
prior to the date of change in the scheduled monthly pay-
ment. The amount of the monthly payment may change if the 
Borrower makes voluntary prepayments of principal.
(A) Monthly Payment Changes
Changes in the monthly payment will reflect changes in the 
unpaid principal and in the interest rate that the Borrower 
must pay. The Lender will determine the changed amount of 
the monthly payment in accordance with Section 5 of this Loan 
Modification Agreement.
 
Step increases in the interest rate are normal. Just make sure the 
step increases are delayed for enough time to catch your breath, the 
steps are gradual, the cap (maximum interest rate) is reasonable, 
and the modification ultimately results in a mortgage with an afford-
able fixed rate. You don’t want a rate that steps up early and often. 
Your primary goal is to obtain a modification that keeps you in your 
home now and remains affordable for at least three to ten years, 
giving the market and the economy time to recover and providing 
you with sufficient time to improve your own financial situation.
 
When you’re trying to determine whether the proposed house pay-
ment is affordable, account for any escrow payments to cover prop-
erty taxes, insurance, and any homeowner association (HOA) fees. 
Under the MHA plan, all loans require escrow accounts, so house 
payments include principal, interest, taxes, insurance, and any 
association fees. If your lender doesn’t require you to escrow these 
amounts, we strongly encourage you to ask your lender to do so.
Wading through any interest 
rate adjustments
As mentioned in the previous section, lenders can become very 
creative when offering interest rate reductions. We’ve seen offers 

Part III: Hammering Out the Details with Your Lender  
160
from lenders that included annual hikes in the interest rate cou-
pled with a ten-year interest-only payment option. In other words, 
a homeowner would pay only interest on the mortgage for the first 
ten years and wouldn’t start paying down the principal until then.
We applaud the creativity of some lenders, but these sorts of offer-
ings often confuse consumers. You really need to examine the net 
effect of any interest rate adjustments on your monthly payment 
and principal. If the details aren’t presented clearly in the agree-
ment, ask the following questions:
 
✓ What is my interest rate going to be?
 
✓ Will my interest rate ever rise?
 
✓ On what dates is my interest rate scheduled to rise? These 
are often referred to as the change dates.
 
✓ How much will the interest rate rise on each date?
 
✓ How will the changes in my interest rate affect my payments? 
Make sure you get concrete information showing exactly what 
your monthly payments will be with each adjustment.
 
✓ What’s the cap (the highest the interest rate can rise)?
 
✓ What’s the absolute highest my monthly payment can be?
 
✓ Will I be notified in writing prior to the rate step? If so, how 
much time will I be given to prepare for the increase?
 
✓ If I have an interest-only period, how much will my payments 
be when I start paying principal?
 
✓ If I make my scheduled monthly payments as stipulated in 
the agreement, will I have paid the balance of the loan in 
full by the date on which the loan matures?
 
Your lender is unlikely to tell you the total you’ll be paying over 
the life of the loan, even if you ask. You can calculate this amount 
by using the formula in the following section. Use the same formula 
for your original loan for comparison purposes. If your new agree-
ment has you paying tens of thousands of dollars more in interest, 
you may want to negotiate.
Inspecting any term extension
Loan modifications often use term extensions to lower the monthly 
payment. For example, a $200,000 30-year mortgage at 7 percent 
interest has a monthly payment of $1,330.60. Extend it to 40 years, 
and the payment drops about $90 per month. In and of itself, a term 
extension probably won’t help save your home, but coupled with an 
interest rate reduction, it can make the monthly payment affordable.

 Chapter 11: Evaluating Your Lender’s Initial Offer 161
 
Unfortunately, over the life of the loan you can pay a heavy price 
for a term extension — $117,772 in the previous example, assuming 
you make only the minimum payment each month and pay on the 
loan until its maturity date. That’s a considerable amount of money 
for a $90 discount on your monthly payment. To determine the 
total cost of a loan over the life of the loan, multiply the monthly 
payment by the term (in years) by 12 months per year, as follows:
Cost of Loan = Monthly Payment × Term × 12
 
Even though a term extension can cost more over the life of the 
loan, we still recommend that most homeowners extend the term 
as long as possible. Why? Because extending the term gives you 
flexibility. You can pay extra toward the principal whenever you 
can afford it, but when you can’t afford it, you have the lower 
monthly payment to fall back on. Just make sure that when you 
pay extra, you specify that the extra amount be applied to principal. 
Then, check your statement to make sure it is.
 
If your original mortgage stipulates a prepayment penalty, try to 
have it removed with the loan modification agreement. Otherwise, 
by making additional principal payments, you could be costing 
yourself thousands in the form of a prepayment penalty. If the 
lender refuses to remove the penalty, just make sure the prepay-
ment penalty clause is reasonable in that it meets these criteria:
 
✓ The penalty is within the standard range of 1 to 3 percent of 
the total borrowed (the lower, the better). On a $200,000 loan, 
a “reasonable” prepayment penalty would be $2,000 to $6,000.
 
✓ The penalty phases out over 60 months or less.
 
✓ The penalty doesn’t apply to prepayment due to sale of the 
home.
Capitalizing or waiving penalties 
and other fees
As mentioned earlier in this chapter in the section “Analyzing the 
unpaid balance,” homeowners can typically catch up on late or 
missed payments in any of the following ways:
 
✓ Pay up in full.
 
✓ Catch up over the course of several months with an install-
ment plan.
 
✓ Catch up over the life of the loan by having the late and 
missed payments capitalized (added to the principal balance).

Part III: Hammering Out the Details with Your Lender  
162
If your loan modification is made available through the federal gov-
ernment’s MHA plan, your lender or servicer can’t charge you any 
additional fees or penalties. If your loan modification doesn’t fall 
under this plan, request that all fees be itemized. A $1,500 “other 
advances” fee may include all sorts of hidden fees that you might 
question if you knew what they were for. Try your best to have all 
penalties and fees waived rather than capitalized.
Steering Clear of Common Traps
Contracts tend to be one-sided. They’re almost always written in 
a way to protect the interests of the author of the contract while 
ignoring the interests of all other parties involved. This is one of 
the reasons you may want to hire an attorney or at least get the 
help of an independent loan modification expert or licensed con-
sumer credit counselor (see Chapter 4).
Loan modification agreements are no different; they’re legal con-
tracts primarily designed to protect the interests of the lender or 
investor who holds the mortgage note. Sometimes, lenders even 
try to gain new rights under the agreement. In other words, you 
need to watch your back. In the following sections, we point out 
some of the most common traps hidden in the legalese.
Dismissing the take it 
or leave it threat
Almost all loan modification agreements include a cover letter with 
some sort of phrasing that suggests you have two choices: take it 
or leave it. Here’s the way one lender likes to put it:
In order to take advantage of the options above, you must 
agree to the enclosed modification agreement and return it to 
us as indicated below.
In other words, discussion time is over. Take it or leave it. The 
same letter contains another slightly more subtle take-it-or-leave-it 
threat:
There are two ways you can resolve your past due amount of 
$9,000:
1. If you are able to pay the past due amount:
If you can pay back your past due amount and do not wish to 
add it to your loan balance, please contact us at [xxx] to make 
arrangements to pay this amount and receive new modifica-
tion documents.

 Chapter 11: Evaluating Your Lender’s Initial Offer 163
2. If you are NOT able to pay your past due amount:
Read and sign the enclosed modification. Accepting the 
enclosed modification will resolve your past due amount and 
authorize us to add the unpaid amount through February 2012 
to the principal balance of your loan. If you agree to the terms 
of this modification, your monthly principal and interest pay-
ment will be higher than it would have been had the past due 
amount not been added to your balance.
In other words, unless you can come up with $9,000 in a hurry, the 
deficiency will be capitalized into your unpaid principal balance. 
(The unstated third option would be to forgive the deficiency or a 
portion of it, but by the language used, that’s not an option.)
An even more sinister and deceptive take it or leave it threat 
comes in the form of what we like to refer to as the ticktock provi-
sion. The lender ships the loan modification agreement to you 
with a cover letter dated February 5 that arrives at your house on 
February 17, informing you that you have five days from the date 
of the letter (the 5th) to return the signed documents to the lender. 
This deadline gives you a whole 13 minutes to contemplate the 
terms of the modification agreement, sign it, have it notarized, and 
get it back in the mail to the lender. That’s right, time is running 
out on the opportunity for you to keep your home . . . tick . . . tock!
 
Even though the terms of just about every legal agreement are 
negotiable, the lender wants you to think that this agreement is 
nonnegotiable. Don’t fall for these common traps. As long as your 
lender has less to lose through a loan modification than through a 
foreclosure, you can safely bet that the lender is willing to negoti-
ate. (See Chapter 12 for negotiating strategies.)
Waving off legal waivers 
to your legal rights
Sometimes, lenders use loan modification as an opportunity to 
strip homeowners of some rights afforded to them under the law 
or through the original mortgage and note. Here’s an example from 
an actual loan modification agreement:
Borrowers Agreement to Assist with Lost, Misplaced, 
Misstated, Inaccurate or Missing Documents
In consideration of this Modification, the Borrower agrees that 
if any document related to the Note and Security Instrument 
and/or Modification is lost, misplaced, misstated, inaccurately 
reflects the true and correct terms and conditions of the loan 
as modified, or is otherwise missing, the Borrower will comply 

Part III: Hammering Out the Details with Your Lender  
164
with the Lender’s request to execute, acknowledge, initial and 
deliver to the Lender any documentation the Lender deems nec-
essary. If the original promissory note is replaced, the Lender 
hereby indemnifies the Borrower(s) against any loss associated 
with a demand on the original note. The Borrower agrees to 
deliver the Documents within ten (10) days after receipt by the 
Borrower of a written request for such replacement.
In other words, if the lender loses documents, you have ten days 
to replace them or help the lender create new ones. The reason 
lenders often try to insert this language is because mortgage lend-
ing has become so complex that mortgages, promissory notes, 
and other documents are often lost in the shuffle. Consumers have 
gotten wise to this fact and are beginning to use it to their advan-
tage, employing the produce the note strategy to delay foreclosure 
actions; see the sidebar of that name for the full story.
Warning! Shifting interest rates
Technically speaking, a loan modification that calls for steadily 
increasing interest rates (called step-rate increases) is not an 
adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) because the adjustments aren’t 
tied to any index over which you have no control. Instead, the 
lenders provide step-rate increases that start you off with a low 
interest rate (typically below the market rate). At scheduled inter-
vals, the rate is stepped up by a predetermined percentage up to a 
maximum rate, which then typically remains fixed over the life of 
the loan.
A step-rate modification isn’t all bad, especially if the percent-
age increase is low and the interval between adjustments is long, 
because the goal you set out to achieve is to make your payment 
affordable and keep your house.
 
Whenever the interest rate increases over time, you have a situa-
tion in which you need to modify your monthly budget with each 
rate increase. Make sure you know when an increase is coming so 
you can adjust your budget to accommodate your rising cost of 
living. See “Wading through any interest rate adjustments” earlier 
in this chapter for questions to ask your lender.
Ducking repeated defaults
More than half of all homeowners who receive a loan modification 
end up in the same situation within eight months of having their 
monthly payments lowered. The cause of recidivism (repeated 
defaults) can usually be traced back to one or a combination of the 
following:

 Chapter 11: Evaluating Your Lender’s Initial Offer 165
 
✓ The loan modification failed to result in a truly affordable 
monthly mortgage payment.
 
✓ The homeowners failed to address the root cause of their 
financial hardship, essentially falling back into old habits.
 
✓ The homeowners experienced another financial hardship.
In Chapter 16, we provide tips to help you avoid becoming a 
recidivism statistic. When you’re reviewing your lender’s offer, 
you have an opportunity to short-circuit one of the major causes 
of recidivism — a loan modification that doesn’t provide a truly 
affordable monthly payment.
Examine the terms of the agreement carefully in the light of your 
monthly income and expenses (see Chapter 2). If the proposed 
monthly house payment is unaffordable or makes your monthly 
budget so tight that you’re just one large car repair bill or one 
major medical expense away from default, return to the negotiating 
table to push for a better deal.
Produce the note
One foreclosure self-defense move that seems to be growing in popularity is the 
produce the note strategy, which can be quite effective in stopping foreclosure in 
its tracks and buying a homeowner more time to pursue other options. Implementing 
the strategy differs depending on whether you live in a state that follows a judicial 
or nonjudicial foreclosure process:
 ✓ In states that require judicial foreclosure, the lender must file suit to obtain 
permission to proceed with the foreclosure sale. This initiates a legal process 
in which you can simply demand that the lender produce the note — the prom-
issory note or IOU you signed when you took out the mortgage.
 ✓ In states that allow nonjudicial foreclosure (more than half the states in the 
U.S.), you receive a notice of intent from the lender prior to the foreclosure 
sale and the process occurs outside of the judicial system. You can bring your 
case inside the judicial system by filing your own lawsuit against the lender. In 
the course of the legal proceedings, you can demand that the lender produce 
the note.
Requesting that the lender produce the note challenges the lender to provide the 
document proving that you agreed to pay back the money, which isn’t always 
as easy as it sounds. If the judge is sympathetic to your case, she may order the 
lender to produce the note. Although most lenders can track down the required 
documents, this strategy can delay the legal proceedings for several weeks, giving 
you more time to pursue alternatives to foreclosure, as described in Chapter 3. A 
lender’s inability to locate the original note can create significant difficulties for the 
lender in proceeding with foreclosure.

Part III: Hammering Out the Details with Your Lender  
166
Neither you nor the lender wants to go through this process again, 
so do it right the first time. We offer suggestions on how to negoti-
ate a better deal in Chapter 12.
 
If you’re committed to keeping your home, we’re committed to 
arming you with the information and insight you need to make that 
happen through a loan modification or other solution. However, 
we encourage you to make an honest assessment of your situation. 
If you can’t afford the house unless the lender essentially gives 
it to you for free, you need to make alternate arrangements for a 
graceful exit. (See Chapter 3 for alternatives to loan modification.) 
Don’t obligate yourself to payments you can’t maintain.
I agreed to what?!
Selma obtained what she considered to be an affordable loan modification, and she 
did it all on her own. Unfortunately for Selma, lightning struck twice. Nine months 
later, she experienced another major financial setback, and her modified loan was 
no longer affordable. She needed another modification.
Unfortunately, when Selma signed that first loan modification agreement, she 
failed to read between the lines. She focused solely on the numbers — the lower 
fixed interest rate, the extended term, and the fact that she could catch up on the 
deficiencies over the life of the loan rather than having to pay them all at once. It 
looked like a great deal to her, and based solely on the numbers, it was a good deal. 
Unfortunately, this agreement included a clause stating that by accepting the modi-
fication, Selma was giving up the rights to any future loan modification. This isn’t 
typical. Many lenders leave open the possibility for borrowers to obtain another 
loan modification if a change in circumstances justifies it. As soon as Selma signed 
and submitted that modification, she relinquished that right over the life of the loan. 
Foreclosure was imminent.
You can learn an important lesson from Selma’s mistake: Don’t judge a loan modi-
fication solely by the numbers. Read the agreement word for word and have your 
attorney review it, explain it, and highlight and explain any key issues before you 
sign the document. Those tiny clauses can have huge ramifications in the future.

Y
our lender’s loan modification goal is to have you to pay as 
much as you can afford in monthly mortgage payments and 
eventually pay back the loan in full. Your goal is to pay as little as 
possible — a penny a month would be nice, yes?
Somewhere in between those two extremes is a reasonable solu-
tion that serves both your needs — keeping you in your home 
without making you feel like a servant to it, and enabling the lender 
to cut its losses and perhaps earn a reasonable profit.
In this chapter, we offer some guidelines to determine what’s 
“reasonable” for homeowners and lenders, and we reveal various 
strategies for gaining more of what you want and need while still 
enabling the lender to mitigate its loss.
Recommitting to a Reasonable 
Solution
Each party involved in a loan modification has his own idea of 
what “fair” looks like. Homeowners may think the fair option is 
to reduce the balance to the current value of the property and 
then re-amortize the mortgage at 3 percent interest. The lender, 
on the other hand, may see a fair deal as one that capitalizes the 
deficiencies, penalties, and fees (meaning adds them to the unpaid 
balance) and drops the interest rate to 4 percent for three years, 
followed by incremental increases up to market rates. Usually, 
what’s fair falls somewhere in between.

168
Fortunately, the United States Department of the Treasury pro-
vides some guidelines for determining what’s fair and is likely to 
result in an affordable monthly mortgage payment. In the following 
sections, we cover the government guidelines in place during the 
writing of this book. These guidelines may change, but they still 
provide excellent parameters for determining what’s fair for home-
owners as well as for lenders or investors.
 
The federal government has rolled out a new Web site designed to 
help homeowners determine what an acceptable monthly payment 
looks like: www.makinghomeaffordable.gov. The calculator on 
this site is based on the premise that 31 percent of a household’s 
gross monthly income is a “fair” and sustainable amount to pay on 
a mortgage loan. Visit the site and see what the federal government 
thinks is “fair” for your household. For more about the Making 
Home Affordable (MHA) program, check out Chapter 10.
 
The MHA program applies to all government-insured loans (includ-
ing FHA and VA loans), loans owned by Fannie Mae and Freddie 
Mac, and loans owned by lenders who choose to participate in the 
program.
What’s fair for homeowners
According to the MHA guidelines, a fair deal for homeowners 
means an affordable house payment, and the Treasury Department 
determines affordability based on debt-to-income (DTI) ratios. 
(See Chapter 2 for details on how to calculate your DTI ratios.) 
According to MHA guidelines, any loan modification should meet 
the following DTI ratio requirements:
 
✓ Front-end DTI ratio must not exceed 31 percent. The 
monthly mortgage payment resulting from the loan modifica-
tion (including monthly principal, interest, taxes, insurance, 
and homeowner association fees) must be no greater than 31 
percent of the monthly gross household income.
 
✓ Back-end DTI ratio must not exceed 55 percent. The total 
monthly debt payments (including mortgage, credit card, auto 
loan, alimony, and other such payments) shouldn’t be greater 
than 55 percent of the monthly gross household income. If it 
is, debt counseling is required under the program.
 
MHA programs are available exclusively for owner-occupied resi-
dences — not rentals, second homes, or investment properties.
To achieve the targeted 31-percent DTI ratio, the MHA plan calls 
for lenders to first reduce the interest rate on qualifying mort-
gages to achieve a 38-percent or lower front-end DTI ratio. The 

 Chapter 12: Negotiating a Better Deal 169
Treasury then matches further reductions in monthly payments 
dollar-for-dollar with the lender/investor, down to a 31-percent 
front-end DTI ratio.
To achieve the 31-percent DTI target, lenders/investors can lower 
the interest rate, extend the term, and reduce the principal bal-
ance, in that order. The plan advises lenders to first look at reduc-
ing the interest rate. If that doesn’t do the trick (make the monthly 
payment affordable), lenders are encouraged to extend the term. 
If the rate reduction and term extension don’t do the trick, then 
lenders can reduce the principal. The plan does allow lenders to 
go beyond the guidelines and offer more relief or even follow some 
other approach to achieving affordability.
Assuming homeowners and lenders can negotiate a mortgage mod-
ification that hits the 31-percent front-end DTI target, the next test 
is whether the back-end DTI ratio (taking the modified loan into 
consideration) is greater than 55 percent. If the back-end DTI ratio 
exceeds 55 percent, homeowners are required to sign a letter stat-
ing that they agree to work with a HUD-approved credit counselor. 
(HUD is the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.) 
Any proposed modification doesn’t take effect until the homeown-
ers provide a signed statement indicating that they will obtain 
counseling.
 
MHA guidelines can change at any time and may not apply to all 
servicers, lenders, and investors. We provide these numbers only 
to give you some guidelines to judge whether a lender’s offer is 
fair. As we suggest in Chapter 2, we prefer more conservative esti-
mates of affordability based on net (after-tax) income rather than 
gross income. You need to determine for yourself what “affordable 
house payment” means to you based on your budget, debt level, 
and lifestyle.
What’s fair for lenders and investors
To paraphrase a quote from Oliver Wendell Holmes, an individual’s 
rights end where another’s begin. When the Treasury Department 
drew up its MHA guidelines, it took this idea into consideration, 
acknowledging that the homeowner’s right to an affordable house 
payment should not infringe on the lender’s or investor’s right to 
earn a reasonable profit (or at least not suffer too much of a loss) 
by modifying loans.
To determine what’s fair and best for lenders, MHA requires that 
all participants in the program apply an NPV (net present value) 
test on every mortgage loan that’s in “imminent default” or is 
at least 60 days delinquent under the MBA (Mortgage Bankers 
Association) delinquency calculation.

Part III: Hammering Out the Details with Your Lender  
170
The NPV test consists of a collection of complex formulas that 
account for, among other things, cure rate, liquidation value, prop-
erty value depreciation, REO (real estate owned) stigma discount 
(the fact that buyers typically offer significantly less for repos-
sessed homes), selling costs, marketing time, and re-default rate. 
The Treasury provides an NPV tool that enables lenders to plug in 
information about a particular mortgage to determine whether the 
mortgage passes the test.
 
What it all boils down to is this: Lenders who participate in the 
MHA program are required to modify a mortgage only if the NPV 
test shows that the modification will cost them less than the esti-
mated cost of foreclosure. Lenders still have the option to modify 
mortgages if the modification will cost more than the estimated 
cost of foreclosure, but they’re required to modify only if the NPV 
test shows a net positive to the lender.
Again, at the time of writing, MHA guidelines and the NPV test 
don’t apply to all lenders, servicers, and investors. However, most 
lenders have tools in place to compare the cost of a loan modifica-
tion with that of foreclosure. Unfortunately, homeowners rarely, if 
ever, receive access to these same tools. Fortunately, we show you 
how to make some comparisons of your own in the upcoming sec-
tion “Reminding Your Lender What It Stands to Lose.”
Reminding Your Lender What 
You Can Afford to Pay
When you applied for your mortgage, the loan originator prob-
ably sat down with you, collected some financial data, plugged 
the numbers into a calculator, and then told you how much house 
you could afford. It probably sounded like more house than you 
thought you could afford, and it ended up being more house than 
you could afford, but back then, that was how many loan origina-
tors operated. The goal was to stretch a bit in order to earn a 
bigger return on your investment.
Unfortunately, when negotiating a loan modification, many lenders 
take the same approach. They crunch the numbers and tell home-
owners how much they can afford to pay, often overlooking other 
expenses in the process.
 
Don’t let anyone tell you how much you can afford to pay per 
month for housing. Your household budget should tell you all you 
need to know. In Chapter 2, we show you how to get a handle on 
your situation and estimate an affordable monthly payment. In 
Chapter 7, we show you how to crunch the numbers for yourself to 

 Chapter 12: Negotiating a Better Deal 171
achieve your goal. After working through those two chapters, you 
should have a clear idea of the monthly amount you can afford to 
pay for housing. Keep that bottom line in mind, and remind your 
lender as often as necessary how much you really can afford to pay.
What often occurs during negotiations is that homeowners become 
so frightened of losing their homes that they’re willing to agree to 
just about anything to keep them. They end up agreeing to unaf-
fordable house payments that put them back on the path to a future 
default. If you don’t hire an expert to represent your interests, at 
least consult with a friend or relative who has a cool head and is 
less emotionally involved in the situation. Sometimes, you need 
someone on hand to remind you how much you can afford to pay.
 
Approach the situation objectively. Some homeowners who have 
gotten themselves in trouble through their own carelessness often 
make the mistake of demanding that their lenders slash the mort-
gage payments so they won’t have to adjust their budgets. This is 
rarely effective. Demonstrating to your lender that your budget is 
stretched as thin as possible and that you need a lower mortgage 
payment to make ends meet is a much better way to go — and 
more successful, too.
Reminding Your Lender 
What It Stands To Lose
Whenever you’re in negotiations, you place yourself in a stronger 
position by knowing what the other party stands to gain or lose. In 
most cases in which a homeowner qualifies for a loan modification, 
the lender is looking at a lose-lose scenario in which the choices are
 
✓ A loan modification resulting in a lower interest rate and 
monthly payments, meaning the lender loses revenue, 
advances costs, and at times forgives principal.
 
✓ A foreclosure resulting in out-of-pocket costs for legal fees, 
rehabbing, and selling the property, possibly for less than the 
unpaid balance on the loan.
Lenders know what they stand to lose and gain by agreeing to loan 
modifications because they crunch numbers all day long, five to 
seven days per week. When negotiating with your lender, you need 
to know, too. If you know that the lender stands to lose $50,000 by 
foreclosing on your home and kicking you out, for example, and it’s 
offering you a loan modification that’s going to result in a net loss 
to the lender of only $7,000, you know that lender has a lot more 
room to negotiate. More importantly, you can use your knowledge 
to push for a better deal.

Estimating the lender’s losses 
in foreclosure
To figure out what your lender has to lose by modifying your loan, 
do the math:
 
1. Obtain a reliable home valuation (estimate of the prop-
erty’s current market value) from an appraiser or Realtor. 
(If you have one already that’s less than 90 days old, it 
will do.)
 
 In some states, only appraisers are allowed to provide offi-
cial home valuations. If your state allows real estate agents 
to do it, some agents may provide a complimentary CMA 
(comparative market analysis) or BPO (broker’s price opin-
ion) or charge a reasonable fee that’s usually considerably 
less than you’d pay an appraiser.
 
2. Check your most recent mortgage statement or contact 
your lender and ask for your principal balance — the 
amount you currently owe on your home.
 
 The easiest way to get an accurate amount is to request the 
pay-off balance. You may be able to simply dial the toll-free 
number on a recent mortgage statement and work through 
the automated menu system to obtain the pay-off balance.
 
3. Subtract what you owe on the home (Step 2) from the cur-
rent market value of your home (Step 1).
If the result is a negative number, your lender stands to lose 
money if it forecloses. The bigger the negative number, the more 
it stands to lose. (This crude calculation assumes the lender will 
be able to sell the house at full market value, but lenders usually 
have to sell for even less than you could sell the home for, due to 
the stigma that surrounds bank-owned properties.) Still, this is 
only a portion of the potential loss. The lender also loses money 
before, during, and after the foreclosure in the form of the follow-
ing expenses:
 
✓ Attorney fees for processing the foreclosure and eviction — at 
least a few hundred dollars
 
✓ Rehab costs for repairs required to make the property 
marketable — typically about 10 percent of your home’s 
current market value)
 
✓ Real estate agent commissions for listing and selling the prop-
erty (6 to 8 percent of the property’s sales price) — multiply 
your home’s market value by 6 percent for a rough estimate

 Chapter 12: Negotiating a Better Deal 173
 
✓ Holding costs, including property taxes, insurance, and utili-
ties (for example, to keep the heat on so the pipes don’t freeze 
in the winter) — estimate the holding costs for six months
 
✓ Internal costs governed by the agreement between the inves-
tor and the servicer, including the cost of pulling the loan out 
of a pool, if necessary, which you can’t really predict (see the 
nearby sidebar “De-pooling a mortgage”)
Add these costs to the loss the lender is likely to see from the 
actual sale of the property (Step 3), and you have a pretty good 
estimate of the lender’s total loss.
 
Some experts estimate that a lender stands to lose between 
$50,000 and $80,000 on a single foreclosure. Lenders can usually 
modify a loan for a small fraction of that amount, enabling home-
owners to keep their homes in the process.
Calculating the lender’s losses from 
a loan modification
When evaluating your lender’s loan modification offer, get out your 
calculator and figure out what your lender stands to lose in inter-
est by modifying your loan. Before getting into the actual step-by-
step calculations, consider the following example:
Five years ago, a couple took out a $200,000 30-year mortgage 
at 9.75 percent, making their monthly payment $1,718.31.
Under the current agreement, the lender would stand to earn 
$418,591.60: ($1,718.31 × 30 years × 12 months/year) – $200,000 = 
$418,591.60
After making payments for five years, the couple’s balance is 
down to $192,821.91; they’ve paid $7,178.09 in principal and 
$95,920.51 in interest so far.
At the beginning of the sixth year, they can no longer afford to 
make payments.
The lender looks at the deal and proposes an interest rate 
reduction to 5.5 percent and extends the term to 30 years. 
These changes make the new payment $1,094.82, saving the 
couple $623.49 each month.
Under the new agreement, the lender stands to earn 
$201,313.29 plus the $95,920.51 it already collected in interest 
for a total of $297,233.80: ($1,094.82 × 30 years × 12 months/
year) – $192,821.91 + $95,920.51 = $297,233.80.
This modification represents a “loss” to the lender of 
$121,357.80: $418,591.60 – $297,233.80 = $121,357.80.

Part III: Hammering Out the Details with Your Lender  
174
We use the word “loss” kind of loosely here. When the lender is 
still netting nearly $300,000 from a loan, the fact that it’s earning 
$121,000 less than it would have gotten under the original agree-
ment is a little tough to classify as a loss. In this example, the 
lender avoids a costly foreclosure (modest estimate of $50,000 to 
$80,000 loss) and earns about $200,000 more than it has already 
collected over the life of the loan by keeping a performing asset on 
its books.
Use these steps to figure out just how much your lender is losing 
by offering you a loan modification:
 
1. Multiply your original term (in years) × 12 months/year × 
your monthly mortgage payment (principal and interest 
only) to determine the total amount you would pay over 
the life of the loan under the original agreement.
 
 For example, if you have a $136,000 30-year mortgage at 8 
percent interest, your monthly payment is about $1,000, so 
30 × 12 × $1,000 = $360,000.
 
2. Calculate the total amount you already paid in principal 
and interest.
 
 For example, if you already made 90 monthly payments, 
90 × $1,000 = $90,000.
 
3. Calculate the total amount you will pay under the new 
agreement. 
 
 For example, suppose the balance is now $125,000 on a 
$136,000 loan. If the lender lowers the interest rate to 5 
percent and extends the term to 30 years, the new payment 
would be $671.03. Multiply 30 years by 12 months/year by 
$671.03 to get $241,571.
De-pooling a mortgage
Lenders and government-sponsored enterprises, including Fannie Mae and Freddie 
Mac, often package mortgages that are similar and sell them as pooled mortgages 
to investors. When one of the loans in a pool goes bad or is modified, the lender 
usually must pull the loan out of the pool and pay a price for doing so.
The lender can recoup some of the cost by re-pooling mortgages it has success-
fully modified and selling them back to investors. Due to the complexities of de-
pooling and re-pooling mortgage loans, estimating the average cost to the lender 
is nearly impossible. What’s important to keep in mind, however, is that a lender 
stands to lose more from a bad loan than from a loan it can successfully modify and 
sell back to investors.

 Chapter 12: Negotiating a Better Deal 175
 
4. Total the amounts calculated in Steps 2 and 3.
 
 In this example, $90,000 + $242,000 = $332,000. This is the 
total amount you would pay the lender, as compared to 
the $360,000 you were scheduled to pay under the original 
agreement.
 
5. Subtract the total calculated in Step 4 from the total 
calculated in Step 1 to determine the total interest the 
lender stands to lose with the new agreement.
 
 In this example, $360,000 – $332,000 = $28,000.
 
In this example, the lender has the following choice: Foreclose and 
lose about $60,000, or modify and continue to collect more than 
$116,000 in interest over the life of the loan: $242,000 total – $125,000 
remaining balance = $117,000. This difference leaves a lot more room 
for negotiation than your lender may be willing to admit. However, 
if the loan is FHA- or VA-secured, or if you carry private mortgage 
insurance (PMI), the calculations can change dramatically, as ex-
plained in the nearby sidebar “Accounting for mortgage insurance.”
Gaining a strategic advantage 
with what you know
You don’t want to play hardball with your lender by blurting out 
everything you know about what it stands to lose by foreclosing. 
Such a move may convince your lender to foreclose just because 
it can. Instead of being blunt about it, take a more subtle approach 
by trying one or more of these options:
 
✓ If your home is worth significantly less than the unpaid prin-
cipal balance, send a letter or fax to your lender indicating 
that you’re upside-down in your mortgage and can’t even 
qualify for refinancing. If you have a recent appraisal, BPO, or 
CMA, include it with your letter and a copy of your latest mort-
gage statement with the unpaid principal balance highlighted.
 
✓ Express your understanding that the lender has a great deal 
to lose from foreclosure. You may even want to mention how 
many homes are for sale in your neighborhood and how long 
they’ve been on the market.
 
✓ Let your lender know how committed you are to making 
this work. Stress the fact that you’ve carefully examined your 
budget and are confident that the modified mortgage payment 
is truly affordable. Mention that by agreeing to the loan modi-
fication offer you’re presenting, you appreciate the fact that 
the lender will be receiving less interest than under the origi-
nal agreement.

Part III: Hammering Out the Details with Your Lender  
176
 
All these methods communicate what you know in a less threaten-
ing, less confrontational manner. Avoid the temptation to present 
your offer as though you’re doing the lender a favor, even though, 
in a way, you are.
Not Taking “No” for an Answer
We live by the credo that “no” means “know.” That is, if someone 
tells us “no,” we assume they don’t know enough to say “yes.” In 
sales and in life, this approach has proven very effective for us. 
Persistence pays. Often, lenders and their representatives are in a 
hurry to clear cases off their desks. They take a tiny piece of infor-
mation and draw huge conclusions, often to the detriment of both 
the homeowners and themselves, the lenders.
During negotiations, if the lender dismisses a request for compro-
mise, assume that the lender doesn’t know enough to say “yes.” 
What are you communicating or not communicating to the lender, 
verbally or nonverbally, that’s getting in the way of the lender 
saying “yes” to your request? You may be providing too little or 
too much information or are just not explaining your point of view 
in a clear and effective manner. Keep trying.
Accounting for mortgage insurance
All things being equal, a loan modification is usually the best option for lenders 
because they avoid the high cost of foreclosure and continue to collect interest on 
loans — at a lower rate of return, but still enough to earn a profit.
In many cases, however, another factor comes into play — mortgage insurance. 
If a loan is FHA- or VA-secured, or if the homeowners are paying private mortgage 
insurance (PMI), the lender stands to lose much less from foreclosure because 
the insurance will make up a portion of the difference. In other words, the lender’s 
motivation to work out a reasonable deal with the homeowner/borrower may be 
undermined by mortgage insurance — often mortgage insurance that the home-
owner is paying for!
Fortunately, the party insuring the mortgage is motivated to work out a solution 
with homeowners to avoid having to pay a claim. Many mortgage insurance com-
panies are contacting delinquent borrowers in an attempt to work out alternatives 
to foreclosure, even when the lender has been lax or unsuccessful in its attempts 
to work out a deal.

 Chapter 12: Negotiating a Better Deal 177
 
You have two ears and one mouth for a reason: You should listen 
twice as much as you talk. Your lender may be telling you exactly 
what it needs to hear in order to say “yes,” so listen carefully and 
read between the lines. The clues may be very subtle. For example, 
your lender may reject your application on the grounds that you 
have insufficient income to afford a reasonable monthly payment, 
which could mean you failed to mention or your lender overlooked 
another source of income. By asking some follow-up questions, 
you can obtain more detailed information about what the lender is 
looking for.
Applying Some Subtle 
Legal Pressure
You may be able to gain a strategic advantage during negotiations 
by dropping some subtle hints about legal actions you can take to 
protect yourself or to at least throw a wrench in the foreclosure 
proceedings. You don’t have to be ugly about it. Simply mentioning 
the fact that you may need to consult an attorney or see someone 
about how your mortgage loan got approved in the first place may 
be sufficient to bring reluctant lenders back to the negotiating 
table. The following sections include some suggestions.
Consider mentioning the B word: 
Bankruptcy
Filing for bankruptcy triggers an automatic stay against any collec-
tion activities, including foreclosure. If the date of the foreclosure 
sale is nearing and your lender is being uncooperative, a mere 
mention of consulting a bankruptcy attorney can give the lender 
reason to reconsider.
 
Be careful when playing the bankruptcy card. Lower-level employ-
ees may be trained to end discussions when they hear the word 
“bankruptcy” because lenders are afraid of violating the automatic 
stay. As soon as a homeowner declares bankruptcy, the automatic 
stay goes into effect, prohibiting them from moving forward with 
any collection activities, including loan modification.

178
Bring up concerns about 
predatory lending
Mention any concerns you have that you’ve been a victim of preda-
tory lending. The definition of predatory lending can be very broad. 
One expert we spoke with defined it as “any loan that overextends 
the borrowers from day one, dooming them to failure.” In other 
words, if you were placed in a mortgage with a low teaser rate that 
eventually rose to produce a monthly mortgage payment you could 
no longer afford, you’re a victim of predatory lending. (See the 
nearby sidebar “What constitutes predatory lending?” for our take 
on the subject and some examples of predatory lending practices.)
When negotiating with your lender, you don’t have to use the term 
“predatory lending,” which could be taken as threatening. Instead, 
simply explain that you don’t think you ever were really qualified 
for this loan and can’t possibly afford it now, unless you can work 
out a reasonable payment. If you’re unable to obtain an affordable 
payment, you’ll be forced to explore your legal options.
Have an audit performed
If you really believe you were a victim of predatory lending or 
other lender violations, consider hiring an independent third party 
to audit your loan file. Armed with an audit that highlights the 
lender’s bad acts, you may have some success obtaining a loan 
modification. Make sure you’re submitting the audit through the 
lender’s appropriate channels. For more about audits and the vio-
lations auditors usually look for, check out Chapters 13 and 14.

 Chapter 12: Negotiating a Better Deal 179
What constitutes predatory lending?
We define predatory lending as any unethical lending activity that harms borrowers 
to the benefit of lenders or loan originators. Common forms of predatory lending 
include the following:
 ✓ Charging excessive points, interest rate, or loan origination fees.
 ✓ Equity stripping, which means convincing homeowners to refinance again and 
again so the lender can pull equity out of the home to cover the loan origination 
fees and closing costs. The borrower may realize a temporary financial benefit, 
but it’s far outweighed by the long-term detriment.
 ✓ Charging private mortgage insurance (PMI) premiums to homeowners who 
aren’t required to carry PMI.
 ✓ Failing to fully disclose and explain the terms of a loan agreement.
 ✓ Using low teaser rates with adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) to convince 
homeowners to sign up for high-risk loans.
 ✓ Encouraging or facilitating the misrepresentation of facts and figures on a loan 
application to qualify unqualified applicants for a mortgage loan.
 ✓ Adding a single-premium life insurance policy (that pays off the balance if one 
of the borrowers dies) and charging the premiums as part of the loan.
 ✓ Representing to a borrower that he qualified for a higher rate when in reality he 
qualified for a lower one, and then placing him into a loan reflecting the higher 
rate or charging points to buy down the rate.
 ✓ Targeting of the poor, uneducated, elderly, or minority groups with oppressive 
or unfair loan products.
 ✓ Charging other unnecessary fees or costs.
Most predatory lending practices are prohibited under the Real Estate Settlement 
and Procedures Act (RESPA) and other legislation. For more about these and other 
legal protections for borrowers, check out Chapter 13.

Dealing with an 
Uncooperative Lender

In this part . . .
D
uring the lending frenzy that set the stage for the 
mortgage meltdown and subsequent foreclosure 
epidemic, loan originators and even some lenders were 
bending and breaking the rules to qualify more borrowers 
and pad their profi ts with higher interest rates and 
unclear fees. As a result, many loans originated during this 
time show signs of lending law violations and predatory 
lending.
The good news is that if you or a professional loan auditor 
can prove that the loan originator or lender committed 
one or more violations, you may be able to leverage this 
proof to convince an unwilling lender to modify your loan. 
You may even have grounds to bring a civil suit against 
the lender to collect penalties for each violation.
In this part, we bring you up to speed on the legislation in 
place to protect borrowers, show you how to audit your 
loan to uncover possible violations, and provide tips on 
how to use proof of violations to convince your lender to 
modify your mortgage loan and think twice about taking 
advantage of consumers ever again.

Brushing Up on 
Your Legal Rights

▶ Picking apart the Truth in Lending Act (TILA)
▶ Spotting RESPA violations
▶ Understanding special protections for military personnel
W
hen a lender out refuses to cooperate with you in putting 
together a loan modification, you may be able to gain some 
leverage through laws designed to protect consumer/borrower 
rights. This chapter brings you up to speed on some of the rules 
and regulations that govern the mortgage industry. By knowing 
your rights, you can often encourage a reluctant lender to cooper-
ate regardless of whether its representatives are willing to do so.
 
The mortgage lending laws presented in this chapter (TILA, 
HOEPA, and RESPA) allow for both public and private (civil) 
remedies. If a particular regulation doesn’t allow a private right of 
action, only the attorney general or a regulatory agency can take 
legal action against the offender. If your lender or loan originator 
committed a TILA, HOEPA, or RESPA violation, you can file suit. 
Don’t get your hopes up for a big payday, though. As we explain 
in Chapter 15, you’re usually better off leveraging these laws to 
obtain a loan modification or workout solution. If you do file suit, a 
reasonable, quick settlement is almost always best.
 
Don’t attempt to play the role of lawyer (unless, of course, you

lending laws here only to equip you with the knowledge you need 
to understand and pursue your rights with an attorney’s assistance.

Part IV: Dealing with an Uncooperative Lender

Knowing Exactly What Your 
Lender Must Disclose
When most people buy a home, they borrow a lot of money to 
finance the purchase. Because so much money is at stake, disclo-
sure laws have been put in place to ensure that borrowers know 
what they’re getting into before they sign on the dotted line. If your 
lender fails to honor these disclosures, and you can prove it, your 
lender may be required by law to rewrite your mortgage and per-
haps even pay damages.
 
If your lender is being uncooperative and you believe that your 
lender or the person originating your loan failed to provide the 
required disclosures, you may have legal recourse. Consult a repu-
table real estate attorney in your area to help you determine your 
legal options.
Even though a missed disclosure is technically a “bad act” by 
the lender, it’s usually not sufficient grounds to win a lawsuit. 
Repeated offenses and a total disregard for the regulations in place 
may interest the state attorney general but won’t help you person-
ally. You may be able to use the lack of disclosure, however, to 
highlight the fact that you didn’t understand the loan you were 
placed in. If you can demonstrate to the lender the lack of disclo-
sure by its mortgage originator, you may gain just enough leverage 
to convince your lender to modify your loan. See Chapter 15 for 
details about applying legal pressure.
Disclosing loan terms and costs
Like any merchant, lenders sell a product; in the world of home 
financing, that product is a mortgage. By some counts, lenders offer 
more than 400 different products, including various types of adjust-
able- and fixed-rate mortgages, interest-only and negative amortiza-
tion loans, and reverse mortgages. These products come and go to 
meet market demands and conditions in the lending industry.
 
Some of the riskier mortgage products that contributed to the mort-
gage meltdown disappeared as a result of the crisis, but history has 
a habit of repeating itself, so we can’t say they’re gone for good.
When presenting a product to you for consideration, the lender is 
required by law to label the product with a list of ingredients that 
you can understand. This breakdown enables you to comparison 
shop and more fully understand what you’re buying. In the fol-
lowing sections, we describe the various disclosures lenders are 
required to make when selling a mortgage loan.

 Chapter 13: Brushing Up on Your Legal Rights 185
Terms
The terms of the loan (along with financing costs) are what ulti-
mately determine the monthly payment and how much you pay 
over the life of the loan. Terms include the following:
 
✓ Interest rate: A percentage of the principal (loan amount). 
When advertising a loan, lenders are required to advertise 
the APR (annual percentage rate), as discussed in the nearby 
sidebar “Interest rate or APR?”. This can be a fixed-percentage 
or adjustable rate (see “Adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs)” 
later in this chapter).
 
✓ Term: Total time to pay back the loan in years, months, 
or number of payments, assuming you make all scheduled 
payments.
Fees
Fees include any amounts the loan originator or lender charges 
upfront to process the loan application. You can expect reasonable 
charges for the following items:
 
✓ Appraisal fee
 
✓ Closing or escrow fee
 
✓ Document preparation fee
 
✓ Credit report fee
 
✓ Flood certification fee
 
✓ Lender fee (negotiable)
 
✓ Processing fee (negotiable)
 
✓ Recording fees
 
✓ Reserves for paying taxes or insurance
 
✓ State or county tax/stamps
 
✓ Title insurance
 
✓ Underwriting fee (negotiable)
Some lenders or loan originators attempt to pad their profits by 
charging junk fees — inflated charges or fees for nonessential ser-
vices or for services that few others in the industry charge. Here 
are some examples of junk fees:
 
✓ Administration fee
 
✓ Affiliate consulting fee
 
✓ Amortization fee

Part IV: Dealing with an Uncooperative Lender  
186
 
✓ Application fee
 
✓ Bank inspection fee
 
✓ Document review fee
 
✓ E-mail fee
 
✓ Express mail fee
 
✓ Funding fee
 
✓ Lender’s attorney fee
 
✓ Lender’s inspection fee
 
✓ Messenger fee
 
✓ Notary fee
 
✓ Photograph fee
 
✓ Pay-off request fee
 
✓ Settlement fee
 
✓ Sign-up fee
 
✓ Translation fee
Legally speaking, the lender can charge junk fees, but it must dis-
close fees in writing prior to formalizing the loan agreement by 
way of a Good Faith Estimate (GFE), upon your request prior to 
closing, and at closing on the HUD-1 form. See the section “Using 
the TILA and HOEPA to Your Advantage” later in this chapter for 
details about your protections with regard to a lender’s fees.
 
The best way to determine whether a lender or loan originator is 
padding its profits with junk fees or charging too much for legiti-
mate items is to compare fees that other companies were charging 
at the time. Unfortunately, you probably don’t have copies of all 
the GFEs you received when you were shopping for your current 
mortgage. You may need to consult with a mortgage broker or real 
estate attorney who can more easily identify junk fees.
 
If you decide to refinance out of trouble (rather than seek a loan 
modification), don’t spend a lot of money obtaining quotes. Ask 
the following questions:
 
✓ Do I have to pay an application fee or any other upfront fees 
to obtain a quote from you?
 
✓ What portion of any application or upfront fees is refundable 
in the event that I don’t close on the loan?

 Chapter 13: Brushing Up on Your Legal Rights 187
Adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs)
Adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) have given many homeowners 
nightmares. Leading up to the mortgage meltdown, many lend-
ers were pushing ARMs on unwary borrowers — often seducing 
them with low introductory (teaser) rates. Due to interest rate 
adjustments, some homeowners talked into ARMs have seen their 
monthly mortgage payments double in a very short period of time.
 
ARMs can adjust up or down. Ironically, during the worst of the 
mortgage meltdown, rates (and payment amounts) for many home-
owners went down. Even so, the increase from a low teaser rate, 
such as 3.75 percent, up to a market rate of 6 to 7 percent was too 
much for some homeowners. In addition, you really can’t count on 
rates staying low; if you have an ARM now, even if the rate seems 
stable, look toward moving into a fixed-rate mortgage.
Lenders should be required by law to show borrowers, in writing, 
the worst-case scenarios of the ARMs they’re selling. This would 
probably be enough to convince most borrowers to steer clear of 
these products. Unfortunately, at the peak of the subprime lending 
boom, lenders were only required to disclose the following:
 
✓ Interest rate: The percentage you’ll pay monthly until the 
interest rate is scheduled to adjust.
 
✓ Adjustment period: How often adjustments can be made — 
monthly, quarterly, semi-annually, or annually, for example.
 
✓ Index: The base interest rate set by market conditions and 
published by an unbiased third party. The fluctuation of the 
index is what makes an ARM adjustable.
 
✓ Margin: The lender’s markup on the index. The interest you 
pay is determined by the index plus the margin. For example, 
if the index is 3 percent and the margin is 2.5 percent, you pay 
Interest rate or APR?
You’re likely to see interest rates presented in two ways: as an interest rate and as 
an annual percentage rate (APR), which tends to confuse consumers, especially 
given the fact that the APR is always higher than the interest rate.
So, what’s the difference? APR is the percentage you pay on the money you borrow, 
including any loan origination fees and other prepaid costs. Congress created the 
APR in 1974 to give consumers a tool for quickly comparing the actual costs associ-
ated with loans. By law, lenders must advertise the APR as the rate they’re charg-
ing, so consumers can compare apples to apples.

Part IV: Dealing with an Uncooperative Lender  
188
5.5 percent interest. If the index rises to 5 percent, you pay 7.5 
percent interest.
 
✓ Cap: The highest interest rate the lender can charge, regard-
less of how high the index goes. The lender often quotes a 
yearly cap and a lifetime cap, such as 2/6, meaning the inter-
est rate can rise up to 2 percent per year but it can’t increase 
more than 6 percent total over the life of the loan.
 
Lenders are supposed to give to borrowers who are contemplating 
ARM loan products a copy of the CHARM (Consumer Handbook 
on Adjustable-Rate Mortgages) booklet. You can access the latest 
version of the CHARM booklet online at www.federalreserve.
gov/pubs/arms/arms_english.htm. (Failing to give borrowers 
CHARM booklets is a violation but not likely to be enough of an 
oversight to justify rewriting the loan or filing expensive litigation.)
Single premium life insurance
To protect their investments and earn a little extra money on the 
side, some lenders peddle single premium life insurance policies 
with their loans and pressure borrowers to buy them. (Single pre-
mium means you pay the entire premium upfront; the lender may 
roll the premium into the loan amount, but then you end up paying 
even more for it in interest.)
In a way, the life insurance policy protects the borrower’s family 
from getting stuck with mortgage payments in the event of the 
borrower’s death, but it also protects the lender. In other words, 
the borrower pays for a policy to protect the lender’s interests. 
Several consumer advocacy groups have claimed that packaging 
this insurance with home loans borders on predatory lending.
 
We’re not passing judgment against single premium life insurance 
or those who sell it, but lenders are required to disclose the fact 
that this insurance is optional and any decision not to buy it will 
not jeopardize the loan approval.
Disclosing other important 
information
In addition to disclosing the terms and costs of the loan, lenders are 
also required to disclose your legal rights as a consumer and other 
important details about the loan agreement, including the following:
 
✓ Right of rescission: The right of rescission granted by federal 
law gives you three days to back out of most types of major 
financial deals, including loan agreements. It’s designed to 
protect consumers from high-pressure sales tactics. The 

 Chapter 13: Brushing Up on Your Legal Rights 189
right of rescission does have some limitations in that it 
applies only to
 
• Nonpurchase mortgages (such as refinance loans).
 
• Mortgages secured by the borrower’s primary residence.
 
• Loan transactions that occurred within the last three 
years. In other words, a three-year statute of limitations 
applies to any claim that a right of rescission had been 
violated.
 
✓ Auto pay: If you’ve agreed to have your house payments 
automatically withdrawn from your bank account, the lender 
is required to disclose the details of how payments will be 
handled, including the day of the month payments will be 
withdrawn and the amount of the payments.
 
✓ Escrow accounts and payments: Many mortgage loans, par-
ticularly for first-time homebuyers, have escrow accounts 
attached to them. A portion of each monthly payment is set 
aside in escrow to pay property taxes, insurance, and any 
homeowner association fees. Lenders are required to disclose 
the following with regard to escrow:
 
• Whether property taxes, insurance, and homeowner 
association fees will be paid out of escrow or you will 
pay them separately.
 
• The amount of each payment to be deposited in escrow. 
The escrow amount changes over the life of the loan as 
the cost of property taxes, insurance, and homeowner 
association fees change. The lender must provide writ-
ten notice whenever the escrow amount changes.
 
• How the escrow was spent for the year.
 
✓ Force-placed insurance: If you fail to buy insurance for your 
property or let the policy lapse, the lender has the right to 
buy insurance for you and charge you for it. However, several 
laws govern force-placed insurance, including:
 
• The mortgage should state the lender’s right to force-
place insurance if the homeowner fails to insure the 
property.
 
• The lender can’t charge the homeowner more than it 
paid for the policy.
 
• In most states, the insurance policy and a disclosure 
letter must be provided to the state regulatory agency. 
(Regulations regarding force-placed insurance vary from 
state to state.)
 
✓ Lender-affiliated business relationships: If a lender has 
affiliated business relationships with any other parties 

Part IV: Dealing with an Uncooperative Lender  
190
involved in processing or approving your loan, it’s required 
to disclose the nature of these relationships in writing. For 
example, if several real estate businesses partner to create a 
one-stop home shopping experience, the businesses need to 
disclose that they’re all working together.
 
 The disclosure is designed to prevent various businesses 
from collaborating to rip off consumers. For example, it dis-
courages a real estate agent from recommending a mortgage 
broker who charges excessive fees and then kicks back a 
portion of the money to the agent as a so-called referral fee. 
Businesses can still create these informal partnerships, but 
they must disclose them to borrowers.
Using the TILA and HOEPA 
to Your Advantage
The Truth in Lending Act (TILA) and Home Ownership and Equity 
Protection Act (HOEPA, an amendment to TILA) are designed to 
give borrowers the information they need to make well-informed 
financing decisions, protect them from paying excessive fees and 
interest, and prevent them from falling victim to unethical lending 
practices. Here’s a rundown of the basics:
 
✓ TILA: This legislation covers all residential loan transactions 
(one- to four-family units), whether they’re owner-occupied 
or investment properties. TILA’s purpose is to “promote the 
informed use of consumer credit by requiring disclosures 
about its terms and cost.” TILA is responsible for all those 
lender disclosures described in the earlier section “Knowing 
Exactly What Your Lender Must Disclose.”
 
✓ HOEPA: Also referred to as Section 32 or high-rate, high-fee 
loan disclosures, HOEPA applies to residential owner-occupied 
dwellings for purchases and refinances. It covers one- to four-
family owner-occupied properties in which at least one of the 
units is the owner’s primary residence. HOEPA’s purpose is to 
curtail predatory lending practices, particularly the practice 
of placing homeowners in high-interest loans.
In the following sections, we provide some suggestions on how you 
can use this legislation to your advantage.
Identifying noncompliance issues
Any failure on the part of the lender to fully disclose the terms of 
the mortgage or any other information that a borrower needs to 

 Chapter 13: Brushing Up on Your Legal Rights 191
make a well-informed choice of mortgage products constitutes a 
violation of TILA.
 
The easiest thing to check is whether your lender provided suffi-
cient notice of your three-day right of rescission. This applies only 
to refinance and home equity loans. Review the loan documents 
you received in your closing packet. Sufficient notice of your right 
of rescission requires two copies of the Notice of Right to Cancel 
for each borrower on the note; the copies must be signed by all 
parties and must include the date of the transaction and the dead-
line for canceling.
Other TILA violations, such as a failure to fully disclose the terms 
of the loan agreement, force-placed insurance, and the lender’s 
business affiliations, are tougher to spot and typically require the 
trained eye of an attorney who specializes in auditing mortgages. 
(For more about auditing a mortgage, check out Chapter 14.)
 
Suspect a HOEPA violation if you’re paying a significantly higher 
interest rate on your loan than most homeowners you know. Under 
HOEPA, lenders must warn borrowers if the APR is more than 10 
percent higher than the comparable Treasury yield (Treasury 
securities having a similar period of maturity, such as 30 years), 
or if the deal’s total points and fees exceed 8 percent of the loan 
amount. To evaluate your APR in these terms, do the following:
 
✓ Total the points and fees your lender charged you, and divide 
that number by the total loan amount. If the result is higher 
than 0.08 and your lender didn’t warn you about it, you’ve just 
spotted a HOEPA violation.
 
✓ Find an APR calculator on the Web (a search on your favorite 
search engine should turn up plenty of options) and plug in the 
numbers for your loan: loan amount, extra costs, interest rate, 
and term. The result is the APR your lender’s charging you. 
Go to www.ustreas.gov, search for “30-year Treasury yield,” 
click US Treasury – Daily Treasury Yield Curve, and then click 
Historical Data. Browse for the 30-year Treasury yield on the 
date on which you signed for your loan. If your APR is higher 
than the 30-year Treasury yield on the date you locked your 
rate plus 10 percent, your lender may be in violation of HOEPA.
Pushing for a resolution
If you suspect a TILA or HOEPA violation based on information in 
the previous section, contact a reputable real estate attorney who’s 
experienced in auditing mortgage loans. The attorney can confirm 
your suspicions and assist you in pursuing your legal options or 
explain to you why the suspected violation isn’t actually a violation. 
Don’t try to play the role of an attorney unless you are one.

Part IV: Dealing with an Uncooperative Lender  
192
You can report suspected TILA or HOEPA violations to your state 
attorney general, certain regulatory agencies, or even law enforce-
ment agencies. Chapter 15 has details on teaming up with state 
and federal regulators, and Appendix A has contact information for 
state attorneys general and regulatory agencies.
 
Loan originators who are out to fleece borrowers are usually pretty 
good at getting as close to the legal line as possible without crossing 
it. When dealing with these shades of gray, build your case to show 
a pattern of inappropriate activity. Your goal is to prove that your 
claims are more credible than those of the party that originated 
your loan so that your lender agrees to modify your loan.
Tapping the power of the law
Most homeowners try to refinance out of trouble. Bill refinanced into trouble. 
Fortunately for him, evidence of lending law violations convinced his lender to 
approve an affordable loan modification.
Bill’s troubles began with health problems that eventually led to a period of unem-
ployment. He was struggling to make his house payments and concerned that he 
would lose the home in which he had invested so much. He just needed to refi-
nance into a lower interest, fixed-rate loan to avoid the payment increases he’d 
experienced with his adjustable loan.
The loan originator proposed a refinance loan with a reduced, fixed interest rate 
that made the monthly payment affordable without any significant increase in the 
unpaid balance. When Bill showed up to close on the loan, however, the loan was 
nothing like the one his loan originator had proposed. The fixed rate he expected 
was now an adjustable rate that reset almost immediately. The principal balance 
had increased by more than $23,000. The value assigned to the house was signifi-
cantly higher than Bill thought the house was worth.
Bill called his loan originator, who conveniently wasn’t in attendance at the clos-
ing, and complained. His loan originator assured Bill that the loan could easily be 
converted at a later date to the loan Bill was expecting. With medical expenses 
and other bills piling up and being out of time and options, Bill reluctantly signed 
for the loan.
To no surprise, Bill was unable to convert the loan to what he had expected. He 
struggled to make the payments and fell behind. Fortunately, he sought expert 
advice and discovered that several violations were evident in his loan origination, 
including misstated income and an inflated appraisal.
When confronted with the violations, the lender offered to reset the interest rate 
to a low fixed rate and extend the term to help reduce the payments. Negotiations 
weren’t easy, but with professional assistance, Bill was able to contact the lender’s 
loss mitigator and obtain an affordable loan modification.

 Chapter 13: Brushing Up on Your Legal Rights 193
Leveraging the Power of RESPA
The Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA) standardizes 
closings for residential real estate transactions to prevent unethi-
cal or confusing lending practices. According to the act, all clos-
ings must use a HUD-1 form to disclose loan costs and show where 
all the disbursed funds are going.
RESPA also controls certain actions of settlement providers (such 
as the closing agent) and service providers (including the title 
insurance provider, credit company, and appraiser) to prevent 
them from working together against the best interests of the con-
sumer (as in the case of price-gouging or kickbacks). Section 8 of 
RESPA has two important components:
 
✓ It prevents a lender from overcharging for settlement ser-
vices and keeping the difference or charging for services that 
weren’t provided. For example, if the appraisal costs $400, the 
lender can’t charge you $600 and pocket the extra $200.
 
✓ It prevents lenders and service providers from accepting or 
offering kickbacks for referral business. For example, a lender 
can’t refer a specific appraiser and then accept part of the 
appraiser’s fee.
RESPA provisions cover all aspects of services, companies, and indi-
viduals, including title companies, attorneys, and real estate agents.
 
One of the best ways to protect yourself against RESPA violations 
at closing is to compare the closing costs listed on the HUD-1 state-
ment with the costs quoted on the Good Faith Estimate (GFE). This 
step also helps identify violations after the fact, assuming you kept 
a copy of the lender’s GFE — and you should. (See the next section 
for details on spotting RESPA violations.)
Identifying RESPA violations
Before you can seek restitution for a RESPA violation, you need 
to be able to prove that your lender committed a violation. 
Unfortunately, spotting a RESPA violation simply by inspecting the 
loan documents you received at closing can be nearly impossible. 
How can you tell whether the lender overcharged you for a service 
and pocketed the surplus? How can you spot undisclosed business 
relationships if they weren’t disclosed?
The only reliable way for a consumer to check for RESPA violations 
is to have an expert review the documents. A reputable lender or 
mortgage broker could certainly provide such a service, but many 

Part IV: Dealing with an Uncooperative Lender  
194
of them are reluctant to take action against experts in their own 
industry. We recommend you turn to a qualified real estate attor-
ney who has experience in auditing mortgage loans. The attorney 
can quickly identify charges that seem out of the ordinary and can 
investigate and identify any business relationships that parties 
involved in the transaction failed to disclose or tried to obscure.
Recognizing potential penalties 
for violations
RESPA violations can carry some steep penalties. Any individual 
who violates a RESPA provision may be fined up to $10,000, impris-
oned for up to one year, or both. Even better for you, the violator 
is liable for paying damages of up to three times the amount paid 
for the settlement services, and you may pursue a private lawsuit 
for additional damages.
An attorney can confirm your suspicions and assist you in pur-
suing your legal options or explain to you why the suspected 
violation isn’t an actual violation. Don’t try to play the role of an 
attorney unless you are one.
 
As a consumer, you can report suspected RESPA violations to your 
state attorney general, certain regulatory agencies, or even law 
enforcement agencies. Turn to Chapter 15 for details on contacting 
your attorney general and working with state and federal regula-
tors, and check out Appendix A for guidance in contacting your 
state attorney general as well as regulatory agencies.
Getting Special Treatment: 
Military Servicemembers Only
While members of the military are defending American interests 
overseas, many of their families are fighting foreclosure at home. 
Fortunately, the federal government has provided active service-
members (including reservists called to active duty) and their fam-
ilies with an arsenal of legal tools to protect them from foreclosure 
and other financial and legal hardships via the Servicemembers 
Civil Relief Act (SCRA) of 2003.
Several of the legal and financial protections under the SCRA 
have little or nothing to do with homeownership, at least at first 
glance. But some of these provisions may have a related effect 
in the long run. And several, such as the following, do pertain to 
homeownership:

 Chapter 13: Brushing Up on Your Legal Rights 195
 
✓ Automatic stay on courtroom and administrative proceed-
ings: Upon written request from the servicemember, the judge, 
magistrate, or hearing officer must grant a minimum 90-day 
delay in proceedings related to civil (not criminal) cases.
 
✓ Overturning of default judgments: Upon written request 
during the servicemember’s active duty or within 60 days 
after the release from active duty, the court may overturn any 
default judgment issued against the servicemember, assuming 
the servicemember can prove that active service materially 
affected his or her ability to defend against the action.
 
✓ Reduced interest rates during active duty: For any debt 
incurred prior to entering active duty (such as a mortgage, 
credit card, or personal loan), servicemembers can have the 
interest rate reduced to no higher than 6 percent upon written 
request, assuming they can prove that active duty materially 
affected their ability to repay the financial obligation.
 
✓ Lifting of the acceleration clause: An acceleration clause 
gives the lender the power to demand full payment of the 
balance of the loan if the borrower fails to make payments 
as stipulated in the mortgage. The SCRA prohibits the lender 
from accelerating the payback for the duration of the active 
service and up to 90 days after the period of active service 
expires.
 
✓ Stay for evictions: Under the SCRA, landlords in all states are 
required to obtain court orders to evict servicemembers in 
active duty or their dependents.
 
✓ Stay for foreclosures or repossessions: During the period of 
active service and up to 90 days after the period of active ser-
vice expires, lenders must obtain court orders to proceed with 
foreclosure or repossession of servicemembers’ property, and 
servicemembers may request a stay of the proceedings.

dec04.pdf.
 
The 6 percent loan cap provision applies to both conventional and 
government-insured mortgages. However, to take advantage of 
this provision you must submit a written request to your lender no 
later than 180 days after the date of your release from active mili-
tary duty. We recommend submitting your written request as soon 
as possible. When contacting your lender, provide the following:
 
✓ A letter indicating that you’ve been called to active duty and 
that active duty will materially affect your ability to continue 
making payments at the current interest rate.

Part IV: Dealing with an Uncooperative Lender  
196
 
✓ A copy of the military orders you received, calling you to 
active duty.
 
✓ Your FHA case number, if applicable; your lender should be 
able to supply you with your FHA case number, assigned 
when you applied for the loan.
 
✓ Evidence that you took on the mortgage debt before being 
called up to active duty.
What makes you eligible for an interest rate cap during the period 
of your active military service? You must be on active duty, have 
had your mortgage before being ordered to active duty, and be 
unable to afford your mortgage payments due to being on active 
duty. You also have to belong to one of the following groups:
 
✓ Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force, or Coast Guard
 
✓ Commissioned officers of the Public Health Service or the 
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration engaged in 
active service
 
✓ Reservists ordered to report for military service
 
✓ People ordered to report for induction (training) under the 
Military Service Act
 
✓ Guardsmen called to active service for more than 30 consecu-
tive days
The relief and protections granted within the SCRA extend to 
other persons that hold secondary liability. For example, if your 
spouse signed on the house note and you’re called up to active 
duty, your spouse is protected from collection actions on the 
obligation as well.
 
If you’re in the military, you’ve been called to active service, and 
you’re having trouble making payments on your mortgage, credit 
cards, and other loans, contact the U.S. Armed Forces Legal

Auditing Your Mortgage Loan

▶ Searching your memory for clues
▶ Inspecting your loan documents for signs of fraud
▶ Hiring a qualified professional to audit your mortgage loan
D
uring the borrowing binge leading up to the mortgage melt-
down, many lenders became guilty of predatory lending char-
acterized by bending and breaking laws to boost their bottom lines 
at the borrowers’ expense. If proof exists that the lender or loan 
originator acted inappropriately in selling you a high-cost mort-
gage, “helping” you complete your loan application, or approving 
a bad loan, you may have legal grounds to compel them to modify 
your mortgage.
Remember, the secret to having your loan modification request 
approved is to prove to your lender that it’s the most cost-effective 
option. With a legitimate claim of predatory lending, you do just 
that. Your lender must then decide whether to spend money 
defending the indefensible, losing big, and paying even more in 
fines; or to modify your loan and settle for a fraction of the cost. 
It’s all about greenbacks: If a modification makes sense financially, 
you’re speaking the lender’s language.
 
The information we provide in this chapter is intended only to 
inform you of possible problems with loan originations that could 
provide a legal basis for having a mortgage loan rescinded and 
rewritten. Regardless of what you read in this chapter, if you sus-
pect your lender or loan originator of acting unethically in selling 
you your mortgage or processing your loan application, consult a 
reputable real estate attorney, preferably one who specializes in 
auditing mortgage loans. Every case is unique, and many borrow-
ers who are victims of predatory lending never suspect it. Some 
experts estimate that violations can be found in a majority of the 
subprime mortgages originated during the mortgage frenzy.

This chapter helps you identify common signs of predatory lend-
ing and other lending law violations. In Chapter 15, we show you 
what to do with the information you gather to convince your 
lender to modify your loan to affordability. We encourage you to 
try to resolve the dispute with your lender first; if that fails, you 
can enlist the assistance of government regulatory and consumer-
protection agencies and perhaps even law enforcement authori-
ties to compel your lender to do the right thing, as we explain in 
Chapter 15.
Recognizing Common Signs 
of Predatory Lending
Just before the housing bubble burst, the United States was engaged 
in what can only be described as a borrowing frenzy. Wall Street 
investors ramped up demand for mortgage-backed securities 
(MBSs), lenders and investors rolled out new products to qualify 
more borrowers, loan originators pushed these products, and con-
sumers lined up to borrow more than they could ever repay.
Caught up in the frenzy (or simply out of greed), some loan origina-
tors bent and broke the rules, and lenders relaxed their underwrit-
ing standards to approve more loans. These unethical practices 
are commonly categorized as predatory lending. In the following 
sections, we describe the most common of these unethical and ille-
gal practices so you can more effectively determine whether you 
may have legal grounds for seeking justice.
Inflated interest rate
If you had a credit score above 700 at the time you signed for the 
loan and the loan originator placed you in a loan with an interest 
rate significantly higher than the going rate, the originator acted 
unethically. A high credit score earns you the right to a competi-
tive interest rate and low or no closing costs.
You can search the Web for historical interest rates. Freddie Mac 
has a market rate that’s published and tracked historically. So is 
Prime Rate and just about everything else in between, even index 
rates on ARMs. ERATE has a mortgage rates history that goes back 
to 1980 at www.erate.com/mortgage_rates_history.htm. 
Head to research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/data/PRIME.txt 
for a history of prime rates that reaches back to 1929.

 Chapter 14: Auditing Your Mortgage Loan 199
 
Lenders have been known to reward loan originators with kickbacks 
for placing borrowers in loans with inflated interest rates — higher 
than the borrower would normally qualify for with a particular lender. 
The kickbacks are packaged as yield-spread premiums (YSPs) to make 
them sound more socially acceptable. Check your HUD-1 statement to 
determine whether your broker received a YSP at closing. Charging a 
YSP isn’t illegal, but it can indicate a pattern of abuse.
One practice that made this rate game even more distasteful is that 
some brokers specifically targeted low-income, elderly, or minority 
borrowers, which constitutes discriminatory lending (see the sec-
tion “Discriminatory interest rate” later in this chapter for details).
Inflated appraisal
Long before President Obama rolled out his Making Home Affordable 
(MHA) plan, which we cover in Chapter 10, some loan originators 
were busy pushing their own home affordability plans. Unfortunately, 
their plans included the use of inflated appraisals, a key tool in many 
forms of real estate and mortgage fraud. These fraudulent appraisals 
can take the form of phony documents, forgeries, or real appraisals 
performed by so-called cooperative, unethical appraisers.
Inflated appraisals provide consumers with inflated credit in the 
following ways:
 
✓ Cash back at closing: You borrow more than the purchase 
price and pocket the surplus. Some people mistakenly believe 
that this is perfectly okay. It’s not. It’s illegal.
 
✓ Cash-out refinancing: An inflated appraisal inflates the equity 
in the home, enabling you to borrow against more equity than 
you actually have. See the nearby sidebar “The cash-out 
refinancing scam” for details.
 
✓ Facilitating loan approval: Lenders approve loans only if the 
appraisal justifies the property value, so loan originators find 
cooperative appraisers who make sure the appraisal is 
sufficient to justify the amount of money you need or want.
To check whether your lender used an inflated appraisal to get 
your loan approved, do one of the following:
 
✓ Compare the appraised value of your home to what 
comparable homes were selling for at the time. You may 
need to consult a real estate broker or attorney to check 
historical property values in your neighborhood or search for 
this information on the Web.

Part IV: Dealing with an Uncooperative Lender  
200
 
✓ Examine the percentage appreciation of your home over 
time. If the appraisal shows that your property appreciated 
more than 10 percent a year, the appraisal is likely to be 
inflated.
 
✓ If you have a copy of the appraisal, check out the compa-
rable properties used to value your house. Are the compa-
rable properties really similar to yours in location, size, and 
features? Many inflated appraisals use properties that are 
better than the subject property to inch the value up, or they 
use comparables that are farther from the subject property 
than need be. Generally, the closer a similar house is to the 
subject property, the more comparable it is. Some sly apprais-
ers select which comparable homes to use to justify the value, 
sometimes even when other, more comparable sales are on 
the same street or just around the corner.
Doctored loan application
Whenever you apply for a mortgage loan, you’re required to com-
plete and sign a copy of the Uniform Residential Loan Application, 
or 1003 (ten-oh-three). Right above the space for your signature is 
a statement saying that the information on the 1003 form is accu-
rate and complete, to the best of your knowledge. It also states 
that misrepresenting any information is a crime.
The cash-out refinancing scam
Loan originators often encourage homeowners to cash out equity in their homes in 
order to catch up on their bills or pay off high-interest credit balances (debt con-
solidation). This isn’t necessarily bad advice, but some loan originators cross the 
line by using inflated appraisals to create equity that isn’t truly there.
The borrowers are usually excited to hear that their house appraised for a larger 
amount because it means they’ve made a good investment. They have no reason 
to question the appraiser’s findings and are happy to receive approval for their 
refinance loan.
It’s not until the homeowners are having trouble making payments and discover 
they can’t refinance because their house is really worth much less than they were 
led to believe that they begin to suspect foul play. Rectifying the situation can be 
difficult if the lender/broker is adept at deflecting responsibility or, even worse, if 
the broker and the appraiser are out of business.

 Chapter 14: Auditing Your Mortgage Loan 201
Loan originators have been known to fudge the numbers on loan 
applications and even submit phony supporting documents (like 
fake pay stubs and W-2 forms) to qualify unqualified borrowers. In 
some cases, a loan originator has even instructed the applicant to 
sign an incomplete mortgage application that the loan originator 
would later fill in with numbers as soon as he identified the best 
loan program the applicant would likely qualify for.
Understandably, borrowers trust the professionals they consult. 
After all, you don’t go to see a doctor and then question her judg-
ment when she prescribes a medication, or doubt that your car 
really needs new brake pads when your mechanic recommends 
replacing them. Likewise, when a loan originator offers advice or 
assistance, borrowers rarely question what they’re being told, and 
even when they do pose questions, they have no way of knowing 
whether the answers they receive are accurate. As a result, loan 
originators often deceived borrowers into providing inaccurate 
information on their loan applications.
 
If you feel that the professionals who “helped” you obtain your 
current mortgage provided false or misleading information and 
advice, you may be a victim of predatory lending practices, even 
if you benefited in the short term. Ignorance of the law may be an 
excuse, at least for you, the consumer, but the professionals who 
are paid to help consumers navigate the complex procedures and 
documents are obligated to provide clear and accurate information 
and guidance — not to steer you into a dark alley to get mugged by 
the system.
As for you, the borrower, if you were complicit in falsifying infor-
mation and signing a document that you knew contained false 
information, you could (technically speaking) be liable for criminal 
prosecution, too. This is highly unlikely, however, particularly if 
you’re seeking a loan modification for the mortgage on your pri-
mary residence. As long as you and your lender can work out a 
payment plan, law enforcement agencies won’t be in any hurry to 
bust you for mortgage fraud.
Approving an unaffordable loan
If you can’t afford your house payment due to financial hardship, 
that’s one thing, but if you’re earning about the same as you were 
earning when you signed for the mortgage and your house payment 
is way more than 30 percent of your gross monthly income, it’s 
likely that your lender approved you for a loan you should never 
have been approved for. And that’s a form of predatory lending.

Part IV: Dealing with an Uncooperative Lender  
202
Lenders don’t have the right to set you up for failure. Unfortunately, 
it was common practice leading up to the mortgage meltdown to 
dangle low teaser-rate loans in front of unwary borrowers to suck 
them into signing up for high-cost, high-risk mortgages. When the 
teaser rates on these loans adjusted up, many homeowners found 
themselves paying 40 or even 50 percent or more of their incomes 
on their house payments.
Placing blind trust in professionals
Time and time again we hear stories of borrowers who trusted their brokers or loan 
officers to do the right thing. After all, you don’t have to look over your doctor’s 
shoulder to make sure she prescribes the right medicine or look under the hood of 
your car to make sure your mechanic did his job. Even if you did, you may not have 
the knowledge and experience to determine whether your doctor or mechanic did 
the right thing.
Unfortunately, some greedy loan originators (mortgage brokers and loan officers) 
intentionally misled clients during the height of the mortgage frenzy. Linda has a 
textbook case. When she first sought our help, she was several months behind on 
her mortgage and was completely at a loss concerning her options. As we always 
do, we asked her to start from the beginning and explain to us what happened 
during the loan process. What we discovered was not uncommon but pretty shock-
ing given the degree of abuse.
Linda was a first-time homebuyer who obtained a referral to what she thought 
was a reputable mortgage broker. She looked to the broker as a trusted expert 
and advisor, so when her broker instructed her to add her name to her father’s 
bank account, that’s exactly what she did. The broker explained that this was a 
common practice in the industry and tantamount to her father co-signing on the 
loan for her.
When Linda began struggling with the payments, the same “trusted” loan officer 
refinanced her loan. Again, he played fast and loose with the numbers, tweaked the 
property value enough to garner an approval, and placed Linda into an aggressive 
adjustable-rate mortgage she didn’t qualify for without escrows to pay taxes and 
insurance. She was set up to fail from the start, and fail she did.
Fortunately for Linda, an attorney agreed to take on the case pro bono. After iden-
tifying the various violations committed in selling Linda her mortgage and pushing 
her application through the approval process, the attorney was able to convince 
the lender to modify Linda’s mortgage into a lower-interest fixed-rate loan with 
escrows to cover taxes and insurance. Linda is now living the more affordable 
American Dream of homeownership.

 Chapter 14: Auditing Your Mortgage Loan 203
 
If your house payment is more than 38 percent of your gross 
monthly income, and that’s not due to an income reduction, you 
may be a candidate for a Making Home Affordable (MHA) modifica-
tion under President Obama’s plan (see Chapter 10). You may also 
be a victim of predatory lending, so if your lender won’t modify to 
affordability, consult an attorney to explore other (legal) options.
Equity stripping (loan flipping)
When property values were soaring, some unethical lenders took 
undue advantage of homeowners by refinancing their loans over 
and over again without providing any net tangible benefit to the 
homeowners. The lender would profit by collecting loan origina-
tion fees and closing costs with every refinance, and the borrower 
would have less and less equity in the home with nothing to show 
for it. This practice is referred to as equity stripping or loan flipping.
If you refinanced your mortgage several times over the course 
of only a few years and saw your equity gobbled up in refinance 
charges, you may be a victim of predatory lending.
 
Equity stripping can be tough to prove. If you used your home as 
an ATM to cash out equity, your lender will try to show that you 
realized a financial benefit, and you may be out of luck. If, however, 
the evidence shows that the loan originator manipulated the infor-
mation (perhaps even by obtaining an inflated appraisal) or the 
lender relaxed its underwriting standards to enable you to qualify 
for a loan you otherwise wouldn’t qualify for, you may have a case, 
especially if you were unaware of the game being played.
High-risk loans
Just about everybody who bought a home prior to the 1990s used 
a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage to finance the purchase. In the ’90s, 
lenders began to get more creative to qualify more borrowers and 
feed Wall Street’s growing appetite for mortgage-backed securities. 
As a result, lenders rolled out mortgage loan products that carried 
a much higher potential risk. These products typically feature one 
or more of the following:
 
✓ Subprime or ARM (adjustable-rate mortgage) interest rate: 
The interest rate is variable. We refer to these as always-rising 
mortgages because the rates tend to rise more frequently than 
they fall. (Subprime is an interest rate that’s 3 or more points 
higher than the going rate for borrowers with good credit.)

Part IV: Dealing with an Uncooperative Lender  
204
 
✓ Interest-only arrangement: Interest-only loans can reduce 
monthly payments and allow consumers to buy more house. 
As long as property values continue to rise, you can build 
equity in the home, but if property values flat line or head 
south, you begin losing equity, which places your home in 
peril. With little, no, or negative equity, you can’t refinance out 
of trouble or cash out equity to get through the lean times.
 
✓ Balloon payments: Interest-only mortgages often include 
balloon payments that require you to come up with a good 
chunk of cash on the predetermined due dates.
 
According to Fannie Mae, up to half of homeowners placed in 
adjustable-rate mortgages could have qualified for fixed-rate mort-
gages with better terms. Unfortunately, they were sold risky loans 
with variable interest rates.
Discriminatory interest rate
Lenders are prohibited by law from discriminating among borrow-
ers based on race, color, gender, religion, national origin, marital 
status, age, or where the borrower happens to live. They’re not 
allowed, for example, to charge a larger down payment or set a 
higher interest rate for applicants who are single as opposed to 
those who are married.
 
If your lender required a higher than average down payment or 
is charging you higher than average interest based on something 
other than your income and credit history, you may be a victim 
of discriminatory lending. To determine what constitutes “higher 
than average” at the time you signed for your loan, consult a mort-
gage broker or an attorney who’s well-versed in these matters.
Excessive or unwarranted fees
According the Real Estate Settlement and Procedures Act (RESPA), 
loan originators and lenders are prohibited from charging fees for 
services not performed or overcharging for services performed by 
third-party suppliers and then pocketing the surplus as a referral fee.
 
One of the most common ways lenders inflate closing costs is 
by charging excessive points without providing a corresponding 
reduction in the interest rate.
The HUD-1 form you received as part of your closing packet should 
contain a complete list of fees. If any of the fees seem exorbitant or 
are for services that sound phony, bring them to your attorney’s 
attention. See Chapter 13 for lists of common legitimate and 
questionable fees.

 Chapter 14: Auditing Your Mortgage Loan 205
 
Reasonable fees are usually about 1 percent of the total loan 
amount, meaning $1,000 for every $100,000 you borrow. If the fees 
are 3 percent or higher, take a closer look at what you’ve received 
for those fees. (As explained in Chapter 13, your lender is required 
to warn you if the fees exceed 8 percent of the total loan amount.) 
Figuring out what’s “reasonable” at the time you closed on the loan 
can be difficult for anyone who’s unfamiliar with the industry, so 
you may need to consult a mortgage broker or real estate attorney.
Stiff prepayment penalties
According to the Center for Responsible Lending, “up to 80 percent 
of all subprime mortgages carry a prepayment penalty — a fee for 
paying off the loan early.” For comparison purposes, about 2 per-
cent of the loans in the prime market carry prepayment penalties 
of any serious length.
Attaching a prepayment penalty to a mortgage loan is understand-
able. Lenders don’t want to go through the trouble of processing 
a loan if they’re likely to collect interest for less than a couple 
years, especially when the interest on that two-year period was a 
very low teaser rate. However, the prepayment penalty should be 
reasonable so you can refinance into a lower fixed-rate mortgage 
without being slapped with a huge fine.
ARMs not all bad
Guns don’t kill people, but guns in the wrong hands do tend to have that effect. The 
same is true with certain mortgage loan products. Interest-only loans and ARMs 
aren’t necessarily bad and can be very useful in certain situations. An investor, for 
example, can use an interest-only loan to improve cash flow so he has more money 
available to invest in other properties.
What’s bad is when loan originators and lenders place homeowners into certain 
mortgages that the homeowners don’t fully understand or know how to manage. 
These products aren’t “one size fits all” solutions, but that’s exactly how some lend-
ers and loan originators were marketing these products leading up to the mortgage 
meltdown. Many homeowners failed to fully understand the possible ramifications 
of these riskier loans.
With more than 400 different loan types available at any given time, we can’t expect 
loan officers and lenders to educate borrowers on all their options, but they should 
have educated borrowers on any packages they were considering or ended up 
signing for.

Part IV: Dealing with an Uncooperative Lender  
206
Although it’s hard to state exactly what a reasonable prepayment 
penalty is, it should be sufficient to compensate the lender without 
making refinancing cost prohibitive for you. Suppose a loan origi-
nator placed you in a $100,000 adjustable-rate mortgage with a low 
teaser rate of 1.75 percent and a three-year prepayment penalty of 
six months’ interest. Now, suppose the interest rate jumps to 9.75 
percent in the second month, and your payment jumps from $357 
to $841. You now have the option of making those payments or 
refinancing, which will cost more than $4,000 in a prepayment pen-
alty plus the cost of refinancing. Such a prepayment penalty would 
make refinancing cost prohibitive. The dilemma is that the more 
than $400 per month increase in your payment may be income pro-
hibitive, leaving you with a no-win decision to make.
One of the benefits of a loan modification over refinancing is that 
you don’t get hit with a prepayment penalty. During negotiations 
for a loan modification, try to have any prepayment penalty elimi-
nated so you can freely refinance in the future if you can get a 
better deal.
Requiring mandatory arbitration
To protect themselves from lawsuits, some lenders attempt to 
discourage or prohibit borrowers from taking legal action. Instead, 
their contracts call for mandatory arbitration for any disagreements 
between the lender and the borrower.
Limiting your legal rights in a mortgage contract may not be ille-
gal, but it’s unethical. Your attorney may be able to convince the 
courts that this practice, along with other questionable activities, 
constitutes predatory lending.
High-pressure sales tactics
At the height of the mortgage lending frenzy, many loan originators 
engaged in activities best described as “pump and dump.” They 
would pump up the benefits of their mortgage loan products and 
then dump the borrowers into high-cost, high-risk loans. If anyone 
employed any of the following high-pressure sales tactics to sell 
you financing secured by your home, you may be a victim of 
predatory lending:
 
✓ The loan originator quoted you much more attractive terms 
and lower fees on the Good Faith Estimate than the actual 
terms and fees presented on the HUD-1 at closing.
 
✓ The loan originator tried to convince you that it was your only 
chance of financing or refinancing your home, or discouraged 
you from comparison shopping for the best financing.

 Chapter 14: Auditing Your Mortgage Loan 207
 
✓ The loan originator informed you that the Federal Housing 
Administration (FHA) insures your loan, protecting you from 
foreclosure. It does not. FHA insurance only protects the lender.
 
✓ Your loan originator told you that refinancing would solve 
your credit or financial problems.
 
✓ A contractor presented you with a good deal on a home or 
home improvement only if you financed through the 
contractor or through its recommended lender.
Recalling and Documenting 
the Experience
Buying a home is a significant event — not quite on par with a high 
school graduation, wedding day, or birth of a child, but sort of in 
the same league. Homeowners usually have some memory of the 
processes they went through to finance or refinance their homes, 
even if the details are a little fuzzy. (Sometimes, all borrowers 
remember is that it happened so fast.)
To pick some of the fuzz off the details and identify signs of preda-
tory lending, take some time to think back and document your 
experience with the loan originator and lender as you remember 
it. If a co-borrower was involved (your spouse or partner, for 
instance), team up to piece together the details of your experience.
 
Pull out any documents you kept related to the purchase, financing, 
or refinancing of any loans you’ve taken out against your home. 
You should have received a closing packet with each loan. These 
documents often contain details that can trigger the recollection of 
other key details. For more about analyzing your loan documents, 
see the next section “Combing Through Your Loan Documents for 
Fraud Flags.”
As you piece together the details of your experience, try to answer 
the following questions:
 
✓ Do you feel as though your loan originator sold you a bad 
loan? If so, why?
 
✓ Did you feel pressured or rushed during the application 
process? If so, what made you feel that way?
 
✓ Did you apply over the phone without ever meeting your loan 
originator in person and without receiving a copy of the 
completed loan application?

Part IV: Dealing with an Uncooperative Lender  
208
 
✓ Did the loan originator encourage you to fudge the numbers 
on your loan application or otherwise direct you in how to make 
your numbers appear more flattering than they actually were?
 
✓ Did the loan originator have you sign an application that con-
tained blanks he or she filled in later?
 
✓ Looking back, do you feel that the nature of the loan was mis-
represented to you at the time? In other words, do you feel as 
though you were set up?
 
✓ Were you encouraged to refinance your mortgage loan mul-
tiple times over a short period?
 
✓ Do you feel as though the loan originator overcharged you in 
closing costs and other fees? Were the costs not disclosed or 
not explained to you?
If you answer “yes” to any of these questions, consider consulting 
an attorney for assistance in digging a little deeper for evidence. 
These questions are intended only to assist you in identifying 
potentially unethical lending practices. You still need to confirm 
any suspicions with evidence.
Combing Through Your Loan 
Documents for Fraud Flags
The best evidence that a lender violated a borrower’s rights is 
usually sitting in the borrower’s filing cabinet in the form of the 
Good Faith Estimate (GFE) and closing documents. We encourage 
you to pull out these documents, dust them off, and examine them 
for signs of predatory lending along with any RESPA, TILA, or HOEPA 
violations. (See Chapter 6 for more about gathering essential docu-
ments.) In the following sections, we provide some guidance on 
what to look for in these documents.
 
The well-trained eye of an experienced attorney is better suited 
to identifying potential violations. We strongly encourage you to 
enlist the assistance of a qualified attorney, as explained in the 
section “Hiring a Pro to Do It All for You” later in this chapter.
Comparing the GFE to the HUD-1
Perhaps the easiest violation to spot is the ol’ bait and switch. 
The loan originator quotes you loan terms and fees upfront on the 
Good Faith Estimate (GFE), but the HUD-1 presented at closing 

 Chapter 14: Auditing Your Mortgage Loan 209
quotes a loan with a higher interest rate and closing costs or some 
other loan product entirely, such as an adjustable-rate mortgage 
when you were led to believe it would have a fixed rate.
Pull out the GFE and HUD-1 and compare them line by line. 
Highlight any discrepancies between the two, regardless of how 
minor they may seem.
In addition to seeing whether the details on the GFE and HUD-1 
match up, you should also consider whether the costs outlined on 
the HUD-1 were in line with the rest of the market when you closed 
on the loan. This is usually difficult for the typical homeowner 
who’s understandably no expert in the mortgage lending industry. 
If you’re unsure of whether a particular fee you paid was excessive, 
ask a mortgage broker (preferably not the one who originated your 
loan) or a real estate attorney in your area.
Inspecting the Universal Residential 
Loan Application (1003)
The Universal Residential Loan Application, or 1003, can be a 
tremendous source of evidence for homeowners that the loan 
originator or lender acted unethically. Inspect your 1003 closely 
for the following signs that the lender committed a violation:
 
✓ Information that wasn’t on the form when you signed it: 
Someone filled in missing information or changed what had 
been written down.
 
✓ Co-borrowers you don’t know: Some unscrupulous loan 
originator added co-borrowers to approve a loan when you 
didn’t qualify on your own.
 
✓ Inflated income: Facts and figures about employment and 
income that were incorrect based on your situation at the 
time should raise suspicion, especially if you supplied 
verification documents to the loan officer showing the 
correct information.
 
✓ An inflated estimate of the value of assets you owned 
at the time.
 
✓ Double-booking the home’s value to present a positive net 
worth: To boost a borrower’s net worth (assets minus liabilities), 
the loan officer listed the home twice as an asset but only 
once as a liability. For example, if you owned a $200,000 home 
and still owed $180,000 on it, double-booking would make it 
look as though you had $40,000 equity in the home rather 
than the true amount of $20,000.

Part IV: Dealing with an Uncooperative Lender  
210
 
✓ Bank accounts or liquid asset accounts that aren’t yours or 
that have strange numbers associated with them.
 
✓ Failure to include installment accounts or debts you know 
you told the loan officer you were obligated to make pay-
ments on each month: The loan originator kept some debts off 
the books to lower the debt-to-income ratio to an acceptable 
level. For more about debt-to-income ratios, see Chapter 2.
 
✓ Failure to include other real estate you owned and had 
outstanding mortgages on.
 
Before crying foul, try to recall your conversations with your loan 
originator concerning the loan application. If the loan originator 
clearly explained the form and answered all your questions, and if 
you knew what you were getting yourself into, perhaps your loan 
originator committed no foul. Even if your lender is at fault, it’s 
likely to claim that you were complicit in any misrepresentations. 
If you were complicit, you may not have a case. If you weren’t com-
plicit, be prepared to counter any accusations with the evidence 
you’re collecting.
Examining your mortgage 
and promissory note
The mortgage and the note are the final written memorial of the 
agreement between lender and borrower. Unfortunately, the mort-
gage usually provides little or no evidence of illegal or unethical 
lending practices; it merely consummates the lender/borrower 
relationship.
 
If you have an adjustable-rate mortgage, check your mortgage for a 
rider that contains the details of how the loan can adjust — includ-
ing the base interest rate, when the rate will adjust and how often, 
and the maximum interest rate. If the terms specified seem too 
burdensome, they may be a sign of predatory lending. Look closely 
for the following:
 
✓ Convoluted or complicated interest rate calculations
 
✓ A very volatile index for an adjustable-rate mortgage
 
✓ Very short periods of time between adjustment periods
 
✓ A large margin percentage (for example, index plus 9.75 percent)
 
✓ A high minimum interest rate, especially if it’s immediately 
above what the current index plus margin would be, meaning 
you have no chance of receiving the benefit of a low index at 
the time of rate adjustment

 Chapter 14: Auditing Your Mortgage Loan 211
The promissory note typically contains more evidence of foul play 
if it occurred, but even strong evidence can be tough for the aver-
age borrower to pick out. Following are a few items you may want 
to look at closely:
 
✓ A huge prepayment penalty that extends for a long period
 
✓ A very short introductory period, so any benefit from the 
teaser rate is quickly swallowed up by the increase in the 
interest rate at the first adjustment
 
✓ A loan amount completely out of line for comparable homes 
in the area (usually supported by an inflated appraisal)
 
✓ Loan payments that represent the lion’s share of your income 
each month
 
✓ 100 percent or higher loan-to-value (LTV) with interest-only 
payments and a relatively short timeline before a balloon 
payment is due, meaning refinancing is only possible if prop-
erty values rise suddenly and significantly or if you take out 
another 100-percent-plus LTV loan
 
✓ A balloon payment that triggers a prepayment penalty, mean-
ing you’re required to pay back the loan, but by doing so you 
incur a stiff prepayment penalty
 
✓ A very low introductory interest rate on an ARM used to help 
you qualify for a loan — for example, your loan originator knew 
you didn’t qualify for a 6 percent fixed-rate loan, so he put you 
into an adjustable-rate mortgage with an introductory rate of 
1.5 percent, and now that your interest rate is at 9 percent, 
you can’t afford the payments
 
The provisions in the note may not constitute predatory lending, 
but if you read through them and conclude that nobody in their 
right mind would agree to such terms if they understood them, 
you have a pretty clear indication that you’re a victim of predatory 
lending. This is especially true if you had a credit score at the time 
that would have qualified you for a more stable loan product, such 
as a 30-year fixed-rate loan.
Hiring a Pro to Do It All for You
By following the advice in this chapter, you may be able to identify 
several symptoms of unethical lending practices related to your 
mortgage loan. Many of the most common signs, however, are 
identifiable only in the context of the marketplace. For example, 
determining whether the interest rate your lender charged is 
excessive or certain fees are unwarranted depends a great deal on 
what other lenders in the same market were charging at the time

and your status as a credit-worthy borrower. This is why we rec-
ommend hiring a professional to perform a forensic audit of your 
mortgage loan.
A professional who’s well trained in legal issues and the accounting 
practices surrounding mortgage loans can often spot questionable 
practices that seem perfectly normal to the average consumer. In 
addition, a forensic mortgage audit can provide you with leverage 
in negotiating an affordable loan modification, stopping any fore-
closure actions, and perhaps even pursuing legal action against the 
lender or the company that brokered your loan.
 
Don’t hire the first forensic mortgage auditor you find on the Web. 
Perform your due diligence and select a reputable expert who has 
plenty of experience auditing mortgage loans. Follow the same 
guidelines for choosing a forensic mortgage auditor as you would 
for choosing a loan modification expert (see Chapter 4). You may 
even want to choose an attorney who serves a dual role — one 
who can perform the forensic audit and oversee the loan modifica-
tion for you.
Anticipating the Lender’s Response 
to Any Legal Claims
Just because you have a loaded gun doesn’t mean you should aim 
and fire every time you feel threatened. In the same way, having 
proof that a lender violated certain state or federal laws doesn’t 
necessarily mean you should file a lawsuit. Sometimes a rational 
presentation of the evidence is enough to get you what you need 
without a long and messy legal battle.
 
Lending law violations rarely result in huge monetary judgments, 
but they can help get you favorable terms in a loan modification.
When you kick down the door and scream “Mortgage fraud!” and 
“Predatory lending!” lenders understandably get a little defensive. 
Tempering your findings with tact can result in the most benefi-
cial outcome for you. Many lenders are willing to correct broker 
wrongs but for obvious reasons would prefer to do so out of court 
and beyond the media spotlight. The lender may even be more 
willing to offer more favorable terms than you could get by trying 
to force its hand in court. Look into, or have your attorney look 
into, the best options and processes to pursue to get you what you 
want. It does no good to claim victory only to have the cost of the 
war outweigh the spoils. (In Chapter 15, we show you how to use 
the information you gathered in the most effective way.)

I
f your lender fails to listen to your request to modify your loan, 
or if you’ve fallen victim to predatory lending practices, you 
may need or want to play a heavier hand. Government regulatory 
and law enforcement agencies are in place at least partially to pro-
tect consumer rights. By knowing which agencies can assist you 
and how to spur them into action, you can often make progress. In 
this chapter, we show you how to rally the troops in a pursuit of 
consumer justice.
 
Keep detailed records of everything you do, every document you 
send and receive, and every phone call you make, whether you’re 
speaking with your lender, your attorney, state or federal regula-
tors, or law enforcement personnel. Jotting down dates, times, and 
names of all parties involved is particularly important. For more 
about keeping accurate, detailed records, check out Chapter 9.
Appendix A has a list of state attorneys general, government agen-
cies, and advocacy groups that may be able and willing to support 
your efforts to secure justice.
Filing a Formal Complaint 
with Your Lender
You don’t always need to file a lawsuit to secure your legal rights. 
Sometimes, reminding your lender of your rights as a consumer

and what’s at stake is sufficient to encourage it to do the right thing. 
We recommend starting with a gentle nudge and ramping up the 
pressure until you begin to see results.
 
Filing a lawsuit sounds easy enough, but it can be very costly, 
time-consuming, and aggravating (refer to the later section “Filing 
a Lawsuit” for the complete story). If you can accomplish the same 
or nearly the same goals without suing your lender, you’re usually 
better off handling matters outside the legal system.
Start by writing a brief letter to your lender explaining your rights 
and how you think the lender violated those rights. See Figure 15-1 
for a sample letter. Specify the date on which you expect a response, 
giving the lender sufficient time to respond (10 to 20 days should be 
enough), and explain what your next step will be if you don’t receive 
a satisfactory response by that date.
 
Send your letter in a separate envelope, not with your mortgage 
payment. When waiting to hear from your lender, continue to 
make your payments as you’re able. Always lodge your complaint 
with the lender’s consumer complaint department or the depart-
ment designed to handle these special investigations. Lenders are 
required by law to keep a record of complaints for auditing. Having 
your complaints on file can also strengthen your case.
If you don’t receive a satisfactory response to your letter on the 
specified date, send a follow-up letter. Be sure to carbon copy your 
state attorney general or the regulatory agency of your choice (see 
the following section “Filing a Complaint”) on this letter. In your 
follow-up letter, do each of the following:
 
✓ Reference your previous letter and summarize its main points
 
✓ Mention that you expected to hear from the lender on the 
specified date and did not
 
✓ Explain what you’re now doing in response to the lender’s 
failure to reply
 
✓ Describe what you want the lender to do and by what date
 
✓ Explain what you will do if the lender fails to comply with 
your request
You can also choose to file a complaint with federal regulatory 
agencies (see “Filing with federal regulators” later in this chapter).

Dear Sir or Madam:
I understand that Section 6 of the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act 
(RESPA) provides me with certain rights. I am submitting this qualified 
written request in an effort to resolve an issue that occurred during the 
origination of my loan. I believe my income and credit score at the time I 
signed for my current mortgage loan qualified me for a loan with a more 
favorable rate and terms. I believe I was inappropriately placed into a 
subprime adjustable-rate loan that was not explained to me or understood by 
me at that time. My credit score, income, and payment history should have 
qualified me for a fixed-rate mortgage at a rate around 6.25 percent.
I have already submitted an application requesting a loan modification and 
have received a letter of denial, dated January 10, 2013, claiming that I could 
afford to make the payments on the loan I had signed for. However, I believe 
that the loan officer who sold me the loan committed a RESPA violation, and I 
am requesting a loan modification in an effort to settle this matter.
I have enclosed the following items to show that at the time I obtained my 
existing mortgage, I was well qualified for a low-interest fixed-rate mortgage:
• 
Pay stubs dated just prior to obtaining the mortgage
• 
Copies of my W-2s for the two years leading up to the 
mortgage origination date
• 
Copies of my federal income tax returns leading up to the 
mortgage origination date
• 
Copy of my credit report at the time of my mortgage 
origination
I understand that under Section 6 of RESPA you are required to acknowledge 
my request within 20 business days and must try to resolve the issue within 60 
business days. 
Sincerely, 
Sam Spade
Figure 15-1: Sample letter of complaint.

Part IV: Dealing with an Uncooperative Lender

If you suspect that your lender or loan originator committed a vio-
lation in placing you in your current loan, request that the lender 
perform an internal audit of your loan file. (Hiring an expert to 
perform an audit may be necessary later.) Write a letter, as sug-
gested earlier in this section, pointing out the suspected violations. 
This can be part of your “complaint” letter or a separate letter 
addressed to the department in charge of handing legal matters. 
(In most cases, the complaints department can route the letter to 
the proper department, if necessary.)
Considering legal options
Sometimes sizing up your situation means looking for possible legal options in 
the application process that placed you in your current mortgage. I (Ralph) was 
involved in a case that resulted in the homeowner discovering an option she hadn’t 
realized was available.
Like many homeowners, she refinanced during the refinance boom of the mid-
2000s. Unfortunately, her lender placed her in an adjustable-rate mortgage that 
was scheduled to adjust up significantly very soon after we had met. As she’d done 
in the past, this homeowner wanted to refinance out of trouble, but this time, she 
couldn’t; property values had dropped significantly, so she could no longer qualify 
for refinancing. She figured she had one option: foreclosure. She would live in the 
house rent-free during the redemption period, save some money, and then move 
to an apartment.
During our initial conversation, I suspected that the mortgage broker was guilty of 
some unethical lending practices in obtaining approval for this loan. Answers to my 
follow-up questions confirmed my suspicions. This homeowner was likely a victim 
of mortgage broker greed. The lure of loan origination fees apparently clouded this 
broker’s judgment.
With the homeowner’s assistance, I gathered some additional evidence, including 
the documentation used to obtain loan approval. After examining the documenta-
tion, I concluded that this homeowner probably wasn’t qualified for the loan she 
was in. And I discovered that the property certainly hadn’t been worth as much as 
the appraised value used to secure funding for the loan; the appraisal was inflated. 
The appraiser initially arrived at one value, which likely didn’t meet an acceptable 
value for loan approval, so he reissued the appraisal for a higher value. To jus-
tify the new, higher value, the appraiser listed comparable properties that weren’t 
really comparable. I’d seen this trick before.
I advised my client to seek legal counsel, and she did. With the assistance of a 
competent attorney, she was able to convince her lender to provide her with a loan 
modification that allowed her to keep her home and lower her monthly mortgage 
payments to an affordable level.

 Chapter 15: Applying Some Legal Pressure 217
Filing a Complaint
Regardless of whether you file your own lawsuit against a lender, 
you can file a complaint with state and federal regulatory agencies 
to encourage them to investigate. The more credible complaints 
the agency receives, the more likely it is to launch an investigation 
into the lender’s practices. Agencies often ask whether any litiga-
tion is pending regarding the matter stated in the complaint; if so, 
they may suspend investigations until that suit is resolved.
 
If you’re working with an attorney, don’t do anything without your 
attorney’s permission. If your attorney is negotiating with your 
lender and your lender gets word that you’re filing separate griev-
ances, you could completely undermine your attorney’s efforts.
Taking action at the state level
Each state has agencies to protect consumer rights, including a 
state attorney general; real estate commission; banking authority; 
and other regulatory, certification, and licensing boards. These 
agencies don’t function as free private attorneys, filing lawsuits on 
behalf of citizens. Instead, they primarily take disciplinary action 
against professionals they determine have acted inappropriately. 
The good news is that the threat of disciplinary action may be 
enough to convince your lender to cooperate with you.
In the following sections, we tell you how to get in touch with your 
state attorney general and track down state regulatory bodies in 
order to find out more about filing a complaint.
Contacting your attorney general
Each state’s attorney general has a host of responsibilities for 
protecting the state’s citizens’ rights, freedoms, and safety. These 
responsibilities can generally be grouped into two categories:
 
✓ Consumer services, such as no-call lists, privacy rights, over-
sight of various industries (including healthcare), Medicaid 
fraud, and unclaimed assets
 
✓ Legal services related to litigation, appeals, victim assistance, 
and complaints filed against attorneys or judges
When you contact your state attorney general, you want the con-
sumer services division.

Part IV: Dealing with an Uncooperative Lender  
218
 
Appendix A provides Web site and contact information for the 
state attorneys general. Most of the Web sites have a complaint 
form you can download, print, complete, and then mail. Read and 
follow the instructions carefully. If you don’t have access to the 
Internet, try your local library, or call your attorney general and 
request that a complaint form be sent to you in the mail.
Your state attorney general’s office may not be able to address 
your complaint itself, but it can refer the matter to whichever state 
agency is best equipped to follow up on it.
Filing with state regulatory agencies
State regulatory agencies specialize in different areas, so they 
may be very responsive to your requests and yield a great deal of 
influence over the business or individual you feel acted inappro-
priately. This is especially true if the agency or its commissioner is 
responsible for approving or renewing the license of the business 
or individual. The challenge is in tracking down the best agency for 
the job.
Head to your favorite Internet search engine, and search for 
your state by name followed by the word “state” — for example, 
“California state.” This usually calls up a link for your state’s cen-
tral Web site, where you can find links to state services.
Upon arriving at your state’s Web site, you’re pretty much on your 
own and have to browse for consumer-related assistance. Some 
sites offer links for filing a complaint. Others provide a list of links 
to the different regulatory agencies that accept consumer com-
plaints. Look for the agency or office that’s most likely to regulate 
the type of business you’re filing a complaint against, as follows:
 
✓ Mortgage broker: Your state may have a licensing or certifica-
tion board for mortgage brokers. In many states, the secretary 
of state provides oversight.
 
✓ Real estate agent: Almost all states have a real estate com-
mission that provides oversight for the real estate industry, 
including certification for real estate agents.
 
✓ Lender: Every state has a regulator in charge of banking. The 
federal government also has several regulatory bodies that 
provide oversight for the lending industry, as explained in the 
following section “Filing with federal regulators.”
 
If you can’t figure out which office to contact, call an office that 
sounds close to what you want. State offices are usually pretty 
good about transferring callers to the right departments.

 Chapter 15: Applying Some Legal Pressure 219
Filing with federal regulators
The federal government knows the critical role that the housing 
industry plays in the health of the national economy. As a result, 
it has several agencies (often referred to as administrations, com-
missions, or boards) in place to make sure the system operates in 
accordance with the rules and regulations already in place. We 
provide contact information for the most popular and powerful of 
these agencies in Appendix A.
 
For a searchable directory of federally regulated lending institu-
tions, visit www.ffiec.gov, the Web site of the Federal Financial 
Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC). Click the Consumer Help 
Center link and then the Bank Complaints or Questions link. Enter 
the name of your lending institution, and the site displays the 
name of the regulatory agency you should contact.
Call in the muscle
Sometimes having some well-placed friends with muscle can help you convince 
your lender to sit down with you at the negotiating table. This is exactly what hap-
pened for some homeowners in Arizona, California, Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, 
Iowa, Michigan, North Carolina, Ohio, Texas, and Washington who had fallen victim 
to one lender’s particularly notorious lending practices. They called in the muscle, 
and the attorneys general of these states joined forces and decided to do some-
thing about it. As a result, the lender entered into a settlement whereby it agreed 
to modify loans on a grand scale.
The resulting settlement, although not an admission of wrongdoing, means that 
thousands of homeowners in danger of losing their homes are now eligible for a 
streamlined modification and/or rate reduction. (Of course, homeowners must meet 
certain eligibility requirements to qualify, but this shows at least one case in which 
someone was looking out for the little guy.)
As an individual homeowner, you may not have the power to pressure your lender 
into approving an affordable loan modification, but with the help of other home-
owners in similar situations, you may be able to spur a giant, like a state attorney 
general, into action to take up the cause on your behalf and help the lender see that 
loan modification is clearly in everyone’s best interest.

Part IV: Dealing with an Uncooperative Lender  
220
Upon contacting a regulatory agency, you need to file a formal com-
plaint, usually in writing, although some agencies may be willing to 
take your information over the phone. Be prepared to supply the 
agency with the following information:
 
✓ Your personal information, including name, address, phone 
number, and e-mail address
 
✓ Your lender’s or servicer’s name and contact information
 
✓ Your loan number(s)
 
✓ A brief description of the problem you’re having
 
✓ A list of what you’ve already done to remedy the situation
 
✓ A brief statement of what you think the lender needs to do to 
make this right with you
Contacting professional associations
Many industries attempt to police themselves to set and maintain 
standards, enforce rules, and boost consumer confidence. If you 
have a credible grievance with a certain real estate or lending pro-
fessional, consider filing a complaint with any professional associa-
tion the business or individual belongs to.
 
If an individual holds any type of state-issued license, he or she 
is subject to disciplinary procedures. Although most agencies 
(public and private) clearly state that they won’t serve as private 
attorneys, they can put the lender on notice, help move your case 
to the front of the line, and perhaps even encourage the lender 
to agree to a favorable settlement. If and when the time comes 
to negotiate a settlement, having an attorney on hand is always a 
good idea.
 
If the association compiles a disciplinary report or a findings report, 
request a copy of it. If the professional association finds the conduct 
of the professional unethical or in violation of regulatory rules, you 
should have that report for your records. (If you need an attorney 
for your case, he or she should have a copy of the report as well.)
One of the best ways to track down state associations is to hop on 
the Internet and search your state followed by the industry — real 
estate, mortgage bankers, mortgage brokers, appraisers, title com-
panies, home inspectors, and so on. Following are the Web sites of 
some national professional associations that may also be helpful:
 
✓ National Association of REALTORS: www.realtor.org
 
✓ Mortgage Bankers Association of America: www.mbaa.org

 Chapter 15: Applying Some Legal Pressure 221
 
✓ National Association of Mortgage Brokers: www.namb.org
 
✓ Appraisal Institute: www.appraisalinstitute.org
Following through on your complaint
 
Regardless of which regulatory agency you contact, always follow 
up a few days after filing your complaint to make sure it reached 
the agency and is in the system. Typically, the agency assigns the 
complaint to a case representative. Try to find out the person’s 
name, identification number, and phone number, so you know 
whom to contact for follow-ups. Then follow up by asking these 
questions:
 
✓ When will your lender (or individual in question) be notified 
of your complaint?
 
✓ How many days does your lender (or individual) have to 
respond to your complaint?
 
✓ What happens if your lender (or individual) fails to respond 
by the specified date?
 
✓ Have any other complaints been filed against the lender (or 
individual)? If so, how many? The more complaints, the better 
for you; when it comes to regulatory agencies, the squeakiest 
wheel gets the most attention.
If the lender or individual that you file a complaint against 
responds to your complaint (and they usually do), expect them 
to deny your allegations and explain away the issues. If you’re not 
satisfied and have hard evidence that your lender (or individual) 
has broken the rules, submit a rebuttal letter to the regulatory 
agency so it doesn’t close the case. If you don’t respond, the regu-
latory agency typically assumes “case closed.”
 
Don’t let slow-moving wheels of justice crush your determination. 
Remain persistent and remind the agency case representative that 
you’re going to keep checking in until all issues are resolved to 
your satisfaction.
Filing a Lawsuit
When all else fails, take ’em to court . . . assuming, of course, 
you’re willing to invest the time, effort, and perhaps even cash to 
prove your claim. This section outlines the lawsuit process, so you 
know how to get started and what to expect.

Part IV: Dealing with an Uncooperative Lender  
222
 
If you live in a state that doesn’t practice judicial foreclosure, filing 
a lawsuit against the lender may delay the foreclosure sale, giving 
you time to pursue other options, as covered in Chapter 3. By filing 
a suit against the lender, you can bring a nonjudicial foreclosure 
into the court system to provide yourself with additional legal 
rights and perhaps a more favorable timeline.
Ordering a mortgage audit
Whether you decide to represent yourself or hire an attorney, hire 
an experienced professional to audit your mortgage. It may cost 
over $1,000, but a mortgage audit arms you or your attorney with 
the firepower you need to fight the good fight . . . and win. A com-
prehensive audit
 
✓ Assesses the strengths and weaknesses of your case.
 
✓ Ensures that you or your attorney includes all viable allega-
tions in the complaint.
 
✓ Provides leverage for settling the case out of court, which is 
almost always in the borrower’s best interest.
 
An audit report can serve as valuable evidence in court, especially if 
it identifies blatant violations. If the facts speak for themselves, your 
lender’s position becomes very tenuous, and your lender is likely to 
push for a settlement. With strong evidence in hand, you have the 
leverage you need to negotiate a very attractive settlement.
Getting up to speed on the procedure
Filing a lawsuit is a complicated endeavor best handled by an expe-
rienced attorney. However, as the plaintiff, you should have a clear 
idea of the steps involved in filing a lawsuit:
 
1. You or your attorney draft the complaint.
 
2. You or your attorney file the complaint with the court clerk 
who then issues summons to appear. You have the whole 
package served on the parties involved and provide the 
court with proof of service.
 
3. The defendant (the lender in this case) is given time to file its 
answer to the complaint. The answer may include counter-
claims and may be accompanied by a motion to dismiss the 
complaint altogether or at least to dismiss certain claims.

 Chapter 15: Applying Some Legal Pressure 223
 
4. You file a response (called a reply) to the answer and/or 
any motions filed, which may include a brief of the issue 
and/or amendment to your complaint.
 
5. The defendant will already have filed or will file a brief in 
support of the motion to dismiss.
 
6. A judge schedules a hearing on the motion to dismiss (if 
one was filed).
 
7. If your complaint survives a motion to dismiss, the judge 
schedules the case for trial and establishes a timeline for 
discovery, pretrial or settlement conferences, and so on.
 
8. At trial, each side presents its proofs before a judge or a 
jury who then issues a decision, preferably in your favor.
Eight steps, short and sweet, right? Well, not exactly and certainly 
not in most cases. The process can be very long, drawn out, and 
time-consuming, and this timeline doesn’t account for appeals if 
any are filed after the decision.
State court and federal court procedures can vary. Check the state 
or federal court rules for where to file your complaint and what to 
include. Court Web sites generally provide you with an explanation 
of the civil process, the local or special rules for that court, and 
other very useful information such as fees, court costs, and docket 
information. If you’re representing yourself, check your court’s 
Web site; it can be an invaluable resource.
Securing professional representation
By reading this book, you’ve proven that you’re no fool, but as the 
old saying goes, “A person who chooses to represent himself in 
court has a fool for a client.” If you choose to file a lawsuit against 
your lender or an individual involved in your mortgage origination, 
we advise hiring an attorney who’s skilled and experienced in real 
estate and mortgage banking — someone who understands the 
rules and regulations that lenders and loan originators were sup-
posed to follow when they sold and approved your loan.
One of the best ways to dig up a qualified attorney is to network 
with real estate professionals you already know and trust (that 
rules out the professional who sold you the bad loan). You can 
also ask friends, relatives, neighbors, and colleagues for referrals, 
but that means disclosing your situation. If you have no leads, con-
sider searching the American Bar Association online directory for 
an attorney at www.abanet.org. Click Public Resources and then 

Part IV: Dealing with an Uncooperative Lender  
224
Lawyer Locator; you can search by town, city, county, or state and 
then by area of specialization (we recommend choosing Debtor 
And Creditor or Real Estate).
Another option is to run an Internet search on the issue that’s 
applicable in your case and see which attorneys pop up as having 
written articles on that issue. However, be sure to validate the per-
son’s credentials with the state bar association to which he or she 
belongs . . . or claims to belong.
 
Perform your due diligence in selecting an attorney, as you would 
in selecting a professional to provide any service. (For details on 
vetting your options, check out Chapter 4.) It doesn’t hurt to find 
an attorney or law firm that has represented plaintiffs successfully 
against your specific lender in the past. If your lender sees you’ve 
engaged an attorney who knows the issues and has held the lend-
er’s feet to the fire before, settlement is more likely.
Calling the Cops
Although you rarely hear about it in the news, real estate and 
mortgage fraud is rampant. We believe that massive fraud is one 
of the primary contributing factors to the mortgage meltdown and 
resulting foreclosure epidemic. Unfortunately, much of this fraud 
was committed under the radar in a gray zone that law enforce-
ment and regulatory agencies prefer to steer clear of. However, 
if you believe that the actions of one or more parties involved in 
your mortgage loan rise to the level of criminal activity, turn the 
matter over to law enforcement.
 
Pressing criminal charges is only warranted if you feel you’ve been 
conned out of some money. It’s not something you do just because 
your lender is being uncooperative.
Don’t bother calling your local police department or county sher-
iff. Chances are pretty good that they’ll just refer you to the state 
police or Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), so start there. Your 
state may have a mortgage fraud task force that works alongside 
the FBI to investigate real estate and mortgage fraud and bring the 
perpetrators to justice.
When you contact law enforcement, provide them with the same 
information that federal regulators would need. Refer to the section 
“Filing with federal regulators” earlier in this chapter for details.

Ten Tips for 
Long-Term Success
In This Chapter
▶ Getting a good loan modification from the get-go
▶ Reining in expenses with or without the help of a credit counselor
▶ Joining the ranks of neo-hagglers
▶ Involving the entire family
B
y some estimates, the recidivism (a $5 word for “relapse”) rate 
for homeowners who receive a loan modification is upward of 
60 percent in the first eight months. The cause usually can be traced 
back to the fact that the initial loan modification didn’t result in a 
truly affordable monthly mortgage payment or that the homeowners 
failed to address the root cause of their initial default — insufficient 
income or excess expenditures. In this chapter, we provide ten tips 
for staying out of financial trouble in the long-term.
Get the Best Deal You Can
One of the problems with negotiating a lower mortgage payment 
is that the lender’s goal is to shake as much money out of you as 
possible. As a result, lenders often push for and homeowners often 
agree to a lower monthly payment that’s not really affordable. Or 
the new monthly payment makes the homeowner’s budget so tight 
that he’s one unexpected car repair or medical bill away from fall-
ing into default again.
One of the keys to long-term success is to negotiate the absolute 
best deal you can get the first time around — a deal that leaves 
you with a financial buffer to handle unexpected expenses.
 
If your lender refuses to budge and you really can’t afford the pay-
ment being offered, don’t agree to the deal unless the loan modifi-
cation provides you with sufficient temporary relief to implement a 
long-term solution, such as selling your home.

Get Credit Counseling
In Chapter 2, we encourage you to rough out a budget so you know 
where all your money is coming from and where it’s going. If you’re 
really not into budgeting, you’re going to do either a lousy job writ-
ing up your budget or an even lousier job sticking to it, and you’ll 
benefit from working with a credit counselor. A credit counselor 
can assist you in the following ways:
 
✓ Analyze your current financial situation and set reasonable 
goals to trim spending
 
✓ Itemize your current spending and group expenses by category
 
✓ Prioritize credit accounts to pay off high-interest credit first
 
✓ Negotiate workout solutions with your other creditors
 
✓ Keep the bill collectors at bay
 
✓ Hold you accountable, so you stick with the plan
 
Work with a reliable and reputable credit counselor or agency. The 
United States Trustee Program provides a searchable directory 
of reputable counseling agencies at www.usdoj.gov/ust/eo/
bapcpa/ccde/cc_approved.htm. The Federal Trade Commission 
(FTC) offers an informative online article on how to choose a repu-
table credit counseling agency at www.ftc.gov/bcp/edu/pubs/
consumer/credit/cre26.shtm, or you can check out Credit Repair 
Kit For Dummies by Steve Bucci (Wiley). If your state requires credit 
counseling agencies to be licensed or registered, contact the agency 
that regulates the industry, make sure the agency is licensed and 
certified, and check for licensing complaints or disciplinary actions.
Try Modifying Other Loans, Too
When the economy suffers, everyone hurts, including banks, credit 
card companies, and new car dealerships. They all face the very real 
possibility that many of their customers will stop making payments 
or be forced into bankruptcy. Like your mortgage lender, many 
of these institutions would rather you pay less than pay nothing. 
Creditors who hold unsecured debt (that’s debt not secured by a 
valuable asset, such as your home) are particularly at risk of losing 
out if you declare bankruptcy.
 
A new car loan may be one of the best places to start. By some esti-
mates, a new car loses up to $8,000 in value as soon as you drive it 
off the lot. If the finance company repos the car and tries to resell 
it, the company stands to lose $8,000. This fact coupled with a 

 Chapter 16: Ten Tips for Long-Term Success 229
previously good payment history may be all you need to convince 
the finance company to work out a solution with you.
Try cutting a deal with your credit card company, too. They can be 
tough negotiators, but it’s worth a try. You may be able to convince 
them to lower your interest rate or drop a late payment penalty. You 
won’t know unless you ask. The worst they can do is say “no.”
If you have student loans, contact the servicer and ask about 
solutions to provide relief. Many government-backed student 
loans offer “out of work” forbearance so you can put off making 
payments until you find a job. If you lost your job and go back to 
school to advance your skills, most student loans cease to require 
payments. Call or go online to explore your options.
 
Get all loan modification agreements, even those with smaller 
companies, in writing.
Prioritize Your Debt Payments
Most credit counselors are going to tell you to pay more than the 
minimum monthly payments on your credit card bills and other 
high-interest accounts. However, paying more than the minimum 
due on all your accounts isn’t the savviest strategy. Prioritize your 
accounts first.
 
Find your most recent credit card statements and inspect them 
carefully to see which one is charging the highest interest. This is 
the credit card balance you want to pay off first. You may be able 
to transfer the balance to a credit card account that’s charging a 
lower interest rate, but find out how much it’ll cost you (if anything) 
before making the transfer.
Slash Discretionary Spending
Discretionary spending consists of unnecessary expenses, such as 
going out for dinner and a movie or buying fried chicken when you 
could bake one yourself for less. These are the expenses that sink 
most budgets, so here are a few suggestions on how to cut back:
 
✓ Team up with your partner, if you have a partner. When 
both of you have a say in how much each of you spends and 
for what, you can hold one another accountable.
 
✓ Grocery shop once a week. The more times you pop into the 
grocery store, the more likely you are to make an impulse 
purchase . . . or two or three.

Part V: The Part of Tens  
230
 
✓ Buy only what’s on the grocery list. The person in the family 
with the strongest shopping self-control — the one who’s best 
at buying only what’s on the list and at finding bargains — 
should do all the shopping. And don’t be too proud to clip cou-
pons; they can make a significant impact on your bottom line.
 
✓ Eat in. You spend a lot more for food when someone else 
prepares it. That goes for fountain drinks, too. And don’t cheat 
by purchasing prepared foods at the grocery store; those fried 
chicken strips from the deli and TV dinners can be very 
expensive, too.
 
✓ Trim your phone bill. One phone for the family should be 
sufficient. Also, call your phone company and look into more 
affordable plans.
 
✓ Trim your cable TV bill. You can live without the premium 
channels.
 
✓ Cut back on vacations. If you and your partner take separate 
vacations, those should be the first expenses that get the ax. 
Look at ways to pare back on your other vacations, too.
 
✓ Dress fashionably poor. You don’t need to change your ward-
robe every year. In addition, you may be able to find great 
deals on gently used clothing at Goodwill, the Salvation Army, 
garage sales, flea markets, and consignment shops.
 
✓ Lose the car, if possible. If you can get by with public transpor-
tation or car-pooling, you can save a lot on auto expenses — 
fuel, maintenance and repairs, and auto insurance.
Pay Yourself an Allowance
Parents often put their kids on allowances to teach them respon-
sibility and to keep the kids from nickel and diming their parents 
into the poor house with constant requests for money. Few adults, 
however, consider the possibility that perhaps they’re nickel and 
diming themselves into the poor house by stopping at the ATM 
every time they need some cash.
This week, go to the ATM only once and pull out a reasonable 
amount of cash (within your budget) to cover your personal 
expenses — haircut, coffee, soft drinks, green fees, whatever. 
When that money’s gone, it’s gone . . . at least until next week when 
you visit the ATM again.

 Chapter 16: Ten Tips for Long-Term Success 231
Haggle Over Every Purchase
In foreign countries, particularly third-world countries where con-
sumers are time rich but cash poor, haggling is a way of life. In the 
U.S., this practice has fallen out of favor, but over the past ten years 
or so, neo-hagglers have begun to popularize this type of negotiation 
again. In bad economic times, haggling becomes even more popular 
because consumers need to get prices down and businesses need to 
make sales.
Granted, this strategy isn’t very realistic when you’re dealing with 
your gas or electric company or shopping at a major grocery chain, 
but it does work for a surprising number of businesses. Here are 
some ideas to get you started:
 
✓ Start haggling with online purchases. It’s easier to negotiate 
when you don’t have to look the other person in the eye.
 
✓ Haggle with your phone company to get the services you want 
for less. (What they charge for text messaging is outrageous!) 
When other offers come your way for services you already 
have (like phone and cable), make your current provider aware 
and use those other offers to try to leverage a better deal or 
even get the same deal that the other company is offering.
 
✓ Negotiate a lower room rate the next time you book a room in 
a hotel or motel. If you’re a member of AAA, AARP, or some 
other such group, ask about discounts.
 
✓ If you get lousy food or service at a restaurant, ask to speak 
with the manager about getting a discount or having the 
entire meal or your next meal comp’ed (that’s restaurant lingo 
for “complimentary”).
 
✓ Look for minor blemishes on clothing or shoes and ask the 
sales clerk to discount the damaged item for you.
 
✓ Ask sales clerks whether you can get a discount for buying 
other items you really need.
 
✓ If the quote for a car repair seems steep, talk to the man-
ager to see if you can get a discount. He may be so afraid of 
losing your business that he’s willing to drop the price. The 
best time to haggle over this price is before the work is done 
because the manager won’t want to lose your business and 
you’ll be able to negotiate from a position of greater strength 
than if he’s already done the work.
 
Save your receipts and watch prices even after you’ve made your 
purchases. Many stores issue price adjustments within 30 days of 
the purchase date to keep you from just returning the item if you 
see it for sale somewhere else or even at the same store.

Part V: The Part of Tens  
232
Moonlight to Earn Extra Income
Unless you have a contract with your employer that prohibits 
moonlighting, you may be able to earn some extra money on the 
side. Auto mechanics, plumbers, electricians, hair stylists, and 
others who have marketable skills have been doing it for years.
 
Don’t moonlight if it compromises your ability to perform your 
day job or violates any agreement you have with your current 
employer. You don’t want to lose a steady paycheck in the process 
of trying to earn some extra cash.
Put Everyone to Work
Short of selling your entire family into indentured servitude on 
eBay, consider asking everyone in the family who’s capable of 
working to at least cover the cost of their personal expenses — 
whatever electronic gadgets and services they feel they need, 
movie tickets, shoes and clothing, cosmetics, snacks, and so forth.
In a real pinch, your partner or your kids can even toss a little money 
your way to cover the household expenses, at least temporarily until 
conditions improve. In many cases, the kids want to help — they 
just don’t know how. By having everyone pitch in and celebrating 
your financial success together, you may even find that your family 
becomes much closer.
Check Your Progress
Budgeting isn’t a one-time deal. You need to set your budget and 
then revisit it at least every month (more frequently when you’re 
getting started) to make sure you’re on track or to get back on 
track. It’s like a diet or trying to quit smoking: Even if you cheat, 
you have to get back on the wagon.
If you’re teaming up with family members, get them all involved in 
the budget review process, so everyone involved knows where the 
money is going and is aware of any problems as soon as they arise. 
You have a much better chance of success when you work together.
 
Don’t forget to celebrate your success. Come up with an afford-
able way to celebrate — maybe a special home-cooked meal and a 
movie rental. It doesn’t have to be expensive to be fun!

Ten Common Loan 
Modification Myths
In This Chapter
▶ Getting over the fear that your bank wants your home
▶ Overcoming the notion that you can’t qualify until you’re in default
▶ Appreciating just how much time you really have
▶ Realizing the benefits of paying for legal representation
L
oan modification offers real help to homeowners who can’t 
afford their monthly payments. For homeowners who qualify, 
lenders are able and often willing to adjust the terms of the loan. In 
some cases, the lender may even reduce the principal balance due 
in order to make the monthly payments more affordable.
Unfortunately, homeowners often mistakenly believe they can’t 
possibly qualify for a loan modification, or some other psychologi-
cal barrier stands between them and the help they need. To over-
come any barriers that may be standing in your way, this chapter 
busts ten common myths about loan modification.
My Bank Wants To Take My Home
Many homeowners believe that as soon as they miss a single payment, 
the bank is standing ready to kick them out of their homes and 
seize their land. The truth is that banks don’t profit from foreclo-
sure, even if the home is worth way more than what you owe the 
bank. Here’s how it works: Suppose the bank sells your home at 
the foreclosure auction for $50,000 more than you owe on it. The 
bank is entitled to receive only what it’s owed, which includes 
the principal, past due interest, and any penalties and fees you 
owe — late-payment fees, attorney fees, and so on. The rest of the 
money goes to any junior lien holders to pay off their claims to the 
property. If any money remains after paying off all the liens, it goes 

Part V: The Part of Tens  
234
to you. Getting your share is usually as easy as asking for it and 
signing a receipt.
 
According to a report from the Joint Economic Committee of 
Congress, an average foreclosure costs the lender $50,000 to 
$60,000 in lost interest, attorney fees, expenses for rehabbing 
the home, commissions for listing and selling it, and sometimes 
having to sell at a loss.
My Credit Score Is Too Low
Many homeowners try to refinance their way out of foreclosure 
by taking out a new loan with a lower interest rate. Unfortunately, 
they often can’t qualify for the new, low-interest loan because their 
credit history has been damaged by several late or missed payments 
or because lenders have tightened their requirements.
As a result, these folks often walk away with the mistaken belief 
that they’re out of luck. If they couldn’t qualify for refinancing, how 
could they possibly qualify for a loan modification?
Unlike the option of refinancing your way out of trouble, which 
requires you to apply for a new loan, loan modification simply 
adjusts the terms and perhaps reduces the balance of a loan you 
already have. Because you’re not applying for a new loan, your 
credit score is much less of a factor in determining whether you 
qualify for a loan modification.
 
A successful loan modification focuses more on affordability than 
on good credit. Obtaining and adhering to the terms of a loan 
modification can actually improve your credit score over time, 
especially if it prevents foreclosure or bankruptcy.
I Can’t Qualify until My 
Loan Is in Default
When lenders and government agencies first identified loan modifi-
cation as a potential cure for the foreclosure epidemic, they slapped 
all sorts of restrictions on it to prevent people who didn’t really 
need a loan modification from qualifying for one. Some early eligi-
bility requirements stated that you had to be 61 days delinquent 
(that’s two full payments behind) in order to qualify.

 Chapter 17: Ten Common Loan Modification Myths 235
The truth is that the eligibility requirements are constantly changing 
and differ among lenders. During the height of the foreclosure epi-
demic, many lenders began negotiating loan modifications with bor-
rowers who were up to date on their payments. Conditions dictated 
that they needed to take a more proactive approach.
 
You can’t determine whether you qualify for a loan modification 
simply by reading about “standard” requirements in this book or 
on the Internet. You really need to discuss your situation with your 
lender or, better yet, with an attorney who’s knowledgeable and 
experienced in loan modifications and who can work with your 
lender to determine whether you qualify.
I’m Better Off Declaring Bankruptcy 
or Walking Away
Unless you have a huge amount of unsecured debt (typically credit 
card debt), bankruptcy is probably not the best option. It’s likely 
to cost more and blemish your credit history without delivering 
any better results than you can expect from a loan modification.
In some cases, declaring bankruptcy is the best option, so we don’t 
want you to rule it out entirely. It’s particularly attractive if you’re 
buried in unsecured debt or if the bank is pursuing a deficiency 
judgment against you. Bankruptcy can erase the deficiency or 
unsecured debt (or a significant portion of it) or can allow you to 
restructure your secured debt (such as your mortgage) depending 
on the bankruptcy chapter. It also can buy you some valuable time.
 
We discuss the bankruptcy option in Foreclosure Self-Defense For 
Dummies (Wiley). For a more detailed presentation, check out 
Personal Bankruptcy Laws For Dummies, 2nd Edition, by James P. 
Caher and John M. Caher (Wiley).
Walking away and abandoning the home is a risky option. If you’re 
lucky, the bank takes your home, sells it at foreclosure, and writes 
off the loss. The only thing you have to deal with is a negative mark 
on your credit history. In some jurisdictions, however, the bank 
may have the legal right to pursue a deficiency judgment, in which 
case you may be obligated to pay the difference between what you 
owed and what the bank realized from the sale of the home. A 
successful loan modification is always a more prudent choice. (For 
more about alternatives to loan modification, refer to Chapter 3.)

Part V: The Part of Tens  
236
I Can Negotiate Myself for Free
This myth has some truth to it. You certainly may be able to nego-
tiate a loan modification with your lender on your own. However, 
an attorney who has experience in the field is more capable than 
most people at negotiating the best deal possible.
Experienced attorneys know what the lenders are willing to nego-
tiate and how far they can be pushed. Attorneys also carry more 
legal weight than consumers. With the threat of a possible lawsuit 
sitting on the negotiating table, the lender is usually more open to 
considering a reasonable deal.
In addition, an attorney is likely to be less emotional and more 
rational in dealing with your lender. If you call and begin to argue 
with the lender’s representative, you may get accidentally discon-
nected or your application may mysteriously disappear. Lenders 
are often more willing to negotiate with calm, cool, and collected 
attorneys.
For more information on making the decision to work with an 
attorney (and how to go about the collaboration) or go it alone, 
turn to Chapter 4.
It’s Too Late to Modify My Loan
When homeowners receive a foreclosure notice, many assume they 
have only two options remaining: pay up or move out. The fact is 
that the foreclosure notice signals only the beginning of the end. 
The lender can stop the foreclosure as easily as it started the 
process — assuming you can convince the lender of your willing-
ness and ability to make reasonable monthly payments.
 
As long as you still reside in the home — that is, you didn’t volun-
tarily abandon it and the sheriff hasn’t shown up to evict you — you 
may still have time to save your home. By contacting the lender 
(prior to the foreclosure sale) or, better yet, having your attorney 
contact the lender on your behalf, you demonstrate a good faith 
effort to work out a solution and can often buy yourself extra time 
to negotiate a loan modification. You may even have time to save 
your home after a foreclosure sale if you live in a state that allows 
redemption; contact your county register of deeds or a local 
consumer-focused foreclosure attorney for more information.

 Chapter 17: Ten Common Loan Modification Myths 237
The Lender Doesn’t 
Have to Negotiate
Lenders often feel compelled to negotiate solutions with borrowers 
for the simple reason that they don’t want the expense of foreclo-
sure, bad loans on their books, or a huge inventory of properties 
they can’t sell. If a lender has too many bad loans, its reputation 
in the industry suffers, and it may have trouble borrowing money 
to make future loans available. A lender/originator with a reputa-
tion for high default ratios can find itself on the secondary market 
blacklist, which prevents it from replenishing the cash reserves 
necessary to originate new loans. From this point, it’s a slow pain-
ful death.
Lenders may also be required to refinance or offer loan modifica-
tions if they participate in government-sponsored home retention 
plans, such as the Making Home Affordable initiative.
In addition, many loans in default contain evidence that the lender 
or someone else involved in originating or approving the loan 
acted inappropriately. In cases such as these, the lender is legally 
obligated to either renegotiate the loan agreement with the bor-
rower or repurchase the loan. A knowledgeable attorney can per-
form a forensic audit that often identifies regulatory violations or 
fraudulent activities that most consumers would never notice on 
their own. (For more about leveraging the law to pressure your 
lender to cooperate, see Part IV.)
Upfront Fees Are a Scam
Almost all consumer advocates warn against paying upfront fees 
for loan modification, credit counseling, and similar services. In 
most situations, this is excellent advice. In fact, some states have 
passed laws barring upfront fees unless certain requirements are 
met. When you’re obtaining legal services from bona fide attor-
neys, however, the rules change.
Attorneys almost always charge upfront fees in the form of retain-
ers. The key is to work with a reputable loan modification company 
that offers legal representation and has a reasonable refund policy 
if it can’t help you.
 
Make sure the company has a mailing address (not just a P.O. box 
number or Web site address) and a phone number, and do some 
checking to make sure the company is legitimate and has 

Part V: The Part of Tens  
238
successfully negotiated loan modifications for its clients. For more 
about choosing reputable experts to help you with your situation, 
see Chapter 4.
I’ll Lose My Home If I Don’t 
Qualify for a Loan Modification
Not everyone qualifies for a loan modification, but other options 
and exit strategies are available. In fact, most homeowners have 
about a dozen options they can pursue to either keep their homes 
or get out from under them gracefully. Options include placing the 
home on the market, refinancing, borrowing money from a friend 
or relative to reinstate the loan, and working out a payment plan 
with the bank to catch up on deficiencies, to name a few.
If you live in a jurisdiction that offers a redemption period, you 
even have the option of buying back the property from whoever 
happens to purchase it at the auction. An attorney can help you 
analyze the various options and offer guidance on which one is 
best for your situation. For more about alternatives to loan modifi-
cation, refer to Chapter 3.
I Can Modify Only the Loan 
on My Primary Residence
Loan modification is designed for homeowners, not investors, so 
you have a better chance of qualifying for a modification of a mort-
gage on a primary or secondary residence — that is, for a home 
you actually live in — than an investment property. However, 
when the mortgage lending industry is in dire straits it can’t afford 
to have any loans go into default, and so lenders become more will-
ing to work with investors.
 
If you hold mortgages on more than one home, you may not be 
fully aware of the options you have until you do your research. 
The mortgage lending landscape is constantly changing, and only 
by consulting with someone knowledgeable in the field of loan 
modifications can you truly become educated enough to make the 
best decision. A good call to make (or have made for you) is to the 
lender/servicer. Ask if it modifies loans on secondary or invest-
ment properties; if the answer is “yes,” follow the steps to find out 
what you need to do to qualify.

Part VI
Appendixes

In this part . . .
T
acked on to the end of this book are two valuable 
appendixes (or appendices, depending on which 
side of the tracks you live on). The fi rst is a collection of 
additional resources that can come in quite handy. It 
includes Web site and contact information for the major 
lenders, a list of federal agencies and consumer advocacy 
groups you can contact for assistance, and contact 
information for the attorney general in each of the 50 
states (plus the District of Columbia and U.S. territories).
The second appendix is a glossary of typically unfamiliar 
terminology and acronyms we use throughout the book, 
such as loan-to-value (LTV) ratio, debt-to-income (DTI) 
ratio, and deﬁ ciency judgment. With this glossary in hand, 
you not only have a better understanding of what the 
experts are telling you, but you can also confi dently weave 
these terms into your next dinner conversation. (It’s a 
good idea to become familiar with these terms so you 
don’t have to look them up while on the phone with your 
lender, but you can still use this glossary as a crutch, just 
in case.)

Appendix A
Resources
T
he mortgage meltdown and foreclosure epidemic are national 
crises that have generated a huge amount of negative press, 
but every cloud does have a silver lining. In this case, the silver 
lining is in the form of unprecedented assistance for homeowners 
facing foreclosure and lenders who stand to lose big time from the 
rash of defaults on mortgage loans.
In this appendix, we highlight various resources, both online and 
off, where you can go for information and assistance for saving 
your home from foreclosure. We cover everything from major 
lenders to government agencies, including your state attorney 
general, and consumer advocacy groups to private organizations.
Major Lender Web Sites and 
Customer Service Numbers
If you have a mortgage in the United States, chances are pretty 
good that your mortgage is with one of the top ten mortgage 
lending institutions. They appear in the following list along with 
more than 50 other mortgage lending institutions. We provide both 
customer service phone numbers and Web site addresses so you 
can use whatever method of contact you’re most comfortable with.
 
Some of the information provided in this list may have changed 
between the time this book was published and the time you’re 
reading it due to acquisitions, mergers, or some lenders simply 
going out of business. In addition, although we attempted to 
locate phone numbers that connect directly to each lender’s loss 
mitigation or loan modification department, some of the numbers 
may connect you to the lender’s switchboard operator or loan 
origination department; you’ll need to work your way past the 
gatekeepers to the right person, as explained in Chapter 5.

Consumer Support and 
Federal Agencies
Although the United States government has been criticized for 
doing too little too late for homeowners, the fact is that several 
consumer groups and federal agencies are in place to help 
homeowners, but you need to take the initiative and contact them. 
In the following sections, we list consumer groups and federal 
agencies that can assist you in pursuing a loan modification, some 
other foreclosure solution, or a claim against a lender or someone 
else involved in originating your loan who may have committed 
fraud.
Start with your lender or one of the consumer groups listed here. 
If that doesn’t work to your satisfaction, one or more federal 
agencies may be able to crank up the heat enough to convince 
your lender to work with you.
Consumer support
Several consumer groups have staff and volunteers on hand who 
can offer assistance in sizing up your situation, contacting your 
lender, and getting your financial house in order. Here, we provide 
a list of the top resources to reach out to:
 
✓ Don’t Borrow Trouble: This is Freddie Mac’s anti-predatory 
lending initiative dedicated to helping consumers identify the 
common signs of predatory lending and avoid taking out loans 
designed to fleece consumers. Before you take out a loan to 
finance your way out of your current situation, visit this site 
to learn how to protect yourself.
 
• Phone: (888) 995-HOPE (995-4673)
 
• Web site: www.dontborrowtrouble.com
 
✓ Home Loan Learning Center: The Mortgage Bankers 
Association created and maintains the Home Loan Learning 
Center to provide consumers with step-by-step information 
on how to become financially literate. The Web site includes 
a Foreclosure Prevention Resource Center that can bring you 
up to speed on the foreclosure process and your options.
 
• Phone: (800) 348-8653
 
• Web site: www.homeloanlearningcenter.com
 
✓ Homeownership Preservation Foundation: This organization 
is dedicated to developing innovative solutions for preserving 
and expanding homeownership by partnering with consumers, 

Part VI: Appendixes  
246
policymakers, and the mortgage lending industry. The 
Homeownership Preservation Foundation spearheaded the 
HOPE NOW alliance.
 
• Phone: (888) 995-HOPE (995-4673)
 
• Web site: www.995hope.org
 
✓ HOPE NOW: This alliance between HUD-approved counseling 
agents, servicers, investors, and other mortgage market 
participants provides free foreclosure prevention assistance. 
The HOPE hotline is staffed by HUD-approved credit counselors 
who can help you sort out your financial situation and explore 
your options. Hope Now also maintains a list of lenders on 
its Web site. Because lenders and servicers are constantly 
changing as companies fail and mega-lenders gobble up the 
little guys, a quick check at the HOPE NOW site may give you 
the contact information you need if the information provided 
earlier in this appendix becomes outdated.
 
• Phone: (888) 995-HOPE (995-4673)
 
• Web site: www.hopenow.com
 
✓ Making Home Affordable (MHA): This is the federal 
government’s primary home retention plan, commonly 
referred to as the Obama Plan. It offers qualifying homeowners 
two options: refinancing for homeowners who pay their 
mortgages on time but are unable to refinance to take advantage 
of a lower interest rate; and loan modification for homeowners 
who are struggling to make their monthly house payments. 
Visit the plan’s Web site for details and to determine whether 
you’re likely to qualify.
 
• Web site: makinghomeaffordable.gov
 
✓ MyMoneyManagement.net: This collaborative effort by the 
financial services industry aims to provide consumers with 
access to financial education and tools to help inform their 
personal finance decision process. The Web site is sponsored 
by the Council on Consumer Finance, a working group of the 
Financial Services Roundtable.
 
• Web site: www.mymoneymanagement.net
 
✓ The National Foundation for Credit Counseling (NFCC): 
Founded in 1951, the NFCC is the nation’s largest and longest-
serving national nonprofit credit counseling organization. The 
NFCC’s mission is to promote the national agenda for financially 
responsible behavior and help its members deliver the highest 
quality financial education and counseling services. NFCC 
members annually help more than two million consumers 
through nearly 1,000 community-based offices nationwide.

✓ NeighborWorks America: Congress formed this national 
nonprofit organization to “create opportunities for people to 
live in affordable homes, improve their lives, and strengthen 
their communities.” This is a great place for foreclosure 
prevention professionals and community organizations to 
obtain information about how to help distressed homeowners 
in their communities. Consumers may also find some useful 
links on the Web site for finding help in their communities.

Federal agencies
Federal agencies are unlikely to provide you with the personal 
attention you need to resolve your issue, but they may be able 
to get the attention of your lender and help move your case to 
the front of the line. In addition, the more complaints an agency 
receives, the more likely it is to launch a full investigation, which 
could be a good thing for other homeowners who are facing issues 
similar to yours.
 
✓ Fannie Mae: This government-sponsored enterprise (GSE) 
is chartered by Congress with a mission to provide liquidity 
and stability to the U.S. housing and mortgage markets. At the 
Fannie Mae Web site, you can find out more about programs 
designed to help distressed homeowners avoid foreclosure, 
including foreclosure prevention workshops. This site also 
provides links to other online resources and organizations 
that can help.
 
• Phone: (800) 732-6643
 
• Web site: www.fanniemae.com
 
✓ Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI): The FBI investigates 
suspected federal crimes, including real estate and mortgage 
fraud. If you suspect someone of committing real estate or 
mortgage fraud against you or someone you know, contact 
the FBI to report the incident.
 
• Phone: Refer to Web site or phone book for local 
number
 
• Web site: www.fbi.gov

✓ Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC): The FDIC 
is “an independent agency created by the Congress that 
maintains the stability and public confidence in the nation’s 
financial system by insuring deposits, examining and super-
vising financial institutions, and managing receiverships.” Its 
Consumer Response Center handles complaints about state 
banks that aren’t members of the Federal Reserve System. 
Filing a complaint online is best. Go to the FDIC Web site, 
click the Consumer Protection tab, and then click Consumer 
Assistance Online Form to get started.
 
• Phone: (800) 378-9581 or (800) 925-4818
 
• Web site: www.fdic.gov
 
✓ Federal Housing Administration (FHA): Part of HUD, the FHA 
is the largest government insurer of mortgages in the world, 
insuring over 35 million mortgages since its inception in 1934. 
Like HUD, the FHA is a great place to go to find out about the 
latest programs available to help homeowners. The FHA Web 
site also provides a Lender Locator and mortgage calculator.
 
• Phone: (800) CALL-FHA (225-5342)
 
• Web site: www.fha.gov
 
✓ Federal Reserve Board: This regulatory agency primarily 
oversees state-chartered banks but also investigates complaints 
related to federal consumer protection laws, such as the 
Equal Credit Opportunity Act, Fair Credit Reporting Act, and 
the Truth in Lending Act. The best way to file a complaint 
with the Federal Reserve Board is to file online. The Web site 
also provides information about what the Federal Reserve 
Board will and won’t do, what you can expect after filing a 
complaint, and additional contact information.
 
• Web site: www.federalreserveconsumerhelp.gov
 
✓ Federal Trade Commission (FTC): The FTC is “the nation’s 
consumer protection agency.” It collects complaints about 
companies, business practices, and identity theft, and it 
detects patterns of wrongdoing that lead to investigations 
and prosecutions. The FTC is responsible for enforcing 
financial privacy statutes, including the Fair Credit Reporting 
Act (FCRA); laws targeting deceptive, unfair, and abusive 
practices in the subprime market; and many of the nation’s 
other consumer-credit statutes, including the Truth in 
Lending Act.
 
 The FTC Web site also contains a link to the Military Sentinel 
for information on consumer protection issues that affect 
members of the U.S. Armed Forces and their families and a 
link for filing a complaint about a business that’s located in a 

 Appendix A: Resources 249
foreign country. The FTC doesn’t resolve individual consumer 
disputes; rather, it gathers information, enters it into a 
database, and then investigates and prosecutes violators 
whom it suspects of violating a law.
 
• Phone: (877) FTC-HELP (382-4357)
 
• Web site: www.ftccomplaintassistant.gov
 
✓ Freddie Mac: Like Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac is a government-
sponsored enterprise (GSE) chartered by Congress with a 
mission to provide liquidity and stability to the U.S. housing 
and mortgage markets. Freddie Mac, along with Fannie Mae, 
the Federal Housing Finance Agency, and the Hope Now 
Alliance, has launched a streamlined loan modification 
program for distressed homeowners. You can learn more 
about this and other programs at Freddie Mac’s Web site.
 
• Phone: Refer to Web site or phone book for local 
number
 
• Web site: www.freddiemac.com
 
✓ National Credit Union Association (NCUA): Although credit 
unions aren’t immune to the mortgage lending problems that 
many of the mega-lending institutions have experienced, 
they’re less likely to be involved in a mortgage lending 
dispute. However, if you have a dispute with a credit union 
that you’ve tried and failed to resolve, the National Credit 
Union Association may be able to help.
 
• Phone: (800) 755-1030
 
• Web site: www.ncua.gov
 
✓ Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC): If a 
bank holds your mortgage; has “National,” “N.A.” (National 
Association), or “NT&SA” (National Trust & Savings 
Association) in its name; and can’t resolve your dispute to 
your satisfaction, call on the Office of the Comptroller of 
the Currency (OCC) for assistance. Its Consumer Assistance 
Group (CAG) specializes in consumer complaints. The OCC 
Web site also provides additional information and a search-
able directory of national banks so you can confirm that your 
bank is a national bank before filing your complaint.
 
• Phone: (800) 613-6743
 
• Web site: www.occ.treas.gov, www.helpwith
mybank.gov
 
✓ Office of Thrift Supervision: This government office oversees 
the operation of savings associations insured by the federal 
Savings Association Insurance Fund (SAIF) as well as Federal 

Part VI: Appendixes  
250
Savings Banks (FSBs). As such, it’s dedicated to ensuring that 
thrift institutions comply with consumer protection laws and 
regulations.
 
 If you tried and failed to resolve your dispute with your lender, 
you can file a complaint with the OTS. Visit its Web site and click 
the Active OTS Institution Directory link to find out whether your 
lender is regulated by the OTS before filing your complaint. If 
your lender is on the list, under Information for Consumers, click 
File a Complaint. During the writing of this book, the OTS has 
no online form and doesn’t recommend sending sensitive 
information via e-mail. However, the File a Complaint page 
provides a link to download a printable complaint form along 
with additional information on how to resolve disputes.
 
• Phone: (800) 842-6929 or (800) 877-8339
 
• Web site: www.ots.treas.gov
 
✓ Security and Exchange Commission (SEC): The SEC is 
dedicated to protecting investors; maintaining fair, orderly, 
and efficient markets; and facilitating capital formation. As 
such, it does very little to directly help distressed home-
owners, but you can file a complaint with the SEC if you think 
that a lender violated an SEC regulation in dealing with your 
loan.
 
 The SEC is becoming more involved in consumer affairs 
as the mortgage meltdown turns its attention to mortgage-
backed securities (MBSs) as the root of the problem. Multiple 
class-action lawsuits are likely to arise involving failure to 
adequately disclose the risk involved with the MBS pools of 
loans.
 
 If you feel you were set up with a loan you really couldn’t 
afford and you find out that your mortgage is owned by 
investors, help from the SEC is worth looking into. The SEC 
investigates issues of fraud in mortgages that were securitized.
 
• Phone: (888) 732-6585
 
• Web site: www.sec.gov
 
✓ U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD): 
This is the federal agency of choice for solutions that enable 
you to avoid foreclosure and keep your home. You can find 
out about the latest programs available as well as access con-
tact information for local HUD offices. In the mortgage arena, 
HUD plays a key role in enforcing Real Estate Settlement 
Procedures Act (RESPA) statutes. On the Web site under 
Homes, click the Foreclosure link.
 
• Phone: (202) 708-1112
 
• Web site: www.hud.gov

 Appendix A: Resources 251
 
 If you think someone involved in the origination or processing 
of your loan application violated a RESPA statute (see Chapter 
13), you can file a complaint with the HUD director in charge 
of RESPA and Interstate Land Sales. Unfortunately, at the time 
of writing this book, HUD doesn’t provide an online complaint 
form, so you have to send your complaint via snail mail:
 
 Director, Office of RESPA and Interstate Land Sales
U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development
Room 9154
451 7th Street, SW
Washington, DC 20410
 
 Identify the suspected violation(s) and the alleged violators 
by name, address, and phone number. You should also provide 
your own name and phone number for follow-up questions 
from HUD. If you prefer not to have your identity shared with 
the accused party, be sure to specify that in your letter.
 
✓ U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs (VA): This department 
is dedicated to providing excellence in patient care, benefits, 
and customer satisfaction to veterans of the armed forces. 
If you’re a veteran, you may have even more resources for 
saving your home from foreclosure than nonveterans, so 
contact the VA to find out what’s available.

• Web site: www.homeloans.va.gov
State Attorneys General
Your state attorney general can’t save you from foreclosure, but 
if you believe that you’re a victim of fraud, your attorney general 
is one of the first people you should contact. Whether the fraud 
was perpetrated prior to your current troubles (for example, by a 
predatory lender) or after (by a con artist pretending to help you), 
your attorney general wants to know about it.
The following list contains the Web site addresses and phone 
numbers for the attorneys general in each of the 50 states, the 
District of Columbia, and U.S. territories. (You can pull up an 
updated list of state attorneys general, complete with names, 
addresses, and phone numbers, at the National Association of 
Attorneys General Web site at www.naag.org.)
 
Ask your state attorney general for information on other state 
agencies or licensing boards that may monitor and regulate lend-
ers in your state. All states have designated consumer protection 
divisions in their AG offices and forms to download off the states’ 
official Web sites.

Appendix B
Glossary
adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM): A home loan whose interest rate 
can rise and fall. ARMs may contribute to triggering “rate shock” 
and default when the interest rate jumps, making the monthly 
payments less affordable.
automatic stay: A freeze imposed on lenders as soon as you file for 
bankruptcy that prevents lenders from moving forward on debt 
collection activities. Lenders can ask the bankruptcy court to lift 
the stay.
back-end ratio: Your debt ratio for your house and all other loans 
(such as a car loan). According to the Federal Housing Authority 
(FHA), your back-end debt payments shouldn’t exceed 41 percent 
of your gross monthly income. See also debt-to-income (DTI) ratio 
and front-end ratio.
bankruptcy: A legal process allowing the debtor to discharge 
certain debts or personal obligations. The two most common 
forms of bankruptcy for homeowners are Chapter 7 and Chapter 
13. See also Chapter 7 bankruptcy and Chapter 13 bankruptcy.
broker’s price opinion (BPO): See comparative market 
analysis (CMA).
Chapter 7 bankruptcy: Liquidation of all nonexempt assets to 
repay as much debt as possible and discharge all remaining debt. 
See also bankruptcy.
Chapter 13 bankruptcy: Reorganization of finances to pay off all or 
some debts over time. See also bankruptcy.
comparative market analysis (CMA): An estimate of a property’s 
anticipated sales price based on recent sales prices of similar 
properties. Also referred to as a home valuation or broker’s price 
opinion (BPO). CMA values are for arm’s length transactions and 
aren’t calculated based on fire-sale pricing.
debt payment: The monthly amount required on a mortgage, loan, 
or credit card account.

Part VI: Appendixes  
256
debt-to-income (DTI) ratio: The mathematical relationship 
between how much you pay out in monthly bills and your gross 
monthly income. Banks use your DTI to determine your credit 
worthiness and often examine both front-end ratio and back-end 
ratio. Also referred to as a debt ratio. See also front-end ratio and 
back-end ratio.
deed: A legal document that identifies an official ownership interest in 
real property, such as a home and the land on which it sits. Several 
types of deeds exist. See also quit-claim deed, sheriff’s deed, and 
warranty deed.
deed in lieu of foreclosure (DIL): An arrangement in which the 
lender agrees not to foreclose in exchange for the deed to your 
home. If you offer a DIL, make sure you also receive a document 
stating, “This deed given in satisfaction of a mortgage dated [XX].” 
This protects you from the lender pursuing a deficiency judgment 
against you. See also deficiency judgment.
default: The failure to honor an agreement. In foreclosure, the 
most common default is failure to make monthly payments on the 
agreed-upon dates.
deferred payment: Any payment the lender has agreed to postpone 
as part of the workout.
deficiency judgment: A court document stating that a borrower 
owes and must pay the balance that remains on a loan after the 
foreclosure sale. The judgment gives the bank or lender the right 
to take additional legal process to collect on the deficiency if the 
borrower refuses to pay.
discounted payoff: A reduction in the unpaid principal balance 
(UPB) that the lender agrees to accept as payment in full for the 
loan.
durable power of attorney: Assigns the grantee power to make 
decisions and take action on the grantor’s behalf. The grantee can 
execute deeds, mortgages, bills of sale, and so on. The grantee 
holds this power and will continue to hold it even in the event that 
the grantor becomes incapacitated (that’s the “durable” part). See 
also power of attorney (POA).
equity: The amount of cash you have in your house. If you sold the 
house today and paid off all liens against it, equity is the money 
left to stuff in your pockets or purse.

 Appendix B: Glossary 257
escrow: A separate account into which a portion of each monthly 
payment is deposited to cover annual property taxes and assess-
ments, insurance, and (in some cases) homeowner association 
(HOA) fees.
exempt assets: Stuff you own that can’t be taken and sold to repay

borrower time to regroup. The borrower may be required to make 
a reduced payment during this time or no payment at all.
foreclosure: The legal process by which a creditor can enforce the 
terms of the mortgage or deed of trust to recover all or a portion 
of the money loaned and secured by the property. Money is 
recovered by selling the property at a public auction.
front-end ratio: Your debt ratio for only your home. According to 
the Making Home Affordable program, the monthly payment on

negotiations with your lender if you need this assistance.
index: A starting point from which the interest rate on an adjustable-
rate mortgage (ARM) is calculated. More than 80 percent of all 
ARMs use the CMT, COFI, and LIBOR indexes.
junior lien: A legal encumbrance on a home’s title that’s subordinate 
to the senior lien. A junior lien could be a second mortgage, a 
home equity loan or line of credit, or a loan taken out against 
the home for improvements. See also home equity line of credit, 
home equity loan, senior lien, and tax lien.
lease-option agreement: A rent-to-own agreement between a seller 
and a buyer. The buyer typically agrees to make a down payment 
on the property and pay rent for a specified number of months, 
after which time the buyer has the right (the option), but not the 
obligation, to purchase the property.
limited (or specific) power of attorney: Typically restricts a 
person’s power to a specific transaction. This allows the grantee 
to handle the transaction as if the grantor were doing it herself, 
but it doesn’t give the grantee the power to do anything else 
except what’s specifically listed. See also power of attorney (POA).
loan modification: An alteration of a mortgage agreement typically 
to make the monthly payments more affordable. A lender can 
modify the mortgage in any number of ways, including adding time 
to the end of the mortgage or reducing the interest rate. See also 
mortgage.

loan-to-value (LTV) ratio: The mathematical relationship between 
how much you owe or will owe on your home and its appraised 
value. If you owe $80,000 on a home that appraises for $100,000, it 
has an LTV ratio of 80 percent.
loss mitigation: Any effort by the lender to limit the financial loss 
resulting from a nonperforming asset because of the borrower’s 
failure to make payments on a loan.
margin: A fixed percentage added to an index on an adjustable-rate 
mortgage (ARM). The margin and index combined determine the 
interest rate.
means test: A provision in the bankruptcy code that determines 
whether you qualify for Chapter 7 bankruptcy or must file for 
Chapter 13 bankruptcy. If your income falls below a certain level, 
you may qualify for Chapter 7 bankruptcy. The means test is 
intended as a way to curb Chapter 7 bankruptcy abuse. See also 
bankruptcy, Chapter 7 bankruptcy, and Chapter 13 bankruptcy.
mortgage: A security instrument that pledges real property as 
security (or collateral) for a loan. The note (promissory note) is 
your promise to pay. See also mortgagee and mortgagor.
mortgage satisfaction (discharge): A document filed with the 
register of deeds stating that the mortgage on a property has been 
paid in full (or settled in some other manner) and released as a 
lien.
mortgage-backed security (MBS): A bond or other investment 
instrument secured by a pool of mortgages. MBSs are sold to 
investors on Wall Street to provide banks with funds for additional 
mortgage loans.
mortgagee: The lender in a lender-borrower agreement. See also 
mortgage and mortgagor.
mortgagor: The borrower in a lender-borrower agreement. See 
also mortgage and mortgagee.
net worth: The amount of money that would remain if you were to 
sell all your stuff and pay all your debts. In other words, what you 
own minus what you owe.
note (promissory note): A written promise to pay, like an IOU. 
When you take out a loan to finance the purchase of property, you 
usually sign a mortgage and a note. See also mortgage.

Part VI: Appendixes  
260
notice of default: A written announcement that a borrower has 
failed to honor the terms of payment stated in the mortgage. In 
most states, delivering or recording the notice of default is the first 
step in the foreclosure process.
power of attorney (POA): A legal document that gives someone 
else the right to make decisions, sign legal documents, or act on 
your behalf. POAs can be limited or durable (remaining in effect if 
the principal party becomes incapacitated). See also limited (or 
specific) power of attorney and durable power of attorney.
principal forbearance: An agreement between a borrower and a 
lender to defer a portion of the unpaid principal balance until the 
home is sold or the loan is refinanced. Payments are recalculated 
on the unpaid principal balance minus the deferred amount, 
resulting in a lower house payment.
pro se: Acting as your own attorney.
quit-claim deed: A deed that makes no warranties or guarantees 
but conveys to the grantee ownership interest the grantor has in 
the property (if any). See also deed.
reaffirm debt: To re-obligate yourself to a debt that was discharged 
in bankruptcy. A homeowner may reaffirm a mortgage debt in 
bankruptcy to keep the home by bringing it out of bankruptcy in 
order to work out a repayment plan with, or resume payments to, 
the lender.
Real Estate Settlement and Procedures Act (RESPA): A federal 
consumer-protection statute requiring lenders to fully disclose 
closing costs and prohibiting practices that artificially increase 
closing costs.
recidivism: Fancy word for “relapse”; instance in which a homeowner 
negotiates a solution with the lenders and then defaults again later.
redemption: The process of buying back a property after a 
foreclosure auction. Some states have a redemption period in 
which a homeowner has the right, but not the obligation, to buy 
back a property plus interest from the lender or investor who 
entered the winning bid.
register of deeds: The county office that records legal documents 
related to the transfer of real property. Your county’s register of 
deeds should be a great resource for foreclosure information and 
ideas of where to look for additional assistance. It may be called 
something different in your county, such as the deeds office, the 
recorder’s office, or the county clerk’s office.

 Appendix B: Glossary 261
reinstatement: Curing the default of a mortgage by catching up on 
past payments and paying any fees (including legal) or penalties 
that resulted from the default prior to the foreclosure sale.
repayment plan: An agreement with your lender that cures the 
default and addresses missed payments through an installment 
plan. In most cases, you’re required to make your normal monthly 
payment plus a portion of any past-due payments and penalties 
that have accrued as a result of the default.
reset: An agreement in some mortgages that allows the initial 
interest rate to change at some time in the future, usually two to 
three years into the mortgage term. If the initial rate was set very 
low (as in a teaser rate), the reset rate can jump dramatically. 
Dramatic rate increases can result in “rate shock” and affordability 
issues.
secured loan: A loan that has some sort of collateral attached to it 
that the lender can take and sell if you don’t repay the debt. Home 
mortgages and car loans are two examples of secured loans. See 
also unsecured loan.
securitization: A process of bundling loans into pools and 
then selling certificates or securities (like stocks or bonds) to 
investors based on those loan pools. See also mortgage-backed 
security (MBS).
senior lien: A legal claim to a home that takes precedence over all 
other liens, except a tax lien. See also junior lien and tax lien.
Servicemember’s Civil Relief Act: An act passed by Congress 
to afford certain financial protection and legal protections for 
individuals serving in the military.
servicer: A company that works on behalf of your lender, for a fee, 
to collect and process your monthly mortgage payments.
sheriff’s deed: Issued by the sheriff’s office to the purchaser of a 
property at a foreclosure sale, indicating that the purchaser is the 
new owner of the property subject to certain conditions, such as a 
redemption period, where applicable. See also deed and redemption.
sheriff’s sale: A public foreclosure auction typically conducted by 
the county sheriff. See also foreclosure.
short re-fi: A refinance loan allowing the homeowner to remain as 
owner but which is based on a discounted principal that allows 
a homeowner to refinance when the property is worth less than 
what’s owed on it. See also short sale.

Part VI: Appendixes  
262
short sale: An arrangement between a lender and borrower in 
which the lender agrees to accept, as full payment, less than the 
total amount due but which doesn’t allow the homeowner to retain 
ownership. By negotiating a short sale, a homeowner may be able 
to sell the home without having to take a loss on it. Rarely does 
a lender agree to a short sale if it means that the distressed 
homeowner profits from the sale.
tax lien: A claim against the property to ensure payment of property 
taxes. Tax liens or tax deeds can be sold at auction, providing the 
winning bidder with the rights to the property (in the case of a tax 
deed) or the right to foreclose on the property (in the case of a 
tax lien). Tax liens are priority liens even if their position on title 
suggests that they’re in a junior position. See also junior lien and 
senior lien.
term: The duration of a loan. For example, a 30-year mortgage has 
a term of 30 years.
Truth in Lending Act (TILA): Federal regulation requiring lenders 
to fully and clearly disclose the terms and costs related to a loan 
and giving consumers the right to cancel certain types of loans 
within a set period. TILA has given rise to the annual percentage 
rate (APR), which helps consumers compare the actual costs of 
different loans.
unpaid principal balance (UPB): The amount of money you still 
owe on a loan after having paid back a portion of it.
unsecured loan: A loan that’s not backed up by collateral. Credit 
card debt and medical expenses are usually considered unsecured 
loans. See also secured loan.
U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA): A department of the 
federal government dedicated to serving military veterans. As one 
of its benefits, the VA secures low-cost financing at competitive 
interest rates for veterans to purchase homes.
warranty deed: A document that transfers legal ownership and 
contains warranties of title and other legal interests from the 
grantor to the grantee. In contrast, quit-claim deeds contain no 
such warranties. See also quit-claim deed.
