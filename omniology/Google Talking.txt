How Did We Get Here?
We live in a grand age in which information ﬂows at the speed of light and
regional boundaries collapse under the weight of the Internet. Once upon a
time, our parents were penpals to others living in foreign nations, scratching
out long messages on paper to be mailed off. Weeks would pass without
notice or conﬁrmation, until suddenly a heavily stamped envelope would
arrive from a friend overseas. Now we enjoy instantaneous communication to
nearly every country in the world.The world of penpals and business has
become one of instant global communication. But the struggle to get to this
point has been long and ﬁlled with peril. We are at a stage where the world
of communications is being turned upside down, and many users and busi-
nesses are forced to make a choice: to adopt new technology or to conﬁne
themselves to the relics of ancient devices.
Personally, I have been lucky to follow the advent of the instant-messaging
world from the beginning. It all started with the days of bulletin board sys-
tems (BBSs) running Renegade and PCBoard, which had very basic chat
components to allow you to “talk” with the handful of others who could be
on the same BBS at the same time. It was the introduction of FidoNet, an
old-school mail-relaying system, that whetted my appetite for international
communication. I quickly established my own bulletin board as a FidoNet
node, allowing myself and my users to send messages to the vast reaches of
the world.The fall of the BBS world led to my time in Internet Relay Chat
(IRC), which after 12 years I’m still in the habit of visiting. Back when the
BBSs crumbled, the world wasn’t ready for instant messaging. Everyone was
accustomed to their chat rooms on AOL, IRC, CompuServe, and Prodigy,
where they could join a channel of other random “thirty-somethings” and
discuss the latest Seinfeld episode.
When ICQ, the ﬁrst IM service, hit the market in 1996, there was a gen-
eral feeling of “Why would anyone want this?”The chat rooms were more
than proﬁcient at allowing us to talk to our friends, and there seemed little to
be gained from an IM client. Still, many of us quickly signed up for accounts
to play with the new idea. Over time, IM began to play a more central part in
my life and in the lives of others around me. When I wanted to hop online
for a few minutes to check my e-mail, minutes turned into hours as my
friends could immediately see that I had logged in and initiate chats.The

world of chat rooms felt too conﬁning at this point; it was too much protocol
to join a server, ﬁnd a chat room, see who was awake and around, and get
caught up in channel politics just to talk to a friend. Instant messaging
allowed me to quickly “ping” a friend and share information.
As AOL released its Instant Messenger application (AIM), followed by
Yahoo! and Microsoft Messenger, I registered on each to explore the new fea-
tures and worlds opened to me. I can at least say that I’m happy not to have
any screen names that end with a number.After using just about every client
for long periods of time, I remained comfortable with ICQ and AIM.That
was until August 2005, when Google Talk was released.After a rocky start, I
began using Google Talk exclusively as my chat client. It provided all the
main features that I wanted, without all the ﬂuff that the other clients offered.
The Rise of Google
Google Inc. has recently joined the instant-messaging foray with the release of
Google Talk. Everyone seems to know Google. Well known for creating the
most advanced search engine of its time, Google has become synonymous
with information gathering and research—so much so that in the summer of
2006, Merriam-Webster and the Oxford English Dictionary included the
word Google as a verb meaning to search for information on a person using
the Google search engine. Google’s search engine and its related advertising
services have turned Google Inc. into an overnight success, with over 10,000
employees scattered throughout central California and even in Microsoft’s
backyard of Redmond, Washington.
The Google machine has been working overtime in recent years, pro-
ducing a large number of free applications to help the common computer
user and to change people’s perspective of Internet technology.The most well
known of these is Google Mail, a free Web-based mail service provided by
Google. Known affectionately as Gmail, it launched on April 1, 2004, with the
promise of 1 Gigabyte of information storage to any invited member.The
invite-only structure still exists, as Gmail is still technically in the Beta stage,
but with an abundance of invitations granted to each user and numerous invi-
tations ending up on eBay for sale, just about any user who wants an account
is allowed one.As of early 2006, Gmail served 6.7 million users, vastly fewer
than its competitors, but for a new service it is gaining ground. Not only does

Google store the accounts for millions of users, but it also maintains an invis-
ible social network, tying various accounts together. Google knows who
invited you to join their Google Mail service, as well as whom your friends
are in Google Talk, creating an interesting network of your friends and family.
Other Google services, such as Orkut (www.orkut.com), make this social net-
work visible by allowing you to invite new friends to join your social circle.
Google has also started work on its line of Web-based ofﬁce applications.
It currently offers the ability to create and store documents and spreadsheets
(http://docs.google.com), maintain your calendar schedules (www.google.
com/calendar/), and store your favorite photos (http://picasaweb.google.
com). We’ll take a look at many of these applications and see how Google
Talk plays a vital role in then.
Notes From the Underground…
Google Beta?
Anyone who follows Google’s products will notice that a large majority of
them are in Beta, a term describing the overall status of the software as
not quite complete but good enough for mass testing. You might be
familiar with the term Beta test, whereby a product is considered com-
plete enough to warrant scrutiny and stress testing. Well, Google Talk is a
Beta product, under Beta testing by millions of users. It joins the large
Google family of Beta products, such as Google Mail. What this ultimately
means is that the product has not been ﬁnalized into a releasable product
and could undergo changes at any time.
It is important to note that this book covers the Beta version of
Google Talk. That means that new features might be implemented by the
time you’ve installed it, and other features might be altered and removed.
The Instant-Messaging World
Chances are that you are already using an instant-messaging client of some
sort, and would like to know what Google Talk can offer you. Google Talk
provides quite a few unique features, but what it is really known for is what it
does not offer you: advertisements, spyware, information overload, and other

useless junk that other IM clients are known for. In this section, we’ll take a
brief look at Google’s competition in the IM market.
America Online Instant Messenger
Currently,AOL Instant Messenger (AIM) is the most popular instant-mes-
saging service in use in the United States. Precise numbers are hard to deter-
mine, but comScore judged that AIM has 54 million users as of July 2005,
giving it a signiﬁcant market presence.AIM is the big name in the IM world,
there is no doubt about that.Although not the ﬁrst IM service,AIM has the
largest number of users with its existing America Online user base and the
millions of others who registered just to use its chat client.
AIM gave users the ability to log into any computer across the world that
had the AIM client and immediately receive their full contact lists, showing
which of their buddies were online at the time. It was the perfect product for
the busy traveler and student, who might use hundreds of machines during
the course of a year. Chat was effortless, as was the transfer of ﬁles from one
machine to another.
However, over time, a disease crept into AOL Instant Messenger. A disease
called creeping featuritis, which often proves fatal.
Notes From the Underground
Hide Your Daughters, It’s Creeping Featuritis!
Creeping featuritis occurred when an application loses “its roots” and
begins to throw in as many new features as they can possibly ﬁt, even if
it proves detrimental to the original concept of the tool.  I wish I could say
that AIM was the sole sufferer of this wasting sickness, but it proved to
take hold of most IM services.  As a prior software developer, I know the
temptation of it all too well.  I remember thinking, “I’ll just add one more
feature that the users will love and everyone will adore me”  But, the
implementation of that one feature leads to two more, then three more,
and soon your old ideas are becoming ugly and bug ridden while you
focus on the next new idea.

The unfortunate side effect is that more focus and development goes
into the creation of new ideas and add-ons, instead of making the already
existing features pristine and bullet-proof.  Typical features creeps in IM
clients include themes, enhanced smiley faces, games, greeting cards and
avatars.
AOL Instant Messenger was also used as a vehicle to push advertisements
and other AOL features to users who really couldn’t care less, as shown in
Figure 1.1.AOL also touts its AIM Today portal to all users, insisting that they
really do want a one-stop shop for all their e-mail and personal settings as
well as all the latest celebrity gossip.

ICQ
ICQ is known as the first true instant-messaging client, released in late
1996, and has long been known for its outlandish sound effects. ICQ was

designed with a peculiar name, an acoronym for “I Seek You,” by a team of
Israeli programmers. ICQ itself hosts over 20 million active users from all
across the world, as stated by one of AOL’s press statements
(www.corp.aol.com/products/brands_icq.shtml).This user base is contested,
though; since ICQ and AIM share the same protocol, there is a chance that
the number is dramatically lower. Some market analysts put the ICQ user
base at a meager 1.8 million.
Life for ICQ changed quite a bit, though, in 2000, when it was acquired
by America Online. ICQ was left alone to continue to prosper, but its back-
end protocol design was altered to become compatible with AIM, allowing
AIM and ICQ users to communicate with each other.
Although ICQ doesn’t commandeer the great number of users that other
services do, it has an established presence in many foreign markets. It also
touts itself as a medium for online dating and relationships through its com-
plex homepage that attempts to ﬁnd compatible chat partners. Unfortunately,
like many other IM clients, it relies on many advertisements for its own fea-
tures and for other service providers, as shown in Figure 1.2.

Microsoft Windows Live Messenger
The up and coming challenger in the instant messaging world comes from
Microsoft, the behemoth from Redmond, Washington that likes its ﬁngers in
all of the pies.Their Microsoft Network (MSN) service was an attempt to
dominate the ISP world and compete with AOL, but the only real by-product
seems to be MSN Messenger. MSN Messenger ended up being one of the
cleanest and produced more efﬁcient IM clients for its time. With the release
of Windows Vista, Microsoft is moving forward with its MSN replacement,
Windows Live Messenger (WLM), as shown in Figure 1.3. WLM is proving
to be quite a capable IM client, with a much cleaner interface than most of its
competition.
Figure 1.3 Microsoft Live Messenger
Although it does have a hefty 17 different menu icons for services such as
MSN Video, MSN Shopping, MSN Dating, MSN Games, Rhapsody music,
and eBay, these are all mostly hidden away from the user.And just like every
other prominent client, it urges you to use its portal system, in this case MSN
Today, to catch up on your daily gossip. WLM does capture the second largest
user base in the IM community, though, with approximately 23 active million
users, as reported by comScore in July 2005. However, Microsoft is still

aiming for the top of the food chain with a recent deal with Yahoo! that will
allow the two clients to share user communications.
Yahoo! Messenger
With the arrival of Google,Yahoo! has been ﬁghting for its identity in the
online world. Its second-rate search engine was recently updated to match the
power of Google’s search engine, but a lot of its attention has been placed on
Yahoo! Messenger. If you are looking for ﬂash-bang graphical overload,
Yahoo! will probably be your client of choice. Not only can you force gaudy
commercialized themes, called IMVironments, onto your friends, but you can
also play a game of checkers with them. In Figure 1.4, you will notice that
you are pushed into a variety of advertisements for Pop-Tarts,Yahoo! Movies
Trailer plug-in,Yahoo! Voice Chat,Yahoo! Music LAUNCHcast,Yahoo! 360*,
Yahoo! Weather, and the Yahoo! Search engine.
However,Yahoo! Messenger has found its niche, since it holds the third
largest user base of IM clients, with approximately 21 million users
(www.thestreet.com/_googlen/markets/jamesaltucher/10242834.html). Its
numbers are sure to ﬂuctuate as it ﬁnally has merged its protocol with
Microsoft Live Messenger in summer 2005, allowing Yahoo! and Microsoft
Live users to communicate with each other.

QQ
Ever heard of QQ? You probably haven’t, although it is the most popular IM
chat client in the world. It has over 220 million active users on its service;
that’s more active users than all the other clients discussed here combined!
However, its user base is predominantly Asian, with large usage in China,
Korea, and Japan, along with signiﬁcant usage in South Africa. So why do I
mention it? Well, 220 million users can’t be wrong! However, much of this
success is because QQ operates very anonymously, without even requiring an
e-mail address for registration. QQ features a very clean and simple interface,
as shown in Figure 1.5, with no advertisements and no pushy pop-up win-
dows.There are no additional frill packages, just honest-to-goodness chat.This
is what the people want, and they have been waiting for it here in the United
States! Their wishes have ﬁnally been answered with Google Talk.

What’s Wrong With This Picture?
Now that you’ve brieﬂy looked through what the market has to offer, what
do you see wrong?  There is plenty to complain about: advertisements, pop-
up windows, portal home pages, dozens of icons and buttons, and a lack of
concise design. Much of these products are tailored towards the young
teenage crowd, with an emphasis on games and playing “dress up” with your
own avatar. What about the practical user in all of us?  Our inner adult wants
to get down to brass tacks, bypass all of the graphical ﬂuff, and just chat with
friends. We don’t care what dress Tiffany’s ﬁctional avatar is wearing. What
we want is a simple to use program that makes it easy to ﬁnd our friends and
talk to them, as shown in Figure 1.6. The answer for this type of user is
Google Talk.
Figure 1.6 Google Talk Client
Introducing Google Talk
The Google Talk client was a huge step forward for Google as a means of
tying in communications with its wide suite of applications. For one, Google
Talk is one of the few open-standard chat services around, using the widely

popular Jabber protocol. It is ubiquitous in your world, allowing you to con-
nect through a standalone client, Google Mail, or many of Google’s other
Web-based applications.
When Google Talk was envisioned, the planners decided to take advantage
of the Jabber protocol, an open-standard protocol based upon XML that’s used
in a large variety of networks. Its design makes it easy for third-party developers
to create modiﬁcations and extensions to Google Talk or create their own
clients that can converse with Google Talk users.This is vastly different from all
the other prominent IM services, which use their own closed-source protocols
and spend countless hours blocking access from outside clients.
Google Talking Without a Client
Throughout this book we will become intimately familiar with the Google
Talk standalone client, shown in Figure 1.6. However, that is not the only
means of communication. Google turned a lot of heads when it decided to
implement Google Talk capabilities within Google Mail, as shown in Figure
1.7. Using any Internet-accessible computer in the world, you can now jump
in to check your Gmail and chat with all your friends.Although there is a bit
of difference in how the standalone and the Web-based clients work, they
share the same protocol and basic functionality. Many of these differences will
be discussed later in this book, and we’ll discuss how you can setup and use
each of these implementations.

Chapter 1 • Introduction

Obviously, the sky is the limit for an application like Google Talk, with the
full resources of Google, Inc. behind it. Google Talk has already been imple-
mented into other Google apps, such as their Google Desktop (http://desktop.
google.com), with the potential for it to be included in numerous other appli-
cations, such as Google’s Documents and Spreadsheets applications. Google’s
interoperability is often the butt of many jokes, though, after the recent press
that they have received over their ad-based Google Mail system. Pretty soon,
we may see Google Talk monitoring our conversations, as demonstrated in the
UserFriendly.org comic strip in Figure 1.8.

Notes From the Underground…
Docs and Spreadsheets Aren’t There Yet
Many people who use Google’s Web-based applications will notice some
of the many advanced features that they provide, such as a discussion
capability. In Google Spreadsheets, you can open a shared spreadsheet

document with your friends, family, or coworkers and send messages
about the content while simultaneously editing the document. Such a
chat feature might seem right up Google Talk’s alley, but it’s actually using
a standard Web-based chat format. However, keep your eyes on it; there
is great hope for what Google Docs and Spreadsheets can become. Think
of creating a new spreadsheet and picking names off your Google Talk
contact list to share the contents with, then tying in the discussion with
your Talk buddies. 
Google Talking On the Go
Along with its Web-based interface for communicating with others, Google
Talk is also available on a number of portable communication devices, such as
the RIM BlackBerry, as shown in Figure 1.9, and the Nokia 770 Internet
Tablet.There is strong potential for an even greater market presence with
Google Talk for Palm devices and cell phones. How about Google Talk on
your wrist watch?

How Did We Get Here?
 The instant-messaging world that we currently enjoy has been in
development for well over a decade as dozens of IM clients battled
for market dominance.
 The use of IM marks a signiﬁcant departure in the way modern
Internet users view their online friends and their time online.Today
we don’t want to commit ourselves to a chat application and invest
the time in sitting in chat rooms. We want instantaneous
communication with friends and family, no matter what we are doing
at the time.
The Rise of Google
 Google Inc., starting from the development of an ingenious search
engine design, has grown into a multibillion-dollar corporation that
seeks to revolutionize the way people operate on the Internet.
 Google Talk is just one small side project of the greater Google good
and symbolizes Google’s attitudes toward allowing its employees to
work on fun pet projects that could grow up to change the world.
The Instant-Messaging World
 Although ICQ might have been the ﬁrst recognized instant-
messaging service, it has deﬁnitely fallen behind the times, holding
signiﬁcantly fewer devoted users than any other prominent IM
service.
 AIM has been able to leverage its large established America Online
user base into the largest IM market in North America and still
retains that title through numerous client enhancements.

 Yahoo! Messenger and Microsoft’s Windows Live Messenger have
been vying for the lead position, and now that both clients
intermingle, their combined user base could spell trouble for AIM.
 One of the greatest disadvantages to most IM clients is their creeping
features, where numerous insigniﬁcant modiﬁcations are favored over
the core chat experience.
 QQ leads the world in active users through its established market in
Asia and with its simpliﬁed and to-the-point interface.
Introducing Google Talk
 Google Talk might be the newest IM service to emerge, but with a
strong brand name and loyal following, it could become one of the
most popular clients in upcoming years.
 Google Talk not only operates with its standalone client, it is also tied
into a number of Google services, such as Google Mail.
 For chatters on the move, Google Talk is also fully supported on
numerous mobile devices, such as the RIM BlackBerry and Nokia
770 tablet.

Q: I use Trillian for all of my instant messaging. Does Google Talk integrate
into it?
A: Trillian is an excellent client that features a simpliﬁed interface that
appeals to many users.Trillian is also a free product that allows you to
communicate with a wide variety of instant-messaging services. However,
the free version of Trillian does not support Google Talk; you will have to
purchase Trillian Pro. If Google Talk is going to be your client of choice,
and you don’t use accounts on many other services, it is much easier and
cheaper just to use the Google Talk client.
Q: When will Google Talk be taken out of Beta?
A: That’s impossible to say. Many Google products stay in the Beta stage for
months, if not years, because they are constantly being ﬁne-tuned and
updated. Many developers are hesitant to put the ﬁnal stamp of approval
on their product until they are sure that it is completely bug free and has
all the features users want. However, as any software program manager can
tell you, sometimes products have to ship with bugs. It is advantageous for
Google to have its product sit in Beta mode, where millions of adven-
turous users can test and abuse it, without having to commit the company
to Google Talk being a ﬁnal product.

Introduction
In this chapter, we’ll look at what’s required to begin making and taking calls
in Google Talk. Depending on your platform, the installation requirements
and steps are slightly different, so feel free to skip down to the section that
covers your particular platform.
Minimum System Requirements
So you’ve heard all about this Internet telephone thing that the world is
buzzing about, and you’ve decided you want to get on board. Good for you!
Let’s look at the steps you’ll need to take to get Google Talk properly installed
and conﬁgured so you can begin to reach out and touch someone. First
things ﬁrst: We need to ensure that your computer system meets Google Talk’s
minimum requirements.
Connection Speed: Broadband vs. Dial-Up
First you need an Internet connection. I know, I know … an Internet con-
nection? For an Internet phone call? Stop the presses! Although this might
seem blindingly obvious, it is important that your connection have enough
bandwidth to accommodate Internet telephone trafﬁc. What is bandwidth?
Bandwidth is a measure of the capacity of a communications channel.The
higher a channel’s bandwidth, the more information it can carry.
So what does this mean to you, the Google Talk user? Basically, there are
two types of bandwidth: broadband and dial-up.This is of course a dangerous
over-generalization, but for consumer-level Internet connections, this deﬁni-
tion will sufﬁce. Broadband is generally considered to be anything at the
Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) level and faster, such as the common cable
modem Internet connection.
Normal dial-up Internet, also referred to as narrowband, is any Internet
connection over the plain old telephone system (POTS) network.These con-
nections require a user to dial  the Internet service provider (ISP) over the
phone and are considerably slower than cable or DSL. In contrast, cable/DSL
connections are “always on”—that is, as long as your computer or a device
directly connected to the modem is powered on, you will have Internet 
connectivity.

So why does all this matter? So glad you asked! Voice over Internet
Protocol (VoIP) requires a lot of bandwidth to send voice trafﬁc at acceptable
speeds. Without a sufﬁcient connection, the quality of the audio will decrease,
echo, jitter, and become otherwise unusable.Typical dial-up connections
simply don’t have the room or the speed to make telephone calls; ironic, con-
sidering that this trafﬁc is over telephone lines in the ﬁrst place. If you happen
to live in an area where broadband Internet connectivity is not available, that
doesn’t mean that you will be unable to use Google Talk, but it does exclude
you from taking advantage of Google Talk’s voice chat capabilities. However,
if you are fortunate enough to have access to a broadband connection, you
will be able to take advantage of all Google Talk’s features.
Upload and Download Speeds
An important thing to keep in mind in regard to bandwidth speed is that not
all connection speeds are created equal.This matters most when it comes to
upload speed, which affects your ability to send audio. Upload speed is how
fast you can send data. Conversely, download is the speed at which you receive
data. Most cable modems and DSL lines have asynchronous speeds, which
means that the download speed is generally much faster than the upload
speed.This is especially important over shared Internet connections, such as at
a Wi-Fi hotspot or on a local area network (LAN).Although download
speeds are often plentiful, the same numbers of people are sharing the min-
imal upload bandwidth, which might result in choppy or unusable call audio.
As a guideline, the following are average speeds associated with their
respective Internet connection types:
■
Cable modem 4Mbps download, 250kps upload
■
Standard DSL 1.5 Mbps download, 128kbps upload
■
Satellite 500kbps download, 56kps upload

Testing Your Bandwidth Speeds 
Many places on the Internet, such as www.bandwidthplace.com/speedtest/,
will give you a measurement of your connection’s bandwidth speeds.
However, these sites will typically measure only your download speed, and
Google Talk is more dependent on upload speed. For an accurate measure of
upload speed, check out the speed test at www.dslreports.com/stest/. Please
note also that although this site supports most geographic locations, not all
places are supported, so your mileage may vary.
Microphone and Speakers
Now that you’ve made sure you’ve got the download and upload speeds nec-
essary to make a Google Talk call, you need some equipment to actually send
and receive audio. Speciﬁcally, you’ll need a microphone and speakers. In this
section, we’ll look at some considerations for these required accessories.
Headsets
Google recommends using a headset (which integrates both a microphone
and a headphone speaker), such as the ones made by Logitech. For optimal
sound quality, get a headset with full duplex. Full duplex means that the
headset can receive and send audio simultaneously.
You’ll also want a headset that offers noise cancellation.This ensures that
you will not have any echo or feedback in the audio (high-pitched shrills that
sound not unlike a dying narwhal) and will eliminate most of the ambient
background noise in the area.

Microphone and Headphones
If you don’t have access to a headset such as those made by Logitech, you can
use regular headphones like the ones that come with any iPod or CD player
and a generic microphone. Both can be obtained at most stores with an elec-
tronics department, such as Best Buy or even Wal-Mart. It is important to
prevent the sound from the headphones reaching the microphone or you will
experience the dreaded audio assault of feedback.
You will probably need to ﬁddle with the audio settings for both the
microphone and the headphones. Ideally you want the headphones no louder
than what is required to clearly hear the person on the call, and you want the
microphone no more sensitive than is needed to be heard clearly by your
caller.
A Word About Laptops
The majority of laptops manufactured today come from the factory with
built-in speakers and a built-in microphone.Although it is still advisable to
use a set of headphones with this conﬁguration, you can have a perfectly
good experience without one.You will still need to conﬁgure your micro-
phone’s sensitivity to avoid undesirable audio.
Bluetooth Headsets
Most modern mobile phones and many laptop computers come equipped
with Bluetooth. Bluetooth, the common name for devices complying with
the IEEE 802.15.1 standard, is a wireless technology for personal area net-
works (PANs) that allows wireless data exchange. Bluetooth works especially
well for headsets, allowing hands-free communication within a range of 1 to
10 meters, depending on the class of Bluetooth radio in the device.The
ranges for the respective radios are as follows:
■
Class 1 100 mW, 20 dBm, ~100 meters
■
Class 2 2.5 mW, 4 dBm, ~10 meters
■
Class 3 1 mW, 0 dBm, ~1 meter

You can use these Bluetooth headsets with Google Talk if you conﬁgure
your computer to send audio through the headset.To use a headset with a
computer, you must ﬁrst “pair” the devices.This is done by setting both the
computer and the headset in “discoverable” mode. Once the devices “see”
each other, you can connect them, usually requiring you to enter a password
or PIN in the setup software on your computer.The speciﬁcs of this opera-
tion vary greatly by manufacturer and model and so are beyond the scope of
this book. Consult the manuals that came with your headset and computer to
successfully pair the devices.
If your computer did not ship equipped with a Bluetooth device, you’re not
quite out of luck. Most consumer electronics and computer stores offer USB
dongles, which will augment your computer with Bluetooth capabilities.Again,
consult the manual that shipped with the dongle to properly conﬁgure it.
Notes from the Underground
Avoid Getting Bluejacked!
Remember not to keep your Bluetooth devices in “discoverable” mode
when they are not in the process of being paired. Some Bluetooth devices
have a weakness in the way the handshake between devices is imple-
mented, making it possible (however unlikely) for an attacker to pair to
your computer without your permission. This could enable all sorts of
hacker hijinks. Of course, it would require the attacker to be within phys-
ical proximity to you, but it is still an important thing to keep in mind.
USB Phones
With the rise in popularity of VoIP, manufacturers are starting to answer the
public outcry for devices that mimic a traditional telephone.These phones
further erase the line between standard POTS telephone calls and VoIP calls
such as those made by Google Talk. By recreating a familiar experience, these
phones bring VoIP to a broader market.
www.syngress.com

Chapter 2 • Installation

The prices of these phones vary greatly depending on feature set, such as
Google Talk integration (allowing you to log into Google Talk and place calls
directly from the handset) or wireless capabilities that allow you to roam your
living room as you take and make calls.The average price range for a USB
phone is between $20 and $200.
Most USB phones are still very early in the software development stage
and tend to be geared toward Skype, a competitive product to Google Talk.
However, as Google Talk gains popularity, more phones are being shipped
with compatibility for both VoIP clients.Also, many manufacturers provide an
update to the ﬁrmware (the software that controls the phone) to include sup-
port for Google Talk and other clients.
At the time of writing, the only phone completely compatible with
Google Talk is the Yealink P1K USB phone.This phone retails for about
US$50 and is compatible with Google Talk, Skype,Yahoo! Messenger, MSN
Messenger, and VoIP Buster.This phone can be used on all major platforms,
including Microsoft Windows,Apple’s Mac OS X, and Linux Fedora Core 3.

Personal Computer (PC) Requirements
At the time of this printing, Google Talk is only ofﬁcially available for com-
puters running Microsoft Windows, although third-party applications will
allow you to connect to the Google Talk network. We’ll discuss third-party
applications in Chapter 5, but let’s take a quick look at the system require-
ments for Google Talk now:
■
Microsoft Windows 2000, Windows XP (Home and Pro), or
Windows Server 2003; you may use Linux if you have a client that
supports the XMPP Protocol
■
A 56k dial-up connection or a faster broadband connection such as
DSL, cable modem, or satellite
■
At least 10 megabytes of hard drive space; Google Talk will work
with less but could have undesired effects
■
256k or more of RAM memory; Google Talk will work with less but
may have undesired effects
www.syngress.com
Installation • Chapter 2
25

■
1GHz or faster processor; Google Talk will run on a computer with
less but may have undesired effects
■
A full-duplex sound card with a microphone and headphone jack
(for voice calls); a single-duplex sound card will work, but the audio
will be choppy, and you will not be able to hear someone talk if you
are already talking, and vice versa
Installing Google Talk on Windows
Before we get to actually installing and running Google Talk on our Windows
system, we need to ﬁrst ensure that our sound card is correctly conﬁgured
and fully functional. Ensure that your headset or microphone/headphone
combination are properly connected to the computer. If you are using a USB
device, simply plug the device into an available USB port and, if necessary,
follow any on-screen instructions to install the device.
If you are using a more traditional microphone or headset with standard
headphone jacks, make sure the speakers or earphones are plugged into the
audio-out port (typically colored green) and the microphone is plugged into
the microphone jack (usually pink). More often than not, there will be a
symbol in the shape of a microphone or headphones to guide you.
Windows comes with a program called Sound Recorder that we will use to
run a test to make sure our equipment is set up properly.To do this, we will
record and then play back an audio clip using our recording and playback
devices. Sound Recorder is available by clicking Start | Programs |
Accessories | Entertainment | Sound Recorder, as shown in Figure 2.1.

Open Sound Recorder, as shown in Figure 2.2, then click the red
button on the far right of the application to begin recording. Now speak into
the microphone.
Figure 2.2 Windows Sound Recorder
You should notice some activity on the green line that runs through the
center of the program window, which represents the audio wave form the
program is recording (in this case, your voice). Click the Stop button next to
the Record button and then play back the audio. If you hear your voice
played back to you, congratulations! Your sound card is functional and your
microphone is correctly connected. If you did not hear yourself, something
went wrong and we have to troubleshoot.
Troubleshooting Windows Audio Recording
The ﬁrst thing to check if the recording did not play back is whether or not
the microphone or the sound card has been muted.
In Figure 2.3, the computer’s sound card is set to mute, noted by the icon
of a speaker with the slashed red circle over it. If you see this symbol, single-
click the icon with the left mouse button to bring up the mute dialog box, as
shown in Figure 2.4. Uncheck the mute button and replay the audio ﬁle. Do
you hear yourself? If so, move on to installing the application. If not, we need
to investigate further. Don’t despair! Help is on the way!

So you are certain your computer’s sound card is not muted, but you still
aren’t getting any audio.The next thing we need to check is whether or not
the microphone has been muted.To bring up the Volume Control window
(shown in Figure 2.5), double-click the speaker icon in the system tray.
Ensure that the Mute check box remains unchecked in the Microphone set-
tings. If it is checked, uncheck it and rerecord your test audio. If you can hear
yourself, continue to the section on installing the application.

Installing the Application
Now that you’ve made it this far, you are very close to making your ﬁrst
Google Talk call. Continue down the home stretch by visiting
http://talk.google.com/ to sign up for an account and download the client. If
you already have a Google account (created by signing up for Google Groups,
Gmail, or another Google service), you can simply skip this section.Your
existing account will work just ﬁne for Google Talk.
Click the Sign up here link on the Google Talk main page to begin the
process of creating an account.The accounts setup page (shown in Figure 2.9)
requires that you have an existing e-mail account.You’ll also need to choose a
strong password of six characters or longer. When checked, the Remember
me option will automatically log you in when you launch Google Talk.This
is not recommended if you are using a shared computer.The Enable
Personalized Search option is discussed in Chapter 4.You can opt to enable or
disable this feature at a later time.

Notes From the Underground…
Weak Passwords Mean Weak Security!
Google Talk and Google Accounts require you to create only a six-digit
password, but it is recommended that you create one much longer and
stronger than that. Your Google Accounts password protects more than
just your Google Talk account; it could also protect your Gmail and other
Google applications. Short passwords with no “special characters” (char-
acters other than a–z and 0–9) in them are cracked much easier than
those of eight characters or more. Avoid using words found in the dictio-
nary as passwords or you can consider your accounts compromised. The
longer the password, the safer your account will be.
Next you are prompted for your desired username and, optionally, your ﬁrst
and last names. If you include your ﬁrst and last names, they will be displayed
when users query your proﬁle for information about you. Lastly, you’ll need to
ﬁll out the Google Word Veriﬁcation form with the word pictured in the box.
You might notice that the displayed word looks odd, often in a random color
and displayed in a zigzag or wavy line.This is to prevent automated tools from
signing up for accounts that can be used to send IM or telephonic spam, the
digital equivalent of junk mail and telemarketing messages.The idea is that only
a sentient human should be able to read the word displayed in the image.
Automating Google processes without using their programmer API (a means of
interacting with Google legally for programmers) is explicitly prohibited and a
big no-no. Doing so could get you in big trouble with Google and should be
avoided.
Lastly, read the terms of service and the privacy policy, and check the box
indicating that you have done so.
After downloading the client, you might see a yellow shield icon like the
one pictured in Figure 2.10.This is to warn you that the application may be a
security risk if you did not intend to download it and/or do not know and

What Type of Operating System Should I Use?
 All modern operating systems have clients which will allow you to
connect to the Google Talk network.
 For maximum compatibility with Google Talk and its users, it is
recommended to use Windows.
Audio Hardware Requirements
 Use a full-duplex sound card if you can.This will allow you to send
and receive audio simultaneously, much like a real telephone.
 Ideally you’ll have a headset with noise-cancellation features to ﬁlter
out unwanted background noise, although a standard
headphone/microphone combination should sufﬁce.
Bandwidth Considerations
 Public WiFi hotspots are not good for Google Talk use, since the
upload bandwidth stream is limited and is shared among all patrons of
the access point.
 Dial-up Internet connections of 56k or higher are usable, but the
audio will sound poor. Dial-up is really only suitable for text chatting
with another user.
 Whenever possible, use a wired Ethernet connection to a LAN with
broadband or faster speeds.

Q: Do I need to install a program to use Google Talk?
A: No, you can use the text chat features of Google Talk through Gmail.
Q: Will Google Talk cost me anything?
A: Maybe. Google Talk is itself a free service, and calling other people with
Google Talk over the Internet does not cost extra in and of itself.You will
need an Internet connection, which might cost you money.Also, some
ISPs might charge you by how much bandwidth you use, and therefore
you might incur cost from the additional trafﬁc.
Q: I use an instant-messaging client you did not talk about. Can I still con-
nect to Google Talk?
A: As long as the client you use supports the Jabber protocol, you will be
able to peer with Google Talking. Consult the documentation for your
client to connect to Google’s Jabber network. We’ll discuss non-Windows
applications in the next chapter.

 Frequently Asked Questions

Introduction
It might seem to some that the world revolves around Microsoft Windows,
but some of us know better. Millions of Linux and Macintosh users out there
make up a very vocal minority. Well, guess what? You guys aren’t completely
left out of Google Talk. Even though the ofﬁcial Google Talk client is only
available for Windows, it is possible to use third-party applications in both
Linux and OS X to chat with your Google Talk friends.
This is all made possible because Google has taken advantage of the Jabber
protocol, an open-source network design that anyone can tap into and start
using.This is completely the opposite philosophy of other IM clients, such as
AOL Instant Messenger,Yahoo! Messenger, and Microsoft Messenger, which
have fought to keep third-party clients from connecting to their networks.
Google runs an open Google Talk server at talk.google.com that allows
connections from any client using the Jabber protocol.All a client has to do is
connect to the correct listening port on talk.google.com and they can imme-
diately start chatting with their friends.
Tools & Traps…
Google Talk’s Listening Port
Google Talk’s server, talk.google.com, uses a number of TCP port numbers
that listen for connections from clients. The two ports that it uses most
commonly for Google Talk connections are 5222 and 5223. A port is just
a unique number that allows one speciﬁc type of data to connect. This is
like visiting a huge corporate building with thousands of doors leading to
various ofﬁces. Depending on who you want to talk to, you have to enter
a particular door. Door 80 takes you to the Web content, door 25 to the
mailroom. Some clients might only work on one port and not the other.
If you are receiving unusual error messages when you attempt to log in,
such as “Read Error,” you might want to change the port that your client
is connecting to from 5222 to 5223, or vice versa.

Gaim for Linux
Gaim, an open-source, instant-messaging client, is one of the most popular
clients in use today. It can be downloaded from http://gaim.sourceforge.net
and installed on a variety of operating systems, such as Windows, Linux, and
OS X. Gaim allows you to connect to a very wide variety of IM networks,
including AIM, ICQ, MSN,Yahoo! Messenger, IRC, QQ, and Jabber. In addi-
tion, Gaim’s support of Jabber allows it to connect directly to Google’s Talk
server.
The Gaim download page (http://gaim.sourceforge.net/downloads.php)
lists a number of RPM package management archives available for many of
the newest and most popular Linux distributions, though many popular distri-
butions are still not supported. If you aren’t interested in one of the mainline
RPM distributions, you can download the Autopackage version of Gaim or
the full source code.Autopackage is a new style of installer similar to the
Windows install “wizards.”Autopackage installation is simple: Download the
package, give it execute permission, and run it.
If you are unable to install the RPM or Autopackage versions of Gaim,
you might be forced to compile it straight from the source code.Although
many users prefer this method, it’s not for the faint of heart, and neither is it
for new Linux users.The INSTALL ﬁle inside the distribution contains the
exact installation procedure. Since the instructions are subject to change, we
will not outline them here, but sufﬁce it to say that the typical ./conﬁgure ;
make ; make install commands work well for most installations.Automake is
designed to facilitate these simpliﬁed installation instructions. Be sure that
GnuTLS (www.gnu.org/software/gnutls/) is installed before compiling from
source, because Gaim requires it to be able to log into the Google Talk net-
work. Without it, your client will display “ERROR: Server does not use any
supported authentication method” when trying to connect to Google Talk.
Setting Up Your Account
Once you’ve installed Gaim, go ahead and ﬁre it up. From the command line,
simply type gaim.The ﬁrst time that Gaim loads, it will display the basic
login screen, as shown in Figure 3.1. From here, you will need to set up your
Google Talk account. Do this by clicking Accounts.

your account is stored. Since all Google Talk accounts are Gmail accounts,
gmail.com is the option to specify here. Ensure that Use TLS if available
is checked. Set the Connect Server to talk.google.com and the Port to
5222.
Gaim allows you to conﬁgure a proxy for communications between your
computer and Google Talk.This can be done by changing the Proxy Type
from Use Global Proxy Settings to SOCKS 4 or SOCKS 5, depending
on the type of proxy you use. Most users will leave this setting as it is.

iChat for OS X
For the many Macintosh users in the world, iChat is one of the most used
instant-messaging clients.This could be simply because it’s built into the
operating system and most users are too lazy to replace something that already
exists, but it’s also a very simple and easy-to-use program that’s already right
there in your dock. iChat allows most users to immediately get up and chat-
ting on a variety of networks, including AIM, .Mac, and Jabber.You can even
be logged into multiple networks at the same time, chatting with Windows
and Mac friends simultaneously.
Tools & Traps
Using the Correct Version of iChat
Because OS X has changed quite a bit between its versions, so did its
internal applications such as iChat. iChat did not add support for the
Jabber network and Google Talk until its release in Tiger (version 10.4). So,
all you Panther users, and even those who still use Jaguar and Puma, need
to step up and buy the latest version.

Setting Up Your Account
The ﬁrst time that you run iChat, you are prompted to conﬁgure your
accounts. From here, you can enter in information for your AIM, .Mac, or
Jabber accounts. However, if you want to use iChat to connect to Google
Talk, the setup screen, shown in Figure 3.6, does not give you all the options
you need to really set it up. Simply click Continue. We’ll set up the account
afterward.
Figure 3.6 iChat Initial Setup
Once iChat is up and running, we need to go into its preferences to set
up our Google Talk account.To do so, just select iChat | Preferences from
the top of your screen, or press the Command key. Once in the preferences
screen, you should see an icon labeled Accounts, wherein you can manage all
your supported chat accounts. Now we just need to add Google Talk to iChat
as a Jabber account. Do this by clicking the + button in the bottom left of
the window to bring up the account creation screen, shown in Figure 3.7.
From here, pull down the list of items for Account Type and choose Jabber
Account. Under Jabber ID, type your full Gmail address, such as
yourname@gmail.com. (My apologies to readers named Your Name.) If you
are not using a Google Mail account, type the username that you registered

After you’ve added your Jabber account, details will be shown in the
right-hand portion of the Preferences window.These details are broken into
two sections:Account Information, shown in Figure 3.8, and Server Settings,
shown in Figure 3.9.The Account Information section allows you to specify
your e-mail address and password and whether or not you’d like to automati-
cally log into this account when iChat is launched.The information you
typed into iChat’s setup dialogs is populated into these ﬁelds.

In the Server Settings section (see Figure 3.9), verify that the server is set
to talk.google.com and that the port is set to 5223. Because Google Talk
encrypts its authentication trafﬁc, you need to ensure that the options
Connect using SSL and Allow self-signed certiﬁcates are checked. Make
sure that you have a location value set so that others know where you’re chat-
ting from.The easiest option is just to check Use my machine name so
that you don’t have to worry about it.

Once iChat is up and running, its usage is very straightforward.After con-
necting to Google Talk, you will be presented with your familiar buddy list, as
shown in Figure 3.10. From here, you can monitor which of your contacts
are online and initiate chats with them. Double-clicking any (online) name
will open a chat window, like the one shown in Figure 3.11.

iChat Limitations
The implementation of Jabber and Google Talk into Tiger’s version of iChat
does have some great limitations. It can only perform some very basic func-
tions, such as being able to add and remove friends from your contact list or
chat with them. It does not have the capability to send ﬁles or voicemails to
other users.As shown in Figure 3.12, the only options to perform under the
Buddies menu are Get Info and Change My Picture. Obviously, iChat is great
as a very basic chat client because it is already built into OS X, but it lacks
the advanced features that some users enjoy.
Figure 3.12 iChat Menu
Adium X for OS X
OS X’s iChat can provide basic chatting abilities, but it is severely lacking in
some of the more advanced features. Some users might also want to use a
single client to access even more networks than iChat allows. For these users,
there is Adium X, downloadable from www.adiumx.com, which is possibly
the greatest IM client for OS X machines.Adium X, which we’ll shorten to
just Adium, is a free program that is easily installed and conﬁgured by visiting
its Web site and downloading the application as a DMG (disk image) ﬁle.
Once downloaded, the ﬁle will automatically open and you will be given the
opportunity to install it, as shown in Figure 3.13.

Setting Up Your Account
The ﬁrst time that you run Adium it will automatically open the Preferences
screen, where you can add new accounts, as shown in Figure 3.14. If you’re
already an Adium user, simply select the Adium | Preferences menu from
the top of your screen to open this window. Similar to iChat, if you want to
add a new account, click the + button located in the lower-left portion of the
screen.This will drop down a menu of all the various networks that Adium
supports, in which you will notice Google Talk, along with a wide variety of
other popular IM networks.

After you select Google Talk from this menu, a new window will appear,
allowing you to conﬁgure your account information.This window is divided
into ﬁve sections, allowing you to fully customize your account and its con-
nection.The ﬁrst section is the Account screen, shown in Figure 3.15. From
this screen, enter your Google Talk e-mail address as the Jabber ID and your
Google Talk password.You can also select whether or not to automatically log
into this account when Adium starts.
The Personal screen allows you to give yourself an alias name that will be
shown to your friends in their contact lists.You can also specify an avatar
image for your account that will be displayed to all your friends.
Figure 3.15 Adium Account Settings
The Options screen, shown in Figure 3.16, allows you to conﬁgure the
server to connect to and the way the connection should be made. From here,
just type talk.google.com as the Connect Server and specify 5222 as the
connection port.To connect to Google Talk, you must check the box labeled
Use TLS encryption.
Figure 3.16 Adium Server Settings
www.syngress.com
52
Chapter 3 • Google Talk for Non-Windows Users

The Privacy screen gives you the option of encrypting your messages to
your friends. However, this is performed automatically by Google Talk
through the TLS encryption speciﬁed in Figure 3.16, so there’s no need to
change the settings here.You can also specify whether you want to send noti-
ﬁcations to your friends that you are in the middle of typing a message to
them.
You also have the ability to conﬁgure Adium to connect to Google Talk
through a proxy server by viewing the Proxy screen, shown in Figure 3.17.
By using a proxy, you can hide your computer’s IP address from Google and
you can hide the fact that you’re using Google Talk from your local network
monitors. Proxy usage is discussed in depth later in this book.
When you’ve conﬁgured everything for your account, click the OK
button to save the details and log in.
Figure 3.17 Adium Proxy Settings
Using Adium X
When you ﬁrst log into your account, you’ll be presented with a normal con-
tact list window that’ll show all your friends who are currently online.To
view your ofﬂine friends, simply select View | Show Ofﬂine Contacts, as
shown in Figure 3.18. From this same menu, you can also change how your
contacts should be sorted and displayed on your list.

Figure 3.18 Adium Menu
Chatting with Adium is very straightforward. Simply click your friend’s
name to open a chat window, as shown in Figure 3.19. From here, simply
type your messages and chat back and forth.Adium is also much more com-
patible with Google Talk than iChat is, allowing you to perform extra func-
tions, such as transferring ﬁles to and receiving ﬁles from your friends.
To add a new friend to your contact list, choose Contact | Add
Contact… from the top of your screen, where you can simply type in the
Google Talk username of your new friend. Removing a friend is just as easily
done by selecting the name in your list and choosing Contact | Remove

Chapter 3 • Google Talk for Non-Windows Users

Summary
While Google has created their own ofﬁcial Google Talk client, they do allow
connection from other clients for other operating systems. This allows for
users of both Linux and OS X to also share into the Google Talk experience.
Much of this is possible because Google has decided to embrace Jabber -  an
open protocol, one in which its entire layout and structure is publicly docu-
mented, unlike the protocols used by most other IM services, so alternative
clients can be used instead of the ofﬁcial client.
Gaim is one of the most popular of these alternative clients, being an
open-source application available for a large number of operating systems. It
can either be downloaded as the full source code, which you must conﬁgure
and compile, or as a pre-compiled binary, similar to Windows installations.
You simply need to add a new Jabber account and complete it with Google
Talk information, as shown throughout this chapter.
For Macintosh users, you already have one Google Talk compatible client
built into the operating system, iChat. The version in Tiger (OS X 10.4) is
the ﬁrst that supports logging into Google Talk through its Jabber setup.
Using iChat you can communicate easily with your friends, but there are also
a large number of features that you will not be able to access. A more robust
solution for Mac users is Adium X, a client that allows you to connect to
multiple IM networks simultaneously. By creating a Jabber account in
Adium, you can easily connect to the Google Talk network, and have access
to more features than iChat.

Chapter 3 • Google Talk for Non-Windows Users

Q: Why am I unable to have Gaim connect to Google Talk? It’s always com-
plaining that the server “doesn’t use any supported authentication
method,”
A: This is a common problem with the Gaim client and is normally caused
by Gaim being unable to ﬁnd the TLS libraries to support encrypted
communications. Normally this can be ﬁxed by installing the gnutls and
gnutls-devel packages and compiling Gaim from source with ./conﬁgure
—enable-gnutls=yes.
Q: I don’t really like any of the clients discussed here. What other client
options do I have for Google Talk?
A: There is actually a wide variety of clients that you can use to connect to
Google Talk.Any client that supports the Jabber protocol and TLS encryp-
tion will have you up and running. Clients that Google recommends
include Miranda (www.miranda-im.org), Psi (http://psi.afﬁnix.com), and
Trillian Pro (www.ceruleanstudios.com). Of these,Trillian Pro is the only
one that is a commercial product.

Using Google Talk
So you’ve just installed Google Talk. Good for you! Now let’s spend a few
moments getting your client all set up and ready for you to be able to chat
with your friends and family. One of Google Talk’s greatest features is its sim-
plicity.As is the case with nearly every product that Google has created or
endorsed, Google Talk was designed to be very straightforward and easy to
use, and it features an extremely clean interface, as shown in Figure 4.1. We’ll
begin with how to add your friends to your contact list and how to remove
your friends who have turned into enemies.This section will also touch on
how to change your Google Talk status to let others know if you’re away or
just jamming to music.
Figure 4.1 Google Talk Main Screen
Your Contact List
Now that Google Talk is installed, let’s chat. Oh, but you can’t chat with
yourself (much to the chagrin of the neurotic); you ﬁrst have to add contacts
to chat with. Luckily, Google Talk’s contact list is closely related to your
Google Mail (Gmail) address book, which will likely reduce the number of
www.syngress.com
60
Chapter 4 • Google Talk Usage

contacts you might otherwise have to add. Normally, you would need to add
each individual friend who you communicate with to your contact list and
have them add you in return. However, Google Talk will automatically parse
through contacts from your Gmail account and add them to your contact list.
In situations where you have hundreds of contacts in your Gmail account,
only the ones that you’ve most recently spoken with will be displayed.
The contacts within your contact list are broken into two styles. Contact
names that have a colored dot next to them, as shown in Figure 4.1, are
people who are also running Google Talk.The contacts that have a simple,
one-line name are contacts that have been added from your Gmail account.
These are contacts who have not installed Google Talk.
Adding Contacts
Even though a list of contacts can be added by default, you will not be able
to fully interact with many of them if they are not also running Google Talk.
This situation can be resolved by simply inviting these people to Google Talk.
You’re a special person; they respect and adore you. If you suggest using
Google Talk, they will inevitably agree. If you highlight a non-Google Talk
name (the one-liners in your list), a button labeled Invite will appear. When
you click this button, an invitation will be mailed to the recipient’s e-mail
address. Since I’m sure you don’t want your name associated with a cheesy
advertising e-mail that reeks of spam, check out Figure 4.2 to see the actual
e-mail contents showing exactly what your friends will receive. (Your name
and e-mail address will replace the author’s in the From and Subject ﬁelds and
the body of the message.)

* Not a Windows user? No problem. You can also connect to the Google Talk
service from any platform using third-party clients
(http://www.google.com/talk/otherclients.html).
But what can you do when you want to invite someone who is not
already on your contact list? Thankfully there’s a painfully obvious button
labeled +Add on the bottom left of the Google Talk screen. When you pres
this button, a window will appear, as shown in Figure 4.3, allowing you to
manually enter the e-mail addresses of all your friends, family, coworkers, and
failed blind dates.
Figure 4.3 Inviting a Friend
Once you have sent the invite, your friend will receive a notiﬁcation of it.
If you did not specify the friend’s Gmail account, a generic e-mail invite will
be sent to them, along with one of your available Gmail invites inviting them
to sign up for Gmail. If the friend already uses Google Talk, he or she will
receive a notice within their Google Talk client, as shown in Figure 4.4.This
notice gives the friend the option to appear on your contact list as a friend. If
the friend accepts your invitation, you will automatically be added to the
friend’s list at the same time.

When you start out on Google Talk, your contact list might be very small,
depressing to those who thought they had many friends. Fear not—you might
have more friends than those being shown! The default options limit the
number of contacts shown at one time on the screen, but you can easily
change this option by clicking the button labeled View at the bottom of the

Figure 4.5 Contact List View Options
A variety of options are shown to you after you click the View button:
■
Show one page Limits your entire contact list to one page full of
contacts.This page will show the people you’ve most recently com-
municated with via either Google Talk or Google Mail. By deselecting
this option, you will be able to view every single user in your contact
list.
■
Sort by name Displays all your contacts, in alphabetical order. By
default, your contact list will display ﬁrst the contacts who also use
Google Talk in alphabetical order and then the contacts who do not.
When you turn this feature on, the “haves” and the “have nots” will
both be mixed together and placed in alphabetical order.
■
Show pictures Displays the avatar of each Google Talk user next to
his or her name. Disabling these avatars will shrink the display size of
your contact list, allowing more users to ﬁt on a single page.
www.syngress.com

■
Show ofﬂine friends Displays all your friends, whether they are
online or not. When this option is deselected, your contact list will
be limited to those who are online at the current moment. Select this
option if you not knowing your contacts’ whereabouts gives you
anxiety attacks.
■
Also show Gmail contacts  Displays friends who do not use
Google Talk.Though the name of this option is misleading, when it’s
selected Google Talk will show all e-mail addresses of your friends,
whether they use Gmail or not. When it’s deselected, your contact list
will be limited to friends who also use Google Talk or those you
have invited to join.
Interacting With Contacts
Now that you have an established contact list, let’s explore some of the var-
ious options you can perform with your contact information. By moving
your mouse over a particular contact and hovering for one short second, you
will be rewarded with an additional window showing detailed information
about the selected person, as shown in Figure 4.6.This window will display to
you the contact’s name, e-mail address, and a larger picture of his or her
avatar, which we’ll discuss in a bit.You will also be shown more distinct but-
tons for interacting with the contact, such as Chat, Call, and Send Files.
Figure 4.6 Viewing Detailed Contact Information
www.syngress.com
66
Chapter 4 • Google Talk Usage

This functionality ﬁts well with Apple-type users—you know, the “one
mouse button” folks we laugh at. However, for advanced users with at least
two mouse buttons, you also have the ability to right-click a friend’s name to
receive even more options, as shown in Figure 4.7. Not only do you have the
usual options of chatting and calling other users, but you can even view prior
chat logs, rename users, block them, or remove them completely from your
contact list.
Figure 4.7 Right-Clicking a Friend’s Name
Renaming is a great way to give your friends names that you know them
by, even if those names cannot be repeated around sensitive ears. Don’t worry;
your friends can’t see what you’ve renamed them, so feel free to give them
whatever name they deserve.
Blocking a user gives you the ability to stop receiving messages altogether
from a particular “friend,” though you can still send this person messages.This
is a very useful feature that lets you ﬁnally tell your mother-in-law what you
think of her and not have to worry about her responses. However, when you
www.syngress.com
Google Talk Usage • Chapter 4
67

block a contact, he or she will be removed from your list and will see you as
being ofﬂine. If you continue to send that user messages, it will appear to the
user as though he or she is receiving text from an ofﬂine friend. If the user
attempts to respond, he or she will be presented with a message that reads
“Contact@gmail.com is ofﬂine and can’t receive messages right now.”
It’s a sad day when you have to remove a friend from your contact list, but
such extenuating circumstances do happen. Don’t worry; your friends at Google
have looked out for you. So you’re knee-deep in helping a poor Nigerian
widow send millions of dollars to your bank account, and you ﬁnally get an
inkling that things aren’t exactly on the up and up.Well, that’s okay. It is best to
back out now before you lose even more money, and remove the widow’s
name from your contact list forever. Right-click on her name, select
Remove…, and start anew.There are plenty of new friends, and hare-brained
schemes, out there waiting to be discovered; don’t dwell on the past.
Setting Status
Setting a status in an instant-messenger application seems fairly straightfor-
ward: you’re either there, or you’re not. However, many people don’t appre-
ciate the ﬁne science, even art, that comes with proper status setting. Setting
your status as “Available” gives the impression that you’re hard at work at the
computer, cranking away on whatever project is due, when you’re actually
sipping Mai Tais on the beach. Just make sure you get people used to the fact
that you don’t answer their chat requests even when you are there, so they get
used to it. Likewise, there’s equal fun in being the “man in the shadows” who
lurks all day as “Busy” and unavailable.You spend every moment of the day,
every day of the week, always set as busy.Your friends send you calls, and
occasionally you respond.You’re away, even when you’re right there. It’s the
perfect setup to decide whom you want to speak with and when, because no
one ever knows whether you’re really around.
However, if you want to set an actual, real status message, Google Talk
provides many different options.Your status is displayed as both a colored ball
icon to the left of your name as well as in text below your name.As you can
see in Figure 4.8, the text below “Brian Baskin” is set to Available.
www.syngress.com
68
Chapter 4 • Google Talk Usage

Figure 4.8 Changing Status
By clicking the down arrow next to the status message, you will be pre-
sented with a list of available settings.You can set yourself as available for chat
in three forms: a regular available status, available while displaying the song
you’re currently listening to, or a custom message that you can display to
others. Likewise, there are three identical options for setting yourself as Busy,
or unavailable. Finally, there is the option to sign out of Google Talk, which
will disconnect you from the network but leave the client running.
The colored ball icon next to your name, as well as the names of each of
your friends, allows you to easily identify status.Actually, since this book is
printed in black and white, you probably can’t see the green color without
(*ahem*) medicinal aids. Google must’ve thought ahead to a situation such as
this, because the balls for available status are whole and intact, while the balls
for being unavailable have an obvious small X drawn through them.
The option to Show current music track is one we’ll discuss a bit later
in this section. It will allow you to display the song that you’re currently lis-
www.syngress.com
Google Talk Usage • Chapter 4
69

tening to as your status message so that all your friends will be able to see
what you’re jamming to.You also have the ability to set a custom message that
will be shown to all your friends. For example, you can set yourself to avail-
able with a custom text message to notify you’re friends that you’re available
but working on a busy project, or that you’re available and logged in from
your work computer instead of your home. Equal imagination can make use
of the busy custom message by notifying others that you’ve stepped out for
the evening, gone to visit the parents for the weekend, or gone to the one-
day sale at the shoe store.
There are additional status levels that a client might fall into automatically.
When a client is set to available but the computer hasn’t been operated for
ﬁve minutes, the client will be set to idle, and an orange ball icon will be
placed next to the name.The idle status notiﬁes you that someone has been
away from their computer for an extended period of time. Google Talk is
based on the Jabber protocol, so there are additional status levels that are sup-
ported but not implemented into Google Talk, such as “extended away” and
“chatty.”At this time, Google Talk does not use these status levels, but it might
in the future.
Google Music Trends
Google Talk has implemented a variety of unique ideas to help foster society’s
infatuation with music and song sharing. Not only does Google Talk allow
you to display the song that you’re currently listening to your friends; it also
allows you to submit the songs that you enjoy to Google Labs’ Music Trends
site, www.google.com/trends/music.This option is enabled within the Google
Talk conﬁguration screens, covered later in this chapter.The music you play is
submitted to Google whenever you set your status to show your current
music track.This is the perfect chance to push the resurgence of Michael
Bolton or bring Yuki Kajiura to the eyes and ears of the masses.
The ability to display current music tracks and submit them to Google
Trends is available for users who run Apple iTunes, Windows Media Player,
Nullsoft Winamp, and Yahoo! Music Engine. Google anonymously collects
the song’s title and artist and the country in which you live to store in its
massive databases. On a nightly basis, Google updates the Music Trends site to
show the most popular songs for the prior week, as shown in Figure 4.9.

Emoticons and Text Formatting
The use of emoticons, or “smilies” in layman’s terms, has increased 473 per-
cent in the past two years. Or, at least it would seem that way based on their
use by IM users. Graphical smilies have become a booming business in the
past few years, enough so to make a few entrepreneurs smile themselves.At
the present time, the Google Talk client does not support graphical emoti-
cons, as other IM clients do. However, the use of emoticons is pretty much
guaranteed for future versions of the client, since a tentative list has already
been created and implemented into Gmail Chat. Many of the emoticons sup-
ported in Gmail Chat are shown in Figure 4.11; you type in the characters
shown on the left in each column, and Google magically transforms them
into the smiley shown on the right in the column. For the time being,
Google Talk simply understands many common smiley faces and will display
them in a bright blue color, which lacks a certain panache.
Figure 4.11 Google Talk and Gmail Chat Emoticons
Along with the use of smiley faces, you are also able to perform basic text
markups on your words, such as bolding or italicizing text. If you place text
within underscores, it will be displayed to your friend in italics. For example,
“Hi _j0hnny_!” would be displayed “Hi j0hnny!” Likewise, the asterisk is used
to display words in bold. For example,“There’s a *ﬂy* in my *soup*” would
www.syngress.com
72
Chapter 4 • Google Talk Usage

be displayed “There’s a ﬂy in my soup.”The special characters to do so seem
to pay homage to BBS and USENET users of old, because this was the style
in which certain words could be emphasized in the pure-text world.That was
before all these newfangled technologies like mice, and graphics, and rich-text
formatting.
Reviewing Old Chats
In a very decisive battle of “Big Brother” versus convenience, Google Talk
stores all your chats on its servers, to be easily accessible by your client no
matter where you are.The convenience is very much noticeable, since there
are countless situations in which you work out a plan to meet up with friends
at work and head home, only to forget what time you were supposed to
meet. Well, by simply logging into your Google Talk client at home, you can
review all chats you made, even if you were chatting on a completely different
machine or machines.There are a variety of ways to review previous chats
that you’ve had with friends; the easiest is to simply click the down arrow

Once you’ve selected to view past chats, a Web browser window will
open, taking you to your Gmail page.As we mentioned earlier in the book,
Google Talk shares much of its capabilities with Google Mail. It is from
within Gmail that you are able to review and even remove past chats between
you and your friends. If you use the same machine, it’s even possible to view
your spouse’s previous chats, though that’s usually not conducive to a solid
marriage. But feel free to monitor your kids’ chats; they’re minors, they have
no rights.
To view past chats within Google Mail, a search is applied for in:chats
from:(user@gmail.com).This will notify Gmail to only show chat logs and
to only show logs involving a particular e-mail address.This search item can
be modiﬁed to show all chat logs, though, by searching for in:chats, as shown
in Figure 4.13, or by clicking the link labeled Chats on Gmail’s menu. From
within the chat listing, you can select individual chats to view their full con-
tents, with timestamps.You also have the ability to select chats and delete
them or even report them as spam.

Chatting “Off the Record”
For those who love news-based sitcoms and dramas, the phrase “off the
record” is heard quite frequently, sometimes right before a trusted advisor
www.syngress.com
74
Chapter 4 • Google Talk Usage

confesses nefarious plans to an enthusiastic news journalist. Being “on the
record” is good for accountability and for reviewing logs at a later time, but
some chat situations are considered too sensitive to be saved to Google’s logs.
Thankfully, the team at Google has given us the ability to temporarily stop
logging chats, to prevent them from being saved and read at a later time. It’s a
great idea as you send plans for world domination to your army of killer
coding ninja monkeys.To go “off the record,” simply click the down arrow
located in the upper portion of your chat window and select Go off the
record, as shown in Figure 4.12.This does nothing to prevent your chat from
being listened to by local administrators with network sniffers; it only prevents
Google Talk from logging the chat.Your friend’s client will also respect your
“off the record” request and not log the conversation.
Notes from the Underground…
Subverting “Off the Record” 
Going “off the record” works only when two Google Talk clients are com-
municating with each other. If one client is using a nonstandard client
such as Gaim or iChat, they can still log the conversation, even when “off
the record” is turned on in Google Talk.
Speaking Your Mind
Even through the advent of the Internet, voice communication still remains
the principal way for people to talk to one another. Why else do we, as a
society, give eight-year-olds cell phones? No, don’t answer that.
Voice chat is also highly beneﬁcial for many of life’s events, like having
your child repeat their ﬁrst nonprofane words to their grandparents or allow-
ing you to chat with a friend while you’re cleaning out your desk. It also allows
you to bypass telephone lines altogether to speak one on one with another
person for free, even if they are located in another state or a foreign country.

Google Talk Usage • Chapter 4

Voice Chat
One of Google Talk’s greatest features is its simplistic approach to voice com-
munications.The voice chat function within the Google Talk client works by
simply initiating a voice call to a friend that you are chatting with.This is
accomplished by pressing the button labeled Call, which will produce a ring
tone on the recipient’s computer. When you “call” another user, they will be
presented with a window notifying them that you want to speak with them.
They then have the option to answer the call or ignore it, as shown in Figure
4.14. If your friend is not available to answer the call or if she or he ignores
the ringing, you will be automatically forwarded to Google Talk’s Voicemail
feature.
Once the friend has answered the call, the regular chat window will stay
open but also allow for voice communications.The chat window will also be
altered to display more information about the voice component of the chat,
as shown in Figure 4.15.The call can continue for hours or be terminated at
any time by pressing the button labeled End Call.Additionally, you can mute
your voice while still being able to listen to your friend, useful for allowing
you to make dramatic sighing noises as you listen to the details of their
boring lives, by pressing the button labeled Mute.

Voicemail
Every Google Talk client has the ability to create and record voicemail for
users, allowing you to leave short voice messages for a friend. Voicemails can
be used to send messages to someone when they are not around to take your
phone call or to send them a quick voice message when you don’t want to be
drawn into a conversation.This is particularly useful if you happen to run
across a famous literary superstar, like Neal Stephenson, and want to record a
quick celebrity shout-out to tease a buddy.
The voicemail message will be delivered immediately to your friend’s
Gmail Inbox for them to review at their leisure. Gmail will allow the voice-
mail to be played internally from within the friend’s Web browser or down-
loaded as an MP3 ﬁle so that you can create a “best of” collection.An
example of a sent voicemail is shown in Figure 4.16.
Figure 4.16 Voicemail in Gmail
Sharing Files and Tunes
Although the emphasis of Google Talk is on talk (hence the name of the
product), sharing data between friends is a high priority in the instant-mes-
senger world. Google Talk follows this trend by allowing you to send and
receive ﬁles between friends.
www.syngress.com
Google Talk Usage • Chapter 4
77

Sending and receiving ﬁles through Google Talk is as simple and
straightforward as every other function.As you are chatting with a friend,
simply press the button labeled Send Files in the chat window.A window
will appear, allowing you to locate the ﬁles that you want to send.After you
select the ﬁle to send, the recipient will receive a notice that you are transfer-
ring a ﬁle, as shown in Figure 4.17.The recipient then has the option of
either declining the transfer or accepting the ﬁle and placing in you their full
faith and trust that you are not sending them a virus-infested ﬁle or sheep-
related images.
Figure 4.17 Sending Files in Google Talk
Personalizing Your Google Talk
Some people seek to express themselves through words, actions, and interpre-
tive dance, whereas others create their niche in the world through cus-
tomizing their Google Talk clients. I think we all know which group this
section is targeting. In keeping with Google Talk’s streamlined and simpliﬁed
feel, there are not many options to adjust the look and feel of the client, as
there are with other clients. Instead, the customization features are kept fairly
basic and focus on core impact items, such as avatars and themes.
www.syngress.com
78
Chapter 4 • Google Talk Usage

Avatars
Avatars have gained much popularity in the years since they were introduced
into instant-messenger applications. Google Talk allows you to choose from a
set of preselected images or introduce your own to share with friends.To
access this feature, simply click the image located to the right of your screen
name, as shown in Figure 4.18. From this menu, you may select the graphical
image that best represents yourself. But don’t hold yourself to just this set of
pictures.You are a unique and special individual, so use Google’s Image search
at http://images.google.com to locate a great image for yourself to import
into Google Talk.Through the avatar menu in Google Talk, select the option
More pictures… to open your personal picture directory and load a custom
image. Regardless of the size of the image you use, it will automatically be
resized down to a suitable image for the chat client.

Themes and Skins
As simplistic and elegant as the Google Talk appearance may be, it just might
not ﬁt the needs of all users. Some people like their IM clients to be as ﬂam-
boyant as their lifestyles. Fortunately, there are multiple themes within Google
Talk to choose from to change the overall look and style of the chatting
experience.
To select from available themes, click the link labeled Settings in the
upper-right corner of Google Talk. Many of the individual screens and set-
tings here are discussed later in this chapter, but for now you can click
Appearance to view available themes, as shown in Figure 4.19. Select a
theme from the pull-down menu to view an example of it. Once you’ve dis-
covered a theme to ﬁt your needs, press OK and it will be immediately
applied to the client.

Tools & Traps
Advanced Theme Management
If the default themes don’t ﬁt the bill, it is easy to modify these themes
or install new ones from the Internet. Themes are stored in C:\Documents
and Settings\%USER%\Local Settings\Application Data\Google\Google
Talk\themes\user\chat, where %USER% is your user account name. The
ﬁnal chat directory might not exist by default and could need to be cre-
ated to store your themes. From within this directory, themes can be mod-
iﬁed, added, or removed. Additional themes can be downloaded from the
Internet and unzipped into this directory, to be immediately available
from within Google Talk. To modify a theme, simply locate and edit the
Cascading Style Sheet document, main.css, within the particular theme’s
directory. More information on theme modiﬁcation can be found in
Chapter 5 of this book.
Conﬁguration Settings
Google Talk features basic conﬁguration settings to conﬁgure the client for a
particular computer in the instance that default settings are not desirable.
These settings can be accessed by clicking the link labeled Settings in the
upper-right corner of Google Talk. Once you’ve selected this link, the
Settings window will appear, as displayed in Figure 4.20.The settings are
broken into a number of main categories, displayed on the left side of the set-
tings window.

Figure 4.20 Google Talk General Settings
The General category displays basic conﬁguration settings for the Google

cally start Google Talk every time Windows loads.You also have the ability to
conﬁgure how your Friends List should be initially displayed. One particularly
useful feature on this screen is the check box for Open Gmail when I click
on email links.This feature, when enabled, allows you to use Gmail as the
default e-mail client on your computer, intercepting all mailto: links found
within Web pages.Additionally, you can change the default font style and size
by clicking the box labeled Change Font….The box labeled Google
Account Settings will take you to your Google Account Manager, where
you can change your Google information, such as your password and security
settings.The box labeled Enable diagnostic logging places Google Talk
into a troubleshooting mode for sending reports to Google’s support staff,
which will include personal identifying information about you and your
computer.As detailed within the application, this option should be selected
only if prompted to by Google’s staff. Otherwise, you might ﬁnd Google’s
elite Ninja henchmen knocking on your door. Well, maybe not, but is it really
worth tempting fate?

Chapter 4 • Google Talk Usage

The Chat category provides a very simpliﬁed selection to allow you the
option of saving your chat history in your Gmail account, as shown in Figure
4.21. By default, all your chat conversations will be logged to your Gmail chat
for you to retrieve at a later time.This setting can be disabled on the ﬂy by
using the “off the record” option, as described earlier in this chapter, but the
selection here allows you to permanently disable logging.This is only useful
for the truly paranoid among us.You know who you are.
Figure 4.21 Google Talk Chat Settings
The Blocked category allows you to view all the “friends” that you have
blocked in your account, as shown in Figure 4.22.These contacts will not be
able to send you messages or calls as long as they are on this block list. So, did
you ﬁnally make up with your rich, Nigerian widow friend and work things
out? Select her name here and click Unblock to remove her from the list.

The Notiﬁcations category allows you to enable particular events you
want to be notiﬁed of, as shown in Figure 4.23. From within this window
you can enable or disable the display of incoming calls and chats. For each,
you can specify whether you want a distinct sound to be played and a
window to appear notifying you. Google Talk also has the ability to monitor
your Gmail account for new e-mails and will display a short segment of these
messages in a popup window.

The Connection category allows you to modify the way your machine
connects to the Google server, as shown in Figure 4.24. From within this
screen, you are able to conﬁgure Google Talk to use a proxy server to connect
to Google.A proxy server is a third-party server on the Internet that takes
your trafﬁc and relays it to your intended target.This is useful if the target is
blocked from within your network environment. We’ll look into this in more
depth and show you how to route your trafﬁc through various anonymous,
even encrypted services, in a later chapter.
Figure 4.24 Google Talk Connection Settings
The Audio category allows you to modify the audio settings for Google
Talk, as shown in Figure 4.25. From this menu you can specify which device
should handle audio input, if you have multiple microphones in your com-
puter.You can also adjust the audio output settings, which includes setting the
devices that should be used to signal notiﬁcations. By default, this feature will
send output to all audio devices attached to your computer, but you can limit
it to a particular device.You can also choose a particular device to which
voice communications should be routed by selecting a device for Calls.A
checkbox is also allocated to unmute your speaker when a voice call is
incoming, allowing the ring to be temporarily played before the computer is
again muted.Additional options allow you to unmute both the speaker and
your microphone during the course of a phone call. When this option is
www.syngress.com
Google Talk Usage • Chapter 4
85

checked, your computer, if muted, will be unmated for the duration of the
call. Once the communication has been ended, the computer will be muted
once again.
Figure 4.25 Google Talk Audio Settings
Additionally, in this window you can opt into Google’s Music Trends cat-
alog.As discussed earlier in this chapter, Google Music Trends will record the
name of every song that you listen to on your computer.This information
will be cataloged anonymously to determine the most popular songs heard
across the world by Google Talk users. However, by opting into Music Trends,
you will also be choosing to enable Google’s Personalized Search, a function
that concerns privacy advocates.

Chapter 4 • Google Talk Usage

Notes from the Underground
The Hidden Dangers of Google Personalized Search
Google’s Personalized Search (see Figure 4.26), when enabled with Music
Trends, will log every song that you play and at the date and time you play
it. It will also log every Google Web search you perform, as shown in
Figure 4.26, as well all your Google Image and Froogle searches. Although
these items can be removed at a later time, many users feel uncomfort-
able with Google storing this information and might want to opt out.
Your searches will be transmitted from any computer in which you are
logged into Google and will be stored permanently on Google’s servers
until they are manually erased. As a user, you can log in to view your
search history by visiting www.google.com/psearch, and you can select to
remove selected entries or the entire collection. You are also given the
option to pause the recording of data for a temporary period and resume
logging information later. Advertised under the guise of allowing searches
to be customized based on earlier searching attempts, this function is a
feature that some folks might want to avoid, especially if they perform
searches that they’d like to keep secret.

Summary
While Google Talk was designed to be picked up and immediately familiar to
most users, it is important to highlight the features that it provides. The client
was designed to integrate seamlessly with Google Mail, and this is shown the
ﬁrst time you start up the client. Your contact list will immediately be popu-
lated with all of your friends and family that talk to you through Gmail. You
can then easily click on each name and send invitations to them to join you
on Google Talk. Your Gmail friends can immediately start using Google Talk
to converse with you, while your non-Google friends will be sent a Gmail
invitation.
When communicating with your friends, you can fall back on normal text
messages through the Google Talk service, or take advantage of their voice
communication abilities. While in the middle of a chat just click the Call
button to create a voice connection with your friend though your computer.
If they’re not available, that’s OK. Google Talk gives you the ability to leave
them a voice mail in their Gmail account. Like most other clients, you can
also send ﬁles back and forth between your friends.
Like other clients, you can also set various status messages for you
account, with multiple options for being either “available” or “away”. Along
with standard messages, you can choose a custom message or even have
Google Talk display the current song that you’re listening to. The client can
read from a large number of music software, including iTunes, Winamp, and
Windows Media Player, to determine this. Additionally, Google Talk gives
you the ability to anonymously submit your music listening habits to Google’s
Music Trends site.
All of your text chats with your friends will automatically be stored on
Google’s server in your Gmail account, where you can access it from any-
where in the world at any time. If you in a situation where you wouldn’t like
to have your chat logged, Google Talk gives you the option to go “off the
record”, forcing both clients to not log the conversation.
To help personalize your account and your client, the Google Talk client
allows you to add a graphical avatar to represent yourself. This can be chosen
from a selection of pre-set images, or you can upload your own.

Making Google Talk Yours
By now, you’ve undoubtedly installed and had plenty of hands-on time with
Google Talk. You’re probably busy ﬁnding new friends and contacting old
ones to share in your new found happiness. But, wait; it doesn’t end there!
The one problem with a client as sleek and beautiful as Google Talk is that it
looks the same as everyone else’s. It’s like living in a town where everyone
drives a red Corvette!  But, if you’re the type of person who wants to be
unique, we have the perfect solutions for you. In this chapter, we will be
covering some very cool modiﬁcations that you can make to your Google
Talk client, as well as some additional fun actions that you can perform.
GT-Plug
Google Talk prides itself on its simplicity and basic interface, but one Brazilian
programmer has given the client more ﬂair with his creation of GT-Plug. GT-
Plug gives you the ability to display real, graphical emoticons (smiley faces) in
your chat windows, apply transparency to Google Talk, save conversations to
local text ﬁles, and toggle a Boss Key mode.The program can be downloaded
from www.projetobms.net/GTPlug.php?pagina=pj&lang=en and installs
through a basic setup executable.
After it’s installed, you must launch Google Talk through the GT-Plug
application. Run GT-Plug by selecting it from your Windows Start menu.
GT-Plug operates by automatically running the normal Google Talk applica-
tion and modifying its operations on the ﬂy.Therefore, if you usually run
Google Talk manually, GT-Plug will not be loaded.The downside to this is
that as Google Talk is updated, portions of GT-Plug could stop functioning or
cause instability issues, as shown in Figure 5.1. Currently, a number of these
functions do not work at all until the GT-Plug is updated to adapt to the
newer Google Talk versions.
Figure 5.1 Google Talk Crash Caused by GT-Plug 
94
Chapter 5 • Google Talk Add-ons and Modiﬁcations
www.syngress.com

Once you have installed GT-Plug and have launched it from the Start
menu, you will see the usual Google Talk screen.To see the changes that
accompany the application, click the Settings button to view the client set-
tings. One unfortunate side effect with modern versions of Google Talk is
that the actual GT-Plug conﬁguration menu is hidden from view.You can still
locate it by clicking the blank area immediately below the word
Appearance.This will bring up the GT-Plug conﬁguration menu, as shown
in Figure 5.2. Here you have the ability to toggle each of the settings of the
application and apply changes to the way the settings operate.
Figure 5.2 GT-Plug Conﬁguration Menu
One of the default options enabled in GT-Plug is the displaying of graph-
ical emoticons in your chat windows.This effect is immediately noticed as
soon as you open a chat window, where you’ll see a smiley face at the bottom
left of your screen. Clicking this graphical face will drop down a list of the
emoticons that GT-Plug will display on your screen, as shown in Figure 5.3.
The chat windows from both sides of the conversation are shown, and you
www.syngress.com
Google Talk Add-ons and Modiﬁcations • Chapter 5
95

can see how the normal emoticons with the standard Google Talk on the left
are transformed into vibrant graphics with the GT-Plug client.The drop-
down menu of smiley faces can also be accessed to input the appropriate
smiley faces directly into your messages as you are typing them.
Figure 5.3 Viewing Emoticons With GT-Plug 
GT-Plug also gives you the ability to assign a “boss key” to Google Talk,
allowing you to quickly hide the client from the screen at a moment’s notice.
Boss keys have long been a part of the computing world, especially in games
and other entertainment software, to give users the ability to hide their soft-
ware use from their bosses, spouses, and children. While you might think that
a quick Alt + Tab combination would hide Google Talk, it still leaves a tell-
tale icon in your system tray. GT-Plug takes care of that problem by replacing
the system tray icon with a new one, as shown in Figure 5.4.There are cur-
rently issues with GT-Plug and the most recent versions of Google Talk,
though, where using the boss key could crash Google Talk, displaying the
error message shown in Figure 5.1.

Chapter 5 • Google Talk Add-ons and Modiﬁcations

Figure 5.4 Conﬁguring GT-Plug’s Boss Key
In the previous chapter we discussed how all of your chat conversations
are automatically stored on Google’s servers. This is an extremely useful fea-
ture for traveling absent-minded professor types, as your conversations can be
brought up at any time from anywhere in the world. However, for those of
you who like to store your chat logs locally, there is a feature within GT-Plug
to allow this. From the GT-Plug conﬁguration menu, you can enable the
saving of conversation logs, and specify where you would like to save them to,
as shown in Figure 5.5. By default, these logs will be stored in “C:\Program
Files\GT-Plug\My conversations”, though you can change this setting to any
directory you wish.
Figure 5.5 Conﬁguring GT-Plug’s Conversation Log Repository 
In the last few years, transparent windows have become a cool feature in
many programs.A large number of applications use this feature to allow you
www.syngress.com
Google Talk Add-ons and Modiﬁcations • Chapter 5
97

to view through their windows into background data, increasing your mon-
itor real estate. From within the GT-Plug conﬁguration menu, you can enable
this feature and set the visibility level of the window transparency, as shown in
Figure 5.6.
Figure 5.6 Conﬁguring GT-Plug’s Transparency Level
Finding the right amount of transparency can take practice and exercise,
and it changes depending on the type of information shown on your screen.
Unfortunately, many people who play with this feature end up disabling it
because they initially set it at a value too low to be readable. In most situa-
tions, you shouldn’t set your visibility below 80 percent.An example of
Google Talk at 80 percent visible is shown in Figure 5.7.
Along with these numerous features, GT-Plug also gives you some addi-
tional features from the Windows system tray. One of these is the ability to
change your account’s status on the ﬂy by simply right-clicking the Google
Talk icon. From here, you can choose from a preset list of status messages, as
shown in Figure 5.8.

Extended Talk
Although GT-Plug offers additional features not found in the original client,
there is another team that has decided to up the ante and make a very fea-
ture-rich addition, called Extended Talk. It is currently one of the most useful
add-ons that you can download for Google Talk.This excellent addition can
be downloaded from http://extendedtalk.meosoft.net as a simple setup exe-
cutable.
Extended Talk introduces a large number of modiﬁcations and additions,
such as:
■
Active Status A dynamic, scriptable online status system.
■
Graphical Smiley Faces  Replaces the drab text smilies with large
graphical ones.
■
Desktop Friends Lets you dock your favorite friends on the
desktop for quick chatting.
■
Boss Key One set of keystrokes to instantly hide all your Google
Talk windows when the boss walks by your ofﬁce.
■
Keyboard Lock Prevents text from being typed into your Google
Talk windows, for when you need to step away for a bit.
■
Text Color Changer Changes the font colors of received messages.
■
Leet-speak Text Translation Changes all your text to L337 speak
on the ﬂy.
■
Windows Transparency Makes your Google Talk windows trans-
parent.
Once Extended Talk is installed and executed, you will be given the
ability to change many of its general options, as shown in Figure 5.9. From
here you can choose whether or not to enable some of the more prominent
aesthetic features in the application.

Beginning with the menu inside the chat window, you’ll ﬁnd a slew of
items under the Chat Features menu that deal with how the chat window,
and text within it, is displayed. From here you can change the transparency
level of that particular chat window, change the background colors of both
the typing ﬁeld and the message window, change the color of the received
text, and implement typing ﬁlters.
The typing are letter translations features that turn your regular speech
into elite “31337” speak or ©ØØ£ (“cool”) speak. To see how this affects
what you type, consider the following popular phrase in all three forms:
Normal: The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog
1337: Th3 quick br0wn f0x jump5 0v3r 7h3 14zy d06
©ØØ£: THË ¶µÎ©k ß®ØwÑ ƒØ? jµm?§ ØvË® tHË £Àz¥ ?ØG
Some of the more advanced features are found under (you guessed it) the
Advanced menu. From here you can manage your Active Status scripts,
create desktop friends, and reference custom graphic images that can be
shared with other Extended Talk users.
The Active Status manager is a unique feature found within Extended
Talk that allows you to create dynamic status messages to be shown to all of
your friends. Active status is similar to the current song display in Google
Talk, but Active Status allows you to display a plethora of different items. To
view an example of its capabilities, start the Active Status manager. Click the
button labeled “Load” and select “C:\Program Files\Extended
Talk\Plugins\SamplePlugin.et” to populate the ﬁelds, as shown in Figure
5.11. The upper portion of the screen shows the information and options
stored within the script, with the bottom portion showing what will be
placed within your Google Talk status. Once you’ve loaded an Active Status
script, you should see individual items show up in the “Functions” box.
These are the actual items that can be displayed within your status. Double-
clicking on an item from here will add it to the “Your Status” ﬁeld at the
bottom. When you have ﬁnished selecting your status items, click the button
labeled “Set”. As you can see in Figure 5.11, setting the status to show the
clock updates the status line to read the actual local time,“11:15 PM” (a
wonderfully creative time for a die-hard author). To create your own scripts,
it is best to use the existing SamplePlugin.et ﬁle as a template for modiﬁca-

tion. Refer to the Active Status Help item that exists within your Windows
Start Menu for more help.
Figure 5.11 The Active Status Manager
One other unique feature within Extended Talk is the ability to create
“desktop friends.”These are icons that show up on your desktop that repre-
sent the friends you most often talk to. If you want to shoot off a quick mes-
sage to a mate, instead of wading through your Google Talk contact list, you
can just double-click your friend’s desktop icon, as shown in Figure 5.12.
These icons can be stretched and moved around your screen, where they
dock against the edges and each other.The color schemes can be modiﬁed
and even replaced by your own graphic images, by simply right-clicking the
icon you want to change and choosing the appropriate selections.

Besides the options built into the client, you can make additional changes
by editing many of the ﬁles that come bundled with Extended Talk. For
instance, if you want to change the graphical smilies, you can simply replace
the appropriate ﬁles within C:\Program Files\Extended Talk\Images\Smileys,
where each smiley image is stored in its own ﬁle.
Creating Your Own Theme
As we discussed in Chapter 4, the Google Talk client includes a wide variety
of colorful themes that can be applied to your individual chat windows.The
process is fairly technical and requires that you have a basic understanding of
Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) and cascading style sheets (CSS), two
fundamental technologies used to create modern Web sites.
The expected page-count of this book won’t support a discussion of
HTML and CSS, but we will attempt to walk through the ﬁles and explain
what the ﬁelds mean and how to edit them. Editing the themes inside
Google Talk involve simply editing text documents, so there is no need for
specialized tools or software. Windows notepad will prove capable enough
for all of the work we’ll be doing.
Creating the Necessary Files
To implement a new theme, there are a number of required ﬁles that control
how the theme is laid out and applied.Although these ﬁles can be generated
from scratch, it will be easier to use an existing theme as a template and copy
over its ﬁles.The base ﬁles needed are shown in Figure 5.13.This branch of
directories is located off your C:\Documents and Settings\<username>\
www.syngress.com

Local Settings\Application Data\Google\Google Talk\themes\user\ directory.
So, the Main.css ﬁle for a theme named PHP would be located at

Data\Google\Google

Altering Message Displays 
The actual information that appears within a text window is broken into
three distinct categories: incoming messages, outgoing messages, and status
messages. Each category has a pair of text ﬁles that output information to the
screen. Each of these ﬁles is called on to handle the display of messages in
particular situations.The ﬁrst time that you receive an incoming message, the
Incoming\Content.html ﬁle will be displayed. For every further uninter-
rupted incoming message, the Incoming\ContentNext.html will be pro-
cessed.As soon as the message chain is broken by either a status change or an
outgoing message, it starts over with Incoming\Content.html. Consider the
string of messages shown in Table 5.1 to see what ﬁles are accessed during the
chat session.

Brian: Hey man, are you around?

Brian: I have a question for you.

Brian: I have a favor to ask …

Status.html
Roy: Need more money?
Incoming\Content.html
Roy: Cause you still owe me 
Incoming\ContentNext.html
from yesterday!
Brian: Yeah :(
Outgoing\Content.html
These ﬁles contain basic HTML text that outlines the display of informa-
tion.Although most of the content stays static, it does utilize two variables:
%sender% and %message%. The %sender% variable contains the screen name
of the sender of the message, whereas %message% contains the message itself.
Each ﬁle relies heavily on HTML DIV and SPAN tags and their respec-
tive CSS coding. For those of you not familiar with DIV and SPAN, they are
simply methods to divide off a blocks of text separately from the rest of a
page.The DIV tag is used to designate an entire block of information,
whereas the SPAN tag normally refers to a string of in-line text within that
block.These tags allow for certain areas of text, or certain words, to be modi-
ﬁed apart from the rest of the data. In the world of Google Talk, each chat
message is broken out as a DIV block. Within this block, you can specify
multiple SPANs for individual words or lines. Whenever a DIV or SPAN is
called, it is normally associated with a particular “class.” Classes are CSS-
deﬁned content that speciﬁes how text should be marked, with different
colors, font styles, or sizes.
Incoming\Content.html
The Incoming\Content.html ﬁle details the information to be displayed
when you ﬁrst receive a block of messages from a friend.
www.syngress.com
Google Talk Add-ons and Modiﬁcations • Chapter 5
107

The following is an example of the Incoming\Content.html from the
PHP theme:
<div class='chat in'>
<span class="blue">&lt;?php</span>
<div class='msg 1st'>
<span class="blue">$%sender%</span>&nbsp;
<span class="green">=</span>&nbsp;
<span class="red">'%message%'</span>
<span class="green">;</span>
</div>
<div id='insert'></div>
<span class="blue">?&gt;</span>
</div>
In this ﬁle there is a general <div> for the incoming chat, which is
deﬁned by the “chat in” class. Within this is the ﬁrst line of text, colored blue,
that writes <?php.Another <div> is created for the actual message received.
The ﬁrst set of text is $%sender% in blue, followed by a space, a green equals
sign, and the actual message in red.
Immediately following this is a <div id=’insert’> that references where all
further incoming messages should be displayed, using
Incoming\NextContent.html.The last part of the content is a third line that
writes >;, the typical closing to PHP code.This last span comment is a footer
that will not be printed until Google Talk senses that the communication ses-
sion has ended, such as when the other person responds or changes his or her
status. In practice, this will cause a message to appear as:
<?php
$Brian = 'Hello, World!'
>;
Incoming\NextContent.html
The Incoming\NextContent.html ﬁle is used for additional messages received
from a friend. It is referenced any time a friend sends a series of messages,
without interruption, to your client.The following is an example of the
Incoming\NextContent.html from the PHP theme:
www.syngress.com
108
Chapter 5 • Google Talk Add-ons and Modiﬁcations

<div class='msg Nth'>
<span class="orange">
// add to the incoming user's message</span><br>
<span class="blue">$%sender%</span>&nbsp;
<span class="green">=</span>&nbsp;
<span class="blue">$%sender%.</span>
<span class="red">'%message%'</span>
<span class="green">;</span>
</div>
<div id='insert'></div>
This ﬁle is structured very similarly to the Incoming\Content.html ﬁle in
that it will display the sender’s name and message. However, it has been modi-
ﬁed to be appended onto the previous text received from your friend. In
practice, this will cause a message to appear as:
// add to the incoming user's message
$Brian = $Brian.'Are you there?';
Outgoing\Content.html
The Outgoing\Content.html ﬁle details the information to be displayed the
ﬁrst time that you send a message to a friend. Similar to the
Incoming\Content.html ﬁle, it is used only for the initial message in a string
of messages and doesn’t get accessed again until the text is interrupted by a
status change or someone else’s conversation. The following is an example of
the Outgoing\Content.html from the PHP theme:
<div class='chat out'>
<span class="blue">&lt;?php</span>
<div class='msg 1st'>
<span class="blue">$%sender%</span>&nbsp;
<span class="green">=</span>&nbsp;
<span class="red">'%message%'</span>
<span class="green">;</span>
</div>
<div id='insert'></div>
<span class="blue">?&gt;</span>
</div>
www.syngress.com
Google Talk Add-ons and Modiﬁcations • Chapter 5
109

This message is constructed nearly identically to the Incoming\Content.html
ﬁle, since it displays information in the exact same way.The only major differ-
ence is that the class referenced by the <div> is “chat out.” When in use, this
ﬁle will make messages appear as:
<?php
$World = 'I'm sleeping...';
?>
Outgoing\NextContent.html
The Outgoing\NextContent.html ﬁle is used for additional messages received
from a friend. It is used when you are sending repeated messages to a friend.
The following is an example of the Incoming\NextContent.html from the
PHP theme:
<div class='msg Nth'>
<span class="orange">// add to the outgoing message </span><br>
<span class="blue">$%sender%</span>&nbsp;
<span class="green">.=</span>&nbsp;
<span class="red">'%message%'</span>
<span class="green">;</span>
</div>
<div id='insert'></div>
This ﬁle is structured very similarly to the Incoming\Content.html in that it
will display the sender’s name and message. However, it has been modiﬁed to
be appended onto the previous text received from your friend. In practice,
this will cause a message to appear as:
// add to the outgoing message
$World = $World.'Go away!';

Chapter 5 • Google Talk Add-ons and Modiﬁcations

Status.html
The Status.html ﬁle deﬁnes the text displayed when a status message appears
in the chat room, such as when a person’s online status changes or when a
time stamp appears.The following is an example of the Status.html from the
PHP theme:
<div class='system1st' style='color:%color%'><b>Fatal
error</b>:&nbsp;&nbsp;%message% in <b>/googletalk/usr/action.php</b> on line
<b>4</b></div>
<div id="insert"></div>
This ﬁle is created differently from the text messages because it is simply
used to display a single status line to the screen and normally doesn’t need to
be concerned with series of status changes. When used, it will cause a message
to appear as:
Fatal error:
Sent at 9:49 PM on Sunday in /googletalk/usr/action.php on
line 4
NextStatus.html
The NextStatus.html ﬁle is used for displaying a series of status changes. It is
referenced only when you’ve received multiple status messages, one after
another.The following is an example of the NextStatus.html from the PHP
theme:
<div class='systemNth' style='color:%color%'><b>Parse
error</b>:&nbsp;&nbsp;%message% in <b>/googletalk/usr/action.php</b> on line
<b>17</b></div>
<div id="insert"></div>
When used, this theme ﬁle will cause further status messages to appear
similar to:
Parse error:
Calling Brian at 2:14 PM on Saturday in
/googletalk/usr/action.php on line 17

Primary CSS Data
The Main.css ﬁle is used to store all the CSS information for the way text
should appear within your chat windows.The information contained here is
used to create shortcuts for text styling, such as being able to easily deﬁne
color schemes. In the CSS ﬁle contained within the theme, the classes
referred from the message HTML ﬁles discussed previously are contained,
along with the text styling that they implement.The following is an example
of the Main.css from the PHP theme:
BODY { margin: 4px; }
DIV#content { font: 12px courier new; }
DIV#insert { display: none; }
DIV.system1st {
margin: 4px 0px 4px 0px;
font: 12px arial;
}
DIV.systemNth {
margin: 4px 0px 4px 0px;
font: 12px arial;
}
DIV.chat DIV.msg {
margin: 4px 0px 0px 0px;
padding-left: 11px;
}
DIV.chat DIV.1st { text-indent: -11px; }
.blue { color: #0000BB; }
.green { color: #007700 ; }
.red { color: #dd0000; }
.orange { color: #ff8000; }

Notes From the Underground…
Google Talk Theme Exploitation
In the realm of theme creation, the Google team has placed one highly
controversial feature into their client: support for HTML and JavaScript.
From within any of the HTML ﬁles in a theme, JavaScript can be added to
create additional functionality to normally drab themes. The ﬁrst imple-
mentation of this was created by Anthony Sottile to automatically replace
text emoticons with graphical smiley faces. A portion of the code he used
is shown here:
<div id='insert'></div>
<img src="images/smile.png" width="1" height="1"
style="display:none;" onload="
var asdf = document.getElementById('message').parentNode.innerHTML;
asdf = asdf.replace(/onload/g, 'onclick'); asdf =
asdf.replace(/id=message/g, 'id=asdf');
asdf= asdf.replace(/>:\)</g, '><img src=images/smile.png
style=display:inline;><');
asdf= asdf.replace(/>:\(</g, '><img src=images/sad.png
style=display:inline;><');
document.getElementById('message').parentNode.innerHTML=asdf;">
Additionally, this idea to take text and replace it with other text is
limited only by your imagination. Future advertisers could even take
advantage of this text with links to ad-based Web sites, as with the fol-
lowing line of code:
asdf= asdf.replace(/google/, '<a
href=http://search.msn.com>google</a>');
Reach Out and Touch Someone
Google Talk does a great job of providing text and voice communication
between users, but there is always room to push for more. In this case, why
limit ourselves to ordinary voice conversations with other Google Talk users?

That is so 20th century! Let’s jazz it up a bit with videoconferencing abilities,
a feature found in most other IM clients.And let’s not stop there. How about
making telephone calls to your friends and family from your computer, just
like you can with Skype! 
Surprise Mom With a Call From Google Talk
We’ve all been there: vacationing in Bermuda, sipping drinks on the beach,
when we suddenly get an urge to call mom to check up on her day. But the
price of a phone call to the States is outrageously high. So what are you to
do? Simple: Fire up the laptop and call Mom through Google Talk! A number
of services are available to take your Google Talk chat and connect it to a land
line as VoIP.Although these calls are not free, they are priced far more cheaply
than toll calls and foreign exchanges.
VoIP Over Talqer
One such service is Talqer, located at www.talqer.com.Talqer is an extremely
easy-to-use application that can either be run by itself or integrated into
Google Talk to allow you to make phone calls to regular cellular and land
phones from your computer.The rates are extremely reasonable at only pen-
nies per minute, and no VAT fees are charged for European callers.Talqer
itself is a standalone VoIP service, so your trafﬁc does not ﬂow through the
Google Talk network.
After you download and install Talqer from its Web site, it can be launched
directly from your Windows Start menu.You will be prompted with a screen,
shown in Figure 5.15, to enter your Talqer username and password. If you do
not have an account, simply click the link labeled Sign Up for Talqer to be
taken to the Talqer site, where you can register for one for free.

Figure 5.15 Talqer’s Initial Screen
After logging into your account, you will be taken to the Talqer main
screen, as shown in Figure 5.16.This is your main interface to making calls on
the Internet, but you will notice that it features a very basic setup with few
buttons, since the client itself is extremely easy to use.You can prepay your
account balance using a variety of purchasing options by simply clicking the
appropriate payment type on the screen.
Figure 5.16 Talqer’s Main Screen

The central portion of the window contains a row of icons and a ﬁeld in
which you can type the phone number that you want to call.There are
appropriate icons to connect the call and to disconnect, as well as icons to
display a dialing pad, a history of calls (Figure 5.17), and your personal phone
book.
Figure 5.17 Talqer Call History
To conﬁgure Talqer for your hardware, click the icon of a wrench located
at the top of the window to open the conﬁguration window. From here you
can alter a variety of Talqer features and even import your phone book from a
comma-delimited CSV ﬁle.You can also conﬁgure a custom ringtone for
incoming calls. Of particular usefulness are the audio settings, shown in Figure
5.18. From here you specify the device you want to use for the microphone
and the device that should handle the audio output. By default, this setting
will use the same values as the Google Talk client.
To place a phone call, simply type in the phone number that you want to
dial, and select the green icon to place the call, as shown in Figure 5.19.
While the call is taking place, you can alter both the microphone and speaker
output on the ﬂy, using the appropriate sliders at the bottom of the window.
When you have ﬁnished your conversation, simply click the red “hang up”
icon to terminate the call.

Notes From the Underground…
But How Does It Sound?
As someone who has used many online voice applications over the years,
I can understand the frustration of users who have had their hopes
crushed by static, dropped packets, and low-quality codecs. However,
since Talqer takes advantage of the SIP VoIP protocol, it has a much higher
level of quality than what is built into most IM clients. Talqer’s voice
quality is at least as clear as that you would experience through a normal
telephone.
All this work so far has been performed through the Talqer standalone
client, which looks remarkably like the Google Talk client. However, you can
do all your dialing directly from the Google Talk client, as shown in Figure
5.20.The icons to call and hang up will be displayed in the Google Talk
client.All you need to do is type the phone number you want to dial into the
search bar, and press the call button.

Although Talqer is a capable VoIP service, it does require a software download
and conﬁguration, which could prove difﬁcult for many users. If you are
looking for a VoIP solution that even your Luddite grandparents could under-
stand, with the same great features and cheap prices, then look no further
than GTalk-To-VoIP.

Chapter 5 • Google Talk Add-ons and Modiﬁcations

GTalk-To-VoIP, abbreviated to GTalk2VoIP, is a telephone service that
fully embeds itself into the Google Talk experience through a custom-written
automated bot server.As a VoIP service, it can ﬁnd all the global VoIP
providers willing to carry your call across the world. For each call you make,
the providers are queried to ﬁnd the cheapest rate, which is then applied to
your call.
Signing up for the server is effortless. Simply add the user
service@gtalk2voip.com to your contact list, and you’re done! Alternatively,
you can visit the Web site at www.gtalk2voip.com and enter your Google Talk
account to have the bot ask to be added to your list, as shown in Figure 5.21.
This method is especially useful if you want to add the service to the clients of
your family members, since you can just enter their Google Talk accounts for
them, and all they need to do is accept the transaction.
Figure 5.21 Adding the Bot to Your Contact List
To operate the service, simply open a chat session with the
service@gtalk2voip.com user and specify the command you’d like to perform.
A list of compatible options is available by typing in help.This list of available
commands includes:

Can You See Me Now? Good!
While text chat and even voice communications have become par for the
course, there is one area left that not many instant messaging clients have ven-
tured into: video conferencing. While the ofﬁcial Google Talk client does not
yet support video conferencing, there is a fun plug-in called festoon that pro-
vides this capability, and more. Festoon can be found at www.festooninc.com.
Festoon is a video conferencing application that operates separately from
Google Talk, but uses the Google Talk client to establish connections between
you and your friends. It is an excellent resource for audio conversations, video
conferencing, software presentations, and creating fun videos for your friends.
Unfortunately, Festoon is only available for computers running Windows XP
and Windows 2000, so your Mac and Linux friends will be unable to play. See
Appendices A and B for more on video conferencing.
www.syngress.com

Chapter 5 • Google Talk Add-ons and Modiﬁcations

To use Festoon, simply run the application from your Windows Start
menu.Additionally, you will also notice the Festoon icon in both your
Windows system tray and in the upper portion of the Google Talk client, as
shown in Figure 5.24. Clicking any of these icons will launch the Festoon
client software.
Figure 5.24 The Festoon Icon in Your Google Talk Client
When you launch Festoon, a window will appear to start the videoconfer-
ence, as shown in Figure 5.25. From here you can give your videoconference
a unique name and input your Google Talk account information.You must
enter your Google Talk information to send conference invitations to your
friends. Once you’ve entered all the information, click the Sign In button to
have Festoon log into the Google Talk network as you.
Once Festoon has used your information to log into the network, it will
gather a list of all your friends from your contact list, as well as their current
online status. From this list, you can select each of your friends who you
would like to invite into the conference. Once you’ve selected all the people
you want to join, click the button labeled Start Call, as shown on Figure
5.26, to launch the Festoon videoconference session.

product, it will notify you that your friends must install the Festoon client to
take part in the conference.You will be given the option of automatically
sending messages to your friends who do not have the client, such as the one
shown in Figure 5.27.
Figure 5.27 Inviting Friends to Use Festoon
All your invited friends who already have the Festoon client installed will
receive an invitation to join you in your video call, like the one shown in
Figure 5.28.Your speciﬁc conference will be assigned a unique key value,
which is included in the URL shared with your friends.
Figure 5.28 A Festoon Invitation to Videoconference
Once your friend clicks the link sent to her in the chat window, she will
be taken to Festoon’s Web site in her default Web browser, as shown in Figure
5.29. From here she will be given the choice to download the client, if she

doesn’t already have it installed. She will also be given the choice to join your
videoconference by clicking the button labeled Join the call.
Figure 5.29 Joining a Festoon Videoconference
Since the Festoon client runs independently, you will receive some sort of
warning that an external application will be opened, similar to the one shown
by Mozilla Firefox in Figure 5.30. Since we want this call to go through and
we initiated the execution, click the Launch application button to continue
loading Festoon.

Chapter 5 • Google Talk Add-ons and Modiﬁcations

Once Festoon has been loaded, you will see the main display window,
similar to the one shown in Figure 5.31. From this window you will be able
to see a window for each person in the videoconference, each showing the
camera feed from his or her computer. Below each video window is the
Google Talk screen name of the person shown.At the bottom of your
window, in a signiﬁcantly smaller screen, is the feed from your own camera, so
that you can see how you look to others.
Your friends without their own computer cameras aren’t left out, though;
they can still join the videoconference. Even though they won’t be able to
project a video signal, they can still talk in the conference and see the video
feeds from everyone else’s computer.
At this point you can speak and wave your hands crazily as your image is
broadcast across the Internet to all your friends. From the bottom of the
window you do have a bit of control over your conference; you can mute the
video signal and the audio signals individually.You can also invite additional
people to join the conference. When you are ﬁnished with your video call,
simply close the window to leave the conversation.

Fun and Games with Festoon
While most people are used to normal videoconferencing, it can end up
being a bit drab. Festoon has helped this problem with a number of fun fea-
tures they label EyeCandy. By accessing the EyeCandy menu at the top of
the screen, you can alter the video feed from your computer in a wide variety
of ways. From funhouse mirror effects to kaleidoscope effects from a hippie’s
drug-induced fantasy, you have a number of ways to spice up Festoon’s video.
One of the more popular features, though, is the cut-out images that you
can impose over your video feed.These cut-outs are images of actual people
with the faces cut out, allowing you to insert your face on their bodies, as
shown in Figure 5.32. It does take a fair bit of practice to place your face at
the exact distance and angle to ﬁt the image and to talk without moving your
body, but the effect is often amusing for your friends who are watching.

Chapter 5 • Google Talk Add-ons and Modiﬁcations

Using Festoon as a Business Tool
Although eye candy has little merit in the business world, other features of
Festoon can come in quite handy: while in a videoconference, you can select
to share out a particular application running on your computer. This will
open up a window on the screens of you friends where they will see the
chosen application, at full size, as if they were at the computer itself. The
others in the conference will not be able to manipulate the application, only
watch as you control it from your end, while you continue transmitting
audio. In the example shown in Figure 5.33, a Mozilla Firefox screen of a
website is being displayed across the Internet. This feature is very useful for
telecommuters, as they can conference into work, and display the actual work
that they are performing at home (as opposed to the fun stuff they’re really
doing as shown in Figure 5.33). It can also be used for distance learning, as
you can demonstrate how an application functions from across the internet,
while providing audio instruction.

Sex Change in a Download
Ever since the dawn of voice communications there has been another
growing market of technology: the ability to disguise your voice.There are
many reasons to want to disguise your voice, especially in the days before
Caller ID. For some it’s a matter or ducking out of calls from parents or pre-
tending to be a 14-year-old making prank calls.Actual telephone voice mod-
ulators can be expensive hardware, but there are many inexpensive solutions
for changing your voice through a computer. One such application is
MorphVOX by Screaming Bee, located at
www.screamingbee.com/product/MorphVOXJunior.aspx.MorphVOX is a
commercial product, but there is a Junior edition available for free download.
It is limited to only three voices—Male, Female, and Tiny Voices—but it gives
a taste of what the software is capable of performing.
Once you’ve installed and are running MorphVOX Jr., you will see the
main application window, like the one shown in Figure 5.34. From here you
can choose which voice modulation you’d prefer.The voice settings can be
changed on the ﬂy during your chat.There are also additional buttons for
Morph and Listen. When the morph button is lit, the voice modulation will
be applied to your voice.This allows you to immediately toggle whether you
want your natural voice or the synthesized one to be played.The Listen
button will route your voice back into your speakers, so that you can hear the
modulation effect.Additionally, there are a number of sound effects built into
the client that can be played at any time during your chat, for added comic
effect.
Using MorphVOX for your Google Talk audio communications is not
difﬁcult.To start, you need to tell MorphVOX where to pull an audio feed
from and where to pipe it to.This can be done by selecting the MorphVOX
| Preferences pull-down menu to view the application options. Click the
link for Device Settings to view the window shown in Figure 5.35. From
here, select the device the audio feed is coming from in the Microphone
ﬁeld; this will normally be your microphone device. For the Playback device,
choose your primary sound card.

Google Talk Add-ons and Modiﬁcations • Chapter 5
131

Once MorphVOX has been conﬁgured with the appropriate audio
devices, Google Talk needs to be conﬁgured to grab its audio from
MorphVOX and not directly from the microphone.This can be done by
viewing the Google Talk settings and clicking the Audio category. From here,
you can select the input device to be used for voice communications, as
shown in Figure 5.36. Select the device named Screaming Bee Audio
Driver to use MorphVOX as your audio input. Once this is set, initiate a
new phone call to a friend through Google Talk and you should hear your
voice altered dramatically.

With Google Talk using voice communications as a strong foundation, it’s
inevitable that someone would ﬁgure out how to transmit music through the
service.As it turns out, there are a number of ways to broadcast music to your
friends on Google Talk, some through modifying the Windows audio chan-
nels and others using third-party additions.
www.syngress.com
132
Chapter 5 • Google Talk Add-ons and Modiﬁcations

Quick-and-Dirty Broadcasting
The quickest method for broadcasting music, or any audio stream, to another
person on Google Talk is to manipulate the Windows audio channels to route
the audio output to Google Talk.Although this sounds difﬁcult, it’s really not.
This procedure is easily performed by following the steps documented on
www.customizetalk.com, a Google Talk modiﬁcation site.
The ﬁrst task is to ﬁnd your Audio Properties window, normally located
in the Windows Control Panel. From the Windows Start menu, choose
Settings | Control Panel to view the Control Panel. For most users, you
will see an icon labeled Sounds, Speech, and Audio Devices. Click this
icon, then locate the link labeled Advanced Volume Controls, usually
located in the upper-left portion of the screen. For users viewing the Control
Panel in “classic mode,” select the Sounds and Audio Devices icon and
click the button labeled Advanced….
After selecting the advanced controls, you will see a window showing a
mixing table of various audio sources. Select Options | Properties from the
pull-down menus at the top to display a window similar to Figure 5.37. Select
the Recording button to display all the different sources for recording audio.
In the ﬁeld shown at the bottom, ensure that the Wave Out Mix channel is
checked, and click OK.
Figure 5.37 Audio Properties Window
www.syngress.com
Google Talk Add-ons and Modiﬁcations • Chapter 5
133

You will then be shown the list of recording devices you checked in the
earlier screen, as shown in Figure 5.38. For each device there are separate bal-
ance and volume sliders as well as a Select check box telling Windows to use
that device for audio input. In nearly all cases, the microphone will be
selected as the default audio input device. Since the Google Talk client uses
whatever device you select here for transmitting audio to your friends, you
see that you could send a variety of feeds, even the output from whatever CD
you’re listening to.To send the output from an application such as iTunes or
Windows Media Player through Google Talk, simply click the box labeled
Select below the “Wave Out Mix” device slider.
Figure 5.38 Recording Devices Control Window
Once you’ve checked one of these two devices, open a chat window in
Google Talk and call a friend. Once the call is accepted, all the audio from
your computer will be directed to his computer.This is not just audio from
your music player, but all audio that you can hear on your speakers, including
error “dings.”You can transmit the audio from downloaded sound boards and
even your World of Warcraft game.
The downside to all this is that while you’re piping the audio out from
your computer, you will be unable to use your microphone to communicate
with your friends. If you want to switch back to the microphone, you will
www.syngress.com
134
Chapter 5 • Google Talk Add-ons and Modiﬁcations

have to open the volume controls again and switch the audio input back to
the microphone.This can be done on the ﬂy in the middle of a chat, though.
DJ’ing Through Mercora
Although going through the Windows setup and audio devices can allow you
to share your music playlist with your friends, it is not the most elegant
method. Luckily, there is an excellent alternative using Mercora IMRadio,
downloaded from www.mercora.com/gtalk/. Mercora is a client used to
create your own online radio station, where you can DJ your vast collection
of tunes. It operates separately from Google Talk, but it does use Google Talk
to invite friends to your radio station and to ﬁnd the stations of others.
After installing and running Mercora, you will be presented with a sign-
on screen, similar to the one shown in Figure 5.39. From here you can
choose your IM network of service, Google Talk. Enter your Google Talk e-
mail and account password to begin using Mercora IMRadio.
Figure 5.39 Mercora IMRadio’s Initial Screen
www.syngress.com
Google Talk Add-ons and Modiﬁcations • Chapter 5
135

Once IMRadio has logged into your account, it will create a list of all
your friends in your contact list, as shown in Figure 5.40.You can then invite
your friends from this list to download Mercora and listen to your radio sta-
tion. For your friends to be able to listen to your station, they must download
the IMRadio client on their own machines.
Figure 5.40 Importing Your Contact List in IMRadio
Mercora IMRadio is configured with a very easy-to-use interface, as
shown in Figure 5.41. From the left side of the screen you can select
between the major areas of the application, such as the music search, your
personal music library, your personal playlists, your radio stations, and all
your Mercora friends. IMRadio can also operate as a local music player,
playing your favorite music even while it is Webcasting another playlist on
your radio station.

Chapter 5 • Google Talk Add-ons and Modiﬁcations

Figure 5.41 The IMRadio Interface
For friends to listen to your radio station, they simply need to add you to
their clients using the Invite My Friends link under the My Friends
menu. Once your name is in their friend lists, they can click on it to view
personalized information about you as well as the song that you’re currently
playing, as shown in Figure 5.42.A quick click of the Listen link or the icon
represented by a pair of headphones will allow your friends to instantly con-
nect to your audio stream and listen to your station.
Google Talk Chat Rooms
A majority of instant-messaging trafﬁc is considered peer to peer, where mes-
sages ﬂow only from one person to another, but there is a deﬁnite need for
chat rooms. Other IM clients have sought to tackle the problem of allowing
more than two people to chat simultaneously in a variety of ways.
Unfortunately, at this time, Google Talk does not.There are extremely tal-
ented programmers from across the world who have tried their hand at recti-
fying this problem, though.

Figure 5.42 A Personal Radio Station in IMRadio
To make up for the lack of a group chat feature, one New Zealand pro-
grammer who goes by the name of Isomer has designed a Google Talk bot
made speciﬁcally to operate as a chat room bot. His free Google Talk
Conference Bot, known as confbot, is open source and can be downloaded
from http://coders.meta.net.nz/~perry/jabber/confbot.php.The bot was
written using the Python language, so an interpreter (www.python.org) must
be installed onto your computer to run the application.Although the bot
designed for Linux, it can be run under a Windows environment as long as
the Windows Python interpreter is installed.
To use the conference bot you must ﬁrst create a unique Google Talk
account for it.This can be done by simply creating a “throw-away” e-mail
address and sending a Gmail invite to it.The conference bot application must
be placed onto an Internet-accessible computer with an installed Python
interpreter, preferably a shell server from a Web host.
To run the conference bot, you simply need to run the confbot.py ﬁle
using python, as shown in Figure 5.43. In Linux environments this can be
done by typing python confbot.py while you’re in the confbot directory.
The ﬁrst time that confbot is executed it will prompt you for its account
www.syngress.com
138
Chapter 5 • Google Talk Add-ons and Modiﬁcations

information.You must supply it a valid Google Talk account name and pass-
word as well as a short description of itself and an administrator account.This
administrator account should be the full e-mail address used by your Google
Talk client. When you connect to the bot at a later time, if the bot sees that
you are using the administrator account, it will offer an extended list of
options and abilities.
Figure 5.43 Running Confbot 1.32 for the First Time
Once all this information is typed in, it will be automatically stored to a
confbot.ini ﬁle, which can be edited at any time to update the information.
While the confbot is running it will continually update the display with all
the chatter that occurs within the chat room.This information will also be
logged to a daily text ﬁle named in the dating format of YYYYMMDD.log.

Notes From the Underground…
Confbot Phone Home!
WARNING! When you visit confbot’s home page, you will notice a short
list of active bots and their addresses. This list is automatically generated
by registration code written into the software. Every time your confbot is
launched it will contact the owner’s Web site and add itself to this list for
others to ﬁnd. If you want to keep your bot private and undiscovered, you
only need to make a slight tweak to the source. Edit the confbot.py with
a text editor and locate the line that reads:
urllib.urlretrieve('http://coders.meta.net.nz/~perry/jabber/confbot.p
hp?'+urllib.urlencode(args))
Place a # symbol at the very beginning of this line to prevent it from
being run, thus reporting your bot back to the software’s Web site.
Once the bot is up and running, you simply need to add it as a user to
your own contact list. If you see the bot’s username appear online with a
status of Ready, then you know it is running. Just open a chat session with
the bot and you will be welcomed in, as shown in Figure 5.44 with the
EliteWorld (http://eliteworld.googlepages.com/) bot.
Figure 5.44 A Confbot in Action

Chapter 5 • Google Talk Add-ons and Modiﬁcations

The confbot operates using normal IRC-based commands. If you’ve never
used IRC before, that’s perfectly ﬁne.The commands are fairly straightfor-
ward, such as:
■
/help Displays a list of all available commands
■
/names Displays a list of all users in the channel, showing their
actual Google Talk account names.
■
/whois name Shows the status of the speciﬁed account name
■
/me action Performs an action command, or emote. For example,
“/me dances a jig” will be displayed as “Brian dances a jig”.
■
/nochat message Sets yourself as away
Once you are in the channel with others, any messages you transmit will
be immediately relayed to their windows. Each message will begin with its
sender’s username, as shown in Figure 5.45.
Figure 5.45 A Confbot Message
The Google Talk Conference Bot does have an active user base and sup-
port group to help new users who are setting up the software.The support
board is located at http://groups.google.com/group/confbot.Additionally,
www.syngress.com

some of the chat bots that use the software have their own groups, such as the
EliteWorld group at http://groups.google.com/group/EliteWorldGroup.
Pushing the Envelope
Many developers are content to improve small functions of the Google Talk
client; others like to push the envelope and attempt to perform feats that most
users would never think of. Here we cover a few of these advancements, such
as the ability to use Google Talk to talk to your friends on other IM networks
like AIM and Yahoo.And even though the BlackBerry Google Talk client is
well known, you might not know that there is even a client available for a
standard cell phone!
Google Talk to Go 
One of the increased pressures in today’s world is that we are always on the
go and we always need to feel connected. So, why settle for Google Talk
when you have to leave it back home or at the ofﬁce? It’s not like you can
whip out your laptop on the sidewalk to send a quick reminder to a buddy;
even with a tablet PC that can be burdensome.The answer lies in much
smaller devices that we can operate quickly and easily.
Earlier in the book, we went into how Google Talk could be used on a
RIM BlackBerry and a Nokia 770 Internet Tablet, which is great for all of
the suit-and-tie executives. But what solutions are there for the common
person? How about MGTalk, a free, open-source cell phone client? MGTalk
is an excellent application, written in Java, that is available at
http://mgtalk.sourceforge.net.All you need is a cell phone that supports Java
applets and a cell phone carrier that supports Internet trafﬁc.You can either
place the client on your phone through a data cable from your PC or through
a direct download from its Web site. Once it’s installed, you can start talking
to all your friends from anywhere in the world where you get a cell signal
(which does not include the author’s home, unfortunately). I tried it out on
my own Audiovox SMT5600 and have documented its operations here.
Once downloaded, simply connect your cell phone to your computer
using an appropriate data cable, then copy the MGTalk.jad and MGTalk.jar
www.syngress.com
142
Chapter 5 • Google Talk Add-ons and Modiﬁcations

ﬁles to a temporary location on your phone. Use whatever appropriate func-
tions are provided to install MGTalk into your phone, as shown in Figure
5.46, and start the application.
Figure 5.46 Installing MGTalk on a Cell Phone 
When you ﬁrst run MGTalk, you’ll be presented with a proﬁle list into
which you can add all your Google Talk accounts. Select Add New… to
create a new proﬁle.You will be presented with a screen where you can enter
all your connection information, as shown in Figure 5.47. From here, give this
proﬁle a name, although you can leave it the default Gtalk. When you are set-
ting up multiple accounts, a unique proﬁle name will help you keep them
organized. Set the User name: to your particular username@gmail.com,
and enter the password to your account.The Host name: ﬁeld speciﬁes the
server that you will be connecting to. Ensure that the check box at the
bottom labeled SSL? is not checked.You do not want SSL enabled or you
will not be able to connect.
If you scroll down through the options, you will come across more
detailed settings, as shown in Figure 5.48. From here, you can enter alternate
ports for connections to a proxy server.You can also turn on the auto-con-
nect feature to automatically log into Google Talk through this account in the
future.The GTalk features are enabled by default, allowing you to receive
notices when you receive new e-mail and giving you greater control over
your online status.

143

Figure 5.47 Entering Proﬁle Information in MGTalk
Figure 5.48 Detailed MGTalk Settings
There are more features than these, all of which are described on the
product’s Web page. Once all your information has been entered and veriﬁed,
save the information and you will be returned to the proﬁle list screen, as
shown in Figure 5.49. When you are ready to connect, highlight the proﬁle
you just created and select it.
MGTalk will then proceed to connect to the Internet from your phone
and then to Google Talk’s server. It might take a few retries before it makes a
successful connection, depending on your local carrier signals, so patience is
key. Once the login is successfully completed, you will be presented with your
current contact list, as shown in Figure 5.50.

The MGTalk client also gives you the ability to perform actions on your
account, such as adding, renaming, and deleting your friends.These actions are
found under Menu, as shown in Figure 5.52. From here you can also select
the Mailbox entry to check your Google Mail from your cell phone.
Figure 5.52 MGTalk Menu
Sleeping With the Enemy
Google Talk is great for conversing with your other Google Talk friends, but
why should your buddies who aren’t blessed with the Google Talk client be
left out? Well, you don’t have to worry about that for long, because it is pos-
sible to talk to your friends on AOL Instant Messenger,Yahoo! Messenger, and
Windows Live Messenger using the Google Talk client! To do so requires a
lengthy setup with additional software, but once the conﬁguration is com-
plete, you will be easily chatting with the entire instant-messaging world.
To connect to other IM networks, we will use Jabber transports. Jabber
transports are gateways on the Internet that take trafﬁc from one IM network
and translate it to another.You must ﬁnd a compatible gateway on the
Internet, register your account through that service, and relay trafﬁc through
the gateway to be received on other networks, as shown in Figure 5.53.
www.syngress.com
146
Chapter 5 • Google Talk Add-ons and Modiﬁcations

Figure 5.53 Relaying Trafﬁc Through Internet Gateways Using Jabber
Transports
Google Talk will let us send messages to a Jabber transport, but it does not
support registering for one.To create an account on a Jabber transport, we
will use a different Jabber client that supports Google Talk, Psi. Psi is a free,
open-source client that is available from http://psi.afﬁnix.com.You must
download the client and install it onto your computer, though the installation
is temporary. Once you’ve registered on a Jabber transport, you can uninstall
Psi, since your contact list should replicate to the standard Google Talk client.
Notes From the Underground…
You Can’t Get There From Here
The Jabber transport implementation has been in use for a number of
years but is still not the rock-solid reliable method that many would hope
for. As Jabber servers become popular and host transports for thousands
of users, their reliability plummets. This means that the use of most
Jabber transports could lead to unexpected situations, such as friends not
being added to your contact list, being unable to send or receive mes-
sages, or being unable to log into the transport. Highly motivated users
www.syngress.com
Google Talk Add-ons and Modiﬁcations • Chapter 5

Continued

should feel free to install their own Jabber server locally to handle the
communication translation using free, open-source transports from
www.blathersource.org. 
After you’ve installed Psi, run the application to be presented with an
option to create a new account, as shown in Figure 5.54. Specify an account
name, such as Google Talk, and click the button labeled Add to show the
details of the account.
Figure 5.54 Creating a New Psi Account
When you add an account, a new window will appear, as shown in Figure
5.55. From in this window, you must input your full Google Talk account as
the Jabber ID as well as enter your Google Talk password.
With your personal information entered, click the Connection tab to
view information pertaining to how Psi will connect to Google Talk, as
shown in Figure 5.56. Make sure that every box located here is checked to
ensure that Psi can connect appropriately.Also, enter the name of the con-
necting server in the Host ﬁeld. Once this process is complete, click the Save
button to return to the Psi main screen where you can log into your account.

Figure 5.55 Psi Account Properties Window
Figure 5.56 The Connection Tab
Once you’ve ensured that Psi can connect to your Google Talk account,
you then have to conﬁgure the Jabber transport.This is done by using the Psi
Service Discovery tool, available in the Psi menu shown on Figure 5.57.
www.syngress.com
Google Talk Add-ons and Modiﬁcations • Chapter 5
149

Figure 5.57 The Psi Service Directory Tool
The Psi Service Discovery tool will allow you to enter a known Jabber
server for it to scan. It will then examine the speciﬁed server to see exactly
which services are being provided by it. However, you will have to ﬁrst ﬁnd
an available Jabber server.The easiest way to do so is to view the listings at
www.xmpp.net/servers or view the graphical map of servers at
www.xmpp.net/map/node, as shown in Figure 5.58.An older list of servers
available at www.jabber.org/network/oldnetwork.shtml also lists exactly
which servers have AIM, MSN, or other transports conﬁgured.
Once you’ve picked an appropriate Jabber server, input the name into the
Address ﬁeld, and click the Browse button.You will immediately see a list
populate of all the available services from that particular server, as shown in
Figure 5.59. In our example, you can see that this server hosts AIM, ICQ,
MSN, and Yahoo! transports.

Chapter 5 • Google Talk Add-ons and Modiﬁcations

Figure 5.58 Jabber Server Map
Figure 5.59 Services Available From a Jabber Server
Even though all these transports are being hosted at this site, they might
not allow for new registrations. Right-click the transport you want to use,
and observe whether the Register item is selectable. If it is not, you have to
ﬁnd another Jabber server that will allow you to create a new registration.
Otherwise, click the Register item to bring up the registration window
shown in Figure 5.60. Within this window you can type your actual user-

name and password for that particular service. If you are registering to an
AIM transport, you must specify an AIM account that you have already estab-
lished. Once you’ve entered this information, click the Register button and
you’re all done.
Figure 5.60 Registration Window
Now that the Jabber transport has been initiated, use the Psi client to add
new contacts to your list from other networks. From the Psi main menu,
choose Add a contact to be shown the Add User window. From here,
simply enter the Jabber ID of your buddy using his or her screen name on
the remote service with the transport that you speciﬁed. For example, if
you’re adding EnRon964 from AOL Instant Messenger through the aim.syn-
dicon.de transport, enter EnRon964@aim.syndicon.de.You can optionally
specify a new nickname for the person or assign them a Psi user group. Once
you’re done, click the Add button to place the buddy onto your contact list.
From within Psi you should immediately be able to communicate with that
person.Additionally, the next time you log into the Google Talk client, you
should see the friend’s contact information show up, as shown in Figure 5.61.
At this point, you’re all set up and ready to start chatting with your friends
on other services. Just make sure you keep Psi around to add the accounts,
since the Google Talk client does not support adding clients from a Jabber
transport.

Summary
Even though Google Talk was designed to be a simpliﬁed client, giving users
exactly the features they most need, there has been a constant call for more
effects and capabilities.To help ﬁll this need, a variety of modiﬁcation tools
have arisen to add advanced capabilities into the Google Talk client. For one,
the GT-Plug application gives you graphical emoticons and the ability to
make your Google Talk client transparent. It also features a boss key, to imme-
diately hide your client in case the boss walks by your ofﬁce, as well as local
logging so that you can keep a handy text log of all your chats.
Another Google Talk modiﬁcation tool that has a large number of addi-
tional features is Extended Talk, which also gives you the ability to show
graphical emoticons and make your individual Google Talk windows trans-
parent.As well as a boss key, it also features a keyboard lock so that you can
prevent text from being typed into your chat windows while you’re away
from the keyboard. It includes a number of aesthetic changes, letting you
manipulate text from your friends. However, one of its most innovative fea-
tures is its active status scripts, which allow you to create customized status
screens to show off the program you’re working in or the regular RSS feed
from your favorite Web site.
Although these two programs can manipulate many features within
Google Talk, some of the greatest improvements can be made by simply using
a customized graphical theme.Themes control how text is displayed within
your chat windows, including graphics, colors, and text sizes.These themes are
also extremely customizable, allowing anyone with a basic knowledge of
HTML and CSS to create awe-inspiring works of art.There is a standardized
structure to theme ﬁles, but a simple edit of a number of small text ﬁles can
give your Google Talk a dramatic facelift.
Google Talk features an excellent voice codec and protocol that transmit
crisp and clear audio between you and your friends. However, there is no
capability to allow you to connect to others who are outside the Google Talk
network.To ﬁll this need, a number of companies have designed products that
tie additional VoIP capabilities into the Google Talk client. One such applica-
tion is Talqer, which has created its own software that ties into the Google
Talk client to allow you to make phone calls quickly and easily.Although not
www.syngress.com

Chapter 5 • Google Talk Add-ons and Modiﬁcations

a free service,Talqer offers very low rates, even lower than Skype’s. Its client
requires very minimal conﬁguration and setup. Once it’s installed, you simply
log in with your Google Talk account information and you can start calling
your friends and family on their real phones.
Another competitor for the Google Talk VoIP market is GTalk-to-VoIP, a
service that is completely integrated into the Google Talk service.
GTalk2VoIP actually takes Google Talk’s Libjingle protocol and converts it to
VoIP H.323 on the ﬂy to allow you to use Google Talk’s voice capabilities to
communicate with friends over the phone network. Not only does
GTalk2VoIP also offer extremely low rates, it also provide capabilities for
voicemail and conference calls.
For users who like to stay on the cutting edge and feel that communica-
tion isn’t worth it if you can’t see who you’re talking to, you’ll feel right at
home with the Festoon videoconferencing software for Google Talk. Festoon
is a separate application that ties into your Google Talk contact list to nego-
tiate video calls between you and your friends. Once a video call is under
way, Festoon features many fun effects to modify your appearance, such as
cut-out backgrounds and funhouse effects.
While you’re having fun with Festoon, you can also spice up your voice
communications with Screaming Bee’s MorphVOX application. MorphVOX
is an application that alters your voice to sound like a large number of indi-
vidual characters, from basic male and female voices to dark warlords.
Now that more households have access to broadband speeds and vast dig-
ital music libraries, there is a large demand for the ability to broadcast music
to friends and family over the Internet in a safe, legal manner. Google Talk
itself does not support this functionality, but with a few changes to your
Windows sound settings you can easily broadcast all sounds from your com-
puter, including your music soundtrack, to your friends through Google Talk’s
voice calls.
The aspiring DJs among us might feel more at home with Mercora’s
IMRadio application. IMRadio is a full-featured media player that also allows
you to create multiple radio stations for your collection of tunes.All your
friends on Google Talk who also have the IMRadio application installed can
then listen in on your virtual radio stations or offer their own playlists for you
to hear.

Google Talk accomplishes direct communication between peers effectively,
but it does not provide the capability for group chat rooms, a feature that it is
sorely lacking. Fortunately, one New Zealand programmer has solved this
problem with the release of Confbot, an open-source chat room Google Talk
bot. Confbot uses its own unique Google Talk account to allow thousands of
people to connect and communicate in an IRC-esque chat room.
Even though there are ofﬁcial clients for both the RIM BlackBerry and
the Nokia 770 Internet Tablet, there is no ofﬁcial support for the lowly cel-
lular phones that the majority of humans now possess. However, there is
MGTalk, a free Java-based client that allows you to send messages to your
Google Talk friends from anywhere you can get signal.
You can even chat with all your friends who are tied to old, deprecated
IM services such as AIM, MSN, and Yahoo. By connecting through a Jabber
transport server, you can add your friends from these various servers to your
list and directly communicate.The magic behind this capability happens in
the transport server, which directly translates the packets from one IM format
to another to maintain compatibility.

Introduction
Many companies allow Internet access only when clients ﬁrst connect
through a proxy server. In this chapter we discuss proxy servers and explain
how Google Talk can be conﬁgured to connect through them.
What Are Proxies?
What are proxies, and why do we need them? To ﬁgure that out, you ﬁrst
need to understand how communication occurs between computers on the
Internet. For example, when connecting to a Web server such as
http://googletalk.blogspot.com, your Web browser will connect directly to
the site, request the Web page, and display it on your screen. When the Web
server wants to send information back to you, it does so directly to your
computer, based on your computer’s IP address.
A proxy is a server that stands between you and another machine that you
are communicating with. If you connect to blogspot.com through a proxy
server, the proxy server accepts your request, connects to the target server, and
retrieves the Web page for you.After retrieving all the data, it then sends a
copy to your Web browser for you to view on your screen. When working
through a proxy, you never make any direct connection to the server that is
holding your data; instead, the proxy makes the connections for you, as shown
in Figure 6.1.

Why Use Proxies?
So proxy servers allow us to send our data through another machine. Why is
this so important, and why should we be interested in the prospect? Proxies
have many uses, some legitimate and some not so legitimate.A proxy itself is a
dumb server that simply relays information, but depending on who uses that
proxy, it can be a tool used for good or evil.
Proxy servers are normally installed in many corporate network environ-
ments as a means of monitoring trafﬁc leaving the network.This proxy server
is usually placed as the single point of egress. In layman’s terms, that means
everyone exits through the same door instead of jumping out their ofﬁce
windows. Some corporate environments allow trafﬁc to leave and go onto the
Internet only if that trafﬁc ﬁrst passes through a designated proxy server,
which then logs and monitors all that activity.To use Google Talk in such an
environment, you must conﬁgure it to connect to Google’s servers through
your corporate proxy, as shown in Figure 6.2.

Proxy servers can also be used to camouﬂage your activity from network
administrators on your network. Even if a network does not require the use
of an internal proxy server, administrators can monitor the trafﬁc through
egress points to determine what activity is taking place within their networks.
If connections are seen from your computer’s IP address to Google’s Talk
servers, it would be fairly obvious to your corporate IT administrators that
you are using the Google Talk client.You can attempt to hide your actions by
using a proxy server. If your network administrators then attempt to monitor
the trafﬁc, they will only see communications between your computer and
the proxy server; all the connections from the proxy to Google will take place
outside the network where they cannot be monitored.
Besides hiding your trafﬁc, a proxy server can be used to allow you to
access a server that has been blocked by a network administrator. Just as many
enterprise networks block known “time-sink” Web sites, such as Orkut,
MySpace, eBay, and Microsoft’s Support site, they can block access to known
instant-messaging servers on the Internet. Many of these blocks are made
using very simple rules, such as “Block all TCP connections to port 5222 on
talk.google.com.”As many college students have already discovered, when
their college doesn’t want to them to visit a popular site, proxies will let them
regain their access to those forbidden places.
Notes from the Underground…
Using Proxies to Bypass Corporate Security
Although it is technically possible to use a proxy server to bypass company
ﬁlters and monitors, doing so could be considered a breach of your com-
pany’s acceptable-use policies. Nearly all network administrators want to
be aware of all trafﬁc entering and leaving their networks, and they don’t
take lightly to users circumventing their monitoring or security systems. In
other words, using a proxy could get you ﬁred from your job. Caveat
emptor, YMMV, and YOYOMF. In plain English, be careful when using
proxies and seek you network administrator’s permission ﬁrst.

Chapter 6 • Proxy Use

Conﬁguring Google Talk to Use Proxies
The Google Talk client allows you to easily conﬁgure communications
through a proxy server via its conﬁguration screens. From within the Google
Talk client, click the link labeled Settings in the upper-right corner, to be
shown the conﬁguration window.To display the proxy settings, click
Connection from the list that appears on the left side, as shown in Figure 6.3.
Figure 6.3 Conﬁguring Proxy Settings in Google Talk
By default, Google Talk is conﬁgured to Detect proxy automatically,
which means that Google Talk will attempt to pull proxy information from
Internet Explorer. Most corporate networks that use a proxy server will have
the server set up automatically within Internet Explorer. If so, then you won’t
have to set up the proxy at all; it’s already done for you.This is also the setting
to leave on if you don’t use a proxy at all.
To input your own proxy settings, click the radio button labeled Use the
following proxy:, which will allow you to enter the rest of the ﬁelds in the
screen. From here you can enter Host and Port, the two basic settings
required to use a proxy server. Host is either the IP address or the domain
www.syngress.com
Proxy Use • Chapter 6
165

name of the proxy server that you’ll be using, and Port is the numeric port
number that the proxy server is accepting connections on. Each proxy server
has its own self-deﬁned port number, though it is usually something like 80,
1080, or 8080.You will also notice additional authentication ﬁelds in this
screen that are not enabled by default. Most proxy servers in use do not
require authentication, but some do. If you are connecting to a “closed” proxy,
which does not accept anonymous connections, you will need to check the
box labeled Proxy requires Authentication, and type the username and
password in the ﬁelds provided.
Once you’ve ﬁlled out all the ﬁelds with correct information, press the
OK button to close the conﬁguration window and return to Google Talk.
You can then attempt to connect using the new settings by changing your
status to Available, to force a login.
Onion Router Proxies
Onion router proxies are a unique innovation in the proxy world. Onion routing
provides data anonymity through the Internet, which is quite useful if you’re
attempting to use Google Talk from within an oppressive political regime.
Instead of a single proxy server relaying your data, onion routing takes advan-
tage of a network of multiple proxy servers, as shown in Figure 6.4, through
which data is randomly bounced around before it reaches the intended target.
It’s like walking to work every day and selecting a random route each time. If
someone were attempting to track your whereabouts, it would be extremely
difﬁcult for them to do so if you randomly jumped down side streets and
dived into manholes between your house and your workplace. Onion routers
also encrypt all the trafﬁc from your computer and throughout the proxy net-
work. So, not only are you taking new routes to work every day, you’re also
switching disguises to a random Battlestar Galactica character between each
intersection.
There are numerous applications used for onion-routing networks,
including JAP (http://anon.inf.tu-dresden.de/index_en.html), I2P
(www.i2p.net), and Tor (http://tor.eff.org).Tor is one of the most common
and well-known onion networks; much of the technology that we’ll discuss
here will be focused on it.
www.syngress.com
166
Chapter 6 • Proxy Use

Figure 6.4 Google Talking Through an Onion Routing Network
How Onion Routing Works
To take advantage of an onion routing network, you must ﬁrst have client
software installed that takes your network trafﬁc and runs it through that net-
work. For the duration of this chapter, we will use Tor for our examples.Tor
can be downloaded from its homepage at http://tor.eff.org/download.html
and is available in a variety of formats.The most common format is a bundle
kit of Tor, Privoxy, and Vidalia, which we’ll discuss later.You can also down-
load packages for both Mac OS X and Linux.
Onion routing takes packets from your computer and bounces them
throughout the Onion Router (OR) network until they exist on the network
and contact the remote host. For this sequence to proceed, your client must
ﬁrst build a circuit through the OR network. Each Tor client has a database of
all available Tor servers on the network, and the client plans out a circuit
through the network using this list.
To make its ﬁrst connection, your client contacts the ﬁrst Onion Router
(OR1) and negotiates a symmetric key for encrypting data.Your client then
tells OR1 to connect to the second OR, OR2, and transmit another set of
symmetric keys. In this way, each OR that you communicate with on the Tor
network maintains a unique key for encrypting data so that no two servers

167
Onion Routing Network
`
Client Computer
Google Talk 
Server

Clear Text

share the same key. However, you never connect to each OR individually; the
messages are passed along through the circuit that you’ve created. In the
example shown in Figure 6.4, six separate ORs are used to create the circuit;
each one holds a unique encryption key, and each one only knows of the
existence of the server before and after it in the circuit.The ﬁnal portion of
the circuit is designating an exit server, which is an OR that volunteers to pass
data from within the OR network unencrypted to servers on the Internet.
Once this circuit has been created, all trafﬁc from your computer will be
routed through it for a small period of time, after which the circuit will be
broken down and a new, random one will be created.
After the creation of the circuit, you are ready to send and receive data to
servers on the Internet. When your client sends a packet of data out, the
packet is transmitted in multiple layers of encryption: once for each OR it
must pass through. For example, if the text “Hi, Bob!” is to be transmitted
through the six ORs in Figure 6.4, the text would ﬁrst be bound in six layers
of encryption, like {{{{{{Hi, Bob!}}}}}}.As the packet leaves your com-
puter, it is received by the ﬁrst OR, which removes the ﬁrst layer of encryp-
tion.After skinning this layer off, it is unable to read the text because of the
ﬁve other layers of encryption. So, it simply passes the data off to the next
OR. Each OR then removes the outer layer of encryption until the packet is
handed off to the exit server.This OR will remove the ﬁnal layer of encryp-
tion, revealing the raw packet contents, which it then forwards onto the
Internet recipient (Google Talk’s server).
Once data is sent back from the Internet server to the Tor network, it is
received by the exit server and encrypted.The exit server passes this
encrypted response back to the next OR in the chain. Each OR then
encrypts the data using a key that only your client and that OR know.
Eventually, the response will be received by your computer, where you
unwrap the six layers of encryption and process the data.
This layering of encryption is how onion routing receives its name; each
onion router must peel off the outer layer of skin, like peeling an onion. We
could go into more technical detail here, but I’m sure it’d make you cry, just
as though you were peeling a real onion. If you’d like to read more on how
onion routers operate, check out Tor’s design documentation at
http://tor.eff.org/doc/design-paper/tor-design.html.

Chapter 6 • Proxy Use

Conﬁguring Google Talk 
to Use Onion Routing Proxies
Installing and using Tor with Google Talk is not very difﬁcult.You must ﬁrst
download and install the Tor and Privoxy packages from http://tor.eff.org.
Currently, you can download a bundle package that includes Tor, Privoxy,
and Vidalia.
Tor is the client that connects to the Tor network; Privoxy works hand
in hand as a locally run proxy. Privoxy will route your local data out through
Tor. Privoxy runs as a service on your computer, listening for network con-
nection on TCP port 8118, by default.Any data transferred to your computer
on port 8118 will be immediately redirected out through Tor. Vidalia is an
intuitive graphical interface for interacting with the Tor client. It loads an
onion icon into your system tray from which you can conﬁgure your entire
Tor-related settings; it even allows you to use your computer as an onion router.
Tools & Traps…
DNS Leakage! Oh, My!
Using a standard Tor client to connect to the Internet does pose one inter-
esting problem in your hunt for anonymity: It leaks DNS requests. As you
might already know, every time you attempt to connect to a domain
name on the Internet, such as talk.google.com, your computer asks its
designated DNS server for the actual IP address, because connections are
allowed only through an IP address. Using a standard Tor server can help
encrypt the data that you transmit to the Internet, but your computer still
broadcasts very loudly the name of every server you’re connecting to
through these DNS requests. 
Privoxy combats this issue by transmitting all DNS queries through
the Tor network, along with your encrypted data. Using Tor without
Privoxy is not recommended if privacy is a concern.
www.syngress.com
Proxy Use • Chapter 6
169

Simply download the Tor, Privoxy, and Vidalia bundle from Tor’s Web site
and run the executable to begin installing the software. Step through the pro-
cess, choosing a Full Install, to install each piece onto your computer.
To use the installed functionality, simply conﬁgure Google Talk to use Tor
by default. Open your Google Talk client and open Settings, as shown earlier
in this chapter. Click Connections to show your proxy settings, as shown in
Figure 6.3. Input 127.0.0.1 into the host ﬁeld and 8118 into the port ﬁeld.
Then simply click OK and sign into the Google Talk service. From your per-
spective, it will appear that little has changed. However, if you have the tools
(such as WireShark, from www.wireshark.org) to monitor your network
trafﬁc, you will see all the trafﬁc being sent to a Tor server instead of Google
Talk’s server.
Using an SSH Tunnel
Another form of creating a proxy connection is through an SSH tunnel, in
which you create a Secure Shell (SSH) connection from your computer to
another machine outside your network.Your Google Talk trafﬁc can then be
routed through this tunnel outside your network and into the wild, free world
of the Internet. SSH allows for encrypted data to be directly transmitted
between two computers, though it’s normally used for controlling a remote
Linux or UNIX server.To take advantage of SSH tunneling, you must have
an SSH server somewhere on the Internet, usually in the of a Linux server.
You will also need an SSH client installed on your computer. Linux and Mac
OS X users already have a great client built in, for free. Windows users will
have to obtain their own SSH client; we highly recommend Putty, a free,
open-source application that can be obtained from www.putty.nl.
www.syngress.com
170
Chapter 6 • Proxy Use

Tools & Traps…
Buying a Ticket for an SSH Tunnel
Not everyone has their own Linux or UNIX servers in their homes,
although they should. So, luckily there are a large number of publicly
available ones on the Internet. These servers sell SSH access to purchased
accounts, known as “shell accounts”. While there are some free shell ser-
vices out there, most require some form of regular payment. One of the
greatest 
lists 
of 
free 
shell 
accounts 
can 
be 
found 
at
www.ductape.net/~mitja/freeunix.shtml. There are also sites that list
commercial shell accounts, such as www.shellsearch.com. 
Creating an SSH Tunnel in Windows
We’ll use Putty to demonstrate how to create a tunnel within Windows.
Putty will build an encrypted SSH tunnel between your machine and the
remote SSH server.The data will be decrypted at the SSH server and passed
on to Google Talk.The process is reversed for return data. Note that anyone
with a computer between the remote SSH server and the Google Talk server
can snoop on your session.
Installing Putty is easy. Simply download Putty and run the executable;
there is no installation process.The main window might seem cluttered, as
shown in Figure 6.5, but the default window shows the session conﬁguration
screen, where you will enter the information about the remote SSH server.
From this window, you will notice a ﬁeld labeled Host Name (or IP
address), in which you should type the name or IP address of the SSH server
that you will be connecting to. If the SSH server is not using the default port
of 22, you can specify the correct value in the Port ﬁeld. Finally, if you’d like,
give this session a name in the ﬁeld labeled Saved Sessions, then press Save
to save it as a bookmark.
www.syngress.com
Proxy Use • Chapter 6

Figure 6.5 Creating an SSH Tunnel With Putty
Before we make a connection to the SSH server, we need to conﬁgure
port forwarding within Putty, which allows it to listen for data and relay it to
your SSH server. Simply browse through the left explorer bar to Connection
| SSH | Tunnels, as shown in Figure 6.6. At the bottom of this screen are
two ﬁelds labeled Source port and Destination.The source port is the TCP
port that you want Putty to listen on for your Google Talk client.The desti-
nation is the name of Google Talk’s server, with its associated port number.
Simply input the source port as 5223 and the destination as
talk.google.com:5223, then press the Add button to store the data. If the
data was entered correctly, you should see the text L5223
talk.google.com:5223 appear within the Forwarded ports ﬁeld.
With these values entered, click the Open button to begin the connec-
tion. Log into the SSH server, when prompted, with your assigned username
and password. Once you’ve logged in and received a command shell, you’re all
done. Now just open Google Talk and conﬁgure it to use a proxy host of
localhost and a port of “5223, using the steps we went over earlier in this
chapter. Sign into Google Talk, and now all your Talk trafﬁc will look like a
normal, encrypted SSH stream.

Figure 6.6 Creating an SSH Tunnel With Putty
Creating an SSH Tunnel in Linux and OS X
Conﬁguring an SSH tunnel from within Linux and Macintosh OS X is a bit
simpler to do, especially if you’re used to working on the command line.
Instead of sifting through numerous screens and text boxes, merely open a
terminal window and type the following:
$ ssh -L 5223:talk.google.com:5223 –N <username>@<hostname>
Simply provide your SSH username as username, the name or IP address of the
SSH server as hostname. Once you’re connected, the -N switch tells SSH not
to start the command shell, so the window will just freeze.This is normal
behavior; Putty is simply waiting for data to come across its connection. Now
open Google Talk and conﬁgure it to use a proxy host of localhost and a
port of 5223, using the steps we went over earlier in this chapter. Sign into
Google Talk, and your communications will now be transmitted across the
SSH stream.

Summary
Many corporate networks implement proxy servers to route all egress net-
work trafﬁc through a centralized server, called a proxy server.This server
handles all connections to the Internet, and also logs all transactions for later
review.A proxy is simply a server that relays your Internet trafﬁc to its desti-
nation, without having your client connect directly to the destination.
However, not only can proxies be used for internal monitoring, but also to
allow your users to hide their network trafﬁc on your network. Instead of
users connecting directly to Google, they would be connecting to a nonde-
script proxy server on the Internet, making it more difﬁcult for you as the
network administrator to track their activities.They can also allow you to
bypass blocks placed against certain domain names and IP addresses.
Conﬁguring Google Talk to use a proxy is performed very simply using
the steps outlined in this chapter. Enter the conﬁguration settings for Google
Talk and view the connection settings. From here, specify that you wish to
use a particular proxy and type in the address of the proxy and the port that it
listens on.
While proxies can be used simply to slide trafﬁc past network blocks, they
can also be used to encrypt your trafﬁc and randomly bounce it around the
world before delivering it to your destination.This practice falls under the
practice of onion routing, using famous programs such as Tor.To implement
Tor for Google Talk, you simply need to download and install the
Tor/Vidalia/Privoxy package described in this chapter and conﬁgure Google
Talk to route trafﬁc through your Privoxy application.The data will then be
encrypted several times over and sent out through a chain of Tor proxy
servers, many of which don’t know where you’re coming from or where
you’re going to.
You can also send trafﬁc out of your network by creating an encrypted
SSH tunnel between your computer and another on the Internet.To do so,
you just need an account on a remote Linux/UNIX server running SSH, and
a local SSH client, such as Putty.The tunnel is created by connecting to the
remote server through your client, and then directing Google Talk to send its
trafﬁc through this tunnel. It is a quick and efﬁcient way to encrypt your data
and bypass network blocks.

What Are Proxies?
 Proxies are computers that relay messages between your client and another
server so that you do not have to directly communicate with the server.
 Proxies can be used to bypass network-blocking schemes put in place
by local network administrators.
 Proxies are also used internally to force all network users through a single
monitoring computer.
Conﬁguring Google Talk to Use Proxies
 Google Talk allows for connections through the conﬁguration
settings, which require the proxy’s host name (or IP address) and port
number.
Onion Router Proxies
 Onion router networks exist to relay messages through multiple, randomly
chosen proxies, for increased anonymity.
 Onion routing also encrypts all data that travels within its network for data
security.
Using an SSH Tunnel
 SSH tunneling allows for Google Talk data to be redirected through an existing
SSH session between your computer and a Linux/Unix server on the Internet.
 SSH tunneling can be established within Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X
environments.

Q: What kind of trouble can I get into by using a proxy?
A: That all depends on the acceptable-use policies of the network that you
are on. If you are on a public network, such as a library or restaurant Wi-
Fi, it is normally not a problem. School environments often disallow the
use of certain protocols and services and often frown on the use of proxy
servers. By using proxies to circumvent blocks, you could be banned from
the network or even ﬁred from your job.
Q: Can my administrator see that I am using a proxy?
A: Yes and no.The administrator will see data traveling between your com-
puter and another computer on the Internet.The administrator will not
readily know that the Internet computer is a proxy server. However, if you
have a large amount of data going only to a proxy server, it could raise a
few ﬂags.A competent administrator could probably guess that you are
using a proxy server, based on your usage statistics.
Q: My network is really locked down! None of the steps outlined in this
chapter work; what can I do?
A: You are held at the mercy of your local network administrators. If an
administrator has decided to block SSH and Tor connections, you are left
with few choices. Many networks limit the ports that they allow out to
only a handful, such as port 80 (Web trafﬁc).You could still be able to
connect to a proxy site that is listening on one of these ports, since it
would look like regular Web trafﬁc to the local administrator.

Introduction
To remain competitive, a corporation must leverage technology to improve
communication and productivity. In this context, the beneﬁt of instant-mes-
saging technology is evident. Instant-messaging clients such as Google Talk
allow coworkers to quickly share and discuss ideas without the overhead of e-
mail and without the socially entrapping walk to a coworker’s cubicle. When
implemented properly, Google Talk and Google Mail can improve produc-
tivity and foster better communication, especially for employees who travel
and work offsite.
In this chapter, we discuss how workplaces can easily implement Google
Talk into their environments to improve their overall productivity. Conversely,
some companies still hold to the old idea that Google Talk trafﬁc should be
blocked; we discuss how this can be accomplished.
Implementing Google Talk 
in Your Network
As a member of a proud, forward-looking enterprise that wants to implement
the greatest IM client ever created, I welcome you to this section.Through its
simpliﬁed design and interface, Google Talk allows users to concentrate on
only one thing: discussion.There are no advertisements, pop-ups, or other dis-
tractions that weigh down other IM services.The overall effect is a client that
lends itself very well to business environments.
When deciding to implement Google Talk into your network, you must
separately conﬁgure its two different versions: the Google Talk standalone
client and the Web-based client built into the Google Mail service.
Conﬁguring for Google Talk: Standalone Client
The Google Talk client, downloaded from http://talk.google.com, is the pre-
ferred client for use in a business environment. It features many additional
capabilities that lend themselves to the needs of busy travelers, such as the
ability to leave voicemail messages and to share ﬁles. However, the client must
be installed on each and every machine that will use Google Talk.

Chapter 7 • Google Talk in the Enterprise

Deploying Google Talk Client
One of the ﬁrst hurdles that many network administrators face when deciding
to install new software is ﬁguring out the best way to deploy it throughout
their network. For small businesses with only a handful of client machines,
this task can be accomplished simply by copying the executable ﬁles to each
machine and manually installing them. However, larger networks with hun-
dreds of clients require a friendlier and more efﬁcient method of deployment.
There are a number of ways to deploy a third-party application like Google
Talk across your network.You could use an established program like
InstallShield (a commercial product available from www.installshield.com) to
collect all the relevant information into a simpliﬁed setup executable, or you
could use Microsoft’s Windows Installer framework, MSI.
An MSI ﬁle is a self-contained installer package.You Linux gurus might
think of it as a Windows version of RPM, or Solaris’ pkgadd.To create an
MSI installation of Google Talk, you will ﬁrst need an MSI creation applica-
tion.Along with the ofﬁcial products released by Microsoft, a variety of third-
party applications are available, since the MSI ﬁle structure is well known.
Microsoft’s product is included with each operating system’s Software
Development Kit (SDK).At the time of writing, the most recent SDK is the
Windows Server 2003 R2 Platform SDK, which can be downloaded from
Microsoft’s Downloads site at www.microsoft.com/downloads/. However,
getting the appropriate tools out of the SDK can be a headache.The entire
SDK download is over 400MB in size, and even the Web Install, which allows
you to choose components of the SDK to install, does not clearly deﬁne
which component you need to install to get access to the MSI creator.
The most popular alternative to Microsoft’s ofﬁcial MSI creation tools is
part of Microsoft’s Open-Source initiatives, WiX, short for Windows Installer
XML.WiX, located at http://wix.sourceforge.net, is a powerful application that
allows for dynamic scripting of MSI ﬁles through industry-standard XML text
ﬁles.WiX is best used with a graphical front end such as its own built-in Votive.
Deploying Google Talk: Client Registry Changes
To ease in the conﬁguration of the Google Talk deployment, you can also
establish accounts for each user ahead of time.This allows you as a network
www.syngress.com
Google Talk in the Enterprise • Chapter 7
181

administrator to have control over the usernames that your users communi-
cate with and helps maintain a professional appearance for your company. It’s
generally a bad idea to allow employees to contact clients or partners through
a personal account. It’s an especially bad idea if your employees have accounts
named hotlover4196 or something similar. (My apologies in advance to hot-
lover4196, if you’re out there. If you are, you really should get a new name.)
The account information for each user is stored in the Windows registry,
which you can access through the Windows Registry Editor (regedit.exe).
These accounts are stored under the following keys:
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Google\Google Talk\Accounts\o [REG_MULTI_SZ] =
<username>@gmail.com
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Google\Google Talk\Accounts\<username>@gmail.com
For example, if you’re installing Google Talk onto John Smith’s computer,
you can create an account for him, jsmith, and register it by adding a few small
items to the registry. Create the registry key
HKCU\Software\Google\Google Talk\Accounts and another key immedi-
ately below it with the full username, such as
HKCU\Software\Google\Google Talk\Accounts\jsmith@gmail.com.Then
add a new REG_MULTI_SZ value called o to
HKCU\Software\Google\Google Talk\Accounts. Double-click this value and
change the value to jsmith@gmail.com. Once these changes have been
made, Google Talk will show the user’s name and will wait for the correct
password to be typed in.
You could easily create a batch script to generate user-speciﬁc values for
these two ﬁelds, such as the one below, which registers Google Talk accounts
based on the user’s login name:
@echo off
echo Registering Google Talk account for %USERNAME%. Please wait...
reg add "HKCU\Software\Google\Google Talk\Accounts"
reg add "HKCU\Software\Google\Google Talk\Accounts\%USERNAME%@gmail.com"
reg add "HKCU\Software\Google\Google Talk\Accounts" /v o /t REG_MULTI_SZ /d
%USERNAME%@gmail.com /f
www.syngress.com
182
Chapter 7 • Google Talk in the Enterprise

This script can then be implemented through a Windows login script to
force the user to run it at his or her next login.This method allows you to
easily roll out the MSI ﬁles to install the client software on each user’s com-
puter and “activate” it by creating the user account as soon as a user logs in.
Allowing Google Talk Client Network Trafﬁc
If you’re like most network administrators, you have your network locked
down tight, to just a few core protocols that should be leaving and entering
your network.You don’t? Well, you should. If you’ve got a lone “allow all” rule
set for your ﬁrewall, skip this section; Google Talk will work “automagically”
for you, and so will a host of viruses, spyware, and other malware. For the rest
of you, allowing Google Talk to communicate with the Internet is merely a
matter of setting a few simple rules.
When a user logs into her Google Talk client, the client will ﬁrst make a
connection to either talk.google.com or talkx.l.google.com. Once this has
been resolved to an IP address, such as 216.239.37.125, Google Talk will make
a TCP connection to it on either port 5222 or 5223.The ﬁrst exchange of
data between the two computers will be an SSL/TLS key exchange to estab-
lish an encrypted communication channel.The client then sends its login cre-
dentials and is logged into the Google Talk network.These credentials, as well
as all other chat, will remain encrypted within this TLS channel.
So, to operate properly, the client requires very little. It must be able to
resolve both talkx.l.google.com and talk.google.com through DNS, and it also
must be allowed to transmit TCP data out of the network over ports 5222
and 5223.
Conﬁguring for Google Talk: Google Mail
Unlike the Google Talk standalone client, with Google Mail you do not need
to install any software onto your client computers. Users simply require a
standard Web browser, such as Mozilla Firefox (www.getﬁrefox.com), and a
valid Gmail account. Upon logging into Gmail through
http://mail.google.com, the client will automatically sign into the Google
Talk network.
www.syngress.com
Google Talk in the Enterprise • Chapter 7
183

Gmail’s mini-implementation of Talk requires very little: a browser that
can connect to Gmail and JavaScript. In this case, all trafﬁc is routed to
Gmail’s server on port 80, along with the regular e-mail trafﬁc.
Blocking Google Talk 
It is a shame that in the age of technological advances there are quite a few
Luddites who want to block any new innovation and who view Google Talk
as a burden or a threat.Although network administrators don’t fall into this
category, there are many valid reasons to block Google Talk’s network trafﬁc.
For some, it could be the fear of corporate information leaks through conver-
sation, though e-mail has the same problem. For others, it’s the fear of lost
productivity of employees chatting away rather than working, even though
they have telephones next to their computers that pose the same issue.
But regardless of the reason, there is a glimmer of hope for the admin
tasked with blocking Google Talk:You can block much of the Google Talk
network trafﬁc, but not all of it.The standalone Google Talk client can be
blocked in a number of ways: Using either group policies or certain registry
changes, you can prevent most users from being able to run the Google Talk
executable on their workstations.You can also apply blocking to your network
ﬁrewalls to prevent the clients from being able to operate.
Blocking Google Talk Trafﬁc
After reading the preceding section on how to allow Google Talk network
trafﬁc, you probably have a fair idea of how to keep it from talking to the
Internet.The Google Talk client makes a connection to either
talk.google.com or talkx.l.google.com on ports 443, 5222, or 5223. Simply
block DNS requests for those domain names, or block trafﬁc to them over
these ports. Once you’ve done that, you will have blocked a majority of your
users from being able to connect to Google Talk.
There is still trouble, though, in the implementation of Google Talk into
Google Mail.The Google Talk trafﬁc over Gmail travels through
mail.google.com port 80, along with the rest of the mail trafﬁc.You cannot
completely block Google Talk unless you also block Google Mail.

Notes from the Underground
How Users Will Bypass Your Firewall
Creating ﬁrewall rules will effectively stop your users from communicating
directly with Google, but it will not stop more advanced users from simply
using a proxy to connect to Google. Proxies are discussed in depth in
Chapter 6 of this book. A proxy will allow users to send their data to
Google through some other Internet host that you are not blocking; a
proxy can even encrypt the data on the way.
Blocking Google Talk from Executing
There are a number of ways to prevent clients from actually running the
Google Talk client, depending on the style of network that you have. If your
network is running off a Microsoft Active Directory (AD), this can be accom-
plished through a simple group policy change. For non-AD networks, you
can apply a few new keys to the registry to block it.
In the event that you want to block Google Talk from a non-Active
Directory workstation running Windows XP, the process is easily performed.
You simply need to add a registry key notifying Windows that you want to
enable the DisallowRun feature, and then create a list of executable names
that you want to disallow from running.To block Google Talk from an XP
workstation, simply add the following registry keys:
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explore
r\DisallowRun [REG_MULTI_SZ] = 1
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explore
r\DisallowRun [KEY]
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explore
r\DisallowRun\GTalk [REG_SZ] = "googletalk.exe"
The computer will have to be rebooted for the changes to take effect.
Once the computer is rebooted, if a user tries to execute googletalk.exe, he or
she will receive an error message stating that the executable cannot be run.
www.syngress.com
Google Talk in the Enterprise • Chapter 7
185

However, there is nothing to stop the user from simply renaming the exe-
cutable to something else, say winword.exe, and running it.
To combat this issue, running in an Active Directory network allows you
to place greater restrictions on client-side applications.Through Group Policy
Management, you can easily block all workstations within your domain from
being able to run Google Talk. Simply open Active Directory Users and
Computers from your Start Menu Administrative Tools and locate the orga-
nizational unit (OU) that you want to edit. Right-click this OU and select
Properties, then select the Group Policy tab. Highlight the policy you want
to edit, and click the button labeled Edit.You will then be presented with the
Group Policy Object Editor, as shown in Figure 7.1. Based on exactly how
you want to deploy the restriction, expand either Computer Conﬁguration
or User Conﬁguration. Drill down to Windows Settings | Software
Restriction Policies. If you don’t already have policies created, create a new
one; otherwise, you should see a folder named Additional Rules.
Figure 7.1 Creating Group Policy Software Restrictions
www.syngress.com
186
Chapter 7 • Google Talk in the Enterprise

To create a restriction, right-click the Additional Rules folder and select
New Path Rule…. Specify the full path and executable name of Google
Talk: C:\Program Files\Google\Google Talk\googletalk.exe. Save your
changes, and now whenever Google Talk is executed from that location, it
will be blocked. However, this will not block your users from simply moving
googletalk.exe to another path on the hard drive and running it from there.
Tools & Traps…
Hash That Bad File!
Along with blocking a particular executable ﬁlename from being run, the
Windows Group Policy Management Console (GPMC) also allows you to
block a ﬁle based on its MD5 hash value. This means that even if a user
moves the executable around or renames it, the application will not be
run unless its actual internals are modiﬁed. Following the previous steps,
right-click Additional Rules and choose New Hash Rule…. Click the
Browse button and point it to the version of Google Talk you want to
block. An MD5 value of the executable will be taken and saved, as shown
in Figure 7.2. Set the Security Level to Disallowed, and your network is
further protected from users running Google Talk.
However useful hash values are in ﬁngerprinting a known ﬁle, they
are extremely easy to alter, and users might do so without your knowl-
edge. An MD5 hash is created through a mathematical algorithm run
against the entire contents of the ﬁle. If any single bit changes in the
makeup of the data, the resulting MD5 hash will be dramatically different. 
For 
example, 
the 
MD5 
value 
of 
Google 
Talk
is
2cc9d95b519e935c53628c723c590daa. By simply changing the text to
Google 
talk
with 
a 
lowercase 
t, 
the 
MD5 
changes 
to
84a11fe43aa9a040b2071252c413c48f. The ultimate result is that any
advanced user with a hex editor can simply alter a single character or
append a space to the end of the ﬁle to throw off the MD5 signature, ren-
dering your blocking useless. Sometimes such a change might not even
be due to a user action but to an upgrade from Google, which will replace
the existing executable with a new version that has a completely different
hash value.

Enterprise Security

Some networks are small enough that slight changes to Active Directory or
the registry can mitigate any issues, but others require a more robust solution.
Some large-scale networks even require a mechanism to log all IM trafﬁc for
regulatory compliance. One such solution is provided by Akonix Inc., one of
the leading companies providing enterprise-level instant-messaging control.
The Akonix IM control platform, the Akonix L7, scans all IM trafﬁc for
spam-based trafﬁc, viruses, and phishing attacks. Not only does it work in
conjunction with Google Talk, it can also communicate with AOL Instant
Messenger,Yahoo! Messenger, ICQ, and MSN Messenger, making it a well-
rounded IM security appliance. More information on the Akonix L7 can be

Summary
As Google Talk and the instant messaging world as a whole becomes more
popular, more organizations seek to ﬁnd efﬁcient ways to implement it.
Instant messaging is quickly being recognized as a valuable tool in the work
place as a medium for information exchange and discussion among teams and
divisions. It allows for travelers and off-site workers to effortlessly communi-
cate with their coworkers from afar on both menial and urgent situations.
Implementing Google Talk within your enterprise environment is not
particularly difﬁcult, as Google designed the software to be extremely easy to
install and conﬁgure.The Google Talk stand-alone client could be installed
manually on every machine in your workplace, or automated with a
Microsoft MSI installation package. MSI packages can be easily created with
tools such as InstallShield, or even open-source applications like WiX.
Microsoft even releases their own products to help create MSI ﬁles, located
within their operating system Software Development Kit (SDK).After
installing the client on the computers within your network, you could allow
your users to create their own usernames for usage, or have a set of accounts
pre-established and conﬁgured on their machines.There is just a simple
matter of adding two registry keys to tell the local Google Talk client to use a
particular user name, and the creation of these keys can be automated
throughout your network using examples shown in this chapter.
With the client installed, only a few ports need to be punched open on
your network to allow the client to communicate with Google Talk’s server.
Primarily, the clients must be able to resolve and connect to talk.google.com.
The standard Jabber connection ports for encrypted trafﬁc are used, port 5222
for SSL and 5223 for TLS, and need to be made available to the clients.
Should they fail to connect on these, the clients will fall back on port 443,
which is normally open on most networks for HTTPS trafﬁc.
As easy as it is to install Google Talk on your network, blocking it may
prove more difﬁcult.The actual Google Talk application can be stopped by
implementing registry keys and group policies that prevent Windows from
executing the client in most situations. However, these blocks can easily be
circumvented by advanced computer users who know to rename the exe-
cutable, move it to another directory, or somehow alter the hash value of the
www.syngress.com

ﬁle. It may be far easier just to allow the clients to be installed, but block the
trafﬁc from leaving your network.This can be done by setting up egress ﬁre-
wall rules and monitoring stations and blocking all connections to Google’s
known talk servers. However, this can also be circumvented by the advanced
user employing proxy servers.
The implementation of Google Talk into Google Mail has also made
enforcement even more complex, as any person who is blocked from using
the Google Talk client usually can ﬁnd access to Google Mail’s website. From
there, they can use the web-based Google Talk client.
For network administrators who do implement Google Talk into their
network, but require additional monitoring capabilities for liability concerns
and regulatory compliance, there are a number of solutions available.The
most popular is the Akonix L7 network device that monitors all trafﬁc for
instant messaging communications and maintains logs of every bit of detail
that crosses them. Not only can it scan IM trafﬁc for viruses and spam, but
you also almost implement rules that forbid discussion of certain keywords,
such as internal work products. FaceTime Communications also provides an
equivalent solution through their FaceTime IMAuditor that meshes well with
their entire line of enterprise security solutions.

Q: I tried using WiX to create an MSI ﬁle, but it was extremely complicated!
I’m lost!
A: WiX is one of the most powerful applications made to allow common
administrators to create MSI ﬁles. However, with great power comes great
complexity.The easiest way to use WiX is with the Votive Visual Studio
package. It allows you to use your Visual Studio 2005 install to easily
create your projects. More information on that topic can be found at
http://wix.sourceforge.net/votive.html. For those of you who can’t afford
Visual Studio or who want an easier way, check out WixEdit at
http://wixedit.sourceforge.net, a free and open-source front end to WiX.
Furthermore, Microsoft hosted a chat session on just this subject; the tran-
scripts of that talk are located at http://msdn.microsoft.com/chats/tran-
scripts/windows/windows_110904a.aspx.
Q: Is WiX an active project or one of those open-source apps that’s been

Q: My supervisor wants us to block all Google Talk trafﬁc, but some of our
users are using proxies to bypass our rules. What can we do to stop them?
A: You have a variety of ways to tackle this issue.The easiest and most
expensive way is to buy a network appliance to monitor proxy usage, such
as the 8e6 R3000 Internet Filter, from www.8e6.com/products/R3000/.
A cheaper but more labor-intensive method is to monitor the trafﬁc on
your network using tools such as WireShark (www.wireshark.org) for
proxy use. Simply ﬁlter through all the trafﬁc for Jabber protocol trafﬁc,
and that might lead you right to the problematic users.At that point,
target the users who are abusing your network policy.The third option,
being the cheapest and easiest, is to simply do nothing. If the problem is
not out of control and productivity is not being affected, many adminis-
trators end up allowing the advanced minority of users to retain their chat
access.

Introduction
While the majority of this book teaches you to use Google Talk for text and voice
communications, this appendix and the next expand on video conferencing software,
which was introduced in Chapter 5. Now, before we help you understand what you
need to make video calls, let’s discuss the various ﬂavors of videoconferencing so that
you have a clear understanding of the differences among the various videoconfer-
encing solutions. We divide these videoconferencing types into three categories:
■
Personal videoconferencing
■
Business videoconferencing
■
Web videoconferencing
These solutions can be software that you use with your computer, stand-alone
hardware, or combined software and hardware solutions.They all have one thing in
common: they allow you to make a video call of some sort using various features.
Personal Videoconferencing
This appendix focuses primarily on personal videoconferencing solutions, or what we
call video calls. We use the term personal because these calls are usually between only
two people—you and the person you are communicating with.A video call, at min-
imum, is simply the communication between two or more people who have both
audio and a moving video image using a computer, dedicated video telephone, or
both. It may also include additional features such as instant messaging (IM) and ﬁle
transfers (FT), commonly found in many IM tools such as Skype, iChat AV, MSN
Messenger (MSN),Yahoo Instant Messenger (YIM), and AOL Instant Messenger
(AIM).Though we will discuss business videoconferencing and Web videoconfer-
encing so that you can understand the basic differences among them, we focus on
personal videoconferencing solutions, from here on referred to simply as video calls.
This will help simplify what we are addressing in this book: the ability of making
video calls between two people to better communicate and enhance the communi-
cation experience.
Business Videoconferencing
Business videoconferencing can involve the same solutions as personal videoconfer-
encing but with the addition of several features:
■
The capability to include multiple people on the video call
www.syngress.com
196
Appendix A • Introduction to Video Calling

■
Collaboration features
■
Document-sharing capabilities
■
Enhanced presentation capabilities
■
Whiteboard capabilities
■
Additional bandwidth requirements
■
Additional costs
Business videoconferencing is speciﬁcally designed to meet the needs of business
meetings and group collaboration, not our personal needs to communicate with
family and friends. Business videoconferencing solutions are more expensive and as a
general rule need more equipment at the ofﬁce location as well as more network
and/or Internet bandwidth than we have available to us at home.
Business videoconferencing solutions do have single-user solutions for mobile
users or telecommuters, such as solutions from PolyCom, Sony, and others.These
solutions are designed to communicate with higher-end and more expensive solu-
tions that you would see in your business conference room at work.
Web Videoconferencing
Web videoconferencing is speciﬁcally designed to transmit a video call inside a Web
page or classroom-type environment.You might have seen Web videoconferencing
employed in a Web training seminar, or Webinar as they are called, where you saw
the presenter’s video image streamed to your Web browser.You might have been
sending your video image as well, but most likely not, because Webinars tend to
comprise one-way video to you. Solutions such as WebEx and Microsoft Live
Communication Server are two Web conferencing solutions.These solutions are also
designed to record a session and post it to a Web site for on-demand viewing any
time via a video stream to your browser.
What Is a Video Call?
Video call technology can have many names: video calls, personal videoconferencing,
videoconferencing, video messaging, instant messaging, video phone, video tele-
phone, and video chat.The name any one technology goes by might be due to a
vendor’s product and its marketing, but it should be understood that all the tech-
nologies are basically the same and essentially interchangeable; only the features vary.
A video call is the total experience that two people can have while communicating
www.syngress.com

197

with one another using audio and a moving video image, and possibly additional
features.
Understanding the Basics…
What Is a Video Call?
A video call is a call between two people that includes both audio and a moving
video image; can take place between two computers or dedicated video tele-
phone equipment. 
Most of us have used e-mail and even IM solutions such as Google Talk, Skype,
iChat AV, MSN,AIM,YIM, or others.These IM solutions let you chat between two
or more people, voice chat or talk between two or more people, and now even do a
video call between two people. Some solutions are better than others, however; this
Appendix will help you select a solution that will allow you to have a good video
call experience the very ﬁrst time you use it.
A video call can utilize one or more of the following devices:
■
A personal computer (PC), either Windows or Apple
■
A Webcam
■
A video telephone
■
A dedicated videoconferencing device
■
A Pocket PC, Palmtop, or other handheld device
■
Cell phones with picture and/or video capability
■
Digital cameras
■
Video recording devices
Imagine the ability to talk to someone far away and actually see the person you
are talking with using live video. Picture yourself being able to play an Internet
game while participating in a video call that lets you not only see the individual
you’re playing with but also send funny comments via IM while waiting for your
turn. Or imagine being able to send family members photos or, even better, video
clips of the latest family outing.

Appendix A • Introduction to Video Calling

The experience of communicating with family and friends when you are busy
or if live in a different city is becoming a more robust experience with the tech-
nologies and solutions available today.As young as the Internet is, imagine the
improvements that await us in the future!
The most important component of a video call is the video. Video is the main
improvement over a conventional telephone call. With the addition of video, seeing
the person you are speaking to enhances the experience and expands the possibili-
ties.You can actually show the person on the other end what you can only verbalize
during a telephone call.
According to www.whatis.com, the term videoconferencing is deﬁned as,“A live
connection between people in separate locations for the purpose of communication,
usually involving audio and often text as well as video.At its simplest, videoconfer-
encing provides transmission of static images and text between two locations.At its
most sophisticated, it provides transmission of full-motion video images and high-
quality audio between multiple locations.”
With the Internet today, along with inexpensive high-speed or broadband
Internet, as it is called for home use, video calls are no longer something reserved for
the business or corporate world.The ﬁrst successful videoconferencing solution for a
personal computer was Microsoft NetMeeting. IM solutions such as those from
Skype,Apple, Microsoft,Yahoo, and AOL added improvements including video,
making video calls more mainstream then ever before. In fact, Microsoft and
Logitech report they have already had over 3 billion Webcam session chats with
MSN Messenger (www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2005/mar05/03-09log-
itechpr.mspx). Remember, MSN Messenger is only one of over 30 video call solu-
tions.
To make a video call, you need a broadband Internet connection (high-speed
Internet). It should be understood that in a video call, the speed of the Internet con-
nection becomes very important. Dialup access will not provide you a very good
solution, so do not even bother trying.Although there is one solution that relies on
a regular telephone line, video needs more bandwidth than dialup can provide.
Do you think video calls are too complicated? While reading this, are you
thinking that you or your child, friends, or family do not know how to use a com-
puter very well, let alone make a video call? For the less computer savvy user there
are video call solutions that do not use a computer, such as dedicated video tele-
phone devices; some devices use only your television, a device set on top of your
television connected to your broadband Internet connection, and a remote to con-
trol the video call.
If you are already computer literate or willing to use a computer, there are many
more things you can do with a Windows or Apple computer equipped for video

calls.You can do IM, send photos, help your children with their homework, talk to
your parents, play games, send video and pictures to your children, friends, or
family—and more important, they can send these things to you!
Imagine coming home from a day at work and having your son send you a
video clip from his football practice, or your daughter from her gymnastics class.
Imagine being a business traveler and while in your hotel room, be able to see and
speak to family and friends while you are traveling. Imagine if you are a divorced
parent the potential beneﬁts of a video call with your children who live in another
city or state. Using video call technology, I read my daughter bedtime stories when
she was four years old, and she was 1400 miles away! Now she is seven and reads
stories to me. Even though we are not home together, we can participate in our
children’s lives or communicate with family and friends more than ever before,
thanks to video calls.
A recent study by HarrisInteractive.com found that roughly a third (30 percent)
of U.S. adults live in a different state than their mothers.Although 66 percent of
these adults speak to their mothers at least once a week on the phone, 84 percent
would prefer to talk face-to-face with their family and friends rather than use the
phone. Unfortunately, 87 percent of these adults also report that they see their moms
only once a month or less (www.motorola.com/mediacenter/news/detail/
0,,6088_6049_23,00.html). With your computer and a Webcam, video telephone,
cell phone, and other upcoming technologies, a video call with your children, family,
and friends will improve your communication experience more then can be
achieved with a telephone call alone.
Where Can You Perform Video Calls?
You can carry out video calls at home or anywhere a high-speed Internet connec-
tion, some privacy, and the proper hardware and software are available. Since the
camera and headset are small, all you need is a computer and software. For this dis-
cussion, we assume that a computer is available.The video call software is the core of
personal videoconferencing. It enables you and the other party to see as well as hear
one another.
You need to consider two things when selecting a solution for your personal
videoconferencing needs:
■
Where will you use it?
■
Are there special conﬁguration needs?

Appendix A • Introduction to Video Calling

As a business traveler, I often ﬁnd that during my down time I would like to
participate in video calls with my family and friends.To do this I must have a solu-
tion that will work wherever I am. I could be in a hotel, an airport, a friend’s home,
or an Internet café. I need a solution that will work no matter where I am and no
matter whose computer I am using.
So where can the business traveler go to do personal videoconferencing? There
are lots of options. Hotels are the best because they have high-speed connections for
all the hotel guests. I stay at Marriott and Courtyard by Marriott because they have
consistent high-speed connections at a reasonable price, or free in many cases, now
that hotels are using high-speed Internet access to attract customers.
Where else can you do personal videoconferencing when you’re on the road? At
any airport that has a “laptop lane” or other road warrior laptop hookup service.
Many airports have WiFi access available in the general waiting area for a daily use
fee, but you will not have much privacy. Some airlines actually have high-speed
access on the planes on international ﬂights, so you could even pass the time having
a video call with your family, friends, or colleagues at 30,000 feet.
As I mentioned, Internet cafés have computers and high-speed connections, and
some I have visited even have Webcams. However, the connection speeds are usually
not that good, with everyone else using the other computers doing gaming and
such, and it is not very private.You will have to ask the business for permission to
install the video call software you use on their system.
If you are a frequent ﬂyer and belong to one of the elite ﬂyers clubs such as
Delta’s Crown Room, United’s Red Carpet Room, and others, they are now starting
to offer wireless access for a fee so that you can work while waiting for a ﬂight.
Some airlines are the latest to offer wireless broadband for international ﬂights.
Boeing is planning a service called Connexion that will start to show up on
domestic ﬂights in the future.This brings up an interesting point about privacy, not
only for you but for others sitting next or around you.You will probably want pri-
vacy when you make a video call, but what about the person sitting next to you?
They might not want to be bothered by your video conversation after they get over
the novelty of it; they might want to rest or sleep, so you must practice proper eti-
quette and not invade their privacy.You can ﬁnd more on Boeing’s Connexion ser-
vice at the following Web site: www.connexionbyboeing.com/.
Starbucks and many other WiFi “hotspots” also have high-speed wireless con-
nections that could allow you to do a video call, but these places are often crowded,
noisy, and not private. Many hotel lobbies have wireless access and can provide a
comfortable and somewhat private place to make a video call. Please see Appendix B
for a detailed discussion of free video call software.

Overview
In this appendix we will discuss in some detail most of the video call software solutions cur-
rently available.We touch on more than 40 video call software solutions; if we miss one or
two solutions, either they have a vertical application or they are not widely used.
Now we will try to make sense of the plethora of solutions that exist in the software
video call space so you can start to select what you need for your particular needs. We
deﬁned personal videoconferencing, business videoconferencing, and Web videoconfer-
encing. Just know that anything that sends audio and video is a possibility for personal
videoconferencing. We will only show screenshots and details of the better solutions, which
are those that rate 4 or 5. Since we are trying to help you select a solution, we will do so by
the categories and ratings. Of course, you are free to select anything you want and try it to
see if a particular solution works for you.Also, because the solutions in this chapter are free,
we recommend using multiple solutions because you may ﬁnd that some of your family and
friends will like solutions for certain reasons. I use MSN Messenger, Skype, and SightSpeed
on my Windows systems and iChat AV and SightSpeed on my Mac and they all coexist just
ﬁne.
Because there are so many solutions, we need to somehow divide up the solutions into
a few categories so that we may better compare or classify them for an easy comparison in
their focus area. We have divided up the solutions into two main areas: Free video call solu-
tions (those that are completely free) and commercial video call solutions (those that have a
fee or cost associated with them). Commercial solutions may also have a free option
(SightSpeed, for example) and charge you for additional features.To further break down the
solutions, we have created several categories that will be used to assign each solution to a
primary focus.These categories are:
■
One-on-one video call solutions
■
Multiuser video call solutions
■
Multi-IM video call solutions
■
SIP-based video call solutions
■
H.323-based video call solutions
■
Chat room video call solutions
■
Other video call solutions
204
Appendix B • Free Video Call Software

Of course, we cannot go into great detail on all the solutions, but we did test all of
them over the course of the past two years, so we were able to get a good idea of what the
solutions are all about. We were also able to evaluate the basic video call functions each
solution has. Video call software is fairly easy to evaluate: we look at how easy it is to install,
how a user connects to the solution, how easy the solution is to use, and, of course, the
quality of the video call. Very quickly a person can determine if a solution will work for
their particular needs.The criteria we use contain the following items:
■
“Work Anywhere” conﬁguration
■
Ease of installation and conﬁguration
■
An easy interface or ease of use 
■
Audio quality
■
Video quality
■
See both sending and receiving video screens in an acceptable size
■

One-on-One Video Call Solutions
Personal videoconferencing is a video call between two people. Can it be more? Yes, it can
be, and we will discuss that more in the next section. We have to start somewhere and
having a one-on-one or two-person video call is the place to start. We have all heard the
saying,“We must crawl before we can walk before we can run.” Since most one-on-one or
Free Video Call Software • Appendix B
205

two-person video call solutions are free, it makes sense to start with a two-party video call,
get it working, and then add functionality or the capability of additional people later.
Making one-on-one video calls that work well and consistently will enable you to try
other solutions and add functions like additional people to your video call experience.The
following table contains a list of free solutions that are capable of a two-person video call,
how we rate them, what version was rated, comments, what operating systems are sup-
ported, and how many people the solution can handle in a video call. Make note that what
you get for free may just be a two-person video call and that the commercial version may
be how you get multiparty video calls.
AOL Instant Messenger 
(AIM 5.9) and AOL Triton (BETA)
AOL is one of the more popular Instant Messaging solutions that also has video call capa-
bility.AIM, as it is called, has recently gone through a major upgrade from version 5.9 to
what is now called AIM Triton.The amount of advertising and the invasive nature of the
advertising are really annoying. Usually, when a product goes through a large change as this
206
Appendix B • Free Video Call Software

one has, it gets easier and cleaner to use. In AIM Triton’s case, I think they took a step 
backwards.AIM Triton is not very easy to use and there are no options to conﬁgure the
video settings.
If you want to make video calls with Apple iChat AV users, you are out of luck with
the new AIM Triton version, for now, anyway.You can still use AIM version 5.9 to make
video calls with Apple iChat AV users, but in order to have a video call, you will need to
open up the ports on your DSL/cable router as described in Appendix A. Currently you can
only make video calls between AIM Triton users and not with either AIM version 5.9 users
or Apple iChat AV users, so AOL has a lot of work to do.
We believe they should not have released this version until all the features were working
as expected.The video in AIM Triton is also still in BETA and not ﬁnalized and the frame
rate is slow.Though I like the fact that in AIM Triton the video screen is adjustable in size
and has a picture-in-picture that you can place anywhere within the video screen. If you
double-click anywhere in the video screen you get both images in an angled view, very
similar to how iChat AV works. I expect AOL will improve this over time and the bugs will
be worked out and function as it should.The video, even though it is not working well in
this version, is far better than AIM 5.9.The rating reﬂects the BETA version and issues as of
June 2006. I expect by the end of 2006,AIM Triton will improve to a score of 3, maybe
even 4, so watch the Web site for an update to this rating.Also, Google has invested in AOL,
so expect that GoogleTalk will interact with AIM in the future and possibly even video calls
as well.

Apple iChat AV
Apple iChat AV is a great video call application for Mac-only users because there is cur-
rently no Windows client for iChat AV.You can have video calls with Windows AIM ver-
sion 5.9 users, but it is not ﬁrewall friendly and the video in AIM 5.9 is really poor.
Hopefully, when AOL gets AIM Triton updated to work with iChat AV, this should be a
good combination for Mac-to-Windows video calls. We have provided a link to an article
that describes how to make iChat-to-AIM video calls.The image quality of the iChat video
is top notch and the frame rate is good as well. If you only need Mac–to-Mac video calls,
this solution is the best option for you. Paired with the iSight webcam, this is a great video

Festoon
Festoon is a plug-in for Skype and GoogleTalk to add video call capabilities to these two IM
solutions. Festoon integrates and uses Skype and GoogleTalk as their contact list that you
would initiate a video call from (for an additional Skype reference, please see Appendix C).
Santa Cruz Networks had a consumer solution called VidiTel and Festoon is the replacement
for the consumer market. Festoon enables you to have a two-person video call and a mul-
tiuser video call as well. Festoon is very ﬁrewall friendly, so no special conﬁguration needed
because it uses ports 80 and 443. See Chapter 5 for more on Festoon.
In order to integrate Festoon with GoogleTalk or Skype, you will ﬁrst have to install
GoogleTalk and/or Skype and then install Festoon to integrate Festoon into these two IM
solutions.After Festoon starts, be sure to manually set your webcam under Tools |
Options. In the pictures below, you can see that Festoon adds the 
icon to GoogleTalk
and the 
icon to Skype.
208
Appendix B • Free Video Call Software

After Festoon is installed, all you need to do is right-click the 
icon in the taskbar
and select Start a video call and you will see the following screen that shows the Skype
users and GoogleTalk users that are available for a video call. Of course, the contact you
select needs to have Festoon installed to participate in a video call, but Festoon provides you
a Share Festoon with a friend option so you can invite your IM contacts to use Festoon.

Festoon will IM your contact with a URL to select to start a video call if you have
Festoon and a URL to get Festoon if your contact is not a user, as shown in the following
Skype IM screenshot.
After Festoon starts, you will have a two-person video call.The following screenshot
shows the typical test we used throughout this appendix.
210
Appendix B • Free Video Call Software

Festoon also provides video effects options called EyeCandy that enables you to add
video effects to your video calls. Festoon also enables multiuser video calls including your-
self. Festoon will be adding support for video calls with other IM solutions for AIM, MSN,
and Yahoo in the future, making this one of the better multiuser IM video call solutions.

IVisit Lite
IVisit Lite, the free version of iVisit, is a good solution for Windows and Mac video calls.
The free version limits the size of the video window to 160x120 pixels and only 60 minutes
of video calls every 90 minutes.The user interface is not all that friendly and the quality is
only average in the free version, but iVisit is a good solution for both Windows and Mac
users. IVisit is ﬁrewall friendly.

Microsoft MSN Messenger 7.5 
(Windows Live Messenger 8.0 BETA)
Microsoft MSN Messenger is one of the best free solutions available for free video calls. We
will be showing Windows Live Messenger 8.0 BETA in the screenshots because this is the
replacement for MSN Messenger 7.5. Know that Windows Live Messenger 8.0 has every-
thing MSN Messenger 7.5 does and it is up to you to decide what to use.The new Live
BETA is compatible with MSN Messenger 7.5 for video calls. We always recommend that
you use the latest released version and avoid BETA solutions because BETAs do have bugs
that may cause you some issues. Windows Live Messenger or MSN Messenger is also avail-
able in just about every language you might need.
One good thing about MSN Messenger 7.5 is that it runs on Windows XP, Windows
2000, and Windows 9.x systems, so it’s good for older versions of Windows. I expect
Windows Live Messenger will work only for Windows XP or later, so be aware of this
requirement. Of course, I always recommend the latest version of Windows XP fully
updated with the latest security patches for video calls because there are signiﬁcant features
Windows XP has that video call solutions will use.
Free Video Call Software • Appendix B
211

When you establish a video call by selecting the 
icon for Live Messenger and the 
icon for MSN Messenger within an IM window, Messenger auto senses the band-
width available and slows the frame rate to match the broadband connection while
maintaining a great image quality. When someone invites you to a video call, you will see
the following screen. Just select Accept to start the video call.
Messenger has one of the best quality images available. It can maintain the image quality
even with a slower frame-rate adjustment that the application chooses based on the speed of
the Internet connection and the user cannot adjust. Messenger has three video window sizes
and a full-screen mode.To select which window size you want, just click the icon and select
Size, and then select one of the three options for your window or four options for the top
window of the other party, Small (pictured below), Medium, Large, or Full Screen for the
top image only.

After you select Large, you will see a good video call.The following screenshot shows a
sample I use to test video quality and the sender of course is yours truly.This way there is
something constant in each of the screenshots with my test picture for each solution. In the
following screenshot I am using Windows Live Messenger 8.0 with the Philips SPC900NC
webcam and the test image is on MSN Messenger 7.5 with a Logitech 5000 webcam on a
cloudy rainy day.
In order to get a Full Screen image, select the 
icon from the drop-down.
Free Video Call Software • Appendix B
213

To undo Full Screen, just select the 
icon and you are taken back to the IM window
view. Be aware that, in Full Screen, the image will stretch on a wide screen.
If you have any issues with the audio portion of a Messenger video call, you can use
different audio solution such as Skype for just the audio portion.The advantage of this is
that Skype provides great audio calls and the capability of having a ﬁve-person audio con-
ference call, and if you have the proper hardware, a 10-person audio conference call.This
would enable you, for example, to be in a video portion only call using Messenger with a
friend or family member and then add multiple people to the audio portion though Skype
to ask a question or plan the weekend events—of course, you can only see one person in
Messenger. I often use this combination if I ﬁnd that the Messenger audio does not work
well or I am in a really poor location with a slow broadband connection. Usually Messenger
audio works ﬁne.
Messenger is ﬁrewall friendly if your DSL/cable router supports and has uPnP enabled.
Windows Live Messenger version 8.0 was renamed as a part of the new Microsoft Windows
Live™solutions that you can visit at: http://ideas.live.com. Windows Live Messenger 8.0
adds a new look but does not change the video call capabilities we are used to in MSN
Messenger 7.5. We highly recommend this video call solution as a part of your video call
solutions. Messenger works only with Windows systems. MSN and AOL, however, have
agreed to interconnect their IM users so that you can IM with AIM users from MSN and
visa-versa, but I doubt that video calls will be a part of the agreement to link the two
Instant Messaging solutions.

SightSpeed
SightSpeed is arguably the best-featured and best-designed video call solution available
today with both a Windows and Mac version.The free version is limited to a two-person
video call, but the interface is wonderful, easy to use, and provides a very good experience.
SightSpeed is easy to use and conﬁgure and has a great optimization tool to enable you to
adjust your video during install or afterwards if you change webcams, for example.
SightSpeed enables you to have video calls, of course, but you can also send a video
mail message of 30 seconds stored for 30 days with the free version so you have a way to
leave a message if one of your contacts is ofﬂine or you just want to send a quick message.
214
Appendix B • Free Video Call Software

The video mail is not sent to you in a large e-mail; rather, it is stored on the SightSpeed
server and only a short message telling you that you have a video mail message waiting is
sent to you. In addition, you can send video mail to other SightSpeed users or any Internet
e-mail address. SightSpeed is also ﬁrewall friendly, so will work most anywhere.
The following screenshot is the main interface and you can see an Inbox tab where any
messages you receive will be stored, a Chat tab where you can send a quick IM to a con-
tact, and the BETA Community tab where you can search for other SightSpeed users.There
are also buttons to check your account, manage your contacts, start a multiuser call (Pro ver-
sion only), create a video mail message, and take you back to the home screen.
So start a video call, you just select the user name and then you have three choices:
Start a video call,
Send a video e-mail, or 
Send IM. Just double-click the user
name to call your contact or select one of the icons for the action you want to perform.
The following screenshot shows the basic interface once you are in a video call. In the fol-
lowing screenshot I am using SightSpeed 4.5 with the Philips SPC900NC webcam and the
test image is on SightSpeed 4.5 with a Logitech 5000 webcam on a cloudy, rainy day.

SightSpeed also allows for Full Screen by selecting the 
icon from the Video
Controls menu and the Esc key to return.You also have the option of removing your pic-
ture-in-picture, pausing the video, or switching to the Video Only view as the following
screen shows.
216
Appendix B • Free Video Call Software

The Video Only view is adjustable to any size you like. Be aware that on wide screens
like my laptop, the Full Screen picture gets stretched, so Video Only mode is better because
it keeps the ratio for wide screens. SightSpeed is robust and well designed; actually the best-
designed interface and features of any of the video call solutions and is what all video call
solutions should shoot for.The only drawback SightSpeed might have is the video codec
they use could have a sharper image, but I expect they will improve this in a matter of time
and really blow your socks off.This is a GREAT solution and I highly recommend you try
it and add it to your video call solutions suite. Since you can also use SightSpeed with Mac
users, this is a perfect solution for the Windows and Mac video call users that have family
and friends they would like to communicate with using either operating system.

Skype 2.0
Skype adding video has taken video calls to the next level with users of the famed voice
application adding video call capability. Skype, by the way, works only with Windows XP, so
you are out of luck unless you are up to date with the latest Windows operating system.Yes,
Microsoft Vista is coming out and anything that is compatible with Windows XP should be
compatible with Windows Vista as well. I have two issues with the video. One is the
extremely small picture-in-picture where you cannot see if you are in focus or if what you
are holding up is in focus to the person you are in a video call with.
The second issue I have is that Skype is primarily a VoIP solution that enables you to
make free or inexpensive voice calls over the Internet and many Skypers have multiple
audio devices connected to their computers for Skype. In my case, I have a gateway that
enables me to use Skype with my home cordless telephone so that I can make and receive
Skype calls anywhere my normal cordless phone works, like my sofa, the kitchen, or the
garage.The reason this is an issue for video calls is that it takes me eight mouse clicks to
change from my VoSky Internet Phone Wizard (IPW) to my sound card so that I can have
a video call and I must do this before I answer the video call, so it is a real pain and often I
do not make it in time to answer the video call.
218
Appendix B • Free Video Call Software

To make a video call, you just select one of your contacts. By default, when you
double-click a contact, you call them. I tell people to change double-click to “Start a chat”
so you do not accidentally call a user every time.To initiate a video call with one of your
contacts, select them in the contact window and press the 
icon from the main window
or from within the chat window to place the call. Once in the call you will see the fol-
lowing screen.
Free Video Call Software • Appendix B
219

To start the video portion of the call just click the Start My Video button
and you will see both parties’ video if they too selected Start My Video as the
following screen shows.
Skype provides multiple ways to view the video portion of the call.You can either see it
in the main window or, if you select Video in Window, you will see the following screen.
220
Appendix B • Free Video Call Software

After a few seconds the black menu options will disappear until you drag your mouse
over the window.The following screen shows the same screen without the menu items.
As you can see, the picture-in-picture is ridiculously small to be at all practical except to
know you are indeed sending video. We would prefer if the small sender window had an
option to be larger. Skype also supports Full Screen as the following screen shows.
Fortunately, Skype keeps the screen ration so when Full Screen is used it does not
stretch like MSN Messenger does. Skype does enable you to set if the video starts automati-
Free Video Call Software • Appendix B
221

cally with every call and even a way to test and select the webcam from the Tools |
Options menu. Just select Video (BETA) and you will see the following screen.
Here you can enable or disable video, set and test your webcam, and adjust if it will start
automatically or who you can send and receive video to. Currently, Skype video is 15fps
and uses the On2 video codec, the same codec that Macromedia Flash uses, so a very good
one.
With the two issues I have with Skype video aside, since not everyone will have mul-
tiple audio devices for Skype and do not need the picture-in-picture to be larger, Skype’s
video is very good and provides for an adjustable screen and full screen capability. Skype’s
addition of video has really caused video calls to be more popular as I see more and more of
my contacts add webcams to use Skype’s video call option. I expect Skype will ﬁx my issues
over time and make Skype one of the best solutions available for a one-on-one video call
solution. I must say the reason I rated Skype a 4 is because of the lack of a Mac client and
the two issues I personally have with it, and I know many of my fellow Skypers that want
to interact with their children and parents as I do want these two items improved as well.
Skype is also very ﬁrewall friendly and will work almost anywhere.

Spontania Video4IM
Video4IM is a plug-in for Skype that only adds video capability. Video4IM relies 100% on
Skype for your contacts and the audio portion of the video call.The thing I like about
Video4IM is that it has a much better picture-in-picture than Skype and it is fairly easy to
use. If the name indicates anything, I expect that Spontania will add additional video capa-
bility to other IM solutions like AIM, MSN, GoogleTalk, and Yahoo so that you can have a
video call with any user from any IM, but that is only a guess at this point based on the
name.
To make a video call with Video4IM you install Skype ﬁrst and then install Video4IM
and conﬁgure it. I recommend that once installed you change the default settings of
Video4IM. From the menu, select Options | Video Device Setup and you will see the
following screen.
Change the settings to Enable DirectX capture and select your webcam from the
Select video device drop-down and click Accept to accept your changes. Now you are
using the Windows XP video beneﬁts, the reason we recommend Windows XP. If you want
to see the difference, play with the settings and I think you will see there is a signiﬁcant dif-
ference in quality. If you want to have Video4IM start when you start Skype, select Run
with Skype from the Options menu and if you want to automatically start video when
you start a Skype call, select Start with any video call and Video4IM will start when you
make a Skype audio call.
Video4IM checks to see if your Skype contact has Video4IM. If they do not, Video4IM
will send the user an IM message inviting them to download Video4IM. If your Skype con-
tact does have Video4IM, then you will be invited to have a video call as shown in the fol-
lowing screen.
Free Video Call Software • Appendix B
223

After you select Start, you will be in a video call, as shown in the following screen.
As you can see, the picture-in-picture is larger and you can see the sender image better
than in Skype. Video4IM also allows for the sender’s screen to be detached from the main
window by selecting the 
icon, as shown in the following screen.
224
Appendix B • Free Video Call Software

To select Full Screen, select the 
icon and you can have a full screen video call as
the following screen shows.
To switch back to the normal screen, just select the 
icon and you will be back to
the main interface.Also, the full screen keeps the proper aspect ratio and will not stretch like
MSN Messenger does.
Video4IM is a very good add-on for Skype to add video with full screen and a good
picture-in-picture option to improve what Skype provides.This is another free solution I
Free Video Call Software • Appendix B

would recommend to add to your video call solution suite. Video4IM is also ﬁrewall
friendly and will work most anywhere.

WigiWigi—Vwho
There is a project that I have been involved with as a tester that Ashod Apakin has been
working on that has promise. I have been a tester from the beginning and really like what
Ashod is doing, but Vwho is still currently in development. WigiWigi is a completely self
contained application. It does not rely on any drivers, dlls, DirectX, OpenGL, or third-party
components.As a result, WigiWigi will run under all versions of Windows and more impor-
tantly will run on a barebones Windows environment, such as the ones used in mobile
devices or where resources are kept to a bare minimum like a kiosk.Additionally, WigiWigi
is a very compact application, taking up no more than 500KB in ﬁle size, and requires no
installation. It is very common for Internet users to pass the WigiWigi program to friends
using IM ﬁle transfer and immediately start a video call.
Over the past year, WigiWigi has undergone some major improvements in terms of
speed with a signiﬁcant improvement in frame rate up to 45fps over a 128KBs connection
with the DVD-quality version. WigiWigi has the ability to conduct a full-speed video call
with broadband connections as low as 128KBs, like slower DSL connections.Ashod hopes
to have the Vwho Pro version with true DVD quality available in the near future.The Free
version is called Vwho Lite. Vwho will also have an API so application developers can
imbed Vwho into their application.The following screenshot is my typical test setup.

Yahoo Instant Messenger is one of the oldest solutions to have video capability.
Unfortunately, the latest version of YIM has a terrible video call solution. In order to get the

the video image is slow and just not worth using.

Multiuser Video Call Solutions
Many of us want options to have more than two people on a video call. With higher-speed
broadband options like that which you can get from your cable provider and faster DSL
options, having multiple people on a video call is an option. In the free space there are only
three solutions that we already covered in the one-on-one video call section, but we will
focus on the multiuser portion features of the video call.
Apple iChat AV
As we already stated,Apple iChat AV is a great video call application for Mac-only systems
because there is no Windows client for iChat AV.You can have up to four users in a video
call if you have the system to support it. Multiuser video calls with AIM is not an option at
this time.The following table shows what the system requirements are to have a four-person
video call with iChat AV.

add video call capabilities to these two IM solutions. Festoon enables you to have a mul-
tiuser video call as well for up to six users at a time. Festoon will be adding support for
video calls with other IM solutions for AIM, MSN, and Yahoo in the future, making this
one of the better multiuser IM video call solutions. Festoon is very ﬁrewall friendly, so no
special conﬁguration is needed since it uses ports 80 and 443.

Multi-IM Video Call Solutions
Multi-IM video call solutions are ones that have the capability to add your login and pass-
word of each IM solution so that you do not have to use multiple IM applications. Multi-
IM solutions are used to centralize all your IM contacts from AIM, ICQ, MSN, and Yahoo,
sometimes even Skype, into one tool. In fact, our tech editor uses one of these tools for
AIM,Yahoo, and MSN. Now you can only do IM, but some even allow some video to
work between solutions, but my testing has showed this is basically a waste of time. Unless
the contact you want to have a video call with is using the same multi-IM solution such as
Trillian, do not bother to try a video call between Trillan and AIM for example.The main
reason is the revision cycle and if you get it to work, it will most likely stop working when
one of the solutions updates something. Even if it does work, none of the multi-IM solu-
tions provided a good enough video call to make a rating of 4 or 5 except for Festoon and
Vwho. Use these for what they were intended and that is to use one application to cen-
tralize your IM contacts.

EyeBall Chat
EyeBall Chat is a basic video call solution. One thing EyeBall Chat can do is enable you to
see your AIM, MSN, and Yahoo buddies in one tool to IM with. Only if your AIM, MSN,
and Yahoo buddies are using EyeBall Chat will you be able to have a video call.This solu-
tion has access to chat rooms without any parental controls so if you are a parent and con-
cerned about your children accessing a chat room, and you should be, this is not a solution
you should allow a child access to. I have a simple recommendation about public chat-
room-based solutions: chat rooms are dangerous for children and so this product needs
parental guidance if used by children. More on chat-room-based solutions in the Chat
Room Based Video Call Solutions section later in this appendix. EyeBall Chat is ﬁrewall
friendly.

add video call capabilities to these two IM solutions. Festoon enables you to have a mul-

FWD.Communicator
Free World Dialup Communicator is a multi-IM tool and allows for video calls to other
FWD.Communicator users. FWD.Communicator can see your AIM, ICQ, Jabber, MSN,
GoogleTalk, Skype, and Yahoo contacts for Instant Messaging only. Since it has so many IM
options, it is one of the better multi-IM solutions, just not for video calls. If you select a
Skype contact for a voice call, FWD.Communicator will launch Skype and call that user
using the native Skype application.Anyone calling you on your FWD SIP account can con-
tact you through the FWD.Communicator client because it is a SIP softphone, but that will
be covered in the next section. One serious drawback of this video call solution is you
cannot see both the sender’s and the caller’s video windows at the same time and must

switch between the windows.This is not an acceptable feature for a video call solution.
FWD.Communicator is not ﬁrewall friendly for video calls and you will need to open ports

PalTalk Basic
PalTalk is a Multi-IM video call solution. Like with several other solutions, you can see your
AIM, ICQ, MSN, and Yahoo contacts and make video calls with them if they are also using
PalTalk. PalTalk is a chat room model and has parental controls that does enable you to set
that only G-rated chat rooms may be seen and used.As we stated already, chat rooms are
dangerous for children and so this product needs parental guidance if used by children.

Yahoo contacts and have a video call with them if they are also using QNext. QNext is one
of the only solutions that also have versions for Linux, Mac, and Windows.This product is
still in BETA, so expect a few issues and some changes in the future.The client can have up
to four (4) people in the video call and can also collaborate with ﬁle sharing and a plug-in
that enables you to control your home PC by remote. We expect that these features will not
be free in the released version.The video windows are small and cannot be adjusted.This is
an attractive client and with clients for Windows, Mac, and Linux, this is an application to
watch. QNext is not very ﬁrewall friendly.

WigiWigi Vwho is on the multi-IM space because it enables you to initiate a video call
from any IM application. It does not matter what IM tool you are using, if you can send a
contact an IM, you can have a Vwho video call.All you do is press the CTRL key three
times and your Internet-facing IP address will pop up in the IM window and the person
you are having an IM with can copy the IP address into their Vwho address bar.
After you enter your contact’s IP address and press Enter, you will start a video call. Of
course, each user must have Vwho running and each user must press CTRL, CTRL, CTRL
to send each other their IP address which needs to be pasted into the Vwho address bar.

SIP Video Call Solutions
SIP-based video call solutions are an interesting option in the video call space. SIP is the
protocol that is used in Enterprise VoIP solutions and is a way that SIP clients of all kinds
connect to a central server and connect to other SIP clients. Mostly this is for voice calls
and VoIP service providers like Vonage, Packet8, and enterprise VoIP solutions from Cisco,
Nortel, and Avaya to name a few. Software that can connect to a SIP system is called a soft-
phone and can call another softphone or a hardware VoIP SIP telephone or even make reg-
ular telephone calls to the PSTN network (MaBell) if you subscribe to a SIP service.These
softphones and telephones can also have video calls between them if the network and
clients are conﬁgured correctly. Some of the better solutions have a charge, but a few free
ones are worth discussing.
236
Appendix B • Free Video Call Software

FWD.Communicator
Free World Dialup Communicator is a multi-IM tool and allows for video calls to other
FWD.Communicator users. FWD.Communicator can see your AIM, ICQ, Jabber, MSN,
GoogleTalk, Skype, and Yahoo contacts for Instant Messaging only. If you select a Skype
contact for a voice call, FWD.Communicator will launch Skype and call that user using the
native Skype application.Anyone calling you on your FWD SIP account can contact you
through the FWD.Communicator client because it is a SIP softphone, but that will be cov-
ered in the next section. One serious drawback of this video call solution is that you cannot
see both the sender’s and the caller’s video windows at the same time and must switch
between the windows.This is not an acceptable feature for a video call solution.
FWD.Communicator is not ﬁrewall friendly for video calls and you will need to open ports
on your DSL/cable router as described in Appendix A.
The Pro version supports multiple SIP conﬁgurations and support for the open source
Asterisk SIP server.This is a bit of a technical solution and not for the faint at heart. If you
have a SIP video telephone device and conﬁgure it to use the FWD SIP Proxy, you may be
able to have a video call with an FWD.Communicator user if the codecs are supported and
the video is properly conﬁgured at the SIP Proxy; at minimum you will get an audio call.
So you may have issues using FWD.Communicator and a video telephone over the
Internet, but on an internal LAN it should work ﬁne. One drawback of this client is that
you cannot see both the sender’s and the caller’s video window at the same time and must
switch between the windows.

INEEN
INEEN is based on the CounterPath/Xten SIP softphone solution. INEEN allows calls
only with the INEEN SIP contacts and offers no out-of-network capabilities or calls to
other SIP providers. INEEN has taken the EyeBeam softphone and modiﬁed it to work
only on their network, but INEEN does allow up to ﬁve users including yourself to have a
video call. Look for more pay-per-use features to come out in the future. Until more fea-
tures come out I am not sure why this would be a solution to consider because the video
windows are small and it lacks any signiﬁcant feature needed to connect with other SIP
video telephone solutions.

Lycos Phone
Lycos, the search engine and Web portal provider, is new to the video call space and just

Phone is trying to compete with AIM, GoogleTalk, MSN, Skype, and Yahoo by adding a

advertising and you are offered several ways to get free phone call minutes by visiting the
advertiser’s information or you can just purchase minutes to make PC-to-telephone calls.
The interface is busy and a little difﬁcult to navigate, though expect some changes as this
product gets updated from feedback and use.The video windows are small with no option

Yak Virtual Videophone
Yak is based on the CounterPath/Xten SIP softphone solution. Like INEEN,Yak only
enables video calls with other Yak contacts and no out-of-network capabilities or calls to
other SIP providers.Yak has taken the EyeBeam softphone and modiﬁed it to work only on
their network, but does allow up to ﬁve users (including you) to have a video call. Look for
more pay-per-use features to come out in the future. Until more features come out I am

not sure why this would be a solution to consider because the video windows are small and
it lacks any signiﬁcant feature needed to connect with other SIP video telephone solutions.

H.323 Video Call Solutions
H.323 solutions are kind of outdated. SIP is basically the replacement to H.323, but there
are still uses for H.323. One of the main reasons H.323 is no longer well liked as it is not
ﬁrewall friendly for corporate environments and requires a lot of special conﬁguration for
the enterprise environment.There are several hardware-based H.323 solutions that can be
used for video calls for the home user. Many of the video telephone devices can have their
BIOS ﬂashed to support SIP or H.323, but rarely both.This enables us to use hardware-
based video telephone solutions along with software-based video call solutions together for
speciﬁc video call needs or requirements. H.323 solutions are not ﬁrewall friendly at all and
need to be conﬁgured per each vendor solution as described in Appendix A.
EnvisionSL
Sorenson’s Envision SL (just a front-end to NetMeeting) is a software solution that was devel-
oped to provide a software H.323 solution for Sorenson’s VP 100 video telephone (same as
the Blackcrow BCV-103 video telephone) to provide video call capabilities to the hearing

impaired community. EnvisionSL is Microsoft NetMeeting with a different, friendlier user
interface. EnvisionSL runs on basically any version of Microsoft Windows, 98x,W2K, and XP.
EnvisionSL is not ﬁrewall friendly at all and the ports for your cable/DSL router or corporate
ﬁrewall will need to be conﬁgured as described in Appendix A.

Microsoft NetMeeting
Microsoft NetMeeting was the earliest video call solution that is included even today with
every version of Windows.This product is now obsolete, but it can be still be used to call
any H.323 video telephone device or other H.323 software solutions. NetMeeting runs on
basically any version of Microsoft Windows, 98x, W2K, and XP. NetMeeting is not ﬁrewall
friendly at all and the ports for your Cable/DSL router or corporate ﬁrewall will need to be
conﬁgured as described in Appendix A.

Chat-Room-Based Video Call Solutions
Chat-room-based video call solutions should truly be used only by adults. So if you have
children and you want or expect them to make video calls with family and friends, a chat-
room-based video call solution is not for you, though of course it is your decision. Being a
father and knowing what I do about computer security and the issue with predators and
pedophiles, chat-room-based solutions are suited for adult use only! Statistics show that 65%
of all predators initiate a conversation with a child in a chat room. IRC Chat should be
included in this. If you are a concerned parent, block all chat-room-based solutions.
Of course, not all solutions are created equal and some have parental controls, like
PalTalk Chat that allows you to show only G-rated content, but in reviewing these solutions
over the past couple years, many solutions have a policy of appropriate use, but I do not
trust someone else’s policy, I trust my own controls when it comes to children. Only two
solutions had good enough video to be considered: CUWorld and EyeBall Chat, but since
they are chat-room-based, I only rated them a 3 due to the possible exposure. Be sure you
understand who may use these products before you select a solution.All chat-room-based
solutions get the following label:

CUWorld
CUWorld is a Web-based video call solution with multiple cost plans. CUWorld is a chat-
room-based video call solution that can allow “private rooms” for one-on-one conferences
or multiuser video calls depending on your membership.You can also have video calls with
your “cupals” for private video calls.The quality of the video and number of people you can
have video calls with is limited by each plan. For the Guest account, you get only 7fps
(slow) and up to four users. Since this is a server-based solution with lots of users, you may
experience a delay. CUWorld is ﬁrewall friendly since it uses Internet Explorer.The free
version is nothing to write home about, but the VIP solution has some serious quality, but
at a premium cost.As we stated many times, chat rooms are dangerous for children and so
this product needs parental guidance if used by children. CUWorld is ﬁrewall friendly and
can be used just about anywhere.

DKMessenger
DKMessenger is a solution that offers multiple plans and features.The DKMessenger client
has chat rooms that you can browse for other users.As we stated many times, chat rooms are
dangerous for children and so this product needs parental guidance if used by children.
DKMessenger is nothing fancy and the client is rather complicated to use and conﬁgure.
DKMessenger also does not release the webcam when minimized, so it is not friendly to
use with other video call solutions. DKMessenger is not ﬁrewall friendly.

have a video call.This solution has access to chat rooms without any parental controls, so if
you are a parent, you should not allow your child access to this solution. EyeBall Chat is
ﬁrewall friendly.

Other Video Call Solutions
There was only one solution that ended up not being able to be categorized, other than the
solutions that have been discontinued or are at their end-of-life. We will list the obsolete
solutions only so you know we know about them and at least took a look.
Microsoft Portrait
Microsoft Portrait is the only free video call solution for a Windows-based Pocket PC. MS
Portrait is a Microsoft Research project developed to give Windows and Pocket PC users a
video call client so they may have video calls with one another.This product is now basi-
cally obsolete, but it can be still be used to make a video call between a WiFi-enabled
Pocket PC and a Windows system running MS Portrait. MS Portrait is not ﬁrewall friendly.

Summary
In this appendix, we covered the free video call solutions that are readily available.They
include solutions that are for on-on-one video calls, multiuser video calls, multi-IM video
calls, SIP and H.323 video call solutions, chat room video call solutions and “other solu-
tions” that needed to be mentioned and any that have been discontinued or that are at end-
of-life.The categories helped to separate the solutions so that they could be better
compared to similar solutions and some even appeared in multiple sections since they had
multiple capabilities.This chapter shows that a few free video call solutions really seemed to
be better than the rest and all the solutions that rated a score of 4 or 5 could coexist with
other solutions to provide you a suite of video call applications for your speciﬁc needs.
