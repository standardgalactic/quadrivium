About the Authors
Michael J. O’Farrell started his mobile Internet career in the early 1990s, 
by pioneering the development of text messaging, mobile-phone-based 
applications, and the mobile Web to reach mass market audiences globally. 
In addition to consulting companies on how to capitalize on the power of 
the mobile Internet, he is vice chairman of ooober and chair of the dotMobi
Advisory Group. Michael wrote this book to help his friends, family, wife, and
two children in Toronto better understand his addiction to all things mobile.
John R. Levine wrote his first program in 1967 on an IBM 1130 (a computer
somewhat less powerful than your typical modern digital wristwatch, only
more difficult to use). Although John used to spend most of his time writing
software, now he mostly writes books (including Internet For Dummies, pub-
lished by Wiley Publishing, Inc.) because it’s more fun and he can do so at
home in the tiny village of Trumansburg, New York, where in his spare time
he was the mayor for several years.
Jostein Algroy is senior advisor for the government of Ontario, Canada. 
He has been active in the mobile space for more than 15 years as an inter-
national consumer market strategist and published journalist. Jostein has
taught international business, strategy, new product development, and
design at Copenhagen Business School. He also works with photography,
having achieved awards and recognition for his art, and looks forward to 
the day when mobile phones are equipped with high-quality, 8-megapixel
cameras.
James Pearce is the chief technology officer at dotMobi. He has the 
mobile Web in his veins, having worked previously at Argogroup and
AnywhereYouGo and as the founder of the “old school” mobile blog
WAPtastic. Variously a management consultant, a teacher, an orienteer, 
and an Oxford University physicist by training, James has declared every
year since 1997 to be the Year of the Mobile Web. For the sake of his wife 
and two children, with whom he lives happily in Dublin, we hope he’s 
finally right.
Daniel Appelquist is an American expatriate and a dot-com refugee living in
London, England, where he works as a technology strategist for Vodafone, a
company he represents in the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), where he
chairs the Mobile Web Best Practices working group. He is an evangelist for
mobile Web topics, a published author, a frequent speaker, and a co-founder
of Mobile Monday London and the Mobile 2.0 conferences. You can usually
catch Dan mobile blogging while hanging out with his wife and two kids.

About the Contributor
Michael Becker is executive vice president of business development at 
iLoop Mobile. Additionally, he is a board member of the Mobile Marketing
Association (MMA) and the dotMobi Advisory Group and is a co-publisher 
of the award-winning MMA Journal of Mobile Marketing. He is also finalizing
his doctorate, focusing on the mobile channel. When he comes up for air,
Michael enjoys quiet times at home in San Jose with his wife and two kids —
with his smartphone on Silent mode.

Authors’ Acknowledgments
Making this book was possible because of the great support we got from our
wives and kids at home — they have been with us all the way. Michael thanks
Christine, Grace, and Matthew. Jostein thanks Eva. Dan thanks Allison, Alex,
and Emily. And, James thanks Jayne, Jex, and Evie. The late nights and early
mornings needed in order to crunch another paragraph or ten e-mails made
all the difference, and we really appreciate the extra time and space you gave
us to get the writing done.
As you can tell from our list of featured co-authors, writing a book about the
mobile Internet isn’t as easy as it might seem. To provide you with the most
comprehensive snapshot of all the mobile Internet has to offer (and to make
it easy for you to understand and enjoy), we got some additional help along
the way. We want to thank Trey Harvin from dotMobi, for saying Yes when we
needed it most; Laura Marriott from the Mobile Marketing Association, for
sending the “Good to go” text message for the book’s glossary contribution;
Russell Buckley from AdMob, for his words of mobile advertising wisdom;
Kathie Legg for her contributions on mobile in politics; and especially
Michael Becker at iLoop Mobile, for the midnight text message saying “How
could I help?” Michael helped us out in a big way with his contribution to a
couple of chapters — so much so that we thought we should give him an
extra bit of credit — because credit is definitely due — as a key contributing
(behind the scenes) co-author.
Finally, our thanks to a few people who helped us get the ball rolling and kept
us moving forward to get this book finished and in your hands. Our special
thanks to Steve, Rebecca, Becky, Jim, Bill, and Neil. And, we thank all the 
staff at Wiley and Waterside Productions (and John Levine) for making little
miracles come together for the rookies on the co-author team.

Introduction
W
elcome to Mobile Internet For Dummies. We have a completely 
new world for you to explore and discover, all available from the 
palm of your hand. Surfing the mobile Internet has never been easier for
anyone — anywhere or at any time — to find anything they want on their
mobile phones.
It’s really not that easy — or is it?
Unfortunately, most wireless carriers providing services have made it easy
for only a few geeks who have a master’s degree in Jargonology to under-
stand what the heck the mobile Internet is. As a result, all of us have been 
left up in the air (no pun intended) and wondering:
 How does this mobile phone really work outside of making calls?
 What are mobile Internet services and how do I get them?
 What kind of mobile phone and service plan do I need in order to get
access to the mobile Internet?
 Is there really an Internet-like browser on my mobile phone?
 And, our all-time favorite, where are all the made-for-mobile services,
Web sites, and applications that work on my mobile phone?
We could list thousands of questions, but our space is limited in this intro-
duction and we should start helping you rather than confusing you more.
Our goal is to make surfing the mobile Internet as easy as getting on your
computer and browsing the World Wide Web. If you don’t know how to get 
on board the computer Internet bandwagon, we highly recommend that you
pick up a copy of Internet For Dummies, written by one of our co-authors,
John Levine, and his good friends Carol and Margaret.
About This Book
The mobile Internet world is full of interesting twists and turns; we did our
best to provide you with the straight and narrow in the chapters ahead.

Whether you’re a new mobile Internet user or a seasoned “road warrior,” we
created a simple and straightforward guide to help you find what you need 
to best enjoy your mobile phone and all the excellent services available on
the mobile Internet. From finding your mobile phone browser to updating
your blog on-the-fly, each chapter and section gives you easy-to-understand
instructions and samples to use. Browse through the pages, read the book
from beginning to end, or just flip to the sections you want to learn more
about — it’s all here for you in one spot.
How to Use This Book
We recommend reading Chapters 1, 2, and 3 first. These chapters provide 
you with the basic, essential insights about the mobile Internet and set you
off on the right foot. The mobile Internet is quite different from the Internet,
and when you understand the differences, your newly found mobile world
will truly be a great place and lots of fun for you to enjoy.
When you’re ready to go, Part II helps you with all you need to know 
about mobile phones (including smartphones and PDAs) and mobile phone
browsers, which are needed to get you online to the mobile Internet. And, 
it helps you make sure that you have the right mobile phone, connections,
and airtime plans with your wireless carrier to surf the mobile Internet 
superhighway in an affordable way.
Parts III, IV, and V show you, and describe, all the stuff you can do, find,
create, and build on the mobile Internet, including how to find and use made-
for-mobile services, Web sites, applications, e-mail, instant messaging (IM),
and blogging — we even show you how to bank on your mobile phone. We
also show you how to build your own services and sites for the mobile Web.
As with any new service and technology, you have to mumble your way
through a ton of new words, acronyms, and technological terms. We include 
a glossary at the back of the book for you to reference at any time.
Speaking about any time: To help you keep tuned in and turned on to the
latest and greatest available on the mobile Internet, we created a computer-
based and made-for-mobile Web site for you to access at any time, and 
anywhere you want. The mobile Internet is one of today’s fastest growing 
and changing industries. Keeping up with the pace of change isn’t easy.

How This Book Is Organized
This book has five parts. Each part can be read on its own as a miniature
Mobile Internet For Dummies book — you can start reading wherever you like,
but you should at least skim Parts I and II first to get acquainted with some
new mobile Internet terms and ideas and find out how to get more from your
mobile phone on the mobile Internet.
The following sections describe each part of the book and the topics it 
contains.
Part I: Welcome to the Mobile Internet
We provide you with a simple explanation of the mobile Internet world, 
some industry terms, and the current mobile market landscape to help you
better understand the services that are available and the effect that the
mobile Internet can have on your lifestyle, whether you’re at home, work,
school, or play.

Introduction

Part II: Mobile Internet, Here 
It Is — Now What?!
You find out what everybody should know about the basic features of mobile
phone applications, services, and browsers versus computer applications
and Internet browsers. Also, you learn the ins and outs of using a mobile
phone browser — independent of the device you have. We show you how to
sign up and set up your mobile device for mobile Internet services, tell you
what’s available by market and wireless carrier, and describe the best ways
to save time and money when surfing the mobile Internet.
Part III: Mobile Internet Mania 
for the Everyday Consumer
Part III outlines the best ways for you to “surf” or consume mobile Internet
services. We show you how to find made-for-mobile information, products,
and services for personal and business use. This part covers how to use your
mobile phone for e-mail, IM, and blogging from anywhere, at any time.
Whether you’re interested in looking for mobile sites for news, sports, enter-
tainment, travel, shopping, or financial services, this part helps you out.
Part IV: I Want My Own 
Mobile Internet Space
If you’re ready to start creating, building, and developing mobile Internet ser-
vices and sites, check out this part. From just having fun with your friends
over the mobile Internet to making money from your new interest in the
mobile world, you find out how to take advantage of the next wave of digital
media opportunities (and you can even make a little profit from doing it).
Part V: The Part of Tens
This part carries on the For Dummies tradition of highlighting ten items:
specifically, the top ten ways to have fun on the mobile Internet; ten major,
costly mistakes that you can avoid; and ten frequently asked questions.

should be made-for-mobile. If they aren’t, your user experience may not be
what you expected and your airtime costs will be higher than you ever
expected.
Where to Go from Here
Do you already have a mobile phone, an airtime package, and a wireless data
plan that you’re happy with? If so, you can get started right away in Part III. 
If you don’t have a mobile phone or aren’t happy with your current airtime
packages, jump to Part II. Reading Chapter 5 alone can save you more than
the cost of this book.
Whenever you hit a speed bump or problem using the mobile Internet, just
look it up in the table of contents or the index. You’ll either have the problem
solved in a mobile minute or know where you need to go to find some 
expert help.

Introduction

The mobile Internet is more complex and complicated than the Internet has
ever been. Thousands of mobile phone models all have different capabilities,
different wireless carriers have a host of service plans that would confuse
even the world’s best rocket scientists, and many made-for-mobile products
and services are quite difficult to find if you don’t know where to look. It’s 
a whole new frontier. If needed, go back and forth between chapters and 
sections; it’s whatever makes you feel more comfortable with exploring the
mobile Internet that works best. The mobile Internet is one of the most per-
sonal and powerful communications media ever invented — take your time,
find out how best to use it for what you need, and enjoy the freedom it offers.

Part I
Welcome to the
Mobile Internet

In this part . . .
T
he Internet is an amazing place, and it’s doubly 
amazing that you can use it from a phone that ﬁts in
your pocket. But because it’s full of computers, every-
thing’s more complicated than it should be. We start with
a bird’s-eye view of the mobile Internet, and then we give
special attention to security problems, privacy issues, 
and family concerns — particularly the knotty question of
what’s the best way for kids to work with the Internet.

Chapter 1
What Is the Mobile Internet?
In This Chapter
 Getting mobile with the Internet
 Distinguishing between the mobile Internet and the regular Internet
 Finding cool tools for your mobile experience
 Seeing and doing things unique to the mobile Internet
 Getting a line on mobile Internet safety
You probably have heard about the Internet by now, but you might not
have heard about the mobile Internet. If you haven’t, you’re not alone. 
In fact, you’re in good company: Billions of people are in the same situation.
If you’re using the mobile Internet, you have connected to the Internet by 
way of a wireless carrier data connection, usually to get made-for-mobile
information and applications to display on your mobile phone screen.
This chapter helps clarify what the heck we’re talking about, what all the 
fuss is about, and why you should care about the mobile Internet — at least
enough to try out the mobile Internet. We’re pretty sure that you’ll like it if
you give it a try.
If you think that being Internet-savvy might be beneficial, don’t necessarily
bank on it. The mobile Internet isn’t the little brother of the Internet. It’s 
different enough that you need a different mindset, and a different under-
standing specific to the mobile Internet maze, to navigate it effectively. Later
in this chapter we explain that difference.
Oh, and don’t forget about buzzwords. Lots of new words, phrases, and
expressions are used in the mobile Internet world that set it apart from the
Internet world. We do our best to acquaint you with them. If this topic is all
new to you, take your time; we help you get it right, and at your own pace.
Even if you’re a know-it-all who breezes through this book, you can still pick
up expert tips to make your wireless world much better — we promise.

The mobile Internet is a new frontier — the Wild West of the mobile-phone
business. It’s time to get this mobile Internet show on the road (pun
intended).
Welcome to the Mobile Internet
Over the past 20 years, wireless carriers (AT&T Wireless, Sprint–Nextel, 
T-Mobile, Verizon Wireless, and others) have offered cellular-telephone voice
services. Most people have made calls on a mobile phone by now. About ten
years ago, wireless carriers introduced SMS (Short Message Service), or text
messaging. People almost everywhere now had their mobile phones and
alphanumeric pagers built into one device. Text messaging is now a hugely
successful service, with billions of text messages sent monthly. If you haven’t
voted on American Idol with text messaging or sent a quick note to a friend,
ask any kids in your vicinity — they can fill you in on the power of text 
messaging.
For the next trick up their mobile-phone sleeves, manufacturers such as
Motorola, LG, Nokia, RIM, Samsung, Sony Ericsson, and many others were
quite busy in their little workshops around the world, trying to figure some-
thing out: how to make people’s lives even easier. After combining a mobile
phone with a pager, what could they possibly dream up next? Someone then
thought about making Internet-like services work on mobile phones. They
realized that mobile phones could become even more like tiny computers:
They had screens, keyboards, and tiny little software applications running
them — and they were all connected to a network. Ta-da! Like magic, a 
new cyberspace was created: Now, people all over the world have Internet
access to Web sites from mobile phones anytime, anywhere.
More than 200 million people in the United States, and almost 3 billion people
worldwide, are now using mobile Internet services on their mobile phones
every day — in every way. Services have advanced from only making calls 
to family and business associates to text-messaging quick notes to friends;
voting on American Idol; reading sports scores from ESPN; sending jokes 
(yes, we said it) and bank balances to mobile phones; checking e-mail on
BlackBerrys and answering Yahoo! instant messaging chats; and surfing a
made-for-mobile World Wide Web for the latest ringtones from Avril Lavigne,
pictures of The Simpsons, games from Atari, uploads to Flickr, stock quotes
from E*Trade, and news from CBS News — all on the mobile Internet. Holy
smokes, Batman (yes, you can get Batman on your mobile phone now, thanks
to Apple iPhone) — the mobile Internet is truly catching up faster than
anyone thought possible. Finally, the Internet and the World Wide Web have
hit the wireless world.

Part I: Welcome to the Mobile Internet 

Understanding What’s Different 
about the Mobile Internet
The mobile Internet is a new creature; it’s more than just the Internet gone
wireless. First, you must understand that the mobile Internet is a mass-media
communications channel — just like newspapers, magazines, billboards, the-
aters, movies, radio stations, television networks, and Internet Web sites.
Second, recognize that the mobile Internet is as different from the Internet 
as radio is from television. Early TV shows were quite bland and simple:
Actors read their scripts in front of the camera because that was the way 
it had been done on radio — not very exciting. But as time went by, the two
different mass-media channels became quite different in the programming 
(or content) they offered; each developed offerings to suit its particular
strengths. The same concept now applies to the Internet and the mobile
Internet.
11
Chapter 1: What Is the Mobile Internet?
A history of the mobile Internet
The mobile Internet had its humble beginnings
around 1998 and had its growing pains, misses,
and hits (way more misses than hits). Its 
nickname was like a cartoon sound effect —
WAP — which was a shorter version of Wireless
Application Protocol. The mobile Internet wasn’t
supposed to be named WAP, so back then they
referred to it as wireless Internet (no relation to
WiFi as we now know it), and wireless Internet
Web sites were WAP sites.
Early in 2000, the wireless world caught fire with
the launch of the Internet on a mobile phone. (We
realize that true mobile-phone fanatics are shak-
ing their heads now, but stay tuned — this stuff
comes up to the present really fast.) Great idea,
shaky start. Back then, only a few mobile phone
models had built-in Web browsers, wireless car-
riers’ data-connection plans were extremely
expensive, and average consumers found it next
to impossible to find WAP Web sites that worked
on their mobile phones. The whole Internet-on-
a-mobile-phone idea was somewhere between
a boondoggle and a complete mess. Customers
didn’t like it, content companies didn’t like it, and
wireless carriers didn’t like it. It was a good
recipe for failure, as we all know now.
But the wireless industry had to start some-
where. (Hey, Rome wasn’t built in a day.) Think
back to the early days of the Internet — Web 2.0
it wasn’t. Most people used CompuServe, AOL,
or Prodigy — all on dialup — and endured lim-
ited content and network capabilities, browsers
with primarily text-based services, no graphics,
and a few bits of information posted by even
fewer people. Think of the Internet now:
Computers have next-generation browsers from
Microsoft, Apple, Opera, or Firefox; full-fledged
multimedia services from Google, Yahoo!,
Facebook, and YouTube; and all-you-can-eat
Internet access from Comcast, EarthLink, or
Time-Warner Cable. The information highway
simply grew much bigger and faster. The mobile
Internet has done the same thing over the past
eight years: It has become the made-for-mobile
information highway: You can get on from nearly
anywhere, and it’s moving faster than ever.

Two factors make the mobile Internet a unique experience, distinct from 
the Internet of yore: the tools you use to access it and the content and 
experience that people are looking for after they start using it. The following
sections explore each of these topics in turn.
Checking out the tools you need
Most of the cool stuff you can find on the Internet now, whether you view it,
download it, or generate it as a user, is well suited to be delivered by avail-
able wired technology: high-speed dialup, broadband, and cable networks.
But all that cool Internet stuff may not be as well suited to a mobile phone —
or as appealing — if it isn’t produced in the right format or context. That’s
because the similarities between the mobile Internet and the wired Internet
are (for the most part) skin deep — and the differences are complex. As with
all media technologies in the past, evolution takes hold and things change
quite quickly — spurred by the need to attract and engage new audiences.
The challenge all along for wireless carriers, mobile phone manufacturers,
and Internet-based content companies was how to give customers access to
the huge amounts of information and services available on the Internet — 
on the go. Information, entertainment, and services made for the Internet had
the benefit of large monitors, full QWERTY keyboards, computer-based
browsers, and high-bandwidth data networks for connectivity.
The mobile Internet, on the other hand, arrives in an entirely different way.
Here are the items you need:
 A mobile phone (or smartphone or PDA): First and foremost, you can’t
jump onto the mobile Internet without a mobile phone. These devices —
phone, smartphone, or PDA — are the items that make the mobile
Internet different. The size requirements for the screen display on
Internet Web sites (and the large amounts of information at those sites)
are tough to make work on mobile phones with their small screens and
tiny keypads. A mobile phone screen is a fraction of a computer moni-
tor’s size. And, mobile phone keypads versus computer keyboards —
let’s not go there (at least not until Chapter 4, which tells you all about
phones, smartphones, PDAs, and other devices).
 A mobile browser: To make the Internet work on mobile phones, 
wireless carriers created and installed made-for-mobile Web site
browsers in all mobile phones. We don’t get technical about that topic
here, but most are based on next-generation WAP 2.0 and xHTML tech-
nologies. Although mobile browsers and computer-based browsers have
their similarities, you still find that using a mobile browser to navigate
the Web is a unique experience. Find out all about it in Chapter 7.
12
Part I: Welcome to the Mobile Internet 

 A data plan: The mobile Internet has become more popular as carriers
have packaged plans for the wireless data airtime that gives consumers
mobile Internet access in a cost-effective way. Such plans include AT&T
Wireless Media and Verizon Wireless America’s Choice Premium. For
details about providers and data plans, see Chapter 5.
In essence, wireless carriers and their partners built an end-to-end mobile
Internet system from scratch for everyday people to enjoy Internet-like 
services while on the go.
Surfing made-for-mobile sites
Here’s an area where repeating a few mobile-Internet phrases may help you
get used to them — in this case, made-for-mobile.
A made-for-mobile Internet site is a Web site that’s streamlined and designed
to work on mobile devices. The sites are most easily identified for consumers
by their URLs — essentially, the .com part goes away — for example, BMW.mobi
(versus BMW.com) and wachovia.com/mobile versus wachovia.com. 
(We get into mobile Internet Web site naming details later.)
Internet sites, such as the BMW site shown in Figure 1-1, have too many
graphics and too much information for everyone’s little mobile phones to
access and display in a practical way. Accessing the pure Internet on a 
mobile phone might not be the best use of a person’s time and money.
Figure 1-1:
The Internet
site of
BMW.
13
Chapter 1: What Is the Mobile Internet?

The real answer is to make an Internet-like experience work on mobile
phones — and that means making it very simple. The information that people
want on their mobile phones should be easy to access and display, and quite
affordable as an option from their wireless carriers of choice. The made-for-
mobile phrase indicates that a site enables you to
 Browse more easily on your mobile device: Because a mobile 
device has a small screen, no large keyboard, and no “real” mouse, a
made-for-mobile site has pared-down navigation, lets you enter text
easily, and is designed to fit on a smaller screen.
 Access highly condensed, small bites of content and services on the
go: The sites are specifically designed and developed for your mobile
phone, offering (for example) made-for-mobile news, weather, sports,
e-mail, instant messaging, ringtones, pictures, and videos. Because 
you aren’t always home or at the office with full Internet access, made-
for-mobile describes the types of services and information you want
quickly and easily, anytime, anywhere.
The best use of the mobile Internet is to receive the information, appli-
cations, and services that work best on mobile devices when you’re
away from your computer. We don’t mean that you need to overload the
little gizmos with everything you can see on the Internet. The mobile
Internet is the information equivalent of a fast snack on the go. At a bus
stop, in a taxi or train, waiting for a plane or a friend, before a business
meeting, you can snap up tidbits of useful info like these:
• Practical information: Find the nearest restaurant or hotel, receive
stock market updates, check out movie listings or flight schedules,
look for the best shopping deals, and check local weather.
• Pastimes: Download entertainment (ringtones, images, games,
videos, and music on demand, for example), find out who won the
big game, or update blogs with notes and pictures.
If you get the made-for-mobile versions of all these products and serv-
ices, before long you’ll be right at home on the mobile Internet.
 Find what you need with smaller downloads: Made-for-mobile content,
applications, and services make all this stuff as inexpensive as possible
to access through your mobile phone and your wireless carrier’s data
services.
Figure 1-2 shows the mobile version of the BMW site shown earlier in 
Figure 1-1. The mobile version is much easier to navigate on a phone than 
the Internet site.

Part I: Welcome to the Mobile Internet 

Determining What to Do on the Mobile
Internet (Now That You’re Hooked)
Think about it. When you’re away from your computer, you still have a way to
get business information, catch up with friends, find places in an unfamiliar
city, or get entertained.
What’s most interesting about the mobile Internet is that it’s right where you
want it to be: handy. You most likely have it with you all the time — in your
pocket, purse, rucksack, or whatever — on your mobile phone. And, as long
as your carrier’s signal covers your device wherever you are, you can use it
whenever you’re ready.
Wireless carriers offer package deals that make the mobile Internet usable.
Mobile phone manufacturers build mobile Internet capabilities into every
new phone now sold. Content providers and applications deliver more made-
for-mobile services every day. Here are some of the mobile Internet options
available to you:
 Entertainment sites: From mobile TV to uploading pictures to updating
your blog, it’s all available for you to do whenever you want, wherever
you want. If you missed the latest episode of your favorite reality TV
show, you can catch the highlights before anyone tells you who got
voted off. If you’re standing at the Statue of Liberty after taking the per-
fect picture from your mobile phone camera, just load up the picture
and post it on your Internet Web site, or blog about it right then and
there. If you want to Web-surf, the mobile Internet offers a World Wide
Web of opportunities to explore. See Chapter 9 for details.
Figure 1-2:
The made-
for-mobile
BMW site.
15
Chapter 1: What Is the Mobile Internet?

 Information: Every month, hundreds or thousands of made-for-mobile
text messaging services and mobile Web sites are launched by wireless
carriers, media companies, and content providers. They’re fun to
browse whenever you have a few spare minutes. See Chapter 6 to find
out about text messaging, Chapter 7 for tips on browsing the mobile
Internet, and Chapter 8 for information about how to use mobile 
search tools.
 M-commerce: It’s like e-commerce, only portable. If you want to use 
your mobile phone like a virtual ATM, you can do it. If you want to buy
some flowers while you’re stuck on a plane, that’s no problem. If you
want to check out the latest reviews on your favorite band after the 
concert — you got it. Chapter 11 helps you shop till you drop; Chapter
12 introduces mobile money management.
 E-mail and instant messaging (IM): Wireless carriers have many ways 
to help you keep connected to your business and personal e-mail while
you’re away from your computer. You can check and send e-mail any-
where you are. All e-mail software and services can be connected to
your mobile phone, which makes it easier to keep in touch; you can send
and receive messages while on the golf course or on the ski slope. (Why
sit in an office if you don’t have to?) Check out Chapter 10 to find out
ways to check your e-mail and send instant messages from your phone.
 Mobile software applications and widgets: Mobile phones now are
really tiny computers, with tiny operating systems that you can use to
load tiny applications such as games, expense trackers, and maps. If you
have a useful desktop widget that keeps you up to date with RSS feeds
from the Internet, a made-for-mobile version is likely on its way. Check
out your favorite computer application and widget provider’s Internet
Web site — it definitely has something in the works coming to a mobile
phone near you. Chapter 7 showcases a few applications and widgets 
for you to try on your mobile phone.
 User-generated mobile Web sites: All the made-for-mobile tools, serv-
ices, and technologies you need in order to stake your own claim on 
the mobile Internet land rush are at your fingertips. You can buy a made-
for-mobile Internet yournamehere.mobi domain from your mobile
phone on your way home on the bus, create your own mobile Web site
when you get home (in about an hour), and then have it launched, ready
to share with all your friends, before you leave home the next day. You
can also test and work with your current Internet Web site to make it
made-for-mobile (and call it m.yournamehere.com) within hours. The
choices are endless. See Chapter 15 for details.
 Mobile Internet for business: Home business, small business, corpo-
rate, or the next big thing — wireless carriers and their partners have
everything you need to create, develop, and launch your company, 
products, services, and promotions to the whole wireless world when-
ever you’re ready. From launching your own ringtone, wallpaper, and
16
Part I: Welcome to the Mobile Internet 

video storefronts to building made-for-mobile software applications 
and mobile Web sites, the mobile Internet is officially open for business.
Chapter 2 introduces ways the mobile Internet can help you at work;
Chapters 13 and 16 go into more detail about pitching your business
tent on the mobile Internet.
Some Thoughts about Safety and Privacy
As you probably know, you can have many identities on the Internet. You
might have an e-mail account associated with your work. But you can have 
an e-mail account at home — or several e-mail accounts at Web-enabled
Internet service providers such as Yahoo!, Google, or MSN. In addition, you
can set up your own blog, where you can hide (or enhance) your identity, 
for whatever reason. On the Internet, everyone can be (or seem to be)
whomever they want to be.
With your mobile phone on the mobile Internet, however, what you see 
is pretty much what you get. It’s one way that the wireless world is quite 
different from the wired world: You are who you are. Wireless carriers must
identify you directly and accurately so that they can bill you for any service
subscription or airtime package. They have to keep records on your commu-
nications and purchase activities — for your protection more than anything
else. Additionally, your mobile phone — and phone number — becomes your
personal identifier to all product and service companies you engage with
through mobile Internet services.
So what are the truly unique features of your mobile phone and the mobile
Internet that make it different from the Internet world? Here’s the short list:
 Mobile phones are extremely personal. A mobile phone is the first
truly personal communications product ever created. You may have
thought that the computer was personal because its name is “personal”
computer, but a mobile phone becomes a basic personal possession, like
a set of car keys. (That’s appropriate when you consider that the phone
is the key you use to access the mobile Internet.) Mobile phones are so
personal that most people refuse to share theirs with anyone else — 
not even with their spouses. Some people would rather lose a pet than
lose a mobile phone. (Maybe they keep virtual pets on their phones.)
Others won’t leave home without their mobile phones, even to go to 
the corner store, just in case. Most people don’t leave home without
keys, a wallet or purse, and a mobile phone. Most would go back home
to retrieve a forgotten mobile phone, but might not bother if it were
their keys or wallet.
17
Chapter 1: What Is the Mobile Internet?

As mentioned in a recent speech by the mobile industry guru Tomi
Ahonen (www.tomiahonen.com), six out of ten people worldwide 
place their mobile phones next to their beds before they go to sleep.
And, more than two-thirds of the global mobile consumer population 
use mobile phones as alarm clocks. Additionally, mobile phones have a
personal phone number that’s yours, only yours, and nobody else’s. It’s
not your house’s, not your spouse’s, and not your dog’s (well, maybe
you trust your dog enough to let her borrow your phone).
 Mobile Internet services and all voice communications reach you
through your mobile phone, where you can be accurately identified.
By having a unique number that only you own, along with a mobile
phone that you register with the wireless carrier, you can be tracked by
whatever you do with your mobile phone. It’s therefore relatively easy 
to capture data about your behavior — whom you called, which detailed
text messages you sent, how long you were on the mobile Internet, what
you were doing, where and when you were doing it, and whom you 
connect with. Most of this information is held in trust and confidence
between you and your wireless carrier — but it’s all there. You’re pro-
tected by federal regulatory laws (unless, of course, you’re doing some-
thing criminal). Also, if you buy your mobile phone and mobile Internet
services through your employer, your employer has all the same rights
it would have with your on-the-job computer and Internet usage.
If your employer pays your mobile phone bill, it owns access to your
mobile phone and mobile Internet records — and can look at them if 
and when required.
 The mobile Internet is always on and available for communications
with your mobile phone. You can leave CNN on the TV all day, but you
don’t take the TV with you when you go out because it’s a pain to lug
and it doesn’t work all that well (unless you have a really long extension
cord and a satellite receiver on your head). And, you can drag your
laptop computer with you when you go out, but it isn’t practical to use
everywhere. It may work when connected to WiFi hotspots, or if you
have a wired connection and power, but who brings one to the dance
club on Saturday night? But you can do that with your mobile phone.
Mobile phones now have excellent battery life, work well in about 90
percent of urban areas in North America (according to the wireless 
carriers), and fit right into your pocket.
Mobile phone etiquette is important. It might not always be polite to
have your mobile phone turned on wherever you are — people might
get angry if your phone starts ringing in the movie theater, in church, 
or in the classroom when the teacher is trying to explain the theory of
relativity. Always turn off your mobile phone or turn it to Silent mode 
or Vibrate mode (yes, we said vibrate) to keep your friends, business
associates, and family members liking you better during gatherings or
meetings or whenever your spouse has something important to say.
(“Oops, sorry, dear — hold that thought while I take this call. . . .” Let’s
not go there.)

Part I: Welcome to the Mobile Internet 

 Mobile phones and wireless carrier mobile Internet services have
built-in payment systems — basically, it’s a wireless wallet. You can
pay your bills over the Internet, and you can buy books at Amazon.com
and pay for them using your Visa card. But on your mobile phone, nearly
all your calling and mobile Internet transactions are charged to your
wireless carrier bill on the day you create them. This includes all made-
for-mobile products and services including text messaging, ringtones,
wallpapers, music, games, video, wireless data-network access, long 
distance, roaming, and whatever else is coming down the pike.
Basically, any product and service that “touches” your mobile phone
can get billed through the wireless carrier. Vending machines, movie
tickets, fast-food restaurants, taxicabs, and other venues that deal in
small cash amounts (places or machines that accept micropayments
less than $20) will soon accept payment by mobile phone — all tracked
and charged to your mobile phone bill. New payment options from your
wireless wallet or your m-commerce mobile phone are already available.
In Helsinki, Finland, more than half the single tickets for public trans-
portation are paid by mobile phones and billed through a wireless 
carrier. In South Africa, you can have your paycheck sent directly to
your mobile phone account that’s linked to your bank account.
Okay, mobile phones have a potential downside: If you lose your phone 
and don’t report the loss as soon as possible, you can be liable for all calls,
products, and services that are purchased, whether you’re the one that
bought them or not. The best safeguard is to keep your mobile phone in your
personal possession at all times, report any immediate loss or theft of your
mobile phone to your wireless carrier and the police, and review and track 
all your wireless carrier billing statements before you make payments.
We strongly recommend that you read all terms and conditions of your wire-
less carrier’s service contract — as well as the “fine print” published on any
mobile Internet service offerings. In the mobile Internet world, the wireless
carriers are your best friends and will do everything in their power to keep
you protected from false claims or any fraudulent activities. Wireless carriers
and the mobile Internet world are highly regulated service industries; they’re
in business to serve and protect the mobile phone users who keep them in
business.

 Playtime on the mobile Internet
O
kay, so you bought a mobile phone. You made a few calls to your 
friends and family members who also have mobile phones. You got a
call from your mom just after you left your house to remind you to bring
some soda pop to the party. (Thanks, Mom.) You received your first text 
message from your boss, telling you that he’ll be late for the meeting — again!
You also sent your first text message, to your best friend in Los Angeles while
you were in Detroit. She received it in less than a minute and sent one right
back. Cool!
Did it really matter where you were when all these events happened?
That is, you didn’t need to be at home or at the office and tied to your 
desk, did you? Did it matter where your family, boss, and friends were? 
Not really.
Now imagine — while you’re on the go — that you could go online the same
way you go online from your home or school or office to surf the Net and 
find all the information and services you expect from the Internet and the
World Wide Web. You can do it without being at home or school, and while
you’re far away from the office.
In this chapter, we show you a few ideas and examples of how you, in your
daily life, can take advantage of all the things that are happening on the
mobile Internet.

Your Internet Away from Home
People are increasingly “connected.” Your house likely has a phone con-
nected to the wall, a TV connected to the wall, and a computer connected to
the wall. All those items work well when you’re at home.
When you aren’t at home, the mobile Internet gives you access to a wide
range of information, applications, and services to help you with your daily
lifestyle needs:
 Browse the Web. You can browse Web sites to shop, bank, search for
the nearest pharmacy, or read the latest weather forecast. Chapter 7
introduces basic mobile Internet browsing.
 Stay in touch. Send e-mail, chat with friends, or upload new pictures 
to your family blog. Chapter 10 has the details on e-mailing, chatting,
and blogging.
 Go shopping. If you forget your coupons or loyalty-rewards cards at
home, just take out your mobile phone and connect to the mobile
Internet, and you can retrieve them. Chapter 11 has the scoop on 
mobile coupons and shopping tools.
 Find sports scores. If you missed the latest results of the football 
game or your favorite Big Brother episode, check it out live from your
mobile phone.
The best way to connect to most of these types of services is to visit your
wireless carrier’s mobile Internet site or portal; the most requested and
common mobile Internet services are all there for you. If the mobile Internet
sites offered by your wireless carrier don’t suit your needs, you can go
directly to the made-for-mobile Internet site of your favorite online store,
bank, blog, or other type of service. Browsing made-for-mobile Internet sites
is similar to browsing at home, but mobile Internet sites and services are
designed to give you what you need when you need it on your mobile phone.
Here’s a quick tour of the various types of content and services offered on
some popular made-for-mobile sites:
 Keep up with the latest news stories, sports scores, weather reports,
and stock prices. From CNN to ESPN and from The Weather Channel
(shown in Figure 2-1) to Yahoo! Finance, all these mainstream Internet
services now have made-for-mobile Internet sites and offerings.
 See the latest music video of your favorite band and then download
the song to your mobile phone. Check out Verizon Wireless V Cast 
or the T-Mobile T-Zone service. Chapter 9 helps you find all your 
entertainment options on the mobile Internet.
 Check out banking services. If you need to check your balance, transfer
funds, or find the nearest ATM, a few excellent made-for-mobile Internet
sites have you covered: Bank of America, Citibank, Wachovia (shown 
22
Part I: Welcome to the Mobile Internet 

in Figure 2-2), and Wells Fargo. Most major regional banks and national
banks now have mobile Internet sites and services to help consumers 
in the same way as their Internet Web sites let them bank from home. 
In Chapter 12, you discover how to take advantage of basic mobile
money-handling.

 Make travel plans. Almost all airlines (see the example shown in 
Figure 2-3), hotels, and car rental Internet sites have their own made-
for-mobile Internet sites and services. You can even find out whether
your flight is on time, book your seat, and obtain your boarding pass —
all from your mobile phone. 
 Find fun, new menu ideas. If you need a good recipe, it’s as simple as
locating your mobile Web browser, searching for the recipe at a made-
for-mobile service on a recipe site (Allrecipes.com is shown in Figure
2-4), sending the ingredient list to your mobile phone, and buying the
ingredients at the supermarket. You can probably even have the super-
market send you a made-for-mobile discount coupon. Then you save
both time and money.

Part I: Welcome to the Mobile Internet 

If you have experienced what the Internet can do for you at home, the mobile
Internet will definitely knock your socks off. 
You’ve Heard of E-Learning — 
Now Try M-Learning
The Internet has changed how schools, teachers, and students are interact-
ing. A whole new wave of interactive education and access to information 
is changing the way students study at school. They can, for example, search
Google for the latest pictures of Mars, visit Yahoo! to find the Pythagorean
theorem, or build a wiki for the Macbeth project; they can even send their
final project papers to their teachers at midnight with all the text spell-
checked and tagged with references from the Internet. School has never been
so cool. Without having to lug a laptop, camera, and digital recorder, students
can now research, record, and report by using mobile Internet connectivity.
Kids can therefore be anywhere while they create, develop, and engage with
their peers and teachers on all kinds of projects.
Mobile learning, or m-learning is an interesting approach to mobile Internet
access as an opportunity for learning rather than for just making personal
calls, sending text messages, and engaging in business use. The UK Web site
www.m-learning.org has some examples of how mobile phones are used
in an educational setting. A couple of examples are described in this list:
 Mobile games: Quiz games can be used to check skills on almost any
mobile phone.
 MediaBoard: Kids send text messages or picture messages from their
phones to a Web-based MediaBoard to contribute to both personal and
collaborative Web sites.
Office on the Run
One word: BlackBerry. Okay, maybe we should say a couple of other words,
such as Apple iPhone, Motorola Moto Q, Palm Treo, Samsung BlackJack, and
other smartphones. These devices make keeping up with your work while 
on the road or away at a meeting much easier because most of them have
QWERTY keyboards, larger displays, and even capabilities to download, view,
create, edit, and upload documents while on the go. You can also send and
receive e-mail, synchronize calendars, and tap into contact lists.
25
Chapter 2: The Mobile Internet at School, at Work, and at Play

Businesses can reach out to customers over the mobile Internet, too, through
coupons, order forms, and financial-transaction services. More and more
people are jumping on the mobile Internet, and you want to be where your
customers come looking for you.
In the following sections, you take a closer look at the employee and 
customer sides of the mobile Internet.
Sneaking away from your desk
Most road warriors and corporate executives are already familiar with all 
the useful things you can do with the mobile Internet. We list the ways it’s
improving the working world for the rest of us and, later (in Part III), provide
you with more details on how to get hooked up with these services. For 
now, we count the many ways the mobile Internet can help you with your
day-to-day business activities.
Sending and receiving e-mail
POP3 and IMAP access to personal e-mail are easy to set up and are cost-
effective ways to get your e-mail on your mobile phone. They let you read,
delete, compose, and reply to your e-mail directly from your mobile phone.
Most wireless carriers have made-for-mobile personal e-mail services avail-
able for most mobile phones and smartphones. Check with your carrier
directly for the best service and plan. Alternative solutions are available for
Google Gmail (shown in Figure 2-5), Yahoo! Mail, and AOL Mail.
Figure 2-5:

26
Part I: Welcome to the Mobile Internet 

Corporate e-mail access is provided by software solutions integrated with
Microsoft Exchange, Lotus Domino, or Novell Groupwise servers at your
office. Excellent solutions are available for secure, real-time access to your
company e-mail and contact and calendar information. Contact your IT
department or wireless carrier to find out which solution works best for 
your company.
Filling out orders, forms, and reports
Forget about entering and reentering all the information you collect while
you’re away from the office or not working on your laptop. Simply enter
orders and expenses and fill out timesheets, forms, and surveys directly on
your mobile phone to transfer the information back to the office over the
mobile Internet. All sorts of made-for-mobile forms and solutions have been
created for mobile workforces around the world. Contact your IT department
or your mobile phone vendor or wireless carrier to find more mobile office
solutions than you could ever imagine.
Taking sales tools with you
Customer relationship management (CRM) on the spot — directly with your
customers and right when you need it most — is easier to achieve than you
might think. Most major CRM software companies provide mobile extensions
or services to their corporate software offerings. From ACT! (the highly popu-
lar CRM software from Sage) to SalesForce.com, you can either download a
simple application to your mobile phone or visit the mobile Internet site. It
makes sales management easy. For examples of the Salesforce.com made-for-
mobile offerings, check out its Web site for more details and subscription
requirements (see Figure 2-6).

Reaching out to customers the mobile way
Offices are “going mobile,” so there’s no reason that your storefront can’t
also go mobile. Dreams do come true for retailers on the mobile Internet!
Mobile consumers are the most sought after, hard-to-reach target markets
ever, so why not catch them while you can? From mobile coupons to mobile
commerce, you can now offer all your goods and services directly to any 
consumer with a mobile phone.
Offering mobile coupons
You can send discount shopping coupons or promotions to your customers
just when they need them most — and when they forget to bring along all the
coupons you mailed them. Consider creating a made-for-mobile Internet site
or text-messaging short code (an easy to remember five- or six-digit phone
number) for customers to access instant coupons — you can only gain 
more customers or make more money! Take a look at Cellfire.com (shown 
in Figure 2-7) and MobileDigit.com for some cool ideas. For more details,
Chapter 11 covers coupons and deals.
Handling transactions with mobile commerce
You’ve always been able to take orders with mobile sales and CRM 
solutions — now you can take the money too. Mobile phones are quickly
becoming mobile cash registers. Almost anyone with a mobile phone can
now buy goods and services directly from their mobile browsers. Simple

mobile Internet access to credit card processing companies and services is
providing secure, real-time processing capabilities for mobile commerce
applications. Check out Bango (shown in Figure 2-8) at http://bango.

provider to find out more about how you can make more money by serving
customers directly from the palms of their hands. Chapter 14 also gives you
some ideas on how to make money with mobile content.
Playtime on the Mobile Internet
There’s a time for work and a time for play. The mobile Internet is one of the
most fascinating playgrounds in the world. You can use your phone almost
anywhere, and have more fun with your phone than you could with your
computer. From grabbing the latest ringtone or hit from Timbaland to Led
Zeppelin on the Alltel Axcess mobile storefront to playing games such as
Tetris or Downtown Texas Hold’em from EA Mobile, it’s just the tip of the
mobile-Internet iceberg.
Mobile phones have become pocket-size multimedia computers. They have
screens, keyboards, computer chips, and modems built right in, and they
have access to the Internet through all the wireless carriers in the world.
Almost every mobile phone model now made can keep you entertained for
hours. The following sections describe just a few of the ways you can enjoy
the mobile Internet while on the go.

Mobile games aren’t just for kids
It’s fun to be a kid again whenever you get the chance. And mobile games 
are one of the best ways to keep the kid in all of us playing away. Gameloft
thinks so too: In 2007, it hit a milestone of selling more than 100 million
mobile games. Hundreds of mobile game developers exist, with funky names
like Glu Mobile (www.glu.com), EA Mobile (www.eamobile.com), and Sony
Pictures Mobile (www.sonypicturesmobile.com) — yes, the same Sony
that sells TVs, computers, and stereos — pumping out all kinds of games for
you. They’re easy to get to on your mobile-Internet-enabled phones, and are
available from all wireless carriers. You can spend a couple of bucks or pay
as much as $10. And, you can grab them on your mobile phone while you’re
waiting for the bus.
To give you an idea of what you can play, check out the Verizon Wireless list
of Top 10 Mobile Games in 2007:
1. Tetris
2. Are You Smarter Than A 5th Grader?
3. Guitar Hero III
4. Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare
5. Need for Speed ProStreet 3D
6. Diner Dash 2
7. Assassin’s Creed
8. Madden NFL 08
9. The Simpsons
10. God of War: Betrayal
For details about how to find, set up, and play mobile games, see Chapter 9.
Rock ’n’ roll and hip-hop — literally
With the mobile Internet at hand, you have access to your favorite tunes and
music wherever you go. Whether you’re going for a walk, jogging, riding a
bike, or just catching the next train to Georgia, you’re covered. Pick a favorite
artist — any artist — she probably has a ringtone, a callback tone, or a full
song available for you from your favorite wireless carrier.
30
Part I: Welcome to the Mobile Internet 

If you’re not on the carrier mobile portal, that’s no problem — you can sub-
scribe to one of the hundreds of mobile storefronts, such as Jamster.com,
ringtones.mobi, and MTV.com, to subscribe to and buy the music you love
best. Mobile music tones and songs cost from $1 for a single tune to about
$10 for a monthly subscription to all-you-can-eat (or listen to) services.
Lights, camera, action!
Suppose that you’re having fun with a few games and listening to some cool
songs and then you see the most beautiful sunset you’ve ever seen right
before your eyes. If you have a mobile phone with a camera built in, you’re 
in business. Take the shot and send it to your best friend right away. You can
send it to her mobile phone or computer or upload it to your Facebook or
Flickr site. It’s all ready to go with your mobile Internet connection. Chapter
14 provides more details on how to take pictures from your mobile phone
and upload them to popular Web 2.0 photo-sharing sites.
If the sunset outside your window has reminded you of the Young and the
Restless TV episode you just missed, you can get the highlight clip from CBS
Mobile and watch it before the moon comes up. All kinds of movie trailers,
TV shows, and even made-for-mobile episodes (mobisodes) are available 
to download to your mobile phone. Companies such as MobiTV.com and 
traditional TV broadcasters — such as ABC, CBS (see the example shown in
Figure 2-9), ESPN, and FOX — all have mobile videos produced to work on
most mobile phones. Find out about more mobile TV and video offerings in
Chapter 9 or check your local wireless carrier listings for more details.

Chapter 2: The Mobile Internet at School, at Work, and at Play

When you’re off to the movies, the mobile Internet can offer you a hand:
Major movie studios are also making clips and trailers filled with your
favorite movie stars and sidekicks. Here’s one cool feature: You view the
movie clip of the latest Brad Pitt film, find on your mobile browser the next
time slot that it’s playing at your local theatre, and buy the tickets to the
movie and have them delivered directly to your phone. It’s a concept of 
the future, you say? You can do it today: Have it charged to your mobile
phone bill or credit card at MovieTickets.com or the Fandango mobile 
service and you’re good to go.
Or, just surf the mobile Internet
Many mobile Internet sites are out there for you to see. Every day, thousands
of new made-for-mobile Internet sites and services are hitting the waves; stay
in tune with your favorite hobbies, stock picks, horoscopes, news, sports,
weather, traffic, bank accounts, businesses, and more. Throughout this book
we provide you with examples of the sites and services available for you 
to enjoy.

Part I: Welcome to the Mobile Internet 
TV episodes for your mobile phone: Mobisodes!
Mobisodes are short, made-for-mobile, TV-like
productions in which each episode is specifically
produced with a duration of no more than two to
three minutes. Traditionally, mobisodes are
highly edited short versions of TV shows and are
intended to allow fans to view their favorite
shows at any time and anywhere on a mobile
phone. One of the first mobisodes produced was
“Love and Hate” in January 2004, followed by
“Sunset Hotel” and “24: Conspiracy,” a spinoff of
the highly successful TV action drama 24. All
were launched on the Verizon Wireless network
in February 2005. Fox Mobile followed up with
“Prison Break: Proof of Innocence” in April 2006,
available on a variety of wireless carrier net-
works. Mobisodes are evolving from a main-
stream TV extension to a made-for-mobile
miniseries or event and casting a wide net that
attracts consumers to their mobile phones
regardless of whether they’re at home in front 
of a TV.

Chapter 3
Kids and the Mobile Internet
In This Chapter
 Looking at the ways your kids use their mobile phones
 Establishing guidelines for your kids’ mobile phone use
 Using the mobile Internet in school
 Keeping an eye out for cyberbullying
Young people are adopting mobile Internet services faster than their 
parents are, and they’re also weaving Internet and mobile Internet offer-
ings (for example, Facebook and YouTube) into their daily lives. Kids today
are also finding that the inherent benefits of mobile Internet freedom are
worth spending some of their allowance money on, and parents are having 
to deal with questions about their kids’ mobile phone etiquette at school and
at home.
In this chapter, we describe for parents and guardians the issues they need to
be aware of in giving their kids access to the mobile Internet. We also give
suggestions on how to properly manage children’s newfound “anywhere, any-
time” mobile Internet access. These issues include tips for managing kids’
access to services and content as well as their mobile phone use at school.
You also find out what cyberbullying is and how to watch for it.
Taking a Look at How Kids 
Use Mobile Phones
Millions of teens are now buying mobile phones, spending their allowances
or their parents’ money on text messaging and surfing the mobile Internet for
games, chat, and videos. 
Furthermore, even preteens (12 years old or younger) have become daily
users of mobile phones. As mobile phone use penetrates the younger popula-
tion and becomes an even more integrated part of teen life, it also has a pro-
found effect on how young kids and teens interact with each other, how they
use the phone in a school or workplace environment, and how they play.

According to data from mobile industry market research firm M:Metrics,
there are 71⁄2 million users of mobile social networking services in the 
United States.
A majority of these mobile social-networking users are teens and college 
students using MySpace and Facebook, the two most popular social network-
ing sites at the time this book was printed. Virtually all popular social net-
working sites have opened their services for access by people using mobile
phones to upload content, retrieve content, and communicate with their
peers. Accessing social networking sites from mobile phones is becoming an
integrated part of a kid’s cyber-lifestyle.
Although social networking services are often dismissed as chats and blogs
and games that are a waste of time for teens avoiding their homework, that
isn’t necessarily the case.
The good news, according to a recent Grunwald Associates survey, is that
most of the teens who enter social networking groups to connect with their
peers often use the groups to discuss homework.
Setting a Mobile Phone 
Policy with Your Kids
A recent study in the United Kingdom by Fly Research revealed that four 
out of five parents are concerned about their kids’ mobile phone use and,
even worse, about unsolicited connections from unwanted strangers and 
bullies. Interestingly, the same parents said that they feel their kids are safer
and more secure if they have mobile phones for emergency calls and direct
parent-child contact — a virtual safety net, of sorts.
The most disturbing aspect of the survey is that close to half of all parents
surveyed said that they don’t understand much about how kids now use
mobile phones and the services that are offered. Even scarier is that almost 
a quarter of the parents admitted that they don’t know who is on their kids’
contact lists and whether the phones are being used for calls or for text-
messaging connections. Parents should be concerned about these issues 
and should closely watch their children’s mobile phone activity.
We don’t tell you in this book whether kids should or shouldn’t use mobile
phones. A growing number of parents worry about their children’s use of
mobile phones, so we provide information and tips to parents (and to kids)
about how to handle some of the issues involved in teens using mobile
phones and accessing mobile Internet services.
34
Part I: Welcome to the Mobile Internet 

Even if your son or daughter pleads and bargains with you to have a mobile
phone, unless you feel completely comfortable with that possibility and you
can afford the extra costs involved, don’t feel pressured to buy one. Because
a tremendous number of responsibilities are involved — for both you and
your children — you should, as Mom always says, look before you leap.
Mobile phones require commitment from both of you, and you have to set
the proper guidelines, boundaries, and transparency rules between you 
and your children before entering into any mobile phone service agreement
for them.
Handling the money issue
Talking about money with your kids can be difficult. If your kids are using
their mobile phones too much, though, and it’s costing you a bundle to keep
them connected, you can address a few issues upfront so that they don’t
become problems later:
 Limit the amount of money that your kids can spend on phone ser-
vices every month. Think of this amount as a mobile phone allowance. 
If they spend more than the agreed-on amount, the extra money is taken
out of their personal allowances. The choice is then theirs: Go to the
movies or download a mobile game.
It may take some time to get your message across, but after they have to
pass up a couple of movies or new thingamajigs, they’ll get the point.
Just negotiate with rewards that your children value in order to achieve
clear agreement.
Here’s an example: A friend of ours has a son who manages like a hawk
his monthly $10 for extra mobile phone services. He goes online with his
computer to preview ringtones, games, and wallpapers; checks with his
friends on the highest-quality and coolest ringtones or just-released
mobile games; and makes his monthly decision of either one cool, high-
end ringtone for $8 or a basic ringtone and game for $10. Needless to
say, he is having fun on his mobile phone, and his parents have kept to
their word on managing and monitoring the negotiated mobile phone
allowance — everyone’s happy.
 Buy pay-as-you-go or prepaid service for your kids. This method deter-
mines the monthly amount your kids can use on their phones, and any
conflict or negotiation is handled upfront, before they use the phone,
rather than after they have spent the money.
Check with your wireless carrier to see whether it offers a program that
includes prepaid voice services, text messaging, and mobile Internet
access all in one package.
35
Chapter 3: Kids and the Mobile Internet

Monitoring your kids’ mobile phone use
Monitoring the costs of service doesn’t take care of monitoring your kids’
mobile phone behavior, such as which services or information they access 
on their mobile phones. Even though the task requires a bit of finessing, it
must be done — just as monitoring their Internet access must be done Here
are the differences in mobile phones and mobile Internet services versus
Internet services:
 Mobile screens are smaller.
 Mobile keyboards are smaller.
 Mobile devices can be used in any room of the house or in any park or
public space to connect to whoever and whatever users want.
Keeping tabs on your kids definitely isn’t as easy as looking over their 
shoulders while they’re sitting in front of the family computer in the dining
room, is it?
After providing kids with mobile phones and Mobile Internet service 
access, parents need to do their best to stay aware and maintain control of
their kids’ mobile Internet lifestyles. You need to keep a close eye on these
individuals:
 The people your children call and the people they get calls from:
This strategy is one of the simplest ways to keep tuned in to your kids’
mobile phone use. Listen in on a few conversations and ask questions
about who usually calls them. You can also always look at their mobile
phone call logs and their phone bills (usually available on the carrier’s
Web site). If you don’t recognize the names or numbers listed, place a
call to find out. Just be conscious of your children’s own respect for 
privacy when doing so — you don’t want them to be upset that you’re
checking in on their call activities.
 The people in your children’s mobile phone Contacts lists or buddy
lists: Another simple way to check in on your kids is to look at their
Contacts list on their mobile phone. Some may have nicknames, so 
make a list and then spend time with your children to discuss who those
contacts are and whether they’re friends or people they usually commu-
nicate with. Don’t be offended by the nicknames your kids may have for
their peers and other people — remember kids will always be kids. If
you’re offended by some of the names listed, talk with your children
about changing them to something better or putting real names in their
contact lists.
 The people your kids receive text messages from and the ones they
reply to: You can always check your children’s message logs to view
sent or received messages. Out of respect for your children, you should
36
Part I: Welcome to the Mobile Internet 

also let them know that you will do so periodically so that they’re aware
of your interest in their text messaging use. If you’re concerned about
the frequency of text messaging or the types of reactions your children
make when text messaging, let them know.
 The people (and services) your kids are connecting with in mobile
Internet cyberspace: Again, all mobile phone transactions are kept in
various logs and reports on your kids’ mobile phones. Just like your
computer, most mobile phones have history, cookie, and bookmark
capabilities for you to view what your kids are doing on their mobile
browsers. Some mobile phones have more detailed reports than others.
Check the mobile phone user manual for details on what’s available on
your children’s mobile phones. Don’t forget that some kids may clear
their messages and browsing histories so that they don’t leave any
unwanted cybertrails of their activities, just like they probably do on
their computers. Our best advice for mobile Internet use, as with
Internet use on a computer, is to keep an open dialogue with your kids
to let them know they should be as careful surfing the mobile Internet as
the computer Internet. You may also be interested in restricting your
children’s access to mature content on the mobile Internet, a topic we
discuss in more detail later in this chapter.
Another way to find more detailed information on the time, date, and dura-
tion of mobile phone activities is on your children’s mobile phone billing
statements. Here are some tips:
 If you’re uncertain about the numbers on the billing statement:
Write them down, ask your children to help identify who they belong to,
and, if you feel that you must know right away, call or text the number
yourself to identify the person at the other end of the line.
 If this monitoring approach upsets your children: Be aware that 
they may not necessarily be hiding anything, but may more likely be
embarrassed by the possibility of their friends finding out that you’re
checking up on them. Be sure to explain to your children why you’re
checking, if you do, and be careful about the calls you make just to 
say hello, in a friendly manner, on behalf of your children. Or, send a
simple text message just to confirm that you know who your children
are communicating with.
 If you don’t like the response or the people your children are commu-
nicating with: Talk to your children first to try to find out what the prob-
lem is, and report any suspicious activities to the authorities (and your
wireless carrier) if you feel that something isn’t quite right about the
types of people or communications going on.
Wireless carriers also make details available about mobile phone activities,
and you can request a report detailing your children’s mobile-phone voice,
text messaging, and Web browsing use. You may spend some time obtaining
the report, and you may be required to request the information by e-mail or
37
Chapter 3: Kids and the Mobile Internet

letter with complete copies of your and your children’s identification. This
strategy protects not only you but also your children from the release of any
other nonauthorized information about either of you.
An excellent way to change your kids’ behavior is to set a good example for
them. Monitor your own use of the mobile phone, and share the results with
your kids. This way, you treat them as equals. You can also offer a deal with
your kids: If they will adhere to the guidelines that you have agreed on, you
will too.
Choosing phones and services just for kids
To help out parents, some services are geared toward monitoring younger
kids’ use of the mobile phone and its services. For example, in the United
States, the following programs are helpful for younger kids and “tweens” 
(not young children but not quite teenagers):
 Kajeet www.kajeet.com: This pay-as-you-go mobile phone service is
powered by the Sprint PCS network.
 Firefly (www.fireflymobile.com): This service is available on the
AT&T mobile network.
Parents can buy Kajeet or Firefly mobile phones in many of the larger retail
stores, and can sign up for their services online. With both mobile phones
offered, kids and parents can customize settings and selected services that
meet their family’s unique needs. You can make decisions about these issues:
 People: Choose the people your kids can call and the ones they can
receive calls from.
 Services: Choose the types of mobile Internet services that your kids
can and cannot use.
 Contracts and fees: You have no need to sign a contract or pay the 
activation or termination fees that come with other contracts.
You should have your credit card on file with either service to make sure 
that you children’s mobile service has the proper amount of funds available
for services that they or you may want to access in case of any emergency
requirements.
Although each of these products and services has its benefits, each also
charges a premium for the mobile phones and services that are offered.
Compare these products and services with those offered directly by your 
preferred wireless carrier.

Restricting access to mature content
Giving your children access to mobile Internet services is similar to giving
them access to the Internet: It provides access to mature content that 
may not be best suited for them to see, or provides access to people they
shouldn’t communicate with.
Begin exploring this topic at www.fcc.gov/cgb/consumerfacts/
protectingchildren.html. This U.S. Federal Communications
Commission (FCC) Web page talks about protecting children from adult 
content on wireless devices.
Print the information on this page and review it with all your family members,
and do it now rather than later. Check out http://www.fcc.gov/cgb/
consumerfacts/protectingchildren.html.
In addition to the points we discuss earlier in this chapter about monitoring
your children’s mobile phone use, the FCC report offers tips on discussing
mobile phones and services available with your wireless carrier so that you
can become informed about what your children will have access to and how
you can address mature content concerns.
Another site that can help you is WiredSafety (www.wiredsafety.org), an
online safety, education, and help group, with help for parents to keep online
pornography away from their kids.
Getting Cool with School 
and the Mobile Internet
Sometimes mobile phones belong in schools, and sometimes they don’t. We
agree that having kids relentlessly browsing the mobile Internet, sending text
messages, or watching videos on their mobile phones isn’t a good idea. And
it can be quite disruptive to the class.
On the other hand, think of the computers’ beneficial impact on education.
We think that the mobile Internet offers similar opportunities in a different
package.
The following sections explore the pros and cons so that you can be aware 
of the issues as you send your kids off to school, help them with homework,
or even talk to their teachers.
40
Part I: Welcome to the Mobile Internet 

Keeping an eye on negative factors
Here’s an interesting note about kids surfing the Net from their mobile
phones: Teachers generally aren’t fond of allowing this activity in the 
classroom. Some schools don’t even let mobile phones into the building 
or on the grounds unless they’re turned off — no Silent mode and no 
Vibrate mode. Teachers have good reasons for taking this stance: They 
want to
 Prevent cheating: You might think that passing around a paper note or
looking over someone’s shoulder during a test was a tricky maneuver.
Imagine sending a text message, to be passed from mobile phone to
mobile phone, with all the multiple-choice questions answered. Not in
my classroom, you don’t! Or, wouldn’t it have been handy to be able to 
go to the made-for-mobile Yahoo! Web site to look up the Pythagorean
theorem?
 Minimize disruptions: The issue isn’t just about receiving or accessing
information at the wrong time and place. It’s about etiquette — mobile
phone etiquette. Teachers have enough to deal with in their classrooms
without having to hear the latest annoying ringtone indicating a message
from a friend wanting to see whether class is over yet. You can see why
mobile phones aren’t well accepted in the classroom. Receiving calls
and text messages and surfing made-for-mobile Internet sites can all 
wait until recess or lunch or until school is over for the day and it’s time
to play.
 Respect kids’ privacy needs: Speaking of play, school personnel are 
also quite conscious about the capabilities of the latest mobile phones
and their connectivity to the mobile Internet. Taking pictures and videos
of the school yard from a mobile phone to upload to Facebook or Flickr
may seem like a cool thing to do, but who’s giving the student permis-
sion to share the images? Who knows who’s looking at the images?
School boards and parents alike are concerned about the privacy issues
on behalf of all students.
Considering the positive factors 
of the virtual classroom
Schools are increasingly recognizing the advantages that mobile phones have
for family connectivity and security for students. Mobile phone technology
has advanced to the point that students can now use a mobile phone to take
pictures and record sound and video.
41
Chapter 3: Kids and the Mobile Internet

Here are some useful ideas that your kids can try anywhere and anytime —
with permission:
 Search for information by using a browser. Use a mobile phone on 
a Niagara Falls field trip, for example, to find out more information 
about how some waterfalls produce hydroelectricity.
 Share photos. Take pictures with a mobile phone to upload to lab 
partners back at school with images of the trees and leaves they’re 
collecting “virtually” in the forest across town.
 Document your activities. Attend a school trip event with their mobile
phone and record input from everyone in the group on a mobile blog.
Evaluating school policies 
that affect students
School policies are now being created for the use of mobile phones while 
protecting students and maintaining a solid educational environment. For 
an example of how one school deals with mobile phone use at and around
school, check out the mobile phone acceptable-use policy at Ivanhoe
Grammar School in Victoria, Australia: www.igs.vic.edu.au/discover/
policies/mobile_ phones.htm.
If you’re a parent who has kids in school and they have mobile phones, find
out the school’s policy for mobile phone use. If no mobile phone policies
exist, work with the school’s administration to get them established. Here are
some questions to ask:
 Under which circumstances can mobile phones be used on school 
property?
 Who decides when and where students can use their mobile phones on
school property?
 In which circumstances can a mobile phone be switched on during 
classroom lessons?
 In case of emergency, how can students be contacted? Should parents
call directly, for example, or should emergency calls be directed to the
school office?
 When can students make a phone call to their parents in case of 
emergency?
 What are the guidelines for confiscating a mobile phone?
 Should students label their mobile phones with their name so that they
can be returned if lost, or should the phones be registered before being
brought on school property?
42
Part I: Welcome to the Mobile Internet 

 What is the school’s responsibility for the mobile phone while it’s on
school property?
 What are the sanctions if a student uses a mobile phone during an exam
or assessment?
 Which sanctions are in place if a student is caught cyberbullying by
using a mobile phone on school property?
 Who is responsible if a student is in any way harmed or harassed or is 
in any other way offended from the use of a mobile phone by other 
students on school property?
Watching Out for Cyberbullying
The Internet gave us places where tweens gossip or even bully others:
Facebook and MySpace are full of unwanted images and videos of kids teas-
ing or threatening to expose each other’s secrets. The mobile Internet is 
the same — and it will increase gossip and cyberbullying faster than ever.
Rumors spread faster than on the Internet because mobile Internet access is
instant and always with you — wherever you are. Mobile Internet access and
always-on services, such as text messaging and the capability to capture and
upload malicious pictures and videos to the Internet, have given cyberbully-
ing a new form. And, as mentioned earlier in this chapter, parents will have
even more difficulty finding out how their kids are using their mobile phones
and then controlling that use.
A study in the United Kingdom, released by the children’s charity NCH (for-
merly National Children’s Home), found that 14 percent of 11- to 19-year-olds
had been threatened or harassed by text messages.
43
Chapter 3: Kids and the Mobile Internet
Bluetooth bullying
No, Bluetooth bullying isn’t about being physi-
cally beaten up, as the Vikings were sometimes
known for. (Bluetooth is named after King
Harald Blåtand — Bluetooth — the King of
Denmark and Norway in the late tenth century.)
Bluetooth bullying refers to cyberbullying that
uses the Bluetooth technology built in to almost
every mobile phone now sold. People some-
times distribute videos, using the Bluetooth
technology, of fighting or other interesting
events that happen in school with threats or
warnings sent to other phones. These images
can then be uploaded to Flickr, Facebook, or
another photo blog or social networking site
with the purpose of harassing someone. A
simple way to stop Bluetooth bullying is to turn
off that feature on your kid’s mobile phone or
simply buy a phone with no Bluetooth built in.
Different phone models use different tech-
niques to turn off Bluetooth. Just look for the
stylized B icon or the name Bluetooth on the
phone screen or Features menu to switch it off.

To find out more on how to be more proactive in protecting your children
from mobile cyberbullying, visit the useful Web site www.stoptextbully.
com. (It’s sponsored by NCH.) It covers the key mobile-bullying topics of
voice calls, text messaging, e-mail, pictures and videos, chat, Web, and iden-
tity. Visit the site to help create awareness about the problem, provide more
education on mobile cyberbullying problems, and find a list of additional
resources.
Cyberbullying is different from traditional physical bullying and is harder to
detect because it doesn’t result in physical bruises, ripped clothing, or stolen
mobile phones. However, any parent with school-age children can look for 
a key set of signs to talk about with their kids — and with the kids’ teachers
and coaches and the parents of their friends. Be on the lookout for kids who
 Display symptoms of depression
 Express or exhibit anxiety
 Act or speak out of fear or anger
 Refuse to attend school or sports clubs or social activities
 Let grades slip or display diminishing levels of accomplishment or
decreasing social behavior
 Avoid friends or relatives
 Hesitate to use their computers or to answer their mobile phones
Of course, any of these psychological signs could be a symptom of other
issues, but you would be wise to discuss any of these signs openly and non-
judgmentally with your kids. Most importantly, tell your kids — and show
them — that you love them. Doing so builds up confidence, self-esteem, and
trust, which will prevent most bullying from happening to your kids.
If you feel that a child is being cyberbullied in any way, detail the situation as
best as you can, contact the proper authorities at your police department
and at your child’s school, and contact the wireless carrier to further assist
you with the problem.
Perhaps the best way to detect whether your kids are cyberbullied is to
search for your kids’ names online. This way, you might find out what is 
being said about them. You can also actively find out which social network 
or instant messaging system they use and then join those networks. This
strategy has a double edge, however, because it can lead to cyberbullying
when your kids’ friends find out that you’re “spying” on them.

E
ven if you already read the first three chapters in this book to find out
about your mobile phone, wireless-enabled personal digital assistant
(PDA), or mobile Internet terminal — and all that they can do — these devices
can do much more than what you may have previously thought. With them in
hand, you can access the mobile Internet whenever and wherever you may be.
In this chapter, we explain what a mobile browser is and highlight what you
can do with it. We show you how to locate the browser on your phone, how to
connect to the mobile Web, and how to use your mobile browser’s basic features.
Knowing What to Expect 
from Mobile Browsing
For lots of people, the most common way to access the Web is (just like on a
computer) by using an Internet browser. A mobile browser (also commonly
referred to as a minibrowser, microbrowser, or mobile Web browser) is an appli-
cation capable of displaying and rendering Web sites on your mobile phone.
Before you venture out to the Web, and perhaps even before you buy your
mobile phone to connect to the Internet, it’s helpful to understand what you can
expect. This section explores how mobile browsing compares to computer

48
Part II: Mobile Internet, Here It Is — Now What?! 
browsing, and also how your service plan and phone can affect what you can
see and do on the mobile Internet.
Comparing mobile and computer 
Internet browsers
The mobile browser is similar to your computer browser in that it can be used
for a wide range of activities such as search, information access, and entertain-
ment, including downloading applications and content to your phone. In fact,
according to the leading mobile industry research firm M:Metrics, people most
commonly use their mobile browsers for these activities:
 Search: Find and look for information; such as an address, directions, traffic
information, news stories, movie listings, restaurants, recipes, and more.
Find information about a company or product by going on the mobile Web
to Google or Yahoo! directly from your phone.
 Community or finding dates: The mobile phone is a personal device,
and more and more people are using it to stay in touch and interact with
their social networks when away from the computer. Access your Facebook
or MySpace services from your mobile browser.
 Accessing financial accounts: With banking and stock trading online,
you can now access your accounts, balances, transfer funds, trade
stocks and more by using your mobile phone. You can even locate the
nearest ATM to get cash, for example.
 Browsing news and information: Read the latest headlines or current
events articles, and keep up on entertainment news and your favorite
humor columns and comics. Track information about your finances, travel
plans, personal health, horoscope, sports, and weather forecasts. CNN,
BusinessWeek and Fox News keep you updated on the move from their
mobile Web sites.
 Shopping: From made-for-mobile shopping sites, product and service
comparison shopping services, and even virtual shopping malls, the
mobile Web brings it all to you where ever you are. Mainstream Internet
shopping sites, such as eBay, Amazon, and more are going mobile.
 Messaging: Send personalized business e-mail, swap instant messages,
send text messages and multimedia messages, and maintain your social
networking site from anywhere you are in wireless carrier coverage.
Windows Live Mail, Gmail, and related services accessed from your mobile
browser are quite similar to your Web mail.
 Downloading digital content: Check out top-rated made-for-mobile
graphics, ringtones, games, music, and video files on the fly. All available
from your wireless carrier’s mobile Web site from entertainment providers,
such as Universal Music, MTV, EA, CBS, or from a third-party content
provider unaffiliated with the carrier.

Although the mobile phone browser is similar to your Internet browser in
concept, in practice it has some stark differences. For the time being, don’t
expect to find the same rich, interactive experiences on your mobile phone
browser as you do on your Internet browser, because of their differences in
these areas:
 Language: Your mobile phone browser doesn’t always speak the same
languages as your Internet browser, so you can’t view nearly as many
Web sites on a mobile phone. (See the nearby sidebar, “The language of
Internet browsers” for details.)
49
Chapter 4: Choosing a Phone and Mobile Browser
The language of Internet browsers: Why don’t all
Web sites show up on your phone?
People have become accustomed to rich, inter-
active Internet experiences on their computers,
an experience that often cannot be had with a
mobile Web browser. The reason for this (and it
is deceptively simple): The underlying technol-
ogy of the Internet browsers on your computer
and on your phone differs significantly. Because
of this difference, less than 1 percent of Web
sites that now exist can be viewed properly, if
at all, on a mobile phone (unless the user has an
iPhone, BlackBerry, or a full Internet-like
browser on their smartphone or PDA).
Most Internet Web sites aren’t composed in
languages that a mobile Web browser can
understand.
The language of the computer browser
Web sites designed to be viewed by computers
are developed in a number of different program-
ming languages, such as HTML (Hypertext
Markup Language), Flash, XML, Ajax, or PhP. Your
computer Internet browser is designed so that it
can read and understand the instructions written
in these languages and a vast number of other
ones. Moreover, your computer Internet browser
can easily learn new languages. If it doesn’t
understand a language in a Web site, the devel-
oper of the site can instruct the computer Internet
browser to download an engine or a translator
that helps the computer Internet browser under-
stand how to follow the instructions of the new
language; for example, your computer Internet
browser may be instructed to download a Flash
player or video player so that you can play Flash
games or see videos.
The language of the mobile browser
Similar to your computer Internet browser,
mobile browsers have their own language. One
of the first languages developed for mobile
browsers was Wireless Application Protocol
(WAP), a derivative of HTML. WAP 1.0, released
in the late 1990s, was designed to address all
limitations of the mobile phone and bandwidth
constrained mobile networks. A new and
improved version of WAP, WAP 2.0, offers a
richer mobile Web experience. In addition to
WAP, other mobile browser languages have
been developed, such as XHTML (or XML
Hypertext Markup Language), CHTML (compact
Hypertext Markup Language), and KHTML
(Konqueror Hypertext Markup Language). Each
of these different mobile browser languages
has been developed to improve your experience
when viewing the Web on your mobile phone,
but they’re all mobile-device and wireless car-
rier dependent and therefore don’t work on all
phones or networks.

 Power capability: Your mobile phone isn’t as powerful as your computer
in terms of processing capabilities and memory.
 Screen size: Your mobile phone’s screen is much smaller than your
computer screen.
 Input devices: The keyboard and input methods tend to be quite different.
 Network bandwidth: The data speed varies greatly across different
wireless carrier networks.
Because of these differences, not all Internet-based Web sites can be viewed
on your mobile phone, and you’ll have a different Internet experience on your
mobile phone than the one you have on your computer.
The best way to check how a Web site (either Internet or made-for-mobile)
will look on a mobile phone is by using the excellent, free service that the
dotMobi company offers at http://ready.mobi. Simply enter any Internet or
mobile Web site URL (an address like the one for this book’s Web site, mifd.
mobi, or for a better example to see Internet and mobile Web site differences
try www.bmw.com and then bmw.mobi), and you’ll receive a full report on
how the Web site will work on a mobile phone browser. The site also gives
you a full report on the estimated costs associated with surfing the site from
your mobile phone.
Determining which services 
your carrier can deliver
Accessing the Internet with your mobile browser is easy. Before you jump
onto the mobile Internet super information highway, however, you need to
know some basic information:
 Which service your carrier offers: The service you choose affects how
you browse as well as how much you pay for the service. All wireless
carriers pay special attention to the configurations of the mobile phones
they offer and the experience you have on their wireless data networks.
You may see a huge difference between the mobile Web experiences
between operators and mobile phones, including the types of sites you
can access, the quality of the sites when you access them, and the types
of content that can be downloaded.
 Which type of wireless carrier contract you have: Access to the mobile
Web is a data service, in wireless carrier parlance. To use the data ser-
vices from a wireless carrier, almost all of them require that you have a
postpaid (rather than a prepaid or pay-as-you-go) contract. A postpaid
contract is a contract where you pay at the end of each month for all the
50
Part II: Mobile Internet, Here It Is — Now What?! 

services you’ve used, while a prepaid contract is one in which you pay
in advance for the use of services (much like the difference between a
credit card and a debit card). Check with your wireless carrier to see
which type of plan you have. In the meantime, here are a couple of
guidelines to better understand the types of available contracts:
• If you have to “buy minutes” or use a prepaid card to “top up” your
phone: You’re on a prepaid plan.
• If your minutes are deducted from a “bucket” of minutes that you’re
paying for on a credit card monthly: You’re on a postpaid plan.
See Chapter 5 for more information about wireless carrier data-plan 
contracts.
 Which wireless data plan you have: The wireless data plan you have
significantly affects your mobile browsing experience, not just because
of cost but also because of speed. You can find three basic plans:
• Basic metered plan: Services are billed for as you use them on the
network. It’s usually the most expensive way to go mobile.
• Fixed plan or data bucket: A pre-determined amount of wireless
data you expect to consume in a month and purchasing it at a bulk
discounted rate versus the pay-as-you-go metered way.
• Unlimited plan or all-you-can-eat: Similar to your home Internet
access DSL or cable plan, where you pay one price per month for
as much network access as you want.
If you’re planning to surf the mobile Web frequently, seriously consider signing
up for an unlimited data plan; otherwise, you will end up spending a lot of
money when you really don’t need to. Also check with your wireless carrier
for bundled offerings that combine other mobile Internet services, such as
text messaging, e-mail, and more with your mobile Web access. See Chapter 5
for an overview of different types of wireless data plans.
Finding out which class your 
phone or device is in
The mobile browser experience varies dramatically across the different classes
of phones. The type of mobile phone you have has the biggest effect on your
mobile Web browsing experience. Your experience is affected by both the evo-
lutionary generation of the type of browser you have and the class of phone
you have.
51
Chapter 4: Choosing a Phone and Mobile Browser

These five common classes of phones are now on the market:
 Traditional: The most common phone model now on the market; 
comprises about 85 percent of all mobile phones. This type runs a 
real-time operating system (RTOS), which is a closed operating system.
Two common RTOSs exist:
• Nucleus: A homegrown operating system created by the mobile
phone’s manufacturer
• BREW: From Qualcomm; used predominantly by Verizon Wireless
in the United States
A closed operating system limits the types of modification you can make
to your phone. For example, you probably can use only the mobile browser
that came with your phone. You can’t download and install aftermarket
mobile browsers, a topic that’s explained in more detail in a sidebar
later in this chapter called “Aftermarket mobile browsers.”
 BlackBerry: The BlackBerry is a class of phone that is offered by Research
In Motion (RIM). It is best known for its mobile e-mail capabilities.
However, the BlackBerry is excellent for accessing the mobile Web. It
has an open operating system, and you can easily load new applications
and browsers. You are not limited to using only those applications that
came with the device.
 Wireless PDA or smartphone: The smartphone is a mobile phone class
that uses an open operating system, similar in concept to a computer.
The most popular smartphone operating systems are Symbian, Microsoft
Windows Mobile, and Palm. Expected to join this list are a number of
52
Part II: Mobile Internet, Here It Is — Now What?! 
Aftermarket mobile browsers
Adding aftermarket browsers is a very common
way to improve the performance of your mobile
Web browsing experience; an aftermarket
browser may be of better quality than the one
that came with the phone originally and it might
support additional functionality that you want,
and/or simply be easier to use. A very similar
Internet browser comparison would be the avail-
abilities of Internet Explorer, Firefox, Opera,
Safari, and more for your computer. Each one
offers its own features and benefits to improve
and customize your Web browsing experience.
For many smartphones, wireless dedicated
devices, and both the BlackBerry and iPhone,
you can download an aftermarket mobile
browser — one that didn’t come with the phone
when you bought it. Here are some popular
browsers:
 Opera Mobile and Opera Mini, from Opera
Software: www.opera.com/products/
mobile or www.operamini.com
 Minimo, from Mozilla: www.mozilla.
org/projects/minimo
 ThunderHawk, from Bitstream, Inc.: www.
bitstream.com/wireless

Linux-based operating systems in development as well as the Google
Android operating system, now expected in the second half of 2008.
You can easily load new applications and browsers on smartphones.
You aren’t limited to using only those applications that came with the
device.
 Apple iPhone: A phone model in a class all by itself. Although it’s true
that the overall market penetration rate of the iPhone is low compared
to the billions of mobile phones in the market, it’s equally true that the
iPhone has had a significant impact on the future of mobile Web browsing
by allowing you to surf and view almost any type of Web site — Internet
and mobile — on its screen. The iPhone operating system was initially
closed, however, Apple has begun to open it up, and increasingly
you’re able to install new applications on it.
 Dedicated wireless-enabled terminal: Another device that can be
used for accessing the mobile Web by using a browser. All other device
classes are primarily phones with the purposes of enabling voice calls,
while the dedicated wireless enabled terminal class are designed for
purposes other than voice calls. Examples of wireless-enabled termi-
nals include the Sony PSP for gaming, the Apple iTouch, and Nokia 700
designed solely for Internet browsing. Often, with these devices, you’re
restricted to using the applications that came with it.
Launching and Controlling 
Your Mobile Browser
To connect to the mobile Web by using the radio network of one of the
wireless carriers, you simply launch your mobile browser. If you’re access-
ing the Web for the first time by way of your mobile browser, most wireless
carriers present you with billing-option plans directly over the phone. After
you select a data-plan billing option by completing a form on your mobile
browser, you’re connected to the Web. Or, you can call your wireless car-
rier or visit one of its local stores and sign up for a data plan in person.
Traditional phones offer limited, but still quite usable, mobile Web brows-
ing capabilities. Almost all traditional phones use some version of a WAP
browser. You typically have three ways to launch your mobile browser:
 A physical button on your mobile phone (see Figure 4-1).
 A preprogrammed soft key (see Figure 4-1).
 The application’s navigation menu. You launch the application menu
typically with a soft key named Menu, and you typically find the
mobile browser either on the main menu or in the Applications or
Services folder.

Chapter 4: Choosing a Phone and Mobile Browser

To navigate the mobile Web on a traditional phone, use the up- and down- and
left- and right-arrow keys to browse the link options. Some browser windows
showing different link styles are shown in Figure 4-2.
Traditional phones tend to be closed systems, so you’re limited to only the
mobile browser that came with your phone; that is, unless your carrier sup-
ports downloading an aftermarket application and lets it access the Internet.
On a BlackBerry
Launching and navigating the mobile browser on a BlackBerry is straightforward:
1. In the applications window of the mobile phone, use the selection
wheel or track ball and select the globe icon.
2. After the mobile browser has launched, use the selection wheel or
track ball to select links or access the mobile browser options, as
shown in Figure 4-3.

Reaching the Internet with WiFi
Only a handful of new smartphones, wireless
dedicated devices, some BlackBerry versions,
and the iPhone can connect to the Internet by
using the WiFi channel. Take a look at your
device’s user manual for instructions on how to
enable the WiFi radio, if it has one.
One of the key benefits of connecting to the
Internet by WiFi from your WiFi-enabled phone
is money. The money you save by  your expen-
sive, limited wireless data plan in lieu of free
unlimited WiFi access, for example. And, some-
times wireless data coverage is not available at
all, but WiFi is — like in a basement or on a
train.

The BlackBerry, unlike traditional phones, uses an open operating system, so
you can also download many aftermarket applications and browsers. You’re
not limited to using the ones supplied with the phone. Typically, three browsers
are loaded on your BlackBerry: the BlackBerry browser (basically, your book-
marks manager), a standard Internet-like browser, and a WAP browser
provided by the wireless carrier.
On a Symbian OS smartphone
Symbian is the most widely used smartphone mobile operating system in the
world. To launch your mobile browser on a Symbian-based phone, follow
these steps:
1. Select either the globe icon from the applications short strip (along
the top of the screen) or the Applications menu button on the phone.
2. Scroll to the Services globe, shown in Figure 4-4 (in Symbian-speak,
it’s the mobile browser), and then click it.
3. After the page opens, use the Options soft key to open the Features
menu and then press the up- and down- and left- and right-arrow keys
on your mobile phone to scroll through the site.
On a Microsoft Windows 
Mobiles smartphone
Launching the mobile Web from a smartphone running Microsoft Windows
Mobile is easy. Your phone typically uses one of these two methods:
 Internet Explorer icon: Find the icon along the applications shortcut
strip at the top of the screen.

 Windows Start flag: It’s in the upper-left corner of your smartphone’s
screen, as shown in Figure 4-5. Click the Internet Explorer icon on the
applications list.
Microsoft Windows Mobile is an open operating system, so you can down-
load aftermarket applications and browsers if you want to use something dif-
ferent from Internet Explorer on your mobile phone.
On a Palm smartphone, such as a Treo
Accessing the mobile Web from a Palm-enabled phone is simple:
1. Select the Web button from the applications list.
2. On the address bar, along the top of the page, enter the URL of the site
you want to visit, as shown in Figure 4-6.

On an Apple iPhone
The Apple iPhone, available only from AT&T in the U.S. for the time being,
provides a rich, interactive, mobile browsing experience that’s different from
what you find on any other phone model. The iPhone uses a full Internet-like
browser: It shows you complete Web sites, as shown in Figure 4-7. The iPhone
comes with a built-in Apple Safari browser; to launch it and browse the mobile
Web, simply click the Safari button.
On a dedicated wireless terminal
The dedicated wireless terminal mobile browser acts exactly like the browser
on a smartphone or an iPhone. In fact, more often than not, these devices use
the same browsers as smartphones or iPhones — the only difference is wireless
terminals were designed for applications and Internet access with very lim-
ited to no voice calling capabilities.

Navigating with Common 
Browser Features
After you’re on the Web, you’re ready to navigate it. Depending on the class
of your phone model, you might access these navigation features in different
ways. These features are generally available across all phones and browsers,
however. You can access each feature described here from your mobile browser’s
Options menu or Tools menu (the features may be renamed slightly across
different models):
 Open: Opens or launches a bookmarked URL or subfolder.
 Refresh/Reload: Updates the page.
 Back: Returns you to the previous page you were viewing.
 Bookmark: Acts as your Favorites repository. You can save the URL of
the mobile Web page, just as you can on your computer Internet browser, to
access the site quickly the next time you launch your mobile browser.
 Go To/Address: Lets you manually enter a URL for a mobile Web site.
You enter the URL and then select OK or Enter. It’s the equivalent of the
address bar on your computer Internet browser.
 Select a link: All mobile browsers let you click links on a page. Some,
such as the traditional mobile phone, require that you scroll up and
down with the phone’s arrow keys; others, such as most PDAs or the
iPhone, let you use a stylus or your finger to click a link.
 Scroll up or down: Every mobile browser has a mechanism for scrolling
up and down on a page, using the phone’s arrow keys, a stylus, or your
finger. Some phones may even have a small joystick to not only scroll up
and down but also pan left and right or zoom in and out on a mobile Web
page. Joysticks are usually found only on the higher-end traditional
phones, smartphones, PDAs, and on the iPhone.
 Exit: All mobile browsers have an Exit feature. If your phone is not sub-
scribed to an unlimited data plan, be sure to use the Exit feature when
leaving a site. If you don’t, and you abandon the browser to use another
phone feature (to call someone or use the calculator, for example), you
may still incur data charges.
 Advanced features: You may also find advanced features on your mobile
browser, such as the ability to delete browsing history, cookies (such as
ones for form file in data and saved passwords), cached sites and pages
(use this feature especially if a Web page isn’t rendering properly or your
phone memory is getting full). You’ll also find a Settings feature, used for
configuring access details and establishing a connection with your wireless
carrier’s Internet access gateways.

Getting On the Mobile Internet:
Wireless Carriers and 
Service Plans
In This Chapter
 Sorting out the myriad wireless carriers and their offerings
 Making sense of the wireless carrier plans, billing models, and service options
 Choosing the wireless data service plan that meets your needs
You’re ready to start browsing the mobile Web, and maybe even use other
wireless data applications, such as text messaging or an e-mail service.
However, the thought of doing so puts fear in your heart because you have
no idea how much these services will cost or how to figure it out.
Reading this chapter will help quell your fears.
In this chapter, we discuss the different types of wireless carrier networks in
the United States, share basic details about different plans and options, and
arm you with the important questions you should ask your wireless carrier
before signing up for a plan and its various service options.
To find out more about the programs and services offered by the wireless
carriers, visit them directly either online or at the retailer nearest you. You
can also check out our Web site where we have links and directories to 
all the wireless carriers in the world.
Comparing Wireless Carriers
Wireless carriers (mobile network operators) are the organizations that pro-
vide mobile phones and value-added services. The carriers provide you with
the ability to make and receive phone calls, send and receive text messages,

access the mobile Web, take and share pictures, find driving directions, and
do so much more — all from your mobile phone. Not all wireless carriers are
alike; they come in all shapes and sizes. This list describes the three types of
wireless carriers:
 National: Offer retail and commercial services throughout the country.
The United States alone has more than 50 wireless carriers; worldwide,
there are hundreds. The largest national carriers are AT&T, Sprint, 
T-Mobile, and Verizon Wireless. These carriers serve a little over 90 per-
cent of the mobile subscribers in the United States and have the most
advanced high-speed networks, handsets, and services offerings. If you
travel to other cities or regions often, national carriers are your best
route for going mobile. Also, if your business associates and friends are
all over the country, national carriers offer very good in-network service
plans to connect with people on other networks with reduced rates.
 Regional: Operate their services within a limited locale and region — for
example, Alltel, Cincinnati Bell, Leap Wireless, and U.S. Cellular. These
carriers offer limited coverage by region and usually have very good 
networks, handsets, and value-added services in order to compete with
the national carriers. If your travel is limited to your tri-state area or 
city, then regional carriers offer great service plans to keep the national
carriers away from their local customer base.
 Third-party, or mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs): Lease their
mobile networks (cell towers, radio spectrum, and infrastructure, for
example) from one or more wireless carriers. Virgin Mobile, for example
(which leases its network access from Sprint) offers unique branded 
services to target youth demographic and customer segments. Helio,
another MVNO provider in the United States, delivers high-speed, made-
for-mobile network service based on similar services offered in Korea 
by its parent company, SK Telecom. Most MVNOs use national carrier
networks, so their networks and services are as good as the national
carriers. MVNOs usually cater to niche markets — like the youth 
market or culturally distinct markets, for example — with unique highly
targeted offerings.
Being able to distinguish between the different types of wireless carriers is
important because their features — network quality, phone models, service
and support, and cost — vary greatly across carrier networks and regions.
For example, some wireless carriers support data services, and others do
not. If you want access to all the great mobile Internet products and services
available — and because you’re reading this book, we assume that you are —
be sure to sign with a carrier that offers the suite of services to best meet
your needs.
62
Part II: Mobile Internet, Here It Is — Now What?! 

Some factors to consider when selecting a mobile carrier are the types of
phones they offer, the applications, services, and content they offer, their
plans and costs, the quality of the coverage, the quality of their customer 
services and existing customer satisfaction ratings, to name just a few. You
may find, for example, that an MVNO or regional carrier provides services
that fit your needs, so be sure to look at these when choosing a carrier.
To find out about the other wireless carriers in the United States, check out
the carrier links on the CTIA—Wireless Association Web site: www.ctia.
org/membership/ctia_members.
To find out about the wireless carriers in the rest of the world, visit the GSM
Association Web site: www.gsmworld.com. Click the GSM Roaming link to
find coverage maps and a geographically organized list of more than 600 wire-
less carriers globally.
If you ever need to move your business to a different wireless carrier, feel free
to keep your phone number. Local number portability (see the nearby side-
bar) lets you take your number with you to any mobile carrier you choose.
Ensuring that that you get what you want
When you’re choosing a wireless carrier and a type of phone to buy, keep
these questions in mind:
 Will you call people? If so, who?
 Which mobile Internet products and services do you want — text mes-
saging, browsing, games, pictures, music, e-mail, and instant messaging
(from either personal or corporate accounts)?
 Will you access the mobile Web or use other applications and services
offered by your wireless carrier or third-party companies?
63
Chapter 5: Wireless Carriers and Service Plans
Canadian wireless carriers
Canada has 31⁄2 national wireless carriers: Fido,
Bell Mobility, Rogers Wireless, and TELUS. (The
half occurs because Rogers owns Fido, but it’s
still marketed separately.) Regional carriers,
such as Alliant, MTS Mobility, and SaskTel
Mobility, cover provincial and territorial regions,
and MVNOs, including Virgin Mobile Canada,
President’s Choice Mobile, and Vidéotron, 
cover the same areas as the national and
regional carriers whose networks they resell.
The mobile phones, services, and support that
Canadian carriers offer are quite similar to the
ones offered by U.S. wireless carriers. For 
more information about wireless carriers in
Canada, go to www.cwta.ca, the Canadian
Wireless Telecommunications Association
(CWTA) Web site.

The answer to these questions determines the type of phone you should 
buy and the plan and services you should sign up for. It is always good to 
get a rough idea of what you are looking for when subscribing to a wireless
carrier before you walk in to their retail outlet or shop online. You save time
and money by getting the right mobile phone and service programs tailored
to your needs. Doing a little upfront research helps you avoid making a 
compulsive buy.
Covering the fine print
When choosing your wireless carrier and the contract for services, do your
homework before signing up. You should know exactly what your contract
says about these issues:
 Adding and dropping service options during the life of your contract:
Adding and dropping services shouldn’t cost you extra. If your wireless
carrier charges you a fee, choose a different carrier.
 Try-before-you-buy promotions: It never hurts to ask for one, two, or
even three months of free access to try a wireless carrier’s mobile
Internet service offerings or bundles. Most are flexible and can give 
you a couple of months to try a new service.
• If no promotions are available: Make sure that no penalties apply if
you want to try the service for a few months and then decide to
stop it.
• If promotions are available: Make sure that you know exactly what
is included and what happens after the promotion expires.
64
Part II: Mobile Internet, Here It Is — Now What?! 
Local number portability
The Federal Communications Commission (FCC)
now requires that all wireless carriers offer
local number portability (LNP) support — if you
remain in the same geographical area, you can
switch your mobile phone wireless carrier and
keep your existing phone number. If you’re
moving from California to New York, for exam-
ple, you can usually keep the phone number if
you keep the same carrier, although you can’t
transfer your California number to a different
New York account.
Remember: Do not terminate your service with
your existing carrier before you sign up with
your new wireless carrier, because you can
only transfer a number that’s active. Let the new
carrier help you transfer your old number to its
service.
To find out more about local number portability,
visit the FCC Web site at www.fcc.
gov/cgb/consumerfacts/numbport.
html.

If you’re buying a new phone along with service, you can often negotiate a
discount on your phone. Try to get a few months of free service or access 
to one more services and features that may be offered.
If you’re replacing an existing phone, recycle it! It’s not only good for the envi-
ronment; you can get some cash back for it or a tax deduction. There are a
variety of phone recycling businesses. Collective Good at www.collective
good.com is a good example.
Choosing the Right Plan
When you visit wireless carrier retail stores or their Web sites or peruse their
brochures, you invariably run across this term: The Plan.
The Plan is a common term for the contract that describes which services
you’re signing up for, specifies how much it costs to use them, and spells out
the terms and conditions you must abide by. The two types of plans are
described in the following sections.
Prepaid
In a prepaid plan, you pay upfront to use your mobile phone. Increasingly, the
prepaid plan is often associated with mobile phones bought from vending
machines, drugstores, and similar outlets, but you can buy and use a mobile
phone with a prepaid plan almost anywhere, including from most wireless
carriers’ retail stores.
The idea is simple: Buy a phone and apply some credit to the account, 
and then, as you use the phone, the cost for its use is deducted from your
credit. After you use up your credit, you can’t use the phone until you 
“top up” (add credit to) your account. You can pay for more credit over the
Internet or at a wireless carrier’s kiosk or retail store — very similar to a 
prepaid calling card.
If you want more from your phone than just voice services — making and
receiving phone calls — don’t choose a prepaid plan. You may find one that
lets you send and receive text messages, but prepaid plans rarely let you
access the mobile Web or use any other data services (picture messaging or
Internet-enabled applications, for example).
65
Chapter 5: Wireless Carriers and Service Plans

Postpaid
A postpaid plan (also known as a contract) is an agreement between you and
your wireless carrier that stipulates all rules and regulations regarding your
use of the phone and the wireless carrier’s services — and, most importantly,
your monthly payment.
Most wireless carriers require you to sign a multiyear contract (two years is
standard). Within this contract, you select the services you want on your
plan and commit to paying the wireless carrier a specific amount of money
each month. In return, the carrier lets you use your mobile phone and the
services you selected and agreed to pay for, such as voice, text messaging,
mobile Web, games, navigation, e-mail, and more. Any use over the amount
specified in the plan is added to your bill at the end of the month, just like
your account with an old-fashioned wired phone. If you’re interested in 
getting access to mobile Internet products and services, this is the type of
plan you want.
Choosing a Billing Model
Wireless carriers offer all kinds of billing models, which consist of bundled
services and options. This list shows just some of the types of plans you
commonly see:
 Voice minute only
 Text messaging
 Family
 Unlimited
 Premium
 Data only
 Specific applications and services
 PDA and smartphone
 Blackberry
 Pay-as-you-go
Wireless carriers commonly bundle, or package, their services based on 
the type of mobile phone you have. See Chapter 4 if you’re still choosing a
phone model.
Sifting through all the plans can be quite confusing!
66
Part II: Mobile Internet, Here It Is — Now What?! 

Don’t forget to ask about current promotions or even try to negotiate your
own deal.
A billing model refers to how the wireless carrier accounts for your use of its
services and how it charges you for that use. In this section, we describe the
four billing models — pay as you go, metered services, metered package, 
and unlimited — that most carriers typically offer.
Each wireless carrier may have a different name for its version of a particular
billing model. Even if different wireless carriers use the same name for a plan
or service option, it doesn’t mean that their plans or service options are the
same. Read the fine print on the plan you sign up for. Not all plans are equal,
even if they’re referred to by the same name. An unlimited plan from one car-
rier may not include the same services as an unlimited plan offered by
another carrier. And the plan might not even be unlimited.
Pay-as-you-go
In the pay-as-you-go billing model, you’re charged incrementally as you use 
a service, similar to ordering a la carte in a restaurant. The service charge
shows up on your monthly statement.
For instance, in this billing model, you’re charged for each individual text
message you send or receive, for each picture message you send or receive,
for each kilobyte (or megabyte) of data you download and receive to your
phone, and for every piece of mobile content you purchase.
Depending on the specific mobile service you’re using, the pay-as-you-go
model can get extremely expensive. If you plan to use your phone for 
text messaging or extensive Internet surfing, we don’t recommend this 
billing model.
Metered services
In the metered services billing model, you subscribe to individual services
separately and commit to a minimum monthly payment. For example, you
may subscribe to a text-messaging option, a picture-messaging option, a full-
suite mobile Internet option, or some other configuration and then commit 
to paying an additional $3, $5, $10, or more per month (whether or not you
even use the service).
For each service option you select, you receive an allotted amount of use
before you’re charged under the pay-as-you-go model. For example, you 
may choose the option to use 500 text messages per month and then get
charged at the pay-as-you-go rate for any additional text messages you 
send in the month.
67
Chapter 5: Wireless Carriers and Service Plans

Metered package
In the metered package plan, billing model services are grouped in a package.
For a single price, you receive a package, or bundle, of services.
For example, your package may include an allotment of voice minutes and
voice services; an allotment of text messages, pictures messages, and mobile
Internet data use; then, when you reach the allotment threshold for each 
service in the package, you’re charged at the pay-as-you-go rate.
Unlimited
The unlimited billing model refers to just what you might expect: For a single
fee, you can use as much of a particular service or package of services as you
want. You can make and receive as many calls as you want, send and receive
as many text messages as you want, access the mobile Internet products and
services as much as you want, and more.
Check the fine print to make sure that you’re truly getting unlimited use.
Some wireless carriers may refer to a plan as unlimited when it may not be.
Rather than unlimited, the threshold on a service is simply set “very high.”
Moreover, as in the metered package billing model, check exactly which ser-
vices are included in the unlimited billing model. Some wireless carriers offer
unlimited voice calls but charge you for data services; whereas others have
unlimited programs that include voice, text messaging, picture messaging,
and mobile Internet, but not other services.
Adding Options to Your Billing Model
After you have your plan and a billing model in place, you may want to add 
or remove some optional add-ons.
Voice options
When selecting your voice options, first decide how many minutes you plan
to use in any given month — and then choose a billing model that fits.
For example, in a metered services billing model, you can choose a plan that
includes 500, 750, 1,000, 1,500, or even more minutes of talk time in a given
month. Figure out how many minutes you plan to use, and then choose a plan
that’s slightly above your expected use, to ensure that you don’t exceed your
plan minutes.
68
Part II: Mobile Internet, Here It Is — Now What?! 

Also consider adding services such as voice mail, call waiting, free nights 
and weekends, or anytime minutes. Most wireless carriers include one or
more of these features or options in your plan, but check with your wireless
carrier about the availability and cost, if any, of these and other voice-service
features.
Be careful choosing voice options and monitor how many minutes you use 
in a given month. If you exceed your allocated contract minutes in any given
month, you can face some hefty overage fees. Be sure to ask your wireless
carrier what its overage charges are. Also ask whether it supports rollover
minutes, which transfer unused minutes from one month to the next month
or future months. Finally, see whether you face additional charges for 
long-distance or international calls.
Wireless data services options
You can choose among, and access from your mobile phone, many different
wireless data services and options. This list describes some of the more
common mobile Internet options:
 Text messaging: Text messaging service, commonly referred to as SMS
(Short Message Service), lets you send and receive alphanumeric mes-
sages on your phone. Pay-as-you go text messaging can be quite expen-
sive. For example, in the United States, a single text message sent or
received when not under a metered services or unlimited plan can cost
between 15 cents and 25 cents per message — or more. If you plan to
use text messaging, make sure to select a metered text messaging ser-
vice option or bundled billing model.
The break-even threshold between the typical unlimited and the pay-as-
you go billing models for text messaging can be as low as 28 messages
per month. That number is next to nothing if you have a teenager 
sending 400 to 600 messages per month.
 Picture messaging: Picture messaging (often referred to as MMS or
Multimedia Messaging Service) is used for exchanging pictures, videos,
and related content by using your phone. As with text messaging, pay-
as-you go picture messaging can be expensive. For example, in the
United States, a single picture message sent or received when not under
a service or bundled billing model can cost between 25 cents and 50
cents message, or more. So, if you’re going to use picture messaging,
make sure to select a picture messaging service or a metered package in
the text messaging billing model.
 E-mail: E-mail is becoming an increasingly popular data service and is
used for both personal and company e-mail. Wireless carriers tend to
sell the e-mail option in a metered bundle or unlimited billing model,
especially for the BlackBerry, smartphones, and PDA phones.
69
Chapter 5: Wireless Carriers and Service Plans

 Mobile Web: The mobile Web option lets you access the Internet by
using a mobile browser on your phone and usually supports your use of
mobile Web applications, such as instant messaging, maps, e-mail, and
related applications. In the United States, accessing the mobile Web
under a pay-as-you go billing model costs between 99 cents and $1.99
per megabyte. To put this cost in perspective, viewing a single mobile
Web page can cost 12 cents a page; downloading a ringtone can cost 50
cents or more on top of the price of the ringtone; and downloading a full-
length music track or large video file can cost as much as $2 or more. So,
if you want to surf the mobile Web and download content to your mobile
phone with any regularity, buy a metered package, or truly unlimited
service plan.
 On-device data-enabled applications: This generic term refers to the
use of applications that are downloaded to your mobile phone, such as
maps and navigation applications (for example, Google Maps or Verizon
Wireless Navigator), or other applications that leverage wireless data
connectivity to exchange application specific data to and from your
phone. As for the cost of a model for on-device data-enabled applica-
tions, we highly recommend that you buy at least a metered package or
an unlimited plan for the best cost savings.

N
ow available on all mobile phones, text messaging — technically, it’s
Short Message Service (SMS) — represents the mobile Internet at its
most basic level: simple, plain alphanumeric text on your mobile phone’s
screen, usually limited to 160 characters including spaces, per message.
Text messaging is useful for sending short, quick messages to friends, family
members, and business associates. You can also use it, for example, to receive
simple information alerts, vote on TV shows, or request that information
(such as sports scores, weather, and news) be sent to your phone. It works
around the world for anyone to send a text message to anyone else who has a
mobile phone on any wireless carrier network.
Picture messaging, also known as Multimedia Messaging Service (MMS),
which we explain near the end of this chapter, is only a bit more advanced
than text messaging: You can take a picture with your mobile phone’s
camera, if it has one, and send the photo to another person who has a mobile
phone that can accept picture messaging services. Picture messaging isn’t
available on all mobile phones and networks (check with your wireless 
carrier for more details) and usually requires the recipient of the picture 
to be on the same wireless carrier network. You can also send and receive
pictures from standard Internet services.
This chapter is your introduction to both text and picture messaging. Find
out the basics and look at ways to take these services a step further, by 
sending messages from your computer to someone’s phone or exploring
news services that are updated by way of SMS.

Service fees for text and picture messaging vary by wireless carrier as well as
for the messages sent to people on other wireless carriers. Typically, you can
pay a flat rate for text messaging. If you don’t subscribe to the flat rate, the
charges for messages are based on each message you send and receive, rang-
ing from 5 to 25 cents per message. Check your wireless carrier’s rate plan for
more details.
Typing on the Keypad
Before you can take advantage of all the excellent mobile Internet services
available on your mobile phone, you need to understand the basic concept 
of using a mobile phone keypad and how to write words, numbers, and 
punctuation. This understanding is especially important if you don’t have 
a QWERTY keypad on your mobile phone, like the one on your computer 
keyboard. If you have a smartphone or PDA, typing is as simple as typing on
your computer, except that the keyboard is a little smaller.
If you don’t have a computer-like keyboard on your mobile phone, you use
the alphanumeric keypad, such as the one shown in Figure 6-1, to enter let-
ters, numbers, and punctuation marks (or any other characters and symbols
when “writing” on a mobile phone).

Chapter 6: Trading Text and Picture Messages

Mobile phones now have options for predictive text, which attempts to help
you by guessing which word you’re trying to type as you type it. The avail-
ability of this feature varies by mobile device, vendor, and model. The most
common predictive text systems on mobile phones are T9 from Nuance
(www.t9.com), eZiText from Zi Corporation (www.zicorp.com/ezitext.
htm), and iTap from Motorola. Also, you can disable the predictive text fea-
ture if you prefer to “multi-tap” or manually enter the words you want by 
tapping each key to get the character you want. Look at your mobile device’s
manual or check with your wireless carrier to see whether your phone has
this feature and to find out how to turn it on or off.
76
Part III: Mobile Internet Mania for the Everyday Consumer 
A short history of text messaging
One of the first wireless text-messaging services
sent messages from paging companies to
alphanumeric pagers. Motorola, a dominant
player in the paging industry, developed tech-
nology that consumers, dispatchers, and com-
puters could use to send text messages over its
paging networks. But you could send only 80
characters or so at a time, and a message was
sent from the paging network only once —
regardless of whether the pager was turned on
or in coverage range. You could send text mes-
sages to pagers in all kinds of ways: Call a dis-
patcher with your message so that he could type
it into a paging-specific keyboard connected by
dialup to the paging network; buy a software
package made specifically for alphanumeric
paging; or (after the Internet became commonly
accessible) visit a Web site to send a page.
Companies then began giving pagers Internet
e-mail addresses to receive e-mail messages
and notifications.
Next came two-way paging. Services were
available on a number of wireless data networks
in North America, from paging networks to wire-
less-packet data networks. The North American
birth of two-way text messaging hit the market in
the late 1990s. Few people now remember that
one of the first products for wireless e-mail from
Research In Motion (way before it created the
BlackBerry) was the RIM Inter@ctive Pager,
which worked on the ARDIS and Mobitex wire-
less-data-only networks.
Meanwhile, over in Europe, a Finnish civil ser-
vant named Matti Makkonen invented Short
Message Service (SMS) capabilities between
mobile phones and wireless carrier networks
using Short Message Service Center, or SMSC.
The main purpose of this technology and service,
developed in the early 1980s, was to automati-
cally send customer-care alerts and service noti-
fications directly to consumers’ mobile phones
without the wireless carriers having to call them
all individually. Then, about a decade later (in
1992), Makkonen’s initial research led to one 
of the first consumer uses of text messaging 
on a mobile phone. A telecommunications indus-
try engineer in the UK named Neil Papworth 
sent one of the first person-to-person mobile
phone messages to one of his associates at
Vodafone, to wish him “Merry Christmas.” From
that special greeting, today’s mobile phone text-
messaging industry was born.
The text messaging industry took off in Europe in
the late 1990s, and early in this century in North
America, when wireless carriers agreed to allow
messages to go from one network to another.
Just as voice calls cross networks and countries
in milliseconds, text messaging services now do
the same.

Starting Out with the Messaging Menu
To start text messaging, almost every phone model has a messaging area
where you can access your carrier’s text messaging services. The following
steps work for almost any mobile phone model:
1. Press the Menu key on your mobile device and select Messaging.
2. In the Messaging area, create, send, receive, view, edit, or organize 
a text message, a picture message, an e-mail message, or another 
messaging service.
Specifically, you can see the New Message function and a list of folders.
Here are some folders that might be available on your mobile phone:
• Inbox: Contains text messages you received
• Messaging: Organizes your messages, if you want
• Drafts: Keeps draft copies of messages that have not been sent
• Sent: Keeps 10 to 20 of the most recent messages you sent from
your mobile phone
• Outbox: Temporarily stores messages waiting to be sent
You find out more about picture messaging later in this chapter, and e-mail
messaging is covered in Chapter 10.
To best manage and access your mobile phone’s text messaging services,
check the manual that came with your phone. If you can’t find the manual,
simply go to the Web site of your wireless carrier or mobile phone manufac-
turer to see whether it’s available.
Sending Text Messages
Text messaging is one of the simplest, most commonly used mobile Internet
services in the world. Billions (yes, billions) of text messages are now being
sent daily between friends, family members, and business associates. The
cool thing about text messaging is that it takes only three to ten seconds to
send your message, after you press the Send key on your mobile phone (or
computer), to your friend’s mobile phone over any wireless carrier network,
almost anywhere in the world.
Some people would rather text message each other than talk via mobile
phone, and most of the time it’s a lot cheaper than talking on a mobile phone.
Text messaging eliminates long distance bills and billing per second — 
just get your message across in fewer than 160 characters and you’re on 
your way.
77
Chapter 6: Trading Text and Picture Messages

You can send person-to-person text messages in three ways:
 From a mobile phone
 From a Web browser with an Internet connection
 From an e-mail program to a mobile phone
Each method has its own way of working and provides unique benefits for
users. The following sections explain how each one works.
To make use of text messaging services, you can:
 Send messages to the mobile numbers of people you know.
 Subscribe to a specific service, such as news headlines, sports scores,
or weather forecasts from your wireless carrier’s Web site.
 Send keywords to a text messaging short code to receive the result you
want (and, in some cases, pay for). Text messaging should work from all
mobile phones, whether or not they have Internet features.
Texting from your mobile phone
Sending text messages from a mobile phone is the most common way that
people trade messages. Follow these steps:
1. Select the envelope icon on your mobile phone’s main screen, or
select Text Messaging or SMS from the menu.
2. Select New Message.
A list of message options opens.
3. Select Text Message to send a text message.
4. Press the Select key to choose a recipient or group from your Contacts
list, or enter the recipient’s mobile phone number or e-mail address.
Press the * key to add a semicolon (;), which separates recipient names.
You can also copy and paste the number or address from the clipboard.
5. Press the down directional key to move to the message field.
6. Write a message using the mobile phone keypad.
See the section “Typing on the Keypad,” earlier in this chapter, for tips.
7. To send the message, choose Options➪Send or press the Send key.
A message appears on-screen confirming that the message was sent.
78
Part III: Mobile Internet Mania for the Everyday Consumer 

Your mobile phone can send messages that are longer than 160 characters —
they’re just sent as a series of two or more messages. Before sending any text
messages, long or short, check on the price, because wireless carriers tend
to charge for all outbound messages. Most carriers have monthly bundles of
100 or more messages that are much cheaper than paying per message.
Text messaging is quite cool, and it’s almost as good as the U.S. Postal
Service. If your friend has turned off her mobile phone or it’s out of the cover-
age area when you send your text message, the message you sent stays avail-
able in the wireless carrier’s network for a day or two. The carrier continues
trying to send the message until the mobile phone is turned back on or
returns to wireless network coverage.
Texting from the Web
Sending text messages from a wireless carrier’s Web site is also an option to
get your message out to a mobile phone user. When you don’t have a mobile
phone or you’re on your computer already and just want to get a quick note
out, the Web site is the way to go. Here’s how to do it from the Web:
1. Go to your friend’s wireless carrier’s Web site from your home,
school, or office computer.
To use most Web-to-mobile text messaging services, you need to know
which wireless carrier your friend uses. 
2. Look for the Messaging (or Text Messaging or Send a Text) page on the
wireless carrier’s Web site.
An example from T-Mobile is shown in Figure 6-2.
3. Enter the person’s mobile phone number, enter your 160 alphanu-
meric character message, enter your name and contact details as
requested, and then click Send.
You need to know the exact mobile phone number of the person you
want to send your text message to. (You usually need all ten phone
number digits; for example, 212-555-1234.)
If you did everything correctly, you see a confirmation screen showing
that your text message was sent to the mobile phone number you
entered. It usually takes less than 30 seconds, on a good day, to reach
your friend’s mobile phone.
Service fees for the text messages you send through the Web may be charged
to the recipient based on their wireless carrier subscription plan. Check 
with your friends and associates to find out whether they have to pay for
messages before sending them messages.
79
Chapter 6: Trading Text and Picture Messages

Texting in an e-mail
Text messaging by e-mail is extremely simple. If you know how to send e-mail
from your computer or smartphone, you can send a text message. Sending
text messages by e-mail lets you keep your friends’ addresses in your mail
program’s address book and allows you to keep a copy of the message you
sent right on your computer.
1. Open your e-mail program on your computer or smartphone.
2. Enter the recipient’s ten-digit phone number and that person’s 
wireless carrier text-messaging e-mail domain address; for example:
21255512324@wirelesscarrier.net
Don’t send long e-mail messages and attachments. Almost all mobile
phones can handle only 160 characters of text at a time, and no attach-
ments are sent. If your mail program automatically adds a signature,
delete the signature because it probably uses 160 characters all by itself.
3. Send your e-mail message as you would send any e-mail.
The message is directed to your friend’s mobile phone rather than to his
e-mail inbox.
To make this service work, you need to know which wireless carriers your
family members, friends, and associates are on as well as the wireless carri-
ers’ e-mail-to-text-messaging addresses. This list shows you some examples
of e-mail addresses at the major wireless carriers:
Figure 6-2:

Part III: Mobile Internet Mania for the Everyday Consumer 

 AT&T/Cingular: 2125551234@txt.att.net
 Sprint: 2125551234@messaging.sprintpcs.com
 T-Mobile: 2125551234@tmomail.net
 Verizon: 2125551234@vtext.com
(Change the ten-digit part — 2125551234 — to your friend’s mobile phone
number or try your own number first to make sure that you know which kind
of message is being sent.)
To find out the text messaging address for any wireless carrier that isn’t
listed, just give them a call, ask your friend, or check the Web site.
Some wireless carrier services, such as AT&T, also let you send text mes-
sages to e-mail addresses. You enter an e-mail address rather than the phone
number of the target recipient in the Text Messaging address field. Check
with your wireless carrier to make sure that this option is available on your
mobile phone before trying it, and find out whether you pay any additional
costs to use this service.
Text Messaging Meets the Internet
You probably have been using text messaging already because it’s now one 
of the most often used mobile Internet services in the world. Text messaging
as a mobile Internet service uses elements of Internet content to get more
from your mobile phone than most people think possible. And, it’s a useful
stepping stone to the next generation of services being created for your
mobile Internet lifestyle.
Text messaging lets you not only send short notes to your friends but also
receive information alerts or request bits of information from a company or
organization, sports club, TV show, magazine, billboard, or real estate sign.
Text messaging services are starting to do more than just send messages
between friends. Brands, publishers, broadcasters, radio stations, and
Internet content sites are opening their doors for people to interact with
them by using text messaging services to find information, vote, “clip” 
virtual coupons, discover products, and more.
Regardless of whether you have used your mobile phone to vote for the 
next American Idol or to subscribe to news, weather, and sports content from
your wireless carrier, thousands of text messaging services are available 
now in the mobile Internet world. Almost any type of digital text content is
available to be sent to your mobile phone. The following sections introduce
short codes, which are codes you type in order to use these services or get
information on your phone.
81
Chapter 6: Trading Text and Picture Messages

Understanding short codes
A text messaging, or SMS, short code is a four- to six-digit number that lets
you use your mobile phone’s text messaging capabilities to send requests 
for on-demand digital information or services and receive specific informa-
tion services on your phone. A short code (it’s shorter than a telephone
number — thus the name) is used just as you would use a friend’s mobile
telephone number to send a text message; rather than go to a live person,
however, the message goes to a computer network with software on it to
send your message to companies providing digital information, products, 
and services.
Additionally, the text message content you send by short code from your
mobile phone is commonly called a keyword — a phrase that means some-
thing to the computers at the end of the short code you’re sending it to. A
keyword sent to a short code acts as your personal request for information,
allowing the service you want (your horoscope, for example) to be sent to
your mobile phone. To receive today’s Leo horoscope, for example, you send
the text message Leo to the short-code number provided by your favorite
newspaper or wireless carrier.
Your wireless carrier could add extra text messaging charges if you use short
codes (both sending and receiving) and keywords to request information,
products, and services. If short codes and keyword-based, on-demand ser-
vices are offered by your wireless carrier, the charges usually range from 
25 cents to 50 cents — and even as much as $5 for each keyword offering;
sometimes, however, you incur no extra charges. When extra fees are billed
above your normal text messaging charges by wireless carriers, they’re
called premium rate short-code services.
Check with your wireless carrier’s customer service people or look for a
Messaging or Text Messaging Services link on its Web site for any additional
service fee costs. If the text messaging short-code service is offered by some-
one other than your wireless carrier, make sure that you understand all
potential charges and premium-rate, short-code rules for that service request
before you send any text message keywords to any short codes published 
by any third parties.
The United States and Canada have two governing short-code organizations
administrating and monitoring all text messaging short-code programs 
available. These nonprofit industry bodies work with the wireless carriers
along with the media, brands, and marketers using short-code programs. 
The U.S. organization is the CTIA–The Wireless Association, managed under
its Common Short Code Administration (CSCA) services at www.usshort
codes.com. It’s managed in Canada by the Canadian Wireless Telecommuni-
cations Association (CWTA) at www.txt.ca. We highly recommend that 
you visit both Web sites to find out more about short-code rules, regulations,
and services before using any text messaging short-code services.

Sending news, alerts, and other types 
of information to your phone
Now that you know (or even if you don’t know) how to send and receive per-
sonal text messages, find out which other mobile Internet services are avail-
able to your wireless device of choice. Thousands of text messaging services
are available for your mobile phone. You can have news updates, sports
scores, stocks quotes, weather alerts, and even birthday reminders sent
directly to your phone whenever you need or want them.
You can use one of two methods to have Internet content sent directly to
your phone by way of text messaging:
 From your wireless carrier of choice: AT&T, Alltel, Sprint, T-Mobile,
Verizon Wireless, and all the other wireless carriers in North America
offer information services for your mobile phone. Virtually all wireless
carriers offer a suite of text messaging information alerts and on-demand
services. Basic categories include news, weather, stocks, horoscopes,
traffic, entertainment, jokes, trivia, reminders, lottery results, and much,
much more. (You can even have pickup lines sent to your mobile phone.) 
Figure 6-3 shows an example of the mobile Internet text-messaging 
services available on Alltel Wireless, from its Axcess service offerings.
 From news and information providers: Some examples are the Dallas
Morning News, Google, WeatherBug, and Major League Baseball.
Figure 6-4 shows an example of mobile Internet text-messaging services
available from the Dallas Morning News.

Chapter 6: Trading Text and Picture Messages

Almost any traditional news and information publisher now has mobile
Internet offerings available in text messaging format. Many don’t charge
any extra for these services; some charge a premium (anywhere from a
dime to a couple of bucks); some base their fees on whether you’re 
a member of their subscription services; and some are on demand, 
delivered directly to your mobile phone whenever you want.
Some short-code services charge extra fees for the information they send 
to your mobile phone using short codes. According to the CTIA, the CWTA,
and the Mobile Marketing Association (www.mmaglobal.com), any charges
for text messaging services must be highly visible to you in an obvious dis-
claimer of some sort, such as “Standard text messaging rates apply.” Check
out our short-code primer in the preceding section and read the fine print
before heading out into any uncharted text messaging waters.
Exchanging Picture Messages
Picture messaging’s technical name is Multimedia Message Service, or MMS.
This enhancement over text messaging (SMS) lets you create, develop, and
send digital animations, images, sounds, and videos from your mobile phone
to other mobile phones or computers.

Part III: Mobile Internet Mania for the Everyday Consumer 

Not all mobile phones and wireless carriers offer picture messaging, though
it’s a fun way to use your mobile phone’s camera to share your creativity with
your friends from anywhere you are to anywhere they are. As fun and enjoy-
able as picture messaging is, each recipient must have a picture-messaging
mobile phone for it to work and usually needs to be on the same wireless 
carrier as you are. If in doubt, find out whether your friends and family have
picture messaging–enabled phones and services before sending any shots 
to them.
Here are some ideas for what you can do with picture messaging services:
 Take full-color digital pictures with your mobile phone and store them
on your phone or computer.
 Send and receive full-color digital pictures from your mobile phone and
become a mobile newsroom reporter for your local TV station or
Internet blog.
 Send and receive digital voice and sound recordings from your mobile
phone.
 Create new digital pictures, images, and sound effects right on your
mobile phone — great for new ringtones and other mobile phone fun.
Sending picture messages from a mobile phone is very similar to sending text
messages. Here’s how to do it:
1. Select the envelope icon on your mobile phone’s main screen or select
Picture Messaging or MMS from the menu.
2. Select New Message.
A list of message options opens.
3. Select MMS to send a picture message.
4. Press the Select key to choose a recipient or group from your Contacts
list, or enter the recipient’s mobile phone number or e-mail address.
Press the * key to add a semicolon (;), which separates recipient names.
You can also copy and paste the number or address from the Clipboard.
5. Press the downward directional key to move to the message field.
6. Write a message using the mobile phone keypad.
See the section “Typing on the Keypad,” earlier in this chapter, for
details.
7. (Optional) Press the Menu key and select Add Picture to find the 
picture you want to send from your mobile phone’s memory.
85
Chapter 6: Trading Text and Picture Messages

8. (Optional) Scroll through the pictures and images in your mobile
phone’s memory files, highlight the picture you want to send, and
select it to add it to the message.
9. To send the message, choose Options➪Send or press the Send key.
A message appears on-screen confirming that the message was sent.
You must subscribe to picture messaging at your wireless carrier, and addi-
tional network service fees can apply to every use of the service. Not all 
wireless carriers and mobile phones have picture messaging capabilities.
Also, most built-in mobile phone cameras have poor-quality image resolution
(less than two or three megapixels). These phone cameras are suitable for
taking quick shots, but are no replacement for a good digital camera if picture
quality is a concern.

Browsing the Web from 
the Palm of Your Hand
In This Chapter
 Avoiding the high cost of mobile browsing
 Browsing on-portal from your wireless carrier’s mobile Internet site
 Browsing off-portal on the Web
T
he mobile Internet is a new frontier with an abundance of made-for-mobile
Internet sites from all over the world being published daily. As on the
Internet, the amount of available information and services is more than one
company or wireless carrier (or book) can catalog and provide over one
simple Web browser portal.
Wireless carriers understand that in order for you to take full advantage 
of all that the mobile Internet has to offer, you’re best served with a basic 
on-portal, or on-deck (received from your provider by using your mobile
phone), suite of sites and services while providing you with open access 
to the millions of off-portal, or off-deck (outside your provider’s suite of 
services), mobile Internet sites published by individuals and companies
worldwide.
In this chapter, you find out the benefits of both on-portal and off-portal 
sites and services and how you can use them to find news, travel informa-
tion, fun things to do, and more. You also find out some basic information
about personalizing your browser so that you can quickly find sites that you
use often. Before you start surfing, though, you should know that you can
rack up fees quickly from surfing the mobile Internet if you’re aren’t sure 
how you’re charged for a service, so we start with some basics to help you
avoid surprises on your next bill.

Controlling Your Mobile 
Browsing Expenses
Before you start browsing on your mobile phone, you must realize that get-
ting on the mobile Internet for almost any made-for-mobile service isn’t like
getting on your computer Internet in any way, shape, or form — especially
when it comes to service costs.
One big problem in serving up the mobile Internet experience to your phone
is the potential cost associated with the freedom it provides. Many people
are unaware of these costs now — until they get their first (and sometimes
last) wireless carrier bill. Only after they start checking out all the fantastic
mobile Internet products and services available to them do they realize that
the system resembles pay-per-view more than all-you-can-eat, for almost 
anything on the mobile Internet. We don’t want this to happen to you.
Wireless data transfer for mobile Web browsing services is charged by the
amount of data sent and received, not for time spent on the network, as is
true with voice calls.
The mobile Internet can now cost you an arm and a leg if you don’t pay atten-
tion. This isn’t the all-you-can-eat dialup plan or the broadband Internet that
you use on your computer. However, if you have the right wireless carrier
flat-rate data plan in place, it can come quite close.
If you’re going to go mobile browsing with a computer Internet appetite, sign
up for the best flat-rate wireless data plan or package you can get before you
go any further. Understand the fine print limitations or restrictions. (This tip
alone can save you the price of this book.) Turn to Chapter 5 to find out what
kind of plans most carriers offer. Chapter 5 also offers tip on how to change
carriers if you need to — you can now even keep your phone number thanks
to local number portability, so don’t hesitate to change carriers if you find a
better deal elsewhere.
Browsing On-Portal: Your Carrier’s 
Made-for-Mobile Offerings
All wireless carriers have robust made-for-mobile portals with a rich array of
products and services available for you to enjoy. The sites you can browse
from those portals are considered on-portal.
88
Part III: Mobile Internet Mania for the Everyday Consumer 

One of the safest, least expensive ways to surf from your mobile phone is 
to take advantage of what has already been done for you by your wireless
carrier.
AT&T Mobility (formerly Cingular), Alltel Wireless, Sprint, T-Mobile, Verizon
Wireless, and almost all wireless carriers have created mobile Web browsing
services that are available to their subscribers, with some of the basic
Internet-like services at no additional charge — other than your basic wire-
less carrier data-connection plan. If you want enhanced mobile Internet 
products and services, you usually have to either download your purchase 
or subscribe for incremental fees directly from your phone.
The following sections explore some basic information about surfing on-
portal that applies to almost any carrier’s portal. Before you start surfing,
though, check with your wireless carrier to see which types of mobile 
browsing services are included and which ones cost extra.
Finding out what’s on-portal
One main advantage of using your wireless carrier’s on-portal service 
isn’t only that you can surf but also that you have access to almost all the
services we describe throughout this book. From your mobile phone’s 
on-portal Internet access, you can
 Find information about news, weather, sports, finance, travel, and 
entertainment. (See the appropriate sections later in this chapter.)
 Buy ringtones, wallpapers, videos, music, and games.
 Access mobile e-mail, instant messaging (see Chapter 10) and blogging
services. (See Chapter 14.)
 Check out the made-for-mobile services from your favorite brand-name
Internet and media publishers, such as Facebook, MySpace, Yahoo!,
ESPN, Disney, and others. (See Chapter 14.)
 Watch and listen to mobile TV, music, and radio. (See Chapter 14.)
 Search to find information, locations, and directions. (See Chapter 8.)
 Surf to other mobile Internet sites not offered by your wireless carrier.
(See the section “Browsing Off-Portal: The Web at Large,” later in this
chapter.)
 Access wireless-carrier customer service to check your account status
and upgrade services.
89
Chapter 7: Browsing the Web from the Palm of Your Hand

To become better acquainted with your wireless carrier’s on-portal offerings,
go to its Web site the old-fashioned way, by using your computer browser, 
to review what the site has in store for you. Table 7-1 lists the URLs (Web
addresses) of the most common wireless carrier’s mobile Internet sites so
that you can find information to get started.

If your wireless carrier isn’t listed here, don’t worry: There are more than 
50 of them in the United States alone. To find out more about your specific
wireless carrier’s offerings if they aren’t listed in that chapter, go to the 
carrier’s Web site, using your computer, and look for a link labeled Internet,
mobile Internet, Web, Mobile Web, Wireless Web, or Browsing. If you cannot
find it on the Web site, go to your local retailer or call the customer service
line to have information mailed (or e-mailed) to you. Always check to see
what your carrier has in store for you, by visiting its Internet site before you
launch your mobile browser, so that you don’t waste your precious time 
and money.
Knowing what your phone can do
The mobile browsing products and services made available by your wireless
carrier are highly dependent on the type of mobile phone, smartphone, or
PDA you’re using on its network. Mobile browsing has matured to the point
that the network knows which type of mobile device you’re using to surf, and
presents only products and services tested to work on your phone. Here are
a couple of examples:
 You’re using Sprint PCS and just bought a brand-new mobile phone.
You probably have access to the Sprint Power Vision network of 
services — mobile Web browsing, mobile video with Sprint TV, audio
FanScan in-car audio from NASCAR drivers, Sirius Radio audio 
streaming, and much more.
90
Part III: Mobile Internet Mania for the Everyday Consumer 

 You bought your mobile phone before VoiceStream became T-Mobile.
Your T-Zone mobile Web offerings may be limited to services available
for older mobile phone browsers with basic news, information, ring-
tones, wallpapers, and customer care services.
If a made-for-mobile product or service cannot function well or work on your
device, the wireless carrier will not display it in your browser or provide you
with access to it so that you don’t have a poor user experience (or waste
your time and money).
In addition to your phone model, the type of mobile Internet services pack-
age you’re subscribed to and which type of network service (2G, 2.5G, or 3G)
is available in your coverage area influence the services you see on-portal.
Making the portal your own
When looking at your wireless carrier’s mobile browsing services, keep an
eye out for its personalization capabilities, if they’re offered. Mobile browsing
personalization saves you from spending a lot of time navigating all that your
wireless carrier has to offer.
Your wireless carrier has useful ways for you to manage which content you
want to see and access on your mobile phone. We recommend that you ask
which mobile Web personalization services it has, in order to improve your
browsing experience. As we mention earlier in this chapter, mobile browsing
doesn’t work the same way as Internet browsing, so you don’t want every-
thing available on your mobile phone. You just want access to the products
and services that make your mobile Internet experience rewarding and 
entertaining — and for the lowest possible price.
For example, the AT&T MyMEdia personalization service is feature-rich. 
You can create a home page of your favorite content to track news, local
weather forecasts, sports scores, or whatever you use most often. You 
can also set parental controls for individual phones, if you’re setting up a
phone for a child. (See Chapter 3 for more about setting up the mobile
Internet for your kids.)
Browsing your portal
Suppose that you have a fairly new mobile phone, you have the appropriate
wireless data plan to suit your personal needs, and you’re in an area with 
3G wireless data coverage. Take a look at what your wireless carrier has 
to offer.

Chapter 7: Browsing the Web from the Palm of Your Hand

1. To get on-portal, open the mobile browser on your phone.
This step opens your wireless carrier’s mobile Web site and service
offerings.
The browser is normally available on the main menu of your mobile
phone or by clicking a Web-like icon on its display. Opening the mobile
browser opens your wireless carrier’s on-portal home page, outlining all
mobile Internet services available to you. You don’t have to enter a URL
(Web address) to get to the on-portal portal. It really is that easy!
Figure 7-1 shows you the Sprint PCS Power Vision network home page.
2. After you reach your wireless carrier’s home page, you can link to any
service you want.
Because hundreds of wireless carriers are in the United States, review
your carrier’s home page on your own. Check to see what’s included or
compare what you see on your handset to what’s posted and available
on the computer Web site or in the retail brochure.
3. After you see what’s available on-portal for your wireless carrier,
make sure that you understand which services are included with your
mobile Internet service subscription and which ones cost extra.
See the earlier section “Browsing On-Portal: Your Carrier’s Made-for-
Mobile Offerings,” for tips on keeping your browsing bill under control.
For a more detailed overview of what’s available to entertain you from
the wireless carriers, Chapter 9 has examples of mobile Internet ser-
vices. Most of the value-added services from your wireless carrier’s on-
portal offering require an additional subscription or a pay-per-use fee on
top of your mobile Internet access fees. Check with your wireless carrier
to clarify what these additional costs are and how they’ll be added to
your bill.

Browsing Off-Portal: The Web at Large
When you go off-portal to browse the Web from your mobile phone, the
browsing experience is different from browsing the Web on your computer 
or from the on-portal offerings that your service provider has tested for 
you. In this section, you find out which special issues you need to consider
and how to identify sites that work so that you don’t waste your time 
or money.
Testing sites for mobile readiness
Before jumping into the off-portal mobile browsing waters with both feet, 
we encourage you to check whether a site you want to visit on your mobile
phone is mobile ready. Follow these steps:
1. On your computer, go to the free Ready.mobi site at http://
ready.mobi.
In this test, you find out how well the computer Internet BusinessWeek
Web site (www.businessweek.com) is made for mobile Web browsing.
Then you find out how much it would cost to download just one page of
the Web site to a mobile phone (assuming that you’re paying by the kilo-
byte because you don’t have a flat-rate, all-you-can-eat mobile Internet
plan in place).
2. After the page opens, enter the URL of one of your favorite Web sites
and click Go.
For this test, enter www.businessweek.com in the Ready.mobi Page
Check box and click the Go button (see Figure 7-2).
3. Check the site’s rating from 1 to 5 (bad to good).
The rate is based on the Web site’s made-for-mobile readiness and
MobileOK test guidelines published by the World Wide Web Consortium
(W3C) at www.w3.org/TR/mobileOK-basic10-tests.
The BusinessWeek.com site scored 1 out of 5, as shown in Figure 7-3 —
not a good sign if you’re using your mobile browser. Just the
BusinessWeek.com made-for-computer Internet home page measures
330 kilobytes. You would have spent more than $2.50 to download a Web
page that may or may not have worked on your mobile phone. Uh-oh.
That’s not good news for any BusinessWeek.com reader surfing the mobile
Internet: You get a bad mobile browsing experience at an extremely high
price for a page that wasn’t even designed for mobile Web browsing.

Part III: Mobile Internet Mania for the Everyday Consumer 

When you go online to the Ready.mobi testing site, you see whether your
chosen Web site works well on a mobile phone — and you can share a full
report with the company that publishes the site, in case you want it to fix 
the site to work on your mobile phone.
For comparison’s sake, check out the BusinessWeek.com made-for-mobile
Internet site: http://businessweek.mobi. Again, go to the Ready.mobi
test site at http://ready.mobi from your computer.
Bingo! The BusinessWeek.com mobile site has a Ready.mobi score of 4 out 5
(see Figure 7-4). That score is excellent, considering that the site, which 
measures 10 kilobytes, works on more than 4,000 types of mobile phones 
and costs less than a dime to download on even the most expensive wireless
carrier data plan.
When you’re surfing off-portal from your mobile browser, make sure that 
the Web site you’re surfing to or linking to is specifically a made-for-mobile
Internet site. If you’re in doubt, check out the site at Ready.mobi before load-
ing it on your mobile phone. Or, just don’t try the site if it doesn’t indicate that
it will work on the mobile Internet.

Chapter 7: Browsing the Web from the Palm of Your Hand

Spotting made-for-mobile Internet sites
You know that the URL you’re typing into your mobile phone browser is 
a made-for-mobile Internet address if it meets just one condition: It has 
the .mobi domain suffix, such as http://mifd.mobi. You can also look 
for addresses that look like these examples:
 http://m.sitename.com
 http://mobile.sitename.com
 http://wap.sitename.com
 http://sitename.com/mobile
 http://sitename.com/wap
We cannot list every variation of mobile Internet site address identifiers, of
course, so just look for the terms wap, mobile, wireless, or PDA or the letter 
m before or after the sitename.com part. These made-for-mobile identifiers
can truly help you out. Also, see whether the publisher advertises and 
promotes the site as a mobile Internet site.
Sometimes a regular Web site with a normal Internet URL detects that you’re
accessing the site from a mobile browser and redirects your request to its
made-for-mobile Internet site. Although this detection doesn’t take place on
all Internet Web sites, check the site at http://ready.mobi to be sure how
it works on a mobile phone.
Exploring information, entertainment, 
and more
Off-portal mobile browsing provides you with access to a broad scope of
mobile Internet sites and services, including information, entertainment,
travel, and business. There are a plethora of ways we could categorize the
off-portal mobile Web; in the next couple of chapters we introduce you to
mobile search, mobile entertainment, mobile shopping, and mobile financial
services. To get you started on your off-portal surfing, here are a couple of
examples of excellent mobile Internet sites.
You’re billed for wireless data transfer for mobile Web browsing services
based on the amount of data sent and received — not for time spent on the
network, as with voice calls. Make sure that you have a mobile Internet ser-
vice plan in place with your wireless carrier before trying out any of the sites
or services highlighted in this book. See “Browsing On-Portal: Your Carrier’s
Made-for-Mobile Offerings,” earlier in this chapter, for more information
about the costs.
96
Part III: Mobile Internet Mania for the Everyday Consumer 

You can look for mobile Internet sites in many ways; the simplest method 
is to use the Search function on your mobile phone to enter a word for the
type of site you’re looking for and then press Go. We detail mobile search
capabilities in Chapter 8.
Information
Mobile Internet sites that provide news, weather, sports, financial, and traffic
updates are handy to have when you’re on the go.
To look at a city’s weather forecast from The Weather Channel, follow these
steps:
1. Open your mobile browser.
You can usually open it from the main menu of your mobile phone.
2. Enter the URL for The Weather Channel at http://weather.mobi.
Find the menu item labeled Enter Address or Go to URL or similar 
wording. Enter http://weather.mobi and open the page, as shown in
Figure 7-5 (screen appearance may vary by handset model).
3. To change the location for the weather forecast, select the Change
Location link on the right (refer to Figure 7-5).
A form opens, similar to the one shown in Figure 7-6.
4. Enter the zip code of the city you want (we use Atlanta in this exam-
ple) and click Search, or simply scroll down the menu selection to
your city and click Select.
5. Scroll down The Weather Channel’s made-for-mobile Web page to see
the city’s weather conditions, forecasts, travel advisories, and outdoor
activities, as shown in Figure 7-7.

Travel
From flight times to checking in to a hotel to finding your way back home,
mobile phones and anything to do with travel have always been helpful 
companions. Many airlines have mobile Internet sites, and hotel and car 
companies are jumping on board. If you get lost on your way, some terrific
sites that are now in operation can get you where you need to go.
Here are some destination sites to try out on your mobile phone:
 Orbitz travel updates: http://mobile.orbitz.com
 Hilton Hotels: http://hilton.mobi
 Pilot maps and directions: http://pilot.mobi
If you want to know more about some of the products and services from your
favorite brands, look them up on the mobile Internet just when you need 
to know. Go to the mobile Internet storefronts to purchase products, have
brochures sent by e-mail, and get the latest news from the executive suite.

 Nokia mobile phones and services: http://nokia.mobi
 CISCO Networks: http://cisco.mobi
Bookmarking a mobile Internet site
Bookmarking a mobile Internet site on your mobile phone is a timesaver
because you save yourself many extra steps when you want to access the site
again. The process generally works as follows, though some specifics may
depend on your phone model:
1. Open the page you want to bookmark.
2. Select Menu or Options (or whichever wording your phone uses).
3. Select Add to Favorites or Add Bookmark.
99
Chapter 7: Browsing the Web from the Palm of Your Hand

The next time you want to look up the site, you can do it from your mobile
phone. Click Bookmarks or Favorites, scroll down the list to the site you want
to access, and click OK. If your phone asks whether you want to connect to
the network, select Yes.

Part III: Mobile Internet Mania for the Everyday Consumer 
Another way to get on the Net: Mobile 
Web applications and widgets
Made-for-mobile Web applications and widgets
are new mobile Internet offerings specifically
designed by highly skilled experts in the mobile
industry to give you a Web-like experience on
your phone without having to launch your
mobile browser. These products offer the utility
and convenience that you may have come to
expect from the computer Internet world and
are limited to a few traditional mobile phones,
almost all smartphones, and all PDAs. Once
downloaded to your phone, both types of appli-
cations are fully integrated with the capabilities
of your mobile phone, smartphone, or PDA. They
also run in real-time (if required), which lever-
ages your mobile Internet data connection to
retrieve the information required to get the
latest updates for the application without you
having to browse the mobile Web for them.
(iPhone and BlackBerry users know exactly
what we’re talking about.)
Mobile Web applications provide you with a full
menu of rich media features and services with
content to run the application delivered and
updated over-the-air either once a day or when
the information is made available from the pub-
lisher. Here are a couple of cool mobile Web
applications directly from a couple of popular
favorite magazines:
 People: www.people.com/people/
mobile
 Sports Illustrated:
http://sports
illustrated.cnn.com/mysi
mobile/download.html
Widgets are simple little applications you down-
load to your phone to view specific information
like the news, the weather, and the stock
market, and you need only one touch to view
them. You can set the widget to provide you with
only the information you want with the content
delivered over the air right when you need it.
Some of the best widgets are very basic, such
as for weather (including animated maps and
iPhone widgets from The Weather Channel at
www.weather.com/mobile); others are
more robust, such as the network of offerings
from the mobile widget innovators at Widsets
(www.widsets.com).

Mobile Search: Find What You
Want, When You Want It
In This Chapter
 Getting started in your mobile search
 Distinguishing between Internet searches and mobile searches
 Putting text messaging to work to find information
 Checking out made-for-mobile directories
A
fter you start surfing the mobile Internet a little, you might begin to
wonder how on earth to make sense of all the wonderful made-for-
mobile Internet sites you keep stumbling on. Although mobile Internet 
sites are still somewhat smaller in number than their desktop equivalents,
hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of mobile Internet sites and pages 
are out there. And the number is growing fast.
How do you keep track of where everything is? And how do you find what
you’re looking for?
In this chapter, we talk about mobile search — what it can do for you and
what it can’t do — and then give you some tips for how best to explore your
new mobile surroundings.
Mobile search services are usually free to use, but wireless carrier data-
service fees still apply. Make sure that you know which type of mobile
Internet package or program you have before trying any mobile search 
services. Additional charges may apply for links to any sites you find by 
using mobile search, especially if the recommended sites aren’t made-for-
mobile or on your wireless carrier’s portal.
To Search Is to Find!
To get you started with searching, this section shows you a few common
examples of how to use mobile search to find interesting information on the
mobile Internet.

Before starting, make sure that your mobile handset is turned on, and then
start the mobile browser. Some phones have a mobile search engine set to
open as the home page. If that’s the case, you can start using it immediately.
If not, you might need to enter the address of a made-for-mobile search
engine. Try any of these:
 Google: http://google.mobi
 Microsoft Live Search: http://m.live.com
 Yahoo! oneSearch: http://yahoo.mobi
 Find.mobi: http://find.mobi
Figure 8-1 shows some search engines you can try:

Part III: Mobile Internet Mania for the Everyday Consumer 

Searching basics
Most mobile search engines have similar user interfaces. You normally see an
empty box (where you enter the search term) and a button you click to start
the search.
You might see some other elements on the page, such as advanced search
options or sign-in buttons, but don’t worry about them for now.
After the search has been run, you see a list of results that relate to (you
hope!) the topic you searched for. The search engine lists the results by most
relevant — and of course you hope that the page you’re most interested in is
at the top of the list.
The following guidelines can help make your mobile search more effective:
 Use short but precise terms. Don’t type long phrases into your mobile
browser. Although you should refine your searches as much as possible,
don’t use lots of unnecessary words. For example, the search term I
want a taxicab in Austin is no more effective than just Austin
taxicab.
 Benefit from location. If you’re looking for a term that has some local 
or regional relevance, consider entering the place name in the search
query. In the examples in the upcoming sections, you’ll see how some
search engines spot common place names in a query. In fact, because
some search engines even remember that location in subsequent
queries, you’ll also benefit in the future from results that are relevant 
to that location.
 Use the best approach for the job. Look around to find which option
suits you best. If you’re searching for local services and information,
Google, Yahoo!, and Microsoft are helpful. If you’re looking to find pages
on the made-for-mobile Internet, find.mobi is a good option. If you’re
interested in music and video, you might decide that Taptu is the place
to go.
The examples in the following sections illustrate how each of these work in
more detail.
Finding a taxi cab
Imagine that you’re in Austin, Texas, and you want to go shopping. Also, you
have only your trusty mobile phone to help you find your way around!
First, you probably need some type of transport, so you start with the Google
mobile search service to find a taxi:
103
Chapter 8: Mobile Search: Find What You Want, When You Want It

1. Open your mobile browser.
You normally find it on the main menu of your mobile phone.
2. Open the mobile Internet search engine page.
Your browser might display a search box on its start page anyway. If not,
find the menu item labeled Enter Address or Go to URL or similar word-
ing (exact usage varies by handset model). Enter http://google.mobi and
open the search page.
3. Enter a search term, such as taxicab, into the Search box.
4. Select the Search button.
Voilà! Your results appear, as shown in Figure 8-2.
The results display the page title and, helpfully, a small snippet of the page
that describes its contents. On your mobile phone, snippets are truly helpful
because you don’t have to click every link (costing time and money) to deter-
mine whether the page what you’re looking for. (On the other hand, they take
up valuable screen space on a mobile screen, so sometimes these snippets
are quite concise!)
The first result shows a page about taxi cabs on Wikipedia.org. That’s a 
good start because it’s extremely relevant to what you’re looking for in this
example.
However, you want to find a telephone number for a taxi service, so the
second entry looks better: 1-800-TAXI-CAB sounds exactly like the service
you need!
After you click this link to go the site, it displays a search form and a list of
cities and states. If you scroll down to Austin, you’re all set with a list of 
taxicab companies.
Figure 8-2:
Search
results for
taxicab.
104
Part III: Mobile Internet Mania for the Everyday Consumer 

Don’t expect every mobile search engine to return the same results. Each one
returns different pages.
Try the same task with another mobile search engine, Find.mobi, and see
what you find. As before:
1. Open your mobile browser if it is not already open.
You normally find it on the main menu of your mobile phone.
2. Open the mobile Internet search engine page.
Find the menu item labeled Enter Address or Go to URL or similar 
wording (exact usage varies by handset model). Enter http://find.mobi
and open the search page.
3. Enter a search term.
For example, enter taxicab.
4. Select the Search button.
On this search engine, the results are displayed in a slightly different
way from the Google list, as shown in Figure 8-3. Not only that, but the
result pages listed are slightly differently too. Some results are grouped
as reference information (such as the Wikipedia result) and others as
regular Web pages. Again, you probably don’t need the reference pages,
so skip to the first result in the second section: http://taxicab.
mobi. It looks good!
Because mobile search engines are becoming increasingly location-aware,
quite often you can enter your location in the search box to find more 
relevant answers more quickly.
Figure 8-3:
Getting
search
results for
finding a
taxicab.
105
Chapter 8: Mobile Search: Find What You Want, When You Want It

Try the Google mobile search again, and include Austin in your search term:
Austin taxicab. Follow the same steps outlined earlier in this section for the
Google mobile search for a taxicab.
As you can see in Figure 8-4, Google detects the word Austin in the search
terms and identifies it as the name of a city and lists the taxicab companies 
in its results! This result is quite cool because it prevents you from having to
follow any links. What’s more, the listing even contains the cab companies’
telephone numbers. Clicking these links makes your mobile phone dial the
taxi cab companies. So, a few moments later, you’re on your way!
Going shopping
So now suppose that you need to find out where to shop in the city of Austin,
Texas. In this search example, we show you how to look for stores or a shop-
ping mall using Microsoft Live and the Yahoo! mobile Internet search engine.
First, try the phrase Austin mall at http://m.live.com and see what the
search engine returns. If you get the same results we did, you don’t see 
the results you need.
Second, try the same the phrase, Austin mall, at http://yahoo.mobi. 
The results show two candidates, with locations, numbers, and a link to
directions — very cool! Click the titles of the results, and you see the address
and cross streets of the mall location, as shown in Figure 8-5. This site might
be useful if your taxicab driver doesn’t know how to find the location where
you want to be dropped off.
Figure 8-4:
Searching

in Austin.
106
Part III: Mobile Internet Mania for the Everyday Consumer 

Yahoo! also provides a listing of shopping malls with call links. Clicking links
displays user reviews of the shopping malls, as shown in Figure 8-6.
The interesting point in both searches (and in the Google taxicab example) is
that you see dedicated results in the mobile search page. You don’t have to
click to go to another site, because all the information you need is right there.
This theme is an important one for the mobile Internet: Mobile users want to
find information quickly, and the information they want should be relevant to
where they physically are the moment they perform the search. Although it’s
early in the made-for-mobile Internet world, all these mobile Internet search
engine services are starting to show how important this concept is.

Chapter 8: Mobile Search: Find What You Want, When You Want It

Searching for a song
On your way to the shops, imagine that you want to find some music to listen
to on your phone. Perhaps you heard a snippet of a tune you love as you
were leaving home, and you want to listen to the whole song.
One mobile search company, Taptu, provides an excellent service for finding
music and media at http://taptu.mobi. If the tune you heard was “Peggy
Sue,” by Buddy Holly, you can probably use either the song title or the author
of the tune in the search engine. In the following example, we use the search
term Peggy Sue.
Follow these steps:
1. Open your mobile phone browser.
2. Enter the Taptu URL — http://taptu.mobi.
3. Enter the phrase Peggy Sue in the Search box, as shown in Figure 8-7.
4. Click Search.
There you go! At the top of the page is a link to a song and a link to a
video of Buddy performing his classic tune, as shown in Figure 8-8.
(Lower on the list, you also see links to other relevant entertainment links,
such as the film Peggy Sue Got Married.)
Clicking the results in Taptu is a quick way to find the music itself. You see a
summary page, and you can see YouTube user ratings along with some other
relevant information. From there, you can even see a 30-second clip of the
video (if your mobile phone supports it) before you download the whole
thing. This is invaluable if you’re trying to ensure that it’s the correct version
of the song you’re seeking.

Recognizing the Unique Characteristics
of a Mobile Internet Search
In theory, a mobile Internet search engine offers a similar service to a regular
Internet Web search. A user types a phrase, and the search engine should
return a list of relevant pages as quickly as it can.
On the mobile Internet, however, getting this process right isn’t without its
challenges, for both the search engine and the user!
The made-for-mobile Internet is a little different from the regular Internet
Web, and some of those differences make events somewhat surprising. 
Here are some key examples:
 Mobile Web pages aren’t as large as their cousins on the regular Web,
so they don’t contain as many words to be indexed. Ensuring that the
pages are relevant to what you, the user, want to find is a little more 
difficult.
 The mobile Web is less “linked” than the regular Web. Because mobile
Web pages have precious little space for a screen display, they don’t
waste it on links to other sites, and focus instead on their primary con-
tent. That concept works well — until a Web search engine, which is
accustomed to being able to judge the quality of sites based on incom-
ing links, tries to figure out whether it’s important.
 Mobile search is for mobile users. When you’re searching for something
on the regular Web, you’re probably sitting at a desktop computer with a
decent-size screen, and you’re rarely in a hurry to go anywhere.

Chapter 8: Mobile Search: Find What You Want, When You Want It

But the mobile Internet is, by definition, a medium designed to be used
by humans on the move! Mobile device keyboards make typing keyword
searches difficult in the first place; users don’t necessarily have the time
and patience to skim page after page of less relevant results. And loca-
tion is important: Users very often want results that are relevant to their
whereabouts (as we show in the Austin taxicab mobile search example,
earlier in this chapter).
 The mobile Web is, in many parts of the world, just emerging from
wireless carrier portals (or walled gardens). Users ought to be allowed
to search for content both on and off those mobile Internet portals, and
even then, made-for-mobile content doesn’t yet exist for many topics.
To address this situation, some mobile Internet search engines provide a
transcoding service to collapse full, desktop-style Internet Web pages into a
sort of mobile-readable format. Although this solution doesn’t always provide
a particularly good experience for mobile users, it might be better than 
nothing. A collapsed Web page might still contain the material you’re looking
for, in the absence of a dedicated mobile Internet page on that topic.
Letting Text Messaging Help 
You Find Information
Another useful way to search on your mobile phone is to use text-messaging
search services set up by Google, Tellme, and 4INFO. These mobile search
services can often get you to certain types of information quicker than if you
went via your mobile browser.
When you use text messaging search (sometimes called SMS search), you’re
limited to specific words and phrases, and you receive limited answers to
your queries (usually fewer than 160 characters). Some services also offer
links to mobile Internet sites for additional information about your mobile
search requests.
Bear in mind that your request for information might incur premium-rate text
messaging charges. Check with each service directly before you jump in with
both feet, and make sure that you read the fine print.
An example of a text messaging search comes from 4INFO, a company that
can help you find local WiFi hotspots, restaurants, movie showtimes, and
many other pieces of day-to-day information. All you have to do is send a 
specific keyword text message (such as a package tracking number) to the
4INFO short code 44636 (4INFO spelled out on your mobile phone keypad),
110
Part III: Mobile Internet Mania for the Everyday Consumer 

and the service sends you the information you request. The 4INFO Web site
listing of all its text messaging mobile search offerings (keywords) is at
http://www.4info.net.
Although the service is free from 4INFO, wireless carrier standard text-
messaging service fees apply. Make sure that you know which type of 
text messaging program you have before trying any text messaging 
services.
For a closer look at how this process works, follow these steps to find 
your local WiFi hotspot:
1. Open the Messaging application on your mobile phone and find the
text messaging or SMS service.
2. Enter the recipient or address as 44636 to go to 4INFO.
3. Enter the keyword wifi 94025 on the message screen.
The number is your zip code.
4. Press Send on your phone.
Within seconds, you know where the WiFi hotspots are, as shown in
Figure 8-9, and even whether they’re free.

Looking into Made-for-Mobile Directories
Using a mobile Internet search engine isn’t the only way in which you can 
discover content. The mobile Internet is still small enough that it’s possible
to categorize the interesting sites into manually edited directories.
If you get misty-eyed recalling the Web of the mid-1990s, you know that this 
is exactly how Yahoo! started: It was a hierarchical listing of Web sites, sorted
by topic. The directory approach worked well when the Web was young: It
was small enough to catalog, and it helped new users understand what sort
of information was out there.
For the same reasons today, you can find some excellent site directories on
the mobile Internet. If you can’t find what you’re looking for by using regular
mobile searches, or if you just want to browse to see what’s out there, try
some of the services we describe in the following sections.
112
Part III: Mobile Internet Mania for the Everyday Consumer 
The future of search for your phone
A new category of mobile search is being
launched by wireless carriers, handset vendors,
and mobile Internet search engine companies:
mobile search software applications. These
made-for-mobile applications are available for
a limited number of mobile phones, smart-
phones, and PDAs. However, the cool part is
that they usually help you find more than stores
and restaurants — they also help you find infor-
mation stored on your mobile phone itself. If you
need to find a friend’s phone number, for exam-
ple, just go to the mobile search application and,
if the number is on your mobile phone, the appli-
cation retrieves it. If the number isn’t there, the
application can find it on the Web for you
instead. If you have a fairly new mobile phone,
the mobile search software application may
already be built-in for you. If it isn’t and you want
it, either go to your wireless carrier’s or hand-
set vendor’s Web site to buy it or go online to
Google, Yahoo!, or Tellme.
Another exciting development in this area is
voice-based search. This is the ability for a user
to dial a number, speak the phrase that they are
looking for, and then have information returned
to their phone via text message or Web link.
Watch out for both of these types of service
becoming more common in coming months.

Finding carrier directories
Your wireless carrier’s mobile Internet portal is one of the best mobile 
directories because it’s (usually) free to use as long as you stay within its
walled garden and you have the appropriate flat-rate mobile Internet pack-
age. Almost all the basic services, applications, and support information 
that you expect from them can be found on your wireless carrier’s home
page. See Chapter 7 for more details.
To open your wireless carrier’s home page, just click the mobile browser or
mobile Web icon on your phone and launch the service.
Visiting third-party directories 
on the mobile Internet
If you don’t find what you want or like after perusing your wireless carrier’s
directory, we list a few excellent public mobile directories for you to visit:
 YesWAP: This helpful directory of mobile-only Web sites is well catego-
rized, which makes it easy to navigate. Check it out in Figure 8-10. The
service (at http://yeswap.com) contains hundreds of sites that 
have been human-reviewed, organized into categories such as News,
Weather, Sports, Entertainment, and Technology.
 WapSwap: This directory of mobile-only sites is also well categorized.
The site (at http://wapswap.com) adds intriguing categories, such 
as Food and Drink and Gadgets and Tech.
Figure 8-10:

Chapter 8: Mobile Search: Find What You Want, When You Want It

 JamPaw: With categories similar to the ones in other directories,
JamPaw (http://jampaw.com) offers an option to personalize your
own list of links. It also contains a list of mobile Internet search engines,
allowing you to quickly link to many of the ones we discuss in this 
chapter.
To visit any of these directories, follow these steps:
1. Open your mobile phone browser.
2. Enter the URL of the directory you want to visit.
3. Press Enter to go to the mobile Internet site.

for Your Phone
In This Chapter
 Adding entertainment from your wireless carrier to your phone
 Downloading ringtones, wallpaper, games, music, and video to your mobile phone
 Finding mobile entertainment content from sources other than your wireless carrier
A
big reason why the mobile Internet is becoming popular is the capability
to access mobile entertainment services anytime, anywhere, directly to
your mobile device.
The entertainment industry has finally discovered the value of the mobile
Internet as a medium to distribute content to mass market consumers, and
ringtones, wallpapers, music, videos, and games are all available on the mobile
Internet. The superstar singer Madonna, who had been reluctant to offer her
music by digital download, was the first major artist to make preview ringtones
from her album available only to mobile phone subscribers — before releasing
it for purchase in stores and over the Internet.
To truly enjoy the user experience, you have to know where to find the best
deals for mobile content and how to put it on your mobile phone.
This chapter shows you both on-portal and off-portal (see Chapter 7) examples
of mobile entertainment options and describes how to find the best possible
prices.
In Chapter 14, we show you how to become an active creator of made-for-mobile
services, by either creating your own mobile-content storefront or uploading
videos and pictures on your mobile blog. First, you have to know the basics.
The mobile entertainment market is booming with new made-for-mobile prod-
ucts and services hitting the red carpet every day. To keep you updated on the
latest from the art, music, and entertainment worlds — both on-portal and off
deck — keep our Web site, http://mifd.mobi, bookmarked on your computer

and mobile phone. We will keep you updated in the Mobile Entertainment
directory showcasing what’s available from the wireless carriers and third-
party service companies.
Checking Out On-Portal Entertainment
If you look at the major U.S. wireless carriers — Alltel Wireless, AT&T Mobility,
Sprint, T-Mobile, and Verizon Wireless — you see that they all offer a full range
of entertainment capabilities for your mobile phone. They all have ringtones,
wallpapers, music, videos, games, and even streaming TV available for you to
enjoy on your mobile phone.
Wireless carriers have made it quite easy to use their on- portal services to
find everything you need for your mobile phone. Each carrier’s offerings vary
and depend entirely on your chosen mobile phone model and service plan.
Because too many wireless carriers exist to be able to show you how each one
offers its on-portal mobile entertainment services, the next few sections demon-
strate a couple of services from each carrier. To find out more about what your
wireless carrier offers, see Chapter 7, where we outline several on-portal mobile
content links.
Downloading ringtones and 
wallpapers by AT&T
AT&T has developed the mobile entertainment shopping mall AT&T MEdia Mall,
as shown in Figure 9-1. You can preview and download ringtones, graphics, games,
music, videos, TV shows, and more to your phone for a monthly charge or one-
time download fee. To view all available AT&T services, go to http://media
mall.wireless.att.com from the Internet browser on your computer. AT&T
lets you subscribe to a content bundle or pay as you go for these services, which
is typical of most carriers.
Here’s how the AT&T service works:
 To sign up for the AT&T MyMEdia monthly subscription programs, text-
message the keyword YES to the short code 7225 from your mobile
phone’s messaging service menu.
 The monthly subscription is $5.99 (for 15 credits), $9.99 (30 credits), or
$14.00 (50 credits). Credits are to be used for ringtones, wallpapers, or
other service you want to consume every month.

 You can cancel your AT&T MyMEdia monthly subscription at any time
by text-messaging the keyword STOP to the short code 7225 and following
the instructions in the return message that’s sent to your mobile phone.
 If you don’t want a monthly subscription, you can simply pay for your
products and services individually as you want them. For example, to
download a ringtone, you’re billed for the price of the selected ringtone
and for the download cost. An average ringtone is about 10 Kbps and costs
ten cents to download at an airtime rate of $0.01 per Kbps. A graphical
image can cost a bit more to download, depending on the size of the file.
Ringtones and wallpapers are often created in different technological formats.
For example, ringtones come in three main types: monophonic, polyphonic,
and Super Tone. The type of device you have determines which type of con-
tent works on your mobile phone.
You can download ringtones and wallpapers from AT&T in three ways: from
your computer, by using your phone’s browser, or by way of text message.
The following sections explain the steps for downloading from your computer
and from your phone’s browser.
For more information on how to preview, purchase, and download any mobile
content, contact AT&T directly over the Internet, call customer service, or
visit a retail location.

Chapter 9: Multimedia Entertainment for Your Phone

Whatever your method of purchasing ringtones and wallpapers, charges
appear on your monthly bill.
From a computer
You can save on your wireless data charges by surfing the AT&T Internet site
to look at all the content offered before downloading to your phone. Follow
these steps:
1. On your computer, go to the AT&T Web site at http://www.wireless.
att.com/cell-phone-service/welcome and click the Shop tab and
then Ringtones & More. Click the Ringtones and Graphics link.
2. Search for a title and click its Buy button.
You can click the Preview button first (it looks like a speaker) to listen to
the ringtone.
3. Enter your personal and mobile phone information.
A confirmation text message is sent to your phone with a link to the
product you just purchased.
4. On your phone, scroll to the link and highlight it, and then select
Enter by pressing your phone’s softkey to download the ringtone and
make it available on your phone. Follow the installation instructions,
which vary by phone or model.
After your selection is downloaded, your mobile phone displays a message
asking you to confirm the file folder where it will store the product.
5. Press Enter to accept the download.
The ringtone or wallpaper you purchased will now be stored on your
mobile phone for you to access and use as you like.
6. Use the phone menu to go to the Settings area and set the new ring-
tone or wallpaper for the services you want to use it for.
Depending on which product you selected, it’s now ready for you to program
for use whenever someone gives you a call, or to use as wallpaper on your
screen.
From your mobile phone
You can also go directly to the AT&T mobile site on your phone to view the
products offered and download them from wherever you are. Follow these steps:
1. Launch your mobile browser.
You browser opens to the AT&T portal home page featuring the MEdia
Net services menu. You don’t need to enter a URL.
2. Select Ringtones and Graphics from the MEdia Net main menu.
3. Search for the title of a product you want to download and select it.
118
Part III: Mobile Internet Mania for the Everyday Consumer 

4. Select the Buy button to download your selection to your phone.
After the product is downloaded, your phone displays a message asking
you to confirm the file folder where it will store the product.
5. Press Enter to accept the download.
The ringtone or wallpaper you purchased will now be stored on your
mobile phone for you to access and use as you like.
6. Use the phone menu to go to the Settings area and set the new ring-
tone or wallpaper for the service you chose.
Depending on which product you selected, it’s ready for you to program for
use whenever someone gives you a call or as a wallpaper on your screen.
Finding music at Sprint.com
Downloading ringtones is not the only way to get music to your mobile phone
through the mobile Internet. Many of the latest mobile phone models can store
music similar to an iPod from Apple or on any MP3 player. Wireless carriers
have been eager to add iTunes-like digital music storefronts on their Web sites
so that people can download music directly to their mobile phones.
The mobile Internet services in this section apply only to Sprint subscribers
and don’t work on any other wireless carrier networks or mobile phones.
However, this section can still give you an idea of how these services work,
because most carriers’ services work in a similar way.
If you’re not a Sprint subscriber, your wireless carrier may offer music down-
loads as well. Go to its Web site to start the process of downloading music to
your mobile phone. You may have to experiment, but the steps should be rel-
atively straightforward.
From a computer
As with ringtones and wallpaper, music downloads can work in a couple of
different ways. The first one we cover here is from your computer, as it is
easier to find what you want on your bigger computer monitor, surf all the
selections made available, and preview the songs all without paying wireless
data charges. Follow these steps on your computer to browse what’s available:
1. On your computer, go to the Sprint Web site at www.sprint.com and
click the Services tab in the middle of the page.
2. Click the Music link on the left side of the page. Click the Sprint Music
Store link.
This step opens the Sprint Digital Lounge, where you can browse, pre-
view, and purchase any of the songs offered for your mobile phone.
119
Chapter 9: Multimedia Entertainment for Your Phone

3. Click the Music link.
A list of songs appears, which you can purchase and download to your
computer and transfer to your mobile phone.
4. Click the song you want to download.
You can listen to the song before you purchase it. If you haven’t already
signed in, and you want to buy the song, you need to sign into the Sprint
Digital Lounge.
5. Click the Buy It Now button to purchase the ringtone.
6. After you’ve purchased the music, transfer it to your mobile phone by
connecting your phone to your computer with the accessory cables
that came with your phone or via Bluetooth.
The best way to transfer songs to your phone is up to you; we recom-
mend you visit your local wireless carrier store to show you how to do
it, especially if you’re not familiar with connecting your phone to your
computer. If you are familiar with downloading songs to an iPod or other
digital music player, then follow the steps recommended by your wire-
less carrier to download music to your phone.
Take advantage of all the great Sprint Digital Lounge services by signing up
for either My Content Manager or Sprint Music Manager. You can manage all
your mobile content, including music, that you purchase from Sprint right on your
computer (like any digital music storefront). From My Content Manager, you can
send (or transfer) your music to your mobile phone — or even to a friend’s
phone.
To take advantage of the music that Sprint offers, you must have a Sprint-
compatible phone model and subscribe to an appropriate Sprint service plan.
From your phone
If you don’t want to use your computer to transfer music to your mobile
phone, you can easily use your mobile phone to purchase and download
music directly. The process is quite simple. Here are the steps to download
music over-the-air (sometimes abbreviated as OTA):
1. Launch your mobile browser on your Sprint mobile phone. Click the
Sprint Music Store link.
When you enter the Sprint Music Store for the first time, you need to set
up your user identification and password. (If you have a user ID, you can
skip this step.)
2. From the Sprint Music Store opening page, browse songs by Feature
Music or by Categories, or search for a specific song.
3. When you have found the song you want to buy, highlight it and press
the OK button on your phone.
The information about the song will be displayed on your screen.
120
Part III: Mobile Internet Mania for the Everyday Consumer 

4. Select the Preview option if you just want to listen to the song, or
select the Buy Song option if you want to purchase the song and
download it to your phone.
When you buy the song, the file automatically downloads to your phone.
Make sure it goes to your phone memory card (often called a microSD
card). If you don’t have a microSD card, or your memory is full, you will
be alerted about that.
5. After the song is downloaded to your phone, choose whether to listen
to the song, add the song to a playlist, or simply continuing shopping
for new songs.
Grabbing games on the go with Verizon
If you’re into games, you’re in luck — people like you are downloading games
and using them when they’re bored or waiting for someone or when they
simply want to relax after a stressful day.
Basically, two types of games are available:
 Single-player: Games that you download to your mobile phone to play
by yourself when you have a moment. You pay only the cost of the game.
Often they’re free, and sometimes you only pay download charges.
 Multiplayer: Games that are played by more than one player. The players
might be individuals or teams competing against each other or against an
enemy that can be either a computer or a human player. Typically a mul-
tiplayer game requires you to be connected to the wireless carrier network.
Be aware that airtime and wireless data charges apply when you’re playing
over the network.
When you purchase games from Verizon Wireless, you have two service options:
subscription and unlimited. When you purchase a subscription, you can
access a game for a limited period, and you’re billed daily, monthly, or annu-
ally, depending on the game. When you choose the unlimited option, you can
access the game whenever and for however long you want to play it and pay
only a one-time fee.
To find games from Verizon Wireless, you have a few options:
 From your computer: Purchase games at the Verizon Wireless Games
Web site at http://products.vzw.com/index.aspx?id=games.
 From your mobile phone if you subscribe to Verizon Wireless: The
best way to find games is to select the Get Fun & Games button on your
mobile phone. It directs you to the area of your phone where you can
browse for games.
121
Chapter 9: Multimedia Entertainment for Your Phone

 From your mobile phone if you know what you’re looking for: Use the
Get It Now icon to search for a game to purchase. Follow these steps:
1. On your mobile phone menu, select the Get It Now icon.
2. Select Games.
3. Select Get New App.
4. Select Top Sellers and press Go.
5. After you decide which game you want to purchase, simply follow the
on-screen instructions to download it.
The steps required to purchase and download content are similar to how you
download ringtones and wallpaper.
Watching mobile TV and video 
by using Verizon Wireless
If you’re of a certain age, you might remember the teeny Sony TV that fit into
a shirt pocket and that you could watch while walking down the street or
waiting in line. Sony didn’t sell many of them because they weren’t what
people wanted.
Now, of course, you don’t need to buy an extra device. You already carry
around a portable TV — on your mobile phone. Watching TV is just a matter
of using your phone to watch programs. Although mobile video isn’t as main-
stream as other services at the time we write this book (primarily because
video still costs too much to have streaming TV live on your mobile phone),
we think that this situation is about to change now that wireless carriers offer
better and cheaper data plans.
All major national wireless carriers in the U.S. offer mobile TV and video. For
example, find the Verizon Wireless V CAST service at http://products.
vzw.com/index.aspx?id=video, as shown in Figure 9-2. (Although V
CAST doesn’t cover the entire United States, it’s available in most major
urban areas. To see whether you’re in one, visit the Web site.)
To deliver V CAST mobile TV, Verizon Wireless uses a dedicated video network
so that you can watch video in real time and not have to wait. (The alternative:
Wait for a complete video file to be downloaded and saved before you can watch
it. You can then store the video file on your device and watch the video even
where you don’t receive a signal — on a plane trip, for example.) Because
Verizon Wireless uses a dedicated network, it’s not possible for you to view V
CAST Mobile TV in real time without being connected to the network.
122
Part III: Mobile Internet Mania for the Everyday Consumer 

Verizon Wireless has signed up with TV channels such as CBS Mobile, Comedy
Central, ESPN Mobile TV, Fox Mobile, MTV, and NBC News 2GO. You can watch
eight channels, benefit from parental controls, and watch unlimited basic
video clips, including monthly access to the Verizon Wireless Mobile Web 2.0
service. The V CAST Mobile TV Basic plan gives you limited TV access and
parental controls as well.
To take advantage of the Verizon Wireless mobile TV and video offers, you
must have a compatible phone and subscribe to the appropriate Verizon
Wireless service plan. If you’re not a Verizon Wireless subscriber, your wire-
less carrier may offer mobile video as well. When you visit the Web site, it
walks you through the process of downloading mobile video services to your
mobile phone.
Downloading TV and video
To access V CAST Mobile TV and videos on your phone, follow these steps:
1. Open the Get It Now menu.
You have two ways:
• On your V CAST phone, press the right navigation key to open the
Get It Now menu.
• Use the dedicated Mobile TV media softkey on the external body of
a specially designed V CAST mobile phone.
Figure 9-2:

Chapter 9: Multimedia Entertainment for Your Phone

2. Highlight Pictures and Video or Get PIX & FLIX on the menu, and then
press the OK button.
3. When you’re prompted to select V CAST On Demand or Get V CAST
Video, select one and then select OK.
The first time you open V CAST Video On Demand, you’re asked to
choose a daily or monthly access subscription. Choose a subscription
plan, and then select OK. If you’re asked to upgrade your V CAST soft-
ware, follow the instructions on your phone’s screen.
4. Highlight a video that you want to download.
5. Select the Options softkey.
6. Select Save Video and then select OK.
Some videos are available only to watch, not to download.
Finding saved clips on your phone
After downloading and saving video clips, you have two ways to access your
video clips:
 If you have a V CAST mobile phone, you have a V CAST application built
into your phone. You can access videos by using the My Videos (or My
Clips) option within the V CAST application.
 You can also access videos outside the V CAST application. Follow these
steps:
1. Launch the Get It Now option on the menu from your V
CAST–enabled mobile phone.
2. Select Picture & Video (or Get PIX & FLIX) from the menu.
3. Select My Videos (or My FLIX) to view your download.
Going Your Own Way (Off-Portal)
If you want to “go your own way” (for all you Fleetwood Mac fans), you can
easily do it — but it might cost you some extra money because that type of ser-
vice isn’t included in the package you subscribe to from your wireless carrier.
Exploring the mobile entertainment world on your mobile phone is both fun
and enlightening — and sometimes frustrating, especially when you’re using
a service or entering a site that’s not made-for-mobile.
In this section, we guide you to just a few of the most interesting made-for-
mobile sites that you can explore and take advantage of.
124
Part III: Mobile Internet Mania for the Everyday Consumer 

Because of the amount of wireless data needed to send any video, audio, or
TV content streaming over the air to your mobile phone, wait until you have
a flat-rate, unlimited, wireless data plan in place before trying any off-deck
services.
Finding music (and more) on 
the mobile Internet
Using the entertainment offers that your mobile carrier provides is probably
the easiest way to obtain music and ringtones on your mobile phone.
However, the variety of songs and genres they offer is often limited, and most
carriers don’t have the same number of choices that, for example, iTunes has.
Now you have other options for buying music and ringtones for your mobile
phone. You can search the Web for music to download to your mobile phone,
and hundreds of sites offer music and ringtones.
Be careful in choosing files to download to your mobile phone. We encourage
you to respect artists’ copyrights: If music or a ringtone is offered for free,
the artist’s rights have most likely been violated.
You have several options for finding music for your mobile phone:
 Sony Music: Offers music from its list of Sony BMG artists, as shown in
Figure 9-3. You can choose from thousands of songs in its store. Visit
www.sonymusicmobile.com.

Chapter 9: Multimedia Entertainment for Your Phone

 MTV Mobile: The MTV store (www.mtv.com/mobile) offers ringtones,
wallpaper, videos, TV shows, and music that you can purchase and play
on your mobile phone. Here’s how it works:
1. To send a selection to your phone, go to the Web site and select a
song or ringtone.
2. When a new window opens, click the Preview icon to listen to your
selection.
3. If you like what you hear, choose your carrier, select a format, and
enter your phone number, as shown in Figure 9-4.
You can now either purchase from an MTV Mobile plan (you must
already be signed up) or purchase an individual tone.
4. After you choose an item, select the Send to Phone button.
 Napster Mobile: At Napster Mobile (www.napster.com/napster
mobile), you can download music directly to your phone. You can
purchase single tracks and have the song you just downloaded sent
directly to your computer. To fully use this service, you must have a 
subscription to one of the wireless carriers with a Napster contract.
 iTunes: You may have downloaded thousands of songs from iTunes, and
now you want some of those songs on your mobile phone so that you don’t
have to carry both a phone and an iPod. Apple hasn’t made it easy to
transfer music files from iTunes to a mobile phone other than iPhone, but
now you have a few options for transferring the music to your mobile
phone. You can even download an open source system, ourTunes (http://
ourtunes.sourceforge.net), from the Web.

The steps required in order to purchase and download content are similar to
those outlined for on-portal ringtones and wallpaper.
Exploring mobile games
If you like to play games but the games that your wireless carrier offers don’t
keep you challenged, thousands of other mobile games are out there for you
to try out. Some of the hottest Internet and console game applications are
now made-for-mobile.
Here are a few sites where you can shop around and download games to your
mobile phone:
 EA Mobile is at www.eamobile.com.
 gameloft, shown in Figure 9-5, is at www.gameloft.com.
 Jamster has an excellent selection of mobile games at www.jamster.com.
The steps required to purchase and download content are similar to those

Checking out mobile TV and video
Mobile TV and video services are coming to a mobile phone near you, and
quite soon. As the wireless carriers are offering these types of services on-
portal, you may have heard of a few new off-portal entrants making this
happen as well:
 Media FLO TV service: This site features live streaming mobile TV at its
best. It’s a simulcast service for entertainment, news, sports, and kids’
television programming on a specially designed made-for-mobile TV net-
work. The site streams 24 hours a day and has traditional broadcast-like
programming, with popular TV shows and series from CBS Mobile, Comedy
Central, ESPN Mobile TV, FOX Mobile, MTV, NBC2Go, NBC News2Go, and
Nickelodeon — and many more in the pipeline. To access MediaFLO TV,
you need a special handset and a service subscription. You also must
understand that the service has very limited service area coverage
(because it’s a new network offering). Stay tuned to MediaFLO at http://
www.mediaflousa.com.
 YouTube Mobile: Watch video clips, which is a fun way to kill some time.
You can go live to YouTube Mobile directly from your mobile phone by
entering the made-for-mobile URL http://m.youtube.com on your
mobile browser. Also, go online from your computer to www.youtube.
com/mobile to find out more about YouTube on the go. YouTube has
some cool services available for you to tune in to (see Figure 9-6).

Chapter 9: Multimedia Entertainment for Your Phone
All games are platform dependent
The platform on a computer or phone is its
underlying operating system software. The Sun
Microsystems Java platform is the most
common platform for traditional mobile phones.
Most single-player games are created using
Java. If you have a camera on your mobile
phone, pretty well any mobile game created in
Java works on your phone. A simple way to
check to see if your mobile phone supports Java
is to look through your phone manual or ask your
wireless retailer. Mobile phone game companies
also list the phones their games work on — so
checking their Web sites is also very helpful.
For advanced mobile games, such as multi-
player gaming, a more advanced phone is
required to run the game. The following smart-
phone platforms are the most common for more
advanced gaming applications: Nokia Series 60,
Symbian OS, Windows Mobile, Palm OS,
BlackBerry OS, and iPhone. Mobile phones
cannot operate mobile games from different
mobile operating system platforms. When you
download mobile games or any other software
application for your mobile phone, be sure to
select the version made specifically for your
device. If it isn’t available, don’t download a sim-
ilar version; it probably won’t work on your
mobile phone and you’ll still have to pay for it.

 Exploring mobile e-mail service options beyond the BlackBerry
 Finding and using mobile instant-messaging services
 Participating in mobile social networking
W
hen you want to contact your friends, family, or colleagues, sometimes
the best method, of course, is to just call them. Many families and
friends, however, are taking advantage of all the Internet has to offer, too,
including e-mail, instant messaging, and even posting to blogs or social
networking sites.
When you have access to the mobile Internet, you can access all these features
from your mobile phone, and this chapter shows you how. You also find out
about social networks designed just for mobile Internet users, such as Twitter.
Discover which options you have, how and where you can find them on the
Net, what advantages they offer, and how you can best use them.
Discovering Mobile E-Mail Options
Today there are solutions with affordable e-mail. We show you how you no
longer have to wait at home or at the office for the important e-mail from
your boss. There are two types of e-mail:
 Push: In this “always-on” method, new e-mail is pushed instantly through
the system to your e-mail account. Push is in many cases the preferred
method because it tells you — just as your e-mail account on your com-
puter does — when you have new e-mail. Research in Motion (RIM) first
popularized push e-mail with its BlackBerry devices.

 Pull: You have to check your e-mail account from your Web browser on
your mobile phone to retrieve new e-mail, similar to Web mail. Popular
providers are Gmail and Yahoo! Mail.
If you’re hooked on e-mail and need to move your inbox to your mobile
phone, here’s a list of services offered by major wireless carriers:
 AT&T: www.wireless.att.com/learn/messaging-internet/
email/#mobile_email
 Sprint: www.nextel.com/en/services/email/mail.shtml
 Verizon Wireless push e-mail for smartphones with Wireless Sync:
www.verizonwireless.com/b2c/splash/wirelessSync/
wirelesssync.jsp
 Verizon Wireless mobile e-mail alert services: http://products.
vzw.com/index.aspx?id=messaging_email_learn
Each wireless carrier offers a different type of mobile e-mail solution in addition
to a different way to deliver e-mail to your phone. We highly recommend that
you talk with your local wireless carrier retailer or customer service repre-
sentative for more information on its specific mobile e-mail offerings to find
the best one suited to your budget and needs.
To use push mail without a BlackBerry, you need a smartphone or PDA, an
account with a wireless carrier that delivers push e-mail, or an account with a
third-party push e-mail software provider. Pull mail is a good option if you
don’t want or need to check e-mail all the time and you just want to check
your e-mail a couple of times a day.
Getting Started with 
Always-On Push Mail
Ever since Research in Motion popularized the push technology in the late
1990s, a few innovative companies have been in a rush to deliver similar
technology to the masses. But only in the past couple of years, unfortunately,
have other providers been able to deliver similar technology on a variety of
devices and across various platforms.
You can find several corporate push e-mail systems, such as Push, FlexMail,
Chattermail, and Emanzio; a few well-functioning push e-mail utilities are also
available for the general public, such as Emoze.
132
Part III: Mobile Internet Mania for the Everyday Consumer 

Before you download any third-party mail software, check with your wireless
carrier. It might even have implemented technologies that can provide push
e-mail or alerts from some of the major e-mail systems, business programs
such as Microsoft Outlook and Lotus Notes, and personal services such as
AOL, Yahoo! Mail, MSN Hotmail, Windows Live Mail, and Gmail by Google.
Also, check for any additional costs you may be charged for mobile e-mail
access and services.
The Emoze push e-mail system is available for Windows Mobile and Symbian
Series 60 devices, such as from Nokia. When you download the free software
to your device, you have two options:
 Install the software directly to your mobile phone. This approach makes
Emoze work only for your Internet-based Gmail or Yahoo! Mail account. It’s
useful when you’re away from a computer to check your e-mail. As with all
mobile Internet services, you need to be careful about the amount of e-mail
pushed to you because you may get charged for each one if you don’t 
subscribe to a flat-rate data plan.
 Install the software on your computer and on your phone. This option
is for corporate users and people running Microsoft Outlook for e-mail
(a Mac version is in the works). You can set up the software so that your
e-mail is pushed directly to your mobile phone as soon as the mail is
received in Microsoft Outlook on your computer. To make this process work,
you need to configure the appropriate Send/Receive schedule in Outlook.
The disadvantage of this option is that you need to leave your computer
turned on with Outlook and Emoze running if you want to receive e-mail
on your phone.
The following sections explain these installation processes and help you start
using Emoze.
Installing Emoze directly 
to your mobile phone
Before you install Emoze on your mobile phone, you must have an e-mail account
on a corporate Exchange server set up for WAP access, or an e-mail account with
Google Gmail or Yahoo! Mail.
When you’re ready, follow these steps:
1. On your phone, go to http://m.emoze.com and download Emoze by
clicking the Download Emoze Mobile Client link, shown in Figure 10-1.
The program installs itself automatically on your mobile phone. The Emoze
icon, which is round and green with a yellow triangle on a red background
in the middle, appears in the application folder on your phone.
133
Chapter 10: Keep Me Posted: E-Mail and Instant Messaging Go Mobile

2. To set up Emoze, go to the Messaging page on your phone or click the
envelope key.
3. On the messaging page, click New Account.
4. When you’re asked whether you want to synchronize with Outlook
Exchange or use a POP3 or IMAP e-mail provider, select one and click
Next.
5. Enter your name and e-mail address, and select the Automatic Setup
check box. When the Finished indicator appears, click Next.
It takes a couple of seconds to automatically complete the process.
6. Type your username and password for your e-mail account, and click
Next.
The Networks page opens.
7. Select one of the options and then click Next.
• The Internet: If you’re using Gmail or Yahoo! Mail, choose The
Internet.
• Auto Config., WAP Network, Secure WAP Network, Work: Choose one
of these options if you’re using Outlook over a corporate or private
network.
8. Verify that the Incoming Server and Outgoing Server info is filled in
correctly. Click Next.
9. Choose how many messages you want to store on your phone (All
Messages, Today’s Messages, or Last Three Days, for example) and
how many bytes (characters) you initially want to have sent to you
(Entire Message, Header Only, 500 bytes, 1000 bytes, or 5000 bytes).
Click Next.
Figure 10-1:

134
Part III: Mobile Internet Mania for the Everyday Consumer 

10. Choose how often you want e-mail pushed to you (every 15 minutes,
every half-hour, every hour, once a day, or never). Click Next.
Use this option to control the number of bytes that are pushed to your
phone. Note that connecting automatically may result in higher connection
charges.
Installing Emoze on your computer
You can install Emoze on your computer by following these steps:
1. Go to www.emoze.com/en/products/index.html on your computer’s
browser and click the Products tab.
2. On the new page that appears, choose Personal Web Mail, assuming
that you’re using it for your personal Web mail account.
Other options are
• Personal Home Mail (POP3)
• Small Business Solution
• Corporate Solutions
• Service Providers
The Personal Home Mail (POP3) option limits which phone models you
can use.
3. Working from the personal e-mail example, click the Get Emoze Now!
link.
A new page opens and gives you these options:
• Push My Office is for people who have Microsoft Outlook or Lotus
Notes. If you’re using Microsoft Outlook, the installation process
asks whether you have Outlook Web Access (OWA). OWA is avail-
able only on Microsoft Exchange Server, and if you use Yahoo! Mail,
you aren’t using OWA and you can click No to go to the next step.
The Emoze software then automatically begins downloading to your
computer. After the software is installed, it guides you through the
setup process in a few easy steps.
• Push My Gmail opens a site where you can choose from a range of
phone models. Choose your phone and click Submit. The site asks
you about three options: PC Download, SMS Installation, and WAP
Installation.
If you already installed the client software on your phone, click PC
Download; the installation process begins. Make sure that you
select the correct model before you download the software to your 
computer.
135
Chapter 10: Keep Me Posted: E-Mail and Instant Messaging Go Mobile

If you haven’t installed Emoze on your mobile phone yet, click either
SMS Installation or WAP Installation. If you click SMS Installation, the
site asks for your country name and your mobile phone number.
After entering that data, click Submit; you receive a message on
your mobile phone that starts the downloading process. The WAP
Installation is the same as we describe in the preceding section
about installing Emoze on your mobile phone.
Sending and receiving e-mail with Emoze
After the setup process is complete, check out a few pointers to help you
start using your e-mail on the go with Emoze:
 View your e-mail messages: Go to Messaging and click Emoze. This
action opens your inbox, where you can view all your e-mail.
 Send an e-mail message: Click New, and the New Messaging page
appears. Type in the To field the e-mail address of the person you want
to send an e-mail to. If you already stored the address in your contact
folder, just click the To field, and your contacts appear. Choose the one
you want to send an e-mail to. Type a subject in the Subject field and
then type the message. When you finish, click Send.
If you specified that Emoze should connect to the server every 15 min-
utes, you might not want to do any more. However, if you specified that
Emoze should connect to the server once a day and you want to send
the e-mail right away, go to Menu and click Send/Receive to send the
e-mail right away.
 Insert a picture: Choose Menu➪Insert➪Picture. The Picture folder opens
on your phone. Click on the picture you want to send, and click Send.
 Delete a message: Choose Menu➪Delete.
 Store a contact from e-mail: Open the e-mail and choose Menu➪Save to
Contacts. The next time you send an e-mail to the contact, click the To
field and select the person you want to send an e-mail to.
When you’re connected to a network outside your wireless carrier and you’re
paying for roaming service, disconnect your push e-mail because it can
become quite expensive to have it check for e-mail every 15 minutes. Choose
Option➪Exit. When you want to check your e-mail, just go to the Messaging
site on your phone and click Emoze. Choose Menu➪Send/Receive, and your
phone retrieves the new e-mail.

Connecting with Pull E-Mail
Many e-mail systems can provide you with pull e-mail capability. They’re
basically Web mail programs, and the most common are AOL, Gmail, Yahoo!
Mail, and Hotmail. All of them work well on your mobile phone.
You access these programs from the standard Web browser on your mobile
phone. If you’re using Web mail from your computer, these services function
more or less as you’re accustomed to on your computer. The only differences
are the smaller screen and some lack of functionality, such as not being able
to see 50 messages at a time, not being able to store e-mail in various dedi-
cated folders, and not always being able to view attachments. Otherwise, you
can easily navigate and send and view e-mail on your mobile phone.
The mobile Web sites for the most popular e-mail services are
 AOL Mail: m.webmail.aol.com
 Google Gmail: m.gmail.com
 Windows Live Mail (and MSN Hotmail): mobile.live.com
 Yahoo! Mail: m.yahoo.com/mail
AOL, Google, Yahoo!, and Microsoft also provide downloadable e-mail clients
for smartphone and PDA users. After it’s activated on your smartphone, for
example, the e-mail client provides options to pull e-mail to your mobile
phone at various times during the day. Turn off these settings if you don’t
have a flat-rate wireless data plan or when you’re roaming. Go online to the
mobile e-mail sites for each service provider for more details.
137
Chapter 10: Keep Me Posted: E-Mail and Instant Messaging Go Mobile
Yahoo! oneConnect: A one-stop mobile portal
Big service providers such as Yahoo! are now
customizing their mail systems for mobile
phones. If you’re using Yahoo! Mail on your
computer, you can download Yahoo! Go on your
mobile phone. The Yahoo! Go bundle of appli-
cations is useful while you’re on the run. It
includes applications such as photos, sports,
news, weather, finance, search, maps, and a
few others
Yahoo! is also adding Yahoo! oneConnect, a
mobile communications portal, to its offerings.
The simple oneConnect mobile Internet service
offers lots of convenience by letting you manage
e-mailing, instant messaging, text messaging,
and social networking in one place. You need
only one contact list, which makes it easier to
find friends and send messages in a variety of
formats. In addition, you can view your friends’
status updates from Facebook or any of the other
major social networking services.

Discovering Mobile Instant Messaging
Instant messaging (IM), which many people have become used to — or
almost addicted to — on the computer, offers an exciting way of communicat-
ing with friends, families, or colleagues. The advantage of IM is that you can
see which people in your private database are available and want to talk, and
you can communicate with several friends or colleagues at the same time.
IM hasn’t been available on the mobile phone until recently, but most mobile
carriers now offer mobile instant messaging. (See “Messaging with your net-
work instant messaging client,” later in this chapter.) If your carrier doesn’t
offer IM or doesn’t offer the service you want to use, you can always use a
third-party service such as Yahoo! Messenger, Google Talk, or Mundu (at
www.mundu.com). See “Opting for a third-party instant messaging service,”
later in this chapter.
Mobile IM is the next step in the evolution of text messaging, and it connects
the mobile phone and Internet worlds by bringing the convenience and
immediacy of mobility to IM services. Mobile instant messaging could, over
the next few years, become as popular as text messaging is now.
Having IM on your mobile device means that you’re no longer restricted to
the fixed Internet world and can connect to the mobile community of almost
3 billion people across all networks and geographic boundaries. And, you can
still see in real time the status of who is available.
With all these advantages, how do you get started with instant messaging?
You can start at any of these places:
 Your service provider’s (nonmobile) Web site: The first thing we advise
you to do is to go to the Web site of your current wireless carrier to
check out whether it offers mobile instant messaging. If it does, you can
easily set it up from your computer.
 Your mobile phone: If you don’t have a computer or access to a computer
from school, a public library, or an Internet café, don’t worry: We tell
you how to set up a mobile instant messaging account directly from your
mobile phone.
 Customer service: You can, of course, call your wireless carrier’s help
line and have it set up the mobile IM account and service — but you can
fairly easily set it up yourself.
Before using your mobile phone for instant messaging, determine whether
you have a subscription for accessing the mobile Internet through your wire-
less carrier. Check your mobile plan for details or call your provider.
138
Part III: Mobile Internet Mania for the Everyday Consumer 

Some extra costs might occur using the mobile instant-messaging service.
Service providers often price each message you send as a text message. But if
you have a conversation with several friends over an evening, it can easily
add up to many messages and a very high billing amount if you don’t have
the right wireless data plan.
Messaging with your network 
instant messing client
The major mobile-network service providers in the United States — Verizon,
AT&T, T-Mobile, and Sprint — all offer instant messaging services from the
well-known and popular instant messaging providers, such as AOL Instant
Messenger (AIM), MSN Windows Live Messenger, and Yahoo! Messenger.
If you don’t have an account with Yahoo! oneConnect or another network ser-
vice provider, the information we offer in the following sections can help you
get started using IM with whichever network service provider you use.
Verizon Wireless is the example we use of a mobile network service provider
that offers you mobile instant messaging. It’s set up so that you can easily use
the instant messaging account you’re already using from your computer —
whether it’s AOL Instant Messenger, MSN Windows Live Messenger, or Yahoo!
Messenger.
139
Chapter 10: Keep Me Posted: E-Mail and Instant Messaging Go Mobile
Saying “c-ya” to text messaging
Text messaging, or SMS (Short Message
Service), represents old technology. Although
useful and quite popular, it’s more like a primi-
tive form of computer-based instant messaging.
Text messaging has two main problems:
Limited characters:You have only 160 characters
(or fewer) to write your message. For a lot of
people — particularly young people — this lim-
itation is acceptable. They have learned to
deliver their messages tersely and in sometimes
cryptic, abbreviated forms. On some services
you can now go beyond 160 characters, but you
then have to pay extra to break the limit. We
must admit that it’s also cumbersome to write
long messages on the small, non–QWERTY key-
boards that most mobile phone models have.
Limited capabilities: Text messaging lacks capa-
bilities that mobile instant messaging has, such
as or confirmation about others’ availability (the
same idea as buddy lists showing who’s online).
Because text messaging is transaction based —
rather than session based — a text message
doesn’t give the sender confidence that the
receiver has gotten the messages. In mobile
instant messaging, community members know
other members’ availability, allowing for real-
time text messaging and communication.

Signing up with a mobile instant-messaging account with Verizon or any other
mobile network service providers we mention gives you some significant
advantages:
 You don’t need to abandon your existing IM account to participate in IM
from your mobile phone.
 You can transfer all your contacts from your existing IM account to the
mobile phone.
 You can synchronize messages from your computer to your mobile
phone and vice versa so that you’re always up-to-date with your chat.
 Sticking to one of the plans your wireless carrier offers most likely costs
you less because the service is included in the data package that you
already have signed up for, or your carrier may have a special package
for the use of instant messaging.
Setting up instant messaging with your network provider
The easiest way to get going with mobile instant messaging is to visit your
wireless carrier’s Web site from your computer.
To sign up for a mobile IM account, follow these steps:
1. Go to your wireless carrier’s Web site.
In this case, we chose Verizon Wireless (www.vzw.com), but all the
other network service providers have similar instructions.
2. Click the Messaging tab on the home page, and after that, click the
Mobile IM tab.
You see the Mobile IM Overview page.
3. In the Get Started section, click the Create an IM Account link.
4. When the new page opens, choose your IM service — AOL Instant
Messenger, Windows Live Messenger, or Yahoo! Messenger.
If you don’t already have an IM service, pick one and sign up.
Now you’re ready to start instant messaging.
Sending and receiving instant messages
After downloading the instant messaging software, you can log in to instant
messaging on your phone and begin messaging.
To log in, follow these steps:
1. Select the MSN icon, for example, in the middle of the screen. Then
select OK to log in.
140
Part III: Mobile Internet Mania for the Everyday Consumer 

2. Sign in with your username and password by using the keypad.
3. Select Sign On and click OK.
After you log in, your contact list appears. Now you’re ready to use
instant messaging.
To add a contact to your list, follow these steps:
1. Select the menu key in the lower-left corner. Click OK.
2. Select List Actions from the pop-up menu. Click OK.
3. Select Add Contact from the next menu. Click OK.
4. Use the keypad to enter the contact’s entire e-mail address.
5. Select Send and click OK.
When you want to send an instant message, follow these steps:
1. Select a contact from your list and click OK. Select Send and click OK.
2. Enter your message in the text window by using the keypad. Select
Send and click OK.
3. Respond to your contact by entering more text from the keypad.
The Write button changes back to Send when your new text is entered.
4. Click OK when you’re done.
Repeat these steps for as long as your conversation lasts.
You can also broadcast an IM message (you write one message and send it to
as many as five people at one time). Here are the steps to follow:
1. Select the menu key in the lower-left corner. Click OK.
2. Select Send IM To from the pop-up menu. Click OK.
3. Select Broadcast from the next menu. Click OK.
4. Select as many as five buddies to receive the broadcast message. Select
each name by highlighting it and clicking OK. When you’re finished,
click Next and click OK.
5. Enter the message you want to broadcast by using the keypad. When
you’re finished, click Send and click OK.
Your broadcast message is sent.

Chapter 10: Keep Me Posted: E-Mail and Instant Messaging Go Mobile

Opting for a third-party instant 
messaging service
If you want to use your own major instant-messaging service provider or the
one your friends are using, you can do it with no problem. Interoperability is
another reason that you might want a third-party IM service for your phone.
Services such as Yahoo! don’t tie in to whichever service your friends and
family use, and it can be hard (practically impossible, really) for everyone you
know to agree on which service to use. Some third-party clients offer an answer
to this problem: An interoperable client works with almost any of the services.
Third-party IM clients have one major problem: The price you pay for a message
is often the same as for a regular text message — around 15 cents for each
message you send, unless messaging is included as a bundle with your wireless
data plan.
In this section, we give you an example of how you can set up your Yahoo!
instant messenger service outside the service your wireless carrier offers.
Later sections also introduce you to Mundu, an interoperable client for
mobile phones.
If your provider doesn’t offer Yahoo! Messenger, you can simply browse to it
from your phone’s Web browser:
1. Type http://m.yahoo.com in your mobile phone’s Web browser
address line and choose Messenger, as shown in Figure 10-2.
2. Enter your Yahoo! ID and password (see Figure 10-3).
If you don’t have a Yahoo! ID yet, you can establish one from your com-
puter. Visit http://mobile.yahoo.com/messenger and then follow
the instructions.
Figure 10-2:

mobile front

142
Part III: Mobile Internet Mania for the Everyday Consumer 

3. Click Sign In.
You enter the Yahoo! Messenger site.
4. Start instant messaging.
If you don’t have any friends on your buddy list, click Add Friend.
Choose a friend that you know has a Yahoo! account and type that
person’s name. It appears on the buddy list with the indication “I’m
Mobile” if the person is available.
Choosing an interoperable 
instant messaging client
If your friends and colleagues use a variety of different instant-messaging ser-
vice providers and you want to chat with all of them while you’re on the go,
solutions are available. Mundu, from Geodesic Information Systems, in
Mumbai, India, has the brilliant solution Mundu Interoperable Messenger (or
just Mundu IM) for mobile devices. Users can chat with a variety of people on
the most popular IM services at the same time. You can download Mundu IM
from http://messenger.mundu.com/mobile (see Figure 10-4).
Unlike on other mobile instant messengers, where users chat on their own
services, Mundu IM users can chat and conference with their contacts from
MSN, Yahoo!, Google Talk, and AIM in a single chat session. Mundu is an
incredible time- and money-saver when you’re using limited space and band-
width, because you don’t have to think about who is on which network.
Figure 10-3:

143
Chapter 10: Keep Me Posted: E-Mail and Instant Messaging Go Mobile

Mundu IM version 4 costs $11 for lifetime use and now runs on Windows
Mobile 5.0, Palm OS 5.2, and selected models of SonyEricsson and BlackBerry
handsets. In the near future it will support a wider range of Symbian Series 60
devices, such as Nokia phones.
Installing Mundu IM
You have several ways to install Mundu IM on your phone. One method is to
download the product to your computer and, using a data cable or Bluetooth
device, transfer the file to your mobile phone.
A second method (perhaps the best one) is to download the product by using
the Web browser on your mobile phone. Go to http://messenger.mundu.
com/mobile and follow the installation steps on your phone. Mundu offers a
five-day free trial for new subscribers.
The Mundu IM takes up approximately 350K on your phone after it’s installed.
The various platforms that Mundu IM supports have different download pro-
cedures, and you have to follow the specific steps for each one.
Exploring Mundu’s features
You can do a lot of fun stuff with Mundu IM. Here are some of the key areas
where you can try:
 Multiple message services: Mundu IM supports six IM services: MSN,
Yahoo!, AIM, ICQ, Google Talk, and Jabber.
 Phone calls: You can make calls using Mundu IM during an active chat
session.
Figure 10-4:

 Conferencing: During a conference session, you can invite as many as ten
contacts on different IM services to conference into a single chat window.
 File transfers: You can transfer documents, photos, audio recordings, or
other media files from your local file or media folder on your mobile
device and share them with your buddies on any of the IM services that
Mundu supports.

Chapter 10: Keep Me Posted: E-Mail and Instant Messaging Go Mobile
Exploring other interoperable 
instant messaging clients
In addition to Mundu IM, a range of other mobile
instant messaging services is available for you
to explore. We list a few other sites you can
investigate to see whether one of them is the
mobile IM service you prefer to use.
eBuddy Mobile is a Web-based mobile IM
application that works with AIM, MSN, Yahoo!,
and Google Talk on your mobile phone without
your having to install any program or Java
applet. You can find it on http://m.
ebuddy.com.
BeeJive is the JiveTalk instant-messaging ser-
vice. Using your existing data plan, you can
simultaneously log in to the major instant-mes-
saging accounts, such as AIM, MSN, Yahoo!,
Google Talk, ICQ, Jabber, and MySpace IM.
JiveTalk currently supports the BlackBerry and
the iPhone. A version for Windows Mobile 6
should be around the corner. You can check it
out at http://beejive.com.

f you have a computer and a connection to the Internet, you probably have
bought a book from Amazon, placed a bid on an item at eBay, or downloaded
music to your Apple iPod from iTunes. Shopping online has grown like crazy in
the past five years, since people installed high-speed Internet connections and
started feeling more secure about shopping from their computers — not to men-
tion the convenience and savings! Now you can have the same experience with
your mobile phone. Many Internet shopping sites have made-for-mobile services
and Web sites developed specifically for mobile shopping.
When you shop on the mobile Internet, you can, for example,
 Order the latest Tom Clancy novel and have it shipped to your home
while you’re standing in line at the train station.
 Visit your local café, order a latte, and enjoy it while sitting in the park
and following a bidding war on eBay.
 Book a flight to Florida just as a snowstorm hits the ski slopes.
 Compare prices on the latest 52-inch LCD HDTV to see whether you should
park at the mall or just head over to the electronics store. Or, even
better, just buy your new TV from your mobile phone, have it sent to
your home, and avoid all the traffic.
This chapter helps you identify, find, and use the shopping tools available to
you on your mobile Internet–enabled phone: comparison sites, money-saving
coupons, and shopping portals.

Part III: Mobile Internet Mania for the Everyday Consumer 
Checking Prices Before Buying
Shopping with your mobile phone is much different from shopping from a
computer: Rather than spend time finding product information, you want to
spend it uncovering specific promotions or prices to use to negotiate the
best price.
You’ve had this experience: You find a great deal on a 22-inch computer LCD
monitor at your local electronics store and then wonder whether you should
buy it or check other stores. But you don’t know whether the time spent dri-
ving to the mall will get you a better deal.
You can eliminate your indecision with your mobile phone. Do your comparison
shopping and decide whether you should start bargaining with the store for a
lower price (because you see that its competitor has the same product for a lower
price) or head to another store to get the same monitor for a lower price.
In the following sections, we discuss two comparison sites: Frucall and
mShopper.
Frucall
Frucall (a combination of frugal and call) is a fast and efficient way to perform
product searches and compare prices while you’re in a store. You can use
Frucall services in one of three ways from your mobile phone:
The ongoing trend of mobile shopping
Data from the Jupiter Research Internet shop-
ping model shows that the number of U.S. online
users grew from 124.7 million, or 44 percent of
the population, in 2000, to 210.8 million, or 71
percent of the population, in 2006 — a stagger-
ing increase of 69 percent growth. Additionally,
in the same period, U.S. online retail revenue
(excluding travel, prescription drugs, and auto-
motive) grew from $24.1 billion in 2000 to $130.3
billion in 2006, or more than five times as much
shopping happening on the Internet. In other
words, U.S. customers have truly embraced
online shopping and feel quite comfortable
using their computers to shop on the Internet.
Mobile Internet shopping is next in line for con-
sumers to explore. According to a recent study
by the market research experts at Gartner
Group, consumers are prone to shop around
rather than buy from their mobile phones.
Interestingly, product price comparisons and
store searches were the two mobile Internet
shopping services most often used by mobile
phone users in the study. Mobile shopping is
expected to grow exponentially over the next
couple of years. The high growth forecast is
based on the fact that there are now more
mobile phone users than computer users.

 Over the mobile Internet
 Using text messaging services
 Making a traditional phone call
In this section, we describe how to use Frucall with the mobile Internet.
If you have a mobile Internet–enabled phone and want to check prices on a
product, you can search by bar code, brand, make, or model. Follow these
simple steps to enable Frucall services:
1. In the URL box in the Web browser on your phone, type http://frucall.
com/m.
The Frucall mobile site opens, showing a number of choices, as shown in
Figure 11-1.
2. Choose the item you want to search for and type your search criteria:
• Product search by brand/make: If you know only the product name,
you can type it into the Product field — for example, Nikon D40X.
• Product search by bar code: If you know the 12-digit universal prod-
uct code (UPC), the most common type of bar code, type it into the
Product field — for example, to find Molly Johnson’s CD messin’
around, type 602517003040.
The ISBN is the 10- or 13-digit number that uniquely identifies a book.
(This book’s ISBN, for example, is 9780470239537.) If the book has a
UPC bar code, the number at the bottom of the bar code is the same
as the 13-digit ISBN.
Figure 11-1:
Save your
dollars with
Frucall
search.
149
Chapter 11: Let’s Make a Mobile Deal: Shopping and Coupons

3. Click the search results; a list of prices, stores, and merchant ratings
appears.
For example, the lowest price for the Nikon D40X is $420.00; it’s sold by
Camera Addict and has a 4.01 merchant rating (out of 5.0). (See Figure 11-2.)
The highest price is $799.99, sold by Sixth Avenue Electronics, with a 5.0
merchant rating. In other words, the same product has a $379.99 price dif-
ference — or almost half the price between the cheapest and most expen-
sive prices. (We completed this price test in January 2008; you may see a
much different price by the time you read this chapter.)
Prices alone don’t tell the whole story. For example, for the higher price of a
digital camera, you might also receive extra accessories. Be sure to click the
store name to find out all the details before making a buying decision.
mShopper
mShopper is similar to Frucall and is easy to use. Follow these steps to com-
parison shop on mShopper:
1. Open your mobile phone browser and go to the made-for-mobile site
at www.mshopper.net.
The front page appears with the various options you have with
mShopper, as shown in Figure 11-3.
You have these options:
• PriceIt: Search for a product by brand or make and model and style.
For these steps, we choose this option.
• BrowseIt: Search for a product by category and/or merchant.

• Hot Deals: Find specific deals by the vendors associated with
mShopper.
• Get First Dibs: Receive a text message for deals that you have noti-
fied mShopper that you have interest in.
2. To search for a price by brand or make, enter the manufacturer. Go to
the Model or Style field and enter the model number. Click Next.
A list of various models appears.
3. Click the model you’re interested in.
Now you have a choice of looking at more details or getting a price.
4. To get the price, click Price It.
A new screen opens with the best price.
5. Sign up for the service.
Before you can buy from mShopper, you have to sign up for its services.
Sign-up for the service is only necessary if you buy products through
mShopper. When signing up, you have to specify your preferred shipping
address and credit card information and choose a PIN number.
6. To buy your product from mShopper, click Buy It Now! and type your
10-digit phone number. Then click Next.
You go to the pricing page, which also gives you the shipping fees and
the total costs.
7. Follow the few extra steps through the buying process and you’re done.

Saving Your Money with Mobile Coupons
Coupons have been around for centuries in some form or another: You
receive coupons in the mail, you see coupons in local newspapers, and you
may even find them online. But coupons are hard to keep track of. You have

ber to take them with you. With the new mobile Internet services coming to
market, you don’t have to remember to bring your coupons with you because
they’re right on your phone.
Cellfire has amazing offers from food to entertainment to retail shopping and
more. At Cellfire, you’re only a few key taps away from finding convenient
savings on the products you want to buy. See Figure 11-4.

Social shopping: A new trend
When you participate in social shopping, or
Shopping 2.0, you receive shopping advice from
your trusted friends online. As more and more
people shop online, this phenomenon develops
quite naturally from the old style of friends meet-
ing over a cup of coffee to discuss the shopping
experience. A range of sites is available, such as
Kaboodle, MyItThings, ProductWiki, ShopStyle,
and Zebo.
A few social shopping sites have found their
way to the mobile Internet. At Wishpot Mobile
Services (www.wishspot.com), users can
query to find the best product prices and
reviews. A user can send to a specified phone
number (the text messaging short code 699474)
a text message containing a UPC code or an
ISBN number or product name (or related key-
words) and then receive a response that
includes information about the product, includ-
ing its price and reviews.
The first time a user sends this type of text mes-
sage to the Wishpot service, she receives an
extra text message that includes information
about a temporary account created on the site.
All messages sent or received by the user are
subject to standard text messaging rates.

Finding Mobile Shopping Sites
Just like on the Internet, thousands upon thousands of made-for-mobile
storefronts exist, for purchasing products ranging from mobile content such
as ringtones to tickets for the next Toronto Blue Jays game to the plane tick-
ets to get to the stadium. It’s all on your mobile phone and available on the
mobile Internet.
In the following sections, we discuss two of these sites: AOL Shopping and
mPoria.
AOL Shopping
AOL has its own shopping site for mobile phones: AOL Shopping. You can
easily access AOL Shopping on your mobile phone. Follow these steps:
1. Access AOL Shopping by entering http://wap.aol.com/shopping in the
Web browser on your mobile phone.
2. Enter the product name or product model number in the search box.
Click Search.
Your mobile phone displays a list of products, prices, and ratings, as
shown in Figure 11-5.

Chapter 12
Mobile Access to Your Money
In This Chapter
 Performing banking tasks on your mobile phone
 Trading stocks on the mobile Internet
 Making payments by using your mobile phone
M
ost financial service providers (in a similar manner to computer Internet
services) are now looking for ways to provide consumers with ways to
use new technologies to add more “self-service” access to their accounts.
In this chapter, we show you how to get started in mobile banking and mobile
trading and in making mobile payments from your mobile phone. Now, on the
mobile Internet, you can check account balances, transfer funds, pay bills,
make trades, and more.
Mobile Banking
Imagine having an ATM in your pocket or purse: It would be kind of cool, but
bulky and quite heavy. Well, the ATM for your pocket or purse has arrived —
in the shape of your mobile phone. The phone can’t spit out money (at least
not yet), but it can make your life easier by providing access to your bank
accounts whenever you need it most — usually while you’re heading to the
mall or standing in line to make a big purchase or driving on a cross-country
family trip. Checking balances, transferring funds, and making payments has
never been more convenient.
Most major banks worldwide have made-for-mobile banking services and
Web sites offering simple services with similar functions to ATMs and Internet
banking Web sites. Here’s a list of the most common mobile banking tasks:
 Check account balances.
 View account activity and history.
 Transfer funds between eligible accounts.

158
Part III: Mobile Internet Mania for the Everyday Consumer 
 Pay bills.
 Find an ATM or branch location.
With mobile banking, you can whip out your mobile phone and go to your
bank’s made-for-mobile Web site and — poof! — like magic, your balance
appears in front of your eyes. With a few clicks on your mobile phone, you
can transfer funds from your savings account to your credit card account,
even as you stand in a checkout line. That is cool!
Signing up for an account
To be able to do your mobile banking, you must have an account at a bank
that offers mobile banking. You have two choices:
 An account at your existing bank: Visit your bank’s Internet Web site or
call to find out whether it offers mobile banking services. If it does, find
out how to get signed up, either in person at the bank or online. You may
have to sign up for Internet or telephone banking services first in order
to receive mobile service.
 An account at a new bank: If your bank doesn’t have mobile banking,
set up an account with a bank that offers that type of service. Here’s a
list of a few banks that offer mobile banking:
• Bank of America: mobilebanking.bankofamerica.com
• Citibank: www.citibank.com/domain/citimobile.htm
• SunTrust: www.suntrust.com/mobilebanking
• Wachovia: www.wachovia.com/mobilebanking
• Wells Fargo: www.wellsfargo.com/mobile
You may not want to move all your existing accounts to a new bank just
for the convenience of mobile banking, but before making that decision,
inquire about any benefits a new bank can offer you. You just may find
that switching is a good idea.
Keeping your accounts private
Mobile banking sounds cool, but how safe is it? How do you ensure that no
one swipes your banking information? Or, what happens if you lose your
phone and someone else tries to enter your bank account? All these ques-
tions are good ones, and in this section we give you some answers.

Mobile banking is safer than you might think. There have been, compared to
Internet banking, few reports of mobile banking fraud. Here’s why:
 Your mobile phone browser limits what you can store on your mobile
phone. You can’t keep much information on it, and if you lose your phone,
no one can get to your information.
 You must enter a username and a password or PIN number every time
you access your mobile account. Unlike an Internet browser that “help-
fully” remembers your username and password, which anyone can get
to, mobile banking sites have an added layer of security.
 All information sent between the mobile phone and the bank has 128-
bit encryption (the most secure kind) to prevent anyone from snooping
on it. As with any online transaction, encryption protects the information
transferred over the mobile Internet to keep all your transactions away
from unwanted eyes viewing any part of it.
If you feel secure about banking online from your computer over the Internet,
mobile banking should make you feel right at home (so to speak). For more
information on mobile-banking security, visit your bank’s Internet site or ask
your teller about it the next time you visit your local branch.
Getting started
You can get started quite easily after you register for your bank’s made-for-
mobile services. Most major banks make their services available on wireless-
carrier mobile portals and also off-portal (as separate Web sites) so that you
have access from your phone at all times. Check with your wireless carrier
and with your bank to find the best way to access its mobile-banking ser-
vices. (Your bank may also have guides and online resources to help you find
its mobile banking services on your phone.)
Mobile Trading
Time is money, especially in the area of finding stock quotes and trading in
the stock market. If you have stocks or shares in a publicly traded company
and the symbols NYSE and NASDAQ mean something to you, this section is
for you.
Whether you call it mobile trading, mobile stock trading, or mobile brokerage
services, we call them all mobile trading in this chapter. Mobile trading was
one of the first made-for-mobile consumer applications that made good sense
(or cents) for everyone involved. It started in the 1990s as a service that sent
simple stock quote alerts and notifications to alphanumeric pagers and grew
159
Chapter 12: Mobile Access to Your Money

to become a full-blown, two-way service that sends stock quote alerts and
updates with immediate stock trading from wireless Internet PDAs and two-
way pagers.
Stock trading companies and financial services providers such as Charles
Schwab, TD Ameritrade, and E*Trade have been jumping through hoops to
help their customers obtain instant access to stock market information in
order to better service this time-sensitive, money-sensitive marketplace.
Timing is everything in the stock market! And, there’s no better mechanism
to deliver time- and money-sensitive services than the mobile Internet.
160
Part III: Mobile Internet Mania for the Everyday Consumer 
Text-messaging my banker is 
better than any American Idol
Mobile browsing isn’t the only way to keep your
bank information updated while you’re on the
go. Text messaging (or SMS) banking services
have been around since the 1990s. Almost all
banks that offer made-for-mobile Web site
banking services have text messaging services;
some banks that don’t yet have mobile brows-
ing sites already have SMS banking services.
If you don’t have mobile Web browsing capabil-
ities or just don’t want to launch your browser
while standing in line at the store, you can get
access to your account balances with a simple
text messaging note sent to your bank. Chase
Mobile (http://chase.com/mobile) is
an excellent example of how SMS banking ser-
vices can help you out anywhere and at any time
on your mobile phone. Call your bank or go online
to find out which mobile banking services it has.

Starting out with mobile trading services
To receive mobile trading services, you need an account with an industry-
accredited financial services provider that provides stock market trading,
such as Charles Schwab, TD Ameritrade, or E*Trade.
Some banks also offer mobile trading services in addition to mobile banking
services. To obtain access to mobile trading provided by your financial ser-
vices provider, you may have to sign up for its Internet or telephone trading
services. Check with your vendor directly to determine which services it
offers and to find out what you must do to sign up for mobile trading. 
The made-for-mobile Web sites at the following companies provide mobile
trading services; to access one, open your mobile phone browser and enter
its made-for-mobile Web site address:
 Charles Schwab: http://pb.schwab.com (shown in Figure 12-1)
 E-Trade: http://wireless.etrade.com or http://etrade.mobi
 TD Ameritrade: www.amtdw.com/
Only industry accredited and federally licensed financial services providers
can legally offer stock trading transactions on your personal accounts.

Chapter 12: Mobile Access to Your Money

Receiving stock quotes 
directly on your phone
In addition to receiving stock market info from your mobile trading service,
you can get stock quote information from news and information providers
such as Bloomberg, BusinessWeek, CNN, and thousands of other information
portal Web sites (and mobile Web sites). Go online from your computer to
your preferred information sources and look for their mobile or wireless
offerings.
Examples of made-for-mobile Web sites that feature stock market information
are shown in this list:
 BusinessWeek: http://businessweek.mobi
 CNNMoney: http://cnnmoney.mobi (shown in Figure 12-2)
 Quote.com: http://quote.mobi
To access a mobile stock market service listed here, open your mobile phone
browser and enter its made-for-mobile Web site address.
Many financial news services also offer text messaging alert services; simply
go online to your favorite financial news and stock market quote site, look for
a mobile alert program, and have the latest stock market updates delivered
directly to your phone.

Making Mobile Payments
The mobile Internet brings a new way to think about your money. From
mobile banking to mobile trading, financial services providers have offered
new, innovative services to increase convenience and access to information
for their customers.
One more convenience is mobile payments (or mobile commerce or m-
commerce). Mobile payment is the next frontier for most retailers and finan-
cial services providers to give consumers more convenient ways to shop.
Basically, it means providing mobile phone access to money tied to your
bank with a cash account or credit card that you can spend online or at any
retail store. You don’t need to carry a wallet or a set of credit cards — you
just need to carry your mobile phone. (Or is it your wireless wallet?)
You can sign up to make payments at a mobile-payment company or at
another service that your carrier provides.
Signing up with a third-party company
You can make a mobile payment by adding a product or service charge to
your mobile phone bill or by using a mobile-payments provider. Quite a few
mobile-payment companies, options, and services are now on the market.
Here are two:
 PayPal is an industry leader in e-commerce, and it has also taken the
lead in m-commerce. Go online with your computer Internet connection
to see PayPal offers at www.paypal.com for both merchants and con-
sumers (see Figure 12-3). Search the site for Mobile and find more ways
to spend your money than you ever thought possible. The mobile site is
at http://mobile.paypal.com/shop.
 At Obopay, a new entrant in the mobile money space, you can use text
messaging or mobile Web browsing or even download a made-for-mobile
application to pay for purchases or send money to friends without dealing
with an IOU. Check out Obopay at www.obopay.com (see Figure 12-4).
163
Chapter 12: Mobile Access to Your Money

Checking with your wireless carrier
Some wireless carriers accept payments on behalf of merchants for products
or services that are added to your monthly bill; products and services range
from movie tickets to digital content. Almost all wireless carriers in the
United States and Canada have mobile payment services available for these
micropayments (usually less than $20). The wireless carrier sets a predeter-
mined limit on the maximum amount you can charge to your mobile phone
bill at one time or per month.

The United Kingdom (UK) is leading the pack with the new service PayForIt.
Users can charge non-mobile-related products and services to their mobile
phone bills. See details at www.payforituk.com.
In Canada, the wireless carrier Bell Mobility has teamed up with Cineplex-Odeon
movie theaters to let you buy movie tickets on your mobile phone and have
the charge billed to the monthly statement from your wireless carrier. Or, you
can send charges to your personal PayPal account — all with an additional
service fee for the convenience, of course.

Chapter 12: Mobile Access to Your Money
Coming soon: NFC and wireless wallets
Wireless wallets — having your mobile phone
replace your wallet to access your money —
are here to stay, thanks to the tiny innovation
Near Field Communications (NFC).
Near Field Communications (NFC) is a short-
range wireless connectivity technology, which
enables a mobile phone that has a unique chip
built into it, such as an RFID tag, to be used like
a credit card or key fob to make product and
service payments.
Here are a couple of cool examples of how
mobile NFC phones, or wireless wallets, are
coming to market:
In San Francisco, Sprint and Boost Mobile are
working with the Bay Area Rapid Transit authority
(BART) to promote the made-for-mobile payments
through a specially programmed mobile phone and
touchless payment receiver to purchase items as
diverse as train tickets and cheeseburgers. Other
companies included in the program are Jack in the
Box restaurants, Western Union, and First Data
Corporation. For more information about this trial
program, check out http://labs.sprint.
com/intro/mobiletransit. (Also check
out the San Francisco BART mobile Web site at
http://bart.mobi.)
In New York City, Atlanta, Spokane, and many
more cities across the United States,
MasterCard has been rolling out programs with
AT&T (formerly Cingular) and Nokia mobile NFC
phones to transact payment services for almost
any product and service where the MasterCard
PayPass service is accepted. For more infor-
mation about the MasterCard PayPass mobile
program, check out www.mastercard.
com/paypass; for an overview of the 2007
New York City mobile program trial, visit
www.mastercard.com/us/paypass/

Visa has also jumped into the mobile payments
NFC world with its PayWave platform. Most of
its initial programs are running well in Asia 
and will be coming to North America very soon.

World Wide Web has to offer, and you can produce and publish information,
digital images, videos, music, and sounds for the world to see. These days,
the Internet is full of opportunities to create content, and the mobile Internet
is no exception.
In this chapter, we guide you through some of the ins and outs of creating
new products and services of your own on the mobile Internet. This chapter
helps you get a basic understanding of what you want to do, whether for fun
or professionally. The remaining chapters in Part IV go into more detail on
how to make it all happen.
For now, just sit back and take out your Post-it Notes and highlighters.
Expressing Yourself with 
Your Own Content
Content, for the purposes of this book, is anything you might create using dig-
ital tools, services, and technologies. You might hear people talk about user-
generated content. This term generally refers to content created by you, the
average Joe or Jane Internet user, versus some major media publisher, profes-
sional artist, or music producer. A piece of content can be anything from a

sentence or paragraph of text you wrote to a photo taken with your digital
camera or camera phone or a video clip you created.
If you’re an Internet user, you may be creating content already. If you have
ever posted a review of a product to an online shopping site such as Amazon
or eBay, you created your own content that is now part of the Web for every-
one to see. If you went one step further and built your own page on MySpace
or Facebook or another similar site, you know something about the benefits
of generating and maintaining your own space on the Internet. If you’re an
avid photographer, you might already be using a photo-sharing site such as
Flickr to share your images with friends and relatives.
Now imagine taking those benefits with you wherever you go. You can not
only check in on your friends’ Internet Web pages and photos or check the
latest from your favorite blogs, but more importantly, you can also create
content directly on your mobile phone and share it over the mobile Internet
from wherever you are. You can create content on both a computer and a
mobile phone. You can also consume content on both a computer and a
mobile phone. The best types of Internet services allow you to create and
consume content on both. When you’re creating content on your phone for
your friends, family, and even people you don’t know for them to view, down-
load, and enjoy from their mobile phones, you’re really living the dream of
the mobile Internet.
Working at the Point of Inspiration
Did you ever find yourself during the course of your normal day (say waiting
for a train) having an idea and thinking to yourself “I’d better remember that
for later?” but invariably being unable to remember it later? These kinds of
inspiring moments happen throughout the day, but we are often unable to act
on them.
With an Internet-connected mobile phone, you can create content at this
point of inspiration and share that inspiration with others. You can take a pic-
ture and immediately share it with friends and family on a photo-sharing Web
site, for example. Or, you can write a blog entry while you’re standing at a
political rally and immediately share your thoughts with the world. You can
send an instant message to a group of friends and receive an immediate
response, no matter where you or they are.
E-mail was the first indispensable application of the Internet. These days,
nearly everyone is familiar with e-mail addresses and how to use them. But
for all its success, e-mail is just taking something physical — sending a real-
world letter — and re-creating it in the digital medium. Communication on
the Internet has moved beyond e-mail in both its sophistication and the
potential size of the audience.

Modern Internet services include blogging, photo sharing, podcasting, and
video sharing. New messaging categories are fast evolving, including myriad
ways that users can interact over popular social networking sites (for exam-
ple, writing on someone’s Wall in Facebook) and one-to-many messaging ser-
vices, such as Twitter and Jaiku.
One-to-many messaging services like these have been growing in popularity
in the last few years. They essentially combine elements of instant messaging
and chat (like MSN Messenger and AIM) with blogging to produce a new kind
of medium — a medium that has a distinctly mobile flair. The types of mes-
sages published on these services often are about “what I’m doing right now”
such as “about to board a flight to Hong Kong” or “just saw the new Bond
movie.” Like blogging, it’s a way to express yourself in a public forum. Like
chat, users can respond in real time and generate conversation. The term
microblogging has also been used to describe these services.
Deciding Which Mobile Phone to Use
It might go without saying, but if you intend to do photo- or videoblogging
from your phone, make sure to buy a mobile phone with a good embedded
camera! Not all camera phones are created equal: In fact, you have to choose
from a wide range of quality when you select a camera phone. Just looking at
the megapixel count doesn’t tell the whole story. For example, look for
phones that have a real glass lens. Nokia Nseries phones usually provide
171
Chapter 13: Staking Your Claim in the Mobile Internet World
Public is the new private
Before you put information about yourself on
the Web, ask yourself what level of information
you’re comfortable putting in the public record.
If a prospective future employer (or a future sig-
nificant other) types your name into a search
engine, what will that person find, and will the
information show you in the best light? Many
Web sites for uploading or sharing content
allow you to set permissions for this content —
that is, who can see it and who can’t. On Jaiku,
for example, you can set your permissions so
that only your contacts can view your Jaiku
messages. On Flickr, you can set permissions on
a per-photo basis to control who gets to see that
photo: everyone, friends and family, just friends,
just family, or only yourself. For example, if
you’re posting photos of your kids, you may
want to set permissions so that only friends and
family can see them. Some photo upload tools
allow for manipulation of these permission
levels. Facebook also allows for the sophisti-
cated use of permissions to ensure that the right
people are seeing the right information. Figure
out how to use these permissions before you
start uploading and updating willy-nilly.
Facebook and Flickr are two services that give
users detailed control over privacy settings for
posted items. As of this writing, these controls
are available only from the Web site — not the
mobile Web site, however.

high-quality images and videos. Some Sony Ericsson phone models are pre-
loaded with a photo-sharing or photo-blogging application. We tell you more
about that topic in Chapter 14.
Smartphones allow you to download and install applications on them; models
such as Apple iPhone, Palm OS Treo, RIM BlackBerry, Sony Ericsson,
Windows Mobile, and Nokia Nseries phones are particularly good choices for
podcasting. Phones that can connect over a WiFi network (such as you might
have in your home or find in many cafés, hotels, or other public buildings) as
well as a cellular network are also particularly good choices for podcasting
and photo uploading because these tasks often require the ability to send a
lot of data from the device to the Internet. Even fast cellular networks still
offer comparatively slow upload speed compared to WiFi.
You have many ways to create content on the mobile Internet. Some of these
methods involve downloaded applications that you need to install on your
phone. Some of these methods can be accomplished by using existing pre-
loaded applications or within the phone’s Web browser. You need to be aware
of whether your phone supports downloadable applications and/or what
applications for content creation come preloaded.
Consider a smartphone the mobile phone equivalent of a server. Like a
server, the mobile phone is robust and capable of multitasking and operating
a whole bunch of applications and services at the same time. If you’re truly
serious about your mobile Internet freedom, get a smartphone.
For a summary of all your mobile phone options, read Chapters 4 and 5 for
more details and an overview of the services offered by the wireless carriers.
We strongly advise that you read your mobile Internet service data plan
before treading into using your mobile phone for creating, producing, and
delivering any of the services we highlight in this part of the book. Make sure
that you have a plan with unlimited data services, if possible. If you don’t,
publishing your work from your mobile phone can be expensive.
Deciding What You Want to 
Do with the Mobile Internet
To get the most out of the next few chapters, think about what you want to
do on the mobile Internet, why you want to do it, and how you want to do it.
Here are some points to consider:
 Do you simply want to make yourself heard?
 Do you want to share your experiences with your friends, family mem-
bers, and loved ones?
172
Part IV: I Want My Own Mobile Internet Space 

 Do you want to keep a connection to social groups?
 Do you want to showcase your own products or services?
 Do you want to do a little bit of everything available on the mobile
Internet, to keep up with the rest of the mobile Joneses?
To get a better understanding of what your needs and wants are, read
through the next few sections.
Web site designers and developers
Since the launch of the Internet, the Web has become a multi-billion-dollar
business for designers, developers, and technology providers. You see refer-
ences everywhere to Web site domains such as .com, .net, .org, and .biz.
The next wave of opportunity is delivering made-for-mobile Web sites and
services to the billions of mass-market mobile Internet users. Whether you
have secured an excellent .mobi mobile Internet domain name (like Tim
McGraw, the country music legend, did at mcgraw2go.mobi) or are using a
mobile-Internet-friendly name for your old site (like m.facebook.com for
Facebook), serving up the mobile Web is about as easy as it gets.
173
Chapter 13: Staking Your Claim in the Mobile Internet World
Special offers from your wireless carriers
Many cellular carriers (mobile network opera-
tors) are offering special package deals for
access to a particular social network or service
for a flat rate. Although these offers may seem
to be a good deal, you should scrutinize what
you’re getting. Can you really get the same ser-
vice without paying the extra monthly rate? If
you have a good Internet price plan, the answer
is probably yes.
However, examine the fine print closely. Some
special offers include perks such as unlimited
photo uploading (although this may be tied to
using one specific upload application). If you
have an Internet price plan that includes a cap
on bandwidth usage per month and you think
you might end up overextending that bandwidth
by uploading camera phone images to your
favorite social network, going with a special
offer from your operator may make sense if it
means that the bandwidth used in accessing
that specific network doesn’t count against your
regular monthly usage.
The most Internet-friendly mobile phone rate
plans offer unlimited data usage with high
usage caps. Why do you need unlimited data
usage? Because when you’re using the Internet
on your phone, you don’t want to be continually
thinking, “What is this costing me?” The rate
plans offered with the Apple iPhone are good
examples of plans that offer unlimited data
usage.

However, you have to make sure that your mobile Web site works well on all
mobile phones (not just the iPhone, the BlackBerry, and other smartphones):
If the site doesn’t work well on all phones, you will miss out on more than 200
million potential American users who are trying to find you.
With the launch of the iPhone, Apple has revolutionized the way people think
about the mobile Internet. As of this writing, the Apple iPhone is (with a few
key caveats) the most impressive Internet-connected mobile phone on the
market. Immediately after the iPhone launch, many Web enthusiasts began
writing content exclusively for the iPhone’s Web browser.
Apple has encouraged this practice by publishing content developer guide-
lines for the iPhone. Content creators must understand, however, that many
people out there who have other Internet-capable handsets can also benefit
from their content or service. A word to the wise: Read Chapter 15 (and the
rest of Part IV) before jumping to iPhone conclusions. You should develop
your mobile Internet Web sites and services with the goal of satisfying as
many of the billions of users as possible rather than a couple of million.
Social networkers
If you’re a regular user of a social networking site, such as MySpace,
Facebook, Bebo, or Piczo, you probably understand the need to update your
Internet presence throughout the day, upload camera phone images, and
share your thoughts about what you’re doing right now with either your
group of friends or with the world at large.
To get set up on your mobile phone, check with your current social network-
ing provider. Almost all social networking providers have made-for-mobile
service offerings: text messaging, mobile Web, and even downloadable appli-
cations for your smartphone to get your updates and digital images uploaded
to your network.
If you’re a social networker, another great place for you to start is with your
wireless carrier. Facebook, MySpace, and other top social networking ser-
vices have cut deals with the wireless carriers to make creating, developing,
and updating your social status quite easy. Chapter 14 goes into more detail
on mobile social networking services and how to use them to your advantage
on the mobile Internet.
Shutterbugs
What good are all those pictures you’re taking with your camera phone if
nobody ever sees them? These days, millions of users are uploading images
from their digital cameras or camera phones to photo-sharing Web sites,
174
Part IV: I Want My Own Mobile Internet Space 

where they can be viewed by others who often leave comments and start
online conversations.
Mobile photo sharing allows you to go one step further: Upload camera
phone images as you take them to create a real-time photo feed, provided by
either your wireless carrier or independent vendors. It’s the difference, for
example, between sharing images with friends or family while on vacation to
create real-time postcards of where you are and what you’re doing versus
showing photos when you get back from the trip.
Wireless carriers offering camera phones have some of the best services to
upload and share your mobile digital imagery. To find out more about which
picture uploading and sharing services your wireless carrier has to offer for
your camera phone, check out your carrier’s Web site or visit your local
retailer.
If you want to check out third-party solutions other than what your wireless
carrier has to offer, go to your favorite Internet provider’s Web site to see
whether it has a mobile phone offering. Flickr, Picasa, and Webshots all have
mobile Internet offerings:

Children and social networks
These days, children as young as six are spend-
ing a lot of time on social networks. There’s
nothing necessarily alarming about this — chil-
dren and adults alike treat social networking
services as a way to keep in touch and hang out
with their peers. In much the same way as par-
ents need to monitor their children’s television
viewing, however, parents also need to be
aware of their children’s Internet usage and
help give them the information and tools they
need to stay out of harm’s way online. This
statement is especially important when these
social networks are accessed from mobile
devices because this access is often outside
the home and less subject to parental scrutiny.
There’s no need to panic, though: A few words
in your teen or pre-teen’s ear should help the
situation enormously. In general, common
sense rules like “don’t talk to strangers” and
especially “don’t share personal information
with people you don’t know” are a good place
to start.
The United Kingdom Government’s “Home
Office” department has produced a document
called “Good Practice Guidance for Social
Networking and User Interactive Services.”
This document is packed with good advice for
parents. It’s available at
http://police.homeoffice.gov.uk/
publications/operational-
policing/social-networking-
guidance?view=Binary
Note: Although compiled by a UK government
task force, this document provides good guid-
ance that is broadly applicable no matter what
country you live in.

Webshots has a helpful resource table to show you what can be done on your
mobile phone with its service offering.
Musicians and artists
Think about how powerful the Internet has been as a medium for you to share
your works of art. It’s quite the power shift when you can display your work
over the Internet rather than try to get “discovered” through the ever-elusive,
greedy showbiz agent network, isn’t it? With just a computer, an Internet con-
nection, and a few friends knowing how to set you up, you can now strut your
stuff to the whole world. Now imagine being able to share your digital artistry
with more than 3 billion mobile phone users worldwide — very cool.
Imagine charging anywhere from a dime to a couple of bucks every time a
user downloads your work to his mobile phone. That’s not only very cool,
but it can also get you out of that boring day job if you know how to tap into
the mobile Internet marketplace. Rather than let your friends download old
Ricky Martin ringtones, why not have them download your latest soon-to-be
hit? You can publish your own made-for-mobile content with mobile Internet
marketplace vendors and start making money from your content.
Mobile Internet marketplace sites on the Internet are available at
 Bango: www.bango.com
 ooober: ooober.mobi
Bloggers
Blogs (short for Weblogs) have become a cornerstone of the Internet and the
Web. Anyone can use a blog to share his thoughts, expertise, insight, or just
rants on any subject with a potentially global audience.
So what’s different about mobile blogging versus plain old blogging at your
computer? Mobile blogging puts that power into the palm of your hand,
allowing you to update your blog from wherever you are. You can upload
camera phone images and include them in your blog entries and broadcast
your inspiration as it occurs. True, you can blog remotely using a laptop, but
176
Part IV: I Want My Own Mobile Internet Space 

can you capture your life thoughts while walking through a crowded airport
terminal or walking the streets of an exotic city? Can you jot down a particu-
larly good quote while at a party and broadcast it immediately to the world?
Mobile blogging gives you this power. Put mobile blogging together with the
ability to take and send pictures, and you can become an online photojour-
nalist without ever touching a computer.
Most of the major Internet blogging services have mobile versions:
 Microsoft Windows Live Spaces: mobile.spaces.live.com
 Blogger: www.blogger.com/mobile-start.g
 Typepad: www.typepad.com/mobile/
Podcasters
The stereotype of a podcast is that it’s created by people sitting in dark, win-
dowless rooms, in front of computers. It’s much more exciting to take your
podcasting skills on the road, creating and editing video or audio snippets on
your mobile phone and sharing them with your podcast community. Be
aware, however, that mobile podcasting is available only on mobile phones
that support traditional podcast file formats (MP3, MOV, WAV, and others).
The mobile Internet can bring podcasting into previously uncharted terri-
tory: real-time, right-now podcasting — live. Given that, you should keep in
mind some best practices for mobile podcasting that can keep you on the
straight and narrow.
If you’re going to use podcasting tools (especially photo or video capture),
make sure to get permission from your subjects before you turn the camera
on them. People value their privacy and don’t like it invaded by being pho-
tographed if they haven’t first granted permission. Also, it’s always a good
idea to make sure that you have permission to use any material you’re incor-
porating, such as background audio or photos, or that this material has been
explicitly licensed for public use.
Creative Commons, an organization that promotes freely redistributable con-
tent and develops licenses and guidance for content creators, provides a
helpful legal guide for podcasters, which contains some information espe-
cially relevant to mobile podcasters. See the section “Interviewing Someone
or Asking Someone to Join You in Conversation As Part of Your Podcast” on
the Creative Commons Web site for some good guidelines. Interviews often
result in uncomfortable misunderstandings if they’re not handled properly.
Check it out at http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Podcasting_
Legal_Guide.

Chapter 13: Staking Your Claim in the Mobile Internet World

Here are some useful Web sites for more information about mobile podcasting:
 Voice Indigo: www.voiceindigo.com
 Tribal Shout: www.tribalshout.com
Entrepreneurs and corporate go-getters
As an entrepreneur, you can create and update information about your busi-
ness or venture, maintain your network, and be continually informed of
what’s going on in your peer group. You can take advantage of mobile Web
site services, social networking, and blogging tools, as well as make informa-
tion on your business available to billions of mobile Internet users.
Any of these mobile Internet services and applications can easily be com-
bined to make your day-to-day life on the job easier. Before you get any new
great ideas, however, check with your resident IT managers or webmasters:
They probably know which types of services work well within your Internet
and intranet capabilities.
Also, you need their input to make sure that you’re not breaking any 
company-information security rules or policies.
178
Part IV: I Want My Own Mobile Internet Space 
Political activism by way of your mobile phone
Because of its egalitarian nature (anyone con-
nected to the Internet can, under most circum-
stances, access any Web site), the Internet can
be a useful tool for grassroots organization and
activism. Indeed, smart use of the Internet has
been crucial to some political candidates’ for-
tunes and to the success of other grassroots or
even underground movements.
More recently, the mobile phone, with its ability
to take pictures and capture information in the
moment, has begun to play an important role as
well. For example, in 1997, camera phone
images and video of the brutal repression of
protestors in Burma were a crucial factor in
generating international awareness of the situ-
ation there. It’s quite a powerful tool if you think
about having everyone with a mobile phone
being empowered to share their side of the
story, isn’t it?
Closer to home, the tools of a mobile blogger or
podcaster can be used for citizen journalism.
You can organize or stay informed of rallies or
other events from wherever you are. Blogging
and photo blogging can be some of the simplest
mechanisms for putting out a message.
Mobileactive (www.mobileactive.org)
provides resources and data and a community
for people using the mobile phone and the
mobile Internet as a political action tool. They
write and maintain strategy guides for people
running campaigns or engaged in activism on
how to best make use of mobile technology.

S
o you’re ready to serve up your digital content — text, audio, and visual —
to the rest of us in the mobile Internet world. How do you do it? In this
chapter, we show you a few ways to find out for yourself.
To help you through the maze of mobile Internet third-party application provider
offerings, we review the features that some of the best made-for-mobile service
delivery companies have to offer. Each company has its own area of expertise
related to helping you make your way through all the complexities of getting on
the mobile Internet, independent of a wireless carrier or mobile device. This
list describes some of these service-delivery companies:
 Web site designer and developers: Provide new ideas on how to extend
the reach of your Internet Web sites.
 Social networkers: Keep everyone posted on your every move from
wherever you are.
 Camera phone shutterbugs: Experience picture sharing at its best —
live, in color, and in real time.
 Musicians and artists: Make some money by selling your own ringtones
and images.

 Bloggers: Participate in anywhere-anytime journalism delivered to any
device you want.
 Podcasters: Capture the event and deliver it to your audience right away.
We strongly advise that you read your mobile Internet service data plan
before using your mobile phone for creating, producing, or delivering any of
the services we highlight in this part of the book. Make sure that you have a
plan with unlimited data services, if possible. If you don’t, publishing your
work from your mobile phone can be quite expensive.
Chapter 13 covers some reasons that you might want to create content on
your phone. In this chapter, we get into some specific ideas, or scenarios, for
content creation. We also show you some of the innovative products that can
help you get out there and get read, heard, and seen on the mobile Internet.
Social Networking
Say that you want to communicate with multiple people at one time (sometimes
called one-to-many messaging). For example, you’re at a concert with a group
of friends and you want to keep in touch with all of them during the show.

Mobile phone operating system software overview
Mobile phones today are very much the mini-
computer of tomorrow. Some of the most popu-
lar phone vendor interfaces and operating
environments are listed in this sidebar. Each
vendor has useful resources and developer
communities with detailed information about
each mobile phone operating environment as
well as how you can sign up for its developer
program.
The Series-60 (S60) smartphone operating
system and user interface layer is based on the
Symbian core operating system and licensed by
Nokia, LG, and other companies. A full list of S60
smartphones can be found at http://www.

You may want to be able to update the page of your favorite social networking
site (such as MySpace, Bebo, or Facebook ) with a description of whatever
you’re doing as you’re doing it. Many social networking Web sites provide special
versions of their sites for mobile phone browsers.
Mobile Internet Web sites for social networking are available right on your
mobile phone browser. A few of the most popular made-for-mobile social net-
working sites ready to use on your phone are shown in this list:
 Facebook: m.facebook.com
 MySpace: m.myspace.com
 Twitter: m.twitter.com
 Jaiku: m.jaiku.com
 Bebo: m.bebo.com
To access these mobile social networking services on your mobile phone,
follow these steps:
1. Open your mobile phone browser.
2. Enter the made-for-mobile URL.
For example, for Facebook, you enter m.facebook.com.
3. Press Enter.
Twitter
You can use Twitter to communicate your activities with multiple friends and
receive messages back from them. Visit the Twitter Web site at www.twitter.
com on your computer (to sign up) and at m.twitter.com from your mobile
browser. At Twitter, you can also set up message notifications by text mes-
sage (SMS).
If you have an iPhone, you have access to a number of Web applications that
provide easy-to-use interfaces for Twitter. Each of these provides a different
look and feel and provides access to different functions that go above and
beyond the m.twitter.com mobile site. Just visit one of these, plug in your
Twitter username and password (you must already be registered with
Twitter), and you’re good to go. Hahlo (at www.hahlo.com) is a particularly
good Twitter client; find a full list of iPhone Web applications such as this at
www.apple.com/webapps. You can also use some of these clients on other
advanced mobile phone models, such as the Nokia Nseries.

Jaiku
You can use the Jaiku service, (now a part of Google) to share your location
with friends you choose to be connected to and to read your friends’ messages
and see their locations. Jaiku works across mobile phones and computers alike.
If you have a Nokia Nseries phone (such as Nokia N73 or Nokia N95), the best
way to use Jaiku is by downloading and installing Jaiku’s dedicated applica-
tion on your phone. This allows you to integrate Jaiku into your phone’s
address book so you can better keep up with what your friends are saying.
Visit www.jaiku.com from a computer for instructions on how to download
and install the Jaiku application and view a list of compatible phones.
Jaiku also has a mobile Web site at m.jaiku.com that works well on most
mobile browsers, as shown in Figure 14-1.
Facebook and MySpace
With Facebook at m.facebook.com, shown in Figure 14-2, you can accomplish
most of the usual functions as you can on Web site, including sending and
receiving messages, writing on “walls,” and sending RSVPs for upcoming events.

Facebook goes one step further with the iPhone, by providing a full site in the
iPhone look and feel at iphone.facebook.com. Facebook also uses the
advanced capabilities of the iPhone browser to make the application feel like
part of the phone, as shown in Figure 14-3.

MySpace provides basic functionality at mobile.myspace.com (shown in
Figure 14-4), which allows you to see messages and update your status
online. The mobile site has none of the possibilities for design, um, creativity,
that the Web site has, but at least it’s a start.
Bebo and Mippin
A full-featured mobile version of Bebo is available at m.bebo.com, as shown 
in Figure 14-5. Bebo also has some sophisticated features for text messaging
(SMS) and picture messaging (MMS). Bebo shows its European roots by
enabling these features for not just U.S. operators but also European operators.
At Mippin (mippin.com), users can subscribe to feeds from commercial sources
or from their favorite blogs and then read these news sources in a mobile
phone’s browser by using a simple user interface, as shown in Figure 14-6.
Users can also share their favorite blog posts or other content with friends
by using Twitter or Facebook or by using good old-fashioned text messaging
or e-mail.

status, it shows up in your minifeed (the running
log of all your activities and actions on
Facebook), so your friends on Facebook are
automatically notified. You can easily update
your status at the Facebook mobile site
(m.facebook.com) or at its iPhone-specific
site (iphone.facebook.com, shown in the
following figure).
You can also integrate your Twitter (http://
apps.facebook.com/twitter/) or Jaiku
(http://apps.facebook.com/jaiku
book/) feeds into Facebook to create the
same effect.

Sharing Photos on the Fly
Say that you’re taking a trip and you want friends and family members to be
able to keep up with you as you travel. Or, maybe you’re a photojournalist
who wants to start taking pictures and make them available on a photo-
sharing site as you take them.
Web sites such as Flickr have popularized the concept of photo sharing:
uploading digital photos to the Web so that others can view them. Many Web
photo-sharing services also allow for mobile Web access. One benefit of shar-
ing photos while you’re on the go is that you can share them with your family
and friends as “instant postcards” during a trip.
Depending on the photo sharing site you use (such as Flickr), friends can
follow your exploits on their own mobile phones or by subscribing to RSS
feeds of your photos.
To access Flickr mobile Internet services (as shown in Figure 14-7) on your
mobile phone, follow these steps:
1. Open your mobile phone browser.
2. Enter the Flickr mobile URL, m.flickr.com.
3. Press Enter.
Flickr itself allows for photo uploads directly from supported mobile
browsers. From m.flickr.com, select Upload. Then navigate through the
file system on your phone to the photo you want to upload. (Your photo must
already be saved to the phone’s memory card or internal memory.) You can
then upload the photo and name it in the same way you would on the com-
puter version of the Flickr Web site.
If you own certain models of the Nokia phone (specifically, the N73 and N95
models, as of this writing), you can take advantage of a built-in method for
posting photos to Flickr. Download the Nokia Share Online application from
Nokia Beta Labs at www.nokia.com/betalabs/shareonline, shown in
Figure 14-8.
The benefit of using the Nokia application is that is offers seamless integra-
tion into the camera phone’s operating system: Sending a photo to Flickr is as
easy as sending a picture message. The disadvantage is that this application
works with only certain Nokia phone models and works only with Flickr.
However, this process of uploading can be laborious. The best way to upload
photos from your phone is to download and install a special application for
this purpose. Many of these applications exist — you just need to know
where to look for them and how to download and install them.

For example, if you’re traveling, you may want to keep in touch with friends
and family by taking camera phone images and sharing them through a photo
sharing site.
ShoZu is a popular and slick photo-upload application that makes it easy.
This downloadable application, which is compatible with many phone types,
allows for seamless photo (and video) uploads to many photo-sharing Web
sites, including Flickr, Facebook, YouTube, and Picasa; blogging services,

such as Blogger, Vox, and LiveJournal; and many other services. ShoZu
clearly has an advantage in terms of the number of services supported and
the number of phone models supported, including Motorola, Nokia, and Sony
Ericsson, and Palm smartphones.
Go to www.shozu.com on your computer or to m.shozu.com on your
mobile browser to sign up for the ShoZu service and download the ShoZu
application to your phone.
If you want to take it up a notch and send virtual video postcards, you can
use Kyte to capture on-the-spot reporting, as shown in Figure 14-9.

ZoneTagging it
Although ZoneTag is only a research prototype,
and supports only Flickr, it’s arguably one of the
coolest ways to upload photos. In addition to let-
ting you upload and tag your photos, ZoneTag
attempts to automatically geotag your photos by
using the global positioning system (GPS) function
on your mobile handset or by taking an educated
guess at your location if your phone doesn’t
have GPS.
When you geotag your photos in this way, you
can then view them on a map. The map feature in
Flickr, for example, shows clusters of images
taken in various spots as blue circles overlaid on
top of the terrain, as shown in the following figure.

Making Money from Your Digital Content
You may be the next rising hiphop star or even the next digital Andy Warhol.
But how do you take advantage of all that is mobile to push you to the top to
fame and fortune? Why not self-publish your digital content directly to more
than 200 million mobile phone subscribers in the U.S., for starters? It could
be the big break you have been looking for, or it could help pay the rent for
all that studio time.
In the next two sections, we discuss two popular services: Bango and ooober.
Bango
Bango (at www.bango.com) is a mobile Internet pioneer in helping content
creators and developers make money from their digital media. Many in the
industry consider Bango, shown in Figure 14-10, a one-stop shop to build,
promote, and collect money from any type of mobile Internet presence you
want to manage. Bango’s mobile payment-processing capabilities are world-
class, providing you with the capabilities to accept credit cards, PayPal, and
direct wireless-carrier billing services. Bango keeps your costs low by taking
Figure 14-9:
A Kyte video
podcast.
189
Chapter 14: Creating Content, Social Networking, and Blogging  

a share of the money generated by the sale of your content, kind of like 
e-commerce networks did in the 1990s. The Bango mobile payment system
has proven to be one of the best in the world.
Bango Buttons, a cool application for your Web site, mobilizes your content
for you to immediately promote, so you can begin making money from it —
literally at the push of a button. When your digital media is enabled with a
Bango Button, you can set a price for the media and have it published on a
made-for-mobile Web site powered by Bango at wap.com, which is available
on any mobile phone browser in the world. Your site has its own identity as
well (for example yourname.wap.com) as your own mobile Internet destina-
tion address for you to promote.
ooober
To create and publish your own mobile Internet storefront, ooober
(ooober.mobi) is a helpful service provider to get you going. All you need is
your own content ready in digital format. Using ooober, you can sign on and
create and launch your own mobile Internet storefront to sell any digital con-
tent you have made and have the rights to. The content can include clips of
sounds and music to produce ringtones as well as pictures and graphical art
for mobile phone wallpaper.
Figure 14-11 shows ooober. It offers consumers a simple platform connected
to all the major wireless carriers for content delivery, and a billing system for
you to begin making money from your content. The system also works on a
revenue-sharing business model like the one Bango uses: For a subscription
to the service (promotional storefronts at no cost, superstores for $100, and
mega-storefronts for $200 — each has a different revenue-sharing model), see

www.ooober.mobi/html/oooberWorld2.jsp; you set the price for your
content, usually about a buck or two as a retail price.
After you set up your storefront, you can then promote a dedicated mobile
Internet Web site (or bind it to your own computer Web site page or a
MySpace page) to promote your new made-for-mobile content offerings.
Blogging with Popular Blog Services
Unless you’ve been living under a rock for the past five years, and probably
even if you have, you know what a blog is. Just to be on the safe side, though,
a blog is a Web site run by software that makes it easy to add content to.
Most blogs are updated frequently by one author and contain lists of fairly
short, dated entries. Some blogs contain photos or other types of media.
Blogs can be found on pretty much any topic, from astronomy to knitting to
Zoroastrianism.
If you have a blog and, like most bloggers, you also have a day job and a
family life, you probably find it a challenge to keep your blog up to date.
Blogging from a mobile device can make your life easier by allowing you to
create, edit, and update your blog from anywhere you have wireless carrier
network access.

Windows Live Spaces
You can use the Windows Live Spaces blogging service to set up a blog and
write blog entries on its mobile Web interface. Just visit mobile.spaces.
live.com from your mobile phone browser, as shown in Figure 14-12. Or,
you can set up everything from the computer, at spaces.live.com. If you
already have a Windows Live Messenger (formerly called MSN Messenger) ID,
you just have to sign in with this username and password, and then you can
create your mobile blog straight from the phone and start posting.

Watch out for roaming-access charges
Many of the applications and services dis-
cussed in this chapter use applications that
automatically send updates over the Internet,
often without your express consent. When
you’re traveling abroad or are using another
carrier’s network (roaming), these data charges
can add up. Many applications, such as Jaiku,
warn you when you’re roaming and let you turn
off the application. Not all applications offer this
option, however.
As an alternative, use a dual-mode phone, such
as the Nokia N95 or the Apple iPhone, which
can attach to high-speed WiFi networks and
exclusively use WiFi networks when you’re
abroad. A special Turn Off Data Roaming option
on the iPhone Control Panel automates the use
of roaming: When you select this option, you
can be sure that when you’re using data (such
as in your e-mail program or Web browser),
you’re using only the WiFi network and not the
cellular network. Of course, WiFi networks are
usually available only in select locations and
may also cause you to incur charges from using
them.

You can also blog to Windows Live Spaces by e-mail from your e-mail–capable
mobile phone. For full instructions, visit www.microsoft.com/athome/
intouch/mobileblogging.mspx.
Blogger
Using the popular Blogger service from Google, you can create a new blog by
picture messaging (using Multimedia Messaging Services, sometimes called
MMS) or e-mail. To get started, send a text message or a photo from your
phone to the e-mail address go@blogger.com. Blogger then sends you the
URL of your new mobile blog. As of this writing, this service is supported
only on U.S. wireless carriers.
Sony Ericsson has also bundled Blogger-compatible blogging software in its
latest Internet-capable camera phones. Just select Blog This! from the hand-
set menu after you take a picture, and you can get started with a new blog
right away. Make sure to confirm that Blogger is preinstalled before buying
the handset, however. See help.blogger.com/bin/answer.py?hl=
en&answer=72578 and www.sonyericsson.com/product/blog for more
information on how to use this function, shown in Figure 14-13.

TypePad
TypePad, a product from Six Apart, allows you to blog from your mobile
phone using your phone from the downloadable application TypePad Mobile.
This application, shown in Figure 14-14, is available for
 Series 60 phones, such as the Nokia Nseries
 UIQ phones (such as those sold by Sony Ericsson)
 Windows Mobile 5 phones
 Palm OS 5 phones
See www.sixapart.com/typepad/tmdownload.html from your computer
for more information on this application and for instructions on downloading
and installing it. Or, go to http://get.typepad.com from your mobile
browser to download the application directly.
The TypePad service isn’t free. It costs upward of $4.95 per month for service
and hosting. It also doesn’t allow you to sign up for the service from your
mobile phone. You must use the Web page to sign up.
Podcasting from Your Mobile: 
Audio and Video Upload
From being a citizen journalist to creating a cool little ditty from your mobile
phone, mobile Internet podcasting empowers you to capture any moment of
time, upload it, and share it with your network of followers.
Whether you’re a professional or an amateur, mobile podcasting service
providers have made it quite simple for you to get on the airwaves.

ShoZu (www.shozu.com), which we discuss earlier in this chapter, in the
section “Sharing Photos on the Fly,” lets you capture video and upload it to
your favorite video-sharing service, such as YouTube.
The relatively new Kyte service (www.kyte.tv) brings together photo and
video sharing, podcasting, chatting, and microblogging into a single service.
On Kyte, shown in Figure 14-15, you can create and upload photos, videos,
and audio tracks as you create them on your phone. You then upload them to
channels you create. Others can then subscribe to your Kyte channel and
view your content as you update it, or chat back to you and to others who
might also be tuned in. All features are available from both the computer and
the mobile phone, by using a downloadable client.

Microblogging: Trend of the future?
In the past few years, a new type of messaging
has emerged on the Internet: one-to-many short
messaging, or microblogging. Microblogging
refers to writing short blurbs about what you’re
doing as you’re doing it and publishing them for
the world (or just a small group of friends) to see.

Qik (www.qik.com) provides a helpful and easy-to-use downloadable client
for creating mobile live video podcasts. Integration with Twitter means that
you can announce to all your Twitter friends when you’re videocasting and
invite them to leave live comments. It’s like carrying around your own
portable television studio.

f you already read Chapters 13 and 14, you know that you have lots of
ways to get your site up and running on the mobile Internet. Getting your
social networking site, community, or photo-sharing sites online is easy, but
of course it doesn’t stop there. You won’t be surprised to discover that you
can do a lot more.
Pretty soon, you might find yourself yearning to go a bit further and build a
stand-alone site for yourself. Maybe you already have a Web site and you
want to make sure that it works on mobile handsets. Maybe your business or
organization wants to use the mobile Internet as a new way to stay in touch
with customers or members. Maybe all this talk of going mobile has given
you a good idea for a new start-up altogether. The good news is that all these
goals are well within your grasp. The act of building mobile Web sites really
isn’t rocket science. Even if you have very little technical experience, lots of
tools, conventions, and techniques are already out there for you to use. In
this chapter, we walk you through them, one by one. So don’t panic, and get
ready to see how easy developing your own Web site for the mobile Internet
really is!

Discovering Why You Should 
Build a Mobile Web Site
You might be reading this chapter for a number of reasons. Certainly you’re
interested in building a mobile Web site. But why should you? However easy
it is, you still need to put time, love, and care into building something that
your visitors will enjoy and return to.
Not everyone has regular access to a computer, and even those who do are
quite often away from their computers. If you already have a Web site, how
do those mobile users access that information or those services? Providing
and promoting a mobile Web site — even if it’s simply a mobile version of
your current site — increases the overall number of visitors you’ll have and
lets them access your site whenever they want, wherever they are.
Maybe you run a Web site for a local sports team. Imagine how useful it might
be for fans to be able to access that site when they’re physically at the game.
They might want to look up scores or player histories or check upcoming
schedules — and if the team has a mobile Web site, the fans don’t have to
wait until they get home.
Or, perhaps you own a small business and you want to reach new users and
have a closer relationship with them. If you run an auto repair garage, for
example, a mobile site is a helpful way for prospective visitors to find your
shop. (Your customers, after all, are probably mobile when they need your
services!)
The mobile site itself might even be a new way for you or your business to
make money. These days, you have plenty of ways to collect payment for con-
tent from a mobile site, and your products or services might be something
you can sell through that site. You might even put some mobile advertising in
your site, just like you can on a regular Web site. (We look at some more of
these business activities in Chapter 16.) Finally, maybe you’re simply an indi-
vidual who wants to build a site to see what the fuss is all about. After all, this
stuff is exciting, and a mobile Web site about yourself or your family is just a
cool thing to have!
Establishing an Identity 
with Your Web Address
By “establishing an identity,” we don’t mean dressing up with a fake nose, a
wig, and a pair of thick glasses. On the mobile Web, no one needs to know
what you look like!
198
Part IV: I Want My Own Mobile Internet Space 

But if you want to build a site and have people find it, you need an identity
for your site — just as Web sites do on the computer Internet, mobile sites
need addresses, or URLs (Uniform Resource Locators) as they’re sometimes
known, too.
A Web address consists of the characters a user types into a mobile browser
to get to your site. Alternatively, if another site has included a link to your
site, it must reference it by that address. For your mobile site, you need to
choose an address — hopefully, one that is easy to remember and helps iden-
tify your site for users.
Knowing what’s in a name
Most Web addresses look something like this:
http://www.example.com/home.htm
The http:// part tells your browser how to communicate with the site
when it’s asking for pages — in this case, the Web page named home.htm.
The www.example.com part is the domain, or sometimes the host. This main
address of the site tells the browser which Web server to connect to in the
first place. This part is also the one that users normally remember (and type
in their browsers).
Domains on the Web often end with .com, which has become a convention
for many sites, particularly for companies based in the United States. But
other top-level domains (as they’re known) exist, such as .org and .gov,
which tell users that sites are associated with nonprofit organizations or 
governments, respectively. You also find country-code addresses, such as
.co.uk for the United Kingdom or .ca for Canada, which are used to illus-
trate the relevance of the site for users in those countries.
199
Chapter 15: Building and Developing Mobile Web Sites
Dedicated to mobile
What do we mean when we say a “dedicated
address” for your mobile Web site? Well, think
of it this way: When your users see a Web
address ending with .com, for example, they
know with almost certainty that it will work on
their computer. But let’s be honest — the
chances that it will work perfectly on their
mobile handset are slim. And even if the site
does display satisfactorily, it isn’t necessarily
designed to serve the needs of a mobile user. So
using a suitably distinct address — such as
http://yourcompany.mobi — just for
the mobile Web site gives you a chance to
declare that it is more suitable for the mobile
handset and context of the mobile user.

Mobile Web addresses are no different from regular Web addresses in many
respects. They have the same structure, and mobile Web sites use the same
technology (known as HTTP, or HyperText Transfer Protocol) to serve up
pages. If you have an existing Web domain, it can even double as the address
of your mobile site too. (If you plan to have your mobile site share the same
address as a regular Web site, however, you need to be clever about the way
you build the site. It needs to detect whether the user is viewing it with a reg-
ular browser or a mobile handset and then serve up the correct set of pages.
(Unfortunately, this task isn’t as easy as it might sound!)
In fact, there are lots of advantages to using a dedicated address for your mobile
site. A different address helps users understand that such a site exists — they
probably won’t just try your normal Web address on the off-chance that it
works. And, if you have a business, advertising a mobile address shows that
your company is in step with these exciting new technologies. And, of course,
with a mobile site, you might even choose to offer different content, services,
or products to your users. A different address makes that distinction clear:
It’s your way of saying “I built this site for mobile users!”
When it’s time to choose your mobile address, you have a few options. As
with Web addresses for the regular Internet, you can choose from plenty of
conventions for your mobile site addresses.
Using dedicated domains 
for mobile sites: .mobi
A common convention for mobile Web sites is to use the .mobi top-level
domain. Since 2006, site owners have been able to use .mobi domain names
in exactly the same way as they do in domains ending with .com, .net,
.org, and others.
Imagine that you already have a site at
http://www.mycompany.com
Using the .mobi extension, you can easily set up a sister mobile site at
http://mycompany.mobi
In fact, most companies that sell .com domains (known as registrars) also
provide .mobi addresses, so you can buy both at the same time.
One helpful aspect about a .mobi address is that it tells users that the site is
primarily for use on their mobile phones. And, plenty of companies are
already familiar with using different top-level domain addresses (for different
countries, for example), so it’s a fairly easy choice.
200
Part IV: I Want My Own Mobile Internet Space 

The .mobi address provides to the mobile Web what .com does to the regu-
lar Web: a consistent convention for letting your mobile users know they’ll
have a good experience. On that basis alone, it’s certainly a good choice for
your mobile Web site address.
In addition, the company that manages the .mobi addresses, dotMobi, also
provides a lot of free tools and resources for you to set up your site. Through
its developer community (http://dev.mobi), you get plenty of support
and advice to help you get started in the world of mobile.
And, like the other top-level-domains (.com, .net, .org), the list of all
.mobi addresses (known as a zone file) is regularly provided to search
engine companies, so you can be sure your site will be picked up by the
search engines too — pretty useful if you want to promote the site!
Using existing domains
If you want to keep your existing Web domain, but create a specific mobile
address, you can follow a couple of conventions.
One possibility is to place an extra section at the start of the domain name.
You can then use this section, often known as a third-level domain, to replace
the www that’s often used at the start of Web addresses. One common replace-
ment is mobile, and another is simply m. So your site address could then
become
http://mobile.mycompany.com
or
http://m.mycompany.com
This approach is useful if you want to hold on to the use of your existing
.com site, but it might involve some extra keystrokes on the part of the user.
The use of a single letter m — to indicate mobile support — may also be a
little cryptic for many users. Although some host providers may charge you
for extra third-level domains, only a small amount of configuration is
required, and of course you don’t need to buy a new domain name.
You can also use directories under the domain name. These are like folders in
a desktop file system: a hierarchy of names after the address that help split
up the site into useful sections. You might choose to use the name mobile in
that way and use a site address like this:
http://www.mycompany.com/mobile/
201
Chapter 15: Building and Developing Mobile Web Sites

Again, a directory involves even more typing for the user, but it doesn’t
require you to configure anything special on your Web server. You might
choose to use this technique while you’re developing the site and then use a
dedicated .mobi address when you go live with it.
Hosting Your Mobile Site
Although you can often build and develop a mobile site on a local computer,
sooner or later you need to host it on the Internet itself. Hosting means plac-
ing the files and graphics and such on a Web server.
Some mobile network operators (also known as carriers) require site owners
to host their sites on the operator’s network if they want it to be seen by the
users who buy their handsets and plans from that operator. This is known as
the walled garden philosophy, and often means that you have to strike a deal
with that operator to make your site available to those users.
More commonly (these days), operators let their users visit any sites that are
hosted on the Internet. That’s good news: If you want your site to be visited
by mobile phones, all you need to do is host it on the Internet like a regular
site!
Choosing a hosting provider shouldn’t be too difficult. If you already have a
regular Web site, you can use that provider, and if you don’t, you can just go
out and choose a hosting provider that fits your budget.
After you sign up with your hosting provider, someone there can tell you how
to make sure that your mobile site address is pointing to the right place. If
you bought a new mobile domain, you probably need to tell your domain reg-
istrar where your hosting servers are.
202
Part IV: I Want My Own Mobile Internet Space 
Way back WAP
On a historical note, you might still see mobile
Web addresses that look like wap.my
company.com or www.mycompany.com/
wap.
Wireless Application Protocol (WAP), which
was launched in 1999, is an older way of getting
mobile phones to access Web-like content.
WAP phones used to be incompatible with 
regular Web pages, and a few companies set
up WAP-specific sites. Since then, things have
moved on (like most forms of technology) and
most modern phones don’t require — or even
support — WAP pages. The fact that some
addresses still contain those three letters is just
a throwback to the days when they did.

You should also be able to get a file transfer protocol (FTP) account. You
need this server address and username/password combination in order to
upload your pages to the server. Hold on to this information: You need it
when you’re ready to go live with your site.
If that process sounds too hard, remember that most hosting providers sell
domains, and most domain registrars offer hosting, so you can probably get
the whole thing set up in one place anyway!
Making Big Decisions
When you’re building a new mobile site, spend some time thinking about
your approach and the tools you’re going to use.
If your mobile site is the first site you create, you have lots of choices. You
can build the mobile site any way you want, and you don’t need to worry
about making it consistent with anything you had before — an existing Web
site, for example.
For many site owners, however, the mobile site supplements an existing Web
presence. Building a second site from scratch is pretty foolish, especially if the
two sites will share a lot of each other’s pages and content. So at this point,
you need to plan a strategy to reuse as much of that material as possible.
One good question you should ask yourself is whether you want your mobile
site to be static or dynamic.
Many sites are made up of a set of static pages that are saved on the server
as individual documents. If your server has lots of files on it, with names
ending in .html or .html, you have a static site. Each of these files is a single
page on your site, and if you want to change a page, you have to change one
of those files (by either editing it or uploading a new copy). This approach is
useful if your site is small and simple, and you just want to get going quickly.
On the other hand, you might have a dynamic Web site, for which most of the
information is stored in a database and the pages are created on demand by
using a programming language such as PHP or ASP. This task isn’t easy for
nonprogrammers, but that approach does mean that the site is easier to
maintain because you can edit the information in the database and the pages
are updated automatically. In addition, you can be sure that each page is con-
sistently formatted. If you have a blog site, chances are that you’ve seen this
approach in action.
203
Chapter 15: Building and Developing Mobile Web Sites

Of course, you can also decide whether you want your mobile site to be static
or dynamic. There are some particular advantages to making your mobile site
dynamically generated, but it’s important for you to find an approach that
suits your needs and your skills.
The scenarios we describe in Table 15-1 for choosing between the static and
dynamic site approaches might sound somewhat baffling, so we walk you
through some of the options later in this chapter. Remember, however, that
regardless of the type of site you’re building, you can always find tools and
techniques that are ready for you to use.

Using a Mobile Site Builder
No one likes it when things are more complicated than they have to be. And,
building a Web site, whether it’s mobile or not, can certainly seem quite 
complicated. If you want to build a mobile site from scratch as easily as 
possible, you can do a lot worse than getting started with special mobile site
builder software.
Web browsers display pages that are written in HyperText Markup Language,
or HTML. HTML contains all the information that a Web browser needs in
order to display a page, including the text of the page, its links, its layout, and
information about the images in it. Mobile browsers are no different, although
some of them prefer a newer version of the language, XHTML (the X stands
for eXtensible).
Unfortunately, although browsers love reading HTML and XHTML, most
humans don’t love writing it. A site builder is a piece of software designed to
take the technical skill (not to mention the pain and frustration) out of writ-
ing those Web pages, and makes it an intuitive activity or a visual process
that all of us can understand. But there’s even more good news: You can find
mobile site builders, too, which are specifically designed to create sites for
the mobile Internet. These programs make your life very easy. In the next few
sections, we take a look at some of your options.
The Site.mobi Site Builder
dotMobi, the company that provides .mobi domain names, also provides
Site Builder (see Figure 15-1), which makes it easy to create sites. To get to
Site Builder, simply go to http://site.mobi by using your computer’s
Internet browser.
Most Web site builders require you to sign up. Site Builder simply asks you
for a username and password, and then you’re off.
The key to creating a good mobile site is having a simple design. With Site
Builder, the first thing you do is select a color scheme and a template for
your site. Quite a few choices are offered, so you should be able to give your
site some distinction and, if you’re creating a site for a business or an organi-
zation, match the color scheme you need.
205
Chapter 15: Building and Developing Mobile Web Sites

A common design for a mobile Web site is to have an entry page with a logo
and a list of links — that then link to individual pages within the site for more
detail. Of course, this method isn’t the only way to lay out a site, but it’s a
good start. You can always change the design and structure later.
As you work your way through the Site Builder Wizard, shown in Figure 15-2,
follow the simple instructions.
Site Builder lets you select a visual theme for your site and then define the
pages you need, as shown in Figure 15-3.
After you choose your pages, the wizard even validates your site against the
dotMobi ready.mobi page checker, as shown in Figure 15-4. This tool is a help-
ful way to ensure that your page has a good chance of working on real mobile
handsets.
Finally, the wizard concludes by asking you for your hosting details (FTP
information), as shown in Figure 15-5. These details should have been 
provided by your hosting provider. The FTP info allows the site.mobi tool to
upload the site directly to your server. And you’re done!

WebSite Tonight
Another popular site builder is WebSite Tonight, available from GoDaddy.
Depending on where you bought your domain or hosting service, you may
already have used this tool for building regular sites.
WebSite Tonight, shown in Figure 15-6, can also be used to build mobile sites.
It’s a simple way to build your site, and as with the dotMobi Site Builder, you
can be confident that the pages it produces will work well on mobile handsets.
WebSite Tonight is available from the GoDaddy home page (www.godaddy.
com) — click the Site Builders link.
Winksite
Another helpful way to create a mobile presence is Winksite, at http://
winksite.com and shown in Figure 15-7. Although this service can be used
to set up social networking pages, it also doubles as a neat way to build a
site. Winksite guarantees that sites are compliant with the dotMobi best 
practices for building sites.

Chapter 15: Building and Developing Mobile Web Sites

As with the other tools we describe, at Winksite you can quickly choose
themes and create and edit pages. It’s centrally hosted, which means that all
the pages you create are managed by Winksite, so you don’t need to worry
about providing hosting details.
Being centrally hosted also means that all sites can be categorized, as shown
in Figure 15-8, and that users can create a social network of sites. For exam-
ple, you might like to create links or relationships with others with whom you
share something in common.

You can also add mobile advertising into a Winksite, as a way to help make
you feel that your efforts in mobile development have all been worthwhile.
We talk about making money from your mobile content in Chapter 16.
Converting an Existing Web 
Site to a Mobile One
The first half of this chapter describes tools for building new, static Web sites
from scratch. But if you have an existing Web site, you probably don’t want to
type all that content again. Instead, you might be looking for a quick fix and
want to simply try to convert your current Web site to a mobile site.
You should bear in mind a few considerations when you take this approach.
Think carefully about what your users truly want to do when they’re mobile.
They might not want to be able to see your entire regular Web site. Maybe
only part of your current site is truly applicable for people on the move. On
the other hand, you might be able to offer extra features to your mobile users
that your regular Web site doesn’t already have.
For example, if you run a retail store, your regular Web site might have lots of
photographs of the store and details about your products. Somewhere down
at the bottom of the page, you might list some contact details and provide a
link to a map to show the store’s location.
But the chances are good that visitors to your mobile site will have different
priorities, and a simple conversion of the existing content might not be what
they’re looking for. They probably don’t have the time or patience to browse
through all your nice photography!
For instance, if people are visiting your site by using their mobile phones, it’s
a good guess that they’re already in the area and thinking about coming to
your store. The priorities for the mobile site might simply be to confirm what
type of store it is and what your business hours are, to find simple directions
to the store, and to provide a phone number.
Make sure to put a telephone number on your site. After all, potential visitors
are using their phones! When you’re converting an existing site, also consider
how often you need to update either site. Some conversion techniques take a
single “snapshot” of your Web site in its current state and convert it to a
mobile version. If you ever change the regular site, the changes don’t auto-
matically happen to the mobile site, and then you have the unenviable task of
keeping two sites up to date — not fun!
211
Chapter 15: Building and Developing Mobile Web Sites

If you decide to take the route of converting a regular Web site to one for the
mobile Internet, a particularly useful conversion tool is Mobilizer, from the
UK company Ubik (www.ubik.com). This service lets you save and edit your
converted site and its structure. But it also maps your regular Web site to a
mobile one in real time, so it removes the worry of having to keep two sites
up-to-date yourself.
To start, simply visit the Web site and sign up by providing your e-mail
address. (At the time of writing, the service is in beta so some of this func-
tionality may change). You’re then asked to enter the address of your existing
site, and Mobilizer begins the process of importing your Web site, as shown
in Figure 15-9.
In addition, Mobilizer is particularly good at being able to cater to different
mobile handset models. As you use the tool, you see that it can produce ver-
sions for large smartphones as well as it does for simpler low-end phones.
After the site is imported, you can change the content, how much of it
appears on each page, and what each page looks like.
Plugging Made-for-Mobile Content 
into Dynamic Sites
These days, many regular Web sites aren’t built from static pages, but instead
generate pages dynamically from information in a database. Many such sys-
tems are custom-built specifically to fill the needs of the site itself, but many
common content management systems (CMSs) are used throughout the Web
to create easily maintained Web content.
Examples of common CMS platforms include TYPO3, Joomla!, and Drupal.
Content management systems designed specifically for bloggers include
MovableType and WordPress.

Part IV: I Want My Own Mobile Internet Space 

In fact, if you’re thinking about mobile but don’t have any sort of Web site
yet, consider a CMS from Day One. These days, a CMS is cheap and easy to
set up, and you have the advantage of having all your content and pages
stored in a flexible way. If you’re a blogger, you probably can’t avoid this
approach!
The good news is that if you’re using a CMS, the chances are good that the
platform already includes mobile capability. Most CMS products allow you to
turn on extra modules to give you extra functionality, and mobile modules
are becoming quite common.
With a mobile module in your CMS platform, you have an excellent way to
quickly get existing content into the hands of mobile users. Typically, the
module detects when a user is accessing your CMS-based site with a mobile
handset, and then quickly formats the theme, style, and layout of the page to
ensure that the content that’s produced works well on a mobile device.
Again, think carefully about what mobile users might truly want to do on your
site. There might be more to this approach than simply turning on the CMS
platform’s mobile module — you might also want to build a set of specific
pages for those users. But at least this approach gets you started very
quickly.
TYPO3
TYPO3 is a common content management platform, and one that has an
excellent mobile module for it: the Wireless Universal Resource File (WURFL)
extension. The WURFL module is a database of mobile handset information
that detects whether a device is mobile and then adapts the resulting content
according to the device.
The site can then be created and edited as usual, as shown in Figure 15-10.
Figure 15-10:
Editing the
content of
the mobile
page.
213
Chapter 15: Building and Developing Mobile Web Sites

The result is content that can be viewed on both a mobile device and a 
regular desktop browser (see Figure 15-11).
Drupal
Drupal is a popular open source content management system (CMS). Although
Drupal is a little more powerful and configurable than many other CMSs, it’s
becoming a popular choice for people building community-based sites. Its
mobile theme makes mobilizing your content really easy.
The Drupal community site at http://drupal.org provides all the down-
loads and instructions you need to get started. At first Drupal can be fairly
daunting, but it’s worth it. The .mobi loader module (in the Modules section)
and the .mobi theme (in the Themes section) work together to provide a
good introduction to using Drupal for mobile purposes.
WordPress
Blogging is extremely popular as a way for individuals and companies to
make themselves heard on the Internet. Literally millions of bloggers post
articles every day — and because blog content is so timely (and bite-sized),
it’s a great candidate for converting for mobile use.
Figure 15-11:

214
Part IV: I Want My Own Mobile Internet Space 

The majority of blogs are written on CMS-like platforms specifically built for
the task of blogging. WordPress is a popular option, and it has an excellent
mobile module. In just a few clicks, you can get your blog out there on the
mobile Web!
You can find more information on the WordPress mobile plug-in at http://
dev.mobi/node/78.
Hosted blog platforms
Many blogs are run as part of centrally hosted services, and many of these
are starting to add mobile capabilities.
You can use Google’s Blogger service, for example, to upload posts using
e-mail or picture messaging. The blogs are also available for reading on mobile
handsets — take a look at http://go.blogger.com for more details.
The Microsoft Live Spaces platform also provides mobile capabilities auto-
matically. If you have a Live Spaces blog, you can simply go to http://
mobile.spaces.live.com to access it with your mobile handset.
Handcrafting Mobile Content
Maybe all this talk of site builders, content management systems, and mobile
modules has left you cold, and all you really want to do is get your hands
dirty by building mobile pages yourself!
Even if you’re planning to use a CMS or site builder and are just curious
about what’s going on behind the scenes, it’s quite useful to understand the
basic technology behind a mobile Web page.
Getting a handle on the basics
A mobile Web page is similar to a regular Web page. The page is written as a
piece of markup, which is a mixture of the text that will appear on the page,
along with extra information about the layout of the page, the formatting of
the text, and any other elements of the page, such as graphics.
As we mention earlier in this chapter, most Web site pages are written with
the markup language HTML. But mobile phones prefer to render XHTML, a
slightly more modern type of markup.
215
Chapter 15: Building and Developing Mobile Web Sites

XHTML is more structured than HTML, and you have to follow a few more
rules than you do in HTML. But the small amount of extra effort is worth it
because you can be more confident that it will work on a range of different
mobile phones.
Within the page, you probably also want to have some graphics to make the
page look a little more exciting than it does with just plain text.
Mobile phones have quite small screens, so keep the image sizes fairly 
small (120 pixels wide is a good rule). GIF or JPG picture formats are widely
supported by most handsets.
Writing your first mobile page
Creating the markup for a page doesn’t require anything more clever than a
text editor. You can even use Windows Notepad to write your first page.
So, if you are using Windows, open Notepad (choose Start➪Programs➪
Accessories), and get ready to write your page!
The page should start off with some special instructions to describe the fact
that what follows is XHTML, and then the title of the page, and so on.
You can copy the following page into a text editor. The section named
<body> is the main part of the page that the user sees. (Note that you need
to type the closing </body> tag to indicate where the body of the page
comes to an end.)
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC “-//WAPFORUM//DTD XHTML Mobile
1.0//EN” “http://www.wapforum.org/DTD/xhtml-
mobile10.dtd”>
<html>
<body>
</body>
</html>
Within the page, text must be structured in paragraphs. These paragraphs
are enclosed in <p> tags, like this:
. . .<html>
<body>
<p>My first mobile page</p>
<p>And here is a second paragraph</p>
</body>
</html>
216
Part IV: I Want My Own Mobile Internet Space 

Save this file to your computer’s hard drive as index.htm. Although you’re
designing this page to be viewed on a mobile phone, you should check how it
displays in your own Web browser too. For the purpose of seeing how the
page looks, viewing the page in your computer’s Web browser is a quite
useful way to see the page as it develops. If you have saved the file as
index.htm, double-click the file in Windows Explorer (or Mac Finder) and the
page automatically launches in your default browser.
In XHTML, whenever you start sections with tags (such as <p> for para-
graph), you must remember to close them again (with </p>), in reverse
order to the sequence in which you opened them.
For example, if you want to format some of your text, you can use the <b> tag
for bold and the <i> tag for italics:
. . . <html>
<body>
<p>My first mobile page</p>
<p>
This is <b>bold</b>.
<br />
This is <i>italic</i>.
<br />
And this is <b><i>both!</i></b>
</p>
</body>
</html>
Notice how we used the <br /> tag to indicate that we want to break the
line. It’s a special sort of tag that opens and immediately closes. Although our
markup shows the text on different lines, the mobile browser runs all the text
together in one line unless it sees a <br /> tag to explicitly insert a break.
You just created your first basic mobile Web page!
Adding pictures and links
To include an image in your page, use the <img /> tag and provide some
information to indicate where the image file is. Suppose that you pick a nice
image to put in your page and save it in the same directory as the page of
markup. You use the src attribute to tell the browser which file to use.
Put the image tag into your page and see what happens:
217
Chapter 15: Building and Developing Mobile Web Sites

. . . <html>
<body>
<p>My first mobile page</p>
<p>
<img src=”picture.gif” alt=”a picture” />
</p>
</body>
</html>
Notice how we also specified the alt attribute to provide some extra text.
The alt attribute is required in XHTML, and is quite helpful for mobile: The
alt text is displayed while the image is loading (which might take a few 
seconds, depending on the user’s network speed).
Creating a hyperlink from one page to another is also quite easy. If you have a
site with lots of information on it, you have to provide people with a way to
navigate it.
The <a> tag creates a link, and the href attribute tells the browser where to
go when the user clicks it. Inside the <a> tag is the text that’s linked. If you
have a second page, you can link them together like this:
. . . <html>
<body>
<p>My first mobile page</p>
<p>
<img src=”picture.gif” alt=”a picture” />
</p>
<p>
<a href=’page2.htm’>Go to page two</a>
</p>
</body>
</html>
. . . <html>
<body>
<p>My second mobile page</p>
<p>
<a href=’index.htm’>Home again!</a>
</p>
</body>
</html>
After you create a basic page and add text and images to it, you can prepare
to go live with it, which we discuss in the next section.
218
Part IV: I Want My Own Mobile Internet Space 

Uploading the site
We have to show you a few more things to do before you can truly say that
you’ve gone live with your site. For starters, your Web page is still on your
computer’s hard drive. Although your Web browser can see the files locally,
the pages have to be hosted on the Internet before a mobile device can see
them.
Most hosting providers provide file transfer protocol (FTP) for uploading
content to their servers. You must have FTP software on your computer to
connect to their servers to do the uploading. Your hosting provider will prob-
ably recommend a good FTP program — examples include SmartFTP,
CuteFTP, and Filezilla, and these are all easy to find on the Web.
Your hosting provider will also provide you with the FTP details you need to
enter into these programs to start the upload. You’ll be given a server
address, a username, and a password. You may also be told to use a particu-
lar mode of FTP (either passive or active). These settings will vary from host-
ing provider to hosting provider.
On some hosting platforms, you may not need to use FTP and may be able to
upload pages and content by using your Web browser. But whichever
approach you use, your goal is to get your two pages and the graphics
uploaded to the server.
After the files are on your live server, you can use your regular Web browser
to make sure that your Web site still works as expected. But now that your
site is live on the Web, you can also connect a real mobile device to it and see
what it looks like. To load the page, just enter the address of the first page
into your mobile browser and — ta-da! — you should be able to see the
simple site you just created.
Testing and Improving Your Site
After you’ve uploaded your site, the chances are good that the page looks a
little different on a mobile device than it did on your regular Web browser.
For starters, the mobile screen is smaller, of course, and the fonts are differ-
ent. But the basic layout should look the way you expected. Try clicking the
links to make sure that they work.
At this point, you probably want to rush out of the room to find someone else
to show your new creation to. Go on: Be proud of it!
219
Chapter 15: Building and Developing Mobile Web Sites

But there’s a good chance that whoever you choose to show off to has a dif-
ferent kind of phone than you do — and if they do, you’ll immediately notice
that the page looks a little different than the way it does on yours. Every
mobile phone is a little different — and sometimes more than a little. This is
important, because every little difference might affect the way your page 
displays.
To minimize the problems that these differences may cause, access your Web
site on a few different phones. For simple pages like the ones in this chapter,
you can be fairly confident that they will render correctly on most handsets.
But as you start to build more and more complex pages, you should start
testing their behavior on a range of different handsets.
Unfortunately, there isn’t really a good substitute for old-fashioned trial-and-
error testing, and most people don’t normally have dozens of different types
of phones on hand. Fortunately, you can do a number of things anyway.
dotMobi provides a free online page and site tester (at http://ready.
mobi), which is a helpful way to find out how well you built your site and to
view it in a simple emulator.
You can also check out the useful service DeviceAnywhere, which lets you
connect to a range of handsets — over the Internet — and test your site on
them. You can find the service at http://deviceanywhere.com.

Discovering the Three Best Ways to
Make Money on the Mobile Internet
We could make you wade through a full made-for-mobile MBA to find out how
to make money on the mobile Internet, but because we’re limited to a single
chapter, we walk you instead through three of the most common ways to get
the most revenue from what you have to offer:
224
Part IV: I Want My Own Mobile Internet Space 

 Premium-rate text messaging for mobile payments from text-based infor-
mation and mobile content storefronts
 Credit card and PayPal acceptance for mobile payments
 Mobile advertising to make money from target audiences viewing your
made-for-mobile Web sites
Premium-rate text messaging 
and storefronts
One of the most popular mobile Internet services is now text messaging.
Premium-rate text messaging has become the best way for anyone interested
in joining the mobile Internet economy to share their mobile content and
have it billed to consumers’ monthly wireless-carrier statements.
For more information on text messaging, short codes, and service examples,
be sure to read Chapter 6. The more you know about the power of text 
messaging, the better you’re prepared to see whether it can work for you.
Services you can build and publish to mobile Internet consumers include
 Text-based information push alerts and on-demand pull services, includ-
ing news, sports updates, jokes, pick-up lines, thoughts of the day, 
horoscopes, traffic updates, transit updates, polls, voting, trivia, 
contests, charity fundraising, and more
 Interactive chat and service subscription payments for content
 Mobile digital content storefronts for ringtones, wallpapers, games,
videos, and music
 Product storefronts and vending machines where payments are made
through a mobile phone
If you’re selling content, you may find it useful and convenient to bill for con-
tent by using premium-rate text messaging (also known as premium SMS or
PSMS). What is premium-rate text messaging, you ask? It’s the text message
equivalent of calling a premium-rate phone number (such as a 1-900 number).
Calling this type of number costs a caller more per minute than calling a regu-
lar number because a service is being offered. (For example, many customer
service hotlines work on this basis.) Premium-rate text messaging is similar,
except that the text message or offer for content can also be sent to the cus-
tomer. The advantage of premium-rate text messaging is that it’s simple to do.
225
Chapter 16: Making Money on the Mobile Internet

Premium-rate text-messaging services and billings are connected to wireless
carriers by means of industry-approved and -certified aggregators. Aggregators
work with you (the mobile content provider), your mobile service vendors,
and wireless carriers to set program pricing, mediate required connections,
secure premium-rate short codes for, and manage revenue-sharing payouts.
Most programs offered with premium-rate text messaging are in the $1–10
range. The revenue from premium-rate text messaging programs is split
among all parties involved, including the aggregator and the wireless carrier.
For a list of aggregators in the United States, go to the Common Short Code
Administration Web site at www.usshortcodes.com/csc_partner.html
and click the Connection Aggregators link.
For a list of aggregators in Canada, go to the CWTA’s Canada Text Messaging
Resource Centre at www.txt.ca.
It’s still not a bad deal when you consider the complex task involved in doing
it all for millions of mobile consumers 24/7.
Setting up a short-code program
To secure access to a premium-rate short code, you need to
 Find and work with an aggregator to secure your premium-rate short
code with your country’s short-code registry. In the United States, see
www.usshortcodes.com; in Canada, see www.txt.ca.
 Apply for a premium rate short-code license (they last between 3 and 
12 months) and secure connection agreements to all the wireless 
carriers that you want to process your mobile payments.
 Build your premium rate short-code mobile Internet service and pro-
mote your offering to your target audience.
The plan is simple, but it can take from two to eight weeks to set up your end-
to-end premium rate short-code program. Also, you have no guarantee that
your target audience will buy the products and services you offer.
Just because you think you have an excellent premium-rate text messaging
program doesn’t mean that the aggregators, wireless carriers, and mobile
solution vendors you work with think so too. They aren’t responsible for 
promoting and understanding all the benefits and values of your program:
Their purpose is to provide technology, infrastructure, and billing services.
Additionally, they don’t provide these services for free: They charge you for
the licensing, development, and support of your program.
226
Part IV: I Want My Own Mobile Internet Space 

Running your text-messaging program
You have two ways to run a premium-rate text messaging program:
 Secure your own premium rate text-messaging short code directly with
an aggregator, as we outline in the preceding section.
 Leverage a premium rate text-messaging short code already approved
by the wireless carriers and aggregators from a mobile messaging 
service provider.
To take advantage of a premium rate text-messaging short code already
approved and on the market, work with the service provider that’s licensing
and managing the short code to secure keywords that work with your offer-
ings. You also have to share any revenue from the sale of your mobile content
and service offering.
To find out more about sharing a premium rate text-messaging short code for
your mobile Internet offerings, visit the following companies to find out more
about the programs they offer:
 Air2Web: www.air2Web.com
 iLoop Mobile: www.iloopmobile.com
 Jambo Mobile: www.jambomobile.com
 ooober: www.ooober.com
 SinglePoint: www.singlepoint.com
These are a few examples of premium-rate text messaging short-code 
programs:
 MTV: Receive information services for MTV Insider, MTV Mobile Alerts
(see Figure 16-2), and TRL Alerts priced from $2.99 per month.
 Jamster: Check out the $9.99 monthly subscription plans to receive ring-
tones, wallpapers, games, and more. Visit www.jamster.com/jcw/all/
aboOverview.do for more details (see Figure 16-3).
You’re charged by your wireless carrier to use and access these services.
Each service you try is detailed on your next wireless carrier bill along with
the service charge.

Taking credit cards over 
the mobile Internet
You can accept credit card numbers from mobile browsers as payment for
content in the same way you can take credit card numbers on the Internet.
However, you should be aware of security issues. On the Internet, when you
connect to a secure Web site (such as when you enter credit card information
or use your bank’s Web site to check your balance or pay bills), your connec-
tion is secure, and you know that it is because you can see the security icon
in your browser, as shown in Figure 16-4.
On the mobile device, the security of your transactions is less certain. A
user’s browser often cannot operate securely. Some advanced browsers on
advanced devices are secure, but you cannot assume that all browsers have
this capability.
Advances have been made by mobile-payment billing solution providers to
help solve this problem. These companies have developed secure payment
technologies to work from almost any mobile browser.
To start a mobile storefront or leverage one that already exists, visit these
companies:
 Bango: www.bango.com
 mPoria: www.mporia.com
 PayPal Mobile: www.paypal-promo.com/mobilecheckout/index.html
Mobile payments and commerce are in the very early stages of development
in North America, with the exception of billing by using premium rate text-
messaging short codes from aggregators and wireless carriers, which make
up a large fraction of the revenue.
Visa, MasterCard, and other financial payment providers are looking at new
ways to leverage mobile phones as wireless wallets. For more information on
Visa mobile payment initiatives, visit Visa at http://corporate.visa.com/

Chapter 16: Making Money on the Mobile Internet

Embracing mobile advertising
The mobile advertising market is set to explode — it really is. Most industry
experts and market research analysts have been tracking mobile advertising
as the next wave of moneymaking opportunity for the digital media world.
Billions of dollars will be spent and made in the mobile advertising space
over the next three to five years.
Figure 16-5 illustrates a simple example of the flow to expect from delivering
a mobile advertising campaign to a consumer on the mobile Web.
One reason behind the explosion of the Web was the advent of advertising,
and the same situation is now happening on the mobile Web. Mobile advertis-
ing offers you two opportunities:
 Mobile Web site owners can make money. Run ads on your site to
create an income stream from site visitors. Generally, the more visitors
you have, the more you can make.
 Mobile Web site owners can buy advertising to promote a mobile Web
site after it’s built. After all, if you build it and don’t tell anyone about it,
no one will come.
Many site owners follow up on both of these opportunities: Advertise on
their own sites to make money, and reinvest some of the money earned to
run ads elsewhere to promote their sites. The more traffic that site owners
generate, the more money they make, and so on. Advertising on the mobile
Web has been proven time after time to be the best way to promote a made-
for-mobile Web site.
One brand wanted to build traffic for its mobile Web site themed around
sport sponsorship. It spent 0.4 percent of its total advertising expenditures
on the mobile-advertising network provider AdMob, and spent the rest on

traditional media. The AdMob advertising buy delivered 40 percent of its 
traffic. This example clearly makes a compelling case for mobile advertising
indeed.
It’s not surprising that a mobile channel should outperform other media in
generating traffic for mobile Web sites. After all, the mobile Web can lure con-
sumers to a mobile Web site with one keypad click, whereas consumers who
see an offline ad have to remember the address, know how to use the mobile
Web, have the correct settings on their phones, and then use an awkward
interface to enter the URL.
For this reason, mobile advertising is bound to outperform other forms of
advertising, in the same way that Web advertising outperforms other forms
of advertising.
Some forms of advertising can be controversial, especially the kind that inter-
rupts whatever the user is trying to do at the time. However, the kind of
advertising that has appeared on the mobile Web so far has been restricted
to text and graphical banners, which were pioneered on the Internet by the
likes of Overture (Yahoo!) and Google.
Generally speaking, most users are happy with this format because the ads
can prove to be genuinely useful in helping users to find the content they’re
looking for, and can be easily ignored if they don’t. More importantly, most
people understand that advertising allows content owners to offer their prod-
ucts and services for free, or on a subsidised basis. Faced with the choice of
free content with advertising or paid-for content with no ads, most people
choose the advertising route.
If you’re thinking of running mobile advertising to promote your site, or
thinking of monetizing your site by allowing advertising on it, you have a few
choices of partners to consider. Your choices range from wireless carriers
(such as the Sprint Mobile Media Network at www.sprintmedianetwork.
com) to Google, Yahoo!, and new mobile advertising companies such as
AdMob, Millennial Media, ScreenTonic, Third Screen Media, and the Nokia Ad
Services Business. The Nokia unit was recently formed with the acquisition of
the mobile advertising pioneer EnPocket.
The dotMobi Advisory Group published a useful mobile advertising white
paper that details the whole mobile advertising ecosystem. Read it for free at
www.advisorygroup.mobi/mobileadvertising/whitepaper.pdf.
If you want to get into the mobile ad serving business, you can build your
own or check out companies such as Smaato (www.smaato.com), which
allows you to put your own name, or private label, on its technology to get
you started.
231
Chapter 16: Making Money on the Mobile Internet

Check out the upcoming section to find out how you can use AdMob and the
Internet giants at Google to start making money now from mobile advertising
on your made-for-mobile Web sites.
Advertising with AdMob
AdMob (www.admob.com) started at the beginning of 2006, marking the
launch of the world’s first mobile advertising network. Two years later,
AdMob has reflected the huge growth of the mobile Internet, having served
more than 15 billion mobile Web ads at the time of this writing. When a
mobile ad company grows this quickly and has numbers this high, it’s a clear
indication that mobile advertising will become a huge industry — and
quickly.
The idea behind AdMob is straightforward: It finds mobile Web sites (such as
yours) with existing visitors and offers to run text link advertisements on its
site on a pay per click (PPC) basis. Certain sites and markets can also run
graphical banners. For many of these mobile Web sites, advertising repre-
sents a new revenue stream and, in many cases, a completely new business
model. When AdMob has sites to advertise on, the sites can be offered to
potential advertisers to run ad campaigns.
Read through the Mobile Marketing Association mobile advertising guidelines
for the latest information and industry best practices for mobile ad banner
sizes, styles, graphics, and text links. (See the nearby sidebar, “Best practice
guidelines from the Mobile Marketing Association,” for more information on
the guidelines and where to find them.)
Figuring out who the 
mobile advertisers are
If you’re going to run ads on your site, you should know who might be adver-
tising there. You need to be in complete control, so don’t sign up with a
system that doesn’t let you approve all advertisers before their ads are pub-
lished. For instance, you might not want certain sorts of advertisers, such as
those promoting adult content (although AdMob doesn’t run these kinds of
ads anyway) or your competitors to advertise on your site.
Broadly, you can expect to see two types of advertisers:
 Mobile content sellers: These companies sell special products and 
services, such as ringtones, games, and software applications, for
mobile phones.
232
Part IV: I Want My Own Mobile Internet Space 

For these companies, the mobile advertising channel is a major turning
point because it changes the mobile phone, in a stroke, from a distribu-
tion channel to a mobile marketing channel. The most exciting part is
that these ads preach to the converted: Because you know, beyond a
shadow of a doubt, that people who see the ads are mobile-literate and
active users of their phones, you lessen your wastage of ad dollars 
dramatically.
 Mainstream advertisers: The second and potentially much larger type
of advertiser is the blue-chip brand, such as Ford, Procter & Gamble,
and Adidas.
These brands have woken up to the huge potential of the mobile Web
and are starting to realize that it might just be even bigger than the
Internet. Already, mobile phones outnumber Internet-connected comput-
ers, which means that more people can potentially access the Web by
using their mobile phones. That’s why the smart money is betting that
the mobile Web will be as important, if not more important, than the
computer Internet.
Putting ads on your mobile Web site
After you build your mobile Web site, getting ads on them is easy. All you
need to do is register with a company such as AdMob. The registration
process generates the code you need in various programming language
options (such as PHP, Ruby on Rails, and CGI/Perl). Next, follow these simple
steps:
1. Go to www.admob.com.
Figure 16-6 shows the AdMob Web site.
2. Click the Get Started button in the Publishers section.
3. Fill in the account registration details to set up your profile, services,
and accounts. Then follow the online instructions to get started with
mobile advertising on your mobile Web site.
4. Select the language for the ad code that works best for your site.
5. Copy the entire code snippet and paste it into your site’s source code.
Paste the snippet wherever you want an ad to appear.
The exact method for inserting the ad into your site’s source code varies
depending on how your site is constructed. For example, if your site is
managed from the WordPress blogging platform and you’re using the
WordPress mobile plug-in, you have to edit the template for the mobile
page. This type of operation can usually be accomplished from the
administrative facility of whatever site publishing system you’re using.
233
Chapter 16: Making Money on the Mobile Internet

6. Test your installation.
By default, the code is set to run in test mode. In this mode, if the ad
code is properly installed, a Test Ad link is displayed on your site. When
you can see the test link, you’re ready to set the code to Live mode.
7. To set the code to Live mode, find the location in the code that reads
Change to Live When Ready to Deploy. On the line below it,
change Test to Live.
8. Reload your page and you’re done!
If the code is properly installed, your site is activated by the system and
you receive an e-mail notification.
In just a couple of lines of code, you can launch your mobile Web site 
supported by the AdMob network of advertisers and agencies.
Now it’s up to you to promote your made-for-mobile Web site to your friends
and associates, on billboards and in magazines, and using e-mail marketing
campaigns and even the mobile Web itself.

Creating a mobile advertising campaign
You can set up a mobile ad campaign surprisingly quickly, directly on the
AdMob platform and on any other mobile advertising service provider’s net-
work. You can take a simple campaign from planning to execution in about
ten minutes. In this section, we show you how that process works.
AdMob uses an intuitive wizard to guide you through the creation of a mobile
ad. Here are the simple steps to launch a campaign:
1. Register or log in to the AdMob site at www.admob.com.
2. Click the My Ads button and select Create Ad from the menu.
This step opens a series of pages that help you complete the steps. The
wizard walks you through a series of choices you need to make to target
your campaign.
3. Create the ad by entering as many as 35 characters of compelling
copy that gets consumers interested enough to click.
Many advertisers tend to personalize their ads by quoting the user’s
phone model. This strategy might not resonate well with you, but to the
youth market, the phone model is more important than the make of your
car might be to you. An ad that says “Ringtones for the RAZR” or “Games
for the iPhone” truly grabs their attention.
4. Decide in which countries you want to run your ad.
You can select the country (for example, U.S.), region (for example,
Europe), or even global campaign, depending on your requirements. You
can also choose on which types and brands of handset to run your cam-
paign. You also choose the type of channel to advertise on, whether it’s
communities, news and entertainment, or portals. You have the choice
of five channels of interest to select from.
5. Decide how much you want to pay for each click your ad receives.
AdMob operates on an auction system. The higher your bid, the more
likely your ad is to be served, and thus the more clicks you get.
Getting to Know Google Mobile Ads
Google operates the Google Mobile Ads service, which complements its
highly successful Google AdWords service. Google Mobile Ads can appear on
mobile Web sites (sites specifically designed for mobile phones) or on Google
mobile search engine result pages displayed to mobile Internet users.
235
Chapter 16: Making Money on the Mobile Internet

The mechanism for creating a mobile ad in Google is similar to how you
create a Google AdWords advertisement. First, you must set up a Google
AdWords account (go to adwords.google.com). From there, you can create
a campaign and then, within that campaign, create mobile text ads.
Using Google Mobile Ads, you can also place a phone number in the ad and
give users the option to click to call when they see the ad. Remember that
they will view your ad on a phone — what else can they do with their phones
other than use the mobile Internet? Believe it or not, users can make phone
calls on their phones too. Think about incorporating a click-to-call feature to
bring potential customers one step closer to you.
Additionally, Google Mobile Ads can help you target your ads by wireless car-
rier. If you want to show T-Mobile customers something different from what
AT&T customers see, for example, you might want to use this cool service
feature, called carrier targeting. For example, you might run ad campaigns for
handset upgrades that are specific to a particular mobile operator.
For more information on Google Mobile Ads, go to this link on your com-
puter’s browser: services.google.com/adwords/mobile_ads.
If you’re interested in building mobile advertising services into your 
mobile Web site from the start, both iLoop Mobile and Akmin (at www.mobi

utilities into their mobile Web site building tools.

T
hroughout this book, we talk a lot about mobile Internet sites and ser-
vices and how you can use and build them. In this chapter, we list more
sites, resources, and places to go for help. This chapter just contains our
favorites, so of course it’s not complete by any means. But if you’re starting
to become familiar with mobile and content creation or you want to go a little
further in the wonderful world of mobile, you should find plenty of informa-
tion in this chapter to keep you interested, intrigued, and busy.
We categorized these resources according to what you might be looking for:
pure development issues, details about specific mobile handsets or carriers,
standards information, or news and industry information. We hope that you’ll
find something, whatever your level of interest.
Independent Mobile Development Sites
Many, many sites on the Web are geared toward helping you with regular Web
development. There aren’t quite as many dedicated sites (yet) for mobile
Web development, but you can certainly find enough to be able to read about
the subject and become an expert.

dev.mobi
http://dev.mobi
One of the largest and most popular mobile development communities is
hosted by the dotMobi company, which is responsible for .mobi domain
names. dotMobi funds the community from the domain name business, so a
wide range of excellent resources is available — all for free. The site is a good
starting point for all your mobile activities (see Figure 17-1).
Here are some of the features on the dev.mobi site:
 Regular blogs from the dotMobi team: Read posts from industry
experts such as James Pearce, Andrea Trasatti, Ronan Cremin, Jo Rabin,
and Ron Mandel.
 The dotMobi Mobile Web Developer’s Guide: This downloadable and
comprehensive guide to mobile Web development discusses a number
of mobile best practices, techniques, and approaches.
 A lively forum of developers: If you ever get truly stuck in your mobile
adventures, post a question on this site and find help from thousands of
other members.
Figure 17-1:
Developer
tools galore
at dev.mobi.
238
Part IV: I Want My Own Mobile Internet Space 

 A list of tools for development: Dev.mobi lists development tools (such
as environments, content platform plug-ins, browser toolbars, and test
tools) that you can use daily. A dotMobi promotion with DeviceAnywhere,
a service that tests Web sites on different mobile devices, offers a free trial
on its mobile testing network.
 Training and certification: The site contains an online training course,
links to learning materials, and everything you need to prepare for
dotMobi certification. You can take the certifying exam in many loca-
tions worldwide for a small fee. If you’re a professional developer, being
certified means you know what you’re talking about in mobile — and is
something you can brag about on your résumé!
Anyone who spends more than a few days working with mobile Web sites will
realize the challenges of device diversity. Every phone is different and you
need to know just how they are different to be sure that your site works well
on all of them. dotMobi provides its DeviceAtlas at http://deviceatlas.
com to help solve just that problem — it is a vast, authoritative repository of
information about thousands of mobile handsets from around the world.
Developer.com
http://www.developer.com/ws
Although many articles at Developer.com are targeted at thick client develop-
ment (software that runs in a handset rather than a pure Web site), its wire-
less Developer.com subsite provides some good introductory articles.
The Scripts
http://www.thescripts.com/forum/forum228.html
A small section of a larger development community, these forums are fairly
active and cover a wide range of mobile development topics.
W3Schools Mobile
http://www.w3schools.com/xhtml
http://www.w3schools.com/wap
The W3Schools site contains easy-to-understand articles and reference
guides for many Web development technologies. The site, which features sec-
tions for XHTML and WAP/WML, serves as a consistent reference for what
you can do with those languages (see Figure 17-2).

wmlprogramming
http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/wmlprogramming
One of the oldest and most well established mobile development communi-
ties is wmlprogramming: Its name reflects its founding back in 1999, in the
good old days of WAP!
Run by the ever-enthusiastic Luca Passani, wmlprogramming is run primarily
as an e-mail–based list.
If you’re a Yahoo! Groups member, you can sign up immediately and read its
regular traffic either as it happens or as a digest.
A number of other sites and services that Luca provides are associated with
this mailing list, including
 Global Authoring Practices: This practical list of common-sense devel-
oper techniques can be read instead of, or in addition to, the W3C Best
Practices (see the “Standards and Best Practices” section later in this
chapter).
 The Wireless FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions): This is a comprehen-
sive guide to mobile development, although much of the content focuses
on WAP, and it isn’t actively kept up-to-date.
 Wireless Universal Resource File: Otherwise known as WURFL, this
useful resource is a file of mobile handset information that you can use
to recognize — and adapt your content for — thousands of different

mobile handsets. A related tool called WALL (also available on the site)
makes it easy to use this data to tune your site for different types of
phones.
Carrier Development Sites
Many carriers around the world provide information about developing appli-
cations and sites for their networks (especially those that provide private, or
walled garden, content). The list isn’t exhaustive, of course, but should give
you a flavor of what’s available.
If your favorite carrier isn’t listed in this section, check out its Web site to see
what it offers. Look for a Developers link on the company’s main site.
AT&T devCentral
http://developer.att.com
AT&T hosts an excellent developer community, particularly for the United
States market.
This site features an excellent set of links to information about a wide range
of technologies, including BlackBerry, Java, Palm, and Symbian. It also 
provides
 Device listings: The AT&T site is notable for a superb list of all the hand-
sets on its network. You can also filter and sort them in a wide range of
interesting ways.
 Marketing promotion: Check out a guide to how to promote and launch
your application on the AT&T network and make money from it by using
its billing platform.
 Forums, Webcasts, and events: A rich selection of forums and events for
the community provide helpful, high-quality advice.
Orange Partner
http://www.orangepartner.com
Orange, part of France Telecom, also provides a large number of mobile 
networks around the world, and its Partner site is its developer community
(see Figure 17-3).
241
Chapter 17: A Mobile Internet Web Development Resource Guide

The site is well organized to take you through the process of developing
mobile content and applications and then launching and monetizing them.
Some parts of the site require registration and approval by Orange.
The site features
 Information about the Orange business: Including the types of applica-
tions or sites that it looks to deploy on its network
 A virtual developer center: Including device and interface specifica-
tions, guidelines, tools, and testing

The Verizon developer site, The ZON, features sections on many of the tech-
nologies provided on the Verizon CDMA network, including SMS (text messag-
ing), MMS (picture messaging), WAP (wireless application protocol), and
Web, video, music, and enterprise development. In particular, the site focuses
on BREW technology (a system for delivering spiffy applications that work
well on Verizon’s phones), but most mobile developers can find interesting
information on the site.
Vodafone Betavine
http://www.vodafonebetavine.net
Vodafone provides a large number of mobile networks outside the United
States, and its Betavine site is an attractive site for developers (see Figure 17-4).
The site tends to focus on building — and testing — downloadable mobile
applications, but it covers a range of other topics, including Web and
dotMobi development.

Handset Development Sites
Understanding how mobile devices work is an important part of the mobile
development process. Each phone model is different, and each manufacturer
has clear ideas about how you should make the most of the functionality of
their phones.
Many manufacturers, particularly the major ones, run developer sites, which
are often brilliant places to pick up accurate information about just what
their phones can do and how you should design for them.
Apple
http://developer.apple.com/iphone/devcenter
With the launch of the iPhone, Apple has focused on ensuring that develop-
ers can write useful sites for the handset. Check out the iPhone section of its
Dev Center site (see Figure 17-5).
Figure 17-5:
The Dev
Center lets

244
Part IV: I Want My Own Mobile Internet Space 

The site, which requires registration, has excellent guidelines on all aspects
of developing for the iPhone handset; in particular, it helps you to under-
stand how to make Web sites look great on iPhones.
BlackBerry
http://na.blackberry.com/eng/developers
For people developing e-mail or Web applications for BlackBerry devices, 
the list of developer resources from Research In Motion (the company that
makes the devices) is comprehensive.
The simulators are excellent, and the API documentation for Java application
support in BlackBerry devices is well written.
Motorola
http://developer.motorola.com
The Motorola developer program site provides the usual listing of handsets
and their specifications, and also features some strong download tools, such
as the MOTODEV Studio, which contains all the Motorola APIs, tools, and
documentation in one development environment.
Forum Nokia
http://forum.nokia.com
Forum Nokia, one of the longest established mobile development sites, is an
absolutely vast resource of material, documentation, and support. It also has
one of the biggest and most vibrant memberships in the industry. If you want
to find out anything about Nokia mobile phones, the technologies they sup-
port, or even many of the network technologies that Nokia develops, this site
(see Figure 17-6) is invaluable.
The site is huge, and it’s worth knowing exactly what you’re looking for when
you enter it. The information is split into categories according to the handset
platform (for example, Series 40, 60, 80), technology (as diverse as Java, Web,
or VoIP), or development activity (such as consultancy, testing, quality, and
usability). Nokia also loans devices to developers to help ensure that their
sites and applications work correctly.

Chapter 17: A Mobile Internet Web Development Resource Guide

As a newcomer to mobile development, you might find these three pages
quite useful:
 Device Specifications: Lists every Nokia handset, including details
about screen size, platforms used, and technologies supported:
http://forum.nokia.com/devices/matrix_all_1.html
 Web Technologies: Tells you how to write pages that work well on fully
featured browsers as well as on some of the mid- and low-range hand-
sets. You can find excellent documents, tools, forums, and links for
developing Web sites for all types of Nokia handsets:

Openwave
http://developer.openwave.com
Openwave may not be a name you’re familiar with, and that’s not a surprise,
because it doesn’t make mobile handsets itself. However, the Openwave
mobile Web browser is standard in a huge percentage of handsets — 
particularly in the United States.
So, if you haven’t found what you need on a manufacturer-specific site, the
Openwave Developer Network site is an excellent cross-handset resource.
Openwave (see Figure 17-7) provides a widely used handset simulator that
you’re sure to find useful if you’re developing mobile Web sites or applica-
tions for a wide range of Openwave–based handsets.
Sony Ericsson
http://developer.sonyericsson.com
Sony Ericsson places strong emphasis on providing information for mobile
developers, and its Developer World (see Figure 17-8) is a useful resource.
Figure 17-7:

Chapter 17: A Mobile Internet Web Development Resource Guide

As well as a detailed device listing of all Sony Ericsson devices past and 
present, the site features the usual array of code samples, documents, and
forums — all to a high standard. One unusual feature is a wiki: This developer
site is quite active in encouraging its members to help each other.
Sun J2ME
http://java.sun.com/javame/
Sun has a huge development network (known as SDN) covering many types
of technology and flavors of Java. If you’re interested in developing instal-
lable applications for mobile handsets, Java Micro Edition (often referred to
as J2ME) is an excellent choice. This site (see Figure 17-9) has plenty of infor-
mation to get started.
The site is best suited to developers who already have a working understand-
ing of Java, and it doesn’t have any specific information about particular
mobile devices (for which you should consult the other sites listed in this
section).

Samsung
http://developers.samsungmobile.com
The heart of the Samsung developer site is a detailed list of its handsets. 
The site focuses on Java capabilities, but also contains links to software
developer kits (SDKs) and tools for a range of development activities.
The site also has a Content Market page listing applications for download to
Samsung phones and a fairly small FAQ (frequently asked questions) page.
Standards and Best Practices
It might often seem that the mobile world is full of acronyms and technical
standards, all of which have been placed in your way to make your job more
difficult. But, numerous as they are, most standards bodies provide a lot of
readable information and support for developers.
In addition, a number of sites provide best practice and style guide advice. In
general, these sites aim to describe how best to use existing standards rather
than to reinvent them.

Industry Fora and News
If you want a more industry-centric view of what’s going on in mobile, lots of
forums, news sites, and other resources are available. These sites might not
focus on the technology at a development level, but they’re helpful for read-
ing about a topic, finding out what’s going on in the industry, and, of course,
picking up ideas on what other people are up to.

Ten Fun Things You Can Do 
On the Mobile Internet
You can use the mobile Internet in many ways to keep in touch with
family members, friends, and colleagues and to run a business. In this
chapter, though, we specifically focus on some fun stuff. Our list isn’t com-
plete, so if you find new and fun things to do on the mobile Internet, please
let us know by sending an e-mail to us at info@mifd.mobi.
Download Music
Downloading music to your computer has been a popular task for many
years, and Apple has sold billions of songs to people using iTunes to down-
load them to their iPods. But the iPod isn’t the only game in town: If you
don’t already have an iPod (or any other digital music player), there’s no
reason that your mobile phone can’t become a substitute. Many mobile
phones can now play MP3 music files. Gartner Group estimates that con-
sumers around the globe will spend $32.2 billion on music for their handsets
by 2010, an increase from $13.7 billion in 2007. Those numbers represent an
incredible growth rate. And music, in all its forms (especially ringtones) gen-
erates the second highest revenue among mobile Internet service, after text
messaging.
To download music, start with your mobile network service provider — many
of them now have arrangements with online music stores to let you shop for
and download music. If your network service provider doesn’t have this type
of service, check out the ones on this list:
 Napster Mobile: Transfer music directly to your mobile phone. You can
purchase single tracks or preview 30-second clips before you buy. Songs
you download are sent to your computer automatically. Check the site
(www.napster.com/napstermobile) to see whether your phone is
compatible with the service.

 HooQs: Download your favorite music and video clips to your mobile
phone. This Web-based service is free: http://m.hooqs.com. You 
can build your own channels from a range of media sources and from
these categories: Animals and Nature, Celebrities, General, Humor and
Fun, Movies, Music, News, Sports TV, Tech and Science, and Adult
Entertainment.
 Songs2mobile (www.songs2mobile.com): After you download this
application to your computer from www.songs2mobile.com), it com-
presses your music files into smaller files that you can store on your
mobile phone. This process turns your mobile phone into an MP3 player
if your phone isn’t already capable of playing that type of file.
Music occupies a lot of space and bandwidth, so make sure that you have a
good data plan with your mobile network service provider and enough 
storage space on your phone to store all the songs you want to listen to.
Watch Live TV
If you want to watch TV from your phone, you have several options. On
Makayama (www.makayama.com), for example, you can watch more than 
100 channels from 10 countries live on your smartphone. With the Makayama
Pocket Live TV, your phone practically becomes a portable TV, which you
can use to amuse yourself while you’re standing in line or waiting for your
delayed flight.
Makayama has two drawbacks, however:
 You must download software. If you travel a lot, though, it’s a worthy
investment.
 You must have a smartphone. A traditional flip phone doesn’t make 
the cut.
Also, check with your wireless carrier — it’s eager to build broadcast tech-
nology in order to distribute live TV to mobile subscribers.
Share Pictures
Using Flickr to share photos and videos on the Web has become quite
common and popular. But do you know that this task is now possible using
your mobile phone? Gartner Group expects that by 2010 more than 1 billion
camera phones will be shipped worldwide. The quality of camera phone
images has increased significantly over last year. In fact, some phones, such
260
Part V: The Part of Tens 

as the Nokia N95, can shoot photos in 5-megapixel resolution. When the day
comes when phones have as much as 8-megapixel resolution (coming sooner
rather than later), many people will trade in their digital cameras for handy,
high-end camera phones.
This list describes some photo-sharing services and specifies where you can
upload and share your photos from your mobile phone:
 Flickr: Flickr (http://m.flickr.com) is one of the most popular
photo-sharing sites to let people upload, store and share digital photos
for free at their ad-supported Web site. Now you can use your camera
phone to upload and access your pictures on Flickr. Additionally, Flickr
recently added video upload to its service. 
 SnapMyLife: At the SnapMyLife site, at http://snapmylife.com, you
can upload, download, and tag photos and then share them with friends
and family.
 Photobucket: Upload, share, link, and find photos, videos, and graphics
at this site (http://m.photobucket.com). You can also create slide
shows of photos and videos with music. At the Photobucket online
store, you can print photos and add them to shirts, hoodies, mugs, 
calendar, stickers, wall posters, and many other items.
Pay for Stuff
The new Near-Field Communications (NFC) technology will, for better or
worse, soon turn your mobile phone into a debit or credit card. Phone manu-
facturers embed an NFC chip in the phone that makes it possible to pay for
goods and services by either using a touch-sensitive interface or placing the
phone within an inch or so of an NFC reader. When the purchase is accepted,
the user’s bank account or credit card is charged for the amount.
The NFC mobile-payment system is in the trial stage in the United States. It’s
already widely used and popular in Japan; the Japanese people frequently
use NFC to buy a variety of goods from vending machines and convenience
stores. With NFC, you don’t need to find change to pay for your goods — pull
out your NFC enabled phone, swipe it to pay and you are on your way.
NFC mobile phone and payment services are coming to a city near you with
MasterCard and Visa leading the way. For more information go to:

Chapter 18: Ten Fun Things You Can Do On the Mobile Internet

Find a Hotspot
Depending on where you come from, finding a WiFi hotspot where you can sit
down and work from your laptop when you’re traveling can be a challenge. Of
course, you can open your laptop to look for a spot while you trot around the
city, but that method exposes you to data theft — and is quite inconvenient.
If your mobile phone is always on, locating a hot spot is easy and convenient.
If you own a Nokia S60 phone, for example, you can purchase the Psiloc
Hotspot Finder at http://shop.psiloc.com/en. Or, better yet, you can
simply text message your zip code, city name, area code, or airport code to a
HotSpot Finder service at 4INFO (that’s 44636) to get a list of the nearest
available locations.
Mobile Dating and Matchmaking
Online dating has become quite popular. The trouble is that you have to be
close to your computer to look at who is interested in your profile and has
responded to it. A range of online dating services has gone mobile, therefore,
so that subscribers can update their profiles or check the sites from their
mobile phones.
Likely the most advanced made-for-mobile matchmaking site is MatchMobile
at http://match.com/mobile. Another mobile matchmaking site is
Meetmoi at http://meetmoi.com.
Try it out! You might just find that next hot date or the love of your life while
surfing the mobile Internet.
Scan In a Whiteboard
You probably have been in this situation before: After a brainstorming ses-
sion, the whiteboard is full of great information nuggets you don’t want to
lose, and people are reluctant to write them all down. Creating a record of the
whiteboard brilliance is now easy for you: Just use your camera phone to
take a picture of the whiteboard. A new service from scanR can process the
pictures and turn them into PDF files for you to share with your associates.
Find ScanR at www.scanr.com or on the mobile Web http://m.scanr.com/
download to download the latest version of the software to your phone.

Always Keep Updated with Widgets
Widgets, which are small applications that you download to your computer or
mobile phone, are designed to do only one thing or a few things and they do
them very well (such as The Weather Channel’s iPhone widget at www.
weather.com/iphone). The widget concept is quite different from a full
blown software application. It offers a limited, very specific feature set while
leveraging the Net to keep you posted on your favorite local news, sports
teams, quote of the day and more without launching your browser. Hundreds
of widgets are out there that you can download to your mobile phone. You
just have to limit yourself so that your phone doesn’t become too cluttered
with them.
One of the best places to search for mobile widgets is at WidSets (www.
widsets.com). In fact, WidSets has more than 2,000 different widgets in its
database available for over 300 different mobile phone models, so you have
plenty to choose from and explore.
Other great widgets are available from Yahoo! at http://mobile.yahoo.
com/gallery, including MTV News, MySpace, and eBay mobile phone 
widgets.
Make a Movie
Yes, that’s right — make a movie. Some mobile phone models have video capa-
bilities (such as the Nokia N95) for you to shoot and upload video clips to your
computer to enable you to create mini-movies. If you have the right level of 
cinematic ambition, you can show your mini-movies at the annual Mobifest in
Toronto, Canada. Mobifest (www.mobifest.ca) is targeted to made-for-mobile
filmmakers. On the Web site, you can upload your profile and your mini-movie
for viewing. But don’t plan to shoot a two-hour-long, full-feature movie with
your mobile phone and post it on the site. These movies are short — one
minute to three minutes at the maximum. And, remember: If you don’t get
accepted or receive a nomination, you can always put your film on YouTube for
everyone in the world to see. The most important thing is to have fun.
Read a Book
Whether you’re on a train, at the airport, or at the park (or even under the
covers at home), you can now get a book on the screen of your mobile
phone. No more paperbacks to lug around — simply open your phone, go to
your mobile book of choice, and read the next chapter of your favorite novel.
263
Chapter 18: Ten Fun Things You Can Do On the Mobile Internet

There are a couple of ways to get books to your mobile phone. One of the
most common ways is by accessing them online from your mobile browser. 
A great service by mobile publisher TX2PH (www.tx2ph.com) lets you read
books from Mark Twain to Mary Shelley through its made-for-mobile Web
site. WattPad (m.wattpad.com) lets you publish as well as read over 80,000
books with your mobile phone. And, if you are interested in following up on
your weekly Bible studies, try out http://mobible.mobi from your phone
browser. 
Another way to get books on your mobile phone is through preloaded
microSD/MMC cards (memory cards for mobile phones) from companies,
such as Mobile Digital Media (www.gomdm.com/index.asp).

Chapter 19
Ten Things to Avoid
G
oing mobile can be pricey if you don’t watch what you’re doing. Even
though the mobile Internet is useful and fascinating, you can pay some
potentially high costs if you don’t connect specifically with made-for-mobile
products and services.
In this chapter, we summarize ten behaviors that can easily cause you to
spend way too much money surfing the mobile Internet.
Disregarding the All-You-Can-Eat 
Data Plan
Not all plans are equal, even if people give the same name to different types
of plans. An unlimited plan from one carrier may not include the same 
services as an unlimited plan from another. (And, the plan might not even 
be unlimited or all-you-can-eat.)
Make sure that you know exactly what you sign up for on your wireless car-
rier service plan. Our advice sounds like common knowledge and just plain
good sense. However, we see too many people misunderstand the fine print
of plans they are on without fully knowing what is or is not included with
their subscription to mobile Internet services before they even really get
started.
If you plan to surf the mobile Internet with a computer Internet all-you-can-
eat enthusiasm, you might be quite surprised (or shocked) at the costs you
can potentially ring up if you don’t have the appropriate wireless data service
plan in place.
A mobile Internet all-you-can-eat plan isn’t the same as your voice plans —
unlimited wireless data plans can cost as much as $100 per month, not
including any of the other products or services you subscribe to or purchase
with your mobile phone.

Exceeding the Length of Limited-Time
Promotional Access Plans
If you don’t have a wireless data plan by now — get one. And, be sure to
negotiate a deal with your wireless carrier or retailer. Often, you can get one
to three months of free mobile Internet access (text and picture messaging,
mobile Web, ringtones and wallpapers, video and TV, and more) to try out
and — they hope — get hooked on. The mobile Internet market is quite 
competitive, with wireless carriers creating new promotions every week to
lure your business. Take advantage of one of these promotional programs —
even if you’re a current subscriber your wireless carrier will probably offer it
to you if you ask. Try out as many services as you can within the promotional
period so that you can find out — before you pay full price — whether they
are useful in your private and professional lives.
Keep track of when the promotional period ends, and know the exact charges
you will incur if you keep the service after that date. If you need to decrease
your usage and eliminate services you truly don’t need, do not delay. If you
do, the first bill you receive after the promotional period could be huge.
Engaging in Text-Messaging Overkill
Admit it: Sending a text message to vote for American Idol is fun. Although
standard text messages cost only 15 to 20 cents apiece, they add up fast 
if you’re a power messenger. Make sure that you have an unlimited text-
messaging plan if you’re a power user, and read the fine print to find out
exactly what the costs per message are with your plan and what additional
costs you accrue for any text messages used over your plan limits.
Premium-rate text messaging to short-code numbers for ringtones or news
alert services add up quickly if you are not careful. A joke-of-the-day service
or a daily sports update or stock quote can cost you as much as $2 every
time you receive a message. If you subscribe to a service for ringtones and
wallpaper with premium-rate text messaging billing, it can cost $5 to $10 per
subscription alone.
Although premium-rate text messages are often useful, you should know how
much you pay per message, how frequently messages are sent, and how (and
where) to cancel the service when you don’t want — or can’t afford — to use
it any more. Canceling a service is sometimes as simple as sending the key-
word STOP to the service’s short code. More information about short codes
is available in Chapter 6.
266
Part V: The Part of Tens 

The roaming coverage agreement between mobile carriers enables you to
automatically continue using your wireless carrier’s services when you’re
outside the geographical coverage area of your home network. Your service
still works normally, but you pay an extra cost to the wireless carrier whose
network you’re borrowing. Most U.S. carriers no longer charge for roaming 
in the United States (except perhaps on the exotic Gulf of Mexico network),
but if you take a trip to Canada or Mexico or beyond, your text messaging
(SMS) service can cost twice as much as it does at home, and your roaming
messages aren’t covered under most text messaging plans.
Using Services That Aren’t 
Made-for-Mobile
If you’re planning to surf the mobile Internet by using the browser on your
mobile phone, make sure that the Web sites you visit clearly identify them-
selves as mobile ready. If you’re in doubt about a site, check out the free 
service at http://ready.mobi from your computer to test the site first.
Ensure that any product or service you download using your mobile phone 
is specifically designed to work with your device. Accessing a product or 
service that isn’t specifically designed for your mobile phone can cause prob-
lems, especially if it’s an off-portal product not recommended or provided by
your wireless carrier.
You must fully understand that anything you put on your mobile phone 
by way of a wireless data connection may be charged by the megabyte or
kilobyte (as opposed to by the minute, as in voice calling). If the products
and services you access aren’t made-for-mobile, you’re still charged for the
network usage to access it.
Incurring Costs Outside 
Your Coverage Area
Wireless data roaming charges are extremely expensive. You may be charged
for every little wireless data bit and byte that is sent from, and received by,
your mobile phone, regardless of whether you requested the data directly.
Whenever you use any type of mobile phone, including BlackBerry, Treo, or
any other smartphone model, to chat, browse the mobile Web, send e-mail,
or participate in instant messaging, make sure that you’re in your wireless
267
Chapter 19: Ten Things to Avoid

carrier’s coverage area, and turn off any automatic connections you may
have set. (You usually can turn off services from the Settings menu on your
mobile device or inside the application itself.)
If you truly need to know what’s happening by e-mail while you’re out of your
coverage area, set your device to automatically download only e-mail header
information — not the full messages. This way, you can open only the e-mail
that’s important to you. If you need to peruse all your messages, find a
nearby Internet café.
These days, national calling plans, unlimited data plans, and widespread cov-
erage by the large U.S. wireless carriers makes it easy to forget all about
roaming. Traveling in the United States rarely costs you extra on your mobile
phone bill because most phones have a national service plan.
However, if you travel to another country and don’t know the roaming cost,
you might be in for a big surprise. Roaming charges can vary from $1 to $2 —
or more — per minute or per packet of data, depending where you’re going.
Contact your wireless carrier to find out the roaming charges in the countries
you’re traveling to. Ask about paying for an international plan that lowers the
per-minute or per-kilobit fees in the country you’re visiting.
Signing Up for Too Many Monthly Fees
Whenever you sign up for mobile Internet products and services (both on-
portal and off-portal), such as text messaging alerts, ringtones, wallpaper,
games, music, videos, and other cool stuff, you may find you have enrolled in
a monthly plan for the product or service. Subscribing to additional mobile
Internet services could become quite costly, adding more to your monthly
bill than you had expected.
When you sign up for services on a mobile phone, always scroll to the
bottom of the signup page so that you don’t overlook any items, such as
check boxes, lurking there. The check boxes often automatically sign you up
for ongoing or unrelated third-party services.
Exceeding Your Voice Plan’s Minutes
Choose your voice-plan options carefully, and always monitor your monthly
usage. If you overshoot your allocated contract minutes in any given month,
you could face hefty overage fees and per-minute calling rates beyond the
268
Part V: The Part of Tens

ones specified in your plan. Request that your wireless carrier spell out the
overage fees, and ask whether it offers rollover minutes, in which unused 
minutes in one month are “rolled over” for free to future months.
If you have a friends-and-family plan, where you can save money by connect-
ing a group of people to a bundle of services offered by the wireless carriers,
find out exactly which services are included. Connecting with your friends
and family members by voice, e-mail, text messages, instant messages, and
chat wherever they are during the day can be quite expensive if you don’t
read the fine print to see what’s included and how much of the services
offered are included in your plan.
Also, see whether you pay additional charges for long-distance or interna-
tional calls. Some wireless carriers let you call any other mobile phone on the
same network or make long distance calls for reduced fees.
Skipping the Fine Print Before 
You Sign a Contract
Every wireless carrier’s contract comes with fine print. (And, if you’re as old
as some of the authors of this book, the fine print is hard to read.) Don’t
forget to read it — very carefully. If you’re unsure about anything, ask.
When you’re shopping for a plan, write down everything your salesperson
promises you during the sales talk (including the salesperson’s name), and
have her specify the items included in the contract before it’s printed for you
to sign. If the sales rep refuses to specify the details, or if you aren’t satisfied
for any reason, just walk away.
After you sign the contract, renegotiating is difficult, and any changes you get
to make will likely cost you extra dollars. We can report from experience that
when the wireless carrier screws up your contract (like not including the
promised text messaging bundle or free ringtones for 3 months), nothing pro-
vides as much satisfaction as walking into the store and presenting that piece
of paper the employee signed — and getting it fixed fast.
In most cases it is an oversight from the wireless carrier’s data entry people
or a promotional code was not selected when the contract was entered. If
you have your notes from the sales rep, it makes everything much easier to
get resolved and credited to your account for future use.

Chapter 19: Ten Things to Avoid

Changing Your Wireless 
Carrier Plan Early
If you’re tired of your plan with your wireless carrier, that’s no problem —
you can change plans any time. Be aware, however, that getting a different
number or adding a feature or simply trading up for a new phone model can
launch you into a new two-year contract.
Or, if you’re changing wireless carriers, you likely have to pay an early-
termination penalty fee if the terms of your old contract haven’t expired.
Whenever you make any change in your current mobile phone plan, always
ask the wireless carrier whether a “catch” is involved.
Always do your homework first and try to negotiate for better terms before
you make a change. One of the authors of this book got three free months of
mobile Internet service — just for asking. Another author got a free mobile
phone — just for asking. Ask your wireless carrier occasionally about offers it
might not be telling you about.
Underestimating the Final Price
Have you ever wondered why the price that a wireless carrier advertises for
its service is almost always lower than what you end up paying for it? It’s not
that the carrier is trying to mislead you — it’s just that some expenses (all
those taxes, surcharges, and other licensing fees) aren’t calculated in the 
promoted price versus the actual monthly cost of providing the services 
you have to pay for (very much like buying a new car — the Manufacturers
Suggested Retail Price or MSRP is never the same as the price you pay when
you drive the car off the lot.)
Add as much as 30 percent more to the advertised price and then compare
plans based on this calculation.
Before you even think about signing a contract, have the sales rep explain
how the costs are calculated — and then give you a printout of those 
extra charges. Staple the printout to the business card of the person you
spoke to — it could come in handy after you receive your next bill, especially
if you’re a new subscriber.

Ten Frequently Asked Questions
T
o make sure that you have a basic understanding of the mobile Internet,
we list some of the common questions people ask — and our answers —
to help you get on your way to enjoying what the mobile Internet has to offer.
Most of these questions are answered in detail throughout this book, and you
can always visit our Web site at http://mifd.mobi for additional insights
and tips. Don’t forget that our Web site works from your computer and your
mobile phone — so help is available for you anytime and anywhere you 
need it.
What Is the Mobile Internet?
The mobile Internet, or mobile Web, works similarly to the way the Internet
works. However, the term mobile Internet applies specifically to services and
Web sites designed to be viewed on mobile devices that have small screens
and use low bandwidth. The mobile Internet is for you, on the go, to use with
your mobile phone (or other handheld devices, such as a PDA or iPod Touch)
to access information, blog and entertain, bank, buy products and services,
pay for products, and communicate with family, friends, and colleagues.
Can I Access the Mobile Internet 
on My Mobile Phone?
Most newer mobile phones now have access to the mobile Internet by way of
text messaging services, made-for-mobile applications, and browsers that are
installed in the phones. If you aren’t sure that you can access the mobile
Internet and you have a phone with a noncolor screen, ask your wireless 
carrier whether your phone supports the mobile Internet and which types of
services are available to you.

If you have a camera phone, it’s highly likely that you’re ready to go, and you
may just need to sign up for a wireless carrier mobile Internet package to get
started.
If your phone cannot yet access mobile Internet services, consider setting up
the phone to access the mobile Internet yourself. It’s quite simple, and you
can follow the instructions we provide in Chapters 4 and 5. If you still have
difficulty, call your wireless carrier or go to its Web site, which has the 
information.
How Can I Start Using 
the Mobile Internet?
First, access the mobile Internet from your wireless carrier’s portal. This
method is often included in the fee for a mobile Internet data plan. The portal
normally gives you access to useful information and services, such as news,
weather, entertainment, search, and much more. If the information you can
access from the carrier’s portal doesn’t satisfy you, you can go elsewhere 
(off portal) and search for the thousands of made-for-mobile services and
sites that are available for the mobile Internet. The way to explore the full
mobile Internet is by using a search engine, such as Google Mobile or Yahoo!
Mobile, or by entering a site’s URL in the Web browser on your mobile phone.
Chapter 7 introduces on-portal versus off-portal browsing, and Chapter 8
explains how to use mobile search tools.
Where Can I Find Mobile 
Internet Web Sites?
You can look for mobile Internet sites in many ways, although the simplest
route is to use the Search function on your mobile phone to enter a keyword
and then press Go.
Another option is to look through this book at the numerous examples that
show you where to go to find services that should work on any Internet-
enabled mobile phone.
Also, look for ads and articles that list mobile Internet URLs.
272
Part V: The Part of Tens 

How Do I Know Whether a Web Site 
Is Made-for-Mobile?
The easiest way to ensure that the URL you’re entering into your mobile
phone is a made-for-mobile Internet address is to see whether it has the
.mobi suffix, such as http://mifd.mobi.
Another way to find out whether a site is a made-for-mobile Internet address
is to see whether it looks like one of these examples:
m.sitename.com
mobile.sitename.com
wap.sitename.com
sitename.com/mobile
sitename.com/wap
Sometimes (not always), a non-mobile Web site with a standard URL detects
that you’re accessing the site from a mobile phone and redirects your request
to its made-for-mobile site. Visit http://ready.mobi to check whether the
site works on a mobile phone. See Chapter 7 for details.
How Can I Enter a Mobile 
Web Site Address?
The way you enter a URL for a mobile Web site varies from phone model to
phone model. However, most new phones already have Web browsers installed.
You just open the browser, find the Enter Address or Go to URL box, and enter
the URL address. If you can’t figure it out, read your manual or go to the phone
manufacturer’s Web site and search for the phone manual. Another good 
place to visit is your wireless carrier’s Web site — search for mobile Web
browsing. If all else fails, you can head to your wireless carrier retailer and ask
someone there to show you how to access the mobile Internet from your phone.
How Do I Bookmark a 
Mobile Internet Site?
When you find a mobile Internet Web site on your mobile phone and you
know that you want to return to it, you can save time the next time if you
bookmark the site (create a menu entry that serves as a shortcut). Here are
the steps to follow (they may vary slightly by mobile phone model):
273
Chapter 20: Ten Frequently Asked Questions

1. Open the page you want to bookmark.
2. Press the Menu or Options button (or whatever wording your 
phone uses).
3. Select Add to Favorites or Add Bookmark.
The next time you want to look up the site from your mobile phone, you can
select Bookmarks or Favorites, scroll down the list to the site you want to
visit, and click OK. If your phone is asking whether you want to “connect to
the network,” select Yes.
How Do I Get the Most 
from My Data Plan?
Here are four rules for getting the most from your plan:
 Visit only made-for-mobile Web sites. They’re designed to work with
kilobytes rather than megabytes of data — and not eat up your data plan
in a matter of minutes. Also, stay on your wireless carrier’s mobile
Internet portal if you’re unsure.
Following this rule also helps you avoid Web sites that are filled with
frames, which are rich media Internet images and videos that don’t work
on your phone.
 Don’t waste time on slow-loading sites. If you open a site that takes a
long time to download, leave as soon as possible. Staying just chews up
your money.
 Track your usage as you go. To keep an eye on how many kilobytes you
use each month, visit your mobile carrier’s Web site or check your
monthly billing statement.
 Always be on the lookout for a better deal. Review the amount you
spend each month and switch to a different carrier whenever you find a
better mobile Internet data plan. Competition forces wireless carriers to
continually change their data plans.
Can I Use the Mobile Internet Abroad?
If you can use your mobile phone to make a call in a foreign country, you
should have no problem using it to access the mobile Internet. If your phone
service is from Verizon Wireless, Sprint, or Virgin Mobile, it probably won’t
274
Part V: The Part of Tens 

work outside North America. If your phone service is from AT&T, T-Mobile, or
Alltel, and it’s a tri-band or quad-band phone, it should work in almost all
countries.
Check with your wireless carrier before you travel abroad to determine
whether you can use your phone in the country or countries you’re 
visiting — and to find out what your roaming charges will be.
When you’re traveling, keep your use of all mobile Internet services to a 
minimum — and consider not even using them. The mobile Internet can
become quite expensive when it’s used abroad. Some mobile phone models
have an option for turning off mobile Internet services. Check your phone’s
user manual or ask your wireless carrier before leaving the country.
Why Use the Mobile Internet 
Instead of a Computer?
Because the mobile Internet is a medium in itself, it’s quite different from the
Internet everyone has become accustomed to. And, what you do on the
mobile Internet is also quite different — perhaps not so much today, but
rather tomorrow, after the mobile Internet is well developed. At that point,
you will probably use it more than you now use your desktop or laptop
because you most likely will always have your phone with you.
Here are just a few examples of activities you may eventually do on the
mobile Internet — if you haven’t already explored them by now:
 Compare prices of goods while you’re shopping in a store.
 Have some fun with blogging or uploading camera phone pictures.
 Look up a street map to find the address you’re looking for.
 Buy a ticket to your favorite destination while you’re waiting in line.
 Check your e-mail while heading to the golf course.
 See what the weather is like where you’re going before you pack your
suitcase.
 Follow the latest bid on eBay.
 See the latest update of the breaking sports story that you’re following.

game.
bandwidth: The number of bits per second that a modern mobile phone can
transmit and receive. Usually measured in kilobits (thousands) or megabits
(millions).
banner size: The width and length dimensions (typically presented in pixels)
of a banner or image advertisement placed on the mobile Web.
billing aggregator: An organization that provides one or more billing ser-
vices (Premium Short Message Services, direct-to-bill, credit card, PayPal,
loyalty points, or credits, for example) to off-portal mobile service providers.
Bluetooth: A communication protocol that enables a mobile device equipped
with a special chip to send and receive information wirelessly over short
range, using the 2.4 GHz spectrum band.
carrier: A company that provides wireless telecommunications services; also
referred to as mobile carrier, mobile network operator, operator company, or
wireless carrier.
chat: A software program that enables asynchronous interaction between
two or more mobile subscribers.
click-through: To click an online ad or a mobile ad to reach a third-party

content provider: A company that creates and offers content, such as 
graphical products, ringtones, games, news, information, and entertainment
services.
data charging: Imposing a fee for the cost of using a mobile network for data
services. The two primary models are pay-as-you-go, which is effectively
metered billing because the charges increase in proportion to the amount of
data the user consumes, and preset rates (over a monthly usage period) for
predetermined amounts of data that can be consumed. These charges
become significant in the distribution of rich media content that drives large
amounts of data across the networks.
deck: A browsable portal of links to content, preconfigured usually by the
network operator and set as the default home page to the phone’s browser.
dual band: A type of handset that supports, and is compatible with, two 
different standards or two different frequencies or bands. In North America,
dual-band handsets operate at 800 to 850 MHz and 1900 Mhz; elsewhere they

gallery: An extended set of menus containing links to third-party content and
usually accessed from the main (mobile carrier) deck on the assumption that
the content has undergone some basic acceptance testing, though less
detailed than the testing applied to content featured on the main deck.
Global Positioning System (GPS): A system of satellites, computers, and
receivers that can determine the latitude and longitude of a given receiver
(within its system) located on Earth. It pinpoints the receiver’s location by
calculating the time it takes for signals from different satellites (positioned at
various locations) to reach the receiver.
handset: A mobile phone, mobile device, or mobile terminal.

location-based service (LBS): A service provided to a mobile subscriber
based on the geographical location of that person’s handset. The handset
must be equipped with a position-location technology, such as GPS, to pro-
vide the geographical location information to the network. LBSs include 
driving directions or other information about nearby resources, such as
restaurants, ATMs, and movie theaters. A LBS can also track the movements
and locations of people.
menu: A list of selections that is accessible by pressing either the left or right
softkey while using an application.
messaging: The system of sending and receiving text messaging, multimedia
messaging, e-mail, and instant messaging by using mobile phones or devices.
Multimedia Messaging Service (MMS): A type of messaging in which 
messages contain multimedia objects, such as video.
